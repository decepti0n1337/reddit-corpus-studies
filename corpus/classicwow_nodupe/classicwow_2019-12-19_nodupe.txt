Why do you think the gnomes had a schism?  One side loved the real thing and the other needed to push the limits of what was physically possible.
---
---
---
Do you have a weakauras for remaking SS cd?  I have been toying with a progress bar that just represents when as wears off and maybe a pop up warning at 1min.  I really don’t get weakauras tho
---
except you had layering this time
---
Thank you!
---
You should be able to trade in MC for a period of time. At least my guild has.
---
It killed the pve aspect of the game on the smaller servers.  Can you not read?
---
Play 17 hours a day
---
They must suck if that's the case.
---
Low pop to high pop prices are insane gaps.
---

---
Black Lotus is still 30-40 gold on some servers while its 120+ on other servers.  
---
More players, more raw gold.
---
I was just talking to my buddy about how $50 could get you the safest guaranteed gold purchase in history.  Take 2000g in materials to a high pop realm, sell and transfer back with 10,000 in gold.
---
Online sites are like $150-$200 per 1000 right now.  So it’s a bargain compared to bootleg gold buying.
---
From 10 different servers?
---
Yeah I mean as Alliance ofc
---
You're full of shit. Bartender4 dev confirmed it's broken by Blizzard [https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4/issues/19#issuecomment-565335955](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4/issues/19#issuecomment-565335955)
---
I also scrolled through the full changelog of their latest update on 15th (4.8.8 to 4.8.9) and there was nothing "fixed" with the reagent counter.  [https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4/compare/4.8.8...4.8.9](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4/compare/4.8.8...4.8.9)
---
Yes they may be bis in a vacuum. It becomes an issue if people blindly follow that list and disregard the fact that the second best option is almost as good and does not take away rare items from classes which get a lot more out of them.
---
Imo they should update the bis list with "theoretical bis with no loot competition" and "reasonable item policy bis". Healers rolling on choker and hunters looking for rare Meele weapons is a recipe for loot drama.
---
Yes and I’m assuming that he doesn’t have access to anything better in which case daggers work fine.
---
Agreed. Adding healing done to the scoreboard incentivizes useless meter padding like in PVE raids
---
Mind sooth is underrated.
---
Paladins can fear the undead.
---
Anyone on Stonespine-EU horde here? I have been thinking of making a late night guild. My account is EU but I play from the US (central) time so like 1-6am server time
---
Try out closing discord. ( End the tadk in task manager)
---
&gt; I managed to not die too
---
Wow, nicely done!
---
I can't. The upvotes are unimaginable!
---
It's mostly guilds looking to increase their clear times to place better on warcraftlogs, and people looking for better parses to measure their DPS weiners
---
&gt;top end raiding

---
&gt;MC and Ony
---
Pick one.
---
Because in vanilla faction collution was nonexistant.
---
A dwarf priest would not reach Orgrimmar unscatted
---
No, unfortunately you cant transfer between different subscriptions on the same battle.net account. I believe this was not available untill tbc.
---
You can kill run'thak if an alliance priest mind controls him and that forcefully resets the cooldown timer on ony head.
---
Ofc, GL trying to sneak an alliance priest into org on that realm during primetime but it's possible.
---
&gt; OP didn't talk about hunter
---
Yeah, kinda why I piped up. I was pretty disappointed by the warlock and the VW's inability to hold aggro.  Too used to retail, I guess.
---
He's talking about the effects that come from 400 people from different servers doing it with each other, no one here is really getting that though. They just keep saying "uhhhhhhh I did that in vanilla".
---
TRIED THIS DOESNT WORK 35 HONORABLE KILLS, 101 DHK'S STILL PRIVATE
---
And if you consistently try to get higher brackets to just get R13, then you will piss your server off and they will sabotage your progression.  I would suggest talking to them asap to make sure they are okay with your push for bracket 1.
---
Sounds pretty gay to me.
---
PvP is a different dynamic. It's harder in the sense that you can't click a button to turn off pvp. This changes a lot of minor things of the game, but you get downvoted for acknowledging it, typically.

InB4 Blizzard see this and makes NPC immune to CC

Arkinventory does this.

You should probably pick them up on your warrior and enhance shaman too.
---
&gt; Most Alliance only activate WM to get the weekly PVP quests done.
---
Thats my point. It allowed Alliance in PvP servers to opt out of world PvP, where they repeatedly died.
---
Titan panel itself does not do this, it would be a databroker plugin of some kind.
---
That post was deleted by mods, I tried to go there for info before I replied lol
---
But I honestly can't understand how your experience can be that "Dead" on the 2nd-most-populated US server that exists, while my levelling experience on a pvp server half that size(equal to your faction), with only 35% of THAT number being my Faction in the last 2 months, was that every zone was packed and I saw groups constantly for more common elites like Mor'ladim, the Nesingwary bosses, the Alterac Ogres even.
---
... yes. Confirmes. No point in even bothering to check that out.
---
I got 5 FPS atm so a temp ban sounds great
---
I have a 29 twink, there  are a crap ton of low level players passing through WSG. That get demolished. And some people who try to fake twink at 29 by buying some random boes. These people also get trashed pretty bad. Games are usually about 30% twinks. This may change after a few weeks of bgs being out. But at the moment, your statement is very wrong. 
---
Did you mean vanilla?
---
On both sides and cross servers which is the main problem. A large scale win trading like that will never be punished. They beat the system.
---
Everyone could see the Serenity Now thing coming. It *is* fucking hilarious, and will never not be.
---
only in a radius around you, not the entire BG. why are you so hostile?
---
yeah they just remember what you had when you were last on that character.
---
That's only for honor. Maybe he wants easier dungeon groups or raids or you know a full main city.
---
I'd never transfer from a high pop to a low pop.
---
Drain Tank spec dude, it’s unbelievably better and smoother. 
---
If you’re not familiar lookup Dive’s drain tanking guide.
---
Thanks! I was pretty proud of that.
---
You can get by for a few months on 4 hours of sleep a night. Anything less is casual shit to the no life rankers.
---
BGs are cross-realm which means coming from different servers fundamentally does not matter, and instant online communication is easier than ever.  I don't understand why that should be surprising at all. It's 40 players paying in the same faction in the same online game called the World of Warcraft, not 40 players from 10 different secluded alien kingdoms.
---
Big Oof. Thanks buddy
---
PvE server master race.
---
Dude desert is the best part! You probably ate too much for your enttre
---
Is there a ranking system website with who has most honor on either faction/server?
---
Thats not true, im an aussie first 2 days of AV was 3 mins max queues for horde, now its around 20 mins - 45 mins peak,
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and 1 hour in the dead of night.
---
I would be happy to check them out.
---
I think ony dropped around 90g a kill. And mc bosses something like 40-50g a kill too
---
Random shit can drop from the NPCs
---
Love it sounds like it was epic
---
It's how they get around fighting all the tower generals.
---
Unfortunately there's a limit to that on Macs - it needs a discrete gpu, which rules out most older stuff that isn't a 15" Pro.
---
The current system screws over win traders. Win traders relied on WSG being super efficient to work.
---
AV pugs have other issues, but they certainly aren't rewarding cheaters.
---
&gt; Chances are you will die before you get to Garr
---
Yeah about that. If your raid is dying before you get to garr you should join a better raid.
---
that character really be staring
---
yes, getting high pvp ranks is hard.
---
It has 0 agi or AP. 
---
People may be stupid, but the lists are exactly as advertised. Like everything else in life, just because you want something doesn’t mean you can have it.
---
Whisper somebody 10-19 in storm wind to queue you for a Battleground then get in the BG, promptly leave and voila! Instant teleport to storm wind!
---
There's a CentusPlus addon that you need to run for few days.  
---
It counted 8k players on server where I'm playing. 3k of them are level 60.  
---
Another way to check activity of server - check total amount of items on AH.
---
On populated server it would be inbetween 17-23k items, depending on time and day.
---
Where have you been?Horde wins 80% games when we setup small defense
---
You had 15 people and didnt kill the 4 members of the opposite faction?
---
Meanwhile any spare alliance gather at BRM to cause them to lose the buff again....
---
Hahaha just noticed
---
You are getting a million per week.   How many people are you realistically going to find in between queues?  1 or 2?  AV games are probably averaging like 20 mins now.   15 min queue.   16 hours * 60 min / 35 mins =  27
---
If you play 16 hours, you can play about 27 AV games a day on horde.  You get 200 honor per Queue time by doing Wpvp.  27 * 200 = 5400.   Multiple that by 7 days, 7*5400 = 37800 honor.
---
You get another 38k honor.
---
Not necessarily. Look up Rathmus AV Strat (or Nath Strat). If horde ganks Alliance at Galv, they can absolutely choke Alliance at Stonehearth and give them nothing.
---
The explanation below is absolute news to me.
---
What’s it mean when I’m not in the raid group any more
---
why blizz in ZF if you're specced for FS and CoC? FS/CoC is way better
---
Being slapped in the middle of the field during WSG gives me nightmares.
---
Yep. The simple truth is that the majority (all?) extremely high rank players are either botting or account sharing when they aren't playing themselves. There are no special tactics, AV strategies, or things to do outside of AV that are going to be more impactful than this.
---
Gnome priests are bis
---
Yeah, same for me, it's almost surreal actually wanting to play again haha. Definitely agree that Cata is where it started, with the railroad "revamped" questing, though an argument could be made that it began late Lich King with the introduction of the dungeon finder
---
This post is a month old, but with 5 friendly targets in range and only 1 enemy in combat, Battle Shout generates more threat than Sunder Armor.
---
It's not uncommon for random DPS to die on Magmadar or certain adds even in decent guilds. He never said the whole raid wiped, buddy.
---
Mind Vision is my favorite because it lets me see things people don't WANT me to see, and they also get to know I saw it.
---
Meeting with an undressed elf in goldshire?  Mind Vision sees you.
---
Racing to get a node only to find nothing there.  Mind Vision sees you.
---
Catching up with the raid and blundered into a trash mob and died when feign didn't save you?  Mind Vision sees you.

I agree. Retail leveling is so fast you skip through the entire experience. Also you just get everything handed to you. In Classic the progress actually feels earned.

Mage looking for an invite to any curated premade server NA. 100% mount, raid geared, 300 engineering, consistent; any spec, no expenses spared. Tired of tourists; ready to win games. PM me if you'd like to combine our success.

With help from my trusty Infernal who definitely hasn't killed all my horde buddies, I've exposed the traitors in undead clothing.
---
I'm still pretty noob and this was super helpful
---
It really is easy. Put trap around a corner or pillar or some LOS thing. Get agro on the mob after the tank pulls. Run it to the trap.
---
Whitemane is slightly horde dominated but it doesn’t feel like it at all, massive amount of alliance
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure he has an older 15 inch pro.
---
*clean*
---
How was this not completely obvious
---
We try to take it a step further on our server, we have two heads and try to drop one exactly 6 hours before raid time and the second right after. Yesterday we got screwed though b/c someone dropped it at 7 hour before raid time but usually it works. Tuesday’s are always rough though because you have to deal with server downtime and at least 3 times we’ve had the server just reset and that makes it available again.
---
Poor guy didnt get a ony buff, may aswell log off now, cant complete MC now.
---
Or you could get 7 min wins on Alliance
---
What class? You can solo incendius in BRD with some classes, you just have to kill 9 uncontested elementals (and 1 Dog) on the way. And there are some more additional elementals you can Take.
---
Wait, is enh shaman good in pvp? (Honest question, noob here)
---
It's not a direct quote, but the idea is found in Aristotle's *Poetics*.
---
On my server if a guild wants a guaranteed buff they control the buff all day, not just hope it's available when raid time comes.
---
I wonder why they don't let you. You were able to in vanilla wonder if they are worked people will u use it to get multiple 60s then merge the accounts
---
What you're really saying is *you've* read the thread and now you're annoyed that other people are discussing information which you've recently been made aware of.
---
Idk how you dont see faction changes as being a huge now a game like classic. You want to play alliance? you gotta lvl alliance side. want to hit 60? Want an epic mount? You gotta grind in game. The fact that you think micro trasactions strengthen a game is mind boggling to me.
---
Pretty sure cast times less than 3 seconds take a hit to how much they benefit from spell power.
---
Drake Talon Cleaver?
---
What did he do to get your old char banned?
---
Just get neat plates addon-best unitframes one available with built in debug tracking/scale able priority rebuffs and a flawless cast bar built in. Many aesthetic options too. I prefer the blizzard frames one
---
Considering he managed to fix it without Blizzard doing it, sure seems to me like it's a developer problem.
---
Just joined Celestial on Herod (horde) earlier today.  For PvE I found Awakened guild on Atiesh (alliance).  Both raid weekday mornings.  Atiesh is a PST server tho.  Not sure how much that matters to you.
---
Shadow panther doesn’t really offer any talent builds
---
I love the healer list.
---
“People out of line of sight?”
---
Yes
---
Tank = Find the tank and heal
---
DPS = It’s their own fault.
---
In raids, specifically late phase 1 and all of phase 2, druids are certainly worse than warriors. My guild's warrior tanks are all geared enough that I'm starting to fall behind. It sucks.
---
Why would it annoy me? It was just a statement of observation that many people are mentioning it in many posts now. No need to be so defensive! :D
---
I mean, if the 10 people who block the path to kill the 60%ers can wipe them then the 30 people going to Balinda would too. It would accomplish very little besides reduce the chances of taking and holding FW and RH from what I can tell.
---
If you don’t mind me asking, roughly how much did the commission end up being? I am actually pretty tempted to have my Lock done. Love his art style!
---
Hows the economy?
---
Herod alliance has a guild named Daybreak, raid from 10am-1pm server I believe
---
Food, education, healthcare, stuff like that which takes up a big portion of people’s expenses. Rent since 2000 has gone up like 60%.
---
Cars aren’t a good example because technology efficiency advancements keep inflation low. Just sayin. The sub cost has stayed the same, but dev costs haven’t, so they make up the difference with microtransactions, everyone knows that!
---
2h in pvp for sure.
---
 In tanking 5 man's I might use the SoR just for the guarantee extra threat but I don't seem to have much aggro issues as long as I judge either SoR or SoC on first Target and successfully hit the 2nd consecration holds enough aggro for the rest.
---
 Unless I'm in a wsg that really needs a healer or tanking 5 man I use 2h. 
---
 You really don't need much extra str that people think you do. You're not going to be able to kill people 1v1 unless you're fighting over a min. But what I like to do is find people at 50% and nuke them down. I sit back and heal until I can pick out someone weak and go all in. If shit hits the fan bubble and run
---
Lol, you must be very pleasant in person.
---
4 year old pc is surely enough to run WoW at the lowest settings and probably more in non-raid settings.   You probably don’t need a new graphics card.  What is your built-in graphics?  There are probably some cheap upgrades that will get you a nice boost
---
Discourage bridge chokehold turtles.
---
What does Orgrimmar look like?
---
Thanks for the info, PST servers are fine depending on the raid schedule.
---
Thanks for the info
---
But they also take shorter to cast, so spells get the same DPS benefit out of them.
---
Actually the quest NPC tells you that you can find them in Terror Run. Though upon my own further investigation it seems like it might just be one specific section that spawns them and they aren't necessarily scattered around that much. From what I recall though I was able to get like 50-75% of the bones I needed just from that one area, which is WAY faster than hoping for the monster drop rate IMO.
---
Horde here, I saw the meta shifting as I already started defending and stalling alliance at galv. and between iceblood and tower point, or retaking fw gy and afterwards wiping alliance in our base. 
---
I guess they just want fast, efficient games, they have instant queue, why would they want to stay for 30+ min in a turtle AV? While for me, 20-30 minutes games with a ton of honorable kills + full objective win is fun and actually nice, I gladly wait for 15 minutes after such a game. 
---
Watched some of Maitoz Stream and they manage to take nearly all objectives while killing Drek in 8 minutes, this is super efficient, but only if they don’t get wiped.
---
Is the mage ally? Transfer it to Benediction with your other character.
---
IF #1 for being close to everything. SW #2 for ony buff and goldshire erp and darn #3 for queueing in a quiet spot for pvp.
---
Nice server choice
---
Hey man,  I am trying to find the stupid sound file for the night elf death wisp spirit form so I can disable it. It's like this awful wind noise but I can't find it anywhere.
---
I tried the method of making the folders following the path that leads to a text file of the sound, but maybe I did it wrong or didn't pick the right sound: 
---
```C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Sound\creature\whisp\wisploop01.ogg ```
---
File ID, 564117 from [here](https://wow.tools/files/#search=wisp&amp;page=14&amp;sort=4&amp;desc=asc) , which I had thought would be the right file after listening to it...
---
Any ideas? It's driving me nuts.
---
Jokes on you he bought off gold farmers and your warrior gets banned a second time for life
---
You have to go in the config and change the variable related to 3D acceleration. That's the only thing that fixed it for me. It's really not difficult at all and there are lots of guides out there to do so. Good luck!
---
Depending on how contested an area is, it's rarely worth it farming there if you have another solid way of making gold. That way you can just buy whatever you need and still have some extra gold. Most classes have some way of getting at least 20-30g/hr. I'm currently leveling a warlock so I can solo farm DM:E which is really good gold per hour. So whenever I don't really have the time to do anything in game that takes more than an hour, more or less, I'd just hop on that and farm. That way I'm set for future needs when new content is released.
---
? 
---
You can watch the video, the dwarf didn’t even get to do it, warlocks killed him, why claim to be him?
---
Worse than the private server experience aswell.
---
If your raid was ruined by missing one buff then you suck.
---
“Hello Ironforge! Merry Christmas!” (sits in corner alone, forever alone)
---
Ranking would potentially be a top reason for transferring.  If you're on a server like faerlina for example, there's going to be enough psychos that it's going to be much harder than necessary.
---
Same here!
---
Nurse?
---
Wow that is crazy low. 500k was barely for bracket 9 here.
---
this version of av is truly pathetic, worst part is, that if av wasnt suich honor grab, rep farm later on would be probably impossible to do (alts etc), the pvp rank really means nothing, just better equip but dunno for what if youre just pvp player
---
After what phase 2? Alliance camped BRM the entire of phase 2. 
---
Alliance where camped in open world because the entire PvP population never left BRM lmao.
---
All I see is two additional fuck holes
---
That's not really how it works.  More people ranking means the pool for each bracket is larger.  The question is how many of those people ranking are at the peak end?  The ideal scenario is to have a ton of people doing just the bare minimum to make the bracket pools bigger.  So even if you don't plan on pvp ranking, it's beneficial to everyone if you just do maybe 1 or 2 bgs a week.
---
I'm just gonna stick with consumable materials. If there's a decent amount of guilds on your server that think they're better than they actually are then assume consumable prices will go up.
---
Not green items tho :)
---
Why would he have access to a fucking corehound dagger but not access to something like stormstrike hammer which will be better for him and you get it from rev AV...
---
Because I am the Dwarf.
---
While Blizz is at it, they should do paid character re-customization, paid faction change, a barber, and transmog
---
/s
---
It's very deep into classic before most classes see weapons that are anywhere close to the level of the r14 ones.  There's a few exceptions though.  But there's more instances where the pvp gear is stronger than the pve alternatives.
---
Lol man you sure are bonkers
---
Never understood why people directly farm particular items when they should focus on making gold via their class and profession strengths and then buying the item. Its like a tank complaining that they can't farm in tank spec yet they could make a crap load tanking dungeons and then buy what they want.
---
yeah and stalagg
---
^(act cool, lets hope he falls for it)
---
You need X amount of active players to even rank up on your realm I believe.
---
Bagnon lets you see what’s in all your characters inventory/banks. Trade skill master has a ledger for sales/expenses and also an inventory of all your items, which characters the items are on, and the value of those items.
---
What auction addon do you use to display the auction price
---
Huh, on Tuesday? We've had a really good record of knowing when the head is going down and we're a fairly small guild, the 6 hour rule works well
---
Yea. If I was in your situation and one realm was clearly more enjoyable than the other I’d just transfer the mage over. Fyi. Something I didn’t think about before I transferred my char after p2 is check out the AH on both servers and if something is clearly cheaper on your old server. Gobble them up and then post it on your new server for a profit. I wish I had at least checked out the AH b4 I transferred.
---
Horde or ally?
---
I am undead
---
Holy moly! You guys still have 2hr que times?! That’s nuts!
---
My brother has been doing Tribute runs, and his progression was basically what you described. The more gear you get makes it a lot easier though, so keep that in mind.
---
Yea.
---
It didn't work but after all was done, they pretty much let me HS out after some minor trolling.
---
Alliance has insta ques in bgs at 60. If anyone should be complaining its me with 15m av ques. But you know what? I farm herbs, grind mobs, do things in game for fun while I wait. Blizz does not need to tamper with this game to make it the insta zone in game that retail is.
---
But he's playing a 15 year old video game not being with family or taking care of his health...

Some people can't fathom that simply beating Ragnaros isn't enough of an achievement.

This is true. You inevitably meet people and fine regular group mates, guilds, etc. as you go along and especially as a healer where you will be wanted for a lot of groups

Im curious, why join an EU server instead of just a US one?

Oh man, got ‘em.

That's why you skip Garr and go do Baron/Shazz first then come back to him.

sheesh, the jealousy is running right through me Jerry, right through!

Can confirm. I just sold a stack of 20 Fadeleaf for 24 gold last night on my server (four stacks of 5 for 6 gold each). 
---
I also had enough money for my mount by level 35 because I was making and selling Free Action Potions that were selling for 1.5 gold per potion at the time.

Otherwise arms is better
---
did hard log off (instead of reload) said i was dced and after logging in i was alive in tb, i still did get rep from AV and marks and was able to write and ppl could target me, weird shit
---
Just stop that shit man, not worth it in any way.
---
just did a /who 1-60 on flamelash and there are 21 people online, including my scout character.
---
What time do you have for hobbies, friends, and cleaning/shopping?
---
I think the point that they were trying to make is that back in vanilla, yes you could do this, but you'd be competing for pvp rank with your 39 teammates because BGs weren't crossrealm.  There was nothing stopping those 39 teammates from keeping up with you if they wanted.
---
Whereas now you'll be competing with only like 5 or 6 of your teammates because the other 30ish people are all on completely different realms where their honour gains have no bearing on your rank.  This means that you and the teammates from your own realm have a huge advantage over people not using this strategy since these levels of honour may not be achievable by them.
---
Fake news. There’s at least 5-10 stealthed horde rogues in this picture.
---
Putting my armchair psychology hat on, I would make an educated guess that players who join RP servers are more invested in the game and the overall WoW experience. They join RP servers to interact with others in a lore-based narrative adventure. Nobody is going to RP with you if you're an annoying and unfriendly player. So those who are actively seeking out RP tend to be the ones looking for more meaningful encounters. And if you also participate in RP, it signals to the other that you are taking things seriously and there's an opportunity to play.
---
Of course nothing is 100%. So there will always be some assholes in RP servers too.
---
That's like as bad as it will get typically and not for to
---
Wow it's like a dead mall, complete with the disinterested Santa
---
There's got to be like a 100 ppl there.   How do you kill anyone?   Also where is it?  lol, I only played horde.
---
Technically a valid answer
---
Sometimes it blows my mind that people care so much about this garbage PVP system. 
---
If there was any other spell power plate gear available before phase 5, I would not spend a single moment participating in this joke of a PvP system. What the hell are the people thinking who play classes that have perfectly good raid / dungeon loot available to them? The rank 14 title is more of a joke than vendorstrike. It serves no real purpose.
---
I’m going to resub for a month and start a new character.  Are there any pvp servers remotely balanced? Not necessarily 50/50 but closer to 60/40
---
A few people in my guild said they were go for rank 13/14 like it was something you could just do casually. These are guys playing like 20 hrs/week.
---
Anybody saying stuff like this 1) didnt play vanilla 2) doesnt understand how the system works.
---
Cheapest in terms of raw gold. In terms of time invested, I’m not so sure.  
---
  
---
I wouldn’t recommend any fresh 60s who aren’t already close to exalted in AV to obtain the AV mount over a normal one.
---
I think they mean a further discount.
---
Yes you lose the discount
---
So freaking glad I picked sulfuras I think it’s one of the gem servers out there rn.
---

---
You can play them all! But in order to answer that question for you, we need to know what your goals are in classic. Are you looking to just have fun and level up at your own pace? Want to pvp? Hardcore or casual? End game raiding? Do you like healing? 
---
Your answer to what you want to achieve will affect the most “optimal” class choice you can make (although at the end of the day anything is viable and you can make any of those classes work). 
---
I vote Warlock.
---
Oh dear
---
Honestly they need to just make it so the buff goes out/refreshes when anyone drops the head at any time. I don't give a shit if it wasn't that way in vanilla, this is Classic and this is a solution with literally no downsides. Any guild can get the buff when they need it and logging in 5 hours before a raid just to sit in Orgrimmar would be a thing of the past.
---
I mean, the only way to test it is to go out into the worls and do stuff?
---
Don't fully understand what happened here to cause him to reset. ELI5?
---
Guild item. Mats probably already on lock, and you only need 1/guild
---
Ya I don't know why people are so sensitive about this. If you're parsing in the 90s on a hunter your competition is realistically 50-60 parses from rogues, wars and even mages/locks. If they're also parsing 90+ then you're gonna get smoked as a hunter.
---
And it only gets worse from here lol
---
Wonder see what those undead titties taste like
---
That’s not how it works
---
If you want nerfs there's a thing called Bfa.
---
Pretty much the same as any other server.
---
I regret not rolling a troll so bad...6% hit is so easy to get and easy to swap around with different gear pieces...9% is so much harder and makes certain slots locked in to +hit gear
---
For EU? Ashbringer. Dunno about US
---
I'll quote myself from a similar convo just because its relevant.
---
&gt; Horde figuring out a new strategy doesn't make it horde favored it just means horde adapted. When you constantly lose you start trying new things, when you're alliance and you always win why would you change your strat. Even if you're alliance and you win 60% you're still going to run the same strat. The reason it worked for horde was because we literally never won so when we try something new and it works, we repeat it.
---
I know you didn’t ask, but just in case it’s helpful, to target yourself with a spell you can do the following: 
---
    /cast [@player] Heal
---
Typically I heal with mouseover macros that follow the logic of mouseover &gt; target &gt; self. That would look like this: 
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][] Heal
---
We should start a revolution and just bombard Flamelash with Alliance.
---
&gt;your LionHeart helm is BIS for a very long time
---
Forever actually afaik
---
Most of the rank 14 grinders (by which I mean the actual legit ones who will get there, not just big talkers) are doing it for PVE reasons. Look at how many warriors the big speedrun pserver guilds use (20+ minimum) - and they will never be able to equip them with rare warrior offset and good weps. So r14 weps are their answer.
---
Horde can’t do premises, their queue is too long
---
hardpacket snowball
---
I quit retail 5 years ago...
---
Or uninstalled and killed themselves
---
Yes, Bag Brother is fantastic. I use it to view my bank and bank alt often.
---
Yeah man playing once a week for raids and then 2 days if new content comes out is hardcore.
---
Benediction. More balanced, young server. People still leveling and few raid decked out players.
---
Needs more alliance tho, like 55/45 or so.
---
US for me
---
Yeah, except Alliance is losing 70-80%, but they aren't really trying to win, they're just trying to have quick games.
---
Make 1 of each character. All of them. Then when urges come up, okay one, or the others.
---
Horde player: merely mentions wpvp
---
Alliance: QUIT COMPLAINING. I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW I DIED OVER 40 TIMES TRYING TO GET TO BRM. YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT BAD? ALLIANCE HAVE LESS NUMBERS BUT WE STILL PWN ALL OF YOU DISORGANIZED NECKBEARDS. CRY ABOUT IT.
---
Im one of those, currently fucking sucks. Cant find a dungen group between 22-08, and thats not even late/early..
---
They aren't queueing as a group.
---
"Audiences can believe the impossible, but not the improbable." - u/CherryDaBomb
---
- Michaell Scott
---
And its going to get worse as horde adapt and become better at winning and maxing honor. The queues went from 5 minutes, to 8 minutes to 12 and now I'm averaging 15 minute ques. At 5 minutes most horde didn't care as long as they got decent rep, at 15 minutes you're going to want to max as much honor as you're only getting 2 games an hour.
---
are you guys getting a bug in wsg where the stat menu constantly opens when you try to use abilities on enemies? It's super annoying.. any idea on how to fix it?
---
anyone interested in buying an account on skeram horde with a 60 rogue and warlock? pm me
---
I just logged on to check, there were 16 players online across all levels (1-60). I went over to horde and checked how many lvl 60s were online, i got 50 ppl online (Which is the max it shows) ... Alliance side is more than dead..
---
Monolith DKP has this integrated as well.
---
Premades pull it like that because if you pull right, you can get Drek without arguing any of the war masters and save yourself a lot if time, however it requires you to tank it in this spot.
---
It's actually an incredibly good way to get sick gear onto the 20+ warriors you need for speedruns without having to split the tiny amount that drops in PVE content between all those players. 
---
Just look at how many warriors a guild like Progress uses, and think about how you'd even start gearing all those characters on 1 raid lockout per week. The answer is have them grind ranks.
---
Unless they fixed it, if you jump in front of the ship you would just get pushed along with it. If you managed to clip thru the boat then all you gotta do is jump and you land inside.
---
I second that! Bigglesworth is awesome. Signed a NE Hunter.
---
That orc behind you sure has a nice sword.
---
I can’t wait to meet you on the battlefield!
---
Damn shame they axed that one. They put AV and IoC on a separate queue from the other BG’s, but SotA is no more.
---
That's like, your opinion, man.
---
&gt;What is going on here?
---
RNG
---
I haven't gotten one in about 70 RTV in darkwhisper gorge in Winter springs I thought it was just really bad rng
---
The only way to truly win in this game is to complete a character, and we share a problem. Altism. And we have to fight it, brother.
---
Orpheus drinkin a 40 in the death bas-ket!
---
Lol underrated comment
---
Clearing dungeons with a tank heals and 3 mages is absolute prime xp/h
---
I mean, 54 is fine for the first half of BRD (and it's common to only do half), but I could see people getting antsy for full runs. But I'd stick tank. Do Maraudon and BRD arena runs, and you'll get there.
---
Yep the #changes people won. No one listened to the #NoChanges when they said how scuffed 1.12 would be
---
Wow such true story.
---
I would have been LFG for level 40 elite quests about 3 months ago. I hit 60 ~2.5 months ago. Then got my pre-bis. Then farmed consumables. Then did wpvp. Now I'm sitting in my capital city queueing for AV. Sorry you are just late to the party.
---
I am transferring my Pally here and I have to say there are plenty of ally people lol
---
I feel like there might be some recency and perhaps server proficiency bias to that.  Faerlina isn't a great microcosm of the wow general pop for obvious reasons.
---
Well then just don't rejoin it? Games are neatly sorted and you always know if you're joining a game in progress or a new one.
---
A Venture Brothers fan?
---
Very sad when you recall how full it was just 2 months ago
---
We don't know any of that. Just because they have 12 hours to play doesn't mean they do? Also I don't really need to criticize someone over the internet with no knowledge of their situation
---
No why?
---
Bigglesworth and Incendius are pretty balanced
---
I kinda wanted to do this on Herod before it gets too bad.
---
Had to check subreddit lmao, was thinking same
---
Now this is pod racing!
---
He looks a little sad
---
Grobb is pretty close (55/45 or better afaik), with a slight horde edge, so it's not a bad server to roll ally on.
---
He is. I stopped playing him at 57 and he has been a little lonely
---
She said "Santa," not "Antonio Brown."
---
Game of Thrones
---
what a bunch of fucking losers lol
---
That was my sense of it early on so I jumped back to games with less of a locker room feel. WoW culture is a bit... jockstrappy. Nerdstrappy I guess.
---
What kind of freak eats fish with a spoon?!
---
Couldn't give a fuck mate. Horde never sat in premade groups 20yards apart from entrance of brm to entrance of brd in the entire phase 2 gank fest.
---
Such a shame horde didn't have as many dole bludgers.
---
Flair checks out
---
the issue is that AV has become a canerous zergfest where people will mass AFK report you for trying to play rather then giving up when its clear you wont win in 7 minutes
---
On our server we control the buff 24/7 through a large coalition of guilds. Drama free.
---
Is the lantern main hand????
---
All oce pvp Servers are Horde favoured. Ive know that. I just wanted to know how the economy was in yojamba.
---
I tried to make the remark that you don't need to look at parse and loot lists to preform good in classic. How hard is it to push buttons at the right time, bring all the consumables and grind to get the best gear possible?
---
But hey, I'm just full of shit.
---
Hey, no line to santa!
---
People shouldn't open the trade window and demand shit, that's just rude.   
---
However,   
---
All that math = out the window because you literally click a BUTTON and make it.    
---
Fuck mages charging 1g for a portal when the reagent costs at most 12 silver (i pay it anyway lol, as is tradition)

Lul, going from 305 to 312 increases your glancing dmg by 15%. You glance 40% of the time. That would be a ~4% white dmg increase, which is also a 4% rage gen increase. But go ahead and keep bowing to a spreadsheet you dont even understand. Must be nice to not have to think.
---
Where did I say that I didn't care about the game? I care alot about this game and I don't really play it "casually" I just don't think that the min/maxing approach regarding checking lists and running tests to see how you perform the best is needed. I perform more than good enough without it.
---
Jesus christ, I have more than 200 days played in Vanilla, Pservers and Classic combined. I know this game, that is why I can preform good.
---
how much was it supposed to be worth?
---
Me and my frienda started levelling hordies on flamelash a week or so before the whole shit hit the fan. We plan on lvling without being ganked by any alliance to lvl 60 then transfering. Look on the bright side i guess!
---
Its also SoulShards which is extremly annoying.
---
And thats cool. What I meant was one of those people who believe it's the end all be all.
---
It works just fine. You most likely have retail version installed.
---
holy shit..
---
It still takes less time to find the npc than it does to fly to the cave
---
Because the Horde doesn’t have any holiday spirit. They have to import it this time of year.
---
Spinal reaper would be better, but that's from Ragnaros. TUF is much better than your current axe in pretty much every conceivable way. Higher weapon damage, higher DPS and more crit. 
---
Also, are you talking about PvE or PvP? In PvP racial weapon skills have basically no effect. You still need 5% hit. 
---
For PvE it's still better. You'd need 9% hit compared to 6% in order to reach hit cap for level 63 mobs i.e. raid bosses, but that's it.
---
TL;DR: Use the mace.
---
I can’t until I try, same as you and the people receiving them. That’s the part you don’t get. It’s not about performance. WoW is not a competitive game, there is more to it numbers. Gear distribution, rewarding players - it all ends up as player retention, which is easily the biggest challenge of the average raiding guild.
---
True healers are never misplaced. Their instinct subconsciously leads them as far away from enemies buisness side of the stick as possible.
---
It took like 20-30 hours to get exalted not much of a grind ?
---
3% drop, sometimes the rng just sucks
---
You know there is a hide post button that takes all of 2 seconds, a lot quicker and less effort than having a big REE
---
20 good players can carry 20 okay players. I’m glad you found some where to bean okay player. Good luck getting past the second boss in BWL.
---
As someone from Herod... stay away from Herod.

Can confirm Benediction is fun, active, and balanced. We'd love to have you.
---
Does flay break on LoS? I know arcane missiles doesn't, so long as the first one can be cast they can go behind a wall and it's still locked.
---
So I'm still not sure how death rolls work. Are you trying to get 1?
---
I'll keep it because by now I have a few rare Recipies. I made a shit ton of money with the Robe of Winter Night back when nobody could craft it.
---
They go for 2g30s on our Server which is barely above Material-Price.
---
One means you lose
---
Upvoted this :)
---
i understand a agree with u, but its mostly a pshcology thing. Big expensive items u need or want seem too expensive to buy so people (not doing the math) spend their time to get those items instead of their money. 
---
I don't farm my own herbs for this reason. Most of the time I just do the math and if I can turn a profit making pots while buying the herbs i just do it. 
---
Still, its hard to justify buying the expensive stuff myself.. that I do sometimes farm.
---
haha nah man only a few and on herod there's usually just a handful of ally and a small group or horde. they'll kill me sometimes ofc but also a lot of the time I'll be able to kill one with cold blood then my queue pops and I can just dip haha 
---
also it's directly north of the yeti cave in tm. if you head west of our zone in it's just a few hills over
---
Perd/cht is a bis combo no matter what race
---
Imagine being so mad that someone likes AV that you make up stupid arguments to try to prove them wrong.
---
you mean worst.
---
Just get some friends and get good
---
that number is pretty low. rest assured that if ANY server exists that literally doesn't have enough players for R14, enough (more than enough lol) will transfer to it. 
---
Assuming the minimum is met, getting R14 on a tiny server faction is immeasurably easier than doing it on something like Faerlina... therefore plenty will transfer. zero doubt about it
---
I would love to be on a server like this.
---
Kind of confused about the epic mount quest for warlocks. When people sell runs, are they doing the whole thing with me? Or just that last part where you need a group? And how much money do I \*actually\* need? Seems like maybe a couple hundred to buy all the stuff in the AH, plus maybe 85g to buy a run? So like 250 or so gold all in?
---
What's it like playing with that deep, raspy, sexy voice of Executus?
---
Imagine telling someone they are mad because your own argument is 100% feelings and 0% based in any actual information
---
There is no way to actually replicate the vanilla experience unless you have a time machine.
---
My 2017 base Macbook ran it. Not WELL, granted, and the body became hot enough to burn my legs, but it kinda ran! :)
---
You start off rolling to see who goes first (1-100). Whoever wins that roll, then rolls a number equal to the amount of gold you’re rolling for (let’s say 800) so you’d roll for 1-8000. If you roll a 7538, the next person rolls 1-7538. If you roll a 174, then the next person rolls 1-174.
---
Whoever reaches 1 first loses, and hands over their gold
---
300 people
---
I don't have an argument.  I made a statement that I enjoy AV and I find Warsong boring, and you jumped up and down showing that I'm bad at everything and must just not like games because I don't play the same way you do.
---
You're ridiculous.
---
OMG what are the odds?? Oh. 1 in 7828.
---
I have looked it up and can't find anyone that has actually tested it in Classic.
---
I feel like everyone is going do that now that it is known lol
---
you are the one not getting it. you realize that voice chat existed in vanilla while ingame voice did not, right? People queued AS GROUP to AV in 2005, exactly like now. except back than 10M+ were playing. 
---
xrealm came late in vanilla but that's the patch we are on.
---
no changes.
---
Is there even one on horde?
---
“Warsong is boring.”
---
This is a call for the people of Azeroth.  We’ve heard the stories, seen the bodies, and feel their suffering in our hearts.  Let’s bring this fight to their doorstep and take Orgrimmar for the Alliance!
---
Flamelash Alliance needs YOU.
---
star of mystaria wow that's about 1/1,000,000,000,000
---
Good job, you can read!
---
no the answer is split runs.
---
I see people say around 650g all up is average, so minus 250g is 400g if you ah all the items. I forget how much but i believe there's other items you will have to pay for regardless of if you farmed all your mats anyway.
---
Mine came to just under that amount, i already had \~700g when i hit 60 anyway.
---
I haven't sold a run, i imagine some will be selling the horse spirit so all you need to do is zone in and run and talk to it but others may just be selling a spot on a run just ask the person selling it. I haven't even seen anyone selling it before, I've done it for 5 or so people which is just guildies or randoms who ask when they've seen me LFM dmw anyway.
---
A raiding guild, sure, but of the well known assholes on my server all of them are in a guild that takes forever to/cant clear MC.
---
Fuck you?!!!!!!11!1!11!
---
Yeah but you want to be the person getting the most honor per hour. If other people are doing the same thing, doesnt change the honor per hour. 
---
The way the system works is that if something gives your more honor per hour you wanna be doing it. It's a comparison of who gets the most honor per week. System doesnt care if it comes from world pvp (terrible honor per hour) or AV (crazy honor per hour) it just takes the totals of each player and compares them.
---
It's still representative in some way. You can kinda tell anyway though who's a shit healer without it based on positioning, when they use Dispels, etc.
---
Just finished a BG against this strat, the fact that this strat takes 1hr minutes to beat horde pugs doesn't really say much about this being effective.
---
And yet Blizzard still opens unrestricted paid transfers. Really makes you think. It will be a miracle if Classic can survive Blizzard's idiocy.
---

AM or PM?
---
premades wont pull with horde inside :)
---
Not everything in a video game has to be useful for some niche purpose. The game is allowed to have items that are completely optional that do nothing of strategic value, and are purely for flavor.
---
I legit thought that your character either had a fucking fiery fist or summoned a meteor or something before realizing it was likely the weapon they were holding. I feel betrayed and stupid now. Thank you for this, I love it.
---
Bartender4
---
maybe you're just on a small server. We've got guilds that would purposely grief other on world bosses and known ninja players, all got MC parses within 1-2 hr. You could even look at streamers and see what pos they are, nobody actually cares.
---
Pretty good, we have him and some of the private server guys in the guild. He normally does melee call outs in raid too.
---
Only real way is to join a premade tbh
---
Lol look at all these fuckin virgins offended by a pair of tits.
---
good for after the event for people who want to use to novelty items.
---
For MC that's fair especially with those consumables you're using. Thanks for your detailed explanation that would explain why.
---
I did type poorly and for that I apologize as obviously in pve a moonkin will pretty much never get a proc. 
---
MC is fairly easy as raids go. Down the line moonkins go oom on longer boss fights. And the boss takes longer as they do less damage from being oom. 
---
When I have spell damage gear on my lower ranks of star fire still hit pretty hard. Even 2 or 3 ranks lower is a lot of mana saved.
---
Demonic runes and other consumables or buffs obviously make a large difference; especially at this time of raiding content for moonkins.
---
Long Live Pagle!
---
If you need only head to clear mc your guild is bad
---
Quite lucky I found a guild that raids 6pm to 9/10pm but normally finish well before the end time. I’m up at 4am or 5am so it is doable!
---
Horde have their zerg tactics engrained into their minds from swarming people in phase 2. It's why their pugs are so effective. They are used to aggressively overwhelming the enemy with superior numbers. If alliance actually rally together and fight back they can easily dominate a horde zerg that will quickly crumbly under any pressure.
---
There are a lot of dead servers unfortunately. Since Blizzard doesn't believe in server merging the best we could have hoped for was transfers. It's not ideal, but it's what we've got.
---
according to the chart I have it takes 3 months min.   I am guessing BWL is feb.
---
That's what the russians seem to do. If they fail the initial push they will turtle for the rest of the game.
---
Step brother played a gnome for a couple hours once waaaay back in like '05 or '06. Got into an argument with a night elf dude in Tinker Town near the tram, when the night elf got fed up and dropped this gem on him: "Shut the fuck up, my dick is bigger than you!" He deleted his gnome soon after.
---
You are looking at a server in this post that doesn't have enough people for rank 14, and no one is transfering there.
---
Titties ruins it.
---
I've seen that ogre once on my mage and lost the roll to an asshole holy paly because "spell crit is my best stat."
---
Don't even get me started on SGC. 145 runs on my warrior and I saw it drop once on my mage. It went to a 54 warrior who was the only one who could wear it in the run.
---
I'm saltier than western Thousand Needles.
---
Wow
---
I agree with you but I’m not sure how that’s the opposite dog what I said. I think I worded something funny
---
Js if you are passing on sub par gear, especially if it doesnt beat dungeon blues or greens, to then give yourself the best pieces it really isn't anything that admirable. My LC pass out the inferior weapons to other members, then immediately Mageblade went to mage lead and BRE went to Fury lead, as did Brute to rogue lead. It is one thing to gear the raid as best as possible, it is another thing to pass minor upgrades onto masses and horde the best pieces for the LC. Not accusing you of that, but it may appear to others like that, JS
---
Was going to ask if that was piss.. definitely not a beer I'd be caught drinking
---
Wrong. Running it fine usually 60 FPS on an 11” air from like 2014. No discrete gpu.
---
&gt;50+ is a good time. Don’t listen to people that say prot is a waste, it makes a noticeable difference. Anyone suggesting you ignore prot spec has never played warrior seriously.
---
This so much. You can tank as arms or fury with the right gear but people on this sub pretend like prot is trash and it's really not. It makes a significantly noticeable difference when I'm tanking as prot vs arms. And if nothing else it's worth it for shield slam because it only costs 20 rage instead of 30.
---
250
---
Interesting list because I think Tirisfal Glades is the best starting zone followed by Mulgore. Really there is no wrong answer as it’s all a matter of preference and style. I just find zones like elwynn forest to simple/straightforward and more on the boring side. dun morogh would be my favorite on the alliance side followed by Teldrassil.
---
My top 2 review:
---
I think Tirisfal does the best at race identity and you really feel like you’re apart of a larger group the forsaken. The way the starting zone flows straight in to brill and the mobs you get to fight are fun. The undead have some of the tougher starting quests like where you get to go into the family crypt which forces you to group up early on. I also think Mulgore is really good with race identity too as the whole zone feels dedicated to Tauren. You walk by all the villages with their totems burning and windmills spinning in the vast planes. A lot of people don’t like that Tauren are so contained but I think that’s part of the charm to the zone. As a Tauren you really feel isolated and have to rely on your own people for things.
---
Upvoted, dont tell me how to live my life!
---
This. Worked for me the other day.
---
I played with u guys amd wasn't sure what to expect, but it was by far the best AV game i had played. We absolutely destroyed them mentally and they didn't get anything. Our game if i remember was like 40 mins but oh man was that a fun game. Props to u guys
---
our secret is spamming macros with pretty much the same strat in reverse, minus turning in blood for lokholar. IMO the tree kinda sucks I've had alliance summon it on us 2x and we've won both those times, last night they got it but all stood around in mid while the horde just ran around strife and killed Vaandar with virtually no opposition. we had 0 people defending our own base because alliance was just standing around the tree, not willing to attack until he moved.
---
That's what most twinks enjoy. Twinks fighting eachother is wicked fun.
---
Nobody need them, but people will take a dwarf over a night elf. Its also pointlessly playing a weaker version of the same class.
---
Try 15 min delay on firemaw stormwind..
---
Those cowards wouldn't do it
---
Just make sure you enjoy what you play, it's gonna take a few months to get 60. So no idea playing something somone Said was good if you dont enjoy it
---
3PO Never tell me the odds!!!
---
Haha cool! That video sure inspired a lot of people to play warrior
---
The weapon skill goes beyond chance to hit, it also mitigates glancing blows. Without an item to increase your dagger skill (Muggers Belt or Edgemaster's) your DPS will significantly decrease even at 9% hit.
---
Blizzards wallet wins that day
---
It's not possible on Flamelash. Also, why would people transfer there? They would need to bring 100-200 people with them just to open up the possibility of getting R14 and I don't think those people would be very interested in the idea
---
You can do from 240-300 just in maraudon if you get the +5 herb enchant on your gloves so you can pick ghost mushroom earlier, plus you can also get blind weed in Mara also
---
Well the average Alterac Valley match length is substantially going up. If you have consistent premades that's one thing, or if you did it at the beginning. But that's not so possible anymore.  
---
And 20-30 hours of slamming straight Alterac Valley (and that's likely a conservative estimate with a lot of wins) doesn't appeal to the typical wow player.
---
we dont use that corupted word in classic
---
I’m not your comrade, babushka.
---
Horde.
---
Having 4-5 people in base defending completely stops this. Horde only tend to attack with 6/7 people early on as they like to turtle.
---
And the best item still didn't drop
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13353/book-of-the-dead
---
Yeah sure but what’s the last parish u made
---
The best spell ever added to the game.  Hunters get it in BC, it allows them, for a short period of time, to redirect all threat they generate to the target they cast misdirect on.  It was meant to be used to pull to tanks, but it ended up being best used to grief your friends, especially ones that were healers.
---
You have to have destroyed IBT for that to work tho. But yes, with IBT dead you can pull drek without the warmasters.
---
Thanks!! I’ll check it out
---
[Bagnon - 1.13.3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon/download/2842654) (Direct download link)
---
Contains Bagnon + Bagbrother, showing you your other toons invens + banks inside your own bag frame.
---
Its when you put the two together..
---
You should put it into the translator so they can understand it
---
I’d like to know too
---
I wish I didn’t get this joke
---
I play horde on Bigglesworth lots of alts so I spend a lot of time in leveling zones.  I’m not seeing very many allies since phase 2 hit.
---
1. Elwynn Forest
---
2. Mulgore
---
3. Teldrassil
---
4. Dun Morogh
---
5. Tirisfal Glades
---
6. Durotar
---
Don't @ me
---
That’s true and my raid group uses it but if somehow the buff timer gets messed up we just proceed as normal. I personally like it since it helps MC go by quicker which is nice since my raid does MC on Saturday nights at 11pm. So whatever helps the raid go by quicker the less I have to worry about staying up to late
---
Lmao my man, throw those Distracts
---
tank
---
That's because its nipple.
---
First person to hit 1 loses, simple enough now?
---
&gt; Even the top guilds seem to be midcore and there isn’t a huge presence of ultra hardcore players. There are a ton of alliance guilds that clear MC and ony every week though.
---
This is the biggest boon of Atiesh honestly. It's so strange, but awesome.
---
It's a highly populated server where most of the players appear to actually work through with a dungeon group if some wipes occur and/or teach strategies etc. Talking about things like Hunters having their pet tank if tank falls, or 4 manning dungeons if someone leaves. Not super try-harding/elitist even in PuGs.
---
I played first on Atiesh and have my first 60 there. But my guild didn't have a dedicated raiding group, so I tried out a character on Faerlina and holy hell the elitism just exudes itself. A lot of players on Faerlina only follow the meta and don't think to use their class in "unconventional ways" (aka not just focusing dps meters and actually ccing/interrupting).
---
Makes me very tempted to go back to Atiesh, and I most likely will because not being able to enjoy the contested pvp zones has gotten tiresome. But overall am playing retail and other games more so Classic doesn't feel as appealing atm.
---
its incredibly believable, I've faced 4 alliance premades so far and we lost in ~10 minutes each time. Horde isn't organized enough to do what is necessary to stop that sort of large coordinated force, I can't imagine a premade in AV losing to a PUG tbh
---
some people actually enjoy playing the game, who would have thought
---
TBH if multiboxing is allowed, and cross faction collusion (devilsaur mafia, griefing Kazzak with level 1s) is considered acceptable, this is like a drop in the bucket by comparison.  
---
Even if there were something against the ToS here, which I don't believe that there is, the one major thing you should know is that the Neutral AH takes a significantly larger cut of the sale than the regular AH, so you'll be losing a fair chunk of whatever you're looking to transfer.
---
DR on most people ? I thought DRs weren't a thing in battlegrounds ?
---
I was getting 3k-5k bonus honor per match alone. Those 450 HKs represent a large number of AV games played today. A massive amount of honor that was on my profile page this afternoon is no longer there
---
snowballs have strategic value
---
Not from that distance
---
Same boat, shoulda jumped on the train right away, instead I waited 4-5 days and lo and behold, it all went to shit and there's no way to get rep fast now.
---
I can smell u down from here
---
I logged in just to upvote this.
---
When you say “galv isn’t winning the game” then it shows that you’re suggesting the most important thing about the game is killing drek — but the reality is that’s not really the case and intention of av, and playing av properly shows a clear horde advantage for THAT instance
---
You can knock friendly npcs ? The fuck
---
For some reason it attracts me
---
https://wago.io/classic-weakauras/classes/warlock
---
Nice
---
In vanilla my main was a hunter and i LOVE traps, tools, kiting, and all strategies that come with it.
---
My dream for 13 years has been reroll a night elf hunter with a stealth cat pet and solo dungeons, gank in pvp from stealth....
---
Well long story short im a dwarf priest now coz while playing retail i relized that healing is sort of my thing and im on a pve server anyway.
---
I would say both options are great and i am pretty sure warlock can make you slightly more gold since you wont need to pay for ammunition and pet food but when in doubt i can recommend hunter!
---
Stalagg
---
I'm sure most servers were pretty standard, but there could be differences. 
---
I had Star for shackle because Holy Magic is yellow
---
Diamond for Sap, because the effect is purple
---
Triangle for banish/hibernate (green)
---
Square for Trap, because it's a block of ice
---
Moon for sheep, light blue like arcane casting effect
---
Shield went on the Tank
---
Yes.
---
I think both are evenly matched when it comes to gold making as both can solo mara and dme, i think only hunter can do the tribute run? Which would make hunter edge out in that regard? But im unsure if tribute makes more than dme runs, youd honestly have to do a little bit more research or hopefully someone will reply to my post that knows more.  
---
Besides that, I think hunter is more enjoyable? I havent fully leveled one as I only got one to 39 to twink them out but I have to say the leveling experience was far, far more easy and enjoyable compared to warlock. Simply because Hunter is unmatched when it comes to soloing. Your pet actually holds aggro and while warlock drain tanking isnt bad, its much slower. You can kill with no downtime as a hunter, which isnt true for warlock.  
---
Id rate them equalish when it comes to pvp.  
---
Really if you cant decide, flip for it.
---
prob was already going to transfer to be with friends or something. Nothing to do about this TBH
---
I have the same issue with Elvui and I cannot see the reagent amounts aswell
---
It rocked. But I think the changes to the access add ons have since the latest patch caused all sorts of problems. Last week it told me I was going to lose rank significantly. After the previous weeks pretty much being bang on and honor calcs being pretty much accurate down to the single digit
---
Congratulations on rank 2.
---
Monday and Tuesday every week for literally months
---
Who needs 15 HK per week.
---
Are you referring to the 5k shown by your addon? If so it's just your addon that's not working properly, nothing to do with blizzard's honor calcs.
---
Honestly they need to break premades in wsg. Just make it so more than 4 people of the same server cannot be in wsg, that way you fix how alliance does AV premades by simply queuing at the same time. One of the reasons you have nobody in wsg *is* because horde dont want to queue into nothing but alli premades. While it wont make it competitive with AV, it will bring life to it because those who wabt smaller battles and dont care for ranking, will join it. 4 people is enough for you and friends to play in it.  
---
The fix for honor grinding isnt nerfing AV honor gains, its simply changing the honor grind itself. So if they would change anything, it should be to reduce the rank 14 grind, either by making it so ranks update daily instead of weekly or make it so you can buy the gear through honor being used as a resource and titles are purely cosmetic. Obviously this makes it so pvp gear is much easier to acquire but im not entirely sure its a bad thing, could be disasterous though so idk.
---
Can you imagine the absolute shitshow that would ensue from transfers being free? 
---
Guilds would be hopping around on a weekly basis for server firsts are recruit pools, and undermanned factions would basically empty out overnight as the players leave for servers where their faction is dominant.
---
That's the anchor for ya!
---
Alliance scum 😤
---
Did you reset on GY tent? I pull the flag mobs and AoE 1 shot them and can cap.
---
Agreed Durotar is the worst by far.
---
Why are the boobs so 18yoldporn while the rest is crazy rotten zombie witch?
---
I think they're still waiting for him
---
So.. you people say that it's impossible to get Rank 14 on this server as Alliance, but how about rank 13? Or Just 12? Wouldn't that be very easy? There can't be a lot of competition of the standings...
---
At least a dozen games, mostly victories with 3k average bonus honor and lots of AV mark turnins.
---
I always see Banksyalt in the SW AH using the auctioneer on the box to the left haha
---
There is quite a few at this stage. Onyxia p3, Ragnaros ranged nuke etc etc. I agree it's not perfect, but I strongly disagree it's useless.
---
Why would they? Horde have a backdoor that never got patched.
---
No need for wolf riding
---
You need to do AV till you get exalted from frostwolf clan in order to get the frostwolf mount
---
Pickpocket all of SM Cath and then clear it.  I make about 50-60 gold a run which takes under an hour.
---
If your addon wasn't able to save the data permanently, that information is lost. Emphasis on addon data and not actual data on blizzard servers. Stop crying and wait until tomorrow.
---
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/bao2av
---
I create everything from scratch, you can see more here
---
Same category as Spinal Reaper, slightly better. DTC has bad speed and not as good stats as TUF. Also, like Spinal, if you are an orc, it's much better for PVE due to being an axe.
---
It was. Ugh, I like boobs but this is so grossly gratuitious. The character designer didn't even direct the artist to do this...
---
I am that Dwarf, I was killed twice and the third and last time MC broke without anyone touching me, then I was killed haha.
---
Thats why we have BFA now, ppls like you
---
LFM = LOOKING FOR MAN. YAAAAS
---
Seems like a lot of diminishing returns. Which seems fair,  not to blow the importance of weapon skill out of proportion.
---
I had 2 in a row from the same vein last night, no flex because that's the first 2 I had since 2 weeks, I don't farm it..
---
I'm not crying I'm just stating Facts :D
---
Also I already answered to Horde scum below me please read ;)
---
No need to be sorry, your experience can be very different from mine.
---
There's forsure way more twinks now compared to vanilla
---
Luuuuuul
---
so the fun police had to stop them again?
---
fuck I'm so damn fed up with blizz stopping everything remotely funny
---
If the mount itself is 640g, how much is the 60lvl riding skill cost?
---
Was rank 13 on boulderfist - Wiggly &lt;Shaman r teh overpower&gt;
---
Likely the coolest thing I'll get this Christmas!
---
Nice! Procreate?
---
The pvp vendor in sw is in front of that big wooden door u described (for the early rewards like trinket)
---
Yes! Wanted to do this but they never tanked in front of the door :(
---
ill check it out, i really prefer the original blizzard look of my nameplates but if i can get the command to get the opacity to change that would work for now
---
there isnt another skill that you have to buy. just the mount
---
This is cool and all but seems like a LOT of effort. I played vanilla through TBC and we never worried about world buffs for MC/BWL like people do in this version. People act like you CAN NOT do MC without it.
---
Don't need riding skill
---
From BWL every hunter is using a crossbow anyway. Trolls are still the best pve choice but if you want pve dps why pick a hunter?
---
This, I do a full dungs on my priest for gold and MC, while leveling a Hunter and warrior alt :)
---
I'd consider the priest my main character, but I want the hunter as a gold making machine and the warrior for PvP :)
---
Its lower than 40, my level 35 rogue is rank 1.
---
Hesus is that you??
---
LOS checks are expensive and you have to do them on the server as well, otherwise players will hack the client and cheat. Basically you're asking "here is a random straight line in the world, does it hit anything?". It takes a while to compute and the more things it can potentially hit, the more CPU it will eat. Server CPU is expensive.
---
Interiors and dungeons in the game are based on BSP, a technique also used in 1st person shooters like Quake. It allows for very cheap LOS checks (among other things). It doesn't really work with big open spaces. Notice how you can't see into an inn from the outside, for example. It's part of the optimization.
---
Anyway, in open spaces (trees in AV, for example), are really expensive to LOS check, hence they choose to have many objects be ignored.
---
That's my best guess. Could also easily be that they have much better algorithms for open space LOS checks now than before, but #nochanges.
---
I haven't seen a single drop rate on wowhead that was even remotely right
---
Someone told me that it comes through if you put spaces in between the letters. Not sure of that's true?
---
The kill strat on razorgore is way more reliable and easy to execute than the CC and kite strat as long as you can make the DPS check, and that shouldn't be remotely an issue.
---
Why would they be costly? When Phase 5 drops, nexus crystals become available, but it will be at least a week before AQ opens. So by the time AQ opens every raiding guild will already have 20-70 Nexus crystals (more, the further you are progressed) and then you need the recipes to drop in the first week.
---
The only demand for nexus crystals will be from non-raiders who want AQ enchants.
---
Fuck deathrolls... I lost 200g on them.. Never won one, not ONE roll.
---
I chuckled at the Frank Drebin reference.
---
Riding thru base is faster
---
Snowballs are OP
---
Same first run
---
If he's the same guy who makes the retail version, I doubt it'll ever come out. The retail version of Altoholic was last updated at the very start of BfA, almost 18 months ago.
---
Simple, it doesn't.   They're exempt
---
You are thinking of the Warlock ability 'Drain Life'.  Mind Flay flays the targets mind.
---
Mine silithus.
---
Ashbringer and Earthshaker. Firemaw and Gehennas is horde dominated by you have large private server guilds on the alliance side on those who does push back hard vs horde.
---
As fury prot because your threat is so high and you have some much rage, of you are wanting to maintain a good place you build threat on mobs and when the last mob is being attacked (it should already have shit loads of threat before they even start attacking it) just white hit it and build rage and go into the next fight with 50-100 rage.
---
do you clear all the enemies you can or just bosses
---
Nah it wasn't a one min delay on the turn in, it was a min delay on every action you took. Buying an auction, getting it from the mail box, buying 5 vials and making 5 pots took more than 15 mins. Funniest thing was that once the head dropped the server crashed and rolled back and the buff was lost and I had to remake my pots.
---
Are you EU?
---
Why would it be controversial?
---
Almost to the point of considering pserver scene again
---
Wait until you're buying business software at $150.00 per user per month and the uptime makes WoW Classic look extremely good.
---
No, just 15 hks.
---
&gt; Im not asking about PvP server lol, I know it must be such a mess. 
---
can't imagine it on a pve server tbh
---
you notice the boss is up, rally your guild and your allied guilds to azshara/blasted lands only to have some other group from the other faction be a little faster and now you're unable to do anything about it, the boss is theirs even if they only brought 1 raid to clear it and you're standing there with 150 people?
---
lol what?  Last time I check Bigglesworth was like 75% horde to 25% alliance.
---
Always 30min corpse run to BRM, 15min corpse run to DM, and Felwood and Winterspring is pretty much over-run with hordes.
---
You must be horde if you think it's "pretty balanced"
---
Everything is O.K.
---
Hence I'm so glad for the discord organization.
---
Snuck a boss kill yet post the timer here so the horde can track the respawn. Nice one.
---
That potion was actually planned for wow before languages were even put into the game.
---
It was supposed to be in vanilla but I guess they just forgot about it once they added languages.
---
Meta-shit.
---
Alliance premade groups tend to get 4k honor in 8/9 minutes these days.
---
Wasn't fearlina 40/60? That's still 50% more horde.
---
Haha lel bless his heart!
---
Did you have any contact or how did you know your Server/Name? :O
---
What a nice Thing to do and to get in touch again :)
---
the effort to acquire the pattern is not worth it imho
---
Me like it, zug zug
---
Have an enemy priest MC you and get shields/buffs so the locks cant damage you.
---
Hindsight is 20:20 but it might have been possible to bodypull adds to disrupt the smaller group and maybe get them to wipe. If you'd do that with pvp-flag on they'd have the pvp solution so blizzard would probably not do anything and if they used that pvp-option you could just kill them and tag azuregos.
---
100 ranked people is not bad at all, just transfer with 9 or so people and each make 9 alts.
---
1-10 is like what 3 hours? then you queue wsg and leech 15hk shouldnt be too bad
---
I've been deathrolling the past few days, I think I started with 150g and in total I've lost 600-700g. Now I'm at 110g. Good stuff
---
lol I play with 50ms standard
---
but av is like 250ms+
---
Goddamnit Alder, my my ring!
---
You're missing out. Strat live is the best lv60 dungeon.
---
except no one wanted 1.12 av in the first place
---
Oh god, yea just stop there :D
---
Awesome job 👍🏻
---
Chest loot is about 25g in vendor + potions, i rarely sell anything because it's a waste of time and loses you money.
---
Am I rhe only one thinking that flask is the rarest drop here?
---
K E K
---
Please point me to the announcements where it is stated that these will be allowed. Never seen that for Classic, nor do I expect it.
---
lol who tf is still not exalted?
---
The secret is to keep it up, if you want it that badly of course. Your competitors will burn out eventually coz they just dont sleep enough.
---
On another note, I am a competitive feral druid tank myself and while I see the appeal of r13-14 gear for tanking there are better alternatives in the long run. Aim for rank10 blue head + wsg exalted pants + bwl chest,pants,shoulder + lbrs gloves instead of the epic set and you will be just as fine trust me I have done the math.
---
No joke, ive ran strat live over 20 times, nearly 25 and havent seen the neck, its the only reason i run it for
---
Praise Sithrak!
---
That’s why I asked if it existed?
---
Non fury you mean? We want no pvpers in our AV, we are here to PvE.
---
It's not the honor, it's the rep. People are getting their exalteds done so they have no reason to queue to AV, leading to less games and longer queues. Although as long as there are significantly more horde queuing than alliance, the alliance doesn't get queues, but the horde queues are getting longer because AV activity is diminishing due to people finishing their rep grind.
---
Why the fugg do you remove memes on non-sundays??? Like what's the point, except maybe because mods themselves don't like memes... This is why i dislike reddit..
---
If more Horde had chosen to roll Alliance then you'd have long queue times instead.  
---
 Should be thanking us tbh
---
Well if that were the case the spell pen piece would just not be available from the vendor - this is the exact case for the exalted caster ring which won't be introduced for several phases. And OP's complaint is with WSG gear not existing, while AV rewards do exist - so logic would dictate that that's not the issue.
---
When I die it makes me wait almost half a minute.  Lucky.
---
As a Horde player I can respect this.
---
Sure it kinda sucks for losing faction, but atleast AV was interesting.
---
I still wish we will get old AV back with minefields and stuff.
---
Oh no argument there, I'm sure being horde on a horde dominant server is fun enough. I joined pvp server for the same reason, I like classic pvp. Getting 1v10ed at every flight path, and camped all the way to the instance is not what I would call pvp. Was cleared up a bit last week when bgs dropped but it's back to the same thing now. If I didnt have a guild of friends who iv been raiding with for years I'd have quit like all my RL friends have. Raidlogging was not what I wanted out of classic wow and it's either that or reroll. Good on you for not greifing thou, blows my mind how few people have that mentality.
---
Wow, he did a fantastic job! It’s awesome!
---
Hey Torag
---
That spot is farmed by the Horde who are sitting in the queue. Good luck staying alive long enough to turn in your medallions. On my realm it’s better to buy the rep rewards inside the instance.
---
You bad if you think brd is bad and/or luck dependant. I make 40gph at the least with brd, 60gph if i highroll.
---
I am rank 3 yes.
---
Damn thats very good news
---
To nothave to spend gold on riding skill.
---
People wearing min max dps gear for AV when they destroyed because they have no armor or Stam.
---
As an ally on pvp server horde heavy, we don't raid with dm or ony buff since P2.
---
lul
---
Because it’s useless for a feral Druid to get rank 14. Rank 13 is good enough
---
if an Alliance player gets ganked in a server where there is no alliance, did he get ganked?
---
Youre right, I'm dumb
---
Dunno if this is a list of no-lifers or an attempt to brag ?
---
This is a troll?
---
I hope you told him he didn't have to reimburse the orbs after all that!
---
My squires carry my consumables
---
Wepskill=glancingblow penalty reduction=More Rage=More dps=More threat. That's why you go Human/orc. And yes you can get edgemasters but they only take you to 307. You need 308 to get the full benefits from wepskill
---
Using edgies over other gloves is a DPS/mitigation loss. Possibly even losing a tier set bonus, which becomes a lot worse as the game progresses.
---
Posted for a friend, I'm neutral in this argument.
---
I definitely had rank in 21-30 bracket in 2005.
---
What do you all think would be better for farming gold:
---
Holy priest w/herb doing DM lashers.
---
Shadow farming herbs and killing satyr in Azshara?
---
I have about 6400 mana and 3500 hp with self buff improved fort in holy spec right now.  I’m not going to able to raid for the next couple of weeks so thought I’d focus on farming some gold when I can get on.  So respecting shadow for a couple weeks is doable.
---
Just got Benediction so can switch weapon type. For shadow my gear is slightly below pre-raid bis though. Other than benediction I have mostly pre raid bis for healing but not much spell power as I’m moving to more pure healing gear. 
---
I have been collecting herbs in Azshara and killing the groups of satyr as holy but considering other options.  Have never done lashers—I don’t have key yet.  I do have holy nova but no power infusion.  My second prof is alchemy.
---
Other suggestions welcome!
---
Get more than 6/9% Hit so your White Hits Hit more offen and you get more rage  i have 10% Hit with + belt and the dagger and im beating the tank Aggro more often than i should ;)
---
You ask the people that made bongos
---
Come through to Kirtonos. No queues and relatively thriving ally (it's still like 70-80% horde tho lol)
---
Bagnon does it. I use both bagnon and titanpanel and got this function.
---
There are a lot of servers that are similar to vanilla.
---
Who wants to go the distance... oh wait never mind that was over quick.
---
#e z
---
But aren’t you saying 305 would be fine
---
That's a very roundabout way of typing "fury".
---
Classic has only a single riding skill, the one you learn at level 40. That system was changed in 1.12.2 to the system we have on retail today (150 &amp; 300 skill, expensive and cheap mounts).
---
CC? in strat? What? Are you not running with mages?
---
Don't bother with ranks, really. Get the gear from PvE, it's simple, far less time consuming and if you have a nice group of friends, you'll have a fun doing it too.
---
Crossrealm bgs were in classic
---
The respawn timer varies, so not really trackable. Knowing when he was killed is obviously not bad, but regular scouting is needed if you try to secure kills.
---
there is only 1 riding skill in classic. once you've bought it at 40, the cost is all the mount.
---
I believe rank 10 is rare set, and rank 13 is epic. Even would be hard to achieve theough casual play (if I'm correct in the rankings, also varies from realm to realm)
---
I get what you're saying on the first part. Im not one to attack, typically, and im sure many of those who embody those guilds are nice people. But that's also where most of the dickheads are. They take the game so seriously that they take the fun out of it. People should be allowed to play the game as they choose without being reprimanded by metalords that think the game is only playable one way.
---
Pretty damn close yeah. WAY better than the rest of the classes you didnt mention. Unless you just plain suck ofc.
---
Other way around. Once you're friendly horde can  buff you
---
I've seen it twice and we just killed them all. Was a fun game actually, the Alliance fought back everywhere, yet still failed across the board.
---
How did you have time to get out there? I can barely get the window closed before the prompt to enter comes up
---
Lol, hunters and warlocks dont even use their pets to tank anything when soloing dungeons. Just goes to show how little you know. Rogues do not get the short end of the stick at all. I have several rogue friends who make an average of 40-50g per hour pick pocketing BRD. And you can herb better than any other class due to stealth, distract, sap and vanish. Its you that are crap at farming gold, not the class.
---
0
---
Source material is extremely nsfw if people are interested.
---
Razorgore?
---
I was asking the same. 
---
Also: How many AVs does it take to get exalted?
---
After my first 2 AVs I still had 0 HKs. The meta appears to have changed now but it was easy to miss 15 by only playing a few games.
---
rep will come no matter what.. play to win
---
&gt;We now have a blacksmithing warlock
---
Well, at least he can get a fear immunity trinket now from Mithril order questline.
---
Climbing up the hill to IW is strongly in Hordes favour. FW defence is in our favour, even the IB GY area is Horde favoured. Once IW is down, thats 2 towers to 0, and will only end up with an Alliance defeat.
---
i haven't zerged at all and have tried to forced a turtle in every match i've played.
---
"Don't know their history" hahaha, ok boomer
---
To be fair you you really did /who when you said you did it was around 3 AM server time. Sure, 21 people online total is low but most people play on sane hours during week days.

Just read through the replies here and I got to tell you, you've gotten some damn fine advice here. If you take these to heart and ask mages/hunters to follow you while waiting for the game to start, you can really make a huge difference. Divide and disrupt at Fields of Strife (you will likely need to split your forces early on to cover both east/west parts of the map as Allies can go either way), rez up and try to wipe their healers/DPS at Galv and then either recap a GY/tower or recall to base to hold ramp, and later, if needed, set up camp in the keep with Drek and the warmasters. Slow and Nova as much as possible when they come inside to pull anything in order to have them killed, and any healers who heal will also generate threat from Warmasters. If they pull several warmasters that well-timed CS on a healer can really turn the tables if 1-2 warmasters do their WW. 
---
And for any class; if you're in the doorway of the keep and a hunter sends their pet at you, you might be able to run into the keep and have warmasters all aggro the pet, and its owner. Note that if there is only 1 warmaster left, that will cause you to give them a free pull on him and likely take him down outside without much issue. 
---
Learn how to stall and defend against the Alliance, and you'll be one of the absolute MVPs. 
---
Horde can't really win without defense unless allies are complete crap, and with the longer queue times it makes sense to drag out the games a little bit (say 20-25 min) so you can farm some honor, kill captains/lieutenants and do some turn-ins before snatching the win granted by good offense and a small, strong defensive force. If we meet on the battlefield, I will lend you my totems and heals - see you in the Keep.
---
No that would be sweet though.  It isnt a weappn
---
Wait... you’re saying the guy who’s paying $25 to save himself hundreds of hours of work is special? I mean don’t get me wrong, people who do rank 14 are crazy... but if you’re going to do it that’s literally saving you hundreds of hours for 25 bucks.
---
I've prob done about 100-ish, but as horde, the rep was slower than alliance. 
---
bit of advice, loot the bodies of opposition players and hearth back and hand in the armor scraps/blood etc. it gets good rep too.
---
Nope, anyone level 10+ can achieve pvp ranks.
---
yes, already exalted but stuck at work, so wasnt sure if I can just fly out to Tarrenmill and buy the mount or whether I need to get to Org to get wolf riding 1st ;)
---
awesome, thats what I was hoping for! Thanks for confirming.
---
Aha I see, so only epics then :)
---
Uh no. One of the best brd pickpocket videos that you can find out there, with stealth build and just 1 vanish resist, did 40g/hr. So chances that the resists kills you, are not low usually with our buggy vanish. Top farming method? lol
---
https://youtu.be/4DPcm0_SXzw
---
the video if u wanna check it :)
---
What, really? Going for 1-1.5k on my server
---
i have a "Kill the fucking druids" macro
---
no treesus on my games
---
Well yeah. But even at that hour there is usually hundreds of people online. You have nolifers, shift workers, people who are on holiday, sick leave. you name it. 21 people online is nothing, regardless of time of day. Which was my point
---
Does Gouge work? It should be an incapacitate rather than stun, and I'd imagine it does not count as a movement impairing effect (such as a slow).
---
Idk why reddit insists rogues are bad at gold farming. When you do it right you can pull of double the income mages pull. The keywords are devilsaurs (yes they are insane for gold still) mining, herbalism, angerforge carry runs. Pickpocket/coffer runs in BRD are OK but kinda random. You can also sell low level dungeon boost for gold and rare items. Yes your aoe is lackluster but you one-shot elites and have no resting time. Mages are faster for that, but you are good enough. Rogues are also the only class that can go treasure hunting in dungeons for chests (ok maybe druids can with lock blasters) altho this is very random, very fun tho. Also you can solo tyrs hand and crusader npcs but everyone can and again its random. Some general advice for gold farming is don't listen to the crowd, go out there and experiment. My private and best methods were discovered by searching through trade goods on the auction house, finding high market value items and checking DBs for farm locations.
---
I only see groups where the tank has reserved it, so I think in a way that's not that rare haha.
---
Bloodfang-EU?
---
Cross realm BGs did exist in Vanilla at the patch level we're mirroring.
---
I hear Herod, I upvote!
---
50/50
---
well reckoning did get nerfed, so i can't imagine it being very good for duels
---
The only reason to have tailoring is for your chest atm. If you want the bloodvine set from ZG you need tailoring in p4 but that's a long time from now. So you can just drop it and level it again in p4 if you need that set.
---
if you wanna be a prick, macro r1 dots and spread them like the plague.. keep pressure on healer mana. save your top rank dots for your actual target of choice.
---
hang out with mages and use curse of elements and spam imm/sp along side them
---
29 warriors are only playable on alliance since they have paladins.
---
I think you should review your maths skills.
---
It's 1 in 7828 for 1 person to roll that number.
---
Its much more higher for 2 person to roll the same number.
---
More like 1 in 100 000 000.
---
Do you still have to wait until the actual head on the spike disappears? Or it doesn't matter?
---
Naw they are doing some PVE in AV non stop. Game is fun.
---
They probably wont. They have paid transfers now. So people will pay to get to balanced servers, why would they stop that?
---
Hunter has approx. 0 gear competition though.
---
I like the rewriting of history: when it was announced that it was gonna be 1.12 and different phases, almost everybody agreed it was probably the best pragmatic solution. Of course there was a few people disappointed but people generally agreed that having druid unable to tank because of their awful armor coefficient was not very sexy and you saw almost no #nochanges post.
---
Now when people said: mmm with 1.12 talent PvE might be too easy and it might be a good idea to make content a bit harder.... #Nochanges!    When people argued that honor system was awful and a few fix were needed: #Nochanges!  One skeleton per player? #Nochanges!
---
My point is that #nochanges repeated their mantra brainlessly and totally ignored all the obvious problem of the game and now that it's obvious their last argument is: "but it's because there was some changes!"  to avoid thinking that maybe the game needed a few tweaks.
---
(end of the rant)
---
Did you just call hunters one of the worst pvp classes?
---
I can’t wait til you guys see what happens when a hunter gets an actually decent ranged weapon from raids. Holy shit
---
Is a chance, %, therefore, luck. Crusader or other farm methods had nothing to do with this. 
---
Maybe you could try again, because I never said that it was the worst. But I guess the gold you get from it is not enough to buy glasses so you can read better. But is ok, I will repeat it for you: Is not top tier, is below Priest Hunter Mage Warlock. Just in the middle. 
---
Worst. Ah yes. yes. clap
---
Kids are playing exclusively Fortnite these days my dude. They don't care about a 16 years old MMO.
---
Jeez, people still think they have to mouse target an npc to interact? lol, so clueless.
---
Hello, I wrote that guide. If your referring to the downranking penalty such as the one mentioned [wowwiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Downranking) or [allakhazam](http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/spell_coefficient_(wow)), this was not put in to the game until TBC. The only one confirmed to exist in vanilla to my knowledge is the sub level 20 penalty. I also got help testing this quite rigorously thanks to Melderon during the Classic Beta, and could find no indication of any other downranking penalty.
---
\+1 for PvE, +2 for PvP, +3 for Another Spe
---
so you want rank 14 epics for doing very little, You want Ranks updated daily, you honor as a currency again to buy easy epics, you dont want pugs meeting premades as you cant get a team of 10 together?!?!
---
Mate......retail is that way ---&gt;!
---
What is a death roll
---
I've heard you can get rep while dead. Do it on a lvl 19 twink.
---
well said Rotbant, you are 100% correct!
---
Not sure how that is relevant but it's only 1 in 100m if you're talking about consecutive attempts. In other words rolling 1 of 7828 twice in a row. (1/7828)^^^2
---
haha, as alliance this pleases me.
---
Screen shot is from retail. That is the high res face texture and the option to make your orc stand upright.
---
hahaha brilliant
---
Because he is horde.
---
It should be easy to gain ranks now as alliance...
---
Form a group that plans on re-running it multiple times. Ideally a guild group so people think twice before bailing.
---
Yes if you play with a good group. But if the tank knows what he is doing drek will be right up against the wall and this won't work.
---
I used to have the same problem on my main character. But not on my alts.
---
I tried everything, i delete and re-install the game a couple times, same thing.
---
I tried on another computer, same thing.
---
Seems that the problem is link to my account and my main character.
---
So I installed the neatplates addon, now everything works fine.
---
Please make this mobile background compatible
---
Boulderfist was the first server I started playing on!
---
&gt;is 52 not too low for BRD?
---
Only if you're going for emperor. Everything until Grim Guzzler is just fine, and it's like 2/3 of the dungeon.
---
[Blackout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15268/blackout), is it a % chance when cast or is it whenever shadow damage occurs? Say Shadow Word: Pain which gives damage every 3 second, is it then a % chance every 3 sec or only when the spell was cast?
---
With nameplate there's a original blizzard skin, it will resolve you problem and it's not gonna change the look of the plates.
---
The blunt reason is 'this is the way it was in classic' the other gear released later when the other raid/s were released.
---
I was trying to explain why they implemented it like that. Reasons could be:
---
1. They didn't have time
---
2. They thought 1 set of pvp epic gear was enough and then changed their minds
---
3. They felt that enough gear was out at the time of AVs release so they didn't want to include anything else
---
Omg r/nevertellmetheodds !!!
---
Lol
---
Unfortunately everyone in my guild seems to have it already, and in pugs half the group bails after every run :/
---
gnome&gt;all
---
i wish pala could be a gnome for that sweet escape artist
---
Our queues for the FR buff were [much more orderly](https://imgur.com/a/cj6ExW2).
---
outside the BGs entrance. 
---
For AV:- The official entry to the valley is in northern Hillsbrad. The Alliance entrance is due north of Southshore. You'll find the NPCs outside the cave entrance. 
---
For WSG:- The Alliance entrance is located in Silverwing Grove, southwest of Silverwing Outpost and Fallen Sky Lake in Ashenvale Forest, again the NPCs selling the gear is outside.
---
A bit like Chernobyl tours...
---
&gt;Such high class fantasy
---
Wear a dress and heal. That's your class fantasy at lvl 60.
---
Kek
---
Very smart move !
---
Untill you realize you won't be prioritized because gear would go to the hunters actually doing damage. 
---
#1 you get to brainlessly spam wing clip,
---
#2 you get no reward for doing that.
---
Looks like a trap to me!
---
Is bgPvP only decent when you're at x9 levels? I joined a BG the other day with a friend and everybody was at the x9 level meaning me and a friend in the lower levels of the brackets were being stomped...
---
Because they didn't in vanilla. Having said that, certain PServers made trees have collision and it was glorious. Obviously small indie companies like Blizz can't afford to do this though.
---
Least. Still dependent. 
---
Maybe answer the OP in a different post then? 
---
Thanks for encouraging me to try again, you sure made a difference! People has to love you at parties :D

Dwarf priests, saving Azeroth since 2005

This dude strangely looks like my spirit animal...
---
TrinketMenu for sure
---
Definately less than before, don’t have a number to compare with but I did a scan yesterday and I think it was around 14500 auctions currently on AH.
---
All sets are DPS-oriented. Shadow priest, ret pally, etc... R14 set is pretty much BiS forever for ret pally. For a warrior, it's BiS tanking set and very close to BiS DPS set until Naxx.
---
You can knock everything, even your own teammates.
---
Why will it be only for a month?
---
Hunters can do solo jump runs aswell. I do them on my hunter if I don't feel like respeccing for tribute runs.
---
What are the best looking shoes for a lvl 35 bank alt?
---
I am looking for shoes and not big boots which is how most of the items in the slot look. The only shoes I know of are "Frayed Shoes" but those are mildly annoying to get so I am wondering are there any alternative.

I got this exact drop first live run. Won em all too (well as an ele shaman anyways)
---
Dodge is an awful stat for warrior tanks. But I think OP is referring to the awful model that is male NE.
---
Weird. I use the default aswell and it works like a charm.
---
Had a deathroll where we got stuck on 2 on like 7 rolls, ofc i lost in the end
---
Any idea how they are gathering the data? Looking through the site to try and find methodology
---
Levelled a hunter
---
No you are just a whiny kid. Crying about rogues having a bad gold farm, when they really dont.
---
I like to reel them in when I lose. They think they can’t miss and then boom, they lose a 600g roll and they start logging in alts to try to win.
---
Yeah, you guys don’t know how to gamble. I wouldn’t waste my time with 5g bets.
---
Which addons you using for the hits and the other stuff to appear in middle of your screen?
---
I've never won a roll on an MC/ony drop. 0 out of 19 so far. So there's that
---
A lot of East Coast guys get off work and raid with us.
---
Damn your brother is really good! That looks awesome!
---
You are doing something wrong with BRD. [This](https://i.imgur.com/ut589wf.png) includes plenty of deaths where I fuck up. If you optimize you can do way better. Not the best GPH but hardly the worst class for farming.
---
Haha am actually horde😄
---
TIL gnomes only have 4 fingers...
---
...after all these years.
---
Its a really good weapon for FC druid. You can always swap from/to 1h offhand when they are ready/needed.
---
pretty easy to get rank 14 on there im guessing, especially since cross realm BGs.
---
These are known as Twinks. The PvP brackets go from x0 to x9 through to 60. So people level up to the 9th level, get the best ‘twink’ gear they can get and stop gaining XP.
---
May I ask where you've got those rules from? I don't say it's nonexistent, I just can't find them anywhere.
---
Once naxx is out, hunters (&amp; mages) can solo farm some naxx trashmobs to sell trash bop's to furys, ferals, rogues, rets and ele shamans for insane amounts.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/QMbtc8kfzKaWp2y6#boss=-3&amp;start=14894&amp;end=1657921&amp;type=damage-done
---
Its not even close, look at the top horde speedrun, all the warriors doing top damage are dual wielding, and almost none of them have a ony 2hander.
---
Thanks for be terribly wrong.
---
I see, thanks. I'll take your word for it but couldn't touch of weakness count as a cast as when it hits you it's always new (renewed/reset). While blackout is cast and then not renewed/reset the same way as touch of weakness is.  Just being "thorough" as the wording in blackout got me confused. " Gives your Shadow damage **SPELLS** a 2% chance to stun the target for 3 sec. " As if it's the spells and not the damage that does it.
---
If only it wasn't the most bugged spell in the game.. "Unlimited range" but getting invalid target on people not in your zone. And half the time it fizzles and keeps camera on myself while channeling it. And grounding totem makes shamans party permanently immune to it since it grounds the spell without triggering totem cd.
---
Why wouldn't horde transfer off now that they can?
---
Lol pve
---
It does not
---
LOL yeah good luck with that
---
All blizzard needs to do is this:
---
1) Query all characters that have used click-to-move for the majority of their playing time
---
2) Review their logs which will obviously show they are botting
---
3) Suspend their accounts for suspicious behavior
---
If they did this on a weekly basis botters would be significantly hindered. The reason the botters do this is because Blizz waits 2-3 months to issue a ban, which is about $900ish to the botter per character. For as long as it's profitable for them to do this they will continue doing it
---
Fishing bots are brain-dead easy to catch and Blizz should be embarrassed that for 2 months I've watched obvious fishing bots drive down the price of Oily Blackmouth, when any GM with 2 minutes of effort could roam the world and discover them
---
\+1 Greatwizard's channel is ace.
---
And then there's that guild that popped head an hour early and went to do onyxia. Many laughs were had on discord that day.
---
Could you tell me what the incentive is for the healer being there if he/she can't roll on the trinket?
---
At least from a Shaman's perspective, it is the one and only reason to join for a Jed/Rend run.
---
I'm Alliance on ZT. There is some WPVP still left. Alterac Mountains outside the AV entrance for example.
---
Snowball isn't just a flavor consumable.
---
Just because you're shit at the game and can't aoe grind doesn't mean everyone is LOL
---
Just started levelling my fishing lol. Also scout the AH for cheap meat to cook and sell or just use. Keep an eye on twink items and high level ‘of shadow wrath’ gear. 
---
Failing that run outside org and duel ppl
---
Agree, it's because mostly the alliance don't have to organise that well to win.  And because of insta queue, if they lose they just get another game pretty fast anyway.  As a result the incentive is stronger on horde to play together and try to win than it is on alliance.
---
Always one, go back to your cave dude
---
Fly to Felwood and farm herbs. Q's on my server are like 40mins though.
---
You stop getting rep from certain things when you hit revered so you need tokens to get exalted.
---
Alliance  only though...  the mobs in the one  on horde side has immolation aura
---
Twinks do not gain XP, that is the point of a twink. When you get to x9 you avoid as much XP as you can.   
---
They gain honor, and BG tokens.
---
L2p lol. But actually tho...
---
We are?  Did like 20 AVs yesterday in peak time and lost one.
---
This is the type of stuff that is directly affected by server size and needs to be adjusted accordingly.
---
How could we know which Information is reliable if we don't know what Information is true?
---
Nobody can say whether one or another site is more accurate currently.
---
Just compare Wowpop Wowpopulation and Wowhead and Ironforge.pro and see which Server has the best average on all Websites :D
---
Isn’t this kind of an exploit?
---
Netflix
---
Yea used to do that as well, personally I actually popped mine at 1am, first guildy at 7am, then 1pm and then 7pm before raid time. However, it doesn't really seem necessary to do it like that on our server (semi high pop).
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/Ek6jgeF.png](https://i.imgur.com/Ek6jgeF.png) you rn
---
How do you death roll? I keep hearing people talk about it.
---
Horde flocked to our server thinking it would be balanced for them but less Alliance came.
---
People playing together in an mmorpg? B-brrrrrokenn
---
No Book of the Dead? Fail!
---
So do ppl still not know why gambling is bad?Never deathrolled ,never will
---
Just as a healer who ran this countless of times before winning it, I'd probably charge some 150g for not rolling on it. You yourself know how annoying it is to farm for!
---
Man looking at your post history is a gallery of elitism my lord. Flexing on people on reddit is so cringe dude.
---
Now it’s all about the  boring zerg fest PVE AV
---
I am a feral tank druid, and I am using it for FR Gear, like for tanking Geddon where you basically only take fire damage. And for PvP I am sometimes switching to it too, when running away and have to regenerate mana...
---
Lmao!!!! love it!!!
---
I'm working on a script with HotkeyNet that can help me with my honor goals in AV. Basically i'm planning to make a script that i run from my work computer that send keystrokes to my other PC where i'm running WoW. The plan is that every keypress A-Z from my work PC will do something on my WoW character so i don't go afk and and hopefully run blindly forward so there is less of a chance to be reported afk. It wouldn't be botting, since i am technically pressing a key for each action. My question is; is moving the mouse around with a script considered botting? i won't be clicking, just moving it to a specific place on the screen and then execute the clicks on the next keyboard action.

Back in Legion I used to make gold by vendoring the water I bought from the vendor in Dalaran.

Also, absolutely delusional to think BRE isn't the best 2h fury weapon until MOM. Checkout Zulpi doing this as an alliance gnome warrior.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mbb works in classic for me at least.
---
From experience joining other guilds pugs it's often slowdown when doing trash, and killing unecessary trash.  
---
And stopping to do loot.
---
cos by the time you've run 80 odd AV's I was happy I had line 40 tokens to turn in, which covered the last 2-3K of Rep needed. 
---
Also, folk have suggested you get less rep once revered as you do during the game.  
---
I know for me, I was happy to have so many to turn in, rather than run 4-5-6 more AVs that night, to allow me to go get the easy epics and epic mount. :D
---
this happened to me aswell, try logging out and back in, was alive when i logged in again
---
They stack, but after 308 (I think 308 is the magic number), there are heavy diminishing returns.
---
Pickpocketing is LITERALLY free gold.... sure it's not the best GPH out of some other classes, but once you get good at it, you could can pretty much do it afk. No other classes have any other gold farming method thats more easier than rogues...
---
I've bought everything I need as a rogue through pickpocketing (regular/epic mounts, prebis gear, consumables, AV gear, etc.) It just sounds like you're lazy to me
---
Yup. Literally just got knocked off the bridge into the Alliance base in my last AV by a fellow Horde. Sat at the beginning of the bridge and watched her kill 2 other Horde with it and get like 3 others off the edge without deaths. Was hysterical.
---
I almost never spend money so it’s actually a bit of a drain. Well I lied I actually buy vodka and stuff, but I still do so while playing WoW, so it’s just an extra cost.
---
Cry your days away on Reddit ;)
---
Internet
---
Fish, farm consumables or crafting materials or finish off nearby stray quests - or better yet, take a break and do some cleaning, food prep or do some pushups, X-jumps or dumbbell lifts. I'd need to get myself some wireless headphones though, as now I'm running to the PC now and then to check that I don't miss the invite.
---
It got destroyed by the way it was designed in Vanilla. It has serious inherit flaws which naturally lead to the situation we have today.
---
The only reason this wasn't as obvious when it first was introduced without BG's 15 years ago was that everyone was damn new and didn't know how to effectively play the system.
---
Priest &amp; mage in insane. You can start aoe farming at lvl ~22.
---
And this is why I'm a Tauren warrior. Look like a fuckin boss.
---
eesh dude. you won this one for sure
---
308 is a lot Better than 305
---
As a player of Harod. I wish more alliance players would do this strat. I'm sick of the "zerg drek" or galv drek. PLAY THE OBJECTIVES. Towers, proper graveyard capping. DEFEND FUCKING FROSTWOLF YOU MOTHER FUCKERS.
---
And why are we pulling warmasters without a southern graveyard.... Especially since we like to big dick pull the whole room and wipe the push.
---
We had a lvl 1 trying to start death rolls on our server last night, he got shut down rapido.
---
MSBT
---
Need 300 in the pool for bracket 1 to be available
---
“Brd is very bad gold per hour unless you get really lucky”
---
Those are your words. Im glad we went from “really lucky” to “least dependant”. The difference i made was confronting misinformation. If you would like to get more informed on the subject, i highly suggest joining the wow classic rogue discord server.
---
Also try avoiding personal banter when you are having a discussion. I havent called you out once, but you deemed it to be reasonable to make fun of my eyesight and my personality.
---
Ignoring the fact that what you're considering doing is straight up *wrong*, I've heard of programs like AHK being detected as botting software when used in a legitimate context, like multiboxing.
---
Let me ask you... if you were home and 10 people in your AV were off running into walls pressing keys from work without any thought, would you be happy?
---
What the fuck just what?
---
Tomorrow morning I will log on and give 50g to anyone that can stand where we stand. #GrobMobFoLife
---
Raiding every week and still getting no loot as dps warrior I cant wait for BWL for moore loot!
---
If you cast it in advance of totem going down it does nothing when they try and drop it after.
---
The money I save goes to ordering food to maximize wow time.
---
This. Yes.
---
I bet you're the dude that sits on classic reddit all day and downvotes stuff
---
Is this because you’re all gathered there? Nothing to do with the buff?
---
Without giving too much information, I used AHK to anti afk for the first couple of months of classic due to server queues(playing on one of the highest pop ones). I haven't had any warnings or bans despite using it a ton. But I won't use it for AV, just used it to be able to actually play the game lol
---
110% drop! Nice!
---
I thought I'd be screwed if I lost a 100g deathroll. 10000?
---
Hey we recreated Home Alone in time for Christmas
---
Too many people transferred to your faction, this is the result of overpopulation: you have mentioned it yourself. Balanced server with population of yours is fine since people aren't gathered in one capital, but your server is heavily one-sided.
---
Thats not vanilla, thats a tauren.
---
PS: jokes aside, awesome pic.
---
Played full time in private servers for nearly past 3-4 years before launch. Got my main to 60 in 10 IRL days (well i was grinding for gear the last few days, could have gotten to 60 slightly faster). Im doing multiboxing, this is where i had problems. Got bit burned out and have been taking breaks from it. Atm L49 warrior, L48 priest, 2xmages and warlock.
---
But in the past 1-2 weeks or so i got my mojo back. Im broke as fuck on my raiding main (high end raiding guild, normal raids in the sub 40min MC clears), so need to get some gold and finally my group starts to work as i want them to. Im sure if i just done quests etc i would be better off, but i wanted to test out AOE grinding in instances. I was struggling in SM, now finally doing ZF it starts to work out. I still slowly work myself to scarabs and do more pulls on the tombs than i should, but atleast im making progress in XP and somewhat decent gold/hour. I think hitting L50 is the magic mark there, new ranks on heals+shields. Another nice boost coming in L54 with new arcane explosion and hellfire ranks.

When i get near to 60 and can start getting proper gold grind going, ill start another group. I wanna get the last 3 classes im missing going. Meaning Rogue, Hunter and Druid. Maybe 2 different groups. One with 2 druids+3 rogues, a stealth 5man group. And another 5man hunter team for super simple levelup since it doesnt require any "multibox" setup thinking.
---
Love those
---
The whole point of raiding on reset is to stack resets and avoid respec costs. Kinda pointless if your suggestion is to play on a different day
---
Well that depends if you do it to earn/lose gold, or just for fun while you are doing something with a friend, I guess
---
FeelsGoodMan
---
s-spwit runs.... hahahaha.
---
First of all, imagine being such a fucker loser as to rank for the gear and not for the pvp/drama/experience. Secondly, the pvp weapons are BiS so you can split raid all you fucking want except if you're gunna compete with r14 rogues/warriors ur gunna have to scroll a long fucking way to find urself on the damage meters. Go back to retail kid you obv have no idea wtf ur talkin about
---
so non existent?
---
Ne look awesome in armor
---
I've always found that playing WoW decreases how much money I spend overall. Though I am starting to, finally, get the itch to get out of the house and do something more productive with my life. I'm sure this impulse will pass in time, however.
---
&lt;Leftovers&gt; has 350+ members IIRC, there should be enough players.  
---
NOTE: &lt;Leftovers&gt; is the only active Alliance guild here.
---
Entirety of jump runs is dependant on getting Arcane Crystals/books for it to be better off than tribute runs.
---
Raw gold p/hr Tribute is better than jump. Rng per hour, no idea. I once got 4 crystals in 5 resets under the hour timer, then I went 26 clears before another crystal.
---
What? Mageblade has 2 more int. 4 mp5 is also extremely insignificate for mages/locks. So I would argue mageblade is technically better, but they are basically the same thing either way
---
Easiest way to get it (if you're on horde and smolderweb) is to invite me to your group. I am the briarwood luck charm. I've only done ubrs 5 times without it dropping....meanwhile no MH for my rogue. I've done this dungeon around 50 times. Legit that thing always drops. I guarantee when my Warlock hits 60, it'll never drop for me lol
---
Thats a regular horde game for me there. we do all this while aliance try to zerg, resulting in sweet wins.
---
&gt;But its a 40v40 BG, so i assume that the other faction has an equal amount of leachers as well, so fuck it
---
You are justifying your leeching behavior based on an assumption that there are equal amounts of jerks on both teams. Assumptions are generally bad as they are just that - assumptions - and you're essentially wasting other peoples' time with this. I know that chances are not as great as they could be, but I hope you get banned if you do this.
---
Ya but they do leave out how around 40% of the time a mob resists forcing you to reset, then mopbs break out of ice nova early etc. Very rarely does it go perfectly to plan.
---
Negative. If you truly play both specs equally, my advice would be to enchant it with 30 SP. That 30 SP will also give 30 bonus healing, but that 55 bonus healing provides 0 spell power.
---
Move to the other side of the flag
---
nice UI
---
Yeah my warlock with 4k hp wants a word with rok' hunters who multshot crits me for 1.6k whilst their pet is wailing on me and they're critting 400-500 auto shots.
---
It’s only a hattori hanzo original
---
It doesn't really matter too much now. After BGs came out we barely have any contact with the opposite faction anymore. At most it's another raid getting their DM buffs or going for onyxia.
---
It’s not about need - some just like to chase parses:)
---
Can hunters sell the tribute loot AFTER they've cleared the instance?
---
24h per one only??
---
The stats on real gloves are more dps than the extra glancing dmg.
---
Horde did a great job on this server
---
The point of it is that some items require a snowball to activate them.
---
I think 170 should be enough, depending on how it does rounding.
---
Mind you, it needs to be active players (15+ HKs), and if most of them are still leveling I would imagine that's the case for everyone.
---
And we don't know how many transferred off this week.
---
Horde is still there.
---
Horde has about 17 mins queue time atm and it is rising by the day.
---
Unfortunately the BRD eye-pull has bee nfixed, so it might be really hard to get a spellcleave group considering warlock in the group is just getting carried.
---
I did a lot of world pvp in phase 1 and it was more authentic than in phase 2 where everyone was just farming honor. Are you saying you never did any pvp while leveling or before phase 2?
---
Find rogues/warriors who are still desperately trying to farm the Dal'Rends swords and do Jed/Rend runs with them. The trick is the healers, as they need very little out of UBRS. I've found a mix of bribery and favor trading amongst guildies/friends is the best way to acquire their aid. Otherwise, you may have to grab fresh 60s, which can work as long as you have them stay back and in a corner (so they don't get interrupted/knocked back into whelps) and the tank is somewhat geared/experienced (doesn't have to be raid geared, just not DW tanking in leather).
---
Second, and other people have already mentioned this, but you'll need to "fish" for an ID with Jed in it. You can do this 5 times an hour, and I rarely see people go through all 5 without finding him. I do not know how to do this, as I'm a warrior, but I believe you can get close enough to where he spawns to /target him without fighting any mobs. Just look up a video or somesuch.
---
Kind enough to give an explanation?
---
Its not about caring about internet points, you have been here 8 months discussing and people dislike what you say, why are you still here? Its like beeing a room where nobody likes you and you just stick around making it akward. 
---
Ps. if you dont care about imaginary internet points, why did u downvote my comment u dumb twat hahahahahaha
---
I'm not justifying it, i know i'm an asshole for doing it, but i don't think it is that bad, so i'm doing it anyway.
---
I said yes to this question in my head without even reading the latptop specs.
---
Anything can run wow
---
being on top of the tree is even cooler, test your MIGHT!!
---
Why can you join WSG as a group and not AV if AV is meant to be premade?
---
Just queue at the same time with your horde friends too?
---
So are you saying there is not a way to form a premade AV? Do you even play the game mate?
---
I havent gotten an Arcane Crystal in 3 months with 2 lvl 60's that both have 300 mining, granted I didnt farm much, but still...
---
Also they still didnt fix rich thorium veins, they are still always only 2-3x mineable, I think I had exactly 2 rich thorium veins in my entire playtime that were mineable 4x. I planned to stock up on a bunch of Arcane crystals before I'd eventually drop mining for a second crafting profession, but honestly fk that.
---
You are correct. I believe it provides 242 AP. I believe the point would be to spike down targets by stacking damage buffs.
---
Where is bfd? I know where rfd is.
---
Yesterday on Gehennas, it took 30mins+ easy to get ony buff going. It took like 3 minutes between the NPC's two shout lines just before the buff is supposed to go out. Had warchiefs buff run down from 50mins+ to under 20mins just waiting the ony buff to work. 
---
You couldnt use vendors, mailbox, trade.. anything in that time.
---
like threath-dump abilities or shields for warriors!
---
Nice!I see only heroes here. Why didn't dwarf bandage himself?
---
Okay exploit is maybe too strong of a word, but its still cheesing something that wasnt originally the purpose. I mean if people were SUPPOSED to be allowed to join as groups, why isnt there a "join as a group" option like WSG has and AB will?
---
Earthshaker is probably the most balanced high pop realm out there, maybe even slightly horde favored judging by the numbers at world bosses
---
My tanks would be quite upset if I used demo shout and thunder clap without them requesting it. They already have a hard enough time getting enough rage as it is.
---
But props on you for providing it. Definitely should come from a fury warrior rather than a tank, who needs to use his rage for threat.
---
So you can keep doing it.
---
Any other places where ele can solo for some gold/ele gears?
---
I rolled a PvP realm just for PvP while levelling, I knew once BGs hit I wouldnt bother so thats why I didnt transfer away from FL when all the Alliance left. We have a resource rich world with no competition, it makes travelling to raids with buffs easier and I can still sit in AV/WSG all day and do PvP, I literally see no downside in staying.
---
I smell salt on the breeze
---
You have to use the tree to get here in the first place. The tree is only the beginning test YOUR MIGHT!
---
Oh im sorry im not a nerd spending every single day on reddit, is that something you are proud about? Besides its not a 9 day old comment, its a 9 day old thread that you are also answering to.
---
Not the sharpest tool in the shed ey? :D :D :D
---
Oh.  My.  God.
---
Two times today when pvping horde, at low health they would just disappear and I’d get no honor, last I saw was their running animation, as if they vanished. Both times was mages.
---
1.	It wasn’t blink
---
2.	it wasn’t vanishing engi trinket because the 2nd has guards on him and it no longer takes you out of combat as of 2 patches ago 
---
How are these horde disappearing the moment they’re about to lose a battle?
---
Consecration is not that useful in pvp, it basically has three use-cases
---
1) Against rogues: you suspect a rogue is nearby, you throw down a consec rank 1. It won't protect you from a competent rogue opening up on you, the radius is too small, but it may cause mediocre rogues to make an error. You can laso consec in fight to prevent the rogue from vanishing in front of you.
---
2) Several horde try to cap a flag, you throw down a consec to interrupt them all (only the first tick interrupts).
---
3) in mass battles. Consec deals considerable damage over its duration, so in mass battles you can do a lot of damage, if the enemy is forced to remain in your consec. In duels and small scale battles, consec is rarely good enough to be worth the mana
---
What would be the absolute most mindless class and setup to level a character to level 35 while watching a movie? Does one key macros for hunters still exist?  I might consider leveling one just to get another transmuter on my setup.
---
Yeah, most of the horde leave anyone in The Leftovers guild to get on with the game and don't harrass them, however there are a few members in the guild who do get killed since they have been known to farm low levels but then cry "Horde on this realm always gank me, I thought we had a truce!"
---
I'm leveling a mage as an alt and I absolutely love it. Its the convenience class. You have so many luxuries. Unbreakable CC, mobility, teleporting to any capital city instantly, portals at 4O, and a never ending supply of food and water? 
---
Its the good life. Makes playing my 60 warrior feel like a chore. So slow!
---
Also, you will never hurt for money.
---
This whole drama around the ony head is so pointless- you can complete mc just fine with undergeared people who know what theyre doing. On dreadmist, people have gone as far as to turn one in at 2pm to reserve the buff for the 8pm raid, stopping people accidentally/deliberately "ruining the raid" for others
---
ok
---
We've had so many viskags that even our tanks have them for OS
---
No, natural.  Every encounter was fraught with uncertainty.  Are they going to attack?  Will they wave back if I wave?  Is there another enemy around this corner?
---
Phase 1 was what early world PvP was like back in Vanilla.  As soon as Honour became a thing the playerbase morphed it into spreadsheet farming.
---
Jesus christ, just go to the toilet to piss like normal people
---
All buffs generate threat both on application and refresh in classic
---
yes mate! you on there?
---
You want long games with all the handins, but if the ally pre-made decides to zerg there's really little hope for a pug Horde to stop them.
---
As if there are any lol
---
How do you distinguish who gets loot if NOT by how they perform and how much time they spend to do well in raids? A person who gets all their world buffs and hence does more dps SHOULD be given loot over someone who does not... I'm not saying the other person shouldn't get loot at all, but I sure as hell would not prioritize him. If that's how the wants to play he should join another guild then.
---
The RNG gods must hate you.
---
Die before garr? Why?
---
its only kids that have that time limit but i dunno if its even enforced on every game.
---
Trash near Geddon...alot of glass canons with near to 3k hp,  one shooted by mobs fireballs,  so agree
---
Not a lot of people are willing to suffer that grind for something that's better optimized but the same ilvl.
---
Any decently high pop server will have horde rankers ganking in WPL / EPL / felwood / searing / burning steppes. So just roll ally and go there.
---
Serious time, as in 10-15 minutes at best.
---
From 1.5-2 hours thats not really much.
---
It's a level 60 (not grey) mob so there wouldn't be a DHK regardless.
---
If you want to PVP mostly, I would still take imp wing clip. If a warrior charges you + hamstring and your improved wing clip procs you can trinket, create distance between yourself and said warrior an kite him to death. Provided the situation remains 1v1.
---
Hunter is certainly easy to level (with a tank pet), however if I personally was going for total brain dead mode, I would go Fire mage. Huge burst at range, drink. Go again.
---
Dont have any experience with hunters, but a warrior or paladin would be pretty mindless
---
Implying there are other raids you can run if you're a top end guild? Lmao
---
Cozy post :3 Keep enjoying the game I wish you best of luck \^\^
---
Ya bwl will be out soon
---
Join a guild with loot council.
---
Shame world pvp things come out in like p5 when players are disinterested.
---
Maybe not warrior, but pally I would agree with.
---
Because the content is as you say the only way guilds can compete is speed running.
---
In that case it's already both ways, bigger servers is not #nochange. Like he said, if you increase server size you need to adjust other factors (such as cooldown on Ony buff in this case).
---
[Yep](https://www.oglaf.com/age-confirmation/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oglaf.com%2Farchive%2F) still funny though
---
We run epgp, works well and noone complains. Not exactly the same though as dkp though.
---
Farm arathi elementals.
---
I second this I had an issue with sticking with a class until I played Druid. They are really fun to level and you can do any role in a group role while leveling.
---
https://youtu.be/jrJap2Kx-qs
---
Do you want to force the people there to stay and quit, or whats the option your proposing ?
---
So you escape because you lose to a majority, but you want to inflict the same shit to others by joining the majority on another server?
---
Donbeton is fucking goed!
---
F
---
My financial status certainly increased but my RL social activities decreased. Overall I am not sure if it's a win or loss.
---
The epic axe is actually not that sought after. Tried selling one and nobody wanted to pay more than 200g.
---
The highest ranking Horde mage on my Server on Horde side seems to Queue in UC and then go to Hillsbrad to camp the alliance alterac vendor. 
---
At least I guess he is doing that otherwise I wouldn't understand why he is constantly there when he could be queuing AV :P
---
Only thing it might affect will be AQ opening, since you need the war effort done on both sides. Assuming no alliance contributions at all, you'll end up being 3 months late to AQ.
---
Its only boring if you make it so, im having a lot of fun pvping in av
---
How nice of you to judge that this game is not for him. Is it not for him just because he can only play a couple hours a week or that he enjoys the journey to 60 instead of rushing it asap. 
---
As long as he's enjoying the game, it's for him.
---
Exactly
---
watch adult entertainment on the Adult EntertainmentHub
---
Bit surprised this isn’t being banned since casinos were banned back in vanilla.
---
Woah getting crits melts enemies, who knew. If I crit shadowbolt, conflag and shadowburn I can also literally kill any 5k hp target in 3 gcd's, but that's the perfect scenario.
---
Stubbornness and sometimes just for the hell of it. I COULD go continue genociding the furbolg race for that yummy firewater to throw on the AH. I COULD tank dungeons for cash/drops to vendor.
---
But sometimes I'm bored of those things, so I think "Hell, let's actually farm *insertitemnamehere*, just for a change of pace."
---
every server during wpvp was terrible
---
I would leave after first gank,  if those pricks don't want buff,  then be it
---
Do you use Elvui? This was happening to me and updating to the newest Elvui fixed it.
---
Shamans can’t use swords though?
---
I was in bracket 11 last week, so I will get there eventually..
---
You can't even type proper english, wtf
---
If you want to play solo then hunter, warlock, or mage are better suited to it. Leveling as ten dependent classes can be rough.
---
 However if you are serious about raids then healer is a great idea. Be prepared, the level 60 gear grind is a bitch. You will need to spam dungeons for weeks to get yourself in a position where a guild might take an interest in recruiting you. 
---
I was not warned about just how much work I would have to do post 60 and I really wish someone had warned me. I would have just avoided raiding entirely. The gear grind is like a part time job that didn't pay, it's fucking brutal.
---
NEVER TELL ME THE O— oh, actually, that’s not bad. Yeah, let’s keep going!
---
It has everything to do with what you said. Horde is not getting 400k a day ( nor is alliance i  fact because its physically impossible) . It doesnt matter however if no horde is getting that much honor because they dont need that much honor to hit r14. If all you wanted to say " no horde blablabla, period. I ask you " so fucking what?"
---
A rogue in my guild just passed his 150th run for HoJ. He's seen it drops once and he lost it to a meme specc shaman
---
Biggest argument in favor of hunter imo. I main lock and having to always be aware of your stock of shards gets tiresome.
---
One of the most vocal "no don't leave, Flamelash will be great" idiots who willingly passed on free transfer (and made others do so as well) has now quit the game. Well done dude.
---
We use Suicide Kings: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Suicide_Kings
---
We have 3 lists, 1) Weapons/Trinkets 2) Tier 3) Non-Tier
---
All handled by the add-on, KonferSK.
---
Hunters with are gonna hit clothies hard as... meanwhile geared warlock one set of DoTs on a hunter spells imminent fatality. Quick fights either way, oh and viper sting / max range OP.
---
Think I've faced you guys as a horde. Easily the best AV games I've been in!
---
&gt;and weirdly there's less hunters than warlocks in Classic.
---
Definitely not the case on my server. If you see a guild recruitment ad they're almost always looking for a warlock.
---
This is on Horde?
---
This highly depends on the quality of your opponents and your gear. Ambush + backstab is great when you can 1-shot a clothie or cause them to panic and make mistakes. But if you're facing a seasoned pvper, especially one who is geared appropriately (aka, stacking stam), then the ambush will be inconvenient, but ultimately meaningless. Better in these cases to stun lock your opponent and use all the control options that rogues bring.
---
In the end, though, both styles can and do work. Honestly, I love the rogue class. There's just so many different options for how to handle encounters, both pvp and pve. Really makes the class interesting.
---
This is just player to player
---
I have farmed SGC on my warrior, that was a pain in the ass. But the thing about the necklace is that it has 17% dropchance or whatever, its weird i havent seen it. Atleast farming HoJ or SGC u know its rare that its drop. But i feel for the rogue lol
---
Yep I'm horde there quite a few active guilds you'll have no issue finding a guild
---
Snus + wow vs smoking, could argue it smells less but an unwashed teenager really doesn't smell very well either haha.
---
&gt;hardcore players, who are the core player base

Lmao, imagine being this clueless

Heres a tip, raid on another day.
---
For a lot of people completing the raid is not the objective. Completing it quickly and efficiently is what they want to do, they're trying to improve on their times and co ordination. So for that you do want as many buffs as you can get.
---
Yeah but the wetlands run is iconic. It's fun in a masochistic sort of way.

&gt;ver 20 mins i see at
---
haha because its the dumbest thing you can ever do, trap the alliance longer, to get even longer queue times. Or make the experience even worse by turtle every game (giving no one an advantage), and getting more and more alliance people to never go av again, because horde plays like a shitfest.  
---
Most people go afk if they see horde turtle, or insta leave because its not worth the time.
---
Mograine is another good choice, lots of pugs every day and plenty of guilds looking to bolster rosters, mine included haha :D
---
Every week the casters fight to be in your group
---
I'm Horde but hard agree. Thunderfury is a great server, and server imbalance or not you Allies hand my ass to me all the time. Respect!
---
You say this but I've found as Horde I've been winning alot more as the week has gone on. For example I did AV 9 times last night and won 5 of them
---
Trying to trick newbies into starting behind I see
---
Oh cool i see, kinda assumed you needed 60
---
I say mage, priest and warlock maybe hunter.
---
Mages are always good especially in leveling with blizzard mass grind... pvp bombs.... 
---
Priest is fine with good wands and spirittab talent while leveling but also raid healer OP...
---
Warlock and hunter are both fun to level, while warlock has slightly more tools to help raid groups and dmg potential, hunter are usually even more fun to level and outplay in pvp or even do dungeons solo sometimes, but not exactly what every raid group desperately needs
---
I am currently in the same boat not sure what I should do. I have a 60 warrior with just about all my BiS until I can’t start raiding
---
seems like we're doing different jumpruns then
---
I jump down go hydrospawn - lethtendris - zevrim and reset, 4 sometimes 5 runs per hour is easy 50-100g raw + sometimes librams (I get 2 dusty tomes per run, never had anything else than pocket lint and the nat pagle book, got 2 forors total 1 from hydrospawn 1 from zevrim)
---
I dont have herbalism or mining
---
there are more than 250 on the realm
---
Only parry build that actually has any use is rogue riposte prep spec used for 2man tribute or well solo/duo'ing any other related dungeon content.
---
Just fly out to a high level questing zone and hunt down alliance to kill time. They are probobly ganking horde solo levelers anyway and deserve it.
---
You actually believe Boomkins are so bad that u cant progress in naxx &amp; AQ? It's proven that they can put out the dps required.
---
Yeah I’m not too sure what to do here, might just transfer to faerlina since there’s always people playing on that server. Idk
---
Definitely hunter. Can keybind send pet hunter marks auto attack and you can kill mobs off that basically. And it's also very fast.
---
Btw maybe if you take a step back, you'll realize why this respond is hypocritical of you but don't let it interrupt the foul mood you're in, I wouldn't want that.
---
Hey are you playing on ZT? I was in a raid with my guild yesterday where a rogue got the weapon. Not sure about the name though :)
---
Make sure to disable any overlays you may have enabled (like Discord or Xbox live stuff etc.)
---
Discord was causing me problems.
---
&lt;Reborn&gt; Firemaw EU is a late night raiding guild (22pm). Sent PM with Details.
---
You're... Mistaken. You never roll on your OWN number. You've got the concept of it wrong in 1v1 because that's not how it works even if you were to try and bastardize it in some weird way. You roll on each others numbers. Simple at that...
---
Apart from 30% of the level 60 population that also plays Hunter. 
---
Also, most of that stems from the fact that we aren't being considered for upgrades that are bigger upgrades for *anyone* else. 
---
In my guild, if a rogue has both proc-daggers from MC, he still gets CHT before hunters.
---
No, Noggenfrogger EU :)
---
Because I'm a holy paladin :D
---
It's a warrior, that's just his guild name
---
dominos
---
Why do have to look at it on CLASSIC WOW sub
---
&gt; but starting first is actually a downside because you can roll 1 in the first roll already.
---
But your rolls have a much smaller chance of losing, so it *is* an advantage to start.
---
You don't need the key to search for Jed. Look up a YouTube video how to ID him.
---
No, the server is fine before the buff procs.  No lag etc, but once it procs everything goes to shit for 10 mins.
---
Stop raiding on wednesday.
---
Adding to this, as you report these were Horde players - Horde currently have 9-15 minute AV queues (EU side), so it's quite probable that they were waiting for AV invites to pop and did some open world farming. Ample time to fly from OG to Winterspring, Felwood or Azshara from OG.
---
Why would you not want to make things as easy and as quick as possible though?
---
What do you mean by funding a kickstarter board game? Can u get revenue if it sells well? And what is your experience with investing in kickstartes? This caught my attention! Cheers
---
Yeah and because it's simple and more boring he suggest another method. It's not like your deathrolling is a holy method that can't be changed, I'd rather roll on my own number in 1v1 too, it's more exciting.
---
Run to AH and just farm the fire elementals. Easy 6g per and sometimes get 2-3 before my queue pops
---
The Argent Crusader is easier to acquire and will almost always be better as an 'Int weapon' than Finkle's Lava Dredger. For that matter, you could go with main hand + off-hand in a variety ways for an 'Int weapon' that work better. This also includes the impact of the mp5 on the Lava Dredger. It just isn't a very good weapon.
---
With the honor system, I wonder how quickly an high you could rank up with no completion.
---
Well then turtle AV enough for people to switch to WSG.
---
I did not bother checking out the link, but I don't see how something a website can do could possibly improve the quality and stability of your internet connection to any greater degree, unless the website in question is marketing better internet connections which you choose to buy.
---
neither details, nor recounts inflates numbers. it's a default setting which leads to different DPS numbers. but hey, who am i talking to. you know your stuff in details rofl
---
Also drop in a choke to make sure rogues can't sneak their way in. I.e. defending towers.
---
You just pay the creator and get game early 99% of case you dont get a share of company or sales
---
Enjoy 15 times longer queue to pvp than alliance side :()

Nearly the same I experienced, people just didn’t see the reason to PvP before honor.
---
omg oO is that also 25 euro in europe?
---
Lol wtf Kind of scum of the earth are you? xD
---
Just going around being a prick. You mother must be proud of you
---
that is because it\`s a pve server.
---
RFD as alliance...? u mad?
---
nobody does that, literally _nobody_
---
mages are the new hunters

Playing against Russians is like experiencing vanilla AV all over again. They do all the classic mistakes and play like vanilla players. Backpeddling, continued 1 man rushes into the 20 horde player push to die in 1 second and try again. Meanwhile, they will have 10 people chasing 1 guy all over the frozen lake for two minutes. It's hilarious to play against. They don't care about wasting time and are all about going to the nearest fight.
---
They don't get any meaningful honor and rep too, as they dont seem to kill the npc's.
---
The usual method is always just a 1 out of whatever to lose. Unless you get close to &lt;10 the rolling doesn't feel very meaningful. If you roll your own number every roll is important, you want to get higher numbers than your opponent, it kind of becomes a race.
---
Man, Flamelash really has it bad these days
---
cheapest fast mount is rank 11 mounts, i think they are around 80g.
---
No idea why almost everyone in this thread is shitting on Finkle's. It provides good stats for healing, pretty similar to the optimal phase 1 mainhand + off hand combination. Now with phase 2 + AV it is clearly worse than Lei of the Lifegiver + Aurastone/Fang of Mystics, but still by no means bad. People who say it's trash probably just know its not listed on BiS lists or w/e. It's also an efficient upgrade for any druid who still wears blue items in main + offhand.
---
Please delete this mods.
---
Had one drop in a duo jump run, we sold it for 380g. Would have loved it to sell for 1-1.5k ;\_;
---
That sounds really complicated lol. What's the point and who has the advantage?
---
Blackstone ring is something to look for, one of the earliest hit items you can get, drops off of princess in maraudon. Brigam girdle from UBRS is also very very good, as getting hit on belt is appreciated, also satyrs now from DM:E or Balckcrow from LBRS.
---
So.......fury
---
Some people have adopte.
---
World pvp was never about honor. Its always been just to flex on someone or to kill lowbies
---
Are there any good addons for tracking BG stats? Damage, healing, killing blows, etc. 
---
I’d like stats to look at while in queue too from the previous game
---
warlocks are pretty stres free
---
on high pop servers this is full 24/7
---
farm 10g and start over
---
Delete yourself
---
Really digging the embers.
---
Warlocks are one of the best solo classes for leveling, are needed in raids, and are one of the best classes for PvP (particularly 1v1)
---
Does it even work? I have a second account idling in one spot and I regularly tab over to it to jump a couple times, and it still gets disconnected regularly.
---
People tried to optimize back then.
---
People also managed to do it.
---
But that was a few out of the millions.
---
Nowadays you Google what you Need and have 234987230 guides on that and you just pick the first one.
---
Everyone is optimizing nowadays and actually understands the game...
---
It is not all on Blizzard :P They couldn't recreate the experience from back then. 
---
They had a lot of bad decisions but not only due to that the Feeling is different.
---
Even on 100% blizzlike private Servers it was different. It just never will be like that again except for when a new game release and then still you will have guides within days. 
---
The Internet happened... Can't Change that anyhow
---
It's a decent way to level a paladin because parry-haste is literally the only way you'll up your attacks per minute before reckoning.
---
Earthshaker is pretty sick tbh, its full pop, with a very balanced faction ratio but no queues.
---
are you somehow unaware that we are in the 1.12 patch version?
---
If that’s the case “redundant” isn’t really the right word though
---
Fishing, gathering herbs, farming Elemental Fire and demonic runes in Felwood. Gathering Night Dragons Breath and Whipper Roots. Watching YouTube or something om my second monitor. Cleaning the house or other chores that need to be done.
---
I so wanted a warrior but i dont have time to grind anything other than blue gear and we all know how that goes with that class...

Might go rogue or priest then...

20 20 20 hybrid spec.
---
So u came to whine about AV turtles in a fan-art post? :D
---
Better base, faster travel to enemy base, easier to cap towers, how much more do you need?
---
I think its more the amount of users they've allowed to save money on hardware..... The larger realms are definitely pushing the servers to the brink.  
---
Wait till AQ opens +/-50% of the server pop in one zone....

Laughs in mage

Didn’t crash or get laggy on private servers using shitty hardware bAsed on donations....

Instigate conflagrate congratulate.
---
Details doesn’t work in battlegrounds, in fact have yet to have a damage meter work in BGs.  Hence the point of the thread.
---
Y’all play on Grobbulus. Hello, my fellow hordies!
---
I'm more interested in what the Alliance AH looks like
---
&gt; Any problems with BG queues?
---
All BG ques are crossrealm, so it doesnt matter if theres any alliance in their server.
---
What class do you relate to the most? Like which ones fantasy interests you
---
Arms is better. If you like fury, go for it. But in most of the dungeons SS together with Cleave and WW is so better than Fury and a lot of fun. Much easier to tank dungeons too.
---
Cab always be made easier though?
---
Yes it is
---
Since im 305 weapon skill mace, using Truestrike, and Precision that roughly equates to 8%. So yes. I am human?
---
Base crit is sitting at about 25%

Don't worry it absolutely NEVER works in practice
---
Lucky to get unlucky

m8 what about them dwarves though
---
lol no

Do dishes, excercise a bit.

for AV you might as well just do a 31/20 MM/surv spec tbh. it's literally PvE

Use a time machine to got back 3 months ago when every body was doing nonstop rend/Jed runs

I think its rather fitting.
---
Before bgs, i couldnt even get into brm as ally.
---
I am a dick for saying this, but its soooo nice to see horde complaining now.
---
&gt;Pretty much this.  Leatrix Plus is the best addon for Classic.
---
Why you stealing my guild name!
---
Sincerely,
---
Squishytank GM of &lt;Nightshift&gt; sulfuras NA
---
By automatic logout you mean getting kicked to login screen with some error code?
---
&gt; There was also no guild that managed to clear MC until months into the game's lifecycle.
---
Which is a terrible comparison, as the MC we currently have is much easier compared to the initial version. Not to mention the improved gear, talents etc. that also helped make the content significantly easier. It also helps that everyone single mystery has been solved beforehand, which it wasn't when people first entered Molten Core. 
---
&gt; all while completely ignoring how much the overall playerskill has gone up in all those years, the amount of guilds clearing MC within a single raid day even withoit DM gear and the speed at which content gets consumed.
---
Just like you are completely ignoring that your comparison to the MC during release is absolutely flawed, since the entire setting is significantly different.
---
horde perspective, tbh I was one of those mages that said, let’s take 5 other mages and wipe the alliance at galv or by constantly porting back and suiciding into the alliance raid until all dead and before they get the last GY, it worked very well for like 3 days because we managed to get enough time for our 30 ppl rushing north to secure the win.
---
Now it’s 30 ppl defending and 10 ppl going north, wiping most of the time at SH GY and it turns into a 30+ minutes zerg because alliance pugs are willing to take that zerg now and horde is just zugzug let’s kill alliance, this is not what should have happened.
---
Well, we raid on tuesdays and wednesday in MC to have people max number of days when they can spec to PVP/Grinding etc.
---
&lt;Nightshift&gt; Sulfuras NA checking in. We raid 2330-0230 EST.

Two raid groups, same times.

Fri/Sat

Hit me up if you want more info!
---
If you don't like the meta, consider losing quick so the AV is quick again 😉
---
I think you missunderstood. Getting the buff takes 30mins+ in big horde EU servers. From turning in to when it actually does the buff. The server is lagged out beyond belief.
---
Actually there are and I left when they said that's the system they are using.
---
Zandalar Tribe EU. 55-45 alliance favor.
---
Many solutions
---
You could try the Monstrous Glaive from dm, it has tank-stats all over. Although its speed is a little weird, but you would probably want to use SoR anyway instead of SoC with a specific 2h/spd tank build.
---
I wouldnt think of using a 2hander for tanking in 5mans yet, although I do occasionally pull out Ravager for aoe pulls in strat or brd if I know the healer is up to it. Thanks to parry-haste Ravager usually procs very reliably the more mobs that are on me.
---
What are better threat move for tank then sunder?
---
Except shield slam/revenge?
---
More enemies to slay. Come to papa. #ZandalarTribeAlliance
---
This image is a joke, it's not the real statistics. Kromcrush is actually very balanced at the moment, I don't foresee nay movement to this.
---
Can also vouche for Ashbringer, good balance even if it feels a bit horde dominanted now that alliance has instant queues for battlegrounds. Good banter on the discord which is nice.
---
Hope to see you in game :)
---
Wtf do you mean lol, titan panel is good
---
Why are you so toxic? I really didn't want to do this, because I think it's bullshit, but you can check warcraftlogs if you don't believe me.
---

---
This is a Golemagg pull where someone managed to pull a extra pack of trash. I am the priest called Zulia, so you can clearly see that I am more than able to pull my own weight. It is totally possible to be more than good enough in this game without being obsessed with min/maxing.
---
So why not start at 10 then? Or even 100? Makes games much faster than 6728. Their inability to calculate their odds in this new "race to 1 separately" because they've never taken a high school level statistics course makes it more fun?
---
Yikes. Okay!
---
Relic coffer runs in brd.
---
Buy them keys for no more than 25s a piece.
---
Stealth to coffers open 11 of them and reset.
---
Ofc you can do pickpocketing during the run.
---
Kill the pyro boss and then reset.
---
You can also try RFD boss farming.
---
Works best if you can dc them blues.
---
Wish 55's stopped whispering me which bosses we're going for when I'm looking for more for BFD...

Wait...is this a Humor/MEME post outside of its specified day? Guys please tell me this will go away I am literally shaking right now
---
True, AV just requires entrapment and you're good
---
This shifting meta has been great to watch, especially since all of the arrogant loudmouths keep droning on about the "right" way to win when that was how you won last week.
---
It’s not Christmas yet! Why open his present early
---
There are lots of spots you can fly to in 3 or 4 minutes from places where you queue - that are worth farming.  From Orgrimmar there are Satyrs in Azshara, Elementals in felwood.  From UC you can fly to lights hope chapel and gather/grind mobs in EPL.
---
The only waste of time is really spent on a FP to your farming spot.  You're right, standing around for 15 minutes is a massive waste of time.  Pony up a few silver to get to a farming spot and be productive.
---
But they're reserved...
---
Come Windseeker! Vile needs healers for mc
---
I'll target the items that I can't replace with PvP gear first. 
---
HoJ is my highest priority, Mark of Fordring second. 
---
I'll mostly steer clear of leather gear and I won't do the Arena farm, rather spend that time in BGs for Rank 7+ gear.
---
And don't you dare try to challenge these toxic min/maxing macro lords who clearly don't even want to play the game. (sarcasm)
---
I really wish they could go play some other game, a game which is designed around competetion and stop ruining World of Warcraft Classic. Some of us actually wanted this game for many years, because it represent something else.
---
Any other day does the same thing, you still have a week in between your raid days.
---
We give EP in our guild for consumable usage in a raid as we're a casual guild. It's not a lot, but we do it.
---
We implemented this about 2 weeks ago and every raid since we've had issues with trying to get everyone reliably showing up to the point where we're just trusting people which given we can't prove it is becoming an issue.
---
If there's no decent solutions we'll probably just stop it, but itd be nice to have
---
You can have methods for the trinket, the worst farm is hand of power on Zigris in lbrs :-)

That's awesome.

Hunters are actually bottom 4 played class in Classic at level 60. 
---
Source : https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?faction=Alliance&amp;minLevel=60
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers?classes=true
---
Depends, mostly shield for groups and hard hitting bosses until you're geared or have a good healer. If you go arms in your 50s then you should definitely be mostly all shield for groups and bosses. I'd start on the safe side and charge in with shield. Macros that swap weapons and cast WW are really good. Take out your 2h for a quick second to land a big SS+WW to generate tons of aggro.
---
However, i would mostly stay in battle stance and swap to berserker for WW or go prot for initial group pulls or hard hitting bosses.
---
Good luck finding a group for scholo at 56. Scholo is lvl 58minimum id say.
---
This i can actually agree with.
---
Hunters do need to give up 1 bag slot and stock up on arrows which can get quite costly tho
---
But we have 12 days between raids...
---
I’m pretty sure they still can sans buff.
---
I did 279 runs to get my HoJ. But got my Mainhand of UBRS on my first run :D
---
Do you honestly think the difference in gear and talents would make a difference?
---
We cleared MC on our second week of being 60, with 30 people and just a few pieces of pre-bis here and there. The only think we actually had was tanks with FR gear.
---
I get that talents, gear etc is different, but we 1 phased Rag with shitty gear as 30 people, and we are not even good at the game.
---
All of us would just blow past MC even if we had 1.0 talents and gears. The playerbase is just that much better now.
---
Farming Lashers in DM East, looted a Forors (Quel book for 1h Sword) - didnt think much of it, plodded on with farming, few hours later another one dropped.. oh shit, Unique. Had to quick sell it in general. (honestly would've just gave it away to first warrior to /w if i never got a reply) Now when I get one I just insta HS and bank/mail it to alt.
---
Nope, the +30 Spell is for Spell Damage !!! Not Spell Power .
---
i agree there was less but it wasnt non existent, many of us had characters on both sides and friendly guilds on the opposing faction.
---
I've done probably 30 UBRS runs, most were Jed ID's.  I've only seen the reed drop 2 or 3 times, and each time there were 4 or more people rolling on it.  If I was a caster, and that was on my pre-raid BiS list, I wouldnt bother with it.  However, you do constantly see "jed/rend runs" advertised in LFG.    It's much more rare to find a full UBRS run, they're all jed/rend runs.
---
I funded my Sulfuras almost entirely with Rich thorium. The most ore I got without a single crystal or sapphire was 275. That was a very demoralizing day(ish). My best day was 11 crystals, 1 sapphire, and a golden pearl (nagas in Azshara) in about 8 hours.
---
no I'm warlock and I kill all 3 at the pool where hydrospawn sits, you can just LoS them around the pillar and npcs will always run to the corner of the pool before going into the water while you just jump up and down behind the pillar, it's 100% foolproof, the bosses don't even get a hit out and it takes about 2min per kill
---
I am winning around 80% of my AVs on Horde, so I don’t think it is favouring Alliance.
---
It's not even in the same universe as Hammer of Grace + Glowing Stone or Guiding Stave for Druids.   
---
22 int and 9 Mp5 are not worth 53-68 healing.
---
&gt;Someone handed in the buff and it took 4 minutes for it to even register, then when the head buff popped we were all stuck in Stormwind for over 10 minutes
---
He's saying 4 mins
---
yeah that happens
---
Yess they are. I do it all the time. On top of devilsaur I’ve made countless hide of the wild recently. You can act like you know every single server but im willing to bet you don’t.
---
Drek or kek.
---
Oh this is you again, lol.
---
All a queue means is that you don't fall behind the pack for using the bathroom or cooking lunch. I'll take 15 minute queues.
---
If I were to speed level and grind a character to 60 (Besides mage) what class should I go with?
---
150 g? We sell Tier 2 heads for those prices xD
---
Wow keep posting Flamelash Ironforge pics we haven't seen any yet it just stays interesting even after weeks of non-stop posting about it haha nice post

To me it's more of a Mega ManX enemy "maverick." Maybe "Charge Bovine"?
---
With all the AV Rep &amp; Honor grinding going on right now, I feel like Alliance have an advantage when it comes to world bosses. Alli have instant Q's while horde are waiting 15 minutes on average, so most horde players don't wanna waste any time on World Bosses because they'll have to wait another 15 to do AV. Alli don't feel this pressure at the moment since they can get right in to AV.
---
Once enough of you Alli get Exalted and stop Q'ing and the Horde Q reaches 1/2 hour+, we might be able to kill a world boss while in Q.
---
Farming I agree, soloing content I disagree. If you struggle on a mob that is doable solo, then you should consider another tactic, if a target is stunlockable, then it's killable!
---
Well, OP is alliance.
---
That might be the initial reason for twinking, but nowadays a lot of people twink because it's actually really fun to play against other twinks. It's also much easier and especially less time consuming to max out a twink than it is to max out a lvl 60. And twinks can actually be finished. If you get all your gear and enchants, you can just focus on PvPing. You don't have to go back to raiding every few months to get the better gear again.

Thanks mate, really appreciate your help

Undead warrior fury dps needs advice.

Hi guys ! Currently using Obsidian edged blade with +8 swords skill in 2 hand.  My question. Do i still need the 9 % hitcap here. how do i calculate my bonus +8 weapon skill. I can understand it helps me with glancing blows. but does it affect my hit % to ? 
---
Thanks
---
Hunter. Beast mastery leveling is easy mode
---
&gt;who's
---
lmao, keep making a fool of yourself
---
Definitely gonna be more servers like Flamelash after server transfers. People will pay to leave, those who cant afford quit.
---
And?
---
So you enjoy being a massive gaping asshole, *and* are proud of it? 
---
I mean on my server there's easily 5-6 full raids waiting on the buff each raid night, meaning you enjoy fucking over plus 200  people, just because you personally are so bad at the game you can't manage to stay alive in the easiest raid in vanilla?
---
The entire reason there is desperation as you call it surrounding the buff, is because there exist petty egotistical people like you, who wants 3 minutes of fun for yourself over 2-3 hours of fun for 200 other people.
---
I somehow highly doubt that you could get clubs of 500 players, all from a plethora of servers, to queue in sync and then communicating over voice comms in order to stomp randoms back in 2006.
---
Sorry, but that never happened.
---
You are a legend, thanks pal! Perfect response, I will do a some research now
---
Yea, let's not call out blizz on these bullshit issues. Let's just be happy and quiet and keep paying for a not flawed but broken game. The private servers could handle shit like this with just about ZERO issues.
---
Non prot, non arms... so fury then?
---
&gt; rat race with other players
---
AKA "the honor grind"
---
It's all the same operation happening client side. All of this DDOS's the server and it takes forever for the server to transfer the data telling the client to show the buff.   
---
It is the buff.
---
2 hours is a pretty normal amount of time for a group that's not full of geared consumable chuggers that aren't rushing through.
---
Why, imo the best system if you are active. Loot Council can be good but caused drama. MS-OS might be that you do not ever get geared, with bad luck. DKP also means that people are not trying get "all the purples" and are actually focusing to priority. DKP also g

Omg i was asking angrybeard last night if he ever heard from you two. Such great times in SM. Hope all is well!

Okay
---
Running 100 meters is easy but still the olympic games appears every 4 years.
---
Of course MC is easy, most things you do over and over again become easy, people find enjoyment in competing for rankings and pushing the limits.
---
The drama around ony buff isn't pointless, it's essential to people who do timed MC runs, if you don't have it you may as-well not bother ^^
---
And nobody gave a fuck? If you're looking- for some documentation obviously you're not going to find it. But I think you're just being contrary to be an asshole.
---
The only reason to fight in the outdoor world is over resources. Try good farming spots like west I fire elemental or female water elemental spots.
---
Not the worst idea, some pvp items are better than the leather bis gear but not everyone has the time to do rank 7 or even more. I wish you good luck for HoJ. I have SGC but never seen HoJ....;)
---
As a priest I'd easily take that bribe, it's worse than dm trinket and pretty much equivalent to second wind. And while it is an upgrade for paladins, the added utility isn't worth enough for such a heavy grind. Dps casters are the only ones who should care enough to actually run for it.
---
This. Sometimes a frost nova just does nothing and you can see the mage pop a vein
---
Well unless they time it perfectly, some time will pass before you get rooted.  They may even have their ability on CD.  Then there is the 250ms reaction to them rooting you, followed by 0.5s cast time. You're looking at about 1 second being rooted in that case.
---
Also, unless you are one of 'those' famous rets - why do you care if you are rooted by the mage? Your warrior (who you put BoF on) just killed him anyways.
---
The server was completely fucked 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE BUFF COULD BE USED. You couldnt check mail, use AH, trade for water or whatever. It has NOTHING to do with the buff, because it hasnt been used yet. Its just server load of sheer number of people in ogrimmar.
---
Long story short, gearing for pre-bis, currently have a bunch of choices of items, human rogue, I know I need bare minimum (or only) 6% hit? And the rest can go towards crit chance/agility/atk power? Right now I'm focusing on equipping items with crit/agility/atk power and mixing and matching sets to get the most of out them. I have looked at some guides but idk if they're reliable.
---
I mean I am totally fine if horde pushing slowly. But as you said, horde is pushing no more... they are mostly defending with 25+ people and I really dont know why.
---
Yeah its a minimum of pressing feign death 2-3 times. Big gamer skills needed.
---
Don't like spammers like Mysempai
---
Yeah that's right, but I guess not as efficient as a lock/spriest, afaik.
---
"Base AP" is based upon strength, not effects that give +AP. So it scales with your gear and with crusader proc
---
No clever traps or humanoid slaying? O.o
---
Not really sure. It was a reddit secret Santa present that came in the mail.
---
which doesn't happen, because horde have 10-15 minute queues and therefore can't form premades
---
&gt;  I wish you good luck for HoJ.
---
That's the one real goal I have before P3. I'm planning on doing it with parties and I have a mage and hunter friend who I'm planning on bribing to solo Angerforge for me. 
---
I'll probably go bankrupt before I get it but that's the way the wind blows.
---
ur kidding!
---
The guild I'm in has 4 full raids clearing Onyxia + MC in \~3 hours total, each raid.  
---
This was nowhere even close to what Vanilla had to offer. I went AQ40 and Naxx in vanilla and only with late vanilla gear and skill obtained we could finish those, that fast.  
---
Player are just better well informed and know the mechanics better nowadays and Blizz didn't adjust to this, actually made the opposite in releasing the nerfed version of vanilla.

We switched to cepgp last month. At first it was frustrating because the points were only 4-weeks retroactive so the people that got loot the first month of raiding had a huge advantage over those who got all their loot during the 4 weeks that were counted, but it's settled out now. The longer we use it the more fair the ratios have become
---
Its arguably better for druids than for shamans, so thats not rly an excuse.
---
There are two niche versions of shaman gameplay that can use Finkle’s well:
---
PvE Totem Twisting Enhancers
---
PvE Restoration with deep enhancement investment for improved Windfury.
---
Other specs cannot wear it (no 2h mace skill from enh tree, all regular caster specs cannot wear it) and/or don’t want to wear it (PvP Enhancer prefers higher top end dmg, PvP casters prefer shields for better survivability + Hand of Edward for utility).
---
Druids can mostly just equip it as a single item to upgrade two slots.
---
No, he says it takes 4 mins to register the buff. Which is fine. If you log out after you can see the buff being applied, you can just instant log off. And raid 60 mins later. When you won't have issues with lag. So no chance on losing it on the way there.
---
Sometimes it's cool too see a Mega Server Population in a capital city, the number of players wondering about can be astonishing. However I don't really see what the advantage is overall, especially when it's "literally unplayable" at times.
---
I bleive the original intent behind such large pops was that players would leave over time to reach a more normal level. However the current server pop limits are the beyond the scope of #nochanges and cause numerous issues with quality of life in-game. Just their impact on resources is absurd, farming highly desired mats are nigh impossible and their AH cost also represent this. Whether the servers can handle the increased population or not is quite irrelevant when the game's core design isn't compatible with it.
---
Late to answer this one, but I farmed the blue dragons in winter spring for roughly 24 hours over the course of two weeks. 2-3 hours some days or until I ran out of mags water. 
---
Finally got it to drop yesterday after about 2.2k kills from a mage weaver.
---
warrior to smash in pvp
---
As long as you're 305 or higher weapon skill you only need 6% hit.
---
Just curious, how are you already rank13? The highest people I have seen are rank 11, and even then only a few of those. Is Horde more or less dead on your server and it's easy to get that #1 spot, or do you guys manipulate the honor system somehow?
---
Wrong, lots of gear from DM and WC BoP is needed
---
Yes, hence the comment I made above. Not sure why you think you're divulging new information to me.
---
Dude. I say this over and over again.
---
Just because YOU like memes that doesn't mean everyone has to like them.
---
25 Likes in a subreddit with thousands of active users should Show you how Little People care for that stuff.
---
I hate memes on this subreddit and am super happy about the Change.
---
The world is not Spinning around People that want memes in their subreddits and if it did. The mods could still decide what to delete and what not on THEIR subreddit.
---
Sorry to bring it to you but you Need to make you own Sub in order to make the rules yourself.
---
Please stop being the vocal minority complaining about this while the majority of us silently enjoys a meme free Sub. Thank you :)
---
Got em
---
Didn't you just quote a 30% figure..?
---
That made me lol
---
I use my work MacBook Pro 2016 hooked up with a USB-C cable to my ultra wide monitor and for questing and dungeons so far (casual 35 Paladin here) it handles everything I’ve thrown at it fairly well on the lowest settings - Once I hit 60 and perhaps step foot in a 40 man raid this may change!
---
The choke between IB and TP towers is insane and alliance has nothing close to it themself, stonehearth bunker is completely useless. As far as the bases go frostwolf gy is over 50 yards away from dreks hut meaning you need dedicated flag defenders there while the stormpike gy is right outside van. As for the rush strat horde can easily outpace alliance since they have a favorable spawn super close to Balinda aswell as the backdoor skip.
---
Was not is
---
Talking about the vocal minority.... Sooo happy about those memes gone. And the best Thing is - I am barely ever on this Sub on a sunday :)
---
Really dunno whats so awful about a community on a server working to get the buff together.
---
Who even needs the Ony buff anyway lmao
---
You're not understanding what I'm responding with, so I'm just going to cut this short and do something else.
---
On my server we have a guild that raids at like 9 am server time. I end up grouping with a fair amount of them when I run dungeons late at night/early morning.
---
Do note the word "free" in there.
---
Rogue main here. What I do is BRD pickpocket runs but a bit more extended: I add 2 soloable boss kills and coffer openings. I buy keys at 15/ key, the return on a key is around 45s/ key so far. The 2 bosses are the flameweaver whatever tauren guy that stares at a statue and Plugger. Around 50-60 gold an hour.
---
People aren't entitled to a style of play, accept it or don't do AV.
---
Actual 5head
---
Warlocks blow hunters out of the water for pvp, for sure! This coming from a hunter
---
that's why bank alts are a thing. Basically parked in &lt;city&gt; near AH and Bank and you just mail it everything you want to sell or store for other alts.
---
Get it to lvl 5 and you can disenchant random greens you mail to it as well.
---
I wouldn't believe anything until we are phase 5 at least. Classic plus has been discussed to death.
---
the settings you made to your addons is seperated from your Interface-Addons folder so it should not be needed to save them.
---
Anyway you can save them when u search through your WTF folder, down there you can also find your keybindings and stuff
---
hand of rag is too flashy, bre for warrior tears
---
This is probably like that YouTube dipshit that claimed to have GTA6.
---
&gt; not sure how those are related:
---
See: warrior figures.
---
Also 30%??
---
Nah, AV is mind numbing lmao. You literally have post after post and dozens of people expressing their dissatisfaction with the BG but you're still ignorant enough to say what you said lmao. Regardless of the potential of AV and what you can get from it as an experience ( summoning Ivus etc ) you hardly get that version. Instead youll 99% of the time get a broken and drawn out fight that'll lead to a loss OR you win in 7 mins. 
---
Anything you can say is refuted by the fact that unless youre in a premade youre expecting 40 people to cooperate and perform their roles properly. Youre also expecting them to handle an opposing faction that wants to cause chaos within the raid as well (Which they do effortlessly). In short, for the most part youre going to get mind numbing AV games. 
---
Mind you, I dont find AV mind numbing with the Drek strat thats ran by my guild LOL I find it very fun to win.
---
i was in some dng group,and we were spaming sfk,at end of instance they told me to log out and back in ,and that they will reset instance and that i will be at start of dungeon,and that excatly happened
---
i tried that strategy with other group but it didnt work,what excatly do i need to do for that strategy to work ?
---
I'm not sure about any quests in DM, not any that award noticeable loot at least, but I might be wrong as I only focused on getting tanking gear. For Dire Maul East you should be fine at 57, given that a group will take you. You will be fine at 57, but a lot of people for some reason don't want to take sub 60's.
---
As an enhance shaman, I want to raid molten core and onyxia. How much hit % do I need? How much of said hit % can I get via talents, and how much from gear? Thanks
---
Your “father” sounds like an actual loser. Arrogant, selfish, self absorbed and utterly without care or sympathy, even for his own flesh and blood unless it benefited him personally.
---
People like this do exist, and in awfully sorry you had one for a father, but it sounds like a brilliant man replaced him, so in the end you got a true dad who actually acted like a man.
---
I’m glad her inadvertently introduced you to WoW, as I know from my years of playing of how much it helps you and brings joy to your life, so there is a good silver lining there.
---
And good on you for being a good person and rising above his bullshit. Hell you even tried to the mend the fence, but he just sounds like toxic negativity that you don’t need in your life. Cut loose this toxic anchor and you’ll thrive. He’s not needed anyway as you already have a wonderful father at home.
---
Anyhow my best to you and I’m glad that you’re doing well 💪🏻
---
I mean I see a awesome board game like Tainted Grail or Gloomhaven and just drop money on it to get the boardgame and most to all stretch goals when it releases^^
---
So far good, tho I only backed boardgame projects, and those are always in a somewhat - done manner when they appear on kickstarter, so not as much risk as some of the more adventourous science projects.
---
And no, you don't get money, unless you sell of the board games afterwards, usually kickstarter has drastically reduced pricing in comparison the the retail price... I coudn't part with most of my boardgames tho ^^
---
SUper 2000's guild name lmao. i love it.
---
What are you on about man? Your title makes zero sense.
---
Demon Hunter in classic+. This sounds already ruined imo
---
Imagine if Gnomes had the cannibalize ability, too. Two foot tall mongrels devouring your character and giggling while they do it.
---
50%. Either they drop or not :)))
---
Still gambling, and still easy enough for scamming though. I don't really care, I'm just surprised they're allowing it.
---
Definitely one of the best piece of WoW art I've ever seen.
---
I'm lucky to have a nice, large and active guild on an otherwise dead server.
---
You clearly have never run it. InB4 you say your a leet hunter who cleared naxx and can do tribute run in 9 minutes.
---
Look at this competitive nature in the flesh, damn your guild if you can't speed run a raid even if you got fresh 60s who are new to WoW pfffft.
---
zzz yeah my uncle also works at bizzards and tells me every detail i mean there can’t be legal consequences right?
---
impossible alliance are already at a 10% winrate the past week in randoms so there is no way for it to get that low. 
---
EU alliance are a lost cause at this point they don't wanna turtle but keep pretending that horde won't mass defend
---
Why you log out , they will give the lead to someone outside of the instance. These guy will reset the instance, and because you were in an old instance, you will be tp back to the entrance of the new instance.
---

---
Getting into BRM or MC wasnt a problem on our server (even tho registering a buff took 30mins+). So really no point in waiting a extra hour there. It just took few mins to HS to kargath after that people started spreading out quite fast and the server worked semi ok.
---
I can't recommend alliance ashbringer unfortunately. I'm struggling to get dungeon groups whilst levelling up. Compared to my experience on flamelash horde, it's a lot quieter. People seem friendly however, and insta queue is nice.
---
This post breaks rule 7
---
What's the best way to find a raiding guild with raid times that would fit my schedule?
---
I'm horde on Blaumeux but I'd be willing to character transfer.
---
Got the neck and flask recipe in my 1st run. Haven’t been here since. I feel your luck friend.
---
Whats the best talent tree for a level 60 PVE enhance shaman who's focus is on dungeons and raising? I've seen many different builds and I'm not sure the optimal one
---
I have been farming SM GY and the experience has been great. Just find a group with another mage or a lock and you'll be golden.
---
Imagine being so bad you can't win, so your new plan A is playing not to lose.. They could just cap objectives in the 7-10 min games and get an equal amount of honor, but they would rather stall for 30min to get the same amount with a pop-up saying they "won"
---
Saw a guildy heals priest need and win on it once, because he was too trusting of Zygor guide telling him it was an upgrade and didn’t double check.  Guild officer mage was in the group, he wasn’t happy.  Priest felt like shit about it, and took a lot of shit from the guild about it for weeks, not all of it good humored.
---
Stop broadcasting you’re dropping the buff?
---
Priest DM trinket is just OP though. Compare it to the hit pile of garbage shamans get.
---
It's a bit weird but makes plenty of sense. Paid transfer arent faction locked, both can do it
---
What market price add on are you using?
---
You can transfer both horde and alli in one server
---
&gt; private servers
---
lol
---
they most likely run as premade, clear everything under 10 min and win, which is what you should be doing
---
lf inv
---
Blizzard needs to open up free transfers for the NPC's.... No fair Blizz.
---
My guild does the same. I like it.
---
Most good guilds on your server are already doing enough raid dps to beat patchwerk berserk timer in naxx
---
Classic is already easy, if you arent terrible you wont feel real challenge in the game, so good players will instead elect to push clear times.
---
Yeah for some people theyre already geared out. the only progression at that point is parsing higher to beat their previous record. I mean people do it in others and in irl events, i really dont know why people are so offended by it.
---
&gt;Wait till AQ opens +/-50% of the server pop in one zone....
---
Well, it cant be any worse than AQ opening was in actual vanilla. You coudnt do anything... finally i just gave up.
---
Is this some kind of zug im not zugging?
---
He lost it to an ele shaman? Yikes
---
Hey, I know that guy.
---
-Snowy
---
Wow will he do this for others?! So sick!
---
&gt; who wants 3 minutes of fun for yourself over 2-3 hours of fun for 200 other people.
---
I thought the point of using the onyxia buff for, as you put it, the easiest raid in vanilla was to have the least duration of fun possible?
---
Or skip Onyxia buff. Or grab the onyxia buff 6 hours before with remote desktop from work. Or grab the laggy onyxia buff and go afk and prepare dinner.
---
I changed my drinking to Tuesday to make MC a little more exciting 😂
---
you are probably doing PUB raids so it is easy for you to say that.
---
Sometimes. Other times they give you fuck all.
---
I only DE if I really need mats for an enchant, or if it's a blue with a &lt;2g vendor tag.
---
This isn't news.
---
THANK YOU
---
I will literally never understand why people don’t use the marks that correspond to class colors.
---
Also because there was no ony cd in vanilla.
---
doesn't matter anyway unless you get the buff and dont know for 30 minutes. you just log off once you get the buff to preserve it
---
The entire point of LC is to use discretion to award players who actually care and can consistently perform
---
If you just want to use raid attendence as the sole metric to distribute loot just use DKP or EPGP
---
Due to tranq shot we're always needed though. Raid spots are competitive, but there are always 2-3.
---
Maybe i should have changed "free" to "open" instead.
---
It's pretty whatever on those mobs
---

---
You shouldnt be using loot council, EPGP would be way more effective and objective for that loot distribution philosophy.
---
So I can have Ally and Horde on PvP-Server?
---
what's usually the spec for tribute runs? my hunter is almost 60 and i would like to try doing them at some point
---
It's Hammer time.
---
Dude the reason you are killed in Southshore and co is because AV is still the best honor but has 15 minute queue times for Horde now. So Horde players run around in the open world in the meantime to get these extra bits of honor.
---
I wish. If the horde just tried to win instead of turtling every game it would be smooth sailing, even if our own winrate went down.
---
Everyone in the instance has to be offline when someone else resets it.
---
Truestrike is literally your only item with +hit?
---
With 25% crit unbuffed, you can definitely use T2
---
1 SP = 0.2 dmg on SoC proc, 0.43 dmg on JoC and 0.04 dmg per consecration tick. Also 0.43 on hammer of wrath, 0.56 dmg on shadow oil proc and 1 dmg on dragonbreath chili proc, 0.43 dmg on exorcism and 1 dmg on some weapon procs.
---
2 AP = 0.14 dps, so 0.53 dmg per white hit and 0.37 dmg per SoC proc with a 3.8 weapon, with a 3.4 weapon only 0.47 dmg per white hit and 0.33 dmg per SoC proc
---
Over a minute with a 3.8 weapon you have: 16 white hits, 7 SoC procs, 7.5 JoCs, 60 consecration ticks.
---
1 SP over a minute is: 0.2 * 7 + 0.43 * 7.5 + 0.04 * 60 + 2 Hammer of wrath in a fight (0.86 dmg) = 7.81 dmg
---
2 AP over a minute: 0.14 white dps = 8.4 dmg and 2.6 dmg from SoC, so 11 dmg over a minute or 1 AP would 5.5 dmg
---
So, just on the baseline, 1 SP is around 1.5 AP. However most of APs dmg is affected by armor and the extra attacks all are only affected by Spelldmg. If you use shadow oil (2.5 procs per minute, so 1.68 dmg) and Dragonbreath (1 ppm, so 1 dmg), you've already put 1 SP up to 10.49 dmg, so worth around 1.9 AP. 
---
So, it all depends on how many consumables you want to invest. Feel free to scale 1 SP down to 1.5 AP, if you don't want to use the consumes. Once we get towards Naxx, SP receives another boost, due to Exorcism becoming available and this then puts 1 SP at 12.21 dmg per minute, i.e. 2.2 AP and with Ashbringers weapon proc you get another 1 dmg per SP per minute.
---
If you were to use SoR SP would be worth a lot more than 2 AP.
---
2 AP with Sor = 0.14 dps, so 8.4 dmg per minute
---
1 SP with Sor with a 1.5 speed 1h weapon = 40 * 0.1 dmg on SoR, 0.04 * 60 consecration + 7.5 * 0.5 JoR = 9.95 dmg per minute
---
So, 1 SP is already worth 2.4 AP (=1 Strength) before using any consumables and that's with a hanzo sword, with an MCP it'S even more in favor of SP
---
&gt;Earthshaker is probably the most balanced high pop realm out there, maybe even slightly horde favored judging by the numbers at world bosses
---
According to Warcraftlogs 98 guilds cleared 10/10 MC on earthshaker, only 43 of them horde, which makes the realm 56% alliance dominated, judging by that metric.
---
For whatever reason this is a pain in the ass in Classic. For retail you have wowprogress, but for Classic most guilds don't even post recruiting posts! I have found going to Warcraftlogs and parsing through guilds logs because that will show their times. Granted not every guild logs...
---
You can also see if your server has a Discord, the actual WoW Forums as well.
---
Only god knows what the server does in that lag. Few people got a rollback while HS'ing yesterday. Lost Ony buff completely, but gained time on other buffs like SF. 
---
The 30mins was mostly waiting for the buff guy to move. In the lag it stops for 5 minutes between going to the buff place. There was a 3-4min gap between the two different YELL announcements he does.
---
The buff really happens on 30mins of lag later.
---
I assume 9% unless you have a weapon specialization then if you use said weapons it's 6%
---
I think it's the best EU PVP realm. Everything I've heard about the others make me extremely glad I rerolled from Mograine to Dreadmist on the 2nd day because of queues. 
---
The faction split is good and the economy is healthy, a few try hard guilds on horde and alliance currently competing over MC speed runs, lots of more social guilds that are still clearing content nicely. Absolutely no complaints from me!
---
I got choker before I ever saw that neck.   I don’t believe it exists.
---
No that's not what i'm saying. I'm not sure you know how reading works.
---
On the other hand I can /who OG at 3am on my server and probably find about 50 level 60s.
---
I like your setup. What is the name of that threat meter you are using? It would be nice to have one separate from Details dmg meter.
---
It's basically just pre ordering.
---
Or maybe part of that sweaty parse hunting shit you do is having to deal with obnoxious stuff like that to get a little bit better numbers in the end of the week. Go to a private server and play if you don't want the game to function as it originally did.
---
There's a twatty guild on my server that always starts raiding half an hour before every other guild starts so they end up ruining everyone else's dragonslayer buff.
---
Yes but if I'm forming a group then people expect me to have the key.
---
&gt; Theory crafting with trial and error
---
It's not theory if you literally practically just keep trying it with your character
---
Halfway you mean 4 minutes in?
---
&gt; Use the button on the map.
---
I know that already.
---
No problem at all, if you get stuck between a couple of options private message me both and I will tell you which one is better in general and better for WoW :)
---
They would each have to level multiple alts and get every one of those 15 hks per week. And they'd still have to outfarm every other alliance player on the server in terms of honor.
---
No, you can't.
---
Xpoff.com
---
Theoretically yes, but practically not easy to use, mage blizzard or warlock rain are far more reliable and less risky. But yes, if you defend a tower by your lonesome putting down a sonsec to early detect a possible stealther is a good idea.
---
apparently #nochanges. imagine ppl wanting to play 15 year old game exactly the same way 15 years later. No wonder people want to change things.
---
Drinn, could you shed a little more on Smolderweb either here or in PM please? I am strongly considering transferring there.  Would appreciate it !
---
So your guild isn't helping each other get items if they already have one?  Do you see the problem here?
---
fair enough. I just wonder how to get the nodes in water. As warrior is there any way other than just swimming? I know there are swim speed pots but they got 2 min cd and 20 sec duration...
---
Curious why you didn't want the upvotes?
---
Wow you're right, a nolifer paying $25 to get a shot at Rank 14 is never gonna be able to handle the stress of playing one game of Warsong Gulch on their alt.
---
Death rolls baby
---
I don't know how the ranking actually works. But any guild that logs to Warcraft Logs for that server will be on it. Not all guilds use logs so there will be some not shown. It's just a site I've used to try to help find a guild in my time frame.
---
You can pvp well in blues if you learn the class’s limits.
---
There is a swim speed belt. I will definitely say that non-druids and non-shamans have a distinct disadvantage.
---
Alright thanks man.
---
It's only an issue because people insist on raiding this one night.
---
Every other night, Ony buff is fine.
---
If my guildie isn't healing me in 5 mans you can bet I am talking to the heal lead and not running with that person again
---
Don't do what he said.  Just queue first available,  then talk to him again and look at the list to see what game you got into.  If its not at the bottom,  right click and leave queue from the minimap.  Rinse,  repeat.  Means you don't have to wait for someone to leave a new match to join.
---
It is for sure on dmg, already got stunned by SW:P while the priest was in kidney/blind for a while. I remember it clearly since those lucky procs usually totally fuck up your rotations \^\^
---
Ur the 2nd target after ur healer in WSG then ur fucked if u dont have CDs like ice block or nova, in AV its just hit a boss or spam blizz on defense. Super repetitive lock has more interesting fights and while raiding ur way more likely to get gear. Done mc 8 times onyxia 10 times and ive only gotten 5 pieces and one of those pieces is a onyxia backpack.
---
Used to use bagnon and loved this feature, just switched to adibags and disappointed that I lost this...does adibags not do this or have I just not messed with the settings yet?
---
Its not redundant to the story... it give a indication of the relationship even before reading her comment that goes into detail.
---
That's insane
---
yes you can only make 1 then you have to wait 24 hours
---
Not aloud to blink at the screen or bio either.
---
Especially when they try to minmax healers and tanks. You can shine in different aspects of healing and tanking instead of just going some cookie cutter built ya dweeb.
---
You can jump tru the small window next to the elf and it zones you into MC raid.. You must be in a raid ofc.. just jump tru it.
---
No, i'm not joking.
---
As a warlock, getting opened on by a hunter at max range just makes me let go of the keyboard.
---
And it will be removed over and over again unless you learn to flair it :)
---
It depends a lot on the faction too. Horde will always be more popular for warlocks (in vanilla) due to not having to deal with WoTF.
---
I can earn with my warrior friend aprox. 35-45g per hour. (As in each one of us earns 35-45g per hour).
---
So yeah 30h of playing and earning 130g is not a lot.
---
Someone expressing an opinion you don’t agree with doesn’t make them “ignorant”.
---
Sounds like you’re focussed on winning winning quickly. I just focus on fighting the opposite faction and have a lot of fun doing so. Those “broken and drawn out fights” that you talk about are the best kind of AV for people like me who enjoy pvping.
---
Ahhh the last one wasnt removed because of flair (although I do always forget that) it was removed by a bot because it thought I was looking for people to play with etc etc. Oh well haha
---
Alliance on our server aren’t even trying anymore. Horde has like 50 lvl 20 locks ready to summon people the second azuregos spawns
---
Square also works when you've got two mages in a dungeon group.
---
Nipple gang rise up
---
Not even that, because it doesn't properly work for BFA.
---
gold
---
I think you're in my guild. Stopping afk'ing mid boss please.
---
do you remember someone named bishara
---
Sorta like the begrudging joy of spectating after a teamkill. Rather ingenious, really.
---
For paladin tanks or Ret pvp or what? Either way I don't think it's the most viable but it's not the worst talent.
---
Warlock
---
Thing is, most world pvp situations (and duels) involve two mounted players, the hunter can literally never afford to dismount before you do because once conc is down he's a sitting duck.
---
Of course a max range opening is ideal for the hunter, but in some real world settings, the lock can tank through enough till random dominant faction (horde in my case) appear to help.
---
Just watch for the shadow reflector pop and the rest should be smooth.
---
Meta comes from the term metagame. Your definition is a backcronym
---
Yes 15% seems way too much. With bis gear you should be around 12%, any higher and you are most likely losing a lot of ap/crit
---
This means someone did something to fuck this up for everyone else.
---
Warrior is definitely out of the question.  They are the most gear dependent class there is.  Out of rogue or mage, I'd say mage is less gear dependent, but either of them can be useful in just blues.
---
Now tell that to every server where horde dominated bg's in 2005 but couldn't win av.
---
there is also priests with levitate but that costs
---
Oh wow, someone whos actually defending turtle games lmao. okay
---
I read that as, the "friend" used the OP's warrior to bot and got it banned. Account sharing OP?
---
Does sound familiar.. rouge?
---
You ever hear of guns don't kill people, people kill people? Creating the environment that allowed p2 to happen is on Blizzard, but ultimately the players chose to do what they did.
---
It was just a stupid question that I knew would be answered within like 5 minutes (which it was). Apparently people wanted to discuss it quite a bit more than I anticipated though.
---
Thank you for answering! Maybe you're right and the current Reckoning is the correct one. Maybe I should read patch notes next time :P
---
It was just a matter of time
---
It's apples to oranges in so many ways, this is a pretty narrow view really.
---
Yikes @ your attempt to spell alpha
---
Was in an hour long AV in which we killed the Primalist mid before the summon even started, then summoned Ivus and watched him curbstomp the entire Horde raid.  And yes, they pulled him into Drek's room, who doesn't help kill the tree, and Ivus would kill them all and reset to full health outside the building each time.
---
I got a LOT of honor and rep that game.
---
I’m with you. Usually a couple hrs away and I’m itching to play tho ha. Plus with horde BG q times I can actually get shit done in the house.
---
TotemTimers does exactly this, in exactly the same way as Samy.
---
While this is true. It's about damn time they have a ban wave.... Botting is rife!
---
It's been several days since I lost an AV.
---
I just added **Screenshot** flair which should at least help provide better categorization. We'll look into more options though.
---
How do you make 130g per hour from tribute runs? Honest question.
---
this might sound like a joke but is actually reality on many servers.
---
It’s not that important if you’re aware of totem placement.
---
Every time lol
---
Oh shoot does it? I’ll have to play around with it more since I installed it hastily for raid!
---
Seems like a lot of work for a buff you don’t need to do current content.
---
That is what good guild mates are for. otherwise if you don't have those then I agree.
---
Hi, /u/truthtablez1

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8b5zd/ive_seen_some_players_disappear_how_are_they/). 
---
If you /y on this server does anyone read your screams?
---
yeah? Nostralius and Lights Hope, they used the exact same AV
---
That would only be true if they did banwaves prior to the weekly calculations on Tuesday, which is not the case. Even if the bots get banned before they can hit R14, it still causes everyone else below them to get fewer RP every single week and end up taking longer to rank up.
---
BASED

Haha not getting into a gun debate, just thought the phrase fit. Obviously World of Warcraft is a lot different than real life.

No hope for you either buddy if you take everything at 100% face value all the time.

---
That‘s not generally true - after reaching a certain +healing breakpoint most classes want to improve their mana pool. So it really depends on the rest of your gear.
---
Just as a practical example with similar values to what you mention:
---
Malistar‘s Defender is considered the best offhand for Shamans in deep healing spec and full tier1 - better than Lei of the Lifegiver. Take a look at those stat differences.
---
Its about a tradeoff: do you want to use more high ranking spells or almost exclusively low ranks? As a Rank1 Chain Heal bot, lei is regularly better.
---
Soon we will get content where fights last longer than 1-2 minutes - that‘s when mp5 is going to shine.
---
you can’t expect a small indie company like blizz to have working servers on raid night. 
---
Just tell your guild to start raiding at 3am Mondays
---
Well, it's a high pop server. So, there's just a shit load of H v alli
---
Easiest way I’ve found.
---
Go to darn, take the port and go to auberdine then get on the boat to menethil harbor. Once there jump off the dock into the water and swim southwest. Don’t get to close to the bank at first to avoid murlocs. Keep swimming avoiding fatigue. After 10 minutes or so there’ll be a little U shaped cove and if you walk up there it’ll pop up that you’re in dun morough despite being way north. Then just stuck and poof ur in kharanos then take the train to sw
---
None of the hunters in my guild will be upgrading their weapons until ZG when those useless fast mainhanders start to drop or when all warriors/rogues have what they want.
---
*resisted*
---
I would on the other hand prefer Earthshaker. For both 5mans and PvP the proc is amazing and it procs OFTEN. For pure dmg output in raids etc go TUF, for anything else Earthshaker
---
Rfd is great, stealth through it. Get ghost mushrooms.
---
ah so that's where all the ony weapons have been going.  1 viskag and 1 deathbringer, been doing ony since like week 4 (and 2 ony/week for past like 5 resets)
---
Honestly it is quite sad to see Flamelash Pictures currently.
---
I don't know how Blizzard let this happen. 
---
They really should just shut the Server down. Offer free Transfers for a week or so and then force Transfer the rest on to another Server.
---
That’s kinda lame being that zero mobile clients have the ability to add flair to posts.
---
I'm not at my home pc right now, but I think they are found somewhere under "misc" keybindings. It's not done from the addon's interface.
---
Ahh that’s why I couldn’t find it! Thanks for the tips!
---
It's actually 30-50 min in Oceanic servers, I farm herbs thus far... And was able to make 300-400g worth so far since BG was introduced.
---
thanks looked it up, looks interesting.
---
Ah yes the famous class ”tank”
---
(It is sad we all know he is a warrior)
---
I see constant posts for ZF and tonssss of non 60 stuff. This guy just likes to bitch.
---
rough estimate, you can make more tbh.
---
Each chest+boss is about 25-30ish gold, with some gear and talent you can consistently do 5 runs per hour
---
so instead of raiding monday-thuesday, you raid monday-wednesday and do some AV with your PvE spec on thuesday.
---
it's seriously not a big deal.
---
That has more to do with the fact that russians can only play with russians and they have like 2 realms
---
You ever notice how you never had any russian name teammates?
---
This is such a sick style.  Most people go for the super realistic look but this is just awesome
---
Maybe ONE orb. People who think they are entitled to 75+ gold for a single dungeon run are such little bitches.
---
takes like 5 people to stop a 20 man from using that backdoor.
---
seriously, the bunker's archer are nearby, there's a boatload of NPC and most people need 10 friggin attempt before getting the jump right...
---
and if you kill them, they respawn all the way back to IB GY.
---
/moo
---
The only thing RPers are good at is navigating Goldshire using nothing but their non-dominant hand.
---
Skinning, devilsaur farming is about 150 gold per hour. Other than that you can do some Pattern + alchemy recipe farming in LBRS
---
With my experience playing alliance all the horde has to do is wipe the main push once.  Then alliance will focus on bickering with each other over playing.
---
This is what happens when you kill Galv!!!
---
Drek first or you are kek.
---
Galv then Lts then Drek is auto win.
---
The idea that you have to adapt to what your opponent is doing seems lost on most of the chat generals.  Protect graveyards and capped towers?!?!?
---
Looks like one dude being weird and a few others joking about it. But if you enjoy people talking about cocks then don’t let me take that from you. Have at it.
---
Super common to have marathon games in vanilla!
---
ES is good for dungeons
---
We actually wound up winning the game. I think someone had the same mindset that Drek would help lol. Ivus actually is not that difficult to take down though with a proper group.
---
But yeah this game was an insane rep game and was very entertaining.
---
&gt;  Out of rogue or mage, I'd say mage is less gear dependent, but either of them can be useful in just blues.
---
As i am usually trash with ranged, was thinking something along the lines of a prep specced rogue and not CB and try to brute force burst people down left and right. Cd is lower
---
No but fair point. Bit weird that they can play against normal EU realms but not with.
---
Shaman r teh Overpower checking in!
---
Thank you💕
---
I am a 54 mage working on getting to 60. I’d like to get to 60 next week so I can raid during my week off and enjoy the end game a bit. Right now, I almost only have quests that are 2-4 levels above me and it’s taking forever to get through them. The AoE spots seem to be full of mages. What are some of the best ways to finish off leveling in this range?
---
OP is trolling. He doesnt want anybody else to run these gold farms so he can be the richest boy in his server.
---
Like anything else in life, practice makes perfect. You cant just go and farm wahtever for the first time and be a beast at it.
---
Farms that take practice to nail down: ZF zombie farms. Angerforge farm. Tribute runs. DM East if you go for satyrs packs (locks dont have issues here because of demon enslave). BRD packs (and only if you are greedy and pull everything and their brothers).
---
I´m probably missing a couple of them but these are what people (farmers)do the most.
---
Join the Alliance on mograine. One of the more balanced servers with a large community.
---
Im in therapy, because I recognized the issue and don’t wanna end up like him
---
Nobody ask him how close he got to 14!
---
Cursed knowledge becomes the dankest memes.
---
I wish you'd noted whether galv died first.
---
I raid on my MacBook Pro 16 and it handles it perfectly fine.
---
It makes sense because you shouldn't really be able to communicate cross faction anyway
---
And it won't be much longer before horde is back out WPvPing between queue times once there is 20+ minute queues, a must to stay in B13/14.
---
Win trading is likely going to be unaffected, just like account sharing for people who made precautions against acc sharing ban. Botting is another story.
---
Lol what?
---
Isn't there already a 90 day cd?
---
Vamp clan is #6 in the US in MC clear time lmao. Some of those guilds are trash but you dont have a leg to stand on.
---
Imagine feeling this entitled to 8 minute alliance zerg victories.
---
Beautiful :D
---
Doing it perfectly is fine, but the way youtubers calculate gold per hour is bad: they do one run of something in 12 minutes and multiply gold from it x5, but you actually cant do 5 runs per hour, only 4 after first run, also a lot of random shit is not explained, so you gotta learn stuff yourself anyway (and find a better way to farm).
---
the lasher can be ignored or killed at the very same pillar at the pool and for the hellcaller packs: enslave hellcaller, have it cast RoF on it's location, dot all imps and wait for them all to die roughly at the same time, sometimes the hellcaller survives with 5% ish and sometimes 3-4 imps survive and are almost dead
---
[https://youtu.be/t6cht4djp-8?t=546](https://youtu.be/t6cht4djp-8?t=546) this is way easier to pull off imho
---
One day I got stupid lucky and won 800g for my epic mount; My guildies never hear the end of it
---
Not spending $150 at the bar every Thursday and Saturday is absolutely saving me more money than I thought.
---
Only downside is I feel a lot more anti-social.  Now I just spend like $50 at the bars on Thursday and not staying out until 2am. Not having a hangover on Friday at work is nice.
---
Watch the general chat in your town. Guilds looking for players all the time. Or even better write in general chat that you are looking for a guild. Alternativ join random groups. If they are nice ask for their guild and demands.
---
Thou shall not lie about thy number of riding skills
---
That's due to the design of AV. If a Zerg fails then the most likely scenario is a turtle where 40 unorganized people attempt to do something more coordinated than the enemy 40 people. It's also easy to understand how turtles happen when a single person can often wipe half a raid trying to kill drek/vann.
---
Making turtles is easy, making wins is hard.
---
Oh baby! That's pretty big man , nice. I really wanted 4 for access to the hall
---
sentenced to death by gamon haha
---
The proc on earthshaker is still pretty sick even for 1v1. It has a very high chance to proc too.
---
I just hit exalted last night and the last 21k rep was a complete slog.  I envy the people that had time to grind out exalted the first 2 days while alliance won 90% of the games
---
Wow, what an awful story. I'm so sorry about your dad. He was an addict and couldn't stop playing the game. He needs serious professional help. I hope he gets it one day but yes keep going to therapy to heal from all of the damage he did to you growing up. I'm here if you need to talk!
---
Thunderfurry represent! Last report of raid guild who log was 48.5/51.5 for the horde. It's a small sample size but I think I agree that the were one of the few lucky servers that are balanced.  My big thing Is we have just enough of a healthy population that we don't have reports of the servers crashing or lagging horribly but yet there's ppl everywhere still it seems.  Annnd ever since BG release the horde have finally somewhat chilled the fuck out lmao. Can't speak for alliance so not sure.
---
Try the addon fishing buddy
---
Hm? The person I'm responding to us asking a hypothetical question in which the NPC is a civilian.
---
Why not wait till Christmas then?
---
It doesn't matter. You could get rid of half the archers in the alliance base and it's still easier to defend than the horde side.
---
Having a backdoor or a slight starting position pales in comparison to all the advantages the alliance have
---
Knowing your bis doesn't require much knowledge. You just look at a list of items and where they drop from so it requires zero knowledge of any other items.
---
A month of straight botting however is still incredibly damaging. 
---
hundreds if not thousands of bots per server running / farming 24/7 for a month causes a tremendous amount of damage, and now with AV honor farm bots occupying a large chunk of the top 100 ranking spots is going to make that grind even more unreasonable or just incentivize people to afk farm even harder -- further damaging the game as a whole.
---
Plague lands and winter spring are my current quest set. I’ve finished the rest - I just get so tired of drinking between +2-3 level mob kills 😂
---
Actually, it can bug out where they can shoot you on the other side of the flag. Has only happened once, it it's possible
---
Of course not, but in this case, it's easy to not do the shitty behaviour that caused all the complaints about phase 2. 
---
It also takes the personal component out of it. When I'm on my fourth corpse run in 4 minutes because some gang of 60s have killed me once again for the 10 or so honour points they get for killing a level 48 player, I'm not sitting there saying "They're just doing what Blizzard allows them to do!", and neither is anyone else that happened to.
---
I'm not willing to give people acting poorly a free pass because they're doing what the system allows them to do, just like someone who takes an ar-15 to some school or mall somewhere doesn't get a free pass just because they got something that they're legally allowed to get, to inflict more damage than they would have if they couldn't get that item. 
---
Blizzard rolled it out haphazardly but the players still have a lot of responsibility for it too.
---
Auctioneer.
---
Thank you will do!!
---
Had 5 thus far. Been off work recently so started levelling a warrior. Basically what I did was log my mage at DM East &gt; lasher run (takes me ~6 mins to full clear all lashers and there is 2 possible book spawns) after last pack dies I would log out and grind mobs on warrior for 11 minutes, log back into mage, he gets sent to DM East entrance so I just reset and rinse repeat. I cant be bothered with 2nd account or asking people to reset it for me and just doing chill runs like this at my own pace i've banked about 5000g. On top of this I paid for my own epic mount, sent my alt another 1200 (training + mounts) + kept a book for myself. I sent all the herbs I looted to a herb bank, mostly selling the dreamfoil/groms/shrooms and cashed in another 500-800g this week tidying out the chars bags. 
---
Now I expect to blow through it all respecing twice a week between pvp/pve and gearing the warrior when he eventually hits 60 (35 atm)
---
Except idk wtf u linked https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#boss=672
---
Look at storm and tyhero both have several warriors using OEB and slam. Specifically their #2 dps for both dw is slightly ahead but not by much.
---
I don't think there's going to be a mass exodus at this point. The introduction of BGs made World PvP fun again. I was able to level from 54 to 56 in roughly 4 hours. During Phase 2, that would have been 4-5 bubbles at best.
---
Fair point. And also rare set starts at rank 7 and finishes at 10 I think.
---
Yoted.
---
Thanks for the information mate, food for thought
---
Make an alliance character on EU-Flamelash.
---
Or how about those with fuzzy math. For example: I pick pocket a mob for 50 silver, that pickpocket takes one second. 50 silver per second over an hour means I'm farming 1,800 gold per hour! Don't forget to smash that like and subscribe button, LIKE SPIKE!
---
Ideally mana isn't a huge thing for warlocks since you can drink, tap, and get healed.  Spellpower is generally far more important and makes you more mana efficient than a larger mana pool.
---
Apparently they do not. Spellpower is thrown around everywhere, despite the words only apearing like 3 places in all of classic.  
---
    
---
As a stat it consolidated the two bonus types, so long as bonus healing exists, spell power does not. It could be forgiven if people only used the term when referring to spell damage, however they do not.
---
&gt;theorycrafting
---
You keep using that word
---
it doesn't mean what you think it means
---
Oh I completely agree. I hope we see some change soon
---
You're about to see a Dwarf Priest get bukkake'd
---
I had a similar experience. Troll mage level 50+ escorted me through the entirety of my whirlwind axe quest at level 30. Literally followed me to STV, all of Arathi elementals. I tagged every mob then he basically one shot them. I will never forget that good deed as it was like a total of 3 hours he spent following me around with absolutely no communication lol. Never forget! Nexusmage the troll mage of Mankrik!
---
Be real, this many ppl and no gank? Not possible.
---
Why hope he is dead? He should outlive all of his kids by decades before dying alone in a cold and windy farm house with only his stained conscience as his friend. Trying to remember in his deathbed the good times in his life, but only to realize he had nothing good to remember and no one to share anything with.
---
I have considered going alliance in general tbh they are outnumbered in almost every server
---
&gt;literally practically
---
**TL;DR:** Heroic Strike.
---
Precisely. Shield Slam and Revenge. Shield Slam is on a 6 sec cooldown, revenge is on a 5 sec cooldown, so ideally you'll only have 2 gcd's in between shield slam and revenge combos. If you use revenge first and are willing to sacrifice half a second, you can squeeze in a few more revenges. Not sure if that's better threat than using sunder twice, however.
---
But even so, with that rotation, it would take 15 seconds to get up to a full stack with only the tank stacking sunders.
---
Now the real question is if sunder is still worth using over heroic strike. This is a bit more difficult, because heroic strike is off the gcd, and is only used when you swing your weapon, and it's rage cost is higher than listed due to loosing the white strike rage. If you had unlimited rage, you would simply SS and Rev on cooldown, sunder in between, and heroic strike every attack. If you are rage starved, then its definitely better to use sunder over heroic strike, though make sure you keep rage for SS and revenge (and shield block if you need to use it to pop revenge). So, for this discussion to have any meaning, we have to assume you have enough rage for either heroic strike, or sunder, but not both.
---
The difference in threat is easy to calculate. Your white hit would do damage, and therefore generate threat, regardless, so all we're concerned with is the bonus damage for heroic strike, and the bonus threat from heroic strike. You could make the argument here that heroic strike also eliminates the 40% chance of glancing blows, and that will also boost your threat, but for the sake of simplification, I'll set that aside for now. Heroic strike does 138 bonus damage, and has 145 extra threat baked in. So that's 283 threat, multiplied by 1.495 (Def stance + Defiance) gives us 423.1 threat. Sunder does a flat 261 threat. So, per use, heroic strike gives more threat.
---
But you can use sunder once every gcd, while heroic strike is based on your weapon speed. Naturally, a faster weapon favors heroic strike, but let's pick 2.2 (speed for QS) for the sake of argument. With that speed, Heroic Strike spam will generate 192.3 threat per second. Sunder spam will generate 174 threat per second. So heroic strike spam wins again. By the way, the weapon speed where sunder overtakes heroic strike is between 2.4 and 2.5.
---
Finally, the last question we need to answer is if heroic strike is more rage efficient. I'm going to guess that it is not, but let's look at the numbers. Improved heroic strike (which you should take if threat is at all a concern) lowers the base cost to 12 rage. Now, the rage generated from a white hit is a bit tricky, but I've seen, non crit, between 6-9 rage, so let's pick 9 rage to be conservative. That makes the total cost of heroic strike 21 rage. Math gives us a threat/rage value for heroic strike at about 423.1/21 = 20.15. For sunder, it's simple: 261/15 = 17.4. So once again, heroic strike is the winner.
---
Sorry for this huge comment. I honestly hadn't done the math, so I wanted to figure it out and walk you guys through my thought process. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's a problem somewhere with my math.

Now we are talking about a good challenge

Does that really work?!

I rolled a male Nelf DK in WotLK and I almost stop playing because I found it silly that my character would spin at every attack
---
Ding ding ding
---
There's plenty of horde rogues to keep him company, don't worry

That's good enough for me! Flamelash was around 35/65 A/H before p2 when I stopped playing which was pretty bad as is, now it's a ghost sever for ally 🙃

Worst classes for gold farming?

Stares at the 13k gold in my bags...

Bots are banned in waves. Crying about it on Reddit isn't going to make the ban wave come any faster.

Hello from your favorite dwarf rogue.
---
-Angrybeard
---
It says damage but provides damage and healing. It has been tested.
---
I never believed this. Pservers always had something busted with them, whether it was a recipe that didn't work or a few quests with broken scripting or just straight busted scripts on bosses. There were always numerous pats, mechanics, and bosses that just didn't work the same they did in vanilla. Some mechanics were just straight guessimation, and other servers had bugs that made things perform far differently than anything I ran into from Vanilla to WotLK. Pretty much all the big ones were 1.12 anyways and phased content out like Blizzard while also cramming a shitload of people into a clown car of a server. That's not even talking about the admin drama that would kill servers or split them, or lead to FRESH bullshit. I was with the community starting back in Cata and Nost (which still had many problems) was an exception rather than a rule.
---
Classic is just better than those. Wpvp insanity has been the only time I haven't had absolute fun with it, and I still have BWL, AQ, and Naxx to look forward to. Private servers were literally the only alternative once, and now that I have something official, I have never felt a desire to go back to that form of Mickey Mouse bullshit.
---
Would OBE + edgemaster be a good idea or is 315 not worth pushing for?
---
Thanks!
---
I didn't ask what the point of selling pre-orders is. I asked what the point of buying pre-orders was.
---
Either way you choose, be sure to put Icy on the weapon and make a full cancer stick.
---
Holy shit it took hours of practice to get to 100gph farm?!?!?
---
Jesus dude that's some dedication right there..
---
It would not be the same. Someone using the term "biological father" gives insight to the relationship between the two.
---
At first but the itch to play other games is still there... the best thing I can say however is that with classic its creating a backlog of games that'll keep me busy for a while
---
&gt; Sucks that world pvp is pretty much dead
---
I wouldn't say dead. It's definitely died down, but I still run the occasional "patrol" and find alliance to duke it out with.
---
Yep. Updated yesterday. I think the latest is 1.19
---
I think it must be one of the best one for new players(out of the PVP realms). No streamers, not many super guilds, fairly big.
---
Not gonna happen. IIRC you need 300 people minimum, ranked, to get a rank 14.
---
Someone said they did a /who and it shows 21 players online for alliance. Total.
---
Took me 39 runs of undead to see carapace spine xbow
---
Yeah, so not worth trying it with 40 people with different latency.  Seems like a total waste of time on Classic, this was just a bug on private servers.
---
He emailed me the digital copy yesterday.. hard not  to look!
---
Big yikes, better now?
---
Any benefits of having multiple of the same class on a realm?
---
He does.. not sure how often though.
---
For me it was saying Prat was the issue but as other stated, just click on the minimap BG icon and enter battleground.
---
But I want it now!!!
---
Only if that was the ruleset we determined, everyone does it differently.  
---
I've seen rolling from 100  
---
I've seen rolling double the amount  
---
I've seen first to 1 loses   
---
I've seen first to 1 wins
---
In this group we just went with a random 5 digit number to have the possibility of a long game. Or, as in this case, a very very short one.
---
[Edited a little bit to be more pvp useful](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/30305001302-0505010402-05205103001)
---
It seems like such a small issue to be this concerned about
---
Oof, thalnos alliance is around 7-9k items XD
---
😥
---
So the amount of the roll is the wager? So if the first person rolls /roll 66 then whoever hits 1 first owes the other 66 gold?
---
This makes me wish that BGs weren't cross realm. I feel like the flamelash horde could take the consequences of their actions instead of getting bailed out by blizz.
---
It's both. In the old 1.12 patch notes it says:
---
&gt;+30 Spell Damage Enchantment: Fixed a bug with this enchantment which was preventing it from benefiting healing spells.
---
So unless it's botched again, it's ***supposed*** to give both spell damage and healing benefits.
---
Wut..mwho deathrolls with silver?  You deathroll the pot.  So if there's 275 gold on the table, the first person goes /roll 275.
---
I mean it's not amazing bc usually you start AoE gold farm at lvl 60.
---
They have 12 days between. They raid wednesday. Then wait until reset day and raid tuesday of the next reset
---
Thanks for the link, those maps are much more clear.
---
Happy for the Alliance, it's been rough on world bosses for you on our server :(
---
Yeah I tried that but it just didnt work out so far. I was wondering if this subreddit had a looking for guild place.
---
He spoiled it! But you still don't have the real thing so that's something to look forward to haha
---
I've definitely gone out less as well and that's saved me money in the short term.  However, most of my WoW buddies work dead end jobs with no drive to improve their life &amp; long term earning potential.  
---
Not to you directly but - I have a 60 main, 35 and 27 alt and I'm working on my masters degree part time while working full-time.  Don't let this game consume you to the point where your not bettering yourself outside of Azeroth like 90% of the people I know very well from the game do.   You can still game and further yourself.
---
 no
---
When horse does this most of the alliance raid afks out over and over where it gives us no chance to recover
---
Did Christmas come early this year and I missed it?
---
I started a priest and thought it did well for healing, but I feel like tanking is such a huge part of the game and priests are NOT very well equipped for that. I can definitely try by pulling a mob with mind blast and then spam smite to try to tank it, but I don't do very much threat and I don't have enough armor to take very much damage. I think priests are better as healers in groups where you can let a warrior be the tank.
---
Think you missed his point. They raid Tuesday one reset then Wednesday the next reset.. That way there are 13 days till the next raid.
---
1. Durotar. Sea, islands, beautiful sky, orcs and trolls togather, raptors, cactus apples, lazy peons, crocodile necklace, burning blade quests, leads to Barrens.
---
2. everything else
---
Spend a lot less money drinking, that's for sure
---
That's what we do here con classicwow it's literally one of the most useless subs.
---
Also to note- you can easily 5 man if you're just going to rend. Might cut down on loot competition. Going past rend sucks a fatty with less than 10 though.

150k gets you standing 25 on the biggest honor week of all when everyone is trying to get exalted in AV. Nowhere else will there be easier to rank up, and if 50 people migrate they can easily level 3-4 alts to lvl 10 and get 15 hk:s each in one wsg game. That will be many, many times faster than grinding the normal amount of required honor.
---
... u have 12 shamans in your raid?
---
I know.
---
And an Aurastone. My guild hasn't seen a single one of those drop in 10+ MC clears. But we keep getting that fucking dagger over and over and over...
---
Call J G Wentworth.
---
Not true. Every week that passes is less rank gained by everyone below the bots.
---
he got yat
---
An enemy can only have 16 debuffs on at one time. If you try to add another to an enemy that already has 16, it will either replace an existing debuff or not be applied.
---
Stormstrike isn't that useful to the raid, so it isn't worth the risk that it replaces a useful debuff.
---
Okay, so you want servers to all end up one sided, gotcha. You obviously don't understand the long term ramifications of this.
---
Maybe he was just looking for Mankrik's wife there...
---
Winning speed is related to how the pull on Drek goes. If Horde hasn't yet pulled Vann, but HAS solo capped towers, then there are additional mobs for alliance to handle. A very tiny bit of defence/delay can make rushing easier, even if Vann hasn't been pulled.
---
If only us shamans could wear plate. It's a shame the caster plate gear goes directly into vendor/DE for horde. But I guess some caster mail items also go to waste for you guys. Like the shoulders my shaman uses with nature SP. 
---
Suppose for PvE most everyone ends up wanting cloth for the higher stats at the cost of armor you shouldn't really need. So in that sense poor mage/priest/lock in having to share their drops.
---
Here is a guide on proper brd pp farm, this is what I do for gold
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sd-rgLRPGjVDhZy0M1_rx_kGmsLtAeuQ_mhzpvgWQqs/edit
---
We have 3 full raid groups.
---
I do SFK on my mage in less than 12 minutes including the vendoring and running back. You can enter the dungeon at level 10 and you get about 1 level every 3 runs if you do everything before the staircase to Fenrus. The ideal amount of people in the party is four to balance out group bonus vs. the XP splitting penalty.
---
I can attest, fishing is amazing.
---
An enemy can only has 16 debuffs active on it at any one point of time. Stormstrike isn't important enough to take a place.
---
Leveling my fishing from 250. At about 280 now
---
Oh man... I'd have to go through all of my comment history. If you want to find it maybe search through, keep going back to older dates, while doing Ctrl+F "Pat".
---
doh. i just woke up, the possibility of multiple raids didn’t even cross my mind. of course you do lol
---
I was going more for a Veruca Salt, but this works well.
---
In Classic, NPCs have a maximum of 16 debuff slots. If an enemy has 16 debuffs already and someone adds another debuff, one of the existing ones disappears. In a 40 person raid, it's very, very easy to use up all 16 debuff slots on an enemy. It doesn't matter much on trash, but it can have a big effect on bosses, because not all debuffs are created equal. The debuff that stormstrike does doesn't increase the damage against bosses much, and you could end up pushing off a debuff that does help a lot against an enemy like curse of elements or sunder armor.
---
You can google "wow classic debuff management" for examples of debuffs raids often shoot for and talk to your raid leader about it to see what debuffs your group is aiming for. But you're not the only class that has it's damage limited by the debuff limit, hunters usually don't get to do serpent  sting, for instance, and warriors don't get to use rend in raids.
---
99.9% worried about falling behind the pack are never going to reach Rank 11-14.  Don't worry about that shit.  So you miss a queue as Alliance?  It's instant queues anyway.
---
Great style reminds me of old Pokemon cards
---
Seems like you're talking about LOS checking on the client. Of course you can do many thousands of LOS checks per second, on the server too, but it's gonna be expensive.
---
During the development of WoW, during their first bigger performance test, I'm sure they've been in the situation where they see their servers are running at 100% CPU. Of course, they then proceed to profile the server process and they see that it's spending half the time in the raycasting function. I'm sure they've optimized it, but at some point they probably realized that if they just ignore all trees in the check, they can now have 2000 players online instead of 1000, before running out of server juice. 
---
Now I'm guessing everything is running in "the cloud", which makes another incentive to reduce CPU usage (you pay per unit of CPU time). 
---
By the way, LOS checking isn't just for abilities. The "AI" (if you can call it that in WoW), pathfinding, cheat detection, etc, will all be spamming LOS checks in large quantities.
---
That being said, there could be other reasons as well why trees (and many other objects) don't block LOS. For example, maybe they found that it would be too easy to abuse mob pathing if there were LOS blockers everywhere.
---
I MUST CONSOOOOOOOOOOOOME
---
Most people do, you could probably use some just from your comment.
---
Shits expensive though, reason why most won't.
---
If you resubbed for classic, you probably have a free character boost in retail.  You could boost a character instantaneously to level 100 or 110, and just run him down to BRD and explore until your hearts  content.
---
&gt; so doing it over and over seems like a terrible idea to me
---
The some thing can be felt about the zerg strat.  To some people the 'reward' isnt eeking out an extra 5% rep/honor per hour. Some players feel rewarded playing the game by taking objectives, denying the opposition towers, graveyards, etc..
---
One way to play the game is zerg with a premade, race to exaulted, and never go back to AV.  Another way is to play the BG how it was designed, cap towers, graveyards, kill LTs &amp; as many horde as you can.. neither is the 'correct' way and both are just as viable because... its a game and people have fun in different ways..
---
And there is a quest there to zap the elites and shrink them. If you don’t turn in that quest then you can get the item to make them non elite whenever you want to fish and they are in the way.
---
You have an arrow to switch to the next page.
---
Don't forget that post-Christmas sales are a thing too. Its worth waiting until next weekend at the earliest to see if you can find something decent on sale.
---
Yes indeed. Two birds with one stone
---
Yeah I'm leveling a warrior alt at the moment and am not looking forward to farm all these dreaded pieces.
---
A lot of runs, reference a map, try looking at a few maps since some will work better for you.  
---
It's sorta a 2 level dungeon, but how those 2 levels are split on a 2D map can vary a bit.  I had to look at a few after a few runs to make sense of it. 
---
It's a hard dungeon to memorize!
---
At this point, you're arguing semantics. Nearly everyone know that saying "spell power" specifically means the "spell damage and healing" line, while any variation of "healing", "+healing", or the very rare "healing power" specifically means increases to healing alone.
---
People are generally bad players, but not stupid. Most can use common sense despite colloquial variations.
---
The money I save on cooking is just way too good to pass up. That said, I'm currently essentially unemployed, aside from a few hours of tutoring every week. 
---
I did however do a ton of housing upgrades. If I factor in the money I saved by:
---
1. Not driving a lot
---
2. The house stuff I did
---
3. Cooking for my family
---
I should have saved about 2500-3000€ every month.
---
Media works the same way, lol
---
Sweet, better crack out the Nokia 3310
---
RNGesus Christ that loot.
---
Weird how people read about and complain about a game they presumably aren’t even playing?
---
Get a better PC.     
---
Should be glad so many people are playing.
---
Not worth it.
---
As a Human Warlock, I would 100% be a Night Elf Warlock if possible. The math says Gnomes are the better Warlock race, but math doesn't take into account the fact that being a Gnome is terrible.
---
Why is flamelash dead?
---
305 brings you down to only need 6%. IIRC 308 brings you down to need 5.1%, but you can't get 0.1% hit on gear so you're still back to needing 6% to be completely covered. The real benefit to being at 308 is you're at the glancing blow penalty reduction cap. No reason to go beyond 308.
---
are you level 60 and doing dungeons for gold? and what dungeons?
---
Mograine Alliance or Horde if you want a very high pop realm (Saw somewhere highest pop EU?) Ques happen at peak times on peak raidnights never över 15-20 min in my experience. Probably the most balanced high pop pvp server out there.
---
One of the few servers that would actualy have benefited from server specific ques!
---
from what i’ve heard the value of weapon skill over 307 declines dramatically and you’d be better off getting stats on your gloves
---
I don’t believe so. I’ve tuned in both and have never seen another totem drop that I could turn in.
---
Seems like a reasonable solution to the problem, RBG:s were like that so it isn't unheard of.
---
You pretty much need to be 60 for the aggro radius. You might be able to pull off 59 if you get lucky with enemy levels. I'm not 100% sure, but I think you would have too much trouble avoiding aggro.
---
Not worth the returns. OEB + gloves with dmg stats. If you have the gloves, keep them and use them with a better 2h later.
---
It’s not even Christmas yet
---
Is it so crazy to assume that your "main" is the character you primarily raid with? Because even if your guild has a main raid and a 2nd raid, it's hard to raid with two characters at once when there's more than 1 raid to clear per week. 
---
And it is weird to call your character a "main" when it's not geared and you don't raid on it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to do to raid with one character and play another more, but you shouldn't be surprised if calling your ungeared character that you don't raid on your "main".
---
Or use the free time IRL to do something else.
---
I mean, sure, but you'll never beat the guy that has just a little bit less of a life than you. Horde has a built-in break that everyone gets, and there isn't really much incentive to not take it. I'm not bothering to get rank but you're welcome to try and convince me that for those that are, never getting a break is a good thing.
---
Not necessarily a big problem. I've run UD Strat loads of times, so I don't always feel up to running again.  Our rogues/warriors ran Rend/Jed runs innumerable times at launch, enough that they can't really stomach grinding the place more (a one-off run for someone's attunements is fine).
---
It's one of the crappy things about being a little later to reaching max level. It sucks, but you cant really blame the others for wanting to chill on certain dungeon runs.
---
It’s normally x10 your wager so 66g would be /roll 660
---
I initially saw the nose/nose ring as a weird beak mouth thing and I can't unsee it.
---
Looks good other than my half asleep brain though!
---
Huh, that's a really good idea. Cheers!
---
ArkInventory does that.
---
Can we ban posts that want to ban posts about Flamelash-EU now? They are incredibly low value.
---
Binding, Aurastone, Gutgore and Batman helm.....
---
Anything above 307-308 is not worth at all.
---
Such a frustrating feeling.
---
Meh, most of the time we use the x100 rule as it makes for a slightly longer game.
---
Its 50/50 odds either you roll 1 or you dont
---
I thought about making a video with mind vision hopping around just looking for interesting things. Recently it seems that there is an issue when you mind vision a couple zones away. Hope they fix that, distance is supposed to be unlimited, dunno if it was truly unlimited in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Sounds like they just dislike LC in general.
---
I was in charge of the LC of the last guild I was in during retail for about 2 years, and am now in charge of the LC of my Classic guild. I enjoy LC, but I believe that the manner in which you try to use it creates confusion and hostility, as your judgement criteria are vague and arguably subjective.
---
The LC you desire makes everything far more personal than the LC that I desire. I look at the raw numbers, disregarding what the player is actually achieving with them. This means that I get to state facts via theorycrafting, rather than trying to vaguely try to factor in and combine a bunch of different factors and just hoping that the raiders will accept my logic. If the player is not performing to the extent that I am satisfied with, I will deal with that via other means than suddenly denying them loot on the spot.
---
so what? ask daddy blizz to play the game for me?
---
Yea but u dont need the buff. So was it ruined???
---
Haha this exact table dropped for me and my group as well. Everyone came for one of those 3 items and we each got it. It was crazy
---
Split work in theory, but only to any reasonable degree with personal loot you can trade - a leather split isn't going to do well when bosses drop 2-3 items and none of it is leather. You'd statistically get more weapons/trinkets for the raiders if you had a few loot sponges per raid - but it's going to be at least a year til any weapon comes out that rivals r14 weps. The fact is, hardcore PVE guilds are grinding r14 for PVE purposes - which was my only point. Whether you think it's optimal or not is a different issue, but I'd trust to giganerds in pserver speedrun guilds to have figured out the most optimal way.
---
Could just make a competition for rankings where world buffs are banned.
---
I used to go out and drink with friends a couple times a month. go to the movies etc. Now I just stay home and have a few glasses of whisky while I play on friday night. Id say I went from spending 300-400 a night on entertainment to about 70-80. Its been awesome and my wife loves me chillin and drinking at home
---
How much do you roughly earn per run? :)
---
By not assisting guild members in getting items such as Briarwood, your literally damaging your guilds experience.  Briarwood Reed is not replaced for a very long time and it's a significant boost to a players damage/heals.  This translating to better raiding for the whole guild when more players are outfitted.  Also, those players will make money and Garner favors for when they need things as well.   The whole, I've got mine so I'm not helping, is super cancerous to the community of this game.
---
I am in the exact same boat. I was doing very poor, financially speaking, because i also spent too much money on magic cards.
---
Since wow classic came out i managed not only to save money but even climb out of the negatives. Feels pretty good and is also motivating to keep playing!
---
I dont know how anyone can play a male nightelf tbh
---
It's really unclear to me how the spots are actually calculated.
---
I've made some rough calculations assuming the lower brackets are filled first and I end up with 1 Bracket 14 spot per 201 players and 1 Bracket 13 spot per 72 players. But there doesn't seem to be an exact answer online.
---
Just downvote and move on.  That's how reddit is supposed to be. 
---
If you want to see what a sub looks like that gives into complaints like this, go to /r/Japan or /r/JusticePorn.
---
Downvote and keep freedom alive.
---
This is how everyone does it, what am I missing?
---
The odds of winning death roll are 50/50 if you go first or second.
---
I guess so, you just need a horde priest
---
It was a deciding factor for me start back up. I devote my free time to WoW, not other hobbies.
---
Yea, both play styles are fun to play for this reason it’s a difficult choice.
---
Do it solo open world leveling only. Warriors are OP if they have heals but garbage without
---
18 yard range seems a bit excessive - we use 8 yard range.  We've been downing him before submerge since our second kill.
---
Druid dude. If you cant decide and you're not sure, go druid. I'm feral/resto. I could heal, tank and melee dps dungeons leveling up. I can stealth with a rogue buddy. I can tank dungeons for gold at 60 and get compliments for it. I go to raids to heal, and sometimes I get to OT. If you are into PvE, want a good leveling experience, get bored of doing one thing, druid is the answer. PvP though, probably gonna get your shit pushed in constantly. Other than healing, carrying flags or ganking mages and prot warriors. You are probably gonna lose.  I always hated druids and ragged on them back in the day. But playing the class and enjoying it for what it is, I like it. The true jack of all trades and only good at a couple is pretty accurate. Healing and dungeon tanking.
---
Those are the "I only enjoy myself if I win" options. If you don't mind being at a slight disadvantage, there are others.
---
In vanilla, when I would get to x8/9 I would play a few hours of BGs to take a break from the leveling process. You still get honor if you lose, most leveling specs are decent for PvP, and the disparity between twinks and non-twinks decreases as you go into higher brackets. Once you get bored of PvP, you can level again.
---
Worth noting that you might want to hit honor level 3 by 40, since it gives a 10% discount on your mount.
---
As the warlock dot stuff. As the Druid heal the warlock and ot pet.
---
Black Stallion
---
Good point yet warlocks will also eventually have a hard time with getting geared since most of their best pieces after ZG are not tier items but non-set items.
---
Difference from what? I'm glad for your guild, Rag record on raidlogs is 2.29 on our server from Hardcore guilds, this might be a way to make the fight easier for any guild/Pug struggling with Rag :)
---
Honestly just find populated mobs and kill them. It only takes 3 or 4 hours per level just grinding mobs fast with a movie on. My warrior went from 19 to 41 this past 6 days from killing mobs alone
---
Noted will do
---
I know right? This is a god damn community game! Playing with the people in your guild is what makes this game what it is.
---
My guild does split MC with 25 people per raid, both raids down Rag before phase 2.
---
MC = Joke
---
yes, I made an earlier post and then I realised how badly frased it was and decided to delete it and remake it since I realise no one would understand my question with my previous post. Hope its clarifies
---
I was just teasing!! I hope you have a great time in classic!
---
For wsg id go ES. TUF is way better 1v1 or in giant av battles. ES shines in small group fights or AoE trash in dungeons
---
Take a shadow priest with you, Mind Control in there is one of the most fun places to use the ability.
---
I am completely going to blow up my spot on this one, but nobody will read this thread, so here goes.
---
Queue in TB and run around killing swoops, selling 5 small eggs for 1g in AH, it isn't much, but it is honest work.
---
Why would you buy something you can just grab two friends and go farm?
---
I agree with all the advice so far. Atlas maps and looking things up beforehand help a bunch.
---
I'd also say figuring out what you're there for helps a ton. Before you start, figure out exactly what bosses/events you want to do. Is it just Prison/Arena/Angerforge then done? Or is it a full lower-city quest run?
---
Once you've decided on what it is you're doing. Set out the order out loud in chat. For example, a 'full run + key quest':
---
Arena -&gt; Angerforge -&gt; Golem Lord -&gt; Phalanx -&gt; Backtrack for Key Quest -&gt; Snake Man -&gt; Chest of 7 -&gt; MC Attune -&gt; Golem Dude -&gt; Emp
---
(I'm not the best with names)
---
Then if anyone thinks something they want is missing they can say so. And you can start mentally planning out the route in your head.
---
Oh tootsie, breathe. We all want to play differently. Shaming people for not enjoying 1.5 hour death walks to BRD is not a cute look. At the end of the day the issue IS the community not the game. I’ve never went on about the community because I’ve played “servers-that-shall-not-be-named” since 2012 and it is like this on every private server. It always starts great, honor gets released and the dominant faction makes it unplayable for the smaller faction, people quit, server dies. It’s honestly what I expect from wow at this point. Having paid or unpaid server transfers just means people don’t have to quit and can continue playing on a different server. You may not like it because you have a guild with people who probably have the same or near the same play times as you so you can travel in packs etc. A lot of people who play are older and don’t have that luxury and romanticized what wpvp was like back in the day (which it could never be and will never be again). So you see, your idea of fun is different from someone who can play an hour or two every other day. By all means stay on your unbalanced server but don’t force some poor soul from xferring to a PvE server just so he can run BRD. 
---
Also 60/40 is literally 50% MORE of the other faction. You do realize that right?
---
Adding content to the game will not make the game worse for me, it will make it better. I look forward to having enough raid content to last multiple days a week.
---
I was killing Omokk solo for the gem but managed to get the pants. Still no gem :\ and soloing takes a long time.
---
They offered free transfers off and all of the allies took it
---
Piss cup for raids? Nice.
---
I think you can follow them, it takes a lot of practice, but I am very sick of hearing "well here's my spec, but you can do it in [bad solo farm spec]" or "here's my purp gear, here I am doing it this farm, but you can do it in greens".   
---
lol prove it, run Warlock DME solo in SM/ruin in greens on tape with no edits 5 times in a row with no wipes.
---
I guess i've just lucked out and have dodged every instance of this
---
1.5h seems reasonable, a friend did 20 min and i did close to 6h. But it's still easy to get.
---
Couple wipes and that's gone.
---
You are being crusaded as a bad person because you are a self centered, selfish person. And as a raid leader your attitude is spread to your guild. You seem to be the type of person to loot and scoot, once you get your piece of gear everything is fine and other peoples shit don’t matter. What’s next? Once you get all your MC and BWL is out, are you gonna day “we aren’t doing MC anymore since I don’t need anything, maybe you should of of gotten your gear like I did”
---
Bigglesworth is great! I can vouch that open world leveling is totally fine as Alliance
---
877-CASH-NOW
---
Mages are also rich
---
Undying
---
I will have to start doing that once I get enough gold for epic mount from DM farming.
---
I assumed since you are posting here and have the word “manages” like it’s a miracle melee can do the one mechanic they have to do, there would be some kind of difference between the video and every other guide/way it’s done.
---
True but eventually the warlock won’t get gear that easily since 1) more locks will be brought to the raid for say AQ and Naxx and 2) BIS stop being tier related and a more non-set pieces.
---
I've come to the conclusion that actually winning AV isn't that important for alliance (although it is a nice bonus).
---
What's important is getting as much honor as you can before either alliance or horde ends the game (which you only want to last 20 mins regardless of which side wins so you get 3 games/hr).
---
 I'd like to see more alliance capping towers/LTs/Commanders and then pushing on Drek. Inevitably you'll end up with like 10 horde on defence, so a massed up push is necessary usually to break to RH. Alliance seems to do well in the initial stage but has a hard time after they wipe and usually fail to take objectives due to all the GET SOUTH, ZERG DEREK talk in chat.
---
Galv &gt; LTs/Commanders/Towers &gt; FWGY &gt; RH &gt; Drek. If you die, try to ride south, if you can't then ghostrun to FWGY and join the push after you take it.
---
let the zoomers bleed out and keep recruiting, eventually you have a core of people who play not raidlog

---
My commiserations my dude
---
I'm so thirsty
---
To be honest, if you just stuck one person is base to do all hand ins this would probably be an awesome way to grind rep. I assume that 80% of rep hand ins just rot in bags or on corpses. Of course pugs will never be this kind of organized.
---
The most wealthy players make their money off the AH and the AH alone. Not grinding or farming.
---
OP was just asking where a good place to farm fires are considering online drop rates are inaccurate. You went on some tantrum about how its dumb and there are better ways to make money. I disagree because I can farm 10-12 fires in less than an hour and that's 40-50 gold I dont have to spend. Why would I rather pug and get paid and risk nothing dropping worth a damn, or risk having to do 2-3runs just to buy a couple fires? That's backward logic dude. 
---
I mean hell you can literally sit at the AH flipping for 4 hours and make a couple hundred gold. Pug'ing should never be for gold, unless you are after rare items.
---

---
Hitting 60 takes roughly 6 to 8 days. That's more than an hour a day since Classic released. Clearly, your idea of "casual" is skewed.
---
The game is not for you? Get out of here, you elitist prick.
---
So what’s the problem?
---
Awesome!
---
No one to blame but the allies crying and running away
---
Astrall Recall to either Gadgetzan to fish or Winterspring to mine.  I kind of enjoy the queues, gives nice little farm breaks in between the PVP grind.

75g?! wait what? ROs are 35g here in Ten-Storms EU

It's only better when it's not on CD, I'd still try to get reed for the downtime.

Now you will roll 1s and lose deathrolls
---
For us, the real mageblade is better than this fang
---
Haha....ganked 3 times in 15 minutes.
---
Actually not true, and the starting roll # means nothing.  Long term the first person to roll will lose a very small fractional amount of gold getting closer and closer to zero the more times you roll, but will never reach zero.
---
You know you can get all 12 if you stand in the right spot and use vanish?

Because it’s 2019 you aren’t allowed to complain if someone is doing a shitty job.

pvp on pve server is a dead meme that only happens this early on, there will be next to 0 wpvp now bgs are out and it will continue to drop whereas pvp will always have raids wiping raids and world bosses and contesting farm spots, the game without wpvp is boring imo unless you only play a couple hours a week in which case yes go pve

"Plagued with bots", "People are just cheating "........"On our server we only have one".
---
Sensationalism at its best.
---
You know why Blizz wont do anything? There is an in game AFK reporting tool, use it and he gets removed from BG and gets a debuff.
---
I have not seen any bots in the Oceanic realms. Have seen lots of people afk and they have been reported and removed, but not bots, looks like they are not plaguing us.

I'm gonna go ahead and say the one who writes a paragraph projecting their insecurities on other random people on a 9 day old thread is the sensitive one :D :D

plz dont give blizztard any ideas

You guys started to hold your own a bit before BGs came out. Marty and his crew we're wrecking UC and Dire Maul had been a pain for a while.
---
I wouldn't mind some more alliance though on the server to even it up a little bit more.
---
I just hit 60, but in my 50s was doing a lot of WSG. Normally the majority of the groups weren't lvl 59 in that bracket. I'm guessing the lower brackets are mostly x9 though since a lvl 52 stands a better chance against a 59 than a level 12 stands against a 19.
---
I agree.  I also will add it is also viable for us to publicly shame them for doing so to the point of blacklisting them from doing trials if they harm a fellow guildie in this manner.
---
have a hunter alt
---
u can farm brd w stealth pickpocket and kill 2 bosses, but the pickpocket resists + having to wait for vanish cooldown makes it reaaaaally annoying
---
I've been cleaning UP on rep in these longer games. Soooo close to exalted and I just couldn't let myself stay up to finish last night. But I'll probably still roll AV, I've been having an absolute blast in these matches recently, lots of pvp and objective wrangling. It'll just be nice to do it w/o the ulterior motive of maxing out my rep.
---
Not really. I managed to take a screenshot similar to OP's of my High population realm at 3 or 4 am where there was 1 person sitting in Ironforge. Most people were just doing AV.
---
10k rolls is nothing in statistics you need to get into the millions to have accurate data and the lower the starting roll the more variance so the larger a sample you need to be accurate. However in all examples the same thing will happen, the first person to roll will lose some amount of gold per roll getting closer and closer to zero the more rolls you do but never actually reaching zero (reaching zero is a true 50/50)
---
mass better than krol lol
---
Yea it’s definitely reasonable for a multi billion dollar company to cater to your every whim
---
can you go pve to pvp?
---
But what is not predictable is the loot drops. Take Maraudon as an example, where the drops from Princess varies from 80s-4g or something. But other than that I agree completely with what you said
---
You um, you know it's still real life right? You're still making the decisions that impact others. Inb4 "it's not real money" neither is the US dollar since it's just fiat currency anyway 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
How many "look at my /roll" posts do you guys think this sub gets a day?
---
SteAmeRs uSE iT.
---
You can probably solo level in plague lands now.  Once you hit 56-57 or so LBRS boss runs are not bad experience, either, if groups are running it, plus you can try to get your UBRS key and BIS gear.
---
Mage wins because of Teleport alone, imo.
---
The BF helm is barely if at all better than NS, especially for daggers. BF pants are a bit better than NS, but not by a lot. Just use NS helm, chest, bracers, belt and boots. Since you are daggers, you want ACLG for gloves. +10 energy is good for Rag since you can energy cap when you run out, but it’s pretty useless for any boss where you just dps the whole way through and never energy cap.
---
I'm not a hunter, but fair do's! if they have the DKP and Bid higher than the hunter does, then great!
---
That didn't make any sense.
---
I had a ridiculous game last night where no one was defending, and no one was on O. Like, this isn't even exaggeration, there were 3 or so in the base and like 5 pushing north... We wiped the ally at Galv and I thought we were in good shape, oh how wrong I was. Seeing 20+ people running around the field of strife solo was just stupid, and I LIKE playing long games, just, you know, while actually hitting the damn objectives or at least playing for a freaking win.
---
According to sixtyupgrades' stat equivalences, strength is worth twice as much as agility for a fury warrior. So you've got 9str/9agi vs 20agi, and the 9str is essentially 18agi. 27agi &gt; 20 agi.
---
How did your guild let you tank as shaman? I’m guessing off tank as well?
---
Why did they leave? I left my first guild do to a bad loot council, the warrior class officer who was determining prio was clueless and was barely putting any effort in. Was raid logging back in october and barely farmed any of his gear, like he was the worst geared warrior there. I went to leadership to discuss his prio mistakes and was told to fuck off and i dipped. They've had a mass exodus of warriors since and they're constantly spamming trade chat to recruit more. It feels good.
---
You guys don’t force your paladins to spam run you through dungeons on your alts?
---
looked like pats
---
I usually do a 1-2 hours worth of BRD PP + relic coffers a week. I’ll do one run on an off raid night for 30-45 mins maybe a full hour and then sometimes a second run later that week.
---
I PP everything from the left gate up through the golems and to the Relic coffers, then I PP everything I can to the fire enchant pyromancer dude, solo and loot him, then PP the area above arena and back down to the entrance. Run out, reset and do it again.
---
I don’t respec for this so if I get unlucky with PP resists this can very much hurt your GPH.
---
You can easily make 40-50g an hour with sometimes getting more with BoEs. And honestly if you AH the blinding powder you can probably make 60-70g. I usually come out with 2-4 stacks of BP and it sells for 3.5g a stack on my server.
---
There is the off chance of blue boes from the coffers but it’s super rare. On average each coffer key is worth 75 silver so don’t pay more than 30 silver for these keys. I usually buy a bunch up when they hit 25 silver a pop. I bought about 160 keys between 20-25 silver per key last week. I still have 40 left.
---
You can just do Relic coffer runs if you want, it’s much faster, but less gold overall and you can only do 5 runs an hour. So if you bought 55 keys for 30 silver a pop, you’re only going to come out with roughly 25 gold profit. If you could snag 55 keys at 20 silver a pop you’ll walk out with a 30g profit.
---
However if you combine PP run, plus killing the pyromancer, and the coffers you can make a lot more raw gold it just won’t be crazy efficient GPH. If you respec you’ll get a lot more efficiency but obviously you lose money on the respec costs so I would only respec if I had a lot of keys and wanted to set aside 4+ hours to farm BRD or multiple sessions over multiple days.
---
Warlock isn't bad either.
---
Hi
---
I jumped off teldrasil the other day. Made it all the way to darkshore
---
Natural selection
---
Tellmewhen is a basic one without too many bells and whistles.
---
I wasn't talking about totems specifically, just in general with macros and scripts and stuff.
---
over 46 AV games the past 4 days: 
---
Got Galv: 40/46 
---
Lost: 40/46
---
Won: 6/46 
---
Yea if there are premades no one on alliance gets to see them.
---
Yo man I posted this at 4 am my time after a hella long game session words get typed what can I  say
---
IIRC that quest is repeatable right?
---
it gets a bad rep due to people's dislike for asmon and other streamers but there are enough non-streamer guilds around to make it enjoyable
---
its about 40/60 alliance to horde ratio though. since bg's opened leveling out in the world isn't as bad as it was in p2. it's nice being on a very active server if you play at off-peak hours often, but there are definitely queues during the busy hours (but not as bad as it used to be)
---
Why wouldn't there be competition? It's just fewer people. Who's to say they're not as competitive as the average player?
---
Thats what she said
---
&gt;impossible alliance are already at a 10% winrate the past week in **randoms**
---
Yeah I dunno about others here but what you just said is pretty dumb to me.
---
AV queues are going to be a thing forever, whereas world bosses are once every few days with the chance at being the party that kills it... Any end game player would drop a simple queue to kill azuregos. I dunno what you're smoking but I want some of it
---
We looked an hour for a tank and finally agreed to “all orbs reserved”.. dropped 6 orbs -_-
---
I bet blizztard is gonna fix this one eventhough theyve intentionally left certain bugs in the game because "thats how vanilla was"... not all bugs though, only some.
---
\#nochanges roflmao
---
Haha this reminds me of that key and Peele episode "proud thug"
---
I always queue First Available, and have not yet entered a game in progress really. Always new ones. Halfway to exalted, so did do quite a few games already. I am horde.
---
Is that a thing?  Guilds race to kill rag first after reset?
---
U lose
---
I’ve been abusing the queue time to farm stuff and get a free teleport back to Org.
---
&gt; this was just a bug on private servers.
---
It’s literally in the list of known issues posted by Blizz. It should work like it did on pservers.
---
Without being kind of a try-hard, non-HoR Enhancement shamans have enough trouble staying above the tank in damage. You absolutely cannot skip Stormstrike. If the raid is accepting enough to bring a melee shaman, they need to accept that you will be using a debuff slot. Just don't use flame shock, or earth shock until the tank has a _tremendous_ threat lead over you.
---
In 5-mans you can get away with the Elemental Devastation build with under 8% hit from gear. If you plan to raid and can only manage 5% hit from gear, you should be using 5/32/14 - the damage is more consistent anyway.
---
Being a respectable enhancement shaman in raids is not a cakewalk. Chugging major mana potions and dark/demonic runes is **mandatory**. 
---
Unless your gear is garbage and they are bringing you along specifically to carry you, don't let them convince you to totem twist. It's such a marginal benefit that your own dps should be greater than the benefit of +70 agi on a few other dps.
---
Look up Holderhek's guides.
---
Not really. I simply would to lnow why you think that's bannable?
---
Do the Winterspring E'kto quests and kill the elite giants and bears.  Each E'tko from those sells for 1 to 3g, depending on day of the week.   Best thing, you both get one, so can join other farming groups or duo them.
---
Lol That's where you're wrong. Most people are there for honor. The people grinding exalted have pretty much bottomed out.
---
Says who?
---
&gt;  I’ve never went on about the community because I’ve played “servers-that-shall-not-be-named” since 2012 and it is like this on every private server. It always starts great, honor gets released and the dominant faction makes it unplayable for the smaller faction, people quit, server dies.
---
Oh come on, how are you going to spout lies when you know there's a good chance I myself have played on said servers and know that is not true. I played on almost all of the most popular vanilla pservers from Feenix to Kronos to Nost to Elysium/Lightbringer to Northdale. NONE of them had bad faction balance issues and most definitely none of them died due to said issues. It amuses me that you would lie about something so easily verifiable.
---
If you want to play differently, you're just in luck! There's a server type just for you, it's called PvE! If you made the mistake of not rolling there in the first place that should be on you to reroll. Especially since you seem to be so well versed in these faction balance issues from your pserver experience, it really perplexes me as to why you would roll on a PvP server, hmm....
---
Once things are obviously screwed, people are very quick to blame everyone but themselves, and ditch the game. 
---
Why? I don't know. Debuff seems inefficient, but hey. Worst case, go fishing. It'll be over soon, and now you have fish.
---
Not atm, but back in the day of 2005 it saved me a lot. Wow was the only game I played for 3-4 years.
---
As a former Grand Marshal you can’t ask that. R13s think about it too much already. 
---
Was also a War.
---
You are one sad man :)
---
Bonanza
---
I would actually sticky all the Flamelash posts from here to eternity, only to serve as a testament to certain people's and/or companies' sheer stupidity and shortsightedness.
---
5/5
---
Yeah pretty much me too. Have only done drugs once since WoW and drinking has gone way way down
---
FML, I ran arena 100± times, saw Sash drop 6 times, lost every roll and decided to pick up Clutch of Andros instead. Also lost a roll on that before I got it.
---
Now I have Felheart Belt and Sash of Whispered Secrets but I still use the Clutch for trash so I miss less banishes. =p
---
Don't argue with him, he's been watching "how to: mage solo farming" videos on youtube!
---
This advice is what you should do.
---
Go to the Alliance AV quest NPCs right now. Look at the Horde side and look at the Alliance side.
---
Tell me which side is corpse camping around the clock.
---
It probably wouldn’t work on flamelash though. There’s a minimum participation required to rank. If there aren’t enough people to fill the lower ranks it literally becomes impossible.
---
There we go, question answered! Thank you!
---
Do you not see the broken system here... you are fine with hunters taking melee weapons over melee classes and melee classes taking ranged weapons over ranged classes. This is why even though dkp exist, there are loot tables for every item to stop idiots like you who see nothing wrong with this
---
Thrash* :)
---
Thought you needed 500 or so qualifying members to even be able to rank? If this is really true I might do this
---
Some of us (definitely not me) don't have any friends (again, not me, I have lots).
---
At the risk of getting brigaded, did anyone else have a seriously toxic chat experience yesterday?  I feel like the political trolls were out in full force and it was unbearable.  People are losing their goddamn minds
---
Rank 10 orc female shammy on boulder.  Gôt❤
---
Well, that's nearly every PvP server for Horde so far anyway. If they were unhappy about it they would've transferred a long time ago.
---
What is the best way to find an alliance premade AV group to run with?
---
I have two exalted toons, both MC geared, mage (mageblade, etc.) and pvp warrior (oeb, etc.) that I’m looking to get ranks with.
---
Imagine wanting Brutality Blade as a hunter
---
Well that's how windfury works and why people favor slow weapons. I'm happy to explain in more detail if there's part of it that specifically doesn't make sense.
---
There are two viable builds: 5/32/14 (3% hit from resto) and 19/32/0 (elemental devastation).
---
Use 5/32/14 until you have 8% hit from gear alone. After that point, ED is more damage and burstier.
---
I have a very supportive guild with lots of people offering to help farm it.  We got a couple groups together for it but no luck.  I ended up buying mine for 350 gold.  Even with the offers of help it took a long time to actually get people together.  Soloing was really slow.
---
Doing quests at 60 was good gold for me as holy, especially in EPL and Winterspribg.  I also picked herbs along the way.  Also healing fast dungeon groups adds up the gold.  Be sure you have lots of empty bag space so you can keep all the greys though!  Consider getting guild groups together to run strat live for orb drops to fund the eye.  
---
Good luck!  I am enjoying mine so much.
---
it's not that the mobs are too hard to kill at lower levels, it's mostly the aggro range that i find to be a bit of a problem
---
Drop skinning, pick up herbalism. Will take a bit to level it up, but you will reap significant profits from herbing and mining alongside. Herbing more than mining, but might as well do both at the same time.
---
Also, simply tanking dungeons and selling the crap that drops can make you a decent bit of money. If you don't need gear from a dungeon, and someone needs a tank, you can offer to tank it for a fee of some sort. Depends on how desperate they are and how confident you are. If people pay for a tank, they expect one that knows what they're doing.
---
I would be fine if Blizz changed things to coerce the rushfest into actually doing fun stuff instead of mindlessly grinding.
---
It's simple although it doesn't describe me. Most of the no lifers are grinding honor and can't afford to miss a single AV Q or they'll drop a bracket in the standing. It's the same no lifers that were scouting Azzy/Kazzak 24/7 and would most likely get the tag/kill.
---
At least that's how I see it. There are plenty of Horde who don't care about Honor/AV but are not as likely to scout World Bosses 24/7 and will miss their chance even if they wanted to go.
---
STONKS
---
Best answer would be to look up a drain tanking guide.
---
My other points are still valid tho.
---
(IDK why this response is to me lol)
---
You are amazing. Thank you so much for this, it was driving me nuts.
---
Today i plugged in my usb the correct way on my first try (0.0483%).
---
Time is the most valueable commodity you will have in life. So no, playing wow is financially not a good desicion. Sure its better than spending money, but its still ....
---
One of the reasons I hate M+ is because since it's timed it just reinforces the bad behavior "gogogo" type of stuff from people.  Skip packs that can be asspulled (and then complain if they are rather than you know taking the 30s to kill the mob and avoid it), rush through as much as possible.
---
Trying to e-sport PVE was bad enough, but the way they did it just takes the stuff everyone hated from before (the gogogo mindset) and puts it at the forefront.
---
That's how I got in, loads of people jumped through and died in the lava due to the instance not spawning. Another survived by popping a GFPP. On guy zoned into MC dead, I ressed him and he ressed outside in the lava and instantly died.
---
I just hopped up onto the windowledge and healed myself from the Alliance until I zoned in.
---
If people would play on the unbalanced servers then maybe they wouldn’t be unbalanced for long...
---
My “main” is the character I spend the most time on and enjoy the game the most with. 
---
My guild gets MC and Ony done in about 2 hours. 
---
For me it’s weird to call a character I spend 2 hours a week on a “main”, and a character I spend 20-30 hours on a week an alt. 
---
I guess people prefer to judge everything and each other by gear primarily.
---
&gt; You ever hear of guns don't kill people, people kill people?
---
Well contrary to local politics game designers are literally gods when it comes to their world. The human elements have free will, but everything else, including steering the gameplay development through incentives is up to them. Not to mention that playing a tiny part of destroying a server balance can hardly be compared to killing other human beings. The moral difference between those two is so huge that they can't be compared.
---
Games always have tried to optimise their game play to be as quick and efficient as possible. And that's not just a thing of today. The designers of Ultima Online [faced a similar problem](https://massivelyop.com/2018/01/06/richard-garriott-talks-about-how-players-destroyed-ultima-onlines-ecology/) where their clever thought out mechanic was ruined by their players.
---
&gt;increase their clear times
---
:thinking:
---
Working on my Hunter alt and this is the part I dread the most. Hoping I get the same kind of luck
---
I don't know, I've had a positive AV win rate forever bascially.
---
Thanks captain obvious. Now go apply that logic in the real world and work 24 hours a day. Ow no...wait
---
lol it's okay to be mean to corporations
---
&gt; Rag record on raidlogs is 2.29 
---
Jesus. I thought our server was slow because its kinda small ... but damn, that's your server's *record time*?
---
My server is the 3rd smallest PvP server, yet it has [31 guilds with a faster record](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/rankings/5059/1000#metric=speed&amp;boss=672)
---
You could kill hordes of non-elite mobs, given that the warlock just needs some heals over time and the Resto can go bear at times to tank if you have a few too many hitting the lock.  Druid is the primary looter and you can split the items later, Warlock focuses on just doing constant damage either through dotting a few targets at once or just big nukes with dat shadow boltzzzzzzz
---
And you think cfc is allowed?! LMAO
---
I have a spare Lenovo 15" laptop with an Intel i3 8ª gen, 4GB of RAM, an SSD and obviously Intel HD graphics and it can run Classic "fine" at lowest settings. 
---
I would go with the others recomended, get an R5 2500u at least, not sure if the newest 3500u are out yet. The iGPU solution on them is much much better at the moment than Intel's iGPU.  
---
They are cheap too, 300 to 400€ which would fall within your budget.
---
Rewind come back to Firemaw surely it's better here Kapp
---
Sweetie I’m talking before some of those existed. That’s all easily verifiable? Why don’t you use Google before typing? But I’m sure you know all about those too right? Like 50-100 people Swedish servers that existed way waaaay before the mainstream American player servers. Also I’m not talking about myself but sticking up for those people who want to xfer and you’re against xferring. Stop being delusional. You truly believe that this PvP server experience was expected by even 50% of those who rolled PvP? You sound very entitled and very young so this will be my last response as I don’t think anything I say even if I post it with links proving my point would get through to you. Good day.
---
Dun Morogh is my favorite as well, and it's honestly one of the best zones for beginner skinning and mining. 
---
Teldrassil is both lovely and fun right up until you do the quests in the barrow down for the first time. It's like a warning to leave Kalimdor as quickly as possible. *Amazing* first beginner alch/herb though.
---
I also agree about Elwynn. It also helps that it's connected to three other major low level questing zones. No other starting zone can compare that way.
---
Did you use both chars at the same time for subtle benefits?
---
We get it.. a server died.. it definitely won't be the last.
---
It only takes a couple accidental pet pulls and the 20G barely covers the repair bill :O
---
Damn, im on GANDLING-EU and just rewatched raidlogs, horde side only has 1 guild that has done it im 2:01 and rest is 2.26+
---
You can have both talents maxed, you just dont max out the off hand damage talent, it dosent matter a ton since you are daggers.
---
Mr Ed
---
I don't think there's any judgment, there's just different things people mean when they use the word "main". 
---
To you it means where you spend your time more than who you raid with. To some others it means your primary raiding character. It's just a misunderstanding between the way people use a word that doesn't have a single definition to everyone.
---
So, for a fury warrior, the very rough, napkin match dps conversions is 1% crit = 30 AP. Using that, 1 agi is worth 1.5 AP (1.65 for alliance, due to BoK). 1 point of strength gives 2 AP (2.2 if alliance). Therefore, with the 1% hit being a wash, the Bloodmail boots have the equivalent of 34.65 AP while the windreaver greaves have the equivalent of 33 AP. Therefore, the bloodmail boots win (albeit barely).
---
To get a more concrete answer, you would need a dps spreadsheet, input your spec, gear, and rotation, and then swpa between the boots to see the difference. For example, when I do this with those two boots, I find that Bloodmail gives me around 1-1.5 extra dps.
---
when +15 agi to 1h comes out its a great weapon for a hunter
---
I think its either 4/5 or 3/4 on the off hand talent, I forget how many points it takes.
---
Just roll a stealth class and go mine arcane crystals in silithus. No stress and requires hardly and attention. Just open up netflix on second monitor while auto running
---
I was doing a quest that involved a lot of mobs and a lot of times two would agro. I died... when I returned there was a Tauren warrior there and we took turns aggroing and getting the exp and drops. We must have worked together for more than 30 minutes before we parted ways with respectful salutes. It was fun. I saw an Orc fighting three or four mobs and getting the worst of it and jumped in (I was way higher than the Orc) and killed them, saving him. He saluted me... I am on a PVE realm, so most of the time things are pretty mellow.
---
all classes are viable in raids and pvp. so i'd choose warlock, hunter or mage for leveling
---
Thanks! :)
---
But admin and the Barney YouTube video popularized it more
---
Because you gain nothing. It's Molten Core, you can clear it in 1 hour without any consumables or buffs.
---
The amount of time spent running around the world and cordinating people for different buffs, is higher than the time you reduce of your overall clear time.
---
It's really not. The "weaker" version of the same class has two different spells, neither are game breaking, and neither are core to the class experience. If you are fine with looking at a character model for literal months straight just because it has fear ward then good for you. This isn't like if human warriors were the only ones that could dual wield. We're talking about an extra spell that sees use on SOME fights, all of which are not even that advanced. Shit if your tank knows how to hit his stance buttons you can mitigate 90% of the utility of FW.
---
I will never not upvote comments that shit on the mods. Hoorah!
---
I have a 60 undead mage, 40 undead priest, 40 orc hunter.  
---
My goal was to have two classes to switch between.
---
No tho. I want to try alliance (yes, mostly because of bg queues). But I would like to play Warlock or Rogue . The two classes i feel is stupid to roll on alliance because of orcs and undead=/
---
Lucifron - not fire immune  
---
Magmadar - not fire immune  
---
Gehennas - not fire immune  
---
Shazzrah - not fire immune  
---
Sulfuron - not fire immune  
---
Golemagg - not fire immune  
---
Majordomo mobs - not fire immune
---
Seven out of ten bosses you should be dropping fire nova totem, magma totem, or searing totems. If the debuff slots are available, you should be using flame strike. If the tanks have plenty of threat to spare you should be using earth shock.
---
Yep, it's really nice when you start getting stat heavy gear in bwl and can replace all that +AP
---
It's not even remotely close to the alliance one
---
Sorry for being unclear there. No, we are in our low 30s atm. We have higher mains though so money is no problem ;-)
---
I mean that’s what you’re supposed to do...
---
How would that be different than raiding on Thursday and Friday, giving people the same 5 days to spec to PVP/Grind?
---
Buying things, especially entertainment, is never financially responsible.
---
That is my logic applied in the "real world". I have no idea why you're so upset by this.
---
I hear you. Makes sense.
---
Tauren Warrior bros!!!
---
I rogue tanked scholomance as a raid geared combat dagger rogue and two 58 arms warriors as dps, a 60 mage, and a 60 preist. My healer buddy is good though. I know strat is "harder" but you can easily get by off meta with a little coordination. Dps warrior can easily be taken in place of a tank while putting a shield on only for bosses.  Dont give in to the BS.
---
Has zero spellpower on it why the fuck would I want that trash
---
Vann is basically never tanked outside his main chamber, because horde have to kill all the marshals anyway (you can do it with just 2, but nobody is coordinated enough for that.)
---
I love PVE... makes life so much simpler and enjoyable.
---
what does mt mean? (outside of the context of main tank, because i see people using it in contexts where 'main tank' would make no sense)
---
Troll hunter with Rhok'Delar - what hit % do I need for PvE now? 
---
I've read for melee that +5 weapon skill gives 3% hit, is this for yellow attacks or white as well?
---
&gt; the problem is that the threat addons

I hate snitchers more than hackers
---
This is just prices I have seen from two consecutive nights checking the AH on Azuresong. I'm not sure if this is the average price or I caught it at a low-supply time.
---
Thanks. Decent gear is no problem.
---
Mage is the obvious choice for pvp, warlock for raiding.
---
You'll have a very happy shaman with those Garr drops!
---
... I guess your main tank will be pleased too i suppose.

You were to obsessed with the "can i" and forgot the "why"
---
yes LFG chat was obnoxious. my ignore list got much longer
---
Sure, I plan to rank with my warrior.
---
What’s a steamer?
---
Right? I’m ally on Kirtonos, and I love this shit. The game is naturally changing in response to popular trends and the moves of the other faction. Started with ally running Zerg and when horde responded, ally started losing, now it’s all fucked as people figure out new strats. I’m all for it.

This. Seriously this. Then buy it.
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
How do I get into this? Tired of bad pugs
---
In the spirit of this thread: it wont be worth it in your mid 50s because your damage is too low and you run into the risk of pulling something on the way to her.
---
That's not what you said at all in your first comment though...
---
Exactly the situation described in post. If your class doesn’t have small hitbox - good luck getting to graves. And then, after 10 deaths, you are at grave place. Couple of resists/one mistake - you are dead and should do it again. Tried it on 42 with troll, having best AH gear for farming - it was a disaster.
---
I don't think live strat is harder than scholo (I would consider it among the easiest "end game" dungeons).  Maybe UD strat is harder but only because tricky pats and Baron is WAY harder than anything in scholo.  Big ups to raid geared rogue tanking, love running dungeons with unusual comps.  1000% agreed that "all orb res" is garbage, though Im mostly OK with first orb res since its a quick run.
---
And God help you as a horde if you do try and cap SHGY.  You will get screamed at for creating a turtle.  Never mind that the time I did it, Alliance had already capped SFGY.  I was called a traitor, an alliance double agent, and several rather profane epithets.  
---
Good times.
---
What 'useful' conversation is there to be had about a game that's been theorycrafted to hell and back?
---
Saw a comment last time where switching from gnomish to goblin engineering is somewhat different/less difficult. Does anyone have any insight on this?
---
Just do it while you watch TV. It's almost effortless, you just gotta be ready to hit vanish every now and then.
---
I doubt a shadow priest can do a run as efficiently and fast as my hunter. Feign death really makes things a lot easier. 
---
I know warlocks can kill the last boss, which is something I can't do. I only kill the satyr boss and bring the last boss into the imp phase. When the tunnel opens I merely feign death and pop an invis potion and then mine the tunnel. 
---
A run takes between 8 - 12 minutes which includes mining the tunnel.
---
12-7
---
Entrapment is really good in warsong as well. Rooting people who grabbed your flag helps a lot.
---
NA -&gt; http://discord.gg/avpremade
---
EU -&gt; tough luck, premade discord is invite only. Better have good connections or look for a server specific one.
---
I agree actually. I don't know the purpose of this sub.
---
First you toss the eskhanders in the toilet
---
Open chest, don't take out the blues, write in world chat "selling ring/staff/hammer for 25/50 gold", profit.
---
Or that time I was doing a Kara run and someone said in raid chat "let's just grab the loot off this next boss and then hearth".  Awkward for everyone involved, but they said "oops mt" so it was ok.
---
Dude is listing off specific changes to game mechanics?  The game is very playable, just maybe not when you pack hundreds if not thousands of people into a spot a zone because you want some buff that allows you to clear MC a bit faster?  This is borne out of the ultra competitive gaming culture that has fucked up many things about classic.  The same culture that brought us the min max av strategies of RUSH DREK.  I’m so sick of the constant bitching and moaning about how bad blizzard is evil and bad at everything.
---
Well the hard grinders in the alliance set the pace that you need to be competitive with instant queues.
---
Right, so shitposting and memes ahoy.
---
5 piece is for PvP w/ Hemo
---
We gave the claw to our tanks, as the prix sounded great on paper, but upon seeing our logs the uptime is kinda crappy. Check your uptime before putting so much weight on the proc.
---
The loot itself is like 15-25g + potions.
---
Consistently doing 5 runs per hour would be 12 minute runs. That is, 12 mins to kill the endboss and get back out/sell items to make space. At some point your inventory is full and you have to go to a mailbox. If you literally never die (and people do die, you can't always plan around Feign Death resists when running through trash).
---
I think realistically you can get to a safe ~90g/h if you do well. If you high roll and find Foror's or some other random epic, you can get higher.
---
Good for you? Not sure how your single experience compares to the old stats, hundreds of complaints on the forums back then, and discussion on outside sources like early elitist jerks site.
---
What, you´re telling me that the Leftovers post we had a week ago wasnt pointless.
---
People can roleplay that they will put up with this all they want but truth is that nobodys gonna stay there to just be shit on.
---
Here is how I see it. If you can farm it, why you are not farming it for money, it's easier to farm money the way you like it then buy item you need from ah.  Unless you can't farm money at all (some reasons), then you also can ask your friends to hand out some money for you to buy it (same idea, it's easier for them to farm their way). On the other hand, it's some kind of friends activity, if everyone in the group like it, then it's fine to farm together.
---
They also don't show the fact that a lot of those greens they are counting in the "x G per hr" will just sit on the AH and never sell.
---
You've swayed me, Dr. Butt Drugs.
---
&gt; We have considered doing DME runs once he levels his mining up enough for the rich thorium 
---
Do the jump runs.  Poison dispel makes the last boss super easy and the druid can deal with Imps so you don't have to clear any of the trash before hand.  Mining, herbing, Enchanting are all great for DME farm.   Dedicate the time to leveling that mining.  Don't dally.  Once you can mine the rich thorium the rest of the levels can be had in DME.
---
do ppl run UBRS as 10 or 5 nowadays? just hit 55 and excited to participate some bigger dungeon runs.
---
My guild back in retail days was literally the top of the server for the entirety of my time spent leading the LC. The difference is that there was never a question of "prioritizing dedicated and performing raiders", since everyone was dedicated, and everyone was high performing. If you weren't, we would replace you. There is no practical reason for prioritizing between a 9.9 and a 10 unless you just really love drama.
---
I would argue that you prioritizing between players is just an attempt to weed out the bad players because you lack the leadership to address those players in person.
---
On Herod? And counterpoint, I got ganked over and over in blasted lands last night by two alliance rogues. On Herod it's a lot more balanced and we're all ass holes. You're just buying into the victim complex reddit has, you've got it better than you think you do. There are other servers where it's a much much bigger problem and not nearly as fairly matched. There's always gonna be ass holes, at least your side has plenty of them too.
---
Yeah I was using it as my main tanking weapon. I know double axes is the optimal route. I just wasn’t sure if axe of the deep woods was a good enough dps leap before I get a deathbringer.
---
MSBT (the floating text addon) has floating text for this by default, unless you're looking for something more flashy.
---
What do you mean?
---
I've been here so many damn times for that star and the only time ive seen it dropped an enhance shammy ninja'd it for his "PVP elem" set..
---
Wow, that was great tip, thanks alot dude!
---
Mining is not a profitable profession. Mining is only useful for getting things your toon will need. Whether you want to save money on a Lionheart Helm or epic dungeon quest. Helps save you money leveling engineering. It is in no way a money maker and you should not expect it to be. It will routinely dissapoint you and  not make you any money. Herbalism/Alchemy is the most profitable combination if you are a casual player (less than 6 hrs a day)
---
Guy in my guild is named Bootybae.
---
When you say "there will be more locks brought to raid for aq and naxx" I disagree.
---
Unless your in a guild that pushes for perfect comps currently mages vastly outnumber warlocks and I doubt that will change going forward unless the majority of players reroll locks which, As you've pointed out yourself, some don't have the time to do that.
---
No one knows how the latter phases are going to go down but given how it looks now I don't think you're going to have an issue as a Warlock later on, I still think there will be a boatload more mages.
---
I guess I just can't get behind giving people a free pass to be dicks because they want to "max honour gains". And even then, my bigger issue is with the people who say that you know what you signed up for, etc etc. It wasn't like this in vanilla. It's calmed down a lot since BGs were released.
---
It was a phrase to compare the situations, not to be taken so literally like a couple of people have so far.
---
Ooh I totally forgot about the AV axe. That’s a great idea. Thanks
---
Mind if I ask why you're 3 manning dungeons? It's easy finding people to group with.
---
Man, even their backdoor is harder to get through.
---
The most wealthy players make their money from standing on a mailbox, if you know what I mean.
---
I get 4 taps all the time
---
This is good advice
---
We were thinking the same on MC, we have had onslaught girdle drop 6 weeks in a row running it Sunday night.
---
We've had 3 eyes of divinity drop. Each of those priests had a guild warrior go grind with them in ws. All 3 got eye of shadow in 2 hours or less
---
Bro, grind AV rep to Revered and use the AV Axe in your main hand. Flurry offhand.
---
Pray for a Deathbringer from Ony
---
It's not a rumor. It was planned as a playable race (such as demons, nagas and goblins) but they found out it took too much time to implement and it was scrapped. Which is why they have more anims than others. Nagas/Demons/Goblins were scrapped without having work done on them simply by the nature of the pre-evaluation (Nagas have no legs, goblins are too small, Demons were designed at first as shape-shifters).
---
I forget the source, but I'm 90% sure I read that in the WoW Diary.
---
I've always understood them to work the same in Bgs as they do in the world, but I may be wrong.
---
SL is pretty much dueling and 1v1 only, it doesn't have enough damage to contribute in group play. Conflag is the way to go if you want burst.
---
One of my favorite things about pservers was getting to play with some of the good EU players. I remember watching MN smush people on the regular, he was one of the R14s I remember from Nost.
---
That’s all fine, but when I start getting downvotes for “stealing” MC gear, then I got something to say about that.
---
Ah we don't have any issue with trash pulls.  But certainly if someone wandered into a destroyer you'd wipe.
---
I am exalted in AV, I did totally forget about the axe tho. Good point
---
From a mod standpoint. The amount of absolutely low effort trash memes that we have had to removed daily is astronomically high. 
---
From a user standpoint while some memes are good its tiring seeing the same dumb meme bled dry.
---
We usually do it sunday, however if it resets, say mobday, we'll do it during the week and then again sunday
---
Ok so you have to practice a bit before you nail the best xp &amp; gold/per hour farm in the game. Im failing to see the problem here
---
?
---
Exactly what I was thinking of. I draw pokemon a bit myself so I really dig this naturally.
---
Jump runs in DM E.
---
Herb &amp; Mining = $$$$
---
Warlock because of gameplay, destro (the reason i would roll it) vs sl (effective, but boring after tbc slsl years). 
---
Sucubus + fear 2 targets blown out ir silence/dispell fun. 
---
No Blink. 
---
TBC/Classic+? Always warlock, aliance to teigger those undeads dying :)
---
Ok but the post is about organized guilds getting their buff.  Not a random terrible pug.
---
Swift Brown Steed
---
Wow you're amazing
---
skype is better anyway, as long as your friends are already added...
---
Mulgore is by far my favorite starting zone. It's the most gorgeous zone in the game and seeing Thunder Bluff in the background is so cool.
---
Tirisfal makes it into a surprise second place, I didn't realize how cool it was until Classic. Never leveled an undead before that. Quests were neat and the zone does a great job with atmosphere. 
---
Elwynn comes third for me even though I almost exclusively played human characters in Vanilla/TBC. It's still a great zone and is pretty iconic.
---
The remaining zones are a toss-up for me honestly. I don't think any are bad, they just don't stand out like these three do.
---
Yeah and that's exactly what's wrong with Blizzard and why paying customers are complaining. I'm paying for Classic, what do I care about other obligations the corporation has? Literally not my problem. And yet, Blizzard makes it mine
---
Because the center field is slightly off center??
---
I went 138 hits with 0 arcane crystals. Another day I got 3 in 29 hits. It happens.
---
You have yet to find a guide somewhere explaining the mats and the variety of things you can do in AV (and the effect that it will have). 
---
I’ve noticed that I get all kinds of mats from HKs and I know that storm crystals go to that NPC way in the back to eventually summon Treesus. Not too sure where the other mats go and what they do.
---
What does capping a mine do? 
---
How do you cap a tower and what does it do?
---
What the hell happens to the map and NPCs when you do stuff with mines, towers, and material turn-ins??
---
I do understand the long term ramifications of this. If paid transfers are allowed, It allows people to escape these stuck / dead / crazy imbalanced server.
---
I play on Alliance on a 30/70 server. It is TERRIBLE in the world, let me tell you. I'm a pretty hardcore pvper, so I'm staying. But if enough people transfer off, I will too because I don't want to play the game if the realm I'm on is a 20/80, or 10/90. At least I have the option now.
---
Yea yea I get your argument is that now that there is paid transfers, it will persuade the people that want to leave, to leave, and cool I get that. But not everyone wants to leave these situations. Playing on the crazy high dominated server isn't fun for most, Horde nor Alliance.
---
So i have to wait until the addons are fixed? I mean, when i read the correct, it works like this since vanilla - and still it's not correct calculated in those addons.
---
I am not sure how it works but lets say you are right.   
---
i will still not participate and just focus on my warrior and let everyone else create larger brackets while I go to the top quicker :)
---
Then, any wow player is nolifer from the point of view of random boomer who has no clue about video games in general.
---
Well tbh I’d rather get in and out in 10’min games for AV rep and play WSG/AB for fun, but I don’t care about the honor competition.
---
No. It was not a part of vanilla. Paid transfers were a part of vanilla so that’s why it’s there. It won’t happen at all.
---
You must be stuck with the know-nothing virgins, while I got all the pro chads.
---
(I puked in my mouth a little saying that... brb taking shower and brushing teeth)
---
Never ever ever.
---
Tanking Druid as well here. Or at least I was before our raid group got flooded with warriors that wanted to tank.
---
What I did for gold was a couple things.
---
1) Farming herbs/consume items for MC. Elemental Fires, Small Flame Sacs, Dreamfoil, Mountain Silversage, Icecap, Plaguebloom all go for good prices on the AH (depending on your server of course).
---
2) Farming dungeons. Usually every server is always hurting for tanks, so it can be lucrative to message a group looking for a tank and saying "I'll run it for all the green drops that people dont need" or "I'll do it for the first righteous orb", etc.
---
3) Farming dungeons solo. There are many different dungeons that can be lucrative. My favourite one to do was SM GY because there is so much grave moss there. On my server a stack of grave moss goes for 18g. You can clear 5 runs of SM GY in like... 30 mins and get a full, or at least close to full, stack of grave moss. That plus all the other drops you vendor from there, you can make a nice amount of money pretty quickly, and best thing is that it's safe.
---
Maraudon is probably a better farm spot, but honestly, I never really got into the whole waste 20 minutes running around in circles trying to kill princess. Was never too fun for me. I'd rather go into a dungeon, gather up a crap ton of mobs in bear form, pop barkskin + hurricane and just watch them all melt.
---
But I can't tell you how much money alch/herb can bring in. Especially now that you can make FAPs, Swiftness potions, and all the other great PvP potions that everyone wants at least a stack of always.
---
It’s even better when you can pay for the sub with gold. I haven’t paid for a hobby since WOD.
---
What about 16/31/4 ?
---
So literally no reason to pvp at all in AV than outside what is required to hold an objective. Gotcha.
---
I feel like the loss from opportunity isn't worth it.  My 2 cents.
---
That's fine and all when dealing with gear. The prices are variable.
---
Dealing with materials especially in bulk is a different story. If you're selling arcanite for 35g buyout with a 20g bid you'll lose out big time if they buy it for the bid price because the materials cost you 30g to make it.
---
People use add-ons to make things easier and it's much easier to set one criteria for everything that to set up each individual item or group of items. (That's not to say people don't do it).
---
Take my upvote.
---
It took me a LONG time to figure out how to do it, and I still mess up from time to time. It's still worth it to spend the time learning. The XP/hr is really unmatched. And you make good money, while leveling. I'm funding my 60 warrior's consumables by leveling my mage in ZF and having a blast.
---
With 30 spell power its decent for druids.  Has 250 health and a bunch of mana.
---
Staff of Dominance is better though.  The only reason Finkle's is more common is usually druids are at the back of the line for Dominance.
---
I'm using Amberseal Keeper and for pvp I still think it's better.  Losing 250hp is rough but spell power is just too important.
---
Farmlog
---
Still popping up way faster than you can exist town? With 17 minute AV q’s I’m doubting it :)
---
I was playing all day yesterday, came across a priest. Potted to UC explained how to play it to him since he didn’t know how to play. He rolled a 1, said that isn’t how you play, left group and didn’t give me my 20g. QQLULSNERD
---
Not going to happen, far too difficult to do in classic, several faction specific armor pieces/weapons, with no equivalent for the other faction. Plus shamans and pallies wouldent work.
---
It's there because it's easy money because of how screwed faction balance is on some realms.
---
i'm a lock really good friend with a mage. I've watched him stream the brd/zf farm. It's as easy as mara, BRD took some extra time to learn but idk about the complaints.
---
DMEast needs my full focus (last boss atleast).
---
You can personally ban it. Report OP for spam and select the option to block the user.
---
That's way too peaceful. Only way this would be possible on my realm would be if the Orc was a bot. 😅
---
can testify as an original dreadmist player, and having 60's on other realms. it's probably the most well-rounded server in EU.
---
more energy means more backstabs... i disagree
---
The most fun choice is whichever one you stick with. The real fun is the pride you find in the class *you* choose. Not all classes are balanced, but they're all the best at *something*. It's up to you to appreciate your own choice.
---
I'm not saying the gold lost per roll is significant I'm saying it isn't a true 50/50.  Also like I said the lower # the roll is starting the greater the variance, so yes it absolutely matters what the starting roll is in real world application because you will never get to infinite number of rolls (or even a significant number) you can never get close to 50/50 in a real world application with a starting roll of 4 however the more rolls you do the closer you will get to it.  
---
Anyway if you ever gamble for profit literally any % chance no matter how small is an edge and you should use it
---
While doing my mage quest to get the staff, I had to fight endless mobs until you kill 15 iirc. Before I had started my quest I cheered on a horde mage and helped him kill the elite for his wand quest. He was a much lower level mage trying to help me with extra novas, etc. We both died, but the mobs kept spawning and the timer ticking. After the rez walk back as I was rebuffing and drinking, one of his ?? Guildies showed up, waved at me, let me begin a flamrstrike/blizzard, then ran in and tanked it all for me. I finished the quest, emoted a bunch of thank you 's and rode off into the swamps. It was a nice exchange and I was happy. 
---
Not everyone is a dick.
---
Sure this is what I plan on. I am saying for my gear at the moment other than the NS helm/ legs I have 3 other NS items.
---
Bloodthirst depends on attack power and not weapon speed, why dismiss Esk claw without further analysis of flurry and claw procs, rage dump and other factors?
---
per run is ~11g with mining
---
35g/hr if you do it the normal way
---
there are some ways to pull multiple bosses at once that you can do to get 50g+hr but it takes more time to learn and probably some better gear
---
i just recommend dmeast. Takes longer to learn but its way more gphr.
---
Is there no way you can get your guild to help?  Everytime a new priest gets a eye of divinity we all just head over to winter spring after the raid. I've helped 5 or 6 now. Longest one was mine lmao but there was only 4 of us and it took about 90 minutes. Last Friday 5 of us helped a priest and it dropped off 3rd demon so it took like maybe 2 minutes? Lol. Average is 20min to half hour if you got a group of 5 I'd say. 
---
 Eye of shadow is 350g on my server and yeah most definitely just 'grins' if it can even be considered that.
---
That's true for 1v1 dueling pvp or premade flag running, which for most people is completely irrelevant.
---
Because I would expect at least one honorable 1v1 world encounter in either phase 1 or 2? Does that really seem that wild to you?
---
Especially in phase 1 I would expect people to respect the 1v1 moreso as there is no honor reward, but nope. Always ends up a lop sided zerg from the losing teams cronies.
---
I'm not whinging - check my comment history if you think thats the case. I levelled two toons to 60, second during P2. I know exactly (almost) what I signed up for.
---
Your comment highlights my exact point though - the player is the problem. Players can't even IMAGINE a 1v1 world encounter. Wild.
---
Dunno why you are downvoted. You are obviously right. Otherwise Blizzard would have dealt with faction imbalance differently. Of course they will gladly take the money for a problem, they did not want to solve in the first place. Faction Queues, 1 faction transfer and so on, could have been easily implemented and don't blame #nochanges, since the high server cap is the very reason imbalance was much more severe.
---
It's really easy to stop. Even a couple defenders will suffice. However, alliance sometimes screams incessently at everyone to go south, letting stealthers pick off towers, and insisting that towers don't matter. Those games generally go poorly.
---
Yeah my lock is only 16 but it has been straight mindless which is actually kind of nice. I typically hate casters but the dot and wand thing is kind of interesting to me.
---
No shit. They didn’t add server transfers for role playing. Of course it was for server balance
---
Alliance scum. What a shame. Your UI looks like shit btw
---
Once you’re done with the rep grind the BG actually gets 2-3x more fun to just play normally. You don’t feel obligated to do dumb rep stuff at all and can just focus on killing, defending, helping call our enemy movement etc. Really enjoying av more now which I thought I’d hate after so many soulless rep grind games
---
took me 29 deaths before i got dmeast on farm. Now it's 100gphr easy if i respec, little less if i stay my raid spec bc i need to take my time and use more consumables. Worth it.
---
Because everything is overinflated the day it becomes available. Then the market normalizes.
---
You message a week later and pretend this message is still relevant? That's cute
---
Hippocampus
---
You know you can do this without paying 15$ a month right? You can just flip a coin and not do this on your computer.
---
Everyone else I know doesn't have their classic client do this
---
Raid population doesn’t really reflect server population. 
---
The only thing ironforge.pro will help you with if you’re looking to raid and you want to know which faction has more raiding guilds/a more active pug scene.
---
Ask yourself this question:
---
Is it faster to farm the item or farm the gold?  If it is faster to farm the gold, purchase the item; if not, farm the item.
---
Nah no auto correct I'm looking for a horse server
---
1 point in relentless strikes gives more dps than 1 point in lethality. Check classic rogue dps spreadsheet for example.
---
Losing the entire BG is not the same thing as specific points being Horde or Alliance favoured.
---
xn streamed him doing it naked and pulling both hydra/satyr together and didnt die
---
but then again it's xn...
---
Your posts are wrong anyway. You stopping posting is preventing misinformation - which is a good thing.
---
What a grind. Guilds man it's such an easy farm we always do it right after the raid as it takes about 20 minutes for one to drop.
---
I would say it’s relevant! Just coming back to say I told you so :)
---
I find myself snacking less, but also skipping the gym more often, so I'll just call it a wash.
---
Also means that if you want to do a quick bg because its fun and simply dont have time to wait 13-20 min queue, you wont be able to do it...
---
I’m agree you did, I read it in something like that as well. I don’t know the source either, so went with rumored lol. But yes, like you said, just too much work like the other races, which is a real shame.
---
Hey, 97+ parsing Dagger Spec rogue here.
---
You want 4/5 and 1/1.
---
Have energy be returned can make the difference in whether or not you get an extra backstab or two fepending on the length of fights.
---
I can verify...ok where the fuck is rich thorium vein???? O cool.....this one too, no arcane crystal.... O nice!
---
1 point in relentless strikes gives more dps than 1 point in lethality. Check classic rogue dps spreadsheet for example.  
---
Also according to the same spreadsheet double crusader is 0.2% dps increase and provides some healing as a bonus.
---
If someone is calling their father that then they are not involved in their lives. Either deceased or non supportive.
---
Strange, I don't have a lot of QoL addons. Maybe Leatrix does it?
---
Um, what about this thing called having fun? Haha. Not everything in this game needs to be min maxed and battlegrounds can be a nice break from monotonous leveling.
---
Is a rogue in stealth harder to see than a druid in stealth? How does NE racial stealth compare to class skill stealth? Are there other considerations for picking a class to sneak around and herb in hostile territory than those?
---
That's lowkey nothing.  On herod I've seen the head CD become available for 20mins before the NPC started his RP, and it took another 40 minutes before the buff finally went out.
---
It's a big issue, but yeah 10 minutes is nothing.
---
You want Head, Bracers + Gloves or Belt. To maintain T2 3pc
---
It would’ve been there regardless but it was prob expedited due to unbalanced servers. Seeing how faction transfers were two expansions away, they won’t add that in. Imagine adding something from wrath of the lich king into “classic wow”.
---
you sure? the set up  might be long but after the initial 20 hours or so to power level your 9 alts to lv 10 its not so bad.
---
getting 15HK is what half a wsg? getting 15hkx9 is prob 2 hours a week possibly less. then you do a casual 20 hours a week and u get standing 1 easy
---
Takes an hour on my server.
---
Twinking
---
Had the opposite experience the other day (Horde) ... Waited in a 15 minute queue then entered the instance,  upon which I was almost immediately presented with a "Alliance Wins" screen. Then hopped back into a 15 minute queue. Feelsbadman
---
When a single game can range from 8 minutes to 60 minutes, I don't think waiting 15 minutes is really a deal breaker.
---
I'm basically just a warm body to fill up 40 slots to my guild and don't have irl friends on my server. I solo grind out a lot of stuff you'd typically get a guildie to help with. I don't mind it though - put on a movie and zone out and don't even really realize I'm playing the game.
---
I didn't realize how good the UD reaction animation was for getting punched in the face.
---
If you're that upset about a game, maybe it's time to go outside.
---
It depends on the focus of your guild I guess. The goal of some guilds is purely to down bosses in raids as quickly and effectively as possible so of course you're not "stealing" gear there. However, some guilds use raiding as a means to an end to get PvP gear. In that case, a priest that's doing just as much work as you in raids but will also use the gear when he plays 6 hours of PvP a week might be a little salty when you get gear and use it 1/10th as much as he would.

Which classes have transmutes?

Alchemy for arcanite bars/essences
---
Tailoring for felcloth -&gt;mooncloth
---
is that it?

Implants don't sag.

there is an AV 1h mace too

What if you have fun grinding out BiS ?

There is a splash sound when a fish gets hooked, you have so many seconds to click on the bobber. If you have auto loot enabled and fish on an action bar it's really easy to afk fish.
---
18500/21000... still doin av

In theory, it would work. In practice, there is a prisoner's dilemma problem. Everyone is incentivized to cheat, and benefit from everyone else's work without putting in any themselves.

And the nolifers will definitely cheat.

People talk a lot of shit about the Earthshaker but its a damn good pvp weapon. It procs A LOT and when it does its invaluable there are certain classes that I normally have 0 chance of winning against such as a frost mage that with an earthshaker proc suddenly I can get lucky and actually win. For the BG setting its even better maybe someone could make an argument for other weapons such as unstoppable force in 1v1 scenarios or duels. But if in BGs Shaker w/ mace spec is hands down better imo

'ill roll you 10'

Absolute heathen

Look I get where you coming from. But what can you achieve? If you or I don't "give a free pass" then what? We have absolutely NO say in this matter. They did what they did because they thought this gives them the best chance at fat epics.

But yeah the "you know what you've signed up for" idiots are talking out of their ass.

No, he was joking!

Nice one. It's amusing that you thought that was a good response. You're so pretentious, good god. Google 'what is a high horse' and work yourself forward.

Where’s the vitriolic hate screeches in this comment thread? Even if you can point to a handful of people on the entire post at large that express their opinion toxically, that doesn’t make everyone critical of Blizzard vitriolic. See this comment thread for example...
---
So is anyone interested in starting an alliance toon on this server to sort of resuscitate it? If we get enough people to commit, I'm sure we can bring it back?
---
There's a guild on our server that's hosts Mc every weekend Friday - Sunday. They spend about 3-5 hours a night. They HAVE not killed rag yet lmao. 
---
 Just becuase your sweaty gamer doesn't mean everyone else is you dirty rogue.
---
Feels like a bit of a stretch to bring PvP into this. I should expect some down votes because my guild might be PvP focussed?
---
Ok whatever, thanks for your perspective.
---
:(
---
Someone do the Buster Scruggs "first time?" meme.
---
This happened to our guild on Thalnos but our post got insta deleted when we posted it here ☹️
---
my guild isn't even hardcore =/
---
Meanwhile on pagle horde has yet to get a world boss kill, and alliance other than one guild hardly gets any kill due to them constantly camping them
---
Use BF Hood and Pants
---
5pc doesnt matter for PvE
---
mages are still stronger in aq/naxx so good guilds will bring 2-4 warlocks per raid. warlocks are really easy to gear up though and in a good guild ull have prio on hit gear over mages. also warlock is only a one button spam class on tank and spank bosses like geddon. there is a lot u can do to improve ur dps on multi-target fights like majordomo. same goes for most trash encounters.
---
Damn thats a good idea.
---
Weakauras can be configured to give you sound and visual
---
Does the 19 think bracket even matter? Like at all?

Majority of games are twinks. But alot of time there's 1-4 lowbies who get trashed talked by our own team the whole time lol
---
Dang, yo.
---
getting darkest dungeon vibes rn
---
My guild pulled me into a raid before I was 60 and I won the roll for mageblade. Couldn't even wear it for another couple levels
---
Well slow weapons benefit more from special attacks proccing wf, hoj, and flurry axe, and whirlwind hits harder with slower weapons
---
Fortunately, my main is not the one with mining, its my alt rouge I also use to solo smelt dark iron bars in BRD.
---
I just swap characters in DM:E to farm the actual nodes.
---
Quality content. Incoming some brainy discussion.
---
Nah it's just supposed to be fun but every game people bitch and then throw the game
---
I always imagine them being like a high council in every movie ever. Sitting on huge high chairs with their infinite wisdom.
---
Warlocks are in reality the squishiest easiest target in pvp after priests, so rolling lock to not get focused would be ahuge mistake.
---
Are you freaking SERIOUS?
---
Are paladins more efficient at dungeon leveling on alliance, than mages?
---
I play primarily horde so I'd be interested to know if it is more efficient with a paladin.
---
Holy would be a better choice.
---
Most of the value of Shadow is concentrated near the top of the tree. So being a Shadow Priest right now doesn't have a lot of payoff. On the other hand, the low end of Holy dramatically improves your ability to heal.
---
It also gets you Holy Nova, which is the only AE ability Priests receive. While it sucks compared to 'actual' AE, it's still often enough to make the difference between the Mage heavily injuring but not killing a spawn vs. the entire spawn being dead.
---
You'll also need someone to heal in many fights, so you might as well be good at it.
---
and this is how you end up at the current retail version. A minor concession here, a minor concession there... and wammo. I'm happy the buffs require coordination and can be a PITA sometimes - makes it all that much more enjoyable and rewarding when things work out
---
100% Druid especially for pvp cause you’ll wind up using so many aspects of the class in pvp. Pve like raids you’ll be more focused on one spec.
---
Well you dont have to wait, you can just roll with it so long as you mean to hold aggro. But yeah the module that the threat meter addons all reference is LibThreatClassic &amp; it needs to be updated.
---
That’s awesome, always for people quiting smoking. Wish you the best
---
what exactly is rend? i checked through the boss and no one is named rend. lol
---
Employed casual player here who doesn't have the time to level professions or any other characters to farm gold on.. 
---
This is still the easiest method to farm gold out of ANY class. You could inefficiently pickpocket BRD for 2hrs if you're really bad/slow and still net about 40-50g in that time frame. Do that for a week straight and you'll have anywhere between 300-400g in your bags which is more than enough to really fund anything in this game (respec costs, consumables for raid/pvp, gear for alts)
---
Any other excuse you give is just laziness. Farming gold isn't something that's supposed to be easy anyway, otherwise everyone would be walking around with a few thousand gold in their bags at all times.
---
Snitches get stitches but cheaters are bleeders.
---
Im playing a warrior honey, there never was much loot to get in MC anyways.
---
So I just did this exact thing and what I’ve been doing to minimize exp gained in instances is just park my twink at the very beginning of the instance and log him off until I get to the boss that’s needed, then bring my main back to the beginning and escort him to the boss (usually a few pats along the way). So far I have all of my dungeon drops at level 13, and now I just need to wait til lvl 18 to do 2 more dungeon quests.  It takes a little longer, but patience is key in making a successful twink.  Also I found the best resources is the xpoff classic, and also comparing that with other classic twink guides.
---
Still not sure what point you are trying to make anymore.
---
LFG chat is on my ignore list.
---
Idk sorry, i have little to no experience with warlocks, give it a try! If it takes more than 12 min per run it might not be efficent, but if you bring a friend/alt along for the xp it could still be worth it.
---
I would guess that even if you can do it somewhat efficently, doing your DM farms would probably get you the twink items you want faster just from buying them with the gold you'd make, but i understand that farming the same spot for too long can be really boring.
---
Treant's Bane could get you close to an Epic mount I bet =p
---
its a joke bud
---
Thank you! :)
---
I specifically got into Classic so I would stay inside all fall/winter/spring instead of going out and spending money (I usually go to live shows, concerts, parties,etc.) and have saved a great deal for my upcoming South America backpack trip this time next year.
---
NSFW because? Click bait?
---
Cause bosses always drop droid gear for the one droid in the raid
---
You have a never-ending supply of new players, so its a good idea to slaughter as much as you can. Like 1/3 of my honor is from killing people.
---
486 dx20 with a sound blaster
---
Budget? Peripherals?
---
They haven't said what their plans post-Naxx are, though a developer said that it would be a lot easier to do the expansions since Classic laid a lot of the groundwork already. Personally I do hope they come out with TBC and eventually Wrath Classic
---
Did the grind for an eye about 2 weeks ago. Honestly, it was way easier than I thought it would be. I spent about an hour and a half farming with a mage guildie, and then once a rogue joined up, got the drop a few pulls later. Maybe just shy of 2 hours? It's pretty luck dependent, but honestly it wasn't that bad.  
---
For gold farming, I've seen some videos of holy priests doing princess runs. Looks pretty doable although a bit boring. I'd check youtube for some video guides!
---
Always a fun time when that works! Just takes a while
---
Wow you are lucky, i have ground in DM E for over 1000g (no herbs) because it is so easy and I can do some work in between and I have never seen it.  I guess I am due (I have 300 herbs now)
---
I've made two separate macros, one for mounting and equipping Carrot on a Stick as well as my Mithril Spur boots, and one for dismounting and equipping HoJ and regular boots. I'm not sure that it's possible to do it in one macro but I might be wrong tbh.
---
As a member of a guild who's taken down over half the world boss spawns since they came out... don't ever post when or who you killed, nor the loot. We have multiple alt scouts on post at all times and record the kill times so we know when to approximately start searching again
---

---
Most people use an add-on that automatically does it.  But also, economically speaking, it's far better to undercut by 1c so you don't tank process on high turnover items...  Like when low value materials end up in the ah for less than vendor price because people undercut by 20%
---
You can play this game on a potato

Frostbite axe from AV, claw to the vendor. Next
---
This, would love the raids they were going to continue pre-tbc
---
Ok earl
---
They are just RL gold farming lol
---
Are you new to the game? This is nothing new. Just because people complain on reddit doesn’t mean blizzard is going to act any faster. 
---
They wait so they can cast their net as large as possible.
---
&gt;I know we all thought they'd never open up paid realm transfers.
---
No one who kept informed thought that.
---
All what work? Standing in org  then hearthing to kargath?
---
Also it shaves way more than 10 minutes.
---
Frostbite from AV (revered) is superior to Axe of the Deep Woods. Just get that. It's the third-best MH axe in the game, after R14 axe and Deathbringer from Ony.
---
Any good addons that can help me view AH prices over time for individual items? Graphs, charts, etc?
---
Second this. Frostbite is the third-best axe in the game right now for MH, following the R14 axe and Deathbringer from Ony.
---
Dumb question:
---
I'm a 60 warrior that does some dungeons as a tank or dps (i'm 0/31/20). I have OK gear. 5/8 Valor, and some other decent stuff. AV weapons. I PVP a decent amount. I'm still using Big Bad Pauldrons (yeah the ones from ZF). 
---
I don't raid. Since I'll probably never get into UBRS to get Valor shoulders, what should I aim for? I don't really care how good the shoulders are, I just feel silly wearing these old ones. 
---
Looking on wowhead I don't see much out there... I'm 280 blacksmith if that helps. I can lvl it to 300 if there's something worth crafting.
---
So u raid the night before a reset and after a reset so ppl get 12 days on non-raid specs? 
---
Thats a pretty cool idea.
---
Make sure it turns on. It can? Then it can run classic.
---
I'm not saying whay - but wow classic also helped me to significantly spend/waste less money. 
---
Cheers to that :)
---
For the horse!
---
No, you cannot.
---
Your guy just iced me trying to kill rock elementals in badlands lol.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/DG9zOZr
---
Yes kinda. Hks will help but they wont compare, ever, to a fast AV. So if you want to maximize your hph, gotta do objectives. I mean wsg is the same way really, since honor gets split and you hit dr's super quick. You want the game to be over like.. within 5-10 mins, after that you might as well do AV. Especially now since wsg queues are on par with AV since Horde dont want to do nothing but bg against alliance premades.
---
If your server is lagging don't jump thru the MC window. Just jump carefully onto it's ledge. You won't go thru the window but you will trigger the MC zone in.
---
I hope they go level soon, more to the game than to just be told to git gud
---
10 people farming can earn enough to buy it In 30-60 minutes. It's not worth farming if the price is below 400g, and you can often get it below ah prices if you whisper the people that have it listed.
---
TSM
---
Whether you need 3 pieces from MC or 15, it doesn’t change the points I made that you are a selfish and self-centered player.
---
No consequences obviously, just expressing an opinion. I can't reconcile what happened on Flamelash here and having people say "It's not our fault it's Blizzard's!" It's at least partly your fault.
---
Ive also noticed that that server is close to drained. Extremely overpopulated on 1 side isnt fun either way=/
---
Everyone in this thread is missing the most important information though. That thing looks sick as hell! If my scrawny little priest could equip it I'd 100% drop dkp on it to whack some gnomes in the face with some big ass gears. Sometimes style is better than optimal.
---
mana is pretty key
---
id personally go something down half disc for mana regen/inner focus etc and then work on holy
---
i healed with a disc spec until 40 then went shadow for shadowform, but i could still heal as full shadow spec, just not as well
---
here is my build i used until 39

---
relying on mostly shield + renew heals, and the % off insta cast is clutch with holy nova too, and inner focus is great too
---
and if you want to damage stuff, wand spec does alot of damage granted if you had a good wand + smite spam, you can also put points into the holy crit talent in the first row of holy if you want
---
from here you can keep going disc or go down holy
---
eventually your end game build will be something like 21/30/0

---
in general i prefer inspiration over imp renew really, once you get enough + heal , inspiration is better overall, for low level though its nice being able to shield and renew and smite and wand to help dps if you want.
---
or i like going 32/19/0, which is what i usually go for better mana + power infusion
---

but im mainly a spriest, got full t1 and t2 and benediction when i need to respec to heal though haha
---
hope that gives you some info on how to go foward
---
Just as sad for a holy paladin, I need goons to kill anything.
---
Get a toon with alchemy and that goes up to 5g each! ;)
---
It's like this every Tuesday on Herod. Don't even log my main for the buff until well after the head is dropped. I suggest acquiring buffs the night before and just logging an alt until raid time. It sucks but what can you do. Alternatively the weekly reset also resets the cd on the head buff so a large crowd usually gathers right when the servers come online. Sucks for people who have to work tho.
---
Trying to keep it as objective as possible, the demographic of classic wow tends to be right leaning, and they had a doozy of a day.
---
Thanks for the reply, sounds like I should pick up herb. I'm going to keep skinning until I can get the Einhorn quest off the beast because from experience so far no groups I've been in have been able to skin him, but after that I'll take your advice.
---
Extremely high server pop with a ton of farmers should result in extra supply on AH and thus lower prices.
---
lmao
---
Now if I could just figure out how to unsub from r/NintendoSwitchDeals my retirement plan would be complete.
---
Play OSRS
---
I woulf never take mageblade over fang... then again I'm a shaman so I cant use mageblade.
---
I'm so glad this didn't exist in vanilla or I'd have been poor. I'm classic it's what we all do during raids and it's amazing. Tuesday night it was a 300g roll and both people roled a 2 eight times. It was very entertaining
---
If you think getting stomped by twinks is fun then go ahead, lol.
---
I twinned 39 all through vanilla and tbc.  Mages are viable carriers as well.  We had dedicated druid carriers in our guild but me and the other mage could reliable bring them back fibbing people along the way.
---
The comment I replied to.
---
It's like a 10-15% dps loss on the dps war spreadsheet.
---
Anyone have a creative mnemonic device for remembering which classes can dispel what?
---
UBRS isn't what I'd call 'Raiding'. Sure you are technically in a 'Raid', but it's better to think of it as a 10 man dungeon.
---
'Raiding' for me is MC/Ony. Everything else is just 'dungeons'.
---
There's usually 1/2 UBRS groups forming on a given night. Though is dependant on how busy your server is I guess. 
---
The Spaulders of Valour also drop from Rend. You can usually find groups who are running UBRS just to kill Jed/Rend as well. Those groups are the best way to get the shoulders.
---
If you want an alternative, these aren't bad and shouldn't be too hard to pick up: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13405/wailing-nightbane-pauldrons
---
I like to place bids consistently throughout the week on a variety of items from almost every category. If the bid falls below its normal buyout price i go ahead and buy it. At first, i did this with almost everything but now only really with items i will use. i 100% agree buying items through bids way in advance of when you need them is the play.  
---
The reason you see bids so close to buyout price is probably due to people who are just afraid to lose a lot from not having many bidders. Or they simply don't want to accept anything less than their listed buyout price. **Another thing is that the buyout price might be just higher than the vendor price, and listing a bid any lower would bring the item below the vendor price and make it not worth it.** I think the majority of people who use the AH don't use bids at all.  
---
The way you do it is how i would do it :) except i wouldn't advise buying armor/weapons from the AH while leveling.
---
Oh, it's not that bad at all. 
---
But it relies on cooperation. Screwing others over to gain advantage is largely what the R14s do. Win trading and account sharing are pretty much standard.
---
Maybe it’s different for horde but for alliance when you get the dbm notification its too late. You have 10s to get to sw.
---
Told in every single thread every single day... bud...
---
I’m amazed that anyone joins a run with such ridiculous terms, no offense
---
You deathroll 10 times the gold.
---
So the server is dead because sometimes it takes time to find a tank? This happens on all servers.
---
You just described what sounds like a good time. Then
---
&gt; I'm not exalted, so I may not experience any of these wonderful tactics again for quite some time
---
Why even play a game, especially one you seem to enjoy playing, literally only for the numbers? Just because you don't need rep from AV you could still enjoy playing it. 
---
Just because you don't need honor because you value your life and don't plan to play for 8-10+ hours every single day to rank high you can still PvP a bit for fun.
---
Definitely over 50% but not that much for me.  I play during the later evenings EST, like 9pm-12am.  Games are relatively close but sometimes Ally are inept and sometimes they flatten everything in their path.
---
&gt;who should have predicted the way it will play out
---
They did. And that one guy told us. And then we tore him to fucking shreds. And then they did it anyway because it meant a large spike in subscriptions/revenue.
---
If you weren’t the raid leader, and most likely an officer for your guild I wouldn’t give you such a hard time on this. But your behavior becomes the behavior of others in the guild. I’m not sure what type of guild you have, but I’m pretty sure you don’t recruit only new raiders who are completely decked out in all their pre-raid bis. Sometimes these people need to run dungeons. Am I asking you to use all your spare time to run others through dungeons? No of course not, you should play the game and enjoy it how you see fit. But at the same time you need to be an example to everyone in the guild that while not everyday, you try to help your guildies progress outside of raid so they are better when you are in raid. Thank god you are not my raid leader
---
Fyi, nothing in wow is that difficult to accomplish with a proper group.
---
If you do Goblin + Princess + Rotgrip and you have mining and herbalism i believe you get around 50g/hr.
---
I just made this up but (de)curse you mages
---
lmao what the heck do you talk like this to me, i’m not a PvE pleb and took every fight even in P1, it’s just that nobody around me would bother to PvP during P1, nothing else man.
---
Tips is the biggest loser lol
---
Shit person, shit GM, shit tourny
---
How many mounts do you have?  
---
 Make a macro to roll a random number = number of mounts 
---
Then set a /mount based on the number you rolled.
---
It is repeatable, do your strategy is unnecessary although clever
---
I've found 55 EoS solo now, also found a few with a guildy or two helping them.
---
&gt;Polymorph-&gt;amazing and good. Probably a big reason why mages are so hecking common.
---
Water Vending Machines
---
Mages - Curse
---
Priest and Pally - Magic
---
Rest - Don't Matter.
---
Looks surprisingly similar to a strat live run I did the other day, although my guild isn't hated on our server lol
---
This is why i prefer loot council to dkp.
---
All these pics of Santa alone are kind of creepy.
---
What's the better thing to do, level up in late game dungeons to get to 60, or grind/quest to 60 and then run stuff
---
500g on Skeram
---
Well yea, and it’s not unique to blizzard.  This is what happens when companies are beholden to shareholders who expect them to squeeze every penny out of operations.  It doesn’t make Blizzard evil, it makes them just like most multi billion dollar corporations.  
---
It is definitely a vocal minority, lag during ony buff is a niche issue, and the game is certainly *not* unplayable.
---
A lot of people will hit exalted fast and dungeon groups might pick back up.
---
Do both! Grind and quest when you can’t find a good group.
---
If you want to take the game seriously I think this is pretty far from the most immoral thing we do.
---
in case you're serious - there's a cooldown, and horde can get back in MUCH faster
---
Honestly the difference will be tiny, and will vary fight to fight. Also, it depends on if you are Alliance or Horde. BF is better for Alliance as it has more stats which benefit from BoK. Use 5 piece for Rag, and BF pieces for the rest is probably the way to go, but if you are Alliance just wearing BF might be slightly better for everything.
---
I’m most happy you learned to take a proper non-phone camera screenshot in the last 3 months.
---
Oh and yeah, grats on Hand of Rag  ;p
---
what monitor did you get? it could be the pixel response time is high

You dont have to reply or keep up with the notifications but if you keep replying, expect people to comment.

XP is easy to manage. Level to 10 so you can level your professions (engineering/first aid). The main quest line you'll need to do is the seal of Wrynn one that starts from a quest item drop off VanCleef. Cant do it until 16. You also need to do the defies messenger quest to do the quest to get VanCleef's head for the Tunic of Westfall. You actually do not need a single BoP drop from deadmines if you  are alliance. If you are horde, you'll need Blackened defies armor off VanCleef.
---
Wailing caverns you just need leggings of the fang, and Venomstrike bow if you go hunter. Everything else is BoE and can be bought off the AH. If you plan to go for Arena Grand Master trinket and fishing boots/hat, make sure you discover STV areas to avoid that xp.
---
&gt; works sometimes and doesn’t others. Completely unreliable in high pressure situations.
---
Tolerable.

Is their an add on that can tell me how much hit I have, Crit, etc?
---
&gt;They can join the same discord to run in the same premades.
---
&gt; To get into this discord, you have to be in a big and popular guild, like Apes or Progress, or you have to know a guy with admin priviligas that can vouch for you.
---
Can they though?
---
&gt; This account has been suspended
---
Sure its possible since its sorta exploiting a pathing bug and juggling which you could do almost indefinitely with just siphon life/tap, but few of the "guides" on youtube and such are making good on their own claims.
---
Maybe we have different definitions of the word niche. An effective 10-30 minute downtime, weekly, during prime hours, affecting a large amount of users...
---
The stun resist is a way bigger problem than will, so rogue might be out if it bothers you that one third of the horde has a passive 30% stun resist. Warlock, even against will, is fine on alliance. You will have to a human or gnome though...
---
I'm looking for some Elemental invasion spawn clarification because I've had no luck finding windybois in Silithus.
---
Can multiple be up at a time or do they rotate (AKA fireboi dies, windboi timer starts, windboi dies, earthboi timer starts)
---
How long are their spawn timers?
---
Do they have different lengths?
---
Boo this man!
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
Our designated Enh. Shaman who was designated to get the first Eye missed his first raid yesterday. The eye dropped.
---
It was destroyed by honor. P1 pvp was awesome
---
I think it depends on what you need really, if you're going to bring MCPs and just care for threat the bear tank is going to win all day but when it comes down to mitigation its certainly another story
---
It helps me not spend money on alcohol and it pushes me to work out after being on my ass for hours, so I’d say WoW Classic has done me well
---
No offence taken. People just want their gear. My friend and me are full bis geared and we basically never wipe. We often take people sub 60 and even then it goes extremely smooth.
---
We need the gold, they need the gear, everyone takes what they need hopefully.
---
DejaClassicStats  
---
But why you simply don't search any addon collection for "stat"?
---
Stop talking it up so much! I'm at work you're making me want to take off early and hulk smash some people haha
---
Yep, search for detailed stats or something similar to that name.
---
Theres 55 people in my raid roster im not responsible for them getting their gear. If im available to help sure ill help but im not gonna hold everyones hand.
---
Its everyones own responsibility to play the game and get geared before going into a raid otherwise you're not pulling your weight as much as others.
---
A blessing?
---
It takes around 60 games to get to exalted. That is 15 hours of doing nothing but waiting in queue. For someone who has limited playtime, this is fucking insane.
---
I just dinged 50 last night (and as evidence that every event has its corresponding appropriate Princess Bride quote, I submit: "NOT TO FIFTY!"), and I'm wondering where I should go levelling next. I just about finished Hinterlands (got a smidge away from 50 after Jintha'Alor quests, and turned in one to ding), so I have the choice of going back down and finishing off Tanaris, heading from there to Un'Goro and Silithus, or I could follow the breadcrumb I just picked up to go to the Plaguelands. 
---
My main concern is that I don't want to have to backtrack to pick up any essential questlines that I may have missed by levelling in the wrong zones. I'd like to be as far along in attunements as I can be once I get to 60, so I'm trying to choose my levelling zones appropriately.
---
And by asking this question, it's probably obvious that I never played Vanilla. I started playing WoW in April 2007 during TBC, so I never really did endgame of Vanilla.
---
Thoughts?
---
It's better to do 55-60 in dungeons, because at level 60 quests will give you additional gold instead of exp.  
---
IIRC 1 exp = 6 bronze coins, so 4k exp quest will additionally provide 2.4 gold.
---
Try poking around in the monitor's OSD to see if there are any options to mess with there.
---
I've found leveling as a Rogue WAY easier than most classes.
---
I leveled both a Horde and Ally Rogues so far.
---
Played Combat from level 10 on to 60 (maces with humans cus it was funny and sword as orc)
---
Got the 5% dodge, 5% parry and Riptose talents to make leveling easier.
---
Focuses on quests only 2 levels bellow me, NEVER did orange and yellow except if no other quest is available.
---
2nd time i leveled to 60 was much easier, since i knew my limitations and pulls, was a breeze and had a lot of fun experiencing the ally quests.
---
I'd recommend Rogue for leveling your first char, you can learn a lot.
---
Oh yeah, I understand now.
---
Haha, actually I have but the result with BT is the same. I've tried with a clean install of wow (deleted WTF and cache and disabled addons), same result. So l'm beginning to doubt it ever worked. Blood fury is on a global cooldown so that is likely the reason. Ns macros on other toons work fine in any scenario.
---
I don’t agree with them being the squishiest since they can death coil, grenade, fear, dot and shadow bolt and you will 9 out of 10 be dead.
---
Do you also get the 24h honoryield cd from crossrealm players??
---
Hunter is not even close to being the worst pvp class. Try again.
---
Classic “I did it this way so why can’t everyone else do it the same way”. You still sound like a cancerous raid leader. This is a community game, people join guilds to play with other guildies. But you seem like the guy that just wants his gear and to get out. Should stick to retail buddy
---
Yeah, it bothers me I can't mv someone flying out of Ironforge and get out of zone.  Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but it used to be you could go across the continent if you really wanted to.
---
Who you calling them dudes?
---
Works fine for me. Not however that it will show up as "?" since you have modifier for both spells. If you want you can have it as this to cast Frost ward when pressed and Fire ward when shift + hotkey:
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/cast \[mod:shift\]Fire ward; Frost Ward
---
Or maybe like this to have it cast Ice barrier on press, Frost Ward on shift, Fire Ward on ctrl: 
---
/cast \[mod:shift\] Frost Ward; \[mod:ctrl\] Fire Ward; Ice Barrier
---
If you don't have Ice Barrier, you can replace it with Mana Shield
---
No trees in amazon? *cries*
---
&gt;Ok so you have to practice a bit before you nail the best xp &amp; gold/per hour farm in the game.
---
Yep, makes sense that only on the very bleeding edge is where the highest rate is achieved.  Much like like the tradeoffs you find at any very competitive level.  I used to be big into fast cars, and shaving off weight and reliability for power was described in many ways, my favorite was "Peak power is built on the verge of destruction".  Same holds true with Mage AoE farming.
---
Advertising death rolls in public channels is bannable keep in mind.
---
You aren't all that far behind, only 1 raid tier is out now. We still have at least 4-5 months of MC/BWL for you to get pre-BIS.
---
People join my guild to raid.
---
Alliance has a far superior base. And a bridge.
---
Where are you located? If USA are you east or west? Also are you looking for a pve server or a pvp server?
---
If you're looking for pve it definitely makes your choice simpler as there are less of them out there. I'd suggest looking at ironforge.pro for realm populations. However make sure to avoid some of the top realms like faerlina as you'll get 1-2 hour long queue times depending on when you play.
---
Same as your mum
---
Apparently yes. So after 4 kills they essentially give no honor in BGs.
---
Theres different variants, my server does this.
---
Two people agree on an amount "We'll deathroll for 100g"
---
Someone starts by picking a random number so say it's 45726, they'll do /roll 1-45726 and assume it rolls a 100. The other person then rolls 1-100, first to 1 loses and pays the other the agreed amount (100g in this example)
---
Got the bad luck out of the way?
---
I'll test it out later, but yeh, neither Frost Ward or Fire Ward would work. Not sure why I am struggling with this macro.
---
I've been able to get out of the zone, but a couple zones away it stops working. I also think it depends where they're going.
---
You should shave your neck beard
---
I gotta be honest with you, i'd be upset! But holy congratulations!
---
Press Print Screen to take a screenshot
---
Would love to see a similar plan from 50 for Rogues. When I asked elsewhere in this thread, I didn't even think about specific gear items to pick up.
---
Like the first mars rover from nasa
---
I really hope its optional to switch to TBC when the time comes, because a lot of us playing now are people who quit around the time of TBC and Wrath because we didn't like the changes made in these expansions. I know I will be quitting if they force us all onto TBC, and so will many of my friends.
---
you also act like a child and release a conversation out of context
---
I thought gambling like that was against the EULA? Or is that only on EU realms due to the European Gambling laws?
---
I laughed so you get an upvote, but there is probably a place in hell reserved for you.
---
A text box pops up about 10 seconds after I hit play on battlenet app. And I was playing yesterday morning alright. Sorry can't figure how to link a picture? New to reddit...
---
I rerolled on a pve server and while auction house is kinda...mneh... people there seem to level way more characters than what was on a pvp server. People also seem way more talkative than on a pvp server.
---
Problem is maybe I just had bad luck with my pvp server or met mostly neat people on the pve one.
---
Maybe all these levelers are all pvp migrants. Then again I got a lock to 46 and a few days ago a pally to 18 and quite a lot of lfm/lfg talks in westfall general for deadmines.
---
I'd say you should first decide if you want pvp, pve, rp, rp-pvp realm.
---
Never tell me what to never tell. The odds are very low
---
Ever heard about screenshot buttons on every keyboard ? Or f12 that take a screenshot on most video games ?
---
Still someone who has played 100 games of AV is likely better than average. Even getting 10 players in your game with a solid strategy can make a huge difference
---
"screenshot"
---
Tank use a fast weapon in MH for threat generation and enchant procs but it's not quite true for a dps.
---
As an orc warrior you are better off with a slow weapon with high end damage in main hand (the 1h axe off Ony) and a fast weapon in OH (flurry axe) 
---
Also if you are dual wielding you need closer to 8-9% hit even as an orc with +5 axe. A lot of websites give different numbers but most agree around 8-9% is the right amount.
---
Do people run Ragefire Chasm? I started an alt and I know Stockades on the Alliance side is run often, but in my short time with my Horde alt - haven't seen anyone run RFC.
---
Something similar happened to me in Blasted Lands.  Me (paladin) and an undead priest were clearing to an Elite Felbeast dude in a cave.  We got to the mob, and I just figured I'd be nice and let them have it (I was higher level and could have maybe solo'd it after) so I pointed at him.  They start attacking it and I help them down it.  To my surprise, we both got to complete the quest because you just have to talk to a ghost dude that comes out of the boss!  This was on a PVP server as well (before phase 2 tho of course) so these moments are always nice.
---
Whats grinds my gears is when 1 "gold farming" video, 11 more youtubers makes a smililar video and then if that farm spot isnt a dungeon, then RIP.
---
Gnomes are the strongest race for Warriors in PvP on the Alliance side
---
Not only that, but Orpheus is a black Warlock, totally thought this toon was an Homage.
---
Just came across this thread, out of curiosity, how did you confirm it was deja? I'll remove mine tonight to test, been trying to solve this for weeks. Had it bug on me running flag in WSG last night :/
---
Upwards of 1800g per hour ! Lol but for real I’ve done that run back over 500 times from resisted pick pockets lol
---
Imo in the whole game. Ofc hardiness is nice but 1min cd to get out of nova/roots is just broken. Speaking as a orc
---
Ghosting?
---
well he inspects him in the clip :P
---
gnome bis race for warrior
---
No one is saying you have to give them a "free pass" for being dicks.  You can be livid at the honor farmers for their actions while still recognizing that the system is inherently flawed.
---
bridge isn't a thing lol just use back door
---
I got their comment. I see non-tank, non-heal is just a pure DPS spec.  non-heal, non-dps is tank spec.  non-dps,non-tank is heal spec.
---
But you can spec 0/30/21 and still be able to Tank/DPS/Heal with the same spec, at least dungeons but I've seen it used in PUG raids.  So, it's not really a "non" in anything.  
---
Thus, you can have a "Druid LFG" and they ask you "Which spec are you" and you just respond "yes".
---
Have you tried using the browser version instead of the app?
---
This is similar to where I am for raid. It’s getting tougher to show up when I know I’m waiting around for one boss. It really is the nature of the beast though, so I suck it up.
---
Can you go to your wow folder and try manually opening wow.exe both as administrator (right click run as admin) and normal double click?
---
Oh boy, here we go!
---
It's a gambling game. You know how you can type _/roll_ to roll a random 100? Well you can type _/roll n_, where _n_ is any number you want.
---
So for simplicity let's roll from 1000, so person A does a _/roll 1000_. He gets 674. 
---
Person B rolls the result of person A's roll, so now does a _/roll 674_. He gets 332.
---
Person A now takes that result (_/roll 332_).
---
Rinse and repeat until one of the two hits 1, and (usually) wins. 
---
As you can tell from this thread, there isn't really one set of rules that everyone utilizes so make sure you know what you're getting into if you're rolling people you don't know!
---
i'm not downvoting anything loser
---
Same, DM E is now my most profitable farm spot. AOE pally farming
---
is escape artist more useful than the extra level of cloak from NE racial?
---
Basically whenever I strafe left or right, NPC’s and characters have a slight red ghosting or shadow to them. When I move my camera around it’s not buttery smooth
---
Just logged on at 7pm EU time, 30 level 60s online.
---
I have not. Have you used this version? Does it work the same?
---
Yeah, I just need Ony and 2x of the same ring off Domo. Once I get the ony pants and trinket I don't need him anymore.
---
Lmao wat? You seem irrationally angry that i dont hold players hands.
---
If your goal is to collect mounts I think BfA is more up your alley
---
90%+ of people play for every other reason then pvp racials and on that note racials are fairly balanced. This is not retail. Find a new argument already.
---
You realize that google search results might very heavily from person to person and device to device? I got no blue post on the first page.
---
I just trade mages for water/food for a healthstone/soulstone. It doesn't cost me money anymore.
---
I would go with ES and save the gold and skip TuF. If you are playing in premades if you connect with the druid its almost guaranteed the mage will be in ES range for nova and it could be pretty sick. Both of these are incredible for stopping druids but i would argue ES AOE stun is better. Saving the gold and using it on FAPS , LIPS, Swiftness and rocket boots will impact your gameplay way more than the weapon upgrade. If gold is not an issue and you are pugging wsg a lot id go for TuF for those games.  
---
TLDR : Save the gold and just use ES, try and get BRE or Spinal for dmg and just use ES for cc on efc. Applying MS way more important than your damage.
---
To support this anecdote, in STV prior to BGs, I was killed approximately 14 times in a three hour play period. In the Badlands, I was camped non-stop by 3 level 60s until I logged out. I logged back in to BL yesterday and completed all of my quests without a single attack. Going to STV, I got killed twice (and killed one warrior who thought to gank me while mining). Four horde left me completely alone, and two even helped me finish quest mobs.
---
As expected, the undead rogue was the asshole.
---
It's both, I'm with you. I replied to people that said "It's Blizzard's fault". Maybe partially, but not totally.
---
Well Ony and MC are being routinely pugged and ZG/AQ20 likely will be as well when they come out.  Ony is usually less than an hour and MC is less than 4 hours once a week.
---
Get inner focus and 15% mana regen while casting from disc tree. Maybe 2 in holy for no push back. Then all in on shadow, starting with the +spirit after a kill talent (hands down the most important talent for a priest lvling up)
---
Terrible Mage, great Ganker, great Tank and great Healer
---
FTFY
---
This is extremely server dependant.  Devilsaur is dirt cheap on my server nowadays and 150g per hour from skinning is like a pipe dream.
---
Your dad sounds like most people here actually.
---
I've been using Earthshaker in WSG and it is absolutely nutty. It has something like a 12.5% proc rate and stuns longer than EF. You gotta remember that it still hits pretty damn hard too. As time goes on gear in your other slots will help make up the damage difference but that proc will win you fights you had no business winning the entire game.
---
Burst and CC wins PvP fights. It is an A+++ CC weapon and still like a B on damage. TUF is probably B on CC and a B+ on damage.
---
Haha, well if you ever knew the Twinktastic Bunnies from Silver Hand back in vanilla, let me know. Would love to play with some of those guys again. Sadly, i was 10 years old back then and never kept in contact.
---
I am in the servers twink discord, so as you said, i might just have to join the premades and succumb to the current playstyle.
---
Pilav man, working class hero of world of warcraft.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
This is kinda my problem with them changing it also. It just becomes a loot corpses as fast as possible, if you got a better pc then you will have better odds also. Atleast with group loot you had a chance if you were nearby. Fuck master loot tho, so idk what i prefer more, leader being able to change it or FFA like it is now.
---
I see more LFG spam for RFC, WC and SM than anything else combined.
---
Must be nice to be able to pvp sith your friends on Alliance.
---
The real gem is in the comments.
---
Gross gnome
---
Pve is great. I started at launch, haven’t hit 60 yet. Just don’t have enough time to play. You can still get hear. Just offer to tank everything and you should be fine.
---
&gt; Solakar Flamewreath = Bring 40 with full world buffs and consumables
---
Fun fact: my group of 5 wiped on the gauntlet part of that encounter. Probably got to like 3rd wave or 4th wave, not sure. Either way as a group of 5 we got decimated since we had no AOE. We all ran back. Mobs were still chilling there. Suddenly Solakar spawns and runs towards the beacon even though we died on the previous wave. We pull Solakar as he runs towards the pylon and only he pulls. The rest of the mobs stand still at the pylon. He dies and drops the fire reflector pattern and my priest friend won it. Sold it for like 150 gold or so. It was pretty crazy.
---
In vanilla most realms were "dead realms" with these large populations atleast "low pop" is quite large by vanilla standards. Better to have to compete for resources then have a dead economy which is susceptible to one person buying out all matts and holding a monopoly over them. Also helps with organizing pug 5mans.
---
They fixed that. It's random now.
---
I don't want to sound racist, so I'm shutting myself up.
---
Power for the Forsaken!
---
I'm trying to make something to gather herbs as minority faction on a pvp server, so winning pvp is less the concern than not having to corpserun
---
Yep i've always hated the elitism from classic, i'd rather just get gladiator gear on my own and not deal with a guild and tryhard nerds, really hoping they do BC
---
Thats really nice!
---
This is the right answer.  If you dont have a switch, you better go give Santa a lap dance and hope for one.  Or buy it if you're in to that kind of thing.
---
It's from a reliable source, I dare say it's so crazy it must be true
---
For higher level dungeons yes. A geared paladin for ape farming can do like all of sm cath. Armor 100% all of it.
---
commenting for later, since i also would like to know this
---
Only the better hero class. Lmao jk.
---
I could see some value if you really like your class but don't want to contantly respec back and forthfrom pvp to pve.
---
There are benefits for multiple toons, but this is the only benefit I can think of that would be exclusive to a duplicate class.
---
Completely agree with everything you said.
---
I guess I was just hoping for that nostalgic twinking, where it was only a few per side who really understood it. I wasn't aware people played private servers twinking until classic came out, that's where most of the current twinks i met have come from.
---
However, i was mainly wondering if horde have a similar experience, as so many of my alliance BG members have been non-twinks when i solo queue.
---
The variants, however, agree upon one thing: In order to instigate a deathroll, one must yell WHO WANTS TO GO THE DISTANCE???
---
OP specified Horde.
---
What?
---
Well I disagree and think there is a more happy medium. My vanilla server wasn't the most popular but was far from dead and it felt better. And if someone tried to buyout some resource from the AH, I could always go and reasonably farm farm for them myself, which isn't the case on classic's mega servers. Every spot is always occupied 24/7 across numerous different highly sought after resources.
---
You actually read the post?
---
I’m looking for the same. Keep hearing about the premade discord but people are saying it’s closed now
---
Race doesn't matter versus players then. If you are running around in stealth no horde are going to see you, dismount, and attack. Most of the good gold from herring is from Maraudon and Dire maul for ghost mushrooms anyways.
---
Since WOW gold doesn't really have any benefit other than in-game (save for illicit gold marketeering), I don't think it hits the gambling bylaws in EU. The US laws are so outdated that deathroll doesn't even come close to fitting gambling, of course.
---
"Simple change your work schedule"
---
Since you’re herb you can do dm east jump runs. Just do it for the herbs. Go find all the ghost mushroom dreamfoil n shit near the lashers.
---
It's noticeable there's more horde, but it's nothing game breaking, especially now WPvP is over.
---
I believe the latest ruling about it from Blizzard was that it’s allowed as long as you are not spamming regular channels with advertising for it. European Gambling laws, I think, only apply to games where you pay real money for a chance to win something from a group of items, ie lootboxes.
---
Keep in mind though, I don’t know what happens if you get scammed or someone runs away with your money.
---
Looks like you're not the only one with a short attention span ;)
---
So, blizzard let a server die, introduce realm transfer to profit from it. Then they will merge the server with another to 'recover' reputation.
---
Seriously fuck this company.
---
I have not paid for another game, and it has saved me over 500 since release. I have no plans on spending anymore until well after bwl. 
---
  There hasn't been a amazing pc game to spend money on in a bit, I have been stuck buying games and getting bored within days.
---
Why shut down the server? :S
---
/horde
---
why? Then people will cry for classic dedicated servers again like they did back during BC/WOTLK. 
---
Classic for life is the only real solution. Yes optional BC servers might work, but the population of each would be much less than current classic since people will be split about staying in classic versus porting their character to BC.
---
Thanks for the response. This looks like a lot of fun to me.
---
By the time I get all the way out there my hearth is back up.
---
It's like that movie I Am Legend
---
Yeah, nothing in that comment was vitriolic screeching. Was it the word “bullshit” that really drew the line, or the rather tame message?
---
Also, saying private servers did *it* better, in regards to server lag, isn’t hateful at all. It’s actually factual. Private servers aren’t better than Classic as a whole, but the server lag was actually much more reduced. 
---
Now obviously this is partly because Blizzard has more measures in place to handle bots or keep tabs on the players, which does ramp up the lag... that doesn’t mean that private servers were way more playable in high density situations. I’m actually really glad I got to experience open world PVP battles that I could actually play in. It’s night and day to large scale battles or gatherings in Classic. 
---
To say that those who say “private servers lagged less” is mindless, is ironically mindless.
---
And here I thought the point of raiding was to have fun.
---
&gt;Imo in the whole game
---
Pve they're not even close to humans
---
Damn, I've been playing for three months and am only level 23 with mid-tier gear. Some of you guys are crazy fast
---
And yet if you were to turn up and roll in this group, people would probably not know you’re betting 500g. Everyone does it differently.
---
&gt; Is their reference client screwed and unreliable?
---
This could very well be handled 100% server side, so a reference client may not help here. Their explanation of the server workings was that they take the old data with the current server implementation, having modified the format of the data to fit it. So perhaps they do not even have a good reference for it.
---
In any case, Blizzard has done some stealth changes to remove problems (like the summonable chicken that gives dhk) so it might be that they just feel it's "not as intended" which is determined who knows how?
---
Blizzard is frustratingly silent on lots of issues, that's just how they roll I suppose.
---
Thunderfury is pretty balanced.
---
You can’t read up?
---
Shit, you mean I can just go down to Feralas and wait for this?
---
It lasted up until wotlk when they made it so you can't advertise "casinos" on public channels. You won't get banned for gambling, but you might get muted if you spam trade chat or yell on top of AH.
---
My dad got me into WoW too. He died back in 2009 and playing it now reminds me of his kind, caring and loving personality towards everyone. He taught me to be a better me through this game and as I venture through, encountering parts of this game I'd forgotten, I'm reminded of him - providing some of the most amazing yet sombre experiences of my life. 
---
Please tell your family you love them, ya never know when it's gonna be too late
---
Depends what you use them for. Humans got better PvE racials.
---
How much you can reserve will be up to the market.  First orb in strat,  all "unneeded", all unneeded BOEs are common reserves.  I've seen tanks reserve all scourgestones in strat/scholo as well.  Reserving multiple things like that is probably pushing it, but depends on the market and current desperation for DPS/healers to find groups. 
---
DPS/healers can still come and get their BIS BOP drops, or depending on how you word it, any BIS BOE.  
---
They're mostly BOP drops, but there's a chance at a rare, valuable BOE almost anywhere you are killing 55+ mobs.  That's worth a ton of money so you might consider how you word your reserve.  If you just reserve "unneeded" and Maiden's Circle or Freezing Band drops (both ultra rare BOE), a caster would be justified in clicking need on it if they intend to equip it If you reserve "all BOEs," its yours to sell on the AH for hundreds of gold, and the caster should really only be coming for the BOP drops.
---
Disclaimer:  this information is from my memory of elemental invasions from vanilla 15 years ago.  I have vivid memories of coming across multiple elemental invasions, some highly contested and others by myself.  
---
They are all random, and independent one another.  The best way to search for them is to park an alt where the invasion spawns in, and pop in every now and then to see if they've arrived.  
---
At the beginning of each invasion, there is a named "boss" elemental that will send out a zone-wide yell.  After that a certain number of elementals spawn in and once they're all killed, the invasion is over.  I believe the boss will yell every few minutes as long as he's alive.   The elementals and boss have a higher % drop rate for their corresponding elements and essences.
---
Nicknamed myself to High Warlord dropout D:, got really sick before I could get r14.  Lost a month of hard work in a week, had to throw in the towel.
---
I've seen death roll mentioned a few times, what is it?
---
You can indeed do it without improved feign death, but it greatly increases the chances that you will die an annoying death on the way to the boss. You rely on FD too much when doing tribute runs to not have it upgraded imo (unless you're only doing a couple of runs and can't be bothered to respec). 
---
I'm not concerned with FD getting resisted on the boss fight. The boss is usually easily kited when that happens. Getting resisted on the way to the boss is the real danger and is far more likely to happen. 
---
I definitely want some of your luck if you've done 15 runs in a row without improved feign death and without any resists on your way to the boss.
---
It depends on your spec and if you're referencing pvp or pve.
---
If you're using backstab primarily I'd say go for the extra energy I'd even consider going 31 into assassination for PvP for the 120 energy that's 2 backstabs you can use right away.
---
You are out of your mind if you think 60/40 is severe or unrecoverable.
---
It's not about what you can do with a spec, it's about the role you're applying to fulfill in the group.
---
For PvP.
---
In the whole game, for PvP.
---
I haven't gotten raid lead since the change, but can they still not change it to master loot? If not why couldn't they have done that while maintaining group loot as the default option?
---
As far as maximum fun potential, earthshaker with mace spec is fucking hilarious. It might not be as min max good as UF, but goddamn did I have a blast in vanilla with my earthshaker and mace spec
---
What? How did you get that from what I said?
---
We’re not fast, you’re slow.
---
How much health does it have? If I remember correctly it dies pretty quick.
---
&gt; It's not the community
---
Bullshit. Blizzard had a more strict system, and the community constantly abused it. This is 100% the community's fault.
---
How does that support your statement: "Bypassing that with a second account is a bannable offense afaik."
---
played undead mage in vanilla and BC.  now play alliance warlock in classic.    
---
Mage was a great time, but honestly i was always so jealous of warlocks.  I'm very happy i made the decision to switch.  also on my and most servers there are way more mages than warlocks.  helps you stand out :).
---
hope this helps!
---
That's RAD AF!
---
Well I’ve been in the same guild since launch and I don’t need any pre raid bis on either of my 60s. But just because you don’t need gear doesn’t mean you stop running dungeons for people in your guild. Whatever I’m done with this haha, glad I’m not in a guild with a self centered raid leader. Wouldn’t be surprised if you loot yourself stuff later on and convince your guild “it’s for the best of the guild” nah it’s just the best for you
---
yeah, as a rogue player, every time i see an orc in a pvp environment i just let out a heavy sigh
---
Hahaha sure thing internet life guru
---
Just a wild guess, does the Reagent Tracker get them?
---
Housing prices crashed after the insane housing inflation of the early-to-mid bubble, but rent costs have slowly kept creeping up.

Wowhead, apparently.
---
It really depends on what type of pvp you would like to do. Are you the type that sits in the back and bursts anything that runs into your lines or are you the type who is harassing into their lines, targeting healers and cloth? 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If you're likely to be more defensive than a more pve leaning spec would serve you better as you'll more often then not have support and your survivability will rest on strength in numbers more so than your ability to create space. Applicable to AV and if you're rolling in a group and or protecting healers. I would probably play with this spec: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-0525103051303-0325032002303/1bbbbppp2BccDfffKG1cc2MP. I would be laying a lot more traps to control the flow of melee players and single targeting guys. You're less maneuverable if melee is on you but you should have teammates around to deal with them and if you've positioned properly, can still engage targets on your healers at range. Sacrificing TSA for 3% more crit is also valuable because you should be able to get more Aimed shots off which hit much harder with crit. If I used this build I would be around 30% crit
---
If you're more likely to be forward of your main body harassing their lines or wpvp, you want a build that helps you create space. You need to be able to take a few hits and separate their healers from their main body. You also have to manage more than one target usually, delaying the melee and focusing the healer who is moving around now to out range you while trying to stay in range of their guys. This is my current build: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-45051030513051-00502520103/1bbbbPq2FG1aa
---
Keep in mind I'm also almost BIS raid geared and prioritized stamina where possible for pvp and keep a build that is effective for raiding so I don't have to constantly respec. I run with Aspect of the Monkey with max rank AV trinket for the extra dodge and I'm usually in a G group with a healer. Deterrence, Scatter, and Imp Conc allow me to manage anyone trying to melee and allows me to push into their lines, focusing their healers off their game. I also can't tell you how many times mages, rogues, and warriors have tried to jump me within melee range and I end up winning with huge raptor strikes and mongoose bites because of deterrence, 9% dodge, and imp parry. It's never 1v1 and all you have to do is out survive them. People tend to forget Hunters can easily push over 4k health unbuffed and with imp raptor strike and our staff, crit for just over 1k on everyone except warriors. This plays incredibly well on people who stereotype hunters as impotent in melee range. This build also gives you a very good chance of resisting the opening stun from a rogue in stealth, which then lands them a wingclip + RS + Mongoose macro, scatter shot, pvp trinket (they'll land an auto usually with poisons applied), and they are on their way to destination fucked. 
---
It's not min/max but take a regular cat built for dedicated PVP. Prowl (if you're NE like me), Dash, Bite, Claw (No Growl). Take Max rank frost resist, max damage spells, as much health as you can, back fill with armor if you have any points left. The push back works on casters, two damage spells allow for more burst, and frost resist is incredibly effect for annoying mages. If your pet opens on a clothie out of stealth you're good for 200 or more damage in a second which is really good for a build with zero points into your pet and enough to make the other player take your pet seriously
---
effective hunters are the ones who manage the situation around them. Our job is to create or take away space in group pvp. Decide how you want to do that and make your build cater to it. We have a lot of flexibility in how we play
---
I haven't been lead either, but every leader i've whispered says they're not able to change it at all. Group loot as the default without being able to change it as you're saying would be my prefered way also.
---
I legit cannot decide between my hunter and my druid. Hunter is level 29 and druid is level 34. Can somebody give me the pros/cons of both, both from a gameplay and a class fantasy perspective? I don't really care which role I go between tank, healer, or DPS, I just can't really find which is more fun. Somebody tilt me in one direction or the other
---
I can attest to this 100% 😂
---
I think you're confused about who you're replying to, because I never made that statement.
---
Just wait til all your dagger rogues have cht. I bet it's less contested than viskag
---
Ya'll aren't bad people, Blizzard fostered this shit system and you're just playing to their rules if other players can't compete at the levels you guys do then fuck em they're not worthy of r14.

---
That's an interesting solution to the fury warrior/rogue problem in raids, wherein every FW and rogue needs TWO weapons and it takes for damn ever to gear them all up.
---
By undercutting someone on the AH, you're basically trying to send the message "Buy from me, I'm the lowest price!"  1c is 1/100th of 1% of 1g.  That's a rounding error, not actual price differentiation.
---
It's like the ads on TV that loudly proclaim "All for under $1,000!!!" when the price is $999.99.  Give me a break.  Granted in real life products actually differ between sellers, but my "bullshit, fuck that guy" alarm still goes off when I see someone undercutting anything worth more than about 3 silver by only 1 copper.
---
Yes, it isn't a buff on you or your party, it's a debuff on the enemy so it benefits anybody who attacks that enemy. You can put hunter's mark on a world boss and have 500 hunter shooting it and everybody will benefit from it.
---
And work on your attunement quests.

If you aren't in a big rush, make yourself some mooncloth bags for your bank before you drop it
---
Are you not stacking even among yourselves? If you only mean with others on the server then yes thats kind of a bad call. There will be a guy who can mess you up, there always is. Generally its not good to be rude while ranking and its not a good idea to box people out unless you can 100% maintain it. AV meta is not the time to try to dominate. I think the play is to stack but make it clear you will be br1 and br2 and get along with others to make stacking easier. If meta shifts to WSG this will be easier.
---
Pick the best one and wait for the other to cycle through all those that want it.

Not the point, guilds/players want it for higher parses and faster clears.

Not anymore; hehe ;)

It takes 3-5 additional minutes for 5% extra crit. If you think that you won't gain that back in MC if the whole raid has it, i don't know what to tell you. I guess, why even bother for Ony buff then?
---
I never said *I* needed to do research. But for someone clueless enough to need guides, at least get a halfway decent one.
---
Lf Invite, mc geared mage, epic mount, mage blade, etc
---
Would this make it the best place to rank up as Alliance?  If there are only a few Alliance on the server and ranks are rewarded based on the honor you gain vs others in the server, wouldn’t this be the easiest place to do it?  I don’t fully understand the ranking system so I may be wrong.
---
Itemrack allows you to specify a set to autoequip and unequip when you have a "Mounted" condition. Fair warning- it is no longer being supporter because the creator stopped playing WoW. No issues with it so far.
---
You can automate this with ItemRack using the `Mounted` event.

almost any form of video gaming is cheaper than more physical hobbies.

Spaulders of valor tho
---
&gt; But just because you don’t need gear doesn’t mean you stop running dungeons for people in your guild.
---
I never said I do not run dungeons for other people... I don't know why you keep repeating this. I just don't jerk my self off to thinking about it. Its not whats fun for me and doesn't give me the drive to keep logging in. I don't find enjoyment out of just playing for other people I'm sorry im normal?
---
I don’t think people are crazy fast, I just think you are really slow. (Nothing wrong with being slow, people have different schedules and lives)
---
&gt;In conclusion, is this something we’re really going to continue to ignore and not kick up a fuss to blizzard?
---
If you're so worried about it why not submit a bug report to blizzard instead of bitching about it here.  By all means this is a place to discuss this stuff but if you have not submitted a ticket then the problem does not exist.

Again, it's usually an addon, but when you have 300 auctions going up every hour, undercutting by 1c is still reducing the price of that 3 silver item to ...  1 copper...
---
Yes... Usually. I've rolled with people who were used to 'First to one wins'-games, and if there's a few on my server, there's a lot of them out there all over the world.   
---
Before you roll, make sure everyone agrees on the rolls. That's all I'm saying.

The fastest I have ever reached throne room, and this is without having to wait for a pat because I got lucky, was 9 minutes. The dogs usually take 2 min to kill, but 70% of the time you will reach the throne room when the dogs are patrolling away, their full pat takes like 10 minutes. So on a typical run, it's a 20 or more minute average wait to begin fighting king gordok, who takes anywhere from 8 to 14 minutes depending on the class Cho Rush is that ID.
---
Don't get me wrong, the DM farm is still madly worth it and is awesomely fun, but every guide over ever seen is highly inflated. You will consistently pull in 60-70g/ph when doing the run about 80% correct.
---
Pug raids are very common Grob, and I'd imagine that's true on other servers. Don't pigeonhole yourself, though if you don't like to tank in any capacity warrior may not be the best choice, not that you will be forced to tank raids but the "you don't tank?" will come up alot during leveling and in the 60 5 mans.
---
Don't you want perdition Blade over viskag for pvp? Im pretty sure perd+CHT is real good dps in raids too
---
If you haven't yet, you can do searing gorge and blasted lands before heading to Un'goro (for which 50 is a little low, 52-53 should be better to start there).

Elv is just TOO small and minimal, yes I know it can be changed but im not going to spend an hour changing every single aspect of a UI package just so I can ready simple text and numbers.  This is about perfect, flat, easy to read, minimal.

My experience has not been this. I just got into a guild that's pretty much Pre raid and raid bis, takes us 2.5 hours to clear both.

Yes also change your resolution in Nvidia control center to 144hz

Not even whole PvP lol, they could've simply said PvP
---
We also have the same thing happening here with ally on ZT lol. You would save everyones time, including your own, if you just cooperate with the others.
---
I don't think this is that viable, maybe very niche things, but there isn't a lot of parry gear. In bc when we got gems we got parry gems to help stack but that's all
---
If you're adding 20 to a roll your potential window should be 20-120
---
International standards are great. Words never said by an American
---
wpvp is 100% dead for this server. That's a big reason of playing the game. They should force transfer the horde onto a higher ally/horde ratio server and close this one.
---
You CAN, but only if you're really really really good and everything goes right.
---
I mean, in the context of winning the game, killing drek *is* the sole objective. The other objectives are supplementary. 
---
If you want to argue "oh horde actually gets more honor per hour", or "oh alliance gets more rep" thats different. Pretty sure the comment thread was regarding wins explicitly.
---
Yah I think that spec is perfectly fine, ive just been testing with relentless strikes and for me and my raid we clear fast, so being able to pump out more energy helps keep my dps solid especially since we are daggers you really want to backstab as much as possible, auto attacks are a large chunk of damage but its not 70% of your dps like it would be as swords for example.
---
I think either way you probably wouldn't see too much of a difference, I just run this more because of my raids clear speed I think.
---
You can rename though, just create a char with the same name on your target server.
---
How do you know they gave their home address to a random stranger online? How do you know he didn't just give them the address to a P.O. Box or the local USPS or even UPS?
---
You do realize all I lose by speccing into lightwell is some ~+13 healing at current levels, and it means someone else casts the divine spirits and I cast more PW:Fs. You really think +13 to heals does more than 4k healing over a fight?
---
Usually I’m seeing 144FPS
---
You being competitive dps says a lot about the other dps in your raid.
---
I never used Earthshaker in Vanilla. I hit 13 using Ashkandi and I spent a lot of time pvping as both arms and fury, hit glad a couple of times and with all that experience all I can say is that ES feels overpowered as hell. I see people in this thread talking about TUF is better for large scale PVP... wut?
---
The only accurate comment is the guy saying ES let’s him win a 1v1 he would never normally win, like vs a mage. The prof is insane, happens all the time and on top of it PVP isn’t a DPS simulator. A mid speed weapon, 3.3-3.5, is the best compromise of top end and getting another swing in IMO.
---
I’ve personally wiped the horde on Van/Generals with a proc, it’s goes off all the time and it fills the huge hole warriors have in their kit which is CC.
---
I feel like people saying anything else with the current weapons we have has no real clue what they’re talking about. Maybe GM/Ashkandi level weapons are better but I wouldn’t want to comment until I used the like again as it was so long ago and this FrankenPatch has made all sorts of weird things happen. Old school Vanilla duels could last over a minute, now it’s lucky if it’s 20-30 seconds, where a proc would make a huge difference .
---
It’s default is set to 144hz
---
60/40 is better than most vanilla servers.
---
And there will always be a side with a pop advantage - 60/40 is very tame. Be glad you aren't looking at 75-25.
---
You can do what you want, but if I was in the other guilds that couldn't get R14 members up due to your tactics, I would leave your guild hanging any way I could.  If I see the opposite faction ganking your members, i'd point and laugh while waving to the attacker.  If I joined an AV, I would do whatever I can to make your gains as painful as possible and try to convince others to do the same.  If I was selling services, I would upcharge 1000% to your guild only and I would camp your member's grind spots to make it a pain for them.  If I had a dungeon group going as tank, I would make sure to invite only your members and drag the mobs to cause a wipe over and over again while pretending to be clueless.
---
R14 is not the only pvp end game ;)

Let us set UP a warlock trainer in TB and we might accomodate...

PFFF! Paggle had no NPCs in IF this tuesday, including the flightmaster, so they reset the instance while everyone was raiding. We did ony head twice during MC, and that 10 min lag wasn't the end of the world :P
---
All lagers look like apple juice but OK, and IDK why you act like you can tell a beer is flat from a picture. Unless your tasting it or watching it be poured then theres literally no way to tell its flat from this.
---
I think you're right. My bad.

This is maybe the dumbest post I have seen on this sub. Everything you said is wrong. Maybe just don't comment on stuff you don't know anything about.
---
My guild actually does the same thing, it keeps it from people wanting "all" the weapons, like while yes you can use a sword and a dagger, optimal is either or
---
I love the chuckleheads who use that feature and list their bid at 1c.

I m 100% with you. I didnt like resilience at all. For me that was the worst stat ever. The only think i would love, if they can open TBC talent tree on some classic server. Just like 2.0 was on vanila 2 month prior to TBC
---
On Smolderweb-Alliance the most active guilds have a world chat channel for the Gm's to coordinate Ony buffs
---
Raiding was no longer "fun" for me in TBC for numerous reasons. First of all, it didn't have the same epic feel for me that the notoriously difficult 40-mans did. There wasn't the same feeling of euphoria that you got when you killed some boss. That went away. Secondly, getting gear from raids no longer seemed important to me because it was useless in pvp. If I'm going to invest my time into raiding, I want to be able to use that gear in other situations. And as a big PVP fan back then, it just wasn't feasible for me to both raid full time and run arenas to stack resilience gear.  These factors ultimately led me to losing any sense of magic the game once gave me, and I quit because of it. No doubt that will happen again if TBC is re-released. This is just my subjective experience, of course, and I know there are others who feel the opposite. That's great for you,   but it will definitely ruin it for a lot of us.
---
[But I want it now!](https://youtu.be/Wzr12gBrXA8)
---
If you dont want to raid, there will be epic level dungeon sets to fill the gap. They are upgraded via quest off the blue dungeon sets. They'll be competitive until Naxx gear hits the streets. 
---
After Naxx theres no gear that really compares so if you want to effectively "hit lvl 65" youll have to raid eventually or try and hit rank 13/14 for pvp gear (which is almost impossible). 
---
Id say it wont be an issue in BGs until naxx is out for maybe 6 months. Then if youre still in dungeon gear its gonna feel like youre playing in the wrong lvl bracket. Even tier 1 raid gear will feel very underpowered.
---
Yeah, because it's literally impossible for a shaman to do 600 DPS in a 45 second fight.

Raiding:
---
I am raiding with a great guild called legion of lo pan on westfall server. I have five of my tier one set and my t2 helm. Even though we are a smaller guild i do feel good that not only am i used for damage but curses and banishes are used a lot in MC which makes me feel useful. 
---
I dont do too much gold farming but i have guildies that do what you stated in your post and get loads of gold as warlock. Mage i never did gold farming. 15 years ago all i did was pvp. 
---
Pvp
---
Mage. Frost nova and blink are so amazing. Killing warriors might be one of the best feelings in wow. You are super squishy if you get caught. 
---
Warlock. I miss blink and nova a lot. Warriors kick my ass now. Death coil and fear however are amazing. Im still improving in pvp so lots to learn. I DECIMATE MAGES. Im a clothy but honestly feel tanky. Warlock builds have lots of stamina.  
---
Last note and we can definitely talk more. Ill never get the huge crits i got with mage, but dotting up an enemy gives me a power trip. Especially a rogue because they cant vanish anymore. Also i feel like i have way less competition for tiered armor sets than mages. Overall youll have fun with both, but for me and my personality, im enjoying warlock a ton.
---
Why do you need catch up gear when we only have MC/Ony?
---
That doesn't look like any shaman I've ever seen.
---
I would give out coupons for services of people referred me customers.  Are these retroactively invalid now as they cant trade them and I cant check validity.

If your guild just /roll's for gear then yeah, pug Ony for sure and get your Corehound Tooth from guild MC runs.

If you are combat rogue and get perditions blade, you spec daggers.

if you're an arms warrior with dal'rends and you get deathbringer, you spec axes.
---
That's my only argument. I'm not saying let your decked out combat rogue with viskag roll on gutgore to win over a dagger rogue who's been unlucky with drops. I'm saying that it's silly to ban people from rolling on an item because they aren't talented for it currently.
---
Welcome to America, bitch
---
see below comment.
---
Hearing about Horde dominating PvP and World Bosses on all the Servers... Meanwhile being horde on Zandalar tribe :'DDD
---
Its not worth the time to do this.
---
Adding 20 to your roll is quite a bit better than /roll 20-100.
---
Burn out was my first thought as well.  I usually get what I call “class envy” once I’ve gotten a char to max level and gotten pre-bis.  My character stops being fun and I start thinking that other class must be more fun.  Usually I’ll make it out of the newbie area on a new class before I realize that I just don’t want to level another character.  Then I’ll realize I’ve reached burnout and then I’m done with the game for a while.
---
I have found that the bid price is basically marketing bs and search result placing.
---
The vast majority of people just use the buyout, so as long as the bid is greater than any intrinsic value the item has, you basically can put whatever you want as the bid.
---
The layers were temporary for the massive influx at launch.  They're gone now so that point is moot.
---
Increased realm pop is a legit difference that has quite an effect.
---
Well explain, because I'm a fairly new player and had trouble getting a druid to the king to loot something
---
What's bracket stacking?
---
Especially since T2 helm drops off Onyxia, T2 legs drops off MC, healing power/spell power enchants drop off MC, 18 slot bag(s) from Onyxia, Thunderfury bindings and eye of sulfuras chances from MC, and simply put something to do when you aren't doing BWL if none of the above apply.
---
Raid progression exists in classic not like in retail where it's an absolute catchup to the latest released raid.
---
I feel this way about several videos.  "Solo farm this boss."  On except 3 out of 5 times, he will actually walk over to a group of mobs and aggro them... 90g per hour pickpocketing, oh except if you get resisted twice before your CD is up....
---
Nah he can just join premades and win every time
---
It's weird since there's that video of the guy changing loot type with a script.
---
And that's pretty much the difference. As an Orc there's no reason for me to get QS, it's a good weapon but not good enough to have to itemize around Edgemasters. 
---
Undead, Tauren, and Trolls can use daggers from MC with Mugger's Belt or ACLG and produce better threat with more stats as well.
---
I’m talking about the same thing. Mage is waaaay faster. Normal players can easily 2 pull Cath if they know the LoS point. Pros can basically one pull 95% of Cath. This is waaaay faster than Paladins. Mage do this so fast the alternate between Cath and Arm before resetting.

I've spent my fair share of hours in DM:E as a mage and sure getting to the point where you can do the demons more than 50% of the time was a learning curve I'd hardly call it stressful. I've been teaching my guildies how to do it as well and it's been going well. Just accept you are going to die a lot and relax. Hell dying is the fastest way to solo reset DM:E, with one account at least.

Now I just do DM:E laps to unwind after work. Still 60ish gold an hour on average and assuming market prices.

No not the .lua files it was doing that in the game when I went to set an event. I'll try again today. It sounds like it should be simple. Maybe I had a messed up version or something

By that logic, just do a ban wave every two years to "cast a bigger net". Why stop there? Just don't perform a a ban wave at all if it means more data can be collected on the bots? Oh wait, because its bad that they exist in the first place.

I want to raid mostly, my end goal is to be a raid healer if I play priest. Though I am very interested in climbing the pvp ranks at some point as well.
---
My brain hurt looking at that date
---
I mean I guess? Idk just seems incredibly irrelevant and OT to me

I want my life back I watched full vid waiting for something interesting to happen

I regularly watch him, I already saw this and I probably keep track of how shitty activision is, to the point when I sometimes feel really shitty for giving them money to play classic.
---
That said no man is perfect and Richard is a great journalist, it's in the personality department where people see issues. Since we live in the age of the cult of personality, people have issues with him. My guess is that the downvotes stem from that, but it's only my guess.
---
I feel like this is exactly what I'm looking for. Im a usual min/maxer, I only rolled on this Mace for the Lulz so sounds like I'm in for plenty
---
Gz guys! 
---
We did that too 3 weeks ago! Feelsgoodman!
---
 Lost Crew-Golemagg
---
Nope that’s it. 1 str = 2 ap. It also increases the amount that is blocked by shields. 
---
11 str = 22 ap 
---
11 str &gt; 22 ap
---
&gt; and also don't give you rep if they're grey level
---
This is incorrect. You lose 20% of the reputation reward for each level past the quest turning grey, down to a minimum of 20% of the normal reputation reward. 
---
If a quest turns grey at level 50, you'd get 80% rep at level 51, 60% at 52, 40% at 53, 20% at 54-60.
---
Lmao that’s the way she goes
---
According to this place, so many people have rerolled or are willing to reroll Alliance, population imbalance is totally fixed.
---
Except its all bullshit.
---
Orc is drastically better. It's not just hardiness but it's blood fury. 
---
Healers can dispel you, but orc instantly makes some classes be weary about relying on stuns.
---
I think Strength also affects block rating but in regards to DPS yeah 1 STR = 2 AP.  use the 11 STR item.
---
I never really got the fuss. A lv. 58 is going to be level 60 in another ~week.

Gnomes should have been the one race that couldn’t roll warrior. I mean come on.

I mean, all a DC landing does is buy a few seconds before he intercepts and cuts you down.
---
SL locks are spoiled by having a lot of favorable matchups and severely overestimate how well they do in the bad ones, I find. By now I've dueled 1-2 dozen SLs who talked big game and then lost every fight.
---
I did frost spec with 2 points into that arcane talent that reduces resistance. 
---
I liked this video the best because he goes through his gear/spec and gives some good tips. 
---
My #1 tip I would use would be to backpedal before EVERY cone of cold. Make sure your tapping "s" or whatever and lining everyone up before casting CoC. Besides that there is just a lot of nuance with lining people up / getting npcs who resist back in line / stuff like that. 
---
Also my other tip would be to go to AH and buy stacks of Superior Health Pots. They got for like 60s a stack and you can buy like 6-8 stacks before you go to ZF. It's nice to have them when you're learning or if you get lots of resists.
---
True. My bad, sorry!
---
If international is so great then how come they're not a superpower?  Has international ever landed on the moon?  Has international ever killed Osama?  I think mot. Q.e.d.
---
Most servers are already horrendously one sided. If you think 60/40 is balanced, you suck at math more than I do.
---
Its over. Let people go.
---
If guilds got killed because a few of their top players got poached by larger, more successful guilds, then that guild wasn't capable of doing Naxx anyway.  If your entire guild is built around a small number of people and everyone else is just getting carried, you already had no chance.
---
You really only parse high because the guild your in (you guys kill boss super fast, so DPS is high). In all reality judging from the numbers, your one of the worst rogues in your raid team. So I’d take what you do with a grain of salt.
---
Wow, sick burn.
---
Best option
---
Int shout the lip for a good laugh. His lip wont let deep wounds break it.
---
That's not technically the truth
---
It's not exactly the same.
---
/roll rolls between 1-100, not between 0-100.
---
So there are 100 possible outcomes of /roll
---
but if you do /roll 20 120, that gives 101 possible outcomes because when you do that command, it rolls a number between those two numbers INCLUSIVE.
---
The range of possible outcomes of (/roll) + 20 is 21-120
---
The range of possible outcomes of /roll 20 120 is 20-120
---
So /roll 20 120 is at a tiny disadvantage compared to (/roll)+20.
---
If you are on Alliance you want to go for STR over AP because of Blessing of Kings.
---
Imagine having your economy/military dwarfed by mentally challenged people. Tell me, if America, who is, in your words "mentally challenged" is the clear world super power then what does that make you?
---
Truly from rags to riches.
---
Ran a pug with a fresh level 60 in full greens last night. He won two pieces of T1 and T2 legs off of rag.
---
I rolled numbers against him 5, 15, and a 10. He rolled 82, 75, and a 95.
---
Full greens except what we won last night. I died inside.
---
Intimidating Shout that doesn't break on bleed? Yes please!
---
There's been no word from Blizzard on it, but BGs were apparently introduced with ZG and AB in 1.7, so it's likely they'll be added with Arathi Basin, whether that's phase 4 as planned or an early 3.5.
---
Lol @ these idiots criticising an American playing an American game using American dates.
---
Hi, you must be new to reddit.
---
Also works if you have a few shaman/warriors with Ravager.
---
Hey I know this guy too.  Bet you can't guess who I am.
---
How did this happen? I know people transfered but why? I started there as horde and even barrens i was seeing ally. I then rerolled cuz of friends but stil..
---
Thought you looked sick then realized you’re a gnome smh
---
Sounds like an unnecessary extreme solution to a minor issue
---
That musictrack is just perfect!
---
That’s a fair guess. I also have to assume at this point that this subreddit is shilled and astroturfed. I am unsubscribing now sadly. And I agree, I actually feel gross giving them money for wow classic now. Like they’re literally so scummy to the wow community it’s unbelievable. Unless Richard Lewis is twisting the facts, which I doubt he is because the GM of Method is saying the same things. Maybe some of this community will wake up and see that the old Blizzard is dead and that we need to speak with our wallets if we want them to improve.
---
Groups weren't forced back in vanilla, you would join the bg but unless someone formed a raid you were not in a group
---
Whatever the two players agreed on! Most likely just an amount of gold, but you can do items or whatever.
---
The in-game sound sliders are a mess, something I honestly never expected from a blizz title. Luckily I just have the sound set to my headphones at all times and my tv shows, music, etc to either the speakers or one of the monitors depending on my mood and time of day.
---
Don't know of an add-on, but there's always a spreadsheet.
---
Imagine how much money blizzard made with people transferring off flamelash who missed the free transfer train. Genius.
---
fair. disregard all warrior comments in that case...was trying to bring variety for more than just rogues into the case i was making.
---
either way, i stand by it being silly to outlaw people from rolling on items if it's a legitimate upgrade just because it's not their current spec
---
I did the nolife dungeon spam with a leveling group from 28-60 so I was holy from about 30+
---
However I have leveled to 60 as shadow and there is very minimal downtime. It's a pretty quick class to solo level.
---
There is a cvar to adjust cursor size.
---
/script SetCVar("cursorSizePreferred", "2")
---
The values are as follows:
---
Size of cursor: -1=determine based on system/monitor dpi, 0=32x32, 1=48x48, 2=64x64
---
This pleases me
---
Honestly, the only good plate shoulders are the R10 shoulders. Gives a 2% crit chance along with stats.
---
The sap thing is even worse than you state.  Even if you talent into it, there's a 10% chance to break stealth anyway
---
It should be very simple. You check the box next to 'mounted' and then you pick the set to associate with that event. That should be it.
---
I think I don't agree with your analysis technique here by grouping it by wins and losses. You should try and win, but most important is to keep games short; what is being advocated is to have fast games not losing games. Some fast games are wins and some long games are losses. 
---
For instance just really quickly analyzing this, fast game (less than 10 mins) have 156 average honor per minute while slow games (&gt;30 minutes) have 81 honor per minute. If you include a 7 minute queue time fast games are 85 honor per minute while slow games are 71 honor per minute. Intermediate games (between 10 and 30 minutes) are marginally better (94 honor per minute) but but my problem with that is that going for those types of games seems to all-to-often result in really long games which are bad (even by your data). However, the statistics are low and flawed since they don't include kill honor which obviously matters (until everyone hits DR anyways). 
---
I will also say that I think you got a little lucky with game times, you didn't get involved in some of the crazier hour+ turtles that seem really common right now.
---
What did he do to get you banned back in the day?
---
First number: 1 to 12
---
Second number: 1 to 31
---
Third number: x to 2019
---
This is how we justify it.
---
i was so confused at first, thought it was 3 days on the 18th month
---
From what developers have said about the server architecture we can glean that they use a transnational RDBMS. They probably have a lot of special sauce on top to help with scaling but fundamentally they need something transnational to ensure everything stays consistent (no duping bugs).
---
That is going to form a bottleneck when you have a lot of players in one place.
---
You can't arbitrarily shared without giving up something because of CAP theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem).
---
So it's a reasonable theory that this kind of lag is the delay in trying to push a huge number of transactions though a single RDBMS that is trying to keep all the players in one space consistent. 
---
Or it's an availability compromise in some sort of distributed DB because eventually consistent is not a desirable property for an MMO.
---
You are operating under the assumption that people don't enjoy just hanging out as a group of friends in WoW. I'd rather do pretty much anything as a group with my friends than solo farm something alone no matter how efficient. The whole point of the game is to have fun. So, if your goal is to have fun, group content can actually be the most "efficient" route to fun.
---
That is most likely the issue.
---
According to the specs: https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49--chg90-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49hg90dmnxza/

The panel type is VA. Ghosting is a common issue with VA panels.

Hi, /u/spirates

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ecy77v/tired_of_long_bg_queues_heres_an_easy_fix_for/). 
---
So, Horde the best strategy is to win a fast game, or a "longer" game (under 45 minutes) where as Alliance its about rushing down games  due to no queue time -- long games do not benefit alliance win or loss.
---
Seems like a nice dynamic where there are nearly asymmetrical win conditions here. Alliance benefit most from FAST games (i.e. no defense) where as Horde benefit most from just winning the game under a certain time threshold.
---
Yep!!! thank you
---
I actually hadn't even considered it proccing when defending in AV. Damn I'm gonna have some fun this week I can already tell
---
The offhand for any build will not be close to as important as the mainhand. Save for viskag
---
7 minutes queues?????  We're up to 13min on Herod.  It really sucks.
---
Do not 5 sunder a lock, 1-2 tops and then only if hes stacking more stam than usual.
---
If you have deathwish, pop it.
---
Early reflectors can force a lock to start the fight at half hp (5s of free damage) or if he's predictable (most are), time it to bounce a coil.
---
If the pet isn't sacced yet, swap and int shout for 8s of free damage on the lock.
---
If he tries to cast in melee, just lock him down with the old pummel / int / shout rotation.
---
Once he dies, defstance + eat at charge range and camp till release.
---
DPS weapon in tank gear.  Hmmmmm
---
In vanilla people were setting up “casinos” where we hey would actually profit in the long run.  Blizzard cracked down on that.  Not t sure they ever cared about people essentially just flipping a coin for gold.
---
My guild is racist against Tauren warriors, orc best tank they say
---
I have the force reactive disk.
---
It's an awesome shield, but it's really only useful on some pulls in 5 mans. There's no raid content where it's very useful right now, Drillborer disk will do more single target threat with shield slams and offers more mitigation.
---
Force reactive disk won't last through a full run of most dungeons. The best dungeon for it is Strat with all the big undead pulls, but if you equip it and don't swap back and forth between a different shield, the disk won't even survive to the scarlet side of strat live most of the time. 
---
The shield is major QOL for tanks for the beginning of a big AOE pull in a group that has strong AOE dps, and not really much else. The lionheart helm will be useful in raids on any fight where your threat is more important than your mitigation (so pretty much all content in the game once it's on farm).
---
So to fully answer your question, assuming you could only get one of them, it's going to come down to what you spend more time doing. If you chain a lot of 5 mans for gold or whatever reason, the Force Reactive Disk will probably be your best buy. If you're mostly only doing raids, you'll probably get more use out of Lionheart.

Speaking as one that has steered away from giving AAA money for more years than I care to count, it won't matter mate. Most people don't care and with gaming I understand that to some extent, people just want to have fun and not police the ones paying for and steering their enjoyment.
---
C'est la vie.
---
And for your own health, stop being so categoric and defensive.
---
The only people who care engineers, unfortunately. Everyone else thinks American units are correct and/or somehow easier to use than metric. 
---
This would't be a problem if it wasn't for Ronald Reagan.
---
If have a rogue spreadsheet.
---
Thanks for your reply.
---
It just throws the calculations a bit off.  Horde would choose 22 AP over 10 Strength, but for alliance they are equivalent.  Not sure how often equivalent pieces show up though where you realistically have to make that choice.
---
It’s a VA monitor. Ghosting is inevitable as it’s an unfortunate limitation of the technology.
---
I just wanna know where you've managed to find a single mob who yields 50s on a pickpocket.
---
I've spent more time than i care to addup pickpocketing in BRD. Paid for my undead epic mount and reputation for it, as an Orc, by doing so.
---
50s doesn't exist on a pickpocket. I don't think I've seen higher than 5s.
---
Not sure, maybe they just realized it's dumb fun and not real gambling. I could see people using this as a way to cover up buying gold tho. As a deathroller myself, I made 2k gold over an hour once. Granted I lost most of it by not knowing when to stop and thinking 1k rolls were worth the risk, since all my gold was 'free gold'. Also, probably less people reporting it now since it's an older playerbase and not really seen as taking advantage of children. Possibly , just my two cents
---
seeing one in stealth, sapping them cheap shot RESIST :)
---
It's the addon that's choking the shit out of the server making a cascade of data requests in crowded areas as people mouse across a crowd.
---
(I don't know if that's true, but it sounded good.  I recall an addon like that really DID have that effect in TSW, but that was hitting an external IIRC RP info site too...) :)
---
Why is alliance better at PvE and PvP? I wait 18 mins in queues for wsg to face unkillable paladins healers that just win everytime. We never have healer classes as horde and  when they do they are shadow priests and elemental shamans. How do you win as horde? Lol.
---
Orc Blood Fury Racial IIRC also does not scale +AP from gear, but does scale +strength, making strength more beneficial here as well.
---
MTG Commander should not be a financial burden. Don't buy pre-cons unless you really need that commander. The format is so stable that you can also buy single commanders much cheaper than buying a whole new deck.
---
Play in a meta horde guild. All the warriors will be Orcs who only wants axes due to weapon skill, leaving swords uncontested for rogues.
---
I actually didnt know that, I just had heard rumors of the bans so I stopped
---
Instead of the only accepted date format in the rest of the world. Such special little stars you are.
---
More people to group with, more guilds, more PuG raids... There's definitely benefits you're overlooking
---
I’ve seen to drop twice in 30 runs but lost the rolls. So keep trying you’ll end up getting it. Atleast that is what I tell myself lol.
---
I leveled a warlock to 16 and got very bored with it, so I rerolled into a shadow priest. Having a lot more fun and plus I have the option to heal or dps dungeons otw to 60.
---
Ty for this
---
dude FUCK ORCS!
---
You've given us literally no information to work with. What do you like? What are your goals?
---
I like how people are still talking about what gives the most honor per hour when in fact most players are only in AV for the reputation - whether they know it or not.
---
There's more streamers with "R14" in their stream titles than there will be Rank 14 players by the end of Phase 5. For most of you, the honor you gain now is irrelevant, as you'll burn out in mid January anyways.
---
Yeah, true. Racials don't matter because gnomes are a god tier race anyway.
---
You can say that about so, so many things
---
I do love America, more so than most of Reddit but your dates are fucked up bro.
---
Had a guy receive leader in a game then immediately change it to master looter which derailed the entire AV. People were standing around on their mounts clearly because they were typing. Eventually he finally makes a comment "If you don't like the way I'm running this AV then you can leave" which I'm sure you can imagine how people responded to that.
---
America officially uses the metric system. Like all humans (not just Americans) cultural changes take time.

Also all our cars already have mph listed on them. We'll switch to kph once you pony up the cash to change all the speed limit signs.

Wow posts about flamelash are being some nice karma harvesting. Realm is dead it's not like there arent 109345023947509283457-90234 posts already on that matter.
---
I played on elysium on horde side and yeah the back door strategy worked ... but just if like all ppl went for it and like 5-8 ppl defended there is no way horde can win vs alliance in a pure rush game
---
OEB is all we ever see, finally got our first mageblade this week tho, fingers crossed for more
---
Kromcrush
---
Jaugust
---
its so funny how all these people come up to me and beg me to stop getting honor... "wahhh ur messing up the brackets!" tough shit LOL! im just that good at pvp, its all natural baby!
---
some guys got it.... others don't! way she goes fellas
---
Be sure your using a display port cable and not the HDMI as well.   HDMI does not allow you to saturate that monitor and it will attempt to compensate for it, this will cause additional ghosting in some clients.
---
I like how this logic applies to all games of that type. Gee, don't spend money and you're not spending money! Woah!
---
From rags...to can opener
---
Whatever the fuck categoric and defensive means. All I know is that I get mad when people ignore the truth and ya it’s maybe out of my control, but I refuse to go quietly. I am trying to inform and support the community right now and getting downvoted for it. Is that not an exasperating experience? 
---
SUCK MY DICK BLIZZARD BAN ME FROM THIS SUBREDDIT
---
This. Invest some time, be prepared.
---
Pretty much never.
---
So you admit Alliance have good racials, finally.
---
Obligatory downvote because gross Gnome.
---
I would downvote twice if I could because Gnome warriors should not be a thing.
---
OT, but not irrelevant, wow uses yards.
---
heres another tip.  you dont need the ony buff to face roll MC
---
It’s pretty much a given that when it comes to the choice between AP and Strength/Agility that the stats are almost always a better choice over raw AP. The main reason is because of buffs that increase your stats by a percentage scale but AP doesn’t.
---
Warlock lvling mad easy, summons make dungeons start sooner. SS creates less rage when u wipe, very strong damage. With that said. I am very biased, because i main locks
---
Thanks! Butt drugs ftw
---
1) dogs see through stealth so rogues and druids need to avoid them
---
2) some things will still attack even after king buff. You have to know what is dangerous and tell the buyer what to avoid.
---
3) buyer needs to kill any eyes they see so they don't spawn demons
---
4) sometimes you need to provide an invisibility pot to the buyer so they can get past certain spots
---
5) if you really want to see it done right, watch Cdewx on twitch. He doesn't always do them but he's gotten very proficient at it, and sells items to non-stealthies frequently
---
Lmao
---
Going from a warrior who had to farm overly contested world content for gold to a mage that I can mindlessly farm ZF, it does make a huge difference. Sure some hours I only get 25-35g. Sure sometimes I still wipe, but I have ZF zombies down to 10-12 minutes a run and there’s nothing I can do on my warrior that is nearly as good or consistent from a solo perspective. Everything I would be farming in the open world is way too over farmed and being able to never have competition because it’s an instance has made me thousands of gold over the past month or two.
---
Depending on your swords or hemo build, try and get a felstriker for your OH.  If you are seal fate hemo it’s a  contender for BiS till nax.  Otherwise anything high DPS in raids will work.  CHT or Brute are good.  As long as you get a big nasty MH, the OH is just the icing on the cake.
---
Not sure how thats the case when the past 3 or 4 weeks ive been pvp spec.
---
Congrats to the other  rogues in my raid whove gotten gear and are actively giving more of a shit than I do since getting solid parses.
---
Up until recently when I stopped respeccing weekly 
---
I am/was most consistent and highest performer.
---
Swords should perform higher.
---
And yet, here I am, outperforming sword rogues when im buffed, consumed, and raid specced.
---
There definitely is a balance between the full turtle / stalled game and a rush straight to the end.      
---
I like the semi turtle approach where you don't cap SH GY but keep a strong defense so every time you kill a member on the alliance offense it just causes them to run back, rather than force them to fight through the horde front lines just to make it back to offense, which causes the inevitable turtle and game delay.
---
You can buy at whatever price you like but it's just the proper way to put items in ah. Pretty much every person use add-on that does it automatically. Also every seller from the list (if he knows how ah works) glad that you undercut him by lowest amount possible, means that his item will go at good price if buyer needs more than 1item. If you think it's "lazy undercutting"  you doing it wrong.
---
Is there a way to prevent the knockback from Onyxia?
---
I feel like I am always the only one getting pushed back.
---
Maybe I am missing a mechanic?
---
Assuming your guild is close-ish / friendly I'd recommend taking 15 minutes and having a class meet up over discord. There you can discuss who needs what loot over the next X weeks and who plans to bid on what. 
---
It allows everyone to understand everyone else's motivations and gear needs and will also abosultely save you from overspending DKP if everyone can come to a concensus.
---
Skeram and thank you
---
It's the same queue time for all horde
---
Not sure I agree there.  Orc stun resist is the best racial for PVP in the game. 
---
AV meta shifted, ally won most games the first several days, then horde started winning. 
---
YMMV I guess.  I've had plenty of druid and priest healers in our groups.
---
I have a lock. If you want to pve and pvp, prepare to spend a few hundred gold per week on respeccing if you want to be optimal. And by optimal, I mean far below every rog/mage/warrior on the dps meters. I honestly wish I rolled a mage, they're better in most every way other than the competition for raid spots/gear is higher. Not to mention the soul shard thing is just tedious, I thought it was kinda cool initially but now I'm just turned off. From what I've read about locks they scale pretty hard but i doubt you'll ever beat a mage/rog/warrior on the meters.
---
I just rerolled to a healing class (hpal) as that what I've played in retail since wotlk and I'm having more fun. It was a coin flip between hpal and priest though. I'm still unsure. 
---
Tldr: if you're gonna roll a caster, pick the god of casters, roll a mage. If you want to stick with what you are at heart, pally/priest are both solid imo.

Meanwhile, our warrior got Eye of Sulfuras a month and a half ago and still hasn't put in any of the work to get the mats.  I get that it's a guild effort, but the recipient should really be putting in the majority of the work, if not *some* of the work.
---
The other night I stood in for another guild.  It was SOOO refreshing to run with a competent group again.  No wipes, no downtime between pulls. We get to the end of the raid and Eye of Sulfuras drops.  Dude crafted it 5 minutes later and we were off to Onyxia.
---
No wpvp is a major issue though.
---
Maybe my orc is bugged but y’all make it seem like Orcs resist every stun.
---
The wrong way.
---
I have a Samsung C34J791 ultrawide that I use with my MacBook Pro 2016. Works a treat so far with dungeons and levelling on lowest setting at 60 FPS. 
---
As I say I don’t think a 40 man raid it will fair so well at such a high resolution - I’ll scale down or use the MacBook screen when required.
---
Not keen on the egpu as the cost of it in addition to a new gfx card would mean I could invest in a semi decent desktop pc instead.
---
Each to their own though - I play casually and wow classic is the perfect game to kill some hours in my limited free time!
---
That’s a little unnecessary... You don’t see Americans slinging petty insults over units of measure. We simply convert and move on, no need for that shit.
---
That's what I always thought.
---
I was just making up numbers
---
15 min queues are great when you have astral recall, just bounce back and forth between AV and a good farming spot.
---
Calls Americans stupid.
---
Can't use proper punctuation. 
---
Cheers.
---
I can't remember the last time I fought Gorosh let alone ever seeing the chest
---
its arranged from small to big. Day &lt; Month &lt; year. whats not to understand?
---
Shout out for Kirtonos Horde! Some of the nicest people I've ever met.
---
I imagine they’ll have three separate Classic environments, which include TBC and Wrath. You’ll be able to choose which one you want to play from the launcher. They may also offer one free max level character copy/transfer to the new “expansion” so people don’t have to completely reroll.
---
That makes the most sense, and let’s people play the Classic version they want to play.
---
I mean logs track gear worn, so. Unless it’s someone’a very first raid (in which case you should inspect them anyways) or your guild’s very first raid, you should really already know what everyone has from last weeks raid.
---
But that's my point, the way you're speaking is making you look like a [twat (rude and unpleasant)](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/twat). You're only helping Activision with this approach.
---
And this is my last reply as you're already making me doubt your words.
---
Either way, best of luck in your endeavors!
---
Hey so just so I am doing this correctly without messing anything up:
---
First rename the WowClassic.exe to WoW.exe.
---
Then point the link file to the Classic folder and name it WoWClassic.exe
---
Then set the destination link to the re-named WoW.exe
---
Does that sound right? So when you point the link file to the Classic folder you basically create a name for it called WoWClassic.exe, even though the real name of the Executable now is WoW.exe?
---
I use yolomouse in PoE. Wonder if it would work here? Allows you to change color size and style of cursor.
---
Fuck off dude
---
But then you have to play a gnome, so it’s not worth it
---
Sounds like you might need to learn deductive reasoning. When you already know there are 12 months, you should then assume 18 is not the month. Stupid Europeans.
---
Nope. The only way I could see this is if every other warrior and sword rogue has it or better. And let's be real, even if you restrict it to people with 70% or more attendance rate, there's nowhere near enough weapon drops for everyone to have a weapon. Realistically, while there might be enough core hound tooths for the hunters to get one eventually, there'll never be enough brutality blades until AQ.
---
Need for weapons people actually use &gt; need for stat sticks. Sorry. Maybe in 6 months and you're deciding between giving it to a trial warr/rogue or giving it to a hunter.
---
They can look at it as closely as they like - the times there are gaps in the data will be filled by #marks turned in. I logged it as I was playing, the consistency of this would be too much work to fake :P  
---
They yield more honor, and it appears more rep. Long losses are the worst for reputation, no question. Long wins way outpace fast losses. This is what I try to capture in "reputation per minute," to standardize over length of game.    
---
Most people backcapping on Horde were trying to win. I definitely encountered a few troll/unwise caps of SH GY. When people got mad about, say, recapping the Aid Station "just let it end," people came to defend they were trying to win. And sometimes we did.   
---
There are HUGE complaints about AFK reporting / trolling / abuse on reddit and the Blizzard forums. I have not encountered it a single time. I did fish part of one game but that anger was justified. The complaints I have seen have mostly been about servers that are not included on my battlegroup.
---
Me too. feels really odd to read
---
FUCKING THANK YOU please everyone repost this in Orgrimmar
---
Ehh, if you mean optimal as in DS/Ruin as the main PvE spec, it isn't much difference (2-5%) versus SM/Ruin which is plenty viable in PvP, a lot will say SM/Ruin is the a good spec to just stick with for PvE/PvP. 
---
Can't speak for SL, never spec'd it, but seems great for duels, and trying to outlast the opponent with the damage share and sacrifice.  Destro (I did NF/Conflag) was fun for AV/WSG, but don't think I quite had the crit/fire dmg gear to make it worth it.
---
Overall I see warlocks as more of a support class with Banish, Curses (elements/shadow/reck which increases mage, lock, spriest, and melee damage), SS, HS, imp stam buff, and still being able to DPS decently.  The lack of threat reduction is what makes topping charts tough since we'd pull aggro and also talent based hit% increase like mages have.  But all that support makes having a few locks worth it in a raid.
---
i took time out on friday/saturday to get banthok and mysteria. i had already run arena 25 times and live 10 times before i decided to go back. i got pvp upgrades for those spots easily and immediately (warlock), strat UD neck and felheart belt. i'm up for mageblade next but one of my fellow locks wasn't happy about it, talking shit that i just got my hit upgrades. oh well, i finally decided to use pots in the raid and shit on him while he's been using all the pots for weeks. like yeah dude i've been pvp'ing for the last month, it's not like this shit is hard
---
just wanted to get that off my chest lol
---
In the character selection screen i get 1000+FPS and my GPU temps get up to 85’C before i log into my character. Is there anyway to FPS cap the login screen to avoid the high temps?
---
Ah, as in the gold can come in bursts since a lot of clams will.be worthless, so the income is highly varying, gotchya!
---
Even R10 is going to be unbelievably difficult to get the way the honor system works and the enormity of the game population.
---
pVp HaPpEnEd Od A pVp SeRvEr
---
Yeah, thats true. Look at all the pvp happening on this server. There's so much of it!

Bis belt for elemental shaman is all I know from windreaver. Is BoE too so worth some $$$
---
Thanks! Felstriker is &lt;0,20% dropchance though 😕
---
I have hit 60, working on BiS, epic mount and so on, but As a priest I cannot so many solo dungeon runs. 
---
Can anyone recommend the best classes for solo farms to earn gold, please?
---
&gt;  the optimal strategy to maximize honor and reputation earned for Horde in Alterac Valley is to win the match
---
that's nice except there is NO GUARANTEE OF WINNING THE MATCH no matter how hard you try and how long it takes. There is a 100% guarantee that the match will be short and a loss if you don't try to win. It's also more a lot more relaxing for those that don't feel like typing an essay in raid chat and checking the map 70 times on their 80th AV match.
---
125 vs 131 honor per minute is essentially the same. those who just want to lose are doing it right.
---
Prolly saved around 3k in booze and travel.
---
And might I add, looking at your post history, you seem incresibly ignorant on just about everything.
---
Good luck with your PFD
---
Also, you are more than welcome to link your own logs, fucktard.
---
Can you parse above 70?
---
That’s why they make +40 Resilience flasks. If you’re in raid gear just drink one of those and it’s like wearing a couple PvP set pieces.
---
I didn’t mind resilience personally, even though it did clutter up the bank with gear.
---
And you get those gear upgrades from raids to not only look badass, but it showed your progression in the game. On PvE people appreciate your tier pieces way more than PvP pieces anyway.
---
You were enough to make her stop.
---
It's PvP BiS for heal priests
---
[deleted]
---
I agree with you. I hope they give us the option to “copy” our characters over to TBC realms, while still being able to log back into vanilla
---
weird
---
But there are already multiple r10 players on many servers.
---
Meanwhile I've been playing since release day and still not max level lol.
---
how
---
The same reason we dont say one thousand eleven and two hundred (1211). Or that will be twenty four cents one hundred and three twenty dollars please (123.24$).
---
Blaming the FC is pretty lame considering they are often the only ones caring about objectives. Not saying there's nothing I can improve on, but when the majority of games  my teammates chasing kills rather than helping  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's partly the lack of healers as well as I've noticed the healers to be a deciding factor in most games.
---
&gt;in WSG Warrior crit rate is double what it should be
---
uhhh, hyperbole, anecdotal confirmation bias, or gamebreaking bug?
---
js, this is an extremely easy to test hypothesis, and would have gamebreaking implications
---
i doubt there is any bug related to warrior crit rate in WSG lol
---
that what the addon does. When you mount it equips those items, when you dismount it swaps back to the item you had before. IE when I mount my cheap boots with spurs are put on, as soon as i dismount it swaps back to my purple boots. You can build a macro if you want but your just making it harder on yourself.
---
it just seems like most of the posts on here are from alliance perspective.
---
I’ve run it many times and every time all orbs are greed then pass. I feel bad if your server most runs are orbs reserved.
---
Crazy how fast you can get what is literally the biggest grind in current Classic, the Sulfuras.
---
I started working on my materials two weeks ago and I should have it finished by the third full week from getting the Eye of Sulfuras. 
---
Everyone talked about how arduous and hard the grind was to get it done. It's not. Not even close. At 30g/hour it would take 100 hours. That's about the length of a full first playthrough of a game like Dark Souls 3 or Final Fantasy XII. Yes, it's a lot more boring because you're staying in the same spot the entire time, but it's not that bad.
---
I came into the grind expecting it to take 3-6 months, like a FFXI relic weapon (my first relic took about 9 months, the second one took about 6). Compared to an FFXI relic, getting a Sulfuras is laughably easy.
---
GPU switching is not working as intended for your client.  Manually force the dGPU to display the game instead of the iGPU.
---
Not entirely true.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country
---
Tldr unless a country uses iso you aren't using the globally accepted date. I'm guessing you're European which means you are also special little stars as you use DMY which isn't the only acceptable date format.
---
Saying "i7 9th gen" is kind of like saying you drive a 2018 Ford.
---
It could be a ford focus SE with 123 horsepower (i7-9850HL) or a 2018 ford shelby gt350 with 526 horsepower (i7-9750H).
---
What specific model of cpu is it?
---
If you're a tank, you can't avoid the knockback, you just have to position her so your back is directly to the north wall so you don't get knocked back.
---
If you're a dps or healer, just look where everyone else in your raid is standing and stay with them to avoid the knockback. The transition from phase 2 to 3 can often be rough and sometimes you can get knocked back then through no fault of your own, but aside from that you should never be getting knocked back as a non-tank.
---
You can solo sublime on your own, very easy once you get the hang of it.  Takes 4min a run.
---
Yeah, but what do you do with the other 14 mins? Clean up?
---
For honor it is effectively the same. For reputation it is nearly twice as beneficial to win.  There is no guarantee of winning, of course, but by putting forward effort you bias the outcome towards the more beneficial (win).
---
So, as someone who doesn't pug often, I just want to give you a heads-up that it's 100% not clear to everyone what WTAGFGSAFD-3+2&gt;infinity is supposed to mean, and it took me being quite insistent to get the raid-leader to state in plain language what was meant by it on the one occasion I pugged for the week. Just to save yourself some headaches, write up what the loot rules are in an actual post in English, and post that before the raid starts. "LFM MC (list of classes needed) MS&gt;OS+2, bindings res" is fine for your recruitment posts, but make sure you've explained the loot rules for real at least once.
---
I can relate to this and would add don’t be afraid to leave guilds that have content on farm for a lesser progressed guild my current guild atmosphere is 1000 times more fun and fair than my 1st month prebis guild I was in. I almost quit the game because I was just raid logging now I’m playing everyday and in discord with our core group of 10 or so guys.
---
I played a mage in Vanilla followed by warrior tank. I started a warrior tank again but also now have a warlock alt. I miss the ability to port for sure but overall I love the gameplay of the lock. If you take engineering, which you really should if you roll on a pvp server, then having the telporter to the other island makes life a lot better. Otherwise most mages are happy to port you from main cities if needed. 
---
Have you played WOW before? If not then mages can be easier without pet and shard management. If you have played before then I think the added intricacy around warlocks make them more fun. Also killing elites 2 levels higher is kinda awesome
---
Shadow bracers in strat live, is also a good option! Plus that dungeon has 4 lock bis items. (Cloak, neck, wand, bracers)
---
NA just takes pride in using everything differently i guess?
---
Also don’t be afraid to take the plunge and reroll on a new server or new faction.
---
hmm i guess the alliance are just more likely to post? it always seems like 2/3rds of the posts are from alliance perspective
---
I'm not saying impossible. But they worked for it. And it would have been a bit faster if you worked at it for the six weeks preceding BG's because fewer people were honor grinding.
---
The WoW Classic honor system is super convoluted, but part of it is relative honor on the server for your faction. If average honor per week per player is going at 200K, you're going to need to do significantly better than that to really rank up, which is just a lot of time spent. Not impossible, but pretty time consuming.
---
Priests can do the lashers in DME but you have to have some gear
---
No it's not, however I can't see the logic in this particular pattern.
---
Month day year feels wrong and I'll explain why.
---
A day is the smallest number, basically 1-9. But when combined for example 60 days it suddenly adds something, an additional month! 
---
You then add 13 months and it's another year.
---
 Which means you move the first number, then the second and last third. Instead of middle, front and back.
---
Excuse my ramblings midway but I hope you get the point.
---
But then there'd be no screenshot :)
---
Don't play Hemo, then. Dagger Prep Backstab builds are still good for PvP and more fun, imo.
---
Things I never expected to find in a wow subreddit lol
---
I lol'd
---
If your build doesn't let you get a point or two of Arcane Meditation like me, then the Fang is probably better. Otherwise, super similar and MageBlade might have a slight edge
---
This is the entrance to **BLAKROC**^*spyre*, the *HOTTEST* new nightclub in the EK.
---
Should be year month day so you can sort by date
---
Faerlina slightly favored Alliance in the beginning. Its shifted towards Horde as Alliance got tired of losing.
---
Denying Frostwolf Relief Hut and wiping initial Alliance in the base is about equal to Horde winning AV from my experience over the week.
---
My impression was also that long games cease eventually have diminishing returns on both reputation and honor, win or lose.  
---
Yes, the statistics do not include HK honor, which like you said probably peaks in intermediate games then DR begins to hit as you get to 45+.    
---
Fast games speed up the queue so you can keep getting 20 rep/minute losses :P I'd rather the win.
---
Thanks!! Problem solved :)
---
Look up zeroji on YouTube - he uploaded a sub 7 minute run which is insane. You can consistently get to the boss in around 5-6 minutes if you learn the pulls he’s doing.
---
Ehhh yes it was cool, but you got far enough to know it wasn’t worth that much play time lol
---
I’m already playing what I wanted I am a Tauren warrior because I wanted to be a thiccboi even tho everyone says to be an orc
---
titan panel shows all gold on all characters, bagnon shows bank using /bgn bank, and bagbrother shows if you have any materials or things in other characters bags.
---
Somebody's on the loot council.
---
At first I thought you tried to say you did this in 3 days. At second glance I realize there's no 18th month and also that weird order in which some countries write their dates.
---
It's written the way it's most commonly said out loud in the states.  There's not some conspiracy behind it.  E.g. December 19th, 2019: 12/19/2019
---
Level 60 Priest - Spec for Wand specialization and Spirit tap. Do ALL of the level 48+ quests that you didn't before you hit 60. Go kill Blasted Lands Ogres. Go heal instances and sell the blues / other loot. Priest is not terrible for making that Epic Mount gold.
---
I have goals that I really want to achieve in Vanilla, and I also remember playing “Catch up” on a Pserver at 60 and it felt horrible, it made me hate vanilla. Granted it was P4 on one toon and P5 on another. Super late to try to catch up to people.
---
Buy mount/Bloodvine/Enchants/Consumeables/Spellbook. , get attunements, water quest, reps, blah it was overload and everyone had it done for over a year.
---
I’m really enjoying being 60, clearing raids, gearing, gold making, helping guildies farm their pre-raid, etc. I could buy a second epic mount at this point (Not going to obviously) and it feels good knowing I have that much reserved for when I need it
---
It only took you 3 days in the 18th month of the year. Imagine that!
---
Yeah except for the fact that group loot is better.
---
Sulfuras on a warrior :(
---
This thread ain’t it chief
---
That belly shirt is deeply disturbing.
---
Like, for what? Parry is the most expensive stat in terms of item budget, so your other stats will suffer heavily from it. It's kind of a little worth it in talents where seemingly 1parry=1dodge in cost, but for everything else, dodge and block is just stupidly cheaper. There's nowhere near enough parry for you to be able to build a mitigation set that way. And on a pvp set you want stamina regardless because magic damage.
---
Are we the baddies?
---
You put way too much thought into something that barely affects you.
---
I had a great time grinding when my data was starting to point towards wins as a superior strategy for honor / rep. By pushing to Stormpike GY then recalling to play defense for 5-10 minutes, I was A) Killing enemies in PvP B) Trying to win, which is more fun than losing and C) Optimizing my grind. The opposing nature is really cool here, as Alliance did not like when they had to respawn far back, and often didn't bother to back cap.
---
I'd only say Warlock because at 60 it feels like there are too many healers for 5 mans (Minus UBRS). That and as a Healer, you're restricted to dungeons, BGs, or playing with friends to do anything.
---
Do dark strand voidcallers in the tower of althalaxx still drop the pettern for robes of arcana? I`ve been killing tons of them and still no drop..
---
Zeroji on YouTube recently uploaded a sub 7 min run. Learn his pulls and you can drastically increase your gph for trip runs and 100g per hour without deaths is baseline I would say.
---
To be honest, I have my paladin almost solely because of class fantasy. I loved Paladins in wotlk and it was my first max level toon. I want to heal on him but i also am going to have him ready for hopefully when TBC drops so I can tank on a pally again.
---
This is amazing, thanks 😂
---
I nut and then continue to stroke even after going flaccid
---
Exactly.  Just restrict master loot and win. 
---
This shit us just as bad.
---
Dude traveling as a gnome seems so damn fast!! One big point in Classic to pick a race for me.
---
I fairly regularly have enemies go immune from diminishing returns(happens a decent bit when heals are involved on both sides). For the record that basically means I had people AOE stunned for 6 seconds.
---
I had 2 instances last night alone where I saved WSG flag caps because my stun went off just as our flag carrier went down and I could scoop it up and throw on a shield.
---
Seriously man it is a busted weapon.
---
I'd rather have the reliability of EA than the inconsistency of 25% resist. I can't recall a single time Hardiness has worked when it mattered.
---
Naxx weapons/R14 weapons likely outpace TF for DPS
---
Hunters and warlocks are generally considered the best classes for solo instance farming. Both can solo mara and hunters can even solo DM Tribute runs.
---
But priests aren't bad for soloing. Look up DM East lasher farming, and I think you can solo Hydrospawn as well. With herbalism, you can make a lot of money this way
---
there is no real need for any guide or analysis of AV rep. except for those who decide to absolutely min/max and put in maximum effort to get exalted a day earlier than they would with minimum effort. even then "effort" in AV is a fool's errand since getting 39 others (most of whom simply ignore the chat window) to coordinate is a joke, you cannot do it. a WSG premade can decide to win or lose, but arguing with people in AV chat does nothing.
---
Wow so horde did really win the war...
---
I regularly duel and use ES in bgs and I chain procc the knocked down 3 times in row quite regularly. Getting a ES proc into mace stun into Es proc on proc on proc is an amazing feeling. It’s also great for dungeon tanking as you can repeat stun aoe groups. It might be placebo but I find that it procs extra when using AoE abilities like WW, thunderclap, and cleave.
---
how would they add faction changes to classic?
---
What happens with pallies / shamans and all the horde / alliance specific awards from classic?
---
If losing is your thing, might I suggest Battle for Azeroth?
---
lol nice one :')
---
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz
---
My point was purely if they are comparing 11 STR to 22AP with no other differentiation, as the OP asked.
---
You can lasher farm your way to an epic mount in a couple days
---
Thanks I will try that, at least I know i'm not alone.
---
As an orc, i can't remember ever resisting stun at an opportune time.
---
I will look into this thank you!
---
NO CHANGES
---
Doesnt usa use the metric system at nasa and in the military?
---
Well post yours tomorrow and I'll take Saturday morning.
---
Longer to get...longer playing...longer subscribed... more money for blizzard. 
---
I wonder why they don’t get on this ASAP? 
---
It’s almost like they’re ok with it..,
---
Cool
---
Interesting, I thought that was just base AP, not AP after stat calculations. I wouldn’t know tho, I haven’t played an orc in many years.
---
Just out of curiosity, how did you reach the conclusion that I do not play wow? Actually I play classic on EU, as per my second reply:" (...) to the point where I sometimes feel really shitty for giving them (Activision) money to play classic."
---
I've been nothing but nice and you did nothing but insult me. What's worse, I literally gave you the definition of one of the insults and you still use it wrong. :-(
---
I even provided alternatives to Richard via Sid and Jim and you still think that you can do more with a cudgel and misunderstood most of what I said.
---
They do. It's just a 2% drop chance so it can take quite a while for them to drop.
---
Twat
---
You could meet in an AV match.
---
They don't transfer, this isn't rocket science.
---
I'm in almost the exact same boat except I'm a druid. Lucked out and found a guild that wanted a Chicken in their raid. Hope you luck out too!
---
Honestly, I just think it's a case of misguided pride. We don't wanna be like England so we're going to measure things in inches / feet / miles, weigh in ounces / pounds / tons, volume in ounces / cups / quarts / gallons, use farenheit,  and write the date in this way! Ya know, instead of using the simplicity of the metric system. 
---
Source: am 'merican.
---
Yeah, but it will work until I am exalted. In the next week or so
---
Horde are asleep, post world boss pugs in LFG!
---
Shh, don't tell the rest of the zugzugs.
---
There’s no reason that that makes more sense than any other format. It’s just a different arrangement. That’s my point. You don’t gain or lose anything with either format.
---
Every cheater ever thinks that, they will eventually get banned 100%
---
Just spam Anger / Arena and invite warriors  who want SGC + Priests / Locks / Mages that want their BIS belt.. forgetting the name. I myself got it on the 48th / 49th attempt.. the only time I've ever seen it drop. Good luck!
---
It's relevant because he made an appeal over comparing the cost of wow to other forms of entertainment along the lines of games, so I gave more relative perspective by bringing up how video games, even a relatively expensive one, is actually still pretty low cost.
---
The boe blue bracers ony drops...
---
It's a pvp weapon. Also sulfuras usually isn't that highly contested since it's so damn expensive to craft
---
Actually they’ve just changed it to work like this. First few days, 5 people reporting you was an instant kick no matter what. Even if they did it before the gates open.
---
People suck, sadly.
---
My buddy is the main tank, granted he’s the most experienced player from vanilla thru BC in the guild, as he completely no lifed it Back then. But damn does he have the guild in the palm of his hand. Half the dudes say X do you need that? Before even giving a 2nd thought to the next 7-10 players in guild who definitely do. Now everyone knows main tank needs the gear etc. I’m talking pvp gear as well.
---
The ones from the machine don't do knockbacks
---
I always thought it was because if you said the date it would be September 18th 2019. So you should abbreviate it in the same way month/day/year.
---
Felheart is better than sublime. The +20 shadow wrath are going to yield more dmg at the expense of health and mana. This will be a personal choice of preference and in some scenarios you will want the pure damage and other scenarios you might want the extra health and mana.
---
Yes, was primarily talking PVE. I am aware that the 5set is better for PVP.
---
You know bots can pvp also right?
---
Killing the 20 dogs is way harder than killing the Guard. Also drops the Heliotrope Cloak with +spell crit!
---
I leveled a shadowpreist on PS, it wasn't bad. 
---
If the sole reason you're picking warlock is because you want an easier leveling expirience then sure that's totally understandable, but it's not like priest is a nightmare.
---
I wasn't aware that I'm annoying you. I apologise.
---
I think it would be best if I left you to your own devices. Best of luck in your endeavors whatever they may be!
---
It's like 50 seconds of mindfuck followed by a 3 second "ahaaa"

If i am correct it is 50/50

First number: shortest period of time 
---
Second number: the one in the middle 
---
Third number: longest period of time

Anything else bar going in reverse is ludicrous

second of all, no fucking shit! i figured it out reading the second time. deductive reasoning.. haha i do that for a fucking living.
---
I mean I get that you're still salty about how P2 went but the longer the horde queues get, the more of them that are out in the open world farming Ally for honor inbetween queues. Careful what you wish for!
---
Again though, we are not exchanging international documents or in a regulated industry lol. We are on reddit where the vast majority of users are American and his construction will be the most understandable to most number of people. Anyone complaining about that is a fucking muppet.
---
not hard, just time consumming
---
Good luck in your search - I am Alliance and on  West Coast server and we raid at 6pm PST (9pm EST) and do our Ony/MC in one night - takes about 3 hours right now including the travel between Ony and MC.  With a full time job and other responsibilities the one night raid schedule is the best way to tackle it so you are on the right track.
---
I mean it doesn’t change anything - literally every green/blue I’ve seen dropped in AV basically everyone rolls need immediately. 
---
The person who kills the mob doesn’t get loot priority no matter what, FFA actually gives you a *much* higher chance of looting what you kill.
---
Oof... I’ve seen 2 HoJs and 1 SGC in my last 3 BRD runs. Lost the first HoJ and the SGC, thankfully got the second HoJ, I might have cried &gt;.&lt;
---
How do you play a gnome and take your character seriously?
---
Hang on... you actually speak like that? 😂
---
Did you increase your resolution and/or enable anti aliasing in this time period? So many jaggies in the first screen shot.
---
What method were you using? I never faced bugs.  I jump down onto the ledge, aggro the dogs.  Before they make it to the final turn I jump down and pull the boss.  Just jump up and down on the “ledge” as he runs back and forth.  Dies after 3 curse of dooms+ dots.   I don’t take damage unless I see the dogs getting to close to him, I force a charge to get him ahead of the pack.  Got my bracers on the 14th kill
---
Change this to Rogue - can't be done as a Druid. The silithid mobs dont have a mob type so you can't hibernate them. Only rogues can do this with cc chains.
---
My guild is around that aswell. Not saying it to "baby the dps" but more so to utilize your characters utility if only for the sake of doing it just to do it. If I can contribute I will contribute
---
yah I just need to find a guild on the east coast that starts at 7pm and I'd be golden
---
God you are annoying
---
U still farming for it ?
---
Just ignore the dogs.  Get the timing down and you don’t even notice them.
---
a random question. Is there any guild specifically created for new WoW players? I successfully seduced my wife to join WoW as her first MMO and really want her to experience it as how we did back in 2006. but being surrounded by people who know everything and have little curiosity in exploring kinda kills her immersion.
---
I made most of mine farming rock elementals in the badlands. Use the ele earth to make sharpening stones, make some decent money vendoring all the grays, sell the solid stone (seems to have dropped in value now that world PvP isn’t nearly as relevant).
---
Not if there isnt enough alliance to fill the bracket lol
---
I still quit while I was ahead, I just wasn't ahead as much anymore XD
---
You could be waiting a long, long time on a tank if you aren't willing to pay. Or even for a healer as there's not much reason to run it beyond the orbs. If you're a mage you're better off just getting on a group quick and farming gold with the extra time
---
If you're horde:
---
Queue for AV + Herb while in queue = make gold/get AV rep
---
Dude, Robe of the Void is like 10x more expensive and its not that much better. I had one of the first ones on the Server and it was defintitely not good value.
---
With your healing background and the fact that you are "always a healer at heart" I would recommend you go Priest and do Shadow Priest but you'll always have the fall back of going to healing if you want.
---
I have both (60 Warlock and almost 60 Priest) and they are both fun to level with - the Warlock slightly more powerful from a solo grinding/leveling standpoint but end game the Priest gives you more options in terms of healing or shadow or even PVP with  Disc/Holy.
---
&gt;1) Eye of Shadow 
---
I've farmed 9-10 of these as a mage, it's really easy in Winterspring to just focus down the Hederine Slayers/Initiates. The slayers have like 16khp and go down quick with a DPS/healer setup.
---
&gt;2) Hide of the Wild
---
Larval Acid will be a bitch to farm, but you basically need to run around EPL until you've killed enough maggots or just buy them from the AH (8-10g on my server)
---
Living essence is super easy to get from DM:E runs, but I'd probably just buy from the AH since they're like 2G on my server.
---
The real struggle will be Essence of Water, you'll need to farm Felwood/EPL Water Elementals for these, alternatively if you have Fishing you can fish it up from Azshara.
---
&gt;3) AV mount or faction epic mount
---
Depends on whether you are Horde/Alliance imo... A few of my guildies got the AV mount within 2~ days of AV being released so you could grind that out and I believe it's cheaper than the regular epic mount (640g).
---
Log every raid and just check beforehand.
---
Impressive to do this now. Phase one felt like this leveling up. If an alli and I saw eachother doing the same quest, we'd usually just wave and go about our business. It was kind of understood that if one of us killed the other, there'd be a fight at each respawn and the quest would take so much longer. Phase 2 really did change the interactions. You never just rode past someone anymore with being attacked.
---
It depends on the length of the fight basically.
---
How do rewards work? If you lose rank 14 you can no longer equip the gear?
---
For 15 minutes each half hour?!
---
Is Blaumaux east coast? If so it shouldn't be too hard to find a guild on your server that is running those times. Just ask around. I'm on Kromcrush and most guilds I've seen run between 6-8pm.
---
Sadly I am, every night I farm for it and I honestly just wanna give up on it.
---
sounds like you need a new guild
---
Gnome warriors are stupid. Should receive a strength penalty.
---
Here's a thought if you have the time... can you grab the list of East Coast servers and try to hit their specific server Discord or Subreddits to see if you can find a guild that is looking for more raiders with those criteria?
---
I think you would have a much better shot at our post / request getting seen doing it that way and have more direct contact with the guilds via their recruitment posts (or most server discords even have a LFG channel where you could post your story/requirements).
---
I mean bud light is meant for the sink. Drink what you have I guess. Gonna buy a nice lager for it this weekend
---
The '18th month' wasn't a giveaway that they were using freedom dates?
---
As alliance, it feels like most of the time horde's winning strategy is to just turtle super hard and extend the game to 30+ minutes then squeek out a win because alliance won't turtle as hard instead of just trying to beat alliance in the PVE race.
---
I've seen a few matches where horde win in 10-12 minutes though.
---
Not sure where this 6 weeks thing came from.  
---
Week 1: Nov 14th - Nov 20th  
---
Week2: Nov 20th - Nov 27th  
---
Week 3: Nov 27th - Dec 4th  
---
Week 4: Dec 4th - Dec 11th  
---
BGs went live on Dec 11th.
---
"Look at me, look at me!" We see you, good for you! Here's a cookie, you've earned it!!
---
"Why use many word when few work do trick?"
---
ally have faster AV queue -­&gt; they got their rep faster.
---
longer queues on horde side -&gt; horde try harder to win, and win more game -&gt; ally loose more -&gt; ally queue less.
---
it's not gonna get better. ever
---
There are different locations
---
Europe
---
North America
---
Oceania
---
Asia?
---
More?? IDK.
---
We generate daily reports at my work and put the date in the file name (example mm.dd.yy.ReportName.pdf) so you can sort them chronological by file name. It wouldn't work if you used dd.mm.yy
---
Soccer

addon - Group Calendar
---
It will mark CD reset on calendar.
---
SSPVP works great
---
It’s 3 different things. I just started this last week and I’ve made a ridiculous amount of gold. 
---
-Blue drops from tinker and princess anywhere for 1-5 gold per item and princess drops 2 blues.
---
-herbalism, usually 3 bindweed noses and 2 ghost mushroom nodes per 12 minute run
---
- selling the black stone ring to melee classes for 20-25g because it’s their best in slot ring for a long time.
---
There’s a video of hydramist doing it on YouTube. I do it as disc/holy spec with PI and 277 spell power. Runs usually go 11-12 minutes and I sell the ring like once an hour when I sit down to do it for an extended period of time. I’ve been talking about this on reddit a lot just because of how shocked I was to find out how much money can be made as a healer.
---
No changes was a mistake of a movement
---
Can a 60 mage solo Noxxion in Mara? I never got the scepter, and I don't want to join some random pug for it because a 60 carrying 40s through Maraudon is just awkward. I could ask guildies I guess but I'd rather solo it if I can.
---
We’re still only in Phase 2, so it’s hard to say what it will be like people are running around in Nax gear. 
---
Right now the difference between preBiS gear and BiS gear is not ridiculous. My understanding is that by the time Nax rolls around, people with endgame gear go around BGs simply blowing up other players. That’s why they introduced resilience in BC. 
---
There’s plenty of guilds that aren’t serious right now, but I’m told that will change as each raid gets more difficult. Again, this is a bit conjecture since those phases have not come out yet. A lot of this is based on private servers.
---
That is kinda flawed and favors the 2nd roller.
---
If 2 people agree to roll for say 25g, each person should roll /100 to see who rolls first.  Then you roll for the gold pool x 10.  
---
I me and you are risking gold, and say you pick a random # 16342 and roll 16342 and hit any random # 1854, thats a 100% freeroll for you, I very well could hit 1 when I roll the 1st roll of roll /1854.  And the game is over without you even having to roll.
---
Both people agree on an amount, the person who STARTED the wager is the one rolling 1st for x10 the pot, that is all that should happen.  The person TAKING the bet aka a "Taker" hence why people say "$25 says I cant down this beer, any takers?"
---
So if I /yell "50g WHO WANTS TO GO THE DISTANCE?" I am basically placing the bet, and you have to accept or "take it.  I start the /roll 500 , which gives me the highest change possible to NOT hit a 1 off the bat, being a 1/500 chance.
---
The person who initiates the bet should always be the first one rolling x10 the pot.  
---
OR : you both agree to /roll 100 and whoever has the higher number goes first, but just back to the x10 pot amount.
---
ME v YOU for 50g.  We both /roll 100.  You roll 42/100 , I roll 76/100, I get to /roll 500 first since I win the opener for a 50g waiger.
---
People doing it any different are most likely giving up some odds of them winning.  Deathrolling is basically playing Craps the dice game, should not work any different.  Someone rolls to open the table, that sets the bar and then you roll vs the waige amount.
---
In pvp it's more paper rock scissors. Like warlock &gt; mage, and mage &gt; warrior, but sometimes warrior &gt; warlock. Both mage and warlock are strong in group pvp and have lots of good duel type advantages. Warlock has more pvp advantages in the duel setting, along with shadow priest.
---
On Ashbringer Alliance everyone knows Ony head is popped at 19:00 every single Wednesday (and other days) as most of the guilds on the server work together to guarantee it which leads to an absolutely horrific experience for 30 mins. A few weeks back Eastern Kingdoms as a whole broke twice within an hour.
---
Due to Hordes knowing our schedules and trying to wipe guilds landing at major FPs, guilds have started banding together and even paying others for protection to keep their buffs! This week there was at least 200 people in a train out of Lakeshire which easily overwhelmed the Horde gank squad (nice try though).
---
This shit is what makes Classic great.
---
why not just change your model?
---
Same situation for me basically. But I managed to find a late night guild to raid when the wife and kids to to sleep. Good luck to you.
---
Also FYI, theres a sub called r/BlaumeauxClassic you should post this on. Might yield better results.
---
if you're logging your raids (which I highly recommend if you are at all interested in improving), you can see it in the summary page while selecting the character.
---
Most servers have guilds that are focused on leveling, they generally invite any low level player and just have tons of people talking shit and helping each other quest.
---
Your best bet might be to look around the LFG/Trade channels and see what people are advertising, if you notice someone mention a leveling guild or something that doesn't focus on end-game content, that's probably a solid bet.
---
Take it with a grain of salt though, some of those guilds can be pure toxic if it's filled with the wrong type of people.
---
Still get instant queue on alliance side 🤪
---
must've cost you a fortune? all the mats? 8 ingots? doesn't one go for hundreds of gold?
---
Lol this has not been an issue once on my server. Ony buff timers are kept secret though.
---
Level 53 Tauren Druid here. Where can I quest right now? Finished Ungoro and wanted to do Western Plaguelands next but found out that there are only very limited quests right now. Am I doing something wrong? Is running Anger/Arena runs in BRD a faster way to climb to 60? Every hint is highly appreciated!
---
Ally have been winning about 75% of the matches I've been in this week.  And they are getting more honor.
---
We a country of imagination and progress. Sometimes we do things our own way that seem odd or foreign to.... well those foreign to us. It’s not like we’re saying our system is better it’s just the one we like and makes sense to us. And if you don’t like it we’ll.... that’s just like your opinion, man.
---
But how is it better than Felheart ?
---
Add me on wow, i have the same name in blaumeax. If you need a guild we raid 8pm est on sundays, 9 pm on modays for ony. Not sure if those work with your schedule though. Im east coast aswell, i know your pain
---
I expected Richard Lewis the comedian
---
This is a very good point. But I’d also like to point out that lots of people consider leveling a character to be more fun than sitting in a queue.
---
Denying relief hut -&gt; Focus on recapping FW GY once you have lost relief hut is perhaps the most effective defense strategy I have encountered.
---
I tend to push to pull an LT to Balinda (as a druid), push Stormpike GY to overwhelm any defense there and get some inertia built for the offense, then recall back and play defense using the above strategy.
---
You are welcome! As long as you avoid the tail you will be fine. Other than that it is basically her fear or if she switches targets and puts you in front or behind her.
---
what this mathematical equation fails to account for is how queue times for horde will be affected by holding more and more alliance lobbies hostage in these 40+ minute matches. expect queues upwards of a half hour before BWL is released.
---
Everyone does this....am I wrong? Click bait...you got me thinking I would learn something new. OP you tease!
---
We are a country of imagination and progress. Sometimes we do things our own way that seem odd or foreign to.... well those foreign to us.

LOK'TAR O-FUCK ORKS
---
No
---
? SL is an amazing spec..... SM/Conflag is a glass cannon build. Again, Lock's are really versatile with all 3 talent tree spec's being viable. I don't agree with the OP here thinking that they are lesser tier.
---
heal bot
---
Because the bugged 90% stun resist isnt broken.
---
LF inv, warr, arms, exalted, epic mount+echants. R7 .BRE.
---
The general complaint from Alliance is that Horde are better at PVP because Alliance dont have "PVP racials". 
---
But no that wasnt directed at you personally, just because you have the Alliance flair.
---
I tried this spot, but I am having bad results.  It was okay last night, but during today it's been awful.   The cave is right beside the npcs, so unless the people are literally afk, they can just stroll inside and be protected by elite guards.   If you push in, you usually just die, while they drink a pot.
---
The difficult part of getting Sulfuras is that you have only a 3% chance to see the drop after a 2hour-ish raid. You also only get to try once week. Then you have to convince everyone to then let you have it. THEN you can start the grind.
---
Nah Blaumeux is WEst coast sadly. I rolled there cause some friends picked this server, not sure why since we're all on east coast...
---
I have multiple sets for different fights for both pvp and pve, there is no bis, but I didn’t want to get into that, I just wanted to see what people thought about finkles.  I also didn’t want to give too much of my own thoughts to bias anyone.   
---
I also understand priority, so I would prefer this for pvp than over SOD that could have gone to a DPS caster for a shite ton more value for the raid.  No doubt with lei out now any 2h just lost a ton of value. 
---
Seems great for rag healing set though pve, fire resist and high stam.  Unfortunately for pvp even though raw stats are valuable, vs melee I always auto swap to unyielding and vs casters the so/healing is likely better value.   
---
So after seeing comments and my own thoughts, I’ll go with, upgrade if you have junk, Fire resist healing set and amazing loot porn for ironforge bridge :)
---
Yes, I'm well aware of how those numbers work. Which is why I said "at worst" it's that way, which it doesn't seem to be. However, since they broken the census addon, there's no real way to be certain.
---
Gotcha. I figured as much. On private servers I actually had two force reactive disks for the breaking problem. Can you see that ever being worth it on classic?
---
Holy shit thank you for this
---
WPL has a ton of quest, but they are chains and not all of them are easy to find the start of unless you are using a quest helping mod (like questie)
---
go to the warcraftlogs.com website, download client, follow instructions. its pretty straightforward, Id recommend testing it fighting mobs before your raid night to make sure it works.
---
main thing is remember to enable advanced combat logging in the WoW client, and to remember to input command /combatlog before you start raiding.
---
8 pm could work, what's your guild name?
---
How engaging a class is depends a lot on what you're doing. As a mage, my raid rotation is basically just spam frostbolt, but in PvP I get to use my full toolkit.
---
Mm. Got a feeling that if I get aurastone now, it'll just put me way down off of the prio list for lok'amir.
---
hello kirtonos enemy!!!
---
I'd probably prio priests first, then the other healers, and finally mages.
---
Also, Nekrage is very sexy and stopped to give me +4 stats to chest while doing World PvP in Feralas.
---
oh nice, thank you
---
60/40 means that it's no longer a PvP server and it's just one faction who owns everything in the game. Imagine if every Arath Basin was 15v10, or if AV wast 40v24
---
Literally any time you resist a stun it matters massively lmao. If you don't think you've ever resisted a kidney or something you're lying to yourself.  You're legit probably winning fights because of it and not even realizing it. 
---
I think if I was playing by myself I'd rather have EA but in a group setting like WSG give me hardiness all day. Both abilities have reduced impact in groups but a lot of the stuff EA takes care of can just be freedom or dispelled.
---
Im a well geared dwarf holy priest... get me into a premadeeee
---
Also if you don't have at least 6k mana you're going to have a bad time.
---
You can get away with 4k mana if you have mana pots,  but even then sometimes you'll get a double resist, or you'll fuck something up and even that isn't enough.
---
You sound like a loser
---
Wait I didn’t know gnomes could be paladins.
---
When AB comes out the BG weekends should be introduced
---
What the FUCK
---
Are you Jokerd's son?
---
What exactly is bracket stacking? 
---
I wasn't around for Honor in Vanilla, I came to the game right before TBC released.
---
I'm currently in a very nice guild but heard some concerning pre-drama (for lack of a better word) regarding one of our players getting too much honor for the week, and I really hope such dumb shit like that doesn't lead to our guild imploding.
---
Money is a constraint. Also it's hard to test things and isolate whether or not one piece makes me perform better because of how many variables there are. Ex. How many melee came with world buffs, did we wipe, what consumables do I have on, what boss is it? etc. Like which would I use in dungeons, raid trash, etc.
---
Spotted the unhappy EU boy.
---
Dude...60/40 is *not* tame **at all.* 
---
It's 50% more horde than alliance, that's fucking egregious and absurdly unbalanced.
---
Same here, now that I never leave my house on weekends I'm saving a bunch of cash
---
Can't take too many locks bc of debuff slots, thats why there are more mages
---
How do I go about getting healers into the group?
---
Diapers, stimulants, and virginity are the only ways to attain such power
---
Spec to whatever you get first. There are some good dagger PvP builds. Seal Fate is fun to play and can be ok DPS in raids (it is by no means optimal though).
---
Chances are it is not for a sake of being different on the OP's part - it is most likely what he was raised and taught to use.
---
Not that hard to understand.
---
Know what I do when I see a date is not in the same format as the US? I realise it and adjust to understand then move on.
---
No am not his daughter.
---
/shrug not really and I won't be surprised if it happens.
---
Gotcha no worries then. Yeah I don't agree with the folks who don't think ally have good PvP racials. Gnome and dwarf are both excellent. I even get some value out of meld but I would prefer war stomp of course.
---
I came here expecting to find "grinding for gears."
---
About tree fiddy
---
MinimapButtonBag is an addon to clean all the addon buttons from your Minimap and make them available through only one button.
---
Hardiness is one of those things where it's statistically better, but you cant really feel the effect. Its nice to hit escape artist and shrug off that 9s hamstring or an entangling roots, and you FEEL it working because you pressed the button and see you cast it and break free. Hardiness doesn't feel all that good while playing as an orc because you dont really notice yourself resisting stuff occasionally, but everybody else trying to attack you notices it every time. It is the bane of everybody elses existence. Id much rather have a racial that 25% of the time can stop stuns, this even means in many fights it'll proc twice. Escape artist is snare/root/slow only and you can only use it once, it will almost never happen twice in a fight, and slows are pretty abundant its really not hard usually to hit em with another slow of some sort shortly after (I play a mage so other classes it might be a little more annoying I'll give ya that). I just feel stuns are more important and fight changing than slows so the stun resist is superior imo.
---
And 7 years old is way too young to be playing WOW. Should have been outside!
---
I got my carrot on a stick from someone else's mallet of ZF, can I still use mine even though I don't have the quest anymore?
---
It was confirmed in a blue post that you only need 9% when your wep skill is more than 10 pts lower than the target's defense skill. When 10 or less of a difference, only 6% is required. This is why the racials and +skill items are such a big advantage and why stacking (other than the minimal gains past +5) wep skill isn't worthwhile. 
---
A point I haven't seen mentioned here for the slow mh/fast oh, is that being a DPS war you will be using WW, HS (with spare rage) and Cleave (aoe pulls). All three abilities scale off the mh wep dmg thus making the slow mh more important to have while dual wielding.
---
For additional rage gen (in the event those don't know), you can queue up HS or cleave as your OH is about to hit then cancel the ability before it is used by your mh. This will change your OH hit% req from the normal 27% to the 6/9% of your abilities. This is confirmed working in classic and confirmed by blizzard to be intentional and not be changed (there was a reddit post about it relatively recently, and am too lazy to do a search).
---
Pally is my all time favorite class, I've mained each spec at some point in time, I would play one in classic, but I'm not a fan of OG pally.
---
its not possible to keep it a secret, if you are in SW and you get the buff you know that in exactly 6 hours its available again
---
I don't agree at all, and that's kinda weak anecdotal evidence compared to the actual polls lol
---
This is the right path
---
Sounds like a fair fight.
---
No, in North America the common nomenclature is month first.
---
I loved it...
---
Retail is the solo experience.
---
Classic is the MMO experience.

Hand of Rag....Valor Shoulders....

Whut?
---
Pretty made up story if u ask me. Nice karma harvesting tho. Gj.
---
Check your servers ah...?
---
And fear
---
i didn’t know there were green/blue/epic drops in AV ever
---
I personally hate Warstomp, but that's only because I played a Feral Druid for a bit. Shifting for your racial stun really sucks.
---
Wait what? Why? (I am not up to date on racial abilities)  
---
As a human swords PVE rogue I havent run into issues with Wars in battlegrounds while grinding exalted AV rep.  
---
1v1 I seem to be able to kill most every class/race combo consistently.. except mages. I have never beat a frost mage 1v1. Ever.
---
Thanks. Is there any place I can read that up as hard facts? Makes sense to me but I'd like to see it announced that way and couldnt't find anything.
---
Okey boomer
---
I stopped doing the Wolves, which require the Ram Hide, because the AV Loot never let me loot the things I killed.
---
Group loot went against what was happening in the BG.  They could've fixed the loot, instead they put it on FFA and let the players figure it out.
---
Sure but that’s just called rolling an alt. If you enjoy the game by leveling characters by all means go do that and level 20 different toons. But OP is not talking about rolling alts to enjoy leveling, he/she is considering rerolling a main for one reason - to dodge BG queue times. 2 different discussions.
---
TUF, and maces in general, are just not as dps efficient (as told by the elitists doing all the maths we don't want to do). Math aside, as nice as TUF is, I don't see it out dpsing DeepWoods+FlurryAxe simply due to what the axes bring to the table for procs. 
---
With AOTDW, the onhit is a blast of nature dmg, and Flurry the chance for additional attacks. Both work out to be better overall when you compare it to the 2% crit from TUF. The stun on TUF  is seriously outshined by the axe procs since you won't really need to worry about getting those stuns out in a raid. 
---
Additionally, you can have crusader on BOTH axes vs just TUF. This provides you with the ability to get two crusader procs at once, doubling the AP effect you get and thus increasing your dps further. 
---
Then of course you have the whole, DW can generate more rage than a 2h thing, which will translate into more abilities used. so.. more dps.
---
ALL of this said, play how you want. The only limiting factor is the group of players you are playing with. Some will care about the min/maxing as to clear content in the most efficient way possible. Others will just want to figure out how to clear content with what they have at hand (which means 'meme' specs allowed).
---
My weed and munch budget has increased more than my party budget now.. Had to quit snus because too much daily expenses rofl
---
I pulled dogs, ran across, jumped on ledge waiting for Aggro to drop, aoe both packs of bugs with vw then kill guard like method posted in video above.  
---
So you were constantly running the dogs back and forth?
---
Yes, after the rushing died down I focused on rep turn ins aggressively, if you get the wing commanders in base and just funnel everything to one guy in base during a turtle it could be serious gains.
---
Hitted

Hit right home

&gt;For starters, you are using an estimated queue time of 7 minutes. For the past two days in my battle group, the average queue time has been between 12 and 15 minutes. 
---
I am analyzing his data using the numbers he provided to show that I do not agree with the method and demonstrate why it is flawed. it's also really important to point out that the reason you're accused are getting longer, in large part, it's because the games are lasting longer so using the same number for both types of games is a little bit unfair to begin with.
---
&gt;Since it has been exceedingly rare for Horde to actually win a quick game (seen it happen just once as I recall), short games equals loss for Horde in my battle group.
---
But this doesn't mean all losses are short and all wins are long. If-then logic doesn't work like that.  Heck the longest, least rewarding game is a loss in this data; as analyzed in the op, this game is being used to justify short games being less rewarding. In my experience short games are roughly 10% win and long games are 50-50.
---
And?  As you said horde don't have pallies and alliance don't shammies.
---
I took a week off for launch. Days off on either side of the leave. 9 days total. Years of pserver experience. It was really easy when you have it memorized.
---
I third this notion. I have been slaughtered by alliance far more times than I have done any slaughtering.
---
Almost...
---
Technically, AB can be won with a 5 cap 1 min faster than the fastest possible 3 cap in WSG.  Assuming identical que times, AB premade should be even more efficient than WSG.
---
But yeah, this current grind sucks.  I'm halfway through 8, and I'm stopping at 10 in 2 weeks.  Screw pushing anything higher.
---
They can shave 10 seconds off boss fights though!
---
Dawg get yourself to DME and solo the jump runs. It's minimum 75g/hr
---
Awww motherfucker. This game is about time, you don't have it. Don't play it.
---
[Looks like shit to me too](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos).
---
Nose to the grindstone leveling.. I got to 60 in about 6 days played in the first month it was out. Have a full time job and live in girlfriend and lost one of the weekends to a family event. 
---
So definitely hit it hard and skipped out on some sleep that month, but really it's not some crazy feat that should be enshrined or thought impossible... nor should it be something people should be compelled to do if they don't enjoy that type of playing. 
---
If it was my first time through I'd probably have taken longer to take in the game and what not, but having been around since beta I leveled enough characters back then it was a "go here, go here, go here".... Also I feel like people that followed leveling guides kinda screwed themselves, because at release everyones looking at leveling guides, so the "best" xp places are crowded and ultimately become the worst. (Minus any dungeon leveling).
---
those are the cheaper consums, also having standards that are followed is healthy for any guild.
---
Ooooof that UI
---
I think that axe spec would make DW frostbite and flurry axe superior. The difference that 5 wep skill makes in glancing blows damage is huge and it counts as 3% hit.
---
Why does it matter tho like if I wanted to play basketball with my friends but we changed the rules, we aren't harming anyone even and just having our own version of fun right? 
---
I don't see why it HAS to be the way you do it , if you don't like the way it's done you can always opt out and not gamble that way, ya know? 
---
Like he said, everyone does it different. Personally, I don't even gamble for wow gold and when I do it's a straight up 1-100 roll for no more than 10g
---
Call me old fashioned :P
---
Ya. I still enjoy it but I wish AV wasn’t so good for honor.
---
Prefer WSG.
---
definately not my experience.
---

Ez got it second try without knowing it even dropped

Yes, all the time.

Better solution, stop logging in
---
Weak auras.
---
Yah I already gave up on that
---
So sad to see this...
---
Imagine talking shit about how someone enjoys a game.
---
Because most people were complete trash and the rest were decent at best.
---
For resto or balance PvP it's a godsend. And shifting out doesn't incur a GCD so you can macro it to be one press in any form. Basically a second interrupt to go with charge.
---
Sure....
---
The problem might be you
---
Sorry we write it like you say it and not "in the year 2019 of our lord on the 12th sun of december"

Hah. Yes.. muahahaha

How much gold did you have to buy to make it? Asking for a guildmate who got the eye last night...

Grats I got rank 3. But man these queue times! Ugghhh

2009 to 2012, the 19th month, 18th day.  Y/M/D anyone?
---
White the tooltip states it as a knockdown it's actually an aoe stun and it does share DR with mace spec and can absolutely be trinketed/blinked. 
---
Source: owner of ES and have dueled others with it.
---
It's still great though and even if worse than other weapons it's a blast to use.
---
which is why faction transfers will never come to classic
---
at what lvl should i switch from rfc to sfk if 60 mage is boosting me ?
---
This is not the greatest city in the world.
---
This is a tribute.

Right now I would not be looking at anything as too high difficulty for you, MC and Ony are faceroll easy as well you would probably want to go in as an OT or DPS first though.
---
Gnome Warriors are straight Gangster
---
Reality, Alliance have better races/classes for pvp overall.  I never realized how strong paladins were in organized pvp until the re release.  Stoneform, strong af, paladins strong af, perception, overpowered rogue vs rogue.  The only thing alliance don't have is wotf which is nice against 1 or two classes but not needed for most classes, primarily good for rogues.  
---
As a mage,  dealing with freedoms and gnome racials is annoying as fuck.  I would 100% rather play alliance as a mage.  I played in the top guild on Nostalrius as a human mage on my last server so I would know.
---
Will get worse. I think 1-2 weeks for 30min queue
---
Smaller hit box confirmed.
---
Wat
---
The brackets increase allowing more people to earn the same RP.
---
If the PvP population increases 50% and the brackets increase by 50% there is essentially no change.
---
It wasn't working for me for a few days after the patch, but I was able to do the 30 second capture just last night with no problems.
---
Sure! Let me just risk trusting a complete stranger on the internet!
---
It's literally nothing to do with the client. Gameplay and scripting for WoW are all server side. The client has some basic scripting only so that it can do prediction and draw graphics, but it's incredibly basic compared to what's on the server and sometimes it mispredicts and gets overridden by the authoritative server. The only thing the client is authoritative on is player positioning to make movement feel smoother.
---
Ha same thing happened to me.  Except i was the warrior.  Not much a prot warrior can do, so i usually just /sigh.
---
Erekos of Benediction.

He’s just clearly a dumb fuck who got clapped by a warrior and missed a few counterspells

You could easily just sell it at no loss on the ah...
---
It will likely level back out again once the horde rep-grinders finish their grind and it's back to people on both sides just grinding for honor.
---
Sounds like he found one.
---
As im scrolling through these answers it seems no one knows how to maximize lock PVE dps. SP&gt;HIT&gt;CRIT is what your looking for so your BiS bracers will be of shadow wrath ( mine have +21sp). Your Bis shoulders/boots/cloak/and helm are all of shadow wrath too.
---
imagine getting this triggered.

I will never understand American dates.

Guessing so, but not 100% sure.

Please no more horde on Smolderweb, lol

Thanks for the detailed analysis!  I think I'll pony up and give that a whirl for next raid
---
Her hitbox is massive, you can stand to the sides pretty far away and that can help avoid breath/swipe.  You could park a car between her and you and you'll still hit her with melee. 
---
I think generally melee stand to the side, between front and back leg, but closer to the back leg than the front. 
---
If you hug her back leg so the animation actually looks like it hits you will get swiped.  Stand further back.  Take advantage of the Xbox sized hitbox.
---
They just wouldn't be able to transfer those. lol
---
Healbot have full functionality.  
---
For other like Grid or ShadowUnitFrames you would need to use mouse-over macros.
---
Order of the Triad, Assemble!
---
IIRC, ES proc is a knockdown which wont share diminishing returns with charge/intercept/mace spec stun.
---
UF proc is a stun and DOES share a DR.
---
I don't know for sure if this is true though.
---

took me 201 kills to get hoj. Good luck.

 /roll 20-100 average roll = 60  
---
/roll +20 average roll = 70
---
so the second method is 17% higher on average.
---
Cause ive seen the name in game. We had a couple fights since phase 2 came out.
---
A lot of Alliance finished the reputation grind in a few days, and a lot of those people will not be queuing for AV ever again.

Still bald and short

We should make an uproar on the official forums, at least to get a bluepost, Retail can still trade plain letters.

Don't roll rogue if u wanna play battlegrounds alot. I main a 60 rogue, lobotomizer 4/8 tier 1.

It's Very fun in open world PvP, alot less fun in battlegrounds. The moment u go out of stealth u are killed very fast in bg's, because u always have to open in the middle of an enemy group.

Also very reliant of vanish and sprint, which have 5min cd (+prep to reset them 8min cd). In group PvP, rogue sucks, 1vs1 amazing.

How easy would getting Rank 14 be?

No Prob! Just went through this process myself relearning the class so wanted to spread what I learned.

Why not?  Shaman and pallies can't transfer, oh well.  This isn't rocket science.

The takeaway here for people is that you can farm gold in lazymode in any zone by checking the AH and finding out what sells well, then finding a zone where a bunch of different good-selling items drop. You'll get the green/blue gear and such same as with Westfall.
---
For example, light feathers cannot be sold on the AH on my server. The only thing you can do with them is sell to the vendor. Eggs that drop from the birds which are used to make the holiday stuff is glutted on the AH, but Westfall is still insanely crowded by egg farmers grabbing more to clog up the AH even further.
---
So on my server, even if it wasn't a holiday event that caused a thousand farmers an hour to descend on Westfall, this guide is of no use to me.
---
How boring..
---
 Who in their right mind would find it entertaining to watch AV spam all day, much less play it themselves. Blizzard really turned this pvp grind into a big joke in classic.
---
Definitly an argument. I play hunter and have full mc/ony bis for weeks
---
More than likely a pvp set
---
well I still have 2-3 hours a few nights a week to play.
---
That's really not true, guilds recruit players, not gear. We had 2 people trial to fill a raid spot. One was a player who has funnelled himself every piece of gear he could before his guild imploded, and the other was a fresh 60 we played with in other games. We chose the fresh 60 over the decked out warrior and it was an easy choice- he is mechanically sound, a good communicator, and most importantly is a joy to do content with
---
fucking stimulants lmao
---
Oh hey Robin Williams!
---
My server you can post it for 1k if there are no others for a couple of days and there is a decent chance it will sell.
---
I'm not necessarily saying it doesn't make sense, but back in classic I don't remember seeing many "Stunresistxd" named Warriors running around ;p
---
In the US, we use MM/DD/YY
---
It really shouldn't matter where gear comes from. Pve or pvp. I shouldn't have to grind pvp specifically for pvp gear to be competitive. Classic gearing has it right.
---
That is such a convoluted way to lose money.
---
Solakhar is extremly easy. Easier than trash.

You just stand on the ramp and fight mobs there. No whelps and you just tank and spank like 3-4 random dragons without relevant abilities.

There's nothing criminal about countdowns.

Get feral faerie fire and the charge.   Being able to do dungeons as a tank is really helpful.  Early on stacking str is better but when more agi becomes available then agi becomes the better choice.  Improved shred is for maximum dps while powershifting in end game content (if you're planning on going dps)

I got confused by the american dates lol. At first i was like what only 3 days? And then i realised there are only 12 months not 18 xD

You dont need to kill whelps or anything. Just stand on the ramp up and tank and spank the dragonkin. No whelps

Kind of, but shamans also kind of hard counter paladins. Paladins are the "unlikable" healbots with awesome support skills, but shamans can purge all those awesome support skills and can interrupt on a very short cd. Shamans can be played very agressiv while paladin game play is very passive. A good shaman can have a lot more impact than a good paladin.
---
Tough luck though if your side has no support players in the match. Ain't nobody gonna help you then.

Are there any good fishing addons that can do the following?

Unpopular opinion: av botting is the true vanilla experience.
---
December comes from Latin *decem* (ten) so it's Sedecimber from *sēdecim* (sixteen).

The smallest amount of time between boss spawns in vanilla was 48 hours, but I’m betting it’s like other world bosses where it’s random between 2 and maybe 7 days.

If that's true you are likely lying to yourself about having balance in your life

Total time played: 90 days, 23 hours, 52 minutes, 39 seconds

You can do it with any gear. It's all about the execution.

It's hard though. I went in thinking I was the shit, but that quest taught me that I was simply shit.
---
When you finish it, though. It feels amazing!
---
I just want them to allow 5 people to queue together for AV so the honor grind doesnt have to be an entirely solo venture.  I doubt it'll happen tho :(

Haven’t seen a more worthless comment in a long time. Enjoy your 12 hour grind sessions while eating the chips those food stamps got you.

It's that thing that bubbles hearths any time you try to fight it.

Research the population, the faction balance and the community.

They have to be actually maintaining a rank so if you have the very minimum, if 2-3 people stop playing...the bracket for 14 gets smaller(using an extreme example just to explain)

How's that? none of this takes tons of time every day to accomplish.
---
Holy fuck the entitlement in some people.
---
Yes. The anti-American in you is fucking pathetic, stop responding to me.

You're not wrong everyone AFKS. But they wouldn't be able to even come close with the players actually pvping in a premade. Anyone can rank right now and there is no competition

Took me a couple of hours on a Saturday morning. I was lucky and didn’t get ganked during any of the fights. I would pick up one or two GNPP and GSPP for Simone and Solenor respectively. Grab a restoration pot or 2 for Artorius as well. Elixir of demon slaying will help but I forgot to use on a few of them. If done perfectly you can do it naked with a bow I’m told. I did it with 4/8 GS and remaining preraid BiS gear and it was a breeze. I would recommend looking at guides and maybe attempting them without consumables first to learn the fight a bit rather than risking wiping and burning through consumes.
---
Will be home from work in about an hour and I will let you know... praying it's just an addon you have that messed it up :P
---
Guys can we focus on Rampart?
---
This is a hard question to answer because it depends on your individual server economy. For example I’ve seen epic weapons being sold for 50g and no higher even with the release of BG’s/twinking/any level range save for a few VERY good top tier BOE’s drops. Even that said those are about 150g on my server as far as I can tell
---
From hot to not
---
So incredibly stupidly boring. And if you even think about using more buttons, you're just going to oom.
---
But "spirit tap!" you may say. And I laugh. Because no. You will still oom. Just keep wanding and try not to fall asleep.

I've got two levels to go but all I do is heal dungeons as Holy now.

FRD gets useful in BWL. It's a beast in the suppression room.
---
disagree, orc in anything but plate looks ugly
---
Gnome is BIS for warriors.
---
If you need +5 weapon skill to tank in classic wow, you're doing it wrong.
---
It’s because the horde have these queues and truffle trying to stay in the game thinking they need to maximize their honor before another queue. This just makes more games take longer and in turn increasing the horde queue even more.
---
I don't mind a newer person getting a good item, but when you're at 14+ weeks of raiding it can be a bit heart wrenching to see someone under 60 get an item you've been trying for months to get ;)
---
Yeah it does appear to function differently in battlegrounds vs open world.  But it's harder to do controlled tests in them so it really could be the case that they actually do function the same but with more external variability in bgs.

We do the same but with yyyymmdd lol. Would be really messy having different years of files all mixed up with mmddyy.
---
Queue times skyrocketing because games are taking longer and you still think long matches are better. Who cares about rep for most people who do care it's done already. Right now it's about honor and a fast loss with a fast queue is better for honor in every way. If you want fast queues again then stop the turtle talk and just go for the honor targets.
---
The way the games are being drawn out, what idiots create an hour long match, you can expect queues to be over 30mins in Jan because Ally will stop playing.
---
gnome zzzzzzzzzzzz
---
not just positions, but actual honor is important.  if 10 people are bracket 1 with 1 million honor, they all get almost full rank points that week.  if 10 people are 1 million honor, but 1 person is 1.1 million honor, 9 people might as well be bracket 2.
---
It doesn't matter. A responsible parent would have made you go outside.
---
In just 3 days!

Hunters can do some great stuff at 60 that no one else can (like tribute solo).
---
I'd say go with the hunter.
---
Character named Dicegirl will invite you to a group. You trade her an amount of gold and tell her over, under, or even.
---
She then rolls 1-6, twice. If the total is what you guessed (under 7 or over 7) payout is 1:1. If you guessed even and the total is 7, payout is 4:1. Otherwise, you lose.
---
I agree too WSG is much better and actually a PvP battlegroup, running hundreds of AV's just proves you want to grind a pvp rank without doing or liking pvp. As for pvpers, they are grinding AV to make up for honor pushing high ranks, but i can asure that nobody who enjoys pvp will say AV is funner.
---
That'd be awesome. Now the loot is set free for all and you can't change it.

Try  
---
/script CompactUnitFrameProfilesGeneralOptionsFrameHeightSlider:SetMinMaxValues(10, 72)  
---
/script CompactUnitFrameProfilesGeneralOptionsFrameWidthSlider:SetMinMaxValues(10, 144)  
---
After those u can drag the slider to make them even smaller.
---
&gt;  This is about perfect, flat, easy to read, minimal.

You're telling all this from the loot table?

You're not seeing action bars, unit frames, health bars, chat boxes.

---
I play Ally on Fairbanks, and it is actually rad. The community is tight knit and progressive. Great place to play.
---
I've heard duoing DM tribute runs (druid+rogue) can be pretty good money depending on if you can sell the items in the chest. Tarnished Elven Ring sells for ~50g on Thunderfury, so I imagine it's not bad if you can find buyers! Also vendoring the non-sellable items in the chest should be decent even if RNG isn't on your side
---
Fairbanks is more like 55-45...
---
As a horde member i can say if i see you fishing i will not attack in av
---
Then you are the anomaly that made me say “almost never”. Server may not be dead, but your guilds are (imo) shite.
---
Currently yeah, horde is winning on the situation.   
---
Because horde defends and alliance refuses to, from what I've experienced.   
---
If alliance starts defending too the time for a win will go significantly down on average.
---
The alliance PVE'rs who wanted the rep for the epics are done it, so there's smaller amount of alliance queueing up.
---
Hope so also, but it happened to me after relogging during raid. No addon updates were done today...  
---
Please let me know your situation!
---
to add onto what others have said a yoituber called uberdanger talked about it in a youtube video and famous bald man asmondgold reacted to it so a lot of people are deathrolling recently.
---
I did the leveling grind 3 times in vanilla back in the day, and probably 8-9 times fully in retail. That's why I got to 43 in a couple weeks and stopped in Classic, it just stopped being fun. Felt more like a chore.
---
You are averaging 4.5 hours a day playing a video game. Take a step back and internalize that.
---
We aren't confused, we just like to take the piss.
---
Woooosh, and more for when I’m buying tobacco/alcohol is what I meant I suppose haha

Works for a lot of zones. Westfall is getting crowded. But yeah swiftthistle / magic dust farm works well.

I love farming Winterfall Village, even though it's overfarmed. But the last couple weeks when all the try-hards were camping AV was the sweetest farming I've ever had. That time seems to have come to a close.

---
On a similar note, is Coarse Stone selling extremely well on your servers?  Heavy Stone sells for about 90s/stack and Solid's about 1.5G/stack but Coarse Stone consistently goes for 2G/stack
---
Stealth coffer runs, the keys are super cheap on my server, I'm averaging about 20g/hr
---
That’s what... 600 hours you’ve spent since release on the game? 
---
Tack on a full job... that’s a lot of time away from the wife and kids.
---
I'm typically in the top 5 as CB/P, but in this group I was usually 20th in DPS lmao
---
This is the direction I'd try to push the discussion were I an Alliance player who did not want Horde to start defending and stalling.
---
Alliance just needs more selfless mages CSing and Sheeping Horde Stall Team 6 in midfield to protect the zerg.
---
PvP is way more time intensive and you wont get gear unless you are putting in 16 hour days rn.

Draconin can eat my ass. So can dinklage. The guy who took the eye over the old man.

I leveled herbalism recently, it was fairly painless and actually made a decent amount of gold doing it. once i could herb blindweed, swamp of sorrows was covered in it which sells well on the AH. 200-280 was a breeze in swamp of sorrows &amp; blasted lands.
---
So let me ask you this. A hunter that has performed 99% parses consisntely in your raids vs. a newly recruited warrior you would still prio it to the new guy? I don't think you understand how performance based raiding works or guild affinity.
---
It's not always about what gives the percentage most DPS upgrade, there are ALOT more factors that go into a fair loot council.
---
Would take effort and resources from blizzard and they refuse to use those on classic.
---
&gt; Anyone can rank right now and there is no competition
---
Pick one
---
We did it in like 1.15 and that was "slow"
---
Definitely existed in vanilla. Maybe not these specific deathroll rules but rolling for gold was 100% a thing in vanilla.
---
For 6 - 9 days played your looking at 2 hours a day for 72-108 days. Far more than I can manage with job, partner, friends and no kids. I'd love you to tell me how  I can play as much as you.
---
The #1 person on that Ragg kill (99 parse) is daggers lol
---
27 * 2.25 * 3 hits average = 182.25 hits.
---
It’s a 3% chance per hit.
---
Not seeing one crystal in 182 hits is ~ 0.4% so it’s incredibly unlucky.
---
Hmm. Maybe I'll finally cave in and do it tonight/tomorrow. I get so unmotivated after about 10 flowers that I stop and don't pick it up again for another few weeks but I'm desperate for money so lmao
---
Not just vanilla, when Honor was a currency for PvP gear it was a problem in every BG.  I've always hated Honor as any kind of incentive.
---
It really sucked the fun out of BGs when 1/3 of your team was AFKing/botting.
---
Or you apply a little common sense and play when they are sleeping. Kids are usually in bed at 8pm and the wife is in bed by 9pm cause she works early I typically work later in the day and im gaming from 9pm to 1 am on days I work. I also work 4, 10's in which I have 3 days off a week in which I can play even longer while wife is at work and kids are in school. it's really not that complicated.
---
I pick both. I don't want anyone and everyone to have access to rank 14 and there should be heavy competition in order to achieve it so it's actually difficult to get.
---
Not really. You can fish for Essence of Water, not sure how its now but back then that was way more efficient. But even if you buy it its cheaper than 10 Essence of Fire and 40 Felcloth.
---
Good job! You found the singular exception to the rule! How often does is that scenario the case
---
No, YOU stop responding to ME :^) Im an american myself btw.
---
The difference is huge with tier set bonuses
---
I forgot mm/dd/yy exists and was impressed you managed this in 3 days
---
That was fucking amazing, helped me a lot with default raid frames,  
---
Can you do something with power bars, like reduce their size or, to set them go upwards?
---
Since it's the date, it's regarding period of time. Focusing on the numbers in a vacuum and using that to justify the ordering is stupid.

I think it does have DR, but I'm not sure either
---
We are on a lower pop server not lowest but lower pop server. Be more of a dick.
---
And we were all on dell prebuilt grey hunk of junks on DSL speeds
---
Is there any way to adjust the size of all frames at once?
---
Play when wife and kids are asleep and play more on days off, not really sure whats hard to understand. My wife and I dont work the same hours so she's at work and kids are in school on my days off. That's plenty of time to play.
---
Bejeweled is great!
---
&gt; Not spending $150 at the bar every Thursday and Saturday is absolutely saving me more money than I thought.
---
I mean I’m not an accountant but I would have put a guess in at around about $300 a week...
---
Filthy Casual.
---
You can hit 45gph if you have very good gear. You can't get more due to instance cap (5 runs first hour, 4 runs every hour after).
---
I don't think ranking should be easy, I just think Blizzard should be doing more to stop bots.
---
Found the AFKer.
---
That is however what we're disgussing.
---
Take the time to level herb imo. It’s better to lose gph now to level it in order to make more gph later. Your overall gph will be a positive gain.
---
You can go to WoW-professions.com/Classic to use their herbalism leveling guide. You won’t make much money, but you can save some items for when they release stuff later (like firebloom and is ur ole lotus for the weapon oils from ZG).
---
In my battlegroup it's bought up in nearly every AV i join solo.
---
Fairbanks is actually much worse than 60/40, and from talking to people on the server a few alliance guilds have recently transferred off so its likely even worse since paid transfers open.
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true
---
Obviously data here isn't perfect, but it's really the most reliable there is. Most guilds parse, and the ones that don't are probably super casual raid loggers/dont participate in end game content anyway. 
---
This is definitely not a good server for alliance to transfer, I've done a lot of research into it as my guild is on a dead server and we're trying to get people off. Pretty scummy to lie to people, considering everyone i've talked to on the discord/server disagrees with what's been posted here. 
---
I think the fact that this guy is saying he's trying "to avoid a flamelash scenario" makes it pretty clearly how bad this server is for alliance rofl.
---
Dude take a shower and go outside.
---
It’s not that crazy and they likely don’t realize how fast leveling can be with optimized routes etc... not to mention ZF GY/Gorshak runs. you’re fine.
---
My bad.  So,  basically:
---
/roll 21 120
---
Is the same as adding 20 to /roll.
---
Stop posting on reddit bitching about other people and play the game 4head.
---
Yeah but then not everyone does it on eighteenember!
---
"Ruined".
---
The rogue didn't ruin shit.  Don't place blame on him.
---
Are you using a Asana for this.  My heart
---
Fairbanks is miserable. If you are alliance on here, you will be farmed, never be able to farm, never kill a world boss, and corpse walk for about an hour a day. 
---
There’s about 2000 more horde players and I don’t think we’ll be able to make up that difference. I’m transferring off with my guild and you should join us.
---
I've actually had the same thing happen to me! I was building a few magic decks, both pioneer and modern before wow classic dropped. I'm still slowly picking up the pieces I need but they haven't been nearly as much of a priority since I've been playing classic every night. It's been nice having extra money recently.
---
That's not how this works.
---
Ranking was never supposed to be easy, that is true. However, the present day min-maxing culture, along with all the knowledge we have of Vanilla has definitely allowed people to take advantage of the system. People who ganked/griefed/etc full time (as opposed to the “group up for larger/longer battles” method) from the start of the Honor System up until the launch of BGs had already skewed the rankings to the point where the players that wanted to rise in the ranks via bgs will have a much tougher time. Because of the amount of people min/maxing in Classic is exponentially more than in Vanilla, wayyy more people will be logging in on Tuesdays disappointed. Most of us knew this would happen though.
---
You can only get 5 runs in first hour. Every run after is capped at 4 runs. This is called the "fence post" problem. Another thing guides don't take into account
---
It really hasn't been like this since battlegrounds have launched (well besides the world boss business, which this post is trying to remedy)
---
Hmm hit the sort by most recent tab and watch them go into chronological order. Seems tough
---
Lvl in dungeons with your friends, took me a week of 6 hours a day
---
Lock gear has way more stam then int so you'd have to tap anyway to access you stats. Plus the more spell power you have the better your lifetap becomes.
---
Nekrage is guild leader of OranThul, the largest H side guild, and he streams regularly. Kirtonos-H is very much alive and well, though I'm not sure I can say the same about the -A side. (Denror, Glorious Dawn)
---
And you’re a hunter?!
---
Yes. WPVP is not a ranked game, it doesn't have matchmaking, there's no rules. It's a FFA no holds barred. No one should roll on PVP realm expecting to have 1v1 duels with equal leveled opponents. If that's what you want you should look at FPS, RTS, MOBAs, any number of genres that are built specifically for fair, 'honorable' PVP gameplay.
---
That doesnt make 4.5 hours a day in leisure activity a good thing when you have a full time job, and a family.
---
I play 3 to 4hrs a night after my kids go to bed. I play on my laptop in the living room with the wife as we watch TV. I'm lvl 60 with near full bis gear for my class, completed my Rhok'delar bow, and about to hit exalted in AV. I think experience, and more importantly recent experience is a huge help. I have hit max level 3 times on a private server since the announcement of Classic. And knowing where the dungeon quests are picked up from, how specific mob groups pull, where chain quests lead, best ways to farm for my lvl 40 mount, which items will be more valuable later, amkng other things really streamlines the 1-60 process, and the process of getting gear.
---
Both in 1.15? That's fast. We just did a wipeless 25 player run of MC in 2.5.
---
hey me too!
---
900k Honor and still only standing 2400? What madness is this?
---
Seriously cry more. This is how tanking works. This is how battlegrounds works. There will always be afkers and bitters in BG blizzard doesn't care they aren't going to fix it so just stop crying about it already
---
cant find a group as a tank in LFG sometimes
---
Why did I laugh so hard 😂
---
if you are skilled and dedicated enough,you will be getting invited. Maybe not to the absolute top premades but you can still work your way up through networking. Problem is  most people either are not good enough as players or dont have the insane amount of time on their hands.
---
Im currently rocking viskag felstriker combo gotta day it clapped fools so hard in p2
---
Join horde Mirage Raceway EU PvE...my guild are all old WoWers, but have a you do you attitude... we're just here to help if you get stuck :-)
---
Isn't wsg better for honor? Me and my guild have been running premades and with a pre-made it's a fast and easy win 99% of the time with short queues
---
That's some pretty good gear progression for 3 days ;)
---
Usually if you can have your team on them keeping them busy you can trinket and cast a pyro, then follow it with a pom pyro. Mine hit 1800 each without a crit, so you at least chunk the shit out of them for your team!
---
he didnt get 15 hks so it didnt count
---
Is this possible as a hunter or are you a tank / healer?
---
If that were true you wouldn’t take 2 hours getting into BRD...
---
Ah it's brutal man. I feel ya, I think I'll just get enough honour to prevent decay and sit just shy of rank 6 till shit settles.
---
20g is like wiping to full repair twice, tbh.
---
You mean to tell me that 2.5k people got more honor than that in a week????  On my server I saw a rank 8 with 3k hks and 800k honor for last week and he was like top 50 lol wtf is this server??
---
My guild got a guy to rank 14 in vanilla by spamming AB and having them just guard the farm every single game. He basically sat there while we 5 capped pug after pug.
---
No, just 1. Ony is pretty quick though. I never timed it. Less than 30 thats for sure including trash and getting out there.
---
That's nice, but with an extra 15 players you could speed that time up a ton, plus dodging as much trash as possible.
---
Next up on things that never happened.
---
Man for real, this is definitely exactly how it went down at the end of vanilla too with the 1.12 AV. 15 years later with #nochanges I don't know why people expected this to be anything else.
---
I dont know much about the mob in blasted lands, but you can also use the spirits at the end of DMN, as long as you don't get the king buff (then they become friendly).
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but auto action is considered hitting ( apply lures)
---
Any wardrobe add-on should help you out with the gears.
---
For the best. Levelling is the only good part of the game.
---
You can't change it anymore, it's always FFA.
---

---
When I waved at you yesterday I didn't wanna have to kill you, I just wanted to see your hand of rag! Good fight though it was a close one. Also get away from my ore in Azshara
---
Wow that's over 1 gold per day!
---
Lol I respect the honesty
---
Plate repair bills don't go anywhere near that high.
---
And was bugged for many expansions afterwards so you could sometimes join it ungrouped.

---
40+ minutes for oceanic horde, stop whinging haha.
---
I did notice last night that we stopped having item rolls pop up
---
I also had a random blue item in my bag but thought maybe it came from a quest I turned in earlier. I must have looted it and not noticed.
---
I'm making 40 per hour.
---
Really? It doesnt make sense? Its not like the skills used in combat are different now than in legion than in wod than in mop than cata? We have things like talent trees, old pruned skills, weapon skills, etc? 
---
Its almost like youve never read up on star wars galaxies and how the debated "end" was the new combat upgrade that made combat a 180 turn from what it had been before.
---
Ahaha I did the same thing the other day
---
You make it sound like they are either they are scrooge mcduck or a heroin addict. There ARE levels in between and some people just need a nudge in the right direction when overspending.
---
Yeah good advice dude just get a felstriker. Easy Percy
---
True warriors are bald
---
I didn't say it has to be, I said it should be. Just like the SI system should be standard but there is an entire first world country who does not believe this to be true.
---
Now sort alphabetically i.e. the default sorting and the one the windows image viewer uses.
---
You rushed too fast leveling and you picked a class you didn't like (probably because it was the fastest leveler) those are your mistakes.
---
Pick whatever race/class you like and enjoy the game.
---
ITT: Europeans thinking there are at least 18 months in a year.
---
I genuinely cannot believe that there are do many people (or just a vocal minority) that actually want to lose. 
---
It's not fun, it's not relaxing, it's soul sucking. Games are meant to be fun and instead of spending 60 hours enjoying yourself in AV on your way to exalted you'd rather spend 55 hours intentionally sabataging your own faction or just flat out afking.
---
It's blows my mind how far we've gone down the road of the efficiency meta in gaming and how we'd literally rather lose the game if it means we can spend slightly less time playing it.
---
a rogue in my guild saw 3 in 20 runs lmao
---
That’s odd I took two 3 minute clips two nights ago and it seemed fine.  So when you launch you don’t get the “press alt+g for game bar” pop up in the top left anymore?

Razorgore Server (West Coast PVP)
---
We raid MC/Ony from 12 - 5 server (invites as 12, first pull at 12:30) on Sunday. That's 3 - 8 eastern. Last week we finished at 4pm server. We also do Ony at 430 on Mondays/Fridays depending on reset.
---
Most of us are in our 30s with full time jobs/kids so were pretty chill, not very hardcore. Also several east coast players so we try to keep our raid times early for them.
---
The vanilla ranking system was always awful, but this version is truly terrible. You can literally fish your way to rank 14 if you wanted to. Queue up AV, head to the lake, afk fish, and repeat for 16 hours a day until you get your weaps. 
---
True, the rank system was always more about time put in opposed to actual skill, but at least private servers required you to actually pvp and be somewhat decent. Most pservers didn't even release AV until a few months after WSG and AB for this very reason. Even then, AV didn't pop after the first few weeks because no one queued for it outside of av weekends. But we've got crossrealm so it's not going anywhere.
---
Blizz really should nerf AV honor, but they won't so we're stuck with this abomination. What can you do.
---
I’m heals ya but it’s still possible. You only need 2 novas so you can make the group for your best shot, at least for gorshak. You do need a mount for ZF GY runs if you don’t have yet.
---
What about the mage do you not like?  That may help advise on classes you may like.
---
Projecting much? I’m really an engineer and in the industry here we use imperial units and military time/dates (YYMMDD).
---
Games basic as hell, dont over complicate it, just have fun.
---
/thread  
---
The Frostbite axe is better than AotDW and it's almost bis, behind deathbringer by just a bit. As as orc you shouldn't even consider anything else. Alsi, in the offhand flurry axe is bis. Flurry axe is better in the offhand than Core Hound Tooth, Brutality Blade, Vis'Kag, or even another Deathbringer. Even with edgemasters as an orc the stats you lose giving up your glove slot to equip something like Brutality Blade is a DPS decrease.
---
You need it if you're powering through Engineering, and in addition to people just not wanting to farm it, tin veins can annoyingly scarce.
---
I don't remember what they're called but they're the chained mobs in the southeast corner of the map.
---
Not just vanilla should read : Not Vanilla
---
Remember this is TBC AV we’re playing, and a nerfed TBC with no war master buffs. That’s why the honor per hr is so insane.
---
R14’s from AV was not the vanilla meta stop peddling this nonsense, the first r14’s premaded WSG and then AB after release outside of the bonus weekends. Blizzard once again failed in meeting 15 yr old deliverables and the question is no longer “why?” But “why the hell does blizzard think tanking their own game will increase retail investment?”
---

---
I think you just divided by zero.
---
For someone out of the loop, how will AB be better for Honor than AV?
---
I do realize that the majority of vanilla, AV didn't give rep like it did in the 1.12/1.13 version, and that only existing for a few months prior to TBC releasing. But since we get this version for classic, AV is king for honor grinding.
---
So I ask how will AB be different or better? Isn't it possible that AV will still be the best?
---
Level 52 with 95 gold. Some people.
---
&gt; No, clients wouldn't broadcast that to other clients.
---
Fair point.
---
&gt; The way you actually would do something like this is that the server just informs each client that the buff has been added to each player and then each client just acknowledges this and adds the buff visually and make the animation come up. 
---
And here's the problem. Suppose there is 100 players seeing each other. Once buff if applied server has to broadcast 10,000 updates. This is literally O(N^2) complexity.
---
Haha yo! /lick bc fighting in water is ass - but you ran too fast at me so I had to charge. Gnomes are batshit. I could make excuses about 2h mace skill (crafted last night) but you brought your A game sir
---
Interact e transfer.
---
When you unlock heart of the wild, 1 str = 2.4 ap making it more worth it.
---
Best weapon should be the crowd pummeler as its viable for a while
---
Inb4 removed for low effort
---
Gotcha. So you just leave it on group loot and everyone passes on the agreed upon reserved stuff?
---
when you only get a raid spot as a warlock tank because you didn't want to drop Soul link.
---
Do you know what patch that was by chance?
---
Hardiness is the best pvp racial in the game and it's not particularly close. Most roots can be almost immediately reapplied as well. There are also belts you can wear to remove roots. Resisting stuns that can last as long as 6 seconds is absurdly OP.
---
If you play an orc, you're not going up against that racial so you might take it for granted.
---
wtf rogues are literally the rock to the mage's scissors
---
yep. personally got a traveler’s backpack which was pretty nice and seen screenshots of Maiden’s Circle, Krol’s Blade, and more
---
Okkay, the guys said he had 3 60s.
---
It is no where near flamelash 2.0....way to emphasize hyperbole statement in your argument. Keep researching buddy and transfer to a Alliance heavy server. Have fun RP'ing.
---
You hit max level in 1d18h
---
Since you have a lvl 60 mage you should try Warrior. Gameplay is totally opposed to mage and it's very gear dependant, so every gold you put into your war make him stronger.
---
Pls no, this took all my mana to conjure
---
If Discord overlay being off still doesnt fix the issue, Geforce Experience has it aswell so you can fully close it and see if that may also be the issue.
---
Bravo
---
2 spots  ZF graves and DM:E lashers and satyrs
---
Wtf
---
It's going to get worse actually, alliance have a lot of people who are all about PvE and just want that rep, once they cap out they wont be queuing any longer. You'll probably hit 20-30 minute queues in 2 weeks for AV
---
Back in my Day could use a few non-warriors for our raid. We clear it all, but we're doing it with 28 often. DM me here.
---
You can be like me. I'm up to 5 epic world drops so far lol. Best being hand of Edward the odd that scored me 500 gold after the 15% cut. Then I sold a bow for 120 then two hammers of the north for 20g each and dwarven hand connan for 280.
---
Trying to avoid a Flamelash situation does not mean Fairbanks is in any way, shape, or form, an actual Flamelash situation.
---
We're a few days deep into paid server transfers and IF is still as lively as ever. The server is the #3 most populated PvP server in NA, and apparently it's already a dead server? What?
---
Crowd pummelers for leveling?
---
I have the same issue. I think it's due to the mouse movement being fucky in wow for whatever reason. Haven't been able to fix it.
---
However, I did find a weak aura that has a little circle that always shows where the cursor is. Superrrr helpful and I have no problems with losing track of my cursor anymore. If you need a link let me know
---
Herb took me like 4 hours to level while watching Netflix. Dropped 300 skinning and 300 tailoring and got 300 herb alch same day. Its really easy. 
---
As a druid you should focus on herbing for gold imo. You are a survival god in pvp and you can root, herb, run. You have stealth and soothe beast. Perfect herbalist.
---
Just doing ghost mushrooms is not worth it. You gotta kill the bosses too. Unsure of you have the gear for that.
---
Or you can find a good geared warrior and do duo dme jump runs and split the arcane crystals.
---
Not a real solution but may help. I upgraded my ancient pc last week to deal with some similar stuff. Because of low cost of mid grade ~2015 used components and the subreddit /r/hardwareswap I have a whole new rig (mobo ram cpu and gpu) for **$160**. (Not including a new cpu cooler I didn't really need  but wanted for $30)
---
How do wing commanders work exactly? They always confuse me
---
It has 16 str and like 5 agi so its a really good stat stick for its level
---
Lol this game has more to do than any other game out on the market. Stop playing it 24/7. It took me 8 and a half days of playing time to get to level 60 and I got there on Thanksgiving.  That's like 2.25 hours a day from the release to get to 60 while trying to gear up and get professions to 300. That's already quite a commitment for me having a full time job, a needy girlfriend, family emergencies, spending every Sunday watching football, and holiday's now. I am still working on filling out my last few pieces of pre-raid bis, grinding gold, getting AV rep and trying to find raid groups. 
---
If the game is stop playing it so freeeeckkking much. That's what people's problem is.
---
I thought it was 3 days haha, m/d/y format is weird lol. Gz tho!
---
Insane RP value
---
Not exactly punishment...we knew there would be imbalances on horde on PVP servers and people still chose to play Horde. Every try hard and their mother is all about "MUH PVP RACIALS" and riding the PvP meta instead looking at the bigger picture. 
---
Yes, I agree blizzard should have put a cap on faction imbalance but #nochanges you know?
---
You just upset your not in bracket 1. We're or are you one of the people who thought they could actually reach rank 12-14 lol
---
A bit of a different question: my guild is hosting a secret santa event and I got a lvl60 DPS warrior. What can I get for him? I'm clueless.
---
Lv60 too, gold isn't a problem but don't want to give too much or too little.
---
what made yall choose 42123 ?
---
Is there an updated link perchance? That one says it’s expired
---
But everyone has to have Exorsus though, right?
---
Fair, I'm thinking, you're going to run out of uses, and you're not going to save time if you spend it trying to get pummelers... That being said, idk if random green of the tiger wouldn't be better.
---
Yup. BiS FR and RP weapon.
---
Fairbanks alliance is a lot better now that badtank and entitled are gone.
---
&gt; Is it because the bgs have come out?
---
Yup.
---
Pretty much overnight a ton of the world-activity and dungeon groups died out, instead hundreds/thousands of players went into BG's.
---
They're still very 'new', lots of people are grinding out rep and honor, and it's more appealing to a lot of players on a PvP server.
---
Well yes for yourself as well if you join them
---
See, I view raids as a weeknight getaway from life. Raiding on the weekend would be to much a commitment
---
Lolol. F
---
Ranking via AV is dumb. 100% agree
---
what does progressive mean in this context
---
Why would you want Lobomizer as Hemo though. The offhand for a hemo rogue is basically a stat stick. Both CHT and Brutality are good OH weapons although CHT is a bit better because it got better stats on it for PVP.
---
No? Better to be a majority than a minority
---
If you’re on a high pop server then it’s just you because I have no issue getting them on mine, but if your on a dead server it’s because there is no players. A lot of servers have died out so that’s the case for a good amount of people
---
He's the Dr. Manhattan of Classic WoW
---
I actually am probably overdue for a new computer, but its annoying because both programs work independently, and it seems silly to buy a new computer (even though it is an upgrade) when its working perfectly fine. 
---
If running discord via browser doesn't work, I may have to just bite the bullet and order new parts.
---
Thank you though for the suggestion, I'm hoping for any potential solutions.
---
Other people have contradicted the 65/35, my post wasnt just directed at the OP. 
---
If multiple guilds are offering gold for alliance to transfer it seems like the all the guilds seem to think the server is in a bit of dire situation or at least on the edge of it. 
---
You guys just keep confirming my belief that the general attitude of fairbanks alliance is that the server is in trouble.
---
Kinda looks like megaman
---
The levels to this post, love it!
---
Play female anything. Horde is just deformed head with human body and big titties.
---
Yep, it’s how all rank 14s were made and even then it still caused most to quit. 
---
Sit in a BG for 18 hours a day for 3-4 months so you can get better gear to sit in a BG all day. Yeah that totally makes sense.
---
Idk its not me. I wish i has this gear
---
Craft him lionheart
---
Imagine not being able to run max (10) on Classic WoW in 2019.
---
Yep imagine wanting rank 14 but not even being willing to go get 15 kills in one week.
---
I think there are a lot of things they could do to AV that would indirectly effect the overall honor grind. First off they need to detect afk and botters on their end, leaving up to players makes it easy to abuse. I think they should tweak the honor and rep gains to incentivize winning and strategy. For example give way more than 400 honor for the quest to turn in 3 badges. Maybe give half as much instant honor/rep for killing Bal/Galv, lts, towers etc.....but that honor/rep *triples* the instant you win the match. This would make players want to actually play AV to get the best honor/rep farm. Winning means everything, but only if you clear all the objectives on the way....so proper play would get hugely rewarded. Keep the DR on honor kills to de-incentivize players dragging out the match for no reason. Just tweak the gains so that killing all objectives and winning the game in ~25 minutes gives significantly more honor/rep per hour than anything else.
---
Its Fairbanks, dont think you *really* need to specify horde :P
---
This. They keep the VW up too which would be important. I actually would really wanna heal in this fight.
---
I didn't double check it, so hopefully no typos!
---
Not sure tbh you habe to look that up in the settings
---
Fucking hell i see way more people complaining about the complaints. The guy put up a post outlining his thoughts, it’s better than your dumb fuck useless comment. Just shut up next time.
---
You can solo it as a warlock. And you can do it with healer and warrior.
---
Ah ok, thanks for the reply.
---
I do wanna try SL tanking tho. Pretty hilarious tbh
---
Whats rfc stand for
---
SUBLIME ARE NOST BIS, this is driving me fucking nuts how bad a lot of bis list are. 
---
Shadoweave cuffs from Lord Incendius in BRD are BIS for a raid PVE environment. (~4% drop rate)
---
21 shadow damage
---
10 fire resistance
---
you can solo Incendius too, just kite him around the circle of where he is. Even in crappy gear you should be able to do this fast enough to lock urself out (5 resets within 1 hour). PM me on reddit if you have questions how to get to him/trouble killing him.
---
The next option is a green pair of +21 shadow damage bracers.
---
*note WSG are technically now BiS with +22 all damage and stats, but will never be obtainable for the vast majority of players (need 270 WSG wins to get exalted).
---
For PvP id rather use Felheart&gt;Blue PvP Bracers&gt;Sublime, so many warlocks running around with 3k HP it makes me sad thinking that rogues are killing them before they can get out of stun, and warriors are 2 shotting them. We arnt mages, we dont have blink, frost nova etc. We are tied at the bottom for classes with least mobility. Warlock is incredibly punishing on bad position.
---
Thats because he didnt have the required 15 kills
---
Because everyone is already max level and nobody wants to bother level again, pretty simple.
---
So much for the "the true experience is the journey" lmao, my ass.
---
I'm still lvl 55 and can barely find groups for brd

I spent 9 hours helping someone get an eye before they bought it
---
Why
---
    Man I really want to sympathize with you, and be politebut ranking is not meant to be fun. Its a grind and if it bores the fuck out of you please just DONT do it. 
---
    I think it goes without saying that 99% of pvp situations in vanilla are not a test of skill, and are not always fun. It Didnt matter if it was open world, or if we have wsg or av, its not gonna change with ab. Please for the love of god STOP ASKING BLIZZ TO RELEASE MORE AND MORE TO FIX A PROBLEM. You are the reason why the game is rushed. You need to accept that you dont like certain things and make the concious decision to tap out and do other shit.
---
I really wish everyone could be happy all the time and enjoy everything and it be perfect but rushing this game is not solving your problems.
---
Both are good in pvp, priests are braindead easy whereas warlocks require a bit more.  Warlocks are probably less boring.
---
In theory if a premade can 5 cap a PuG in AB they will hit the score cap very quickly. It’s a mechanic to prevent the losing team from having to suffer being graveyard camped by a much stronger team.
---
That's fun. We haven't had a single CHT drop yet, but we have three in the guild with Viskag and Brut combo.
---
Played a shit tonne of all those genres and everything else in between, it's all nothing new to me. I didn't come back to WoW expecting 1v1's and you are kind of totally missing my point - the fact I haven't had a single one in like 3 months since launch was my real point about player behaviour.
---
As I told you, read my comment history before you tell me to go to PvE servers or back to retail or to play some other genre. If you have anything interesting to add about player behaviour/psychology please do, otherwise all you are doing is dressing up "un-sub/pve carebear/gotoretail" each time you reply to me.
---
Day comes before month comes before year in order of time magnitude. Is that so hard? I didnt realize education was that bad in other parts of the world.
---
The active phase 2 pvpers on horde who camped IF and flightmasters saw a decline for weeks then convinced their guilds to leave flamelash with good time left, so they would not get punished at all, they are on earthshaker. 
---
Im stuck there tho, only solo pvped for grinding spots / herbs and my casual guild cant move in a short time
---
Because originally if 5 people reported you AFK you were kicked immediately, so naturally people used this to kick people they didn’t like, non 60’s, people doing the AV quests, people not from their server, people not from their premade, people who didn’t follow the exact strat they wanted them to, people who said something they didn’t like in chat, etc.
---
Now we get the old system where if you report people they get a debuff and have to take action within a certain time or be removed. Easily circumvented by a bot. So when you see 10 people just AFKing or fishing through the game, thank the wonderful classic community for proving again and again and again that they straight up cannot be left to manage any aspect of the game themselves and require automated systems with a ton of restrictions to play nice.
---
Its pvp BIS forever for mages so it should always be at least 400g.  I'd aim for at least 600.
---
Progression based. Competitive raid guilds and PvP teams.
---
Dagger rogues with Amush nukes are- but Sword rogues dont have the same burst
---
Now that's a good shitpost.
---
Depends on the guild. Cat form and moonkin dps are terrible in raids. Rogues are better and if u wanna be a caster, play mage or lock.
---
I play on Fairbanks Alliance. Server is fine. Always loud vocal cry babies posting in here. Who most likely are from the guild leaving. I’ve play along side entitled since Nost for the most part decent group of people and I wish them luck with whatever server they move too. I think they’ve made the wrong choice but it’s not my money.
---
Yerh I know the feeling! Made me try retail again but that just seems no fun
---
YYYYMMDD too for those in the government/military. So many ways to write the date!
---
I log my alt in for dungeon carries, pay 3g and gain 20% of a level in a rested run.   Almost to 50 now, barely any time played.
---
Gift battlenet currency.
---
At first i was like "HOW IT 3 DAYS?"then *realization*
---
This is why you keep track of the CD and not when people are supposed to pop it
---
True, skill and knowledge are both relevant factors. There's way less clickers and keyboardturners though.
---
You should keep the chart going in excel and start adding in queue times as well.
---
Everything about the original honor system is horrible, it was exactly like this in vanilla with people AFKing, botting, or account sharing their way to r14. 
---
It has never been about PvP skill, *only* who can play the most and who is willing to cheat the most. Welcome to vanilla.
---
"cycle or two"??? One of the things I love the most about classic is there's pieces in phase one you wear for the whole game for a lot of classes.
---
Are you playing on an opposite faction heavy server? High level zones are contested meaning PvP will occur. I think this is intended to be a chill lazy farm for someone who's maybe working while playing or watching the kids while farming some gold.
---
Me too. 48 now...
---
Would like to add, if you have herbalism dm:e is pretty good as you have 4 spots with gromsblood (25s on my server) or/and dreamfoil (70s to 1g) also random ghost mushrooms (over 1g) also felcloth (2g+)  from satyrs. Green BoE goes to disenchant for more money. I've got 5 BoE epics dropped to me, 1 was freezing band (sold for 675g). The problem is to reset the instance you need someone to help you, or logout for like 5 minutes. Zf is easy, you can do 15ish minutes resets and raw gold is very good. Most of the time I vendor everything from there. You need macros to delete cheap grey items to be able to do something like 4 resets before you need to vendor. I recommend to look it up on YouTube, you'll find macro there too.
---
Bottom line. For me DM:e is more like gambling as I can score some very very expensive loot but if you need quick raw gold - zf is better.
---
Meanwhile Warriors can spell batch slam, auto attack, and MS at once. Possibly get a HoJ/Windfury/Sword specialization proc in there as well.
---
Yeah they also sound really fun! How are they with mana in raids (if you raid as shadow priest)
---
You say alliance will stop queueing AV like its a threat. Once AV queues get so bad for horde, the honor grinders are going to premade wsg (and they cant premade AV) because it will be better honor when you count queues and its more fun. Every ranker Ive talked to can't stand AV and wishes wsg was better honor.
---
nice.
---
I would just use the 20 shadow damage and marshal your resources elsewhere. 
---
I use +30 shoulders (with a +5 fire resistance enchant from argent dawn revered)- which you will use till rank 10 likely or until 3 piece nemesis
---
+20 shadow damage bracers(+7 intellect, +9 stamina is fine too if you die a lot), which could last you past BWL. 
---
They can be replaced by bracers of arcane accuracy in BWL but lots of people want those, furthermore rockfury bracers come out in phase 5, anyone can farm them out, and they are BiS forever. Myself, I will skip arcane accuracy because id rather have other items that are harder to replace from bwl.
---
I also use a +21 shadow damage green cloak with +7 fire resistance on it.
---
that is all my green of shadow damage now. I have nothing against +30 shadow damage boots, but malekis are +27 and have some stats so those are fine too.
---
When you are in the 400+ spell damage club, getting the +21 over +20 bracers is a 0.25% damage increase, also remember shadowbolt doesnt get 100% of your spell damage.
---
There aren't many opportunities to CoD in MC, purely because things die too quickly, but in BWL and beyond, where you'll be separating trash and killing it much slower (the trash after Vael and the trash after Twins come to mind), it's fairly easy to toss a CoD.
---
From a pure DPS perspective if you can use CoD you're getting a bigger DPS increase than with Shadowbolt.
---
because it fixes it?
---
you still get diminished honor for killing the same person repeatedly in a 24h period. long turtle games give diminishing returns on hk honor compared to quick rush games
---
Which is a pointless ladder, because the game doesn't actually care about your placement in deciding who you PVP against. It's literally just assigning you a number to rub your ego and hand out some purpz.
---
Make friends with a warlock and beat on banished demons or elementals.
---
Completely arbitrary 5 digit number!
---
Me and a buddy was talking about these drops the other day, and we discussed if the binding drops feel less rare than vanilla. 2 weeks ago, my guild got both bindings in one run, and this week his guild also got both bindings in one run. They have been raiding for longer than us, and they already had 2 bindings from before.
---
Tbh i think we started to defend mostly because we were tired of 15 min queues only to lose in 7 minutes and Get no honor and rep, and the first av day it was Kinda worth for us to just kill lituenants and just go afk and let alliance end since we had Max 2 min queues
---
But... you don’t need better stuff for PvE unless you’re competing for for world first or speedrunning world record. I mean anyone who can play that much is probably in a hardcore guild who will clear BWL and AQ40 the day it’s released even without any PvP gear.
---
And for PvP? You don’t need it either since when you’re rank14 you have basically finished the game and if you go to WSG afterwards, you’ll met pug or team with average players 95% of the time that will get crushed by your team.
---
Frankly there’s almost no reason for a sane person to spend 2 months farming AV honor: it’s unhealthy, mind numbing and 99% useless.
---
Whatever wal-mart worker.  Running a spreadsheet is not hard except for the uneducated.
---
Is this a specific person that I probably just don’t know about or is supposed to be his expression? (Asking because I’m out of the loop with memes usually haha)
---
During my entire rep grind to exalted, I lost 2 games that went over 40 minutes, and never had a match last more than an hour.
---
That’s crazy. Coffers are worth like 45s each. I’d never pay more than 15s a key. Otherwise it’s not worth
---
Not all pvp trinkets break fear
---
Yup. That ego rubbing? Player behaviour. Now you're getting it!
---
I stand corrected
---
i'm gonna start saving these threads where people whine about how pvp and the honor system are because they're assblasted that they'll never be able to have a job and r14 at the same time, not realizing that that's exactly how it was in vanilla
---
first because it's hilarious to read idiot after idiot complaining that the hardest grind in classic is hard, and second because i wanna make a compilation video of top 10 anime mental breakdowns over the honor system
---
Yah I'll try that
---
True. All our contracts renew yearly so all the reports from different years go in different folders. Year/month/day is probably the best
---
I wish Demonshear would drop, good thing though every time I've ran Strat live I've gotten an orb (only run rr).
---
I recorded the numbers Blizzard gives me when I queue, which the first few days were much lower. I've been mostly getting &gt;10 minutes lately. I did not record true values, just the estimate in game.
---
THIS!!! Me and a homie were in an arena/anger run &amp; we both were there for HoJ. We put the group together as a pair so technically we both had it on reserve. He wanted me to have the first one. I wanted him to have it first. So I suggested we deathroll for it from 999,999. Took like a good 90 seconds to get down, which was damn near the end of deciding need or greed, but he won in the end and I’ve truly NEVER felt more while rolling greed on that. He won it &amp; instead of us both rolling need it made it so god damn exciting. If you’ve got a friend and ever end up in this situation, GIVE THIS A TRY. If you’re there for friendship first and not loot, you will not regret the outcome no matter what happens
---

---
Fun challenge is to play with alt+z engaged and not being able to see moves/cd’s.
---
Yeah I already got pretty decent pre raid gear. Just need to find a decent raid guild that fits my schedule
---
Party pooper. Some folks wouldn’t have known.
---
Ok
---
&gt;It's not a bug, it's a feature.
---
Agreed.  Please nerf AV honor.
---
PvE server.
---
Which is what a "working / watching kids while playing" person should have rolled on in the first place.
---
Solid joke, bro. Solid joke.
---
The third and fourth rows, just below average queue and average length, are what you're looking for.  
---
The values for honor and rep I gave are also divided into "per minute," so this account for length of the game.
---
yes phase 3 is correct! thanks for adding that in.
---
I am advocating farming BRD over strat bracers :) I plan to wsg premade and go for those bracers instead though.
---
Is that the correct math for the drop? I got my 4% from guybrushes spreadsheet. I farmed them out on nostalrius but have had no luck here and have changed my goals based on WSG release.
---
Also this is 270 WINNING wsg. My experience solo queueing in classic for WSG so far has been losses with 0 flag caps, making it essentially impossible to get rep at any appreciable rate. 
---
taken from another reddit post
---
*Warsong Gulch, at level 60, you get 35 rep for a flag capture, and you win if you get 3 flag captures before the opposition. A win awards 3 tokens, a defeat awards 1. You get 50 rep for handing in 3 tokens.
---
So, winning WSG = 155 rep
---
Losing 3-2 = ~87 rep
---
Losing 3-1 = ~52 rep
---
Losing 3-0 = ~17 rep*
---
massive difference in rep gain when you are winning. Im positive most people would get BRD bracers in less time than they would WSG bracers.
---
That would be nice but sunday afternoon is almost never good for me, with the kid and all. 7pm EST time is what would be best... I guess Im gonna need to transfer to a East coast server.
---
I have this monitor and had this issue. Turned out it was too cold in my room. Is it cold in your room? As soon as i made the room warmer it stopped.
---
Yah same all my buddies who picked Blaumeux stopped playing at lvl 40... douches.
---
nah
---
\#nochangers asked for it, and now they can enjoy it
---
Lol I keep my place around 73-76 throughout the day
---
200
---
Yah Im thinking seriously about transferring, just not sure where yet. I'll try to find the discord server for some East coast servers a find a guild this way.
---
There’s an honor cap at 1.3 million last week.  Countless people in the premade got there
---
I think the argument form would be then, say, at minute 30 you're wondering if you should just give up and lose or keep trying to win and potentially extend the match. At this 30 minute mark, the decision that would yield more honor or reputation would be to win, so you should try for that. At the 0 minute mark, you should not be aiming for a long win or loss, you want a quick win. If the game has drawn out, you still want to win, but it won't be as efficient as a quick win.

Fap on

---
If Kirtonos has one I did not use it. I tried queueing with one other person by timing it in Discord a few times but it never worked for us. So we just chatted while doing our own AVs.
---
Man this should be it's own post, wish I had those maps when I was leveling
---
I dont what that is. What's that in real temperature?
---
If someone asked you what day it was would you say? The 19th of December?
---
Metric is definitely better though.
---
Mage's amplify magic effects ur life tap too. Black belt technique. Good on fights you dont take damage. As jblock14 said you are wasting global cooldowns life tapping. Every lifetap is 1.5 seconds you arnt casting shadowbolt. Thats why major manas and runes are important to essentially increase ur mana pool, they do not trigger a global cooldown.
---
yes a hit neck is bis for healing priests. moron
---
(Horde) got to exalted in approx 3 days(casual playing, 8-17min queues), around 45-50 games, 235k honor. I lost initial 2 games because of Rush zerg meta of alliance, then i started asking raid leader for assist, organize and optimize raid groups, ask for some defenders to follow me, and stall allies and retreat.
---
Got 15 wins in a streak, then 1 loss, 10 games winning streak, 3 losses in a row(alliance adapted to our turtles) agaisnt good premades) then some wins to exalted.
---
How to maximize reputation and honor gain
---
- Defend, most alliance are pushing.
---
- Loot Bodies
---
- Turn in all Loot and defend base/gy's/towers with your life!
---
I was averaging around 800-900 rep/game.
---
I'm on skullflame EU. Server felt just as dead before the BGs as it does after. phase 2 really put a noticable dent in the population.
---
I don't have data for that! I could have tracked Alliance honor/minute in the BG, but don't have queue or reputation information and decided against it.
---
I feel sorry for you for commenting something this stupid.
---
I got it with no riding skill. Pally 40 mount, Ram for 60.
---
&gt; /run sfx=GetCVar("Sound_EnableSFX")

---
/click StaticPopup1Button2
---
/cast [nochanneling] Fishing
---

---
/run SetCVar("Sound_EnableSFX",sfx)
---
any idea how much honor that would equate to and how fast those kinda games are?
---
And we still have to consider the Q times, but they might be similar to AV but I dunno, will have to wait and see on that. But all of these factors will determine what the better honor grind will be.
---
Everything that you said proves the system is flawed.  Seriously, when will we get the first report that someone died from playing AV for 4 days straight.  What's the point, there is 0 skill involved in this crap, the novelty has worn off and people are going to quit because it's garbage.
---
&gt; But... you don’t need better stuff for PvE unless you’re competing for for world first or speedrunning world record.
---
What kind of mentality is that? I want to improve my character. I could probably clear Naxxramas with my current gear that doesn't mean i dont need gear anymore.
---
&gt; And for PvP? You don’t need it either since when you’re rank14 you have basically finished the game and if you go to WSG afterwards, you’ll met pug or team with average players 95% of the time that will get crushed by your team.
---
I like playing PvP. I enjoy AB and WSG. I already play those every now and then at the moment and we face good premades all the time. 
---
And again... wow is an rpg game. Its only natural wanting to improve your character.
---
That's a nice one. :) 
---
I was farming for Crusader Formula, and when I had it up on AH a friend of mine whispered me if I could take it of for him, as he didn't have the gold ready to go. I wanted to give it to him, but he didn't want to accept it cause he knew I was farming for gold. He insisted on paying me lowest AH price as soon as he got it but I didn't want to accept that from him. Basically two guys negotiation being too soft on each other.
---
So we set up a game;
---
Deathroll from 1000, I win he pays me 200g (roughly 70% of AH at the time), he wins he gets it for 150. 
---
I lost the roll, but I was happy to help him out while getting some gold and vice versa.
---
Yeah, I just gave up on leveling herbalism while leveling my character (not sure why) and ever since I hit 60 I've been too lazy to go back and keep leveling it. Think I will judging by all of the comments here though, seems like it'll be my best bet in the long run. Thanks.
---
73° to 76°F
---
This isn’t him you fuckin midget
---
Dps warriors will have a hard time finding groups for dungeons. Because why would another warrior want to bring someone to do the fun part and also compete on gear? The answer is they wouldn't.
---
Nah it’s that one time use item that summons a felhunter, dropped by a rare mob just north of the GY in duskwood.
---
But I have my heart set on the Mistsaber :(
---
Thats not real temperature
---
Shadowfang Keep? Don't think I've ever done that dungeon period. Maybe I'll try it out tonight. Thanks.
---
Swords are better for hemo yes. What do you have against dagger PvP specs tho?
---
Exactly this. I don't even bind it
---
Main tanks have t1/t2 already
---
Using such a long queue time average for  quick losses is somewhat flawed. One of the biggest reasons queue times are going up is because the games are lasting a long time. You should be using a much shorter queue time average if we were all going for quick losses (like day 1 and 2).
---
Well hes asking people to adapt to the fact that you can basically afk in AV and get an absurd amount of honor, i was just wondering since he told people to shut up and adapt if he had any ideas of what adaptions people should make. It seems silly to tell people that they shouldnt complain about a problem when he cant offer a solution. Im not demanding anything im trying to have a discussion.
---
Must be nice....
---
So you made two threads. Ill reply here too. This exact problem was related to heat, or lack thereof in my case. Either that or it just went away just as i turned the heat up. Never had this issue again
---
Progressive is a trigger word now?
---
So for alliance there is a massive- I mean MASSIVE amount of coordination on discord.  
---
I did all my rep grinding from honored to exalted in like a couple days.  
---
They just have a queue channel with hundreds of people, someone does a count down and everyone queus at the same time then they post in the chat which BG # they got and split off into designated channels accordingly.  
---
Each match was taking 7-10min
---
You assume it is mostly people try-harding some meta?
---
I don't play Alliance because my racial options are Human, short human, short and fat human, and non-white human with long ears. I want to look cool while playing. I find the races completely boring. It's why I picked Horde over 10 years ago, and why I picked Horde again.
---
Nice ninja edit with a quote from the added content to try and make me look like an idiot.
---
Can you show me any kind of evidence or context for your claim as to why PvP servers are designed for the kind of players that want an advantage from the word go? If that were the case, we would have published realm populations so people knew which faction was dominant. Sounds completely made up sorry bro.
---
Hypothetically speaking though - let's say you are right. PvP servers were designed explicitly for people that wanted an advantage. Firstly - we are back to player behaviour/psychology from the word go. The person is the problem, not the game. Secondly - if you were correct, why would anyone join Alliance to start with? Based on your logic, every single person that rolls on a PvP realm rolls horde - for the PvP racial advantage. Thirdly - what kind of financial incentive is there for Blizzard if one faction gets sick of corpse runs and FP camping and stops playing/unsubs?
---
Honestly bro you are starting to project a bit now, and your ninja edit says a lot about your integrity. Typical horde...
---
You fucker
---
Expression. Stereotype for people who smile like that in photos.
---
Accounting for queue times, wins yield at least the same honor and more reputation than losses, on average. The summary and raw data are in the OP. I am posting this because it is not an opinion, it is an observation, for which I provided the data. "Right now it's about honor and a fast loss with a fast queue is better for honor in every way" - your hypothetical fast queue followed by a fast loss not only does not reflect reality, and would still be incorrect if there were no queue times. That data is also in the OP (see "Without Queue" rows).
---
If longer games lead to ever-increasing longer queues, I am unsure. I am curious to see how the queues play out as Alliance seem to be finishing their reputation grind before the Horde.
---
Make sure your bags are empty before you go.  There are also a couple really nice Twink items in there that will sell well.
---
r6 BiS w/ MC gear + Epic mount, plz send me an inv!
---
I don't know. Smells like some kind of conspiracy. Someone call Jesse Ventura
---
I disagree. Stop scremaing you whiney bitch. Hit is clutch.
---
This is dumb, rank 11 epic mounts are only 90g
---
I dont know what you GPU you have, but make sure its capped, because i normally play 200+ but certain places such as dungeons where your fps spikes even higher up, i get like 600 fps+ but also starts to kill your gpu as the load will prob be 80% or higher like mine was.
---

Please! I’ve been thinking about this for so long. I feel like the only way to do it is with a script
---
alright fatty
---
wait what. We get more mana from taps wirh amp magic?
---
Honorbuddy is dead and there’s nothing on the market that is nearly as coherent.
---
What are this raid frames...blocking off so much vision. Hideous.
---
I'm not saying it takes skill to get rank 14,  but it was also not 1.12 AV racing as the *only* way to gain efficient honor... 
---
Regardless blizzard is using a more modern queue system and not the original vanilla queue system, allowing only alliance players to premade AV and not horde players... its a problem.
---
Can you please explain how to do this
---
Pretty fair conclusions. I also enjoy the more intense PvP, but I'll be doing much more WSG now that I have my mount!
---
This ring is hot garbage for pvp
---
The only way to adapt is realizing how stupid the system, ignoring it and doing something else.
---
What? On my client it's capped at 200
