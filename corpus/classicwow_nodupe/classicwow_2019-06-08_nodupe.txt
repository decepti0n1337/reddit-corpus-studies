Ah shit. I think I fixed it now. Thanks!
---
Aside from the tank, all the resists we need will be found in consumables and buffs.
---

---
We're well aware that Pservers aren't perfect, but there are ones you can host that are much closer to Vanilla in the leveling experience. With us confirming that everything 1-40 is the same between Beta and our server, we're fairly confident the rest is accurate too. And if Blizzard continues to up the level cap, we'll have even more data and opportunities to run our routes on their own servers.

Chuck Thun is best raid boss.
---
They would need to strategically announce the end. If they release one more expansion, and then announce during it that it will be the last one, I'm not sure how many people would stick around if the content wasn't a lot more compelling than BfA. Also, once that is on it's "last patch" so to speak, how would they keep people around? It would need  some serious sandbox elements or world events to keep people playing until the very end, as opposed to killing the "final boss" whatever that would entail, and then unsubbing for good.
---
Beacuse he lied about playing a video game?
---
They were good as much as i hated this dude i had a huge amount of respect for him.
---
Why is it that the people who oppose this idea are always the most toxic?
---
I don't believe /sit macros will work in classic anytways
---
Which is why you deleted all your comments? üòÇ
---
Oh I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt even weighing in on that. He mentioned knocking debuffs off raid bosses with Screech, while OP is only arguing for them being best for leveling.
---
But the OP also argues that sheer pet dps isn‚Äôt the only factor for keeping pace while leveling. The hp and armor adjustments do play a sizable role in efficiency.
---
They won't. All those continue to exist in Retail. We'll be getting all new names.
---
That's genuinely a good idea, well, except for the fact that people would eventually figure it out.
---
Did you not read what‚Äôs above this comment? You moron
---
yeah, that's why warrior dps sucks too. :)
---
Rasta, Madden, we used to have epic WSG matches against Niar land TLW usually long stalemate games that they would clutch win at the last min annoying.
---
You only avoid interaction when you do brain dead content, if you did any dungeons that actually required more than one brain cell rattling around in your head then you'd know you still have to communicate
---
That is one pissed off bear.
---
It's T**i**rion Fordring and T**y**rion Lannister.
---
Twinks?
---
That's what he says. Joana who hold's the world record for classic 1-60 leveling uses a cat.
---
&gt;horse
---
What kind of horse may I ask? :) Thank you for the giggle.
---
Awesome!
---
you're right, blizzard confirmed the /sit thing is a private server mechanic only.
---
using the word insufferable unironically is insufferable
---
I don't know the guy, but that's a bad argument. Intentionally being an asshole doesn't make you not an asshole, and it's not a rebuttal to people pointing out "Hey, that guy seems like an asshole to me."
---
Bingo. 
---
I dunno shit about you individually, just a provocative statement generalizing an entire group of people only 7 years younger than me. 
---
But then I‚Äôve lived through those last 7 years. And despite how busy I thought I was with my hourly job, looking and applying for career jobs with my new degree that suddenly doesn‚Äôt seem valuable, trying to maintain relationships with people out of school and out of town and those still in school...I‚Äôm busier now. I‚Äôve got even less time for games now. Time goes by faster now...
---
I can only imagine what it‚Äôll be when I‚Äôve got a life that depends on me and a mortgage to pay instead of rent. 
---
It‚Äôs not a dig, just a fact of life.
---
Kinda nitpicky, yes, but absolutely essential.
---
Fix plz.
---
Is this like when an author writes a book about their dog and people think it‚Äôs a commentary on society, yet when asked about it the author just goes ‚Äúits a fucking book about my dog. Nothing more‚Äù?
---
Casting? Dwarf is pretty good imo
---
So would I have to get a  good 2h for this spec or could I rock w/e 1h/shield  I use for healing?
---
&gt; I don't know the guy
---
You don't know him. You don't get to judge his persona.
---
Dudes please stop trippin and dreaming. If you want to camp and snipe soda remember that he will be leveling with good players in a party and he actually is one of the best streamers by skill. If you all think that it will be easy to kill him while being surrounded by let's say Venruki, Ziqo ectx just be real with yourself. You wont even be close to killing them. Most of them have played private servers especially to discover the best and fastest way to level and most of those edge lords which try to kill them doesnt even know how the leveling back in the days was.
---
I‚Äôm not even tryin to be toxic. But the idea that your presenting is beyond retarded. It‚Äôs impossible for 1, 2nd it‚Äôs literally not going to affect you if you happen to play on a streamers server
---
Id rather play on a streamer server.
---
Most are i'd say.
---
The cringey double reply. Too angry to even look at the username you're replying to. Yikes.
---
Might want to let this one go before you break some drywall, champ.
---
&gt;Once dishonorable kills come out in p2 people will be a lot less inclined to gank low level players since the system punishes you.
---
That's not how it works. You get DK's for killing NPC's of the opposing faction, not for killing lowbies.
---
I played Female UD Rogue in vanilla. Flip finishers ftw.
---
Thats not true, i'd say its about even maybe. People who RP generally seem to be way more causal about gearing and people who PvP are way more dedicated to gearing because it's the difference in winning or dying.              
---
          
---
Still I think theres enough for at bare minimum 1 RP-PVP server at launch and I think it will create more problems with transfers later if they wait.
---
Agreed
---
Here you are doing the same thing.
---
StarCraft Ghost anyone
---
Thx great
---
Your 15 year old memories do not make you an authority on Vanilla.
---
I loved priests that did this back then. Such a great feeling.
---
!remindme 67 days
---
Out of like 20 servers u wont be on the same one anyway. Its all good man. I really dont understand all this hate? Just ignore them lol
---
i remember being perpetually poor throughout vanilla because  I was constantly upgrading my gear throughout the leveling process in the AH as a warrior.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm going to try to avoid buying gear while leveling at all costs this time around - being my epic mount was a horrible headache for me. It's going to be really tough on my main - I plan on maining a paladin - but it shouldn't be so bad on my warlock or druid alts.
---
no im not playing on a server with any big streamers on it. but just from watching pretty much every big streamer for years, and lirik specifically has a less cancerous chat then the majority of the other big ones. idk why you think me having an opinion on something requires me to be playing on the same server as them.
---
[WoW &gt; Runescape](https://youtu.be/sug4QLrwk-Y)
---
Yes it‚Äôs primarily for 2h
---
But you can change some talents so it‚Äôs also viable with 1h/shield
---
Caster pets are garbage, 30% less stats than regular pets. Just don't tame stuff that has a mana bar.
---
Pet families have different modifiers on armor, health and damage: [example](http://web.archive.org/web/20180312200056/http://companioncodex.com/species-catalog/)
---
Pets didn't scale from the hunter's stats until TBC. A naked lvl 60's pet and a full T3 hunter's pet will do the same damage (minus the 50 AP the pet gets from the T3 set bonus).
---
It‚Äôs granted with a sub on 8/27. Right now you aren‚Äôt guaranteed into beta
---
Indeed, You are not alone
---
I am in precisely the same situation. We have about 2 months to make up our minds friend
---
Deleting your comments isn't hiding things then? ü§î
---
Yep, np!
---
The dude is clueless just like a lot of people who fool themselves there will be a sudden resurgence in hybrid specs.
---
Blizzard made classic dungeons long and tedious with endless trash packs.
---
Once classic raiding hits a lot of these smart asses will be in for a rude awakening because nobody will want to drag their underpeforming ass through a whole raid that will take at least 2 hours even when everybody is fully geared.
---
A price I‚Äôm willing to pay
---
I meant that retail is granted with a sub, since the reason he'd be subbing is Classic. Essentially, if he's subbing anyway, try out retail while he has it.
---
I mean lots of MC gear is alot better than prebis.... but you are right that prebis is unnecessary.
---
I know that you're joking, but Battle net account can be linked to twitch account.
---
&gt; Is there a build where at 60 you can tank dungeons fine, and then go kitty for raids, or heal for raids, without a full respec?
---
Short answer, no. 
---
Long answer, still no. 
---
Hybrid classes were designed to be healers in Vanilla. This design goal is clearly reflected in their tier set pieces, which lean heavily towards healing in tier two and three, and just how their trees handle talent allocations compared to other classes.
---
You can "spot" roles outside of your main spec role, but you will not be as effective as if you were "fully specced" into that role. So if you are specced for healing, you can hop into bear form to spot tank, but you won't do well. If you're specced for catform dps, you can hop out to spot heal, but you won't do well or last long etc.
---
This also means that players will not be taking you if you are not specced for the role they need you to fill. So if you are healing spec, a raid leader is ***not*** going to take you for a dps role, you'll have to respecc to dps. You would actually be almost a waste of a slot at that point sadly. 
---
The design goal in Vanilla was that you could do it all as a hybrid, so therefore you shouldn't be as good as a "pure class" in that role. I always found this to be odd since you're specced into that role, respeccing is not easy or cheap, and you still have to collect gear to do that role anyway, so you should have been on par with other classes. 
---
Sadly that would not be the case until Wrath, and while TBC helped make hybrid roles better, it wasn't really solidified until the second expansion.
---
This is never going to happen.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtisticCogentGullRedCoat
---
Man that would make the game so much better. And levelling takes too long, some sort of gear with experience bonuses on it would be fantastic! They could probably make groups easier to make as well, and running to the instance is really inconvenient.
---
Impossible?  It's child's play.  The server self polices, you see someone streaming you make a ticket with the link and submit it.  Blizzard does the rest.
---
It's your opinion whether it will affect people's gameplay or not.  However there are a large number of people who do not want to play with streamers.  This gives them what they want.
---
I'm going to do what I always do, choose the server that alliterates with my name the best and hope things work out.
---
I'm subbed and I only log to put auctions, the rest of my gaming time atm is occupied by Diablo III (when my gf has free time to play), Xenoblade 2 (beast of game, my save has 300+ hours and I haven't beat the final boss yet, although I could beat now if I wanted but I am doing sidequest and challenges) and Smash Bros Ultimate.
---
If you‚Äôve played hardcore wow and don‚Äôt mind garrisons (I did, it why I quit) or Azerite or the constant artifact grind....wow has gotten consistently better.
---
The only bad thing you can say about real raiding (hardmode, heroic, mythic) is that you sometimes go for 12 months without a new one. If you‚Äôve been raiding at the upper levels, it really only went considerably down in difficulty and fun during the first tier of Wrath. 
---
Dungeons, outside of Wrath have been difficult and interesting for at least those first two weeks of an expansion when they matter to real players. 
---
We‚Äôve been able to transition more and more out of raid prep time into more in raid time through less consumables and objectively harder bosses. If you actually like progression raiding, this is a great thing. If you enjoy the grind, I can appreciate the frustration, but I‚Äôd argue far more people would rather more hours wiping on a boss vs more hours grinding fire water. (If I‚Äôm spending 5 hours grinding 5 hours progressing vs 1 hour grinding 9 hours progressing...I‚Äôm all in)
---
His aggro works by attacking whoever is closest to him. Your mt could be autoattacking while everyone else is going ham and its impossible for him to attack anyone else
---
Lmao get off this subreddit. This is the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever heard. It‚Äôs not an opinion, it won‚Äôt affect you in the fucking slightest bit if you play on any streamers server.
---
WHEN GOD! When‚Äôs it gonna be MY turn!
---
Ding ding ding
---
If blizzard thinks it will cost them money if they don't offer them, I assure you it will happen.
---
Shockadin
---
Lol, yeah dude I just don't get it. Right now I treat twitch chat like a minigame where I try and decipher what things mean like gachiBASS and monkaS and monkaW. Other times I just turn that shit off because it's annoying. The classic streamers so far, like Esfand and Staysafe, have been pretty enjoyable just cause they're knowledgeable and I'm learning different things while watching them.
---
Server queue on a game that's not installed? Impressive.
---
Okay that‚Äôs just not possible
---
Addons aren't optional. If an addon gives a significant advantage (AH addons etc.) you simply can't compete without them and you are forced to use them.
---
The druid forms do not change with hair color.
---
That feature was added in Cata IIRC.
---
Again, the most toxic people, are the ones against it.
---
Most pets are at 2.0 AS but there's plenty of them at speeds between 1.0 and 2.0, and Broken Tooth isn't the only one at 1.0 (though it's the only cat).
---
Yeah it‚Äôs bonkers. Sadly they can never really excel in any field even if pushed to the absolute limits, but they can catch people off guard and basically do everything if done properly. Super cool
---
*moves priest up a few spots on list of possible mains*
---
You know what I find funny, and cringey is you still responding and caring about the fact that I deleted a previous comment when I have claimed I deleted my comment.. lol dude get off my dick and get a life... it‚Äôs only Reddit man, you‚Äôre not that important, I know I‚Äôm not
---
Per Blizzard:
---
You will not need to buy a copy. You just need to subscribe for the monthly fee.
---
You do not need to own the latest expansions, or any expansions. You could make a new starter account, pay for a subscription and you would have access.
---
If you have an existing or old account you will just need to log in to your account, pay for subscription, and you would have access.
---
The release date is currently set for August 27, 2019.
---
The following is my unsolicited advice:
---
If it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve played, you may want to go to Blizzard‚Äôs website when you have some free time to ensure you can still log in to your old account. Battle.net and Blizzard have changed a lot of the ways that accounts work for WoW and Battle.net.
---
Also along those lines, recovering accounts access is never fun and can be time consuming.
---
This will actually be entertaining
---
I think it was an hour, and you need 3 more people to summon it, and one dies always.  Kind of a pain in the ass to use it on lowbies
---
The quest to get the doomguard sucked also. 
---
The infernal was pretty fun for that though.
---
Why do they act like their less than half their ages? Why do people pay them for this?
---
You really dont see the irony in this, huh?
---
Good luck.
---
Wow. This one's definitely in the running for the most ridiculous comment ive seen today
---
Better link:  https://clips.twitch.tv/LazyBraveClintResidentSleeper
---
Interesting mechanic. I would assume that creates a situation where you have a "rag" set of gear as you don't even need hit.
---
Well there it is, the stupidest post today
---
Ahh okay. So which of those forms in the picture would be the classic advanced graphics form?
---
Yes, completely viable. Better even.
---
I was arcane power fire until MC raids. The few mobs with fire resistance or immunity don't matter as you will have a frostbolt on your action bar anyway and the group won't suffer for it.
---
Sure thing! More options to look at are great. Post it when you have time :D
---
Ravencrest EU?
---
Ok thanks, so its not bad at 1v1's and can potenitally if needed do 1vx's? If so then I know what I'll play if we go alliance lol
---
Casters can literally do it naked as its impossible for them to take damage without failing a mechanic. He has some melee splash stuff tho
---
Look elsewhere in this thread I did a long write up =P
---
At least I‚Äôm not so fucking stupid that I have to make a reddit post bcuz u can‚Äôt read rogue talents.
---
Seriously I hope this is an act bcuz surely u can‚Äôt be so ducking retarded
---
What level of spell damage did you have to reach 1200 crits with holy shock?
---
This is specifically so they can ignore them. I like streamers and watch them. I also don't want to be in a server effected by them.
---
What's wrong with pserver players? The reason streamers are bad aren't because of a little toxicity, or because some of them are good. It's because of their cult following that will on the drop of a dime camp anyone who wpvp kills a streamer, or fuck up the economy. Not to mention all the world firsts will be cheated basically because hardcore stream supporters will literally play all day and just give everything they made to the streamer, along with streamers getting every piece of loot that drops.
---
Everyone that posts a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking my time‚Äù has a speed leveling guide favorited on their browser of choice they will follow religiously... there are the players who will minmax and those that lie about not doing it.
---
Oh man, that guy with the Onyxia buff.
---
Ill even go as to say his stream is repetitive, negative and whiny
---
He is always complaining about everything, even parries and dodges
---
Contradicting himself out of the wazoo, one day WOTLK was an amazing expansion the other day it was dog shit
---
I'm pretty sure he will, even if only for a few days. It's gonna be THE GAME, everyone will be streaming it and im sure it will hit #1 on twitch. He won't be out of the classic fever.
---
We just posting foot fetish porn now?
---
99% of guilds will not allow you to be one of the primary 2 tanks as feral. One of the off tanks sure, but never primary.
---
&gt; Which faction is best for / benefits the most from Feral tanks?
---
You can choose between Night Elf or Tauren. 
---
Night elves will get 1% chance to dodge, which is OK. 
---
Tauren get 5% total health, which is really solid. 
---
Druid tanking has a couple of negatives going for it though. The only tanking "stats" you have working for you are as follows:
---
Armor.
---
A large health pool (larger than most tanking classes actually).
---
Dodge.
---
You cannot parry, you cannot block with a shield (because you can't take one). This is actually a big problem because bosses can do what's called, [Crushing Blows.](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Crushing_blow)
---
Your high health pool and typically high chance to dodge can help to mitigate this somewhat, but overall you are at a handicap. 
---
Which means that you may not be able to tank high in raids. Add in your inexperience as a feral tank (and tank in general?), you may not find a willing guild.
---
This is so damn cringy
---
QQ
---
Most pro‚Äôs use a 2 button mouse.
---
do you have any substantive points or are you just gonna keep calling him "racist" without any argument
---
lol
---
I watched his stream for like a week trying to figure out how a neckbeard in pajamas rakes in probably close to a million dollars a year.
---
Wow... I don't even want the tiniest chance of having to deal with this
---
But could Joana go faster with an owl?
---
We don‚Äôt know, it probably hasn‚Äôt been done. Also, an extreme case, such as that of a speed leveler, should not be the standard used to judge all cases. That‚Äôs an outlier.
---
I was running Halbeard of Smiting when i was ranking, the pole arm from ZG it was lowkey OP, it had a decipatate proc, that could crit for 3.5k which could proc off a Mortal Strike crit if it did that you would 1 shot Druids in travelform and 2 shot everyone else, after a while if you had no procs you knew in the next few hits you were gonna get a proc or double proc and could go for crazy beserker buff/recklessness i shot kills, it must have triggered many people as id regularly delete people :) and probably got me known in pvp as id get invited back a lot :)
---
Thanks for the context! For clarification, is this from the perspective of a Prot-specced MT or a Fury-specced MT that holds threat with more damage? Or does this apply to both situations?
---
everyone just hating for the sake of hating and cant understand that streamers just fuck around 90% of the time... kind of hard to believe that most of these people are older than 25. its kind of sad tbh. if you dont want to be with a streamer, then dont go on their server. simple as that.
---
I'll search for it later then. Reddit's threat search is sometimes really dumb :)
---
It's going to be real hard in terms of time. In addition to leveling both and raiding twice as much to gear them, you'll be farming to afford twice the consumables, twice the repair bills, twice the mounts, etc.
---
If you want to be flexible I would consider warrior or druid. Warriors can DPS and offtank (with less responsibility than MT) in fury spec as long as you keep the proper gear in your bags. Druids can as well, in addition to healing, although be warned that many players consider anything but resto a "meme spec" despite the performance potential.
---
I guess thats true, but most wPvP i see just seems to be 1v1's and some smaller skirmishes.
---
The advance graphics for Classic only improve some world textures like shrubs and water. 
---
It does not change models in the game. 
---
[This is what you will look like.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/4/43/Druidcat.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20051020135347)
---
They all look different? Really?
---
Really great post. 
---
As a side note, has anyone done anything similar for priests to the same quality as this post?
---
Gotcha! I failed to specify that I meant a main tank would probably have a set of gear specifically tailored for that fight, as being able to ignore threat allows you to more heavily itemize towards mitigation instead of trying to keep a balance with threat. I never played vanilla, but greatly enjoy the theorycrafting aspect.
---
There's nothing wrong with trying to maximize the performance of your class
---
*FEET*
---
That's a sad demographic for gamers that I honestly don't believe is true now a days. I'm pretty massive muscle wise and have been since high school, little fat, and been gaming since I was probably around 8. My brother is similar as well, and I've met many people that also don't look like your stereotypical gamer.
---
Depends on what you mean by best.
---
For pvp, yeah Brokentooth and the bats from ZG are best for their 1.0 attack speed to interrupt casters (although Brokentooth is way better because it can learn Claw and Prowl).
---
Cats and Raptors have the best overall dps because of their 10% increased damage (attack speed doesn't really matter in PvE because the damage is normalized so they all do the same dps I'm pretty sure).
---
Wind Serpents are actually better in some fights where your pet will die too easily in melee range because they can spam Lightning Breath 
---
Wolves can cast Furious Howl, which a lot of times ends up being more dps overall for the entire raid, even though your pet itself does less damage.
---
Carrion Birds and Owls are arguably the best AoE tanking pets when soloing because Screech causes AoE threat and can be spammed (Bats also fill this role, but again they can't learn Claw, so slightly not as good).
---
Almost all of the best are good, they're just good at different things.
---
../s?
---
.... So that's why I kept finding night elfs nearby.....
---
EU servers will be the best as usual
---
With the most skilled players as usual
---
Naw.  Kilrogg, US.
---
Here is the sauce: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics
---
I believe I saw a smaller survey some time ago with similar responses but unfortunately I can't find.
---
Do you have one?
---
Buffing them to make them happy and then immediately sending them off a cliff?
---
You have lots of fun, don't you?
---
The amount of money required to enforce is greater than the amount of money they'll lose from people who say "I'm not playing WoW Classic unless there are streamer-banned servers" by such a large factor, it's laughable that you think this will ever happen.
---
It's a cute name for a bank alt.
---
&gt;_&gt;
---
Just filter out ‚Äú1.13‚Äù, since most people talking post Naxx don‚Äôt realize that Classic is 1.13 and not 1.12.
---
Only the best.
---
Obsidian Edged Blade. OEB is typically a weapon warriors upgrade to from Ice Barbed Spear (another badass weapon for 51 through 60) and is such a huge jump in dps with really choice stats. Originally the graphic was really lame but after being redesigned it looked like one of the most badass 2h swords you could get in early raiding.
---
I remember they had some terrible loose boob animations.
---
I don't disagree.  I was more pointing out that the BETA players have and will continue to have a completely unique experience and a completely unique set of Meta tiers that we won't get to experience.  Good or bad, they are getting it.
---
Make a bank alt. Just create the character. Don't even run it to town at first, but start sending it stuff early. Crafting materials, anything useful for quests, anything you 'shouldn't' vendor. Also send it about 50s-1g and whatever extra bags you end up with. Then when you're mid-range in levels hop on it and level it to 5, then go to a major city. At the major city, learn enchanting on it and park it at the bank. Grab stuff out of mailbox and organize it if you want. When you decide to start leveling professions on your main, or just need a character to disenchant higher level crap BoE stuff, there's your dude. Also a good stock piler of cloth.
---
And one other note: You don't need tons of bag space on a bank alt. The mailbox is the 'bank space' and stuff stays in the mail for 30 days before getting sent back. (After resending to sender +  another 30 days it's deleted iirc)
---
Oh... I thought the option was specifically for player models T_T
---
I called him racist once. I have no interest in engaging or arguing with someone who doesn't see why that particular bit of the post is racist.
---
Oh yeah. The main bottle neck is fire resistance for the MT. Cutting edge guilds in the first week will be farming Fr gear nonstop. The rest of the raid needs major fr potions to make up for their lack of gear
---
Two hand Fury is good too. The issue with Arms is that Deep wounds and Mortal Strike take up Debuff slot. Although I do ‚Äúthink‚Äù that they‚Äôre starting with the max debuff slots available so it‚Äôs not as big of a deal.
---
No that's not going to happen. You can do 20mans but you won't be invited to 40mans because mortal strike is a wasted debuff. Respec like everyone else.
---
He's got a snatch of doom!
---
What if the streamers get word of this and separate; one to each server?
---
Don't you mean  [http://www.leagueofpirates.com/sirvival/queuedance.html](http://www.leagueofpirates.com/sirvival/queuedance.html)  ?
---
But we will have 16 debuff slots on launch no?
---
Much appreciated, I don't hate streamers, but I don't exactly want to run into them and their horde of ravenous fans either.
---
At this point, we might need a new sub reddit to avoid the people spam posting about avoiding streamers. We get it.
---
I updated my battleststion!
---
Thats it the exact one TY, i loved this script :)
---
That type of energy aint what weed gets you man lol!
---
Yeah I thought about this, if we get 16 should be okay
---
Can someone explain why so many people hate the streamers? I've only seen a handful of clips from a few of them but they seem to be alright.
---
At this point, I would want to avoid all the people who cry on this subreddit about streamers
---
Can I like totally steal this for my phone background?
---
No that's silly, why would you need to differentiate between dungeons that are 30 levels apart
---
The battlegrounds were originally capped at 20, 30, 40, etc. It was changed because those are the levels where players generally get really powerful stuff, imagine being the only person with a mount in a 31-40 AB.
---
You also cannot parry attacks, even though other NPC beasts can!
---
The game is as faithful a recreation of patch 1.12 as possible. Which means we'll have the zerg version of Alterac Valley, not the good one.
---
By weird drama do you mean the weird drama on this sub reddit right now being created by all the complaining about streamers?
---
You cannot talk to anyone while shapeshifted.
---
Short versions:
---
Yes it's coming back, in the state of 1.12 talents and balance. The itemization will be so the gear has 1.12 stats, but the gear is available as it was in vanilla. 
---
will it be just as difficult? Probably not, proper internet, high FPS, more knowledge from the get go will make raiding feel a lot easier than it did back then.
---
Original AV? Unfortunately not, only the 1.12 version of AV which had less defense than the earlier versions. A battle can still last a day, if people don't take them very seriously.
---
And people still don't want you to waste one of them to do subpar dps.
---
Lol that‚Äôs why when I first heard that I thought they were trolling. I thought surely they can‚Äôt be that unselfaware to do that to a Starcraft FPS a second time. Looks like I was wrong, they have no self-awareness whatsoever
---
How much would it cost to have one person checking tickets submitted on each non streaming server.  So say 3 or 4 people, doesnt seem that high to me.
---
Even with 16 you won‚Äôt waste a debuff slot on mortal strike.
---
Even with 16, there's no room for Mortal Strike.
---
Ya I know a lot of people like to think wealthy people just got lucky because ego etc but in reality the vast majority of people at the top of any profession got there for other reasons
---
Guess I‚Äôll respect, thanks for clearing it up
---
16 de-buff slots to be shared by 40 people.
---
the issue with his server is that he will leave classic quickly, as will his fans
---
that was painfully delicious
---
Easiest class in WoW, One of the hardest to master.
---
I doubt it.
---
Lol the OSRS community is the total opposite of this sort of mentality. That's why they're playing OSRS and not currently rs, and that's why we're here and not playing retail wow
---
I will never understand the weird stalker fans who follow streamers around all the time. I get watching their content but that stuff is just creepy.
---
&gt; WoW always lacked a support rol
---
u/NAP51DMustang covered paladins, I'll hit the Horde side.
---
Ever heard of Shamans?
---
Totem twisting Windfury totem and Grace of Air totem to buff the warriors or Rogues, Strength of Earth totem to buff the melee, Fire Resistance totem for MC or Frost Resistance totem for Naxx, Healing stream passively healing the group or mana spring to give mana back to the healers or caster DPS, Stoneskin totem if you need to help out the tank, Tremor totem to beat those pesky fears, I'd say that's a pretty good start for a valid support.
---
WotF makes you immune for 5 seconds too.
---
oh my god. that was hilarious
---
Holy Paladins are arguably the MOST mana efficient class in the game. In classic their buffs can be 15 minutes which really reduces how much time you spend buffing.
---
Being already better than other healers (except paladin ofc)
---
Thank you!
---
My user history would do it too I haven't done any other posting today other than this thread =P
---
Ya know now that I think about it, can I just get my own server Blizz? I wanna avoid everyone.
---
Thank you for the lengthy reply but I disagree with you in a lot of your points. At 40 it‚Äôs a good idea to go prot and aoe grind, getting even better at 51 with consecration. Also, best healer for pvp but also ret can do some pretty good stuff in pvp with engineering at least.
---
I see you too think like my mother. Thank you.
---
all names will be taken!
---
It will be WEEKS of PvPing before you gear up with Armor from PvP and that's AFTER Phase 2 drops.
---
You'll need some dungeon/raid gear to be competitive.
---
A lot of people here consume their content, but it's the potential of how much they are going to disrupt the realm they are on. [Here is a video to explain further.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)
---
If it's truly that easy then why don't you go do it?  Because your 8-6 is what's normal and safe right?  He found a way to make money doing what he enjoys while you're likely spending those 40+ hours a week doing something you don't care about.  
---
I'm not a fan of his either, but this argument is just silly.
---
You have to share 16 debuffs between the entire raid and it would be an almost total waste of 2 of them to bring an arms warrior.
---
Let me throw my hat in the ring for this. I had plans for RPPVP since I heard classic was coming out. Pretty bummed that it's not gonna be a option
---
No. There are no plans to use the updated models for Classic. 
---
Although...I am sure that someone will come up with a way to swap out the old models with the new ones. 
---
Players have been doing things like that for years. Back in The Burning Crusade, players would augment the game files to swap out models for "larger models" so that they become easier to spot. 
---
More recently with BfA, some players were using augmented models for their characters. Although I think it was more on the lewd side of it if you catch my meaning.
---
And of course, any changes to the game files will be a bannable offense. So continue at your own risk if that option does become available.
---
I am someone who loves the world PvP element to the game, and disagree entirely.  My favorite part of world PvP isn't the grand battles and organized events, it's that it adds very unique human interactions throughout your entire time in Azeroth. See a horde player when you are on Alliance? You can let them go, and be a nice person. They could just as easily not be a nice person, and kill you because they wanted to. Interaction with another person becomes a lot more meaningful when both of you have the option to be hostile or not. On a PvE realm, everyone is forced to be nice to each other, and it's a lot less exciting. It's the choice that makes interactions interesting.
---
where‚Äôs the pic?
---
fixed sorry, i am usually a lurker dont do much posting.
---
Most of that shit convert to emotes once you get the proper addons. That's why you don't understand it.
---
Yes, it was in Cata.
---
I hate to break it to you but most wealthy people are just lucky. It's not like unsuccessful people are inherently less skilled or driven. People like sodapoppin wouldnt be able to hack it in a real job, because he has no real skills. All he is equipped to do in life is beg for money from strangers and cry when he gets ganked or ninja looted. Again, hate to be the bearer of bad news, but success in streaming is definitely mostly luck.
---
&gt; But could Joana go faster with an owl?
---
I doubt it. Joana did a huge ton of research on leveling, memorized exactly where to go, what to do etc. I doubt he would make a simple mistake like choose the wrong leveling pet.
---
He has an FAQ, he uses bandages to heal his pet to save mana, and heals more HP.
---
He even does stuff like manually casts growl so the pet has more focus for attacks.
---
Not sure where pros come into play, but neat
---
Uhm, are you sure about that?
---
I definitely died a few times summoning one lol
---
Ohh yeah I definitely browsed /r/wow when the bans went out for those for all the memes. 
---
Thank you for all the information! For some reason I couldn't find much besides speculation - so I appreciate it :)
---
Not until AQ, which will be years from now depending on how long the phases are, unless they change where the tomes drop.
---
Right.
---
because every attempt at reviving world PvP was a great success on retail, and world PvP is also going extremely well on pservers.
---
Clearly, all the evidence we have right now point toward BGs being ghosttown and world PvP trives especially once the level'ing ends...
---
If you spend a week leveling and find out you‚Äôre on a server that you hate you can always just drop $25 or whatever on a realm transfer. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs the end of the world.
---
World pvp is inherently fun. I participate because I enjoy it, not because I will get an award for participating. If you need a reward to enjoy something I hear retail does that in spades
---
Forced boring cookie cutter quests and a grind fest?  Sounds like vanilla.  Nice try though
---
and why wouldn't BG give any reward?
---
&gt;Am I missing something here?
---
Damage was normalized.
---
Broken tooth is not a damage pet.
---
Broken tooth is an anti-caster PVP pet.
---
1 sec attack speed = spell push back.
---
Faster push back = an edge in PVP.
---
You only need to cast drainsoul at the last second that shouldn't have any significant effect on your dps.
---
Well to be fair, you can't blame the honorgrind on them. At least not on Nostalrius. It's true that they had a few in the "mafia", but having such a cartel is against Blizzard TOS isn't it?
---
You can do it. You‚Äôll just be gimping yourself
---
All the time!
---
It‚Äôs like a cult.
---
I mean most players are bad or have bad specs becaude they dont know so why not you?  Do what makes you happy.
---
Noone can hurt him financially he has been on the top for too long. All you can do is annoy him and make him suffer in game.
---
To be honest  I don't think you need to play the OPTIMAL builds to be able to clear raids, if you're a try hard guild an wanting to be top 2-3 then yeah you probably need to focus on the optimal builds. Everyone else can pretty much play what they want IMO. The problem is I feel like casual guilds/people are influences by the top 1% of players and the "meta" style of gameplay is ingrained in gaming as a culture. So you may find that even casual guilds want to recruit people that are doing "meta" builds because its the thing to do, which I hope isnt the case.
---
If you like a paladin, play a paladin. It's honestly that simple.
---
If you grind your way to 60 it‚Äôs possible to get close, especially with professions like OP said. Mattering what world grinding farms that will be available you can make a good amount of raw gold by just censoring everything. And if tailoring can make bags and sell them for more money. 
---
Yes I know values are different on private servers, but I was in the first 25 to hit 60 on a fresh server, I was 225~ alchemy, 300 skinning, did a lot of world mob grinding and hit 60 with around 500 gold. 
---
If you spent more time on professions and played the auction house on the way there, 400g is definitely achievable by the time you hit 60, especially if you aren‚Äôt rushing.
---
&gt; and monkaS and monkaW
---
just when i thought i had it figured it out with monkaS here comes monkaW!
---
oh, you win this time twitch chat, but i'll be back...
---
Both of them said unfounded shit yet you call out the guy who says wont happen.   
---
People are just assuming but youre riding the circle jerk
---
You need 5 people to watch streams and/or deal with tickets 24/7 without asking for overtime. We won't consider any management here, even though we should.
---
The base pay for a Blizzard GM is $13/hour, but anyone that's ever employed someone knows this is only about half of what an employee actually costs, especially on the West Coast, so let's call it $20/hour. That's $41,600 per year, per stream-watcher, or $208,000 per year total.
---
Vanilla WoW had about 500 realms and it cost Blizzard $200 million over 4 years just in upkeep, so that's $100,000 a year per realm. We're not adjusting for inflation here, even though we should.
---
In order to make $308,000 per year, one server would need ~1700 to ~2000 players paying each month.
---
You're not going to find 2000 people that agree with you.
---
It's going to kinda be a gamble with early name selection but I just want to land on a high pop east coast server.
---
I think night is of looks better in all the gear you could get in vanilla.  In my case, since I'll likely roll resto for majority of content, I am not going tauren to be in the cloth gear that's gowns and robes.  
---
Fashion is everyone in my wow experience
---
Looks to me like you‚Äôre just a care bear if you think these replies are toxic enough for you to complain about it lol. Your idea of a streamer free server is never going to happen m8.
---
aaah yes, that mysterious server where people didn't do BG despite time providing a fair ground and  many more times the honor...
---
2 bored guys ganking in redridge or while a thousand are doing BGs isn't ''reduce world PvP quite a bit''.. it's ''shrink to nothingness''
---
The fact that you said it won‚Äôt affect anyone for playing in a streamers server shows how ignorant you are lmao
---
Most prot tanks can get deep wounds if they cant go fury prot yet
---
Curious to know if deep wounds would stay up
---
Lol I‚Äôm definitely guilty of that, but then I realized that kind of leveling isn‚Äôt what made classic great. We didn‚Äôt have easy access to guides and tips back in the day we just fucked around. I‚Äôm just trying to remind everyone that that‚Äôs one of the big things that made the game so much fun.
---
Same. I'm going to be avoiding Streamers, period. I like Esfand, but I'm not going to be an accessory to whatever shenanigans he and his streamer gang go up to. I just want to finally do Molten Core in a mix of blues and greens and come out downing Gehennas feeling like a Demi-God again.
---
Honestly warrior shammy Druid rogue and priest would be the most fun, how much is that one?
---
Am I sure all the original Vanilla servers still exist today? Yes, [you can check yourself](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status).
---
Am I sure that Blizzard won't do something like "Mannoroth-Retail" and "Mannoroth-Classic"? No, but the logistical nightmare of that means it makes sense they won't.
---
bookmarked this site
---
You‚Äôre right! Blizz should just make servers have a player cap of 1 so we don‚Äôt have to worry about streamers, private server players, multiboxers or toxic redditors.
---
"It's beta blizzard will fix it."
---
Just, you know, ironically.
---
Just a wild guess... but the odds of having a 'fair' encounter in WPvP  , as in same number / level of people involved on both side... is about as close to 0 as possible... and even when you are on the winning side ( aka one of the many, many servers where one faction dominated the other), the exercice get quite boring.
---
BG provide a fairer ground where skill can shine more than numbers. It seems logical that the biggest PvP action take place there.
---
I would totally play with Crendor.
---
id play with sequisha or madseason
---
i just dont wanna play with the 13 year old armies
---
Why does he still have an experience bar showing 200+K xp to next level ?
---
Streamers arent new to wow
---
Cow horse mixture. As my father, and his father before him. We are horses, of the cow variety
---
The rewards are the experience and enjoyment you get. Me and a friend fought off a player a handful of levels higher than us who kept trying to gank us while we were leveling. He killed us a few, we killed him more. It made the experience of leveling that night way more enjoyable even though it slowed us down. This isn‚Äôt a job where I‚Äôm trying to be as efficient as possible.
---
That's the plan here.
---
Nah people that blindly follow streamers like a cult are pretty dumb, you can typically get a lot past them without them knowing. 
---
They will probably be posting in chat every day saying ‚ÄúHey I bought your auction, be my friend!!‚Äù
---
That actually seems like the most daunting thing for me. I have my action bar set up just right in retail, but idk how I'm going to do it Classic with so many different ranks of spells.
---
&gt; It's not like unsuccessful people are inherently less skilled or driven
---
Um.. That's actually precisely the case. You actually don't think the upper tiers of income have higher IQ on average and work longer hours...? You know despite your wild assumptions the actual data suggests you're as wrong as you can possibly be. But anyway, sure, you keep believing that working your ass off and being smart won't lead to wealth.
---
Transfer won't be available at the beginning. Also transfer is a bad thing for the community aspect.
---
I agree, but it‚Äôs usually avoided if at all possible. You‚Äôd rather have much better debuffs, as deep wounds can push off a better debuff
---
I said earlier that the server self polices, absolutely no one from blizz has to monitor streams.  They only need the one person per server to check the links submitted via ticket.  
---
Considering classic size servers, 3k pop, and people knowing they are on a no stream server, and the server is only self policed, the one person already answering tickets can easily handle what little extra there is.
---
TBC already announced
---
First of all, hardcore min/maxing is only a small portion of private server players. They are just vocal on this sub because they are the most invested.   
---
Second, don't hate the player, hate the game.  Have you considered that this game sort of breeds hardcore mentality? You play once on a private server casually. Then you see that you never even get to look at a world boss because more hardcore players kill it as soon as it spawns. You can't play with these players because you are a ret paladin.  Rank 14 gear is so powerful and necessitates a hardcore playstyle. Gold is needed for so many things and to monopolize black lotus spawns you need to be try hard. Literally everything good comes at the price of a grind.  All these people hating on private server min/maxers now are going to either die and quit the game as casuals , or live long enough to become the min/maxer they hate.   
---
There's literally like 7 bosses you will never even see, never mind kill, if you don't try hard.
---
Yeah, Rogues don't even get to use Rupture, which after reaching a certain Attack Power threshold, is the highest DPS finisher they have.
---
But you don't have to respec necessarily. Going Arms in a raid is detrimental to the team, but in 40-man content, only about 25 need to be paying attention. Your Mortal Strike debuff is low priority, it'll get knocked off.
---
The reason you don't want to be Arms in a raid is because you're gimping yourself. If anything goes wrong in the raid, the first people to blame are the ones not pulling their weight.
---
But if it's farm content everyone watches YouTube through? Do what you want.
---
Aside from the early sign up, at launch you'll be able to go around and name a placeholder on any or every server until you hit character cap. Then wait it out.
---
Or maybe people just don't want to recruit players that intentionally gimp themselves because they "want to play big arms 2hand!!!" and actually just want a smooth raiding experience?
---
It was. Your bar showed to the next level until you relogged or reloaded ui
---
No he was added in patch 7.1
---
Nice.
---
Self-policing would never work and it only adds MORE time to the job, not less.
---
Looks dope man, I love the look of the classic mismatched armor
---
well we get the one forged from onyxia and it becomes the sword we know, so unfortunatly that one is same for all of us but if more existed then yeah they would.
---
Man I remember camping bt for weeks in vanilla... felt amazing when I finally got him tamed... lol still have in my stables. =)
---
??
---
What is it that you have to grind?
---
you're extremely classist jfc
---
Ill have to actually look into the priorities tonight
---
All items available in 1.12 will be available.
---
All keys required in 1.12 will be required. This won't change. From the beginning got both.
---
that makes sense.
---
Explain how it wouldnt work.  It seems quite simple to me.
---
I miss Alamo!  He also taught me about the burnin cruisaide!  Seal form is for frens!
---
There are dozens of us blizzard dozens
---
Then hope you aren‚Äôt rolling where they are.
---
Man titan panel is super ugly haha
---
When people cant debate and can only spew vulgarities, yes I consider that toxic.
---
yeah was a mix between rank 7 or 8 gear with bwl and AQ with dragon mace lol even had the Ony offhand book to summon a skeleton lol. There was no set as such for feral druids back then, Rogues would get pissy lol
---
Attack speed didn't happen in 1.9. Read the patch notes you just linked.
---
This is *movement* speed.
---
&gt; Base pet speed is now standardized for all pets, including legacy pets. Pet speed can still be modified through the talent Bestial Swiftness and pet abilities such as Charge, Dash, etc.
---
This fixes Lupos doing Shadow damage.
---
&gt; All hunter pets will now always deal Physical damage for their base attack.
---
Because you have raid gear?
---
all items available in 1.12 will not be available
---
Not going human is fine for rogues because you can always play as  dagger in raids. I honestly don't like daggers in raids, it's less spells with backstab and you don't get to use evisrate much, but if you don't mind dagger spec, then going gnome is just fine.
---
Maybe let me know what you find out, I‚Äôm curious too!
---
Whoa, slow down there funny mcfunnerson.
---
You think getting 40 people to do anything in unison is in any way "smooth"?
---
We'll find out when classic comes out, private servers may not be accurate in raids.  At least for the MC and Only, arms warrior DPS is fine, which is all we'll be dealing at launch.
---
All of them are irrelevant bro...
---
Isnt his chat in sub only mode like 90% of his stream?
---
You will need a healbot friend if your focus will be pvp.
---
Early on , levels. Then prebis gear, gold for some of the BiS gear depending on class, if you really want to be the best you will want to be grinding AB/WSG/AV reputation for some BiS gear. There are other rep grinds you can do. Max out your engineering, pvp rank, farm Ironfoe, Cenarion Field Missions,  there is literally endless things to grind in vanilla.  
---
Essentially, if you want to kill world bosses, you will need to be in the top guild on your server or one of them. Because these guilds will be killing the bosses as soon as the spawn, on cooldown. Having the best gear will allow them to control the kills and beat the weaker guilds that pvp them for the boss. In order to be in the top guilds, you need to be a top player.  You will compete with people that play this game all day.
---
.. 'lol actually no they wont all be cus the raids haven't all been unlocked yet"
---
he was talking about professions
---
Dont waste your breath, its just a shitpost
---
Ignore this brainlet. All he does is post and shit on p servers while knowing nothing about the game.
---
Yes.
---
It‚Äôs going well 1v1, also you can heal bgs and raids without trouble
---
U have with engineering 3 stuns, BoP, Bubble, Cleanse, Freedom, LoH and enough heal...
---
If u get a good 2h weap it‚Äôs gg
---
Gearing is also more ez as an full ret because you need spellpower and go also for some healing offparts
---
Xiao‚Äôs Hope
---
Which private server guilds? Or you guys keeping it hushed for now
---
I am curious, how long does it usually take to paint 1 of those minis?
---
So being swords as gnome would end up being frowned upon? That's shitty I'm not a fan of daggers either lol
---
This is great! Well done!
---
Time to rain hell.
---
This is already confirmed to be needed from pservers. No rek bombs
---
Even if you do consider vanilla bosses to be like that, it isn't just about the boss kill. It's the fun of playing with 39 others, the camaraderie, the journey, going the distance of the raid, making friends, nostalgia (if you have it), etc etc
---
sure bosses that have complex multi tiered mechanics and differen't phases and whatever else gets your boss-rocks off, but blowing through them on all 69 of the "difficulty levels" besides the ULTRA-EPIC MYTHIC ++ SUPREME "difficulty level", having 4 trash mobs between bosses, auto-queue with 9 or 14 or 24 others or whatever the count is now, etc etc is less fun to me.
---
I kind of assumed there would be a separate login for classic. So you could run a retail and classic client at the same time. That would keep the list of server names from getting mixed up.
---
And like OP mentioned there are no Owls for a long time as Horde. Why waste time as a Horde to go out of your way to get an owl when you can just get a cat early on and buff the crap out of it?
---
Nah, that's another nonsensical cop out people use for being lazy. Again, the data doesn't support any of this garbage. The data suggests working your ass off pays off, that's it. It doesn't matter who does it.
---
That will definitely be more of a challenge to do yes
---
Player A uploads unedited video to YouTube after the fact.
---
Player B downloads that video, uploads it to Twitch, then sends an in-game report.
---
3-5 days later, the ONE GM responsible for handling these reports finally gets to this one. They click the twitch link, verify the character in the video is the correct one, and issue a ban.
---
Now you've got Player A making furious Blizzard Customer Support tickets, disputing the ban, which costs Blizzard even more money.
---
The only way a streamer-banned realm would work is if Blizzard actively watched all the streams for World of Warcraft classic themselves round the clock and manually verified that each one wasn't on this particular realm. This would take an entire team of people, not just one.
---
It will never happen.
---
You can play combat dagger if you like also
---
I loved the auction house. Sold a couple items for more than I think they were worth. Felt so good.
---
That's a meme
---
I mean yeah? I've raided on pserver for 4 years now mostly been fairly smooth.
---
But either way, adding extra shit like an arms warrior to deal with isn't a good way to deal with the issues there already is.
---
this
---
Absolutely no Aussie servers have been announced üò∞
---
Loot bug, just being forever crouched not being able to loot anything.
---
Lol, well that sums him up as a person. A 5 minute video. I'm kidding, I get it. Streamers get advantages. That's nothing to lose sleep over.
---
It‚Äôs $36/year and imo is by far the best multiboxing software. 
---
As someone that‚Äôs spent literally hundreds of hours theory crafting multiboxing for classic (mostly for 40 boxing raids) I‚Äôd recommend stacking classes with simple dps rotations. 
---
Mage is by far the best class to stack since they have the best aoe in the game, they have a single button dps rotation and the more mages you have the more damage they each will do. 
---
If you bring all those classes, doing anywhere near optimal dps will be almost impossible since you have to manage too many things at once.
---
Is battle groups going to be a thing in Classic? I hope not.
---
gang gang?
---
You have to speak the guttural utterings that constitute Dutch though, so that's a minus.
---
!RemindMe 67 days
---
Thats what i thought but i saw a blue post how some craftables/quests won't be in the game at launch and will be pushed around for balance purposes.
---
Has blizzard said that it won‚Äôt be available at the beginning? I don‚Äôt recall seeing that anywhere.
---
It would keep the realm names from getting mixed up for YOU, but not for Blizzard.
---
It‚Äôll def lower your dps if you run swords as a gnome
---
Hunter all the way
---
I wouldnt be surprised if BFA makes just as much money for Blizzard, if not more, compared to WotLK when sub numbers were the highest, despite BFA having 10-20% of the subs that WotLK had due to the cash shop and WoW tokens. Sub count is an insanely inaccurate metric when it comes to modern day games, BFA included, so your argument is totally baseless. The business models of most popular video games have changed greatly from 15 years ago, and based on the numbers I've seen from different games, I'd wager that subs make up AT MOST 5-10% of Blizzard's total revenue from WoW. Keep in mind that players buy game time for gold, and players buy gold with money.
---
Alright,  thanks for the heads up!
---
Blizzard needs to come up with a way to block streaming. Those of us that want to play classic because we enjoy the game, want to be able to do all the things with friends and guildies, not with fuckin' streamers.
---
&gt; if you can make it to 30, you might just go the distance.
---
damn I just realized, I wonder how many people played Vanilla or even TBC WoW and quit before they hit max level because of how long it takes to hit 60 and how long it takes to gear up/attune/farm money etc you do at max level? lol
---
2h arms is great. Ran arms all the way to 60 and I think it's the best way to go.
---
Wow man did everyone really play a warrior?? Most of these screenshots I see are of warriors...is there something I‚Äôm missing??
---
It may or may not happen, neither one if us know.  What I do know is if blizz thinks the demand is there and they think it will cost them money if they dont then you will see them.
---
yes they will be
---
My question wasnt with regard to leveling, but thanks for the input.
---
Sadly we don't have any good SimCraft tools to give you an actual, empirical comparison.
---
You will encounter some pushback because the raid's full on melee dps, and minor pushback by people insisting 2h &amp; arms are suboptimal. You can eventually find groups (especially since you can't inspect talents in classic so they don't automatically know you went arms...) but be warned
---
For sure, but as you say, there are portions of this game that necessitate try harding. They also happen to be some of the most rewarding and fun ( world bosses and the pvp/rivalry that ensues ). Yet people seem to think that is the fault of private servers. No, there will always be try hards in this game. Don't hate the player, hate the game.

I‚Äôm just ready to claim the GoT names
---
it wont get knocked off, this was changed in the 1.12 to High Prio, in vanilla it used to get knocked off because it was a Medium Prio
---
Thanks a lot for taking the time to do this. A lot of people will be happy to see this.
---
Man I did this exact same thing in tbc
---
So, something caused the blizzard servers to implode, and people were met with a 780minute server que for battle.net. In that downtime, I made this.
---
It doesn't matter how much money they'd lose if there's no feasible way to implement them that can't be abused or doesn't require an entire new department of employees.
---
Or you could just write it down...?
---
You pigeon hole yourself into daggers as non human. Any progression guild or better will prioritize humans for swords first. However you can do human daggers as well.
---
Damn. I like playing arms warrior.
---
!RemindMe 68 days
---
I'll have to take a look. Thanks!
---
Oh shit, good to know. Do you have an updated list of the 1.12 debuff priorities? All the ones I have must be incorrect.
---
This give me so much anxiety thinking about a clear that fast
---
Feral DPS druids have a very interesting rotation.
---
Bear druids are very simple.
---
Warrior tanks are much more complicated. Managing rage, using consumables (sappers etc), knowing when to dual wield, etc etc.
---
In general warrior is a very complex class, with druid coming in second for it's hybridness
---
Listen to your heart.
---
What about just putting ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù before each server name then. Like ‚ÄúClassic Skullcrusher‚Äù?
---
This is why I F5
---
i dont but most private servers should have the correct debuff prio. try google or youtube

The average American spends $3200 a year on entertainment. Globally, we will be spending 2.14 trillion a year on entertainment by 2020. If there weren't people making a living entertaining people in every single way possible, I would tell you that's an opportunity to make a successful business. 
---
These entrepenuers you're talking about take healthy markets and build brands that they use to command their own tribe of loyal customers. The marketing industry uses influencers in the gaming community to build strategies that work on our generation to make us spend more money on their non-gaming businesses. 
---
Hate them or misunderstand them all you want, but what they've done is brilliant, and to think they'll have any impact at all on your experience with Classic is probably just a symptom of how tiny the game appears right now with such a small closed beta. Unless you go looking for them, you've got nothing to worry about. 
---
But I bet if you did run across one of them in some fun community event they were facilitating, you would be genuinely intrigued and enjoy yourself until your prejudice caught up and made you remember you hate them for enjoying their work.
---
It needs about 4 full (trash included) Molten Core clears to get from nothing to honored. You also need 4 of those bosses alive to do the next step of the quest line (and if a boss is killed for you that is it for that week).
---
... that doesn't solve the problem I listed above.
---
Not necessarily frowned upon, but Human Rogues will get sword priority over you because of their racial. 
---
If you care about PvP at all, Gnome is better.
---
You didn‚Äôt understand my point. My point is that anyone would trade their job to do his, so I don‚Äôt care when he starts bitching and complaining. It‚Äôs just like when billionaires and CEOs complain about something, no one cares. There are millions of people who would take your spot in a hear beat, so we don‚Äôt want to listen to you bitch and complain.
---
More power to him for creating his hobby into a stream of income, I‚Äôm currently trying to do that for my hobbies, but I don‚Äôt sit there and complain about my problems. I find an issue and fix it in a reasonable way.
---
My mum used to call Scholomance Skolomanchay and Desolace Desolachay as if they were Italian
---
Honestly, I'm not surprised about the Wow community stereotypes at all. So many fat neckbeards complaining about irrelevant shit.
---
Battle group... There's a blast from the past.
---
Definitely don't miss those
---
Itemw where added after a few patches. I think phDe 5 is the update to loot tables
---
I mean yea but that's not the bear hes talking about
---
Reddit had to open up a new server farm just to contain the entirety of this post
---
Well that's shitty as fuck. BGs were the number one place you got to get to know members of the other faction on your server.
---
Yeah, some profession items won't be in the game on launch lol
---
It was terrible. 
---
Mainly because I was terrible. 
---
My talent points went like this: level 10, 1 point into arms. 11, fury. 12, protection. 13, arms. 14, fury. 15, protection. I did that until somewhere in the 40s I believe and bought fresh vendor armor sets every new zone. Got my first plate armor and mount at like 47 from a guildmate who felt bad for my dumb ass. 
---
I made this warrior in June 2005. This ding was in May 2006.
---
I did spend quite a bit of time exploring and talking to people in towns and got a Paladin alt to 25 or so during that time though.
---
I hate asmongold.  He has a respectable amount of knowledge of the game. 
---
But fuck I hate his attitude, mannerisms and weak ass hands.  His videos with that unforgivable gumline keep popping up on my recommended list on YouTube.
---
I don't think there's a chance we'll see more than one battlegroup per region.
---
Most streamers will just grind dungeons to avoid gankers. It seems like grinding dungeons will actually be faster to level because there will be too much competition for quest mobs.
---
Oh look you guys, it's Embriel spewing hate and toxicity again. I do wonder how his experience on private servers could possibly be so bad when he himself is always such a beacon of light and positivity.
---
There are a lot of non raid items that won‚Äôt be available too dude. Cen Rep items, class items, dungeon .5 items, scourge invasion items, etc
---
Shut up and give me water you fucking office cooler
---
Well we will have like 6 months of world pvp to get to know your faction before BG's are in the game.
---
Could just be Ya-Sh-rahzh and since you can't really say shra without it sounding a bit like shara it ends up feeling like an extra A there.
---
Not sure about the first one.
---
Ok, but that's a bit odd considering the original question of this comment tree is specifically about talents while levelling.
---
Oh shit really? It is $75 at my local Bookmans... may have to pick it up.
---
Looks down to a T exactly like the little kid model from WC3
---
You should do this when choosing to post this shitty normie meme.
---
Yeah I'm worried about the same thing. Theres probably only going to be one battlegroup, but there will still be clear differences in the skill level of players on various servers. TBH this is why I'm going to end up on the streamer server even though I don't really care about the streamers at all. A lot of the rank one players are either streamers or are friends of streamers. They are all going to play on the same server. That means the streamer server is going to end up being the 2019 version of Tichondrius or Blackrock or whatever. If you want to play with and against high skill players you are going to have to hop on the bandwagon. Playing on a different server is just permanently relegating yourself to the minor leagues.
---
Yes I don't think many would attempt to dispute that the og wow servers exist. I'm wondering why you were so sure they won't go with the og names.
---
Are you playing to have fun? Pick Gnome.
---
Are you playing to be one of the first people on your server to do something that people first did back when George W. Bush was still President? Roll human.
---
Your best bet is to wait for realm names to be released or level up quickly to 60 and join whichever guild has the most high level people ready to farm dungeons/raids, that's usually how it goes on Pservers.
---
I tested my 2017 Intel M3 Surface pro.
---
1.12 private server client:
---
60 fps, 1080p full settings.  
---
Retail client:
---
45-55 fps, level 4 settings, 900p
---
Will it really be 6 months before bgs are released?
---
People can't do that, because if they have nothing to cry about, they get no attention.
---
[The Nicker] intensifies
---
You'd need an absurd amount, somewhere around 800 spell damage, but JotC gives you +140 and the ZHC gives you +204 while ToEP gives you +175, and you'd obviously pop one of those before nuking someone.
---
Monkeynews, Perplexity, Tribe, probably some more from Apes too, but those are the ones I remember.
---
Is the time known now. This morning everyone was saying 2 months tops.
---
Exactly. He appeals to a total different audience. I think people haven't really got an issue with streamers being on a particular server, but type of streamer that attracts an obnoxious adolescent fan base that follows them around like a swarm of locusts. I mean I enjoy all people that play Vanilla, but those types I'd rather from a distance. Like the Sun (but without the warmth).
---
Bring the player, not the class, except 13 warlocks/SP + 1 DH
---
im torn myself. i love the male UD casting animation, as lock will likely be my main. female UD cast animations have a nice feel for healing, which would be fitting for priest alt as intend.   
---
of course doing the switch of that and female lock, with male priest alt, would be enjoyable too.
---
Earlier I shared some upscaled WoW maps created by /u/EversorA (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here\_have\_some\_upscaled\_highresolution\_wow\_maps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here_have_some_upscaled_highresolution_wow_maps/)). Quite a few people asked me about the possiblity of creating an addon to have these maps available in the game. Last night /u/orly_owl87 gave me a bit of information that pushed me to give this ago.
---
I have created 3 packages, containing either textures that went through 1, 2 or 3 pass(es) of upscaling and denoising. You can even mix and match between the different packages if you like the appearance of one over the other for a specific area.
---
You can download these packs from [https://upscaled.classicmaps.xyz](https://upscaled.classicmaps.xyz). 
---
For comparison images see: [https://upscaled.classicmaps.xyz/Home/CompareOverview/](https://upscaled.classicmaps.xyz/Home/CompareOverview/)

Prob around that, 2 phases

Asmongold voted for trump https://youtu.be/qNidS5s4UFs

this post isn't even that large compared to the kind of shit i've seen on reddit before
---
&gt; no one was banned for ninja looting in vanilla
---
yea they werent but they were put onto the blacklist and were excluded from joining any serious guild on the server.
---
I dunno, I‚Äôm not a retail player. I haven‚Äôt played since a brief stint of WoD (like three/four weeks of highmaul?) and I should add that I personally don‚Äôt care if someone is from a pserver. I‚Äôm just stating why people don‚Äôt want to play with pserver players from on objective standpoint, because that‚Äôs the general vibe that pserver players have.
---
Its 2 different audiences/styles of gameplay. Some people like min/maxing and some like having fun/being casual. No need to get hostile man i'm not necessarily against you lol
---
Let's be honest, people like him are probably on the spectrum.
---
I appreciate the effort but it looks like these have been overprocessed and have begun to artifact certain aspects of the map.
---
I main druid in retail, and I'm 90% sure I'll be maining druid in classic. I just love the true hybrid playstyle, which shows its strength in m+. Offheals as boomy/guardian, catweaving as resto, taunting mobs off tanks when they're out of cds or to displace mobs, plus incredible utility no matter what spec. This will be even more pronounced in classic due to no 'specs' and just talent trees and I'm definitely looking forward to it. The idea of druid in open world pvp is also what excites me the most. I played vanilla, tbc and wrath and my fondest memories (apart from ulduar) were open world skirmishes on a PvP server.
---
what? let me get this straight because i'm a lil drunk maybe i'm mis reading this
---
you are saying that if only the top 1% or even 5% of raiding guilds killed the lich king, it would have NOT made the expansion worse for the other 99% - 95%???
---
if this is what you are saying, you sir are wrong and I hate to use an insult but you are dumb. In WOTLK EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER wanted to kill the Lich King. He is THE big baddy. He is THE final boss. He is THE guy you want to kill and finish this shit up! He is the single reason why you have done ALLLLLL of the shit you have done for the past year or whatever. You and your SQUAD killing the mother fucking Lich King.
---
You know what would have sucked major horse dong? Only 100 dudes or so on every server getting to kill the Lich King. 
---
Which means if you weren't in that slim 100 people group (top few guilds) you would have had to watch the DOPE ass cinematics on youtube...or you could pay one of those guilds 50k gold for 1 of the 3 "carry spots" to get the Lich King kill and if you pay an extra 15k gold they will let the videos play LUL . 
---
Which means for your guild and character y'alls "Northrend storyline" is pretty much moot, just kinda make up some BS lore like either the Lich King lives but backs off? (lululul) or "a group of other young brave heroes killed the Lich King but ya'll didn't cause y'all aint in the top 1% of raiders lululul get rekt noob go back to Lord Marrowgar 10 man"
---
I could go on and on....WOTLK would have been MUCH worse of an expansion pack if they made the Lich King so hard only 1% (or even 5% like you said) of people either got to see him or kill him.
---
We don't know for sure how long each phase will be, but if we look at vanilla timeline, then 6-8months is what it would be.
---
That‚Äôs not true either LOL tons of shit isn‚Äôt going to be in the game at the start that‚Äôs going to be available in later phases even in dungeons.
---
Best reply right here. I agree. I enjoy some small and big streamers as well. I like chill rooms and I get it, people don't like the streamers that spend their days playing video games and making money which doesn't bring much to the world. But....it's entertainment. And it's someone else's dream. If they want to do it then they should. I think people should be able to spend time doing something they are pationate about.
---
Im just repeating what ive seen countless others say, im sure there is a way to do it (such as trash resets without killing a boss)
---
Only it's more engaging and your don't have to leave your room.
---
That is where the orignal artifacts come from for the game. I can also share raw textures instead of compressed ones, but I don't know how stable the client will be when loading hunders of megabytes of map textures.
---
It is their perogative to do that - but the reaction here has shown that at least the majority on Reddit are against that idea and are more likely to Target streamers for even suggesting something like that. If that statistic holds true for players outside the Reddit demographic, streamers with a similar mentality to sodapoppin are probably going to have a bad time playing classic.
---
Fair. good work.
---
I don't think it's hate. Most of us just don't want all the drama that comes with them. Even the responses in this thread are overly dramatic. It's just a video game after all.
---
Your friends play single player beerpong????
---
I don‚Äôt even understand this sentiment. Big games still hit far more often than they miss with a few notable exceptions (No man‚Äôs sky, FO76, ME andromeda, Anthem) which I will also say were overhyped and pretty much all delivered what was promised, but people ignored the development updates with what they wished they would be.
---
The biggest complaint people have about most AAA titles nowadays are unnecessary micros that are mostly cosmetic or time savers in single player games and nothing that ruins any experience if you don‚Äôt buy them. I‚Äôd way rather have a $20 trench coat skin DLC optional than developers keeping on top of inflation and charging $80 for the game that doesn‚Äôt include that trench coat like they should if they are to be held to the standards of yesteryear.
---
Seems reasonable. I was in a top 50 world guild on retail, but that was just spam raidprogress for 2 weeks. This will be different. I'm excited
---
Who the fucks stopping you? People like u act like these streamers follow you around, gank and call u names after.
---
RIP Geburak.
---
I like this kind of thing!
---
It was the best stock photo I could find without watermarks.
---
I looked for so long that my legs fell asleep.
---
It only gets close to cringe if we'd see the OP's site in addon form, warning users when creating a character on a particular streamer server "streamer X is on this server, are you sure you wish to proceed?". Or "a streamer has migrated to your server: you may want to transfer".
---
Gnome it is...thanks
---
Nah dude. I've gotten help on elite quests from horde players before on private servers, it's really cool.
---
Wait so can you walk me through the phases in vanilla. I forgot lol.
---
I play single player beer pong without the friends or the pong and I drink whenever I feel the crippling social anxiety creeping in.
---
yeah at 60 you can't get shock + sanctity. Spell power ret is kinda viable though.
---
Yes. If it's this bad on a subreddit months before release, imagine what it will be like on the server. I'd rather not have to deal with it by the time I create my character.
---
Nice Ding classy
---
13th? Isn't the release date august 27th?
---
nah they will still be able to mess with them even if theres a 10+ level difference
---
and its not just streamers that will no-life it, PLENTY of normal people, trolls, people who are no-lifing it just to mess with streamers, etc etc
---
its gonna be BAD on PvP servers man. and even on PvE with tagging shit or trying to aggro extra shit
---
[Now make something to avoid shitty post like this.](https://i.imgur.com/WFiZWCw.jpg)

But that's everything isn't it? Art is a business. But people need to get food somehow doing what they like. Everything turns into a business once you realize you need a way to make money. There are people who film themselves camping in the outdoors and make money. Oh and don't confuse the art thing with video games. They're not the same. I do see their actions dictating how things work in video games. That sucks sometimes. Dude, people are complicated when it comes to comparing things like what is ethical and their basic needs of income. Just don't watch them I guess. I don't know. Most of them, not all are enjoying what they're doing. Maybe it does start to feel like a job eventually.
---
Yeah but it's not monetized so
---
There's ways to get defense capped in phase 1, it requires lots of Temple runs but if you're rolling a feral tank you better be ready to grind anyway. You can solo the bosses at least and get decent gph from selling blues.
---
Don't worry about it
---
i'm sorry what? what did I say? I said that I thought blizzard would have fixed an issue like this a long time ago, before they put it out to beta. I fail to understand what I said deserved 28 downvotes and your snooty comment
---
Swear to Jesus bro
---
"Millions" of dollars?
---
Asmon's pretty much the biggest numbers in WoW Classic right now.  He hasn't hit 20K subs yet.  At 20K subs, assuming a 50/50 split of the money (which I believe is what it's supposed to be), that'd be $50K a month, sure.  So, assuming that he maintains that level - a level that's been rising right now with the attention on Classic but will likely go down when people are busier playing than watching people play - it'd take almost two years to hit a million.  And sure, I'd love to make a million in a couple of years, but that's still just *a* million, and it requires a situation that's very unlikely.
---
Actually... yeah, it's impossible.  Check Asmon's [sub count trend](https://twitchtracker.com/asmongold/subscribers).  At best he hovers around 4-4.5K most of the time, then spiked with BFA launching, but that died down and hit a low of 458 - under 500! - and has since had a huge spike because people want to see the Classic beta to see if they'll be interested in playing the game when it launches.  So it's more likely he'll drop back down to more like 6K subs, and that's being generous.  That drops him down to $15K a month, which would mean closer to six years to hit a million.
---
They're not making "millions."  And as you can see with that chart, it relies on trends that they can't really control, and staying online and relevant constantly.
---
Even Sodapoppin, who's held more consistently, is more in the 10K-12K range, but was way below that prior to July 2017.  He hasn't had a chance to make a million yet.
---
So who the hell are these "streamers who make millions of dollars" that you're talking about?  What, someone like Ninja, who's got nothing to do with WoW and isn't part of this conversation?
---
Also, the amount of money someone makes is not an excuse to treat them worse than you would someone else.  Money doesn't magically remove emotions from a person, only morons believe that (or assholes who don't really believe it but use it as an excuse for them to be assholes).  Yeah, we all get it, a lot of people are jealous they can't make that kind of money, because they don't have a decent or interesting enough personality or just don't feel like playing a game hours and hours per day trying to keep people entertained enough to get them to pay for it.
---
He‚Äôs smiling can‚Äôt ya tell?
---
I rolled hunter in vanilla wow, im set on mage classic wow though.
---
You can give me the textures and I can replace them with the text I've used to correct spelling errors on the other map when I have time.
---
You‚Äôre going to blow your friends?
---
Unpopular advice - keep an open mind about other MMO's. Classic has appeal but not from complex mechanics, so if you value mechanical difficulty, you might not be satisfied with classic. Try it for yourself but keep an open mind
---
I'll be picking fights all the live long day out in the world. I don't give a shit about farming honor.
---
I just think it's great that Asmongold has become the face of wow.  You know Blizzard does not want that guy to be the spokesman.
---
If a feral druid farms his Gnomer weps (they have 3 charges, 50% attack speed for 30sec so 1 for every boss) they can be top5 dps. There's only 1 raid spot for them though, and that's like 40-50 Gnomers a week during Naxx.
---
Do you want them post- or pre-upscaling?
---
Pet attack speed normalization occurred in patch [2.0.3](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.3_(undocumented_changes)).
---
Broken tooth will have 1.0 AS in Classic.
---
I cant wait for wall climbing.
---
Top 5? No. Not in a any sort of semi-serious guild. Top 15 maybe.
---
as a lefty,  99% of games are only righty and 1% let you choose but no games ever make a character a lefty so suck it up
---
You, good sir, earned every bit of that upvote
---
There is a similar guild forming already on EU discord server im on. &lt;Adept&gt; they have most big name eu streamers and pvpers (ziqo for example) and planning to do the mafia shit as well.
---
Yep. I raided Vanilla hardcore hardcore, raided TBC semi-hardcore and wotlk normal, raided MoP normal and WoD normal. Every single expansion I raided I had stuff that I LOVED about it, stuff I liked/enjoyed about it, stuff I HATED about it and stuff that I disliked/wasn't a huge fan of about it. 
---
I guess the same goes for PvP and leveling. Although vanilla leveling has few "positives" and way more "negatives" compared to TBC leveling, and while (in my opinion) TBC leveling was kinda the sweet spot, everything at and before Wotlk had great leveling(besides vanilla). AFAIK/remember WOTLK was the beginning of the end for leveling having any kind of difficulty (or being fun like at all, but again thats my opinion lol).
---
I hope they're not. But if they stay consistent with their values they will stop it if it gets excessive.
---
They would tell Soda to stop broadcasting his location to the world.
---
Afterwards should be fine for now, I'll see what I can do then.
---
The actual racial benefits are pretty negligible, but in my opinion ferals perform better on the alliance side, due to getting way more from paladin blessings than they get from shamans (read: fucking nothing). I raided extensivly as a bear and had no problems getting a group. I've talked elsewhere in this thread about how in demand bears really were. Just be sure you do your homework and build it properly and you should be okay (reading taladril's guide is a great start).
---
I personally wish they wouldn‚Äôt do anything and let people play the game.
---
I get piggy cuz piggy is frand.
---
Not benefiting from WF totem means alliance I would imagine.
---
that was my first alt that i lvld to max
---
Yes, they said after servers are mature in the interviews.
---
Clearly I'm out of the loop here, what is on August 13th?  Release date is August 27th.
---
Hahahah that‚Äôs not too different from what I used to do. I remember switching out greens and blues for new white pieces of gear just because it gave me more armor, I was an absolute noob. 
---
But then again, that‚Äôs why we had so much fun back in the day.
---
Talking with friends is always different from talking with anonymous randoms, thats a given.
---
Perhaps the issue isnt in other people.
---
 i'm sorry what? what did I say? I said that I thought blizzard would have fixed an issue like this a long time ago, before they put it out to beta. I fail to understand what I said deserved 28 downvotes and your snooty comment. This isn't a small minor bug like "in front of stormwind as you walk out the third bush on the left has a slight rendering issue". its "some mobs that die do not respawn" lmao thats a major gamebreaking bug. i understand a major part of beta testing a game is to find bugs and shit, i was just surprised that blizzard hadn't already found this and fixed it yet. i in no way shape or form was saying that beta tests arent for bugs, or whatever you are implying that i was saying.
---
Blizzard's stance on PvP griefing is that it has a PvP solution, therefore its not griefing in the traditional sense; they don't interfere in those kinds of things usually.
---
Same faction griefing is a bit different, but I don't think Blizzard would ever start punishing stream snipers.
---
What are the odds that the same 2 problematic people are the same with the 24k as the 4K?
---
[https://upscaled.classicmaps.xyz/PNG.zip](https://upscaled.classicmaps.xyz/PNG.zip) 
---
This should be all if I didn't screw up.
---
Arms is usually a PvP spec. You could raid as Arms, but you'd basically be saying "i'm willing to do less damage because it looks cooler". You'd probably have to find a more casual raiding guild.
---
gettin more of a ‚Äúi wanna eat you vibe‚Äù but i smile when i see food so i understand it
---
I started WoW a few months after launch. I played from then until Cata almost uninterrupted and came back for MoP cause...Pandas. Rerolling new toons, fresh start servers, PvP, Achievements, rep grinds for pets and mounts, and RP kept the game interesting for me. I've never been a raider and that hardcore timesink doesn't interest me.
---
  
---
If you're a  hardcore raider rushing content and finishing the raids asap? You're going to get burned out and bored real quick. MMOs aren't for those who want to do all the content available within the first few weeks it drops, which is the part that Blizz and the player base seems to have forgotten about.
---
Neither of those guilds are aiming for a week one Rag.
---
Onslaught (onslaught-wow.com) are the most prominent guild aiming for it currently, and their roster is nearly full.
---
They have all the speed run records through the pserver era.
---
Because it's much easier logistically for Blizzard to use new names so no employee ever confuses the two.
---
Yeah but if you cast it on someone else, you don't get it yourself. Even if you brought 20 dwarf priests to raid, half the raid is still doesn't have fear ward.
---
And as you would never bring 20 priests to raid (maybe 2-6?), there is actually a high chance that a horde raid would have more fear breaks anyway as its easy to bring 10-25 undead rogues/mages/locks/priest etc which is a load more than 6 fear wards.
---
No
---
It's not collusion not to want to play with someone. I like world pvp but if the alliance had a list of ninjas on the horde it's not collusion to make me aware of that while I play horde. Same thing with stream sniping.
---
Not surprised since everyone is talking about their models being smaller and having an advantage, not something everyone knew about in Vanilla. Information just didn't spread as well.
---
No we dont
---
What?  Because I think you guys spamming forums and reddit with your crap cry baby posts is pointless that makes me a brown nose?  Ok.
---
Yeah, but OP is still right that these aren‚Äôt gonna happen in Classic WoW... with one exception. 
---
As much as you people love shitting on streamer servers, these huge world events are a major perk.
---
Deep wounds is low.  It gets pushed off and is not a concern.  Mortal strike I'm not sure.
---
I don‚Äôt know about that. I haven‚Äôt ever heard or seen people actually get banned for PvP things.
---
I used to constantly sit in gadgetzan or BB and kill everyone I could while melded. Got lots of hate messages from people, often telling me to enjoy my ban as I was reported, nothing ever happened.
---
They wouldn't intervene because it very clearly has a solution. Shut the stream off.
---
PvP, Holidays, RP, Maxing professions, alts.  
---
Maybe Blizzard will implement housing this time around. Doubltful, but I can dream... If they ever could get on Wildstar's level for that, the players will endlessly create their own content.
---
Check out Shedo. The guy pulls 900-1200 dps in BWL.
---
i'm sorry are you talking to me? or are you just speaking in general. because what i am saying is that the bug is a major bug that i'm surprised blizzard had not already found out themselves and fixed before beta came out. that is all. its not like a small hard to notice glitch like " in front of stormwind as you walk out the third bush on the left has a slight rendering issue" its "yeah some mobs you kill straight up never respawn ever"
---
also you are saying that now a days a lot of gamers think "beta tests" are really just "free demo of most/the whole game" tests or "full release of the game but were calling it a beta stress test so people play it and watch it on twitch but no bugs!".....well yeah because a LOT of companies do shit like that now a days. they do exactly that, they put a game they damn well know has been beta tested up shits creek and back down thrice out to beta and give pleenntttyyy of keys to streamers and to give them away in their chatrooms just to get more sales. 
---
You are also saying that when gamers actually have to test shit they dont like it and cry about it....yet i've seen very little of this. 
---
what are you even talking about my man? you've seem to have lost it.
---
Druid is probably my favorite class, but I never understood the facination with Boomkin. I wish I could just stay in my humanoid form lol
---
And why dis Arcane Intellect cost 1/3 my mana bar as a 60 mage?
---
idegaf abotu soda, it's absurd that people are bitching cause streamers basically want to make a list of people they don't waant to play with. IT's not a fucking ban list, it's a lacklist, basically an ignore list. People don't want to play with stream snipers they can choose to follow the list. No one is FORCED to play with anyone they don't want to.
---
That seems alot less efficient than just down ranking and constantly casting.
---
Oh they're not complete map images? Will be harder to do if they cut off midway.
---
Definitely. I've seen some shadow oil builds theorycrafted that seem interesting
---
Fair enough, re-reading in context I see how I misunderstood.  Actually agree with all of your points here
---
That's the way the game loads the maps (exploring zones and all).
---
Yeah my bad. My thoughts from a similar thread kind of spilled over. Back on topic, even the concept of blacklisting stream snipers is stupid. If you don't want people to know where you are stop telling them... Are we going to blacklist people using chat to give away enemy positions too? &gt;&lt;
---
So is ele resto
---
They wouldn't do anything...At least I don't think so. The ganker would have to be proven guilty first. How would you even begin that process?
---
A boomkin isnt a mage why would you expect to... you bring other aspects.  Crit buff rebirth optional emergency healing, Innervate for healers.  As a hybrid you shouldn't keep up with the pure dps power house known as mage.
---
LOL don't gank him then. Back i nthe day you ganked the wrong guildmemeber and you'd have people bitching at you too. Also don't over exaggerate. Their fans won't be a large portion of anything.
---
basically the same as Neo in Matrix.
---
People would do this in Classic for fun. I watched Thrall and the old Tauren leader die many a time.
---
You actually might be right, I just heard about someone in gadgetzan getting banned. But that might've been because he abused the roofs a bit too much.
---
Lolol.
---
It's not griefing. If you're going to play on a PvP server then you also sign up for World PvP and if you're gonna be a big streamer then stream snipers will be part of it.
---
There's nothing to handle. PvP is permitted.
---
Blizzard has already said camping is not griefing. However if take far to much to the extreme, like this is the only thing these 5 people do for months at a time. I could see blizzard handing out warnings.
---
Emerald Dream was the very first rppvp server. It wasn‚Äôt launched until the game was already out for a while. I know because me and buddy rerolled on it day 1 and rped as lesbian sister night elves who‚Äôs mother was eaten by the bear you get a quest to kill inside a cave in dark shore. We would wait for people to come kill the bear and then kill it for them and be like ‚Äúthat was for our mother you bitch bear. Now let‚Äôs scissor each other in victory sister‚Äù and people were so confused. Good times. 
---
Anyways I forgot where I was going with this.
---
Crouched and skating about!
---
Ok, I kind of find the smaller shoulder guards make female toons less daunting.  They made them look for fluid and graceful instead of big and intimidating.
---
He can legit talk and engage his audience for 8 hours straight. Whatever you think about his skill or personality, being able to entertain like that for hours on end is a skill. He‚Äôs an entertainer of sorts.
---
I was on daggerspine. Dwarf hunter named bombshot. Anyone remember kosbo mortale kuroma or angeohaul or however you spelt it? Lol.
---
blizzard has banned people for excessive griefing in the past, so theyre fine with it up until a point. the point where it reaches excessive is up to blizzard though
---
That's not the solution, as that jas nothing to do with what Blizzard has control of. The solution is pvp. If you join a pvp server and are getting killed in pvp, then you leave to a safe area or you call members of your faction to help.
---
They won't because this drama is artificial, temporary and irrelevant.
---
Thats falcor. Protector of the alliance!..... looks like that guy just killed you
---
It doesnt work that way
---
Phase1 which we start with: Mc/ony
---
Phase 2: DM + PVP system
---
Phase 3: BWL + WSG + AV
---
Phase 4: AB + ZG
---
Phase 5: AQ 
---
Phase 6: Naxx
---
If you genuinely think ele/resto is as bad as shockadin you are bad.
---
It is *a* solution. The other solution is  what you  said.
---
Blizzard will never intervene.
---
if there is shards there will be character xfers. i don't see how there can't be.
---
It happened to literally every PvP server when all the PvPers moved to Tichondrius.
---
Yup it's pretty well known what ferals are capable of these days for anyone that keeps up with the PS scene. Doesn't change anything I've said here. OOC/Lotp/Furor are essential, and don't expect to be top 15 in a decent guild. For every 1200 dps druid you find me, I'll find 5 1600 dps warriors and mages.
---
So, shaman sits there buffing your party, and don't focus on attacking or healing? I never heard that before
---
I had an idea similar to this but in addon form. I don't know if this is possible with the addon system but it would work similar to a Kill on Site list. It could announce to different channels where this person is if they're spotted, etc. If you knew their character names you could put them on the list and when you're out and about in the world it would auto target or announce it if they're nearby. So you could avoid them that way or help get them killed or whatever.
---
Don't feed the trolls.
---
yo any idea that fits into this thinking
---
"what should i do thats interesting?" 
---
"I know, I'll just find what **other popular** people are interested in, whether negatively or positively, and try to force myself onto that"
---
is really boring
---
You are bad and your comments will be disregarded
---
 But you think phase 1 will be about 6 months?
---
Shroud will play classic for like a month at most then never touch it again
---
look at you posting about streamers
---
4 str 4 stam leather belt. AHH OOH
---
You would think yes. But they might also have measures that make it possible. I just think it's a bit silly to be so sure of something you are really just guessing at. There's been no announcement on server names.
---
Will there still be the turn in quests like the elemental bosses and armored elite horses or were they removed in 1.12?
---
Lmao virgin dad gamer makes no sense but this post was funny
---
That's not a huntard problem, that's poor guild leadership problem. For a Hunter it's an amazing PvP weapon, one of the best in fact.
---
Can someone explain why exactly are people avoiding streamers?
---
Running around as a mage and sheeping low health people then giving them one love tap with my wand when they heal to full feels so good. Poor warriors need all the help they can get.
---
Not strange when I was already aware of all those other things.
---
Trust nobody, not even yourself.
---
Im not going to use addons other than titanbar.
---
I didnt need addons in vanilla  so why should i use in classic? :P  
---
Titanbar only allows me to see things without having to navigate the interface to do so....  a quality of life-change i guess. :(
---
I had exp-timer on nostalrius and it was motivating to see how long it takes until i level up next.
---
Just Google it my dude.
---
No 3-4 months for each, so that makes 6-8 motnhs until BG's
---
Safe spotting is a ban. Melding isn‚Äôt safespotting as you can be killed they just have to pull you from meld. Which is easy yet hard. Most times they attack you on accident and they get killed by guards.
---
Honestly man just play the game there will be plenty of other casual players to hook up with. Concentrating on how others play will only ruin the experience for yourself
---
Well if the tank needs it its kind of a problem
---
Yeah streamers will be good to get some pvp battles going. You can eother coordinate or kill the streamer until fans kill you. You get help and kill the fans. Next thing you know theres a raid vs raid going on.
---
Okay waste your time
---
Can‚Äôt wait for release so this can finally be debunked. Some people here have been greatly over-exagerating the problems that would result from playing on a "streamer server"
---
Don‚Äôt know where the hate comes from, or why someone would want to reiterate every single day that they hate WoW streamers. 
---
Kinda sounds like the kids who tried to look cool by saying Justin Bieber sucked when he was beginning to get famous, although everyone here should be at least 20~ assuming they played Vanilla.
---
They were multiplicative.  I remember travel being slightly faster than base mount 161% and 154% cat form from 1.3*1.15*1.03 boot enchant.
---
Did it happen to be in Netherstorm in the big bubble?
---
It is a solution but not one Blizzard will ever own up to. Telling people there is a solution that is out of blizzards control is in part blizzard giving up control.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for release so this can finally be debunked. Some people here have been greatly over-exagerating the "problems" that would result from playing on a "streamer server"
---
Negative impacts to server faction ratio, economy, scarab lord (although already very exclusive) is automatically going to a streamer with the sheer number of people throwing mats at them.
---
The price is wrong.... bitch
---
You made a huge post about sharding and called it layering. They‚Äôre not the same. They‚Äôre loosely related. Zone density is sharding related. Server underpopulation is Layering related. 
---
You also didn‚Äôt mention one negative factor post layer collapses;
---
 - A server without a lot of tourist now having a population 400-1000% higher than the game designs capacity
---
 - Server events completely corrupted by a massive population ie. AQ event, world bosses, etc
---
 - Server impossibilities like world buffs being measurable or usable, as cooldowns will cause insane frustration between guilds
---
 - the logistical nightmare that will be BRM. What was once full of hundreds of players will not potentially be full of thousands of players. This will cause raid times to be extended, as pvp in these zones could potentially add 30 minutes to an hour to get your guild inside the raid. 
---
The game wasn‚Äôt designed to have 4000 players on a server. It remotely worked in pservers because of dynamic respawn, removal of wb timers, and a world clock operating on all hours. Classic will have none of that. Layering has the potential to destroy the game. People who say ‚Äúdo you know how hard the starting zones would be without layering!?!‚Äù are ignorant and misinformed.
---
Yes there will be. 
---
Here's the patch notes if you are interested: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/vanilla-av-patch-notes/74516
---
I'd highly, highly advise against it.  I've played on both types of servers.  RP, because I had IRL friends that were on it, but I preferred the regular server by far.
---
Why?
---
What's the point of RP when nobody is around?  
---
You will get reported if it's not "in character" enough.  This is a subjective thing of course.
---
Prepare to get reported for not playing along with someone's RP.  By this I mean: You will get reported for simply being silent and existing/questing in the same area as some random RP going on.
---
The people are absolutely weird and hugboxy.
---
I never did try out the RP PVP option. What‚Äôs the difference?
---
My god they'll be relevant again!
---
Oh I see so the honor system actually came out BEFORE bgs?  So you can essentially start ranking up before BGs are released?
---
Lmao you don't know how to play shockadin
---
I'll RP a PVPer if it gets me into Beta...
---
Yeah but then the company is supposed to, you know, acknowledge and *fix* the bugs. 
---
Remember BfA?
---
Not true one button one action per account they have always approved of multiboxing because of the money
---
Lol love it.
---
You don't need sanc
---
[Here](https://clips.twitch.tv/ThirstyHappyCamelBCouch) is StaySafe riding his Warlock mount in the beta to compare.
---
I dont think they will do nothing. Not because they dont like streamers, they very clearly do use them as a extended marketing farm. But rather, they dont want waste ressources on this game. They want it out and reap in the revenue.
---
I doubt they will have many GMs considering how automated the game will be. Again that is to keep costs down. Blizzard cannot monitor daily which streamer is getting ganked.
---
We get to judge his public persona, as its what he voluntarily, publicly puts off.
---
Yup, that's essentially where the tarrenmill vs southshore war stories comes from, so for the first months ranking will mean slaughtering players in the world, not a good time to still be leveling :D
---
Sick map on the wall although Kalimdor looks a little funny.
---
I'd hope they'd laugh.
---
Until they switch to the server that you purposely chose in order to avoid them
---
I appreciate your optimism, and hope you're right.
---
This is normal. People would get black listed for ninjaing etc. Your reputation is important in vanilla. 
---
What he said was people who litterally use his stream as a way to ruin as much as possible. I had a massive ignore list of people who i knew as ninjas when i played, who i would ignore like the plague. 
---
Big guilds on both sides would do the very same thing.
---
Tl;dr this is nothing new. People are overreacting.
---
&gt; Telling people there is a solution that is out of blizzards control is in part blizzard giving up control.
---
How does your solution not do the exact same thing? They can't force or tell other players to come help the person getting camped.
---
They have said that in some interview, so it's not just a guess. Don't remember which one, but it was confirmed that they're not using original names. Think it was in the recent tipsout one but not sure.
---
Why would you remove them from where they are?
---
I had no idea shroud even played wow or would be playing classic
---
If you're totem twisting, you need to cast two totems every 9 seconds. Thats 33% of all possible GCD's going in to pure support, *at a minimum.*
---
Thanks for your work and effort!
---
Can I leave a request for having an option for the Hunter bar to also follow a left to right fill like the melee ones? I feel like it is easier to see how much more time remaining for next shot, and time needed to stay still that way (at least for me). Like 50% bar means on a 3 second weapon I easily see 1.5 seconds time left.
---
I also prefer the simpler aesthetic of one-way fill.
---
Thanks for your work.
---
With how good the blizzard anti cheat is and the subscription barrier and region servers, we won‚Äôt have anything near the Chinese gold farming bots that are on undocumented servers
---
When said big streamer crys about pvp on a pvp server and calls for bans? Yup we are the wierd ones. They should sac the fuck up and stop whining. Or i will dedicate my time to streamsniping them all fucking night.
---
People who complain about streamers are hilarious. This is gold.
---
Defias propaganda. The masons were paid what they were owed.
---
Who gives a rat‚Äôs ass?
---
I'm having war flashbacks.
---
Heck yeah can‚Äôt wait
---
Thanks for the clip! Confirms that the wrong animation is being used in the actual beta and not just wowhead.
---
If its a pvp zone or a pvp realm its fair game. Im looking forward to the rage videos on youtube.
---
Most of us played private servers, that was the only way to play vanilla WOW for years, tons of the playerbase on whatever server you end up will have private server experience, get used to it lol.
---
It's still best for grinding even without that mechanic
---
Man I totally forgot about this, I think I just didn‚Äôt understand the system back then.  Total noob to MMOs then.  Sounds epic!!! And what I like most is it gives guys like me who can only play 2-4 hours a day time to catch up
---
Those were my favorite part. I thought it really added another layer of strategy when combined with an organized push. Good stuff. Thanks for sharing the link mate.
---
I had this image as my desktop wallpaper for years
---
2 stacks please. Don't be stingy.
---
I created a site too. The address is [www.ifyoueanttoavoidstreamersplayonapvpserver.com](www.ifyoueanttoavoidstreamersplayonapvpserver.com)
---
Yes.  This.
---
There is an insane amount of overlap in the venn diagram of "RP server denizens" and "tumblrinas".  People think they're reducing their exposure to toxicity by going to a RP server.  The real toxicity is within the needy safe-space RPer social groups who aren't well adjusted enough in the real world, let alone Azeroth.
---
ZG bat which also had 1sec atk spd beats ole Broken Tooth for PvP just for the simple fact it was so big it blocked peoples view and the bats also had the AoE ability screech.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#screech
---
It's been out of print for the best part of a decade and is a very big collector's item, that's an absolute steal!
---
Here's a really fantastic video on it: https://youtu.be/Ev-cy000SaM
---
It covers things from wPVP problems, to drama, to servers potentially dying if a streamer + fans transfer off.
---
Asmongold won't leave. What else is he gonna play? BFA? LOL
---
Why would they do anything at all? 
---
Spoiler:
---
They won‚Äôt.
---
Lupos was a beast and wrecked shit when big red!
---
He literally would solo pally and warriors if they was not careful, lmao
---
Cdew?? The guy who wears Rad Dad shirts and has his 3 golden retrievers in the room with him half the time? He's one of the last guys I'd call a douche. He worked his ass off to get back to blizzcon each year despite so much heartbreak. Anyone who actually thinks he's toxic is truly a drama queen.
---
wtf are you talking about, I played Ravenholdt in BC and WOTLK and it had a decent population... pretty sure it was at medium pop.
---
I play some league still, and it's still brutal. You just have to remind yourself that the worst offenders are probably teenagers, so whatever. Imagine having an actual argument about performance in a videogame with a fourteen year old irl, lol.
---
To be clear, I have no problem with streamers, particularly the big/popular ones and their involvement in Classic.
---
I believe they bring more positivity than negativity in Classic's case. 
---
I just want to avoid the clusterfuck that will occur on those servers, which will be no issue since it will be public knowledge which servers these guys roll on.
---
Hopefully they don't intervene. Streamers should live with it. Tough shit.
---
For a start it's impossible for them to hide which server they're on when they start playing anyway, so this is a really odd request. Secondly it's quite possible after a month they re-roll on to your server anyway for whatever reason, so now your lvl 48 character is stuck on the same server as asmongold anyway.   
---
Might be time to put your big boy panties on and stop crying about streamers and just play your own game yeah?
---
If you have your dps doing damage 33% of the time, would you say he is a dps?
---
Omg omg omg i thought i drempt of this pic back in the day but its real, its so fuckin cool
---
Yeah I can do something like that. Someone wanted a reverse fill for the melee bars so I'll add it to that.
---
I hope you realize that for the low low price of $15 you can play classic. BUT wait there's more. You can also play up to level 110 in retail. RIP Billy Mays
---
No thinking back on it I think it was wotlk, I'm pretty sure I'd gotten bored of storm peaks and decided to go running around to every inn keeper that had the Halloween treat basket thing for xp and it was one in vanilla worlds somewhere.
---
I was in Battlehammer. One of the best groups of people I've ever played with.
---
Doesn't matter if they hide it, we'll force them to switch. There's about 3 other Pserver guilds and ourselves (2 on each faction) that all plan to roll on one US PVP server on August 12th. After we all rush week one Rag kills, we're going to grief any streamers to the point where they have no choice but to re-roll somewhere else. Wherever we end up, if you consider yourself employed by Twitch, you will not be welcome.
---
7 friends and I are interested in playing on an RP-PVP server. Please Blizz give us at least one server!
---
On stream he definitely won't play it after a month or less but I'm sure he'll play it off stream a LOT
---
Because they will not be welcome wherever WE are.
---
You can create your character before launch.
---
Omar did an interview with Tipsout prior to/around when the Beta came out; during the interview this question was asked and was answered that there will be new server names to avoid confusion.  I‚Äôm sure the video is still on YouTube.
---
Esfand looks like a pedophile and acts like a chode nugget.
---
Can definitely agree, my dwarf hunter was in Clan Battlehammer as well. I always loved the idea of a full dwarf guild.
---
He's been an asshole WAY before he started streaming. He's definitely just like that.
---
&gt; If 20 people are standing around him killing him for hours, they should probably do something about it
---
that's the type of streamsnipers he's talking about though. The thing is, is that there are "good" and "fun" streamsnipers that are completely harmless, and then the other ones that just ruin the game. The ones that are to be black listed are the latter. 
---
&gt; It's Classic WoW man, that's how shit is.
---
I'd like to defend this with the fact that people's reputation is also a huge factor in classic wow, and being known as a streamsniping scumbag will affect your ability to get into serious guilds. Also no one really thinks that they should get banned for it, just blacklisted. Like how people who ninja looted back in the day also got blacklisted.
---
Will only last a couple months unless they nerf the shit out of DM, Mara, and basically all pick pocketing farms. They are all super easy, accessible, and produce shit tons of raw gold.
---
/signed
---
Well thank goodness for that, because we wouldn't even be getting classic without the streamers who complained about retail.
---
In all seriousness, you sound like such a turd talking about him like that. The guy is taking 2 weeks away from the beta to take his mom on a vacation to celebrate her graduation. If you think he's that bad, you probably haven't watched him outside a few clips made by the spiteful jackasses on this sub.
---
I don‚Äôt stream, just curious as to why streamers bother you so much that you and your guild will be taking time out of your day to peruse them like this?
---
I thought I wanted to be a druid.  Now at lvl 51 on a pserver I know I dont want to be one.   I'm still gonna play to 60 anyways to see if it suddenly changes my mind about it. 
---
I LOVED druid in wotlk and cata.     But vanilla druid I'm just not digging it.       I guess I'll see at 60 though
---
"sorry streamers you signed up to be sniped!!" *Cries because a streamer is on the same server*
---
The female human casting animation is pretty good and ofc female dwarf.
---
You're ignoring that the 33% is literally the minimum, as I said in my post. If you're actively responding to threats such as fears, cleansing poisons or diseases, offhealing as needed, or using really any of the utility the class provides, it can be far more. 
---
Also, before you say "cleansing makes you a healer", and to throw your own type of question back at you, *if you're not healing any damage, would you really say that's healing?*
---
A band of potentially hundreds of dissidents are just making it up? I think not. Get the alliance indoctrination out of your head.
---
You never really know if it's sarcasm on this sub
---
Okay just making sure you dont think you are doing some valiant thing
---
Wherever they go the people who were trying to avoid them will suffer
---
They don't have anything else to do with their lives.
---
When did this happen?
---
I always play with minimal amount of addons
---
Probably just going to reskin how my actionbars look and an addon to move around my frames, and that's it.
---
For raiding I need to use a threat addon though, but the rest are unneccessary
---
They're relevant enough to give Blizzard an actual reason to release Classic. Without streamers you'd be stuck playing on some shitty private server with a 6 month lifespan.
---
No they're not
---
Awesome! You rock
---
‚ÄúCalm and peaceful‚Äù because he‚Äôs thinking:  Oh good, dinner has arrived!  üòÉ
---
&gt;step too far
---
fuck streamers, they deserve anything they get
---
This was an awfully long way to say there will be no more than 3 druids in raid, and 2 of them will be healing.
---
I was looking at that column as well and was thinking that it's sort of subjective to say if the potential impact will be high/very high/ etc. Is there a way you could also have something like their average viewer# when streaming classic? I know that might not be easy, but just a thought.
---
Good work otherwise, already have this bookmarked.
---
The reagent is like 50s though. Ain't all profit.
---
&gt;Do they?
---
Did he stutter?
---
Don‚Äôt give them ideas man
---
Anyone want to make a guild with me dedicated to ganking people annoyed with streamers? Oh wait theyll play on a pve realm...
---
Dude school isn't even out yet in a lot of the US. Plus, the angry neckbeards complaining about everything are just as bad as the younger audience if not worse.
---
Come on now.....a few of them play alliance...
---
Don't be shocked and discouraged by how much slower it is to do everything. Try to ignore the instant gratification of retail and focus on immersing yourself in the different pacing. This is the number one piece of advice I can give, because if you go into Classic with a retail baseline you'll likely be unpleasantly surprised.
---
Dude, that's a fuckin job
---
WHO FUCKING CARES.
---
I leveled to 60 before learning there was a talent tree 15 years ago as a dumb kid. This game isnt hard
---
 I watch streams and enjoy most of the content on them. Only a couple that I can't stand and that's just personal opinions. They are good at what they do and I respect that. But, this website I will use without a doubt. 
---
Not because streamers are bad blablabla but, because of the impact it could have on the server. What if they leave or stop playing. So will their fan base. How skewed with the faction balance be? Making the contested territories not so contested after all due to the massive playerbase on one side.
---
I think alot of the people that like this idea are in the same boat but, the vocal ones sperging the hate are what you notice alot. (Wish to avoid them just the same)
---
Who hurt you?
---
Its funny because people actually think it was Twitch that made trade chat garbage. It's been filled with racist edgelords and trolls since its creation.
---
‚ÄúAnyone doing DM west?‚Äù 
---
That just made me feel such a sorrowful form of nostalgia that my eyes watered up.
---
What the fuck
---
Yes its impossible to compete at a high level without such quest helper and postal
---
Yea and the addon should also mark them on your map! OO and then there can also be a button that just instantly kills any streamer on the same continent and deletes their characters! What a great idea!
---
/s
---
But that doesn't fit with my narrative of streamers bad.
---
- Step 1: Don't stream
---
- Step 2: There is no step 2
---
What is there to handle? There's nothing wrong with what you're describing.
---
Cool video... but were you just being politically correct when you pronounced it ‚ÄòTeegol bitees‚Äô??
---
It‚Äôs clearly the old joke Tig ol‚Äô bitties(big ol‚Äô titties).  Drove me nuts every time you said ‚ÄòTeegol‚Äô.
---
Source boi.
---
&gt;I wouldn't care about streamers at all if there wasn't right click report and automated punishment.
---
...there isn't unless you're blatantly breaking TOS
---
Awesome, now it's just old screenshots and questions about what class people should play! Much better!
---
This is absolutely not the case. Blizz didn‚Äôt develop classic because of streamers. 
---
Blizz developed classic because people have been making noise about it since after Wrath.
---
Go for it my dude!
---
Can't wait to see all those warriors leveling faster than world record hunter speed.
---
Asmonfold
---
Asmanifold
---
Asmongould
---
Asmongouda

Assmongold
---
Assmangold
---
Ayymongols
---
And they will have time to do this when?
---
Unless you're Nelf then you really want a pet with stealth for PvP for flag defence.
---
Would someone else take it as something else? He outright complimented you: "you were polite and understanding."
---
Naw. He's blacklisting you if you screen snipe and harass him repeatedly. This sub is just retarded when it comes to streamers and changes the narrative to make their outrage seem justified.
---
I think this was only possible with Undead right? Since they had [Common] instead of [Gutterspeak] 
---
Other horde races couldn't speak to alliance
---
That's why these people have jobs. Because dumbasses like this exist.
---
I played with him during project 60, dude whined the entire time, and then wanted to start project 70 a week into it. Just because he does nice things for someone he‚Äôs related to doesnt mean he‚Äôs not a huge crybaby when he does t get his way
---
Doing the Lord's work
---
You dont see the dumbassery of that statement? You and a streamer will be doing the exact same thing with your "lives" except one will be streaming it. 99% of streamers don't stream as a job. Less than that earn an income. Even less than that earn a liveable income.
---
There are so many posts about this out there, and I don't even particularly consider myself a purist.
---
But to keep it simple, my character's appearance and aesthetics should not be dependent on other players' graphics settings. I chose how I wanted my character to look, and that choice should be respected. This means that a client-side toggle that changes other characters' appearances is undesirable.
---
For branding and overall aesthetic/visual reasons, mixing and matching new and old graphics is ugly and undesirable, ruling out a personal toggle for your own character.
---
This leaves two choices remaining: strictly original, or strictly modern graphics. And between those two options, I'm strongly in favour of strictly original graphics.
---
There are also other considerations in play, such as character visibility in PvP, the potential development cost of remastering assets with no modern counterparts (to create a visually coherent world), and the "preservation" argument. (For other remastered games, the  game is still available and playable in its original form via the second hand market. That is not the case with Classic WoW, despite being one of the most significant video games in history.)
---
&gt;No, I don't expect Blizzard to actually implement this
---
Dunno, this screams Activision
---
I love it.
---
We can't be the policemen of every realm, just ours. It's up to the people of your realm to rise up and force the streamers off.
---
I like it more than adding new content.
---
He said he doesnt know him, you‚Äôre gonna say its fair to judge someone you dont know based off people complaining about them?
---
I don‚Äôt get the pipe organ.
---
This was how Vanilla was in my experience. Filled in on a raid, class lead (Hunter) noticed I wasn't daft and asked if I'd like to join. Then he set up an interview which consisted of me meeting him in Burning Steppes and helped him farm leather for the guild and FR gear. He made me kite, trap, and otherwise showcase my skills. Told me it would be a day or so while he chatted with senior guild management and then I was formally offered a spot in the guild and raid. 
---
I sincerely loved and valued that guild because of that.
---
Actually sounds pretty cool, although I'm sure the #nochanges mob is still going to downvote you
---
Thanks! üòÅ
---
So you are gonna seek them out and disrupt all the research people did to avoid playing with them?
---
I'm not talking about the streamers (obviously?)...lol
---
Till the streamers go to your server that you picked because it had no streamers
---
As evidenced by the Beta, streamers wield an enormous amount of power and influence over their chosen realm that simply isn't available to non-streamers. We don't want players on our realm receiving thousands of PMs every time they interact with a streamer, especially if it's to the streamer's disadvantage.
---
Amen
---
I focused a lot in vanilla on profs, and learned arcanite transmute at 36 or so. I remember people often wouldn‚Äôt give me the mats required because they didn‚Äôt even think it was possible for someone lvl 36 to get that high level ability.
---
Who the fuck has an issue with Venruki?

Healer -&gt; everything that makes other players not die.
---
Support -&gt; everything that enhances other players so they can perform their rol better.
---
Even you said it:
---
&gt;Totem twisting Windfury totem and Grace of Air totem to buff the warriors or Rogues, Strength of Earth totem to buff the melee, Fire Resistance totem for MC or Frost Resistance totem for Naxx
---
All this enhances what the other players need to do
---
I find it people funny people are excited and encouraging this guy not realizing hes trying to disrupt all the efforts people are going through to avoid the streamers
---
Will that addon still work though?
---
I don't think forcing your friends to watch something is the best way to go about it.
---
I think you should encourage them to try the game at launch and if they like it, cool, but if they don't then don't push it or you might push them away.
---
There's no way for us to know if streamers will be on our chosen realm until Launch day, which is 14 days before all of us will be picking a realm. We're not seeking them out. If they choose a realm that isn't ours, they're safe.
---
On August 12th, there will be a post that says:
---
Streamers are not welcome on [X]! Be warned, our coalition has every intention of disrupting your gameplay through constant griefing to such an effect that you will have no choice but to go somewhere else.
---
Anyone that wishes to avoid streamers is free to join us.
---
Thats gorgeous.
---
Sword racial is still good for rogues but definitely better for warrior.
---
Rogues get 5 weapon skill from talents so not having the racial isn‚Äôt as important. It will hurt your dps a little bit (since your glancing blows will deal less damage than if you were human). However since you get 5 skill from talents you don‚Äôt need 9% hit from gear and can cap specials with 6% still.
---
What‚Äôs making you change your mind?
---
RemindMe! 78 days
---
Okay that's fair but there are a fair bit of efforts and resources going up to track where streamers will go
---
Not by as much as say a dps warrior who is gnome compared to human. Difference being talents. Rogues get weapon skill there warriors don‚Äôt.
---
Let me throw an analogy out there for all of you worried about streamers impacting your vanilla experience. You(Classic Player) are equivilant to a citizen of Los Angeles, California.(Classic WoW community) Right now the only way for you to live in LA is to watch live recordings from Celebrities(Streamers) at the Studio.(Classic Beta) So your worldview is super narrow because you don't understand how many more Citizens are going to exist in your world in LA once it's ready compared to how many you see in the Studio. You're worried that you won't be able to leave your apartment and conduct your daily routine without running into a Celebrity causing a fuss and ruining your LA experience. Doesn't that sound rediculous? Don't worry about the celebrities or their paparatzi followers. The only way to interact with them will be if you actively seek them out. If you really hate them so much, you have nothing to worry about.

The irony of this sub's "Wahh Streamers" demographic calling anyone an "entitled manbaby" is pretty damn funny.
---
You need more than one person with Aqual Quintessence until that person is going to make multiple trips to Azshara mid-raid to get enough for all the runes.
---
Are you not choosing a realm on August 12th?
---
Because if you are, you will have no idea where the streamers are. Most of them are pledging to keep their realm choice a secret until August 26th.
---
Or get a cat for stealth pvp tricks
---
Username checks out
---
This is 12 year old news
---
I know it‚Äôs been 15 years, but I don‚Äôt recall the economy being absurdly bloated pre-TBC. Obviously, the prior knowledge of farming will allow for the top tier to amass gold/mats/BoE‚Äôs quicker, but the majority of the player base that will be well behind will force it to still stay somewhat reasonable I would think.
---
Some of those values change too depending on what gear you have. At least for dps feral some times Agi&gt;Str and sometimes Str&gt;Agi. In the earlier tiers they're fairly close together, but since Agi is significantly better if you also want to tank it is usually a good idea just to go for Agi gear. Shedo made a really great simulator with options to change gear. It will be really useful for deciding what gear you will want and it even automatically generates the stat weights of Str and Agi.
---
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SlB9gHufWFvQ5cs8dVXZOAftup-WteZ3
---
Just to be clear, you do realize you're doing the exact same thing the streamer communities are doing, right?
---
I watched an interview where the specifically said they were making new names for the classic servers, this has been confirmed. Ill try and find it.
---
still got mine on photobucket and my private server.
---
Mostly based on the surveys.
---
I just watched that episode of Sunny a couple days ago lol
---
Designed by the same guy who designed the shape of the monastery south of Ardougne, a city in old school RuneScape
---
Okay now that i know what your idea is i apologize 
---
It seemed like tou were seeking out a streamer server and trying to disrupt things
---
Personally the serenity now video always gets me hyped.
---
Also illegal danish is good for a laugh. There is another machinima series called Zinwrath (I think not sure on that) it was also a great watch too.
---
Hybrid DPS is worse than you can imagine if you're not optimized for it. A cat druid with significant prep work and bags of consumables will deal literally less than *half* the damage of a rogue, fury warrior, mage, or warlock in Naxx.
---
The idea is to not spread the gap between new 60 and naxx people
---
Ty bro, it's actually from like 1970 so its a bit different from current maps. I always loved maps
---
True, you can get BT while leveling though so it helps there. Definitely would get a ZG bat over BT if I was a hunter.
---
Only time I played on a RP PVP server. Grouped with a bunch of low level dwarfs going to kill a dragon or somesuch. Logged out, deleted my character.
---
Can't into roleplay.
---
Yea, that's true.
---
I'm of two minds on it.
---
On one hand I want people to be able to enjoy Classic without any changes, they deserve it.
---
On the other hand, there are some things that can be improved in a Old School Runescape style fashion.
---
I hope for at least 1-2 years the classic servers will stay the same.
---
Also not news cause it‚Äôs wrong.
---
Fuck off SJW?
---
Yeah but have you tried DMT though?
---
Shockadin is good every three minutes.  Otherwise you are cleansing and healing.

Who levels that before brd haha

---
You've been quoted in an article.
---
hahahaha. woops.
---
Some random neckbeards making noise doesnt mean shit. Streamers with millions of followers each making noise does. They wouldn't be giving out beta access to every streamer if they didnt know they'd make it more popular.
---
&gt; Show me the polls.
---
[This] (https://goo.gl/forms/AqaWJCvMeAwMJrYq1) is the primary one I'm aware of (corresponding reddit thread [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/)), though there may well have been others I missed.
---
Looking at [the results] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics), RPvP comes in at 1,528 vs. 457 for normal RP - over four times as many votes. Note, as well, this was before Ion declared RPvP "too niche" to include at launch. If anything, interest in the former has only increased since then.
---
To be clear, a Google Docs survey on an enthusiast subreddit several months before we even got a release date isn't exactly hard numbers, but it's the closest we have and at least goes some way to demonstrating the demand for that option.  I'd rather like to see another one done now we have that info and the release of the beta has piqued the attention of so many and increased traffic here so dramatically.
---
Of course such a survey done now would naturally be subject to some degree of bias on the part of those with an axe to grind over being told we can't play on the server type we'd originally intended, but I think there could still be some useful information gleaned from it.
---
More to the point, I simply don't trust the "Blizzard has the numbers" narrative.
---
On the one hand, RPvP servers weren't first rolled out until nearly a year after WoW first launched, meaning many of those who might have liked to play on such a server had probably already established themselves elsewhere and weren't willing to forsake all the progress and (more importantly) community connections they'd made there in order to reroll.
---
On the other hand, any numbers Blizzard has which are in any way based on retail are functionally useless given how much the game has changed over the years and the different demographic(s) to which Classic will undoubtedly appeal.
---
It's entirely possible I'm wrong about that, of course. Wouldn't be the first time, won't be the last. To my thinking, however, we'll never really know unless Blizzard gives the RPvP crowd a genuine chance to prove our numbers right out the gate with Classic.
---
For all we know, you were the crybaby who's flaming Soda for not getting your way.
---
Yeah none of the tier sets have spell hit for druid until AQ and even then few and far between.
---
Why not just play with friends and guildies then?
---
Yeah that's kinda where I am at, give people capital "C" Classic.
---
And then at some point you gotta move on.
---
I'm sure there are people that would love endless server resets, but to me that is the most boring possible option.
---
Reroll on a new server.
---
Don‚Äôt be a tool, he‚Äôs a streamer, the entire horde side of project 60 knew he was a whiner about p70

https://www.wowhead.com/spell=24752/mark-of-the-wild
---
Common practice to gank the maintank of a rival guild for an entire day to make them not raid, why would a few hours of streamer ganking be an issue?
---
MAKE IT STOP
---
Lmao, they will be more geared than you
---
lol wtf that's a first. I only had 11 upvotes on a thread with 57 comments, too.
---
Thank you.
---
After reading here that Bears cant tank i decided to not go druid.
---
Your comment changed my decision.
---
Gnome is best for pvp, you lose like 5% dps over a human rogue tho. Forgot the exact number but weaponskill is big.
---
Eh, I guess it's fair. I've had a bad day and kind of took it out on him and it wasn't the most appropriate response. That being said, though. What Zalsaria said is unfounded, but it contributes a little, "Wont happen." is literally meaningless and is unfounded
---
I wouldn't know, maybe you're right
---
Joana is Horde. In order for a Troll to get an Owl, he'd have to corpse run to Dark Shore, through an alliance capital city, and then tame the only low level owl spawn. Then he'd have to run to Westfall and tame a carrion bird to teach his owl screech. As a low level Horde.
---
Of course he's not using an owl. That would be stupid.
---
You know what faction and race doesn't need to make major sacrifices for an owl? Alliance night elves, which can do that on their leveling route anyways.
---
Compared to other realms it was small barely any guild did the high end content in BC in fact the farthest they got was Brutalus that is pathetic.  The top guild couldn't even kill the LK Heroic till Cata launched.  This is not normal server progression in the slightest.  Not to mention that same top guild abandoned the server in Cata because there was not enough people who could do endgame content for them to recruit.
---
https://realmpop.com/us.html  
---
Just  look at the numbers Ravenholdt is currently one of the lowest populated server at the moment yes it may have not been the lowest back in BC/Wrath it's clear that the sever never had a chance compared to actual PVP and PVE servers.
---
depends if a guy corps camps you for multiple hours it is griefing blizzard even said so, it is onbly griefing when it is abused to the max.
---
It was a 1 hour cooldown if you used the group to summon it. Alliance could simply walk to the graveyard across the river, south of goldshire. Use detect greater invisibility for lvl 51 ghosts and curse of doom them until a doomlord spawned. Enslave and walk back to goldshire, then let all hell loose.  The ghosts were awesome for farming soul shards as well.
---
So if a player reincarnates every class 3 times:
---
* 9% total mana, for every class they play
---
* 9% movement speed, for every class they play
---
* 6% SPDH, for every class they play
---
* 3 Defense and 3% hit OR 9 blanket resistance, for every class they play (the Paladin one is way OP over the Shaman one btw)
---
* 9% more Spirit, for every class they play
---
* 3% crit, for every class they play
---
* 9% more total HP, for every class they play
---
* 6% more physical damage, for every class they play
---
* +3 to every stat and +5 to every tradeskill, for every class they play
---
That's 8 * 3 speedruns, or roughly 100 days /played
---
The problem is that no guild would gear up someone only for them to decide to do this. You'd have to do it all before you planned to hit any sort of hardcore end-game content.
---
I was literally hoping someone would do this.  I don't hate streamers, but I don't want to play with them either.  I just want a normal WoW experience.  Thank you for making this, I will be using this during character creation.
---
2h fury on horde exists due to windfury totem. Otherwise no.
---
I guess i could see it being kind of cute. Like a lil level 1 poppin sodas
---
Thats because Youtube wasn't huge back in vanilla. Now there are 100's of videos going over everything. It's also possible private servers fucked up the drop rate of things massively, but if they didn't then the gold economy will not be anything like actual vanilla.
---
Dude, streamers weren‚Äôt even around back then. Like I said, people have been wanting it since wrath. 
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúrandom neckbeards‚Äù, it‚Äôs been most of wow‚Äôs population. 
---
Making noise does mean shit because that‚Äôs why Blizz developed classic.
---
J. Allen Brack even says that when they revealed it was in the making. 
---
Blizz is trying to make it more popular by giving the beta keys to streamers, but streamers absolutely did NOT get Blizz to develop classic. It was the fans making a shit load of noise. Streamers came after the fact.
---
1.12 AV lasts like 30minutes, it's a boss rush.
---
They could start streaming at level 5, put a black bar overlay over their name and character so you dont know who to search for on /who or what they look like
---
I like how you have a headphone stand but then put them on the monitor anyways
---
It's the ultimate hybrid!
---
He was in summit's chat saying he'll be maining WoW for at least two months after classic drops. Dunno if he'll actually stick to that, though
---
Are they going to sell a physical collector's edition for classic? I'd pay a ton for one.
---
Load up on meat vendor in Darnassus
---
Cataclysm I think had throw dung on monkeys.
---
R11 is still a 90% discount on epic mount.
---
R12+ rival BWL gear.
---
and that only apply to the very few people who enjoy both high-end pve and pvp.
---
and there's still nothing to say that because you have raid gear, you'll enjoy the inevitably unbalanced nature of WPvP as opposed to BG...
---
Why do you even cling to this? WPvP died when BG came out in 2005, blizz tried a hundred time to spark it back up, never worked. Pservers tried... neverworked. Wpvp won't be a thing when BGs are out. All the evidence we have points toward that, you just have wishfull thinking.
---
Yes. My worst fear is ending up on the same server as one of these people.  Just let me avoid you and Im fine.
---
scrub says "Hmm?"
---
This is the dumbest idea I have ever heard and will kill wow faster than BFA. You‚Äôre completely changing the dynamic of the game at that point. Might as well make a new one all together...
---
you don't need hydraxian rep no, you can do a questchain and get the douse. you don't need 2 tranq shots no, you can rotate warriors with shield wall/last stand and manage with 1 single tranq shot. you can get FR gear that's much weaker than the crafted epics and still manage, if you have 3 druids in your raid you can allow the main tank to get blown up 3 times really... then again you can have 3 warriors ready. let us not forget about mind controlling the orc in LBRS to buff your tanks with that FR buff. downing ragna week 1 comes down to finding enough people that will level fast enough, there is no difficulty at all
---
the reason why owls are so good is because their screech causes alot of threat, so you can basically multishot instantly on pulls and you wont pull adds. It's not the end of the world if you do pull as a hunter because you have FD but it's still really nice to not have to worry about it
---
It releases end of August. The kids and neck beards will go back to school or their proper parental basements.

You‚Äôre right pets scale 0 in Classic/vanilla. Warlock or hunter doesn‚Äôt matter your pet gets nothing from you.
---
If by brace, they mean avoid, then yeah I‚Äôm bracing real hard.
---
I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm wasting my time with you. 
---
You‚Äôre with the cult.

You can avoid private players by not participating in progression guilds, that's where you will find them. Or any noteworthy pvp premade.
---
Basically, play casually.
---
Wow didn‚Äôt know about those ghosts. And until you mentioned it I had forgotten about curse of doom! It was freaking awesome. It was a 1 minute countdown and then it exploded with quite a big hit with a chance of summoning the demon. 
---
I was thinking about rolling something else since I was a lock in vanilla, but this whole thread is making me want to do it all again.
---
I understand doing it in phases to make wpvp relevant and not outclass early raid gear but it will kinda suck to not have bgs to play throughout the lvling process. 
---
This will probably mean I roll lock instead of priest purely because I wont get to bg as shadow while lvling and I don't have time to farm money to constantly switch specs for bgs and raiding at max level. :(
---
Wanting to stay away from hate doesn't equal hate and where have I ever been racist??
---
I'm just going to pick a server like a normal person. Server is what the server is.  Honestly though, i would rather end up on the same server as a streamer than entitled cry baby p server players, your no better than anyone else. This shit seriously needs to stop. These types of threads should be removed.
---
Naw, you wear cloth spell crit gear
---
True. But you‚Äôll be capping your dps lower than it needs to be. Its tbh not a big enough deal to switch off a race you prefer unless youre shooting for hardcore raiding
---
&gt;  It's pretty clear what the original comparison is about.
---
That they're both top heavy power houses who punch shit to death. I didn't get the racist complaint until you started projecting. 
---
I actually assumed this whole argument was because of the rape charges, not his race. I feel like you're grasping for straws here and looking to be offended... Maybe you can just take the comparison at face value instead of throwing the race card at every opportunity?
---
Hmm?
---
[Or your funeral.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ)
---
'Course, I'm of the opinion that was an absolutely brilliant play by Serenity Now. Led to more world PvP than had been seen in months on their server.
---
That's exactly the kind of thing I'd *want* to happen on an RPvP server.
---
it is not needed for the entire raid to wear FR, shamans have FR totem palas have FR aura + mind controlling that mob in LBRS for the FR buff, combine that with 2 fire pots during the fight and you are set as a non-tank
---
Because the solution, get more people or leave the area is i side the game, where quit doing your job isn't inside the game.
---
160+ hardcore players that have every intention of clearing MC in week one and then splitting up into 20 mans to get 2x the loot?
---
No, they really won't.
---
Even if they match us in leveling speed and somehow get into a week one run where every single piece of loot goes to them, they'll be 80 of us corpse camping and chain CCing them and 80 of their own faction stealing mobs, filling their bags with Heavy Leather Balls, filling their mailbox with Peeling the Onion, etc.
---
They won't stand a chance.
---
Fury tanks are I'm pretty sure a Pserver only thing bc that confirmed parry chance on higher level mobs. So bosses will be parrying much more often which means much more dps onto the fury tank in return.
---
Come back when you've spent a few months at level cap and endgame and let me know how you feel. You don't get exposed to the toxicity below level 60 when all the toxic players have been 60 for months.
---
What is there to handle.  If in the old days I went on the realm forums and posted "hey guys in im Feralas right now being a douche, I dare you to come try and kill me" id expect a lot of people to take the challenge.
---
What streamers do is no different.  They publicly broadcast their location and often times act in selfish douchie ways.  People come and kill them.  I don't see a problem here.
---
And I'd rather play on a server without any of them.
---
This must have been near end of vanilla I dont remember dps meters being a thing back then.
---
They will be doing the same thing and get priority loot.
---
They will dedicate way more time to the game than you.
---
They will be HWL and you won't
---
I am 100% in line with your thinking.
---
What addons do you use to have movable character frames, and a clean looking above-enemy hp bar? Or do they come as you have them in the beta?
---
At least in vanilla couldn't move frames like that without addons and hp bar above enemies looked annoying.
---
Confirmed already that they will be making new names for the servers. This interview (question is at 7:25):

Hitting 60 was so hard as a warrior it was an achievement worth screenshoting
---
Ok but wouldn't really make a difference at all. Might slow someone down 15 mins I guess.
---
there is no brd questline, it is literally 1 single quest that you can complete in 10 minutes via jumping from the bridge. the douse you can aoe farm for it a bit, 2-3 hours. hitting 60 is doable in 5 days played which means if you rotate 2 players per character and keep leveling 24/7 you will have 1 day and a half or more to do all this
---
Diffuse across servers and not announce their server I mean. I doubt they'll all congregate on the one server.
---
Unless they are getting sniped by another streamer with video proof, there is no way to even prove someone is being "sniped". 
---
Just chance PvP coincidence out in the world that results in the streamers death.  Happens all the time.
---
Why does everyone on this sub dick ride streamers, I‚Äôll never know. People don‚Äôt realize how fucking astronomical of an impact a streamer will have on a realm.
---
This guy gets it
---
I think blizzard should only allow streamers to name a main once, and it should be the name that everyone knows and would try to impersonate. I feel like that is fair. Any other name should be fair game. Im not asmongold so why would I want that name? But there are some sick fucks out there.
---
They were definitely a thing but pretty awful. Didn't tell you numbers just bars of who did the most damage
---
Running classic maxed out at 120+fps is my 2006 self's pipe dream. I'm so stoked
---
No, you're not understanding. We're starting this on Day 9 of Classic Launch (right after we all kill Rag). They will be gone long before any loot matters and any PVP ranks are available.
---
lol no
---
That's honestly comedy gold.  
---
Lost in the middle of winterspring, camera **abnormally** zoomed-in, visibly just mouse-clicked the execute that killed the yeti that dinged you 60, said yeti's feet taking 1/3 of the picture, some random bear just got agroed, for some reason using **a pouch full of ammo** as a warrior...  
---
What is going on here ?
---
Lol I see probably why I dont remember them I was a priest anyhow. Healing the MT was my objective
---
Yikes...
---
In DDO, reincarnation is what people do between content patches. It's what keeps the game interesting, allowing you to increase your character's strength even during lulls in progression. When a new raid is released, you usually stop reincarnating and have your main character at max level, ready to go. Then, once the new content is cleared, you go back to reincarnating.
---
Maybe soda should learn to make some friends to deal with pvp griefers... you know, the same way 99% of the player-base handles corpse campers.
---
I did think about adding that, but popularity does not correlate to how disruptive they will be. The site is also more about the players experience than the streamer. I didn't want to create a chart that was boasting who is the more popular streamer etc. I do appreciate your feedback though (as I did struggle with this while making the site)!
---
Wpvp tierlist, assuming solo? Something like this:
---
top is best, bottom worst.
---
Hunter - whoever you want to kill will die, cheetah ensures no one can escape or touch you in combat except mages you let into your deadzone + bad pet management, a rogue outgearing you (or you suck, otherwise your pet solo's the rogue below lvl 60, lvl 60 you use anti-venom for crippling and then its already gg) stealthing or warrior charge you forgot to keep in combat. Basically, hunter owns the world.
---
Mage - Super versatile, can reset endlessly. Also good at killing stuff and can 1vX. Engineering super good here.
---
Rogue - Not much to say, own shit with thistle tea and cooldowns or not pick a bad fight.
---
Shaman - Harder to gear but rather durable, can stomp mediocre mages but a top tier mage is rough as fuck. High burst, versatility and interruption, can heal. Rogues hate good shamans, can't do shit to hunters who play maxrange.
---
Priest - Not too good on their own, harder to kill if priest is good but manaburn and dot is all they have to kill.
---
Warrior - trash solo, mid tier with healers.
---
Outside the realm of the tierlist
---
Druid - lol, you won't kill anyone. You bore them to death with 3minute long dot fights. No one bothers with you because killing a druid takes way too much effort.
---
Paladin - You cannot kill anyone, no one can kill you.
---
gamechanger once AQ gear hits
---
Warlock - Undisputed god, no one can beat you. AQ gear warlock, especially SL spec, is gamebreaking and will pretty much kill pvp just like always.
---
Mage - instants deal fucktons of damage.
---
Rogue - kill everyone in open
---
Shaman - oneshot.
---
Warrior - auto loses to classes above but can get lucky and deal 80%HP in charge stun.
---
Priest - die.
---
Druid - actually useless now.
---
Paladin - still immortal.
---
wPvP relies on engineering and using items, all classes work. Group pvp is better tho.
---
Lost me at week 1 rag kill.
---
Betcha that won't happen.
---
You can heal just fine as Shadow
---
That's a really good point actually. I think you made the right decision not just listing straight numbers then.
---
I don't like it, it makes it so you can't actually play on one character only, and that should be a criteria. It is heavily immersion breaking and a sort of hamster wheel mechanic to simply keep people occupied for a longer time and play everything, but still not indefinitely as a sandbox mechanic would so it's not very good at even that.
---
I value the effort though and there certainly are broader designs that could make the game more interesting, just not this one as I see it.
---
Players couldn't target other players through the raid UI until patch 1.5, and you couldn't drag and drop to have party frames displayed on your screen until patch 1.6, which was Blackwing Lair's release. Early raids of Molten Core and Onyxia were much more party-centric since people couldn't check on other raid members without clicking on the actual character.
---
noob
---
Tarutaru Bard/rdm here appreciating the post üòÅ
---
Lol so I take it you‚Äôve already played on a classic server with a single big streamer on it. Surely you wouldn‚Äôt make such a statement based on an assumption!
---
It is entirely possible.
---
Oh it's definitely happening. We've got 40 players all with sub 100 hour 1-60 times and another 60+ farming for them, summoning them, crafting for them, etc. All our key players have 3 people leveling them round the clock. We've been practicing and have it down pat.
---
One time i pawed a guys thigh and he moaned
---
And to spam moonfire on every enemy.
---
If that character motion while riding is actually in the beta, it's totally unacceptable. Looks ridiculous.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a 10 hour window after the first person bangs the gong.
---
Wpvp wont be larger prior to bg's.
---
Rankers will simply camp flight points.
---
For a warrior I would say it‚Äôs worth switching. Rogue not as much. Even though you‚Äôre right it will still lower your dps as either class.
---
I used to friend everyone who buzzed me, it felt like a rare sight.
---
Being ten was a simple time.
---
Its more if they xfer to another server
---
Where have you read that it doesn't stack? Everything I have read in my limited search pointed to it stacking with either roar or shout, but not both.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take a high iq to know that a streamer can summon hundreds of players at his command, that shit is huge when it comes to classic in multiple circumstances.
---
Got my first 1g at level 14 and around 2g at level 16. This is possibly by paying attention, which mobs do drop grey/white stuff, that is worth a few pennys and drops often enough and then grind a little bit, because you need to make up some xp from time to time anyways.
---
Took me 12hours to level 16 which is okay, not super fast but also not extremly slow (also did one run of rfc).
---
Lmao they will be clearing rag too
---
Mortal Strike is above DoT's but below curses, it's medium priority.  I think it can push off vulnerabilities (like shadow weaving, winter's chill, etc.)
---
So there's actually this other version of WoW that Blizzard made. Not many people have heard of it, but a lot of these streamers do come from it. It's called "Battle for Azeroth" and a lot of these claims about streamers are actually just observations from this version of WoW applied to Classic realms.
---
It's 10 hours, not 24.
---
Griefing is still a bannable offense so if it's something repeated and/or organized and deliberate they'd just ban the offenders and move on.
---
Your damage will be low and you'll potentially push off important damage buffs by using mortal strike.
---
No not at all. Regardless of race, swords are often the best choice for Rogues. Anyone who tells you that swords are frowned upon for ANY race of rogue is full of s***.
---
I will agree this is a far more interesting conversation topic than most of the common change-requests. Especially since it‚Äôs used in another MMO.
---
That alone should deserve some upvoting :)
---
How are you this dense?
---
If, in week one, every T1 &amp; T2 piece drops for their class and every other item that drops goes to them - it still won't matter.
---
Try and organzie pvp to hold the horde off
---
That's a really good way to think about it. I considered rejuvenation part of the basic healing tool kit for Druids especially with liberal usage of potions and smart spirit usage. The big plays though are huge mana sinks like high rank healing touches and regrowths, using natures swiftness, using innervate, using battle rez, even using tranquility (which is rare as fuck but has happened on occasion). Thats saying nothing of popping into animal forms and using other druid utility.
---
God being a druid is so gangster.
---
If any guild does it werk 1 its his.
---
I know guilds will attempt it. Like method
---
Idk what guild this guy is in tho
---
Lol as if any streamer is an issue on any bfa server. Bfa is so radically different from classic for there to be any comparison there.
---
They will have 200+ guidmembers
---
Where do we sign up?
---
I think this is the right way to think about HoT's, they are ideal for giving you time to regen and to keep peripheral guys topped up to focus the healing stream towards players who really need it. The one exception is using Druid's swiftmend which somewhat incentivizes Druid's to lazily use HoT's as a back up mechanism which, without some intelligent use, threatens their mana pool.
---
He's been on KT for a decade. More likely he dies than transfer. Also if he does transfer he could transfer to the realm you rolled on. That would be ironic.
---
They have 200 ungeared spergs
---
Vs 80 to 100 people who have no lived pservers for years
---
You‚Äôre projecting again fam
---
I've done this a bunch of times, especially in encounters were players take DoT's or peripheral splash damage. I love turning on the fucking mana juice taps, slamming pots and runes, watching the blue dragon go off while innervate and just seeing people pop back to life like its nothing,
---
Giving a streamer the benefit of the doubt over the word of some angry redditor is hardly whiteknighting.
---
200 guild members that all push as hard as we do? I doubt it. But it still won't matter. The same faction griefing will make them miserable by itself.
---
Hypeeeee.  Good to know, thanks.
---
For the ones that do roll on PvP, I'm in.
---
I don't "know" any streamer.  I "know" their streamer personality, some are assholes, and I judge them for that.
---
What part of that is complicated?
---
'charms' is vague though. fear DRs with seduce and I wouldn't classify fear as a 'charm'.
---
&gt;No amount of gear lets a single person beat even a 5 man team, let alone an 80 man team.
---
200 spergs &gt; 80 geared no lifers
---
!Remind me 67 days
---
I guess we wont know the servers till after launch...
---
Same here. I‚Äôm questioning playing EU or NA for an RP server.
---
I admire your efforts and attention to detail. :)
---
He mentioned other guilds too
---
I dknt think the will of spergs will be strong enough
---
!RemindMe 60 Days
---
Yes, i too would give a streamer who has thrown a fit over not getting his way several times on camera the benefit of the doubt. 
---
Contrary to popular belief, someone disliking something does not make them ‚Äúangry‚Äù about it, whereas blindly defending someone while ignoring the fact that it‚Äôs been shown he acts that way repeatedly in the past, IS whiteknighting.
---
I'm counting on streamers to bring the sheep to the slaughter.  Mass pvp isn't about numbers once you reach a certain amount it's about tactics. I've shit on 100 people with 20 before and I'll do it again.
---
Lol, im not trying to get you or anything, dude. Im just saying that when a streamer leaves a server, it tends to die, it happened on retail multiple times if i remember correctly. Swifty is an exemple of that, he left darkspear and the server died right after that.
---
Yeah, the problem is with sharding. Layering is login-wide, though, so you only change layers when you log out, not when you change zones. So no pop in.
---
You arent even the person who said he doesnt know asmon, what the fuck are you getting indignant for that person for?
---
I advocate gnome! Better for pvp and all competitive guilds will WANT to split rogues between dagger vs sword spec anyways for loot distribution.
---
You‚Äôll do fine dps with combat daggers and eventually amazing dps with seal fate. 
---
Nelf and Dwarf priest is a diff story :‚Äô)
---
GL with your imaginary guild.
---
They can just block you and report you if you spam heavy leather balls
---
My mental image for a spell caster always brought me back to this image, no matter the iP. Caster with glasses/quill pen with massive tome, in a cramped library type room with a lot of books and artifacts. 
---
In fact my girlfriend and I commissioned a coworker of ours to create art for our pregnancy announcement and we wanted to go a route similar to this. Here‚Äôs a link to the artists page and the work we commissioned. 
---

r/imverybadass
---
"No amount of gear lets a single person beat even a 5 man team, let alone an 80 man team."
---
Whats your plan if the streamers are same faction?
---
I miss the times when Classic was discussed on this forum. Even the "what happens after Classic" threads are better than this garbage. I don't get it. You finally have actual content to talk about but you just go for internet celebrity drama instead.
---
Me fucking too man. I have a fear that I‚Äôll pick a server and my faction will be outnumbered 1 to 10
---
Well if you're aware of big streamers rolling on Central/Eastern servers for example, then rolling on a West Coast server will likely be a safe bet.
---
There are little ways you can make a safe choice. It's no guarantee, but can highly reduce your chance to land on the streamer servers which haven't been announced sometime after August 13th.
---
This is my main concern.  I couldn't care less about the streamer themselves, its literally only one person, but the legion of fucking retards that follow them and spam chat in game about them or group gank anyone who gets too close to them, or whatever is fucking ridiculous.  Way beyond any followings well known players had back in the day on their individual servers.
---
Yes I am a master tactician and a born leader.  Plebs beware.
---
&gt; All our key players have 3 people leveling them round the clock. We've been practicing and have it down pat.
---
I'm sure it's been a while since you've played an actual blizzard game, but account sharing is bannable these days.
---
most of my pvp was getting ganked by higher levels or them fleeing if we were about the same level. only time i ever had "good" pvp was when my hunter was camping a pet in wrath and i killed a player in max pvp gear. we went 3-4 battle but once they realized when they knocked me out of the sky they had to fight my pet, and take arcane shots from me, untill my parachute ended they gave up.
---
This sub realllllyyyy blows this streamer shit out of proportion. Really only a small handful of streamers have a real following, that being Asmon, Esfand, staysafe,Tips, and Soda. Probably missed a couple, but they‚Äôll be on their own server.
---
This isn‚Äôt some big full scale war
---
the guy who has to half over a million dollars by now, yet still looks like he hasn't showered in weeks? Yeah probably not.
---
Haha yeah my iq must not be high enough. 
---
You think a big streamer could get people to contribute to the war effort? You mean the thing that will be finishing very quickly on every server regardless? And farming spots? What? They‚Äôll get hundreds of people to farm too much stuff?
---
The only issue is faction balance. They can‚Äôt do anything that a big guild can‚Äôt do.
---
Why are you so concerned about peoples feelings towards streamers?
---
No he said 160, half alliance half horde.
---
I don't think Mage color changed. If it did, this happened in early Vanilla.
---
I played Alliance and my cousin who introduced me to the game played Horde. I was aware that Paladins and Shamans shared pink, and was also aware of Shaman taking on a rich blue in TBC but I'm almost positive that Mage was always a light blue, at least post 1.9.
---
They won't have 80 geared players either
---
Well, we know that streamers are irrelevant since Kotaku are speaking about it.
---
Yeah, they're wrong. All items will be in their 1.12 state but not all items will be in at the start. Expect progressive loot tables/rep items.
---
Has Blizzard gotten this SJW that a penis joke is bad?
---
Yes it's skillful and yes I dislike them that much.  
---
How skillful is it to broadcast your location?  Not very
---
I'm playing classic for one purpose to destroy streamers
---
I don‚Äôt, i never claimed to be concerned about it. I‚Äôm not the one fighting on someone else‚Äôs behalf. You took over the argument for a person who said they dont know who asmon is, after i stated that you cant just judge someone you dont know about.
---
Ill just be over here in Australia watching all this shit unfolding and laughing.
---
Streamers are so fucking annoying lol. It‚Äôs just insane how thousands of people will give them gold for no reason like why?
---
&gt; Lied about playing vanilla.
---
Doesn't surprise me at all. Him explaining the same 'Effort = Sense of achievement' concept every video gets old real quick.
---
Yes, Fire is optimal everywhere except MC/Ony/BWL. Unless you‚Äôre decked out in +frost damage gear.
---
Idk why you still would argue tho
---
The streamers that wanma keep there realm a secret will eventuality fail and then the floodgates of spergs open
---
Now everyone on that server who wanted to avoid streamers will be screwed.  If a group of people were to attempt to stand up for what they want then more power to them
---
are you asian?
---
Most streamer guilds are already formed and have had meetings on how to gear and min max for a week 1 clear
---
Eqiup bonuses do work, such as HoJ.  Druids can't use polearms in vanilla so no Halbred of smiting though.  Manual crowd pummeler is a requirement for raiding as feral for dps or tps on bosses.
---
Just takes one person who is watching to see themselves on the screen to instant pinpoint the server and name. With how packed the beginning zones are going to be it will not be hard to believe that a few of the audience will not notice and instantly spill the beans for everyone else to come over.
---
Play on an RP server. c:
---
It'll be my first time on an RP server but I'm hoping there'll be stuff like that and enough interest for a long-term community.
---
200 iq move. Guess my main is gonna be named Asmongold
---
This is exactly why I will take the loss of being behind a week of classic to make sure I don‚Äôt roll characters on their servers.
---
Well then it seems lile some good wpvp to come
---
i wish it was in drive not reverse
---
I was planning to... Now I'm between male Troll or female UD. My last character on a private server was a female Troll so that's not an option.
---
Only thing bothering me are those troll FEET.
---
I found it here
---
&gt; i stated that you cant just judge someone you dont know about.
---
And I stepped in and corrected you that yes, you can in fact judge someone you don't actually know, based on the public persona that they put out there for everyone to see.
---
The person you initially called out said he doesn't know him in the sense that he doesn't know the real person, not that he isn't familiar with the streaming persona.  You literally said in your first post its a character being played, as in, its not the real person, and he responded that he doesn't know the guy (in real life), but just because you play an asshole persona doesn't mean you aren't actually an asshole in real life as well.
---
How this is all beyond your mental grasp is a mystery, its not particularly complicated.  Go to bed and think it over tomorrow, chief.
---
wOrLd pVp iS DeAd
---
Not if its collusion between alliance and horde
---
This is beautiful. Aesthetically the coolest raid/boss they ever did. This makes me happy :) thanks for sharing
---
&gt;2 stacks please. Don't be stingy.
---
I need a reacharound first bro.
---
Well streaming wasn't a thing back in 2004.. so who cares?
---
Yeah, I dont think that will happen quickly
---
Never said it was..?
---
He doesnt know the public persona, you cannot judge someone you know nothing about. Chill dude, you dont always need to be outraged over everything
---
Only way to get them to play is convince them it's a big gaming experience that they should be a part of, even if it's just for launch.
---
Oh and mention it's only $15 - and tell them to give it a month :)
---
I'm not very knowledgable about private servers.  Why do you say they are inflating numbers?
---
hi
---
Fuck you're dense.
---
And i‚Äôm the angry redditor, right?
---
I started following him because his achievement/mount guides were the only ones that applied to soloing and weren't dogshit. I think he's entertaining but he can get obnoxious sometimes
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter that much IMO. I usually go for lower pop pve servers if I‚Äôm playing alone. The actual server doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
Putting SFW in the title just reinforces the misconception of RP in WoW being mostly ERP because of the Goldshire meme. Stop perpetuating it.
---
You must have played on a server with a big name streamer. Surely you wouldn‚Äôt make such a statement based on an assumption.
---
Ah shit lock that criminal up
---
Personally, I like what Square Enix did with Final Fantasy XI:  
---
At one point, the level cap was 75, and you did all of the expansion stories at level 75. However, even though your level was capped at 75, you never stopped leveling. That's because they (eventually, can't remember when) added Job Points. You keep getting experience points, and eventually unlock a point to permanently change an attribute on your character. Want more HP? Use a JP. Want more Mana? Use a JP. Want more threat for your Warrior? Use a JP.  
---
This way, even though you were capped for your level, there was still an incentive to keep leveling, so to speak. I think that's similar to the idea you have in mind.
---
Wheres the addon that adds flying mounts, LFD and LFR.
---
The stance blizz had in the past is that if u can deal with the problem by pvp its not banable griefing
---
we're in hell, but at least we have each other. "hell is other people" -sartre
---
Wasnt talking to you.
---
I was replying to 
---
&gt;Wait so do retail players intent to play really bad specs and force everyone else to carry them?
---
So yeah, that was saying that it was hard and you need a cookie cutter spec
---
I mean the fact that he mentioned law enforcement made it a joke that's pretty easy to see
---
This time around I think I'll just s ay, "Dont worry. I'll wait for you to eat and top your  health back off"
---
I think streamer team will win because most of them don't have adult responsibilities. I can outskill a fair amount of people with practice but I cant out nolife people sacrificing my family time to beat up on the people that have failed to launch.
---
That's pretty WeirdChamp. What a haHAA
---
I don't think Blizz really understand how big of a social deal buffs are. It's an easy, effortless way to do something nice for another player, to let them know you're a human and you think they're one as well without having to strike up a conversation. 
---
I had a very bizarre experience in the kindergarten where a druid stopped next to me and cast regrowth on me. Neither of us were in combat and it's not as if you need healing anyway. I gave him a healing touch in return and it just felt sad and empty.
---
Those guys have been playing classic pservers for years. Polishing theit leveling speed, questing routes and reaching near world record times. They know all vanilla tricks by heart. They remember pretty much all quests, bis gears, best talent specs etc. They also have years of vanilla pvp experience. Streamers that only been playing beta stand no chance at all. They will be beaten by experience alone.
---
I mean you still see chat, which seems to be most of what these people are complaining about.
---
You don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll reserve the names just like the did with the beta invites?
---
One of the draws of being a paladin is being the most annoying thing to kill.
---
Lmfao I smell you.
---
what a terrible mess of an analogy
---
Lol I really don‚Äôt understand what the point of that response was.
---
I was 13
---
That's all I can say
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
It's part of the fun. It's one way of overcoming challenges. Why let blizzard takes the meta game out of the game..
---
So have the streamers.
---
Is it, though? Legion is the only time where they had any of that since the end of Wrath, and it looks like they've dropped it again.
---
I‚Äôm curious though, why is undead considered better? Is this not due to the old way of thinking? Had you asked this question back in vanilla most would‚Äôve never considered orc racials being better than WotF. 
---
I‚Äôve not really seen any new opinions on best racials in TBC. Most of it is old.
---
As has been said, it‚Äôs 10 hours. Maybe that‚Äôs why you kisses it last time.
---
All indications are it‚Äôs the same this time around too
---
What's so bad about that? I mean I don't really watch streamers but why is it bad
---
Very entertaining read, but this was from right after patch 2.0 launched and locks turned into absolute monsters.
---
Dwarf priest healer
---
Week one rag kills lmfao
---
I mean, OP is a god damn moron if he can't realize having an asmongold or a soda on his server is going to be a bad time. Fucking mouthbreather
---
streamer man bad
---
Guild banks definitely.
---
I would advise to try out a pserver, as druid's in retail and vanilla are similar, but play out very differently. 
---
They have huge mana issues due to heals and shapeshifting costing a lot. Therefore, filling those different roles in a pinch is doable, but not as efficient.
---
Orc tank Warrior. If any plate gear drops it‚Äôll be yours
---
Without regard to whether it stacks with other AP debuffs, it is not worth 1/16 of your raid‚Äôs debuff capacity by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Dwarf for pvp imo. Stone form is godlike. Then human for pve imo. Gnome is in the middle imo
---
I'd say its be a few hours and by then theyd be ahead of everyone
---
Your inability to see the comparison is very enlightening and explains a lot. Thank you.
---
Only problem with this is MTs are not a good limited time role
---
I mean you're whining all over this sub, so your track record is no better.
---
My apologies then.
---
Dwarf priest, easily, everyone will want you for Fear Ward.
---
Sure dude.
---
Fair enough, honestly
---
My main has been a Death Knight since Wrath. I love their lore and play style and will miss them dearly(I already miss how they used to be), but I can‚Äôt wait to get back to basics.
---
To me, it‚Äôs a lot like my experience with d&amp;d. A lot of people think they need high level characters and crazy over-the-top fantasy to be entertained, but most of my best experiences, social, gameplay, and roleplay wise, have been during more down-to-earth type of adventures.
---
Classic is bringing WoW back down to Azeroth, so to speak.
---
Can someone please explain. I know i a cringe normie
---
That‚Äôs great that he‚Äôs a wholesome, modest guy... that says nothing about the fact that asshats flock around him like flies around a carcass.
---
I actually know nothing about him and his fans - I‚Äôm just agreeing with the other guy - streamers attract different types of fans. 
---
I personally just try to stay away from ‚Äúwell known‚Äù streamers on principle because I have been suspended for being in the same area as a streamer who‚Äôs fans were griefing - I was just in the area and got hit with the blanket suspension.
---
Rofl the new animations makes it look like your riding a rocking horse.
---
Wat?
---
There are tons of *American* farming bots/multiboxers on retail now.
---
What makes you think this is somehow going to disappear when classic drops?
---
Always loved this piece! Especially the sold out sign by the time of experience and the framed pic of a succubus.
---
My friend can I steal this idea from you and hopefully report back ?
---
To cat dps you need a very specific spec.  You can dungeon rank and raid heal with 0/30/21.  Your healing is missing about 10% healing, but you offset by 20% int.

Sharding :)
---
If I ran all of them it would be all mele specs yeah by perfect but easy kills
---
I read it stacks with druids roar and warriors shout, but not both. I will be researching this further.
---
No addon, it‚Äôs integrated into the client now.
---
lmao
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be going alliance yet. My friends are leaning horde right now
---
k
---
&gt; *What if I refuse to use the addon?*   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; When a player joins a group, the addon will alert other members to your  non-compliance. You will be sent a link to the download page of the  addon with instructions on how to install it. Your name will also be  added to another list within the addon. After 30 days from your alert,  you will automatically be added to the blacklist and be subject to the  same policies as streamers and their known associates. 
---
is this 1942 germany? wtf is the matter with you.
---
You really think Classic wow is the dawn?  That's quite sad.
---
This is the funny shit I read this subreddit for.
---
This is incredibly lame and won‚Äôt work/doesn‚Äôt even make sense. 
---
Seriously, if you want to be militant about something and organize there is plenty of awful shit happening in real life right now.
---
Ven averaged ~500 viewers up until a month ago. He's well known because he's a R1 Gladiator. He's not a streamer who gets swarmed by fans.
---
This has to be a joke, right? The word "cringy" lost its meaning a long time ago but I think this is the perfect case to use it.
---
Now THIS is some high effort pettiness.
---
This has to be a troll and can't be a serious.
---
This isn't even funny, just sad....that a group of people would try this hard to get streamers off a server.
---
You don't look smart. You look dumb as hell.
---
Good luck on the saddest crusade of all time, buddy.
---
Ok - apply the same comments to other streamers then.
---
Streamers can attract different crowds and those crowds can end up being royal twats to players just trying to enjoy their downtime.
---
Seems like such a concerted effort to pressure non-streamer players to get the add-ons would rub the blues the wrong way and may be against ToS in some way.
---
I feel like you'd have better success just using it against streamers and their guilds and only enforcing use of the add-on in your guild. You'll have all the good mats anyway, they'd die without access to the strongest guilds on the server and anyone who voluntarily joins that process.
---
Really amazing, I find it odd that all three pictures on the back are from raids though.
---
The addon only works if it reaches critical mass. We have no other choice but to enforce compliance.
---
He will be. I forget who's guild he's joining but he's gonna be their nightfall enhance shaman.
---
So this is what living in east berlin must've felt like. 
---
I realize this is probably satire.
---
Im glad there are non now. No temptation to play another rew thousand hours with all those mouthbreathing dramaqueens and dae streamers and their underlings.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. This entire sub is bashing streamers because they wanted to blacklist those royal twats so they might be deterred from causing shit like this.
---
Everyone is on the spectrum. That's why it's called a spectrum
---
Lol Jesus Christ man. 
---
I don‚Äôt see the point in making the comparison to my initial reply, but then following it up with ‚Äúlet me preempt your response well acktually...‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôll spell it out for you:
---
You compared my argument to your own, which implies you‚Äôre looking to argue about it, but then you followed it up with that condescending remark to I guess make me look stupid, or make me not want to counter your argument?
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you would even bother commenting when you clearly only want to hear from people that agree with you. Saying things like that to silence people that have a different opinion makes no sense unless all you‚Äôre interested in doing is circle jerking. 
---
I‚Äôm not going to bother replying to you anymore.
---
They're also not sure cancer like asmon and soda. They're living clickbait
---
I love you
---
I love you both
---
How much time are we talking. If you think you can consistently raid, orc warrior tank is best. If youre gunna be spotty priest is still best
---
But you can't enforce shit. You aren't blizzard and i'm 100% sure this is against TOS and you'll end up getting banned trying to police the server.
---
The war isn‚Äôt going to happen because the vast majority of the playerbase isn‚Äôt petty enough for this nonsense lol.
---
You couldnt be more wrong, sir.
---
shhh just let him get banned, the less people like him that exist in the game the better
---
If you like anime /r/ffxiv is that way
---
This is the most autistic shit I've ever read
---
That or warlocks that drop infernals in starting zones.
---
*You will comply. Resistance is futile.*
---
You cant be serious? If you want those changes then you can stay in OSRS.
---
spaghetti
---
&lt;3
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
This is the most autistic thing I‚Äôve seen today. Some people truly got too much time lmao
---
I have no idea what any of this means
---
It‚Äôs not bad. The only people who HATE streamers are kids who weren‚Äôt even born when wow released.
---
Why would they be annoying? Like... close Twitch or don't play on the same server? I think you're just salty and/or jealous.
---
Do you live in your mom's basement
---
i doubt it.
---
1. Blacklist addons already exist and are not against the EULA.
---
2. Addons that alert other players without the addon already exist and are not against the EULA.
---
3. Blizzard has never once banned a player for using an addon.
---
i think a hunter is better (even though he's not a hunter) simply for the shenanigans.  shit like eyes of the beast ganking in low level zones is totally tonpa.  maybe priest for mind control shit
---
He complained that his gf watches his stream so she knows what shirt he wears and he has to change shirt when he spends time with her.
---
Yeah you gank the wrong person you got retaliated by guildmates of that person. THATS FINE. Hell even encouraged. 
---
Now if you gank a streamer they want YOUR OWN FACTION TO RETALIATE AGAINST YOU. THATS NOT OK. 
---
Soda and Asmon pull 40k viewers each. Pop cap of 2.5k ish on a server, even if only 1% of their viewers roll on their server, that‚Äôs 800 people. A third of the entire server.
---
Same here my dude.... same here...
---
Why is this subs hard on for avoiding streamers? It‚Äôs kinda wack to me coming here to enjoy classic material as this isn‚Äôt really classic related. It kinda validates their opinions of this sub now that classic is coming. 
---
Like we‚Äôre making websites on how to avoid them? You don‚Äôt even know how many servers there will be and there‚Äôs no cross realm and most if not all will use the same server. So this is really just a waste of time to even make. 
---
Kinda sad tbh.
---
&gt; Of course he's not using an owl. That would be stupid.
---
He has 2 guides, one Horde, one Alliance. He specifically states in his guides that he uses cat because it has the highest DPS.
---
Dwarf Priest or Resto Shaman are the easiest ways to get a raid spot IMO.
---
Quickly getting gear though, that might be harder, especially as shaman. Hunters and Druids are more likely to get gear faster because they have less competition for gear, but hunters have more competition for the raid spots.
---
Resto Druid could be a decent idea for this, but you really shouldn't be basing your choices on these aspects. It's a long way to 60, and you should play a class that you enjoy before everything else.
---
No, I think it's the opposite. Old people hate streamers because they don't understand the appeal of Twitch in general.
---
It's a fan project, but you're forgiven for thinking it's the real thing.
---
Think you underestimate the power of stupid people in big groups, unfortunately.
---
This is basically raising the level cap just with 10x more experience to the next level. And just wait till you meet a bot/nolifer who has twice everyone stats and is now a GOD.
---
Their raid team may be full though, and even if they see me ahead of the pack with them, just don't have any need for my spec.
---
&gt;Meh we are in an indie game renaissance
---
More delusions.   Those indie games are all crap scrollers.
---
I'm going to be running a prot warrior, holy/prot pally, destruction warlock and two frost mages. I think the challenge of managing every role will add some excitement to leveling, and the variety to switch off will keep it fresh.
---
^
---
I cleared through MC Onyxia and ZG and have done parts of Naxx/AQ (But with DBM/research those last two won't be a problem either.)
---
I practice leveling routes using Joana's guide and I'm in the beta as well practicing 1-40.
---
You are very smart.
---
That is pretty cool. 
---
Though spending the time in gnomer and bagspace to have a +50% auto attack speed increase at all times to be "good enough" is pretty unappealing. How many weeks before you'd have been better off just leveling a rogue or whatever your preferred dps was?
---
I loved feral, did it a lot in vanilla, and I didn't feel like I fell behind considerably as a hybrid until Naxx with my guild. My biggest achievement was probably tanking all three tunnels of fankriss adds on our first kill (and it was our strat for a bit). I also ran flags and earned our team a couple HWL titles. Great class, great concept, interesting gameplay in complicated environments. Lots of opportunity to be a real hero. 
---
But if I play seriously in classic I'll probably level an alt with that kind of time (which I doubt I'll have going from college-age gamer to now mid-30s).
---
Tonpa is an anime character who‚Äôs only goal in life is to fuck people over and piss people off for no reason other than the lols
---
&gt;(No man‚Äôs sky, FO76, ME andromeda, Anthem) which I will also say were overhyped and pretty much all delivered what was promised, but people ignored the development updates with what they wished they would be
---
Delivered what was promised?   They were all trash...  WTF are you smoking?
---
Warlocks and ShadowPriest are both pretty badass in PvP and ganking... and 9 times out of 10 even if you kill them their dots kill you, depending on the class you are playing.
---
Ganking is not bannable by itself, correct. But griefing is. If you camp someone 24/7 so they can never play the game, or camp a quest NPC so nobody can ever turn their quests in, Blizzard has, and will take action. They‚Äôve stated that griefing becoming harassment is bannable.
---
this is top-tier sperging lmao keep going
---
Ya'll are wild, I like that.
---
2h arms for leveling is totally fine and it's the go to by far for pvp (for all them sweet sweet mortal strikes.) In pve 2H fury is totally a thing. If you plan to play alliance there is a slam spec you can play for 2h fury although the horde version is smoother/stronger due to shaman windfury totem.
---
You mustve just said something retarded or the recruiter is a smoothbrain . Idk. Theres plenty of hardcore guilds that will take you, their loss
---
I dont agree, but then again I've been staring at the "new" horse animation for most of my life, so I suppose I'm just used to it. I'd love to see this fixed nonetheless as it existed then!
---
Actually a lamp that I never use....
---
I'll pretend to be a girl and try to befriend a streamer, get them to meet me for drinks irl, trick them into sleeping with me and then shout "HA! You just slept with a boy! That makes you gay! ". That'll learn them to mess with classic experience.
---
Right, private servers. Most people are care bear as fuck on them.
---
barrens chat, that is all you need.
---
Commenting to save this post :)
---
Especially m.2
---
Gonna have spam everywhere anyway. Fucking get over it.
---
i guess I am an older WoW player than I thought. I remember the announcement of rp-pvp servers making me think they were released later. Nope it was back in 2005 in patch 1.8.
---
Alliance - human warriors are objectively the best unless compared to a troll war with tf, you have fear ward
---
Horde - wotf, orc stun racial, troll racial. 
---
Theres more but thats the biggest
---
It's not blacklist addon. It's griefing list addon. You're targetting players to ruin their game experience. To add to that, whoever is not with you, will also be griefed. You're truly a despicable person.
---
Dude, thank you for this. Just trying to stay far away from the BS.
---
But this is Reddit, a fair amount of content on here is nfsw and a lot of us Reddit users are weirdos. I totally get your point, but can understand where op is coming from.
---
Tonpa wouldn‚Äôt gank people, he would join dungeon groups as a hunter and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù pull extra mobs to wipe the group and guilt trip people when they get mad at him.
---
Lol wtf
---
The really despicable ones.
---
I was going to write a post about the issues with him making that claim, but it turns out I don't need to because Joana specifically mentions taming Owls in his Teldrassil Hunter guide.
---
&gt; Hunter, 9a) Leave Darnassus and take the north path and tame a Strigid Hunter (around 39.46 in Teldrassil) as your main pet you will be using.  Try to get a level 9.  Be sure to put Claw Rank 2 on autocast and teach him Growl Rank 1 from the Beast Training in your Spellbook.
---
He mentions Cats as an *optional variant* that he prefers for speed running. Speed running meta =/= optimal leveling strategy, hence why he lists Owls as the main pet and not cats.
---
I bought a $1000 laptop that will be overkill for Classic, but I bought it for gaming in general, not Classic.
---
Lmfao you honestly think that a whole server is gonna be populated of ONLY the viewers you people are even dumber than i fucking thought. you people think the world revolves around all of you and anything that a streamer does is gonna ruin your game. You people are legit pathetic as fuck.
---
Most people don't care about the streamers themselves, but about the swarm that will follow them, spamming chat and being a pain in the ass.
---
&gt;if you dont want to be with a streamer, then dont go on their server. simple as that.
---
What a hot take, considering that's literally what the OP is emphasizing - leaving a server populated with streamers.
---
None of the punishments are against the EULA.
---
people are dumb as fuck and enjoy the drama.
---
Horde get a sweet fishing rod? I‚Äôm fucking sold
---
Appa, yiff yiff
---
Just want to avoid asmongolds hillbilly cult.
---
Were you hoping while looking? That's the only place my legs fall asleep lol.
---
Is there a list of streamers anywhere that I can just go down and check off to make sure they're not on my server when classic launches?
---
!Remindme 70 days
---
Ahh I see your point. Either way, it‚Äôs all petty nonsense. People get bent out of shape over the dumbest shit in video games.
---
Just like the good old days. Everyone in full denial and ready to get to level 10 two hours after launch!!! Let's go!
---
Until reality sets in.
---
If you don't want to be stream sniped then don't stream. Why do so many ppl seem to care about all these classic streamers?
---
He was on an episode of allcraft (a wow podcast) you should check it out, seems like a chill dude
---
I remember the scripted PvP events with groups of people in random locations around the world that was planned in advance in the WoW forums.
---
WoW... eeeeh no pun intended! 
---
But damn this is getting out of hand and I think the spirit of what made Vanilla WoW great is going to be ruined and lost before it even has a chance.
---
I have to agree to some extent.  What's so good about the Witcher 3?   The story is boring, and worst of all, the combat feels clunky and boring as well.   WTF even is the story?  Some stupid love triangle while he looks for his apprentice?
---
We get to character create 30 days prior don't we?  I imagine all the major streamers will have their info available ahead of time.
---
+25 Fishing if I remember
---
Hey fellow GM! If you dont want to keep recruiting or want to take time to organize a whole vanilla guild, you could always join us! 
---
We are at about 25 members as of now and been organizing for about 48 hours. 
---
If you are interested in merging, holla at ya boi. We are a tight knit group as well. We are alliance pvp central timezone based, raid nights are Tues/thurs/Sunday
---
On the beta rogues diaries require 5000 lockpicking skill to open and only vendor for 2 silver 56 copper instead of the 45 silver they should vendor for.
---
VR is only good for porn.
---
if you mean the mental retardation spectrum you are right.
---
Vanilla WoW did not have streaming.
---
#\#nochanges
---
UD female priest since 05
---
A market with almost no cost of development, and insane returns.   It's like the fucking gold rush.   How could they not dive in?
---
Why couldn‚Äôt you play on one character only with this?
---
While I get your other points and don‚Äôt disagree with them your first I feel is completely wrong. This mechanic incentivizes playing on only one character.
---
You mean the Barrens discord.
---
This has made me curious because I didn't see him on the list- does Abn still stream? Watched him trip balls and play with his own puke one night before he finally got a ban hammer...still traumatized from that.
---
I love this and hope that it is true.
---
That's a problem with reddit itself, as the intention of the voting system is never explained and the most intuitive use of it is to send that mongoloid who posted another trash streamer meme is to send his crusty ass into the land of 0 hell and make him regret the thought of ever being born.
---
2 weeks. And if they dont wanna share then we wont know
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=24282/rogues-diary
---
That seems to be the correct vendor price.
---
He literally mentions he believes cats are better.
---
This choice wont dramatically affect your leveling time, but I still believe cats are better for speedleveling due to higher DPS output that cats have.
---
You can say owls are better, but the speed leveler says he thinks cats are better.
---
Rogue diaries require lockpicking?
---
Please do! Get creative with it
---
Glad to see my c'thun pic making the cut. Stellar work!
---
Depends. If he‚Äôs truly with the lock the entire time it might be better to maximize the heals on the lock, which converts to mana, which means more damage coming out of the lock. I haven‚Äôt run the math, but it seems possible.
---
I don‚Äôt think people ‚Äúhate‚Äù streamers they hate the toxicity that they scatter.
---
I'd fuck that
---
Trying to interfere with glory!
---
Blizzard used to try to make great games, and the money came naturally.  Now they try to make money, and the games are secondary.
---
flattered but not gay
---
 a healer priest,paladin,shaman probably. 
---
resto druid to a lesser extent as more hardcore guilds will only take a couple of druids
---
BrokenTooth was the pet of choice man. The fastest atk spd before it was changed later on. Tearing apart casters in PvP with spell interrupts. Then the cool part of being a hunter and actually waiting hours and checking back to hunt and tame him vs other hunters of both sides waiting to do the same.
---
No, it was pretty much the same as it was back in the day on retail Vanilla/TBC. Equal parts ganking/griefing and helping/not fighting.
---
Depending on how much time you actually spend with the lock, it may be worth skipping the cat move speed talents and opting for more damage stuff. Those talents are AMAZING solo, but if you end up standing around waiting for you buddy all the time it could get annoying/have more utility in other talents.
---
"Punishments". Oh my god. Okay, I'm convinced you're serious. I'm actually seeing the beginnings of a totalitarian regime in the fucking video game.
---
 
---
&gt;*What if I refuse to use the addon?*

&gt;When a player joins a group, the addon will alert other members to your non-compliance. You will be sent a link to the download page of the addon with instructions on how to install it.

---
yeah this addon wont last very long
---
It takes two... and I know what SodaPop said has rubbed the community the wrong way and caused a shitstorm to happen.
---
But one bad apple should not ruin it for everyone, not all streamers are shitass jerks and asshats.... I really hope think in the end a middle ground will be reached and that SodaPop will end up not even playing Classic WoW.
---
I have this and a few others saved on photobucket. Nothing quite as interesting though. First time in Onyxia, trying to kill Jaina proudmoore, and I think just before aq opened the big as anubis guards in silithus.

This post radiates big dick energy.

Pepega :mega: FOOOOORRRSAAAANNNN

I dunno man, I always kinda thought the horse animations in WoW were shitty. Especially how the players just stay stiff on the horse's back.
---
You are my hero

Who gives a shit?
---
Madseason isn‚Äôt either, but Madseason is great.
---
It's also a diff question if you can get your guild to feed you the AQ40 legendary. Then I think you'd top dps
---
I'm about 75% finished reading and I had to content and upvote without further delay. This is amazing. It's a great guide. You've added knowledge into a world in which much was post. My hat is off to you.
---
Idk if this is when you have a slower weapon than your opponent and you hamstring them so that you only get in range to hit them when your swing is ready.  This way you are taking hits 1 to 1 and you take less damage
---
You will need a swing timer addon
---
I‚Äôd love to know this too. I imagine the pre raid bis would be relatively easy since druids are amazing at questing and can fill any role in dungeons while collecting gear. But I doubt you‚Äôll get any good caster damage pieces before all of the locks and mages in raids.
---
!Remind me 3 months
---
It's all about the lore for me.  And since I love me my RPPPVP servers, it makes me violently ill to even think about playing Horde.  
---
GLORY TO THE ALLIANCE
---
theyll handle things that deal with the ToS, beyond that for every autist trying to gank a streamer there will be an autist fanboy trying to protect the streamer so things will mostly balance out
---
Yeah my comment was more just on feral levelling. If you're always with a lock an insect swarm/mf build is probably pretty legit. Immolate/corruption/mf/is should pretty much kill everything and you'll have plenty of mana left to keep the lock healthy. It sounds fun anyway.
---
Tauren Druid get a BiS trinket from a quest
---
It's like crack for the brain watching Asmongold fail at something or watch him get betrayed by his own guild.
---
guess its unfortunate that #nochanges doesnt apply to the rest of the internet. just because we have a game back from 15 years ago doesnt mean the rest of the internet is going to come to a halt and turn back time to be the same as it was back then as well.
---
Woah woah woah... I‚Äôll take this stupid drama crap over the ‚Äúwhat happens post naxx?‚Äù Crap.
---
Warrior main tank
---
&gt;45 silver they should vendor for
---
Based on what?
---
?????
---
How did you type this with a straight face lmao, talk about entitlement
---
Refusing trades and groups from another player is not harassment.
---
Ignoring the chat from another player is not harassment.
---
Corpse-camping and other PVP activity is not harassment.
---
This is just a lot of NOT-harassment on a massive scale.
---
You could just do as suggested and join the server where they will be hunted down.
---
Damn this is serious
---
No, WE don't.   Don't make this crap.   It will just be a dead server that will split the population.
---
100% Soda and his group will retaliate with the most ridiculous shit they can and people who think they can dedicate themselves to WoW like he can are delusional. But it will probably be interesting to watch shake out either way.
---
Classic not cataclysm. You dirty dog.
---
My understanding is that yes it will be in classic. 
---
As to what it does is it alter the formula which calculates damage. I don‚Äôt remember the exact formula but weapon speed is one of the multipliers. The old way used the actual weapon speed making very slow weapons have huge multipliers. Normalization applies a set multiplier for one handers two handers etc. Slower weapons still benefit from having higher potential damage range but less than when they had a huge multiplier
---
The middle ground is streamers play over there and the rest of us play over here. Anything less is unacceptable.
---
I guess my added clarification was somehow missed, so let me literally copy and paste it as my reply.
---
"He mentions Cats as an optional variant that he prefers for speed running. Speed running meta =/= optimal leveling strategy, hence why he lists Owls as the main pet and not cats."
---
Do you not know what speed runs are and what's involved compared to normal runs? Maybe that's the issue?
---
Arena
---
Prior to the normalization that occurred, it made weapon speed a factor in instant attacks (making slower weapons better). Now the only thing that matters is weapon damage, but weapon damage is part of weapon speed still, so the slower weapons are pretty much always still better.
---
It‚Äôs not the only RP in WoW but let‚Äôs be honest Goldshire on any RP realm is exactly like you hear about. What I don‚Äôt understand is why?
---
You dont need fear ward
---
mods for scrubs.
---
Most def not...
---
Being back THAC0!!
---
It gets so hard to remember. Me and my rp guild Chained and Pained would raid goldshire every tuesday. We wiped constantly on this one gnome named cornholio, our tank kept getting stuck inside him! I would /e cry to diffuse the situation before mommymilf, our healer /e rubs back and we tried again
---
!Remindme 65 days
---
How does an undead swim?  It should be impossible, no?
---
This is from the 0.9 beta. Mortal strike had no cooldown and dealed 220% wep dmg
---
There's so many angles to consider that it is impossible to guess no matter how much math is thrown from it. What about WoW Token purchases? Those HAVE to be a decent chunk of their money. What about non direct sources? They might value the fact that releasing the Zandalar themed Hearthstone expansion might make more WoW players try it out. But we don't KNOW
---
And then there's the collector's edition for the 15th anniversary. And I bet my left butt cheek they'll make bank with the next xpac announcement regardless of the state of BFA. But, again, we just dont know :(
---
One of the better troll posts here, thanks for keks. Also... As much as this would be an awesome social experiment... You're gonna get shut down by blues really fast. Like fucking hell m8, China wants to know your location.
---
Soda would get 5 warriors who want easy kills
---
@crimsonak posted this in another thread
---
it was, but the slower weaps still have higher dmg so every instant has that much extra damage, it just no longer has a better multiplier for AP contributions.
---
So it still matters, just not as much as before.
---
I don't know what you're trying to say here. You're saying slower weapons have a higher base damage, but you go on to admit because of normalisation the contribution they get from AP is lower, which means the damage is lowered.
---
So, before normalisation the Wirlwind Axe calculation would look like this assuming 1000AP.
---
base weapon damage + weapon speed * Attack Power / 14
---
154 + (3.6 * 1000) / 14 =  268 damage.
---
After normalisation it would look like this:
---
base weapon damage + (X * Attack Power / 14) [X is 3.3 for two handed weapons]
---
154 + (3.3 * 1000) / 14 = 246 damage.
---
Now the sword for before and after.
---
Before: 124 + (2.9 * 1000) / 14 = 216 damage.
---
After: 124 + (3.3 * 1000)/14 = 244 damage.
---
The axe is better by only two damage at the top end after normalisation for instant attacks.
---
If my calculations are correct (happy to be corrected if they aren't) the sword should be an absolute no brainer for humans to get.
---
I have pretty clear memories of leveling up in 06' and again during TBC, but hey if you need some kind of gratification from believing this you can have it.
---
&gt; There are just as many bad players using meta specs

Just blatantly wrong, considering not a single good player would ever go a meme spec for PvE. And yes, everyone who uses a meme spec is out to ‚Äúruin my day‚Äù because they throw BGs and make dungeons/raids take longer. Rolling a meme spec in Vanilla is the most immoral thing you can do in the game.
---
Whether people give you shit or not. Thanks man!
---
&gt; Owls can be both better for leveling but worse for speed running.
---
But how? We're discussing leveling efficiency here. How can it be better for speed leveling, but worse for regular leveling?
---
I miss when you could talk to each other by mind controlling 1 another and emoting. 
---
Made great friends with some guys on the alliance this way.
---
Blizzard has never once banned a player for use of an addon.
---
Or the biggest difference: shaman vs paladin

Intellect for everyone! Idgaf what class you are, you are getting an intellect buff from me.

Your optimism ...i envy you xD The problem is they have ppl do anything for them. Yeah, you see this subreddit here but u forget the 40k viewers, they dont write here. Regarding evidence ...and that goes back to ur optimism. Lets say Snutz and Soda say they got sniped (just an example) u really believe that anyone would say bullshit i dont believe u guys? You see the Twitchchat when Soda killed that level 15 guy 10 times (btw i find nothing wrong with that) now i need ur optimism to believe if this is the other way around that he will take it. But then again i do hope u are right
---
He sounds like a cult leader sometimes. Setting Classic WoW on a pedestal like it should be worshipped even though it's imperfect (like the absolute piece of garbage bottom talent for Affliction).
---
Theyd have to balance all that content for AGES, that is significantly harder than you think it is. BUT nonetheless it isn't an idea to scoff at, it is neat
---
Exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
---
Did you just skip the last sentence or something? I'm addressing the stream of slackjawed sheep that endlessly make threads about which streamer they hate most.
---
Read the whole thing, slowly. In particular the last sentence where I state content should be the point of discussion, not the person.
---
That sad thing is you think it‚Äôs not. But when you add on doesn‚Äôt make it into the game don‚Äôt come crying here. 
---
I really hope all the streamers roll on your server now. 4 guilds of people ain‚Äôt nothing compared to what the streamers will have. 
---
The best part of it all is that the pserver players have become more toxic on here then the fanboys.
---
Questing straight no addons suck.  Doing it on private server now and it‚Äôs sooooo tedious.
---
I forgot about reading quest text to go ‚Äúsouthwest of sentienel hill‚Äù or just ‚Äúeast of lakeshire.‚Äù  Shit could be right outside of town or across the zone.
---
Questing isn‚Äôt optimized either/no quest hubs.  You would be jizzin to get 3 quests in the same quadrant of the map.  
---
The simple loot a environment items are easy to miss if you don‚Äôt read the quest texts.
---
Addon max for me, powerlevel to 60.  Then my alt might take the slow route with dungeon and quest text.
---
I‚Äôm sodas top donator dude, I donate over a thousand dollars monthly and sometimes he even reads the donations on stream and acts really shocked.
---
I had a warrior make fun of me for giving him an intellect buff before. Why do you care? Free buff, bro.
---
&gt;I was wondering if I could get an explanation of how weapon normalization works for 1.12.
---
That would be difficult because full normalization wasn't implemented until 1.8.
---
The short version for 1.12 is that when comparing two weapons with similar DPS, you should always go for the one that has higher base damage but slower attack speed.
---
This is because instant skills ignore attack speed. The more base damage your weapon does, the more extra damage you get from these skills every X seconds when they're available to cast. This is also why combat Rogues gravitate towards swords over daggers - more damage from spamming Sinister Strike.
---
No your iq isn‚Äôt high enough judging by your posts
---
He also tries to make some of the concepts hes talking about sound waaaay smarter than they are. When he makes charts and graphs for things that can be explained in a single sentence it‚Äôs rough to watch lol.
---
While I love appa, I‚Äôd have to say momo is far superior in the humor category
---
No problem. You going for the sword?
---
&gt;Try raiding without raid frames, let me know how your healers do
---
I did do that.
---

---
Wow X-fire. That‚Äôs a blast from the past. Remember when everyone was playing solitaire in an effort to dethrone wow from the no.1 most played spot?
---
We could always make an addon to blacklist the blacklisters! And mass grief them the same way!
---

---
If I end up alliance 100%. My friends and I haven't decided on faction yet though as some of us are old school alliance and others are old school horde.
---
Fuck that noise.
---
The only thing streamers have done for me is to show me which serves I shouldn‚Äôt join.
---
Forsen should get his own category of "very high", he has the most cancerous
---
I know when i was playing vanilla 15years ago when i was a kid and knew nothing i was told i wanted a slow swinging weapon as they hit harder i.e you have 2 2h weapon3 both doing 50dps but one swings at 2.8 and the other at 3.1 the 3.1 would give you a bigger HS kind of like combat rogues wanting a slow mainhand for the hard SS hits, i dont know if any of that is helpfull but i thought it might help to share.
---
As do you tbh
---
What are they playing? Is it who can move some party cups by using the force?
---
i think it depends, the smaller the model the closer you have to be to the target to reach them as melee. I'd say smaller model is mixed results with rogue (you're harder to get out with aoe, but it's easier to kite you) whereas it's mostly positives if you roll something like mage.
---
Tough choice man, I‚Äôm in the same boat. Leaning horde for now, but god I hate those cities
---
For the record even if something like Corrupted Ashbringer scales at 100%, it still does less dps than Thunderfury, The Hungering Cold and a 10% prot rate Ironfoe that self-procs, all of which are still significantly worse (For either dps or mana uptime) than MCP.  
---
The only thing I can think of which would actually contend with MCP is a Blackblade of Shahram that double procs off SoR at a reasonable rate, and that's only if the haste and stats buffs can stack, at least for personal dps. Blackblade might be a really solid meme for increasing the melee group dps as a whole, regardless of stacking on the haste buff.  
---
There is also the Torch of Retribution which has been mentioned, but we have no idea how it works. Going to see that on the beta shortly.  
---
But yeah, just, try to temper your expectations that you can find a way to not have to farm MCPs, assuming you want to maximize dps. That said, farming MCPs is way less of a pain than people make it out to be. You can farm about 2 per 20-30 minutes, doing all 5 resets of gnomer through the back door at about 4-5 minutes each, and gnomer is right next to Ironforge. Farm gnomer quick while eating breakfast and again before going to sleep, 3-4 days a week, a total of maybe 3 hours per week farming, and you'll be fine.
---
"Hm?"
---
That‚Äôs now how it‚Äôs going to work. They are going to play where they want and you will have to go run along somewhere else.
---
you missed assmongoloid
---
You wanted Hammond Druthers. I give you Hammond Druthers.
---
&gt;Its why I join guilds: so that I never wipe to Geddon bomb.
---
What guilds?  You mean pirated servers where everyone has a boss mod addon?
---
Is mark of tyranny that good? I‚Äôm debating between that and eye of the beast since my primary is going to be balance and feral tank secondary. I‚Äôll pick that if it‚Äôs so important. 
---
Also how do you feel about Smoking Heartbof the Mountain? I don‚Äôt plan to run enchanting so I‚Äôm wondering if Force of Will is a decent replacement.
---
I‚Äôd rather play on a server with streamer shenanigans then a barren wasteland of a server.
---
They use to do server migrations for low pop. servers in Vanilla, but not often.  My hope is launch will see high traffic on all servers.
---
Because speed running involves very particular strategies that the average player wouldn't be willing to do. Like how Joana trains First Aid by weaving in bandage crafts between his auto shots, and then he uses those bandages on his cat pet to heal it rather than using mend pet so as to conserve mana.
---
Not a single person who is just trying to level efficiently would go to those lengths, but that's what a speed run is.
---
In this example, an owl does less DPS than a cat. It does 3% less dps baseline, and usage of screech does less dps than just using claw. It's also significantly tankier as a result since it has more defensive stats than a cat and it lowers the AP of monsters by 25/50/75/100. Joana doesn't care about the tankiness of his pet or the QoL factor of an owl potentially because of the aforementioned strategy, among other contributing factors of which I'm ignorant. Cats are theoretically slightly faster than an owl, but only if the hunter is willing to put up with reduced QoL. If the difference in efficiency isn't big, but the difference in effort is, there's no good reason to use the harder variant for the average leveling process.
---
already got swifty so may as well put on bajheera with a very high to high popularity for alliance.  he also seems like one that would stay around for a long period based on his opinion of classic.
---
I don't understand why anyone is even mad about this. A lot of you are saying you won't play on his server anyway so why do you even care?
---
Also, if you get blacklisted, just make a guild for blacklisters and streamsnipe with the power of collective autism.
---

From what I‚Äôve heard, resist fights are actually easier for bear tanks, due to their Armor and threat buffers whereas the warriors have to tank their tps and defensive stats to compensate for resists.
---
I‚Äôve experienced this too. It‚Äôd be cool to have a legit RPPVP server but I ain‚Äôt here for PVP griefing RPers (or vice versa) beyond an open world scrap. I always felt it was rude.
---
Wait, there are RPers who actually *like* playing the isolationist bigot faction? Weird. I guess some volunteers gotta be the bad guys to keep server balance.
---
Now this is shit posting!
---
I feel that. I'm leaning horde myself for the orc stun resist but I gotta say I love the aesthetic of the alliance zones compared to all the desert and dead land of the horde. It's nice to something green before STV
---
Right? Kinda sad. Stormx has some great content and I want to be that geared soo bad. Druid looks like a great time, just need to figure out the gearing bit.
---
This is incorrect. Ironfoe is not going to compete with MCP. IF Ironfoe had a 10% proc rate and IF it self-procs off its own generated autos, then it will come CLOSE to beating MCP in dps. The issue is that it's still a slow ass weapon, so you get less mana return from JoW, which really hurts your uptime in Naxx when you're spamming Exorcism. Like, 2 minutes of lost uptime, even with an absurdly powerful Ironfoe (Which would likely be BiS forever for warriors).  
---
I like Ironfoe too, but it's just unrealistic to assume it would compete with MCP.
---
Maybe I worded that poorly. But there would be enforcement to shut down the addon, not to ban you. Also, most of the people would not even be bothered to comply with someone's "lists and addons" of this nature, so in the end, you's be basically blacklisting yourself :D. You're overestimating the number of people, who hate streamers this much, dude.
---
Can't play opposite faction on their servers either as if you kill them in world pvp they'll cry to Blizzard to ban you and claim you stream sniped.
---
&gt; the 3.1 would give you a bigger HS kind of like combat rogues wanting a slow mainhand for the hard SS hits
---
Heroic strike and sinister strike are two completely different abilities. Heroic strike uses your next auto swing and adds a damage component to it, meaning weapon speed doesn't really matter.
---
Sinister strike ignores the speed of your weapon and does it's damage instantly. If you have a 100 dps weapon that has 1 attack speed it means you'll be spending 40 energy or whatever to deal 100 damage. If you have a weapon with 100 dps and 2 attack speed you'll be doing 200 damage with that same amount of energy, doubling the amount of damage per energy from your weapon.
---
tldr weapon speed really only matters for instant weapon attacks that don't use your auto swing timer. Abilities like heroic strike or maul use your next-swing making speed not nearly as important.
---
I was with you until that last part. Come on, surely you can make an argument without devolving into "BAD BAD"? Long term also I expect Retail to do better because of NEW content. I know plenty of people that have 0 interest in Classic because they either played it back then and don't wanna do it now (My old guild lead led back then, he said he will never go back) or more commonly just prefer the faster paced content of the game now.
---
Look, BFA has problems. A lot of them. But stop acting like everybody wants what you want. I love Classic. But I DO NOT want to see Retail fail. I grew up playing WoW, I've been playing for 13 years, since I was 7 years old. Some of us just want it to succeed. And I beleive it will keep doing OKAY, not GREAT, but OKAY ENOUGH for plenty more years.
---
Dude, that will happen either way...
---
So cool!!!!!!!!!
---
He played a lot back in vanilla. (Actually a lot of FPS Pros played Vanilla WoW.)
---
He mained a Hunter back then.
---
He is a Horde player.
---
His current plan is to play a Shaman, because Sonii (another streamer) offered him the Nightfall Slut slot in his guild.
---
He said, he will play a lot on release.
---
How is ironfoe a slow as weapon? 1.6 vs mcp 1.5?
---
funny part, "Just like you remember it!" and "Less than 1% of players entered Naxxramas"  Probably the same number of guilds if not fewer got past twin emps to get a pull in on C'thun.  Now Ragnaros is something players might, just might remember.
---
I haven't actually SEEN many people roleplay Horde, but I guess they exist, yeah.
---
I'm actually surprised Asmongold doesn't have a character named WitheredJim yet.
---
&gt; That would be difficult because full normalization wasn't implemented until 1.8.
---
1.12 is after 1.8.
---
Hi, /u/sertrain
---
Imagine forcing people to download an Addon hahahahaha bitter tryhards
---
&gt; I'm actually seeing the beginnings of a totalitarian regime in the fucking video game.
---
This is where it starts. First they came for our streamers, and we did nothing. Then they came for the non-compliant casuals, and we did nothing. Soon they will come for us, and there will be no one left to stop them.
---
That makes no sense...  You aren't involved in the second place, so why would you care?    It's the same for you either way.
---
Reads  "Due to the 40,000 character limit on posts, this has been 'pruned' " **oh boy.**
---
Good write up!
---
This is probably one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve ever read, thanks
---
I really hope they have seasonal WoW.
---
Like once Classic runs for 12 months, they tick it to BC or release 1.13 content....while simultaneously launching ‚Äúfresh classic‚Äù servers.
---
Ideally they could create trilogy servers every 6-12 months.  Running 1/3 of servers in Classic, BC and Wrath.  Maybe reset Wrath servers after a while or let them flounder and make new classic servers.
---
The thought of playing on a fresh classic server at anytime seems like a fantasy.
---
RuneScape culture is just way more cut throat. You really don't need to group for pretty much anything and there was no such thing as "parties". You played the game for yourself
---
Again, it barely ever fucking happened... This is the most BFA wow shit iv ever seen again like i said before... Just because it happened once or twice to you doesn't mean thats how it was all the time. You run around in bfa now people are so fucking care bear its ridiculous. In classic-wrath, opposing faction sees you they coming for that ass.
---
This math is  wrong. You are messing up the order of operations. There will still be a 30 dmg difference after weap dmg calculation. Also , assuming a realistic AP for a lvl 30- 40, like maybe 300, would be better.
---
If they can do it why not? lol
---
Your master plan reminds me of an object oriented analysis and design course.
---
I was mistaken about ironfoe speed
---
Idk tho still need to no more on ironfoe
---
&gt;Soon they will come for us, and there will be no one left to stop them.
---
Yeah, except when Blizzard bans them Day 1 for account sharing and disrupting the game experience of others lol
---
The Axe is better even alliance side. Above math is so wrong.
---
So i was kind of right but wrong at the same time my bad haha all i know is i loved seeing big hits so i always rolled a slow weapon back in the day but i also didnt know about addons at that stage and i could have been doing terrible dps
---
Druid is the least represented class and there wont be too many in any raid group. Tier will flow to you like wine. Too bad it isn't bis.
---
&gt; t may have not been the lowest back in BC/Wrath it's clear that the sever never had a chance compared to actual PVP and PVE servers.
---
good thing nobody was making that argument. Obviously there was less progression and less raiding guilds on an RP PvP server. That doesn't mean it was dead .
---
Praise Metzen.
---
Well, of course the Horde players exist. I was talking about the bigots with the decaying empire of aristocrats and slavers.
---
Real friends as in internet friends?
---
RP servers are heavily favored toward Alliance, like 75% to 25%.
---
RP can exist outside of special events too...
---
The addon only uses chat functionality. To shut the addon down would mean to shut down just about every addon available.
---
My fear is Classic is a band aid for revenue while they formulate a perfect expansion.
---
My hope is Classic is the new direction they push, whether it be 1.13, WoW 2, or seasonal servers.
---
Ironfoe actually does the same exact DPS as an MCP if you consider MCP's Use to always be in effect, causing it to have a speed of 1.33. Ironfoe obviously has its proc which helps it, but it's still a slow weapon, and the damage in this build largely comes from SoR and the fact that it has a static damage with regards to haste. MCP's on use ability increases SoR damage by like 166% on every single swing. Ironfoe has a small chance per swing of increasing SoR damage by 300%. Seeing the issue? 166% on every swing is greater than 300% on 2.5/5/10% of swings, especially when you consider we're stacking spellpower to increase SoR damage further.
---
Yep, basically the slower weapons are better in nearly every case. Warriors prefer it for mortal strike, sinister strike, ambush/backstab, seal of command for paladins, etc.
---
Big numbers for slow weapons.
---
Love this picture it was my desktop back round.
---
Don't mind if I do, bar wench
---
I'm all for it except that I have to download it.... I've never once used an addon before and its dumb that you guys will try and force me to do use one.
---
As a fellow pserver vet I am Just chiming in here to say I can't wait to see you shit on them haha
---
VANCLEEF PAY BIG FOR YOUR HEAD x2
---
It's funny, I think most of the fanatic pserver crowd thinks classic is going to either be like another day in the pserver park or like vanilla was, as if Blizzard isn't going to treat classic exactly like every other one of their games today.
---
Reading kotaku in 2019 lul
---
Blizzard has no approval process for an addon. They only approve API functions that EVERY addon can use.
---
It doesn't matter how many people the streamer will have, even the same-faction griefing will be enough.
---
It's good, but not good enough to beat MCP. It also loses to THC, surprisingly.
---
...fucking IT, I swear
---
Just get a cat forehead.
---
Why not create an addon that makes us all streamers...bc when we‚Äôre all streamers...none of us are streamers.
---
Okay, first my actual response: Are there actually major RP pservers? I never looked into it:
---
Now my also actual response: It helps when the good guys have the odds stacked against them. Makes things more tense when there are Nazis around every corner, like *Wolfenstein*, or *Indiana Jones*.
---
Pet battles
---
Well man... Maybe you are few years behind on how Blizzard is now. Or on what's left of it. If you really want to try it, you're in on few unpleasant surprises.
---
Lmao, right?  I've no idea why anyone would want to play blood elves and orcs.  I guess it's fun and edgy to be the bad guy when you're a kid....?
---
Can‚Äôt speak for others, but I have no problem with streamers overall (except Asmongold, he‚Äôs just an annoying, whiny prick).  It‚Äôs more their fans than anything else.  If even half of the people in their chats are in game, I would prefer not to be on that server, as nearly all the comments are just asinine at best and toxic at its worst.  I believe that the chat log behavior will transfer to in-game and that‚Äôs not something I want to be around.
---
Yeah, it makes literally no sense. They haven't numbered patches that way since vanilla either.
---
My guild has decided to go alliance this time around. The fact that I will miss the 2020 elections barren chat is equally horrifying and so relieving.
---
I doubt it. There will be guilds recruiting like crazy. Level up with them and prove your value. Earn your spot. There‚Äôs no guaranteed spots until you have prebis and attunes. Not every guild on every server is going to have a full 40 man roster. Even my pserver guild knows not everyone is going to go with us. Everyone is replaceable until they prove they want to be there.
---
This is just stupid. Stay in pservers and leave us alone.
---
Imagine destroying someones fun because your entitled ass is in the same server as streamer.
---
What‚Äôs CRZ, haven‚Äôt played since Cata
---
Okay... I'll join Isis, just chill.
---
&gt; When said big streamer crys about pvp on a pvp server and calls for bans?
---
It was a same-faction player griefing which has been against WoW's ToU since 2004. Being on a PvP server doesn't suddenly mean all griefing is allowed.
---
It‚Äôs not the end of the world because a 3 pack pull would go freezing trap -&gt; send pet in -&gt; serpent sting the main target -&gt; multi shot -&gt; serpent sting the slower one -&gt; tank the slower one the third one is CCd. 
---
This is how you keep your pet alive.
---
LOL this is next level dumb ass shit.
---
wow, this is crazy
---
Pervert.
---
We really don't though, we've put it through the sheet and tested it on Pservers. For Ironfoe to beat MCP, it wouldn't just be a good weapon for paladins, it would be a good weapon for everyone. And it would be significantly better for everyone else than it would be for paladins.  
---
Why don't you join the discord and get all your questions answered there?  [https://discord.gg/SYv58tE](https://discord.gg/SYv58tE)

We remember WoWRadio and TotalBiscuit and everything they did for the community and we wonder why you all have your panties in a twist over today‚Äôs equivalent.
---
But in this case it's actually true.

I have to get mine unbanned, apparently i was hacked shortly after i quit with the release of cata, and i haven't played since. Someone in Taiwan apparently got access somehow and got me banned. 
---
The bitch of the problem is i moved halfway across the world and no longer live in the same region as i originally was, and to add to that blizz wants me to upload a piece of photo ID BEFORE i can even access support tickets, but i don't have any of my old ID's that i would probably need to get support. If you have any advice i'd appreciate it. I've tried tweeting at them to no avail

Boycotts and strikes only work if everyone participates. It's not feasible for you to participate without the addon. If not using the addon is more important to you than not having streamers on our server, you're welcome to choose another server. We'll be announcing our server choice on August 12th.
---
It's not deep actually it's quite simple lol
---
Other than Scarab Lord being basically handed to them, they won't have as much impact as you think. Take a little chill pill.
---
The addon clearly does thing to violate the EULA. You just don‚Äôt want to admit it. 
---
The thing is the streamers will ALWAYS have more people then you. No matter how hard you try they will always win in the end.  
---
You doing more to bother other people who want to just enjoy the game then you are to the streamers.

There will be countless people standing around with names on the screen. All it takes is to search the name of someone the streamer is standing next to = server is pinpointed. Go to area that streamer is in and run around a little = streamer found
---
You're in luck. Those are probably the only two streamers you need to avoid. Anyone else will likely be negligible.
---
The sad thing is I don't even know if you're joking or not.
---
I haven't played BFA at all pretty much, the last time I played was pre-Draenor and it was pretty much the opposite of what you're describing. Leveling up in Outlands was hell because you'd just get ganked by max level players and no one would help you or would just tell you to get on your max level main and kill him. Meanwhile on private servers and retail you could definitely get someone to come help out if that was happening.
---
But anyways if you don't go around mindlessly trying to killing everyone like how I assume you play/played then it's really not some crazy blood-bath outside of the few zones with highly contested mobs or with lots of congestion like Ashenvale or STV. Zones like Tanaris, Badlands, and Desolace can be really chill or brutal depending on the day from all of my experiences.

What's with these non sequiturs? You talk about playing Blood Elves and Orcs, but then you talk about playing the Alliance as a kid. Blood Elves left the Alliance specifically because the "Alliance" abandoned their allies to the Scourge when their racist military officials deemed the entire species a mongrel race, and Orcs were captured and enslaved (a *second* time) and put into concentration camps. Only a dullard or a Nazi sympathizer would willingly choose to be in the Alliance, and I don't like assuming people I talk to are dulla‚Äî
---
Oh. *Oh*. You're a Nazi sympathizer. Makes perfect sense now! I'm glad we cleared things up.
---
We don't consider the plague that is streamer culture a joke in even the slightest regard.
---
They would rather the servers get overloaded.  If the game starts to die down and the servers stabilize at a lower number of players, then they don't want to have extra servers that already had a lower player count and end up having a dead server.
---
Maybe if the game really kicks off and keeps on getting more and more popular like vanilla did in 2004, then they might make an RPPVP server.
---
I still don't see how I'll benefit from using owl though. Owl has an AOE damage reduction. 95% of the time, I'll be fighting a single mob.
---
Tankier, When I"m out leveling, My pet will either be healed before I'm ready to fight the next mob, or really close to being healed.
---
The only time I want a tankier pet, is if I'm trying to solo an elite, and for that I'll use Boar, more armor, and more health.
---
Exactly.  And for those of us who did see the inside of Naxx almost none of killed everything.  For my guild Loatheb (remember he wasn‚Äôt the toothless fight he was in Wrath) stopped ya dead in our tracks back in the day.
---
Blizzard has made it very clear that as long as you are not accepting IRL compensation, carry selling is 100% accepted within the bounds of the EULA. Your reports will do nothing.
---
Gold sellers are another story and I completely agree with you there.
---
I wonder if you were playing with my buddy from back in high school. He is constantly saying poggers and monka S while we play games. Nice dude but the shit is super annoying.
---
Like /u/PH020 said, you used the wrong order of operations. You're not dividing right after your multiplication. Here's the correct equations:
---
WW Axe:
---
* 154 + (3.6*1000)/14 = ~~268~~ 411
---
* 154 + (3.3*1000)/14 = ~~246~~ 389
---
WW Sword:
---
* 124 + (2.9*1000)/14 = ~~216~~ 331
---
* 124 + (3.3*1000)/14 = ~~244~~ 359
---
Let's simplify these formulas and see by how much the axe is better than the sword. The difference between the axe and sword's ability damage is always going to be exactly 30, as both formulas have this part `(3.3*1000)/14`in it. Let's simplify that and prove the above:
---
    124 + ~~(3.3*1000)/14~~ = 154 + ~~(3.3*1000)/14~~
---
    124 = 154, 30 difference
---
Now, 1k AP is way too unrealistic for someone who is using WW weapons, like /u/PH020 said. Let's assume 300 AP instead.
---
* WW axe
---
&gt; * 154 + (3.3*300)/14 = 225
---
* WW sword
---
&gt; * 154 + (3.3*300)/14 = 195
---
225 damage vs 195 damage, a much bigger difference. **The lower the AP, the more the damage difference between the axe and the sword is worth.**
---
Just roll eu no streamers
---
&gt;  Owl has an AOE damage reduction. 95% of the time, I'll be fighting a single mob.
---
It's also single target.
---
If you don't want an owl, frankly I don't care. It's still a good leveling pet, most people think it's a good leveling pet, and Joana says it's a good leveling pet. Do what you want with the information you've been given. Some people even claim or Wolves Boars are best, and the difference is probably so small it doesn't even matter for the average leveler.
---
With a full caster set on hand, healing dungeons shouldn't be a problem
---
Yes and if you continue to calculate for the benefit of weapon skill, you will find that even at max glancing reduction, you are still better with axe. And since warriors typically fight lower level monsters when lvling weap skill is not impactful and axe is much better.
---
Gold sellers are RMT which is against the TOS.
---
Selling carry runs off in game gold is not. 
---
People aren‚Äôt going to be selling runs anytime soon. The people who would buy the carry runs won‚Äôt hit max level till a month or later after launch.  Plus people will sell runs once they don‚Äôt need loot which will be even longer after that. It takes a long time to gear out a 40+ player roster.
---
&gt; If you don't want an owl, frankly I don't care. It's still a good leveling pet
---
I never ever said it was a bad pet. It has dive which is great. I just said it wasn't the best.
---
Thanks for the reply! Really don‚Äôt want to do raids, but I‚Äôll do five or 10 mans for the gear. Hopefully I‚Äôll do ok. Thanks!
---
Because they won't affect faction population balance at all.
---
Please let this be real. The ban wave on this one would be hilarious.
---
could you give more info on this?  very curious
---
Never having to worry about how much something is going to cost.
---
I had that mace on my priest with +9 beastslaying on it. Used to fuel druids and they would seeth. Would crack me up every time.
---
It‚Äôs actually a great way to truly play a hybrid druid in a raid. You are typically used as a third tank. Before pulling in a fury for tanking but after the other two tanks. Other times you heal, decurse, or dps. But you know this already because you read Taladrils guide. I think most raids will consider running with one tank druid.
---
Play alliance. Keep in mind that male night elf‚Äôs look stupid when casting
---
Blizzard has never once banned a player for using any addon or doing anything the addon automates.
---
Truth, Dwarves and Tauren are good people.
---
&gt; Heroic strike uses your next auto swing and adds a damage component to it, meaning weapon speed doesn't really matter.
---
Actually if it adds flat damage then it favours faster attacking weapons, Rage permitting
---
It‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôll be in on the 26th.
---
The other tank stat that is great about druid tanking is their threat output, which is better than prot warriors
---
Yeah it really only matters if you‚Äôre in the realm of rage capping.
---
All the "account sharers" will be using the same machine and fully able to respond to any of Blizzards "is-human" tests.
---
If you want to avoid streamers, then you only have to avoid Asmongold and Soda. That's it. Do that and you're golden.
---
It's gonna be chaos from every direction.  There is going to be some good world PvP.
---
I mean... the celebrity factor does pretty dramatically affect the community of a server...
---
Clicker..
---
The purity of our Classic community is at risk! Help us eradicate the filthy streamers to make our server a great place! When others will see how great we're doing, the world will soon follow our steps! Remember, if you're not with us you're as bad as streaming trash and will be punished!
---
there are definitely ways to work around not having an AOE threat generating ability on your pet, but it's just less efficient that's all. 
---
I have leveled a couple hunters to 60 both in vanilla and on pservers and I prefer an Owl, but I dont mind rocking a cat either
---
 !RemindMe 64 days
---
It is lots of fun and there is so many gear options with the 1.12 itemization it will be cool!
---
I'm not trying to stop you. I want you to do it.
---
I made a good chunk of gold selling 45 minute baron runs. It was a fair price, allowed me to make money(split 4 ways with guild mates) and allowed someone a fair way to purchase a group who could do the instance easily with them.
---
Never got a complaint or a unsatisfied customer, and never felt like it was something ‚Äúscummy‚Äù
---
Oh good.  I'll know which server is the one loaded to the tits with totally toxic dbags.
---
I want one on each of my boobies
---
I sincerely hope you're serious. After that blacklist soda shit the other day I had considered not even playing. Would be lovely to have one server protected from those people.
---
what the fuck no lol
---
Pfffft.  Sure the Alliance had a couple bad generals to keep things grey, but those bad guys get OUTED as pieces of shit by the rest of the Alliance.
---
Everyone always makes a big deal about locking up the orcs, but that complaint is one of the dumbest things ever.  Think about it. Some random giant green monsters appear *literally* out of nowhere and start raping and pillaging their way across the human countryside, slaughtering innocent people, burning down villages and eventually the capital.  They have no message, no demands, just rape and murder.  Once they're FINALLY defeated they pull a "thanks fam, but we were totally under mind control the whole time...  we're not actually all warmongering monsters, honest engine!" 
---
Riiiiight but the alliance were just a bunch of Nazi's for locking their asses up?  The orcs are LITERALLY foreign invaders of the worst possible kind.
---
Both sides have shades of grey, obviously.  But for the alliance, the "horrible villains" are far more often the exception while for the horde it's the honourable heroes who are the exception.  
---
Tauren are cool tho.  Ain't nobody got beef with them.
---
I only have one question. During my time sing druid, I have never figured why and when should I use tiger rage ?
---
So it cuts both ways. I see issues here then
---
Blizzard should perma ban the accounts of the creators of this mod. Who the fuck are you to take over a server and build a Hitler state in it?
---
We really are serious. I know this seems like trolling, but we have no intention of letting streamers have any level of influence on our chosen server, especially after how many of them responded positively to soda's comments.
---
We honestly don't have an issue with a lot of streamers. Joana's streams have been great. But we cannot play favorites as it would risk the integrity and thus the trust of our realm's citizens in our mission.
---
I miss in vanilla logging into my alts at dragon spawns or kazak and seeing a alliance one or another horde and immediately try and get as many as we could and the epic fights that would ensue. Especially emeriss I believe with the mushrooms? Good times
---
I‚Äôm gonna go with all of them. They all reward either a BiS item for your level or a pet, IIRC
---
They want to blacklist stream snipers, not twats that just follow them. Which in my opinion while stream sniping is stupid and pathetic, its still the streamers responsibility, they decided to stream, no one forced them, they should be well aware of the consequences as they are aware of the benefits. Frankly this whole blacklist makes me want to avoid streamers even more, innocent players are gonne get blacklisted too just wait, all it takes is a streamer to get heated then black list them, and theyre human they do get heated. Honestly if they want to play classic like how soda was complaining that he cant stream and play it how he wants, then stop streaming for it? Simplest solution. Yes people will say "but its their career." So what, everyone has to make sacrifices sometimes. They chose this, complaining about stream sniping and saying blizz should ban them for it is just childish. Esport competitions I get it, but just a video game? No, not when you have it up for the whole world to see.
---
See I thought only a few gave good items. Like I know the blood gold robes are great. But I think the first offhand you get is pretty meh
---
Omg barrens chat is going to own you ‚Äúsuper woke‚Äù people so hard and I cannot wait.
---
Also who is downvoting me for asking for advice üòÇ
---
Good original joke
---
They shouldn't do anything. You can and will get camped on a PvP regardless if you're a streamer or not. It comes with the territory. 
---
Let's not even mention all the times people will be falsely accused of stream sniping because they camped a streamer. 
---
Here's how you don't get camped as a streamer, don't stream or play on a PvE server. You have options to protect yourself. If they don't they shouldn't expect any sympathy and they don't deserve any.
---
For there who have taken vacation to play WoW, how long do you expect to be unable to login?
---
What if you find out someone wants to start streaming after they're already in the system? Will there be methods in place to report that? Maybe there should be a demerit system for talking about streaming too positively, and rewards when people report enough pro-streamer activities and sentiments
---
It's still not nearly the same level as private servers.
---
Pathetic
---
Good effort sir.
---
"Your precise location will be broadcast to all members of the opposite faction" and this is where you would get banned. Cross faction collusion is a bannable offense. Going off your "No changes". [https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8](https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8) don't let your own actions come back around to bite you.
---
I, too was 12 once.
---
And how do you think anyone should get 1000 gold to sell? Is there a "get infinite gold" hack?
---
Streamers are not representative of the overall player demographics.
---
If its content in the game, its worth doing.
---
\&gt;  Why is this subs hard on for avoiding streamers?  
---
A private army of 100 people at your beck and call really distorts a lot of the PvP and world boss design patterns. It is typical to have a guild to several compete, but the influence of streamers far exceeds what the world was originally designed to accommodate for fun.
---
Why would you not just do them? They‚Äôre not exactly difficult and it‚Äôs experience. 
---
And why am I being downvoted?
---
Thanks, good to know.
---
Why would carry‚Äôs be banned? They are not against rules. 
---
Gold sellers, yes, very much agree with you....they should be banned ASAP.
---
Holy shit, I really hope this is a troll post. I would rather play on a server wit every streamer on it than cancerous assholes that will literally blocking you for not downloading their addon on their server.
---
I'm one of these people. There is a difference with blizzard providing these addons in their game and some rando coding it. Blizzard is a big gaming company, they cannot devote their developers time to one tiny aspect of the game forever. A rando can devote all their time to make their addon the best in the world. Another person posted a video that an addon creator uploaded who said he was watching twitch streams and talking to streamers to get an idea of how to make his addon better. Think blizz is going to give that much attention to a tiny part of the UI?
---
Let blizz give us a solid base experience and let us customize it to how we want.
---
Selling runs is allowed and has been confirmed as allowed forever now, so long as payment is ingame only
---
First of all, of our original group only 1 has gotten obese and 8 years in the military he just ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt give a fuck anymore‚Äù. Secondly I will have you know I can‚Äôt get a relationship to last longer than 2 months, let alone a wife. Third my friends kids all happen to look just like their fathers. And finally. Jesus that attack was scathing.
---
 I was a freshman in highschool when wow came out trying to balance sports, academics, girlfriend and wow. I just got off the phone with my best friend and all we do is work 60 hours a week and the only reseason I don‚Äôt allow myself to get obese is I don‚Äôt want to have to work to get laid.
---
You Zoomers really are fucking savages and I love it.
---
I have no idea I‚Äôll give you my vote lol. But I think it‚Äôs like is it worth it. Especially cause I roll ally and a lot of them have you going to barrens and stuff I mean. Is it worth to go tht far outta the way.
---
Xp aside what items are must haves
---
It's a blacklist, not a whitelist. You only go on the list once you're found out to be a streamer, belong to a streamer guild, or, if after 14 days of being alerted of your non-compliance, refuse to use the addon. 
---
If anyone is ever confirmed to be a streamer, they will go on the list. Unfortunately we have to uphold a zero tolerance policy. There are some streamers we think are beneficial to the community, such as the speedleveler Joana, but to maintain the integrity of the addon and our mission, even he would not be welcome.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúyou‚Äù, this is not his video. This video is from Hirumaredx, one of WoW‚Äôs ‚Äúkinda-well-known‚Äù content creators.
---
Oh you sweet summer child....
---
Going from the notes it's not actually designed to be able to be opened. Not a bug.
---
Oh, I completely like it!
---
Firstly I thought it's Lord Voldemort coming in here again
---
You linked to an old version of the EULA. Cross-faction collusion was removed from the EULA many years ago. There's literally a potion in Retail that allows you to communicate across factions.
---
You can peep my post history if you want.
---
Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they suddenly like what you don't like. You don't understand the Blizzard ToU.
---
god damn you're fucking stupid.
---
**Lets mass report gold sellers** - This was a good statement.  
---
**Lets also mass report people who are selling runs for gold and not breaking any rules at all** - You couldn't resist destroying all of your credibility in the same paragraph, could you?
---
This is pretty great, I actually hope this works. I like streamers, but god damn i'll do anything to not play on their servers.
---
Strain anything with that reach there, buddy?
---
No you don‚Äôt understand. They don‚Äôt want to be ganked but they want to be able to gank other players.
---
The robe and the trinket, for sure.
---
Oh fuck off. You make it racist by your implication.
---
God it was the opposite for us. Ended up leaving illidian that way. Felt like a ‚Äúcowards way out‚Äù with the great competition but it was a lot more enjoyable to actually be able to play and enjoy it. I don‚Äôt think I ever saw the flight into any capital city on illidian.
---
You have invested too much effort into this.
---
Yeah those are the only 2 I can come up with tho
---
What changes are you even referencing? All I'm saying is that they let the community vote on any updates.
---
A day probably lol, I took 2 weeks off
---
literally everything in new gets flooded with downvotes for some reason
---
Yeah you are right looks like the original math was wrong. Question though as you stated you used max damage for the calcs. Would that 15% more damage for the axe be under optimal conditions? Is it closer if we use the average damage?
---
This is definitely a cool way to ding 60 :D
---
Oh, that‚Äôs weird lol
---
go play in traffic. You're so fucking dumb if you think streamers are the thing thats gonna cause problems with population. Holy fuck how stupid can you be
---
Ziqoftw ftw
---
&gt;mortal strike is a wasted debuff.
---
Then stay arms and just dont use that one ability?
---
Selling runs is perfectly fine.
---
Dude! I use this addon and have been for many iterations, I‚Äôm kind of hoping you could do enemy cast bars as well? It would be really sweet at that point as a nice all - in - one.
---
Just a hope. Thanks for it as it is!
---
Yep.
---
Streamers are cancer. Low skill annoying personalities.
---
If I find out a streamer is on my server. I end their career. Grief to the max
---
I gave you an upvote good sir
---
Since there was talk of keybindings I thought I'd share how I play. So the primary action bar is set essentially in a numpad like fashion on this pad and I use modifier keys on my mouse to choose between secondary action bars. All movement is via the d pad using my thumb.
---
I just cannot play without this. And have been using it almost daily since about 2006.
---
The second guild I raided with in vanilla had one MS warrior in it for the raids. His damage was okay, but he was often throttled because of his threat generation (even with salvation). I ended up switching from prot to fury in AQ40 and could beat him on the damage meters with my piece mail DPS gear from raid leftovers. 
---
I wouldn't recommend it, but if you aren't in a super progressive focused guild you can probably get away with it.
---
Yea lol, derp
---
Gotta give um that one hour buff that costs a reagent.
---
Agreed. It's sort of tough nut to crack because I want to avoid their cult of crybabies but I also wanted to avoid pserver neckbeards. Yall smashing all content to grief them means either I get carried through everything because so many have it on farm or i get shit on by everyone in any competitive portion of the game... its a head scratcher for sure.
---
I've never seen so many fucking people get so butt hurt about a server they're gonna play on. Do you know how fucking big the world is... do you brain dead fucks think that someone who streams for a living is gonna be the same level as any of you to affect your gaming experience? you think that there isn't gonna be some other big douches running around ruining your fucking fun? you're in for a fucking surprise. everything all of you rejects are worried about streamers are gonna encounter those things that you are worried about even more so gonna happen on normal servers than the streamers.... If you honestly think for one moment that because a streamer isn't on your server that there isn't gonna be TONS of ppl farming the ore you want, the herbs you want, anything you want to skin. Oh the streamer is being funneled gold from everyone??? Ohhh boy who fucking cares?!?!?! Its not like any of you were gonna get the gold from those people. Legit to any of you who think they are gonna have their game ruined because of a streamer you need to rethink your whole fucking life because the world doesn't revolve around you.

Well, improved stealth from the racial is helpful but beyond that, dwarf rogue is superior because of stone form. Being able to remove bleeds and such is by far better than nelf.

You‚Äôll still find yourself having to wait a bit between Shadow bolts to avoid pulling threat

I want to be a paladin, but I also want to go horde. So I will miss one of those.
---
It's under the map there's lots of places where you can go that you aren't meant to.
---
Carry selling is frankly rich privilege.   Just like in real life, the rich use middlemen to do something that would otherwise be illegal.

I stopped playing before BC but want there some rare spawn Barrens cat that used to be somewhere in that vicinity?
---
What was the point of those runs?  A chance at a mount?
---
Nothing is stopping you from earning lots of gold to buy carries.  It's just another way to play the game.
---
Thanks man, you sold it. Never starting classic, seems like a huge waste of time lol.
---
There wont be 80 people camping anybody at any given time, dont be ridiculous.
---
This is a bad take and obviously shows you know nothing about how streamers will effect the economy, faction balance, world pvp, and pve content.
---
I love the Paladin because I enjoy the way the spells are simple but extremely powerful.  They're incredibly durable, both with plate and Divine Shield.  And they have the ultimate saving spell, Lay on Hands.  At endgame they have effectively unlimited mana, since higher crit levels means more mana return.
---
If you find it boring to have fewer spells, or if you really want to use multi-target heals, then the priest is the better choice.  And generally, the Shadow Priest is a better offspec for a Holy Priest than Ret is for a Holy Paladin (so soloing will be easier for a priest both while leveling and at max level).
---
But I love how the pally works and how good it is at its job of not dying and making other people not die too.
---
Yeah, right. lol
---
.5 gear set. I honestly don‚Äôt even remember which piece, wasn‚Äôt something I ever bothered with but it was a way for casuals to get good epic gear otherwise unattainable and was a nice way for us to make money.
---
Its annoying when you're playing with/against somebody and they are just given everything they need.
---
Nothing is stopping you from earning a billion dollars picking up potatoes, so that you can buy politicians.   That's the same level of nonsense.
---
If you're going horde then druid is by far the easiest class to get a spot and soak up gear. I'd say druid is better at tanking 5 mans than healing tho
---
Should the gas station attendant be charged for selling candy to a drug dealer?

the current animation is crap it is like a stag or deer, btw all the herbivore 4 legged mounts have same animations in retail wow. Example travel form, stag, moose, deer, horse all have same animations.
---
Gnome/Dwarf are the best races for PvP on alliance side, doesnt matter the class. They are like the Orcs/Undeads from alliance.
---
My guy is just salty, that he wont be able to get scarab Lord hahahahahahah
---
You pick a class on character creation.
---
Gnome/Dwarf is a better race choice for Rogues.
---
You never saw a raid go into a capitol on Illidan? Really? They happened on the regular my dude. You missed out hard.
---
Has anyone ever considered that streamers might be a godsend in this regard..taking them out of the population for everyone else?
---
You sit are indeed the real MVP, I've been hoping for something like this.
---
what me an my boys will be playing in 2020*
---
I think they're probably the worst Rogue race overall. If you want to min-max PvP and you play Alliance, Dwarf or Gnome is your best bet.
---
I'd prefer Dwarf simply because Stoneform changes your match up potential against Warriors enough to matter.
---
I found the nelf stealth racial was useful in PvP - many situations you can use it when stealth isn't off cooldown
---
128-103 instead of 154-124 if we use the average swing damage instead of the high-end swing damage. Since the value of `(3.3*300)/14` in our example with 300 AP is static and equals 71, we can just use it with the new numbers.
---
Axe average: 128+71 = 199
---
Sword average: 103+71 = 174
---
199/174=1.14
---
Axe is 14% better assuming we have 300 AP and are using the average swing damage for our formula.
---
What?  In this analogy, the carry sellers are more like the people that launder the money for the drug dealers.
---
I've been painting Orks from 40k, didnt know there were WoW minis too.
---
Looks fantastic too btw lol
---
So amassing an army of sheep to do your bidding ruining the economy and the gameplay of another is against the tos. Woah. Someone should let the twitch group know before they all get banned!
---
I saw tons. I‚Äôm saying the flight trying to load the entire city would result in just lagging out and then appearing at the flight master. I was there for plenty of the city raids and BRM madness.
---
We'll have 120 raid members by AQ launch with the ability to clear BWL with no more than 30 people. That's 4 Scarab Lords.
---
And we plan on selling every one of them.
---
Dual spec, couldn't care less about all else
---
Get mad, friend. :D
---
Imagine caring this much about streamers that you plan three months ahead to mess with some one who doesn't even know you exist.
---
We have absolutely no way of knowing whether the gold was purchased illegally or not. That makes us innocent of any crime.
---
ofc I linked an old version of the EULA we are talking no changes here. thats the rules per Vanilla. you want to bring up No streamers in Vanilla so "No changes" no streamers here. well any form of Collusion was bannable back then so hopefully it will be now. I am all for banning the streamers if they are also doing cross faction collusion. Hopefully both of you will get the hammer.
---
dae use mice??!?

Classic is going to use the modern EULA. It will not have a separate one.

There will be PLENTY of people who have no clue or interest in who streams and who doesn‚Äôt. There will be plenty of guilds who could care less about their blacklist efforts. Their overall influence will be negligible. Soda has his head up his ass if he thinks differently.
---
Could you imagine messing up that screen shot lol
---
No, the only people who even bother to watch streamers are people born after WoW came out. The rest of us just don't want to see Pepega OmegaLUL Moon2SMUG LUL LUL every 3 fucking seconds while a horde of 12 year olds run around trying to grief a streamer (and, in turn, griefing everyone in the area). 
---
If I wanted to deal with retarded 12 year olds I'd go play Fortnite
---
Thanks
---
Ypu can turn those off
---
High profile streamers have large following. Said following usually translates into games. So streamers will be instantly making large guilds without any need for advertisement, always run in PvP with a posse, their fans will be gearing them, etc.
---
If you don't mind me asking, what was the name of your guild, an old guild of mine used a tabard like that.?
---
People like you should have a beta key.
---
I'm just hoping for a nice quiet RP-PVP server to relax on. RPers (at least back in Vanilla) were always so chill and friendly.
---
No, until presented with evidence, we don't *know*.
---
Alliance locks get help thanks to paladin's threat reduction buff, and they are much more rare on alliance side so you'll def be picked up for a raid
---
i love it
---
I've tried out a druid on a private server and I love it. Mana is indeed a very important and scarce resource, but in the open world, gathering, farming and pvp there is no class that feels better (for me). I dont plan on doing much PVE/raiding in classic, so I'm not really bothered on how competitive the class is, numbers wise.
---
There's a compromise that could work if a streamers wanted to allow players to avoid them while maintaining a server anonymity head start:
---
Announce 2 or 3 servers they specifically won't be rolling on.
---
Escape Artist is spectacular against mage. With very good play, it is good enough in that situation to sometimes put you over the top and win you the 1v1. This is ordinarily a borderline unwinnable matchup for the rogue (even as gnome it is still big advantage mage). I imagine this is why experienced vanilla rogue pvpers like Perplexity choose gnome.
---
Chat on the RP servers was actually pretty legit.
---
I stopped playing WoW in 1.12, I'm not losing anything. :D
---
I really hope they do RP-PVP, that was my jam in Vanilla. Really created an immersive experience because everyone is in on it.
---
You are the one bring up blizzard tou lol. Dont play on a pvp server its pretty simple.
---
What server you playing on?  Like to add it to the list.
---
Gaggle is satan. That‚Äôs all I gotta say about vanilla WoW

The same as they did for wow since burning crusade. Which is why people bitched for changes and thus came sharding.
---

There's nothing entitled about avoiding servers that players with massive followings that influence the entire server use.
---
Hey man, what's that cool clip thing your using to hold the model? Been thinking about getting into that recently and that thing would really help with my shaky hands.
---

I was demo/afflic. 1 SB crit would knock off 1/2 to 2/3 of a full HP bar on most players, and you could launch them in pairs with a proc of the nightfall talent. All while your pet was whaling away and the dot collection ticked down. 
---
While obviously satirical, this post is probably a little closer to reality than you might first suspect: Warlocks were good at many things during this era, but we were far and away the best multi-target battlers. Tab+Dotting in 5v5 with extra sustain for every victim, including pets (siphon life), mixed with some of the game's strongest CC and a pet because why tf not? In open-world PvP and BG's, you got to mix in soulstone, too!
---
Curse of Doom couldn't be cast on players, though. I'd have opened every fight with a minute of CCing and kiting.
---
It was around this time that Rogues got Cloak of Horseshit, though, because Blizz just couldn't stomach letting the cowardly, overconfident little fucks pick a fight they couldn't faceroll their way out of when things turned sour.
---
Depends really on how much details you are willing to paint, this picture was taken after about 1-2 hours and it's still very work in progress.
---
Hello, Elicas, glad to see you here. Have you decided what server are you going to roll on? As far as I know, you are a PvE player.
---
(We both were volunteers on the same PS project, but I had another nickname.)
---
Thanks :D
---
I'm picking alliance cuz I'm rolling a lock focused on raiding and paladin's threat reduction buff let's me do more Shadow bolts

Get back to work haha you‚Äôve got too much time.

Wow man big thank to you man wow, thank, man
---
It's called Citadel painting handle and is sold by Games Workshop, if you have a hobby store for Warhammer they will have it in stock, sells for less then 10 dollars.
---
From the way you type I can tell you don't have what it takes. Sorry smooth brainer. Better luck in the future.
---
Nice job making up a bunch of hypotheticals with no proof lmao.
---
Not my video, just sharing
---
Just FYI, locks have always been competitive in dps, from the beginning.
---
But yes, you can expect to be able to be even more so, as the warlock was a superb class to play in 1.12. That being said, what u/Forbes-23 said is still absolutely correct: If you have some back-to-back SB crits, especially early in a fight, you will have to wait, or you WILL pull aggro. There is no tank mechanic in the game game, that survives the glory that is the ISB+Ruin dynamic duo :P
---
Hi picking alliance cuz , I'm dad.
---
At worst? I couldn't think of any worse streamer to have on your server holy shit.
---
It actually has the potential to ruin world PvP in phase 2. Not that it's going to be fun for a lot of players, optimizing some boxer comp to rank is going to be extremely lame.
---
LOL
---
Honestly, every guild should have 1 feral tank.  Most probably won't, but the demand will be there.
---
AWESOME!
---
Epic true
---
I heard an interview where they said that
---
Its nothing like professional sport. The dedication. The training. The drive. Dont compare the two.
---
thats_the_joke.bmp
---
Straight hot epic
---
I want to avoid streamers so much, thank you for this.
---
Epic ... the wPvP is something real ! ... hate ... friendship ... struggle ... feeling of fulfillment ... and why? ... game is designed to encourage people to build such stories ... game by itself is nothing ... people are pushed by the game to make it EPIC !!!
---
Actually? Never heard of such a thing
---
Dude! Thank you! Will be picking one up.
---
I enjoy Asmon's streams that are uploaded to YouTube but he does say some dumb shit at times. I mostly watched him because he has been championing Classic for a while and shitting on Retail.
---
Soda has always had a bad attitude and as year's went on, he seems to have gotten even more entitled and toxic.  Dude is just like the people that complain about getting ganked on forums while playing a pvp realm.
---
I've recently started watching Venruki videos and he seems fairly chill. Especially in a video where he admitted he was wrong about writing off classic as nostalgia.
---
I'm not going to check what servers the streamers are on but was just going to pick a pvp server at launch and hope for the best so I can dive right into leveling. I'm still not sure what I'll end up playing as I'm torn between making a gnome warlock or an undead mage.
---
Good thread, it seems Blizzard are keeping an eye on Reddit, so this should hopefully get fixed because of you.
---
This is just magical.
---
The point is those benefits aren't proportional to just bringing another mage. Resto or bear tank druids are less of a liability.
---
And the streamer hate circle jerk continues...
---
Echeyakee, quest white lion.
---
Your t-shirt sales too?
---
"Player's that don't care about streamers" aren't going to be part of any blacklisted group. If you hate the streamers and want to snipe them and ruin things for them, that's still caring about streamers. You're right that the people that don't care will be the largest group, but you aren't part of that group. Anti-fans are still fans. People that really don't care will be minding their own business and not having anything to do with anything streamer related.
---
This is why a guild, after no longer needing at least one certain piece of loot, auctions the loot and allows the locked in bidder to continue attending said raid until it drops. 50% upfront payment to make sure the buyers are committed.
---
I feed them pork ayyyy lmao
---
One of the main reasons Im waiting about two weeks or more after launch to pick a server.

"Please stop enjoying the game the way you like to play it?"
---
Hi, /u/1234typ
---
I wish this sub would talk less about streamers.
---
No they wouldn't
---
You are definitely going to get banned for this behaviour - actively stating you plan to grief a player until the leave the realm will absolutely earn you action from blizzard. They will not tolerate you thinking you can decide who gets to play on your realm and who doesn't.
---
 &gt;I am a pretty hardcore pvper 
---
Then you won't regret playing nightelf.
---
Shadowmeld has a passive, something people tend to forget, that increases your stealth-rating, meaning, Nelf rogues are harder to detect than any other rogue. Plus, and this is were it becomes crazy, you can activate Shadowmeld while stealthed (and vice versa), having both abilities stealth ratings STACK.
---
In this configuration, people can face-first run through you, and will likely not see you. I leave it to your PvP brain to figure out how much fun you can have with that.
---
lol staysafe, jesus christ these streamer dickriders make me laugh
---
Easy being oceanic get to dodge all this bs
---
Ehh I would take 1 to either 20man or MC maybe even BWL.
---
You mean I can't have my cake and eat it too?

The real getting ready for Classic information we need.

No amount of corpse camping has ever resulted in a ban.

I developed a personal addon that did similar chat functions for all character names that ended with 'qt' 'xd' 'godx' etc. let me know if you need help, this sounds hilarious.
---
Can confirm. Been playing on a big pserver and it is REMARKABLE how toxic the playerbase is as a whole right now. If there is no fear of being reported, people turn into fucking animals.
---
Wow....this is....illegal? I think illegal...
---
Retard ass bro  who can play 24 hours a day for a week?
---
Do you really believe he can afford his moms basement?
---
Sword spec is still really good and there are ways to get better sword skill outside being human. If you use your gnome-ness to get PvP gear more reliably or quickly than humans, then that makes you better than human rogues until AQ40 at least.
---
To be fair though: getting R14 is quite hard
---
Personally I wish you over-elitist players the same I wish for all the streamers and their fanboys: Play on your own server and celebrate your server first kills with yourself.
---
If streamers are the pest, you might very well be the Cholera for a lot of us ‚Äúnormals‚Äù

I configured all my keybinds to a Dance-Pad, so when you see them deeps flowing, you know that [everyday I'm shuffling](https://youtu.be/KQ6zr6kCPj8?t=220)!

But if you get a cake, why the f would you not eat it?

Here before Asmongold opens this post on stream to make fun of it with his viewers to boost his self-esteem because he has a twitch chat backing him up
---
I get that selling runs for in game cash isn't against the rules, but it does feel a little against the spirit of the game.  The point of the game is to progress on your character.  Sale runs kind of bypass that progress.
---
I don't know that you can report those people, but I kind of get what OP is saying.
---
I think what they will do is progress the Classic server into TBC and then create fresh Classic servers starting at Phase 1 to replace them.
---
Found the fanboy!
---
Technically all games that use the [battle.net](https://battle.net) platform use the same EULA. It got redefined almost 2 years ago to cover everything that [battle.net](https://battle.net) does. If it's on [battle.net](https://battle.net) it's covered by the same EULA.
---
Waifu2x isn't kind to text, and neither are the heavy denoising filters.
---
Well, unlike the streamers that intend to keep their realm choice a secret, we'll be announcing ours as soon as possible, so you'll have no problem avoiding us.
---
Np mate
---
It's not even a matter of unique abilities. When they moved loot to personal, and removed all class unique buffs, they created a natural incentive to just bring whatever is overtuned the most.
---
There are multiple ways to progress on a character. You do what you're good at.
---
If you're good at making money, you buy your gear.

Like I said, I probably will. But it is still the only thing that makes me think twice about going female.

Ok, but you are lumping in people into a group you are merely making assumptions about.

Did you not read the post or something
---
They'll probably get ganked a lot more than the average player precisely because of stream sniping.
---
I can't blame them for wanting to just play the game like a normal player would without having to worry about stream snipers or being swarmed by fanboys, but this is the career they've chosen. There's a simple way to get away from it all and it's to stop streaming.
---
&gt; I always kinda thought the horse animations in WoW were shitty. **Especially how the players just stay stiff on the horse's back.** 
---
I'm going to guess you've never ridden a horse before.
---
Selling gold and selling runs are two completely different things.
---
And this didn't happen organically anyway though? 
---
As much as I find streamers annoying, there were always those "super guilds" that were essentially the Walmart brand of PvP guilds where they traveled in herds with no skill. 
---
the problem with streamers won't be the other faction it's going to be on your own when they're destabilizing the economy and giving away what were once proud achievements for free because they're popular.
---
Farm the crests that drop off the elementals in Arathi Highlands. They are for the Warrior quest for the whirlwind axe and people will pay for them for their main/alts.
---
If you used Twitch and looked in the WoW category, you would easily see Shroud and all the other huge streamers like Summit who are playing the beta.
---
Dwarf Priest for sure.   If you prefer to play dps then you could go with gnome warlock.   There's always a shortage of locks on alliance due to WotF.   Even human could work if you don't like gnomes (although gnomes do have the better caster racials).
---
Why should they not tank a fight?
---
I definitely did not know you could stack them in Vanilla. I know in other expansions it would break stealth.
---
I love how some players always associate WoW RP with sitting on people in Goldshire.
---
I understand your point, and you're not wrong.  But WoW is an MMO, not a gold simulation game.
---
Yesterday, some smalltime WoW streamer on beta was trying to sell his Staff of Jordan to Cdew for a month of stream hosts.  Idk if Cdew took the deal or not, but doesn't that stuff feel kind of shitty.  I get the same kind of feeling from in game gold sales.
---
I don't take this view at all.
---
Except my undying love and affection
---
Hi, /u/Author_33
---
You guys need to take your professionally wounded agitator bigotry and go and spoil someone else's hobby with your cry bully toxicity.
---
Stay away from our games. You are not welcome.
---
Holy isn't necessary at all. The real problem is mana as you won't normally have any Int on your gear while leveling, pick up a few bits of int gear you find and remember to down rank heals to conserve mana usage and you'll be fine.
---
Yes, that player should be banned.
---
And the economy of WoW is a huge part of the game. To some players, it's the best or only part.
---
This should be the norm for EVERY pvp server.
---
Guild up, grief them h24. Make the audience bored of watching them run to corpse
---
I don‚Äôt see how your pet isn‚Äôt dying or you having to spend half your mana pool healing it if it‚Äôs taking 3mobs at a time. Why not utilise your own health pool as a resource by tanking.
---
There will be plenty of other servers for you to choose from. At least we'll be announcing ours before launch, unlike some streamers that have pledged to keep theirs a secret.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Same server
---
Since I assume we're actually no longer making goofy jokes, I'll respond seriously. Sure the orcs had a brief period of time when they were invading Azeroth, and for a brief period within that brief period, the humans of the Eastern Kingdoms did not know from where they came. But Medivh was killed in WCI after his treachery was exposed, long before the events of the Second War (and the demons of the Burning Legion were known to Azeroth for ten thousand years before), so to profess that the humans somehow just couldn't figure out that the orcs were being controlled by literal demons that were literally showing up and commanding those orcs, despite having taken out the corrupted Last Guardian after his own apprentice personally showed up to King Llane and Anduin Lothar and said "Hey by the way my master is possessed by the dark titan Sargeras and he's the one responsible for the orc invasion, and they're all being controlled by demons", means that they are either bone-chillingly stupid or blindly vengeful.
---
I have no qualm with the humans' initial defense against the Old Horde. But yeah, their current behavior is laughably despicable. It's like the equivalent of modern Poles capturing and torturing modern Germans because older Germans invaded older Poland, even though it is obvious to any passerby that the German Nazi Party has long been forcibly disbanded. Even by the end of the First War, Orgrim had challenged Blackhand to mak'gora and won, slaying much of the Shadow Council in the resulting coup. Gul'dan fell into a coma.
---
And by the way, the orcs *won* the First War canonically, so saying they were defeated is inaccurate. Orgrim didn't "burn and kill everything" after that victory. He tried to amass his armies in a safe location while rooting out the fel corruption and leading his people back to their shamanic honor, and his military hand was forced by the human resurgence in Lordaeron. After the Second War was waged, not as an indiscriminate invasion but as a calculated ploy to save his species with targeted warfare, he was captured and held as a pet by King Terenas. His people were put into concentration camps to fight for amusement as gladiators or else work to death as chattel slaves (something that he notably *didn't* do to the humans upon the conclusion of the First War).
---
Claiming that the "honorable heroes . . . are the exception" for the Horde is clearly bogus. Even in the history preceding WoW, many orcs were desperately trying to free themselves, they were the ones who excised their own corrupting fel influence (before Gul'dan tried to poison them a second time after awakening from his coma), and both the Second and Third Wars were fought by a largely honorable Horde trying to make amends for the dark past inflicted upon it by a select group of Warlocks and a particularly pernicious Pit Lord. I make no attempt to argue that the First War was in any way the humans' fault, nor that they weren't justified in defending themselves to their fullest extent. But to learn at the end *exactly* why and how the Old Horde was being controlled by the again very well-understood Burning Legion, and then nevertheless continue to hunt down the remaining orcs in years to come and commit various war crimes against them, is an abandonment of any honorable intention the humans may have had. The human leaders weren't just supposed to "take their word for it" that the Orcs had been controlled by the BL; they had as concrete of evidence as a medieval justice system could ask for that it was their own Guardian of Tirisfal who started the cascade.
---
To once again use the actual Nazis as a military example, there was no doubt that much of Germany tacitly tolerated Nazi behavior even if they weren't actively supporting members. There were even soldiers who were acting as willing agents of a zealous murder machine. And the Allies were totally justified in invading Nazi Germany to take out its leaders and put the surviving ones on trial for war crimes. But if the Americans decided after WWII was concluded that they would simply execute or imprison *all Germans everywhere for several decades* as opposed to specific high-ranking officials, after knowing damn well that it was the leaders who organized and committed the major atrocities of the war, they would no longer be acting honorably.
---
The Alliance in the First War is not the Alliance in the Second and definitely not the Third Wars. The Alliance in the Second and Third Wars is petty and vengeful, clearly torturing helpless and lethargic orcs or hunting them down in execution squads. They used the orcs as a massive scapegoat to willfully turn a blind eye to the actual threat that had engineered the First War, and it nearly resulted in the destruction of Azeroth were it not for Thrall's Horde literally saving the day on Mount Hyjal despite him personally being enslaved by humans since birth. His combined contingent of Darkspear Trolls, Tauren, and Orcs was absolutely pivotal in this regard, and like his mentor before him, he fought tooth and nail to root out and destroy any possible fel corruption within his peoples' bloodlines.
---
So when we're talking about the events of World of Warcraft, we aren't discussing the morality of a largely blameless human army versus a totally unknown extraplanetary invasion force of orcs. We're discussing the morality of a group of isolationists (i.e., the non-human parts of the Alliance) and petty racists trying to hunt down an obviously reformed contingent of escaped slaves and noble shamans because they can't get their priorities straight and focus on the actual existential threat that nearly annihilated them six years prior (and didn't succeed precisely because those slaves and shamans willingly came to the aid of the then-nascent Alliance).
---
**tl;dr Humans of the First War were the clear good guys versus the clear bad guys of the Old Horde. WoW takes place 26 years after those initial events, 25 years after the humans learned that the orcs were initially being controlled by the Burning Legion, 25 years after the orcs took drastic steps to cast off said Burning Legion, 20 years after winning a decisive victory at the Blackrock Spire, 20 years after rounding up the orcs and putting them in literal concentration camps, 9 years after the New Horde forms, and 6 years after that New Horde saves them at Hyjal. They're well aware that an intergalactic army of demons is trying to actually eat them alive, they're well aware that their Northern Kingdoms have fallen to another army of magical zombies that also want to eat them alive, and yet they think it's wise to keep indiscriminately hunting down and purging the New Horde anywhere they can because that makes sense and definitely isn't motivated by deep-seated racism and/or misplaced vengeance.**

Edgy but I like it.

It's cool to see you're implementing hunter's auto shot timers and stuff from YaHT. I can't test so I'll have to ask, but in 1.12.1 I've had a lot of issues before with instant shots breaking autoshot timers. I think it was just a side-effect from what developers had to work with in the vanilla API, but please tell me classic's API is better.
---
I sure hope so. From 4.0 to 7.3, female blood elf bow animations were broken and wonky, and it took someone working on Alleria's model to go "wait, what the hell is going on with this animation?" before they fixed it so.. I'm not *too* hopeful LOL. But maybe it'll be different with this since it's a classic thing not being accurate to OG classic.
---
Here's the guide.  Don't do it.
---
This is it for me really...you can keep duel specs, and new classes...just lemme share a bank with my guildies
---
Watched Unbreakable's video and switched from dwarf warrior to orc shaman.

Shockingly enough, people tend to change over the course of 7+ years. Especially in their 20s.

Soda grew his original fanbase with a *very* different attitude than what he has now. He was basically a less-socially inept xQc.

My first character was a Blood Elf Paladin... back when they got their power by leeching it from an imprisoned demigod.  Why worship the light when you can bend it to your will, right?
---
Going to miss everything about that.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=291719/claim-your-character-name-in-classic-character-creation-starts-august-12th-13th
---
Simple solution: get a sufficiently large number of people, regardless of what server they're on or if they know there's a streamer nearby, to regularly /yell the name of the server. It'll show up on their stream, at the very least in speech bubbles above characters.
---
Female Dwarf Warrior Tank &lt;3 never a letdown

id imagine its similar to rppve except you can actually kill opposite faction players so theres a stronger sense of community

Did the XP on/off function exist in 1.12?

I did both, okay. I bought gold, and sold runs.  I am a pos.

Basically you will be forced to carry around an extra set of armor around at all times. Keep a full mail/plate set for str/stam for leveling and another set of whatever you find that has intelligence on it, and later on anything that has +healing. Even if you were playing a damage pally its better to keep those around just in case the normal healer leaves anyways, and you can just take over their slot and get one of the millions of DPS looking for a group.
---
Yes, it's called autism.  They have it.
---
&gt; has to take minimal effort, no?
---
RP servers do take more work for Blizzard by GMs because of the strict rules and need to punish those breaking the rules.   
---
I am not sure why Blizzard didn't make them.  Maybe they know the hatred that comes with PvP servers will mean a lot more reports on a RP-PvP server.  I can see someone getting ganked and then reporting the ganker in anger.    
---
But at this point, given how popular Classic will be, Blizzard just needs to have enough GM staff to handle reports.
---
They deserve all the shit they get, they want to get all of the streamer's benefits without any downside. .
---
Sometimes, it isn't the streamer - its the Twitch community. 
---
There's a few streamers I wouldn't mind playing with (Madseason, Frost, Peach, etc), but I'd rather avoid the Twitch mob as much as possible.
---
those 2 cd's are kinda the reason druids are that good at lv30, arent they?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt imagine it is. Deliberately putting yourself at a disadvantage by using a 3rd party program hardly seems like something Blizzard could faithfully enforce standards on.
---
If you want to play a Paladin Tank. Do it. You will raid as Holy to get gear and then you will Tank 5-10 man's like a boss and everyone on your server will love you because of how fast your dungeons go.
---
But that's it for you and your tanking dreams. The train stops there.
---
i like it, i dig it

Also don't forget to mention the 5-second rule as well as mana potions.
---
Because we shouldn't have to. [If we want to play on a server of our choice without streamers, we will find a way](https://redd.it/by3nd0).
---
Nah mate lvl as Ret. Just have some healing stuff for dungs also have a sword and board pallys are great tanks for trash mobs. 
---
If you can lvl with a pure dps class your utility will help you both lvl faster.
---
Since they plan on beeing in 1 big server party, maybe you can rotatet between different streamers if they happen to be in the same area.  
---
i dont think youll get an instand ban, more like a 3-7 day "kick" first.
---
Why did you put account sharers in quotes like that isn't what they will be doing? lol
---
I use the top row as 1-5 for skills. I use the thumb d-pad for shift/control/alt modifiers. WASD is on the middle/bottom row.  I have tab on the left side of the pad and combined with the alt modifier on the thumb d-pad I can still alt-tab when needed without having to go back to keyboard.
---
[Screenshot from Legion showing my keybind setup](https://i.imgur.com/Q502b9k.jpg)
---
I have Control on the D-pad up, Shift on D-pad right, Alt on D-pad down.  Unmodified 1-5 are for damage abilities, control for damage cooldowns, shift for utility skills, alt for survival cooldowns.
---
This lets me have 20 keybinds that are very accessible without having to change action bar pages. If needed you could even add 10 more keybinds with Control-Shift and Shift-Down for the directionals on the D-pad.
---
I'm so happy that there's not such a big streamer scene in Germany than it's in the us/English speaking country's. I think in German servers there will be little to no impact of streamers.
---
I would just prefer to put a severed head of a horse into streamer's bed while asleep...
---
Because there's a distinction between Blizzard's methods of detecting account sharers and what we'll be doing.
---
They likely won‚Äôt.  They‚Äôre all worried about stream sniping while leveling.  The beta is really giving us a false sense of these streamers.  Right now blizzard is using them to market the game...and on the small beta server the 20 famous streamers can easily claim ‚Äúworld firsts‚Äù and destroy in pvp since they can all group up and roll pugs...but when there are 500,000 new players streamers won‚Äôt claim any ‚Äúworld firsts‚Äù...and they‚Äôll quickly find themselves up against thousands of sweaty pvp clappers.  I know some of them are very talented (cdew, venruki, snutz), but do you guys remember vanilla? There were teams that were in WSG and AB 10 hours a day...and in the world of PVE there are so many crazy hardcore guilds...Rag will go down in the first 10 days and it won‚Äôt be by any of the streamers you can name.  
---
They‚Äôll also be griefed to no end until they can lock themselves into instances 24/7.  Remember Trollgod during the duel tournament? There will literally be 10,000 of him who will sign onto WoW just to ruin Asmon‚Äôs day.  They will follow him as he quests ganking him en masse for horde and literally swarming him on alliance.
---
Oh shit I remember this now
---
Dps meters bannable? How do you improve? Compare spells, rotations, talents?
---
That seems ridiculous.
---
I still use the same merc stealth keyboard that I used during BC.  I've tried those game pads, but just couldn't get the feel of it.
---
I'm planning on going 5 in spirit tap, 14 in Disc (wand dmg-&gt;buff+shield-&gt;all of third row) put 2 points in Holy's healing focus, then shadow from then on. Super consistent mana regen early on, and I wont be stopped from getting my heals off. I do not know if this will work the way I think it will work, but it'll do something maybe.
---
Imagine having to watch someones stream in order to attempt gank them. Bot mentality.
---
Yes of course, you shouldn't have to. Just seems are really huge concern for many so it's an option.
---
What exactly happened after 1.9?
---
Like the Pied Piper for retarded children
---
Bleep bloop?
---
You will be account sharing, who cares, don't sugarcoat it.
---
Definitely mage.
---
Is he the guy that poisons everyone with juice boxes?
---
Not all players are reading forums. You/we may underestimate the composition of this subreddit and the server population.
---
Legion took several steps in the right direction with class fantasy. BFA took all those steps backwards again, then leaped backwards more, and then tiptoed forward by re-adding class buffs thinking that would solve the issue.
---
Oh, and they only added *some* class buffs back. MOTW doesn't even exist in BFA.
---
They why bait out an answer that‚Äôs been asked to death a million times over the last 15 years? 
---
If you‚Äôre so concerned with being hardcore and a min/maxed you think you‚Äôd take the initiative to check google or do a forum search on this subreddit. But since you clearly didn‚Äôt, im going to assume you‚Äôre not that hardcore nor a real min maxer, at which point:
---
It doesn‚Äôt fucking matter.
---
The only people race selection matters to are those that either know the answer, or can be bothered enough to look it up themselves.
---
hunter, all his spells but aimed shot are instant
---
this is really cool, can i use this for some avatars ?
---
Went fucking hard on him man. Lok'tar Ogar brother way to represent
---
Is there a better way to get somebody's exact location?
---
When you are leveling, you don't have gear with special stats like +armor or +healing.  If you don't have +healing, there's no pt in downranking heals, because your top ranked heals are the most efficient. (assuming no overheal).   So, aside from a lack of mana,  you can heal nearly as well as a resto druid for a short time.
---
Nothing really separates bear, and cat gear while leveling.  Leather with agility.
---
I'm sure i'm just opening myself up for more neckbearded attacks (re:check out all the triggered neckbeards replying to me), but I take it that your stance is that popular streamers should get priorities on names over the regular player base (or more generally that streamers should get benefits and additional perks over normal classic wow players)?
---
That really doesn't seem like a thing they had in classic wow. I don't think there's any blizzard design pillar for "priority to streamers".
---
Could you up-load some more pictures of your models my good man?
---
I would love to see all the cool Warcraft miniatures!
---
Listen to this redditor. There's nothing more frustrating than investing 200+ hours into a character and abandoning it at 60 because the gameplay at that level isn't what you expected. But to answer your question, pick a class which can easily get a spot (even for PUGs). Sure, you'll have more competition for gear, but if you consistently raid then eventually you'll get the gear you want. Another factor is the complexity of the class, how easy it is to achieve optimal efficiency, how hard is your rotation, how many other factors do you need to keep attention to, how many consumables do you need before you are ready for raid. If your  role is complex, then you may have a hard time getting a spot if you are not above average. 
---
I would go with Mage. Easy as heck rotation, ~~vending machine~~ food/drink and portal generation, ability to gold farm and good gatherers, so you won't have issues with consumables that much.
---
A raid needs plenty of cloth DPS, so you'll have a spot, and semi-hardcore groups won't have a problem inviting you to a group because you basically spam 1 button, later it evolves into 3 as fire. So there's not much responsibility on your shoulders.
---
xfinity actually.  we don't have spectrum in my area.
---
Fuck off nothing wrong with sale runs. 
---
I like killing dragons not farming gold. Others can‚Äôt commit blocks of time to learning how to slay dragons, so they kill millions of boars. 
---
Myself and mr boar farmer can find a happy middle ground. 
---
That‚Äôs called specialization and comparative advantage, a core pillar of market economics. Everyone loves how mmos have an economy....until they have an economy.
---
Can't we move with these discussions to r/classicwowstreamers ?
---
Ah 200 ms ping the humanity... when I played  vanilla I had satellite Internet with ping of 2000 ms.
---
these people not understanding this are the same ones spamming poggers all over general and trade.
---
All video games are a waste of time. Vanilla rewards you in a very satisfying way per time wasted. As you get better and better gear, your class really feels more satisfying. The difficulty imcreases at a nice pace. With tons of consumables available, there is always to further boost your character. Dying and losing all the buffs you stack up is punishing so there's an interesting incentive to not die. 
---
Yea some content is basically reserved for the elite..  But theres stil plenty of fun to be had!
---
exactly this.
---
Lol y‚Äôall fucking pathetic.
---
Imagine picking your faction based on anything but the size of fem orc tits and the spinning fem dwarf pigtails.
---
Nice I just need to avoid Alliance and Horde, then I‚Äôll be golden
---
You don‚Äôt need to be a dick about it...
---
Amen!
---
Bdudu?
---
Wow man, this is epic
---
How does patch 1.9 impact patch 1.12?
---
‚ÄúCome to our server, we will kill the streamers and subjugate‚Äîerm, allow you?‚Äîto live under our boot instead!‚Äù
---
My first thoughts exactly. Absolutely fantastic art work .
---
If *you* were streaming yourself do that, twitch would ban from their services. 
---
Blizzard won‚Äôt ban you.
---
Ven is mostly chill, but keep in mind he's likely raiding with cdew, sonii, snutz, shroud, etc. So, his server should be avoided if you care about your sanity.
---
The only effect of the addon is being unable to interact with streamers and their associates. It's not slavery.
---
I think the raid times for EU servers for someone living in the US could be pretty difficult without an unusual hours job.  So if raiding is important, it's hard to roll EU.
---
Why are you not in a guild where people talk constantly?  I don't get it.  Why aren't you leveling with another player if you want to be more social? There are players who want to play with someone.  But the active guild is the more obvious thing.
---
Vanilla wow didn‚Äôt have reddit either, so may as well go delete that there account.
---
grats! 
---
would have been way more awesome if you were human
---
Per cast, amout of mobs hit doesnt matter. Would be way too ridiculous otherwise
---
Taking over a blizzard server and forcing people to download a thirdparty addon to play on it tho lol
---
&gt;Multiboxing is allowed as long as one button only instructs one character per press. 
---
Blizz allow one keypress to he sent to every active client, as long as it only performs one input per client.  Otherwise every multiboxer would be breaking the TOS.
---
Oh shit didn't you guys have a really great SPriest too? I remember before I got a DKP streak in MC he could kill me with SW:P + DP ahaha. I remember the names Madden and Rasta, aswell as Sancrotis. Was also a troll shaman who used to be a giant pain in the ass! 
---
Halberd sounds awesome aha. Pre ZHC I ran defence in WSG, but 3 minute mage+that trink often made me the EFC hunter :) 
---
I was a gnome mage at the time, Mightymagic.
---
Nope .. they have a serpate download for beta
---
hah, sounds wonderful! What class did you play? Hunter?
---
Female dwarf master race, y'all don't know what you're missing
---
I think they don‚Äôt realise how busy launch is gonna be. Good luck getting out of the start zone on the first day lol
---
GEWNS :A
---
nice alt account senor streamer
---
You can play on it all you want, you'll just be invisible to your own faction and ultra-visible to the opposite faction. None of the actions automated by the addon are bannable offenses.
---
The new pvp meta is stealing streamers names and selling it back to them.
---
Warrior üò¨üò¨. 
---
But then for BC a Warlock much better.
---
I played on recently on a p server and healing was so boring. Long casts times and only 2-3 variations in healing. I absolutely loved Druid in tbc and wotlk but I think I‚Äôm going to go priest this time round...
---
Plus how on earth would you get laid in the future for buying a mount?
---
Streamers: stream snipers should be banned
---
Soda: stream snipes asmon
---
Venruki: stream snipes asmon
---
Cdew: stream snipes Mitch
---
McConnell: stream snipes everyone
---
Twitter was a thing almost a year before TBC and Twitter did not invent hashtagging, they just popularized it.
---
ok, so 3 stacks of Sunder armor and you were good to go. ;)
---
Most creative way to get banned in 2019. Harassment can and will be sanctioned by blizzard. This isn't a private server where the Admins only bellyrub their Chinese friends.
---
You won't reach critical mass. There's no way normal 
---
people coming back to classic after 15 years to play one of their favourite games are going to buy into your pathetic little power fantasy and install your ridiculous add-on. You should abandon this while you still can and delete all mention of it.
---
Most people will see through you for the little power tripper you are.
---
Try using one of the AI based scalers?
---
what game do you think you are playing here lmao?
---
No worries then, thanks mate
---
I can with 100% honesty say, that I will not miss anything.
---
The game, as it is, is an empty shell. I recently started playing Diablo 2 to pass the time. When you enjoy a 19 year old game, that has a maximum screen resolution of 800x600 and a 30FPS screenrate cap, you know the game you played before is in the toilet.
---
So, why you want a warrior then? I think its not fun at all...
---
Rip totalbiscuit
---
Very nice! Also will there be an option to sort by "non streamer servers" or "low impact streamers"
---
Wow, extremely pathetic. I never watch streams because they are cringy as fuck and you are making me be on the side of streamers on this issue. Just let it go.
---
Sahdow priest VT and damage spells.
---
Define effective
---
Because that would be an invasion of my privacy. Btw, that is some highly socialist propaganda you are spreading.
---
Refusing trades, groups, auctions, and chat from a player is not a bannable offense.
---
Broadcasting the location of a player within your own faction is not a bannable offense.
---
Corpse camping is not a bannable offense.
---
Mob tagging is not a bannable offense.
---
Automating legal actions within the game is not a bannable offense (within the scope of what Blizzard allows in their API).
---
Blacklist addons already exist. We're just taking it to another level.
---
Yea I agree, I mean they are going to basically be ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù in classic wow. 
---
I assume a lot of them will have stream characters they play most of the time, and then personal characters they will play off stream when they need a break and just want to enjoy the game as a normal person. That‚Äôs what I would do anyway.
---
Yeah, our tartan is definitely the best!
---
*tips fedora*
---
You will, until you meet me in SL spec.
---
No I wouldn't but then you would Just Cry. And you have No balls otherwise you would have contacted a Dev by now and got yourself to F&amp;F instead you lurk in Reddit hoping for a Key.
---
Us boomers are slowly wheeling ourselves into the present time and learning all these hip phrases
---
In the words of the man, the murloc, the tiny angry badger himself in World of Warcraft heaven...
---
^EPIC
---
Oh, I got you! Damn. That brings back memories, can we implement the landing lag for authenticity sake?
---
They aren't bad. There is no bad in World of Warcraft. There is average and then there is better based on racials. But there is no bad.
---
It depends on the encounter. Some fights you are asked to be ready to tank, which means tank gear on just dpsing usually with a nightfall to help casters. Some fights you are dedicated to tanking one mob, and some fights you are not expected to tank at all so you are in dps gear(probably nightfalling with hitcap gear).
---
Gold sellers yes, Carry sellers lol hell no.
---
I used to just trade leather. Sometimes it‚Äôd be cheap as hell and I‚Äôd buy all of the leather (of one type) in AH and put it all back on several times more expensive. 
---
People who needed it for a specific piece of gear would pay.  
---
Repeat
---
years ago i threw my back out, i looked much like this when i tried to walk
---
Its easy to have one person do it for each rune and just get summoned back.
---
You can raid fury 2h and 2x1h. 
---
Ideally you‚Äôll want both in your raid for gearing purposes. Rogues, will have prio on daggers, warriors on axes and 2h. They will both fight over fist, mace and swords. 
---
Having your melee split like that will allow the most people to gear up the quickest. 
---
Generally, warriors come into t1 with 2x1h cause Dal‚ÄôRends is so good and easy to get. But raid 2h are good upgrades from there. 
---
That said, arms pve is not good, you eat a debuff slot, have poor rage generation and struggle with damage.
---
Or you just tank the trash and dps/heal on bosses.
---
There is no way to convert Classic Gold to cash or vice versa so no, it's not the same thing.
---
Probably! I don't quite remember and quick google searches didn't bring anything up specifically.
---
That's like seeing a junky doing drugs and think: "I will give it a try". You could've seen the addiction coming from miles away, but yet you still want to do it.
---
The difference is the ost that you are going to listen to...
---
They've seen the polls. And so have everyone else active on reddit and EU. Should be easy to google.
---
Had around 40 or 60k replies, and almost every other poll that's been smaller have the same kind of % distribution between the server types.
---
RP-PvP was a lot bigger, 3x as big, and have always been in every poll since classic was announced.
---
&gt; There are whole teams for companies like this that are dedicated to internal research on numbers like this.
---
Yes, and they've said the reason. Which is flawed and miscalculated (which I explained in very very short). The math has been done, RP-PvP is and will be more popular than RP. And would be in vanilla if it was released at the same time.
---
He's not sugarcoating it you idiot, he's saying they can get away with it easily because the account sharers will not be running accounts on different computers.
---
Hell, I remember tanking a low level instance as a rogue once. And some people swear by Shaman tanking. If we want to get really fancy I want to see some healing tanks. Tanks that get all their aggro from healing themselves (probably a paladin, but bonus points for priest). Only problem I see with the idea is mana issues...but if you've got 4 dps then the fight gets a bit shorter (in theory at least lol).
---
We're missing nightmare fuel.
---
first TB on my old vanilla realm was for a hunter ^¬®,
---
At least RPPVE servers will be safe.
---
The original comment was about blizzard giving priority to streamers for things like names.  more generally that points to giving streamers \_something additional\_ over regular players.  classic didn't have any of that nonsense.  I just want a level starting playing field for everyone.  So I think it does affect me if blizzard chooses to change classic to not have a starting level playing field.  I didn't see any design pillars that said "streamers get more consideration"
---
level as retri and tank all the dungeons 1-55lvl
---
UD male warrior is the coolest warrior class, female is alright for casters.
---
That's the problem, streamers and their twitch chat don't care about anyone else's existence.
---
no argument against that.. 
---
horde pve warlock is still doable...
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZfxqzMxoxZxxbtM0z
---
a spec like that and you take care of your own threat with imp out.
---
hell, imagine an orc lock+black book on a short non-fire resistance fight.. your imp will output the same damage as an extra retridin :p
---
That's what you get for putting yourself out there in public? That's what you get for putting yourself out there in public.
---
Why do you like tonpa
---
If you're ONLY interested in healing, then there are other choices. I'll be rolling a priest as well for pure healing, but also a druid for tanking/dps w/ utility heals
---
RemindMe! 12 Aug 2019
---
So you want to do even worse dps?
---
fair enough.
---
My old ally shaman and my 2 spectral Tigers :/
---
Strong first comment.  Welcome to reddit.
---
I think offtanking is much harder in vanilla than main tanking.  You have to maintain your threat as 2nd on the threat meter, because taunting doesn't actually increase your threat.  At the end of your taunt, the boss just goes back to the highest on threat list.  So you have to become very nuanced in your DPS.  Tank swaps become very difficult in vanilla.
---
But basically you maintain 2nd threat on the boss so if the tank dies or boss drops aggro, he'll hit you next.
---
What you mean a hit in appearance? Dwarf female priests look baller
---
Mate the only time you should care about racials is if you‚Äôre competing at blizzcon for money. It‚Äôs an RPG, play what you think is cool.
---
Not my fault people dont know something and refuse to do research on the subject
---
And then get upset when told and explained in a simple way
---
Then get even more upset being called dumb, not because they disagree but because they got emotionally unstable from a disagreement.
---
And stop reading and ignore the rest cause emotion took over the logical part of their brain.
---
So thats a victory and if you were ever in a debate team in school (if they even have such classes anymore) youd know that.
---
I remember somebody saying this as well.
---
So that's off-tank, off-dps and off-healer then
---
I'll miss being able to look at my abilities page to see what I can learn at upcoming levels.
---
Tanking is an absolute blast. It feels good to have one of the highest importance of a group
---
Honestly all of them have a fair few. 
---
Elemental mage has a lot of instant AoE abilities so that's definitely one to consider, but so does a warlock with dots. Hunters have almost entirely instant casts only aimed shot has a casttime.
---
Useless response.
---
I mean, none of you will still be around in two weeks post launch so no one should have any problems avoiding you
---
Thanks, I can read, yet he put "account sharers" in quotes.  Go fuck yourself and learn to read.
---
Yea okay lets label it a joke once you get called out, never saw that one before....
---
Druids being legit tanks.... well a least till bfa rolled around.
---
Agree, as an european I did consider rolling NA for a while but raiding at 2am is just not a good idea.
---
I won't miss anything. I can still play retail anytime I want.
---
Not bad!
---
Blizzard has never once banned a player for the use of an addon.
---
Kotaku is such a crap source now a days, why dont they write on how Vanilla is about to change the modern game design.
---
I use shift-g, for mount and g for auto run. Moved guild to h.
---
Same with c, I bind it and move character to v instead.
---
So you're saying that ordinary players have be validated by the presence of a streamer on their server?
---
So i did hit a nerve huh? xDD
---
After 4 years of playing pservers with the biggest spergs on this planet... me2 lol
---
To a place that i knooooooww..
---
Hype is dumb and it does not last. Community Investments and Friends last.
---
There is no coalition of 160 hardcore players from private servers that have plans like this lol.  He won't even name the guilds.  It's just trolling.
---
Yes, fuck sharding every day of the week.
---
Idgi, why do you need to seek attention by targeting certain people. Like fam, just go slay out anyone you see. I‚Äôll never comprehend it.
---
I know this feeling. I think healing is more fun, also priest have Mind Control so u can have fun in wpvp
---
They are like fortnite! Taking all the toxic kids to one game(server) so we can play in peace
---
Because we all know that nobody will be allowed to roll a new character on a different server the day after launch day. Everybody is deathly afraid of picking the wrong server and having even five minutes of effort go to waste when it turns out they actually don't want to be on that server.
---
Thats not a warlock. It's a tax collector
---
I think its a satire to point out how ridiculous the streamer blacklist conversation was.  It's basically stating the same thing, but in add-on format.  And honestly, I think that was just a satire too.  I think...
---
Not really a pun, but okay
---
Woah woah woah. The fuck you mean?
---
Dorf female with double ponytails = hair spins = instant bonerismo
---
Dorf male are the essence of male vitality and strength. They are the chode monsters of this world their girths can penetrate and stretch women to full ecstasy.
---
Again with this streamer obsession.
---
They already broadcast their precise location to all members of the opposite faction.  It's called streaming.
---
There is literally no way to prove they're stream sniping. There was no way to prove they're both playing the game and also watching the livestream. PVP happens it's as simple as that.
---
Real talk, I did this shit back in the day too and it's sad that hunters got meme'd but it's just cause there are so many shit hunters, that the good ones are rare to find, after all it's the easiest class to play and one of the hardest to master
---
That's exactly it! Bon chance.
---
OP says:
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt have much time for raiding
---
-------
---
Your answer:
---
&gt;Warrior main tank
---
Think about it for an extra second.
---
Lol, I don't care about random peoples existence too. Neither do you. Like I wouldn't want random people I don't know going out of their way to mess with me because they didn't like the job that I did. If you had a streamer personally go out to fuck with you that's one thing but im willing to be bet most of you guys have at most only been mildly inconvenienced and act like wow has been ruined for you and classic will in the future be ruined for you when it really won't.
---
It‚Äôs literally the best alliance priest race, it‚Äôs not taking a hit.
---
You can re-roll. After a day, after a week, after a month. Make the plans you can with the friends who are also going to play, but wow man, you can reroll.
---
Ven is joining Sonii's guild.  Dewland is making his own, likely on a different server.  Shroud is supposedly going to be the enhance shaman in sonii's raid but I doubt he even makes it to 60 in time for raiding, that guild is going hard.
---
!RemindMe 65 days
---
Yea you gonna need more proof than a random reddit comment :D :D :D Holy shit you guys are dumb....
---
Not arcane
---
That sounds like a you problem
---
Ya it‚Äôs totally different. I agree though it is kinda nice when you‚Äôre on a tight schedule. Levels and gear comes fast and everything is streamlined. I just look at it as a different game tbh. I like retail for what it is but I want vanilla too.
---
I used to use one of those. I have 2 iterations of them after the original broke.
---
Still have them lying around somewhere.
---
2 streamers for EU lol
---
Why does it say 'designed by @mikewurster' ?
---
Yeah man I'm so glad we're safe in EU
---
Here take my upvote, someone gives this man silver as well and then you leave this subreddit.
---
Yes it's perfect to have both options from now on. I will play classic but will probably have a lvl 60 one year from launch lol.
---
How is it seeking attention? If somebody broadcasts their position on a PvP server I would say it's an invitation to gank.
---
I can't remember if it was in Vanilla or introduced in BC but OTs were also used to take stacks of a debuff from the boss to allow the MT to drop theirs before the debuff killed them then they'd swap aggro over.
---
Do you mean arcane? If you are just spamming explosion and barrage sure. But you should be spending much more time casting blasts and missiles on proc. Arcane mage is definitely not what OP should be considering.
---
Druids don‚Äôt have a sunder armor equivalent so I‚Äôm not sure how! 
---
And while they may have threat output being better than warrior, it won‚Äôt stop them from getting squished.
---
Yeah. I really wanna give being a healer as my main a spin this go around.
---
I would like to try and provide some perspective here from someone who played from 4 days after release, until TBC, and logged thousands of hours. 
---
Streamers are only toxic to Classic WoW culture because of the Fan mobs that follow, guard, and aid them in game. I'm sure if a streamer wanted to play on a Blacklist server, the streamer would be able to, just not on his streamer toon, and not while streaming. The streamer would have to play and enjoy the game like every other pixel person in the game.
---
The only feasible other option that Blizzard has to combat the construction and implementation of this addon, is to make streaming on non-streamer servers (otherwise known as "Blacklist" servers), a **bannable** offense. Never perma-ban, but slap on the wrist bans for 2-10 days depending on the number repeat offenses, and a much lighter punishment for the first time offense.
---
If you play and then decide you want to stream, you should get a character transfer to a streamer server, and have a ball!

I would also note, for the sake of clarity in this entire streamer debacle, that IF Blizzard did implement the above "Streamer Servers", that playing on a streamer server would feel almost completely different than playing on a true "Classic" server. You literally have to play retail classic (as intended) to comprehend this part.
---
Since not many people here have ever actually played retail vanilla, the effects of having a streamer on your server drastically the "feel of the game". It changes the entire subculture that exists in the original game, which is definitely unique to any other game, and is core part of what made WoW so much fun.
---
I'm not saying streamer servers would be the worst things ever. I actually think they would be quite cool to see what WoW would have been like if it were released today, with all our technological advances as a race these past 15 years. I will make a toon on one and do a PvP grind! I Bet r14 means a heck of a lot more on Streamer servers due to *insane* competition. This being said, I am a Hardcore fan of retail vanilla and i value the integrity of the game over all things... But i must say, that I WOULD BE OKAY WITH ARENAS BEING IMPLEMENTED ONLY ON STREAMER SERVERS. No unique gear, No honor, No HK Unless vs opposite faction, No xp, No rep. The ONLY thing that would be an okay reward is some arena rank titles). But, even trying to implement these changes could cause unforeseen bugs. That would be the FULL EXTENT of the additions I would want to see to a streamer server (recap: only additions are arena, and arena titles). Anything else would compromise what is left of the 99.8% vanilla integrity that is left on those servers, and heck, blizz might even put a twist on the arenas.
---
But thats just my 2 cents.
---
Something like Ragnaros melts tanks due to very high fire damage which is where resist gear comes in to try and offset those big fire damage chunks.
---
But overall, you can get away with it. But the honest truth is, Druid tanks start to really come into their own, AQ era. That's when the druid gear starts to really become accessible and druid tanks really shine.
---
balance
---
For sure, and I'm going to enjoy every step and every expansion of this new Journey from classic to the very last expansion. I know what I liked in each expansion, I know what I did not like in each expansion, so I no I will be able to play more thoughtfully and with an eye towards not burning out.
---
I hope you are right.

Closest I could find. I remember being miffed that sham became blue. I don‚Äôt remember mages changing color in classic/bc
---
The sac shield means they just cc and leave you alone till the shield is on you. Then you are left with no pet in the middle of nno mans land.
---
You know you‚Äôre attention seeking. Don‚Äôt get weird. Just play the game and kill anyone you see, but specifically targeting 1 person by going out of your way to view their location and get off on chats reaction is cringe. Irony is that players like you always end up to be scrubs too.
---
Thing is even if the warlock knows what hes doing chances are his enemies might have an idea or two about pvp as well.
---
Even though the game shouldn't change #NoChanges
---
A fedora is not a good hat for battle, you are weak you will not survive.
---
What are your goals for the class? 
---
What are you looking to do?
---
We had addons back in vanilla, like I remember using pally power and decursre back in the day as well as unitframes and ui mods. I don't remember 100% where all the quest are but I shouldn't need a quest addon. It's not going ti save enough time.
---
Obsessed.
---
The class quest at lvl 35 gives you a shadow damage offhand. It‚Äôs your bis offhand for a long time till like 50-54 when you get a new one in ungoro
---
Because you either: 
---
A) invest that money (locks and palas have the luxury of having +100 gold investable into enchanting which is THE prof in the long run)
---
B) gathering already for your 1k mount, like why would you learn all the shit curses when COA is all you need for pveing . Obviously you learn some curses for external reasons (like if you duo level with a hunter you duel each other and you put curse of reckless on the hunter so he can mob faster) but having excess money does not mean you gonna blow it on spells when you dont really need thoose to begin with.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info!
---
Oh no I agree with you there. Entirely. Like I say, I dont watch these goons. I'd rather play it myself. My perspective is more targeted at someone keeping up said behavior for hours at a time. Sorry if there was any confusion lol.
---
Why would Blizzard enforce anything upon those who gank streamers that they wouldn't enforce on anyone else?
---
Play on a pvp server, get ganked.
---
I dont get why ppl are worried about less populated servers. I hear there gonna be like 40 servers at launch, for MILLIONS OF PPL. Queues will be huge for months, even years imo
---
Soda said himself he plans to stream snipe any time he's not streaming. Why would it be ok for him but not anyone else?
---
I'm pooping at this very second.  My legs feel fine.  Cushioned toilet seats ftw.  Can't recommend 'em enough.  They help fight that early morning Frost Shock to the buns too.
---
It's silly to be against players playing the game the way they want to. If they would rather grind gold to be carried because thats what they want to do, they should be able to.
---
Atleast yours is from vanilla the other is from TBC
---
Awesome! Could you save it large? I really would like a he version as background on my pc
---
Isnt there gonna only be 2 of watch server? 2RP, 2pvp, 2pve per region?
---
It‚Äôs gonna be pretty hard to avoid any streamer.
---
I think copyright might be an issue
---
Multishot and auto shot has a half second cast just to make sure you can't do it on the move.

Imaginary friends can be real enough if you have a vivid imagination.

It's not really going to effect me as an EU player but still.. nice to have.

Same. Retail gives me those few hours of enjoyment but I‚Äôm itching for that game I could play for 12 hours and not get bored.

One of them yes and the other would have nearly guaranteed a w.
---
Which region are you? Let's play together. I need some vanilla-minded people to play with.
---
female dwarf priests are the best looking priests, dwarf females are the most bad ass race/gender on the Alliance in general, period, regardless of class.
---
Vanilla.  Several fights (drakes in BWL for wing buffets), fankriss (-10% healing received per debuff), and probably others I cant remember.
---
One just have to prioritise one's hobbies. For some, family is more fun than gaming and that's fortunate or the population would die off rather quickly.

does anyone know how the reserving names thing works?
---
 if multiple people want to reserve a name on a particular server, who gets it? i'd also imagine most people still have no idea what server they are rolling on (don't even think server names have been released?)
---
DAE think streamers will ruin Classic WoW??? Even if I just don't roll on their server??
---
True! Really the only streamers semi-big is Ziqo and maybe Pshero, they're gonna be playing on US servers
---
that moonkin should be sitting and drinking instead
---
Then why shoot for this in endgame at all?
---
Classic isn't Retail. The game offers you so much more than just raiding.
---
Cant tell if this guys is trolling or not... but if I were a new player, and some guy in game is telling me to go download stuff from a website... yeah. This has to be dedicated trolling. New players wont even know what add-ons are, and this guy is saying he will intentionally disrupt natural gameplay until these people download something they might not even understand. This is a joke lol. If it's not, then hopefully these edgelords get banned for ruining gameplay experience (ironic... its what they are trying to prevent). This just has to be a troll post.

now that classic is out its thottbot not wowhead noooooo00000000000B
---
I knew there was one that reduced healing received! Haven't played in a good while so my memory isn't the best with all the old raid encounters.
---
on their announcement page for classic, they listed August 13th for everyone being able to log in and save their names, up to 3 i believe.
---
Yea, I will take some pictures and upload them :)
---
Fear ward isn't required.
---
Plus, OP asked for a class to gear quickly. You know which class is one of the most prevalent in every raid? Priests.
---
Surprised that many people made it there then, looks tricky.
---
on their announcement page they listed august 13th as a date where everyone can log in and save up to like 3 names. I'd have to go back and see, but im sure it was 3.
---
Are you serious? Its not even remotely in the same way the same thing. The real world is not world of warcraft. You can NOT in fact just randomly start making billions in real life, everyone is in a different situation and simply can't do shit. 
---
In wow, everyone starts in a starter zone at level 1 and works up and can do everything that other players can do. Every player can mine the same type of ore, every player can craft the same gear, but not everyone can go star in the next marvel movie or go to college or trade school to be able to get good careers and make money. Obviously gold sellers for real cash can alter it a little, but I don't think you realize how little its actually done. 
---
Classic isnt like retail where you can just buy and sell a wow token for gold with real cash, you have to go through sletchy third parties that automatically stop 90% of interested parties from trying it from not wanting to be scammed.
---
And you plan to play MT with limited time...how exactly?
---
Or to play on a PvE server, which they'd never do (thank God).
---

---
Why is this the best?   Nothing beats 600 armor?
---
You're overreacting.   The reason for making the post is because I know the differences between the races, but I was hoping someone would give me reasoning why it's a decent choice.
---
Is this made for WoW:Classic beta only? i can't seem to find a way to make it work on pservers. The addon looks sick would love to use it :)
---
Just because they're remote logging into the PC doesn't mean they aren't account sharing.

Looks life my ex girlfriends snatch.
---
Didn't the beta have a way to preserve a name ahead of time? I'm sure they will do that for launch
---
Now that you brought this to my attention I also noticed how your character is static on anything they ride :/ And it's gonna bother me forever since blizzard most likely wont change it
---
First the patriot act and now this. US people got it tough.
---
the european player base is absolutely deplorable and responsible for the incredible amount of toxicity seen on private servers, the single greatest thing about classic launching is real people will no longer be forced to interact with that sort of filth
---
He compares selling runs for gold to billionares paying politicians, so his credibility has really been ruined haha.
---
His Unknown series introduced me to Aphex Twin, so I am grateful. 
---
Also, his choice of music/editing was unique, really went well together with an undead fire mage.
---
The pace of the battle, ebb and flow. Break beats, high damage.
---
Ah I think I see what you mean.
---
It is a sweet thing to ruin somebody's day to the extent that they give up and log out. Fun to do to random people but much more satisfying if they're "someone" on the server like a R14 or member of a high-end guild. 
---
Even better to be able to watch somebody having a meltdown on camera while you and your buddies camp their corpse and force them to accept res sickness. And then because they're dumb enough to keep broadcasting their location you can track them down and kill them again and again until they log out. 
---
I'm a sick guy and I get off just thinking about it.
---
Nah it's going to get squelched via right click reporting
---
"Chode monsters of this world" you have a way with words my friend
---
I've been following Ven since around mists and he is awesome. Extremely knowledgeable and skilled about mages and the game as a whole. He doesn't have a crazy amount of people watching at any time but it has kicked up since the classic hype train. Really chill and seems like a genuine and nice person.
---
Broadcasting your gameplay on a PvP server is basically saying "I'm putting myself in a vulnerability. Please come and take advantage of it."
---
Don't judge someone for playing the game their way without breaking the rules. Hell, they're not even being an asshole. If I were streaming and someone repeatedly camped me, I wouldn't even get mad.
---
Even PVE servers would make them have problems, but again, thats what happens when you stream.
---
SL?
---
180 organized sadists. If the streamers don't show up to receive the hate I can see this getting out of control.
---
What no preach!? Hes gta be one of the most chilled and skilled wow players around (retail atleast). 
---
Also he and ghosty have amazing chemistry i could watch them banter about for hours
---
&gt; what people do between content patches.
---
I have no idea how DDO works, but I know WoW.
---
Vanilla WoW has LINEAR GEAR DEPENDENT RAID PROGRESSION, with next to zero catch up mechanics. If you want to go BWL, you need MC gear, if you want to go AQ40, you better kill Nefarian, wanna go Naxx, gear up in AQ40.
---
So if you, in between content patches, throw away all you got from the last one, you essentially null everything you did so far, and can go right back to square one, butff or no buff.
---
Or just /who all the players they see on the stream to pinpoint server. It is not that hard
---
It's the same with Scummit and i could name a few others. They could literally kill their mothers and most would still be in their knees waiting to suck them off.
---
Not a CRT monitor? This guy fucks.
---
Really?? Can you provide a link to that statement? Ive been searching for a bit and cant seem to find any info on this
---
Completely and utterly untrue.
---
Many of them took summons.
---
...Redrige Mountains...
---
The rough part is that you'll have to interact with those bozos to get groups or sell/buy things in classic. Unless you can find a really good, self contained guild.
---
I have no idea what you're on about
---
There's a channel solely dedicated to Asmongold's reactions to YouTube videos.
---
In classic, completing low level quests gives no reputation. If you want a nelf mount, you need to go there at level 1.
---
You sound so fucking asshurt over something that hasn‚Äôt happened. I actually hope blizzard bans you and you come here to rant because THAT would be some delicious karma popcorn eating shit right there.
---
It's better if you don't know. You might get scared.
---
It's really not that daunting tbh. You're not going to have 5 different ranks of the same spell. There's a break point where a certain level of down ranking is "the best". 
---
So you'll have "the best", your max rank, and maybe a rank 1 if you're doing shaman shenanigans like explained above. 
---
There's likely going to be a lot of resources out there that will help you find the most optimal set up too.
---
You'll get banned.

I went thru 3 if those N52 pads. I have since moved to a Razer controller. I can play the game without it. Have everything programmed into it. Love it to death. Takes about a week to get use to it. I rarely use the keyboard. Only for for /tells
---
Will you guys announce it here? I gotta make sure I am not on that realm. It sounds really bad how you guys want to enforce an entire server to play the way you want it to. Your not trying to target streamers but the entire server that does not want your addon.
---
I could see this being added in at some point way down the line. This is a feature that makes a lot of sense, and is a source for social interaction and intrigue. Very much in the spirit of classic.

Was it? It looked like vanilla
---
They do not care about ip addresses or hardware. There will be no gm contacting you. There will only be an automated system scanning for irregular behaviour (such as steady exp/h for 24 hours a day). Back in tbc I was hit by a 3 day ban just for getting mailed 10 gold by a friend who moved large quantities of gold on the AH. No gm chat, no early mail. Just caught by an automated system that assumed that I was buying gold.
---
Blizzard has the capability in the client to ban specific addons, they can push a hotfix out an hour after you release the addon and the client will no longer be able to load it.
---
Sure, last time I checked it, it worked off the folder name and TOC of the addon, so it can be bypassed, but you'd be looking at republishing the addon under a different name constantly. That's going to make distribution hard.
---
Mellkor I think it was! UD SP. Goeres name doesn't ring a bell, been a while!

People who RP will just play retail so they have more character options. The RP community in classic will be very small as it is.

Every potential tank should go through his videos, great explanations on how and why druids are amazing tanks
---
This is false. They would have done it with several addons in the past. For instance, Babelfish that allowed cross-faction communication (but only if both players had it). Instead, they made it against the ToS to use. It still works today.
---
Hey this looks interesting, thanks for sharing ! 
---
Question: does it work as a mouse as well ? Feels clunky to love that around .
---
They are pretty legit. Paladins on the other hand...

Can you post a link to when they mentioned there will be transfers? I cant seem to find it anywhere

Shitstorm is overestimating it's only 1% endlessly reeeing about it.
---
blizzard's community managers communicate with big streamers so who knows what happens when they start getting camped and griefed to shite for hours when theres 100k people watching it and hundreds of the streamer's ingame drones start spamreporting the offenders and making shit up in the reports and the 100k viewer streamer himself starts threatening blizzard behind the scenes with switching to other game "if this doesnt get resolved" or something.  
---
just make sure your whole squad records all the action if you plan on going hardcore with this so then any potential future blizzard babysitting streamers and false accusations resulting in temp bans can be instantly exposed by providing footage.  and avoid doing anything thats even remotely against wow tos during it, such as exploits, language (like second account to shittalk, offensive pet/guild names or whatever), and some extreme ingame griefing/harassment based on whatever is specifically declared in the tos, because if you're not 110% clean and get 100+ reports from their sheep, you're most likely gonna get a few hours
---
Sorry I‚Äôm an idiot but how can we tell which servers are west coast or whatever?
---
baddons.wcf, check yourself before you wreck yourself.
---
https://wowdev.wiki/DB/BannedAddOns
---
So instead of this stuf you could just see where they are planning to play and don't roll on that server? This wy you don't have to harras a whole server.
---
&gt; but weapon damage is part of weapon speed still
---
Just nitpicking here, but it's not, it's just that weapon damage is set according to the weapon speed ... aka. slower weapons are deliberately given higher weapon damage.
---
Doesn't change the fact that your point is completely true.
---
This has been in vanilla and is in the game now
---
Best feeling about all of this to be honest
---
AQ40 the battle of the gong. That's the problem.
---
Exactly what I was referring to. In my opinion bfa was released 6-9 months too soon
---
I really really hope that all the people like this and all the streamers all go to one server. Y'all could all camp each other and noone would get what they want. Either that or the most epic world pvp possible.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
How does it feel to become the first?
---
Does the Shadowmeld passive stealth increase affect Cat Form Prowl as well?
---
Very well put.

It's basically all about that oh-so-slippery slope.

I'd just like to add one small part I think you missed which is some fights you are expected to essentially maintank half of the time, because the boss does a stacking debuff. So you and the maintank have to taunt off each other every X stacks.
---
Hell ya  brother.
---
Way back in ff11 I used a special mod to be able to alt tab and that was bannable if anyone ever found out. Man that mod was amazing.
---
Thanks. Really enjoyed this.
---
90% of the problem with the retail LFG-tool is the instant teleportation to dungeon -part. It removes from the feeling of a large expansive and hostile world you have to traverse to get to your destination.
---
That's being said, I'm not a fan of automatic grouping either. It removes important social functions of the game.
---
Who cares?
---
If someone wants to snipe and they are too stupid to even put a 5-15 minute delay timer and get camped nonstop, that is their fault.
---
I think I will miss having a live outside of the game the most.
---
yep
---
This is key for alot of fights.. especially starting in bwl.. you will have multiple tanks on one boss rotating who is top threat while a debuff falls off of the previous tank.. or like.. taking turns taunting the boss between tanks. This continues into AQ where there are sometimes multiple mobs per boss fight...  like Bug Family or Twin Empa. Multiple tanks taking care of multiple priority targets as dps methodically dispatches them one by one.
---
Technically the post I replied to was correct, IIRC: you said IB 2-3 weren't available at 20, but the first rank is enough to at least get started pulling 3-4 green con mobs IIRC.
---
i like this meme
---
We want to pick a realm and all make our characters on August 12th.
---
Many streamers have pledged their intention not to reveal their servers until launch on August 26th.
---
I did the same, just as a gnome entering Orgrimmar.
---
Streamers are all twinked out so when the game comes around it wont be like this.
---
&gt;And I really enjoy the fast pace and instant gratification in retail
---
Nothing wrong with that.
---
while its true that you dont need to spec into holy its advised to have a seperate set of gear consisting of some uncommon drops, quests rewards you kept instead of seling etc.
---
There are addons for it though.
---
Please add a category "region" to this. The world is bigger than just the US.
---
You'll be more than able to kill the opposite faction in PvP, and the really nice thing is that you won't form some kind of mental dependency on catching Frostbite procs (plus, when/if you ever do respec into it you'll be that much better at mage from having to go through your rotations deterministically).
---
I would suggest watching all boss fights and studying their strategies! You will get a much better idea! But as mentioned.. keeping 2nd on threat.. trading taunts with mt to let debuffs fall off, tackling the mob you are assigned in multi trash pulls, standing between boss and casters to taunt incase someone loses threat... 
---
There are tons of duties for an off tank. Yes its way less involved (as in time required out of raid to prep compared to MT), but..  still vastly important. And fun!
---
It's amazing. Literally guilds dedicated to rp as guards of stormwind, or rp as mercs for hire or race specific guilds. It's more immersive to have proper pvp in rp
---
exactly right!
---
You sound really triggered by streamers.
---
Hasn't been used since December 2009.
---
This site is exactly something I've been hoping for, THANK YOU.
---
If they don't want to download the addon, they're welcome to play on another server. With the streamers.
---
Same here.  I played the hell out of Warcraft 3 and really missed out on Wow because I thought the subscription was lame.  At least with Classic I can have a "fresh start"
---
Actively coordinating a campaign to disrupt the play of others has tho, which is what you are doing with this addon idea.
---
Good luck, I hope they delete your and everyone who downloads your addons accounts - myself if I end up on your server by some horrible mistake I'll spend 5 minutes making an add-on that tells your add-on that I have the price of garbage installed when I don't.
---
I hope all the most popular streamers all chose to roll on your exact server to crush you - you think your group of 120 raiders has any chance against hundreds of thousands of players following the top 5 guys? You won't even be able to log in the first week to play to clear MC let alone make your autistic declaration.
---
I'll keep my eyes open then and shoot it first.
---
The toolbar on top Kreygasm
---
feral is your best bet. This is the most versatile spec in raid, with the same spec, you can tank, be a decent dps (and the dps rotation is one of the most complex and fun in vanilla with power shifting), you can decurse and dispell, you can still heal if needed.
---
Be careful about the big downside, having to carry alot of gear in your bag. For example on me i have my tank set, some threat items, my dps set, my fire resist set, my nature resist set. And my healset in my bank just in case. Will also have to do a frost resist set soon.
---
No, you are the cancer.
---
Wrong.
---
I'm sorry my experiences don't line up with what you want reality to be.
---
I mean, that's how it has been since Classic was announced outside of a few Blizz updates. Much better imo than getting into drama that should have been posted on r/livestreamfail
---
Found the soda sub. 
---
Do you even read what you type? If im mad, you must be enraged
---
np gotta share some good stuff when I find it
---
skill + racials &gt; skill
---
just saying
---
I'm going to play the devils advocate here. I have played about 4-5 of the highest populated vanilla private servers for the past 7 years and in those 7 years I have only seen 1-2 organized weekly goldbid pugs, (out of hundreds of organized regular MC/BWL pugs) I even attended a few of them and it wasnt that bad. All gold spent in the entire run was split among all the players (even the ones who had bought items).
---
goldbid pugs gets more flak that it actually deserves.
---
is there anyone that raids as an elem shaman?
---
Well the fact you are not playing now youbare tipping the balance to the left waiting for the wow to come along on the right
---
Mounting in Booty Bay and other places (zeppelins, zeppelin towers, boats, etc.) was not allowed in vanilla WoW, but is in the beta.
---
Mounting in these places was not added until patch 3.0.2 (the WotLK patch) as unofficial changes, which can be seen [here.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.0.1_(undocumented_changes\))
---
A necessity for instructor
---
I think the consensus about Shaman is that they will be healbots in raids.
---
Wait you were serious? Holy shit.. you need help man
---
Because it hasn't needed to be used. It's still very much in the client. 
---
Addons in the past decade have focused on gaining a gameplay advantage through the API.
---
You're looking at using the API for automated and systematic harassment, using common API functions. They won't be able to change the API to avoid that, so they'll just ban the addon instead.
---
I always wanted a speedpad but I've felt the layout is just ever so slightly wrong for my hand. I could be wrong since I've never held them but I would feel so much better if the palm was positioned so that the A in WASD is at the edge of the pad same as it is on a keyboard, 4 deep and 6 wide would be ideal for me too instead of 3 deep five wide.
---
Only way to be defense capped as druid is if every single item you have have the defense suffix. It's not worth it at all since you gimp every other single stat.
---
I'm not so sure about that.
---
For as much as we love the classic Devs, they're not going to be the ones moderating the game. The ban process will almost certainly be automated like it is on live and if enough people report, you will probably get banned. Now they'll lift the ban, but it won't get you back the 2-3 days it takes them to resolve the issue.
---
Hi not so sure about that.

# *Update:

After a Friday night of painting I've completed this miniature. 
---
I've not spent super long time on him since I want to paint more from this classic board game before the launch of classic.

---
You don't but OP is looking for a class that is sought after. Fear ward is sought after on alliance side
---
What I don't get is why you and your 180 sect members don't stay on pserver instead of doing this and be the dictators of a retail classic server ... That is much simpler and is what you've done for years so far.
---
It's the high warlord sword from pvp ofc
---
No, it hasn't been used since 2009 because it's incredibly easy to bypass.
---
If i could give you gold i would.
---
Call the addon Streamer Tax
---
Rp is not enforced anymore
---
Pripyat
---
You have two options :
---
Heart of the wild spec : 0/30/21  Allow you to tank and heal
---
Hybrid dps tank spec : something like 11/35/5  Allow you to tank and dps  (I use this in raid to be able to switch between dps and tank when needed).
---
Because we'd rather play on real servers, obviously. All the decent pservers are being shut down anyway, and the ones that aren't will die from a lack of players.
---
Thanks, that read was hilarious
---
Thank you. It was very fun to watch live.
---
Idk how this wasn't apparent from the get-go, people on reddit/twitch are losing their shit over nothing... But I guess that's par for the course so...
---
Here is an link to completed project [https://imgur.com/q9L4OIT](https://imgur.com/q9L4OIT)
---
Don't they force you to make an account to use the thottbot themed version?
---
Both very valid arguments!
---
You might remember seeing it on a CRT.
---
Modern flat panels usually have a gamma of 2.2 (or at least they should, most are uncalibrated, so they are frequently even brighter in the midcolors).
---
CRTs usually have a gamma of 2.4 or 2.5. Which means that everything looks darker (except pure white).
---
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction)
---
We thought about calling it SodapoppinSays.
---
I was planning to be a dwarf priestess before I even knew they had a unique and great racial. Because they're badass, and helicopter healer hair is the best.
---
That was Ragnaros' goal!
---
You just aoe grind on the elementals in northwest silithus. They give the rep
---
You are right of course. They do the mathematics and statistics and then they come up with the best outcome and market that. That's why wow classic should be on mobile. Don't you guys have phones?
---
Yeah good luck timing that lol,  40 people nuking an add, or aoe packs, farming shards meant dropping on the meters, we were very competitive back then even on trash haha.
---
It is, but you have to get your entire userbase to do so.
---
People aren't going to run a random exe from some fuckwit that modifies the TOC on every start-up, and existing distribution methods like Curse, are incredibly slow to publish updates to all users.
---
Not to mention, Blizzard can just ask Curse to get rid of the addon, Curse won't want to play around with Blizzard.
---
Elementals in northwest silithus give the rep and they can be aoe farmed
---
"but the problem is that raids usually only bring exactly as many healers as they need. Which means for you to tank, the raid would be down a healer, so you can never tank"
---
Except you don't need the same amount of healer on every fight. In the same raid for example you can do some boss with less than 8 heals but then later you get some boss where you need 10 or more.
---
Example in AQ, a hotw druid could offtank on skeram, sartura, some trash pack, ouro, and heal on viscidius twins and c'thun.
---
Hey dude: #nochanges... fucking retail sellout
---
So this was a post about retail but with the word "Classic" in the title.  
---
Cool.
---
Will Blizzard allow people to take their names? I couldn't imagine someone like Asmongold or Swifty not being able to have the names they came up with originally.
---
Shadowmeld stacks with stealth increasing the invisibility but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs only when stood still but someone can confirm I‚Äôm sure
---
You can still do reckbombs it just take longer to load up with normal crits
---
Funny thing is that this is actually true not just some ranting. When people cultivate they start acting sort of like being part of a hive mind. Their own personality disappears temporarily. Anyways there is nothing wrong watching streamers, just use don't forget to "use your own brains" :)
---
Only if you have world buffs.
---
It's fine, just go on the blizzard store and pay for a character...trans...fer...
---
...
---
Ogodno
---
Warriors have 2 jobs in pvp. Hamstring-&gt; Mortal Strike. Just because you can cherry pick KB‚Äôs in fury doesn‚Äôt mean your useful.
---
You can give Discord permissions to make changes to a directory. One Discord bot that announces whenever Blizzard pushes the addon's new name to it's ban list. Which again, they won't do.
---
Defense isn't that good on druid, if you get some on gear it's good but it's not a stat you will specifically look for.
---
If you wonder about what gear you should look for, look at this sheet :

---
Why the fuck would you play without addons?  Where does this idea even come from?
---
In real vanilla we had tonnes of addons.  You could argue an authentic vanilla experience is one with fucking cosmos installed with recursive basically playing the game for you.
---
He was one of the few SP's and a good friend of mine in Vanilla, Good guy.
---
I'm sure your server will be really popular. Like DDR for autistic elitist neckbeards. Dammit, can't wait.
---
I &lt;3 you. This has pissed me off for 10 years also. I've gon on rants about various horse related issues from Tyreals charger to the hilariously bad model deformation on the Lucid Nightmare. The warforged charger I've refused to rant to my mates about because id be there for days.
---
For the love of god Blizz, ALL animations need to damn well be the Vanilla ones.
---
Everyone loved flying mounts in TBC too, only to later realise it was detrimental to the core gameplay that constitutes an MMO.
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions as they say.
---
Beautiful, a true Horde landmark

[Stream snipers and streamer fans accusing each other of being pathetic.](https://imgur.com/zZrMH0t)
---
It's not just "Bring the player not the class." IT goes further than that. It's the community. IT's always been a shit community in terms of what's viable or useful.
---
Hell, it STILL is. Any time anything is slightly worse than another it may as well be the difference between a shack and a skyscraper.
---
Bring the player not the class came about because for 3+ expansions it was all about  what was THE best, and anything shortof that was a joke spec. By Wrath things were really bad. Between gearscore and spec bias people were denying runs to other players for any reason at all. Frost mage? PFT, keep it pvp scrub. That's the sort of attitude that existed, and it wasn't even true for most players.
---
Even here in Classic players keep shooting down feral and ret as useless, paladins and boomkin as non-existant. Fact is they are subpar. But reality is that it doesn't really matter. Coordination and skill makes up for so much more than spec viability for 90% of he player base.
---
People don't care though, so Blizzard has to force it so players would stop caring and that means homogenizing, balancing, taking out the crazy silly wacky things that were simply broken. Things are far better, though still clearly not a perfct balance, but it came at a big cost.
---
In an era of MDI and multiple world first races airing on twitch to thousands of viewers there's no room for inefficient or broken abilities. It sucks but I honestly blame the playerbase, they make and break an mmo so I can't blame blizz for tailoring the game to the greatest number of players but it sucks to think about what we've lost.
---
Draenei.

Asmongold &lt;3

 !RemindMe 63 days
---
Don't remember.  Just remembered there was a 1.0 atk speed cat in the Barrens on launch
---
Sooooo clearcasting only affect damaging spells....
---
with the snowflake 2019 community I‚Äôm sure that will be bannable in classic
---
Are there any big EU streamers to avoid?
---
 Funny thing is that this is actually true not just some ranting. When  people cultivate they start acting sort of like being part of a hive  mind. Their own personality disappears temporarily. Anyways there is  nothing wrong watching streamers, just don't forget to "use your own  brains" :)
---
Ye, but I still prefer to do it at 26 when i have CoC and blizz at 3/3.
---
As long as it doesn't have streamers...
---
Bro, I am going to use your website to hunt and gank streamers. 
---
Thanks dawg.
---
Pretty cool, nice work.
---
That is something you tell yourself at the night to feel good? 
---
There are people out there who played vanilla wow on blizzlike pServers for the past 10 years. This Content is optimizid to it`s core by player
---
I wanted that staff of the ruins pretty badly, but TBC dropped earlier :)
---
!remindme 60 days
---
yet another post-vanilla animation to add to the list. please report it over on the [buglist sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=0) for greater visibility.
---
It is. The textures are of a lower quality and there are less of them. The spell effects are a lot more simple than their BfA counterparts and the combat is slower so it's less to process.
---
I can't even run BfA on the lowest settings on my laptop, Classic runs smoothly at 60 FPS on its lowest settings.
---
There's definitely some irony here.
---
So now you want 15-25%+ of the playerbase of a server to let your Discord bot fuck around with their WoW install?
---
Your years on private servers have truly warped your perception of what people are willing to do.
---
Dwarves are sick dude. Stoneform is seriously underrated for pvp and pve. No diseases, bleeds,or poisons ever.
---
Ok but it‚Äôs just objectively not as good as stoneform.
---
Feels good knowing I'm going to be on an organic server, no streamers from that region are big enough to even make a difference
---
Boss that hit really hard and require you to have def cap (like maexxna, which is even worse because you have to survive a few seconds with only hot a few times)
---
Boss that have an enrage phase (maexxna again, huhuran, chrommagus) are generally not a good idea because unlike warrior you don't have shield wall to help survive this.
---
Nefarian because he will randomly change you into cat form.
---
Viscidius because druid threat is totally dependant of the damage you do unlike warrior and half damage on him = half threat. (It's also why druid are even better on thaddius, because your threat scale better than warrior with the damage buffs).
---
Note that all these fight are still doable for a druid (bar maybe maexxna ?) but it's really not a good idea. The only thing you really can't tank is actually a trash mob : the abom during the kt fight because they can one shoot you since you can't get def cap.
---
On every other boss, druid is good and sometimes even better than a warrior.
---
[Containment servers](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Containment%20Board)
---
They'll still just zerg to boss.
---
Yeah, but you never hear someone say someone is on a spectrum when they're re socially adept, do you?
---
Of course. RP can happen randomly. But the general rule we agreed on was "Are the people you're about to gank obviously RPing? If yes, don't do it". Or at the very least, fight them once then bigger off, win or lose. Don't harass them for hours.
---
He was talking about how long they would use layering, not how long time phase 1 would last.
---
Female Dwarf has the best Cast Animation, period!
---
Mods are slow and dumb :(
---
It‚Äôs pretty cool to have a useful racial, and pretty busted to have a shitty one.
---
Also I‚Äôm pretty sure the drain soul required the killing blow or you wouldn‚Äôt get a stone. Locks had to macro  in drain soul with the pet backing off due to this so add 35-40 other potential entities doing that is dam near impossible
---
Oh wow that's dope actually.
---
This is classic, we don't talk about politics here. You're limited to Chuck Norris, murlocs and unbalanced PvP.
---
nope. 45 silver is what they sold for on retail vanilla
---
I only take long poops at work.
---
ZG world buff also grant +15% movement speed and there is also a potion you can get with zandalar tribe that increase your move speed (idk if all of this stack tho).
---
For movement speed enchant, i think it work in cat/bear but not in travel form. I don't think it stack with the cat +30% talent too.
---
Dwarves are the best looking race and pretty much the only reason somebody should even consider going Alliance. There is literally nothing wrong with their appearance, OP should lower his intake of soy.
---
Played a warrior back in Vanilla, leaning hunter this time because I understand how gear dependent they are and the shear amount of people who intend to play warrior.
---
Guilty as charged. Although I love Vanilla (TBC is my best overall), I just cant ignore that there are some things in retail that I really like. 
---
The new graphics engine for starters. 
---
How guilds work with gbank, guild repairs and the perks. Racial balance. The artifact power talent leveling is something that could be brainstormed about for future post vanilla spinoffs. Transmog.
---
Also for raiding in Vanilla you need to farm your ass off for consumables if you want to raid in the top 5%. I would like that time to be somehow reduces by either boost the drop rate of the materials or lower the requirements of the same.
---
I'm not a retail player, I just payed sub on retail to check it out because classic hype. I actually havent logged properly since WOTLK and played about 1 month of Cata.
---
it's not the correct price. they sold for 45 silver on retail. trust me dude on beta it also says it requires 5000 lockpicking. super bugged
---
This was my third or fourth time reading this guide, love it every time. Will definitely be playing Druid in Classic. Can‚Äôt wait!
---
Very nice, thanks!
---
I'm running the beta on a 9700K and 2080ti on Ultra @ 1440p and still get some pretty awful frame drops at various points.
---
Oh yeah, that'd work.
---
Yeah, everything in moderation, even rat poison! Got to get that 10mg dose in.
---
Doesn't matter what they sell for on Retail. It only matters what they sold for on Classic and the only non-Pserver database says you're wrong.
---
if its pvp, for pve roll alliance
---
Great research and very on-point! The new animation looks incredibly cartoony and not realistic. The pre 3.0 looks just about right, and looking at it, it made me realize  it just now! That said, I never had a horse mount before patch 3.0 anyway, but still this is good work.
---
Hopefully Blizzard notices this (and also sends you an invite!).
---
Cat is only good for stealthing, opening and using shred if they are noob enough to show you your back while trying to run away or something.
---
I would find it incredibly ugly to allow them to have their names. Another favour just for them? Fuck that...
---
on the contrary, it brought in more players. Every expansion has had a huge wave of support. BUT those gamers a transient. They come and go. But that's the nature of MMOs today, there's a reason there's not many of them any more and instead we're getting loot shooters. More casual and accessible and simpler to play. You add up the population across the big MMOS and I'm certain that combined they barely top WoW's own peak of 12 Million active subs from 9 years ago. MMOs as a genre in general just aren't popular, for the health of the game it's either accept becoming small a niche (which is awful for an MMO) they had to make it accesible and balanced and equal (which is awful for an RPG)
---
!RemindMe 70 Days
---
I plan on multi boxing to have 500 g by 60
---
It countered crippling poison so hard on my dwarf hunter I hardly ever lost against a rogue.
---
Does it really make any noticeable difference?
---
Cthun would fit better imo
---
I never heard of 90% of these people.
---
There are no keys for blizzard betas.  Wouldn‚Äôt someone in contact with devs know this?
---
Not as much as going from an HDD to SSD, but it is faster.
---
Not really tho. Those are their names. The original names they came up with years and years ago. I dont know why they wouldn't.
---
The bfa release was pretty sick. On silvermoon eu i was able to play straight away with serverlag that only lasted about 1-2 hours before it felt normal.
---
The speculation that layering in classic is a test before it goes to retail has me thinking that serverwise release is going yo be pretty good.
---
Good luck in the zerg tho.
---
I almost recommended you to take a free helicopter ride, but then I saw your name. Pretty good bait, almost got me.
---
Don`t know about that, but Nightfall feelt soooo goood
---
South Park should do another WoW episode to coincide with the release of classic.
---
 Adding more complexity would be a disaster. After 15 years, Alliance still caps snowfall gy then wonders why horde turtles at Drek.
---
in PVP you can go burst damage and not get sanc.... in PVE sanc is essential to sustain DPS. Also to get that burst you need pretty high level gear. Unless you only want burst, better to boost your output with sanc.
---
You REALLY need potions though so alchemy is darn handy
---
I did find it funny when listening to a guy explain how immersive vanilla quests could be because u had to think for yourself while in the same video advising questie as a must have so you can quest easily.
---
And who decides who goes on the list? That person will literally be the dictator of the server with the power to ruin anyone's game. 
---
I don't think blizz would allow this shit and I think most people on the server would ignore you and your add-on anyway.
---
I always chose my server in the RP/RP PVP side. There is less people but when you're a silent like myself, I don't trouble anyone RPing around. And thus avoid events revolving around community outside the game like that.
---
If someone looked up his personal information from his name that was on stream, that \*is\* doxxing.
---
Exactly.
---
I will miss modern models. Thats really it, the rest I can deal but I'm not happy to go back to hairlip sam and the gang.
---
You mainly only use cat for steatlh, opening on someone (pounce for a little stun, ravage for damage), and dash if you need to sprint.  Sometimes if you are on a clothie it can be good to stay on cat form to shred him if you manage to stay behind him but that's about it.
---
You will more often be in bear/human form/travel form if you don't count the stealth time.
---
Except for levelling, you will stay alot in cat form until you are 60.
---
Griefing can get you banned. An example of that being intentionally ganking someone for long periods of time. A few times then letting the person carry on with his/her business is fine, but a GM will actually ask you to stop if it is too excessive. I know this because a friend of mine liked to camp people for 30+ mins. A GM one day msg'd him and told him if he doesn't stop griefing players that a ban can occur.
---
That being said, you are a piece of shit if you are gonna be stream sniping and I hope it does get you banned if you plan on doing this.
---
Retards from classicwow judging people on looks. Juicy juicy stuff.
---
He is
---
Same for us, and yet we'll have to fight with everyone else for those names...
---
Nixxiom is EU? Nice, seen a couple of his vids, he seems cool and knowledgeable
---
No way a new 60 will have that much on a new server.
---
Nah it doesn't no idea what the newer versions are like though. Also the macro capabilities are pretty endless with each individual key which is pretty handy for spamming abilities as soon as they go off CD.
---
What did you hear. WHAT DID YOU HEAR
---
I'm quite sure it was mentioned somewhere. I didn't look through all statements by blizzard but that realm transfers will exist in classic [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=549). (Watch until 10:25. Omar confirms that it's part of the game they want to preserve.)
---
Giving out free transfers is the only thing they can do if people have to wait for hours to play and start complaining once layering is gone. That there will be queues is mentioned [here](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=511).
---
Says the retarded salty mad boy triggered by streamers
---
Oh so intellect doesn't improve healing power in classic? Only amount of mana?
---
I'm talking about retail classic. Also I found a vid on youtube from 2006 showing a rogue selling them for 45 silver
---
trololol
---
I struggle to reach the lower row actually as I have quite big hands, width wise no issues whatsoever. super comfortable too, if I play games on a standard keyboard for too long my wrist gets pretty sore but never on this.
---
Did you read the post? Additions to the list must happen by unanimous consensus from people across both factions and multiple guilds with complete transparency on every decision and history on the realm discord.
---
Lol i killed 1000s of those gnolls. Grinding for days. It was a nice and quiet zone (mostly)
---
Then link it.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Uhm you do know 1 month or so before classic Blizzard is opening the name reservations for EVERYONE right ?
---
Wait whaaat? Isnt it built around BfA client?
---
I have a google doc with around 50 videos of rogues pick pocketing but I'll try to find it
---
Maybe a few weird people that like to raid with weird spec, and also probably some hardcore pvper (since ele is the best pvp spec) but they will also probably still heal.
---
positive it was from 2006 tho cause the quality was shit
---
Great addition, and also great stance on the subject. It's not about hating or not, it's just about having the experience you want, and that helps a lot for people in US, so thanks for them!
---
Can someone make a website to track where redditors play, so i can avoid majority of you guys?
---
It was built around the Legion client but some of the values have been upgraded to suggest it's running on some Frankenstein version of 8.x. However, this is mostly just speculation and it must not be 8.1 because it definitely does not support DX12 and multi-threading or multiple core optimization.
---
It's a blessing mate. Thank god for being EU.
---
Yeaaaah.. he's definitely not the face of WoW.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
There are several tests on the 5% spirit out there. It is literally a dead talent. Absolutley useless. Look it up. Also, plenty of PvE fights see fearward use. You're simply misinformed.
---
So how massive are those FPS drops that you have?
---
Rogues are not slow levelers.
---
Personally I am doing 2 accounts, one priest and the other I am doing a 60 rogue and a bunch of 35 warlocks.
---
All classes are vastly different. I'd suggest leveling a few to 30 or so to see exactly what you would like.
---
Exactly! I was torn between priest and warlock, finally decided firmly on warlock, and now I'm totally unsure again.
---
Are you respecing at 19 and going straight for improved shred? Do you front shred at all? I'm curious if front shredding starting at level 25 and grinding in between questing maybe would be faster.
---
You need to read a lot more
---
mage, unless you count piddly shit like serpent sting.
---
Glad to be of some help. I'm sorry if I sounded negative. But I tried making a feral druid work myself. It aint pretty.
---
&gt; You hear a
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
streamers killed my family
---
Playing a game for a full time job doesnt entitle you to free shit.  That's the point hes making.  
---
Let me reiterate that.
---
Streamers get paid. To play. A game.  Not even well by most standards.
---
On top of that they'll have sycophants giving them free items and gold all the time.  
---
They'll have sycophants ready to summon them to any dungeon.  They'll most likely never have ANY wait time on finding groups for dungeons or raids.
---
Streamers didnt really exist back in vanilla.  The whole thing is going to completely fuck over the experience of classic.  So much so that as I've watched the sub grow, I get less and less excited for classic every day because I dread what happens if I roll on a streamer server.
---
I'm usually floating around 100 FPS out in the world and in dungeons, except when switching between some zones. But inside a city or just randomly, it'll drop to ~60. And in some of the crazier world PVP fights, i saw it hit 30s.

---
Holy shit it looks horrible!
---
One more reason to go for a sabre mount I guess.
---
Even if it doesn't you can manually make macros at the start of the raid for each class, but Im sure someone will make similar addon anyway
---
You'll get banned from not sniping
---
Not exactly tho. For streamers it's harder to play around using their own names because retards steal the names just to be dicks or to try and impersonate. If you for instance have a completely original name, I'm sure it will be available. Something like boomstick cannot be expected to be free as it is not really original. However a name like Asmongold is completely original and was made when WoW first came out. I am confident that my name WizzlePizz wont be taken because there is literally 1 other person who has that name but I'm still gonna try to reserve it. 
---
These names like asmongold and bellular are completely original and have an identity to them as a streamer. I feel like Blizzard needs to allow them to keep it.
---
Streamer Man Bad! &gt;:(
---
I‚Äôm in same dilemma though I think I‚Äôd rather play paladin but leveling is such a big thing in classic I think I‚Äôm gonna role a priest.
---
someone needs to bring back wowdetox
---
Right! I just want an organic experience.
---
What a huge fucking entitlement. Saying it now, you are getting banned. There is no way blizzard would let you enforce any kind of rules in their own servers.
---
Yeah, but in reality it will be one or a couple of guys like you actually typing the names in. That means a major elitist like you will have power over the entire server. 
---
I'd rather play with all the streamers in the world than being forced to download your totalitarian app.
---
Yeah I now get how the speed on mcp basically doubles all your procs. I'd suspect that tf would beat thc on humans though?
---
You have to see it form their perspective, they will clear MC in less than 3 hours per week. With a 60 in 1 week and little else to do because honor isn't enabled they might as well go after streamers.  
---
People have been asking for a server with no streamers on it, this is the community solution.
---
Just curious is this against TOS? Griefing your own faction? Or am I misunderstanding?
---
It's like none of you idiots read the last sentence
---
People fear that streamers will ruin their classic experience. While streamers and some other lucky persons got beta access while others did not just added  fuel to the flames. Basically it is about fear of missing out (FOMO), envy (no beta access), fear of the unknown ( believing that streamers could ruin classic wow) and creating a threat simply because modern humans don't really have any so we create them. Also complaining about something creates unity and social connection between people is a huge factor.
---
Sorry for bad english but there is some of the basic psychological factors behind this phenomenom...in case someone is curious...
---
&gt; I know I'm right
---
uh, ok
---
Well done drybrushing those horns and beak!
---
Ooh, I'm really curious about that one!
---
Which pserver guilds are involved?
---
Thank you :)
---
compared to the other two. the rogue is slower
---
The unarmored Mounts are missing too.
---
Please someone make the Blacklisted guild so people organize and gather to gear up and stream snipe them.
---
What never been seen, shall never been unseen again.
---
Too complicated ü§§
---
Same, I don't see why wanting to be flexible should be punished. What exactly do ramping up respec costs add in terms of engaging gameplay?
---
Thanks for tracking that down for me, i was getting worried on how they will dal with streamer servers and if the pop is too high to login without huge queues lol. But now im feeling pretty confident they will offer transfers off of those servers when the queue is several hours long and people wanna play. Cause they mentioned their goal is to have healthy realm pops when layering is gone
---
As long as you are selling carries for in-game currency you are not in breach of the ToS. And why does it matter what other people spend their gold on. Unless you are the one that needs the carry and doesn't wanna pay for it . I don't do sales, I don't buy sales, I don't give a shit if someone wants to buy or sell any service as long as it is not RMT.
---
Was a Rogue in Vanilla 2004- Rogue are not slow leveling :)
---
Sounds like a great way to lose all your gold, credit cards and nude archive.
---
Lol you are one delusional pathethic troll arent you? You could've easily won this argument by showing that you are indeed in the beta, which would've be easy for you if you weren't lying ofc. Easy for you to say stuff and act big but you are fast to hide if asked to produce a proof, even if it would take you mare seconds to do so. I feel sad for you and the delusional world you live in
---
eh? I've literally never seen a farming bot in wow.
---
Flair this as PSA
---
&gt; Yeah, but in reality it will be one or a couple of guys actually typing the names in. That means a major elitist scumbag like you will have power over the entire server.
---
No, this won't happen. When one of the moderators wants to add a name to the list, at least another two, one from each faction, must go to Discord and verify the report. Only then will they receive the confirmation code that allows them to verify the addition. 
---
The elected moderators will also rotate both within guilds and between elected guilds, so no group of people will ever hold moderator power through the entire lifetime of the server.
---
Each report can be viewed on the Discord and disputed. The entire Blacklist and its history can be viewed both in-game and on Discord.
---
Finally, I'm not one of the elected moderators and probably never will be.
---
&gt; I'd rather play with all the streamers in the world than being forced to download your totalitarian app.
---
And you're welcome to do so. Just not on our server.
---
You are trying way too hard my friend lol
---
mage is not gear dependent like the other 2
---
None of the actions we'll be taking are bannable offenses. Nor has any addon ever resulted in a ban.
---
Step 1 : Take no other warrior in your guild, replace dps warriors spots by rogues and off-tank spots by feral druids.
---
Step 2 : ...
---
Step 3 : profit \\o/
---
Reading is hard.
---
Dorfs
---
You might look into a hunter shot timer addon. By seeing the timer on how your shots are firing, you can run between the shots to add distance or close distance while not losing DPS.
---
It's also probably smart to level cooking/fishing for your pet, assuming you get the type of pet that can benefit from that. Cooked food is higher level, meaning you can use it to better satiate your pets appetite as it gets higher level.
---
Do you really think everyone who starts playing because of a streamer will just stop when the streamer stops? I‚Äôve never had that kind of loyalty to a streamer but I genuinely think people (most of them) would still stick around.
---
"Y'know having the barber shop would be kinda neat-" "I BET YOU WANT LFR AND WORLD QUESTS TOO!" "...no?" "HASHTAG NO CHANGES" "Yet you're playing with maxed out modern graphics settings and loaded up on modern add-ons, hmmm..."
---
It's not really clear by the way I wrote it, but I meant that they are slower when compared to the other 2. Not by an enormous amount (like warriors for example) ofc.
---
So... where can I sign up?
---
Why would they need to hit 60 faster than 4 days 20 hours? Please enlighten me. You can enter MC from 58 which you can take all the way until ~4-5 hours before reset to actually complete.
---
If you want to MT raids you better find a guild like yesterday.
---
At the moment Reck bombs work just fine, its just not super reliable so mostlikely using /sit in any form in combat is not viable.
---
And all that just so you can grief streamers. Well good luck with not getting banned. I'll be on EU anyway so I'll stay well away from this madness.
---
The ‚Äûnormal‚Äú mage rotation is basically 1 spell (Frostbolt / or 2: Scourge &amp; Fireball).
---
That‚Äòs not so appealing to me
---
alliance outnumbered horde 3-1 in classic wow. and on private servers its about 60/40 ally to horde ratio so not sure where you get that idea.
---
Not all of the participating guilds wish to have their Pserver exploits and WoW Classic future forever linked, so I won't be sharing the names. But since posting this (and some other things on various other forums) we've also received interest from several other guilds wishing to join the coalition and they'll be invited to the next meeting.
---
This first meeting was really just to discuss a temporary truce between both factions so we can level as quickly as possible for week-one Ragnaros kills. The addon was something that had been proposed before, but we didn't have enough support from both factions for it. Sodapoppin's message to all would-be gankers really united everyone behind the idea.
---
For uBlock check that you're choosing uBlock Orgin by Raymond Hill, the other ones are not so good and may let some ads pass.
---
Please note that the best browser to really stop ads is Firefox, all the Chrome derivatives have some code to hinder ublock (you don't see the ads but they still manage to gather data about you).

*Laughs in Night Elf Priest*

Enjoy being a first in the history of wow, your neckbeard comrades will remember you in their death beds.
---
None of the actions we'll be taking are bannable offenses. Nor has any addon ever resulted in a player being banned.
---
PUNISH THE UNBELIEVERS OF THE UNBELIEVERS!
---
I guess I tend to agree. But just imagine there's someone out there whose name is also Asmongold, just for the sake of the argument. Then the streamer gets it cause he can and the other can fuck himself? Of course it's quite unlikely but the idea isn't very fun. Still, I agree with you. But in my case, when I come on a server I often have to cycle through my favourite names until one isn't taken. They're not even that obvious, but when you get thousands of people, there's gotta be a limited choice of things you can come up with. But yeah, as you say I won't have people coming for my name intentionally. I'm literally debating this out loud, but honestly you're probably right.
---
Huh, the font is different
---
Well, Key = Access for me, for a lot of people it is. People just tend to call it "Keys"
---
Oh we plan on having plenty of world firsts, but what you're suggesting won't be one of them.
---
is there something that filters the chat? its just another world for me, a world that hurts and confuses my old self. an addon that hides the "pog" or some other words or emojis that have no meaning for me that get spammed every milisecond and make it impossible to read something.
---
&gt; heal on bosses. 
---
oO
---
I wish I had your optimism. After seeing the stupidity on the internet though... I just don't.
---
Yup that's the one! I guess the data I don't mind too much. They gather all they want, I don't buy shit without need, never did and never will so it's really just about not having this on my screen!
---
What is the name of the robe the left Mage dawg is wearing?
---
Nope.
---
Okay?
---
From what we have seen of there privilege's so far im pretty certain of that, also do you think they will have fast track if there are queues?
---
Fantastic thanks you!
---
Cause Preach is in retail and invites scrubs all the time, he isnt a gatekeeper basically

nightfall doesnt proc in raids, your drain life abd corruption arent allowed to take a debuff slot
---
What on earth makes you think I'm interested in a fair fight? I'm rolling rogue...
---
Except they are right, you had no way to know back then that the mount would be unique, so none felt the need to rush for it. In addition, 90% of the people who had this mount traded it for the armored one so in fact they weren't that cool right? What made them cool is that they became unobtainable, or only smart people kept it.
---
Tbh only those with the achievement old school mount should have one :-)
---
Within the Alternate player, you do have a chat restriction option, you gotta look into it but you can have banned words, so you could ban "Pog", and it appears as "***" for example. But the message from the person will still take some place, so I'm not sure that's very effective :( Maybe there's another extension for that intent!
---
Well for me it is fun, to see you Rage. So I will just continue. It is funny to see people acting like you. So I am fine. Can also just throw you my Btag, if you are US and you can dig through my Friends. Happy they have all Clear Name activated :) Then you can google their Names.
---
Then you can go beg for Beta Access. But that won't change anything. Since the Statement is still active:
---
"they closed sign-ups for it from what I've been told. If they open it up again I'll let you know"
---
Yes, TBC came too early..
---
Ive tested alot around with paladin, and if found Retri paladin is total garbage for 1v1, and it kills way to slow to even think about 1v3.  And ppl will just run away from you.
---
If you have rly high Retri dmg gear Stun into Rep with gnom deathray might be viable to get "fast" kills.
---
Ive tested around with high spelldmg 2h Holy Shock Build, it works very well in duels but wont be viable for open pvp because you need atleast 30sek+ to kill.
---
The only Build that work very well for open pvp is Holy Reckoning 21/25/0 + Rest , at the moment in beta it looks very promsing to work. It will be a bit harder then on privat servers but if they dont change anything it will be very viable.
---
But i cant see pala working for solo open pvp without any kind of Reckoning Bomb build, and even with it, if ppl life your Bomb allmost every class can just run away.
---
If Reckoning dos not work Pala will be the worst class for solo open pvp, and one of the works class in duels, but its classic with the right consums and trinkets you can make everything work somehow.
---
There are a lot of ways to avoid that : the boss has 10 times as much HP or 100 elite bodyguards until you did the relevant PVE parts etc etc
---
nah
---

---
Don't forget to download a Video Blocker so you can block Youtube channels and keywords you don't want to see.  
---
Now that I've filtered them, I have my youtube back again and it's great.
---
good shit north, i want these mounts in the game
---
19" CRT ftw
---
But some people just like how those mounts look.
---
I don't want to buy and sell ivory raptors, I want an Icy Blue Mechaostrider Mod A. The base 60% mount with a blue fin in the middle. We're going back to Classic to deal with some unfinished business- I never got that mount and I'd like a shot at getting it now.
---
Yeah, but then you have to play on this server full of ultra neckbeards who have been proven to be among the most petty assholes of this community.
---
I definitely won't play on a server with 180 manchildren with nothing better to do than harassing any streamer they see. Seriously, read OPs coments in here. This is what peak neckbeard-dom looks like. This is what not having any kind of life outside of WoW looks like. OPs seems to be a bigger asshole than most streamers.
---
Oh, I'm so fucking happy I'm in EU. Fuck all those developmentally challenged assholes who're trying to force everyone to play in only the way they allow and enforce.
---
OP: Fuck you. You and all your 179, well, friends isn't the right word, since you're all just antisocial neckbeards, so, "aquaintances". Fuck you, you're worse than any streamer. Your argument is "Streaming diodn't exist back then, #nochanges". You know what also didn't exist? Cross-faction colluding neckbeards forcing an entire server to use their special little addon. I'm serious, all of you no-lifing neckbeards can go fuck yourselves. You are the worst this community has to offer.
---
Why you still got an XP bar at 60 though? Fake news
---
&gt;The i7-7660U you're talking about is not going to give you 100+ FPS on Ultra settings across your WoW experience. You will see drops into 60 or lower.

edited the link it whoops.
---
All servers that launched after 1.4 didn't have unarmored mounts at all. We're after 1.4 so not having them at all is #*NoChanges*.
---
thanks!

I heard it can be up to 20%, but that's worth it for me to keep working with one main machine!

Too bad that head piece isn't modelled more like Zul'jin is wearing it

Cool, thanks, figured there would be something like that
---
&gt;i saw it hit 30s
---
Kids those day : back in Vanilla, to reach 30 FPS was quite a feat ! :o
---
All servers that launched after 1.4 had dire maul released and worldbosses out- Classic wont. 
---
Your argument is bad and you should feel bad.
---
&gt; I actually know nothing about him and his fans
---
Yeah obviously not. There are no asshats following at all dude. Except a couple of streamsnipers from time to time. Maybe it will be different after launch, who knows.
---
What is with the  Manual Crowd Pummeler ? A lot of good feral druid players on the private server side say that this is best in slot. (You need to farm multiple ones of course, because that thing has only 3 charges)
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449#dropped-by](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449#dropped-by)
---
For me im still not sure if i want to play ret or feral druid.
---
So for your own game pleasure you will force 3000 people to act as you want , disrupting the server economy, forcing balance the way you want it with your totalitarian behavior.  How is the harm you'll do to that server  different  than what streamers do ? 
---
I don't defend streamers , I don't care. That you and your 180 zealots decides to camp kill streamers, fine by me , but that you force / coerce the server population to do the same , it is a no go to me. You can't and shouldn't force people to do how you please as an individual outside your own guild.
---
What is even worse to me is that you plan to share / spread your add-on to other people for other servers to follow and support your ideas and cult. Totalitarian propaganda at it's peak.
---
What is next step ? Ban the guy that you don't like even he is not a streamers and you to so much power that none would resist you and refuse to ?
---
We got a nice dictator in the making here... Ruler of the server.
---
Yeah just another example of reverse engineering from the legion client, good job!. Hope every little thing like this gets fixed.
---
Why are you so upset that a couple of dozen people could be allowed to reserve a name slightly earlier than everyone else?  Like it or not, players like Swifty, Asmongold, Sodapoppin etc are brands and should be allowed to use/keep them.
---
Incels of wow ?
---
I would feel very wrong charging guild mates for those but not so much for PuGs
---
You can't take back knowledge from players, and the mounts are an important part of Classic.
---
Why are there other streamers on the list? shroud and summit1g for example are csgo streamers right?
---
But if no one has privacy, we all have privacy, and if we're all socialists, none of us are socialists. What are you not understanding here?
---
I wouldn't account for levelling in my choice : you will spend far more time at lvl 60 than levelling.
---
Mages have the same cons than rogues : class over-saturation.
---
Warlocks seem very weak in PVP unless extremely geared and using engi and alchemy (just saw a video, the guy use a live action potion and or a engi net every time he's engaged by a melee).
---
Just because you like something doesn't mean you should be aloud to do it. We make laws in the real world just to cover for those kind of thing. Why is it so bad that a game creates rules so that everyone is aloud to have fun?
---
US gets it on 26th and they also had majority of the beta invites, lucky them..
---
It was just balanced I Vanilla!

Know that Google is [going to disable the API needed for ad blockers to work on Chrome](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/buwca4/google_just_gave_2_billion_chrome_users_a_reason/) unless you have enterprise access to it.

So be ready to look for a different browser if you want to retain your good experience, [Firefox is doing very good](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bxh0xh/as_google_ponders_making_ad_blockers_less_useful/) on this matter.

Also Note Chrome Meta v3 will block AdBlock completely. They made it paid. If you pay Enterprise, you get AdBlock if not, you have to swap to Firefox. There are big news about the new V3 thing.

what "nah". look up the stats -.-
---
Are you sure about multishot though ? I could swear it's an instant !
---
Good luck with your petition. But that attitude won't help you convince blizzard. I don't really care about them being there or not.
---
Blizzard gave their reason why they won't be there and I just said that their approach isn't deviating from how it was back then.

This is a point that doesn't get mentioned enough! Playing priest is completely diff for each faction, ally priests have to play much more offensively.
---
Speed is King. THC is 1.5 speed, has nothing to do with the weapon skill really. Also this is for single target. I imagine thunderfury is way better in aoe, which will be trash, which is where you're most likely to use these weapons, so yeah. You're about as (not) likely to get either weapon as Ret, so it doesn't really matter though.
---
Anyway procs are a misinformation meme and aren't the reason we use MCP. Details here:
---
No MMO is "cheap to run" vs essentially any other genre of game.
---
People seem to like making out that they are a license to print money when they will just flat out die if they have player bases that aren't big enough to support the infrastructure costs.
---
Having a button to dismiss flight path is a change.
---
Having bfa pet pathing is a change.
---
Having auto-loot in the options is a change.
---
Having bfa addons working just fine is a change.
---
Going with 1.12 but time gating dungeons and raids is a change.
---
Having 16 debuff slots at launch is a change.
---
Blizzard has made plenty of changes to the game already, so your argument is retarded.
---
Yha I know it wont be as hard as before. We have a lot more knowledge about the game. This does not take away that in beta the streamers where level 30 twinks
---
 Which makes it a lot easier. People will not spend there time gearing to bis at level 30 on the real game. So what you see right now in the demo is not representative.
---
Pretty sure they pruned them because they were trying to make 10 man heroic content balanced with 25 man and they had to homogenize the classes so that your average 10 man didn't need to have basically one of each class in order to compete.
---
"Lapdogs! All of you!"
---
Honestly, setting aside your silly pros and cons, for your one real question.. Out of those, Mage is probably the best/easiest to play casually.
---
I remember back in "original classic" when I raided MC. I had 10fps at most and had to angle my camera looking down on my own character "relativly zoomed in" in order to move around. Good old days.
---
So annoying to bounce like that on mounts... Thanks for the work! Considering they fixed flight paths, they might look into this :)
---
Druid tanks are also very strong in MC because their pre-bis is so good it makes them competitive with prot warriors for mitigation. BWL is where they start to drop off.
---
And stone form, and desperate prayer. It's kind of unfair really. I'd still be half tempted to roll nelf though...
---
No RPPvP server = big 'fuck you' to my entire guild and WoW friend group.
---
It's also super funny when the chicken goonsquad appears. You are like "wait a second" 0.00001 later you realise it's a multiboxer so you are already trying to fuckoff when you see the starfall castbar appear....ouch

Oh yeah I think I heard about that one! I don't know, I feel like people will come up with workarounds but if it goes that way, I'm 100% moving to Firefox, thanks for the advice !
---
Mage is the easiest to pvp with since they are designed around escaping damage rather than tanking it and have great utility no matter the gear.
---
A warlock will need to keep his gear on par with the competition or they will just tunnel him like a dummy.
---
Rogue can always be played as subtlety and be more of a quik cp playmaker than a pure damage dealer.
---
Personally I'd pick mage even with casual play it's much easier to get invited to everything.
---
If you're going to do any tanking at all you should always pick Mark of Tyranny. The third best mitigation trinket is Mark of the Chosen.
---
That does sound appealing! Any one in particular or is it really called Video Blocker? What's yours called?
---
#r00fles!

An absolutely awesome meme for: The more things change the more they stay the same! :D

How about installing FrankerFacez or BetterTwitchTV so you can actually see the emotes instead of just the words?

Hey mate that is great. Good work. I suggest to create sorting option for regions. It will be very easy for people to sort their region EU or NA for example instantly, instead of clicking on everyone separately to see what region are they playing. It was frustrating and time consuming for me. Thanks!
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs 15 mins for a blessing
---
Don't those things have terrible latency though? Not reliable.
---
We used to cross faction all the time back in vanilla and no one ever gave a shit back then, including GMs.
---
I appreciate the words of luck.
---
That being said, Blizzard's reason is a random dev saying "I play slow, and so should you." We deserve more a reason than that at LEAST imo.
---
I live one street away where they have 1GB fiber connections.

My street was supposed to be next ... last year ...

The wait is killing me as much as waiting for classic !!!

Mages also have portals

not gonna dig through it right now but I did remember seeing this

MCP gives a massive threat boost while it's up, though the base threat without it is very competitive with warriors. Generally the reason a feral tank is taken to raid is for their very high threat, so generally using 1 MCP charge per boss is enough to remove any aggro issues.

Dang, would be neat to have it before it happens... But there must be ways to have more data or boost your connection somehow, no ? Something between your situation and the fiber? :')
---
The only people this negatively affects are streamers and their fans/associates. Anyone else will barely notice the addon.
---
But you can also see how letting them have their names is very different from them getting gold n shit like that. Them getting to have their games does not set precedent for blizzard giving them anything that gives them an actual advantage in game. Your point it moot.
---
nope, no latency. as much as a regular key click. I have these and have been using them for pet macros. It rules. Definitely reliable.
---
Yeah I'm watching it closely too, the update should come out next fall so there's still some time.
---
I can't see how people can come out with workarounds though since only Google has control over their API, I just hope they'll change their mind about it.
---
Looking forward to that.
---
Honestly i dont even have a problem with the streamers. Its just the fact that they have 100+ people following them around and it completley ruins the feel of the game
---
That's from TBC...
---
its giving them priority over non streamers.  how is that a moot point?
---
Yeah, you're full of shit my dude
---
You can set up a blacklist filter in BTTV.
---
I really fucking wish they would release a physical collectors edition for classic wow :(.
---
Id even show up at 12am to get it for a sweet midnight release
---
Being so bad tanks cant stance dance ro get rid of threat lol
---
You are doing amazing work!
---
This is pretty spot on, I've been saying something similar to this on this sub for awhile now. People have the concept of what are the ideal classes for specific roles and any deviation from it whatsoever and they simply cannot or will not allow themselves to think outside the box. 
---
Outside of a few exceptions, DPS checks are not an issue in vanilla unless people are either not spending the necessary time to come into a raid prepared by being vastly undergeared or not bringing consumables or they are just awful at doing DPS. People often overlook the importance of utility in a raid too and survivability.
---
Trying to get defense capped is completely pointless as a feral tank.
---
Preach isn't a douchebag.
---
yea I know. it's still just weird. I guess all private servers used the tbc version of rogue's diary. but I'll let you know if I find the vid from 2006
---
Show us on the doll where the streamer touched you.
---
Fam im sitting in the airport on a 4 hour layover what else am i going to do
---
Not all of them are going to be playing on the same server which kinda individuates this.
---
Reminds me of "HARRY DID YA PUT YO NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FAYA?!" - asked Dumbledore calmly.

---
&gt;If you're worried about the chat being annoying because of their fanbase or whatever, the only ones you need to avoid are Asmongold and Sodapoppin.
---
Asmongold is quite fine imo,enjoyable personality, the MCconnel content (or whatever he is called) is hilarious, and the Esfand content as well. And they are just really passionate about the game.
---
Sodapoppin is unwatchable tho
---
If you have to ask this question do not tank. Play a dps.
---
Thanks for your reply , dps wise that thing at least some priv server druids say is bis aswell
---
‚ÄúMake it an even playing field‚Äù, mate, if they are stupid enough to share their location, that‚Äôs on them.
---
Also, no, the situation you described is not griefing. It‚Äôs PvP.
---
His stream is funny, he is passionate and he has great co-hosts when streaming. He is massive nerd and its just an enjoyable experience,although I rarely agree with his opinions.
---
Not going to happen. It blows my mind that people actually care about this, let alone start a petition to try and change it. I guess some people have different priorities...
---
lmao you fucking autists. get a life
---
Honestly any weapon that doesn't have a haste use like MCP just can't compete. They're all good weapons for trash, but even something like Corrupted Ashbringer scaling at 100% doesn't come close to displacing MCP on bosses.
---
Maybe Blackblade of Shahram or Torch of Retribution will be better, time will tell on those.
---
Anyway here's a post explaining why: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxmugn/eli5_why_mcp_is_bis_for_the_spelladin/eq91lk7?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

---
I would genuinely rather play on a streamer server than a server filled with private server veterans.
---
Of course, I'm just going to do what any reasonable person should do and roll on a server that has neither. Like everyone complaining about streamers can just do instead of this nonsense.
---
Xfaction is allowed

Cheers for creating this bro, now i can hunt that Quin maggot until the cows come home

This game sucks, I'm going back to Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

This is literally the most pathetic, butthurt post I‚Äôve ever seen on reddit lol. Please tell me this derp isn‚Äôt serious?
---
I don't see the random infernal/doomguard bringing havoc to the population though
---
I sure hope it does. That‚Äôs the lamest form of being a dildo on WoW ever.
---
Enforce compliance? Enforce go fuck yourself üëç
---
Druids main ability is maul, which has a large threat multiplier (the threat is the damage*1.75*1.495). Without a manual crowd pummeler this threat is good, but with one the threat is extremely high.
---
Also, getting squished is not a concern on non-frenzy/enrage bosses, since being able to hit the armor cap in pre-bis and having more HP than a warrior means crushing blows and crits don't come close to killing you.
---
In modern gaming the second bigger factor after developers making shitty games for someone to enjoy an online game is the streamers. Tons of bandwagoners follow them trying to get attention or make the streamer's  life hard (though they make money out of it) leading to a mediocre server or to a server that people gonna try things they cannot achieve.  
---
Just my thoughts.
---
Hide dis nephew.
---
The casuals don't need to know about the Songflower.
---
It gives streamers priority over something that gives zero advantage in game and therefore does not set precedent for that to be the case. You are over reacting. The only reason someone would take their name is to fuck them over.
---
we disagree.  time to move on
---
Back in wotlk I got a Max level buff while I was questing in westfall. Man that thing was good for lowbies.

the comment you're talking about on wowhead is from tbc. just checked

---
Excuse me? How the fuck is this even possible? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's amazingly wholesome and I'd love it but I really don't ever recall this happening.
---
But I guess if it's possible in the Beta then it will be (would have been) in Vanilla, too.
---
This is awesome. Too bad 99% of the time people would immediately attack as soon as the priest starts casting MC.
---
Here are some basic tips:
---
1) Always have your pet on passive. Whether it is solo play or dungeon play.
---
2) Always have a "/petattack" and a "/cast Dash /cast Dive /petpassive /petfollow macro": this allows you to move your pet directly to you in case it is going to pull some unwanted mobs. 
---
3) Learn where you can buy different kinds of ammo. Nothing is worse than to think that you are able to buy arrows in a place were you are only able to buy ammo. 
---
4) alwys make sure that you end up stopping by the ammo vendor at the end of your trip to town. make this a habit. and restock everytime. even if you still have 2000 arrows left. 
---
5) always have enough Food for you AND your pet by your side.
---
6) dont use /assist macros without checking whats the specific target. Your assist might have missclicked and selected a wrong mob in a distance far away.
---
7) never open sheeps
---
8) if you see the feared mob running towards an enemey pack: make sure it is dazed with concussive shot. or even better: scatter shot or wyvern sting it. (if you speeced into that)
---
9) make sure you have a little distance between you and your group members: if they get attacked, you can help out by getting aggro via distracting shot or scatter / fd / icetrap the enemy.
---
10) should be obvious: only use multi shot when no other mob, that is not yet pulled is in range, or when no cc is in range.
---
Yep, streamers are very good for marketing the game and keeping people invested.
---
I am just gonna play on the highest pop server possible, and if it has streamers on it, I couldn't care less.
---
Thank you for your excellent contribution to the discussion.
---
How about when people are following your dead ghost around? Seen that happen on streams.
---
Yes it's BiS for feral DPS as well, but unfortunately only crazy people play that spec to the maximum because you need like 10+ MCPs per raid. For tank it's more like 2-4 at most depending on how many bosses you tank.
---
This was alongside with WoW Vanilla, that has formed me as a person, during my teenage years, while playing. Got me into Pure Pwnage itself and helped me find some likeminded people :)

If your neighbors dont have enough to eat you should complain and go feed them, that is undeniable suffering whether its Mumbai or Memphis

You can get $3 of flourand eggs and make 20 meals of hand cut udon noodles(because anything but handcut noodles are disgusting, although I accept hand tossed )  for them and feed them for the next week (whole family) thats what I did when I didn't have money. And I would put my hand cut udon over any shit you get at a restaurant unless its a 5 star restaurant in East Asia, and I don't accept a shitty Asian restaurant in America

Currently most caster gear in MC is either a downgrade from prebis or a sidegrade (~5-10 dps gain). We do absolutely fine in prebis gear and I advocate daily in the discord to not take anything from MC in P1 except maybe T1 for later use (Loatheb). P2 we do want Choker of the Firelord as it's BiS forever, and we'll take a ring of spellpower if we can get one, but that's pretty much it.
---
Arguably the best thing about Spelladin is the lack of gear competition. We take a few select pieces of high value gear (Choker, Scrolls, etc) but everything else is paladin tier, quest rewards, dungeon gear, etc.
---
It's not about being flexible, it's about adding another layer of identity to your character. Instead of just saying you're a "Warrior", you say "Arms Warrior" or "Fury Warrior" or "Protection Warrior".
---
Just go over to the wow servers sub and see how bad the community is, probably the worst community I‚Äôve ever seen in gaming (worse than MOBA communities and that‚Äôs saying something).
---
I wonder if these giga autist ‚Äúanti-streamers‚Äù are aware that they are almost as bad as the demographic they‚Äôre shitting on
---
Is that a lock with krol blade

sudden switch to CSS from C&amp;amp;C.... odd.

Dude, that's not their modern judgement, that's the Classic judgement for a lot of people: we don't wanna rush it. If there's a carrot that has you burn through the levels, I think it sucks. If they have to respect your opinion, please consider that other people think otherwise. Now it depends how long they would be available though. Those mounts were not available and they're doing the authentic experience, so just deal with it...
---
Nothing makes me cringe more than hardcore players who have piss bottles. Just take 5 mins to take a quick bathroom break.  Obvs not related all that much but it's just how I feel.
---
Asmongold sodapoppin bad, preach good, upvote pls

Actually, this is just the community aspect of vanilla. If he actually manages to build this, I applaud him.
---
Lmao looks that way.
---
I came to WoW from FFXI and with regards to the economy it felt like I went from hard mode to easy mode.  I think when gold is less tight people are more likely to be generous with each other.
---
Everyone was a casual at first you genius, the game was new. I played this game at the time and you know how? Chill, slowly, appreciating it. If that's what they promote, that's my classic experience right there.
---
wtf
---
You really believe im Not crazy when i want to play ret or feral Druid? Xd . Did play underdog classes/specs in other games to the highest content aswell. I like the challenge. Did play rogue back in vanilla and that is to "easy" for me now. I like torture i guess xd
---
&gt; What if I refuse to use the addon?
---
   &gt;&gt; When a player joins a group, the addon will alert other members to your non-compliance. You will be sent a link to the download page of the addon with instructions on how to install it. Your name will also be added to another list within the addon. After 14 days from your alert, you will automatically be added to the blacklist and be subject to the same policies as streamers and their known associates.
---
This is the part that will make this fail. Unlike a lot of other people in this thread I actually want to see this succeed. It sounds useful and hilarious. But forcing unrelated non-streamers to use it would be the death of it. It may be hard to understand since you're so used to the elite community, but most players download as few addons as possible and would rather roll on a different server than spend 10 minutes setting up something. 4 guilds + hundreds of voluntary players using the addon is enough for it to work. Most of the other elite players outside your guilds are likely to want it anyway but it is imperative that you do not punish the casuals wishing to avoid streamers if you want your server to function. You don't need casuals to reach critical mass. Forcing them actively hurts you. 
---
I'm sure lots of people like myself would love to pick your server, be thankful for your efforts, but continue to play without using the addon.
---
In addition, I do think you're right that nothing here is explicitly bannable on its own, but remember that Blizzard can ban you at any time for any reason. It doesn't matter if you're technically not breaking the rules; they will ban you if they think you're costing them money. For that reason you want the community on your side. You want non-streamer casuals to be able to pop into your server and enjoy an unpolluted experience without any extra work on their part. People will love you if you do that. People will defend you on your behalf if you get banned. You're much more likely to get this to work. If you force people to comply, they'll complain about you. They'll ask for you to be banned. Blizzard will see you as taking up an entire server and kick you out so they can pay for as few as possible. Nobody will defend you. You'll never get off the ground with this. 
---
If you're serious about this then I honestly want it to happen. Community implemented things like this are what make MMO's interesting and I want you to succeed. But you have to change your mind and allow people to experience the server you've created without directly using your addon. Otherwise they'll be against you from the start.

Likely Bloodcaller from Hakkar in ZG.

Although it would surprise me that someone who's raiding Naxx is still wearing a 33 damage &amp; healing sword but he might've been very unlucky with weapon drops. Is the other caster also wearing that?
---
It's up to the players to choose to follow  him or not. It's like if my friend plays alliance and I play horde and someone on the horde kept camping him. He's an asshole and I  can choose not to play with him even if he's ganking Alliance. It's up to the player to choose who he plays with.
---
&gt;Now if you gank a streamer they want YOUR OWN FACTION TO RETALIATE AGAINST YOU. THATS NOT OK.
---
Retaliation is limited to a blacklist which mean basically "don't play with this guy. People have the right to choose who they play with. IF someone likes Soda or Asmon or whoever and they don't like a fellow horde member who's ganking them then they're free to follow the streamers advice and not play with them. Players have that agency. If they want to listen to their favorite streamers why not? It's not griefing to just not want to play with someone you don't agree with.
---
&gt; the jannies on the case
---
They do it for free!!!
---
Besides, they can't play on YOUR server if they don't use YOUR add-on ... 
---
You treat people that are not taking part of your crusade as the enemy you decided to fight. If they don't have your ideas, and don't follow your rules, then they are your enemy.
---
we all go bear foot in the spring
---
Irrelevant. Those are QoL, not available content. Auto loot was possible through a hotkey, what's the point of having it needed all the time then? Dismiss flight is a way to avoid having to disc/reconnect to cancel a flight. Those are not game breaking, nothing new will be there, it just replaces a dumb process with one that allows you to enjoy the game better.
---
Mhm, one thing I was thankful for with Blizzard doing their own servers is that it'll have far better moderation of chat channels and such.
---
Shadowpriests were renowned for being one of the most dangerous classes to face in a 1v1 encounter, so to answer your question: Yes, you can and will win a lot of 1v1 encounters.
---
subreddits not sure, but i know there are active class discord groups for every class with great discussion and resources
---
I know he lose the viewers. But just saw it, so thought it was worth mention. Even think Asmond followed him afterwards.   
---
But
---
Well, my question was if I am able to win 1vX encounters or am I too soft.
---
I didn‚Äôt know any guild mates who needed it. The guild mates who ran I split it with, so it was me, 3‚Äôguildes and a pug. We were either waiting on naxx or already clearing a decent chunk of it, we just did it as a nice way to make about 50g each in 30 or so minutes. The person got a no hassle run, we got our gold, everyone happy!
---
This
---
Thats dope
---
Yes I get constant lag spikes in retail not even at ultra, in the stress test it ran smooth as butter at Max in a crowded starter zone.
---
You're retarded if you think this will work. You will succeed in blacklisting yourselves from the rest of the community because most people don't have a hate boner for streamers. Sending people download links to your addon would be seen as spam and people would just end up hating you and anyone else that uses the addon.
---
Private server babies really are dumb, holy shit.
---
I totally did. Like VC's hair wasn't me. But I'm pretty proud of myself from 14 odd years ago for editing the swords to look like cruel barbs and making the mask from scratch. Also the little targeting circle at his feet. And I did the little beige straps on his vest I think too.
---
I didn't design the characters from scratch, and I think that is a Blood Elf Paladin in the group so it was probably right after that expansion came out.
---
Nice to meet someone else who used the Southpark generator/dressing room or whatever it was. Thanks for not shitting on artwork I made when I was a kid like a bunch of people have already.
---
The addon only needs to work long enough for streamers to pick a different server for their main, after that the enforcement can be disabled.
---
The best permutation
---
Armor and threat mean nothing in most resist fights
---
should be hunter 10 commandments, thank you for sharing

Yeah I think you‚Äôre right. Didnt even notice that the other lock also has it sheathed lol

Dude it was way easier than you think. Just hit drain on 2-3%.

How can I get an invite to their BRD lava run practice server lmao
---
Oh god I can just imagine a horde of lvl 1 black human warriors with red shirts
---
Have they stated they won't do rppvp ?
---
I answered that question, But since you decided that it's prudent to downvote me, and be a jerk to people who took time to help you, seek details as to why elsewhere. I will not be hearing from you again.
---
As to the new answer to your question: Given your attitude, you will lose. A lot.
---
You thin you do, but you don't.
---
&gt; Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as  griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our  players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable  environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and  Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in  account and gameplay restrictions. 
---
Blizzards Code of Conduct. Refered to by the EULA and thereby you agreed to this aswell.

Man, I am so excited to do Deadmines for the first time in years. My goal is to do a full run before I logout for the first time, even though I know it's going to take 18+ hours

"YOU THERE, CHECK OUT THAT NOISE!" might be my favorite quote from the who game. That and "I'll rip the secrets from your flesh." From SM GY.

Sorry for the ramble, I'm just really excited for Classic launch.

Welcome fellow hunter youll be playing the most popular and easy class so if you want an invite you better stand out.
---
You say this, but how many people are gonna go without showering for 24+hours after release. üòÇ

Haha pathetic. Who in their right mind even want to play on this realm? Its gonna be the biggest clusterfuck of a elitist tryhard realm. Avoid this bs.

Above tweet pertains to item implementation only -  [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/) has patch info so it's easy to tell when things will become available. This is just a guideline and a few items may be slipped in earlier and some later, take it with a slight grain of salt.  
---
Quests that are not directly tied into later content (ZG, AQ/War Effort/Naxx etc.) will all be available at launch, even the hubs that weren't ready at the original launch like Thorium Point.  
---
Yes you will need the Scholomance key and UBRS key or a skeleton key/rogue with sufficient lock picking skills to open those doors.
---
I think the point of the Addon (and announcing it publicly) is that streamers won't even join this one particular server. So this addon will ideally not be used, but rather serve as a deterrent.
---
What about poop socks?
---
Those are fine right?
---
I‚Äôm just sharing my experience as a lock in a guild competing for server firsts with over a year /played before tbc released haha. Maybe I was just bad but I know none of the locks I played with wanted to shard farm during raids and did so beforehand :)
---
Good ole 1 fps when you had more than two mages using an AOE at once
---
Thankfully I'm from Europe so I don't have to deal with all this =D
---
&gt;Those mounts were not available
---
Okay but they were.
---
&gt;I think it sucks. If they have to respect your opinion, please consider that other people think otherwise.
---
That's great, they should have the choice of how to play. 
---
As a example: MC and endgame dungeons were available on launch but weren't cleared for a long amount of time- so if Molten Core were + UBRS + other shit was available on launch, that wouldn't be right. You shouldn't rush so Blizzard should prevent any dungeons past level 50 from being cleared in phase 1.
---
That doesn't make sense, because they shouldn't be telling you how to play. You have a choice and it can be kind of a bitch and it involves a lot of time for a cosmetic reward- that's vanilla. Not everyone is going to be able to do it, but if it's worth it to you, it should be available.
---
You don't cut the baby in half because people are torn over what to do, you leave it in tact and you let people act as they may.
---
Want. I dipped into Twitch to watch the world first raid race last year and the inanity of the conversation in chat. I felt like it could hugely benefit from the ability to hide certain users, words/phrases, and to recognized spam and hide ensuing occurrences.
---
I don't suppose you've checked this out yet?
---
Thanks for not bashing it. I've got a surprising amount of messages about how humans shouldn't be in a horde party, or Blood elves (which is what it actually is) weren't in Vanilla. And apparently I missed the party tag in the last chat line.
---
&gt;Auto loot was possible through a hotkey
---
Not true.
---
&gt;hose are not game breaking
---
Neither are Unarmored Mounts
---
&gt;nothing new will be there
---
Still true if unarmored mounts
---
Respect for what, for not even being able to admit they were wrong?
---
*"You think you want but you don't"*...anyone remembers that? When did we hear an apology from those snide asshats?
---
The only reason why Blizz even considered classic: Their shitgame is dying, and they are afraid.
---
&gt;btw. Implement Arena into Classic! 
---
Downvoted just for this.
---
Is there even a decent area to discuss classic? A decent compendium of informative posts. This sub has maybe one decent discussion thread a day, are so few people actually excited for classic? I understand the lead up is far away, but there still a large breadth of content to discuss.
---
Small incentives would be a great alternative. Still encourages everyone who doesn't mind to get the addon but doesn't antagonize the players who don't want to bother.
---
Not sure if you are trolling. Im not asking for 1 v 1 encounters. 1 v X ( X is a variable for any number - in this case maybe 2 or 3) was what I wanted to know my man.
---
Rofl.
---
Haha dae hate streamers XD
---
Poop socks are acceptable.
---
Which icon?
---
So many hahaha
---
You got a clue where to find these?
---
Hydra is missing (EU Server).
---
(He will level as Alliance Dwarf and later play Horde Undead.)
---
The website is also good when you want to play together with a streamer.
---
Are there any practice runs for Scholo Key workarounds? I'd like an invite.
---
I think 3 out of 5 in the screenshot are wearing it. Did their holy pallies and healers all snag up the Azuresong Mageblades, Claw of Chrommagus, Staff of Shadowflame and whatever else from AQ? :P
---
Lmao what the fuck
---
&gt;Dismiss flight is a way to avoid having to disc/reconnect to cancel a flight
---
Post proof. As far as I remember it wouldn't cancel the flight.
---
*After a successful parry, the defender's "swing timer" is reduced by 40% of your weapon speed (or even reset), unless this would result in a reduction to less than 20% of your swing time remaining. This results in an average of .24 extra swings per parry*
---
So even if a boss parries an attack per second (which is unrealistically high, given some 2 attacks per second of a tank), they'll do 1.48 times more swings. 1.5 times more incoming damage is of course a lot, but hardly unhealable. And neither is an unlucky chain of parries.
---
What happens if when this add-on catches on for another realm or gets editted to include nonstreamer guilds or players?
---
Oh wow was totally gonna post this. Well played!
---
Priests aren‚Äôt short of instants either
---
You know everyone is new at some point, right? He/She is showing initiative and learning as much as they can before playing. Don't be an ass.
---
&gt; I've never seen so many fucking people get so butt hurt 
---
Goes on to write a huge paragraph about being butt hurt themselves. Hilarious.
---
Be wary of all locations where your pet cannot path along the same way as you, to avoid having 4 people considering how much of your gun could fit into your throat given enough pressure, while half the dungeon is bearing down on your group.
---
&gt; **They will have their bags and mailboxes filled with Heavy Leather Balls and Peeling the Onions. They will not be able to tag a single mob in any zone they're in.** 
---
Doing this from the same faction will get you banned and whoever is with you...  
---
There is no such thing as cross faction griefing, but same faction sheeping mobs, tagging mobs with the intent to prevent other player from playing the game, that is destructive behavior and will get you banned.  
---
That is no different from a perverted bias to other people. Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean you need to show/tell it to them, they don't even know you exist and won't even have any interaction with you if you don't try to start it before lol
---
Shift for autoloot came in 1.9 which means during the cycle that Classic is gonna go through. Meanwhile, unarmored mounts were before 1.4. You wanna keep doing this to yourself?
---
well, thats a good advice too, thanks
---
Genuine question, are streamers really going to be this much of a problem? I can‚Äôt help but think that the amount of people who plan on coming back to play will heavily outweigh streamers and their following... please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
obsession
---
/…ôbÀàs…õ É(…ô)n/
---
*noun*
---
1. A persistent, disturbing, often unreasonable preoccupation with a person, idea, or feeling.
---
2.  The inability to stop thinking about something or someone.
---
The majority of people also stays passive and does nothing, waiting for others to do the work. See climate change etc.
---
But Blizzard have explicitly said they mean to fix exploits. I would say it's an exploit, and probably this trick won't work in areas of relevance.
---
My boy staysafe doesnt get a shout out. Rude.

Practice server to practice BRD lava runs. lol fucking wut m8.
---
dad jokes are the best.
---
you must be a streamer follower, cause your lack of imagination shows:  this is already exactly what you are looking for.  ;)
---
&gt;I played this game at the time and you know how? Chill, slowly, appreciating it. If that's what they promote, that's my classic experience right there
---
Good for you. But people arent supposed to play the game the way you want.
---
Pre 3.0 is actually better looking animation, hopefully they fix it
---
Anyone else miss the art gallery section? Is that coming back.... please don‚Äôt tell me it still exists and I‚Äôve just overlooked it all these years!
---
There are some assholes underway today, downvoting literally everything. Goes to show how desperate the Retail fanbois are becoming ^^
---
You were NOT PREPARED!
---
Please see the updated FAQ. We've decided to not punish anyone that doesn't want to use the addon and will instead be offering incentives for those that do.
---
try to, if the spawn points are still the same you can just manage to meet at the middle, near stone hearth bunker before either side get's through...then you try push through or pin them while the rest of the team get the summon.
---
Precisely, which applies to not making people wanna rush for something that wasn't available anymore at that time anyway.
---
Skin yes, npcs no.
---
Super Geil Klasse!!!!
---
Whilst I understand what you are saying I would prefer it if I'm a Priest that can change specs to suit my guild's raids.
---
I've always identified my characters more by their class or role than spec.
---
At the end of the day you still end up respeccing, you just get penalised for doing so and likely need to ask your guild to pay for it sooner or later.
---
Unless guilds have no choice they are likely to prefer players that are willing to change their setup to suit the situation. I'd rather not be fined for wanting to help out the guild.
---
sign me up for this.
---
streamers can go to hell.
---
I'm someone who can enjoy asmongold but only under the condition that it's completely isolated from his chat. On a server that would mean I'd have to turn off everything but guild chat and that only serves to ruin the experience since the community is a large part of why classic is appealing.
---
I don't want to suffer from a case of terminal community cancer.
---
you really don't get it do you? none of the examples  you listed are actually objections /problems  we have about streamers.
---
Thats some facebook humor right there
---
What is that 'REEE' I frequently read around the subreddit?
---
"If you log out in flight, upon logging back on, you will continue your flight from the same spot where you logged out. However, in a flight of multiple legs, you will then land at the next waypoint of the journey. This behavior can be used to abort a flight, provided there are waypoints before the destination."
---

Not gonna research more than that for such a silly argument.
---
Great Work keep it up
---
Ya you're right mate, did the research!
---
Done.
---
another one that misses the point completely....
---
I've recieved a lot of kind of shitty messages that are correcting this "artwork". I'm not going to respond to any PMs, but I'll say this:
---
It is a Blood Elf. It was right after BC came out, sorry it wasn't Vanilla. I'm not really that sorry I didn't triple check all the details when I posted it. I was 13 or so and I'm glad some of you got a kick out of it. I thought it was silly and fun.
---
My toon was named Zenith, on the server Scilla. I was a Night Elf Priest, and was usually shadow for PvE and PvP, if you remember me send me a PM!
---
To some of you who are actually furious about this for some reason, I don't care please stop.
---
Learn to take a proper screenshot retard
---
okay mate
---
Delegate delegate delegate
---
Yes, there will be lots of rogues, there was at the time, there will be even more now. 
---
 Warlocks are a decent pick in terms of supply/demand, more so on alliance where Salv is stronger and they have to go up against Will of the Forsaken, but compared to rogue its no contest.
---
You're right, the text took quite a hit
---
A lot of people will be playing rogues. Warlocks will be easier to find a spot in a raid group.
---
Arenas are so boring, I would gladly fund research studing its effect on insomnia patients.

Master race for sure. Just a bonus getting fear ward.

Wow. I thought this was legit until I read the comments. How did you produce the mock-up?
---
Laughing in EU
---
Welp this explains a lot of things I've noticed.
---
Now i see your point, sorry.
---
Very happy you changed your mind and I look forward to playing on your server! Thank you for doing this and for listening to criticism. 
---
Don't forget to edit this little part though to fit with the new system: 
---
&gt;I was added to The Blacklist but I now have the addon and/or am no longer in a guild with a streamer, how do I get off?
---
    &gt;&gt;As soon as you download The Blacklist, your addon will broadcast your compliance to the custom chat channel and your name will automatically be removed. Note: This will not work for streamers themselves, your name cannot be removed from the addon without approval by the coalition.
---
He's not blue cuz he already out of mana
---
The raid leader wilm eventually take over their guilds. This is why Rome never felt happy about generals who won too many battles
---
Well, first, it would have to reach critical mass, which we don't believe would happen without a similar campaign to ours.
---
Second, almost all of the verification code is hosted by us. You'd have to completely rewrite this part to make the admin addon work. 
---
Third, you can't host copies of an addon on Curse, so anyone that tries to edit our addon will not be able to confuse players regarding its source.
---
You're all worrying too much
---
Also later in darkshore your quests involve killing Bears which often drop Bear meat. This helps out a lot but yes, load up from the meat vendor in Darnassus.
---
It's a friggin game, if you worry about playing with someone that streams you should not play at all.  
---
Economy is more important btw
---
Yeah, good luck getting more than 20 people to use your stupid addon, even if blizzard would allow it.
---
Add a EU/NA collumn.

a hardcore guild will beat any streamer to Scarab Lord. (it's not only about gathering carapaces) Their only chances are to get adopted by such a hardcore guild , bu I don't see that happening, unless the streamer originates from the hardcore scene and is part of them to begin with.  (unlike the majority of the streamers who come from the ' entertainment' side )
---
This is rather pathetic.
---
After release? Better step up your game bro.
---
Well, every participating guild will be making it mandatory and since making this post, we've received several inquiries from guilds that also have no interest in playing with streamers.
---
Second, we'll be offering major incentives and have a massive marketing campaign planned.
---
I fucking love fruit.
---
In vanilla I think our guild used a flat fee to be brought (which was relatively low) then a flat amount per item.  Can't remember if it capped out or if someone could literally buy 10+ pieces of gear in an MC run if they had a lot drop + money.  Can't really remember any instances where at least 1 piece of loot didn't drop though.
---
Whats with the appology culture nowadays. You are not entitled to one, be glad you get classic.
---
That's not really a huge problem for me in the EU, to be honest.
---
Our biggest streamer I'd say is Preach and .. he's only got like 1.5-2k consistent viewers on his Classic streams, and most of his viewers are you know ... adults. It's just a really mature community, overall, I don't think I've ever seen him get streamsniped even once.
---
I think you watch too many streamers with aids chats
---
&gt; -Skull of Impending Doom: 60% movement speed on a 5 minute cooldown at the cost of health and mana 
---
Breaks CC as well.
---
You realise it releases at the same time worldwide,right?
---
Nah wont sign
---
Nowadays dps have of course dedicated healers. This is for classic and not for vanilla. If you see someone using First aid you won't see him in the raid next time since he's losing a LOT of dps doing that
---
You should avoid realms with hardcore guilds, streamers are nothing if you compare them to top end hardcore guilds (at least the ones that are not in top end hardcore guilds), oh wait all realms will have 1 or 2 hardcore guilds, you should not play the game at all!  
---
If you won't play at least 8h/daily you won't be going to get that content so don't worry  
---
Lol
---
This sub overreacts a lot about streamers. It's really not a big deal
---
This petition wont change their decision lol
---
This wiki doesnt prove anything, that said, having a button to dismiss still a change so your argument still invalid.
---
Hahha so true! &lt;3
---
Jesus this looks amazing
---
Many bots closed lately because they couldnt anymore dodge blizzard... even simple rotation bots, even pixel bots who considered impossible to get caught. 
---
There are no bots in wow right now
---
The slippery-slope saying exists for a reason. It's hard to put a definite stop on changes when the definition of what is a small- and a large change will differ between people.
---
Off topic but is there any quest hjat involves stonecairn lake and the island? Never actually been there despite leveling like 10 humans through Elwynn over the years. I've done the murloc find but that's about it.
---
Preorders already went out, try your luck at Gamestops as they're most likely to take preorders still.
---
Streamsniping is allowed in WoW. If the streamer rolls on a PvP server he knows the risk.
---
Streamsniping while streaming isn't allowed by Twitch ToS.
---
Discover the Alliance capital city. Hit level 60. Time to kill the king lol
---
Joke streamer haha
---
Yeah look I kinda see what kind of person I'm talking to so let's stop, peace
---
Might be the only class Ive had more fun with outside of raids than when raiding. Easy to lose focus due to the rotation, have to be packing thousands of soulshards, expected to be a sum stone for all the slackers, often expected to help sum people for extra out-of-raid stuff, eyes glued to the threat meter constantly, the threat meters suck in 1.12 and the numbers are always way off, the new trial-tard has some kind of option enabled so he resets the threat meter mid-fight so you wiped and now 39 people wants healthstones again. Can be fun on short nuke fights though when you hit that 5-piece SB crit in a row without caring about aggro.   
---
Outside of raiding though I loved the lock, such versatility and a beast in both wpvp and solo farming.
---
Yeah we will definitely go easy! üòú
---
damn you guys are some grumpy old bastards arent you
---
Can't tell if you are joking or if you have no idea how retarded you sound.  
---
But even if your 'major incetives' and 'massive marketing campaign' work, there is no way in hell blizzard would allow an addon that promotes this amount of toxicity.  
---
But it would sure be funny to watch a bunch of neckbeards trying to play server police, so go ahead, I'm looking forward to the inevitable shitshow that would happen if more than 5% of the server population would actually take notice of this.
---

We're doing our best to remove streamer-only focused content; this has basically nothing to do with Classic.

I would bet a high percentage would, yes.  I haven't looked at the data but would really like to see the flavor of the month changes that happens when a streamer changed games. But twitch tops games is a good showing of how much that's changes. From pubg to fortnite to whatever this months flavor is.

Celestial Orb:  Given as an option when completing the level 40 mage quest.  
---
It's an offhand with an active that restores mana.  
---
It doesn't share a cooldown with anything and you're able to swap it for a better item in the middle of combat once you've used the active.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10455
---
Chained Essence of Eranikus:  
---
Gained when completing your quest for sunken temple.  
---
Trinket that lets you put out an AOE poison debuff to ensure you win duels/pvp against rogues since it brings them out of stealth.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=3863
---
Spider silk belt:
---
A cloth belt (anybody can wear it) that is extremely important for PvP especially against mages (frost spells), rogues (crippling poison) and warriors (hamstring)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14023
---
Barov peasant caller:  
---
Reward for completing the Scholomance quest chain.
---
Trinket useful for triggering hunter traps in dueling/PvP.
---
----
---
There are a bunch of other trinkets that have effects that are useful in PvP.  
---
But you should pretty much always use your PvP trinket and alternate between Essence of Eranikus and Peasant caller based on what's on cooldown.
---
These are pretty much all of the easily obtainable "Must have" items with active effects.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Great!
---
well you can level as holy reckoning (or only prot reckoning) too and tank/heal dungeons really easy, or just play ret (it is better 1v1 leveling). You will need int/+healing gear to heal anyways so don't worry about it so much, just carry like 3 - 5 pieces of int or + healing gear with you
---
Just become streamer lol
---
Ah Yeah,thanks man
---
Ah ok, I‚Äôm not really into the streamer or YouTube content creator scene.  Point still stands, the continuous mispronunciation was driving me nuts while watching it.  Thoroughly enjoyed it otherwise!
---
Staysafe is legit watch yourself

Ah apologies I misunderstood what you meant when you said you split it among them. I had read it as you charged X but because there were for they all split the cost sort of like a restaurant bill. Rather than you splitting what you got to them.
---
Added furbolg and edited the electromagnetic, thanks you
---
Edited thank you
---
Just start a big "anti streamer guild" and grief them ALL the time. You will know where they are due to their streams.  
---
Gear up or shut up.
---
ROFL! Well we had a lot of more casters in the guild than those 5. But 3 of 5 with bloodcaller looks very funny! Holy pallies tho?
---
So much complaint yet so little air time
---
This is just my guess, but the most played class will be warrior followed by paladin and rogue. 
---
If i had to choose just between this three classes, I would choose Warlock. 
---
- Less competitors, so it should be easy to find a raid slot. 
---
- I prefer to be a summon slave and prepare myself with shards than be that Food/Drink Bitch and carry alot of reagents with me, because of buffs and portals. 
---
- Unique and cool quest chain for your mount and pets. 
---
- Great Support for Raid Damage by your Curses
---
- Juicy Big Shadow Bolt Crits!
---
The celestial orb i will add as is very useful but the rest only seem important if you plan to pvp heavily which are not what im going for here
---
What the fuck kind of addons does twitch require?
---
Doubt you‚Äôre that good
---
Ja aber das is Zehr zehr gut
---
How do you figure out if someone hates streamers. 
---
Just wait for them to tell you.
---
Only people who don't want these in the game are the people they were taken out of the game for. 
---
Like having a mount unattainable after phase 2 will ruin Classic.
---
OG 300ms ping experience
---
Is there an easy way to take screenshot and take it straight in the cloud ? Like Steam
---
Blizz should just add a disclaimer on the server list for when a giant streamer plays on a given server. All their fans will know where to go, and I'll know where to avoid.
---
It is the worst role ever. You have to swap builds all the time. All Gear will go to main tank 1st so you wont Gear Quickly.
---
Tbh tipsout is cool.
---
I feel sorry for you. :(
---
Was the 2.0 the one that introduced the felguard? I remember duelling with my war friend, sending the felguard, applying couple of dots and then just jump around, it was so strong...they (rightfully) nerfed its damage after short time.
---
I was a rogue since beta back in the days.
---
This time i switch to mage for the first time for mass wpvp and big bgs.
---
Rogue is just nice to gank 1vs1 and is useless in big battles or should i say boring and helpless.
---
Maybe my prioritys changed.
---
I'll take Asmonpoppin for bank then
---
Based on the anti-streamer sentiment here on Reddit, we're confident there are enough players that would want this effort to succeed such that a streamer choosing our server would find gameplay quite difficult.
---
None of the addons features are bannable by the EULA. Blacklist addons already exist and Blizzard has never had anything to say about them.
---
&gt;Watain
---
Saw them in 2014, they put on an absolutely insane show!
---
Nice!  I remember the first time me and a couple of friends ‚Äòsnuck‚Äô into the bar tends as alliance characters about a week after the launch of the game.  It felt so dangerous and like I was going somewhere I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be.  Really fun times!
---
Hunter weapon
---
i played on OCE Server Barthilas, my name was villageidiot. Guild was Dominion by memory.
---
Own risk from playing on a PvP realm.
---
That's hilarious
---
the thumbnail is a beautiful pink haired gnome doing the sexy dance pose naked with NSFW across it!
---
yeaaah all the Druids where resto and i had a shit ton of dkp as no Druid gear was dropping or when it did i wasnt too interested in it. It was a rather strong mace back in the day it was the first item to have + attack in a cat form by memory. On a side note though World dragons were great fighting and contesting.
---
wow some people take their pettyness way too far
---
I honestly dont even know what to reply.
---
Ah, I just see this
---
I don't think that would be fair, it would suck to not be able to play wow on a pvp realm! It's a big big part of wow and they can't properly enjoy it because of their job! Of course it's hard to find out who is or isn't a streamsniper and who is just a griefer and all. Its not a good idea to ban streamsnipers since you just can't figure out if they really are a sniper. I just believe that streamers have a right to be that upset because afterall they just want to enjoy their favorite game.
---
It's all about the choice, if you wan't to have the game like it is you can go for it, I prefer to change up my actionbars and have a quest addon so I will. People being upset over how other plays should maybe stop thinking about others that much
---
Your also right. There can be people with the same name. Unlikely in terms of Asmongold but I get it. Just seems like a grey area now. We shall see in the future what they will do
---
I don't watch any, but having any of the big streamers on a realm is going to have a negative effect on the entire realm.
---
But in Legion you are also ‚ÄúThe Champion‚Äù. Not someone in the world (of warcraft) but the Hero. And for no reason aside of ‚Äúyou bought the game‚Äù.
---
Its like how we RPler despised those ‚ÄúSon of Illidan and Tyrande, Archmage, Half-demon half buttery-toast Warlock‚Äù on a nightelf rogue named √éll√Ædon.
---
that 'effort = sense of achievement' thing didnt quite work out for elite dangerous haha, the grind to get the better ships was brutal.  more because it was very repetitive than anything else though, that game had a lot going for it
---
I have no eggs in this basket (I do not care about if we get guilds banks or not, no matter the decision I am fine with it) but some people advocate the contrary to what you are saying. They say that not having a guild bank actually favors interaction since people have to actually seek other guild members to exchange gold and items while having a guild bank, you just drop em in and then someone else takes them with no interaction between them.
---
Yes, you are right I am stupid, but Shadow Mastery Destro Lock was a thing 30/0/21?
---
By constantly posting about how much you don't care about streamers all you are doing is showing how much you care about streamers.
---
Play on a different server to them and forget about them, everyone else will soon after
---
You know that maybe 1% of the beta testers are streamers? And even that is probably overkill.
---
How about shaman? Warrior Mage and Priest all in one. Something between a caster melee dd and healer, pretty universal and fun class i think, a lot of useful totems. I think to main this class.
---
Just from a horse perspective (I‚Äôve never ridden a raptor or a wolf) the movements the rider uses to control the horse are so small that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to see them. Albeit, Western riders might disagree.
---
That doesn't make sense on a pvp server, why would someone that will only focus on pvp pick alliance when on horde side you get such a big advantage in racials
---
I‚Äôm getting 450 on test server. French Perth here.
---
Medio core. Thats creative.
---
To be fair, you can have a very small non lethal dose of rat poison, which would therefore be in moderation. Granted there‚Äôs literally no point.
---
Hey - tbh mana issues are almost non existent for resto druids that aren‚Äôt regrowth spec (only the most hardcore are).  Resto druids should be casting lower ranks of healing touch and have no mana issues.  For this reason druids stack +healing and not mp5
---
Pick the lowest population server, level to 10 - 20 real fast then transfer your character to whatever server you want. With or without streamers. üòä
---
Luffa and Heart of Noxxion, one removes bleeds, the other removes poison
---
I have the same pad and have been using it just as long. My layout is pretty close to yours as well. I also have a gaming mouse with a bunch of buttons on it.
---
If you play on a pvp server I think it's about 60% more rogues compared to pve, pretty much all classes are solid for raiding though
---
Why do you care?
---
Not showering for a day is on the low end of the scale tbh
---
Why is he laughing so much? Yeah cool 5g...lets continue with our lives.
---
Still got the original box in my shelf
---
Thank you, added
---
Ziqo is NA? I thought he was rolling on EU
---
Both classes are able to win 1vX encounters, but it‚Äôs a matter of skill, gear and utilizing Engineering (and a shitton of Mana potions in the case of Shadow Priests) and of course it also depends on your opponent‚Äôs class, gear and skill.
---
Shadow Priest is better in the early phases with lower gear levels, Warlock scales better and has a realistic chance to get good caster epics during raids to become a raid boss. Warlock is also far better in larger scale fights/BG premades.
---
If you don‚Äôt plan to do serious PvE and just try to go for rank 10 gear, Shadow Priest is the better choice. But as other classes get better gear, you won‚Äôt necessarily be able to keep up with them. And even if you raid as a Shadow Priest, good luck getting those caster epics before Warlocks and Mages.
---
But I‚Äôd recommend you to consider playing a Mage if 1vX is what you are after, neither Warlocks nor Shadow Priests have any mobility which is more important than sheer tankiness in those situations and Frost Mages are the least gear dependent of the casters.
---
I appreciate it. It breaks immersion for me to watch my character bounce all around the saddle and my horse to gallop-trot. MAKE UP YOUR MIND HORSE
---
Cross realm zones. So if you log into a server called Illidan, for example, you‚Äôll see people from other servers wandering around the world. They will appear and disappear when the game decides it and it kills any sense of server community
---
Unless you enjoy the taste.
---
Haha I played resto druid and healed faced away from the fight with an addon to preserve frames.
---
Oh I thought u meant you could actually autoloot with a button rather than the modifier.

Ready to no-life this for 2 weeks straight at release! That's moderate right guys?
---
Part of the human paladin quest is on the island. There's a "special" knoll on the main shore above the island, north east, that can drop an 8 slot bag.
---
&gt; Even here in Classic players keep shooting down feral and ret as useless, paladins and boomkin as non-existant.
---
In classic I had a guaranteed raid spot as moonkin just because of the 3% crit aura ...
---
And also I was allowed to tank **twice** as feral. The first one was tanking one of golemaggs doggos. My priest commented:‚Äùi dont even have to heal this teddy at all, why aren‚Äôt we doing this more often?‚Äù And then next boss where we tried to let a feraldruid MT1 Majordomo Executus. Couldn‚Äôt handle the threat generated by the DDs at all.
---
Next time just take the walk back to Darnassus instead of writing pointless walls of text to get upboats.
---
Ummm... Drunk me probably noted WoTLK firemage and I reminisced.
---
Yes, just play on streamer servers.
---
90% of this reddit are normie dont think otherwise
---
Well, you could take it like that and up the dose to the point where you become more or less immune, right?
---
Upboats? We have those?
---
High quality answer, thank you. I dont like the mage playstyle tbh. Priest/Warlock is what I like more. Gonna play the Priest probably as Healer in Raids/Dungeons and DD in PvP. Not going to get Rank 11+. Im totally fine with reaching r10 and getting into raids from time to time.
---
The Warlock becoming a raid boss also sound pretty nice, but I guess the priest with the heal off spec fits me more. Thanks for your help again.
---
Me and everyone I know aren't streamers and we have beta. I've seen like two streamers the whole time I've played. They're few and far between.
---
yup, that or DS/ruin is the "Meta", but then you depend on pala/shaman to not overaggro.
---
The spec i linked is one that guarantees not overaggroing if there is no pala/shammy totem available. And it makes up for some of the damage loss of DS or SM by buffing your imp to the moon
---
As a human, you start with a 2h Mace. So you can level up with a 2h weapon and take Seal of Command(Retribution) for leveling. At around level 40 you can spec into Protection and start AOE farm and tank dungeons.
---
But you can play with a 1h + shield from the beginning as well, especially if you do it for RP reasons.
---
OR you could have taken the walk back to Darnassus instead of forcing that upon someone else because of your selfish actions. You could even asked around for some to party up with.
---
This is inside guild drama, if you're unhappy with being in a guild in World of Warcraft you have the ability to leave a guild. 
---
That said, I agree this isn't related to WoW Classic, being that it's just inside guild drama. 
---
I'd also say you might be breaking rules 1,2 and 3. 
---
Maybe check out the community info tab.
---
They are the former human citizens of Lordaeron that where killed by the Plague or Arthas and then raised as his servants. When Arthas started losing power, some undead managed to escape from his command, thus creatinng the Renegades lead by Sylvanas.

Are you having fun. Pro yes. Con no.  All that matters.  A good Druid can hold their own.  It‚Äôs one of those classes that you have to learn how to manipulate your enemy and optimizing your toolkit.  Druids can be horror stories if properly played
---
"Don't judge me post-60 for the things I did to you pre-60"
---
The vote buttons are a bit close together, 4 people have accidentally voted warrior instead of paladin.
---
Big 3 from what i remember.
---
1 learn to control your pet. Everyone else going into this decently, but practice. Remember if you're doing something with finesse its faster to dismiss and resummon than run back from a graveyard.
---
2 I use to say as a hunter I had a shot for what ails you. The rotation is simple but you have what feels like 50 situational buttons. Good hunters do decent dps. Best hunters understand dps is nice but your kit is packed with utility. My ui was disgusting back then because I did dps from my buttons and clicked on anything situational, which is like 90% of hunter abilities.
---
3 learn every other class a little in gear, if I could go back and have a cheatsheet of like warriors need this that and the other stats in that order and the stats convert to this much ap this much armor and all that for each class it would save me alot of irritation. Cant tell you how many times I had to talk someone down from the reeee fest because they reverted to flaming hunters as a species when they lost a roll on something. Somewhere along the line the punchline of everything is a hunter weapon changed to nothing is a hunter weapon how dare you roll on anything. But being able to calmly objectively say this is a better upgrade for you because of xyz is better than letting them reee you into a bad reputation.
---
Keep both.  One for when you‚Äôre on the offense and sword board for when you‚Äôre on the ropes.
---
It's actually more optimal to raid with two-handed and shield together.  
---
I believe in you.
---
Raptor &gt; Cat
---
Damage is the about the same but armor is much more valuable than hp in terms of efficiency.
---
They were part of the Arthas' Scourge army, obeying the will of the Lich King. Since Arthas is not on the continent anymore, he has no power over you and you begin to have your own consciosness. You remember your past human life, but you feel no emotions toward them. Go kill some bats and give me 8 of their fangs.
---
except it isnt breaking any of the rules. it's a humoruous post mocking somebody's classic guild.
---
Was a spur of the moment reaction. Also the server I‚Äôve been frequenting for my classic fix restricts text communication until a certain level. Scummy for sure. But it is one of the many ‚Äúcharms‚Äù of classic.
---
Any reference or proof?
---
Neckbeard: the post.
---
I'm eu so.. i'm really just making fun of you
---
I doubt it. Majority of the people don't even know about twitch. They didnt even know about streaming games. You won't even notice I bet.
---
if I get the privilege of seeing every trash twitch clip someone can scrape up there isn't any reason this shouldn't be allowed either
---
Why are you so condescending and defensive? 
---
I never said I agree with Blizzard. The person I responded to originally said they **can't understand** why they aren't making one. I can *understand* it and still *not agree* with it. 
---
I can explain why Blizzard is doing it this way while still thinking they are wrong.
---
You're making me non-streamer Tips...   
---
You wouldn't like me when I'm non-streamer Tips
---
I love this. Am I supposed to because I really do.
---
these are not my hands?!
---
last I remember they were chopped off by an orc
---
That's the whole point though. A design philosophy they decided on.
---
Yes, hah. good one.
---
Trust me, some girls only want this too
---
Yeah, because in this context i meant whole reddit and totally not the half of this subreddit that are actual apes. ü§îü§îü§î
---
Got any proof for that claim?
---
It depends on how fast they will say on which server they play.
---
Haha, that's funny.
---
It's not quite the same as that but yea, it's somewhere along the lines of them possibly not understanding the playerbase fully.
---
Anything goes when it comes to leveling. My courtesy to others comes at the cost of my leveling speed. No thanks to that.
---
Played right, youll be having fun even as a DPS druid for sure. Dont worry and play what suits you the most!
---
I guess it depends how you use it. For a leveling guild that might be the case. For a raiding guild, however, it works like a common pool of high value resources like Devilsaur leather, raid BoEs, consumes, and it opens up for debate on what to do with X item.
---
Spoilers! :p
---
I love this, and in our home -- this is so true.
---
We do both, sports and gaming -- but it's all good, no matter WHERE your friends are located!
---
But I will tell you, there are hundreds of times that I will take a buff party over a beer pong party!  :)
---
Cat not for sale!
---
hunters unless they get the first binding
---
I want to avoid the streamers but I also think whatever server most of them choose will be the only "safe" server. The rest will become ghost towns within a month or so.
---
Which means I'm most likely going to be forced to play with the streamers :/
---
Youre accusing an admin of "Selectively censoring posts he doesn't like and white knighting his favourite streamer" while linking his Reddit name in the post.
---
Bruh, you need to hit the repair button on this shirt.
---
IIRC Paladin's have to rez an NPC for part of their questline in learning Redemption
---
If I see someone waiting for a boss spawn I‚Äôll throw out a quick inv for the kill. In this case, that wasn‚Äôt possible. I like to hope that the guy just thought I was a dumb newbie trying to be helpful in the worst way possible.
---
Hunter is the most friendly beginner class there is, with lots of room to grow in and gain expertise.
---
Bless you. Thanks!!
---
Its not about HIM its about the ppl around him. Lets say he dings 60 lvl and some random dude from his stream gives him all bis and 1000gold for nothing. Then you meet him in world pvp and he kills you coz he got better gear for just getting streamer benefits. I like ven hes a good and chill dude, but i dont want any streamers on my server - it ruins the whole immersion in one way or another.
---
Poop socks were common in the EverQuest days before instances. People would camp a mob spawn for hours at a time and didn't want someone to steal it in the time it took for them to poop.
---
Hunter. You can eat glue and still be fine. Nearly impossible to screw it up. Loooooooooooooooow skill floor decent skill ceiling for best use.
---
I was leaning towards Hunters  as well. I just don't want to have to be competing with a million other hunters. Though I'll make one regardless at some stage as hunters were my first class.
---
 Awesome!
---
I wonder if they think there isn't enough players who do RP to have 2 servers. Maybe they think RPPvP players will just play on RP realms, but the opposite wouldn't be true and if RPers had to choose between RPPvP and PvE they would just pick PvE.
---
What do you think of that theory?
---
I smell a clicker
---
Thanks heaps for you reply :) I'll start with Hunter and progress from there.
---

Streamer tips, nicest guy you've ever met
---
and non streamer tips, a twisted fucking psycopath
---
Yeah and your account is 7 days old. Fuck off.
---
What does an individuals behavior have anything to do with 
---
Classic WoW?
---
Fuck yes. This is what I originally had in mind for the pvp tournament on the beta server. It would be so fucking awesome having everyone not competing sitting on the stadium seats. But yeah, there‚Äôs always someone who has to ruin it.
---
it wasnt directed towards OP, but this sub in general. its just annoying seeing every post about how much they hate streamers. this is about classic wow not them
---
Druid is the perfect casual option, as long as you are willing to play something other than a DPS in group PvE (trust me, you‚Äôll find a group quicker).
---
Despite Warriors being THE tanks of Vanilla WoW, Druids can tank all the 5-man instances quite easily and can even do the lower-tier raids. 
---
As the least played class, getting a raid spot as a healer is quite easy and you will get your tier sets quickly.
---
Regarding PvP, while in premades you are going to be a flag carrier, world PvP is a different thing and I‚Äôve seen quite amazing 1vX Druid PvP videos, just look up Stormx on youtube.
---
Not as cringey as a streamer‚Äôs laugh.
---
Keep it as problematic bro, they are.
---
Seems like everyone forgot there was an LFG tool in vanilla, though rarely used. Meeting stones weren't always a discount warlock. You could use them to queue up for the respective dungeon but because running to the stone first just to queue up was rather inconvenient they moved this feature to innkeepers in patch 1.5.
---
It wouldn't teleport you to the dungeon but match you up with other players once the group is ready.
---
I know they were because I was one of them.
---
Useful when going in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.
---
That was a really good one :-)
---
Hunters. Once you get to level 10 things get pretty easy from there. Just keep in mind the journey to 10 can be a bit of a challenge if you try to rush into every encounter without much thought.
---
You guys are so fucking pathetic, it's hilarious.
---
You could try reading those actual posts, they mostly outline the posters feelings towards the issue.
---
Soda plays horde and didn't he make up all this blacklist stuff? I could be wrong I find the whole thing silly and haven't been following along.
---
Aw, is someone angry?
---
There are obvious reasons why I would use a throwaway to announce our intentions and gauge Reddit's pulse on the matter. We've already received some great feedback that made us change some of our plans.
---
Meeting stones and innkeepers don't work in the beta? LFG was a feature until they changed it in 2.0.
---
100%
---
Hahahaha.  Amazing. 
---
I think we will underestimate how hard classic was when we all realize we aren‚Äôt 13 anymore. 
---
Hilarious screen shot.
---
Which is bullshit in my opinion. They shouldn't get favors from blizz
---
Can we stop making this thread 5x a day.
---
So your tinfoil hat theory is that they have no data at all and this is literally all Ion behind the scenes literally pulling this out of his ass? It's all guesses by one man?
---
They can‚Äôt stand to see someone else have fun when they themselves are miserable.
---
If you're not planning to raid Hunter is a great choice. Low - Medium skill level for beginners. Great solo levelers. Your pet can tank elites for you. Great money makers at farming.
---
They should all play on the same server. Easily found, easily avoided!
---
Bandage spec bro
---
Why are you copy pasting your blanket response to me in different conversations in the same thread?
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/Ev-cy000SaM) does a pretty good job of explaining some, if not most, of the issues.
---
If you buy party food you can eat it hot or cold, and within a matter of seconds, I highly recommend.
---
I just wish they started making good mobile games where you just oay upfront for a good experience rather than this nickle and dime bullshit...
---
I would still recommend warlock if you are even considering doing mc and bwl, a warlock with max bwl gear can be very strong, and you have alot of tools to fight back against ppl and if everything gos wrong you allways can go SL and be a absolut Monster.
---
Its a class where you can just allways raid the next tier and be super viable again, and SL is super broken even if ppl outgear you, you will win more often then not.
---
Like the guy said Shadowpriest will feel super strong early on, i played shadowpriest on most privat servers the point where you cap out with rank 10/mc staff and bwl/mc offset epics is mid to high bwl gear, with this gear good players just start to overpower you , with aq40/naxx you will start losing to very bad players and you cant rly raid to get similar gear since you need the stamina, and even the rank 13 sets only gives you just abit more time.
---
If you only plan to pvp shadowpriest will be for sure the better pick but your fun will be on a timer.
---
And like the guy said, Mage would be a more sensible pick for open pvp, since both warlock and priest have the problem of no mobility, ppl will just run away from you, ppl will just zerg you down and often 1vX feels like just one question, do i have the hp to tank until they die.
---
Has one of them been "stop being stupid entitled delusional little shits?" cause it would be a great change.
---
Now don't get me wrong, I want you guys to go through with this, it would be fun as hell.
---
So absolutely fucking delighted about being an EU player, not having to deal with this type of honky-tonk inbred drama.
---
Dont get a blood clot, get some squat ups
---
If I wanted to raid, can you as a Hunter?
---
Oh I‚Äôve read them. They are endlessly saying ‚Äúra ra we hate xyz ‚Äú they don‚Äôt really answer why they hate someone for playing their game
---
Shout out to the wowhead engineers that marked all those quests and data as depreciated 
---
They are making an effort with classic wowhead but most NPC‚Äôs are location unknown but you can google them and get a pserver wowhead copy with the NPC marked on a map.
---
It's not on this list of unofficial changes, but I could've sworn that mounting in the Gurubashi Arena wasn't allowed in vanilla either. It's currently possible on beta.
---
Thank you
---
Good mean subjectively.  That‚Äôs an opinion mate.  Matchups matter.
---
It was just for my own amusement so you dont have to worry about the quality
---
Go warlock so I can live vicariously through you. 1 word, nemesis. Mic drop.
---
I dont hate them at all, i think you should watch this video, explained very well why should avoid their servers :) 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)
---
:laughs in dingo: ;)
---
Seems it isn‚Äôt well known and that‚Äôs why it keeps being made.
---
Because people are brain dead and can't use the search feature.
---
Nowadays you can look like that at level one, more epic even. Sad days.
---
Yes you can, however they will only take 1-3 per raid, where they will take a lot more warriors, mages, rogues.
---
ChinglishTV if possible by any chance?
---
Thank you for using your brain power to respond, I appreciate you
---
Ah gotcha! That sounds so interesting! I‚Äôll have to look into some more
---
Like, how do people choose their roles and what happens if they go off the rails? Is the game completely the same as for other servers, is the only difference that players are choosing roles to play?
---
Rogue hemo wasn't affected by this, slow weapon still best, like a teebu's, if I remember?
---
Cool. I'll just join a guild :) thanks heaps.
---
They are jealous and have nothing else to do
---
Because he's the embodiment of what people started to say back in WotLK when the game got so casual. It's kind of like a bunch of people feeling validated with "I told you so"s.
---
What about the typical laugh males have
---
I feel like there's something missing here. The thing is, I'm fairly certain that in 2.3 they changed the animation on undead epic mounts to begin with. I know because I complained about the forums at the time. They were suddenly switched over to the same animation as the non-epic mounts. For that matter I believe that was the same patch where they randomly [butchered the animation on Blast Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_72tGvfecI). Someone please check that as well.
---
If someone that has an undead epic mount on a private server can check what their animation is there that'd be great, because I wager it's not what is being displayed in these 3.0 videos either.
---
You'll use whatever items you can get your hands on. What is this question lol.
---
Forsen - EU - Potantial impact: CRITICALLY HIGH
---
This is amazing. Thank you for sharing :-)
---
Potention to change Forsen from VERY HIGH to CRITICALLY HIGH, you underestimate the Forsenboys /u/littlesunfish
---
Good luck!
---
The thing is that he's right. Soda is not being a hypocrite by saying "I camp people just because I'm an asshole but I don't like it when people stream snipe me", because being camped in classic is easily avoidable, whereas being stream sniped is not. Essentially it all boils down to whether you are full blown hunting some one person and restlessly griefing them thanks to information -i.e. the stream- which allows you to do so and puts you at an unfair advantage over them or not.
---
If you are camping the first lowbie that you stumble upon in STV while looking for some easy world PvP action, that is not ill-natured. The lowbie can easily : Call for help if in a guild, Log on to their main and get back at you if possible, rez sickness then hearth, or simply just log out for a little while until the camper gets bored. 
---
There is a plethora of options available to the occasional campee in order not to have their WoW experience ruined by some asshole like Soda, whereas there is little to none for the Streamer who is harassed on a regular basis by legitimate jackasses such as Gachibass whose sole purpose is to annoy and get attention, without compromising their stream AND their Classic WoW experience.
---
Hi, /u/TheRealRecollector
---
I also agree hunter is a good place to start, but Priest is a rather good class for a beginner as well, the grind is much slower though. Priest is one of the few "finished" classes in classic where all specs have a use and can/will be used in raiding and pvp. 
---
But imo, choose the class you like the most, vanilla is a pretty noob friendly game and with the time it takes to get to 60 you will get skills along the way.
---
Even as a near 40 y/o... it got a smile on my face xD
---
I don‚Äôt feel like enough people are taking into consideration the fact that you may not have much of a choice. 
---
It‚Äôs highly unlikely that Blizzard is rolling out more than a small handful of servers at launch, and once the player base normalizes it‚Äôs my opinion that Blizzard *will* conduct server merges if it‚Äôs warranted. 
---
So unless they all band together and join one PvP server, when the dust settles in 6-8 months post-launch, you may not be able to find a server that doesn‚Äôt have at least one streamer playing there.
---
üòÇ
---
Isn't that just... A montage of clips? Literally what you want to do is what you said you're not doing?
---
OT: probably twitch clips or those that get posted here.
---
Would love to answer this in a fun way - but I just dont know what you mean...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk
---
You can run an external DPS meter, but linking them in chat is bannable.
---
After watching this video, would you agree that this is sort of blowing things out of proportion or do you think that it would actually be as bad as it says in the video
---
I don't know what you're saying. What are they wanting to blacklist now?
---
There are a lot of people stuck in the past within the classic community. Any change to how things were in 2005 is met with fear and anger, it's only natural.
---
‚Äúpserver players‚Äù might be 100x worse than streamers.  
---
I enjoy the classic beta and will play release, but I‚Äôve never had the slightest urge to play a pserver and I wouldn‚Äôt want to smell anyone that does.  
---
The worst type of wow player personified and multiplied.  When those try-hard pserver guilds announce, I‚Äôll avoid their servers.
---
He's a bit of a cocksucker but he has a very strong grasp on the human psychology that makes games like Classic so good.
---
i was there :)
---
So if I'm aiming for r10 gear + mc/bwl gear - I'll be outperformed as a spriest by "nearly every" better geared player? That would be indeed pretty sad. Well, know im back where ive started and am confused about what to play. Lock sounds now more amazing...
---
You won‚Äôt need holy talents. You will need int.
---
People will tell you to stack strength and carry a spare set of gear for healing but the impact of strength really isn‚Äôt that great at lower levels whereas the impact of running out of mana is. I prioritise int over strength while levelling. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean I wear cloth; on my armour pieces, I‚Äôm looking for mail and later plate. But as far as stats are concerned, I‚Äôm more interested in stamina and int than anything else. If I pick up some strength or agi along the way then fine. On my accessories, I‚Äôll prioritise int even more as mail, plate and weapons will generally have more than enough physical stats. The trick is to gear like a paladin, not a warrior.
---
If Blizzard won't punish extreme griefing (which they probably will) then the community will have to.
---
 silence is golden
---
Looks like his wife Celinedion is already gone.
---
Too easy :) thanks for your help. :)
---
Ahh forgot massive server imbalance wasn't a thing before the nasty streamers came along. Good point.
---
Sorry, my bad explanation. What I mean is that I don‚Äôt just want to grab clips of random streamers (which I could!). But create a classic montage PVP style movie like from back in the day that you might find on Warcraft Movies etc. The best of the best. 
---
Where us average non steamer folk might just screen capture our games from time to time.
---
Just looking to find what the best way might be to request these clips and/or find them if they‚Äôre frequently posted for free usage.
---
Very nice post thank you. I was toying with the idea of rolling a druid because I probably won't have time to level a warrior and a priest. This has helped me.
---
I mean if I‚Äôve understood it correctly the idea is just that people who continuosly ruin the game for streamers just for a few second of attention will be ‚Äùblacklisted‚Äù so that other streamers and their guilds can avoid them. Basically meaning that if you‚Äôre an asshole to people you will be treated like one. I don‚Äôt really see the issue.
---
I was sure I was gonna play a dwarf male, but you have my attention. - I can't seem to find a video of dwarf female casting animation from Classic. - Do you by any chance have one?
---
Be efficient and set up in the bathroom. 0 breaks, 10 gallon water cooler with ice water, fruit in a bowl resting on top of the water. Proceed not to move for 10 hours
---
Have they publicly said this yet?
---
Oh and I was on Dial up too.. jeeeeez....
---
You‚Äôre doing the gods work, sir
---
People saying streamers are toxic but people on here are far more toxic when talking about streamers. It's getting silly.
---
Still the best box I‚Äôve ever touched
---
Just read Azuresong Mageblade is phase 2 BiS for holy pallies due to the lack of healing weapons in MC. Lok'amir from BWL is also damage &amp; healing but BiS for resto druids and holy paladins. Robably because pure healing weapons weren't really a thing until ZG/AQ
---
200IQ hah
---
It's going to be the same thing effectively. You and everyone else doing it just grab the "best" (subjective) clips. They always stream so those clips will be publicly available on twitch or when they upload it themselves to YT or whatever. The only difference is how you'd edit it together.
---
I mean to be fair, population balance on some servers has always been an issues. No doubt that streamers influence population. But that doesn't mean your server is guarenteed to be better without streamers
---
Besides Forsan, its just such a beutiful sight at how few streamers are from EU
---
OP is having a serious problem with language, but some streamers are proposing a blacklist of players who kill them in PvP. Technically "stream snipers" but there's no way to prove that someone is stream sniping, so it'll be a list of people who are just playing the game and fighting them in the world, probably including some people who don't even know or care what Twitch is.
---
Damn, raiding in heirloom gear. Guess the game really was easier back then.
---
(for the love of god please catch the /s)
---
How much DPS could I expect to do if I become a cardiologist?
---
Can confirm, Swifty ruined Darkspear
---
I used to have a somewhat similar dilemma as Warlock and Priest are the two classes that also appeal to me the most. 
---
I‚Äôve tried your idea to raid as a healer and respec for PvP when I‚Äôve played a Shaman, it wasn‚Äôt that good as respecs are quite expensive (though I could stay in 30/0/21 in most farm raids). 
---
It would be even less viable with a Priest, as there is no overlap between the PvE healer and PvP Shadow builds and as a Resto Shaman I had no competition for caster DPS mail gear, but as a Priest you are competing with Mages and Locks who have priority over you.
---
Currently I‚Äôm leaning towards Disc/Holy Priest as I actually like healing in PvE and I love winning in PvP, where usually the side with the more healers have an advantage.
---
Impossible due to the green color
---
Soda addressed that by saying that if someone kills him in the open world he won't at first throw any accusations around, albeit he might get skeptical in front of viewers. He mentioned ways to find out if the person was a stream sniper or not, for instance going into cat form stealth and seeing if the camper knows exactly where he is, in which case he would probably get very annoyed.
---
So is hard to master but rewarding when you know fight your Enemy. Require experience.
---
I do appreciate the idea of there being a server without streamers. However, this particular server will be its own form of cancer. Just imagine the amount of black lotus and devilsaur drama (and also world bosses, that shit will be brutal) these neck beards will make. I don‚Äôt want to be on a server where I could be blacklisted for challenging some pserver nolifes over some mats.
---
The have the smae cast animation on retail if you have that.
---
Well and for world pvp, nothing better than having an advantage over someone
---
Not only about your class but others too
---
    Streamer: Payo

    Server: TBD

    Faction: Horde

    Region: NA

    Problematic/Popularity: TBD

Fuck microwaves, true high level neckbeards have an air fryer in reaching distance.

Why say lot when say little
---
I hope Addons will be limited available such that AH addons are not available (I personally never liked the use of AH addons as it can drastically influence the market). Although an addon that will allow you to put on multiple stacks of an item at same price should be possible.
---
Tidal Charm: [http://classicdb.ch/?item=1404](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1404)
---
This add on is literally ToS issue, Blizzard will likely ban anyone who uses this.
---
You dont see the potential abuse? Someone kills a streamer, talks shit, and gets black listed for playing the game normally?
---
Feral or warrior tanks - it's BiS for fire resist and aoe tanking.
---
Good luck with that, I really hope this is success just for drama among streamers. :D
---
Oh the stream sniper blacklist, yeah I've read about that bit. Thought this was something new.
---
The thing with that is, the only people actually going to blacklist someone for allegedly stream sniping is those that are following the streamer, which will be the same faction. 
---
Everyone else will happily be killing said streamer and followers - not because they are sniping, but because they have found them randomly in the world and decided to kill them as they are after the same resources/mobs/whatever - or, if like me, they are literally just out in the world to enjoy WPvP. Streamer or not, if I think you're a challenge I'll fight you. If you've got no chance I'll probably leave you alone.
---
If people can abuse something that benefits them, they will abuse it. It's just how things are, from the smallest game breaking bugs up until the biggest schemes that can be done.
---
Probably keyboard turns too

Everything you need to know is right here

---
I Hope that report will help you understand this situation
---
I feel like 4chan is the most sunlight these people have seen outside of their pservers.  
---
They will indeed be in for a rude awakening when game services again have rules.
---
This should just really encourage the community to streamsnipe and camp them. Some of these streamers are keyboard bullies, probably because they were bullied  irl, and should be ignored. Well unless you are camping their corpse.
---
I mean let's be honest them getting streamsniped all night is way more entertaining than their normal content.
---
Classic, I hope he really sells cats for msk
---
Ruining the stream of some attention whore and the entertainment of their mindless drones is not extreme griefing, it‚Äôs a community service.
---
I play a mage. And never NOT buff people. I can‚Äôt imagine if they took that away from me.
---
Is this allowed? I thought because it changes files that you can't use that stuff.
---
Right but how much will that truly be noticed by the average player

Anything can be beginner friendly but it depends on how competitive or hardcore you're going to be. Warrior can potentially be one of the least beginner friendly classes because depending on what you aim for your end game role, you could be required to learn how to maximize DPS, how to tank, and how to DPS, and all of those roles require their own sets of gear and talent specs. So, playing a Warrior at a high level is like playing several characters in once.
---
Rogue is a lot more straight-forward, so it might be a better choice for a new player. Hunter and Paladin also come to mind as pretty straight-forward classes. 
---
Ultimately though I say play what interests you the most, because there isn't a significant enough difference of "noob friendliness" between the classes.
---
Since when? Are they making changes to Classic from vanilla? I've played a druid since 2004, and we weren't viable tanks until BC when our threat was increased and our armor multiplier skyrocketed. 
---
It was *possible* to do single target tanking with good armor and good healers, but it was easy to loose threat to a high dps class, and if that target had any sort of threat resetting, then it was really pointless. We had one feral and the most he was ever allowed to tank were trash mobs, and we always had to take down his first before all of the warriors.
---
will there be enough players on oceanic servers?
---
Lok'Tar Ogar! The Horde have not forgotten these atrocities! The Alliance will pay with blood!
---
Help me understand why u can't search the damn sub for things like this
---
I see what you mean. But when I'm alone out there farming or whatever - I want to destroy attackers or attack farmers. Guess thats not possible with Holy/Disc...
---
I feel like the decision between Priest and Warlock will take a couple of more days...months...
---
That's not a bad idea. It would have to exist outside the current table. Possibly a second table below the current one. The reason it would have its own table is because it's just a different set of data. A non streamer server or low impact streaming server doesn't contain just one streamer.  Thanks!
---
It's almost like because streamers are... Streaming... They are more visible, even if you can clearly see there's an entire raid group (or 4) of players fighting each other and only a few of them are streamers.
---
But nope, beta is only streamer access! /s
---
Imagine playing a race that doesn‚Äôt flip when they jump
---
~~this post was made by night elf gang~~
---
You're right, I am not entitled to an apology.
---
And Blizzard is not entitled to my respect, thanks, or even goodwill.
---
I will take classic, and still call them arseholish fucknuggets, for what they did.
---
Do you enjoy slow placed RPG? then yes, if  you enjoy fast paced instant grat games maybe not.
---
I would say yes, but make sure you give it a good go dont just quit @ 30 atleast get to 60 even if it takes you 12 months.
---
Ty so if I one day want raid probably have to be as healer. So hiped and happy to play again this gem.
---
These files are placed inside the Interface folder. You're not replacing any 3D textures. You're only replacing the appearance of elements that can be changed entirely by the use of addOns anyway, which is why Blizzard is ok with it.
---
What you are proposing sounds more like an addon for targeted harassment, and blizzard not explicitly outruling something does not mean they will tolerate it.   
---
Reddit is a massive circlejerk, if you honestly think this subreddit is accurately representing the classic community I have bad news for you.  
---
You are also not factoring in people who want to avoid streamers but still think your idea is fucking retarded, like me for example.
---
The ultra hardcores go to the bathroom / eat on flight paths. What evidence do you have that people really piss in bottles?
---
Honestly I might join an RPPvP server, but if I ever came across asmongold - DOA
---
His youtube is pretty big and his tournaments are massive, but keep hating.
---
How would this work when dealing with low to mid tier streamers? All streamers are blacklisted or just those chosen to be added based on which factors?
---
I want to add I was in no way disregarding your work either. I think it‚Äôs great what you‚Äôve done!
---
Sodapoppin on streamsniping like 2 years ago btw

https://clips.twitch.tv/ResourcefulNastyClipsdadLeeroyJenkins
---
U must have been ahead of the trends, eating ass in 05
---
Because most of them are obnoxious attention whores and their fanbase is even worse.
---
Back in 2013 or 2014 on ED when Twitch was not so popular yet we had a DPS warrior in our guild who also happened to be a streamer. During one of the boss fights in BWL he was too busy chatting with his viewers instead of listening to the raid leader so he stayed in the fire and died. That was followed by a raidkick and a guildkick. The disappointed look on his face was priceless, I just had to screenshot it.
---
Nobody actually does that.
---
Can't say that here. Everyone on reddit unreasonably hates all streamers and there can be NO exceptions.
---
Sarcasm duely noted, I think it happens to be naxx trash drop chest piece that kinda looks like lock t0, had a tonne of armor if it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm thinking about.
---
I have an actual autism diagnosis and this is some next level sperging even for me. That or some high quality top kek...
---
There's far too many people in existence for it not to occur. Also, a former friend of mine used to do it when he was playing CoD on release.
---
This doesn't sound like my experience in vanilla at all... There was no boomkin/guardian, you couldn't taunt mobs off tanks for more than a couple seconds before they went right back to the tank or killed you in one shot, and there wasn't much utility because you were stuck in a spec without an expensive respec and you were entirely gear dependent. 
---
I loved playing a druid in vanilla, but it was a painful leveling experience compared to almost every other class. And at 60, there was no real viability other than being a healer. So solo world content was really a drag.
---
Well answered. Thank you for taking the time to respond. :)
---
tru
---
What a surprise, wowhead is still shit.
---
Wasnt there a beastslayer enchant or something that also gave that glow?
---
Hi! There is a column for region. If you're on mobile, you need to press the green plus sign to expand the data set which contains region. I currently only have 2 EU streamers on the list. Part of this is that there isn't as many EU streamers, but also because of language barrier. I'm just not as familiar with non english streamers. Please feel free to recommend who to add to this list outside the US. Thanks!
---
I thought I was the only one irked by the janky animations Blizzard does for horses. They had it right the first time, but then somebody who needed to justify their job went and changed it to something uncanny.
---
I can stand the rocking horse animation some horses have done in the past. The new Goldenmane was guilty of it for a while till there was enough backlash enough to hotfix it to something snoother.
---
Also when is Blizzard going to tell the difference between a horse gait and a goat gait? I'm looking at you Warforged Nightmare. That gait is actually taken from the animation of the Swift Windsteed a goat-like Kirin (Qilin).
---
Used to have a friend who did it with CoD. Believe me, people do it.
---
This is what I was hoping people would understand. :) Thanks.
---
You would know full well if you have been following this along since Nost shut down that the streamers gave this a voice. Whether or not you like streamers doesn't matter.
---
I love sonii
---
With the old manual that was gigantic lol
---
He won 17 to a 16 roll
---
I'd cream myself
---
For a streamer with 100 viewers or a few hundred followers? Not at all and I am sure that those are fine and even healthy for a server. But for someone with 10k+ viewers or half a million followers? I don't see a reason why a 5k-population server with 2 or 3 of those streamers wouldn't consist almost entirely of streamviewers. Not hard to hold a whole server hostage, if you are one of those streamers.
---
It doesn't seem blown out of proportion when looking at estimated server capacity (let's assume 3k - 10k) and average viewers / total followers for streamers, who basically only play one game, so their fans mostly also play that same game.
---
Wouldn't mind ganking around with payo.
---
It would be worth this addon going live just so they can auto blacklist me when I don't install this shit then it takes no effort from me to avoid these mentally ill people.
---
When Ion announced there wouldn't be one at launch I decided that I won't be playing until one is released. That is the experience I want and I'm not going to invest money, time, and energy into a character that I have to abandon to play the game on my terms.
---
This meme was exactly what I was thinking, I hope they announce what servers they‚Äôll be playing on before launch cause I‚Äôm gonna avoid it like the plague.
---
Also I hope there‚Äôs gonna be more than 1 type of server, I‚Äôm sure streamers will be on a pvp server and I‚Äôd love to role a toon on one but not on a server with them.
---
Side note: I have nothing against streamers, I‚Äôm just worried of the traffic they‚Äôll cause etc.
---
I've got into oldschool Runescape so yeah I guess. I'll give it a shot but I think I'll just get frustrated that everyone knows just about everything and I know nothing, who knows tho. cheers :)
---
Imagine being autistic enough to write this post and come up with this plan.
---
More than anyone thinks 4-6 servers worth as long as they don't fuck up and give us the same amount as NA we will be fine.
---
&gt;casting lower ranks of healing touch 
---
I had totally forgotten about this.... 
---
My raid bar was almost entirely HT spells. It was like an art form quickly judging the right amount of HP to heal for without over/under healing. Regrowth really was a pointless spell in raids. So much of the ticks went unused if other healers were healing the target to full health, and the mana was a real drain. And god forbid you used your innervate on yourself instead of a priest.
---
I can't believe 15 years later and people still don't understand that what they are seeing all the time in congested areas is not server lag.  That's the client bogging.  There's still some crazy ideas people have about how these games actually work that are just fundamentally wrong.
---
You got new hands. They don‚Äôt match. They can still throw level 1 frost bolts. Now finish this quest to get some linen shoes!!!
---
For the Banshee Queen!
---
Shroud and Summit1g are large variety streamers now. Shroud use to play Vanilla quite a bit and well educated on the game. Summit has also been streaming classic for a while now. Last I saw he was close to 40.  
---
I think you're also going to see a lot of streamers move to classic wow to give their channel more content. People have been playing BR games for 2+ years now and I can imagine that some are tired. Classic is a social game with plenty of 'downtime' for streamers to interact with their chat.
---
I hope they add interesting caster items with a decent proc on spell hit. It always anoyyed me melee get all the interesting items.
---
24 hours? What are these fucking rookie numbers!
---
They also nerfed Sunwell really hard prior to WotlK prepatch (I think just before).  M'uru wasnt called the guild destroyer because he was easy and so many people didn't finished Sunwell because they managed to beat the hard, well-tuned version of him.  Place went adrenaline fueled gaming to snoozefest in 1 nerf patch.
---
15 years old ? isn't that illegal ?
---
My Spirit Beasts.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. My friends all want to go horde but I am a paladin at heart. I was torn with my decision but I‚Äôve decided to go priest this time so I can play with my group.
---
I haven‚Äôt been. I only know this because I‚Äôve been around since before Nost, which I learned about this year. 
---
I have been around since TBC though. The streamers didn‚Äôt give it a voice. The OG wow fans did. 
---
Move along.
---
Finkles skinner for the extra skinning levels
---
Just take it slow if thats the case mate, the game does not force lore down your throat you need to find it yourself. Read the quest test and the books and stuff mate its a really good RPG. 
---
Hope to see you there.
---
They're approaching their 40's and still stuck working jobs they hate, seeing people almost half their age earning massively more than them from just playing video games triggers the fuck out of them.
---
Probably not true for all of them but it's all I think when I see them getting mad as fuck.
---
Don't waste your energy trying to understand why angry manchildren do the things they do.
---
It was! After figuring out a warrior name for this comic, it made me want to roll a warrior which I got to about level 13 before I quit playing a warrior.
---
wow bro...what a sellout. I thought you were all for no changes n' shit. Lets pack out bags boys, this guy is a fucking PHONY
---
You should also consider whether there's a paladin or shaman. As /u/dbdozer said, having a paly is way better for your ability to tank.
---
If Blizz caves, and does make a RP-PvP server pray it's a quiet server that doesn't build a standing reputation. A few of the bigger streamers, not long after Classic was announced, decided to do a 'project 60' thing on Moon Guard. It was a mess, the streamer, and their legions griefing RPers both in and out of character, and just being an all around nuisance to the community.
---
Trade alone went from being its usual self to being bombarded by "LF project 60 Guild!!!" "Invite to Asmonds guild!" "Invite to Asmond!" To anyone who watched or played the stress tests during the final moments it was up, and saw all that spam. That's what Trade looked like on Moon Guard after the whole project 60 thing started.
---
Yes its necro knights garb from naxx trash
---
If your worried about someone he never really played wow and really enjoys his diablo genre style game. 
---
I think we are good, besides you don't see hundreds of plebs following him around.
---
I for one envy you that you are ablel get that sence of feeling trying vanilla for the first time. There's a lot of good moments to experience. And also the community is one of the biggest factors of playing. I'm sure you'll get all the help you'll need along your journey if you decide to try it :)
---
It is not only for Classic though but WoW in general so it includes stuff like mounts for BfA and prints for each expansion etc.
---
tips for death before rank 8?
---
I'd actually say going in blind with a fresh and new experience would be the best way to play World of Warcraft, I'm actually so jealous that you're getting to experience this for the first time just now in 2019. 
---
The feeling of stepping into Azeroth and making my way through the world can never be replicated again, and I'm still so excited for classic to come out so I get to relive it once more. 
---
Nostalgia aside, I've played quite a few mmorpg games and WoW is a great (gameplay wise) among the genre.
---
I will help you as you have helped me. Cheers
---
yah
---
Feral? Not sure if troll.
---
I played since 1 month after release in 2005 on EU servers and I have never, ever seen this happen before. Let's hope I get a good server where I can join in on this.
---
Crystal of Zin-Malor https://classicdb.ch/?item=13347
---
alliance only trinket, it's an objective of a quest but you can keep it on you forever as long as you don't turn in the quest. 
---
it simply drains health/mana every second while you have it equipped, it's very useful for tanks to cheese bosses that apply some kind of CC on the tank (Jin'do/Tiger Boss in ZG for example)
---
This is not an add-on, it's fucking video game apartheid you vitamin-D deficient manchild.
---
Haha thanks, man! There's a lot of really talented artists posting in this sub, and I wouldn't say I'm one of them but I do appreciate it.
---
Thank you, added.
---
I forgot about proff aid items, pretty sure there is pick axe for mining and gloves for herbalism too, will have to try find them
---
Hey thanks for your input! Heh. Yes there is a sorting option that will always be preset on desktop. For mobile, you have the green plus arrow, but if your phone resolution is too small then you're unable to sort by certain columns. Making tables and sorting for smaller screens aka phones is uh... not always the easiest. I am just using a jQuery library to help me out with having this table be responsive.   
---
Thanks for your input though and I'll look into possibly solutions for someone to sort while on a smaller screen :)
---
Haha!
---
Most of the players won‚Äôt have AQ/Naxx gear though.
---
What you see on retail WoW and during the beta stress tests, where the player can see their character move but all other players start running in place is absolutely a networking issue (that I wish Blizzard would iron out instead of forcing layering on everyone).
---
You can compare it to videos of private server launches that have an equivalent number of players. There's none of that running in place networking lag that modern WoW has, but you will notice occasional chugging and frame late loss from all of the player models, and that is the antiquated 1.12.1 client struggling.
---
Also they were rejected by the alliance for being dead that's why they joined the horde
---
I might have been a few years too early, but I can hear Terrance and Phillip in my head. 'EDWIN VAN QUAF!'
---
You‚Äôll get banned
---
Alright, So this is the true min max:
---
Water, you really do need to drink a fuck ton of it. Stay away from caffeine until you've hit critical mass. If you start with caffeine you will crash and not be able to play for extended hours. Try and not eat like complete garbage, it will make you have to shit more, thus less time playing. Stock up on nuts, like Almonds and cashews, perfect for lonnnnng sustaining energy.
---
It's a bit of both.
---
I don't think as many people will main hunter this time as before.  I have seen so so so many people saying they want to play priest, for example, which a LOT fewer people played at release.   We'll see, but I think hunter is a great choice to get started.  I will probably make a hunter alt for farming- they are pretty fun!
---
"I'll play anything, what's the easiest?"  
---
Are you fucking serious lol? Play BFA man.
---
Dont suppose you know the damage it deals, could be handy for elites or bosses that use cc outside of raids
---
Yuuup. I'd start a pot of coffee and an audiobook.
---
Never underestimate the power of Smite! And Mind Control of course.
---
Oh man, those keybinds! You didn't even bind judgement, how are you supposed to release those seals? Haha
---
I think my keybinds were similar back in the day, I only realised how the seal - judgement system worked until somewhere in my thirties :')
---
He was ballin with over 306 gold pieces
---
Staff of Jordan, nice
---
There is a difference between release week and every other week. The rule is:
---
\- We do not talk about what happened on release week.
---
After that, this tip is very important! Follow it!
---
Not if you're from the US
---
U da real mvp bro
---
So just a normal tank swap used in both many other MMORPGs with tanks and in almost every single wow raid boss post wrath?
---
As someone said I envy you for your position.
---
Feral is also somewhat viable, it takes way more effort though. If you are fine with being a healer, you can‚Äôt really go wrong with Druid (or any other hybrid class for the matter).
---
Because it's a BETA not early access.
---
Well they said so on the official website right? That there would be some kind of earlier access to claim names and that the char would remain lvl1 until release date.
---
I started with a dwarf hunter back in 07 I have mained a few other classes since druid, DK Pally, warrior mage. I think hunter is still my favorite although the only this is it's going to take a while to get used to auto shot not being mobile
---
Pff energy drinks and Adderall, why not just go all out and blow through a couple of grams of coca√Øne, might even be better for your body
---
"common"
---
All of them have retarded names. If that's the best they can come up with, I don't want to watch their streams.
---
They have an amazing tittie bounce too
---
I mean not showering for 24 hours is perfectly fine, especially if you're just at home playing wow. Not showering for a week or more and are also peeing in bottles is where shit gets really bad though.
---
This is stupid
---
if the mods want to ban me for their own personal bias and not for breaking any actual rules, go ahead
---
only +mining items that i can remember are +mining on gloves enchant https://classicdb.ch/?item=11203 and a mining helmet https://classicdb.ch/?item=10542 (engi only)
---
you need 305 mining to mine the obsidian nodes found in ahn'qiraj so these are useful even when your mining is maxed out at 300/300
---
for skinning there's finkle's skinner like was mentioned but there's also the zulian slicer from zul'gurub https://classicdb.ch/?item=19901 as an alternative (paladins cannot use daggers so if a paladin picked skinning he has to get this sword specifically). they can also get an enchant to their gloves 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=11166 and skinners need 315 to skin bosses so they need both a weapon and an enchant to their gloves.
---
herbalists have a pair of gloves https://classicdb.ch/?item=7349 and an enchant to gloves https://classicdb.ch/?item=11205 which allows you to combo both into one slot but i don't know of any use for them past 300/300 so it's mostly just a leveling thing.
---
Ever considered using the *looks around* Privvy?
---
just get this https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink-twitch-gui
---
no ads and you can use mpc-hc instead of a shitty web browser
---
If you don't do drugs and don't have i9 rig with 30inch 240 Hz IPS panel you absolutely won't be able to enjoy classic!
---
Their names will be taken on every server
---
Fear ward OP
---
Tauren cause Horde
---
this subreddit sucks, just give up
---
All things in moderation, including moderation.
---
Yeah boys let‚Äôs fuck shit up, give streamers the true world of Warcraft experience. Send em to retail if they can‚Äôt handle it.
---
You mean how like a bunch of players made posts requesting Blizzard to expand the content release schedule and they changed their decision?
---
There is an issue on EU at all for streamers haha
---
Dorf priests were the real MVPs of vanilla wow, one of our human priests enticed his brother to play the game too, he chose priest like his bro was arm twisted into dwarf and subsequently carried by everyone to raid gear in no time just so we could have a fear ward to fall back on should stance dancing ‚Äúgo wrong‚Äù.
---
a paladin or a shaman, since there are better options for actual melee.
---
don't expect guild help farming this meme weapon though. ;)
---
I'm on a 9700K and a 2080, make sure you're not frame limiting because I was getting 200+ fps constantly
---
Not at all: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid
---
&gt;Like, how do people choose their roles and what happens if they go off the rails?
---
Depends. Some groups of players like very structured RP and have intricate storylines with their characters. Usually you'd make your character together with the people you're RPing with then. Other times its more spontaneous. Spontaneous can go off the rials and have fun but structured storylines prefer to follow along. It's generally seen as rude to purposely throw off the RP like that. It's like playing DnD, how you act depends on who you play with.
---
He literally wasn't popular for a very long time. 2018 would be a good starting point
---
Huehue
---
I do real time tournaments for money where long gaming sessions are neccessary and we play in large teams (guild). We still get at least 6 hours sleep and step away for real meals. Nobody ever regrets stepping away to take care of themselves in my team.
---
lmfao
---
That thing is dirty and in awful condition, bite the bullet and throw it out OP
---
Thanks ive added both the herbalism items and the mining, excluding the helmet as proff locked
---
I don't consider being forced to play as all other class and race options possibly for the majority of your playtime on your toon as being the same character, you literally have to change everything about your toon to be able to progress.
---
unfortunately, i am expecting only 1 or 2 oce realms so 50/50 chance that i roll with quin. i dont think he will impact the realm nearly as badly as a real WoW streamer though so silver lining there.
---
This is because of what wowhead is, I think. It's not a bunch of nerds with too much time on their hands manually inputting data about what is where, it's a bunch of nerds installing an addon that gathers data about shit and uploads it. So if someone has the wowhead addon on the stresstest and they see rag in Elwyn,wowhead is going to show rag in Elwyn.
---
Can all these "streamer" posts focus on NA streamers, EU has no issue at all.
---
It will be abused. Who is going to decide if if they are being sniped? If they don't want to deal with PvP, don't play on a PvP server.
---
This is not something to be proud of.
---
I watch streamers, lot of fun and interesting infos, but to play on they server i think it would be bad for regular players, just that, no hate for them at all, they do hard job to be honest, maybe it look easy to stream but its not, i get tired after 2 hours playing :) imagine 12 hours or more :)
---
Which was completely justified on the part of the alliance honestly
---
randomized between 100 - 500 per second and is reduced by armor, though this is data from a private server i played on so the values will very likely be a bit different on classic wow.
---
Did this in front of Onyxias lair a couple of times. We also had a paladin who got his first windfury procc. That it was on a mage guildmate was entirely secondary.
---
Damn what a bunch of plugins that uglify your screen
---
I got you my man. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18717/hammer-of-the-grand-crusader
---
I listed adderall or similar when the caffeine makes you crash.
---
Killing some one repeatedly on a PvP server is not griefing.
---
Jo da sieht Sie noch gut aus und nicht wie eine Anw√§rterin auf den Porno Oscar ... ;)
---
?
---
I'm only going to play the night of, so I have the day to see what happens.. hopefully there will be server info out that quick or at least people will talk on the forums/reddit etc.
---
Hmm il add it, could have its uses if you have some form of healing to keep you topped up
---
Same
---
Why not just bookmark it?
---
I never realised it would be such an impactful thing. Definitely plays a bigger role in my server selection now
---
Is high refresh rate really less tiring?
---
Everything in moderation including moderation
---
Slight warning if you DO choose to go hunter (as everyone insists is easy);  
---
Though at its core it might be easy, you might find weaving abilities between autoshots at max in raids to be a pain in the ass more than its fun. Not reaaally speaking from experience, but from what I've seen, its pretty strict in what to press in order to not have huge dps losses.
---
The best part, Classic release is peak time for US but 11pm-4am for most of EU. Schools are back so no kids
---
It's going to be fine on EU ha.
---
So like China and their social credit score system? The future is now
---
Its a BC zone, the warrior is dw 2Hs.  Its not a vanilla screenshot.
---
There is honestly zero point in trying to read chat on a stream with more than a thousand viewers. Stick to small streamers if you want a more relaxed chat.
---
No one is forcing casuals to to rush to get unarmored mounts though. It's a really silly argument, essentially saying that if some people can't get this item, then no one should be able to get this item.
---
Not to mention this attitude contradicts other classic gameplay elements that are being kept intact. Should they make obtaining Rank 14 easier because casual players want HWL weapons? Should everyone on the server get Scarab Lord as soon as the gong is rung?
---
No, these were exclusive achievements only obtainable by a certain % of the playerbase. Unarmored mounts are no different. They're actually more attainable than those things I mentioned.
---
Haaaaaaaaxxxxxxxx
---
No shit
---
The generation gap really fucking shows on this site. You‚Äôre all fucking weird.
---
He's only talking about his time played.
---
My first mission will be to make a Nelf Druid, take a boat to Menethil harbor, dodge the mobs in Wetlands (low tuba plays), traverse Loch Modan, freeze through DM, take the Deeprun Tram, look for nessy, experience Stormwind music, and end my journey where my adventure begins, Goldshire (do doooo do... do doooo do do do doo do do doooooo)
---
Yeshhhh!!!!!!
---
In a classic wow subreddit.  Hes in the wrong place.
---
Ah, it could easy be how long he we 60, we good
---
Does the existence of HWL weapons force you to play enough to get Rank 14?
---
Does the existence of the Scarab Lord mount force you to be one of the first people on your server to ring the gong?
---
No. This argument is stupid. Classic WoW has some exclusive stuff. Excluding unarmored mounts doesn't make any logical sense.
---
Lordearon was the bastion of the alliance against the Horde invasion, decades ago. It fell quite recently to the betrayal by their Crown heir Arthas Menethil and his Lich King masters forces.
---
Those who was risen include but is not limited to:
---
Civilians and soldiers buried after the Horde invasion.
---
Civilians living and traveling in Lordearon during the spreading of the plague. The soldiers who was sent to investigate and fight the undead menace under the command of Arthas, Jaina and Uther and his Silverhand paladins.
---
Civilians living and traveling inside lordearon during the betrayal and fall of lordearon. Soldiers who desperately fought against the hordes of undead but failed and was risen to kill their loved ones.
---
So lots of Roleplay possibilities really.
---
I think the stigma of the tard will evolve in classic, once the reality sets in for people that warriors have become the new tards.
---
Charging into every fight early and stunning b4 tank even positions, pulling threat off tanks and getting chunked in their pseudo rogue gear, "DPS War LFG", asking healers to babysit them in pvp but never peeling for them, "I don't have a shield", when they do cave in and tank they perform poorly while having a chip on their shoulder, reserving loot on top of that, rolling on everything like deadmines staff cuz muh dps... you get the idea. Gonna be fun times.
---
Sounds like hunter is for you. They're great on their own, even in vanilla. Good leaders did well as a hunter because you control the hunter's mark yourself and can stand farther to the back and view everything that is going on. 
---
If you want to do dungeons as a druid, you'll almost certainly need to be a healer. And it's a full time spec, unless you want to spend a fortune respeccing all the time. And that really diminishes your ability solo. Druid versatility improved a lot in TBC, but damn was it bad in vanilla. 
---
Hunters were always a pain to fight in world pvp, but a druid was a drag to play as. We could pvp, but it was a sloooooooow process that made it boring in vanilla.
---
Orc stun resist got a -10% nerf in TBC and a lot of popular arena comps have a Warlock or a Priest so a reliable counter against fear became more valuable for a Warlock.
---
&gt;joined the horde
---
"An alliance of convenience," as it were. The race intros are pretty sweet.
---
Neither is teabagging and corpsecamping him =)
---
This is a really fair point! I just think that a very big strength of bear tank is the ability to switch it up on demand, and HotW has less of that because of your healing obligations.
---
You can't detect actual simulation lag from the client.  It doesn't work like that.  You could simply be looking at network latency effects.  When you write an MMO simulation backend, one of the first things you're going to do is attach a couple tens of thousands of headless clients to it doing automated shit and look for any "slow ticks" where it takes longer on the server side to process a game tick than actual real clock time.  These servers typically have 30ms tick intervals (on that order).  So in order to get actual server lag, the server has to get in a state where it can't update the simulation from one tick to the next in under 30ms.  And while pushing network packets can be one of the most costly performance bottlenecks on the server end, this isn't something that you can have happen with any regularity inside the simulation, because the whole thing doesn't work when you're behind on every tick, and getting further behind.  In that scenario the server would be designed to just start unceremoniously disconnecting connected clients.
---
So, it's not server lag.  It's a combination of client lag and network latency.
---
This is just something that is commonly misunderstood, with all these games.
---
Yeah back in vanilla I clicked most of my spells üòÇ
---
No little Payo OFC
---
I would prefer RP-PvP, but until (if) that happens I'm planning to main RP-PvE, and later roll an alt on a PvP. wish I could do both on one server tho.
---
inb4 just RP on a "normal" PvP server, no, it's not the same at all.
---
Any rank of kick other than rank 1 is useless, max rank kick does 70dmg
---
Pffft, when Classic launches I totally intend to binge WoW like my state binge drinks.
---
It be fun. But that not mean it is good. You will die much times to other classes.
---
These are all bannable when there's a public witch hunt against a group of players.   
---
Blacklists are stupid - but they're going to happen, you can't stop them. The thing is, you're literally making yourself known and giving your intentions of GRIEFING (which is specifically against the EULA and is taken on a case by case basis) clear.   
---
Corpse camping someone over and over is one thing. Corpse camping someone because of a specific reason out of malice is another. These things will be taken into account.   
---
I'm not condoning the Streamer Blacklist that they currently have set up - unless it's directly related to those who are complete spergs who always want to feed off of attention from streamers. That I'm okay with. But you know there will be a shitty situation where someone doesn't care about a streamer, corpse camp him because he'd do that to anyone, then gets blacklisted.  
---
No one can stop you from blacklisting in a social game. But you giving legitimate proof of your intentions to personally grief a certain % of the playerbase out of malice is certainly bannable. You're not entitled just like streamers are not.
---
tossing salads since '05 how is this man stilla live
---
I have, now. But I also use a lot of different devices.
---
p server
---
Nope.  Also, there's no way to enforce the rule or prove you were unless you said so, or showed yourself doing it and self incriminated.
---
Stream sniping is allowed by Blizzard ToS.
---
I took rat poison for years to treat a blood clot condition :)
---
dont you remember stuff like this?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hwgMUa56Ig
---
Swifty actually does, uses Orbweaver I think.
---
I'll allow it
---
Level as feral! Feral druid is one of the faster leveling specs in the game - probably not as fast as pet classes or a good AoE grinding mage, but my leveling experience on a pserver hasnt been painful at all if you compare it to warriors, rogues, etc.
---
I don't plan to raid in classic so being stuck as resto won't be a problem. Raiding and m+ in retail is a lot more appealing to me due to its higher skill cap, plus being raid ready for vanilla is grindy as fuck with all the consumables you have to farm.
---
I will roll a Warrior in Classic, on a PvP realm, just like I did back in Vanilla.
---
I know exactly what is coming my way, but it will well worth it. I remember being ganked, A LOT. Grefing, not really. I was corpse camped after being killed once, than I got killed 2-3 more times. And than they stopped, because I was on non-combat mode and they got bored.
---
This was my response to ganking and corpse camping while leveling, and quite a lot of time after being 60.
---
BUT...at some point, got my self decked in PvP/T2 gear.
---
No need to tell that a lot changed from that point on.
---
Warrior threat scales linearly as their damage output increases, Bear threat is caluculated so that it scales exponentially, even without MCP a Bear will leave a warriors threat in the dust. 
---
Since 2005, people have figured out more optimal way to build a feral tank so that it won't get squished. You still don't get def capped, but stacking armor and hp means that crushing blows don't really hurt that bad. Most warriors on most fights don't run full def cap nowadays anyways, they (ironically) run a threat set for quite a bit of raiding, built to let them get hit harder and therefore output more threat via ragedump.
---
I took 2 weekas off as I've no other plans this year, also release is 11pm for UK so 50% of potential players will be asleep in bed
---
Bless you
---
Lmao dude NO ONE IS GOING TO KEEP THEIR BETA CHARACTERS. NO ONE. 
---
I can‚Äôt believe this gets brought up so often.
---
No One has ever kept beta characters in any beta, ever , Jesus Christ people get annoying
---
You can get Eye of Shadow farming demons in Winterspring. You don‚Äôt have to get it from Kazzak. Eye of Divinity is from Molten Core, an instanced raid zone. 
---
Stop being so obsessed with the game that you won‚Äôt be able to play for another two and a half months. Your negativity is really going to ruin your experience. You should find something more productive than just raging about streamers who get paid money to do something you dream of doing. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
---
OMG I heard a rumor about a Streamer and now i have to complain on the forums.
---
Even if there is a "coalition," (really cute of them using little labels like that) it won't last. This addon and these dumbasses won't be relevant a month after release. It'll fall apart. This is just a group of bored man-children looking to direct their rage at something. They'll move on to something else really fast, I guarentee it.
---
Besides, they'll be so horrifically outnumbered by "streamer armies" and people who legitimately don't even know they exist, that they won't be relevant.
---
1h + off hand has significantly superior stats for holy paladin at all points in progression.
---
This [meme](https://i.redd.it/mlbep5i1d4z01.jpg) is pretty accurate for what paladins look like while raiding in optimal gear, until you get to Naxx and T3 plate set becomes BiS.
---
Alright man I  appreciate the feedback!
---
Did you even read the launch post. Game releases at same time for EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. You do realise that the world operates at individual time zoens XD
---
Beastslayer enchants give a red glow. Also although most people weren't minmaxing back in the day, casters in naxx wouldn't be running beast slayer xD
---
Youre 17, you have your whole life ahead of you. Playing WoW will cost you at least one girlfriend, one best friend, mess up your sleep schedule, and set you up to ignore your life for possibly years. No, you shouldn't play ha.
---
What happened with #NoChanges?
---
the time format choice is sloppy, but it's not going to make much of a difference at all unless you're at small values.  At 10 seconds, the error is at most a 4%.
---
&gt; they are able to keep their beta characters once the servers go live.
---
Who in the fucc said this, its delusional, crazy. Some comment on a post that didnt even reach hot?  
---
Then again; If the, what, top 20 streamers kept their characters they would end up in an empty world where they cant raid, cant queue BGs... Can't live in the rush that is launch. Nobody wants that.  
---
TL:DR; Its bullshit, dont spend another breath of oxygen on it.
---
Yeah I don't quite understand what you're saying so I'm going to assume you know more about this than I do. 
---
When I hear "client lag" to me that signifies things that aren't server/network related like framerate loss, but maybe that's a more layperson interpretation of the term than you're using?
---
I have a couple questions: 
---
Do you have a simple explanation of the differences between server lag, client lag, and network latency? 
---
And, do you know why modern WoW tends to fall victim to server/network/client lag (I'm not sure what the correct term is, I'm referring to when the game essentially pauses, everyone is stuck running in place, and the game jumps forward a bit every few seconds) while 1.12.1 private servers don't have this problem, and whether it's fixable? What benefit is Blizzard getting at the expense of a much less stable gaming experience?
---
Now, now...EvE is something else.
---
But, yeah...red is dead.
---
Already bending to public criticism and pressure? This totally isn't going to collapse in a month lol.
---
But blizz can ban the addon, ya?
---
TIL
---
Nature's Swiftness + Healing Touch
---
Hahaha, I had a soul keeper staff with unholy enchant on my lock before I joined a raiding guild just for the looks lol, but I was also wanding when I ran out because the healers in the casual guild I leveled in said ‚Äúlifetapping is bad mkay‚Äù
---
good ones, thank you
---
You're spamming shit no one cares about.
---
Stream man bad
---
It was a weird time. First thing I thought when I saw it on my photobucket was "WHY?!".
---
ty
---
Depends how much time you are going to get ganked.
---
Being killed 4-5 times in a row, by a corpse camper is NOT griefing. Do it like 8-10 times or more, yes, it is griefing.
---
But it's not a hard line on where griefing starts. Report it, and see the answer. And you will know where the griefing starts, depending on GM answer.
---
Well fuck.
---
Hey, it's your choice to get back on the beginning of a train that you know exactly where it's going to.
---
Gnome/Dwarf
---
Orc/Troll
---
Tauren
---
Human
---
Nightelf

Undead
---
I don't see how tournaments are related to leveling from 1-60 in Classic WoW... However, competing at a high level in any sport or e-sport requires taking care of yourself and staying sharp.
---
Thanks!
---
Nothing wrong with skipping showers when you're at home.
---
Olaf shield is only for horse because the dwarves are friendly to alliance in uldaman
---
Same with the helmet with the stun from the other one
---
The Crossroads is under attack!
---
Well if you don't mind losing some bag space, you could always keep scrolls you find and buff random passersby.
---
Unacceptable. He is a stream man and this subreddit cannot allow stream man‚Äôs existence to continue.
---
OOh Yes dude and we will streamer the hunt to streamers to all see why we are so high!
---
I heard that its pretty much just Friends/Family invites going out lately, I imagine each time they increase the cap/add more content they will let more people in or if the pop drops a bit they might add more.
---
So yeah chances of getting in now are pretty much none-existent
---
Yes I smashed this on repeat in the background laughing my ass off for years from vanilla to LK the song is so good.
---
"You look good in high res" hahaha
---
&gt; Are they making changes to Classic from vanilla? 
---
Technically, yes - Classic is 1.12 at the very beginning, unlike vanilla. Druid tank is only viable after 1.8 talent rework, which is the green dragons patch, by that time most guilds don't really bother to gear a druid tank.
---
Druid has excellent threat for single target or 2-3 targets, and is excellent for bosses that need you to fight for threat. Survivability issues, and unable to wear TF or such, and its ability to turn into cat DPS/dispel bot on the spot means generally using Druid as a main tank isn't optimal or using it to the fullest, so Druid usually come as an offtank.
---
You get one with the special edition
---
Wait, this isn't official? Looks amazing.
---
That happened in 2004.
---
I know he plans on raiding with Sonidigitals guild. Soni mentioned it on stream the other day
---
Justin Bieber does suck tho
---
50 streamer fanboys don't need a "blatant tos violation" to RCR me and trigger a disconnect &amp; squelch.  They just need a slight to the streamer, real or imagined.
---
Your line of thinking is 100% correct but this subreddit won‚Äôt allow logic to discredit their stream man hate.
---
True lol
---
Lol thanks for the video - like the whole "I'm not the same nice person as on YouTube/twitch"
---
If someone is dumb enough to look at that guy and listen to him speak for 5 seconds and not understand he's an asshole... idk what to say.
---
Home btw ;) lol, thanks again!
---
This post needs more upvotes:D
---
Yeah, streamers should put their stream on delay.
---
Ah man Necro-Knights garb. I so wanted that robe back in the day but never got it on my Lock!
---
Rep the thing you love, no matter the condition.
---
&gt; which Class will have it easier to get into dungeons and raids. 
---
Based on my pserver experience, raiding guilds are quite often looking for Warlocks when they advertise themselves in chat. I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing a guild looking for more Rogues (or Mages or Warriors)
---
&gt; Which class is better for Solo play. 
---
Warlock is better at killing multiple things, Rogue has stealth and better mobility. It‚Äôs really a matter of preference, both are quite good.
---
&gt; Will there rly be this much rogues this Time? In starting Zones on private Servers i saw much more shamans for example
---
Most likely yes, however according to some surveys a lot of people are planning to roll Warlock this time. However those surveys didn‚Äôt account for the ‚Äúcasuals‚Äù who don‚Äôt frequent forums months before the release of the game, and I assume most of them will lean towards the more popular classes on retail.
---
The majority of the Shamans in the starter zones won‚Äôt make it to 60 in my experience.
---
Right now, there are more posts complaining about posts about streamers than there are posts about streamers. 
---
Can I complain about people complaining about posts about streamers?
---
I'm not saying this is a good or bad idea, and I have no personal opinion on whether the site should exist. However, I would just suggest to OP that he or she carefully should read all of Blizzard's Terms of Service and other game-related policy disclosures and make sure this isn't violating any of them. Because it feels like its skimming uncomfortably close to naming and shaming or "harassment" of other players.
---
I'm not going to speculate on how Blizzard will read its policy and whether they will conclude that this website is a problem, but if they do have a problem with it, and if Blizzard associates OP's game account with the website or the OP of this thread, then it's possible that consequences like a game ban could result.
---
Again, not saying that is going to happen, but OP should take some time, and, depending how much they care, may want to contact Blizzard through some appropriate channel and ask if they have any problem with the site before it becomes high profile or widely used and gets talked about a lot. (Certainly, once they're aware of it, major streamers are going to talk about this, and if any of them has a problem with it, you can be sure they're going to be poking people they know at Blizzard with sharp sticks and asking them to "do something" about it.)
---
I had a dwarf priest in vanilla. He looked fucking horrendous the whole time I played him. Never playing dwarf again.
---
Guess the pve players are safe at least!
---
It's easier on my eyes, but, obviously, it works the GPU more
---
Yes, it's smoother. The closer to real life you get, the better. Depending on person, age and eyes, research show us that IF we where to set an FPS number on our vision, it would be up to 500.
---
It's just like a speed potion it doesn't last long enough and is too expensive
---
If layering has the potential to last all of phase 1 and layering will last a max of 3 months...what is the max phase 1 can last?
---
Hint: 3 months
---
Go gnome or go home.
---
I've only main'd gnomes for a decade haha. Noggenfoggers make PVP godly.
---
This was Thaddius hidden mehanic, to dc your mt if he was a pleb.
---
already put in for my vacation starting on the 27th lol
---
Far beyond that.
---
I'm surprised there's not more outrage over this. I guess if you wanted to kill your browser this is a good way to do it.
---
Probably not, iirc they didn't do this in 1.8 also when RP-PVP was launched in Vanilla. 
---
I don't feel they should do it also, it should be a fresh experience for everyone, with everyone starting on equal footing.
---
The amount of times I've been repeatedly ganked, and it doesn't bother me, it's part of pvp
---
Did someone say
---
what's that, mpc-hc? What's the point?
---
I want a frickin standing desk for this game. Too excited!!
---
He keeps spouting off "nothing we are doing is against the ToU like it's some fucking holy document that can't be changed in a day by blizzard once they realise this new group of mouth breathers have founds new and interesting ways to be toxic.
---
Who are blizzard gonna support - the people they actual invite to events, fly half way around the world to test and review their products and have millions of fans, of this dickwad with an add-on and a serious stick down his Japs eye about streamers and a worrying Hitler complex.
---
"We will enforce compliance"
---
Is all you have to know about this shitstains agenda to know who's side your best being on.
---
I'll say it again. Blizzard write the ToU, they can change it at will and what's more they can ban you for absolutely any fucking reason, wether it's in the ToU or not - there is no court to appeal to, no higher power to overrule them.
---
Why, do they spread it? Sounds like just pure racism otherwise.
---
You can‚Äôt seriously read these threads and say it‚Äôs not hate with a straight face. This subreddit has been complete cringe trash about the existence of streamers for weeks.
---
I had totally forgotten about him LMAO
---
r/SuddenlyPrincessBride

When WoW came out I ordered a couple cases of Jolt and Bawls from ThinkGeek.
---
I have to watch my sugar and carbs now, so I'm going to get a couple cases of Monster Zero Ultra.
---
Popping sips with the boys!
---
Following directions. My man.
---
Updated the site. Thanks!
---
Maybe he just built a lot of resistance? Not sure what he means by "just a video game".
---
I would expect an announcement of some sort in a week.  Thats when the subs of all the people who signed up in May will be expiring.  Blizzard will throw them some kind of cookie to entice them to resub for another month.
---
This is just beautiful. Thanks!!
---
Is 1/13/31+6 flagcarrier a good spec that works in all three BGs (FC in WSG, just heal in AB and AV)?
---
Is 1/29/21 Feral + NS or 29/11/11 balance (scale better at AQ/NAXX stage) good as well?
---
He plays horde, no holy paladin stealing his weapons!
---
Jea maybe its a bet you can make on privat server alot of ppl had aq40 gear.
---
No, I don't think I will
---
3000ppl 15ish streamers. Just because all you can view are streamers doesnt mean there are no non streamers. Its barly 1% streamers.
---
Not as good as a FC in WSG specifically, but both specs you listed work well in BGs and open PvP. The balance-focused spec functions better when you're relatively well geared in my experience, but both are fun to play.
---
I dont see any video which promotes druid tanking from him. The only video he posted related prot versus druid is very negative towards bear tanks.
---
Thanks edited and which helmet?
---
That`s the most ridiculous thing i've heard in awhile, and I just got off work!
---
Isnt that the staff of dominance from mc before the visual overhaul ?
---
Duo = less exp per mob but faster killing. 
---
Duo = faster questing (for kill quests) and longer questing for pick up quests (you don't share quest items)
---
Playing with friends &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Exp efficiency.
---
Someone recommended Payo. I updated the site! As admitted, I don't know all the streamers :)
---
That script won't work. Macros won't work how they work on private servers. Will be very limited in function.
---
This is the danger of using beta data
---
It‚Äôs less xp per kill if your you do it duo. 
---
If you are trying to speed level it then run solo. 
---
But I would enjoy it and play with someone if you have the option. It‚Äôs a long grind to 60 and it helps to have people to bullshit with while leveling.
---
I posted this above:
---
&gt; You can set up a blacklist filter in BTTV.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Install Better Twitch TV and "Set Blacklist Keywords" in the options gear.
---
You should go gun, and let the xbow to NE hunters ;-)
---
Only if you use OSHA grade 3 electrical tape to affix said sock to one's anus
---
The community will, just like it did in 2005. If anyone on your server was being a piece of shit he essentially got shunned and wasn't able to participate in any meaningful content.
---
The ability for the community to self police was one of the great strengths of the game.
---
People who know their stuff use Firefox anyways.
---
There was a ton of outrage the first time they announced it, so Google backtracked on it. 
---
Cut forward a couple months and they quietly announced that they are in fact going to go ahead with the change.
---
It's a techno-neckbeards attempt a segregation and it will fail. I'd be impressed if these fucks even attempt this now when they can't even get support for this idea in the very place where you would expect it to be heralded as a fantastic idea.
---
No wonder they won't announce who this "coalition" is - cause now they see how fucking aids this idea is you won't see any activity on this account again.
---
This pro tip was given me when i was around 17 and thought of start playing when it came out. Needless to say i didn't follow that advice and what you warn about happened to me. Worth it? Maybe.
---
thanks man :)
---
Should have blurred out the damage meter. Now more people are going to want to roll rogues lol.
---
unsure how long we'll be EU dudes for tho...
---
9 rogues, bet that‚Äôs fun gear competition
---
It was actually against the tos to do what they're proposing, so no. You absolutely were not allowed to collude with the other faction.
---
I never knew much or cared about Sodapoppin until recently but he seems like a Grade A douche bag
---
EU master race
---
we just wanted to share our excitement with other fans of wow classic.
---
Depends the class you want to play, some classes synergize way more in duo than others. A hunter/druid would be better/faster solo but a priest/paladin and a warrior would made more xp in duo than solo.
---
The state of that collar shows the state of your hygiene.  Throw it out.
---
Thank god they're all NA except for 2, that'll make life easier.
---
How far was his toilet? Other side of town?
---
This is epic. Respects to private server veterans who have supported te vanilla scene for over a decade, and have pushed to see it live again.
---
Entitled streamers that come from retail and get into the beta think they can control the community, and push it around how they see fit. 
---
Honestly they are going to see what real World of Warcraft is all about pretty soon.  It‚Äôs a grind, it‚Äôs savage, and there are no free passes, those playing the beta are in wonderland right now haha.
---
There will be guilds a lot less serious than this one sprouting up everywhere too, just sayin.
---
Fair point. That's what playing retail for too long gets you!
---
Sadly the last we heard was no RPPVP servers will be in at launch.
---
When you're used to Chrome it's pretty fucking intuitive, so... But yeah, I'll have to consider switching. I'm gonna look into that.
---
This actually sounds like a really cool system. I bet it adds a lot of depth to DDO and keeps the replay value up as well. Definitely wouldn't work in WoW, but thanks for sharing!
---
Given the nocks and crannies is WSG where smaller model sizes are beneficial, might just do
---
In the room, like a standard house. He was mental.
---
You're doing Elune's work!
---
Wew fuck, imagine admitting you gave yourself diabetes.
---
That community is what made classic a reality. Don‚Äôt forget that.
---
That‚Äôs not at all how it worked though, that‚Äôs the nochanges crowd looking through rose tinted glasses. What really happened was people account shared against the TOS to have a ‚Äòguild bank‚Äô. It will most likely happen again, wonder if blizzard will ban this time?
---
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THAT WAS!?
---
Because they‚Äôre malicious zombie assholes
---
Putting Red Bull instead of Bawls?? You didnt play vanilla!
---
RP PvE Servers were a joke in 2005 and still are in 2019. How can you have real RP when the game world protects you from memorable interactions with the other faction.
---
I remember from Nostalrius that for some reasons i had to kill Defias NPCs there. I was probably doing it because of a quest, but I don't remember a quest.
---
Swifty was on either All Craft or Classic Cast podcast maybe 1 week ago discussing exactly why.
---
He was probably the most popular vanilla WoW streamer (at least that I can recall), and Blizzard was in direct contact with him ensuring he would not leave the server because if he left the entire server would die. He claims they even beefed up his server to handle large scale wPvP better to encourage him to stay.
---
Large streamers will dominate a server and likely cause faction imbalance. The economy will be all jacked, the queue times for logging on an BGs, wPvP, etc.
---
This won't happen instantly. But after maybe 3-6 months the server will ebb an flow based on a streamer (if they are large enough...asmon, soda and also streamer guilds like sonii's "classic" guild, esfand's guild, etc.
---
i don't think that would be considered fair. so i don't think they would. however i do think they would most likely do something
---
Forsens community might even be worse than asmongold's, and I say that as someone who enjoys both of them.
---
Is this what i can expect in Classic? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0XG-r-jZkk 
---
Then it is a hard choice I like female cast animation better, but male armor better. 
---
Goddamn, I finally settled for a class/race and now I have this problem.
---
Dab pen and tissues for when I choke up
---
Shadowpriest is a class that scales kinda bad, is hard to gear even in a best case for Shadow, like the guy before said, getting caster loot as Shadow can be insane hard. And you need Stamina against some classes.
---
Its like that, if you dont have the dmg loot "substain" classes will give you a hard time. For example if you dont have the spelldmg a pala or druid with a clue will just play you oom, or a Hunter with high stamina.
---
If you dont have Stamina Gear high burst classes will give you hard time. Example here would be a mage or rogue, or some warlock speccs that just Burst you down before you can even get a foodhold.
---
But the thing with Shadowpriest is you will smash bad players if your gear is only nearly geared. But even with the same gear , if the player has a clue how to play against shadow it can get rly nasty, and for every pice that they outgear you it get easyier.
---
A Shadowpriest even in the best case gearing case gets outgeared after BWL content because the Stamina values just dont scale this well, and you need to facetank dmg somewhat as shadow, thats the main problem you run into.
---
And this only gos for UD Shadowpriest if you are not UD you will need way better more effort.  
---
While Warlock scales SUPER well with Gear even inf you only gear with pve your gear is soooo good for pvp cause it has alot of stamina.
---
And warlock has more tools to show skill, you can just do more, you have a pet that can despell and cs , you have a spammable fear, you have deathcoil, and with SL can be VERY tanky more then a shadowpriest in some cases.
---
I allways say shadowpriest is a class for noobs to kill noobs, your toolkit kinda feels limited, and every mistake your opponet makes get punished hard cause you leech for every dmg you do, so if your opponent is bad and dos not "onehit" you it feels super unbeatable sometimes for them because they give you so mutch time to fight back.
---
In getting enough moderation waiting for it to release.  Also, sadly I only had 8 days if vacation to spend.
---
Watching YouTube videos then looking at the comment section showed me that audiences can be completely different than the entertainer
---
If you want to PvP you can rule out shadow priest already.
---
No premade will take you, raids prefer healing priests specced into shadow weaving, so no gear for you.
---
Shadowpriest is a 1v1 onetrick losing horribly to reflector (beats warriors tho since shield and all, typical priest) and oom after fighting one person.
---
Warlock on the other hand, raids will kill to have you so you get gear, you scale hard with gear. Come AQ40 warlocks are so strong PvP will be ruined/dead because of how overpowered they are. Only turboautists will continue to pvp then.

whats wrong with you OP
---
Vanilla at 15,000 roentgen
---
Also for stabbing the Alliance in the back, never forget Garithos did nothing wrong
---
hmm. I work full time already and I can't sit and play a videogame for more than like 5 hours at a time. seems like a way to not spend my nights on reddit and yt. I could prob get my mates I talk to on discord to play too which would be fun. I think id put my gf before playing (if I even get a gf lol) too, I value time with people more than anything else. I might just be making excuses but idk. thanks tho &lt;3
---
I played a rogue and honestly their PVE rotation isn‚Äôt that much more exciting than a mage. You‚Äôre mostly just slice n dicing auto attacks. 
---
However there‚Äôs a much bigger preference for mages for dungeons if that‚Äôs something you care about. 
---
Both are absolutely amazing choices for pvp.
---
alright noted. bless
---
There have been many posts dedicated to this. It's also in [the wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/discords)

Dwarves get bonuses to guns, but there aren't too many endgame guns. In the end though, it's personal preference

idk if my microwave sucks or I'm doing it wrong or what but sometimes half the Hot Pocket is scalding hot and the other half is still partly frozen

See, I only got to play galaxies for about 1 week because our computer and internet couldn‚Äôt handle it.
---
But that small time was amazing and I tried so hard to play it before NGE came out, but I never got to.
---
The design elements that made that game special however are similar to classic wow.
---
Did a GM say that in Vanilla? Because I doubt it. I remember towns being camped for hours. I remember camping and being camped for hours. They do not care if its a pvp server.

Shadowmeld itself requires you to stand still, but it also adds to the difficulty of being detected when using Stealth (which is not dependent on movement at all).
---
I've never been into a videogame 100% other than maybe Minecraft when I was younger lol. I'm pretty excited now :)
---
This is true. It‚Äôs like meeting someone that hasn‚Äôt watched Star Wars or read Lord of the Rings. You envy their ability to go back and experience for the first time again.

I managed to get 4/9 Tier 3 on my rogue, and we had gear competition from the Warriors too.

But we decided we weren't gearing for 4h anyway.

Had to look that one up, could be. They look exactly the same to me though, maybe OP remembers which staff he had.

From a lore perspective and from a clobbering dudes with Windfury weapon perspective, it's the Shaman.

Please elaborate
---
I prefer being able to end a fight on my own terms to being able to start it, so from those two I‚Äôd choose Mage.

I really enjoy his videos. Loved the ones on which race to pick, helped me figure out what I want to play.
---
Nothing wrong with that--I've just seen too many people get discouraged from doing so when they want to start doing it really early and I like to chime in when that happens.
---
You do, watching those sugars and carbs aren't you chunki...
---
And no, I'm just still waiting for you to answer a single question, I enjoyed how easily triggered you were, so ima keep that entertainment going.
---
Feral has top priority, BiS for tanking and good for pvp.
---
Then warriors to use it for 2h fury or pvp.
---
Then no one because you won't get enough eyes to drop.
---
In Alliance raiding if you aren't playing a Dwarf Priest, Gnome Mage or Human Warrior, the all-seeing/all-knowing BiSnazis get streesed and rant.  So everyone roll any other race/class combo just to give them all seizures.
---
Did Ghost come back?
---
I took me over a year to hit 60, my goal was def to play, not to grind. We except the sub 60 AVs, I would grind those all day.
---
Same here, lost all BC, WOTLK screenshots. Gladly I have most if not all from vanilla still stored.

Right

Yes.  They do it literally for this kind of thing lmao.

Enjoy your ban from /r/classicwow, I guess?

That's the most mage line warlock I've seen.  Looks cool though

Ah yes, [change.org](https://change.org), the totally useful thing that Blizzard will legally have to obey once this reaches 100 votes!

I thought it had more to do with Sylvanis breaking free, and she was powerful enough to help us break free as well?
---
Haha pron

Bawls.  That's a throwback to the mid 2000's right there!!
---
The best thing is that this was their best shot at getting support and look at the response.

Oh and what's next for your 3 day old account.
---
You've already been called out for racism, misogyny, homophobia and denying the holocaust.
---
You pathetic fuck.
---
You can bet on most ppl  on your server having bad gear since they wont be able to clear aq40.
---
And hoping that privat servers are more hardcore.
---
Then Shadowpriest can be a very fun class, cause until end bwl its very strong, typical i made rank 10 /mc stuff and offset things i could get and quit the game around the aq40 release, cause i couldnt keep up with the gear.
---
Damn.  I‚Äôm cool with doing my own RP
---
&gt;So lots of Roleplay possibilities really.

"My past? Back in the days I was a serial killer. I made a mistake and they hanged me right there outside of Lordearon. When I came back a few days later, I killed and ate the mob that judged and killed me, at least the ones still alive. The old days were a lot of fun, weren't they? \*sniffles\* I miss having a nose. Do you know that feeling of an itchy nose? Mine fell off last year and I can not scratch it anymore, but the itch is still there. Damn, it was a really nice nose!"

Sounds like you really had fun! I hope you get that Gurubashi chest this time, good luck.

Remember g33k b33r?  Bawls root beer.  Absolutely delicious.

Oh I did reply to that conversation, you ghosted it after I pointed out for the 3rd time you wrongly interpreted what I said.

I wish there were bigger undead characters in the lore that don't follow Arthas or Slyvanas, not too big on lore so someone correct me if there is

---
Just the Steelsnap and Frostmaw quest chain.  I always liked doing that and it's recommended by Joana in his leveling guide.  TBH, I thought it was longer, but the two quests are still pretty good and it gives you a leather head piece.
---
Jumping on the bank roof.
---
oh I finally got it one time thanks to the help of some random stranger who killed everyone for me!  But no lie, I spent months, twice a day, trying to get that thing. It was just difficult when you are level 20-something and others are max level.
---
I will still play with them. Be in discord etc. But I want to know what will benefit me more. We won't be the same race, but we will always be running instances together. :)

there's no way you're serious. even if you are though, this is an ez way to get yourself banned by attempting to kill blizzards free advertising
---
at the very best blizz will just break the functionality of the addon, at the worst you'll get banned for inciting cross faction collusion and a toxic culture within specific realms
---
i'm sure a huge chunk of the streamers are going to be rolling on a singular server so they can have their own reality tv show anyway. attempting to get every streamer to re-roll will result in a massive pushback from their own personal armies
---
Don't share quest items at all?? Damn. But escort quests are shared right?
---
You dont "need" anyone. I can guarantee youd find someone just as capable to help run the guild given time. Making people seem important is that makes then think they can do as they please. Simply roll alliance, make an announcement of "we are going alliance,its been set" and it's up to him if he doesnt want to be a part of it.
---
GOD BLESS YOU, was looking forward to such website, thank you kind sir!
---
Even if you succeed, there is a chance a lot of people will get bored of the Alliance quickly. Just let the guy have his mudhuts.

UD male is iconic, especially with the spiky hair lol

Gotta climb "that" mountain to get to the wailing caverns.

Well either I will play warrior in a group, or mage solo. I will have fun either way, and chat with them in discord.

But is the mob exp halved in duo?

Imagine not giving a shit about drinking some highly sugared beverage when you're a teenager.  Fast forward 15 years later, oh wow.  My body can't metabolize all of that useless sugar anymore, I know better now, I should find something that won't ruin myself..
---
I just fail to see what said blacklist would even do? Any guild I‚Äôm in would find it hilarious that I annoyed a streamer so bad that they put me on a black list. 
---
You think normal ppl playing the game are gonna be like ‚Äúhey this guy killed soda, don‚Äôt invite him.‚Äù I highly doubt it, if anything it‚Äôll be a blacklist from the streamer viewer mc runs or somthing like that.

---
The mods must have removed your comment for your series of personal attacks, friend.
---
Maybe re-consider how you engage with others on the Internet.
---
Probably also worth pointing out that the combined Finkles Skinner and Zulian Slicer with the enchant to gloves is basically required to get the hide of the beast in UBRS, I don't believe it's impossible to get without all 3 but the higher your skinning the better the drop chance (Unless my memory is off)
---
So are you saying that the overall speed of earning exp (quests and from mobs) is faster by running it solo? I know my way around Azeroth, but I don't remember how the exp scales :)
---
Those were the best days of my life
---
Kill xp is less than solo. But I‚Äôm a group you‚Äôll also have 1 more person to tag mobs and can complete quest faster in a group.
---
Leveling with another person also provides other benefits that affect leveling time that are harder to account for such as-
---
Less deaths- especially if one person can heal.
---
Less ganks- having a second person makes you less of a target.
---
More gear- the more mobs you kill they greater chance to get some useful items to drop.
---
Elite quests- most become a breeze with 2 people.
---
Dungeons- I found it much faster to get a group together if you start with two people rather than 1.
---
Professions- you can get professions that help each other out such as alchemy for potions or leather-working for armor kits.
---
None of these directly transfer to exp per say but they will all increase your kill speed and lower down time.
---
Killing someone on a pvp realm isn‚Äôt griefing. It‚Äôs part of the game. I fully intend to hunt alliance that are in my questing Zone. Fuck them, that‚Äôs our ore, our herbs, our quest mobs. 
---
If it‚Äôs red it‚Äôs dead.
---
Alliance gets Paladins, which are the sole reason Alliance wins more premades than not.
---
Yes I also remember it as mount-free zone. Unfortunately, as we are not watching from the taurens perspective, he could've dismounted manually so not much proof. 
---
I had similar difficulties finding video evidence of the booty bay issue. I was looking at Joana footage but the only time he has a mount and goes into the city, he just runs there from the graveyard after spirit ressing. I thought that was still a pretty good indicator when he doesn't even bother mounting.
---
A large thing I noticed going Ally to Horde was Ally has no FP to STV. You‚Äôll fly to raven hill and run down. To get ZG buff you fly to west fall and go to the coast and swim along the coast. Grom Gul is a huge bonus for Horde. Biggest one I‚Äôve noticed
---
Misanthropes. Sociopaths. Hockey fans.  You know, those sorts.
---
It‚Äôs not just that...he is promoting cross faction collusion.
---
This is correct, Sylvanas took control of a large portion of Arthas' undead minions when he was weakened by the deterioration of the frozen throne. He was actually still in Lordaeron when she did it too. She managed to give some of the dead back their free will/memories/personality, and those are the playable forsaken.

A lot of people want it to stay classic forever, or having new content for classic.

Yes, but you have a group bonus but i don't recall how much (around 5 to 10%).

Not all of us know this dont be a dick

When is it okay? All the time.
---
Yep :)
---
The community won't. A single streamer will. I can already imagine soda or asmon gank someone and fail embarrassingly and then attempt to blacklist that person.
---
I guess opinions on this are different.
---
For me, it's simply horde vs alliance and I'm going for everyone who isn't infight and more than 1 level under mine.
---
Oh, hundo-p I log into my old main just for shizzles and gizzles.

Yes. The Directed Spell Ready and Omni Spell Ready play while the cast bar winds up, then finish with the Cast. There are three (I think) haircuts that have movement, pretty sure theyre all braids. The unbraided ponytail does not.

Someone should make a streamer ganking guild called "The Homewreckers".
---
- You won‚Äôt have to set your HS to Kargath during the early raid phases.
---
- Travelling between continents is way messier as Zeppelins are located more conveniently than boats.
---
- Horde has better access to lower level Dungeons imo and better rewards (if you are a caster).
---
- There is no clear equivalent to the Barrens so you might have to travel between more zones in the 10s and 20s, and there are a lot of quest chains with good rewards which also encourage this.
---
- Duskwood is a fantastic zone, don‚Äôt miss it.
---
I've been playing private servers on and off for about 4 years now.  There is not an overabundance of rogues nowadays like there was in true vanilla back in the day.  You might be fine.
---
He promoting the most toxic behaviour I've ever seen in a videogame - prevent others from playing together because they don't want to play with certain people. Adding people to ban lists because they refuse to download an add-on. Constantly greifing people because they are in the same guild as someone who broadcasts their gameplay. 
---
I don't want to play with streams, but I don't want his kind of attitude in the game at all.
---
since you have a mage only item, I suppose you could include the abyss shard which is a trinket allowing a warlock to summon a VW with no mana or soul shards.
---
The actual reason the scourge lost control over most of their minions in tristfal glades is because ner'zhul and arthas where weakened by illadan's Dalaran ritual

 /petattack macros are a must for Hunters/Warlocks. Bind it to all your openers. 
---
Any healing spec will want a /stopcasting, /cast [instant heal] macro for "oh shit" moments.
---
Warlocks need the felpuppy debuff purge macro.
---
Mages need mouseover decurse.
---
I don‚Äôt see enough boar love. Having that charge is an extra cc that keeps all melee off you.

But they turned this way because Alliance rejected them

For future reference you can preserve your graphic tees by washing them inside out to keep the graphic from fading.

If not given, community should pick a PvP realm and declare it RP PvP.
---
Woah thanks for taking your time and clearing a lot of things up for me. That made my decision!
---
They nerfed shadowmeld before the patch classic is based on.
---
Short, sweet, and productive. Thank you for this, hopefully once server names are announced we can start figuring this out.
---
What is the actual question here?
---
"Pvp being great"... compared to what?
---
It was and will be fun to those who enjoy pvp... there is no secret answer like "Back in the day as long as you had 7 rogues and 2 hunters you were unbeatable!"
---
Do you enjoy killing players in bgs? In the open world? If yes to both pvp should be fun for you.
---
Only other thing I can offer as far as your question goes is... there is no flying in classic, if you roll on a pvp server have an escape plan at all times.
---
WSG is trash get real boy
---
Asmongold never puts his chat in subonly mode though, soda does.
---
I don't think so. Raptors don't have dash, which makes fighting a tiny bit slower.
---
Extra armor only helps when fighting elites.
---
Go warlock.
---
i think mine is the worgen one
---
One thing I always loved about playing an Undead character was that your reputation with the other Horde races started at neutral, due to the fact that they had only recently joined the Horde and weren't really trusted.
---
Ah. Damn.
---
The launch trailer made me want to play like, every class so badly. The undead warlock looked SO badass. Ended up going with a druid though, loved how the nelf ran through the forest shifting into cat form
---
Choker is way too good for casters to give to a pally, its too rare and wont drop enough.  I guess in the aq patch, choker is obtainable.  Giving a choker to a pally will kill guilds during p2.  And the ring is pretty rare too.  If spelladin can deal dmg in blues until the beginning of bwl, thats ok, but u make it sound so much easier than reality.
---
It's more likely to be better, though. And that's the key.
---
People may be downvoting you, but you're correct. This sub is overreacting. I can guarantee you that you won't even notice the streamer being there unless you're in the same starting zone.
---
Pvp server, why is this question being asked?
---
There is literally zero time where it's not okay... oh you are in your big bad city? Get wrecked.
---
Remembered to make a target self, cast power word shield macro. Great oh shit button.

Lmfao, still haven't got any answer then, you really are the most pathetic dude I've ever come across on reddit

You should take your own advice, 'friend'. This is an extract of your comments, all in the last 24 hours :
---
&gt; "Your country is a third world shithole."
---
&gt; "You're a small brained shill."
---
&gt; "Your mom loves my member."
---
Dang
---
another approach, find another one, but roll on the same server your guildie plays horde. have him make a horde partner guild, you can organise some fun cross faction pvp guild events, play the neutral ah for the benefit of both guilds etc
---
thanks for posting this!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even wear that to sleep en. Jesus dude.

I don‚Äôt understand your logic. Speed leveling literally is being optimal. So that you lvl the most efficient way.

PSA: do NOT fall for low quality bait threads, report and move on
---
How? It's literally an article by Kotaku where the journalist talks about streamers in Classic.
---
&gt; still haven't got any answer then, 
---
I can't reply to a comment that was removed by the mods.
---
The most evil race by far is the night elves. You to learn your lore, son.
---
Not entirely accurate. Druids generate the most threat out of any of the classic tanks in 1.12. If a Druid is mechanically capable of tanking the fight (and there are a number they cannot), a Druid is the best choice for tank and spank. 
---
It was in TBC druids got some acknowledgement though many people did not realise they are superior for threat generation even then.
---
&gt;how to have a heart attack in 3 easy steps
---
Step 1. Unsub from this subreddit because a lot of people here are all about min/maxing and getting to 60 as fast as possible so it will just make you feel like shit when you are level 20 and there's a bunch of people here talking about just hitting 60. But the truth is those people will have taken like a week off work and played 18 hours a day the most efficient way. The vast majority of people will spend months getting to 60 playing at a reasonable pace. From what I've read it takes about 10 days of play time to git level 60. That's 240 hours... so even if you play 3 hours a day every day it will still take almost 3 months. So it's best to just take your time and enjoy the experience. 
---
Which leads to Step 2. Play whatever sounds fun. Don't worry about what class/race combination is technically the best at level 60, just pick what you think is the coolest. And if you get to level 20 and think that same other class you were just grouped up with looks more fun then start a new character and try that out, you can always go back to your first character if you don't like the new one.
---
Grand Apothecary Putress and his faction were loyal to Varimathras and the Burning Legion.
---
He was the main antagonist of the Wrathgate quest chain. There was a really cool event at the end of the quest chain where he and Varimathras took control of the Undercity and it was attacked by both the Alliance and the Horde.
---
It was unbalanced and fun. At least compared to now. Now healers are OP as fuck and a fps just cant kill a healer, while back in the day the needed way more protection than they do nowadays. Classes also were unique unlike today where everyone has an interrupt, everyone has self healing, everyone has big defensive cooldowns or straight up immunities. Basically you needed others to protect the weaknesses of your class, now you still have weaknesses but eh, everyone can do more or less fine on their own because everyone has a way to deal with pretty much anything.
---
lmao, a second stalker.
---
This guy is upset that he didn't understand how traffic merging works.
---
I agree that it's easier to switch between tank and dps with a feral build than it is between heal and tank with a hotw build, but it's still doable and useful in a lot of situation.
---
This all depend of the guild need.
---
You can have different ranks bound to the modifier combos of the same key. For example: your 2 key = rank 3 heal, shift 2 = rank 1 heal, ctrl 2 = max rank heal. If you use the same minimum and maximum modifier keys on all the spells, it‚Äôs easy to remember.
---
NO ONE CARES
---
^This 
---
Don‚Äôt skip Duskwood, it‚Äôll be crowded as hell but totally worth it.
---
They should do this and it gives you 6 months to justify the price.
---
I don't watch any streamers so I don't understand it so I won't get involved
---
I think he means warlock T2 set
---
Nyet. Refresh rate is monitor. Your GPU is outputting at whatever FPS constantly, the limitation is your monitor being able to update it.

---
This made me smile.
---
Miss that server :( I was just a random scrub in S&amp;Q INC but was still probably the most fun I've had in wow.
---
Whenever you feel like. 
---
For me it depends on the class I play. As a leveling Priest I usually just leave people alone as long as they don‚Äôt bother me or other Horde players, because I don‚Äôt really have the burst to kill them quickly or the mobility to chase them if they flee. 
---
When I leveled a Shaman I was way more eager to start bursting down people and try to introduce them to my axe.
---
And I assume I would be pretty trigger happy if I rolled a Hunter, especially after getting Bestial Wrath.
---
Wrong subreddit my friend. you may join the classichate CJ in r/wow
---
i see multiple people wearing t1 gloves in nax....thats a g kick
---
Low effort bait. reported.
---
It's about 8 hours, every day
---
I don't like PvP in particular, I just like the idea of having to move around in a world where your faction is at war with another, so it introduces an element of danger outside of the regular monsters and creatures. You never know when a rogue is sneaking up on you while you're going about your business.
---
no one, it's a waste of mats
---
You guys are really obsessed with these streamers, and it‚Äôs not all streamers, it‚Äôs like 2 of them. Smh, just play the game.
---
Ahh, that makes sense, thank you.
---
This is accurate your pre raid bis includes an off hand over a shield. Pallys are fairly easy to gear because they can wear any type of gear.
---
/wave
---
This isn‚Äôt a bait thread? I was asking if people would want something like this. You Redditors are so weird thinking everyone is baiting or a shill.
---
Theres no fp to Stv in vanilla? Not even to booty bay?
---
Whenever I feel like it.
---
servers that launched after 1.4 also had DM open, should we follow that logic for everything?
---
Whoops, yeah Booty Bay lol. That‚Äôs a brain fart. Still nothing at Rebel Camp is what is was getting at. Good catch lol
---
I was going to say Haha
---
Booty boy has go for both horde and ally. But horde has advantage with grom‚Äôgol tho
---
why don't i set my hearth to Kargath?  
---
Oof I just realized RFK and RFD are deep in Horde territory.
---
they should stick them all on 1 pvp server and let them have streamer wars. everyone wins~

All I see is that ALL your replies have been deleted...
---
And you still can't answer my question.
---
Why do you think it's more difficult for people to install egs than steam.
---
I thought about it, but then I know within PvE they won't excel till later on in the game. Not sure I want to wait that long.
---
Braking news: Beta delays for 2 weeks to fix mount animations
---
Stop shilling Nathan, and stop calling yourself a journalist.
---
Thanks, I shall consider it.
---
The fact that the outside world matters.
---
BGs were fun, but the true beauty of classic PvP, was world PvP. And despite some brainiacs not getting it, WPvP doesn't mean "southshore battles". It means that you could at any time, anywhere be attacked, that you had to fight for your right to farm, quest, or simply travel.
---
This ofc, is only possible in a game world that forces players to leave the safety of their hub cities, a game world that can neither be skipped nor circumvented in any way.
---
Classic was the ONLY time in WoW when this was true throughout the lifetime of the game.
---
&gt;eventually but when a majority are wiping in MC the hard core guilds will be opening the doors to AQ40.
---
You never played Vanilla.
---
Very few people know this, but you're actually supposed to flip it mid-way through the microwaving. Not sure if it's in the instructions or not, but it works to eliminate the uneven warming
---
Only going to play for 3 months? Go rogue.
---
Yea, only a 15 year old would be screwing in the water. That shit has some logistical challenges for sure.
---
Learn to double trap. With a little effort you can add to the cc your group is capable of in a dungeon, and it's very satisfying to pull off. Its one of those things that sets a good hunter apart from the rest.
---
Yeah, not quite the wording I would use for any solution to anything today.
---
I lol'd at "(colorized)" :)
---
As one that pays absolutely no attention to streamers whatsoever, I have to say I actually like the community made faction element that I see developing here.
---
This is extremely cool and something that I can‚Äôt ever picture happening in current WoW.  Hoping to see more organic community made ‚Äòcontent‚Äô like this in vanilla.  I know in retail vanilla I had my own personal kill on site list of Horde, and various players on the alliance that I would never group with or help.  Looking forward to more of this when Vanilla finally launches as it really adds to immersion and that you‚Äôre part of a real world with real friends, enemies, and people you just don‚Äôt care for.  A big part of what makes this game special to me for sure.
---
you are taking this way too seriously
---
I've played shadow back then and remember melting a lot of faces. Most of the time 1on1 was at least doable, sometimes even really easy. In rare cases I could even win in 1vs2. Once I had a rogue and a hunter at the same time - this memory is burned into my brain because it took very long, I've kited them around that water elemental lake in the plague lands.
---
Long story short, as long as I still had mana I didn't have a lot of issues.
---
Yea certanily many guilds out there with over 1k followers..../s

# The unbalanced balance of classes.
---
The balance cas based on a meta level, ie:
---
Plate kills leather but is weak against cloth; cloth kills plate but is weak against leather, etc.
---
# the endless possibilities provided by the lack of arenas / balancing
---
By that I mean that you could always find a way to exit combat and regen or restealth for example, or simply be able to manage something the de s hadn't thought about. That was mainly granted by the fact we didn't have 12 spells per class like current retail Wow.
---
# And finaly, world PvP
---
The fact that a 2v2 in western plaguelands could end up being 2 40-people raids getting it on in 20 minutes at anytime or close to it.
---
TLDR: This post is purely subjective and filled by nostalgia.
---
The first thing they did with their free will was betraying and slaughtering the human forces that were left, after they fought together to reclaim Lordaeron. The Forsaken were the ones to turn against the Alliance.
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
They just think it will take wow classic down the Diablo immortal route. Ignore them.
---
I always thought lock because of the imp hanging around.
---
this is nothing like it is on in game. people on private servers seem nice. in game expect to get camped from high level players. want to go to a dungeon? not when a group (of higher levels) want to also do it. you team will get camped until they get board or a higher level of your faction shows up and they run away. 1/30 of your pvp attackers will be about the same level as you and most of them will run away as they are not looking for a fair fight. they will aslo watch you and attack you after you fight a few mobs are are low on hp.
---
Yeah, the main thing is on PvP servers is you might have tribute buffs by the time you‚Äôre going for ZG buffs and you don‚Äôt want to run through Duskwood/STV to get your buff. Could get the raid killed or picked off and lose their buffs. West fall swim is safer
---
You can change specs whenever you want it just costs gold. As long as you dont change super frequently it isn't that expensive.
---
Yeah I mean I highly doubt that... they ported Old School Runescape to mobile and it‚Äôs still the same great game it was 15 years ago
---
you mean putting two traps in same spot?  
---
Nonetheless thanks for you imput
---
I am personaly most excited about world pvp. World PvP was amazing for several reasons:
---
1. No flying mounts - all the players on the groud meeting each other and killing each other.
---
2. World was alive - with no dungeon finder people actually had to travel to dungeons on foot. Lot of pvp on way there. And players actualy run around world and farmed gold and herbs, Azeroth was dangerous place. It's immersive AF.
---
3. Every class is unique - this might cause imbalance between classes, but it enhances pvp experience and there is no better feeling when you manage to kill geared mage as a warrior. Engineering trinkets, gadgeds and grenades actually matters and you have to use everything in your arsenal.
---
Wow, did you come on that conclusion on your own? Or did you need a mathematician to help you add 1 and 1 to get 2?
---
Whatever you say, but you're wrong.
---
Video would be alot better if you would break it into a few sections that focused on a particular topic better. You spent alot of time(if you are the creator of this) spit balling about caps, standing, working with other people ect which is fine and all, but you kept interrupting your explanation of the system to do so.
---
Explain a particular system in it's entirety, then talk about how it relates to the system and how you are going to interact with others. To many tangents.
---
Good Vid though.
---
Kargath is a Horde town, so there is no Alliance flight path there, but the most popular capital, IF is quite close to Blackrock Mountrain, unlike the Horde capitals.
---
WC, SFK and SM are also deep Horde territory.
---
Sure, I'm still waiting on your reply
---
Preach is all about WoW, the others are all about themselves.
---
If they don't implement classic to phones it's gonna be lame as fuck. How am I supposed to play it when my wife decides to give me a lesson and take off my computer while I have to take care of Tyrone's son..
---
Where is that top form even from?
---
I scheduled my vacation for that week. 
---
So if WoW classic gets delayed I'm going to be so disappointed.

---
I don't want to ride the hate train but coincidentally it always involves streamers. This is why streamer server will never be able to pull off things like these.
---
You are on reddit, its pretty safe to say no one has showered for days. We will see a week without showering when Classic hits.

I've played since 2005 and quit before the game started to suck but maybe my server was different but on my server only like 3 guilds were in end game content in vanilla. Don't hate because your too young and never got to truly experience vanilla.
---
The big items most people will point out: unkillable healers with insane output not ooming until 10 mins have passed(honestly dont know the state in bfa of this, maybe it changed) , 1001 cds that you need to kill anything or you do piss damage except for 1 or 2 classes and insane mobility destroyed pvp.. also clases extremelly focused on raiding and "rotations", that made them boring as hell to play.

Well played, sir. Well played.
---
Its been a looking time since I played wow at all, and obviously a long time since vanilla but I think it works like this:
---
You put your trap down before the pull. 
---
You pull the target you are assigned to cc into your trap. 
---
When the trap times out you lay a second trap onto your cc target to trap it a second time. If I remember right you need to feign death to do this as traps are only layable outside combat (it's been a long time, I might be wrong. I know it was easier to do in TBC)
---
This way you have trapped the same target twice and kept it cc d for a full minute, by which time your group will have killed the other priority targets and moved on to yours. 
---
I think that's right :) I'm going to have to relearn how to do it myself.
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve known the guy for like 15 years now, so I‚Äôll be sad to not play with him. These damn Brits are so stuck in their ways haha.

Thank you for your kind comment. I was going for all 3 of those. :) The plan is to continue to update this as time goes on. I hope to post this during release once all of the streamers settle into their sever.
---
Unfortunately not, you don't build a tolerance to rat poison / warfarin. Even patients who have been on it for years still go for weekly bloodwork because if they take a bit too much every day they'll bleed.

Yeah, I got a decent one with a little shaker ball in it from Amazon.  I still really need to yeet that motherfucker though.

But it's decent stuff at a better price per serving than traditional energy drinks, even with shipping.

Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator:
---
also does a conal aoe lightning attack, has a nice big radius
---
I preferred Agi back then as it buffer my crit and avoidance and armour.  
---
+114 str =&gt; 228 Ap
---
+114 agi =&gt;  114ap and 2% crit ~5%dodge 228 armour 
---
Normally you don‚Äôt get any hard choices.  
---
But according to my old doc. 
---
Bear: Armour &gt; Stam &gt; Agi &gt; Hit/Dodge &gt; Crit &gt; Str
---
Kitty: Hit &gt; Str &gt; Agility &gt; Crit &gt; AP
---
( stack hit to 9% then take what ever str/agi you find).  
---
Agi is better when you might need to OT Str is better in a prolonged fight due to higher dps.  That was my reason to why go agi over str.  
---
57 agi = 1% crit
---
20 agi =  1% dodge
---
1 agi = 2 armor 
---
1 agi = 1 ap
---
Do we know if there will even be a server that won't have a large streamer on Ally, horde, or both?  Seems server numbers may be limited and people might now have a choice, at least in US, but to play on a server with a streamer.
---
The streamer variable is the one thing that I feel could ruin my immersion back into the game.  We didn't have streamers back in 2004-2006.  Hopefully they won't be as big of a problem as some, including me, fear.
---
Forsen will quit fast. I guarantee it. He is variety streamer and he will not like the grind in Classic.
---
Become what you hate, makes sense.
---
Oh by the way, sodapoppin is the boy, he can do whatever he wants, including kiss your mom :)
---
Bro you think he's washed that thing?
---
That's how it's been reported, but like a lot of things, they got it so so so wrong
---
Name checks out tho,, eh? (Not yours, his lol)
---
You should definitely watch Payo then. He is much better than 95% of those in this list. Underrated as fuck.
---
Multiple non FF people in the sub have gotten an inc recently. Still chances are really small
---
It burn them
---
Uhh, The gigaflux reactivator certainly does shoot lightning in a conal aoe AND gives you a thorns.

Anybody have any idea when this is coming out?
---
This is hilarious. Good luck
---
Was more of a tip for everyone, I‚Äôm not here to judge others.
---
Ye me too! Cool, I played with S&amp;Q inc in some bg premades and ally city raids. That was very fun.. and i remember tamtoes bg tactics "keep it gangstah" :D In the endings of their PvP movie you can see my warlock (Quinto) in some clips.

Some of the mobs in that game needed for classic epics in some cases took 100 hour camps. If you managed to get a spawn and you were coincidentally taking a shot at the same time, I would say you'd just let it go.
---
Wow that's pretty sad
---
Oh gotchya I didn‚Äôt raid much in Cata and I certainly didn‚Äôt get to heroic end boss. And I didn‚Äôt start going back for mog runs until I could basically one shot him and never saw that phase I guess.
---
Drood
---
+15 agility is green
---
Still probably didn‚Äôt get those 3 yeti horns :/
---
Yeah, I feel like that was more than the entire population of my server when I played (started around BC launch). Never saw more than a few people in GA, and it was often completely empty.
---
Eating ass was trend back then, but with your dick not with your mouth
---
Using flasks to craft your baby for the extra bit. Looks like the wisdom one, a fine choice!
---
Yes. Agility considered the superior stats for Ferals. As a cat, critting with abilities that reward combo points give you an additional combo point. 
---
For Bears, you get dodge and crit which increases your rage generation and threat greatly. You are also getting 280 attackpower from Blessed Qiraji Warhammer and plenty from buffs.
---
If Agility is what you used back in the original Classic then you were part of the very minority that understood Feral itemization.
---
Just a point of correction. It's not 57 agi per crit. Only Hunters require an absurd amount of agi per crit because of how Agi also give 2 ranged attack power. For Ferals, 20 agility is all you require for 1% crit.
---
Yes, 2.0 was the felguard.

Still think that blizzard needs to lock streamers to one or two realms.

We have thought of this. He‚Äôs pretty stuck on having an alt with us and playing on a different server. I‚Äôd rather he have an alt so when he eventually gets bored of playing by himself he‚Äôll join us.

You are assuming that the problem will prove to be real. It may prove to not be one or a far less one than people think.

If it actually a real problem, then is the rime to look to solutions.
---
Priest is the best warrior's friend.
---
Dungeons and questing shaman is better by a huge margin, in raids the priest is superior. So I think shaman is the best. But on the other hand, warrior + druid has near to no downtime as the druid can do the kitty and saves mana to heal you both...
---
Priest for the drip üí¶üí¶

Beautiful

Yeah what this guy said. M.2 is just a form factor (physcial shape and size of the drive as well as connection type).  More important is the protocol or technology behind the manner in which your mobo interacts with the drive  -- nvme vs SATA.  To add one thing to this though, SATA Express &gt; SATA-III.  SATAe uses a PCI-e lane just like nvme, though it doesnt connect to the physcial pcie connector like your GPU does, for example.

---
Haha obv i did! what im saying is that it releases in the afternoon in the US, if they released it in the morning US time that way both US and also EU would be able to play at a decent time frame.
---
The people you are listening to are most likely talking about maxing out there character and pushing to the limits. Play druid and have fun doing it! Druids are very capable dps healers and even tanks as long as you have decent gear and know how to handle situations
---
Start with 8 debuff slots and then eventually migrate to 16.
---
They will be too preoccupied with layering and fixing authentication failures :)
---
But they're a bunch of tree hugging hippies they never did anything wrong /s
---
Blessing of Freedom and Kings are both pretty great.
---
it's simple are you an asshole? do you like grifing other players? then roll a pvp server. want fair pvp fights (as fair as gear/class allowed)? just play battlegrounds.
---
Sure thing! They even dropped blue gear if you had the luck and patience to kill it!
---
Oof, WC, SFK and SM.
---
What's the flight from IF look like? Into what zone?
---
Change.org is aggressive and unnecessary. Sure it's fine to state your concerns, but Blizzard has made it clear as to why they are doing it, and it makes sense.
---
If the community starts using aggressive tactics like this, Blizzard will be less likely to take Community feedback into consideration.
---
Blizzard has been very flexible with the development of Classic and the Community needs to be flexible in return. Unarmored mounts were removed in Vanilla, so technically it's "no changes" there's nothing to really argue.
---
alright, ill keep that in mind. ill prob have like 5 hours a day 5 days a week. many thanks :) :)

Fuck off.

Reading the replies has been great! Another one I am guilty of, instead of Illidan, I always say Illidian. LoL

This is just as important as keeping old toon models and animations. I hate the way all the new toon models run etc. I personally have not seen the new horse animations untill now, and i think it looks ridiculous.
---
Mine will be a troll shaman, in the undead areas
---
&gt;Why roll a Pally in the first place to play melee dps?
---
Some context. The highest recorded DPS in original Vanilla was done by Lilos, a gnome warrior at 1250 DPS. The theoretical ceiling for a Retpala is 1500'ish DPS. 
---
The simple answer as to why I wont be rolling another melee DPS is that hey, I dont like other melee DPS. I like Paladin. If I can get to spend an absurd amount of gold on consumables and actually do more than enough damage that I compete on the meters with other classes then thats my choice.
---
This idea that you can only raid if your guild has a perfect raid composition is absurd. It's a minmax mindset is NOT the norm. It's rather the exception. The absolute majority of guilds dont have the luxury of stacking 20 geared fury warriors for every raid and they will take what they can get. The far most important thing for a guild is to have players that keep showing up raid after raid, and if their class does 20% less DPS then that is second priority to having stable players on your roster.
---
If I were your friend, I‚Äôd roll a Hunter or a Warlock so I could level faster alone. Ironically Priest is also a pretty good choice for this.
---
As the most useless solo class, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt consider the ones who enable you to achieve anything your ‚Äúhealing bitches‚Äù.
---
&gt; This is accurate your pre raid bis includes an off hand over a shield. 
---
Pre-raid BiS is bunch of fucking flowers...
---
But I'm gonna get those flowers.
---
This is by far the funniest comment on Reddit I‚Äôve read in a long time.  Bravo.
---
we don't like people that think it would be a good idea to play a game like this on a mobile device, (whether it's technically possible or not) 
---
People would join dungeons on their stupid ipad, but then their boss calls or their company wifi fucks up or any of a thousand other things happen that causes them to leave.
---
Just play the game when you are 100% available and play it on a proper game machine.   
---
and if you think. 'hey I would never do that' ok have a cookie, we didn't mean you, we meant the bazillion others who would do it.
---
If it's actually game breaking to the point where you want to bring like 10 ret paladins to the raid then sure it should probably be fixed.
---
It seem like more of just a clever use of game mechanics that actually existed at the time. If paladins can just use it to do 'good' damage and it makes them actually viable I don't see a reason to remove it, as long as this is the way it works on their reference client.

TBC/Wrath were the only 2 expansions that felt like they were made with the original wow formula in mind.
---
And even then isn't a big deal, because you kite elites with wingclip and your pet is just a dot.
---
Good comment /s
---
All of method, but I forgot what server they‚Äôre on.
---
Anyone clipped that and sent it to him recently?
---
I don‚Äôt see why private server drop rates would have any influence over what Blizzard does. 
---
From everything we‚Äôve seen from them thus far I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason to believe that Blizzard won‚Äôt try to do whatever they can to keep the integrity of drop rates as close to what it was in Vanilla as possible. 
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong about YouTube, but what I think we also have to consider is that most of us that played back then had a whole lot more free time than we do today; careers, families, etc. So even with the massive amounts of guides out there, the majority of the Classic crowd (at least in my opinion) isn‚Äôt going to have the hours we once did to grind levels as well as grind mats.
---
This was a cool story.
---
Wasn‚Äôt necessarily saying internet friends are imaginary, just that this meme doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense.
---
I agree, this entire debate is just semantics. Almost every pet will work fine. I'm not even going for a 1.0 attack speed pet, and getting a 1.3 AS.
---
So far I've only seen clips of this guy being protected by those dudes.
---
So do you also believe that DrDisrespect is not just a character? How delusional are you?
---
No, no one but you in the whole world remembers
---
It's already been since October for me. Achievement  unlocked.
---
I was using one of the pixes bots and got banned. I was a member of the discord were all wow bots are and discussed. Everybody got hit with banwaves... then some of the bot devs came out with a "fix" of their bots and yet again everybody got banned as well. 
---
Most of the bots got closed and those who didnt, went private (I mean for the creators only and maybe some friends, so blizzard cant access the bot and study it).
---
Even if you see a bot, its gonna get banned in less than a week.
---
Of course the actual solution is to just not roll on a server a streamer does instead of whinging on reddit.

Night elf priest here i come, gotta get that dancing on bridge gold.

Yeah maybe getting addicted to meth isn't worth it. I'd love to be server first but not first in line to suck dick in a trailer park when the cash dries out.
---
I tried watching his channel for perspective on the duels an some of the wPvP. It was painful...
---
What do you mean? They seem to only kill people once then let them live, they killed him right before this
---
Not optimal mind. BiS would give you about 50+ plus healing but a lot less Int (and that's a 1h mace with an ofhand, meh) so you could use that 2h mace going into MC with very little objection in my opinion.

This worked on us when we were young.  We are adults now. I‚Äôm already collecting my stockpile of caffeine and snacks.

How many of these people will actually hit 60 and have gear/ know how to play? I think it might flip on it self where more people who are 60 and have gear hate the streamers and are in it to stream snipe than people who are actually attempting to fan boy play with them.
---
Where do I go to vote against this petition?

It‚Äôs gonna be funny when they have 100+ ppl there camping your corpse

Probably tbh. Log onto any rp server and do a /who and you'll see for yourself
---
I had hernia surgery yesterday and it took me 45 minutes to poop this morning. True story.
---
I know we joke, but honestly, I‚Äôve been playing the beta and taking breaks to workout/make food that‚Äôs relatively healthy, etc. It has probably actually allowed me to play more over the past few weeks because you physically feel better and you can stay focused for much longer.
---
It feels great to no-life the game while still not feeling like a sack of crap.  Take care of yourselves everyone, I want to see you all in Azeroth for a long, long time.
---
haha exactly :D every streamer are going to blame streamsniping anyway when ever they get outplayed.
---
Fuck the Wetlands...

So, I guess this is like a blacklist for streamers?

Hello, I wanted to say I really appreciate and like this video you made. It has all the information a new player would want for levelling a Paladin. I think this because I rarely see a clear list on what spells to upgrade ranks of, and what not to. Although I already know this now, because of a long time being a fan of the game, you have put it all clearly into a presentation. It is something very important, in my opinion, when levelling classes. Well done.
---
My criticism is that sometimes your voice is very clear and loud, but then perhaps in the second half of a sentence, you sound tired and have that rumble/frying sound in your voice.
---
Guilds do not have followers.
---
Are you confused how they work lil guy?
---
I knew someone who tried to get out of work by breaking his leg or attempting to.
---
No, but i remember the bosses in Alterac Valley.
---
haha those guys know whats up, i really like swifty too :D
---
DAE stremmer bad??
---
Druids are 100% able to heal/tank/dps in dungeons. You can even perform all roles in a Heart+NS spec and do just fine. That spec is also viable for p1/p2 raiding, allowing you to raid heal, tank dungeons, and is a solid pvp/wpvp spec. It really allows you to do just about everything you'd want to. 
---
Resto druids can also aoe farm with barkskin+hurricane+swipe in dire form and do lasher runs/princess farm, as well as being very strong gatherers (herb/mining. You have plenty of money making avenues at your disposal as a druid.
---
Druid wpvp is super satisfying to play as you can roll as a pocket healer while providing great utility with roots, interrupts/stuns (bash, feral charge, warstomp if Tauren), also able to win almost all 1v1 fights so long as you prepare accordingly (right gear, approach to the fight - use all forms!). 
---
Druid, imo, is so misunderstood and has been so misrepresented by folks over the years that they're just an absolute gem of a class that I honestly sort of feel bad talking up in public even because one of the classes biggest positives for me is how the vast majority of people totally underestimate them.
---
Anytime I tried to convince friend to roll ally instead horde back in the day, he yelled "lok thar ogar". You cant really make reasonable conversation with hordies haha
---
50m a year is pretty cheap for world of Warcraft.

---
&gt;***tHeRe ShOuLd Be A dEaTh PeNaLtY fOr KiLlInG a StReAmEr***
---
Which is actually against the rules.
---
I also think we should add monks and Pandaria to this server since they start at lvl 1
---
What is wrong with this the sub and people which miss int buff trying to act cool? Are seriously trying to tell lecture me that guild members are not called followers? Do I truly need to paint the whole picture for you?
---
I‚Äôd say it kinda works because now all specs do similar damage at least single target. The disparity between worst and best specs is 10-15%. Way back it would be like double, a warrior and a shaman would never do even remotely similar damage. So they made the Shaman do similar damage but then when they realized that it meant a Shaman would be favorable to a warrior all the time instead of dialing back their damage a bit to compensate, they just removed most of the utility.
---
I agree it didn‚Äôt work properly but in typical Blizzard fashion they didn‚Äôt go for a reasonable middle ground and went to the other extreme - instead of saying ok let‚Äôs keep a hybrid tax but make it not a huge gap so either choice can be viable we will just remove almost all utility or give it to everyone so your class doesn‚Äôt even really matter any more.

Opioid pain medication slows intestinal activity. That's why constipation is so common on those meds.

17 years as a paramedic
---
&gt;Streamers didnt really exist back in vanilla.  The whole thing is going to completely fuck over the experience of classic.  So much so that as I've watched the sub grow, I get less and less excited for classic every day because I dread what happens if I roll on a streamer server.
---
This is true but you have to remember 99% of their fan base is idiot kids who will not be able to keep up with leveling and be terrible players. 
---
IMO im curious to see if end game stomping the streamers and their little fan bases becomes more popular than playing with and helping them. 
---
Because im pretty sure more people at 60 end game in full epics will be more willing to camp a streamer than fight with one.
---
Why are there so many people saying priest???
---
Priest absorb doesn't allow warr to generate rage...
---
Priest is the *worst* healer to take with a warrior.
---
Any other healer makes a warrior a fucking beast
---
Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker
---
Just popped on the stream before it happened, he changed his background for the Horde one after that lmao
---
&gt; the endless possibilities provided by the lack of arenas / balancing
---
This is by far the most important thing that made early PvP interesting.  Once they started trying to balance for 2v2/3v3/5v5 (and "bring the player, not the class" in PvE) everything got homogenized and boring.
---
He's already picked the right side though
---
This didn't actually happen though.
---
That‚Äôs a very fancy piss bottle, but based on the colour of the liquid you should pay your doctor a visit.
---
Or, we could not do that
---
YES
---
Ya it seems to be shifting to tons of warriors and mages. Less and less druids.
---
Must be some weird beetroot.
---
I won‚Äôt disagree haha. I‚Äôll be sad to not play horde, but I think this‚Äôll give a nice refresh to the game!
---
pretty much everybody from the initial wave will be 60 within 2 months.
---
Can we get stream free servers ?
---
We handled it.
---
Yes yes and yes. IMO it will end up flipping on it self where theres far more people out to fck the streamer than help them. 
---
In the end i wouldn't be surprised if they ( the streamers)  have to end up rerolling under a secret name just to play normally.
---
Yeah that will probably be about average or even above average. Gotta keep in mind a big chunk of classic players will be people who played back in the day and are now in their late 20's to early 40's so they will all have jobs and kids and stuff to worry about so there will be a lot of people only playing a few hours a day/week.
---
Because they have created rules and even if 5 people chose to follow a player around and PvP him THAT is within the rules they created.
---
They even made a separate clause that states, PvP oriented camping, ganking and griefing is NOT a violation of any rules. It's an intended part of the game.
---
If you don't want to be ganked consecutivly you have several options. Roll on a PvE server, stop broadcasting your position to the world or change your toons name.
---
There's players like tanks from popular guilds etc that get camped all the time by opposing factions.
---
Preach is the fucking man, would get hammered with Preach and talk shop.
---
His model with legs looks stupid, but that fight was really good. Also the last raid in retail before LFR.
---
Boar invasion for alliance, centaur for horde.
---
Probably an RP-PVP server.
---
Kek someone doesn't remember how many warriors there were during vanilla 
---
U think they all duo leveled?
---
Warr is shit to level alone but def not impossible or even *that* much harder... 
---
&gt;enable you to achieve anything
---
Warr is objectively the strongest class at 60 , they wreck in PvP, are by far the best tanks, and once geared can top dps charts. The fact that you think this class needs another class to allow it to "achieve anything" shows you're simply delusional
---
And before you start with "you're just saying that cuz you're a warr" warr is likely the last class I would play specifically because I plan to solo lvl and don't plan to tank at all at 60, warriors are just beasts.
---
But im a pretty cool guy, i kills aleins and doesnt afraid of anythign.
---
I fucking loved this show
---
Was that supposed to be funny? 
---
&gt; people which miss int buff trying to act cool

They did that on TBC launch and the Horde has never recovered from the Blood Elf invasion.

---
Good old Altercal Valley
---
I don't get the blacklist one, what's up with that?
---
Totally agree with this, now there's just one more server to avoid.
---
Oh my sweet summer child
---
Personally I hope TBC gets added, and they let you copy your character there so you can keep it on classic as well, and do both. I'd actually be surprised if this is not what happens, but I don't really understand everyone's rush for TBC or post Naxx content anyway. I intend to enjoy the ride.
---
Um there's literally hot keys on the icons
---
Jesus Christ lol....
---
Gatekeeping at its finest
---
PvP is not consensual.  Never ask, always plunder.
---
Honestly this will make the game much more fun for you, exploring everything, figuring out things, beating a hard quest or npc etc. It will be your first, I still remember my first times when the game and that was like 15 years ago. As far as classes and races honestly pick what you feel most connected to. Idk im a big osrs person too so if you can handle that grind this game should be a blast for you.
---
Always.
---
If you aren't okay with being attacked by the other faction completely out of the blue, don't play on a PvP server.
---
Priest for PvP (he can dispell you)
---
Shaman for PvE
---
I quite like the idea of lowered lvl cap like in the beta, but maybe for a week or two, 2 months is way too much. Not sure about transfering characters and the other stuff.
---
&gt; 2. Shit bucket
---
That escalated quickly
---
Just play retail.
---
Getting paid to shag sounds like a good gig to me.
---
You forgot marijuana
---
The issue with this is the burden of proof is on the streamer. Can he prove without a shadow of doubt that the person who ganked him was an actual stream sniper? Was it someone who just noticed him and decided to follow him for the kill? 
---
It's really a big gray area that can't be policed imo unless there is irrefutable evidence. We can't just have a streamer try to get someone blacklisted because they feel they were sniped. Lots of people play this game. Streamers shouldn't be given that much power to determine someones fate, because I guarantee people will get burned who haven't done anything wrong.
---
yea and its just that creepy....theres only so many worthless losers who follow streamers theres far more people willing to make their life living hell in the game IMO
---
See, this man gets it - be an ape viking = go pvp server, be a classy gentleman = go pve server.
---
Idk what to servers are, shemales I suppose.
---
I have slow intestinal activity without any  medication, which infuriates me more every day. Any advice? I'm 180cm/77kg.
---
Is woo ping back in the shop to the right too ?
---
Convince him to play what he wants and don't be selfish.
---
Especially if he isn't planning on raiding or doing endgame. Don't do your friend dirty like that just so you can have a healing bitch.
---
Oh yeah, I'm in complete agreement. The lack of class fantasy is one of the reasons I don't play retail. Being robbed of half our class skills and being forced to use a legendary weapon that everyone else had didn't really say "class fantasy" to me.
---
This is a terrible idea.
---
&gt;[edit]
---
just saying the class name doesn't help me too much, please add why you think given class is the best match for warrior.
---
Your entire post is just asking for the class.
---
If they do I'm suing for my $15 back for blatantly false advertisement.

---
To F &amp; F yes
---
I agree and im willing to bet there will be a pro guild to rival the streamer guild and im pretty sure they will be far better than a bunch of no life losers following a streamer
---
The fact that a guild like that is going to run an Enhance Shaman is too funny. Yet they think they‚Äôre going to compete for world 1sts and speed clears lmao

&gt; Unfortunately, as we are not watching from the taurens perspective, he could've dismounted manually
---
You are not wrong but for the past hour I've been looking through old youtube videos from vanilla, pre-tbc and even some tbc videos and I've yet to find a single video of someone on their mount inside the gurubashi arena. Here is another [video from pre-tbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo1ftRlkUWQ) where at the start of the video you can see an undead dismounting. Now you might notice that this guy made it pretty far compared to the tauren from the other video, but I'm pretty confident that this is due to lag.  
---
¬†  
---
It seems odd to me that if players were able to mount that not a single one is on their mounts in any of the vanilla/tbc videos that I've looked at. Yet I can easily find videos from WotLK and later expansions where people sit on their mounts.
---
They might be two of the least played classes but hunter is a lot closer to the average and a lot less rare than druids.

Some class quests take you there. Also a good place to go for the 6 bandanas since most people don‚Äôt go there.

On one hand, I get what you're saying. Dungeon and raid PUGs are extremely min-max because they're bad (unless you are strict about AOTC+) and usually poorly geared so that only element they can optimize is the class/specs they bring, since that is often an obvious/easy check to make. This is not an ideal scenario because a lot of people get left out when they're perfectly capable of playing the content, so Blizzard would like the casual to "semi-core" masses to believe as many specs are on an equal plane as possible. 
---
On the other hand, Blizzard chasing down the white whale of making all specs "equally viable" arguably dragged them down into the depths with BFA. Even in Legion every spec had their own unique artifact with built-in abilities just for them and sometimes those abilities were quite powerful. Obliterating artifact items without replacing them (basically, pruning abilities) homogenized classes/class-fantasy. They've also pruned a number of abilities over the years that probably didn't need to simply because they didn't know how to asymmetrically balance them properly.
---
By the way, I love the MDI type content, other people think "competitive PvE" is a joke but I loved Mythic+ in Legion, I loved Legion dungeons, and I love seeing different builds and strategies being executed- but that's just the thing, because in Legion there was a variety of classes with unique abilities the different class builds actually mattered. Different classes brought different things to the table - sometimes you get situations where everyone brings a DK tank because they're the best, but sometimes you get situations where there's an interesting asymmetrical balance. Pulling up 2017's MDI finals - you had a series go to a game 5 with two very different 5-man builds because different classes bring different stuff and because of those differences, just because one spec wins out on pure damage, it may not be the best because another spec brings a unique class utility. Compare to: the 2019 Mythic Dungeon International where everyone brought the exact same god damn comp - prot warrior, resto druid, windwalker monk, and double combat rogue. Absolutely haram, but that's because no class brings unique utility so raw throughput is the only thing that matters and try as Blizzard may they will never, ever get that 100% perfect. 
---
**TL;DR: Better balance is a good thing. Asymmetric class balance &gt; symmetric class balance, because asymmetric balance is obfuscated by subjective opinions on what is better and/or allows for different compositions of unique utilities, symmetric balance always has a clear winner when people crunch the numbers and figure out who has the highest raw DPS/HPS/survivability.**

Ah yes because everybody who plays on a PvP server is just a griefing asshole all the time. Expert analysis Kowalski.
---
No one'll care if you're not optimal while leveling. In fact, they may appreciate the little added dps you throw out.
---
They are called PvE servers, my friend.
---
Then pay with your blood!
---
I guess this is the only thing I respect about Amongold but he mentioned how he will probably need to play on a PvE server if he wants to get any progression done since he will get ganked all the time. If Soda doesn't want to get ganked then roll on a PVE server. QQ.
---
Wait are you targeting big streamers who have thousands of followers, or the nobody streamer that has 10 viewers?
---
The latter will have no effect on your game play, the former will be too powerful for you to gank
---
Ofc esfand will play with asmon. They are friends.

Well avoid foods that typically cause slowdown like too much meat and cheese. Eat more fiber stuff, fruits and vegetables. Could also try water soluble fiber supplements, metamucial I think has one that dissolves in water well and is colorless and tasteless. Avoid medications that can cause slowdown like opioids. If you use a laxative you want the kind that pulls water into your intestions, NOT the stimulant kind. Also water, water, water. Not soft drinks or sports drinks, the salt in them can screw with your kidneys and keep water in your blood stream instead of flowing into your gut, that's why you have to avoid salt if you have hypertension.  Caffeinated beverages can cause some some speed up of gut motility, few cups of coffee or tea a day can help quite a bit.

Warriors wreck in PvP if they are supported by a healer. The moment one calls me a ‚Äúhealslut‚Äù or a ‚Äúhealing bitch‚Äù is the moment I let him die.

Kiting that black dragon to SW was done weekly on most servers in Vanilla. It's something anyone can do and usually drew attention.

It will be like that when classic launches just every 5 min :D I feel sorry for streamers just a tiny bit... joking.
---
While  I don't agree with OPs blatant use of his friend as a pocket healer, I just was playing devil's advocate to how you addressed warriors
---
As a mage, you are right they wreck with a healer and have a chance in 1v1 against a melee but without a healer life is ruff
---
OP maybe doesn't realize his goal with his friend should be for them both to have fun , while he could easily find a more serious player that understands his predicament to play with that could act as his pocket healer

It's okay to scam consumers as long as you only take a small amount from each!  If only there were a way for a small group or an individual to sue on behalf of many to punish the company for lying and profiting millions from their deceit.   Oh there is its called a class action lawsuit.

I am so intrigued by this stock photo. Who the fuck?! For what the fuck?! What the fuck?! What did you search for? "White people business casual fun NOT cornhole NOT golf"??

You‚Äôll be fine brother. Classic will be a great game to play a little bit everyday or so. You will really feel yourself progressing little by little everytime you log. I would recommend starting on a PVE realm if you do play, so that you won‚Äôt spend your limited time dealing with high level players ganking you.

Many people envy anyone who gets to experience WoW for the first time, and classic is a great place to start.

Not sure why that went to your comment it was meant for one under yours.
---
They said if you‚Äôre looking to re create the experience keep moving.
---
I disagree , the experience from just rolling on a pserver is amazing. I remember names of towns but that‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs been all new to me except a faint feeling.
---
boys be ready to repost, this is gonna get removed by mods very soon as all of my posts have
---
Awful.
---
They waddle like penguins

Ooooo this is going to get juicy. Is this staged or are they being completely serious and unaware that someone was recording?
---
Congrats on killing someone on autorun, you guys must be at least top 50 pvpers

This literally doesn‚Äôt explain anything. What video are you trying to link

I don't understand what you mean. Deactivating error speech turns it off completely.
---
Nobody is going to give a shit tbh about their blacklist, they‚Äôd need the entire community to cooperate and that‚Äôs nit going to happen.
---
The weirdest thing for me here is why your abilities are so far up from the bottom. Like, you've got a decent amount of real estate, don't cluster everything to the middle

"The Tipsout of Youtube and Twitch is very different from the Tipsout of not Youtube and Twitch" "I know I'm a nice guy on stuff and Twitch and Youtube but here it's very very different" Please don't make the mistake of thinking I'm the nice twitch streamer that blah blah blah hey guys its Tips here. None of that here."
---
Ah gotcha, all good - the intrinsic experience of classic is what will make it so good for those of us returning :)
---
8/26 - 27 is so close!!!
---
Yea talk about drug companies double dipping.
---
Most streamers are going to dudgeon power level. They are doing this is beta because they know this will happen.

Very useful,  thank you.

I love the framed picture of the succubus on the right.

The Apes guys are in EU and they will be pretty well known in Classic. 
---
Other than that, I think Kungen will play. And of course you have the Method guys but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll play much Classic.

That's not a hardcore gamer that's a gross weirdo. I've done server firsts and I just went to the bathroom like a normal person.

"pls ban ban ban" fucking childs. Always with that word in their weak stupid mind
---
Yes, they are scouring the lands ganking everybody.
---
That sucks. I need them for the pain but I've heard horror stories of people not going for 4-5 days with a hernia and then having the worst pain in the world when it finally came out. I guess I'll be spending alot of time in the washroom for the next week.
---
Yes, exactly! Just like how they had data that showed that nobody was interested in Classic!
---
you think you do, but you don't!
---
Why not?

On live they will have an army of fanboys to protect them.

I have a weird issue with my PC, and despite trouble shooting it and returning swapping parts I‚Äôve never been able to stop it.

Some games it just freezes and plays this horrible sound clipping super loud like static, and nothing can be down but a power button hold power down.

Problem was prevalent in mythic+ in WOD, but absent completely in BFA. Overwatch used to crash on me but no longer does. I can crank BFV to max ultra, but MHWorld crashes me often too.

Really hope wow classic doesn‚Äôt do the same.

One difference I have found is that I‚Äôm much better at games in general now. I‚Äôm realizing that although I was a Mt of a semi hardcore guild that I really wasn‚Äôt playing optimally.

The whole situation with ghost was weird, but I think they handled it really well .. ghost is definitely on his own path, I think it put a lot of strain on their personal friendship unfortunately, and from what I can tell they are two friends by virtue of the fact that they were good friends for so long, but it's nowhere near as strong as it was before undoi
---
just because you think something is trash doesnt mean it is. the post doesnt break any of the reddit rules and mods have been censoring it selectively because they are whiteknighting tipsout (who is a proven fraudster btw)

I said "IF you where to set a number on it"...

Sounds like that failure american raid/guild leader Bloodshot(?) who acted angry and still got stomped by EU
---
Alright thank you very much. I'll eat these things more now.
---
So...I'm really curious why the warriors are so low on this damage meter when. It indicates to me that maybe private servers either got something wrong or your thaddius kill back in the day was heavily unoptimized. Warriors are utter tools of destruction now a days.
---
So did your guild just lack recruitment in warriors or can you recall a sentiment back then that warriors we're not as good as theyre perceived to be today?

Because of them the AV experience was truly epic for me.

These won't work like they did in Vanilla, addon's and macro's are a lot more limited now.

Yes, it was. The video you linked is from 2009 and shows people abusing the 'Toy Train' to make the noise, not /train. Also because you asked, I clearly remember being annoyed in vanilla that I had an idiot in my 5-man-group in a raid that had a macro spamming /train before all of his casts. It would only play for the group you are in, not for the rest of the raid.

That's not how a game engine works, which relies mostly on the GPU. You're going to process more information with a 144+ Hz monitor than with a 60 Hz monitor. You update information on a time between frames basis.
---
Tauren are arguably better off in PvP (was stomp and not facing shamans), nightelf are better in raids (pally buffs and no WF to make other tanks / melee DPS more efficient).

Ye we actually met through gaming (Unreal Tournament '99) and went on playing WoW Vanilla as noobs, got into a guild and have been friends ever since =) (But not like Black Mirror - Striking Vipers).
---
Bad idea. The level cap is 30 and raised by 10 levels every 2 months. So every player that wants to play on that server has to start playing at the same moment or what? Im a casual player and i play whenever i have time. Sometimes i dont play for a few weeks straight. Your idea would force me to play at set times. And when i reach the level cap before the 2 months are over i just have to stop playing and wait for the level cap to be raised again?
---
Guess I'm moving to Firefox

I a few friends used to wipe 40man outdoor raids in Vanilla.  Getting a few more people to murder a streamer over and over again should be fun.

Hi, /u/Zubberikan

Thaddius isn't really a good meter I think, but what I can remember from my guild it was usually us rogues on top.

I think it was mostly because there weren't a lot of guides, and all our warriors were 2h arms (from what I can remember). I can ask around a bit (still know some people in the screenshot) what spec they were.

Just keep in mind - we can tell you the numbers/theorycraft and what the truth is about Druid performance - but in the overall community there is still a ridiculous bias against druids that you will have to deal with throughout your time playing one.

Did you transfer to Garithos? I believe that was the relief server for Illidan/Blackrock/Warsong.

&gt; of course you have the Method guys but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll play much Classic

Unless you cap your fps at your monitors refresh rate, right?
---
Listen, I understand where you're coming from. But FPS is what the game engine outputs. It's up to the monitor to refresh that data high enough.

all of the proof is up on the youtube channel Not Staysafe

According to the ToS corpse camping is not considered greifing.

C. Rules Related to Game Play. Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about, and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game, and not harassment, so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance, including gravestone and/or corpse camping, is considered a part of the Game. Because the Game is a "player vs. player" game, you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you, rather than contacting Blizzard's in-game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race.

This is a quote from the TOS where it specifically states corpse camping is fine.

This essentially covers it.

Brother and I have been practicing 1-10 and 10-20 runs together, and you shouldn't underestimate some of these benefits.

Overall you will fall behind in total xp in relation to soloing **if you do not grind monsters inbetween quest point locations** (arguably though this is worth doing even solo too)
---
That said, it's been pretty nice having 1 person run herb/alch and another have tailor/enchant and all cloth gets funneled to the tailor. Easy and quick wands/bags for both of us.

Beef jerky is also another good snack.

Right but if you use vsync on a 60hz monitor versus a 144hz monitor, the GPU will be working harder with a 144hz monitor

So streamer armies swarming to the layer you're on will get you phased out right when you're about to engage a rarespawn during solo farm, got it. One more reason to keep streamers on a containment server.

&gt;[Does that mean that your frame rate is limited by your screen‚Äôs refresh rate? No; they are two separate things. Remember that FPS is how many frames your gaming computer is producing or drawing, while the refresh rate is how many times the monitor is refreshing the image on the screen. The refresh rate (Hz) of your monitor does not affect the frame rate (FPS) your GPU will be outputting. However, if your FPS is higher than your refresh rate, your display will not be able to display all of the frames your computer is producing, so although the refresh rate doesn‚Äôt technically limit the frame rate, it does effectively set a cap.](https://www.avadirect.com/blog/frame-rate-fps-vs-hz-refresh-rate/)

To be fair, several classes were monsters in 2.0 prepatch. Warlock was probably the most prominent example, but I played a Hunter and we went from "meh" to "yo what the *fuck* arcane shot?!" real quick. Arcane shot was so busted they didn't even wait till TBC early raiding to nerf it, it got nerfed within a week of release iirc.

---
Actually I can completely see Warriors getting that rep as tanking in retail is completely braindead.
---
You cannot pass the tauren ass.
---
Preach is pretty well known but he's a chill dude with a good community, I'd be honored to play on the same server as that dude.
---
Than you'll get tearing. Your GPU isn't all of a sudden going to gain hardware power because your refresh rate is higher.
---
I remember a top tier guild on a pserver giving it to a feral druid tank - it's the only class (To my knowledge) that will benefit from it in PvE. 
---
So while you said that you can't use it as a druid, you're the only one that can actually use it for real ;) otherwise it's just a question if who's the GM - or a close friend of the GM. 
---
As a long time shammy I was kinda jelly about the druid running around with it for fire resistance purposes only, replacing it with Warden Staff on any other fights. I was also jealous of the holy pally that got it for whenever he felt like playing Ret in PvP.
---
He should make a priest (in fact anything) then at 60 when you guys are looking to join a raiding guild you get to watch as your healing bitch laughs and leaves you in the dust because the guilds all want healers and they already have tanks ;)
---
Just toss a renew before you drink and they should be good. Maybe refresh it when you finish drinking, and they‚Äôll be topped before they need it again.
---
Oh no, not a low level rare spawn
---
Has it been confirmed that you don't need an active sub to get one?
---
Not pictured: the dozens of stealthed rogues/druids
---
The obsession with streamers (both positive and negative) is getting out of hand, indeed.
---
?? Most of the top videos in the channel I linked talk about feral tanking. I don't see what the confusion is.
---
Alone 1 raptor kill = 100 xp.
---
Together 1 raptor kill = 50 xp each.
---
It varies based on the class combo but you should be able to kill stuff roughly twice as fast, so it mostly evens out.
---
Gratzz
---
Minds can change. Right? .....RIGHT? No big deal what they name them. Thought it woulda been neat to use the original server names in hopes of returning players choosing their old realms. That is all. Thanks for link.
---
I took a break during cata, mop, wod. Came back and pvp was all fucked up. Everyone had stuns, everyone had a silence/pummel. DRs were fucking weird. 
---
In vanilla, you had to play smart, not fast. Know your class and know your opponents. It can be frustrating losing to a mage or rogue. But when you kill someone, it's so fucking rewarding.
---
@laventerdent  lol  did u get that from south park?
---
I loved seeing a hunter try to pull a mob into their trap, but would use serpent sting...
---
Priest is fun as hell. You‚Äôll love it.
---
Yeah but they can't do it by themselves, they need support from the server community.
---
Prot Paladins are far better tanks in all content than Bear Druids.
---
They should be careful or they'll end on Sodapoppin's blacklist.
---
Fck this
---
Before that point, Hunters could Feign Death (remove all threat, drop from combat) and drink water back to full mp.
---
Back then DPS casters would usually run out of mana before the boss was dead, and would have to use potions or mana gems to recover that mana. Being able to drop all threat and regain all MP was a huge advantage. 
---
When that was removed, Hunter's weaknesses of a MAD (multi-attribute dependent) class were exposed. INT doesn't directly increase Hunter damage like it does for casters (spell crit%). You can compare Hunter tier armor to Mages (compare the INT to the AGI) or Rogues (compare AGI/STR total to AGI). The differences get worse as the gear gets better, and this was the main reasoning behind the shift to Focus as a resource for Hunters.
---
TL;DR - Feign Death (drop threat), drinking water (restore all mp) was how Hunters competed before FD stopped dropping you from combat in 1.9. Hunter's need INT for mana but it doesn't increase DPS, so their gear scales worse than anyones.
---
My main on retail was a horde holy pally. There‚Äôs no chance me and the boys go alliance, so I guess it‚Äôs holy priest for me! Super excited though.
---
A little fun fact: undead holy priest are actually suffering tremendously when casting holy spells according to the lore. For every holy spell cast, they regain some feeling and sensation from when they were alive. For example, they start tasting their own rotting mouth.
---
Guys. Guys. GUYS!!! KIL KORRAK PLIZ NEED FOR QUEST!
---
Right. I think we are getting off topic here or we are diving down farther than I care to go.
---
Higher refresh rate and FPS is easier on the eyes, but it also gives you the ability to react sooner (at the code level) since there is less time between frames (0.017 seconds versus 0.0069 seconds, 60 versus 144). Now does that really make a difference in WoW classic? I'd say no except to PvP.
---
Who said anything about low level? Layering has been stated to persist throughout phase 1. People will be 60 long before phase 1 ends.
---
Imagine if a lot of the original design was kept. Would it have been as popular?  
---
This looks like a completely different game to how it ended up being, to my eyes anyway.
---
60 in a couple months?? More like 60 in two weeks. 
---
I love the idea of what you're proposing while watching the beta, but I know it's not gonna happen.
---
I'd suggest after phase 3 to start a fresh server with caps at 19 29 39 49 60. Obviously I said twink levels for battlegrounds when opened up on phase 3.
---
That‚Äôs why I want them on the same server as asmongold so I enjoy the drama of them fighting for AQ.
---
Of course it did, I remember the black list our server had. Plenty of people had their gaming experience forever ruined for being pieces of shit. Eventually the all disappeared, either quit the game or rerolled and learned to behave.

---
What the fuck am I reading? this has nothing to do with the debate
---
Sorry, but there's mold growing out of it.
---
I went NE simply for shadowmeld since a well timed shadowmeld can spare you from dying during a wipe. As long as no one else is alive when you shadowmeld it will drop all aggro and reset the fight.
---
Keep the memory. Burn the shirt.
---
Yes, everyone gets August 13th, but they probably might get a sooner date.
---
Shit. Gonna need to save up some money...still got a few months left!
---
It's all good, will be out a few weeks after launch and then we get 6 hour queues :)
---
Thanks for all the love on this ! Yes, I did make this box art , lol. If anyone‚Äôs interested in seeing more, please let me know, but I don‚Äôt want to flood the Reddit. WHAT I WILL flood however is my actual social media‚Äôs where no one will complain about posting a lot lol. 
---
Twitter: @mike_wurster
---
Instagram: @mikewurster
---
My Instagram is the best place to see my art, as that‚Äôs my more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù social media, but I‚Äôve been trying to post the same stuff on twitter. Thanks again! 
---
Links to both in my bio.
---
Play, is a wide term here. Depends on bandwidth and the program you use. Don't expect pvping with that. Google Stadia would be a next evolution to this.
---
&gt;  Without a manual crowd pummeler this threat is good, but with one the threat is extremely high.
---
And this is a good point to bring up. Being a successful druid tank would require the player to spend a lot of time farming odd pieces of gear because of how Vanilla's gear optimization worked. 
---
&gt; Also, getting squished is not a concern on non-frenzy/enrage bosses, since being able to hit the armor cap in pre-bis and having more HP than a warrior means crushing blows and crits don't come close to killing you.
---
From what I understand, the druid tank would have to farm a lot of odds and ends pieces and even still would only be a useful tank in certain situations. 
---
That's a lot of work to put on a big ol maybe.
---
I'm guessing hinterlands for sfk? And Western pleaguelands for SM?
---
If you got into OSRS, you'll love this imo. 
---
Just make sure you watch that Southpark episode "Make love not warcraft" first :)
---
Multiboxers, truly the scum of WoW since its beginning.
---
Esfand already said that Streamers get a priority queue for Beta.
---
Gotta get that advertisement going, I guess.
---
Negative, ghost rider.
---
It's just unrefined. I'm actually surprised that it was looking that good in 2001.
---
To be fair, hydras stream is dead as fuck. He's so washed up he can't even peak 1k viewers these days.
---
It is fine if you have a fast connection to the desktop. Try it with a free char on bfa? (you dont need to pay for anything)
---
Some people were remote playing wow via phones ~10 years ago so definitely possible (tho not great for anything except grinding from what I recall).
---
Absolutely terrible. Thank god im playing on non-streamer EU servers.
---
If world/large group PvP interests you, you might want to consider that rogues are not as useful as mages there. However if I were you i'd roll both on retro-wow (instant 60 private server) to get a feel for both at 60.
---
F for Totalbiscuit
---
Yup! August 13th! Though I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't allow them a day earlier so they can 'save their brand'.
---
" We'll  have 120 raid members by AQ launch with the ability to clear BWL with  no more than 30 people, not including alts. That's at least 4 Scarab  Lords. And we plan on selling every one of them to the highest bidder."
---
So here is OP's actual intend - making sure none of the popular streamers interferes with their business plans!
---
The way they explained it, this should never happen. Once you log in you are on a layer and you will remain on that layer unless you join a group with someone from a different layer. 
---
This is most likely as a result of the ‚Äústress test‚Äù and Blizzard making some changes behind the scenes.  
---
If you read the world chat you can see ‚ÄúINV TO ASMON LAYER‚Äù which means there was most likely an influx of players on one layer which in turn kicked off anyone who wasn‚Äôt in a group from that layer as the raid group would take priority over someone who is solo.
---
I think I'm going to take my time and play two toons.  I'm going to play one just enough to keep the rested XP flowing.
---
I am going to guess it is going to work the same as creating a character normally. First person to submit it and gets in the system would be theirs.
---
That may be cool. Like assassination objectives for the faction wars, "nobles" and high value targets inciting battle royales between their guards and would-be killers.
---
I was wrapping up my part of the discussion. Didn't mind to fuck with you. Jesus christ.
---
Warlock tier 2 set probably best looking gear in game imo but every set a warlock gets is amazing looking.
---
Turn that Crossroads into Crossbones.
---
Well yea, and you're 99% of the time going to have one of those in a raid setting. 
---
But the point I am getting at is that the druid tank has to do more work, and have more favorable situations in the raid to make tanking work than a warrior does.
---
I don't disagree but tips seemed genuinely nice, otherwise my BS indicator has been working fairly well.
---
Vanilla WoW aint about being top ultra super tier champion with the highest ePEEN rating. It's about having fun. This is fun.
---
This too. It could also just be that for a majority of leveling, the few percent difference in the pets is negligible. And swapping and re-leveling new pets later (when that percent is more meaningful) just isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
I would pay money to have Madseason narrate my Classic experience.
---
with the long gcds in most mmorpgs, thats not even a problem
---
Has anyone ever wall jumped or managed to get to the water/river north of the starting area?
---
Swifty is OG. I could never really hate the guy. He just has fun.
---
So I remember that I got that hat around level 48 or so and it was not even great when I found it. I think it only had a level 42 or 43 requirement or thereabouts. But I loved the look of it so much and kept passing on upgrades I found while questing/grinding all the way through level 60. It's all about the looks.
---
this is fucking bullshit. I just wanna see an immerse world with so many people running around just like in p servers
---
I actually preferred AV over WSG. I had such a fun time in AV every time I zoned in.
---
Whatever protects your ego
---
Pre-raid the Dwarven Hand Cannon is a contender for BiS. This is the last time you'll use a gun.
---
haha, such a great ep. I've seen just about every episode and its one I remember the most.
---
You have mail!
---
ranged wep skill doesn't matter nearly as much as melee. Just get whatever BIS is for everyone.
---
I wouldn't assume anything, we'll have to wait and see
---
You cook it inside the paper sleeve that comes in the package and if your microwave doesnt have a turn table or is not a sensor microwave then you are suppose to flip it partway through cooking.
---
Likewise
---
I don't think anyone hates cataclysm Rag. He was arguable one of the best designed raid bosses, ever. It's such a mechanically well designed encounter it's beautiful, and it's one of the end bosses that stood for the longest time without being broken.
---
I feel like you missed the point lol...
---
This is why we need realm funded mental health services.
---
You would most likely lag retry hard but you could do it. One thing I‚Äôve noticed with RDP is clicking and dragging lags a lot, so I would rule out moving with your mouse and stick to WASD-QE
---
Damn. This is a fantastic job. Blizzard should hire you.
---
Can we blacklist the term blacklist? Shit is so annoying
---
Yeah its only for Classic. I dont plan on making it work for vanilla because many of the events aren't the same.
---
An argument can be made for the improved wind fury totem talent but that‚Äôs better in later content like AQ and Naxx when warriors rule supreme with great gear scaling.
---
[REEEEEEEEEEE](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reeeeeee)
---
How abused were you as a child, man? Do you not see that spending this much effort trying to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù people you don‚Äôt even know and barely even effect you is straight up psychotic behavior. I thought this was a meme at first. Turns out you all are really way worse than the stereotype of a neck beard.
---
Yeah swifty is chill, but these rogues aren‚Äôt complete assholes, they only killed them once(swifty, towlie or whatever his name is, staysafe), after they ressed, the rogues just danced around them and let em go
---
And the ram mounts are awesome!
---
Giving you an upvote because that‚Äôs a well articulated opinion and circlejerks suck. I never played the updated rag. But I do love the legless model.
---
Who hurt you
---
The problem is when the layer reaches maximum capacity and all the sudden a raid group forms and people from other layers are added to the ‚Äúfull‚Äù layer therefore kicking out random solo players who aren‚Äôt part of group. 
---
Maybe Blizzard could fix this by instead of having a ‚Äúhard‚Äù cap at say 1000 players per layer, they make a soft cap where the layer can exceed 1000 but as new players log in they will not be added to the full layer. 
---
Players can create raids and overload an individual layer, leading to a ‚Äúmega layer‚Äù but ultimately Blizzard has to decide what to do in that situation.
---
Hmm depends in the type of instant - if you mean instant direct DMG spells, hunter or Mage - especially an elemental Mage (frost fire hybrid) will be able to dish out a lot of DMG with instant casts in a very short time. 
---
Hunters just shoot people all the time with only one move having a proper cast time to my knowledge.
---
Warlocks have DoTs which are instant, and 1-3 instant direct DMG spells depending on talents (IIRC) - however they are all on cooldowns or based on procs. 
---
Shamans have shocks which are strong and on a short cooldown, and so on ...
---
&gt;	who have been on it for years
---
Who are on rat poison regularly, and why would one?
---
Stick to BFA if this offended you haHAA
---
you can't oneshot him in HC, you'll have to go through his leg phase anyway
---
Hes unleashing his inner reeeeetard
---
Download a picture and put it on your 2nd screen. Cmon man
---
They‚Äôre twice as bad tbh.
---
Doesn't look like multiboxing, mister.
---
Lieutenant rag you aint got no legs.
---
Ragnaros with legs was an absolute atrocity.
---
And this is why ores called WoW. Lol
---
Found the Wisconsinite!
---
I want to see this.
---
Carracter
---
Look into 0/30/21. Perfectly fine for raid healing, still has great solo ability. Good enough to tank/dps 5 man's. Great for pvp.
---
jji I‚Äôm
---
That's what I was considering..
---
Mostly because nobody was autistic enough to create a griefing blacklist addon.
---
I feel like even though the classes are imbalanced, none are too bad.  Some are obviously much better in duels etc, but it's still mostly a rock paper scissors meta.  And maybe the worst pvp classes like druid still makes up for it by being a great flag runner.
---
Did you watch the video on the reasons to avoid streamers on the website? Some of us don't want our Classic experience trashed by someone trying to make money off of Classic WoW
---
I didn‚Äôt even Minos about one from un goro. What do you use for main hand?
---
Let's stream snipe them when servers launch, spam camp them, it will teach them not to make a blacklist...
---
Hell let's make a guild just to kill streamers.
---
PvP happening on a PvP server? I don't care who's involved or how it's orchestrated; It's within the server rules and is good to go.
---
Red is dead.
---
It was added in 1.8 which would be The Dragons of Nightmare, so phase 4
---
This is a rogue weapon
---
I would know... I'm one of those rogues &gt;.&gt; But I still have a code of honor.
---
With what I know, I would say its actually worse.
---
There is one thing that, if it works, would be fantastic.
---
In modern, Auto Shot counts as a spell and when it the projectile leaves the player the UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCESSFUL event fires. If Classic has the same behavior then the white part of the timer woul always be correct.
---
Absolutely nobody here does
---
Especially in the beginning it's mainly about luck. If you just cast shadow bolts all fight and you get very few crits and very few nightfall procs, then you shouldn't pull agro. However, a crit, followed by a nightfall procc that also crits might get you agro before you even knew you were close to getting it.
---
Niiiice
---
Mitch jones
---
Thanks for this, are there any general wow classic ones also?
---
I think you can't shadowmeld in combat in classic wow
---
Phasing will only be needed for starting zones. After that players will be spread out over continents, BG, dungeons, or other zones
---
You are a god
---
Proof?
---
Poggers is old news buddy
---
Debatable. Twitch chat in the vid said as much, anyways, and everyone knows that to be an honest and reliable source of information.
---
I don‚Äôt think your last point is true? As far as I know, the disenchanting level restriction was in this iteration of the game.
---
I never fought Heroic Rag, so he never had legs to me, even in Firelands :)
---
Yeah I'm experiencing a lot of miss clicks and fast mouse spinning, trying to fix it.
---
Gotta find afternoon raid guilds on the weekend
---
Hogger.
---
It is Staff of Jordan :)
---
I just want to avoid Sodumbpoopin and Asmon "big dick dps LMAO" bronze--the rest I can deal with
---
Only reason soda hasnt blacklisted them, is that they are horde, so they cant kill him.
---
That dwarf bae pigtail swirl tho
---
Correct. Gear with +healing will improve the amount you heal. Intellect improves total mana pool and spell crit chance.
---
You folks need to chill.   It will be readily known what server they all decide to be on.  It will be much harder to avoid the random Classic douchebags that are much more prevalent than streamers.
---
When you speak on alliance it comes out as gibberish, so some people took the time to type stuff back and forth between alliance and horde until they could make legible phrases for the other faction to read, and saved them as macros.
---
You can google horde to alliance translations (or vice versa)
---
What even remotely looks like multiboxing to you?
---
Paladin and warrior is the best combo in the game.
---
Tauren 100% Horde needs you boi
---
Damn right
---
So don‚Äôt join their guild...? It‚Äôs their guild, their rules, their decisions. If people have a problem with it they can /gquit or don‚Äôt join at all.
---
Anti streamer jerk circle is just getting fucking old at this point.
---
Why would anyone want to be in that guild?
---
I'll include a trigger warning next time.
---
Yeah, both of my locations have over 100mbps up and down, so I don‚Äôt think it can be... if you find a solution I‚Äôd love to know though :)
---
I also came from RS around that time and the scamming thing was by far the biggest adjustment to me. It blew my mind that I could trade this guy all these mats and he would make what I needed and trade it back without scamming
---
Yepp :) Not exactly rocket science.
---
Proof?  This is the proof.  I took the screenshot myself 5 minutes ago.
---
Yeah, I like Asmon and I think it‚Äôs super cool that summit and shroud are playing.  I don‚Äôt hate streamers, but man some of them are awful.
---
Nah dude they do it to alliance so its OK
---
Great list. Thanks for compiling.
---
Yeah. Even for Nelf I still doubt if it really would be worth it if you want to speed level. 
---
I remember when I played a Nelf I'd just skip Westfall altogether and leveled through Darkshore instead. If I had to take the time to go and get a pet with screech in WF instead of grabbing the close by cat skills I just dont think it would have been worth it timewise. 
---
You put in a lot of effort to get that Owl with the right skills, I just dont see how it is better than to pick something more close by. The only pet I could see make a huge difference would be pre Nerf Lupos with Shadow Damage. But that's just from my experience.
---
That old animation is beautiful
---
Tell me, what's more telling for t2 diabetes than admitting you're hooked on energy drinks but aren't allowed sugar any more.
---
Not avoid, kill them at all costs, because they got invited unfairly into beta...
---
Maybe if you keep giving them you're money, you might even get a little should out from them.  THEN YOULL BE FAMOUS TOO LULZ.
---
I‚Äôm most likely in the same boat. It‚Äôs gonna be interesting. I‚Äôm normally a hardcore leveler by without knowing the quests it might slow me down a lot. I‚Äôm kinda ok with this
---
Pleasant people. Makes me sick. Who actually likes these morons?
---
I would probably have that as a separate addon just because I feel like that is out of the scope for WeaponSwingTimer. I would have to rename it. 
---
I'm surprised there isn't already an enemy cast bar addon already.
---
If you join a streamers guild you're stupid for not expecting this. That said, if I was a streamer I would take all streamer privileges
---
I'm guessing you don't wipe with a poop sock.  Without wiping I imagine I could make it to toilet and back in 15-20s.  A blizzard is 8s so you could just let one go  and only need to lose 12s. Hold in  a poop  for 48 hours and this saves 6s a day.
---
Ok, but what if I have a tauren and ne wife irl and we found out that the game WoW was stolen from a friend in the 70s and Blizzard is actually a company that steals other peoples games and made it there own. Also, what if wow is supposed to be a completely different game. Some data miners and a galactica person I know found out that 70% of WoW's original data is missing. Also a lawyer friend said Blizzard has been in court for the past 2 years because of there games being stolen property. Also, fuk off mesmerist, no longer your drug den.
---
That'll do pig, that'll do.
---
I think he wants it to update his position in the game as he moves through it
---
I‚Äôm actually subbed to Asmon and staysafe. I really enjoy their content and I enjoyed asmons YouTube videos long before he streamed.
---
Nothing wrong with supporting something you enjoy.
---
You‚Äôre just being an obnoxious asshole at this point.
---
Just to add to that.  I have had a Vive for years and just got a Quest and it's blown me away how versatile it is.  If you want vr get a Quest.
---
China Inf, is for noobs!
---
Back then I didn't have a big monitor and most of the time I just was clicking everywhere before I found the beauty of mouse over marco. In a party it wasn't so bad. My 15 yr old self made some bad choices!
---
no need to worry about fps with those specs
---
Characters of the same race with variations on the same name traveling together in the same direction dismounting at the same time.
---
At first glance, with half attention, on a groggy morning with the twitch chat talking about multiboxers, it's pretty reasonable to come to that conclusion.
---
On stream i'm the nicest guy you'll ever meet..
---
https://i.redd.it/sbogan1kcfz01.jpg
---
Yep, got to read them donations... Fuck the other 39 people, that are there ...
---
I am money that's true
---
Whats the cooldown on Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator? its not showing on the item effect.
---
Yeah, doing hard drugs while playing video games is definitely a great idea!
---
I have yet to find an article about it, but I have been able to confirm it on the stress test.  
---
Basicly the gist of it is that  /run   or /script  commands are blocked while in combat, because this opened the door for decision making within the script. Several classes had a 1 macro script for their optimal dps rotation.
---
It's on the beta, nobody cares
---
Can‚Äôt wait until August 27th. Everybody will be too busy actually playing the game to care about what xyz streamer is doing.
---
This.
---
Every class does the thing, so people will choose the one that does that thing best
---
Down
---
Ingame map. So i can see my own location.

And where addon Work.

Oh, that‚Äôs it

What‚Äôs preventing you from setting that gmotd in your own guild and stirring up the anti streamer circle jerk bcuz your bored
---
Negative ghostrider the pattern is full.
---
Did photo bucket deactivate accounts? I can't find mine anymore. I had tons of screenshots on there I'd love to track down if possible.
---
Yikes
---
Not possible
---
My Instagram is the best place to see my art, as that‚Äôs my more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù social media, but I‚Äôve been trying to post the same stuff on twitter. Thanks again!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt funnel all the cloth you‚Äôre gonna need to keep first aid leveled up.
---
Exactly
---
I fucking love how complicated hunters are (seriously).
---
yeah, this \~25 will have so much impact, ofc. lots of them will go to the same servers anyway, having two of them on the same server with different factions even helps keeping the server balanced and alive, instead of heaving slowly dying servers again/servers that are totally unbalanced.  
---
I find it funny how people complain about the lack of community feeling in retail, and then they get their community delivered fo free by streamers in classic, and it is not okay either.
---
Easy sunshine,  I'm a brit and in giving you solid advice :p I'm still planning my guild, I've recently left a group I've played with for over 8 years so in back to square one :)
---
Method Josh is probably the most well known WoW streamer from EU right now.
---
Wowhead has a page on macro syntax. It's a bit more simple than what existed in vanilla.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt check the math not gonna lie, the axe def looks like a better choice for max damage. However let‚Äôs be honest the mace is the best looking option. Too bad the mace stun specialty is garbage.
---
I leveled a tauren druid for BC, but in wrath faction switched to play with a friend.  At first I didn't care for NE, but now I'd much prefer it - fits the druid theme better I think.
---
I can create the same screenshot in 2 min lol
---
Well if your name is mongo you propably need bodyguards.
---
I think they are saying we can‚Äôt see the guild name etc
---
Move anything Addon you can do this
---
Most (maybe all) instances of spirit and mp5 were converted to versatility when spirit was dropped from the game.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22632/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian
---
This is the original stats.
---
If you want to have the worst model in the game as your cat form pick tauren.
---
No kidding, [frig off Lahey](https://pics.me.me/its-not-fucking-rocket-appliances-31767775.png)
---
Imaging giving a shit about a guild message and being to dense to comprehend irony
---
Warrior tank? Really?
---
Rogue is probably one of the worst classes to multibox though.
---
most schools in the UK go back September tho
---
The only way that I managed to do it was to stretch the screen over two monitors and then reposition the UI to my primary one. 
---
Once that was done, I made the map open on the second screen, but to be honest it wasn‚Äôt ideal. For example, it would close during certain actions and things like loading screens/cut scenes/certain encounter mechanics would be split between the two monitors. 
---
I would love to put a website on a second monitor and have that live track my position. For example, imagine [this](https://www.vanilla-questing.me)  doing that, would be amazing. Being able to add little notes to the map (markers, draw on it for gathering, etc) would be incredible. 
---
Last bit of info, I watched a video where someone used a streaming app (for Twitch, etc) and only focused on his minimap (instead of full screen).  Once that was done, he ‚Äúpreviewed‚Äù what would be a live stream on his second monitor and increased the size of it so that it was easier to see. 
---
This didn‚Äôt increase the view to beyond what the minimap was showing, but yeah, it was pretty cool. Hope that helps!
---
Seconding this. The GY trick saves tons of time. You can spend that time sneaking into the secret area under Ironforge üëç
---
Everything in moderation, especially moderation.
---
Yes it is, see my comment below.
---
Heroic Rag was an absolute guild killer. I can think of like 3 different guilds on my old server that broke up during prog in Firelands thanks to this encounter. Fantastic boss.
---
Any healer really.
---
Is this link supporting OP or did someone rip it???
---
NELF has better catform stealth +1 level
---
"R" for reroll?
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be. I'm not a developer but I don't see how the API couldn't be able to track your location, and then that data could be used by an external program that places your location on a map.
---
Theoretically it seems possible.
---
Are implying that taking a screenshot or downloading the map from internet and then opening ot in the 2nd screen is impossible?
---
You know the #nochanges people would demand this and insist it was perfect
---
Here's your proof - https://imgur.com/a/MMO28cg

Oh, the undeads looks SICK (no pun intended?)

holy shit!!!

The litless eyes still watching you even after death. Scary and Epic.

It‚Äôs from MAGA, but who the fuck cares?
---
Nelf go Ally fuck the Horde ! :D
---
this is gonna get deleted real soon i bet ya, even more when tips &amp; friends are mods on the subreddit
---
A basic auction house mod is almost required though. Blizz's version is awful. You can easily get screwed over on a price and not know it.
---
Lokslashchickennoob
---
30mins, ive added it
---
JINX merch i like!
---
He wants a live map that shows his location. Within the confines of the game, not possible. With addons, who knows.
---
Def gonna need a ryzen 3900x and 2080tis in sli to run this 2004 bad boy on classic settings
---
Thanks I googled it and just used it.  
---
I worked Hard for my chance as OT back in vanilla.  
---
Stopped playing in cata but now I want to go back.  
---
Probably goon hunter first this time but Druid is a good 2nd. As I can go either 30/21 or 31/20 and be both tank/dps/healer.
---
I just checked this now i have decent internet, you are indeed correct and have edited it
---
Or just ... dont do that
---
Yea i edited my answer to you. Not sure if that move anything addon could do it.
---
That's not how layering works. They aren't creating multiple phases by zone, they've said it's phases of the entire continent.
---
Lmaooo what is that?????
---
Its true.  The only reason why people are watching them is because thousands of people who want to play the game currently cant.
---
I'll admit I enjoy his character. Fuckin hate his chat though, but I hate most streamers chat and just gave it permanently hidden. Him talking about how once he gets ravager he will be a literal unkillable God in SM was pretty funny to me.
---
Yeah, they all dismount at the exact same time while not auto following
---
then they press different abilities
---
then they run around in different ways
---
then they spam horde speak at different times
---
then mount at different times
---
but yeah i guess dismounting instantly on the same target running at them makes it look like a multiboxer
---
Two shoes, TWO SHOES!
---
ha ha ha you are so funny /s
---
Would be funny but I can already see all those diehard classic neckbeards type in the forums that Blizz are a bunch of apes for destroying their hardcore speedlvl
---
MT is going to be one of the hardest to get into raids with. Most guilds will have 1 and only 1 main tank for the entire guild. The others will have 2 if they have a second raid team. The rest will offtank in various fights but will focus on DPS. If this is what you plan to try, well... good luck to you.
---
THANK THE GODS FOR BESSIE
---
Ok so heres what you want- fuk streamers
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt understand the issue with streamers.
---
Play it, just be careful, WoW back in vanilla days was highly addictive, and it still is.
---
clap
---
Who cares about T2
---
Yah, instead of 100,000 viewers, Asmon will be back down to *only* 20,000
---
Grown adults who hate people they've never met in their entire lives. This is some of the most pathetic shit I've seen ever
---
Because someone would ruin it
---
Blizz's can't even do the effort to fix the auction house in retail. As much as I would like it altered for Classic it's not happening.
---
No, that will be every player on whichever server Asmongold decides on. You guys seem to not realize this. The streamer hate is overblown, but there are valid concerns.
---
Pure Pwnage inspired me to roll SPriest.
---
They Are very clearly not multiboxing. Please stay on retail we don't want you.
---
Population imbalance.
---
Shaman healer isn‚Äôt useless. It‚Äôs just a different type of healing, more support based. 
---
It‚Äôs all based on synergy too, if you‚Äôve got 2 priests are you going to want a third over a shaman? Probably not.
---
I just invested in one and it was a game changer. Back and ass pain are gone. /r/StandingDesk ftw
---
Sativa weed (in moderation depending on tolerance of course) also helps clear your head, but of course weed isn‚Äôt for everyone (and isn‚Äôt legal for everyone yet).
---
I better start stocking up on my ingredients.  Fortunately I am already Exalted with the Scotch and Ale factions.  This will definitely help me get Exalted with the misc factions of WoW again.
---
That's a lot of paladins...
---
The "Some things never change!" at the bottom... like why? Isn't that the whole implication of the post/joke. It just makes the whole post bad lol
---
Learning is the a lot of people the fun, you might have a better time than a lot of returning players
---
It was definitely the Gift of the Wild (yellowy) icon before :)
---
Hi, /u/SpookyShyGhosty
---
If you take a bit of time to level gathering profs / work the AH, it shouldn't be too bad.  I wouldn't choose a class based on a free mount, you'll get the mount not long after 40 otherwise (since the leveling slows down and things sell for more)
---
The version with legs doesn‚Äôt even look that good in the game. The picture‚Äôs been edited.
---
I'll always remember being the first guild on my server to down heroic rag. I got the firebird mount and was absolutely shocked. Flew that baby around SW with that horn artifact that made me bigger + fun stuff like oozling to make me green. Great times. Then pandas came and I gtfo of there until classic.
---
I'm stocking up on beef jerky and premade salads.
---
Fury/prot
---
Is it just dusty in Orgrimmar or are my eyes watering? Oh, it's actually the dust... okay...
---
You willingly let that take up room in your house?
---
Guilty as charged.
---
Where‚Äôs the piss bottles?
---
I remember when they added achievements in the 2.0 patch our guild did the one to kill all the horde leaders. It was quite hard because they were up leveled up to 73. We had people in the back of the room staying out of combat to rez people that died.
---
Cool story, bro. I know they're not a multiboxer. As I said, that's what it looked like at *first* glance. 
---
Why do you feel compelled to make it some weird pseudo-argument where my initial understanding of something being wrong is your win condition?
---
I guess you'll believe whatever you want to believe then?
---
Depends on whether you spec into research or practice. Practice starts better but in the end game researcher scales way better due to all the AoE abilities.
---
The real money saver is not buying every skill on the way to 40. Some just aren‚Äôt that useful for leveling, or you can slump on using a lower rank. If you are good at vendoring all the grays, doing gathering profs, not buying dumb stuff at the AH, and wisely buying skills from 20-40, you‚Äôll have the gold easily.
---
U/ExcessAintRebellion for one
---
I see Garithos thrown around a lot in terms of justifying Alliance hate, but wasn't he more of a minor / bit player?
---
Damn, went full retard
---
Pre-3.0 horse is indeed much nicer, looks like it's cantering. Post 3.0 horse looks unnatural to me because front/back legs are moving in pairs (hitting the ground/in the air together) rather than independently. It would probably fall over if it was a real horse. I hope it's fixed :)
---
Those people seeing Classic form the first time and just rush B(oss). Gonna be fun.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to respec often between PvP and PvE it‚Äôs pretty much Priest or Paladin. 
---
30/0/21 Shaman can also work, though I‚Äôd go spec to deep Resto for serious content. But you‚Äôll be actually able to kill things and no other class would need on your rare caster epics.
---
It's interesting to see how these sycophantic clout chasers gather around TipsOut like flies on cow shit despite Tips being a) trash at the game and will actually hold them back during raids, b) is a manipulative manchild, and c) is an actual fraud irl, just to get some sweet Twitch bucks.
---
Is joke though?
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs more about taking gold out the economy for inflation control.
---
Ahhh, here you go - [https://imgur.com/a/j0Pi0gX](https://imgur.com/a/j0Pi0gX)
---
Yep. And we're getting 1.12 AV so seeing them will still be a rarity.
---
is it necrophilia if the corpse is fucking you?
---
Mana Tide is perfect though.
---
Nobody cares about that. What people care about is that when Asmongold logs on, any normal conversations on the chat channels cease, and are replaced by people spamming ‚ÄúINVITE TO ASMON LAYER PLZ‚Äù
---
Meh. A good player can overcome any racial ability.
---
Guys, you are not realizing there is an even simpler way to deal with this.  We out number the streamers.  Just don't adhere to the blacklist....problem solved.  There's more of us.
---
Home sweet home.
---
The fuck kind of proof do you want? Classic isn't out yet, of course it's all theorizing, because streaming wasn't a big thing when vanilla was out. Lmao thanks for stating the obvious?
---
Whatever you choose, some advice, stick with the class. I rolled alts all the time when I started playing rather than learning a class. I took me three to four times as long as it would have to level a character to 60 content if I just stuck with my first character. Leveling is fun but doing 1-30ish leveling over and over again is not very rewarding. If you get stuck with a class you don‚Äôt really like, try changing specs first. Multiple classes offer different play styles without having to reroll. Also leveling with a friend is easier and more fun so join a Discord or guild and get through those tough spots together
---
There are very few 2h weapons with healing stats. Not to mention any shield with healing stats would default to paladin anyway.
---
Noone can forget Alerted Valley...
---
I do put it in the paper sleeve and I do have a turntable
---
didn't know about the flip tho
---
Undercity is better.
---
That sub needs to exist.
---
I'm just saying that he is just a dick a lot of the time and when people criticize him his followers are like "It's just a joke haha its okay"
---
Nicceee
---
I haven't played retail since Cata.
---
You also don't speak for... literally anyone other than yourself? 
---
This is also a hilarious reason to justify rude, exclusionary behavior.
---
And as I explained in the comments below, at first glance, there's plenty in the above clip to make a tired dude watching more than just the characters on screen jump to the conclusion.
---
Preach bad as well
---
People know way more about the game that they did back in 2005, people demonize gold or mat farming, but with our current understanding of the game its way easier, even if you are a holy priest, you can go with gatherer proffesions like herb/minimg to make gold, or by default join dungeon groups like Strat Live runs for orbs and disenchant materials that you can sell. Having also alt characters will really help you in the long run. Respec costs are the one thing im not thay worried about come classic.
---
Add all of &lt;APES&gt; for EU, to make them look a little less lonely
---
That‚Äôs the last thing I would do. You‚Äôd just be overwhelmed by the fuckton of abilities all at once (especially mage). If you wanna learn mage, you have to level one.
---
Classic is so awesome, caters for all üòÑ
---
I can only play 8 hours a week or so and have a load of fun. 
---
They can play 100hourish a week and have their fun. 
---
Definitely not for me but go do you I guess.
---
Very nice, you should do more
---
Do you need to be defence capped?
---
You mean the guy that willingly got captures to be siphoned from?
---
Love this!
---
Correct, the stat weights are generalized.  When comparing whole pieces of equipment, stat weights make it clear which is better and usually by a long shot.  Because stats come in groups, it's easy to be fooled into using worse gear if you think one should always prioritize a specific stat.
---
Plan out what skills you need to buy upgrades for and the skills you can skip - if you buy every skill up to 40, zero chance you get your mount at 40.
---
This is so freaking awesome. I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!
---
I'd buy it
---
For pvp? I know shaman healing is great for pve
---
Never played back in vanilla , but i played a lot of vanilla private servers during/after WoD , and i always made my characters ding 60 in Winsterspring , such an amazing zone .
---
Has anyone tested RFD pick pocket runs? I remember in vanilla it was like 40g/hr just from the copper/silver, not including the boxes.
---
Which will consist of other streamers and their die hard fans. If a streamer with a dedicated fanbase in the thousands says this person is blacklisted, they will listen.
---
Eh. Seen it done with all classes at this point.
---
I saw a clip of them protecting Summit from getting ganked while leveling. It was pretty funny.
---
It‚Äôs not. The Shaman PvP meta is Ele/Resto hybrid.
---
Those orcs still look more like Warcraft orcs than anything ever actually added in WoW (Vanilla -&gt; BfA)
---
The crowd pummeler farm is greatly exaggerated - you would only use 1 charge per boss so generally this is 3-5 pummelers at most if you tank almost all the bosses in MC, for example.
---
95% of the gear comes from dungeons and raids, there's 1 pvp rep reward which is good and of course the rank 12-13 gear is good until AQ, but that's something other classes deal with too. So I don't know what you mean by a lot of odd pieces.
---
Also it's not really a maybe, druid tanks are in general better than warriors on some bosses, noticeably worse on a few others, and about the same on the vast majority of bosses. They're a good thing to have in a tank roster when you want amazing threat without sacrificing too much survivability and without having to gear up a warrior.
---
You're talking pvp? It just seems like the whole point of shamans is kinda pointless in pvp. I have totems, but a warrior charges me I have to bail and kite, so my totems dont mean much
---
The only thing on this list I'm going to have is water... smh :(
---
War stomp &gt; all.
---
At the end of the day, it's 100% Okay if you don't get your mount at 40. I normally get mine between 41-43. You can use herb/alch, skinning, or farming lucrative mobs with good vendor drops to help you along the way. You can skip nonessential skills, which will be the bulk of your expenses. If I recall correctly, skills will have cost you over 100g by the time you're 40 anyways... BUT, I'm not good at that. I like to have every tool at my disposal... so I just put up with not having a mount for 2-3 more levels. Quests really start to give more money at 40 anyways, so why stress?
---
I mean, back in the day people didn't realize a fury warrior was much better than a rogue. If you look at private servers, there's like 25 warriors and 2-3 rogues in a typical raid comp.
---
So if you wanna roll a class just for dps numbers, rogue is not your best bet.
---
Then next thing you know , *wipes* ‚ÄúAll my friends are dead.‚Äù
---
On a side note why does EU always kick the shit out of NA in almost every avenue of gaming?
---
a moderate amount of rat poison for a normal human is 0
---
False. It's Forsen. But he won't be playing that long.
---
This time around probably not too hard because you and everyone else is planning for it ahead, and understands what it takes to get. First time around most casuals didn't have it until 50-60.
---
Preach is from EU?
---
I haven't clicked that link yet but you can get 100fps+ from a geforce 8300 for classic. Unless their Twitter and other apps they're inputting are actually taxing.
---
Calling a random group of friends multiboxers isnt rude, exclusionary ben avoir?
---
Maybe dont jump to conclusions next time? That's how you ruin the reputation of innocents people.
---
Those legs...I never liked that ragni seems to skip lag day
---
You sir desperately misunderstand the reasons people don't want to play on popular streamer servers. This was clearly a knee jerk emotional response that wasn't thought you. YouTube "reasons to avoid streamer servers". Educate yourself.

Unless you have a better card and other stuff to plug into  it, then you could probably build a computer with better specs for same or less price. But not everyone can build one, so do what you do
---
Shammy is mostly utility. They‚Äôll need a WF totem for melee DPS in each raid, so they‚Äôll definitely bring a resto Shammy to help with that. You‚Äôll get a raid slot as a resto Shammy regardless. Shamans are generally the least played class and have a little more leeway when it comes to being other spec than a paladin, so you‚Äôll see plenty of enhance and ele shamans, and you‚Äôll certainly be picked over them.
---
It shouldn't affect shapeshifted attack speed, but if it does feral druid could be crazy.
---
Agreed, you can see all of the core WoW design in there.  Its just rough and unrefined.
---
Probably for the same reason that people like to meet celebrities, these people have the opportunity to play their favorite game with streamers that they watch frequently for entertainment. Also the MOTD was a joke.
---

Brings me back: https://youtu.be/6kXA7-XoQTA

Do competitive pre-mades take ele-resto hybrids often?
---
I dont think they did. I hadn‚Äôt accessed mine since 05/06. You sure you are using the right email-adress? Might be an old one.
---
Gross.
---
Pls ban, he sais a bad word
---
Of course you will do dps. It will be low but its dps. You buff before the fight. After that you‚Äôll fight whatever you fight. Just don‚Äôt expect to be anywhere near top dps.
---
We used to call them screenshots.
---
there are a ton of people in this thread, including you, that belief that every adult is mature and understanding. They aren't. You guys are naive for believing that simply politely telling a co-worker that you don't want to play with them anymore would have a 0% chance for affecting your job. This thread is a much lighter, but still valid, version of "don't fuck in the factory".
---
Ferals wouldn't profit, but spellpower paladins would
---
Morons have been intentionally griefing player-organized events since before streaming existed moron. Are you literally saying that griefers only fuck with streamers?
---
Why? He is from NA.

It's an anticoagulant, so anyone who needs to keep their blood thin. If you have atrial fibrillation, have had a mechanical heart valve put in, or have a history of clotting such as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Honestly though, one of the prime reasons it (warfarin) is used over other anticoagulants is that it has an antidote in case you take too much (vitamin K)
---
Sodasays has a nicer ring to it
---
I think the tougher part is getting into raids as ret... buffing shouldn't be your worry - but yes paladins have to buff often.
---
Original box is better
---
Tanking vanilla all the way to Ragge, no keybind. Seems leggit.
---
That's true, good addition.
---
Thrall did not mess around.
---
He was still sick last I checked. Hasn't said anything about returning. Don't expect anything big from him. Hope all the best though, he's a cool dude.
---
Get Engineer.  Escape Artist is a godsend for warrior.
---
Yeah.  That's awesome.  I know what my brother is getting for Christmas.
---
How in like, any logical sense did we fight that classic picture of Ragnaros
---
It took a long time when I was 13 and had no clue how to make money... didn't know I should save gold... =\
---
As long as you save your money except to buy some good bags it seems like it would be a lot easier this time around. But yeah, what others said, determine what skill ranks you should hold off on. Those were quite a money sink.
---
Build up your tolerance
---
Getting it is easy you just buy it along with the skill
---
But getting the gold... is a different thing
---
It's not about clearing content, it's about not wanting leechers making it take longer just because they can't put in the effort that everyone else puts in.
---
As a Ret you most likely won‚Äôt raid. The main rotation once you hit 60 is respeccing Holy or rerolling Warrior if you want to hit things with big weapons.
---
I thought you were just sitting until I scrolled down further and saw the whole thing
---
Offended me? No you did not, but you did make a post for the smallest thing ever, just like the "I just hit my first level 60" posts that's going to spam this subreddit. What you also show is the mindset of people like you spamming twitch emotes outside the platform, you are exactly the kind of person the majority of players are trying to avoid by not playing on streamer realms, have a nice day
---
Thats what I thought.
---
Props for trying but you're way off point.

\&gt; **Gift of the Wild** is the group version of the [druid](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Druid) [buff](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Buff) spell [Mark of the Wild](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_the_Wild).

A single coffee around 11 with water and a meal isnt bad. Energy drinks are bad news and a energy crash is bad.
---
Early morning, lean protein and not much of it to start your metabolism is also good. 2 slices of lean turkey breast for instance. Get hungry by noon, eat high energy sustaining food.
---
Junk food is just a bad idea. Salty food is a bad idea. 
---
Lots of water. Pissing is quick, and the benefits outweigh the time lost to piss. Even a flight from duskwood to westfall can be enough. 
---
If you currently drink a lot of coffee or caffiene drinks start upping your water intake now. Get your body used to it. You will feel better about it and need less caffeine
---
I will play 1-2 hours after work on my laptop I use for work also. I get some tea after 20 minutes and will go to bed early after taking a long shower. Thats sad times changing
---
Imagine witchhunting people for a joke
---
Organize a group of guards from each faction. Enough people would like this, esp with streamers, to want to kill anyone trying to troll
---
Sad!
---
Not very hard honestly. You‚Äôll most likely be honored or even revered by the time you‚Äôre 40, so you‚Äôll only need 80g or so. 
---
I just did a 1-40 speed run on a private server(blizzlike) and had 75g when i dinged 40 from just vendoring garbage.
---
didn't think people like you actually existed lmao
---
\*heh my favorite streamer said my name on stream after i donated $50, wow best day evur ecksdee\*
---
There won‚Äôt be much raiding as a Ret.
---
&gt; The main rotation once you hit 60 is respeccing Holy
---
Yeah that's what I heard from my friend who played vanilla... if you were a class that *could* heal people basically pushed you into it.
---
I enjoy healing though so while not optimal seems fun enough.
---
Sick story, too long didn‚Äôt read pussy xd
---
yeah, just be an asshole to a co-worker that may have power over your source of income in the future. Perfect plan.
---
why is wow and especially vanilla wow filled with moronic shitheads? The fact alone that you used "beta" in your comment already proves that your opinion is useless.
---
They can both tank 5 mans perfectly well, which you'll be doing a lot of prior to raiding.
---
People seem to forget that leveling and gearing takes the same amount of time as playing a single player game like 4 times over, you will get to tank plenty if you want to tank with druid or paladin.
---
Unless you kite him around in a circle with earth bind and frost shock him to death.
---
Forelands went hard tho
---
Yes, lives in Manchester I believe or somewhere near there.
---
Pretty much. Sounds like OP is used to completely running a pserver economy and maybe even selling services and doesn't want the competition. They could be from Onslaught, which was a pserver guild that spent years doing vanilla raids to kill bosses seconds faster.
---
I remember thinking of the early wow stuff looked like crap even back then.
---
Basically it's Apes who's a bunch of pserver owners, and then method whos a bunch of retail owners who has plans to own in classic as well.
---
Actual content creators with real personalities and skill, can you believe it?
---
Fire lands went hard tho
---
I think, if you wanted to call me out on rude, exclusionary behavior, you would say that about me calling multiboxers scum in general. Identifying this 'group of friends' *as* multiboxers by mistake is just a misunderstanding. 
---
Also, telling somebody not to jump to conclusions doesn't really make sense. Nobody *intentionally* jumps to a false conclusion. I commented with the information I had at the time.
---
Anyways, "go back to retail, **we** don't want *you*".
---
Seeing rag for the first time blew me away
---
Undead rouge cos I lack skill and am a scumbag
---
Play the best class in the game, a druid.
---
Powerful
---
Yes? That‚Äôs the idea Ele build regardless. It fucks people up. You‚Äôre more of a DPS and an off healer than a healer though.
---
Even abilities you know youll use for 60 can be effectively skipped. Like you could skip wrath and starfall as a druid leveling feral, or even push moonfire if youre hurting for cash. They arent mana efficient enough while leveling and level 1 moonfitr will be used for totem stomping or a few summons mobs make.
---
Ill buy, if you‚Äôre selling
---
You won‚Äôt get near 100fps in raids or cities with it.
---
There one thing that I rarely see anyone ever account for when doing these posts and that's attack speed. 
---
One of the main reasons to pick cat is that it has a very fast attack speed which means your uptime on frenzy is almost permanently.
---
Raptor as a slow attack speed and frenzy falls off all the time. Owl is the same shit. I'm not saying that owl is shit, and admittedly I haven't tested it extensively, but there is certainly something to be said about frenzy uptime for cats.
---
Focus doesn't work in Classic
---
You the man Poppaspanx
---
This is embarrassing to read
---
Because I've seen people call them multiboxers and I honestly cannot fathom why anyone would think that. It's completely impossible based on every clip I've seen of these guys. Even your statement of the clip was entirely incorrect. I rewatched it and they all dismount at very different times. The rest of your comment was basically making excuses, followed by "reasonable to come to that conclusion." I don't think it was reasonable.
---
Sorry if you can't handle someone questioning you on reddit.
---
Thanks! May look into a different prebuilt or possibly build my own
---
Just search "wow server datacenters"
---
NElves have the worst starting zone in all of WoW, while Tauren have one of (if not the) best. But after that come Darkshore and Ashenvale, and both are really really good, imho. So that alone is reason enough to pick Nightelf.
---
Time gnomes and the jimmy world of warcraft has to make a comeback
---
Eh, wowservers is way more toxic though so it‚Äôs not like retail players came in and tarnished an otherwise pure community. I think vanilla just attracts a lot of turbo spergs.
---
It's interesting to see how these sycophantic clout chasers gather around TipsOut like flies on cow shit despite Tips being a) trash at the game, b) manipulative manchild, and c) an actual fraud irl, just to get some sweet Twitch bucks.
---
i ment for raids, ithink even shaman can tank a 5 man.lol
---
People will argue human will be better option because of the weapon skills.  
---
And they will never know the true taste of Escape Artist + Death Wish to Intercept...  
---
The druid or the mage thats kiting you will taste something though...
---
Why does everyone want to avoid streams?
---
I know this isn't /r/HydroHomies but I feel as if I have way more energy/longer sustaining energy when I drink a lot of water vs. drinking caffeine.
---
Usually you‚Äôll make more money from levels 36-40 than you will from 1-36. 
---
Cooking is an absolutely amazing money maker in your mid 30‚Äôs
---
Not having dash is a big deal.
---
Cat attack speed is much faster. You will get nearly 100% uptime on frenzy with a cat. Frenzy falls off when using a raptor all the time.
---
Does anybody remember them lasting hours! I think my longest was almost 3 hours.
---
Look at all those unbound abilities... it's beautiful
---
Your opinion is wrong.
---
Nobody jumps to false conclusion on purpose sure. People jump to false conclusions without sufficient proof all the time. Like you.
---
It‚Äôs not clear who stream snipes though, and this has major potential for abuse against people just world pvping. 
---
There are several solutions Soda could use to fix the issue, but he has no interest in them. 1) Play on a PVE server. 2) Put a decent enough stream delay to avoid snipers. 3) Don‚Äôt stream Classic WoW.
---
From a European: what the fuck is a hot pocket and what the fuck is adderall?
---
does someone remember when alterac valley was full of npcs?
---
Might be better but it is not a home.
---
Availability of gear pushed hybrids into healing, too.  Look at tier gear--if a class could heal, all its tier sets were itemized for healing.
---
Necrophobia usually.
---
Underrated comment here.
---
Seriously?
---
Fmao
---
The forsaken look so damn dope in this trailer.

So you're saying healing shaman is good for pvp? Everything I've read says they go for dps hybrid
---
Or like you, assuming I played retail.

Man, spell reflect is such a fun ability!

I adore your humility and self-criticism, but he is absolutely wrong. You have not wasted your time nor spent too much of it.

Which I like, even though it would make it easier to do certain things. 
---
Now let‚Äôs hope they break mousover macro‚Äôs while yes they were doable in vanilla. Rogues should lose all cp when using an ability on another target. I say this as someone who will be rolling rogue at some point.

You heat them up?

Watching Alliance fan boys defend the Hitler metaphor that is Garithos and his storm troopers is always hillarious.

I can't wait until there is a third group that spends all of their time harassing the neckbeards in this group

Human Paladin because I'm a masochist.
---
You didn't question my reasoning - and didn't here, either. You dismissed valid factors in my perception as excuses, along with other points, or ignored them whole-cloth because it didn't align with your conclusion.
---
Yup, the bias is still there after all these years.
---
It won't even open the game.
---
For PvP it was nice too. Just have to place it in a bush so they don't see it lol

Upvoting for support - any addon devs know if this is possible?
---
Just realised that SW is also 30 min CD. It's pretty uncommon to use too. 
---
Also, in what situations do you regularly use tactical mastery? My only thoughts are the few bosses/areas with fear mobs? I might have missed something however.  Anger Management seems useful, though.
---
You have to use addons to recreate it.
---
If youre playing ret your raiding will consist of respeccing or making an alt

How can horde protect alliance?
---
It‚Äôs just the left portion of a keyboard setup in an ergonomic way with a d pad. You still use your mouse.
---
Garithos held the exact same title and position as Greymane does today. The only difference is he got it because everyone else was dead.
---
But he was the de-facto leader of pretty much the only organized Alliance forces left on the continent, hence why he command the armies of Iron Forge, the human kingdoms, and the Blood Elves.
---
Very well put together
---
I agree. But since alchemy has no benefits to level yourself,  it‚Äôs better if you just use a friend or guildie to make potions for you. Herbs are worth more than the pots on the AH, and the whole point is to get enough gold for your level 40 mount. This would be hard to achieve without at least one solid money making profession.

Honestly if you‚Äôre tanking you should be able to tank at a MT. There‚Äôs often not a big skill difference between MT and OT, just gear and guild status. 
---
If you‚Äôre scared to be a MT then you probably can‚Äôt handle being an OT, it‚Äôs not like the MT job is always harder. Sometimes you‚Äôll have the more difficult role in a fight.
---
Shit, going back to Minecraft then I guess /sad
---
Asmon is a cry baby bitch. Watch him play Zarathustra Basin, suck ass, and bitch about it.
---
Find a guild that let's you play the spec you enjoy. Plenty of non-optimized guilds will down a majority of the content.
---
Until AQ40/Naxx or possibly late BWL it won't even matter because the raids are not that difficult.
---
Hey, that is definitely data from the second classic stress test, we did a round of purging that data after the first :) We'll do another round of purging the elites from low-level zones soon :)
---
yeah but you don't know if part of it is still cold until you take a bite
---
you feel the outside and its really hot and then bite into cold
---
Troll shaman. Cause troll master race and I like throwing totems at my allies to make them work better
---
 Who gives a damn. Its so annoying hearing "mage and warrior do it better." I honestly don't understand why people judge classes by who tops dps charts.  To me mage and warrior both seem like boring classes and the lore is no where near druids for my personal interest.  When people feel the need to mention "don't expect to be a warrior" it discourages people from playing druids.
---
He was still groggy and not very well rested as he was awoken too soon.
---
Just takes one dot or something to ruin a duel. It would be unavoidable
---
Mage most likely
---
But still choosing between three
---
Mage, warlock and hunter 
---
Reason for each:
---
Mage;
---
I love mages and casting, burst damage is very fun plus easy to make money with being a mage and portals and levelling is easy
---
Warlock:
---
It‚Äôs basically the middle between hunter and mage, it‚Äôs a caster, has a pet, has a bit to keep in its bag but not too much (20 shards at all times atleast)
---
Hunter:
---
Has a pet which I like, not as squishy, but only problem is I don‚Äôt want to hold so much ammo and food for my pet in my bag at all times, I mained a hunter from Vanilla-Wrath and wasn‚Äôt a fan of doing that originally
---
Asmongold kiting a dragon to Stormwind is a non-issue. That shit happened constantly in vanilla and it will be happening again, streamers or no streamers. It is part of the charm and it is fucking hilarious when someone pulls it off.
---
I had no idea they dropped gear!
---
Aha, apologies. I was on mobile and did not see it.
---
We didn't mark anything as depreciated, that was on Blizzard's end during the Cataclysm revamp.
---
As the quests become available on Classic WoW and people send data with the Wowhead Client, their status is automatically updated to not be deprecated, and their locations show up.
---
Well said dad. Fantastic
---
You can still possibly run old school runescape if you need a nostalgia style game.
---
Thanks il add it, from what i can find, some sites say 30 rage, some say 30 energy aswell. Not 100% yet, classicdb my main site but wont load for me
---
&gt;I'm guessing you don't wipe with a poop sock.
---
This is why socks come in pairs.
---
If he was in the beta he wouldn't have this problem...
---
Players always been assholes though. Check out the video where they hold a memorial to a dead guildie, and a Horde guild crashes it, killing everyone. Hilarious but an asshole thing to do.
---
Stop casting macro for counterspell for mages. 
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast Counterspell
---
So you don't have to move to cancel your cast to then cast a Counterspell. This is built into interrupt abilities in modern retail wow.
---
Fresh in a way, just going Human instead of Night Elf.  
---
Human Priest, then Human Mage most likely.
---
If you want to play ret play retail. Classic won't have ever spec balanced against each other, now you know and won't complain once you realize youre not wanted for raids.
---
They do force you to rename if you get reported. Happened to Sodapoppin like 2 years ago.
---
All of which went unnoticed on my first viewing, yeah.
---
They made changes to av to make it not take as long and not to stalemate so hard. So some of these lengthy grinding quests in AV just take too long. Everyone needs to be looting corpses and turning in.
---
Okay let's outline your reasoning.
---
&gt;Characters of the same race with variations on the same name traveling together in the same direction dismounting at the same time.
---
Sure, if they all dismounted at the exact same time as if it were from the exact same keypress, I might think you have a valid conclusion *if that's the end of the incoming information*. But that's not what happened. But you're ignoring **the entire rest of the clip.**
---
&gt;At first glance
---
I doubt that many people watching this only once think this is a multiboxer
---
&gt;with half attention
---
okay
---
&gt;on a groggy morning
---
okay -- definitely not excuses btw
---
&gt;with the twitch chat talking about multiboxers
---
yeah twitch chat is known for not being braindead
---
&gt;it's pretty reasonable to come to that conclusion.
---
Sure, it's reasonable as long as you isolate the first 3 seconds of the clip, act like you didn't see the rest of the clip, and are easily influenced by twitch chat.
---
But fuck streamers tho, right guys? Sooo toxic
---
Like everyone as in those who bought the collector's edition or everyone including the pleb?
---
Being able to charge in and switch to defensive stance and have that 15 rage I'd usually enough for a shield slam after your first auto. So openers of every fight usually should have a use for tactical mastery. Plus you keep 25 rage if you switch to battle to mocking blow or zerker to zerker rage. 
---
Anger management tooltip is wrong, or misleading I guess. It does stop rage decay but how it does that is be generating 1 rage every 3 seconds.
---
Undead Priest because I‚Äôm an altruistic person and love helping others. Actually not, I just want quick dungeon groups, easy raid invites and epics and more wins in BGs.
---
Any idea around what specs I‚Äôd need to be able to manage high FPS and decent graphics settings?
---
Yep, we have started the process this week of manual data (hid a bunch of deprecated items from search, flagged unused spells like Black Arrow, added all dungeon and raid drops by hand).
---
With how many people play the stress test, it's in our best interest to allow all stress test uploads from the Wowhead Client, so the database is updated faster and also get a few Rag-in-Elwynn map markers, instead of ignoring it completely.
---
Incredible detail. Right down to the runes he's writing. Check the top line, it's all the same swirling "e" shape...except there are an increasing number of dots over each from left to right, probably indicating numbered columns. The "e"s start with 2 dots and increase by 1 each column, so the stylized portal in the top left could be the starting spot which starts whatever spell or ritual he's transcribing, as well as being the number 1. The artist put a lot of thought into everything here
---
I still have a Sword from the Horde-Elemental.
---
Then no. Guess youll have to suffer through hitting the M button occasionally. Sorry for sounding rude, I just don‚Äôt get your need.
---
Good luck tho! :)
---
No but it‚Äôs a good idea for now just to get a basic idea of what each class has available at 60
---
Reread my previous reply. Sent before finished.
---
Depends on what you mean with "fast enough".  There will have a fair bit of input lag + the lag to stream it back to your laptop.  If you can live with it it will be playable.
---
Back when FF14 Realm Reborn came out I used a remote desktop program on my cellphone to do crafting/gathering so yeah...
---
Not unreasonable. Which isn't to say I think it's accurate - I fully intend to play PvP either way, but I'd definitely feel the lack of an RP prefix. I could see the folks at Blizzard thinking that and not realizing how important the extra dynamic of PvP rules are to those who enjoy it, though.
---
Vanilla mouseover macros (and focus target addons) caused Rogues to lose combat points, IIRC.  Those macros/addons basically just swapped targets, used X ability, and swapped back.  There was no actual way to use an ability on any player other than yourself or your target.
---
Probably because they created the sylvanas model first and never got around to changing her because it wasn't important enough at the time.
---
Didn‚Äôt the night elf and the high elf use the same model, different skin color, until BC?
---
Wow people try to talk to streamers on the only beta PvP realm? Imagine that! Continue being a salted nut that you didn't get an invite.
---
Only spend gold on skills and repairs. Don't buy crap from the AH below level 60, you'll get xp no matter how bad your gear is. This is what i did and as far as i remember i got a mount near level 40.
---
Met them in game and whats even worse is I got to meet their fans. I cant wait to avoid them and I really hope blizzard herds all the narcissistic bottom feeders onto the same server so they can live out their reality TV show away from me.
---
Point of correction - trait trees were condensed into fixed specialisations in Cata and players gained a point every other level.
---
Okay. So in other words, your reasoning can be summed up with "I wasn't paying attention." Great. Thanks for clearing this up.
---
Cross Faction Collusion is against the rules even though it has existed forever. It's usually difficult to prove, which is why it goes unpunished.
---
You can literally play whatever you want. There were many ret paladins back in the day and there will be many more. It's a 40man raid. Having 1 ret pal isnt going to make or break a raid
---
Truth. Streamers have almost zero negatives coming with them. The only two big enough to disrupt severs are asmongold and sodapoppin. Otherwise there are only benefits of having them on your server. 
---
I think people are just jealous tbh
---
Is this it?
---
http://www.warcraftcinema.com/00120062001000523/TheStoryofBob.movie?u=9
---
This one is only 5:51 minutes
---
I‚Äôm not just talking about beta, this will happen in the real game as well. And it‚Äôs not ‚Äútrying to talk to streamers‚Äù, it‚Äôs hundreds of people spamming chat channels to get an invite to the streamer‚Äôs layer so they can stalk them and annoy them.
---
Agree. That wasnt nice. Dumb comments demand dumber answers.
---
Only saw that boss once in person, was during catalysm or WoD. Was disappointed that on legacy servers few people preformed turn ins
---
I can't recall it being that difficult, the first char I hit 40 with didn't have a mount straight away, but pretty close (think at 41 or so) and I was probably that person who bought every skill and upgraded using the AH. The char did have mining, but I used that almost fully for levelling engineering (which is also pretty pricey).
---
If you keep a good track of your cashflow (or perhaps go with two gathering skills till 40) you will have no issue getting a mount. It also depends on where you play: On a PvP server, you sometimes run into issues when on a gathering streak.
---
Christ
---
It's why it's important to get it first
---
&gt; All of which went unnoticed on my first viewing, yeah. Welcome to the dogpile. Hope you wore protection.
---
Nah. Not really dogpiling on you. Don't worry! Was just mentioning it.
---
Warlock and Shaman :)
---
carracter haha
---
Humar the pridelord and takk the leaper also honorable barren mentions.  Takk was super fast and Humar had black pride.
---
Uh, yeah? No shiz. It's like you didn't even read my original reply to your "question", where I stated off the bat that I watched this clip with half attention.
---
Almost like you were more interested in arguing and saw an *excuse* to start one. :thinking:
---
Did you really reply to a 6 day old comment with no irony? And you think a co-worker would fuck you over at WORK because they're shit at a GAME? And you think being honest with a co-worker is being an asshole? Good God, take a good, hard look at yourself, you're exceedingly beta.
---
because of wElFaRe loololololol
---
Yeah Feral tanks can use it pretty effectively. It's BiS pre-naxx irrc.
---
And while feral tanks are not as good as warriors, they can easily main tank all the way into KT as long as you switch to a warrior for Horsemen and Loatheb.
---
There used to be Rich Thorium to mine aswell in there, making those long AV's pay off!
---
He's not using SoR or any other flat source of SP scaling. SP paladin builds are abusing fast attack speed weapons to dish out serious magic damage off the back of their auto attacks. The video isn't showing any of that. 
---
A .5 speed weapon would be BiS for paladin forever.
---
I never could Play on Speed. Had to Dance or move around or Talk to people
---
I believe this (or the simple gameplay preview one) was on the Warcraft III CD, got me stoked for the next chapter, and wow, did it deliver.
---
You can still summon the Bosses in retail WoW
---
And vitamin D. And powered corn cob. And... nm here's the whole list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodenticide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodenticide)
---
Well said
---
It gives you mana, and spell crit %.  I don't recall the amount of int to spell crit, but it takes quite a bit iirc.
---
My lvl 5 bank had enchanting ( you needed to be lvl 5 to train a prof) and used to DE all the 60 BoE's that weren't worth much.
---
DE lvl caps weren't added until tbc i believe.
---
But achievements were added in wrath tho? https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.0.2
---
&gt; (But not like Black Mirror - Striking Vipers).
---
Suuuuuuuuure
---
I spent a lot of time in Firelands and wiped on Rag over 100 times. We killed him our first attempt the night of the nerf
---
&gt; We'll  have 120 raid members by AQ launch  with the ability to clear BWL with  no more than 30 people, not  including alts. That's at least 4 Scarab  Lords. And we plan on selling  every one of them to the highest bidder.
---
So OP just wants to make sure his group has full control over the server economy and make a business off it.
---
Playing on that server will be as bad - if not worse - for the average player than ending up on one that is chosen by some prominent streamers.
---
&gt; After 9 days, we will begin the plan of attack. They will be corpse  camped. They will be chain CCed. They will have their bags and mailboxes  filled with Heavy Leather Balls and Peeling the Onions. They will not  be able to tag a single mob in any zone they're in. This will be a  coordinated effort of at least 180 level 60 players. No amount of fanboi  spergs will stop us. 
---
And all of you will get banned sooner than later doing so.
---
You like streamers, some people don‚Äôt. Like you said, matter of opinion.
---
The Molten Core exploded.
---
Unarmored mounts wont come lul, dont get mad please..
---
Nope. The high elf NPC‚Äôs are similar to night elves, but frankensteined slightly to have upright ears and a slightly different posture.
---
jealously and paranoia from reading about them getting beta access and out-of-context titles.
---
How is an RP server different?
---
I duno man. I've never been able to quite understand why some people are so zealot like about being a specific faction.
---
If you are an RPer I get it, but if not then why does it really matter?
---
In reality, there will be a race to lvl 60 and probably a leaderboard on WoWhead.
---
I just got a new gaming laptop to play wow classic.... anywhere.... whenever...whereever...always my laptop... and wow classic.
---
Same model/skeleton yea, but the skins/faces are different
---
Heads up for someone that hasn't played wow.
---
Try to focus on your main first. Learn the game, your class, your server community... don't be so quick to think about alts when it takes an average 200+ hours to get to 60 :)
---
weaponskill is almost entirely useless in pvp.
---
Grubby!
---
I love the look of this! What is it exactly? Either way well done. Just need some spiced bread to go with it lol
---
This is better than I expected any anti-streamer mod would be, and covers all of the bases. Fantastic work! Keep on fighting the good fight.
---
What addon ?
---
A server with streamers will be full and toxic. I think the cap on vanilla was 2.5k players. Those servers will be a shit show.
---
Because this is classic where not everyone has to think and play the same like BFA :)
---
I... uh... huh - okay.
---
Zug zug.
---
What was that sick ass ball of lightning spell?
---
 It looks so native. I would like this game to stay alive for another 15 years
---
Premade salads are the best, I hate pug salads they always go flying in random places without permission.
---
Because of the zerg of people that follow them mainly. One guy made a video about how streamers are going to ruin servers and now everyone is claiming the apocalypse.

And what about enemy chance to dodge, parry and block etc.?
---
My people!
---
I don't know, some of them seem pretty arrogant to me especially soda. They shouldn't be trying to change the game and it's odd so many people take the options of these people so seriously but I guess I get it. I'm looking forward to when the game actually comes out and they fade away
---
Yeah, my bad. Accidentally popped my Retaliation CD there - plus, you're a cat. I don't think they're allowed in dogpiles.

Hand Cannon is bis for preraid. 
---
Once you get your leaf you won't ever use a gun again though.

Raid alive 11/11 ?

Doesnt seem very vanilla
---
Is there a reason why his model was changed and he got legs?
---
I get a 6 minute video of a Ragnaros kill on this page, are you seeing something different?
---
This is a diet for Zoomers. Real vanilla players will need lots of fiber and probably a height adjustable desk.

I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page that you chose to enter a reddit comment section and create a comment about a clip when you didn't even pay attention to it. Glad it's all cleared up. Have a great day!

Nice, looks pretty meh though

Can't you just read one of the other trillion posts about this?

Does "chance on hit" proc from ranged attacks?  Or is it only hits using the weapon ?

I still have a /yell macro for telling people to turn in blood at primalist thurloga
---
No!  #noChanges
---
To block you need a shield. To parry you need to be in front of your target with a meelee weapon. For miss it's the hit chance. It's all calculated with the level, that's why it's so important in raids. Bosses are level 60+
---
Oops. I guess my memory isn't as good as I thought. Well, we did it after the 3.0 patch then.
---
At 5:40 looks like a game of thrones prediction
---
it's different because streamers and their horde of fanboys are not going to be playing on RP servers. streamers do things that get them views. playing on a RP server will not get them views. nobody is going to watch a stream of a bunch of characters standing around, acting out a roleplay.
---
I think they should work on friendly targets at least
---
not every boss needs the same amount of healers and a suboptimal dps is better then no dps. Also paladins scale fairly well thanks to their blessings. 
---
i wouldn't worry too much. But expect to sometimes heal even if you're not specced for it. 
---
Ultimate try hard guilds will not take you but the average guild will struggle to fill 40 slots and reach a rough balance of classes to use loot efficient.
---
Think about it: 40 man to a raid and 8 classes. That means 5 players per class.
---
There are 3 healing classes. Druid, Paladin, Priest. If the encounter requires 15 healers then yes you will heal. If not, you're free to hit stuff.
---
Cata Rag was awesome. For all the faults with Cataclysm, the first two raid tiers were great.
---
Orc shaman here, peace be with you.
---
I remember when you could find a casino in org, don‚Äôt know how allowed that was by Blizz, but I lost my money a few times haha
---
BiS
---
Yay! Now i can play alone with 35 year old single men who never talk in chat, click on all their spells and smell like shoes! Can't wait boys. Man do I love being a monotone normie who never strays outside the lines in fear of social repercussion.

No, I dont think it can

---
I feel like a lot of ppl do this to feel better about their 1 button rotation in raids lol
---
Yeah me neither
---
If you can enjoy healing you'll eventually get epics to go ret and then you can go ret in pvp and lower tier raids
---
What happened there then
---
That looks great!
---
...what
---
I just don't care for the culture surrounding it. I don't mind streamers per s√©, just the rabid fans who believe that every word from said streamer is the Word of God. For example, I enjoyed Preach's older vids (where he talks about his adventures in vanilla), but holy fucking hell, it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure gets old when yet another fanboy posts/writes #TEAMPEACH
---
That, and the feeling that these """""""""""""content creators""""""""""""""  somehow seem to be referred to by developers and the community at large as a reliable source or haver of opinions seems... wrong. They are just people who like having a camera aimed at them 24/7. That's **not** admirable.
---
Epic, thank you!
---
No unarmored mounts! Who wants those ugly mounts anyway lol.
---
Took me a whole evening to stream an episode from the website!
---
I‚Äôd prefer to see new classic content than tbc and wrath
---
Were still going to see upgraded guards and maybe a boss or so. People arnt going to be 1 shotting and mobs will still kill people just as easy
---
Multiboxing doesn't destroy economies like botting... And outside of private servers,  botting is functionally dead for another year or two until the thieves make better lock picks. They'll be a few bots at launch that are recycled parts from WoWGlider, but they'll crash within a patch or two.     
---
     
---
It's the combination of multiboxxing with botting and dungeonbuddy that causes runaway inflation. Hard to report full bot teams if they stay in instances.
---
I dont think they personally hate people that stream, unless they envy them and are jealous. We hate what a streamers following will do to a server, especially in the long run. If the popular streamers didnt have hundreds of retards following them every step they take, and causing it to be unplayable for the people not interested in the streamers, it wouldnt be a big deal.
---
Its kinda like a family brings in 15 toddlers into a brewery, and they are running around screaming, and playing hide-and-seek. Most people would want them to get the fuck out, even though they dont actually hate them.
---
Arenas? Nah. Community organizer gurubashi arena events with 2v2 or etc? That could be fun. As long as people know there will still be fighting outside the arena lol, can‚Äôt avoid that.
---
This is why everyone says min-maxers have no fun
---
PVE: Shamans have the best utility (Horde)
---
PVP: Totems are phenomenal, Grounding, Tremor, earthbind, even poison cleanse) Chain heal is king in AV. Just stand back and heal all of your melee pushing. And you have second best mobility after druid.
---
Priest great because of mana burn, but I find them really lack mobility. Keep in mind priest cant remove poisons just like shamans cant dispel magic.
---
I mean... Classic Ragnaros doesn't look as good as that drawn epic image either
---
Increased weapon skill over 300 is mostly only relevant on mobs &gt;60, in PvP it doesn't help the same way as in pve.
---
The first and second wars are largely just the horde invading and the alliance defending themselves, and eat the time it‚Äôs a pretty clear black and white good guys vs bad guys.
---
Likening it to the Germans being dicks isn‚Äôt a very good comparison for two large flaws.  
---
 The first: we‚Äôre talking about an entirely different species. These aren‚Äôt other humans, these are alien creatures that, for all intents and purposes, are literal demonic monsters. 
---
The second: The orcs did nothing to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for the first and second war. Invading demons arrive from another dimension, rape, pillage, burn their way across the country side, and humanity bans together with dwarves and elves to defend themselves. After finally stopping them, what EXACTLY was the Alliance supposed to do? Find a nice place for them to live where they could farm the land and begin a peaceful trading and farming community? Maybe settle them on the smoldering remains of the families and lives they ruined? The ideal solution would have been to boot them back through the portal, but the Alliance did their best to destroy it.  
---
The orcs are the *worst* kind of creatures in any setting that I absolutely despise in both IRL and fantasy genres. They‚Äôre a ‚Äúraiding‚Äù culture. They can sing songs all they want about heroism and honourable battle, but at the end of the day their society survives by inflicting theft and violence on the societies around them. (The Ironborn in GoT are a great example. Sure they have cool lines and mythology, but at the end of the day they‚Äôre literally a vicious and parasitic culture who pat themselves on the back for defeating unarmed men in battle and killing women and children). And this was well before the taint of the fel and the whisperings of the burning legion.  
---
There are supposedly peaceful orcs who don‚Äôt WANT to be raiding orcs and who fought against the idea of pillaging Azeroth. Good. Thrall wanting to pursue peace is also awesome. Good. Most of Warcraft 3 is trying to flip the genre on its head, making the monsters the good guys and the humans the bad guys. We get to see some real shitbag humans, but it‚Äôs not like this behaviour just comes out of blind Nazi esque Arian race supremacy. 
---
Their treatment of the Orcs makes complete sense. The most common view of them is monsters and beasts, when humans first discover that they can behave honourably and be noble, it is a legit SHOCK to those who witness it, and they then immediately begin spreading the word that the orcs are NOT just monsters (see Tirion Fordring and Eitrigg).
---
Once the monsters broke out of prison and escaped, why would the humans imprisoning them NOT try to hunt them down? These world threatening demons who rocked your entire planet escape, oh well, might as well just let them go? Hunting them down and trying to recapture them is just common sense, and no doubt there are going to be plenty of ‚Äúevil‚Äù humans who just want to kill the monsters rather than imprison them again. But for the humans who‚Äôd seen DECADES of these creatures as monsters who caused so much completely unprovoked death and suffering, not only is their perspective understandable, but it‚Äôs extremely easy to agree with them that these monsters need to be put down. The orcs being ‚Äúactually peaceful‚Äù is a borderline RETCON, but it‚Äôs going to take a LOT to reverse Azeroth‚Äôs opinion of invading demons.
---
Then there‚Äôs the horrible treatment of the blood elves, while a shit move, it does not come completely out of left field. The elves were the humans close neighbors for centuries, but never helped them unless they needed something from them. The elves had the secrets to magic, but only agreed to teach a small number of people how to use it in order for the humans to help them win their war for them. They refused to join the Alliance to help drive off an extremely dangerous otherworldly force until their lands were in danger. Now, at a time when two entire human kingdoms have been almost completely eradicated, do they make any attempt to help the humans with everything they have, and only because half of their lands got swept through by the scourge, and all the while they are complaining about how this is the worst thing to ever happen to the elves, and rename their race in honor of it. It's understandable why some humans would hold a level of contempt towards them.  Again, still a shitbag move, but it‚Äôs not out of nowhere.

Thrall‚Äôs Horde HELPED save the world in Warcraft 3, but they are by no means the only ones who did it. The Night Elves made a massive sacrifice and you can even argue that the only time the Horde is actually making any kind of amends is because the entire planet itself is in danger. Yes, there‚Äôs good among the Horde, but their action in WC3 is hardly blind altruism, there‚Äôs a massive helping of doing it for their own survival.
---
Moving on to World of Warcraft, for every 1 Thrall there are 10 Garrosh. There is a CONSTANT cycle of the Horde being the aggressors, pillaging and attacking, and when they alliance gears up to retaliate someone in the Horde says sorry and the Alliance backs down.  
---
The forsaken plague bombed Gilneas (it wasn‚Äôt Alliance territory at the time, but this is hardly a peace loving Horde who just want to be left alone).
---
ALL of Ashenvale (Astranaar, Forest Song, Maestra's Post, etc) are the Night Elves trying to defend their ancestral homes against aggressive Orc expansion and the Forsaken experimenting on Druids.
---
South Shore/Hillsbrad Field is continually under attack by the Forsaken until it‚Äôs converted to the Sludge Fields.  
---
The WRATHGATE?
---
Garrosh attacks and destroys Theramore.
---
Garrosh attacks and tries to wipe out Lor'Danel, which is basically a refugee town founded after the shattering in Cataclysm.
---
Pyrewood is the result of the Forsaken attacking Gilneas, the Alliance take it back, then the Forsaken take it a second time and burn it to the ground.
---
And of course Sylvanus burned down Darnassus ‚Äòout of fear the alliance might one day attack them‚Äô and plague bombed her own people AGAIN in Undercity rather than return the ancestral home. 
---
It‚Äôs a continual cycle, and the number of counter events of the Alliance being unprovoked aggressors are far, far fewer in number (Like Bael Modan is the dwarves being shitheads, digging on Tauren Holy ground.) But even when you have events like the Alliance growing a shred of a backbone, they have heaps more honour than the horde. Events like Camp Tarurajo and Dazar‚Äôalor see the Alliance actively sparing and protecting *enemy* civilians while the Horde‚Äôs similar events involve burning fleeing civilians alive. 
---
**TL:DR Yes there are ‚Äògood guys‚Äô in the Horde and there are ‚Äòbad guys‚Äô in the Alliance. It‚Äôs meant to be grey. But you need to do some SERIOUS mental gymnastics to blind yourself to the staggering amount of flat out atrocities the Horde have piled up for themselves over the years vs the Alliance.  It‚Äôs not even close to being a balanced scale.  I wouldn't for a second say everything the Alliance has ever done is virtuous and justified, but the VAST majority of ‚ÄúAlliance aggression‚Äù are just events of the Alliance defending themselves or counter attacking.**
---
They didn't become capable of tanking until the very end of vanilla.   But by then the stigma that they can't tank was already set in stone, and the vast majority of the druids didn't have the gear to tank regardless.  So there were only a handful of bears in vanilla tanking raids.
---
FL Rag is fuckin great tho
---
Iirc that was not the case.
---
Don't forget your $1,200 Herman Miller chair. Absolutely essential
---
Heck, it's only been about a month since i've seen both of them in a single game
---
The decisive nature. Fights end fast. Modern WoW has buffed healers to be ridiculously overpowered compared to dps and they don‚Äôt even run out of mana anymore. Everyone has defensive cooldowns and you do reduced damage to players so it‚Äôs impossible to have a quick fight. In classic your decisions matter more simply because you don‚Äôt get as many of them. Some people prefer the long fights and that‚Äôs okay. But I find it more interesting when you can die from a split second mistake.
---
No electronic form?
---
I think i grinded a few thousand furbolds to get that one furbold rep up. I was out of quests (or so i thought) so figued I'd get XP and rep at once.
---
Shadowmeld can't be used in combat
---
If you can't take adderall without getting addicted to meth, then yeah, don't take any.
---
They said it would be limited to starting zones........... like in that same fucking post
---
Ingot Aida‚Äôs bag on the eighth slime in the beta. It‚Äôll probably be the 800th for actual launch
---
Great job. If I wasn't so lazy I would gank him too. But I'm a shitty Level36 Warlock with like 1300hp and 65 Spellpower :x
---
Just throwing it out there, looked at any shadow priest guides for vanilla? Tons of fun, actually easier leveling than most people realize with little downtime. As well as insane face melting damage and melee damage reduction from shadow form. Plus being able to off heal or even flat out just heal 5 mans if you were ever inclined.
---
I remember back in the day, I used "Finkle's Lava Dredger", pretty decent stats for a healing pala without loot priority or DKP! Also, it looked really cool if you were an engineer.
---
you can get 40 fps on a potato for classic so you should be fine
---
Hi, /u/SneakyPete05
---
Trust me, be a mage as first character, you farm tons of gold.
---
Stumpy ones at that.
---
Love the lighting on the tauren - feels cozy
---
thanks man! I'm kind of an altoholic haha. I'm definitely gonna focus on my main but.... you know how it goes.
---
2 monitors? Alt-tab?
---
As a hunter main, I'll miss:
---
- Pet AI, pathing improvements.
---
- having tracking on the mini-map drop down menu.
---
- bigger range and no dead zone
---
Also, will miss the updated character models. I wish there was a toggle for classic imo.
---
New shoes smell nice.
---
Oh man, this takes me back. I didn't have a second monitor or a machine powerful enough to sustain tabbing in and out to check the guide, nor did I want to spend a bunch of printer ink on it, so I had a little pocket notebook and I would jot down sections in abbreviated form before closing my browser to log into the game. For this reason I still secretly think of Splintertree Post as SplintertP.
---
Yeah, just like how I got lucky with a BOE epic gun on ShiteFlinger. Won't happen again on classic :/
---
TBC was loved by a very large number of people and barely anyone saw Illidan or Kil'jaeden.

idk why this is the comment that makes me wish I was taking time off for the classic drop, but it is...

*You're delusional.
---
Majordormo, escort these champions to the graveyard.*
---
&gt; Naw. He's blacklisting you if you screen snipe and harass him repeatedly.
---
And how exactly will he know that? What prevents him to just get ganked and then decide it was sniping?
---
Plus the horns starting to grow from his head (or maybe a scalp piercing), plus the organ with an emblem of a demon's head. Definitely a warlock.
---
Hey, something I have an answer to!
---
Put your microwave on 50% power and double the cooking time, flipping at the half-way point. If you find this is still not evenly cooked, do 25%, quadruple the time, and flip 3 times!
---
Its very true. We started a campaign for it at work. I likely was chronically dehydrated and needed the coffee to get through the day. Started increasing water and i didny even want a 2nd or 4th cup of coffee anymore. 1 is enough
---
The old high elf models were really bizarre looking. Probably just thought the night elf model looked better.
---
I was too poor to have two monitors.  I don't even think I considered the concept back then.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not judging, I did the same thing. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs beautiful because it‚Äôs true vanilla experience.
---
Of course. You'll just be in the casual wave of raid clears. This is how I was in Vanilla and I had a blast.
---
Yeah it is fast enough to check the action house and simple stuff thats it :(
---
Wow is a big grind. You can put as much time as you want into it. There's no end.
---
Hot pockets are cheap microwave food and adderall is a combination of amphetamine + dextroamphetamine, used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy
---
I'll pass on the fat pockets and lardritos, thank you.
---
Back then a big part of players played like this, nowadays this will not work more (‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†‚úø)
---
They were doing a twink speedrun of MC or something and he got whispered by a GM and disconnected in the middle of the run to change his name. That's all I remember.
---
I made the mistake of saving my images back then to imageshack =/  They went from ad supported to subscription based, by the time I found out they were already holding my images hostage behind a paywall =/ Long since deleted now.
---
Your microwaving it in that little holder that comes with it aren‚Äôt you? I have had the same problem and that‚Äôs why I stopped using it. What I do is wrap it in a paper towel then throw it in, the towel soaks up all the stuff on the inside that leaks out and also the water from the hot pocket from it‚Äôs defrosting, then you can just roll it onto a plate
---
I've commented something similar in a few posts. I'm with you. I've stopped even watching streamers. I think I need to stop checking this sub so much, the days till launch thing really makes the wait drag out. I want to go full boar balls to the wall on release. I'm 30 and may book a few days off even lol.
---
This is awesome &lt;3
---
Yeah that's what I assumed
---
I started playing in bc and have always wanted to summon these gods to play in av. I can‚Äôt wait to attempt this again lol
---
No you are not, same here bro.
---
He recently moved to the UK
---
Hell yeah, I remember having to click ability's because I ran out of keys that where close enough. So yeah later on I discovered modifier keys and then later macro keyboards
---
I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôve even stopped playing pservers so much to give myself a break.
---
My take:
---
1 glass of water every hr with a max of 4 glasses every 2 hrs because you can actually die of too much water and if you drink too much you start seeing similar symptoms as you would if you drink too little water.
---
Bathroom breaks are worth but keep them short, taking a shit clears your mind and lets you keep the momentum mentally.
---
Stand up and do something every 2hrs minimum to stay in tip top shape mentally and never lose to a would be-ganker
---
Jerk it
---
Dont eat shit food as it makes you tired, the 2nd can of pringels can wait
---
Dont drink anything that isnt water, yoghurt, milk. Caffine makes you crash, sugar drinks make you crash.
---
Dont do drugs, they need to be maintained. Instead increase your natural skills to not even need the drugs.
---
Clean your BATTLE station
---
Play the game in the sun if possible
---
100% Get some better ventilation for your room or atleast get a plant so you get better oxygen which in turn basically give you Arcane Intellect IRL.
---
Keep showering to a minimum of 3 days between each time showering.
---
Do not get a shitbucket, it will subcoinciusly get you off your focus
---
Nice.  I had very little money too.  I 'borrowed' the printer at work and smuggled the pages out in a backpack.
---
This is by far the most important pre raid bis list I've seen so far.
---
I'm not saying we wont see them, but it will be a lot more rare than a lot of people remember.
---
I click a few of my spells in retail and I'm still good at PvP and PvE
---
I have a shirt that I love and has raggedy neck lining and holes all over.  
---
I consider that shirt a legendary and will never throw it away.
---
Yeah I know. I think I was still using dial-up
---
A lot of this is valid but some of it seems weak. I'll try to address some of the things I think people are too hard on retail for.
---
&gt;portals from Shattrath to Stormwind and Orgimmar
---
While this is certainly a good point that, I think that the only thing this changes is time spent on a FP to the Dark Portal, then a FP from Nethergarde or wherever to your city of choice, plus a boat ride if it's in Kalimdor. The content missed out on by using these portals is content that you've technically already played 1-60, so here the "difficulty" is nothing but added wait time.
---
&gt;talent point trees were removed
---
I was for the longest time in the "new players who like getting a talent point at every level because it makes them feel feel like they can customize their character" group, but I only recently realised that this is completely manufactured and there really is no reason to not go the most optimal route. At least the new talents seem more meaningful because they can significantly impact your play style, not simply give you small % stat boosts that eventually accumulate. The real problem here is Cata specs that restricted you into set playstyles - a system with which I disagree completely but the new talents do work better under this system than the original ones do.
---
&gt;They also changed all the zones to scale with your character.
---
The experience of getting owned by a skull bear, I think, is more about nostalgia here. Scaling zones are probably one of the best things of recent because they allow you to experience the content in zones at your own pace and not worry about outleveling the place. Don't we want more people in the world? This helps people wanting to experience questing and grinding do so more freely. Plus, the zones aren't 10-60, they're in ranges.
---
Everything else, really, you're right about.
---
Holy always had a shield, because you can get more spell power that way
---
‚ÄúGuys wtf focus‚Äù got me hard lol
---
Yeah the question is what weapon he will be using and trying to get his hands on.
---
Of course you can. There will be guilds for everyone. The biggest grind will be getting to 60. After that, all that‚Äôs really mandatory is Raid attendance, and you will be able to play whenever you want at other times to get preraid gear, level professions, and other stuff.
---
However, that is not to say you won‚Äôt end up addicted, and forgo social expectations, on a desire to play a ton of classic. It‚Äôs all up to you mane.
---
How many servers will there be at launch? I want to know solely to know how hopeless I should feel.
---
Have you looked here
---
http://www.guildwarsmovies.com/movieview.php?id=1380#mirrors
---
I can't view it, because I don't have a premium account. But it could be possible. But it might be the exact same database as warcraftmovies, and be the same bad link.
---
Warrior 100% it‚Äôs the class to play!! Race I‚Äôm not too sure yet
---
I‚Äôm of the same mind but for a different reason
---
I didn‚Äôt play Vanilla. This isn‚Äôt a return to what was for me. 
---
It‚Äôs purely a new, fresh experience. 
---
And I want it to be that way from the beginning. I haven‚Äôt checked to see if I have beta access and if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt take advantage of it. 
---
I want my first time logging in to Classic to be a true first time into Classic
---
Classic is WoW 2.0,  Classic is not Vanilla. Layering, no-blood issues, loot trading, menu auto-loot, 1.12+ itemization etc. 
---
Enjoy your WoW 2.0 when it launches.
---
He got an updated model because he was the final boss of the Firelands raid in cataclysm, and in the heroic version of the fight he‚Äôd burst out of the pool of magma he was in, revealing that he‚Äôd had an entire lower half of his body the entire time that we never saw in Molten Core because the summon was done incorrectly by Executus
---
Same here brother
---
Paladin weapon 110%! To cast them undeads with FIRE!
---
1. The addon only uses chat functionality. To break this addon would mean breaking just about every addon.
---
2. Cross faction collusion has not been against the EULA in several years, it's actively encouraged in Retail.
---
3. A streamer's personal army is very weak. They're usually not max-level, have no gear, and will suffer even more than the streamer from The Blacklist. All we need to do is make the streamer too miserable to want to continue on our server and that is easy regardless of how large their army is.
---
Warrior is the only hybrid that won't be forced to go healer in a hardcore raid
---
Even as a very novice rider, I'm pretty sure you shouldn't have to post on a canter. The "skirted" animation looks absurd.
---
I read that too, but why is it like that? What are the percentages of additional weapon skill levels?
---
Large rope net: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=835
---
A consumable that roots the target for 10 secs, really useful for PvP, easy to farm if you are alliance, as the only mobs that drop this are murlocs in westfall.
---
Cons: This item doesn't stack, so you need one bag slot per net
---
Magic dust: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2091
---
Also from westfall, but this one is dropped from those elemental. Put the target to sleep. Really useful for leveling, pvp and maybe dungeon if you need some extra cc
---
The men in their early 30‚Äôs playing classic wow are the same ones who no life raided in their teens. That is exactly who i want to play with. Cant smell them over the internet anyway.
---
My main was a Draenei shaman, my first was a human warlock. I've always been Alliance, so it'll be hard switching in order to keep my shammy. I might be up for a switch though. Either way I'll most likely keep a healer as my main though cause it suits my personality.
---
Warlock, you have way more utility then a rouge
---
If someone responds to me, I respond to them, and generally in the same fashion. That's just basic courtesy.
---
And if someone asks a question I can answer, I'll try to answer.
---
Funny that you said that, though. I just ultimately chose *not* to respond to this dude's self-satisfied "last word" needling. Felt my reply and understanding of his behavior was potentially a bit too genuinely hurtful.
---
No, they can change the functions of the API to make addons no longer be able to work. But since the addon only uses chat, they'd have to break just about every addon to ban ours.
---
Undead priest, leaning towards male, but I keep hearing good things about female, like that they flip.
---
Streamers didn't exist in Vanilla. This is #nochanges.
---
Are you me?
---
this is /pol/ tier autism.
---
I'm afraid you might have misunderstood them about just how stickied you are to the layer you log into.
---
When you log in, and start a play session, you will get placed in a certain layer, let's say Layer 2. 
---
If during this active play session, population fluctuates on the active layers to the point where, in this example, Layer 2 empties out, you will not stay in Layer 2 regardless of having started your play session in it, and will get reassigned and transitioned over to Layer 1, to make sure you are in a populated world.
---
That's because as Omar explained us, layers are dynamic and flexible. Not static. Therefore, depending upon current population demands, layers can flexibly adjust to this demand. And to do that, they switch players accordingly into their respectively populated layers, even if they originally started their play session elsewhere.
---
.
---
True, but you might have to worry about having a shit sense of humor.
---
What char did you run?
---
Great effort post! Interesting read, thanks for taking the time.
---
There appears to be a staff of dominance in the picture but it might not be the one on his back
---
It's easy. Just like in real life, if you know how to save money, you will get what you want. Most players usually have their 90g around lvl 35.
---
Ofc, you will also need to loot everything, and loot a lot (grinding). But, grinding will be enjoyable.
---
You'll be fine.
---
Getting it at level 40 you will need to save some gold while leveling but getting it at level 41 is very easy. I like using my gold to level, buy bags and not save the couple coppers you make at level 10. It's so much easier to get gold when your higher level.
---
Dooo itttt
---
I'm buying a 4,200‚Ç¨ Arne Jacobsen chair myself, can't put a price tag on a working back and neck
---
What's that one vanilla friends website again?
---
I don't think it's really an unpopular opinion. Cataclysm did a lot of things wrong, but Heroic Rag was not of them.
---
Yes, most of my vanilla screenshots look this way. It's terrible. Around the last 6 months or so of vanilla I smartened-up and rebound movement to ESDF and all my ability hotkeys to the keys around that. But I look back at the first 1.5 years of vanilla and always am reminded of my terrible keybindings, haha. :D
---
Mouseover macros.  
---
Stop attacks after expose armor so I can sap, expose, restealth and open.  
---
One button macro to switch between herb and mining finder. 
---
Startattack incorporated into nearly everything.  
---
Equipslot macros so you can one button spam to equip dagger and backstab/ambush, and likewise pull that sword back out for SS/Hemo. 
---
On my warrior I had a stupid amount of macros based around stance dance and action perform, weapon swaps, and so on.  There was a script to charge in combat too. I probably had more warrior macros than my other classes combined.
---
Also spammable macros, like only enter battle stance if not already in battle stance, so you don't lose a global cooldown.
---
Take a look at those high elf models. They‚Äôre very unfinished and look awful.
---
Still torn between Dwarf Priest and Human Pally, with an alt of Gnome Warlock or Gnome Mage. 
---
Want to main as a healer. Pros for Pally: Super efficient, has cool offspecs to goob off with, free 40 mount and cool questline for 60 mount, blessings are OP. Cons, more boring playstyle in raids, and you really almost never go for tier gear, and only cloth. Priest pros, very large healing toolkit, easy to level, they look awesome with the gear they wear. Cons... no 40 mount lol, can't think of any others. Still feel more persuaded towards pally main though.
---
This makes me super nostalgic. I almost want one now, just to have it
---
It is not bannable. You are free to advertise your prejudices against one person in chat all you want so long as it's not sexist, racist, and a few other things specifically mentioned in the EULA. You are free to refuse groups, trades, chat, and auctions from whoever you want. You are free to broadcast the location of your enemies to your entire faction. And you are free to automate UI and chat functions with an addon.
---
That view distance rating is so nostalgic for some reason
---
Oh shit. Sorry I could have googled this, just wondering from a gamer perspective. So it‚Äôs just easy food and something to keep you alert?
---
You should play Warcraft 3 instead of spoiling your self
---
blizz have broken several addons in the past that run off code that's integral to the game and i'm sure they'll continue to do so regardless of the repercussions on other addons. they know addon developers will update/fix their addons regardless of what blizzard does, so it doesn't matter at the end of the day
---
cross faction collusion isn't against bfa's tos, but i'll certainly be enforced in classic. you're deluded if you think otherwise
---
also, you heavily underestimate the lengths people will go to get recognised by their favourite streamer. a lot of soda's core audience plays wow and i'm sure he'll have no problem at all outnumbering anti-streamer sperglords, same with asmongold, esfand, etc etc
---
i'm not backing them up btw, i'm simply just stating facts. whatever 'war' you wanna win has basically already been lost. blizz are guaranteed to announce realm names prior to launch because they're allowing people to reserve character slots on august 13th. just pick a realm that the streamers aren't going to play on, simple as that
---
I don't think you can get into old IF in the beta I've tried a few times.
---
Oh. It look like just a scaling filter lol
---
Southshore for SFK and probably SM too.
---
Garithos was in charge of the human survivors after the plague had ravaged Lordaeron. Because everybody higher up on the chain of command had died, he became the de-facto leader of the Alliance (which was pretty much in shambles at that point). He interacted with two factions which are part of the horde today: the Blood Elves (then led by Kael'Thas) and the Forsaken.
---
Garithos hated the blood elves (presumably for abandoning the Alliance after the second war), and sent them on a suicide mission. After the blood elves survived that mission with help from the Naga, Garithos sentenced them to die for conspiring with the enemy. The Blood Elves escaped with the Naga to outland, where we find them in TBC.
---
After that, Garithos and his group of survivors encountered the Forsaken, a group of scourge which broke free from the Lich King's grasp, and we're now out for revenge. Garithos and Sylvanas made a deal, where the humans would help the Forsaken with killing the Dreadlords which had taken control over Lordaeron, and in exchange the Forsaken would leave the Capital City for the alliance. However, after the Dreadlords had been beaten, Sylvanas betrayed Garithos, killing him and his troops and taking the Capital City for themselves.
---
I got rank 10 back in the day as flag carrier in a premade group on Horde side but we were vastly imbalance population wise on the server, 30/70 Horde Alliance so we had instant queues and less people to compete against to rank up.
---
I don't remember it being super hard... I played every day though for a few hours. Was awesome fun - can't wait to do it again.
---
How much of a difference is the purple set from the blue... I just want the full blue set tbh
---
Thanks, that was the information I was looking for!
---
To summarize; each weapon skill &gt; than the enemy defense skill adds 0.04% reduction to enemy dodge, parry and block chance. Disregarding block, since not a lot of PvP characters wear a shield, 0.08 % chance to not-get-parried-or-dodged is added. Additionally, it adds 0.04 % to hit and crit. With my example of &gt; 13 weapon skill that results into 0.52% hitchance added, 0.52% critchance added and 1.04% not-get-parried-or-dodged.
---
For some reason I've been having some issues with iOS Safari and Chrome browsers making the spells un-clickable. It should work fine for modern browsers on PC/Mac and iOS Firefox.
---
Yup just don't expect world first... just like any other game :)
---
Shamans will heal in raids. Ele and enhance are trash dps.
---
Wasn't it done in the spirit of the person who loved wpvp?
---
He's a bit too loud for my taste
---
Your answer is in the FAQ. Essentially, at first, it does not discriminate between any type of streamer. Then it will be up to the realm's community to decide.
---
Thanks for the info dude. Appreciate it.
---
Yeah, same DB as warcraftmovies. Thanks for the effort though.
---
It also gives spell dmg and it was an upgrade for us?
---
Blizzard has never once suspended or banned anyone for any use of any addon.
---
After they introduced the chest it was pretty crowded there even on my mid-size EU server.
---
I say warlock is better if you want to PvP.
---
Shadow sucks for PvP, I would say best spec would be disc.
---
It just so happens that I kept BOTH copies I made ;)
---
Correct!
---
This is priest specific, so I'm not sure if it counts, but "Spectral Essence" which is first used to communicate with spirits in Caer Darrow outside of Scholomance can also be used to see Eris Havenfire outside of Stratholme. She is the quest giver for "The Balance of Light and Shadow", the quest for the priest staff - Benediction/Anathema.
---
Eris Havenfire was supposed to only be seen with the Eye of Divinity, but using this a priest could get the Splinter of Nordrassil and the Eye of Shadow before even stepping foot in Molten Core.
---
Spectral Essence allows all classes to see her, not just priests. It also allows others to watch the priest do the quest - as long as they stand still and out of the way, they won't get whacked by The Cleaner.
---
This addon doesn't too!
---
Ele is a terrible raid spec.
---
Let me role-playishly flavor the scourge of streamers dangit.
---
that really pissed me off. nobody is forcing you to RP on RP servers, but if you aren't gonna do it, just mind your own business and leave the RPers alone. don't go around interrupting roleplays. and don't come in with a stupid non-RP name. I hope Blizzard really cracks down on enforcing the naming rules for the Classic RP servers.
---
We got him!
---
Jame's was great.
---
Congrats bro!!! As a fellow married man I support your decision. Hopefully you at least got into the beta!
---
Yeah, if I recall, TS went crazy haha
---
I'll get nuked here, but I hated bg pvp. The best day ever was when blizz separated twinks from normal pvp bg's. I refused to play after getting one shotted 30 to 50 times in wsg from twinks. Worst example was a lvl 31 mage one shotting my lvl 39 rogue(think that was Cata). Mind you my rogue had all greens and blues from instances. So even hitting my rogue should have been difficult, but one shot for 1800+hp? At lvl 31? wtf? This is what you'll face in battle grounds.
---
This is where I did my 58-60 grinding on my troll mage, too!
---
Paladin should just be flash of light

Sorry it took you so long to understand! I know empathy may be difficult for you to learn, but you'll get there if you keep at it. Best of luck champ!
---
Honored to be your "first" conversation on reddit - have a fantasticular afternoon!
---
You are a little too high strung dude.
---
No. Classic and Retail will use the same EULA. All Blizzard games use the same EULA. You're delusional if you think they'll have a different EULA for a game that's included with another paid game.
---
It really won't matter how many spergs the streamers have. The same-faction griefing will be enough.
---
&gt;  just pick a realm that the streamers aren't going to play on
---
Many of the streamers have pledged their intention to hide their chosen realm until launch. This is unacceptable to us. There may not even be enough realms to go around. We want to guarantee at least one realm will be free from their influence and this is how we'll do it - as a community.
---
excuse me I'm 5'10 which is normal height

We got them once in Wrath. Best battleground I ever took part in
---
Blacklist addons definitely existed in Vanilla.
---
Some find the fun *in* Min/Maxing /shrug
---
Yes, absolutely. I kinda wish I didnt play vanilla before because playing it for the first time was really great, atleast it was for me. Really looking forward to playing again.
---
OG AV was legit 24 hours long at times.
---
The story I've heard is that some people got really upset about it and quit the game. But I could be wrong though.
---
Anyone arguing with this guy here is too serious lol, this is fuckin hilarious. Just sit back and see if this clown fiesta goes anywhere.

120gb SSD is tiny. It'll fit Windows and Classic, but it'll be a really tight squeeze. I have a 256gb and regret not getting a 512.

---

---
Yes they are good in PvP. Much like a priest they do a lot more than just heal. Grounding totem will make you lol if you happen to catch an AP PoM Pyro. Rank 1 earth shock is super annoying. A well placed earthbind is clutch in WSG. Windfury with a pair of warriors could be the difference between a priest healing and a priest corpse. 
---
When you say ‚Äústrictly healing‚Äù no pvp healer class puts 51 points into resto/holy. It‚Äôs technically always a hybrid mix. The only difference is will you be the guy that blows his Nature‚Äôs Swiftness on a clutch heal or a Chain Lightning.
---
If you aren't healing you probably will want to not cast to make use of the 5 second rule and regen mana. The lower downtime between pulls will net faster clears than if you try and dps. But at the end of the day you should play for fun not efficiency (unless efficiency is fun). So go ahead and throw some dps out there, as long as people aren't dying it should be fine.
---
I'm more into PVE so I usually just try to get hit cap. In PVP I would favor other stats like crit and stam.
---
Haha, ye. I remember it being published on their website like that and there was another download on 'guildvsguild' website as well, where I first discovered it.
---
Perhaps, yea, but his focus is on raids.
---
We used to have a druid tank in BWL, MC, and ZG in vanilla and I used to heal said tank. I actually considered it easier than healing a warrior because while the bear was crit or crushed sometimes, the damage was still not crazy high and the health pool gave a great buffer. It was a more predictable amount of damage that worked well with HoTs.
---
I think their place is as 2nd or 3rd tank and most raids would benefit from having them thanks to their versatility. Some boss fights are easier with a bear, in some it doesn‚Äôt make a big difference, in some they suck (such as nef). They can heal or decurse (huge mana pool in heal gear) or do some dps if they are not needed as tank. They are supposedly a lot better at building threat while not being the active tank. 
---
Don‚Äôt hold onto the old misconceptions about druids and other classes in classic. Most of the druid prejudice comes from before they were reworked. The idea that warrior priority is mitigation at all costs was established before people properly understood how to play healers and dps. Better understanding how to deal damage requires a stronger focus on threat and healers can keep up tanks a lot better. The more dps the raid can do the quicker the fight ends and the less time there is to mess up the mechanics.
---
I remember doing the same thing with his alliance guide - had a binder for the thing with notes all over it. 
---
Wonder where this guy is now - I asked Joana on stream one time and he said they never had any contact.
---
We've implemented features into The Blacklist that prevents abuse from any one person, any one guild, and even any one faction. The list of Blacklisted individuals will always be viewable and disputable. It will only contain streamers and their ilk.
---
So I can use this mace the whole game ? Or someday I will need to use mace and shield
---
If you don't have time to play the game, don't play the game. Everything doesn't have to change to accomodate you.
---
The hots/warcraft 3 guy? Didnt know he's EU nor playing WoW, wow.
---
If you want to have the pure vanilla virgin experience, you should skip leveling guides/talent specs and just YOLO it. You'll have much more fun and even if it isn't "optimal" screw that, it is one vanilla personality.
---
I don‚Äôt understand. You can already play this game. It‚Äôs the game in its current state.
---
You sure don‚Äôt seem like a ‚Äúclassic purist.‚Äù
---
DW wars sacrifice mitigation. Bears have higher threat without sacrificing anything. They just generally have fewer 'oh shit' buttons.
---
Female priest don‚Äôt flip lol
---
Fun fact: I played with 15 fps and 200 latency.
---
 #nochanges means no cross faction collusion, i'm not sure why this is difficult for you to understand. the mental gymnastics you're performing to try and think that even for a second this whole concept would work is ridiculous lol
---
at the end of the day, once you realise that you've rolled on a server with soda/asmon you're probably going to be the one re-rolling, not the other way around, especially when they're lightyears ahead of you in terms of progression after being thrown countless stacks of free items/gold
---
There‚Äôs YouTube videos of people doing this exact thing
---
The res "streamer" filter, it does nothing...
---
Carrots on the left, croutons on the right, dammit tomatoes I thought I told you to stay back!
---
I used to sleep on the stairs in highschool, knowing that my mom would get home from work around 4am and have to wake me up so I could grind some mobs before school.
---
Even with the "Anit-streamer sentiment", it looks like almost no one actually thinks this is a sane course of action. It's gonna be hilarious when all there supposed top guilds get banned for targeted harassment and they all start REEEEEing there way through the forums.
---
We need two new realm types:  PVP-SSSP and PVP-DBADABYL.  PVP-SSSP (Player-vs-Player:  Special Snowflake Streamer Preseve) will be a PVP server for coddling streamers.  Stream sniping will be prohibited.  PVP-DBADABYL (Player-vs-Player:  Don't Be a Dumbass and Broadcast Your Location) will be a normal PVP server in which stream sniping will NOT be prohibited.
---
No transmog. You want that play retail.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù
---
Manlet status confirmed
---
Yeah maybe we could ask the mods for a specific flair?
---
It is a separate download. It still runs PCs harder than vanilla did due to the more modern engine, but less hard than retail (due to the texture/light quality/number of assets/etc).
---
So how is it any different to phasing? It seems like the only difference is that phasing is zone wide and layering is continent wide?
---
Ty, guess it‚Äôs male for me then lol!
---
Home is where the Hearthstone is. :)
---
I love how wholesome he is.
---
"I turned off follower notifications to protect people's privacy." ADORABLE.
---
Same.
---
*restraint*
---
*checks email/client for beta*
---
Same. I want to play like mad at launch, and I wouldn't have the motivation if I'd beta'd. Plus joking apart, having a Classic release date has motivated me to set up a couple of summer projects. Hopefully I can have a productive summer so that I can have a no-life autumn :p
---
Cross faction collusion absolutely existed in Vanilla, it just wasn't encouraged by Blizzard in Vanilla like it is today. Otherwise realm forums would have been separate for each faction.
---
Even if they field a week-one MC team and receive every piece of loot from it, that won't put them very far ahead of our group. And it will have no effect on the same-faction griefing or the addon.
---
Beta is like sex without orgasm. Yeah it's fine, but the satisfaction isn't there. Launch will be an orgasmic climax of insane Nirvana.
---
But there's nothing stopping us from watching people fuck on YouTube in the mean time....metaphorically speaking, of course.
---
No i most certainly do, and if those aren't the reasons... theres literally nothing to not play on their server or worry about it. I see you're one of the butt hurt fuck boys who wants to avoid streamers at all costs! "OH NOOO they'll ruin my fun!!!"
---
"You people?"
---
I'm simply stating my opinion, and never said anything about the world revolving around myself (project much?), no need to go out calling people dumb &amp; pathetic.
---
To answer your babble, tourists (those who want to see what the hype is about and never reach 60) are gonna be the first to leave wow, followed by those who previously played vanilla and are either just wanting a nostalgia hit or don't have time to dedicate to the game. There's a number of other reasons people will quit also. Just because it's classic doesn't mean the game is infallible.
---
So yes, a server can go on life support real quick if a streamer hypes the game then decides he wants to play something else instead. Especially if he's a huge streamer, and enough of his viewers join his realm.
---
I think it‚Äôs funny how you use the word ‚Äúincel‚Äù to describe anyone who has the time to fulfill all of those tasks/activities. No one forced you to have a family, wife or career. Quit expecting pity for it. Classic is Classic, retail is retail, because of those QoL changes.
---
Quit expecting pity because you have responsibilities lmao.
---
bait
---
Frost is the champ though.
---
I prayed NOT to get into Beta when it was announced.
---
Thank God for listening to my prayers.
---
Not only them. Pretty much only team private server will reach 60 that fast and not many of them. I go to school two days a week and no other obligations and I sure as hell won't grind the game to death within the first two months. I'm in no hurry.
---
except thats alot of some of the stuff that people are constantly bitching about. then if those aren't it please do go on what you're so worried about them being on your server, please tell me so i can laugh at you more for how you think the world revolves around you.
---
&gt; The crowd pummeler farm is greatly exaggerated - you would only use 1 charge per boss so generally this is 3-5 pummelers at most if you tank almost all the bosses in MC, for example.
---
The average player isn't going to know that, though. The people that post asking questions here are not going to know that. 
---
"Yea druids hold aggro super well...if you grab a specific item from a level 30 dungeon and farm it up for raids!" 
---
That's important info! 
---
&gt; 95% of the gear comes from dungeons and raids, there's 1 pvp rep reward which is good and of course the rank 12-13 gear is good until AQ, but that's something other classes deal with too. So I don't know what you mean by a lot of odd pieces.
---
I am saying that in order to make the druid tank work, you have to go out and farm specific pieces of gear. Hell, their tier set is largely going to be useless for them. Again, remember that people posting on here asking questions likely do not know how weird Vanilla actually was, especially as far as gear progression goes. 
---
It's about setting expectations for people that don't know any better. You're leaving a lot of information out and glossing over all the extra stuff you have to do that a warrior doesn't have to. I know you're not doing it on purpose, but you have to give them a clear picture of what to expect.
---
&gt;Why even build expensive castle walls when most people most of the time have the ability to fly?
---
Most people don't have the ability to fly. Only you, an elite champion of the Alliance/Horde, have training in flying the specialized Gryphon/Wyvern. And once you went through the Netherwing grind, you and your Netherwing bros were so tight you and your dragon mount were bonded and could act in unison with each other. Fantasy was not impacted at all in my mind, so no. 
---
Swooping down upon someone while riding your armored netherdrake can't be matched. When you came down on someone, and they saw your mount and your title, they knew they were fucked. You were a better player than them, and they were about to die. Getting ganked in vanilla was kind of lame because some fat nerd who gave the raid leader a handjob could have better loot than you and kill you, but in BC the only players who were gladiators were skilled PvPers. Vanilla raid-or-die players who are bad at PvP whine about resilience gear, but resilience gear meant the best PvPers were rewarded with the (generally) best PvP gear (there were some exceptions, like 4/5 4/8 glaive rogues), and the strict raid-only players had the best PvE gear. The system worked pretty well.
---
Flying only became a problem in WOTLK IMO, when flying was made accessible to everyone because the world was designed around it. Icecrown and Stormpeak cannot be traversed without flying, so EVERYONE had to have flying. A huge number of people did not have 280% flying in BC and almost no one (less than 1%) had 310% flying in BC. 
---
&gt;The DARK PORTAL is supposed to be this scary place pivotal in Azeroth‚Äôs history. A place where dark magic allowed demons to invade our world from beyond. Nah bro, portals to and from the dark world as easy come by.
---
Dark Portal connected leylines between Azeroth and Outland. Before that point, travel between worlds was impossible. Shatt portals use the same leylines connecting Azeroth and Outland. Basically, the dark portal bonds the two worlds together. Portals existed in WC3, why wouldn't they exist in WoW?
---
#BC was the best expansion, your nitpicks are trivial. Vanilla is great (and even better if you're going in with a group of friends) but the fact that you're having to find the smallest issues shows you know you are wrong and just want to be contrarian.
---
Because you want those super fast clears so you can spend more time farming consumables for the next super fast clear.
---
I am no expert, but it is for sure a mixed bag. Combat is a lot slower (some say thoughtful/some say boring) but there is also clearly far more class unique spells  
---
Take PVP, in retail its so messy fast its hard to tell what pros are doing while if you watch masters in classic duel you can tell exactly what they are doing as they do it
---
Someone who doesn't know the difference between bitching and stating facts. Hilarious. But hey you keep crying about streamers and how its gonna ruin your fun.
---
I love that they think "180" level 60's will stop anything. Streamers literally get thousands of viewers each stream. They're just gonna be poking a bee hive.....
---
I feel like they should just avoid streamer servers like the rest of us and call it a day.
---
Because when I play video games, I definitely want to be told to suck it up so that logistics officers can expose young men to the reality of war.
---
I was about to say the same thing
---
That boss was the biggest nightmare fight since lady vashj, the amount of attempts banging head on the wall was horrific lol
---
I just hope gear upgrades are still in the game. It is such an awesome surprise when my gear rolls up. I don't know why people hate war/titanforging so much.
---
I honestly hope they implement LFR too. I don't have time to wait around for 40 other people to get their shit together. I just want to to clear all the raids and get all the loot xD
---
You're gonna camped by so many people its gonna be fucking funny. After you give someone that buff hes gonna turn around and gank your ass. see ya in classic.
---
Randy Marsh him. ‚ÄúOh yeah, yea, you like that daddy? FREEZE. Imma cop buster.‚Äù
---
As if this dude is going to be allowed into groups with those of us in our 30s.
---
Fucking narcissistic losers if they think they can dictate the actions of a person nevertheless a server.
---
This is obvious satire. His username is classicpurist for christ's sake.
---
Well I did this a few years ago on my Mac to play Maplestory as it wasn‚Äôt compatible with a Mac and it wasn‚Äôt too bad considering it wasn‚Äôt a fast paced game, it could be okay with Classic as long as your internet speed is fine
---
waaa waa waaa lmfao bunch of fucking babies all around
---
Then they got gutted again to make way for legion weapon traits then we lost those in BFA and gained cast times on most of our abilities. 
---
I honestly didn't mind the new talent system in mop but preferred original tree but what we have now is just bland, clunky and slow. 
---
It's just been part of the trend to simplify the game. Gems and glyphs where great I loved them now you gotta play, reply and more reply to try and get those titan forged bits.
---
Honestly I'm no quitter I played through wod happily but for the first time since vanilla I have unsubbed because I couldn't stand the current game and playing on private server atm. I'm seriously considering playing classic when it comes out but tbh if it's one sub for classic and BFA I'll probably won't as I don't want my sub showing up as support for retail considering the state it's in.
---
Mad? no no im not mad, im quite chill :) I just like telling stupid people they're stupid and what they should do, like playing in traffic.
---
Night Elf and Druid go together like peanut butter and chocolate.  It just fits.
---
No, it's not!  I bet I can make it work, and top the meters.
---
DPS warrior is the best dps in the game. You‚Äôll be fine
---
Sounds like you just didn‚Äôt participate in world pvp if that‚Äôs your true stance. To claim world pvp was a myth when TM and SS were always besieged by copious amounts of players is just asinine.
---

---
There's going to be a trillion warriors, and they're not nearly as op as people think.
---
Corpse camping for 5 hours is friefing and blizzard ban people for this. It's all in moderation
---
It doesn‚Äôt mean anything as far as adding new content. Stadia is just running games in the cloud and streaming to players PC. That has nothing to do with programmers creating new content. It still has to be created. It still has to be patched in to the client Stadia runs to stream to the player.
---
It's actually recommended you level as something other than a tank, at least imo. 
---
Warriors are top tier DPS, as well as tanks.
---
Don't worry about what other people think; unless you're hardcore raiding, you'll be able to find a guild that fits you perfectly.
---
Sounds like you two should play together :)
---
Well you have to compete to 80% of the population if u play warrior .
---
Nice meme
---
I think you might be confused. The way they explained it, you stay in 1 layer until you join a party with somebody on a different layer.
---
You should never change layers just because.
---
Unfortunately come August 27th you will have no choice but to abandon your friends and drop out from school. Since you have decided to roll a pally you will be *forced* to spam flash of light while the world continues around you. If you ever attempt to get up from your chair, Omar himself will chain you to the floor.
---
Dude, I found it! Incoming vintage screenshots!!
---
Always fun going to bed after a nice AV session, and then seeing the same one up the next day.
---
I‚Äòd automatically assume that your chinese levels bad at the game and not invite you to anything, if you‚Äòd start off like that.
---
Because on retail whenever he stays in one point for any amount of time tonnes of people go to him, and that‚Äôs WITH sharding. Without it, once layers are gone, everyone on the server can find him easily.
---
Great! Looking forward to it :D
---
Were you on a pvp server? I got rank 10 back in the day and it wasn't all that hard but I wasn't on a PVP server... wondering how much more difficult it'll be
---
I chuckled, thus I shall support your cause
---
Just done with the migration to Firefox with all extensions and parameters, EZ Clap
---
I'm looking more at the XP bar at level 60
---
No, you will have hard time finding groups for dungeoons
---
imagine being this mad that attempts are being made to avoid streamers
---
Isn‚Äôt this the scene with the denueralizer?
---
you're hilarious mate. once it's put under such a large microscope that will be this supposed addon vs streamers, blizzard will have no choice but to take action on those involved.
---
i mean, how dare you come between blizzard and their free advertising, right? if you're going to intentionally try and stop them from playing the game, then there's absolutely no reason why they wouldn't intervene and make an example out of the anti-streamer sperglord initiative, especially if them taking action is under the guise of same-faction griefing/cross-faction collusion
---
yes "you people" the ones who give so much credit to streamers that you think they're gonna manipulate every move of a server. You have to be a pretty fucking stupid individual if you think that a streamer is gonna make a sever die or not. And yes you do think the world revolves around you, if you think that something some random fucking person does it gonna affect you, some nobody in the HUGE fucking world of azeroth you're a complete fucking moron. You act like streamers are some type of gods and control the masses.

"NNnnggh..."
---
I'm set on druid right now, never really played one and I like the idea of getting to tank or heal and having stealth. I've changed my mind a couple of times though so we will see.
---
Hey, just curious what relatively well geared means for balance in classic? I didn‚Äôt play druids back then but am going to in classic with PvP being my main focus.
---
Yeah bud buy a prebuilt to max out those gaming frames
---
This was 100% my  favourite  way of wasting money back then and this was IIRC the longest i ever flew before dying.
---
I'm moving atm and will be on the road for a while longer, but I will at least say that you're also a cool dude despite being a zealous Alliance scoundrel, and also BfA Sylvanas can go fuck herself. For the remainder of your post, I'll read and respond when/if I get the time in the next few hectic days.
---
He asked about tanking for dungeons and about raiding as a healer, 0/30/21 definitely works for that.
---
It ain't perfect but it's probably the best single spec in the game for fulfilling multiple roles.
---
No joke though a good chair is the best investment you can make regarding gaming if you spend lots of hours gaming. 
---
If you spend thousands of hours gaming then drop a few hundred on a solid gaming chair with adjustable lumbar support. It will last you years and will also save your back. Don‚Äôt be like me and game on office chairs for 20 years. Your back might not hurt now or next year, but it will eventually.
---
Ah yea lemme hit up my dad who works at blizzard so i can let you know all the servers before they're up
---
Perfect! I am very glad with that news. Thanks!
---
There seems to be some confusion.  Some say it is fine while others say it's basically a no-go.
---
The same-faction griefing we intend is against the EULA. Neither is cross-faction collusion.
---
Yeah I saw these Ooga guys on Josh‚Äôs stream and they were some quality content. Not just corpse camping assholes
---
The shit winds
---
How to exploit av?
---
It's great, but i think also having the break points laid out for each spell would be easier to parse.

Unfortunately for you, I spend a lot of time on 4chan. Words on the internet don't really affect me. Seek professional help and go outside more often.
---
make friends
---
friends dont force u to do anything
---
I see. Thank you
---
HAHAHAH
---
Ah, yes Blizzard has famously fixed the problem of class stacking in their most recent content.
---
Can you explain the only one tranq shot comment?
---
It can be about that, whatever is fun is fun.
---
ok :) awesome :) i believe you :)
---
can you please provide a list of the guilds that're participating in this whole thing anyway? or does that not exist
---
I like how you got down voted instead of someone replying with quality indie game titles. Because that‚Äôs all I ever get recommended, is fucking scrollers too. See hollow knight, meat boy, cup head etc
---
Honestly, you can tank lower level dungeons without even speccing for it, as long as you have some green/blue tanking gear to switch to.
---
It's not a question of "can I just DPS the whole time". Of course you can do whatever you want. My suspicion is that you will learn how to tank competently because being a tank or healer takes away 90% of the work involved in forming a dungeon group.
---
&gt; We used to have a druid tank in BWL, MC, and ZG in vanilla and I used to heal said tank.
---
And he was probably really well geared for the content he was doing and probably spent a lot of time acquiring said gear in order to make it work. 
---
That's what I am getting at here. OP is going to have to put in extra work that he will have to constantly farm in order to make this work. That's important information. 
---
"Druids are great at holding threat...if they farm up a weapon (that has non-recharging charges) from a level 30 dungeon and keep 4-5 in their bag for raid night." 
---
Imagine being a druid player, you hit 60, get super excited for tanking, and realize you have to do that in order to be competitive. 
---
The thing that is interesting with Vanilla was that it was so broken and unoptimized that people could do some pretty crazy things. 
---
But getting yourself to that point often took a lot of time and patience with the game. It was also things that were not always immediately apparent. Players unfamiliar with Vanilla will look at the druid and the ability to tank and think that their playstyle and gear progression will be "normal". It won't be and they deserve to know all the ends and outs. 
---
The good parts, the tedious, and the bad.
---
spoghoti
---
lol? In what world do you live in. If you have 39 other players carrying you through 1 year of raids until you get gear only 1% could only dream of youll be a god, sure.
---
The two best things about Cata were:
---
1) Firelands
---
2) Robocop Warrior PvP set
---
Stadia is a trash idea that will fail lol. It didn't even work well under ideal conditions.
---
Pretty sure thats what it was, i saw a video that horde came out lined up with them, did the ceremony and then broke out into all out war.
---
Filthy casual
---
Thanks, yeah maybe I will enjoy tanking once I try it and you're right maybe it will be that much better because I can form groups faster.
---
Leveling fast, and eating ass
---
And Runecloth for that sweet, sweet tiger mount for any Non-NE.
---
Yeah there are shit people in every community. You can‚Äôt blame one person or group of people for everything. Just like you can not truly give hitler all of the credit for the beetle. In fact you can only give him a small amount.
---
Sorry that you have had bad experiences, and chose poorly ran servers, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt good ones and good people. If the beetle wasn‚Äôt a good design it would not have stood the test of time, doesn‚Äôt matter who created it, just matters who buys it. Private server community brought you classic wow, and your buying it so you can thank those toxic assholes. You may as well go buy a vw beetle from hitler himself now too.
---
Maybe because you're on an EU server? Iv heard that eu servers populations are usually low compared to that of NA
---
&gt;so my totems dont mean much
---
If we're talking BGs, the totems arent solely for you.

it's not hard to save 100g, still its not easy like doing a couple a quests and bam you have 100g, no.  
---
if you save while leveling not buying useless stuff, (like level 1 - 30 weapon,armor and other shenanigans) you will get to 39-40 with 100g just fine.  
---
If you want to make money while leveling mine or herblore are the way to go...
---
You have all the requirements. So go for it
---
Link?
---
&gt;Not a shit post.
---
That's where you're wrong.
---
Control your life
---
But don't they really increase the power they have for creating a world? Because technically you are playing a game on Google's GPU that's capable of 10.7 teraflops of power compared to my Macbook that has like 8gb of RAM. They have to build WoW to port to my MACbook specs, instead of just porting it straight to the SUPERCOMPUTER and streaming it
---
Jesus
---
¬¥there's other things to do in vanilla
---
I mean, thats usually what stupid people say. But do go on
---
I will enjoy it.
---
You could have just unchecked the box for beta
---
I am not sure if this has been asked or answered, so please excuse my stupidity. I couldn't find much about it.
---
Just watched Asmon (please dont downvote this is about the game) buy his mount on Beta...mount was 64g or something and the training was like 16g or something. WTF? Definitely remember the training to be 80g-90g and the mount itself was 9g-10g? Asmon tries to "equip" it and it says BoE...uhhh...
---
Am i missing something?
---
Honestly mate you will learn to tank it's not that big a deal, trust yourself and admit your mistakes, people will be happy to just have a tank in the first place.
---
They shouldn't, but they earn blizzard millions in marketing money they won't have to spend.
---
That's like not being welcome in whole foods. Who gives a shit lol
---
Literally Virgin Ragnaros vs Chad Ragnaros
---
Ps: blizzard will suck more money out of the community than a private server ever will. Private servers are free, give the guys some slack that want something to at least update server once in a while and keep the thing going.
---
If you don't have ssd, buy a cheap one even, it will make your old rig like new.
---
Prior to it's nerf there were ore veins all over the map too, as well as herbs. Alterac valley was like another zone
---
they flip on some melee attacks, so warrior and rogue flip alot
---
What is moderation?
---
Trying to have his candle and keep it too.
---
Fair enough, that's a valid criticism. I'll just note that in a casual guild you probably won't really need a crowd pummeler anyway since you're less likely to have a tryhard DPS that will challenge you on threat. If you're in a DKP guild getting raid gear is also especially nice, since all the raid tier gear is useless for tanking so you're free to spend your mountains of DKP on the handful of competitive items that are useful for feral like Band of Accuria.
---
You are the one that painted that Azeroth map aren't you?! You are so talented!
---
Bro,  it's only wow classic.
---
Get meth instead, much better than Adderall and you only need it for a few days.
---
Only downside is life ruining addiction, but that's already covered by Classic anyway.
---
You can also change layers by grouping with someone from a different layer, yes. That's the intentional layer switch.
---
The unintentional layer switch comes in, when as i explained, the population on the layer you're on is either reaching it's max, or it's lowest. 
---
If it's too high, and you are not grouped or guilded in the current layer you're in, you and other solo players are the highest prio to be the first to get switched over to the new layers.
---
That's exactly what happened in the clip.
---
If the population of the layer empties out too much, everyone in it will get switched over to the next best populated layer currently active.
---
Those unintentional (from your PoV) layer switches are simply a consequence of the layers being dynamic, adjusting themselves all the time based on their current populations to make sure people are in layers with enough players at all times.
---
So no, i'm not confused. If anything, the fact that the way layering works is confusing for most people just shows that Blizzard have sold you a system that when it's actually there, you'll see it's not the way you thought it would be once you're actually in the game.
---
Lol you‚Äôre a tool. It‚Äôs not a list ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want to play with‚Äù it‚Äôs a list to try and keep other big time guilds and players from playing with the ‚Äúsnipers‚Äù.
---
Will make it a part of my next patch!
---
And not having to worry about farming gold to respec or consumables for raids tuned without them gives you more time to enjoy those other things.
---
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin.
---
Thanks for letting me know I def won‚Äôt be purchasing kek
---
It's true!
---
Gotta love Albert O'Malley.
---
:)
---
Well, in the video I posted, Omar literaly said you get stickied to a layer, so until you show video of him saying you are supposed to dynamically switch, you're wrong.
---
LUL HaHaa monkerS frankfurtherZ amiright my fellow twitchers????
---
You can do it, but don't expect little harassment.  That would be like a feral druid saying he would only dps. Sure, at the end game you can find a spot, but even in a casual raiding guild flexibility is valued. Go for it.  Just be straightforward and handle the reactions without getting upset.  The more upset you get the more you validate their opinions.
---
Some things somewhat in moderation
---
Straight hype up in here!
---
Stage 3: Bargaining
---
Pewdiepie used to play wow, maybe he will return to classic.
---
Fresh!!!
---
And they have updated models now, right?
---
Especially A paladin running in with a bubble, literally unstoppable and can get an instant off when bubble wears off
---
This is something I can get behind.
---
And by being such crybaby losers at that. They deserve to be camped just for thinking they deserve a different type of server reputation.
---
No no no
---
You‚Äôre an idiot.
---
This is very wet.
---
He's talking about buffs and debuffs. 
---
Like in EverQuest, slowing mobs (attack speed), friendly attack speed buffs, Regen, frenzy radius,, resists/debuffs, str, sta, agi, etc
---
Well, phasing also changes the world itself, so it's not exactly the same. 
---
Layering, very roughly said, if anything is more similar to sharding (which it was originally based off of), except that this time, they are big shards (~3k ppl) that are continental, and will allow you to see your guild when you're out in the world with them.
---
You can try reporting the bad link. I had an old video restored of my guild that way.. Worth a try
---
/r/twitch is -------------&gt; that way
---
Cata Rag with legs looks badass, I don‚Äôt care what anyone says.
---
If you wanna see what a bad Rag model looks like, look at his HotS model with the tiki mask of a face.
---
Looks cool
---
I still have all of mine (up to cata). I loved leafing through every page of classic and learning all about the world. Can't wait to experience that again.
---
For Cata, you're forgetting the great angst of "heroics are too hard" as the wrathbabies hit puberty
---
 This.  If you're gaming without an SSD you're gimping your computer. And 500GB SSDs aren't terribly expensive.
---
There is Dark Iron on the roof...please explain that to me.
---
They can't if they end up on a streamer server.
---
That's why they come up with that atrocious play and sell it to the people as if they would care for average players experience.
---
They don't - but if the top 4 guilds on a server work together they can own the economy to some extend, which is what they are after. 
---
Including (real money) raid slot selling, etc of course.
---
By having a 2ft Gnome Warrior tank it.
---
My first main was a pally, loved ret while I was leveling up. I somehow got lucky enough to find a generous guild that brought me along for a couple raids, so long as I put on my **three** pieces of intellect gear and cast holy light. That's how unnecessary a ret pally is in vanilla raids.
---
Should reagents be vendored or AH?
---
If you have a group of friends and run dungeons pre raid bis warriors are tied with mages and rogues in MC and keep scaling throughout vanilla.
---
omg! Streamers reeeeee !!!! I hate streamers reeeeeeeeee!!!!
---
Effectively, it's reccomended, as almost all tanks will be warriors, almost no tanks will want you in their group because you will be competing for them with gear. You probably won't be invited to many dungeons, but for leveling it is reccomended to be dps ofc. Maybe find a bunch of friends who don't mind.
---
Because it becomes obvious when people follow you from zone to zone or when they repeatedly show up on his stream. Also when people "randomly" aoe to get him out of stealth.
---
Thank
---
Warriors are top dps throughout vanilla...
---
Holy fuck I totally forgot about Jame‚Äôs guide....
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Co_c4qaXfY
---
Main Nightelf Priest. Priest because I‚Äòve always been a healer, that‚Äòs what I love doing in the game and they are the most interesting option. Nightelf because everybody and their mother are going dwarf.
---
This again?
---
Actually, Soupasoka, the moderator of this subreddit did a test, and on his computer IIRC classic ran slightly smoother than vanilla wow did.
---
Hunter has the HWL shoulds but definitely isn't HWL -- this must have been prepatch and/or right after TBC launched?
---
It's clearly intended for rogues.
---
IIRC at the time this screenshot was taken (2005-02-19) there weren't any other mage self-buffs worth using (Mage Armor was added a little while after release, but forgot when exactly).
---
But yes, Arcane Missles, lol /facepalm
---
Look at that Nier:Autotomato bullshit.
---
Nice stuff, btw.
---
Wait, how are speed levelers ruining your experience? Play the game the way you want to, don't impose restrictions on others
---
"World first" haha ok
---
"On top of my job, wife, kids, and career you want me to take a Zepp from Org to UC, fly to hammerfall, and then do that every single time I want to run the dungeon? Just to play a game that I am playing in order to ENJOY MYSELF, not spend an hour getting from point A to point B in order to clear content." 
---
listen now, you will travel and will like it.
---
stop enabling him
---
I believe this particular paragraph refers to arena and BGs. World PvP probably isn't even addressed
---
Feral is not subpar, it's one of the most effective and useful classes for Jaina, but everyone stopped playing it so we can't actually find someone that plays it well to utilize them in our guild on Jaina prog.
---
It's not a remake, though. The point is getting the old experience, not a remake. So like no, none of the changes fit the old experience and transmog destroys the old experience
---
Imagine consuming enough soy to unironically play Alliance
---
BIG downvotes, MASSIVE.
---
Not pictured: me, level 13, standing just off screen and patiently waiting for an NPC to respawn so I can turn in my quest. This was always a good time to get some reading done.
---
Please im so triggered rn. Almost as triggered as you get when the name Sodapoppin is mentioned
---
&gt; Not really a pun, but okay
---
You contributed literally nothing to the universe with this comment. Congratulations.
---
Smite becomes quite bad very rapidly. Long cast time for meh damage.
---
When leveling you'll most likely go Mind blast into SW:P into wand to death. Leveling is quite easy.
---
You can also heal all dungeons as a shadow priest.
---
Those shamans were tough cookies
---
Well of course you can. Depends how far you want to go. You can't really be using dungeon gear if you want to heal naxx but if you just want to have fun and play causal that would be a fine paladin weapon.
---
This is what he asked. A single build that will ***be good*** to tank for 5 mans, dps for raids, and heal for raids, without a full respec. 
---
Is he going to be a better dps than a rogue / mage / warlock etc with that spec? ***No.***
---
Is he going to be a better healer than a priest / paladin / shaman / druid specced with that spec? ***No.*** 
---
Which means the raid leader is more likely to ***not take him*** because he isn't optimally specced for the role that the raid leader is looking for. 
---
I'm not sure where I am losing you on this. Assume the raid leader just needs one more dps for his raid. Why would he take a druid specced that way when he could take a rogue or a mage? Class difference aside, those other classes didn't spend ***twenty one*** points on talents that are not going to improve their dps in the role that the raid leader is looking for. 
---
Or in the other direction. Why would the raid leader, who needs a healer, take a player that has ***thirty*** points into talents that are not going to improve their HPS? Hell, he won't even have his 31pt or NS!
---
Despite Blizzard's intentions, there really wasn't much room for a hybrid class to operate like they wanted it to in Vanilla. Ironically enough, later iterations of the game allowed for the hybrid to actually do what OP is asking. That is, of course, the ability to swap between specs effortlessly (assuming of course you had the gear to back it up).
---
&gt;warlock and pally.
---
- Go to trainer
---
- Hey want a horse?
---
- yes
---
- here's your horse

I request vectors of all three warlock sets, starting with T3 :)
---
If you spend more than a few hours a day in your chair, it is worth it.
---
I‚Äôm all for people playing Classic how they want to, it‚Äôs one of the best things about Classic WoW. But this is hardcore on a level I haven‚Äôt even seen in mythic raiding guilds in wow. 
---
There are really enough people who play like this to field a whole guild and then some huh
---
Good call actually RE: Charge. 
---
Do you know if anticipation is key? How easy is it to def cap? Seems a lot of points for 10 defence.
---
Playing vanilla for the first time on pserver, and I just got to duskwood. What makes it so great?
---
3 buckets one, for piss one for, beer, one for puke and make sure that you label them, carefully
---
"No amount of fanboi spergs will stop us."
---
I found this part particularly ironic.
---
be carefull you dont go on servers with streamers, you might end up vs players far better than yourself, go on low pop ones where you can feel like a king while doing mediocre
---
He says while simultaneously making gross extrapolations of logic to make an innocent analogy seem like a racist caricature. I would say the same to you, but I doubt you have the ability for introspection.
---
They would have to make a custom model, as she is an undead blood elf
---
Progress will get "WF", Tips has absolutely 0 chance at "WF". Nothing he can physically do, he's literally never going to achieve it.
---
That‚Äôs great to hear! I actually didn‚Äôt expect that. Good times.
---
Thanks a lot for your answers, I will go back to my mountain and think things through.
---
yeah buddy!
---
How long does it take to read all that?
---
Adderall is a hard drug?
---
&gt;I think I speak for most of us,
---
You don't.
---
I feel like this is bait.
---
Why are people not selling all this awesome creations?? Quit your job and make these for a living  please.
---
Wait for the list to appear, choose a high pop server.
---
Go where my friends are going, or where the guild you signed up to on the forums before the game came out.
---
Good sir, with is a MSK?
---
I thought the same thing. I respect going hard and no lifing, but these guys are setting themselves up for disaster with all these requirements and goals, lol
---
That was sharing rather than the new layering approach. Each layer is a full continent.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this only happened 2ish weeks during the pre tbc patch, but every wow youtuber or streamer or whatever talks about it like it was some huge thing in vanilla that was there forever
---
Thats a different formula , the hit chance at 300 is 9% thats correct, but at 305 the hit chance is 6%. Were not sure how dodge / parry / block are affected by weapon skill. Only by level so far so its incomplete data and would need more testing in game to get the true picture
---
It's a phishing website. Whenever someone asks for t-shirts it auto links this stuff...
---
Reporting usually works.
---
It wont last long, most of this is just all talk for now. The guild will settle where it settles. I think they will just end up being a bunch of punks nobody likes. They wont make a real lasting mark on the game like they want to
---
The problem with your example is that Paladin is by far the strongest healer (with gear).  Meanwhile, Feral (with MCP) is a better tank than warriors for some fights and does a lot more DPS than Ret.  Shadow (one) also buffs the locks.  Your hypothetical ‚Äú15‚Äù is closer to ‚Äú12‚Äù after you take out a couple Ferals and Spriests.  You only drop to that few healers on farm.
---
If you‚Äôre meaning to say ‚ÄúYou can go Ret when your AQ/Naxx guild reclears MC for Thunderfury,‚Äù then you‚Äôre not wrong.  However, don‚Äôt set this guy up to fail.
---
You go Paladin to heal.
---
Hmm...
---
Ah ofc, however they are going to worth almost nothing in the beginning, so it would be wise to invest them and let them sit in the guild bank until more people get gold
---
Does this remove the comment itself for you? Cause even better.
---
That's the thing, I don't hate streamers. I like most. I am just taking a hit at all of this dumb discussion over it.
---
Well I guess you can't complain when DM drops and mages can farm 100g an hour. I never knew about that spot but I've also heard it was legit in vanilla too.
---
&gt; I just hope gear upgrades are still in the game. It is such an awesome surprise when my gear rolls up. I don't know why people hate war/titanforging so much.
---
Are you being serious? I hope not.
---
Yes it does effect a lot of things in the world.
---
This is pure satire right? LOL
---
Not sure.
---
Fuck off, it's literally already confirmed to be a bug by blizzard.
---
No one cares who clears anything first. Sorry.
---
If you want to guarantee you'll get it around 40, go skinning while you level and vendor the leather (there is no market for it really early on a fresh server on the AH as nobody has any gold yet). The vendor price for grey junk you find starts to ramp up a lot after lvl 30 and with skinning, vendoring everything I can and not training spells I don't need, I've always had enough gold for mount at 40 with plenty spare.
---
LUL
---
what the hell is that on the top?
---
Your*
---
Poor gnomes... Discriminated against for their height
---
But how does increased power have anything to do with releasing a classic game without any changes since 2004?
---
Couple issues.
---
&gt; Your rotation guide says a normal rotation should be 'judge SotC'
---
Unless the fight lasts more than 30 seconds, that's not gonna fly. Just seal sor/soc - judge - seal
---
- Judging SoC will do 75 damage
---
- Judging SotC will boost damage by 40 before the mob dies
---
SotC is garbo for short fights.
---
&gt; only get rank 1 of Ret Aura
---
Ret aura (and imp ret aura) is the best leveling aura available. 2x the damage of Sanc aura, Devo is fairly useless, Imp Ret aura is like a 10% DPS increase throughout leveling.
---
I literally said ganking that turns into harassment is bannable and you said ‚Äúganking is not bannable &lt;b&gt;whatsoever&lt;/b&gt;‚Äù in which case, you‚Äôre totally fucking wrong, ganking that turns into harassment is, Blizzard stated it, take the L like a man and move on.
---
&gt; Main purpose of the server is for players that like to enjoy the slow progression of the game in the leveling stage of the game. Take their time and can spend doing other things like world pvp, hanging around and just collecting resources
---
Why not just do that on any normal server? Don't worry about what other people are doing and focus on what you want, because it's a video game and they are made for fun? I don't see why everyone else has to be handicapped for you to enjoy the game
---
I remember there was a big forum post during bc that gnomes get dismounted in the pools of Zangarmarsh while others don't. A blue responded something like  "that comes with being cute and small! "
---
You dont need gear, you only need shield and 1h weapon
---
I really hope we don't get a story of someone dying 3 days after release from playing non-stop. There really should be some kind of limit. Like you can't play more than 36 hours in a 48 hour period. That way you can still have a crazy marathon without actually risking death.
---
I did exactly that for other games already. If the Addon API can read your position and has a way to get data out of the game (in the worst case writing to a file is enough) a other program can track the data and show / update the map.
---
Takes too much effort, I just leave them on the radiator beside me and reach over and grab them once they‚Äôve become lukewarm.
---
Mage is perhaps the best option, As they are easy to feel good at. No much you can do to mess up raids and groups. Skill ceiling in PvP is quite high though.
---
This is great, the more of you mentally ill people who blacklist me, the less effort it takes on my part to not play with you.
---
FocusFrame
---
I think layering is a necessary thing for classic launch. But it won't prevent the starting zones from being a total mess on the first day. There's no sharing if mob tags, and hunters / instant casters will be plentiful.
---
Really appreciated the editing and POM pyro carnage in the unknown series. Enough that I leveled a mage for exploration with blink/slow fall abilities in vanilla.
---
It's going to be interesting to see the evolution of videos from vanilla to classic. This type of content has a level of style and creativity that has been lost in modern iterations.
---
There is a level of immersion that captures attention, where you might not even understand the game or what's going on. But you know it's bad ass and want some more.
---
Not the Horde guide but the guide I used on all my characters on Alliance and people were always super impressed/surprised by how fast I leveled.
---
You get all faction rep for the god turn ins, so I used to set up turtles just so I could loot blood for turn ins.  I got all faction exalted very quickly, then did it again when they added the BE faction before BC launch.
---
I suspected Onslaught would probably get it. But yeah one of these two guilds
---
This is so fucking cool omg
---
The guide is step by step and illustrated so you just go through it as you play.  As long as it takes to level to 60 with it I suppose.  The end state is level 60 with Dungeon Set 2 bracers.
---
No it‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúYou are an idiot.‚Äù
---
Pretty good, but ignore the 'front shredding' part, as that is a pserver only thing.
---
Preach is pretty dope
---
Damn now I have to avoid this server and the streamer ones? What's going to be left...
---
I just dont get the big rush it's already been done not only that but the main streamer mentality is if you troll on my server you will be blacklisted and we completely discourage you from playing on my server
---
&gt; I don't get why this is even remotely a point of contention, but here we are.
---
Because, you guys are trying to say owl is a better leveling pet. It's just not true.
---
Wife is just rallying the gold farmers at home for 8 of those accounts!
---
Ahhh your 15 year old self saw the future.
---
That the undead would eventually completely fuck the nightelves.
---
Yeah, from what I have seen they kill you once then leave you alone for while. They are hilarious imo.
---
Phasing can be used for that but it's not exclusively used for that. Phasing is also zone-wide sharding. You can join a group out in the world, and get switched into their phase - something that happens a lot when world questing.
---
Yes. Protection is tough for leveling in Vanilla. For what it‚Äôs worth, I leveled as Arms, had no idea what a ‚Äútank‚Äù was, but every time I did a dungeon I was told to ‚Äútank‚Äù. Everyone should adjust around you if you do tank. Tanks are the in-demand role for dungeons, and groups are so desperate for them they‚Äôll do everything they can to help you.
---
It‚Äôs not like the modern game in that regard.
---
You are not free to intentionally grief and call out a witchhunt against players with aim to make their game experience terrible on purpose. It's in the EULA. All I'm saying is rethink your words so the intentions are more clear to making sure a player doesnt exist to you. Don't intentionally grief, which is against the rules, a player so he / she don't play on your server. 
---
Blizzard has banned for much less in terms of "griefing". If you dont want to deal with a player in any way that is your choice, no one will stop you, but what you stated is literally against EULA. Stop justifying it and change your wording.
---
Were supposed to be constructive here. Not destructive.
---
I love the hot take of, "No YOU'RE the racist for finding this blatantly thing racist." Google racism and gorillas, learn a little this week.
---
Now, now, it goes like this:
---
40% warriors
---
40% rogues
---
20% the rest
---
We had the same tabard EU laughing skull guild name was and will be CryMore
---
You keep your inventory when you reincarnate, so you don't lose your level 60 raid gear.
---
If someone has a copy of the Alliance guide, I'd do a trade.
---
I remember spawning the bosses during TBC in an attrition war, was really awesome. So it can happen, but I've only seen it twice since TBC
---
Everyone knows mage is dps King in vanilla
---
Lol classic indeed.
---
Now if only the undead had functioning genitals...
---
Once again, another insightful rebuttal filled with researched facts and sensible arguments.
---
I feel sorry for your mother who has to lie to your face and her friends about what a nice sibling you are.
---
Do mage t3 next!
---
What a retard
---
the class size difference has always been a subject of controversy
---
Nice call out! Those videos were intense.
---
I have an Aeron, and it is 100% worth it.
---
Which exact part would you consider griefing?
---
Any world PVP is not against the EULA.
---
Any cross faction collusion is not against the EULA.
---
Automatically ignoring the trades, chat, groups, and auctions of a player is not against the EULA.
---
Perhaps some of the mob-tagging is against the EULA.
---
You can make macros that cast spells at their highest rank with a shift mod that casts the spell at a lower rank, and a other modifiers for further lower ranks.
---
Yes because **many** people will be playing this game casually. 
---
No because you'll be so addicted you'll end up voluntarily yet unknowingly forsaking your social life, just rest of us.
---
I doubt getting a precise location would even be possible, and is especially against ToS. They have to be trolling
---
Tauren can troll block mailboxes.
---
Switched up shaman healing wave and chain heal icons.
---
I couldn‚Äôt keep back onto my photo bucket to find my old one. Cool pic! /cheers
---
please don't be toxic, I'm a former father to two children.
---
Haha, true
---
Why does Tips think he's a good player exactly? He's full of shit and full of himself anytime I've seen him. But maybe he can wrangle up enough half decent morons to carry him.
---
I'd honestly rather play on a streamer server than this. At least there I can have fun and not feel like I'm playing Holocaust Simulator 2019
---
As long as you keep in mind you need to save gold for the mount id say it‚Äôs not that bad. I got my mount at 40 back in the day and I was a retarded 11 year old, so if I could do it anyone should be able to ;)
---
Honestly if the streamers are smart that‚Äôs what they‚Äôll do.  They can still stage their World PvP by contacting opposite faction streamers and meeting somewhere and doing /pvp.
---
It's basically meth.
---
Can someone explain to me what Im missing here?
---
Page 1 out of 132
---
An WoW Molten cannot explode, comrade
---
*The IRS has joined the discord. Say hello!*
---
We need Frostbolts moving through the Molten Core that's all that matters.
---
Wow that‚Äôs amazing!!! Can‚Äôt believe someone likes AH.
---
What do you think Stadia is?
---
Because it's completely unrelated to Blizzards ability to add new, uninstanced zones.
---
A good chair and a height-adjustable desk. Standing while playing WoW is oddly satisfying.
---
Everything in moderation, including moderation.
---
You will see them, but they'll be summoned in way less games than he wont be.
---
I think it's because they are horde and a paladin item just dropped which isn't meant to happen since horde doesn't have paladins until BC.
---
Can we get for these eu streamers aswell? Apes/Progress?
---
Rogue/Warrior are easier than Lock, IMO.
---
Not increased - UNLIMITED. They can upgrade the servers anytime they want. 10.7 teraflops is just the start when you have infinite scalability. I'm saying the future of this game in terms of what can be improved. Classic is like a work of art - but it can go deeper. 
---
There's only 3 ways to expand the game that have been discussed. Vertical (instances/raids higher than Naxx), Horizontal (More content/quesst), or TECHNICAL.
---
There is still a lot of depth that could be explored in this game WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING. One great example would be increasing view distance TO THE MAXX!!!! Imagine being in Thunderbluff and you can see your friend on the other side of Mulgore? This is possible in Stadia without lag, I believe.

---
Ignore the other comment because it's incorrect. Sylvanas didn't do anything. She just exploited the circumstances to become the new leader of the freed undead, but she did nothing to actually free them herself.
---
Undead regain their freewill when their connection to their master is weakened or severed. For the Scourge in Lordaeron, it happens in WC3 after Ner'zhul loses his strength. This is even reflected in the fact that Arthas loses levels each campaign mission, since the LK is weakening. That's the whole plot of the Frozen Throne and Sylvanas is secondary.
---
Other undead also freed themselves without being associated with the Forsaken. There's no single faction or term for them all, but many individual NPCs are ex-Scourge undead and not part of Sylvanas' crew.
---
It‚Äôs funny. When I first learned about addons and how to install them I would just download whatever and would think that looked awesome just because it was different, when in reality it was god damn hideous lol
---
Sure, but I will defend anyone's right to be able to police who they want to play with.
---
Condition aside, it's been washed after every use. Last time I wore it was for BfA launch! Just sits in my cupboard. Yeah, it's faded and frayed, it doesn't smell but it holds a lot of memories. That's important. If there was no WoW logo on it I'd have binned it years ago.
---
He says nothing wrong but y'all lil girls complaining all day. Piss off
---
It's just so suboptimal that it's tough to endorse. You CAN do it, but it's just not the best way. 
---
Simple reality is that eventually, you will want to learn to tank. It's very tough to even get the gear to late game dps without tanking dungeons. If you want to pvp? you want dungeon gear. If you want to raid? you want dungeon gear. If you just want to farm mats and play the auction house, you STILL probably want dungeon gear. Warrior is the most gear reliant class in the game, bar maybe MAYBE rogues (while leveling).  
---
And no dungeons are easier than the first few dungeons to tank. If not now, when? It will never be easier than it is at level 18. Waiting for level 60 to tank is silly, because people's expectations will only grow. It will not get easier for you to learn, it will get a lot harder.
---
To tank, just look at the level of the last boss of the instance. Subtract 2 levels. That's your minimum level (you can go 3 below, but go 2 if you are nervous). 
---
You need 6 abilities, and honestly you could skip the last one. 
---
Battle shout is so that rogues don't whine at you when you are waiting for the next pull. Throw dagger is so that you can pull less than the entire instance at once. Bloodrage is so that you can demoralizing shout when you need to but don't have the rage. Demoralizing shout is so that you can pull aoe threat so the healer can heal you and so that you can look stylish. Sunder armor is so you can put up single target threat on bosses when there aren't 4 mobs to demoralizing shout, and mocking blow is so that when someone is wailing on the healer you can get them to stop even though you don't have any rage. 
---
That's all you need to do deadmines or ragefire chasm. You CAN get a lot fancier for tanking, but that's really all you need. You can start thinking about revenge and interrrupts, once that gets boring, but honestly, you do not need any of that shit to start.  
---
And frankly, by level 18, if you are nervous and not super sure of what you are doing.... you probably will have played the game for like 10 hours. that's plenty of time to learn these 6 skills. 
---
If it is too intimidating for you to tank instances below 20.... it's going to be worse at 50+. Just sack up and start immediately.
---
&gt; Then they got gutted again to make way for legion weapon traits then we lost those in BFA and gained cast times on most of our abilities.
---
What else do you expect in a theme park MMO that keeps trying to stack expansion content on top of the others?
---
Expansions and infinite progression are antithetical to a persistent, holistic theme park MMO. At some point you have to prune to make way for more future expanions.

thats bavarian / austrian german in the chat :D

almost didn‚Äôt catch it myself, as a bavarian. 
---
written dialects are kind of strange - to me.
---
I raided as a feral OT right behind our warrior MT and when he was mia for that night I was the MT. Get the gear, practice tanking a lot, and be willing to cat/OT/whatever and when tanks don't show up for raids treat that as your chance to shine. If you know what you're doing and you've gotten the gear, the healers will love healing you, the DPS will love your threat, and they won't care what the stigma is anymore.

That's it!  I don't see the pathing illustrations that I have in mine but the text is word for word!

I knew that guild name as soon as I saw it. I no doubt was on the receiving end of your wrath on the ally side. Never made it to naxx but tanked MC and BWL.
---
It seems like there‚Äôs more to this than what you‚Äôre telling. The fact that you took your wife‚Äôs credit card to buy 15 subscriptions and doing other things she doesn‚Äôt agree with makes me think that you‚Äôve done other things that is giving this attitude towards you when you make these decisions yourself without her say in it.

I hope you mean guild bank alts when you say guild bank

Tipsout is just a idiot, and his guild will be suck.
---
I don't really hear him "acting like a child".  I think he has some lofty goals that are going to be difficult to achieve.  Especially when you consider that you have to coordinate and get 40+ people on board with the same goals and keep them motivated through several phases of content.  But I certainly wish him luck.

If only we can go back to this. Wow vanilla ruined the gaim!!  Bring back WoW Plain flavor!!!
---
I was just joking around in my above comment lol
---
Awesome! Time to print this bad boy out and play like the good ole days.
---
Joana has been claiming on stream that he think the fastest leveler should be Mage because of the AoE grinding potential.
---
I actually feel bad for you on how stupid you are. Legit i fucking feel bad for you.
---
well first of all, it was only 10 wow subscriptions, I'm not an animal.
---
Secondly, yes there were other issues, but it takes two to tango, and I saw in her emails that she wasn't exactly a saint either.
---
Is there a list for hipster boomers who cry about streamers 24/7
---
RDP isn't the right thing. Nvidia Gamestream/Moonlight should work good, or try Steam In-Home-Streaming.
---
Stadia is a supercomputer that streams games to your tablet for free. 
---
I don't think its unrelated, I think it's just a technical limitation that could be improved upon. Such as removing the instance between Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. One of the great achievements we take for granted  of Early Wow was that there was no Loading screen between each zone, imagine if there was no loading screen PERIOD. Thats what i hope the future of classic will be.
---
I played vanilla from day 1. 
---
Southshore and TM happened a few times but the fights were unplayable lag fests. They certainly couldn't be described as good pvp.
---
I had incredible PVP in WSG and Arathi. Amazing close matches where premades fought premades.
---
World pvp being good was very rare. It was usually just a one sided gankfest.
---
I participatred in PVP all the time. I'm just being honest here, world PVP was rarely fun.
---
here is another example of what "world pvp" was in vanilla. Landing at Chilwwind camp and dying as soon as you landed. Fun times right?
---
i made the decision not to sub, even though i've gotten into every blizzard beta since five years back for this reason. still not sure if i regret it.
---
Poor drawing skills?
---
I still fondly remember the epic BoE int gloves that dropped for me in vanilla.
---
My feral druid proudly wore them for the next ten years.
---
All I can say is that good luck, he will be going against much more hardcore people than he ever been. :P
---
Lol you must get hard every time your fingers touch the keyboard.
---
1. Extremely diverse classes. You have to have a strategy to beat each class as they are all so different. In the modern game, I basically do the same thing against everyone as abilities are very homogenized (use my defensive cooldown to counter their offensive cooldown, try to use my offensive cooldown when i have them in a stun with no trinket).
---
2. Items/consumables being unpredictable and very powerful. You never know when that fucker will pop a LIP, FAP, health pot, shadow reflector, etc, and you'd better have a way to counter it when they do.
---
3. Due to the high gold cost to even play the game (epic riding, respecs, consumables for raiding), resources in the open world become very important and this leads to the game genuinely feeling like you are in a constant fight against the opposite faction for control of these resources and people WILL kill you over grinding spots, herb/ore nodes, etc.
---
4. No flying, no summon stone at the dungeon entrance, longer cooldown hearth, the need to be doing stuff in the open world all lead to the game world feeling extremely alive and opposite faction players or groups of players will cross paths very often leading to a constant feeling of potential danger.
---
5. No sharding means you organically build up rivalries/truces with other players. That one undead rogue that always opens on you when you've just had to fight someone and the 2 mobs you had pulled? I'm killing him and camping him whenever I see him until he has to log or spirit res. Likewise, I'm not going to gank the nice druid who /cheered at me instead of killing me when I had too many mobs on me.
---
6. Damage compared to health pools/mitigation is quite high and you can actually get kills on people without popping your cooldowns so it feels fast paced and mistakes are punished more harshly. The balance of damage to hp gets a bit silly at naxx gear level but around BWL/early AQ patch it's perfect, in my opinion.
---
If you don't play classic wow like its your 80hr/week career, you're doing it wrong
---
Never claimed otherwise.
---
There can't be enough warriors on a server. They are the best tanks and are good dps throughout the expansion, becoming the absolute top dps in naxx gear. Polls indicating classes people will play don't show that many, about 16%, so its tied with the amount of shamans that will be there, which will be heavily populated as warriors horde side.
---
Yes that's what I was going for... heh
---
Yea, you don't get that many points in vanilla wow
---
No all I'm saying is literally giving everyone proof that you plan to grief. The word grief is what I'm getting at. Intentionally griefing is against rules and that can be looked as any way - blizzard left griefing open to interpretation because they take it by a case by case basis. Camping someones body for 15 minutes is just a dickish natural WPVP. Camping someone forever until they leave and calling it griefing and trying to get everyone else on your side in on it - it is griefing. 
---
Change the wording from griefing to literally "we dont want to deal with these players so we wont" and you probably wont get banned.
---
But just be warned. This can and will be used as evidence as griefing since you clearly state that is the  goal of this addon. To grief a group of players out of existance on your realm.
---
Also I believe Taurens had trouble los'ing the Murmur fight like everyone else
---
It's been so long, but did I not need one to carry my ammo for pulls? I assumed it was necessary I guess lol
---
Wooosh or w.e the kids say.
---
The current WoW-Pro levelling addon still has a bunch of guides by him, I think.
---
That guide saved my life in vanilla and I can't wait to do it all over again.
---
10 warlocks
---
Crap, been staring at these icons for too long... I'll switch them around!
---
You perform Snowball.
---
You are going to be so disappointed. Ele goes oom way too fast to raid, its a terrible raid spec. Its an ok spec for 5 mans when encounters only last for a minute, but if you want to dps in raids you need to roll class that doesn't heal.
---
Absolutely! If you're worried about everyone else knowing everything, just remember that there are plenty of people in the same boat as you, playing for the first time. 
---
In regards to time, the game will suck you in, but if you can keep your play time healthy, it'll be okay. Just recognise what's important to you and you'll be fine! 
---
I hope to see you in game!
---
This might not be the case in Classic, but on private servers the comp does matter because you need to CC certain mobs.
---
I have leveled over 10 Warriors to 60. 2 in retail vanilla, the rest on Pservers.
---
Not one of them have I leveled as Prot. Go fury or Arms and tank dungeons if needed. Groups will come around quicker and you learn both sides of the class.
---
At 60 I recommend tanking 5 mans until you get a bit of gear +hit gear so you can DPS effectively and if you are so inclined, reserve some gear(Not my style though).
---
I didn't even mean to type guild, fixing it
---
Seems very wordy
---
Nonchalantly promoting a schedule 2 amphetamine is kinda fucked up.
---
Hey, I think you put the wrong discord name in here.  I cant find you on discord.
---
well, playing in a pvp server already lowers your chances to world first by 99%
---
I'm totally prepared... except PAX West 2019 (4 Day game expo) is THREE DAYS after classic WoW launch. God, why?
---
If the pally is doing better dps then the casters, I don't see why you wouldn't give a BiS forever item to them instead of giving it to a caster who will replace it later. I also don't see why a pally would join a guild (or even be *able* to join a guild) that is so openly antagonistic to them that they'd disband over one necklace.
---
Spelladin does fine in blues until T2 comes along. Most of the damage comes from specific pieces of gear, like MCP and Scrolls.
---
Obviously it's going to sound hard to you if you imagine the worst possible situation for the pally, where the whole guild hates him and he does no damage.
---
The door in the throne room that is open in retail was closed until Cata, but there were tricks to get past it (I think in Vanilla it was running to a specific area of the room where you could duel for whatever reason and then having a mage sheep you by the door).
---
They wont.
---
Yeah.  Getting camped by those elite trolls was always fun too.
---
There‚Äôs no incentive to do bgs currently while every is grinding to 40. Once people can‚Äôt level anymore they‚Äôll be shorter queues.
---
Also it‚Äôs possible the queue system is broken, it is beta.
---
World firsts were 15 years ago lol
---
You can stoneform out of blind. Also you can use it when a hunter is spamming viper sting on you to have 8 seconds where you can heal instead of needing to spam cleanse to avoid losing mana.
---
Your addon didn‚Äôt exist in vanilla

---
The point of cloud gaming is to have a high end gpu for a relatively cheap price, to have a  gaming PC without buying one
---
You don't need a good gpu to run classic, a non gaming laptop will do just fine so what's the point
---
I address SotC judging on short verus long mobs in the video and state that you shouldnt use it for short fights.
---
Myself I never really liked ret aura and mostly use it for tagging/killing of low hp mobs
---
Anyone know the voice actor for this? Sounds similar to Peter Cullens‚Äô Optimus Prime.
---
Oh god. I didn't get to do this until Wrath, and my potato ran this fight at 1 fps...sometimes less. I was a tank. My graphics were so low I couldn't see poison. I'll never know how I managed it.
---
i laughed out loud
---
They took a Duolingo class.
---
They're going with the original design mount system (not 1.12's) where the training was inexpensive (20g) but the mounts were the higher priced part and required rep with the faction (80g). Being exalted with a faction gives a 20% discount.
---
every chat channel turning into twitch chat and one guy's cult controlling every resource surely won't have any impact on me at all
---
Devastate(Added in Wrath) at 5 on the hotbar is the biggest tell. 
---
Hey OP why lie?
---
Fanboy spotted
---
Yes... summit was Horde just like them. This is Staysafe, who is alliance. They couldn't protect alliance if they wanted to.
---
This was based on the 2008 April fools, I was gonna remake it at some point in godot for practice, it really wouldn't be that hard. I miss the good April fools.
---
You‚Äôll want the main hand to be the dagger from the last boss in SM lib
---
You really need reduced mana cost on shapeshift for the FC spec tbh, the most commonly used/accepted spec for that is 8/12/31 ( although some prefer to max feline swiftness instead but it's not really needed in wsg).
---
Rok'Holar IIRC.
---
Loved watching him smash Allies back in the day, would one shot clothies who dared look at him funny.
---
Oh okay the hypnotic or something
---
A lot of people are looking forward to the community aspects of the game. Each servers are different and the players on it make that community.  
---
Of course a server with streamers is going to ruin my experience.
---
I didn't play during the early parts of vanilla (feb 2006), and I never saw paladin tier drops during any MC run, but my exroomie who played on the same server and started at launch ensured me that it happened earlier on. So it sounds a lot to me like it was taken out at some point (maybe when they moved t2 out of MC or revamped the MC loot tables in 1.4 and 1.5?) and added it back in with 2.0 as alliance was about to receive shamans and horde paladins.
---
Is that better than the dream Walkers staff from BFD? staff
---
Sounds pretty cool. The one I watch is OG jeffrey
---
How hard it is to find a spot on a serious raiding guild core as a Resto Druid? The limited spots are a concern? I read that people take only up to 3 Resto Druids. Is this true? Can a Raid Leader take more than 3 Druids and still do well? I feel like shaman can be a better choice to healing.
---
I got my invite through Friends and Family this week. My connection at Blizz says there is pretty much no more invites at all going out. Even the names that we submitted for friends and family didn't all get approved (we sent 5 accounts total, only 2 of those got approved).
---
It seems pretty safe to say beta invites are done.
---
üôèüôè you too!
---
But Trolls cannot Tauren block mailboxes
---
So you kill people on auto run?
---
It's the scene where he says let's put it on...what?..the last suit you'll ever wear.
---
That won't work when there's dozens of mages trying to make it work at the same spots.
---
I love this, so charming!
---
Still have mine too. I yell at it because it demands uninstall, BUT I REFUSE!
---
That‚Äôs shattering- is that confirmed?

I had no party frame addons in this screenshot, but I think show pet may have been a UI setting.

is it more pathetic than following streamers around and doing their bidding?
---
I dinged 60 (only time in any kind of Vanilla) on my Warlock on Fenix with those yetis. :)
---
I think it would have been really awesome to have gotten in in the beginning and play in a small community of mostly big-name players. Now by the time I catch up it's gonna be much closer to the release date.
---
Oh no worries friend. Those were confusing times. I thought ‚Äúthreat‚Äù meant how hard you‚Äôll get hit because you were ‚Äúmore threatening‚Äù
---
The ammo pouch is needed for hunters since they go out and use hundreds at a time. Warriors only need a stack or two so it‚Äôs better to keep them in a normal bag so you can use the other slots for random junk.
---
Would love to see of all the T2 sets
---
But a Tauren troll can troll a Tauren's mailbox.
---
what happened on Moon Guard during Project 60 throws your "literally almost 0 impact" theory out the window.
---
If so, it will be Family &amp; Friends only. We are on 3 Out of 10 possible for F&amp;F.
---
And here we have a prime example of why you shouldn't join guilds pre-launch. You can already tell that two weeks into the game this is gonna be drama central.
---
Yeah. The ideal comp is whatever classes won't roll on your loot.
---
Grind.
---
It's still the cata version with horns
---
Dude it just makes me sleep.
---
Some of us like every single expansion...and the original. I know, a complete mindblow.
---
Paladins are the kings of efficiency healing and PvP healing. In raids  you will likely scale past priests in the later raids due to your efficiency. 
---
If you like more buttons, aoe healing, and stronger baseline heals early on pick priest.
---
This may be intentional. When they did the blizzcon talk about starting with the new engine's code, one of the reasons was bugs and exploits.

Disagree. Ive played with and without my friends. So Much more fun with friends, no matter which faction
---
Patch done! Still needs some styling updates, but it at least it works.
---
Wow. I can't believe there are bugs in a BETA!
---
HOW COULD BLIZZARD RELEASE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL BETA LIKE THIS?!
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
This!
---
You asphyxiated Sally?
---
I was listening to ClassicCast and they were talking about this. They said that horde will get Pala drops and alliance will get shaman drops. Is this confirmed? If it only occured in the pre tbc patch, I wouldn't call it Vanilla-like to be that way in Classic.
---
Yeah, I wish those memes were banned.
---
Devastate was added in TBC prepatch, but with the XP bar looks like maybe this was immediately after TBC launch?
---
it creates a cycle of griefer, yes.
---
Can I install uBlock on firefox as an extension the same way I have it on Chrome? Also when it chrome phasing out ad blockers?
---
Stonemaul, then we ended up eventually on wildhammer as the guild wanted a faction switch and merge. We absolutely loved both servers we transferred to.
---
People were super skilled and knowledgeable back in vanilla
---
Moonkins &gt; Yetis
---
1.12 BRE is a much better pvp weapon for warriors, give it to shamans/paladins
---
This may come as a shock, but it was pretty awful to try and pug a 45 minute run back then, and I believe the quest made it more difficult. I actually made a post on the community forums asking for a price and this was the economy of our server at the time.
---
Cook them when you aren't hungry and then forget them, then an hour or so later you can scarf it down with no issues.
---
Streamer on my pristine subreddit? I‚Äôm going to commit angry post.
---
I'd love to play with madseason
---
Make sure you toss all salad parts that are not needed
---
&gt;Taking 20 minutes instead of 90 minutes to find a group doesn't make the dungeon magically easier.
---
You can say the exact same thing about dungeon finders too, but no one wants them. World chat is just going to devolve into people spamming bs chat and will be abandoned by most players because of that, meaning people will just be looking for group in general within the zone or trade chat anyway. World chat was never successful, there's a reason it was abandoned. It's a horrible idea but it did exist in vanilla.
---
Oooh, thanks for the suggestion. I'll look into it definitely!
---
These are people who never got to be part of the racing in retail but always wanted to be. So they see this as their chance to finally be the bad ass "everyone" looks up to.
---
I really enjoyed Firelands overall
---
There will be a lot of people who have never played classic before. It‚Äôs an amazing game. I hope you try it out when classic releases and you like it.
---
Did you know that Blizzard bans people using streaming services like Stadia?  You will get banned for using the best current streaming service, Nvidia GEFORCE.     
---
Seems they think people can hack/share accounts/multibox or something using these services, so they have banned using them with WoW.
---
How

I leved an alt from 58 to 60 and got some gear in AV.
---
anyone know if there is one for hunters??

Short answer: ya

Long answer: Yes.

POGGERS IN THE CHATTUH
---
Blacklist addons *did* exist during Vanilla.
---
From what i saw so far they gank people only once, not corpse ganking them
---
No, they looked like these horror shows: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3kKt6TZO5c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3kKt6TZO5c)
---
every one who attacked me AT LEVEL i beat some ever high level then me. how is attacking someone 30+ levels below you "fun". no your being a dick and you know it but no, "that's pvp".
---
you just try to act like that's the case cause cause you'll run away from anyone even close to your level cause you get off killing players that have no chance of fighting back.
---
You can't compare what people have on retail with what they can have on Classic. Should only the original scarab lords get to keep their mount, and on Classic the gates should just come pre opened?
---
I looked at spriests and also Pallies, but I fear that both classes would force me into playing pure healing or buffing in raids, since it's the thing that they do best. They are rarely seen as dps or tank, which was what I was inclined to do.
---
Do you plan to dps as a cat? Alliance is the only choice in that case
---
Look for Fenn‚Äôs Vanilla Alliance Leveling Guide this summer!
---
I anticipate a lot of guesses in this thread. This would be a neat question to ask one of the vanilla devs like Kevin Jordan on stream.
---
Yeah SSD fanbois cant do math. 
---
4TB is like 99.  SSD is like $400-500
---
Tranq shot manual drops from a boss in MC, so you'd only have one if you were trying to clear him on the first lockout
---
Big if true, so you wouldn‚Äôt need the 2 component trinkets?
---
Don't lie you and I both know you don't have a wife and kids. You're some 27 year old neck beard working at gamestop.
---
I really don't understand how you've managed to convince yourself that having the game run on Google's hardware and then streaming it your computer is going to somehow magically remove the need for loading screens when moving to a difference instance.
---
What you're describing would likely require the game engine to be completely recreated from the ground up, which is not only something Stadia wouldn't help with in any way, it's not even relevant to the purpose of Stadia.
---
Ahhhh right. I didnt even check the faction in the screenshot.
---
No, this is really useful. I really hope you find some good ways to get value. I have sadly, felt like blacksmithing is the worst leveling profession, bar none. If you can find anything to make it viable, good on you.
---
I'll accept legged Ragnaros as a boss (not the final boss) in one of the last WoW expansions when/if they basically start throwing every big bad ever at you.
---
Trick is Viewport addon. And a map one off.
---
It's about 50/50 or so. They're both really good, it's not like rogue is trash, it's second best dps.
---
Buy CURVED LCD instead. 
---
It is really more effective on reducing fatigue on your eyes.
---
Everyone on that shit bucket hype ... 
---
But on a serious note the pros do this 
---
1)Buy a 250$ low end PC 
---
2)Enable RDP on main desktop 
---
3)connect to main PC from low end laptop 
---
4)poop and play wow in a real bathroom
---
Any warrior can just stand there spamming buttons, but when the MT falls or fucks up and no warrior taunts the raid leader will go nuts on you. You are expected to equip a shield, taunt and survive for long enough that the MT can be ressed and resume tanking.
---
Your posts are the equivalent of Asmongold if he didn't stream. [Get out of the basement and get some sunshine.](https://i.imgur.com/y8Ea8jB.gif)

Ok, but this addon specifically did not.

tfw you've put in thousands of hours on Pservers, the past 4 years and practice leveling routes everyday...

Red = dead. Whether level 10, raid geared 10k health t3 tank, autorun AFK or some guy at 5% health.

It was longer than that.

TBC pre patch was released around 5 december 2006.

TBC was released 16 january 2007.
---
twitch chat is probably a worse echo chamber than most subreddits around here.
---
Damn, time to LFG wife on here
---
Interesting, thx !
---
Looking forward to a 3 hour log in queue because 10000 vievers create a char an my server to see the streamer running around
---
Worked fine on private servers with triple or quadruple the population on release than what we'll experience on Classic due to layering.
---
An Orc Shaman, an Undead Priest and a demonically possessed Chewbacca?
---
I peaked in beta, first slime I killed dropped the bag.
---
Depends on the level of gear, rogues if they catch you out of form, can kill you before the CC's run out. Warriors with great gear again if they catch you out of form, you're pretty much crushed.
---
Warlocks, all about surviving the fears and healing through the dots!
---
Agreed. Maybe in theory, in a bubble, but in practice it's just not possible. Hunters tag and single target kill potential with little downtime is simply unmatched while leveling.
---
What compels someone to make a post like this?
---
And Taurens somewhere they had to dismount to fit in, but I do not remember where and when was that.
---
It's not really just that if they could heal, they made you heal, it's that their dps and tank specs were VERY subpar compared to their healing specs. 
---
A Prot pally could tank dungeons okay, but when you throw him into a raid, he can't keep threat for shit. He's so far behind warrior, that there's just no reason to take one as tank when they actually make good healers. Same goes for Druid with Bear tank, though it actually had a few niche uses on select few raid bosses.
---
Ret/Feral/Boomkin/Ele/Enh dps were in the same boat, subpar dps and in the case of feral, though I didn't personally play with it, I am told it had a horrible, annoying rotation to boot. They were just subpar compared to all the other dps classes, why would you take one if you had a mages and warriors to choose from? Their heals though are good, so people take them on their heal specs.
---
---------------
---
The truth is, if you really want to go ret, you can find a casual guild that will let you. If you max out gear and use all consumables in the world, you can be on par with other classes that are shit geared and don't use many consumables, which will be everyone else in a casual raid. On top of that, this isn't 2006 anymore when everyone was trash. We have access to so much information these days that most guilds will be able to clear raids with an optimal group of 30, leaving space for 10 bullshit specs. 
---
Vanilla was never very hard compared to modern games or even modern WoW. It was just VERY time consuming and people were fairly information starved and didn't know how to optimize properly. This time around most people will have all the information they need and be able to overgear shit and deal with the what are today very basic raid mechanics very easily. While the few guilds actually trying for world firsts may not bring ret pallies, most people probably wont give a shit and will be willing to bring one or two.
---
That‚Äôs a pro tip for you
---
Nah, it happened during the pre patch to TBC. It was about 6 weeks or so..
---
I remember a guild getting t3 paladin ring from KT on their first kill... as Horde.
---
Just put all of the content on one layer? Easy enough when memory or hardware space isnt an issue. Layering for the dungeons and raids. It's possible, wouldn't require that much effort.
---
WoW died with Arthas
---
Ice-nay
---
I miss the ol' week-long Alterac Valley battles. This needs to come back.
---
&gt; Myself I never really liked ret aura and mostly use it for tagging/killing of low hp mobs
---
Cool. You don't like it. It's still objectively better vs anything but casters.
---
Not much of a turn on for me, but I guess everyone has their buttons
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Brah, i‚Äôm 27 and this picture is about 10x better than what i could do no lie
---
People are too touchy on this subreddit. If the animations are somewhere that they can revert them easily then sure. This is not that big of a deal though. I have played human since vanilla and never even noticed this. I would hope the devs don‚Äôt spend too much time on something like this.
---
I was talking about getting into a PUG. Most guilds dont need anything to fill
---
One man's good changes is another man's game ruined.
---
Do they i havent heard of that. Obviously if the CEO of activision enters a licensing agreement with Stadia, as the article mentions, then I don't see players getting banned from using their 'console' any time soon.
---
It was hard the first time when I didn't know what I was doing. I do remember stopping to farm rock elementals in the Badlands to get enough gold
---
Or a literal week. Truly epic.
---
&gt; They even will go overboard and harass said player.
---
yea they should be fucking shunned because if they streamsniped they're fucking losers. Also i find it funny that like 95% of this whole subreddit doesn't know the difference between streamsniping to grief/camp someone, and organically finding someone and camping them
---
Yeah it was Peter Cullen, he also did more WoW trailers, and the trailer for Warcraft III.
---
Judging by streamers own declining numbers, i think people are less enthusiastic about the beta now than when it first came out. He did 100k views on that DM run, now does 20-30k, which is still great but far from its peak. People want the real game.
---
Anyone who is burning to play Classic is already on pservers anyway. And the rest have come to terms that they wont get invited anyway and that the game is out at the end of august. Meanwhile there is E3 coming up, new content for PoE and its summer anyway.
---
"I really dont believe you can relive the past."
---
-Asmongold after Nostalrius launched.
---
Dwarf is better for PvP, no question. It's very effective vs rogues. Perception is only good if you already know the rogue is there but it's nothing that is going to change the outcome of the fight
---
We always took more than 3.
---
It isn't hard to find a raid spot as a druid at 60 people overblow it as usually the druid population on the server is &lt;10%. (Less at 60)
---
I got the rest of the year off with pay so I'm really going to no life it.
---
It's called 'layering' look it up bro. Not all of the content is on the same layer. If it were, then it would be possible to remove loading screens.
---
Something around these lines for flag carry:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AhwMAsDEBD6BMc0
---
- Less mana cost for shapeshifting
---
- Feral Charge
---
- NS + Swiftmend
---
- High crit chance for regrowth
---
I'm with you, I never understood the hype for the beta to begin with. I'll wait until the actual game is out in August and play that
---
I guess that means since you didn't raid Naxxramas in Vanilla, you shouldn't be allowed to raid Naxxramas in Classic.
---
This is a solid point to be aware of, primarily while leveling. It may be kinda a dick move or whatever, but I main a Warrior and while I level, if I'm putting together the group -- which I often do because it's super easy if you're willing to tank -- I purposely try to avoid inviting other Warriors. 
---
If I'm going to be doing the "hard" work, I don't want to share my loot. I assume most other warriors can just tank for themselves if they truly want to go.
---
I feel like that's the opinion I hear by people who never actually played on PvP servers for any extended period of time. I have never seen this as an issue on any PvP server I've played.
---
Do you get ganked? Yeah. Do you gank people? Yeah. Are there even fights where you both just run at people? Yeah. Are there uneven fights that you lose? Yeah Uneven fights you win? Yeah. There's a million different scenarios that can happen. That's why it's interesting. There's such a wide variety of things that can happen. 
---
The majority of people on PvP servers don't go out of their way to constantly camp people. There's even less people who camp low levels. Yeah they exist but it's really not an issue 99% of the time.  
---
As far as I'm concerned the extra fun I have 99% of the time is more than worth the 1% of the time I'm annoyed by somebody.
---
Definitely. Dream Waller‚Äôs has no spellpower
---
I remember there being a bit of a bump in cash flow past 40 too, and a lot of people leveling didn't get their mount at 40. Just keep playing efficiently and you'll get it at 41/42. But definitely save for it, it's just not the end of the world if you don't get it right away.
---
I swear to God it was the pally
---
are you suggesting a 10 day speed and WoW binge? oof
---
At the beginning defense cap is hard to hit. Defense is still mitigation in terms of parry and dodge as well. So ita never a bad talent to get, but later on when you're at 340 and you have a lot of extra defense gear you can probably sacrifice it for other talents if you really want to.
---
Dwarf is always BiS.
---
Warriors are very VERY gear dependent. Shit gear = garbage DPS. Good gear = good dps.
---
Wait is his face unique for this model? Looks like a bear
---
The same thing that compels them to give money to a streamer: Lack of real life friends.
---
You can only be this defensive about a streamer if you believe they are your friend. Its sad.
---
World PvP is fun because the world is actually alive. Nobody sits in their capital city jerking off all day in dungeon finder queue. Recognizing the people you are fighting on a daily basis builds community.
---
Alot of the PvP meta is now about unique items that provide you utility your class doesn't have. It allows you to go above and beyond your classes traditional kit to really take your PvP to the next level which is really cool.
---
I wish it showed any of the horde zones rather than just putting the horde in Westfall.
---
Tauren NE forms look like butt and I say this as someone who loves tauren and rolled a tauren Druid as their first toon.
---
OP, if they offered you the beta invite today, would you accept it?
---
Well she‚Äòs an undead highelve, so insteaf of using that bad highelv model and coloring it they went for the easyer and better looking path
---
Hah. There will definitely be more mages and Paladin/Shamans than Rogues.
---
Make bank alts and send white mats to them.
---
Played shaman and druid on pserver recently and raided on both, my honest opinion is enh sham can have 1 spot in raid , not for the dps ( abysmally low dps ) but for the totem twisting ( cycling through grace/WF totems to maintain both buffs) in a melee group with improved totems will make all melees beg you to be in their party.
---
If you couple that with a nightfall axe then it becomes a solid alternative, do note however that your entire mana pool will be dedicated towards maintain and twisting totems, you aren't given a debuff slot outside nightfall so you aren't allowed to use things like stormstrike / shocks, so you will basically just autoattack to proc nightfall and that's it for raid dps, it's more of a buffer /raid dps boost playstyle instead of the current BFA spec ( speaking in terms of raids only).
---
As for ele, it is generally not as encouraged as enh for anything outside casual raiding, since it has severe mana (and gearing ) issues, it is generally not picked over other dps specs outside clearing old tier content where burst is mostly required, I also factored in the mana consumables and buffs that can be used to help the spec but even then you have to downrank spells by a lot to maintain any form of mana in a fight over 30 secs, it's also the only shaman spec that doesn't favor totem twisting since if you twist you won't be dpsing anyway so might as well be resto or enh spec for that.
---
Druid, actually has higher dps as feral than shaman though it's still lacking , at best if the feral has bis gear and tricks ( skill cap /power shifting / using gnomer mace etc ) they'd still average slightly below an average rogue, so much effort for so little return isn't advised as you might as well level a rogue then if you really wanna play an energy based melee dps.
---
Balance suffers from the same issue ele shammies have ( almost exactly the same issues) so they tend to be avoided outside casual guilds, even moonkin aura isn't enough to offset losing a dps slot in semi/hardcore guilds etc, but in casual guilds i guess it's fine.
---
Tank druids are actually the most favored hybrid role outside healing ( surprisingly ), in my old super hardcore guild ( cleared naxx first week) we've had a good feral off tank for almost every 40 man raid, they're incredibly useful on a lot of encounters and they can alternate to cat dps when it's not their turn to off tank and the added B.rezz / innervate etc is great.
---
The only other hybrid dps that has had a spot for every single 40 man raid is shadow priest, although these spots are usually very tight ( usually 1-2 hybrid slots per raid at most ).
---
Hope this gives you an idea of how it's like for the min/maxers, although for casual raiding it doesn't really matter what specs you bring if your goal is to clear the raid without any sort of time limit.
---
I can‚Äôt wash a hot pocket down with water
---
Why do they just appear all of a sudden? He had no chance to avoid them.
---
Orgrimmar is a wonderful home. Safe and warm. Maybe except for Gamon.
---
I just wanna know the BiS for feral cat form druids, is is Manuel pummeler? or the omook one?
---
Reported for violation of rule 6. /s
---
xD
---
Oh true I wasn‚Äôt sure how much int sp was worth
---
So then the example was of sharding not lauering
---
Wrong weed for gaming then. You need one that makes you high and not a stoner
---
You are definitely in the minority. I would love the opportunity to test things out. Getting burnt out isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôd have to do if you got in. No life on Classic launch, not on beta. That being said, the streamers that are streaming the beta 24/7 are kind of killing the hype for me, so I‚Äôve stopped watching them for the most part.
---
Honestly. Yes. That is kind of why I am thankful that I did not get in.
---
I feel bad for you that you felt compelled to write this post, because you are under the belief that these people on your monitor are your "friends". Hence your desire to protect them.
---
Its really sad, and your animu esque name tells me you watch anime lonely at night, hugging your waifu pillow waiting for favorite streamer to come online, so you can pay them money to say your name.
---
Healing on healing classes in vanilla is very boring. As a druid you're mashing various ranks of healing touch over and over again.
---
There's HoT's but they cost a ton of mana, and unless you have a pile of +healing they won't be mana efficient.
---
I'm interested to see what kind of server populations they're going to be aiming for. 3k concurrent with around 5k total active players? Looking at the stats for the past few weeks, I'd guess the total average Twitch viewership for Classic WoW is about 50,000. Even if 5% of those 50k roll on the same server and actively play, that'll be 2,500 or half the total active target which could be a problem.
---
Dps hybrid is a much better pvp spec true. I‚Äôm just talking in general for totems. They aren‚Äôt useless but you just need to work on playing around them and placement.
---
They're giving us a ruined version of AV?? I mean, it was sad that the faction that couldn't pull enough reinforcements at 3AM to replace the attritive losses always lost, but probably 2 out of every five of my best WoW memories came from that old AV. Still remember Queing for a month to get in to my first one (Horde didn't like to play that long for a nearly guaranteed loss), playing hard for all 9 hours of it, and topping the chart when it ended in the wee hours. (Warlock)
---
After the first set of changes that gave the advantage to the side with the higher density of serious/talented players (Horde), we started losing every fight. I still remember stealing a win by summoning 25 members of the raid to the frozen river behind the command hut, and sniping the general as the horde over-committed to taking the bridge.
---
OMG I miss Vanilla
---
Do the hinterlands or duskwood!
---
Used to have a lot of fun doing this when waiting for naxx
---
I need my RPPVP T-T
---
The example for layering will be noticeable in a zone too as zones are part of a continent...
---
Troll Hunter to start. Will level mining/herbalism. Rush to 60 saving all my ore and cloth to feed to my main. Once 60 I'll make my main as Orc Warlock. Will level tailoring and engineering.
---
Depends. If theyre green and I want the HK, sure... I don't go AFK in the world and expect to be safe. Especially being alli in horde territory, like in this clip.
---
Yeah that's why I said there's a FAQ on MMO Champion that states there will be no front shredding
---
Just grind mobs a few levels in mid 30s.
---
Dont buy skills you dont need
---
Get skinning
---
Ez mount @ 40.
---
I had 150g at lvl 40.
---
Grinded mobs from lvl 36-40.
---
Confused it releases Aug 27th at what time in the afternoon? Some people say 26th?
---
I know what layering is.
---
Neither it, nor Google Stadia can be used to remove loading screens between instances.
---
You very clearly have zero understanding of how any of this works on a technical level.
---
This discussion is pointless.
---
Imho, Wintergrasp was the culmination of what they wanted to achieve with AV. The only further step would have been to integrate it tighter to the main world, like the capture points in TBC zones.
---
Like what? I've tried a number of kinds but they all just knock me TF out
---
Nostalrius is responsible for this.
---
Plus that one ex dev that literally printed out the petition and took the stack of papers to Brack in person.(forget his name but he was on classic cast a couple times)
---
But I doubt that had anything to do with it.
---
No names or number of realms have been announced.
---
PvP, PvE and RP. No RP-PvP currently planned.
---
If you‚Äôll be playing a warlock on classic launch I definitely recommend joining the classic wow warlock discord. Tons of useful info in there https://discord.gg/HHfM4V
---
Oh boy another one of these.
---
OP is watching Asmongold as am I, and he felt compelled to White Knight his ass and sperg out on the sub when he doesn't need any defense from you.

I prefer using Teamviewer for my streaming purposes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall

Adderall is amphetamine. Literally.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine
---
&gt; Trade names	Adderall
---
You seriously believe that? I'm gonna say rogues hold the numbers at release. It will fizzle out but they will never be anywhere near the least popular class
---
**Adderall**
---
Adderall is a combination medication containing four salts of amphetamine. Adderall is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine class.

---
**Amphetamine**
---
Amphetamine (contracted from alpha-methylphenethylamine) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone.

---
It's true
---
Too few, and they'll have a hard time getting rid of layering by phase 2. Too many, and they'll end up with very low pop servers after the tourists leave.
---
I suspect the precise determination of the number of servers at launch is one of the hardest decisions for the Classic team. I bet they'll err on the side of too few, because adding servers later is easier than merging them.
---
I didn‚Äôt say he was always right :p
---
All you need is IV drip with glucose, saline and catheter. Colon cleanse the day before and no solid foods. And finally amphetamines.
---
What about a video of someone getting layered without any grouping happening at all?
---
youll be able to tank easily, dont expect the game to  be hard.
---
&gt; But on a PvP server, we can affect their ability to grind.
---
So you want people to look at people's streams to find out where they are to kill them? That's basically the same thing as using a wallhack in counterstrike. It also goes against what makes vanilla wpvp good and fun. And that is *organic* and *natural* pvp, and streamsniping someone makes it forced and unatural, like, you might as well just play BFA at that point lol
---
No they didnt exsist until late wrath. You dont earn any xp for battlegrounds
---
I mean, Soda even said himself "I will camp someone for hours just to be an asshole". I see no difference between being a twat and doing that, or stream sniping someone for hours. They're both "fucking losers" at that point.
---
I understand that you think this is pointless, so I'm perplexed as to why you haven't explained how it could be done, in a meaningful way, instead of going into a character assassination mode on me.
---
i doubt layering will happen to those who race to 60, once ahead they mostly have zones for themselves.
---
If you haven't been diagnosed with autism until today, you have now. Good job.
---
You dont need that. 
---
You can have a 45:55 server population when the streamer is on the server.
---
He leaves, 10% on his side leave also.
---
Now you have 35:65. More people get pissed just by bad balance, leave and voil√† you got 20:80 server pop.
---
Boomer memes
---
Legendary
---
Great take. Another streamer thread.
---
I could be wrong, but it's mostly a pvp weapon I think. It's a good 2H, but the proc is useless in MC/BWL and anyone using it in raid is playing a suboptimal spec to begin with. Personally, I think it should just go to whoever will put in the effort to have it crafted.
---
**Giving him legs was a logical step forward!**
---
what did the nelfs do?
---
Giving him legs transforms him from an awesome fire lord into some fucked up anthropomorphic furry fire man.
---
That's a bold statement.
---
I'm on the fence on rolling a rogue or a feral druid. I played feral druid in tbc, wotlk and legion, it's a class I thoroughly enjoy, however from what I've read and from looking at the talents in classic, it looks like the feral druid in classic is completely different and pales compared to tbc and wotlk (I loved feral in wotlk).
---
I've been reading that druids in classic need to farm ridiculous amounts of consumables, even farm weapons with charges? Use a blue 40 helm into end game? And that just to be on par with other average dps. It's ridiculous to me. Is that the right picture on the state of feral in classic or is it exaggerated?
---
With Cdew, Soda, Shroud, Sonii etc. playing in one guild it certainly is possible.
---
Remember that MC isnt about the best classes but who can bring the most 60s into the raid prepared.
---
A hardcore guild consisting of 40 druids would take a dump on any semi hardcore guild with a proper roster just by having 40 60s at day 7, farming pre raid BiS until day 10 and clear MC at day 11.
---
It's hardly character assassination to point out that someone who unironically believes that Statia is a ["supercomputer"](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/byagcf/porting_classic_to_google_stadia/eqfdx4z/) with ["unlimited power"](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/byagcf/porting_classic_to_google_stadia/eqfcmdk/) doesn't understand how technology works.
---
You‚Äôve all seen your mom naked.
---
I bet this sounded alot funnier and more creative in your head, than what it amounted to
---
This is why you are on twitch spamming the same emoticons, because you are not clever nor creative. You are a follower, a wallet, and nothing else. Stay in your lane.
---
That early in development they hadn't even begun to work on a majority of the zones. It wasn't a matter of them deciding to not show those zones, it was that they didn't even exist yet.
---
True, but my point was that they'll be in a layer with, let's say, 3,000 players instead of 12,000, and on the 12,000 private servers these AoE farming mages do just fine getting to 60 blisteringly fast, so I think it's safe to assume that they'll do just fine in Classic as well.
---
You use first aid in some raid fights so I‚Äôll let you figure that one out.
---
Oof - some of those models look pretty rough now that we know what came after that trailer.
---
Are you sure you aren't misunderstanding what he is asking? Afaik, you can't move game elements to another monitor. He's not trying to stretch the game itself into 2-3 monitors. From what I took away from his post, he wants the game on ONE monitor, but he wants to drag JUST the map itself off to the other monitor. That doesn't make any sense and isn't possible, afaik.
---
Cheapshot, the Night Elf Rogue is my hero.
---
Awesome... I used the Alliance version several times on different alts. Eventually replaced it with an add-on, but I loved those guides.
---
His entire post history is white knighting for streamers and its pathetic really. You'll find his twitch if you google him and hes a streamer himself, but I use streamer very loosely.
---
H A V E  S E X
---
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW A MOLTEN CORE EXPLODES, YOU CANT
---
I should have rephrased that. It's a immensely powerful computer with infinite scalability in terms of upgrading capabilities, over the long term.
---
Envision what you want to do at end game, and go with that.
---
Dont pick a class or spec on early game, or leveling. At the end of the day, you will be in BWL spamming ______ and your role will be to _____. Fill in those gaps and pick that class.
---
I get that, still wish they hadn't put orcs in Westfall though.
---
This was hot fixed in live. I do remember the first MC/BWL after the patch, our guild got nearly a full set of shaman gear (alliance) before they fixed it.
---
Tyrion Fookin Lannister*
---
First of all, that isn't true.
---
Second of call, even if it was, it would still have nothing to do with removing instances, or the need to go through a loading screen when moving between them.
---
that remains to be seen. 
---
At AQ40 progression sheer masses really can fuck over guilds.
---
On Nost there were 500 horde players fighting \~150-200 hardcore alliance players and eventually the more casual horde player claimed victory just by zerging.
---
the same can happen in the tunnels farming carapaces. If they have 10players against each hardcore guild's one, it pretty much becomes impossible.
---
Also a streamer could just summon his minions to contest Eranikus until the hardcore players have to give up.
---
I would argue that if you want to invest 100 gold at level 40 on a pvp server, the best investment I can think of is picking up all relevant pvp class skills.
---
&gt; As far as I'm concerned the extra fun I have 99% of the time is more than worth the 1% of the time I'm annoyed by somebody.
---
i had a max level on a rppvp server and i only ever saw ganking or groups ganking. 95% of my world pvp experience has been bad. when i came across a lover level i NEVER ganked them. sometimes i would follow them and help them kill mobs after they "tagged" it. do to the shit people did i will NEVER roll a pvp servers and will NEVER turn on war mode. i have even talking to a few in game and most world pvp players are not about anything fair.
---
I didn't think this applied to anything but slam and spells. Does ss really reset your swing? Ms/bloodthirst/execute don't
---
Youll be a lot more comfortable trying tanking at lower levels where expectations and consequences are both lower. Leveling is a learning experience, thats why you get drip fed abilities so slowly.
---
In low level dungeons, clothies can take a few hits, as you get to 40+ it starts getting a lot harder. By the time your 60, if you dont know how to tank, you wont be able to get through a dungeon without learning first.
---
Sure no worries. In your OP you did mention casual pve and PvP and were looking at casters so I thought I‚Äôd mention it as they often are overlooked. Shadow definitely can have its own in raiding higher end content, but they are absolute monsters in PvP. Cheers mate and good luck
---
I'm rolling an orc warrior. The 50% stun resist is great. Plus the bonus to attack power is pretty good.
---
_"so that the content can get tested properly"_
---
...said the guy who explained why he doesn't report bugs, and SM-Rushes instead of leveling.
---
Very cool. Menacing!
---
You can run as many /run and /script commands as you'd like in combat, but CastSpellByName and CastSpell are protected functions so you can't use them in addons or macros ever (expect for a few specific spells like profession menus). As you said this prevents you from making 1 button rotations because you can't do any conditional casting of spells.
---
You need to fix sorting of potential impact.
---
That's what happens when you are the perfect punting size.
---
It's inversely proportionate to the amount of happy mages in the guild haha
---
&gt;Using a bucket instead of a throwable sock
---
Casuals
---
Dark Iron? That's not possible. Perhaps you saw burnt magma.
---
Retribution Paladin; Crusader Strike
---
Yep, just Crendor.
---
Anyone else circle the perimeter of Arathi to farm iron?
---
If you want to use an entirely third party program, sure, it might be possible if they allow live tracking of locations in the API. I'm not sure an actual WoW addon itself though can make out-of-game pop ups like this would require though. 
---
He's not wanting to have the game on 2-3 monitors and drag the map around like you can do with simple Move Anything addons. He wants to have an independent, but live updating map on another screen, which would require an entirely third party program that I am not sure is even allowed in the ToS if it's not a direct in-game addon. I could be wrong on that though.
---
Can still do that in 1.12 version :/
---
Is #5 actually legit?  ELI5
---
even if you don't get it right when you hit 40, by 42ish you'll definitely have the cash. You make a ton more money once you hit 40
---
I like how the tree's roar at the end is mixed in with the dying sound of a pig.
---
You will be standing in front of the AH flipping and ruining server economies by selling your gold to a Chinese trade site. Until Blizz ban you and you get a new account.
---
Aren't you contradicting yourself? You said mouseover macros didn't work in vanilla without making rogues lose cp, this guy basically agreed, and now you say it wasn't so?
---
Here ya go mate, this is what I use.  
---

---
Is that devastate in your hot bar?
---
Congratulations you have awful taste
---
You still need all 3 to get the staff.
---
In the early days, when the staff had just come out, the normal order was "Eye of Divinity" -&gt; "Splinter of Nordrassil" -&gt; "Eye of Shadow". Eye of Shadow is a BoE drop that is farmed, but you don't know you need it until you read the text on the Splinter. 
---
I got the Eye of Shadow first, then the Splinter with the help of Spectral Essence, then with a little luck, and when I finally had enough DKP saved up, got the Eye of Divinity from MC. I was immediately able to create and equip Benediction for the Rag fight.
---
Hi, /u/FawTwenti
---
Night Elf priest, so I can shadowmeld and mind control people off the lumbermill cliff.
---
I mean... 120gb SSDs are only $20 so if your goal is to just improve operating speed and one game (wow) then this is the cheapest option one could ever hope for! Highly recommend
---
its obviously a much different story on the horde side. 2h arms would still net you top dps as a warrior because of the wind furry totem.
---
We‚Äôre not worthy
---
See above answer ^_^
---
Itbstill works today in live you can do it in av agaonst the horde tower bowmen
---
Any chance we can get a link or something? Anyone know about this post?
---
7:37 is that an unarmored epic mount? :O
---
It's true! 
---
The teraflops on Stadia are used for the GRAPHICS CARDS. That means its essentially a mainframe computer, with a ton of power, built to run hundreds if not thousands of instances all at once. That my friend, is a supercomputer. 
---
Second, it would have EVERYTHING to do with removing instances because the only reason instanced content exists is because of memory issues. Don't you think they would have preferred to make the game without loading screens, if they could have done so?
---
Were not in Arathi cause were leveling still. Unless you SM spammed with a tweaked group that was already BIS for more hours than a regular working day would allow you're probably still leveling to 40. Why would they queue into AB to get slaughtered due to gear and level differential
---
But naxx did exist. Your addon did not.
---
you're a fucking idiot
---
The way it was actually done in the raid was pretty rad, though. You fight him like you normally did in non-heroic mode, and when you thought you had him dead he rips himself out of the magma pool and starts fucking up your shit. It felt extremely good as a boss fight.
---
Plus, there were lots of other fire effects and such going on during the fight so you didn't just see his base running around with dumb legs.
---
I know this is all a meme given the "former" comment
---
&gt;  it looks like the feral druid in classic is completely different and pales compared to tbc and wotlk (I loved feral in wotlk).
---
YEP! Feral wasn't really recognized as a "VIABLE" spec until TBC mostly. And even then, not the greatest.
---
&gt; I've been reading that druids in classic need to farm ridiculous amounts of consumables, even farm weapons with charges?
---
Charges, not sure what you mean, but weapons are literally stat sticks. Weapon damage is irrelevant to druids. It comes down to +agi/armor/stam on the item.
---
&gt; Use a blue 40 helm into end game?
---
Yes. You mean this thing: https://www.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm
---
BIS, forever because of power shifting (shifting out of form and back into form for energy gain).
---
Ferals aren't going to be on-par with "pure" dps classes, but druids do things nobody else can't.
---
No it doesn't require a killing blow, what you're thinking about is improved drain soul, which you only use for leveling.
---
We need a petition to get pre-1.12 av back !
---
I agree with you that they timed giving the beta to the streamers too early.  We‚Äôre still basically 3 months out.  Streamer numbers will go lower and they will have lost a lot of the younger audience hype.  They could‚Äôve ridden that 100k streaming audience in late July and then 2 weeks later people can download game and pick out servers and then they‚Äôre hooked until 8/27.  
---
I started on a private server with the beta hype...but now im starting to lose interest in leveling a character i‚Äôm not gonna play in a few months.
---
LOL best thing I've ever seen.
---
I want to be in the beta because I'm aching to play, but I logged into a pserver and knew if I had access I wouldn't want to play it. Honestly my number 1 thing going to classic over pservers Is I know my character will be there 1-2-3 years from now, and the beta is the opposite of that
---
I just put together a new gaming rig.  And I found myself on the Blizzard webpage, having signed up for Beta -- hoping that I would get chosen again -- but damn, I was about ready to download the game, and start a subscription just to play my mage to 110 and see some of the new content.  
---
Came here instead to be talked out of it. :)  :)  :)
---
Wait for the whelps to come out naked in phase three.
---
They‚Äôve also stated you have an option to get on another character. If you choose to not do that, they won‚Äôt action.
---
However if you do, and they hunt that character too (hint: this is why you shouldn‚Äôt name every character similarly), then that is not griefing and actionable.
---
Just join a guild based in a different time zone
---
Low effort troll...next.
---
So is AV 1.12 gonna be in classic at 2019 release?
---
Nice Devastate on your bars. I suppose it could've been the last couple of weeks before TBC release.
---
Hi! 
---
Still no good news. I've discovered that only profiles is not enough.
---
Firstly (at least after first launch) Z-Engine sends SoapUI requtest ot non-existing server for taking a list of available MODs.
---
Without particular response it doesn't allow to import any profile (thanks God profiles aren't strictly keyboard-specific and they support few keyboard models including ours - that's the only good news)
---
So there is only a few ways available:
---
1.Emulate SoapUI response (I'm no idea about proper response format, it requires a manual code investigation)
---
2.Hack Z-engine for avoiding that particular behavior with list of MODs
---
3.Finding some guy who has not reinstalled the system for years and has list of MODs in his Z-engine. So if he may share his folder there is a chance to resurrect keyboards.
---
4.For Classic and BC keyset this problem is much more harder. There is a 0.0001% that somebody keeps original MODs for these keysets. I think firstly is it necessary to fix a Z-engile problem. After that it may possible to recreace from scratch keybings for them.
---
Every warrior needs to learn how to tank 5mans.  It teaches you the importance of threat management which is handy for dps warriors.  You will have a negative impression from guildies if you only dps and theyve been looking for a tank for 40min.  You will get gear faster by being able to build a group comp without platewearers.  Any dps warrior who only dps's has a chip on their shoulder to be in the top5 of your raidlogs.
---
If unarmored mounts got put in the game, I'd probably switch to Horde for that White Raptor.
---
Well, if you guys play Warlock and Paladin then your mounts at level 40 are free.
---
So do we get some old AV at wow classic release this summee? Or does it come later?
---
32 over here. Shit is hilarious.
---
If you want to do decently as a feral... Yes it's true.
---
This is for a true min maxer though.
---
A feral is valuable for their utility. You can decurse for lucifron, dps for magmadar, decurse for gehennas and then offtank on Garr.
---
But... If you want to be good (not topping the meters, that's never gonna happen). You need to put in a lot more work than other classes do. Both in farm and skill. Powershifting is one of the more complex rotations to pull off.
---
And for all this work, some casual rogue will still out dps you.
---
Now, I do love bears and I feel they are a valuable asset to the tank team as a offtank. But a straight kitty dps is... Lacking.
---
Apparently
---
Yea, agree. I'm currently looking at a build where I can get hitcap from gear alone, for a retribution paladin that could potentially save up to 8 talent points to get capped.
---
they type "c c a f" and it comes out as "o o g a" on the alliance side.
---
Ahh okay, to be honest I was a hunter main and warrior alt so it‚Äôs a case of I know a class and their spells well enough to kill it but not play it. I did nax etc on my hunter so thinking of going warlock for this run through so can‚Äôt wait
---
You'll find out on 13th of August
---
He was a cool dude!
---
On horde you take 1 or 2 druids.
---
On alliance you can take more.
---
Group XP bonus only starts at 3 party members, there is none if you duo.
---
I'm going priest so stick warlock homie
---
I good player knows that there are things more important than damage meters. 
---
People only focused on damage meters are the idiots that ruined modern wow because they don't understand that a class can be useful in other ways then "uUuugh I'm doing damageee" that is why classes lost their identity.
---
If you roll a warlock you do it knowing you won't top the meters by default, you know you are support and dps not pure dps. Sure that changes a bit by AQ and Naxx but you get the point, mages will always have more dps than warlocks.
---
A good warlock plays the class well by embracing being there to summon and give health stones and using curse of elements to make mages better.
---
A bad warlock is drooling over damage meters and ever using drain soul because that would mean he casts 1 less shadowbolt maybe.
---
Thanks a lot and yeah that‚Äôs the game plan
---
Nobody, not even speedrunners carry 20 plus warriors into a single raid. That‚Äôs half the goddamn group, not to mention horrible for loot distribution.
---
Based on your post history you are GMT+2, so unless you manage to find a Kazakh or Russian (Siberian) guild to play you might be a bit screwed indeed.
---
The API that makes the addon possible is and was available. Your argument is really stupid.
---
Not that easy if he is on EU servers.
---
The problem is that I'm already in one of the latest timezones in Europe (GMT+3 apparently).
---
I played a mage in original vanilla and at first I was thinking about  repeating that, but I fell in love with playing a lock over the years and I'm gonna be a warlock for classic as well.
---
Same here!! Got 2 and a half weeks annual leave booked it!
---
We have to put a reason on the off duty system mine says "family holiday" :)
---
Though technically it's not wrong as I'll be shipping the wife and kid away for a week.
---
I mean fucking business!
---
&gt; The teraflops on Stadia are used for the GRAPHICS CARDS.
---
Brilliant.
---
This is getting ridiculous now.
---
I have better things to do.
---
Having fun living in your fantasy land where Google's magic computer can fundamentally altar how game work, just because it has a lot of processing power.
---
Pretty impressive for a level 40 gnome!
---
MONTY!!!
---
You countered yourself a lot here, complaining because of having to level in specific areas at certain levels for example during new expansion packs. You didn‚Äôt have the luxury of doing that in vanilla. At many levels there were areas dedicated to certain levels. They can either make more areas, which could make the world TOO big, and prevent as much social interaction, scale the zones down to levels, which you mentioned you didn‚Äôt like, or allow flying, which you don‚Äôt like and has a similar effect of limiting friendship. Complaint about xp gain sounds to me like you‚Äôre not gonna like classic. If you want it to be easier and have more quests, grinding mobs for entire levels might not be your thing. 
---
Also complaints about certain changes from cata seem hypocritical. New players tend to like the starting zone, it feels more war like. They aren‚Äôt badly designed, it‚Äôs just not the same as it was before. It‚Äôs nostalgia that you‚Äôre feeling. 
---
Not to say that many of the points you made weren‚Äôt valid, these are just 2 of the several comments that didn‚Äôt make sense to me. 
---
I think your comment was well organized but poorly thought on for certain points.
---
Seems like it.    
---
I mean, I understand Russian just fine (in fact I'm fluent, except I can't write for shit), so there's no language barrier there, but all of the Russian guilds I've seen seem to be in the same spot as I mentioned.
---
Also some of the loot, at least preraid BiS, should be on sale (ingame store?) so that we can save time and just hop into the raids. Who has time to run the dungeons over and over again?
---
you need to tank in 5mans
---
exactly...lol
---
Feral tank is acceptable, but requires effort to pull off(and only 1 per guild).
---
Elemental and enhancement shaman are not brought at by any semi-hardcore guild.
---
It was. I recall watching it before TFT was even a thing and going "WTF is this", while my friend kept saying there won't be any Warcraft after WCIII...
---
Have you thought of joining an America server? I had a buddy who played worth me in Vanilla that was in the UK. He selected central Us because his work schedule was chaos.
---
We‚Äôre to the age where latency won‚Äôt be a huge issue like it used to be.
---
It just takes one no life mage that gets ahead to completely beat the hunter, mage will get world first 60.
---
Hybrid tax, if you can do everything why does that class get to do more/better than a pure dps only class?
---
They will probably err on too many to prevent crashes at launch. Then likely consolidate lower pop servers, or let specific low pop servers choose a list of specific servers to transfer too, like back in the day.
---
Stealth!
---
Very very sneaky, sir.
---
The druid needs the on-use item manual crowd pummeler.
---
A item from gnomeregan with 3 charges. So you would farm and fill your bags with it and you could do great tanking while you had the buff on you.
---
Ye this MT guy was from Eastern Europe, literally everytime he jumped on the platform his internet would instantly die.
---
Sorry undead male stealth animation is best in the game. Looks stupid in retail do to the speed of stealth, but looks good slowed down.
---
True.
---
Russian server *shudders*
---
Omg yes. Things like goblin shredder charger, wolf riders, literally being able to contribute by capturing mines, etc.
---
Then it just became ‚Äúrun by the other Zerg and cap the towers ASAP‚Äù
---
That would require me to buy a completely fresh account though, no? I was hoping to make do with just renewing a subscription.   
---
Someone elsewhere did actually suggest the same, but I'm still unsure. It's not like I want to completely give up PvP, and I can't imagine PvPing across the ocean is all that great.
---
Wel the speed is oke for retail. The the mouse input isn‚Äôt fast enough, keyboard is oke.
---
The best part is that ‚Äústupid‚Äù argument is exactly the same as the one you were making with the original \#nochange comment I responded to. Streaming tech existed and was used during vanilla, just not primarily for video games. So, by your own logic you agree that streaming doesn‚Äôt apply to the \#nochanges. Thanks for clarifying.
---
I'm not in the "kill all streamers" train, but that shit is just so indicative as to why so many people hate this guy. It's just such a shitty attitude to have, when you've been given the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. If they're gonna make you priority number 1, you could repay them by actually doing the job.
---
WE GOT EM
---
That requires new accounts? I thought you could just select your area from one of the main screens? I‚Äôm I remembering this incorrectly?
---
If not, a good ole‚Äô VPN will get you wherever you need to be in the US.
---
I am not sure if you have any questions or concerns please visit the plug-in settings to determine how attachments are handled it well enough to be a good time to get the new house
---
Not gonna lie I was blown away when he stood right the fuck up in H Firelands
---
Where's that from, quest or drop? If it's RfC, maybe I'll have to make a suicide trip in as Alliance.
---
I mean it triggered you enough to respond so I think it's doing its job.
---
There will be at least 47 servers. One for each current region of each current type (minus the regions that have zero RP realms).
---
I guess that‚Äôs what differentiates the competitive raiding guilds, amongst the locks in the guild we were always trying to be top just for the banter in the lock chat channel. Besides by the time you‚Äôre wiping on most bosses night in night out there isn‚Äôt any chance to farm shards anyway and you‚Äôll have to do it before the raid like I outlined above, sure when content is on farm nobody gives a shit and you get some of the shards you need from trash but you‚Äôd be silly to show up without them, bringing only a few got you replaced (yes there was an add-on that let the RL/CL monitor consumables).
---
Otherguy was so far ahead of his time.
---
Yes
---
\#nochanges isn't an argument, it's a meme.
---
We don't want streamers on our server so we're going to force them off the server.
---
That's our argument.
---
Definitly a dkp app, where guilds can sign up and organize the whole thing, visible for all members. Could be a lot easyer than making a website
---
One thing I remember being different in Vanilla was how common it was to use outdated gear. Of course nowadays when tier 70 releases you expect to be in full BIS Mythic tier 69 and maxxed everything - but back then it wasn't the case (at least not from my experience).
---
I was doing Naxx (admittedly as a 2nd string raider) in a mix of T1, T2, ZG, and T2.5 - and I in general remember my whole raid looking that way - I mean there were just those weeks where nothing by Pally gear dropped for your raid and you just DE'd and cried.
---
Such was life back then, and frankly I'm looking forward to getting back to it.
---
Alliance is the best choice for a feral tank.
---
Fear Ward let's you tank fear mechanic bosses. Which you cannot do at all on horde side(no that trinket doesn't change that).
---
Blessing of Kings help you, windfury does not!(you won't get agi totem, melee need WF).
---
As for finding a raiding guild..
---
Tank every dungeon from lvl 1-60. Do a good job at it. Get to know ppl. Spend time farming prebis while tanking.
---
I don't like recommending feral for newcomers, but you seem like you know what ur getting into. Read up on Taladril! Keep up to date. Farm those pummelers, get enchanting for the bis trinket. Get warden's staff. All this will show a guild you really are serious about it.
---
Then don't be ashamed to heal for a little bit just to get your foot in the door in a guild ;) just be clear your long-term goals is to tank
---
with that being said trying to sqeeze into a 5man group end-game as a dps warrior can be fairly challenging. since you will gear share with the tank and what not. I remember just learning to tank because i couldn't even get in a  group. sometime if you make compromised on gear drops you can get in though regardless.
---
This isn't possible since classic is using secure frames and focus is not one of them that is allowed.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Crazy to think about how even what was shown took a few years to develop.  So a lot of the stuff we see in game is over 20 years old. How cool would it be to be one of the designers knowing your work from a different part of your life is still being enjoyed by millions around the globe.
---
After 24 hours, it became Adderall valley.
---
I just want beta access to create the slickest UI eva.
---
This is 100% correct!
---
Put in the work and you will rise quickly in your guild!(and on the server)
---
it's "full bore"
---
pservers have dynamic spawning on a completely different level. It might be possible with layer hopping in classic, but that would probably be considered an exploited world first 60
---
Several reasons why Druid doesn't work as any other Healing Class in PvP:
---
Your "flashheal" is Regrowth with a very bad mana efficency - if you go for downranked healing touch you need a lot of +Heal where your Stam/Int might begin to suffer. You'll really become viable with t2+gear
---
High Rank HT is easy interruptable and your HoTs might get purged (especially if you play Ally)
---
The big plus for Druid in PvP (beside the defending in AB / FCing in WSG) is the mobility/utility.
---
Attacking with 1-2 other stealthers an objective will bring the enemy team into trouble.
---
If you have any more specific question I'll gladly answer since I ranked Druid
---
/r/Wellworn

Devastate was released in 2.0.1 in December 2006. You could always see XP bar at lvl cap (it‚Äôs even in the original manual). In fact, there's no way a player could get the kind of level 60 gear shown in that shot and then clear MC up to Ragnaros without getting more xp than that, so it's clearly locked. Don‚Äôt try and call me a liar without having the facts. Thanks.
---
They didn't feature bb king in that blues medley?
---
Devastate was added in 2.0.1 in December 2006.
---
Orc Warlock. I love Horde zones, love the health-mana-pet interactions of the class, orc warlocks are just classic, and it's the one class I hit 60 with.
---
This has to be the worst subreddit of all time, literal facebook tier memes
---
Will this work with 1.12?  I recall being very upset that I couldn‚Äôt snow all my main tank during raids because they changed in mid Christmas.
---
Seriously this. AV was one of my favorite BGs when it first came out. I loved the hours long battles. It's just sad how they took the PvP out of AV. It's so rare now in there to actually fight pvp.
---
Considering devastate was released in 2.0.1 which was December 2006.
---
well explaining how to tab target tank in a single post, is likely not a good idea. at the end of the day its still tanking and you have to lead the group to victory or death. That is the biggest decision to roll as a warrior at least during early vanilla.
---
Ya, for the one lucky guy who gets the ignite damage.
---
My guess is we will find out the names of the realm before character customization is released. We would have to know the name and time zone of the server before we just aimlessly made a character on a realm we can‚Äôt log into.
---
Oh I didn't even consider that this might not be a thing in 1.12... I really hope it is!
---
You are already geared when doing speedruns. Speed runs dont occur during progression.
---
3screens can perhaps FOV?
---
Ten people who don‚Äôt suck.
---
I've been watching them here and there.  It's helping build some hype, but as an adult, going to be hard to justify the time sink needed for some dungeon runs and raids.  
---
Still plan to play, still plan to play more than I should, and will try to win the STV fishing tourney!
---
In my experience Russian players personality-wise are either very nice or absolutely terrible, with no middle ground. The worst of them usually infest f2p games so it might not be as bad as it sounds.
---
Great painting! I also love Arathi, and it‚Äôs also the area where the first mission in Warcraft 3 takes place. Great memories all around.
---
Right? It was the same for me. That menu dial in the middle was so cool! But... It really wasn't and took up so much of the screen haha. Glad we know better now.
---
We‚Äôre gonna need 40 men. Miners. They‚Äôll have to dig into the Molton Core to help cool it down
---
Rrreeeeeeeeee
---
Why doesn't it say Stormwind City?
---
I‚Äôm going to level as fast as i can and plan to hit 60 in September...2020
---
&gt;#nochanges isn't an argument, it's a meme.
---
It‚Äôs both.
---
&gt;We don't want streamers on our server so we're going to force them off the server.
---
That‚Äôs not an argument, that‚Äôs harassment.
---
You addressed the end of my comment, added nothing to the conversation. Incase u can‚Äôt read il say it again, nobody will ever carry 20 plus of any class into a raid EVEN speedrunners.
---
I love how in 2019 people think a response means they triggered them
---
I've died a lot of times in that zone over the years.
---
not as big of a foreshadow as this one
---
https://i.redd.it/xh616l5gs6331.png
---
Happy for you man, wish I could find my old guild mates from vanilla.
---
I‚Äôd get so many server firsts!
---
I actually can't imagine why anyone who isn't a streamer would want in the beta... We're mostly all adults now. Just wait, save it for launch day.
---
I don't actually know. My knowledge of playing on another continent comes from SC2 years ago, which has now been changed afaik.
---
Omg please warlock T3.

It did!  At the time FPS games graphics were steps ahead of WoW graphics.  Even at launch, WoW graphics kind of sucked compared to what was in other games at the time.
---
I believe the comment doesn't even appear, but I don't really use the functionality so you'd have to test it.
---
I don't really think theres a positive obsession about streamers. People post all swifty videos or videos from people from way back all the time. Doesn't mean they're obsessed by the person, just that it was something they enjoyed years ago. People are posting clips from streamers for the same reason, but better quality.
---
Awesome, I‚Äôm likening the idea of being a caster but still having my roots applied with micro managing the pet. 
---
Plus I literally don‚Äôt want to have to deal with the huntard BS again having to constantly prove myself that I can play to a decent level. I had a nax geared hunter and I still got doubted in pugs
---
Why stop at just preraid BiS?
---
I played more because of that message, don't tell me what to do, Blizzard! &gt;:l
---
Clip has been deleted?
---
Because back in the day, people didnt have the resources we have now. Most bosses will die in under 1 min so I wouldnt base you pick off who the the most deeps in pve. All classes are required for raiding and most of them have very basic rotations (if you can even call them that). Pick what you want to play or you will regret it. New toons takes a lot of time if you dont have support from a guild, and even then, most guilds wont just drop what they are doing to help you start a new toon and gear it up.  There will be so little raiding content for the first 6-8 months anyway, MC/Ony will take 1 night to clear, some can clear MC and BWL in a single raid night. Dont base your decision around raiding.
---
They are still in the game but no point spawning them coz it takes longer then winning does
---
What we need is people to look up what "1.12 AV" actually is, since so many people have been misled into thinking it's anywhere close to retail AV with reinforcements.
---
I shouldn't find this funny at 35. I do.
---
Who else you going to have as bouncers?
---
At 60 it can be hard to get in dungeons. Tanks dont want you to compete with them for gear and generally people rather want a class that offers utility. So basically anyone but you. Also if you are running dungeons you probably dont have great gear - and warrios really need gear. So there is some actual barrier of entry that people either have to work thorugh or spec tank just to get in. Once you have decent gear and start raiding, dps warrios are sought after due to their reliable damage output.
---
Good job! You should add a column with the average number of viewers.
---
Careful to not burn yourself out. It's a marathon not a sprint.
---
Blue PvP set levels of gear, some BWL items, things like that. You can still play the spec with poor gear, it's just not as effective in my opinion. 1/29/21 doesn't have that issue as much.
---
I believe you &lt;3
---
Yeah. They're using the 1.12 version of AV after all the nerfs. The good ol' rush to the enemy base to win version.
---
I'm also glad I didn't get in the beta, but more because I would see it as similar to a pserver. I know it's a beta and testers are supposed to be testing it, but when I play I want to immerse myself into the world and not worry about my character going away after a few months. I want to start playing the game at launch. I enjoy watching streamers play during the beta, and that is good enough for me for now.
---
Also, hurry tf up August.
---
Idk how retail av is, but if you have a decent group that understands ¬´RUSH¬ª you can finish the bg in an hours time in 1.12
---
Thanks kind stranger, for providing me with my first silver!
---
"Its not a gay thing...its like porn"
---
You might be able to email Blizzard and ask. If I remember correctly in Vanilla you could select your area and then server from there. I distinctly remember Oceanic servers coming up for me as a US player.

Unless you are warrior or rogue. Buying a good upgrade for not orbitant amounts of gold will repay itself by making fighting more time efficient.
---
Now THAT‚ÄôS a post I‚Äôve seen a bunch of times.
---
&gt; Most players usually have their 90g around lvl 37-38.
---
I refuse to believe most players do have that.
---
The knockback isn‚Äôt from regular snowballs, it‚Äôs from the hardpacked snowballs only found in AV.
---
2 good healers, and then Mages and Fury warriors. Pretty much everyone else is dead weight. Really though it doesn‚Äôt matter that much if the run takes 40mins or 90 mins, there‚Äôs no prizes for being fast.
---
Yeah I think you're right. I want to return to streaming and creating content when I get access to classic (beta or release) so I know for sure I would have gone hard if I had beta. Blizzard saving us from ourselves lol.
---
They cc you for 30 secs? With what cc? Poly is the only one and that means you get full health.
---
I eliminated caffeine from my diet last month so when classic launches I'll be able to push my 38 year old ass to grind past the pack at launch without resorting to hard drugs.
---
U have nothing on northcoarlina
---
HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
It did. Compare how Half Life 2 looks and how WoW looks. They both came out in the same year.
---
Nah. I wish. That'd be a great superpower. Though technically, no keyboard. It's just super quick and easy to type some shit out on my phone, and if a conversation starts, then it oughta continue til its natural end.
---
Nah, it's cool. The female was his smoking hot 28 year old math teacher.
---
Just thaw them and eat them at room temperature. 
---
Press frostbolt button, stick luke warm hotpocket in mouth, press frostbolt button again, shove hotpocket the rest of the way in.  Chew. Swallow.
---
Aha, thanks for the informative response! Now that I connect the dots, I assume it‚Äôs the same as the drug Waran where I live.
---
Yes it should discourage people from playing druids, that‚Äôs the point. If you don‚Äôt care about topping dps then sweet. A lot of people do. A lot of people rolled shaman/paladin/Druid in 2005 and realised after 200 hours of levelling they would be forced to heal and quit the game or rerolled. The less people get that shock again the better.
---
The queue system is weird. Even when WSG was out I saw multiple Horde and Alliance premades fully formed and waiting in queue for ages (from hopping around streams) without a pop to anyone.
---
I thought it was a very low limit to how many BG instances could be running at a time, but then AB launched and the same thing happened without anyone getting into the BG. It took like 30 minutes for Asmon's premade to get matched with a bunch of randoms and 5 capped, meanwhile there were Horde raids who gave up before they even got a queue to pop.
---
What a great TV show.
---
I just want classic to release 2 months early. I know that isn‚Äôt happening but i do.
---
Played on EU before that. Don't know why
---
110%
---
I like that font. Anyone know name?
---
There's a lot of potential there. Like maybe Butters is being picked on for playing lame new games like Anthem (or anything really), while everyone else is playing re-releases and remasters of games they already bought years ago.
---
&gt; For this reason I still secretly think of Splintertree Post as SplintertP.
---
It's fascinating to me that you were the only person in the world who knew that little detail of your memory, up until now when you shared it with us. And now some of us will probably remember it that way.
---
I'm super high btw
---
No it didnt
---
You keep refering to the EULA like it's some eternal never changing document bestowed on blizzard by the almighty gaming powers and that it never changes.
---
If you find new ways of being a twat, blizzard will add it and you will be banned for it.
---
Plus blizzard doesn't have to have a reason to ban you, your acting like you have some kind of legal right to play their game. You don't. They will ban you, with or without breaking the EULA - the only issue will be wether ot not the retarded cronies you get to follow your rules will receive the same punishment.
---
Personally I hope they do, but most likely they won't.
---
I willing to bet this all fades out to nothing - most of what you are talking about is not possible with the current API like sharing information across faction, not in real time anyway. Add-ons can only read/write from/to saved variables and manipulation of those by an external program is prohibited. Add-ons cannot access anything outside of the game or its own saved information - if they could there would be no need to update an add-on ever.
---
seen this a few times, whats wrong with mematic? is it just cause of the watermark?
---
Not really of a fan of FOV tbh. I had 3 screens before and didn't like it. I browse the web way to much etc
---
No I mean the name, how does that fit?
---
Painful lvling as druid...  huh? Go solo lvl a warrior
---
 Druids cake lvling....
---
You're a busy man, maybe raiding outside of pugs isn't for you.
---
Light be with you mate
---
&gt; Sometimes, it isn't the streamer - its the Twitch community.
---
this in not a one directional dynamic. Certain streamer personalities attract certain viewer personalities, which further encourage certain behaviour, attracting more of these viewers, etc.   
---
These obnoxious streamers dont just happen. Neither do these communities. They are build around each other. Most people that watch asmon wouldnt watch preach because he is boring to them.
---
Also, if you cut caffeine out of your diet in the months leading up to release, you'll be able to grind like you're 20 years old again at launch. 
---
Also: Don't get your caffeine from coffee come launch.  Coffee induced bathroom trips are only desirable when your boss is paying for it.
---
Ok salty nerd leave with your 200 karma account then
---
probably just depends on the game i guess, i still use 3 to have different resources up (pages on right, chat on left)
---
Yes, but use uBlock Origin and not just uBlock. Change to Chrome should happen in autumn (not aware of an exact date yet).
---
Stealth on mounts? How do they do that?
---
hey man if u get beta access u can feel free to lend me ur info ;)
---
Hahah, I was just dissecting  the picture:
---
Pala stuff only started dropping for horde just before tbc came out
---
Some of the people far outgear the MC content so this was an alt/catch up raid
---
OP is dead on trash presumably he‚Äôs not alone
---
Then I read the chat and had to giggle out loud 
---
But yes I‚Äôm easily humored at times :D
---
If you don't mind could you share some specs? I am looking for a resto hybrid pvp spec!
---
I make this look good
---
&gt;Is there anything you can do to specialize in skirmishes?
---
For sure, I try to prowl as much as possible.  Lots of players will easily get sucked into a fight they think they can win.  Coming out of stealth and healing, rooting etc is really strong.  You can open with pounce and go straight into healing your ally with Regrowth, while your ally is still beating their face in. As a nelf and with 2/3 Natural Shapshifter I am always off the map.  I get 2/2 Feline Swiftness because positioning is everything and you don't want to lag behind the group.  I highly suggest PvP set for movement bonus as well, then fill in with T2 or whatever you got.
---
Feral Charge is THE skirmish skill.  Locking a caster out of casting for 4 sec + attempt is going to be more than anything you could have healed during that time.  Peeling a Warrior off instantly with the root is better than NS+HT on a mortal strike target etc.  It's just a god tier ability.  With practice you'll learn how to make plays without charging in and suiciding.
---
4/4 Imp Nature's Grasp is a must.  A lot of people feel "it'll proc eventually" is good enough and this is a personal preference pick up, it's not for resto. If you're being attacked by melee then you can't heal others.  It's got 75% uptimes, just keep it on if you're really bad at predicting fights.  You could spend a lot of time sitting in bear form if you don't have this.  You also can choose who to root if 2v1 melee.
---
Once you start getting T2, you're really going to have an easy time.  You don't have cloth armor penalties anymore, your mana pool is going to be nearly 7k, and now you're enabled to heal, shift prowl/charge as much as you like.  At this point you can start giving your innervates away regularly.
---
Just don't expect to run premades in this role. Although, I find that Druids are one of the better peelers for FC as well.
---
As a Tauren I‚Äôve always been jealous of people who don‚Äôt have to dismount manually when entering buildings.
---
Use a lower power setting.
---
Of the year? Your are kind to him.
---
I would advise any player that plans to roll a Druid for **raid** tanking in Classic : DON'T DO IT.
---
For everything else, go ahead, you will have a blast.
---
150/150 Tailoring, that's pretty good
---
At end of vanilla decursive didn‚Äôt work the way it works on private servers. Blizzard has more or less implied that decursive and addons like healbot will not work in classic.
---
I can see your point, but personally I'd want to test things out, level more classes. Nothing hardcore, just trying out stuff. I plan on going completely hardcore when Classic releases, but why would I do that in beta?
---
So yeah, I wouldn't mind getting into beta. I actually started playing on pserver for the first time in years just to get used to vanilla gameplay, but not rushing anything. Just figuring out levelling routes and trying different classes. As someone who wasn't decided what class to start with on Classic release, it actually helps a lot.

Bit late to comment on this post. Ive been running my own route for Tauren druid on the Classic Beta for a while now. I've pushed level 1-10 under 1 hour and 45 minutes. Bear form is doable within 2 hours and 15 minutes and level 12 should be doable within 3 hours. With skinning at level 6 (straight as you reach bloodhoof) you should also have no problem with gold for your skills. 
---
I've made several videos on youtube documenting my leveling route. Mainly for personal notes, but a few friends of mine have seen them as well. Drop me a DM if you'd like a link!
---
AV was patched frequently since the conception of alpha. It seemed like during vanilla every month was a new patch. Check out the GY troll they had at mid in the beginning which was moved around and eventually removed

If you feel suicidal and want an entire raid to hate you, please use MCPs in raids...with bosses having 14% parry-haste...go ahead, DO IT !

cyrodiil is one huge zone. level 10's and max levels play in the same field.
---
Lucky for you, the person whose comment you originally replied quoted Blizzard‚Äôs official stance
---
Never said they did. Commented on how gear distribution doesnt matter during speed runs. One of the more recent world record Naxx runs has like 12 or 13 warriors I think. So yes, your correct, they dont bring 20 warriors.
---
Pretty sure AV's hard-packed snowballs were nerfed during vanilla. Although I have no source.
---
I'm almost this exactly, just not sure which one I'm going to main yet. Troll definitely male, undead I'm not sure though
---
serious question: who or what is a jebatin? what does it mean to pogger the chat?
---
No I agree. You absolutely have no idea what you're talking about. If classic was ported to stadia, stadia would only be running the client and streaming that to a screen (pc, tablet, tv whatever). The game and it's engine would still be on Blizzards servers.
---
I do plan on enjoying the game though.
---
I'll be doing a lot of profession work and dungeons. Hoping to find some like minded singles in my area too.
---
All these talk about people not wanting to roll on streamer servers, I hope I will luck out on a server with 0 private server players. Half the shit they talk about won't work in classic.
---
&gt;  back in the day people didn't realize 
---
Yes people were mentally challenged back in 2006 and nobody noticed fury warrior is better than rouge for your raid comp. That's why every guild on the planet favored rouges. They just didn't realize. All the neckbearding and theorycrafting couldn't compete with 2017 Pserver autits' brilliance and insight.
---
I used to join in on these "joke about how much worse it could get" posts in 2005-2012 but Blizzard took many of the jokes seriously and implemented them so now I just type this.
---
Hi, /u/finetemporum
---
For casual (non healer) raiding and pvp, mage is the way to go. Ele shaman are great and also lack the gear dependency in pvp, but you'll be healing in raids.
---
I expect more kids, min-maxers, trolls, long queues, server transfer, more chinese farmers, more people buying gold, economy problems on the AH, 
---
There was toxic servers in 2006. You want to avoid servers with the top guilds, full servers, dead servers, servers with bad faction balance. 
---
Choosing a good server is more important than class or faction. It will be the determining factor to your experience in classic. I suggest trying to find a server with a local community. I live in Montreal and guilds are starting to talk about where they will go.
---
It's calibre, as in maximum calibre
---
Not really wall hacking. It's like 2 jumps
---
Any suggestions on what to level for warrior (I'll be rolling an orc probably). I was thinking a combination of skinning, alchemy and mining, just gathering since the gold will be very useful for repairs, better gear etc.
---
Yes you can, lol. You can absolutely be a casual raider in Classic, but all guilds are different. Just find a guild that fits with your schedule and have fun.
---
&gt; It indicates to me that maybe private servers either got something wrong
---
Private servers got most of the things wrong since every mob/encounter/etc is based on assumptions and guesses rather than copying actual vanilla data.
---
Pserver players meeting reality will be good fun.
---
Shhh
---
Respawn time on quest giver was changed to 10 minutes during vanilla. The private server you have your experience from is not Blizz like for the patch they are playing.
---
There are. But no one would dare to speak such thing out loud in an office environment. Hey, maybe OP is your coworker. Who knows?
---
Everyone is putting Dwarf Priest as the end all be all, but I think it's kind of lame to not point out that the "Dwarf" part of Dwarf Priest is mainly used to counter what, 1 boss? If anything Priest in general is what should be mentioned. To my understanding even Shadow Priests can get spots due to the shadow damage buff for warlocks. 
---
It's probably the only class where at least one of every talent tree is wanted all at once.
---

People asking questions that deep down they know they have control over and that they can only see what their options are after they join a server and see what guilds are available, or if no Guild is available to accommodate them perhaps they decide to make a server. All out of Internet hugs here.

Just thought I would point out another similar usability issue:
---
This first search for "levelling 2h" weapons is fine. You can sort by DPS and you can see all the SPEEDs of the weapons at a quick glance. It's excellent and presents all the info you need.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/side:1/class:1/quality:2:3/type:6:10:1:5:8#items:0+6+17
---
But then when I want to remove all the BoE items (since I probably can't afford them off the AH for my first character) the search suddenly becomes A LOT less user friendly because both the DPS and the SPEED column disappears. Now I can't sort by DPS, and I have to mouseover each weapon to see their SPEED.

[Day 1 WoW druid, 5k+ hours played in Vanilla and TBC, former #1 BG rated Gladiator here in TBC for 2s/3s/5s here.](https://imgur.com/5DlRzJz)
---
Druids heal - but aren't healers. If you don't enjoy healing, roll another hybrid for Vanilla or TBC. Sure, you can tank or boomkin without hurting your raid, but you won't be optimal and you'll always feel like youre an offbrand tank or dps.
---
Mobility is what separates Druids from other classes, we can move and position ourselves while healing like no one else can. Rejuv, Swiftmend, Nature's Swiftness, the hot of regrowth, all can be done while moving. In PVE, you won't lose healing while moving for mechanics. In PVP, you'll never be chased down and killed first, or sheeped, etc.
---
Worried about raid spots? A good resto druid is always needed, don't worry, not enough people play druid in general to be fighting for spots, especially if you're resto.
---
In PvP, druids are the absolute best healer - Impossible to contain or shutdown while healing on the run.
---
Resto druids are dominant. There far more complex than other classes, and are Proactive rather than reactive. Druids must master their own class, their forms (do I bear form now with the rogue on me to wait it out while my ally comes, or do I travel spam to run away, do I NS-doot him to walk away, or NS+HT and cat form to finish him while my hots keep me up), as well as mastering every other class to know which of your options is best. Hots and Druid abilities also require forethought (Abolish myself when I expect a rogue to blind me, etc) - rather than a pally bubble when shit goes down.
---
Druids are not healers, Dps, or tanks. Other classes have roles - Priests heal, wars tank, rogues dps (yes, shadow is dps, fury dps, etc, but they have a role in the Trinity). Saying "I want to tank" and rolling bear druid will make you a mediocre (but usable) tank that would be better off as a prot warrior.
---
Druids fall outside every other class in Vanilla. The druid's role is mobility. If that doesn't appeal to you, play another hybrid.
---
Druids are bad pvp healers because  
---
* Low throughput with efficient heals (HT/rejuv)
---
* Low efficiency with big heals (regrowth)
---
* Vulnerable to offensive dispels - shamans/priests will strip all your hots and innervate
---
* No magic dispel, defensive or offensive
---
* Only good defense is to run away or turtle in bear form which makes you unable to support
---
* CC is only good against 2-3 classes, only usable outside, easily dispelled
---
* Poor offensive capabilities - charge is ok but bash is very unreliable. Both put you in a bad position, burn mana and prevent you from healing
---
As did I friend. It was my favorite zone.
---
I've done skinning on one of them, and it's a nice extra chunk of silver for abilities and repairs and such, you can get by with buying the white weapons, plus that devilsaur leather for two of your pre-MC best in slot need that leather I believe
---
I would like to be in the Beta so that I can roll different classes that I won't ever get to on actual launch. That way I might find a class that I actually enjoy that I didn't know I would have, and I learn more how each class operates. I played Vanilla as a teenager, and was a total noob so I don't really know each class as well as I would like.
---
Pretty sure current Blizzard will change them or make it actionable.
---
This is true. People that didnt play vanilla doesnt understand how long time it took to get gear. And most raiders had to catch up, everyone didnt buy WoW on the release date and it wasnt many that started to raid asap and got full BiS before bwl was released and so on.
---
it was a funny gank. relax
---
Stop making me interested in another class, I‚Äôve already decided to play a Priest... or a Warlock. And my best friend is most likely going to play a Druid anyhow.
---
This is the item they are referring to. Its the best weapon for feral dps. You'll need to carry a bunch with you to raid if you want to compete. [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler)
---
I'm not completely sure you need to get hit cap for PVP. 1% Crit is better than 1% less miss. You want that burst dmg. Hit is good for enemies higher level than you and sustain dmg.
---
These were great for kicking AFK folks out of the battleground entrance.
---
1.1 ish.  DPS needed as much as they could get.  The healers would OOM otherwise.     It took forever to kill things.  1.12?  probably not.
---
I think the joke is that they removed first aid in retail
---
Feel like I'll be starting out with mining and skinning, then. Thanks for your input!
---
Funny tigole bitties suppose to mean bigole titties
---
Sorry friend, you don't get to choose who is and isn't welcome.

I found it a bit funny, but when I read your comment I cracked up. I feel ya.
---
Dwarf is really good.
---
Burnout is 100% mental. There are people who are going hard in beta, and besides the ones sacrificing sleep for the leveling races, a lot of people won't be impacted by it at all. Just another day in the office for some.
---
It was AV only and then changed to the opposite faction only too.
---
You don‚Äôt need to buy a game to play WoW, just a sub.

Oh - I did not know that!! I guess it makes some kind of sense then

For some of these guys they will be on servers filled with thousands of fanboys.

Looks like I wasn't the only one that appreciated that spot! lol.

does this guy have some sort of a syndrome or wth is wrong with him? couldnt watch more than 20 seconds, sorry :P
---
So what are you gonna do when blizzard messages you asking you to shut it down? ignore it then get banned? Then eventually everyone else using the addon gets banned? lol, I don't think you understand how much power blizzard has to do this, they already said they're going to ban certain types of addons like group finder too
---
if they dont buy overprices crap from the AH they will. AH is a noob trap, glimmering greens for 5g each which will last them 3 levels. seems like a good deal?
---
Posting a bitter response that doesn't even address what I'm calling you out for in an attempt to distract everyone from your whining makes you triggered. This wasn't meant to be a cute or creative joke. People who do nothing but cry about streamers are an embarrassment to the WoW community.
---
If you don't like streamers, don't watch them. Your bitching and moaning won't make them go away.
---
Fuck me that's great I was missing this
---
You can heal dungeons with hybrid ele/resto spec which is bis for pvp too, even raids it just depends if your guild is going to be ok with that or not.

Assassin rogue of course, everyone had an assassin rogue twink back then.
---
My very very first faction was alliance when I was 14 and only got to 30. When I really started in tbc it was horde and I never looked back. Until recently when I switched for a friend who is never on at the same time. Do I regret this? Yes.

Food is 2% HPS for 25 seconds, the only % based food in the game I know of other than the seasonal ones at Harvest Festival and Winter Veil. Best item on this whole list for anyone who isn't a mage.

https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=4444 - Black Husk Shield - Not shown here but it only has 5 charges. Still possibly useful.
---
Here is a collection of off-hands that restore health and mana not already on your list. Most of them are not very useful but since you included the Furlbog Medicine Pouch and Celestial Orb trinket I'll let you decide whether to include them.

---
Belt:
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=4264 - Barbaric Belt - Gives 30 Rage, no energy given in vanilla. I don't believe it shares a CD with the warrior level 20 class chestpiece.

I think you'd have a better time as enhance than ele PvP, however with the ele/resto hybrid build you could do both with one spec. Neither Ele or Enhance are great in dungeons, I'd say it'd be a coin flip. Maybe edge to enhance. Still, ele/resto hybrid spec is probably going to be what you should go for
---
Love when he runs off and kill ppl.
---
Well it sure requires something, because there are a whole heap of players who are absolutely awful.
---
Saving this for later
---
I rolled horde, originally. Quit shortly after the cata release. I think I will re-roll horde, though. I just enjoy that side way too much not to.
---
3.6 DPS. Not great, not terrible.
---
If they went into druid tanking thinking it‚Äôll be like retail then you have a point. But most people asking about it mention that they read taladril‚Äôs guide, which does point all of this out.
---
Our druid tank transitioned to tanking from healing with some MC and ZG gear but mostly dungeon stuff. He didn‚Äôt have crowd pummelers, or put immense amounts of time and effort into this. At least not more than other classes that might gear up for their roles.
---
In fact, most gearing up isn‚Äôt straightforward in vanilla if you are actually trying to play your role well. Dungeon sets are essentially a meme and tier 1 is only good for some classes. Anyone who goes into vanilla thinking their item progression will be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is mistaken. This is not an argument that should dissuade from playing tank  druid if they want to. 
---
Also, as someone pointed out, druid threat is also good without the crowd pummeler because it scales very well with the gear you are wearing while sunder armor for example doesn‚Äôt scale at all. 
---
Lastly, farming pummelers sounds daunting but it‚Äôs not nearly that bad. Especially as alliance druid you can go do it instead of waiting around in IF. You basically sneak to the boss, kill him, then reset. There‚Äôs a video by skarmtank where he does it as footage for the Q&amp;A.

Doesn‚Äôt 2h fury do more damage against bosses? Arms isn‚Äôt total trash for pve but it‚Äôs no fury
---
Everyone is so quick to call bullshit without knowing facts. Devestate came in at the end of vanilla, xp bar persisted at level cap. People are idiots Leslie. Love that shield. I think ubrs and had fire resist if I remember correctly
---
In Russia corpse fucks you
---
Where else can you pvp in pvp servers? Do they access to battlegrounds?
---
It comes down where to put the last point right? Either resto or Ele
---
Sure, but it at least used to be the case that WoW EU and US were two different purchases (gametime cards also didn't work across regions).
---
hot staff of jordan
---
I rolled horde shaman then I ninja looted earthfury legs. And rerolled alliance paladin ended up being in one of the top world guilds! This time around going human warrior because alliance where just overall easier and closer to most content. Plus paladins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shamans
---
I wanted to play enc in pvp. But many told me it sucks.  
---
I wouldve to grind 2 sets of gear  
---
Windfury is very rng  
---
No gapcloser
---
I rolled Horde orginally (though in mid-TBC not Vanilla) and I played Horde through Legion. I'll be rolling Alliance for Classic because I would like to experience the other factions Vanilla levelling areas which I never did.
---
I will create an Orc Warrior, my first char, and sit on the bank in Org.
---
Correct, but you don‚Äôt need to buy the game anymore, just a sub.
---
Here in Northern Europe we have something called "Hold it" which is essentially a hot pocket.
---
Mages? MAYBE. Paladins/shamans? No chance in hell. There might be a lot of retnubs initially, but they'll die down as soon as they realize that guilds have no use for their underwhelming asses.
---
Buddy, play what you like. Arms and Fury Warriors are fun to play, and if you feel like tanking give it a whirl. It seems daunting, but it's not that difficult. Plus, stance dance is best dance.
---
ones that add quality of life features and integrate emotes from third parties.
---
Just sick of hearing about them all around. Positive or negative. Classic couldn't come out soon enough so I can just not see anything about them altogether.
---
That's good to hear then. Is the option in-game (realm select?), or somewhere in the launcher?
---
I'm too chicken to not have Will of the Forsaken.
---
Where in the hell do I download those? This is news to me lol
---
Blizzard can't ban addons, they can only change the API.
---
Blizzard doesn't ban anyone for using an addon.
---
They also didn't say that. They said they may be looking at ways to restrict the API to limit the influence of certain types of social addons.
---
I know! Otherguy was such a fantastic player. The sorrow hill movies makes me remember why I chose to be one of those just average undead Mage pvpers in the first place
---
First tier wasn‚Äôt that great. A lot of the fights in BWD were either so trivial (the sound boss) or just annoying (nefarion with the lava and the little platforms was really annoying).
---
It's a horde only quest in Hinterlands
---
Dude. You don't wanna Miss that. Please God do yourself a favor and make a horde alt on a diff server for the 2020 elections. Barrens chat is gonna be lit fam. Lit.
---
fucking saved
---
You've got earthbind/frost shock to close the gap. The windfury rng can be hilarious. Grinding 2 sets isn't even the tough part, it's the 50g respec fee that'll get ya
---
Nothing like 0 grams of fiber to make sure you have nice quick shits.
---
I honestly am not sure yet. 
---
Skinning is a must, imho. Not only does the money you get from skinning let you buy gear (useful), but also cooking mats and bags (very very useful), it's just the easiest profession to run on a fresh server. Well worth it. 
---
Cooking, imho, is almost mandatory. Food buffs really matter for warrriors, because when your health is a resource, your max health is your margin of safety. And don't just cook what you find in the world. At levels 15, 25, 35, actually go to the auction house, buy 20 of the relevant level of food to cook, and then start with a stack of on level buff food. At ~5 levels after you start using the buff, you can then start farming the mats to add to your stack, and keep it topped up until you are 10 levels past when you first started using it and could replace it.
---
Fishing is a bit odd. If you intend to fish ever, and you are not going for a server first, you should fish at the start of the game. this is because fishing food is not even vendor trash, but you can fish level 15 food at level 5, whereas you absolutely cannot hunt level 15 food at level 15 (it drops on level 20+ mobs). 
---
but if you don't intend to fish, just start with skinning, sell the skinning mats, buy cooking mats, and then sell your excess cooking mats in turn. cooking mats is what the auction house is FOR. 
---
In terms of the second profession..... I would not, on my main, want to try buying everything I need to level a crafting profession.
---
So really, the choices are mining,herbalism,leatherworking,enchanting, and tailoring.
---
I think I can rule out tailoring right away. It lets you upcycle cloth, but you are making bandages with yours anyways as a warrior. No here, just buy bags on the auction house.
---
Enchanting, similarly.... I am looking to invest money early on on buff foods and elixers, nice gear, and my mount and my tanking and dps skills. I am not looking to invest money into a later game skill early on. Though I am not an expert on enchanting and this may be wrong. 
---
I feel like if you go mining, you are intending to eventually switch to either blacksmithing, engineering, or both. I am nervous about keeping it leveled on a new server. If you end up having to run around durotar fighting over copper nodes, it may not be worth it on a crowded launch environment. 
---
If you go herbalism, it lets you go alchemy on your bank alt, which makes a lot of sense to me. There is less need to actually BE the alchemist as a warrior, just to have the products of alchemy. This is a strong contender for me. Also, I prefer as a warrior to fight outside. not only does it give me cooking mats and mobs to skin, but the room to kite or leash mobs is very important to me, which is a problem in a lot of mining node locations, which tend to be in enclosed spaces.
---
And last, is leatherworking. Oddly enough, I think there might be a lot of money in just processing your skinnned leather and then vendoring it. This is a profession with absolutely no utility. You can build armor kits, but unlike clothies, these are almost worthless to you as you already have amazing armor and armor does not scale linearly. 
---
The key is that I think there might be real money in upcycling a lot of leather goods. 
---
for example, light leather pants: 3.5s in vendor price mats (less with reputation), and you make a 5c99s item to sell.
---
It might be practical just to skin leather, and instead of vendoring it, upcycle it using leatherworking into more valuable vendor trash.
---
But that's my take. I am quite certain I will fish,cook,first aid, and skin at launch. but I really don't know if I will go herbalism and ship mats to a bank alt alchemist, or if I will go for leatherworking and go all out on skinning to vendor.
---
Resto for NS is bis imo.
---
Neckbeards don't cook.
---
clip aint working anyone got a mirror?
---
Is that ashbringer on his back?! :-) awesome dude!
---
I can't remember does classic require tags on each mob? Or does party get xp regardless?
---
Farming as a cloth and as soon as you go oom,getting killed by a rogue...
---
Does it still bug out frequently
---
Call customer support or a support ticket on their website. I‚Äôve only ever heard stories of others trying to recover a stolen or locked account and it can be a long a grueling process.
---
You may be better off just starting over on a fresh account.

---
the thing is, its not the slowness that bothers me that much, final fantasy is an even slonger game, but you can actually cast spells. in vanilla, at least in endgame, a class only use one or two spells, its so extremely unbalanced, and i personally dont udnerstand why people dont want this to change. if you do a balance change in retail, the whole fundemental gameplay dont change
---
Could you do priest t2? Great work btw
---
My very first char was a nightelf hunter. I actually wanted to roll a orc warrior now because orc became my fav race over the years, but it seems like my guild will start alliance, so I guess human it is.
---
Because the Q system prioritizes who ever queued up first. So if a couple solo Qs are waiting, it'll wait until they get filled up before it lets in a full premade. With such a small pop it's an issue but with full crossrealm BG it won't be so bad.

My father was a gnome, my mother was a tauren. Talks of original factions are always tough for me. I am neither from here, nor there. I will be fighting for the Alliance since myself and 30 people in this facebook group chat have decided on it. That's my story.
---
Layering can last up to 3 month in phase 1. That say nothing what so ever about the length of phase 1...
---
Not gonna lie I am going to miss ironforge.
---
But I'm going horde this time
---
Actually, if you're below 20% health, it's almost a guarantee a rogue is sneaking up on you
---
The usual Ele PvP spec is 30/0/21, which can heal or DPS in all dungeons just fine (just swap gear) and it‚Äôs also a decent healer in lower tier raids (MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20) with some consumables, especially if your guild already has them on farm.
---
For progress raids and AQ40/Naxx you are better off going deep Resto, but you could easily amass a lot of gold by that time for respecs.
---
I haven‚Äôt played Enhancement at lvl 60 so I have no firsthand experience about their efficiency, but Ele is easier to gear if you raid because nobody else needs caster mail.
---
Enhancement might be better for farming due to less downtime, but again, I‚Äôve only played Ele which is not so bad either, especially with some gear. However it‚Äôs nowhere near the efficiency of Hunters, Mages or Warlocks when it comes to grinding so getting Mining or Herbalism to lvl 60 or teaming up with a Warrior would be your best choice for farming gold imo. 
---
If you get the hang of raiding as a Shaman, you wouldn‚Äôt really want to play a DPS in PvE anymore. At least that‚Äôs what happened to me when I‚Äôve leveled a Warlock to 60 after playing a Shaman on a pserver a few years ago, leveling was way quicker, making gold was easy, but the 1-button rotation killed it for me after one or two ZG pug runs.
---
Im really liking that show.
---
i would have /roared
---
This is exactly it. Everyone needs to forget about what‚Äôs best  and just play the class that seems the most fun to them. It‚Äôs the beaut of Vanilla.
---
the are called better twitch tv (bttv) frankerface Z (FFZ) and frankerface z addon pack (FFZ:AP) 
---
Make sure to enable animated emotes in the FFZAP settings.
---
Enhancer is preferred in dungeons due to improved weapon totems and Nightfall weapon, but in general I'd rather have a real dps than a shaman in my party
---
And my Ass!
---
The "tards" in classic won't be hunters this time around. I think it will end up being one of lock/mage/rogue
---
Only horde can be shaman and I want to play shaman again, so...
---
Because that isn't where you would typically find an orc in game
---
Of course, I never implied that it will do more than a pure dps class. My question was if it is true that feral is really subpar in classic even considering that for a hybrid and heck even to be average to below average you need to put a lot of effort.

---
It‚Äôs no longer 2006 and most people have learned to kite the Enhancement Shamans around, also good luck getting decent gear over Warriors/Hunters.
---
Ele is perfectly viable in Dungeons, as Mana efficiency and high resistances are the main issues of the class in raids, and neither of those really matter in 5-mans/UBRS. You can also switch to a healer role by just changing your gear.
---
It bothers me greatly that trolls can't be warlocks in classic. Their Regen and Berserking racials synergize so well with warlock üò¢
---
Absolutely. I think they are the class that scales the most with player skill.
---
Probably the reason for the bad rep.
---
Yep! This is the weapon I was referring too, sorry I was on mobile and didn't have the videos at hand.

I got banned from the r/wow for calling Assmangold a ‚Äúginger turd bucket.‚Äù One of my most treasured memories of retail WoW is when I got to /spit &amp; /rude at him in game.

30/0/21 is the tried and true Ele/Resto pvp build. 0/5/46 is the usual Resto raiding one.
---
Some kind of issue with layering where it is currently bugged in the beta I think. It's more akin to phasing than layering because of it.
---
I played Horde 99% of the time in 2004/2005. I kept trying Alliance but I just couldn't. In 2019 I'll be playing Alliance in Classic.
---
I've been playing on a private server and I enjoy the perspective of playing Alliance right now though. I only choose Alliance because my friends want to play Alliance, but it's been refreshing.
---
I love Orgrimmar, but I am looking forward to finally falling Ironforge my new home. I always found it to be a better Capitol City despite playing Horde for so long.
---
this sub makes me think none of you actually played vanilla
---
Thats mostly true. However from my experience most guilds with that approach are carried by a small number of players that eventually will leave for better guilds. Which makes your guild stuck forever and eventually stop raiding.   
---
Finding a guild that takes in barely playable specs, jas longetivity and gets anything remotely interesting down is incredibly rare.
---
You can only 'learn to kite' so much with frost shocks CD as low as it is. I never mained enhance but I would imagine the gear being competed on by warriors and enhance is very minimal. As I said though, I do agree the ele/resto spec is the way to go.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBOYeeimqHg
---
i love Zalgradis' videos. too bad the talent rework made his spec not-possible anymore.
---
While attempting to find my old 19 rogue video I made years ago, had no luck. But I did find a huge directory of old screenshots. There may be a few screenshots in there from mid-TBC but these are mostly Vanilla.
---
The most fun I've ever had in this game was on that character. He had over 10k HKs (is that a lot? I have no clue).
---
I stream now, and I seriously can't wait for Classic to release so I can stream that. My twitch is "fracklife" for anybody curious/wanting to show love.

**&lt;Circle of Dominus&gt; | US PVP | Alliance**  
---
Well Met Adventurers of Azeroth!
---
We welcome any adventurer looking for a **Semi-Casual** PvE/PvP Guild where you can meet new people for the ultimate Classic WoW experience. We believe in a **non-rushed**, friendly leveling experience where both veterans and new players can thrive. We do plan to create a progressive raid group, a PvP team, and a social environment where everyone can enjoy the game in many different ways. This isn't an exclusive group, but rather a fresh new guild open to any background. 
---
**Raiding**: After reaching level 60 and creating the core raid group, we are looking to spend two nights a week from 9-12 CST raiding, exact days will be ironed out once the group is formed. We will use a Loot Council for distribution of gear. We are not a hardcore group and will not require you to grind out 24/7 or have the best gear ASAP, but we still want members to do what's necessary in order to complete the raids. We welcome those who never raided with open arms. We will teach you how to properly extinguish Ragnaros, Slay Onixia, Storm Naxrammas, and many more!
---
**PVP**: #1 priority is to show the Horde that the Alliance is the best when it comes to PVP combat! We are looking to form groups for Phase 3 &amp; 4 for the ultimate PVP experience. We again welcome players who never done PVP combat and will teach them how to dispose of the Horde.
---
**Social:** The sense of community is what makes Classic WoW a Classic. We are inclusive to all types of players, from the hardcore Grand Marshalls and Kel'Thuzad slayers to the curious new folks first learning about the world of Azeroth or casually playing the game. We have a discord server where players are encourage to hangout and chat together during their journey, and have direct contact to the GM and Officers 24/7 for any questions. We are not here to belittle those who don't have the grasp of the game, but rather encourage a positive learning experience and a fun overall adventure!
---
**LF Officers:** If you have a good background in private servers/vanilla Raiding and PVP and want a chance to lead/become a social icon, we are currently in search for our future Guild officers! PM me on Reddit or Discord if you're interested.
---
Hope to see you there!

40 isn't bad. If you save cash along the way, you're fine. It's the 60 mount that takes more effort. It's cake for Warlock and Pally at 40 and fine at 60 with some time and a group.
---
What's your vector, Victor?
---
Lets make sure this doesn't become /r/wow 2.0 with just as much shitty art
---
Only a neckbeard considers throwing things into an air fryer cooking... so maybe you're right.
---
But do you really expect to eat soggy tendies?
---
1 and 10 only
---
Started as an Ally NE Warrior. TBC had me roll a BE Paladin and Horde has been my home ever since.
---
Horde just felt like home for some reason.
---
Def very slow to get to the point.
---
Improved Weapon Totems won‚Äôt compensate for the lack of Enh DPS and it‚Äôs pretty much the least efficient class for Nightfall duty.
---
Let's be real, the reason Asmon has a key is not to bug-report... Come on dude.
---
Unless you inconvenience your raid members to do so.

---
/slow clap
---
I tested the waters in TBC but I felt the same as you. Flying mounts seemed broken from day one and what?! Paladins for the horde now? I hate it
---
Wow you are a hero. I thought the spastics were just premium subs who could use/see emotes that I couldn‚Äôt. Thanks haha.
---
Is this /r/wow all over again?
---
Troll priest. Instructions unclear; went straight for the voodoo.
---
Fuck shoes. My bovine brethren know what's up.
---
Never said they made the rogue lose all cp. Afaik right now in the beta and in vanilla they didn‚Äôt.
---
Agreed. I was kinda going off the top of my head. I'll try to be more concise next time.
---
There's going to be a lot of new players that don't understand how important First Aid and Cooking is in Vanilla. Fishing as well.
---
boned
---
Bro, I'm just gonna fanboy out for a second.
---
I copied everything you did in BC. I followed you on (arenajunkies?) In season 3 and 4. Looking at everything I could of yours to get my rating up. Managed to get 2300 in 2s copying you
---
Gnome rogue master race...sneaky fuckers
---
It's not monitoring their stream at all. It's if you both appear in game at the same time. I did a little searching and it seems [like this is already a thing](https://www.wowace.com/projects/vanaskos) and probably could be used in the same manner.  I remember using something like it back in the day.
---
Most of that was in TBC and Wrath tho.
---
I'm in the beta and this is how it is for me. I still don't even have a lvl 30 yet, but I'm checkin out different classes and factions. Reporting bugs here and there. Honestly, small things like figuring out the best place to find raptors around xroads and stuff like that. Found some quest givers that I'd forgotten about. I only play about 2 hrs a day. 
---
It's giving me clarity on class selection too. At first, I was hyped about warlock. Then switched to mage. Rogue is fun, and warrior is a challenge leveling. Played a druid a bit too and had a blast. All classes are fun in their own ways. Settling on mage main and warrior alt.
---
Very well done.  Kudos
---
I enjoyed Bastion of Twilight though. All three fights were very interesting.
---
You‚Äôll have to change your region on the launcher. After that the generic stuff to ask you to sub will show up in game etc.
---
I think that's  mostly because it was just 1 server worldwide in the LH/Nost case , so it got a lot of attention, but in classic with dozens if not hundreds of servers it will be fine, except maybe that one server where the top streamer is playing
---
... this is a pre-alpha teaser.
---
Questline Horse Only. Alliance have to win the Tournament to get anything better.
---
Maybe I'm missing where trying to perform better negatively affects the rest of your raid. The point of melee weaving for hunters is to boost your dps and kill the boss faster
---
Yes, they removed first-aid with the BFA pre-patch, but also it has been irrelevant for many, many years now. Anyone going from retail to classic, especially as a warrior or rogue, will hopefully remember or learn from another just how strong first-aid was once.
---
Did this too through winterspring. Thought I was so cool.
---
Don‚Äôt go, sell the ticket and buy hot pockets with the proceeds. Seems like an easy choice.
---
Depends on if it's funny
---
There isn't a single addon from private servers that will work on WoW Classic, settings included.
---
How do you plan to train skills? Under city ?
---
I find the ‚Äúmy wife allowed me to play Classic WoW‚Äù or ‚Äúhow do I convince my wife to play Classic WoW with me‚Äù posts more sad/hilarious, especially because those are almost certainly true.
---
No doubt, I'll be playing a rogue so first aid is invaluable. Cooking will be no problem since I'll be grinding beasts to level skinning which will give me meat at the same time.
---
He also has found bugs and said he wont report them because he's not there to test he never agreed to be a tester.
---
The only time I would bother to kill a player lower level than me is if they are in my gathering farming area.
---
Those are my herbs/skins/ore. Don't like it, roll on a PvE.
---
My answer was about ele vs enh. If I had to choose between those two, I'd take the enh. But if I can take a real dps instead of the shaman, I'd do that.
---
Oh, it's 100% the following.  I don't care if \*insert big streamer\* is playing on the same server.. I do care when they have a mob of people following them around doing things that are fun for the stream but aren't good for anyone else.  I'd also hate to be in the situation where I happen to kill said streamer and start getting camped by  a raid group because I ran into them, likely unknowingly.
---
Anyone else tired of ‚ÄúAnyone else tired of...‚Äù posts?
---
&gt; I only spend about 2-3 hours a day actively doing anything at these events.
---
Wtf is the point of going then?
---
Yeah don't worry about avoidance since weapon skill affects that only slightly.
---
Weapon skill is mainly used to reduce glancing blows which is a PvE only thing. Since avoidance, misses and glancing blows are calculated before hits and crits having higher weapon skill can increase your crit cap against Bosses.
---
None of it was in wrath. Wat
---
Thats microwaving 101. Stir or rearrange food halfway through.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there was an app that functioned like a makeshift LFG tool.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that was a placeholder and they simply ran out of time, or it wasn't a priority, to give her a custom model.
---
Why use nightelf? Simple: they're purple. I honestly think that's as far as that line of thinking went, again, under the assumption that it was a placeholder. 
---
I mean, nightelf model aside, look at what she's wearing. That screams placeholder to me. That's just my guess, and I'd love to know what really happened there, but I'd bet anything that she wasn't intended to look like that, but changing it wasn't a priority until she had more of a role in the story down the line.
---
I still use those guides any time I level. Most of the pictures are broken or removed now, but if you can find an archived version of the page it still has the pictures.
---
I started out Alliance, but about halfway through Vanilla I converted and have mostly stuck to Horde since. While Alliance will probably have the top of the top raiders in Classic it also has all the kids and RPers. Things like pug BGs and alt dungeons just sucks as alliance. 
---
I also generally like the world lay-out for Horde more. Alliance has easy access to Blackrock but everything else at end-game is a million miles away, and they have a good few zones that are a pain in the ass to travel to.
---
Whatever. I‚Äôm sticking with diet peach and raspberry Snapple. Tastes like juice and gives you the smooth constant caffeine high when you down two and just supplement 4-6 more with water.
---
I'm tired of you.
---
Are you trying to phish me? That's not very friendly.
---
Or the dungeon finder on the ui
---
&gt;I get that, still wish they hadn't put orcs in Westfall though
---
See that key word "wish", I don't have to defend that lol
---
2 mages
---
1 hunter
---
2 Tanks
---
2 Healers
---
1 Rogue
---
1 Warlock
---
1 Fury warrior
---
You'll have plenty of CC for the humanoid packs. You'll have a hunter for kiting and CC. You'll have additional CC and control for the lock and rogue.
---
But on the real you just need 2 tanks, heals, and a hunter.
---
Which zone? Active in EU.
---
There is a dungeon finder icon...
---
Only hits using weapon. Which is why it's a great hunter weapon.
---
You‚Äôre *
---
Okay. You're probably correct. My information is waaay old.  
---
Patch 2.0 introduced a system for addons called "SecureStateHeader", which blocked any new lua scripts in combat. This was then relaxed a bit in 3.0 with SecureHandlers.
---
I was a Troll Mage in Classic but the thought of a free mount has me tempted to roll Warlock at first. I'm terrible at making money and it would be nice. I also had an Undead Warlock but she was an alt at the time. Maybe I'll remake her...
---
I thought everyone loved a fictional story...
---
No one but myself allows me to do shit I want
---
I don't think this video is even the cause, like, the video itself isn't even an "anti-streamer" video. In fact he actually brings up points as to why being on a streamer server is a good thing. Honestly it's mostly just jealousy. It started when the beta first came out and people were outraged by how they didn't get in but streamers did. This got even worse when Pokimane(who has never played wow in her life) got invited even though it was clearly for advertising. Then on the stress test streamers were able to get in faster than most people and this subreddit started calling it "streamer privilege". I'd also like to point out that like 80% of the people on this subreddit is missing half brain and can't comprehend basic concepts clearly.
---
That priest looks sick
---
People break up because they're not happy together. The 'reason' is pretty much irrelevant, the reality is it's 1,000 reasons built up over years and years. If breaking up makes people more happy then staying together then it is a good thing, regardless of the reason.
---
I'm fine without the invite. I played vanilla closed beta, so I was lucky then. I am very busy nowadays with full-time work and school so I have zero issues of NOT being invited.
---
So in your way of getting more change to get in to the beta you also got more time to play? Seems like a win win to me.

Horde, started in Cata, quit in MoP when SoO was revealed because Garrosh did nothing wrong. 
---
Started playing on ED in 2014, as an Orc Shaman. Played a bit on Nost, LH and Netherwing (TBC) as well. Tried to go Alliance a few times, got sick of it every time despite Dwarves being one of my favourite fantasy races.
---
Going to stick to Horde when Classic hits. PvP as a Dwarf Paladin was tempting, but I just couldn‚Äôt stand killing all those honorable Orcs and peaceful Tauren while fighting side-by-side with treehugging pansy Elves.

That's cause it's a microWAVE. When you have waves coming from two or more sources you get points where they amplify each other and points where they negate each other.
---
That's why food turns inside a microwave. You're also supposed to turn your food halfway through, or ideally stir it. Though obviously you can't stir a hot pocket.
---
Would recommend this on 1.5x speed. Agree with what you're saying man lots of this drama is just getting blown out of proportion these streamers wont have near the pull they think they will.

---
This is the first time I've seen a post about it and yes I'm tired of it.
---
Thank you though.
---
Damn your so cool?
---
It was, in many cases, quicker - one mistake (or bad luck - comes with the territory) could make/break.  I feel like I can make a smart move in modern WoW PVP and it doesn't matter because the fight is so long that it's just a blip in the encounter.  Basically, individual moments were more important.
---
I played alliance in vanilla and I will play alliance in classic. I want to come home.. so for me it‚Äôs an easy choice. I might level a horde as an alt tho, since it is content I‚Äôve never played before and I feel like I should try it at some point..
---
Maybe where you live it's different? 
---
Your average consumer for purchasing investments are generally buying into mutual funds, ETFs, and GICs. These are generally sold by banks or investment firms (generally smaller versions of banks). These salesmen, selling from institutions that hold and manage large amounts of capital, are considered to be bankers. I'm not talking about the guy who opened your chequing account... 
---
Accountants are tax people and asset managers. They help manage your assets and help you conform to tax laws.  Entities that are buying and selling capital would seek advice from an accountant, or if they need to do their tax returns or split/merge companies... They would seek out their accountant. You would not go to your accountant and ask for rates of return on liquid capital you have available.... They will simply tell you to go see an investment advisor (who is probably a banker). 
---
Things change once you get onto a larger scale of investing, or if you are self-investing on trader accounts. Either way, most CFAs and fund managers consider themselves to be bankers before accountants... But I guess neither title is correct once you get to that level. 
---
Either way, you have much learn. You're right, it can be a bit boring...

All I'm gonna say about that video is pick a side for the before and after..m and stick with it.
---
I got in day 1, leveled to 17 over a couple days and reported maybe 5 bugs. Haven't touched it since. Give me a permanent character to put more hours in. I never got far on Pservers for this same reason. The stress tests where fun and I'll join in on more of those, but I'm not leveling past 20.
---
Leave the grinding and all-day beta testing to the streamers who get paid to play and all their minions.
---
You must tank
---
You can't reset every week. It's too expensive. If you are serious about PVE and PVP in classic you will need two character.
---
Always a solid plan! Good luck!
---
My wife enjoys a strain called Durban Poison that seems to give you a good high without making you sleepy. Might be worth checking out.
---
I can, and it's less than 4k euro.
---
I've just stopped levelling on private servers, drop in and out on the alliance in redridge as a lvl 30 tauren druid flipping a coin on whether to help or hinder
---
I remember when they removed the racist human one
---
Ohhhhhhhhh beautiful!
---
This depends on how old-hat PAX is for you. If this is a novel experience and you were excited to go then make the most out of your four days there. It's up to you how you accomplish that, and if integrating Classic into it would be something you were glad you'd done a year later then go for it. In any case, remember that those four days will come and they will go. Classic will be around for a long, long time and I don't think the handicap of missing out on four days would be too significant to recover from.
---
Without them he might have tried on that step
---
First aid maybe but i dont feel any of the professions are a must NEED thing to do you can progress fairly fine without them
---
People who play Alliance are usually more laid back and I prefer how humans look in armor.
---
Or ya know, they'll watch them on their stream.
---
I do want RP-PVP, my first server was RPPVP - Lightninghoof.
---
&gt; Fishing is a bit odd.
---
I *think* it was still the case in vanilla that fishing was a good way to level the cooking skills as well.
---
Is feral hybrid resto to tank 5 mans and heal raids a thing or not really?
---
I have the beta, but I'm starting to feel more like you. Just hit 30 on my mage and I'm like.. I just want this to be release so I can go hard.
---
I had all my Vanilla screenshots on Photobucket. They lost/corrupted everything I had on there without any attempt at trying to recover them.
---
Fuck Photobucket.
---
If you think streamers are gonna cause any of what you just said in your first sentence you have brain damage. That has always been a thing on every server. And you want to avoid pretty much every server than? You're wanting something perfect which will never happen.
---
You must've had a better method than I did. The method I used back in the day involved a ton of wall climbing.
---
Shame :/
---
Been seeing you posting a lot, you have some good logic and explanation in your comments and stuff. 
---
How do we know this though? Has Blizz confirmed 47?
---
No it‚Äôs not. J is already wearing the suit in this scene. I watched men in black 1 2 and 3 a few days ago.
---
Pretty sure it does extra holy damage 70% of weapon damage iirc
---
I have an active sub on US realms.  Send me a PM and I can help you out!
---
I think the kind of people who make those posts are the ones whose wives/girlfriends won‚Äôt notice a difference.
---
Make your characters at launch, get some levels, then go to PAX and have fun with people IRL. You won‚Äôt lose anything with those 4 days, and the initial few months will be busy in all level ranges as most of the target audience have lifes. Also the slower you level, the more you can earn for selling stuff on the AH.
---
I was referring to the quote, not the pic.
---
LOTS of people "Saw" Illidan. Less saw KJ but a decent chunk did. Way more than 1-5% saw Illidan and i'd say 5-10% if not more "saw" KJ.
---
And Illidan was the Lich King of TBC, not KJ....
---
Prayers for you if you plan on rolling pvp server.
---
tell them, they seem to not understand that
---
This is how I did mission tables during one expansion... I guess it had to be WoD since Legion had an app?  Would RDP in from my phone to keep my missions going.   I wouldn't try to do anything intense over RDP, it's just not built for that.
---
By far my favorite BG, because it took the best of PvE and PvP and just mashed em together. I remember many a 9 hour AV.
---
Why are you playing on a TBC server to train for vanilla?
---
Man, when all your assumptions are way off. Feelsbadman, Korasuma was actually my shamans name almost 14 years ago :) Anime sucks, And what people are you referring to lmfao? who streamers? i could care less what happens to them, its just the fact everyone is getting so butt hurt about it, its quite fucking funny how pathetic everyone is worried about them.
---
Thought I wanted to try and go horde for classic but I enjoyed ally zones too much as a kid to betray my youngerself.
---
uguu
---
That guild name though
---
Yes it is.
---
Mouseover macros cast an ability over your mouse, when your mouse cursor is hovering over anything that can be targeted by that spell, including nameplates and character models.
---
This is different from cursor macros which cast, usually AoE abilities, directly at where your cursor is on screen without showing you the large green circle it will affect first.
---
Mouseover macros are particularly useful for healers, allowing them to cast spells onto anyone in their party or raid by simply hovering over their nameplate and using the spell, all without clicking anything.
---
Need more details
---
I couldn't make up my mind either, so now I play a hybrid version of all the classes.  Lol
---
Druid ftw.
---
"white knighting" just calling people out for their butthurt ass thoughts on how streamers are gonna ruin their experience. I see you also like to use other words very loosely aswell.
---
Thank you so much! A bunch of my friends are coming back for classic, and I was worried about picking a server that wasn't going to have a dynamic community.
---
This should be pinned!

I'm in the Beta since Week2 and I'm 36 now. I don't see a point in rushing at all. I crafted my Robe of Power with 33, got my Spellpower Dagger from SM Lib with 34 and got my Shadowdamage Offhand from my WarlockQuest with 36. 
---
The Main-Reason I wanted to play the Beta was to test all the Warlock-Quests I haven't played since 2006. 
---
I definitely won't farm Dungeons like a Retard, so that I can't see SM anymore in August.
---
Really? I've found myself that Horde players generally more chill while the allaince generally complain a lot more about things, although the horde has more elitists
---
I knew someone was gonna link this video... Pretty shitty video and all terrible reasons. Its as if the world revolves around the people complaining about streamers. But hey news flash, world doesn't revolve around you, its okay you can play any server and be fine. If you don't even watch the streamers you'd prolly not even know they were on your server.
---
Wait, do you have to train to learn specific weapons? I'm trying to remember. I know you have to raise your skill with a weapon to use it at it's full potential, but I can't recall if you have to go to an NPC to learn guns as a NE per se.
---
Nope. Started out as a Nelf Hunter in '04 but by '06 I had a 60 UD lock and Tauren Druid. Mained Horde ever since and will continue on release. I'll roll another Nelf eventually, Teldrassil and Darkshore hold a special place in my heart.
---
If Blizzard wanted you to have a wife, they would have issued you one with your subscription.
---
Horde, as always, since I started playing. It would just feel wrong, and I couldn't bring myself to ever hurt taurens.
---
Just preference of my friend group, not the point of the post.. also there are a lot of similarities between the 2.
---
Elemental is awesome in dungeons.  Maybe you're thinking of raids.
---
25%
---
Lmfao assuming i watch that fucking loser. And not white knighting, you should look up that term cause you have no idea what it means obviously.
---
That‚Äôs a terrible advice. Elemental requires raid gear, and you will only get that gear if you raid as Resto. Also leveling a Shaman to 60 usually takes more than a week of /played time, if he spends that time farming instead, his weekly respecs will be covered for months in advance.
---
Yes, what ever weapons you dont know, at level 10/20 you can go learn weapons, I think the only one that you have to wait until 20 on is polearms
---
Higher population interest though so will probably be overcrowded for sure.
---
In what world do you live in? It probably takes me 10 minutes to actually complete my shit. I don‚Äôt live in a world where I can just shit and walk at the same time.
---
She was sick! She was our main healer in raids and my pvp partner.
---
I guess none of the 50 videos of rogues pickpocketing proves what you claim?
---
Well hey, it's been like 13 years... I guess I did not recall correctly. I could of sworn there was a big difference between pserver rag and vanilla rag... 
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
No you don‚Äôt. But damn, the fact that you *actually* wish pre-alpha footage of a game 3 years before release shouldn‚Äôt have a race shown in a place the released version wouldn‚Äôt have them....... Jesus man
---
I just meant specifically streamer and his hordes vs hardcore players on one server.
---
And due to having so many servers chances a hardcore guild will win out against a streamer *because* there are so many servers, because couple hundred or thousand people preorganizing joining a huge streamer will quench any hardcore guild's ambition as they may recruit a solid 40 men roster prior to server launch however will then recruit from a smaller server player base than say on LH or Nost.
---
The hybrid tax had a good balance that was under utilized . I don‚Äôt disagree with blizz north on the hybrid tax what I disagree with is how they made dungeons utilize it. It should have been doubled down on the abilities they had multifaceted ways to use the class. Most people just did not peak on multitasking ie a tanking Druid who could throw a heal or two, innervate, cleanse and can catform do‚Äôs is by no means a liability. As a vanilla raid leader who made it to the end of aq40 I didn‚Äôt look at the tax as a bad thing I looked at the player. Dps meters and heal meters mean crap if the player is doing 10 other helpful things at the same time. I‚Äôve seen a off tank Druid battle res the main tank, heal him up and go right back to cat to dps so many times I can‚Äôt count and that‚Äôs just one of the kind tricks. Rl who discounted this we‚Äôre fools. Yes off specs were situational but with 40 mana you could bring plenty of situational as long as they were good and still down all the bosses
---
Orc Warlock or Tauren Shaman depending on how much time I'll have to play.

" Its hard to do anything 'in character' in Stormwind without some level 26 human paladin looking for a group for the Stockades running up and calling you autistic or jumping around being an annoyance or 'dancing suggestively' in your face or some other juvenile shit. Its really gotten bad. "  This is something i found about it, someone who was bitching about what you're talking about. Damn man, thats so bad... people dancing around you and someone you can put on ignore.
---
you didn't even bother to refute anything in the video
---
Not really true, once you log in to your character you'll be assigned a layer - it's not like people will be phasing out while playing.
---
I mean for the top 1% should have zones to themselves but not for long since that 1% will be a lot more players trying to rush to 60.
---
A reasonable amount of debuff slots.
---
I am a monster
---
We were.

Sure, handing out personal info to a complete stranger, what could go wrong! ;p
---
Every single hardcore guild will require Engineering on your main.
---
That's just the shit actually leaving the butthole. Doesn't include clean up or travel time. It's kind of a survival thing really. Humans in the wild would be really vulnerable while shitting.

Qlq
---
Dwarves are the least played race, Alliance players really have no taste.
---
Sweet, can we get someone to do the same on horde?
---
I dont plan to play in them nolife guilds so im fine
---
From my experience from Vanilla to Cata the horde guilds I was in were definitely more elitist and the alliance were fairly relaxed.
---
Nice overview of how each expansion changed how WoW played. Are you planning to do a in depth analysis of each expansion? I think it would be interesting. (also, I would like a in depth analysis of wotlk, as I have a irrational hate to that expansion, and I would like to change my mind about that)
---
If you wanna join gathering data (esp. horde side) you can download the fixed client here: [https://github.com/christophrus/CensusPlus-Classic/releases](https://github.com/christophrus/CensusPlus-Classic/releases)
---
I'm currently working on a modern version of warcraftrealms.com where we can put together our gathered data and make same fancy stats browsable for everyone.
---
I think "most things" is a stretch. A lot of things, sure, and I don't doubt the power of the Mandela effect, but private servers are hands down the best way to currently relive vanilla, warts and all.
---
Gnomes will swim in puddles. Almost positive I saw a gnome have to swim through a tiny portion of water in the wetlands by the murlocs where his human friend just walked through at normal speed.
---
lol at the chats on those pics
---
I find if you microwave it, wait for it to beep, go pee and wash your hands , when you get back to your hot pocket it will be a perfect temperature
---
That zone always felt half finished to me.
---
I love/hate the tauren so much. Can't decide on a race for my shaman in classic.
---
I am. Wasn‚Äôt planning on it but am.
---
Started ally (horde was first char but only got to 20), went horde mid TBC been horde since. Was going to roll horde with all my friends but my wife decided she would join. Told her she could have her choosing of race and I would follow so ally it is. Got one buddy who would rather be ally so he is joining us.
---
Stole my meme
---
It's amazing how many dinged 60 on grinding yetis 
---
Cant wait to do it again!
---
Haha I used to want a Gnome Rogue with full Deathdealer's so badly, this was the next best thing.
---
Great article. What were you miffed about? I'd blue fits so much better than pink
---
So not a second swing of the weapon right?
---
I booted up a toon on private for the first time since like Wrath.
---
Fuckin around on 4-5 classes because I feel like my classic selection will be the most difficult choice I ever have to make.
---
Streamers are going to attract more kids, more trolls, longer queues, population balance issues and economy issues. You don't see why?!
---
&gt;Cataclysm did a lot of things wrong, but ~~Heroic Rag~~ Firelands in general was not one of them.
---
I know "it's beta" and "nothing matters" etc. but I wouldn't be surprised if the census a month after classic release looked very similar to this one.
---
\&gt;This is most likely blahblahblah
---
these blizzard shills are everywhere.
---
Ooga bros are my besties
---
Trying to figure things out as they come and asking around nicely should be more than enough. 
---
Visit your class trainer often but only spend money to level the skills which you are actually using. And make sure to level Cooking and First Aid, and keep everything White quality and above to sell on the AH.
---
\&gt;Nuh uih youre wrong im right!!!
---
literally children play WoW
---
I would be careful with pservers tbh, they might sour your view on classic as all the popular pservers have already reached the end of their cycles ( naxx released a while back ), so you can expect a lot of over-geared bored lvl 60s running around camping players... more so than usual I mean.
---
Yeah idk what happened, only thing I can think of is twitch deleted it because of that copyrighted song playing in the back ground?
---
OP....do you remember the name of that font you used???
---
This anon is correct. Since I didn't get into the beta I've watched several of the streamers and within seconds you can tell who used to play and who didn't. I've talked to a ton of the old school players who were all on the bleeding edge back in the day and they are all coming back. Its gonna be very interesting to see how this all plays out.
---
and then your nodes and such respawn.
---
make sure to mention that.
---
I was just about to say...
---
I've never seen anyone post about their spouse leaving them and I check this subreddit at a borderline unhealthy rate.
---
Thats because there‚Äôs fuckall to do on retail.

Isn‚Äôt really an unpopular opinion, firelands is considered one of the greatest raids of all time, up there with Karazhan and Ulduar, even the vanilla shills can appreciate the masterpiece that was ulduar, Karazhan and firelands.
---
The only reason rolling Alliance is acceptable.
---
Early on a lot of white mats are good for cooking (boar meet, scorpid stings etc.) and you actually increase the value by cooking, even when vendoring them.
---
No, I don't think you understand what I'm speculating:
---
On Retail:
---
Oceania has PvE and PvP.
---
US Pacific has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
US Mountain has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
US Central has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
US Eastern has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
Latin America has PvE and PvP.
---
Brazil has PvE and PvP.
---
Europe English has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
Europe French has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
Europe German has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
Europe Russian has PvE and PvP.
---
Europe Spanish has PvE, PvP, and RP.
---
Europe Italian has PvE and PvP.
---
China has 5 Groups all with PvE and PvP.
---
Korea PvE and PvP.
---
Taiwan has PvE and PvP.
---
If each of these regions gets one server of each type they already have, that's 48 servers.

---
Yeah once i get some more practice on them
---
That's true. But to me it seems that warriors are better for progression (can get all defensive) *and* for speed/farm runs (can wear full dw threat, keep aggro off everyone and do crazy DPS). Bears are in between and therefore their utility is questionable.
---
However, tables kind of turn if we think of it as "tanky bear with good TPS" vs "squishy dw warrior with good TPS that also always wants to steal DPS gear from actual furies".
---
Don't level as Boomkin though, I can attest.
---
Chapter 1 starts at lvl 21? Il be so lost before reaching that point D:
---
Priest pl0x!
---
This is not appropriate use of the subreddit. However, how did you computer die? How did it break? What're the symptoms?
---
Pretty much every poll and PS census has always said the same thing and this reinforces it so yeah, it's likely predictive of release. Warrior/Mage -&gt; everyone else -&gt; Warlock/Druid
---
No serious guild will let you dps or try tankning in a raid.
---
&gt; I see no difference between being a twat and doing that, or stream sniping someone for hours
---
like I said... 95% of this whole subreddit doesn't know the difference between streamsniping to grief/camp someone, and organically finding someone and camping them... you just proved my point.
---
Anyway, the difference is that if you're streamsniping, you're using an outside source to find the location of the player, it's cheating. It's like using a wallhack in csgo. A streamsniper will always know you're location despite if you're in stealth, or in a hidden area. It's makes it into an unfair fight as opposed to if you went to a mainly alliance populated zone as horde to gank someone. It's on an even playing field. 
---
Basically, a streamsniper is a "fucking loser" because they need an unfair advantage from an outside source to actually win something in their life.
---
Mind explaining how you can make money cooking specifically at this level?
---
Definitely; oh and make sure to stick to the main road in Duskwood it's very dangerous if you stray from the path. There are patches of very dangerous enemies.
---
Yes, but orks start with 2 handed axes.... whereas humans, for example, don't. So some classes are much easier than others 1-10 because they have viable weapon options, and some are stuck flailing around with a 3.8dps gladius almost until they do their level 10 warrior quest.
---
Is there any way you would be able to make a 2560x1440p version of this for my wallpaper? I main a pally in this Armour currently and this looks so sick!! (Also keep making more this is amazing artwork!)

Ohman, it's all coming back to me. I remember training polearms on my hunter cause I think a few were good leveling stat sticks back in the day...
---
Posts like this is why I keep coming back to this sub. The hype I got from reading things like this is intense!
---
Also there is like a 10 minute black screen at the end of your video that just has looping music and nothing else.
---
I seem to remember these bosses would get bigger and stronger the more enemy players they killed. So by the time they pushed back to the enemy base, they were giant destruction machines. I could be remembering that wrong.

For most of us it's full bore; for Classic WInds though it'll definitely be full boar : P
---
Join a guild next time.
---
ESDF? You should try using WERD or ERTF. I also removed turn and rebound them to strafe. Many new easily accessible keys with this setup.
---
I wonder if this is would be an expensive but viable way to give Pally buffs to a horde raid. Have 2 characters alliance side pally/priest literally at a raid entrance to quick buff the horde raid through mind control
---
Also worth noting hunters cant use maces
---
yeah, there are some dry spots iirc but fishing should last you some

---
Awwe that sucks. Was hoping on them good old days AV.
---
People are different, but IMO the difficulty of Vanilla makes everyone more willing to do team play. 
---
Also, LFR is a bad example - you can just leave LFR and never see these people again.
---
Don't play it then.
---
Farm the charge weapons and be willing to tank when needed and you'll find a home for the feral :)
---
&gt; Shadowmeld
---
If I recall aim shot had a 3-6 second cast in classic and using shadowmeld and then aim shot the meld didn't break until the aim shot went off, meaning it was essentially cast from stealth. It was powerful enough back in the day to one shot unsuspecting mages.
---
Is it still necrofeelia if you're both dead already?
---
Yeah its pretty normal if you don't do any physical activity to not waste the time/water/soap showering every day.
---
Source:  Work construction and am anal about showering at the end of every work day, but frequently skip days if I don't work/work out because why bother?
---
Don't even bother trying to argue about body oils and sweat after 24 hours.  Cut your greasy fucking hair short and don't eat garbage like mountain dew, doritos and taco bell and maybe your sweat won't be disgusting and your head won't feel  greasy.
---
or it means that you have agency as opposed to being someone else's mindless agent and nothing more
---
I think towers are still going to matter with it limited to classic gear and levels, right? At one point towers definitely mattered, but then I also remember a time when teams were zerging the boss with all towers up.
---
I don‚Äôt understand this argument. WoW Classic is easier than Retail in every way except one: time investment required.
---
What is this sorcery??? An unpopular opinion post that is actually unpopular?? I am amazed.
---
Assert dominance, insert dominance.  Potato potato.
---
I think it depends on the community that the streamers bring in. A community brought in by Crendor, or Preach isn't going to be the same as the community brought in by Sodapoppin or Asmongold. I think it's okay for people to know ahead of time whether or not that's the type of server they want to be on. Some players also just want a more organically developed server community, and you won't get that with big streamers on the server.
---
Super super interesting. Thank you so much. Horde data would be great too. Hopefully someone with beta access can provide it
---
The fact that it takes *so long* to find groups means people are far more willing to teach others and act polite. I remember plenty fo shitty groups, but I also remember people sticking it out and going on to do more dungeons with them. I remember many a time re-running the SM dungeons with the same people as we all tried to get specific items.
---
You should know how to google stuff
---
Same! I played a few of the zones but by the time TBC came out I was still an absolute scrub and didn't know anything about the game for at least another year. I don't wanna spoil anything for myself, in a sense
---
Wish they kept the goldshore look. Looks way more like a village than a forge and an inn.
---
Some guild requires you to be engineer on your main, you kinda need it to for pvp too. That means your going to need mining on at least one of your characters. If your resto your going to need a toon to grind or farm for gold and consumable. Leveling to 60 is nothing compared to what you need to grind every week for raids. Think about all those mobs you need to kill for your daily grind. I doubt you ever been in a 40 man raid.
---
Me too, playing a few days on stress days is more than enough. The real battle starts on August 27th
---
Ah come on tho that rag with less model looks fuckin sick tho
---
Hmmm... don‚Äôt add them because if they are added, I‚Äôm going to have to play horde....
---
Did they add more quests in prepatch tbc? I first time dinged 60 during prepatch and I can‚Äòt remember that I had to grind mobs even once
---
Really? I'd claim it'll be way less of a cesspool than experiences on pservers. I'm be so glad when all the same old racist/sexist/homophobic shit will get people banned.
---
Are those cum stains? Have some self respect man.
---
Communication is important.  Use the public LFG channel to find groups.  Once the group is full, saying something positive in party chat to encourage other people to get moving, eg "Great, i've just finished this quest, on my way to the dungeon now".
---
Let the tank pull and get aggro.  A decent tank will usually ranged pull and then bloodrage, before using sunder.  Don't attack until a sunder has landed, don't spam your abilities before the second sunder.
---
Vanilla dungeons are not linear and many people will not remember the exact layout.  Don't worry if you get a bit lost.
---
Dungeon quests often have chains to unlock them.  These are not mandatory, but if you plan to do a dungeon you might want to look up the quests before hand, do the chains and pickup all of the quests.
---
Whatever the circumstances were, it was bad ass. And it helped set the tone of a mana-addicted race that was capable of anything to get the power they sought.
---
I question my class choice every single week lol.
---
Felcloth/Mooncloth will be more expensive closer to phase 4.
---
Greater Nature Protection potions and mats will be more expensive closer to phase 5.
---
Greater Shadow/Frost Protection and mats potions will be more expensive closer to phase 6.
---
0/30/21 HotW/NS  
---
Won't be a great tank and won't be a great healer but can do both fine if you have decent gear sets for both. Can be very useful to a raid because it's rare you need X healers or X tanks so it's nice to have some flexibility.  
---
Great for running dungeons because if you can tank or heal you're virtually guaranteed instant groups for any dungeon.
---
I said elsewhere above that I think this is going to be harder than people think, being restricted to classic gear and levels.
---
Also yes, the blizzard announcement says the only way to finish the game is kill the boss, nothing about ending it via enforcements.
---
Sounds good, hopefully Blizzard won‚Äôt be too harsh on shitposting either, though I have my doubts after their ban on the OK sign.
---
Altercal, really?
---
Exactly. Makes friends in game and play with them. Not exactly rocket science.
---
Excellent write up. Everything is spot on and I have a feeling most people here agree with your points. Classic is the dream MMO. I'm partial to TBC because I've been an Alliance Shaman main since TBC. I think TBC had more balanced specs (compared to classic). Honestly, if wow classic had alliance shaman it would be the only game I ever need. Oh well.... guess I'm horde now?
---
&gt; In vanilla, you had to play smart, not fast. 
---
Sounds almost most like some kind of RPG or something.
---
Is that the lowest settings? I don't remember the graphics being THAT bad
---
Warriors are no worse with bad gear than anyone else. They will be topping meters when everyone is in greens, and when everyone is in blues, and when everyone is in epics.
---
I still have the add-on for this guide on my computer
---
This was already proven entirely wrong 15 years ago.
---
Why not just level in the Nelf area? I never understood the whole running to another starting zone thing.  Even Undead going to Valley of Trials is silly, but Nelf to Goldshire is just absurd.  Why not just learn your races starting zone and save so much time?
---
But that‚Äôs cheating
---
Don‚Äôt call me Shirley.
---
Dungeon finder? That was in wrath
---
My favorite bit of old AV was that it felt like a real Battleground you were fighting in. Not an empty field of capture the flag like warsong. 
---
Each bunker had a bunker captain and squad of troops to defend it at all cost. Not a handful of archers. 
---
Each tower had the same. 
---
Galvager, and Balinda each had 2 lt's out in front of their entrance to help protect them. 
---
Gather enough mine supplies and an assault team would storm the field of strife and go right to the enemy base. Mediocre health and absurd damage. 
---
Wolf/ram rider, Ivus/Lok, Wing Commanders that rained death on enemies from above because they mattered and you actually made sure they got back to the base. 
---
I remember my rogue was fairly geared and I made it my mission to stealth into the alliance base at the start of each AV and murder Noreg (spelling) Stormpike so alliance couldn't do one of their turn in, and it felt so good. 
---
I can not wait for this. Also I remember waaaaay early when the BG bracket range was actually lower and you could get in at level 30. There was a level 30 twink who was grinding rep for the exalted mount that didn't need special riding at the time. 
---
Good times.
---
Tanking is incredibly fun and rewarding. If you start early you will learn the ropes LONG before any of it gets difficult.
---
I think it was the best way to earn the titles back in the day. I remember earning lieutenant general by just playing games. I wasn't even good. They changed gaining honor and such later, some kind of diminishing returns in big groups or something. I don't remember exactly but it was nerfed.
---
I heard there's a popular app used exactly to keep in touch with your guild. Dicksord or something like.
---
&gt;months of agony trying to pick a class
---
Some of you must have really tough lives if you can't make it past this hurdle.
---
i know how he feels though. Warrior is my favorite class but being tank is more than equipping a shield and spamming buttons. Having the tanking role means you lead the group, choose the path and set the pace. Being uncomfortable in a unknown dungeon or questioning your own ability to keep threat can be a big task if you don‚Äôt have the leader personality or self confidence. But the best thing you can do against it is starting to learn to tank in early dungeons while leveling.
---
looks like TBC tbh
---
I don't understand why there are people actually upset that a lot of players don't want to play with streamers. If you want to play with streamers, then do it. You'll deal with a lot less complaints about streamers without all those people on the server anyway, i'm sure... right?
---
Imagine if they did a WoLTK progression server, and wintergrasp came back.
---
Yep, he's there. Shirtless in all his glory.
---
You know how I know none of these are vanilla and it‚Äôs all TBC or later? The green dungeon group finder icon on your action bar.
---
When was the damage and healing added to scorescreen in BGs? I noticed it isn‚Äôt on beta
---
Luckily, no one is forcing you to play it. (I really hope not anyway)
---
the real question is - why did you format this as a code block
---
You are awesome
---
He probably got beta haha. Let's gooo!!!
---
Wrath was the first time I hit level cap, and I absolutely adored Cata Heroics. It was the only time five man content ever actually felt difficult until I started pushing Mythic+ in Legion.
---
The legend
---
It's a second swing that can be dodged etc. This change was made later in vanilla I believe.
---
Why thank you!
---
I disagree. It's at least 120, or more likely 200+ hours of gameplay until the endgame. If you hate your char during these hours (i.e. weeks, or more likely months), you may never learn to love it, so it will all be in vain.
---
cata is when blizzard decided to make the game hard. 99% of the bosses before cata are tank and spanks.
---
Thanks for the interesting read. Same result regardless yeah. I'm new to addon development, but that's how I understand it to work based on my testing on retail. At least for spell casts.
---
Don‚Äôt want beta, don‚Äôt watch streamers, YouTube. I want vanilla to be vanilla. 
---
YouTube and twitch were not out back when vanilla launched or at least twitch wasn‚Äôt and YouTube was not even known so it was more fun.
---
The point of the unpopular opinion meme is to say something unpopular that makes you think and has some truth, not just make shit up that's blatantly wrong and act superior.  For eg is I say "Unpopular opinion; Hitler was awesome", then yes it's unpopular but it also makes no sense, so it'd be a really stupid thing to say.  
---
Classic WoW will not be a toxic cesspool. You'll make a friends and join a guild, and the 1/100 people that is retarded you won't play with again.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, those people are very creative when it comes to creating hate symbols out of ordinary things.
---
Yeah it was an accident, youtube editor is taking forever to update the quick fix ive made so for now its going to have to stay like that.
---
My hearthstone is always set to Feralas like a good mage. üòÅ
---
Not really. 15 years ago everyone was a noob in the 1st place and it the 2nd place what we had 15 years ago, in the end led to situiations and community within retail WoW we have right now. Part of it lies within gearscores and other shit but part of it lies within community itself. Because - you see - after years of doing same content over and over again, nobody wants to spend there more time than needed. Would you like to do WC for over 2 hours, not counting time to travel there? I don't really think so. I think that OP concerns are justified and only time can tell if it will come treu or not.
---
Out of the loop here
---
Pally/Shaman stuff was dropping for both factions through at least BWL on retail servers.
---
Do words penetrate your safe space?
---
it's just 6 years old and died
---
Ok I was wrong about addons being banned and people who use certain addons getting banned but people will still get banned for harassment, which is caused directly from your addon. So yes, simply having the addon installed won't get you banned, but doing what the addon encourages(harassment of players) will get you banned.
---
When someone comes along preaching misery about a good thing I become interested in their personal damage. We create our own experience to a large extent with the attitude we have going in and the memories we cling to on the other end. Hopefully you can recalibrate a bit if you choose to play, if not for your own sake than for ours.
---
Wish, dangerous territory their son.
---
Just curious what the benefits of those key layouts are compared to standard WASD? Just the way your hand is positioned allows you to reach more keys easily or..?
---
That's exactly the point. You're going to have to invest time with other people.
---
I can usually pull together a free 10-15 gold just vendoring back jungle stew while in stv just while questing alone. With a little bit of cognizant effort to clear tigers while doing other quests you can net absolute tons of money that way.
---
[Only real 90's kids get this reference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqCkDcx6KIs)
---
Because friends. They‚Äôll be playing either human or dwarf.
---
And leveling itself I'd say. But it's only because leveling was a meaningful content back then and huge part of the game. Now - even with a new expansion - nobody cares about leveling and therefore it's a cake-walk.
---
Around 1.3 Blizzard wanted to change it so SoC only spell crit and spell hit, but decided against it after feedback. In 1.12 it can be dodged, parried, blocked, reduced by glancing blows, fully resisted and partially resisted.
---
&gt; paladins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shamans
---
Heresy!
---
Haha a part of me wants to do this.
---
Clean af UI
---
"blames and argument" this is going to be the worst. With all the guides, BiS, theory-crafter people will /spit on you because you didn't put 1 points into the optimal talent. Try to have fun with a boomkin in classic. Joining a guild with like minded people will be essential.
---
Hate to tell you, but all of these bosses have been downed over a decade ago... üôÑ
---
Looks really good mate! I'd love to se feral as if you're doing another. Got all the detail, the nice green coloring and it's also my favorite zone!
---
To show us he is special, as all Ret wannabes are.
---
People who act toxic will build a reputation.
---
Time investment makes you attached.

Besides, leveling is many times more difficult than on retail. During first 120-200+ hours of game, a Vanilla player usually learns to be a good team player. While retailer learns to hate the brainless faceroll leveling and the random RDF bots for some 10 hours, then the endgame starts, and of course in LFR he's likely to behave in the same way - as if he's playing with stupid bots but not with his brothers in arms. If he continues, he joins a guild and probably chills/wises up a little.
---
It's all person-dependent of course, but I hope now my logic is clearer.
---
I get that most people try to maximize the experience by being there all day, but I've done it for years. I typically like to just go to a few panels, see a few games, go to an event.. and that's it. I also hate crowds and waiting in line so that probably has a lot to do with it. Odd, but that's how I am.
---
Fair enough.  I always just told mine I'll see you in the Barrens in 6 hours.
---
CORRECT
---
I've been playing 1.12 on private servers for several years now, let me give my two cents on the place of druids in the current meta, or how to better put it - the demand for druids at level 60.
---
PvE - druids are sub-par healers, because of the way HoTs stack (they don't), because their 3.5s cast turns into a 3.0s cast (hence proactive healing, but it's no picnic) and because Healing Touch is the only borderline mana-efficient spell in their arsenal with good scaling (100% of +healing).
---
On Alliance side, 2-3 druids are necessary for their NS-heal, which can be a lifesaver if the tank gets back-to-back crushing blows or during fights that see spikes in tank HP (paladin's Holy Shock range is 20yd).
---
On Horde side, shamans have Nature's Swiftness too, so one druid is more than enough for the buffs, and you will see people filling the remaining raid spots with Shamans (72% scaling on Chain Heal, amazing set bonuses and Healing Way) and Priests (great efficiency, covers shaman's lack of mobility)
---
As for the point on mobility, Vanilla boss fights are not big on mobility .. you have to consistently move on Firemaw during BWL and later on Heigan (the dreaded dance) in Naxxramas. Cthun requires proper initial positioning and you need minor adjustments on a couple of encounters, but really nothing like the dance-dance-revolution Retail wow has been running for a decade.
---
PvP - from what i've seen, a druid is always needed to run flags, but their healing is inefficient due to the nature of pvp - people dispel whomever they're focusing or your hots never reach full potential. Paladins are the most sought-after support class in battlegrounds, thanks to 12s bubble, Freedom and Blessing of Sacrifice (no cooldown, 30s duration, can cast on 4 people and be immune to CC). On Horde side you want priests to dispel your warriors' polymorphs and roots and whatnot
---
Obviously you farm shards before the raid but not using drain soul on mobs in the raid is just idiotic.
---
I remember in every good guild all the warlocks would purple-beam the mobs right before they died until they removed soul shards from the game.
---
Doing .1% more DPS is not worth not getting shards from trash.
---
Sure, in vanilla there were areas dedicated to certain levels, but I think the point OP was making is that during expansions there's one zone where you have to level for that level. During vanilla you had many choices for each level range.
---
You make valid points. I have been many times before, so that's part of it. I'm also one of those people that has to hit 60 before 95% of the population. It's just who I am unfortunately, lol.
---
Ignoring trades, groups, chat, and auctions from another player for any reason is not considered harassment, nor is any act of PVP, regardless of the effort involved.
---
If you'd seen my comment below I acknowledged these spanning from Vanilla into about mid-way through BC. 
---
You've got a sharp eye, but isn't it easier to point out the level 70 selling me leg enchant? Heh.
---
Didn't mean to deceive anybody, I played one 19 Gnome Rogue before this toon, then later made Jza as well.
---
I started twinking between the middle and end of Vanilla, so you're not wrong. My bad?
---
I second this
---
As I said in the first comment on this post, it's both Vanilla and on into TBC. Sheesh, purists!
---
this is a good point, thank you
---
I could be wrong on this but I'm pretty sure damage and healing were there throughout Vanilla. It's been a while, though.
---
Well, he is looking to get all of the world firsts, so I guess it‚Äôs just the completionist in him.
---
I can't feel my horde character getting raped around the farms again
---
Thanks, worked hard on it.
---
Its funny to see how bad UIs were back then lol
---
Truth be told. I just re-bought a subscription in anticipation of Classic, and I‚Äôm passing the time leveling a rogue for the hell of it (also to gauge my wife‚Äôs reaction to me playing). I don‚Äôt need the beta to keep myself entertained until August. Not gonna buy BfA either, if I hit 110, I‚Äôll just start over.
---
One of my least favourite zones too. Damn Raptors everywhere.
---
Getting there first and getting there the fastest (speedrunning) is the only hardcore content left in WoW Classic.
---
I am, lol. PvP or die.
---
I‚Äôve been rolling shaman since TBC and I‚Äôd say it mostly depends on your main spec. I‚Äôd rock Orc if enhance, troll if elemental, and split between troll/Tauren for resto depending which racial fit your play style best. But I‚Äôll most likely do Tauren shaman for resto and troll for rogue.
---
Inspiring /yell macros
---
blame the spriest that somehow got a spot
---
Personally I am not a fan of the "inverse-T" choice of keys for movement, but I did often consider using RDFG during WotLK since I always felt like I was short on ability hotkeys on the left... only thing that stopped me from switching was muscle memory. But I may give it a try here with Classic.
---
Patches
---
The internet will always have toxic people
---
The reason Classic WoW will work better is those people will find it harder to play in anonimity when the community (i.e. server) is capped at 3500 people (of which half you don‚Äôt even speak to)
---
Just don‚Äôt be a jerk, and you will naturally coalesce towards the other non-jerks
---
I agree , I stumbled across this thought the other day , I hopped on a private server and was like , this is just going to ruin it , I‚Äôm now waiting for release . Even if I got a beta invite I most likely wouldn‚Äôt take advantage of it lol .
---
Good God that's ghastly!
---
Only after the patch, but in aq and naxx the token system was used so it was far less noticeable, there were still some  drops that were faction specific that would drop for both factions after the patch, trying to find a source now as to which patch it was, has to have been 1.11 or 1.12 though. Maybe the one stuff always dropped though but I don‚Äôt remember. Will update when I find a link.
---
Nobody really cares about leveling in Classic either. It‚Äôs all about getting your route under 4 days /played, which is an infinitely smaller part of the time most people will spend in this game.
---
Bypassing that would be breaking the TOS.
---
You mean that road Stitches paths down ;-)
---
Yes this can be done with move anything
---
Reminds me of Clerks.
---
Oh nice, Gsync too. Thanks fella.
---
Yes I buy as well :)
---
You know how to use a search function right?
---
Looks like an actual WC3 mmo! I miss the distinct orc helmets
---
Not really
---
The title hints some sad story about OP not having much in common with his little brother and his best friend :(
---
Currently on the pve beta realm, you're lucky if you even see one group running DM, BFD, Stockades.  There's just not enough people on.  It's a weekend and /who showed max of 30 people per class, with most around 20.  This is for all level ranges.
---
Looked like something out of Morrowind
---
God no it does not lol.
---
Relative to time itself, I'll hardly be spending any time at all on classic. Moderated.
---
Maybe you should take this enthusiasm for being a pretentious asshole and put it to better use, like seeking professional help. Your replys just sad and boring.
---
There's a cool Spelladin build being theory crafted:
---
https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-and-p3-bis-new-meta
---
Go ret if you want bro, you can raid as ret no worries.
---
Your tap water, not ours lol... That's fucked.
---
I think you may be right, but I don't recall honestly. This was long before TBC though (Feb 2005).
---
But in my case here for my first 60 during vanilla, I didn't run out of quests (IIRC there were a ton I had not done yet in EPL, plus a bunch remaining in Winterspring even). I just decided I liked this spot for grinding whilst trying to do the silly yeti quest with the terrible drop rate.
---
It was 2.0 tbc patch, released December 2006.
---
Tbc was released late January 2007
---
Well it's a good thing everyone doesn't want to be hardcore then.
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/488/world-of-warcraft-classic-compendium
---
Safe space intensifies
---
The details are so many that what you will need is a structure that helps you as you go along
---
Hence my recommendation to you:
---
Find a good guild with helpful people (whilst you are levelling), and give back to them as much as you can
---
i mean they're just kill is as soon as possible, MC is the easy part. But doing it #1 is the hard part. This race includes 1-60 leveling. And everyone knows the game. Hunderds of guilds could do Rag in a week at max level but only a few will even attempt this seriously. Even server first will mean nothing to people doing this, its world first or bust.
---
I literally found it in 2 seconds. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D-DC_G7hX1o
---
Thanks, was going through the wrong patch notes you saved me lots of time :)
---
So there‚Äôs a chance on melee hit to do 70% extra damage as holy...
---
‚ÄúPatch 2.0.1 (2006-12-05): A new Looking For Group tool designed to assist players in finding groups for instanced dungeons and quests will now be available. This interface gives players the option to be added to a pool of other players also looking for a group, as a means to expedite the process. In addition, players will also be able to search for additional members in situations where they have a group and are simply looking to find more players. For a complete overview of this new interface, please take a moment and read the information contained on our comprehensive Looking for Group preview. ‚Äú
---
nah you just care too much about things that literally don't matter
---
I still find it absolutely ridiculous how players bullied the lead developer (which probably turned into a decision from the top of the company after his post) into nerfing most of the heroics because the lesser skilled playerbase had too much trouble with them. 
---
People blame Ghostcrawler for a lot of things, but him standing up for the difficulty of the heroics then was respectable. He didn't think everyone had to always have access to everything and be able to complete it all.
---
Polearm is the only level restricted one.  You can learn any other at lvl 1
---
Best sylvanas model imo
---
Surely you can‚Äôt be serious.
---
Real talk: HM Aerons can be had for ~$200 from closing offices, craigslist, etc. and they are WORLDS ahead of DxRacer and other gaming tier shit shit (I've had both in the past few years). I got a broken one for $75 and fixed it up with 1st party parts $150, it's basically brand new now.
---
It is however a very office-y chair, and while great for posture it won't feel as loungey as others like the Embody.
---
The next best upgrade, adjustable standing desk. Switching off sitting/standing every hour or so will keep you feeling more awake and less sore after long sessions.
---
If you have an office job, and spend 8hrs day behind a desk at work and then want to do another 8 on WoW, it's very worth the investment.
---
There is no pet move in classic.
---
Nearly everything has a DR. The initial commenter alluded to people being advanced enough to kit an enhance shaman, the onus now lies on an enhance shaman to know when to go for a kill, IE when the DR is fresh. That's when CD's should be popped and when you should be going for the kill
---
I'm thinking more in terms of lore and aesthetics and stuff. No race changes in classic so it has to be something I like. Lore-wise I lean tauren but I hate their model and animations. Trolls I don't care for. Orcs... they have great animations and models but after garrosh and warlords of draenor I'm in the camp that's completely turned off by orc savagery. Thrall, Drek'thar, Saurfang, and Duroton are like the only good orcs in their entire race.
---
They don't have the experience or practice leveling in Vanilla to make it to 60 &amp; gear in 10 days or less, it's just not going to happen. Nevermind a full 35-40. 100% chance a private server guild takes world 1st MC.
---
Don't worry, people are still fucking retarded even now.
---
This whole post is satire/trolling and nobody seems to get it. 
---
Blizzard also has beene doing a fairly decent job at keeping classic classic, so I'm not too worried about the issues you are describing.
---
High end Horde guilds will have their Shamans eventually all go 22 points into Enhance for this reason alone, then the rest of their points into resto. When you're killing bosses as fast as they are once you have bis on a decent amount of the raid, Mana Tide etc are not necessary at all since guilds like that will have healers popping Mana Pots &amp; Dark/Demonic Runes on CD, even during trash.
---
&gt; I click a few of my spells in retail and I'm still good at PvP
---
Yeah nope.  Mutually exclusive statements.
---
The Taurens have the largest hitbox, and the longest reach on their attacks (technically can make them poor hunters as the deadzone is really weird, but great warrior tanks) The Gnome has the shortest/smallest hitbox.  
---
[https://youtu.be/teF1RXD5nXw?t=140](https://youtu.be/teF1RXD5nXw?t=140)   
---
I actually think one of the overlooked reasons so many people played Undead Rogue is because the model has a very wide angle of reach compared to its size, making it good as both a caster and a melee. It was never something that I could really explain back in the day, but I always felt like I was simply better and had more reach when playing an undead rogue for some reason, it might be because of the underlying hitbox differences.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zANeJ\_lCSXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zANeJ_lCSXc)  
---
(The two examples used in this video are male UD and male Tauren, which both have very good range on their melee hits.. but the crucial element is that a long reach and a wide hitbox can do some absurd stuff when combined)
---
Orc female seems to be one of the best models to glitch through a lot of stuff with.   
---
Just tall enough to jump through stuff, just slender enough to sqeeze through.   
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/guzu/clip/TemperedCallousFiddleheadsSmoocherZ?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/guzu/clip/TemperedCallousFiddleheadsSmoocherZ?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)  
---
He also managed to glitch up behind Caverns of time as a female orc.
---
People often do Jed/Rend runs, this is as efficient as one can get. For full runs, the best comp should again depend on the loot competition more than on clearing speed.
---
By the way, do we already have estimates on how often rares appear in dungeons in Classic?
---
That's my memory too.  I had a *lot* of fun with guildies in WoW and others on my realm when we weren't actually fighting stuff, but figuring out *how* to go fight stuff.  Those were some great bonding times and loads of fun.  We would sit and fish and talk about the mechanics of the theater encounters in Kara.  And call each other bastards every time someone dinged a new point in fishing skill.
---
I want to roll with my original faction, but the fuckers i know who are coming back to play it, wanna swap sides. So i'm stuck with joining friends on the faction i'm not fond of, or picking the faction i like, and starting solo.
---
Thanks. I am not looking to really raid hardcore or really even on a regular basis. I will be joining a group of casual friends. I haven't been paying attention to WoW Classic news since it was announced... are they planning to balance things and make specs more viable or is the current plan just to keep everything as is as it was at certain point in time? (save for the raid and dungeon phasing of course)
---
I keep telling myself i want the beta but to be honest if i was the only one of my friends to have it id probably hit level 15 and get bored.
---
Not really, all my important skills are keybinds. Sometimes I have the chance and I'm lazy so I'll click. Not mutually exclusive, your just stupid
---
And with such a busy grinding schedule when would OP be actually be able to PvP on his Shaman?
---
I doubt you have a life :^)
---
The non-meme solution to #2 is a bidet. In and out in under a minute 30, even the shortest flight paths are ample time.
---
I like this. I spent so many hours in barrens chat it‚Äôs not even funny. Those were good days.
---
Thankyou for putting alternatives in. It always gives me a good chuckle when people put double freezing band in on their phase 1 BIS list, and similar nonsense for other classes.
---
Even though this isn‚Äôt Vanilla, I still really enjoy this post, I remember starting a twink in BC so this brings back a lot of nostalgia value as well as because I used the staff of Jordan on my twink, and that staff got me introduced to the mage class (which I‚Äôll be playing for classic) and the reason why that staff is relevant to twinking, and the mage class is because my name is Jordan that‚Äôs why lol, so because of my name I got introduced to twinking and the mage class luckily.
---
A better way to put it is that it's a chance on melee to do an extra attack that will only do 70% damage. This extra attack can be separately dodged, parried, blocked, or reduced by glancing blows.
---
The fact that it's Holy damage only does two things:
---
* It scales a bit with spell power (but very poorly in comparison to the scaling it does with attack power). It is not at all affected by spell crit.
---
* It can be fully and partially resisted.
---
thanks, very helpful. i was using streamlink but the latest update made shit stop working and i see ads all the time on it now :-(
---
I never was into PVP. My point is just that in the end, it's pretty hard not to have at least 1 alt.
---
Join the discord b. I'm gonna invite everyone I know who understands barrens chat when I get home from work. If everyone does that we will have a small army of "12y/o" just talking like its 2006 barrens
---
Renaming an addon folder is not breaking the TOS.
---
Really nice commentary on the changes and the problems they introduced on the way.
---
Flying mounts broke the world as you could just fly over mobs and obstacles (luckily it was usually forbidden until late in the expansion).
---
For me Cataclysm was a bummer as it broke the best areas (Ashenvale, Straglethorn Vale, etc) - someone stated here that after Cata there was more feeling of war, but at least for me that wasn‚Äôt an improvement - I didn‚Äôt play WoW to experience a war, but to explore the beautiful and magical world and the wonders it held.
---
Scaling is also a huge drawback as it effectively kills different play styles by fixing the challenge level;  in Vanilla I mostly used to play in areas couple of levels higher than my druid, often getting killed on quests and trying them again and again to learn how I could manage them underpowered and under-geared, while a good friend mainly leveled in areas 3-5 levels below her character‚Äôs level. To each their own.
---
And lastly the main killer for me - why on earth does the classes and their skills and talents have to reshuffled all the time? Just why? I used to try to have all healers in max level, but constantly relearning how to play all the classes just became too much (with the constant weekly grind for gear) so that I had only 2 classes maxed out in Legion and now none in BfA (haven‚Äôt even bought it)... Leveling used to be fun, then it became just a chore to run through before the endgame. In Vanilla it was never about the endgame, it was about the journey.
---
Well, soon we‚Äôll see if classic is all it feels to have been, but it truly was the most fun I had playing WoW.
---
Shut up and move along ffs
---
Honestly if you are GMT+3 you‚Äôre desired raiding hours aren‚Äôt that different to what mine will be and I‚Äôm in an EU guild (we‚Äôll be doing Wednesday and Sunday 21:00 - 00:00 CET which is 23:00-02:00 your time)
---
Heck the guild I was on in a private server had exactly the hours you want
---
Keep looking am sure you‚Äôll find one, here‚Äôs the Classic WoW guilds discord where you should be able to find one:
---
https://discord.gg/pUVgFA5
---
"Social life" and "meaningful things" are something you can have in game...
---
Good thing you said 'bye', otherwise we wouldn't have known your comment had ended.
---
Still better than BFA.
---
I'm torn 50/50, almost always been horde, can't decide if I want to have more fresh content or go for more comfort/nostalgia
---
Kimpan from Jaedenar by any chance ?
---
When she feigns death, but she‚Äôs wet and you still have a bone poking out.
---
lmao, sure
---
Subtle difference. So basically you can get a SoC proc and have it get dodged. That seems counterintuitive since it‚Äôs holy damage
---
[X'caliboar!](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10758)
---
I'm just gonna quit my job to no-life classic for a month. Moderation my ass.
---
Alliance till WotLK, I played a nelf hunter (marksman) for years, and in Wrath I switched to orc dk, loved the horde whenni got introduced because of that and made a troll warlock (which I played till end of legion when I quit), but the main reason I stuck with horde is because whenever I asked for help for things like ‚Äúwhere is this, how do I do this‚Äù things like that, in the alliance people either always ignored me or were a dick to me. While in the horde whenever I asked stuff like that (I asked a lot more since I was learning the place) the first person I asked always helped me a ton, told me exactly what to do, or even joined a group with me and helped me through an entire quest line, I‚Äôm sure it was 99% coincidence, and that there are equally dicks and nice people on either side but that coincidence left a lasting impression on me.
---
I have more nostalgic value on alliance, but nicer memories with horde.
---
Yes, character model size affects how you interact in the game.
---
You're tall, you might not fit onto small places.
---
Then give the ticket to some lucky grade school kid that would otherwise have no chance of attending.
---
This is like buying a ticket to the premiere of a move and only staying for the pre-show trailers.
---
Or going to Disney World, buying a hotdog, taking a shit in the public stall, and then going back out to the parking lot.
---
I've been to both PAXs, it was certainly something special, but not a vacation for me. I definitely would not reserve a ticket only to sit in a corner and play a game I'd be better off playing at home. 
---
You're just wasting space and don't belong.
---
Looks like my ex.
---
I reckon it‚Äôs easier to consolidate servers than to split them up so probably erring on too many is a safe bet
---
Been playing Alliance since Vanilla (NE Rogue), then main‚Äôd an Enhance Shaman starting in TBC. Once MoP rolled out I been a Brewmaster ever since. 
---
I‚Äôm really tempted to play Shaman in Classic and that means I‚Äôll have to go Horde. Still on the fence about it. I like the esthetic and familiarity of the Alliance, but Horde will provide a fresh new experience.
---
I am expecting them to not appear that much in classic wow.
---
The current meta strategy has long been effective, but required organized pvp guilds to make happen (as AV quests encouraged casual and disorganized players to shamble around on defense)
---
However, the meta is now standard, everyone does it silently. The changes over time has just made the rush style easier and encouraged vs turtling on towers and Bridges.
---
Fully expect the majority of "casual players" to outwardly shun defensive play.
---
Give this person a cookie.
---
Where is john travolta when you need him...
---
It's not subtle, but you get the point. The way SoC behaves means it's not sufficient to just say "there's a chance on melee hit to do 70% extra damage as Holy".
---
Weapon skills are good in PvE because they reduce the glancing blow reduction.
---
Weapon skills are barely useful in PvP because it's just 0.04% (while that rogue still dodges every other attack).
---
How many guilds are doing naxx with 1 tank?
---
Mark of Tyranny mandatory, it will never be replaced. Smoking heart is an excellent 2nd trinket that will last a good amount of time.
---
Go read the server forums from 2005.  It was always a toxic mess.
---
I hear you; but you and I know this isn‚Äôt true. You‚Äôd play beta hardcore and you‚Äôd roll into classic hardcore it‚Äôs crack man. You‚Äôre back on it.
---
No thanks, I liked TBC as it was.
---
These were also at the border to Western Plaguelands back in the beta. I remember they had a few infernals or something similar that would kill you if you got too close.
---
If you don't want to tank play as a arms warrior
---
*pvp bombs an in-game funeral*
---
Cata raids and dungeons were fucking awesome design and (mostly) lorewise. I didn't like how it changed many zones of azeroth but twilight highlands, hyjal, and (aesthetically) deepholm were cool zones.
---
There were some major issues with the expansion and it really set wow on a downward spiral mechanic-wise but I had a lot of fun with it
---
If you plan on leveling engineering or BS, you can stash mats on an alt or two. Also affords the space to save thick and rugged leather, or iron, mithril, thorium for when the economy picks up, if you choose to sell. If you can go without selling to vendors, the pay offs can be worthwhile.
---
A fan of undead too, as a caster player their casting animations are top tier
---
I‚Äôm just reading the tooltip man. 
---
‚ÄúGives the Paladin a chance to deal additional Holy damage equal to 70% of normal weapon damage.‚Äù
---
Oh, Pepitoz was a year before Wrath. Did not know the exact time and it had been a few years since I had last seen it.
---
As long as they add playable Goblins before the 3rd expansion, I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
The problem is: it's *never* going to be even close to the pure vanilla virgin experience because it is not a single player game. He may not have the knowledge, but big chunk of the server population will know a lot about the game.
---
Yeah I had two Gnome Rogues, this one and one before this; I guess I got the timelines of when I played each a little twisted. I thought they might be well received here; didn't much consider the whole TBC aspect. I guess I was thinking it wasn't that important in regards to the level 19 bracket, as not much changed aside from leg kits and a few other small buffs n such.
---
Anyways glad you enjoyed, thanks sir.
---
Thanks man!  
---
If there is something I've learned after a year of working on this guide is that having alternative lists is essential, my aim was to provide:
---
1) "Ultimate" BiS lists
---
2) Alternative items that are still strong but easier to get
---
So far I'm pretty satisfied with the result and I think people are too.
---
play mage
---
Youtube was not a thing in vanilla.
---
A corpse fucking a corpse.  Live to win baybee!
---
Yes, and that tooltip is misleading, which is why OP made this thread.
---
We did kill Thrall and Vol'Jin in Vanilla, but never the others since the point was sending a message and nobody was in TB or UC.
---
Warriors are terribly gear dependent. If you look at a warrior in greens, they are garbage, beaten by anyone. Once they start to gear up, they become gods of war, literally smashing everyone in pvp or PVE.
---
i tried a human warrior during the stress test, a 3.8dps gladius would have been a miracle. i was aggroing 2 mobs at a time just to get some extra rage, and since i have this shield i might as well use it
---
&gt; It was possible to do this back in vanilla
---
But no one did it back then, right? I don't see a reason for them enabling it then, makes it less authentic.
---
Okay but the whole point is literally to force streamers to stop playing on those servers, that's harassment. And honestly it doesn't even matter because your addon will never work. 
---
You think that hating on streamers is the popular opinion, but in reality 90% of people **dont care** about streamers. If anything, your addon is gonna make every other non-streamer player leave the server because of it's absurd toxicity. Also if a big streamer plays on your server, that persons fans are gonna also flock to that server, making it a pro-streamer server which will completely make your addon irrelevant and outnumbered. Like, dude, stop trying this, it's not gonna work. You've become what you hate but worse.
---
I'm at a point where I can only decide on which class I will raid on.
---
I'm going to level just every class to 60.  Some will be for professions, some to farm with, getting a lock for summoning assists, mage for portals from Kargath, etc.
---
Release classic and then fix retail. I would prefer them release new content not remaster stuff from 12 years ago.
---
It's legit washed each time I wear it haha. Why do you think it's so frayed? Last time I wore it was BfA launch.
---
Recovered this using the WayBack Machine on our guild's old website. Also in the bank screenshot: 8/8 Tier 2 with ZG enchants, Drakefire Amulet, Diary of Weavil!
---
Down voted for constructive criticism. 
---
What a sad world...
---
Thanks Man! It's been so long, can't believe people remember :). Glad to know I helped, I loved my druid and wanted to share how great the class was. I'm rolling druid again, how about you?
---
The fact that they have almost as many warlocks on alliance as druids is kinda amusing.   
---
It seems people tend to shy away from alliance warlock, maybe due to UD racial?
---
 .
---
Ehhh no. You can still win sure, but you lose more than you win  if everything else is equal.
---
If only we were able to document this as extra curricular reading and comprehension.
---
Thanks for the information. The way you presented it is really user friendly. I just wanted to let you know of a typo. Under the stages tab it says Dire Maul North three times instead of East, West, and North. Keep up the good work!
---
just to be fair warlock is much higher up on horde than alliance
---
r/classicwowplus
---
Thanks.
---
Well in the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter because ret damage will be low and the functionality of SoC won‚Äôt matter either way.
---
The Judgement set is probably my favorite set from Classic, and definitely my favorite for Paladins. I'd roll a Paladin just to get it, but that'd mean being relegated to heals in raids, which I'm not great at.
---
I mean, it might be easy to fix. Could just be a dead PSU, dead GPU, etc. I'd go to r/buildapc and give more details, see if they can help. Might be a cheap fix, no need for a full $1,500 replacement necessarily.
---
Thanks man!
---
Somebody also noticed it but I had time to fix the issue before you posted your message LOL, thanks for the report though they help the document a lot!

His parents down stairs listening to the chaos coming from his bedroom arguing which one of them is responsible for making him like this.
---
Hot take... 3 months in? Sure...
---
6 months in? Probably not.
---
Source: Any game that ever launched with hype.
---
Cool post but your account gives it away lol
---
As a horde player during vanilla, I remember hearing they were doing a balance patch for AV, and was briefly excited. Because even in those days, it  pretty universally recognized that alliance seemed to have an AV advantage.
---
Opened the patch notes to see they were.... moving the horde graveyard further South.
---
Appreciate your opinion but mine is they should go ahead with TBC which was amazing on its own right
---
I hope people will stick to the, go to the last boss meta , I really don't want to re-live 10+ hours AV
---
Circumventing blizzard trying to remove your addon is.
---
A lot more mages and priests will probably ding 60 by soloing DM lashers than we did in classic.
---
Don't expect a summon. 
---
Ask where to go and mention it's your first time through.
---
Don't be lazy and you'll be in a great position to make friendly acquaintance and not enemies.
---
I'd play it.
---
I call it "fisting a dead night elf".
---
I didn't see it, do you by chance have a source?
---
Not having beta is a blessing, August will come soon enough.
---
That's how I've always felt about betas, even for the expansions. I don't like putting the time into sometimes if I don't get to keep it. Sure it would help find bugs/stress test but just not my thing.
---
Lmao 
---
XEllimistx : If I got beta I wouldn't play it
---
/R/ClassicWoW : Excuse me what the fuck
---
You understand Adderall and Riddlin is 100% identical chemical composition to Methamphetamine right? I thought  people knew this?
---
Blizzard has never once taken action against a player for something allowed in-game simply because they have a specific reason for doing it or are doing it at scale.
---
We really don't care what you think of us, we just want what we want and are inviting others to join us if they want the same. There are PLENTY of people that do not want anything to do with streamers, as evidenced by the constant posts and comments on this subreddit.
---
More importantly, one of our members has been going around to various streams and instigating a conversation about this thread. Almost every streamer we want to avoid has said this would be sufficient to prevent them from wanting to play on our server.
---
Asmon is that you?
---
The bugs, especially such immersion-breaking ones, need to be pointed out and stressed. Otherwise, Blizz see that people don't care and put a lower priority to fixing such bugs.
---
The weak should (not) Fear the strong.
---
No it isn't, which is why Blizzard doesn't use this method anymore. They simply limit the API to prevent addons they consider against the EULA. That won't work for a Classic LFG addon and it won't work for ours.
---
What people don't see now, but will happen is the eliteism of classic. Sure the leveling will be fun and nostalgic and everyone is going to be helping each other out and all that good stuff. But there will come a time when the elitists will rain supreme in both pvp and pve. They will be the upper % that assemble 40 man raids and weekly farm the top tier raids and have access to the best gear. I don't think people remember how much gear has to say in plassic pvp. You could literally one shot people if you had the right gear.
---
I think the whole nostalgia trip will turn more and more sour the longer classic is out and people will stop looking at the inconveniences as cute and something that makes the game fun and start to see it for what they are, inconveniences.
---
A new game you enjoy will always be fun, especially a mmo with a community, but I agree with the op. I'm sorry if I sound depressing, but I played classic when it came out and I loved it, but I also remember how the eliteism ruined a lot of aspects of the game for me and I can only imagine what an eternal classic version will turn into.
---
Ride your hype train all the way to 60 and then watch the backs of that small % of no lifers as they teabag you in ab with their bwl gear.
---
Thank you for this post. It increases the chances that the layering will be fixed/improved and we won't see such bullshit on actual launch.
---
I have my own opinion on how difficult the endgame content should be, but I think that's almost an entirely separate subject. Generally, I think the main problem is the easy "catch up gear" that drops in later patches. People should never feel like there's an easy way to skip content just because it's 12 months old. If you don't have the gear from naxx, there's no way in hell you're to survive icecrown. There shouldn't be an Argent Crusade shortcut. Your subbed to play the game...so play...the game.
---
In my head, endgame content should feel like hiking to the top of a peak. You can take the long way which is a relatively manageable incline, and I do mean Looooonnnnggggg way. Or you can take the steep incline which is faster, but a great deal more punishing.
---
Like you could spend weeks grinding out gear with shadow and frost resistance gear, which makes you first raid a relatively easy time in the actual raid, or you can go into ice crown with no magical resistance gear and get an achievement for success if you have reflexes like a cat and can dodge all the instant kill frost dmg. Certain gear and mounts might only drop for raid groups where all players involved have no magic resistance gear.
---
There should essentially be two different types of endgame is what I'm saying.
---
Wait was this the summoning stone LFG tool that failed miserably??
---
As a warrior dont shy away from using staffs early on.
---
To calculate DPS, use the formula: (Weapon DPS + AP/14) * Weapon Speed
---
You'll be surprised at how much better staffs can be early game.
---
Ppfffff, lol.

You CAN but lets be real... the real question is "why am i concerned about tanking" "i am afraid of other people judging/criticising me?" "i think im not good enough?" address those inner concerns then youll love tanking and people will love you Cos youre tanking, erry group needs one:)
---
Go to options, check auto self cast. No need for that macro
---
Definitely excited to be in one this, the barrens chat is legendary
---
Just curious on your stance -- Are you following Joana's guide on launch? And are you going single target build due to the masses, or pushing to get a couple zones ahead and go the AoE build?
---
Being able to understand all your spells is relevant, regardless of whether you think they're useful or not. Almost every Paladin levels as Ret, which makes understanding Ret spells important.
---
Compared to the speed-levelers who will be trying to set a new world's record for the shortest time to 60, that's moderate.
---
I am serious... And don't call me Shirley

*Looks at camera*

Airplane.

In PvE servers you mean? In PvP servers you can pvp in all contested zones, in PvE its just those people that are willingly tagged. The gurubashi arena is the only PvP areana floor is the only area that will tag you in game (except for battlegrounds, which they do have access to yeah)
---
There is a really good hybrid leveling spec that I use. It's 0/30/21 that uses HOTW in the feral tree to buff all of your base stats depending on your form but you also get nature's swiftness in the resto tree. What I really like about this build is while it really focuses on the 2 talents there are some really useful talents before these that you can take to cater to your play style. Also if you do plan on raid healing this spec tends to be good enough until AQ assuming your guild isn't pushing for speed clears.
---
On a gryphon now, will report back (for real this time).
---
We went into hyjal one night, probably a dozen of us. The officers all had each other account info for guild bank needs, so we logged our MT on, summoned him to the bottom of the well of eternity deleted his hearthstone and logged him out without water breathing. I think we mailed him 50g for the repairs and shit, but nothing was better than when he logged on the next day, confusion, then anger, followed by laughter. It was pretty great
---
Not everything about multiboxing is about getting gold etc. Some people play it for the added challenge.
---
I just wanted beta to get a taste of what's to come. Understanding that I'd not keep any progress is enough for me to not want to play too seriously.
---
This! In my humble this wholesome/nostalgia community will just last till the first wave of players hit Level 60 and the end content and everyone wants his stuff as fast as possible.
---
I remember when we started doing AQ 40 I got a new very high end monitor and all of my friends were really envious of how much I could see on it.
---
That's just wrong completely. With software or scripts, you can easily have multiple wow windows running at w/e resolution you like at w/e window size you want.
---
This is gold!
---
Haha yeah same for me. I was lucky enough to have one functioning PC, let alone one with TWO monitors
---
My account was made specifically to make certain comments on this sub and announce our intentions in this thread without giving our name or the names of our affiliates away as we receive feedback and criticism of the mission.
---
I stopped raiding when MoP came and he is definitely one of the best bosses ever made (from vanilla to end of cata obv). Killing him pre-nerf felt better than killing Deathwing(s).
---
The world needs to feel alive, running into the same players again and again. From your server. Sharding DOES NOT provide that whatsoever.
---
Seems like, if they were chemically identical, then they'd be, you know, the same. But people I know on adderall/ritalin dont act like meth heads so slash shrug?
---
Fawa, did you play a tauren druid on perenolde in  vanilla?
---
No, tons of unit frame addons had a focus target frame you could use.  Its what made blizz add it to the default ui in the first place.
---
If you said anything else I wouldn't believe youd actually eaten a hot pocket.
---
Yeah just ignore wow until classic.
---
Plenty of other things to do for the next 70 something days :)
---
There are plenty of people that plan to reserve the same name across multiple servers. This really wouldn't help.
---
T2 is best tier ever made. You may think differently. And it is okay to be wrong sometimes. These need to be a poster like the dc justice league one done in the same art style.
---
Your microwave is a potato
---
Some is a big understatement
---
Do you realize you‚Äôre replying to a 4 months old post?
---
Ass pain from sitting too long is my arch enemy.  I don't have standing desk :( so I have to settle for standing during flight paths and longass runs through the Barrens.  I'll have to log out for walks once in a while and build up 2 or 3 kills worth of blue.
---
Alliance. Yes. Because there aren't Forsaken Elves.
---
Unless they just flat out cheat on you one day... then there‚Äôs just one reason.
---
Yah the reason James states in the guide is because of the amount of work to take into account the different racial starting zones.
---
&gt;I like both factions, both models, both sets of racials and so on. 
---
Then I can't think of any factor that would allow me to help you to make the decision.
---
Actually, there is one: Horde raids want a lot of shamans, ideally 8 so they buff each group. Alliance raids want a lot of paladins, but like 5 is already fine, giving slightly more room for a druid.
---
I don't know why I keep thinking it's several months away - probably because I haven't been this excited for a game in years. My wife and I are looking at houses with a realtor tomorrow so the time should pass by pretty quickly with all the "fun" involved in buying a house. Hopefully we find one we like tomorrow so we can be moved in by middle of July.
---
Of course they thinking about that papa :)
---
They don't want to deal with a ton of dead servers and having to merge servers after layering is removed (even though they will have to)
---
The best part is they have plenty of time until bgs open to get it sorted, yeah honor system is in p2 but growing pains.
---
That‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre afraid of it.
---
Three? There's five and Sinestra definitely was pretty great fight.
---
I started to make my own route but I'm not done yet, so far I followed Joana guide and modified it to suit "my character" if that makes sense.
---
I think people should expect not being able to get the AoE spots for themselves, so I'd suggest to go full single target spec and respec for AoE farming later on if you're 100% sure that you'll get the spots for yourself.
---
Report it as a bug if you can‚Äôt! Finding secret areas is a huge part of vanilla!!
---
Me to back in the day
---
Got a 30 day ban lol
---
RP-PvP servers used to be full of WPvP even during the later expansions and faction balance was pretty equal, so I‚Äôm definitely going to roll on one of them.
---
Orc shaman first, if I make an alt, it will be something undead
---
Dormammu, I‚Äôve Come To Bargain!
---
Eh don‚Äôt let these people who say ‚Äútrust me i played since 2004‚Äù convince you of anything cause back then no one knew shit. Notice how none of the original vanilla screenshots have proper keybimgs? Rogues are indeed one of the slowest/hardest lvlers in vanilla
---
It works the same as opposing faction stealth. You'll see them if you're close enough.
---
Appreciate the input! I mostly agree with almost everything you said. 
---
For PVE - For sure, they are not the most efficient healers, or have the most throughput. But they can save situations, Swiftmend, NS, battlerez, innervate, etc. Again, I would argue that healing efficiency isn't their job. They should supplement the key healers and provide topoffs with HOTs so the efficient healers don't use their cast timers/gcd. 
---
For BGs, druids and priest/paladins have very separate differences for PvP healing. While druids get beat by purge, they don't lose to counterspells. 
---
Only a few classes have dispell, while almost everyone has a interrupt.
---
Druids also have the ability to bait the Mana/gcd of the key dispellers. I would consistently throw out rank 1 rejuvs to keep priests/shams purges busy - while also keeping my Mana pool higher and burning theirs. Druids can also safeguard their Mana pool from Mana burn/drain mana/viper sting, something no other class can do.
---
You mention how purges hurt HoTs - but think of how the other healers suffer. Priests bubble, gone. Blessing of freedom? Gone. Try to cast? Interrupt. If you're alliance, it's worse with Earth Shock every few seconds. If you're tossing out HoTs and the sham/priest purges them, then they won't have the gcd to hurt anyone else. Druids are hurt, sure, but a root + walk away, or simply travel form to outrun means you can Swiftmend, cat+stealth, etc.  
---
As a Druid, I always felt in control of fights. I was the one moving, making my opponents react to me, my positioning, and my actions.  Feral charge the heals, Faerie fire the rogues, root the warriors, bait purges on me, Nature Swiftness Hibernate the ghost wolf shaman who is trying to keep pace with my travel form. 
---
Druids aren't a replacement for paladins or priests (or shams). They're not a healer, but they heal.  They're something different :).
---
I've been really stuck. The most fun I've had has been playing druid. I've been thinking mage this time just because it'll be easier all around. 
---
But this brings me back to my love for the class. I always pvpd, and while druids aren't the best wombo class to make highlights on. They make a difference and win games. 
---
I never liked healing so I don't think I'll go resto. But most likely a feral resto hybrid. For flag carries, kiting and just being the old annoying druid I remember playing. 
---
And the pvp gear looks sick on tauren
---
You can, you just wont be a 'strong' healer in raids for very serious raiding guilds.  
---
It always boils down to how much time you are willing/wanting to raid.  If you are going to join a casual or semi casual guild, then you have absolutely no worries what so ever.
---
Fun with buying a house... sounds like you got a timeline to rush now lol!
---
It will be a blast for anyone playing vanilla for the first time - but it is guaranteed to be frustrating, so just fight through those times and you'll have a blast.
---
Correct. This is exactly what I‚Äôm referring to. Also Hyjal and Ironforge Airport and the Darkshore troll village. All should be accessible üëç (if not please report as a bug)
---
I think it's a fun idea that of course will never be reality. Not sure why OP gets so many angry no's.
---
Haha yeah. I'm not a Soda hater, but found it so hypocritical when he'd rage at other streamers for challenging him for it (Soni for instance)
---
Go check out Joanas guide, he would step away for real meals, and sleep at least 6 hours a night and still *crush* any competition 1-60 not only in real time, but just destroying their /played as well.
---
The only people who think binging 30+ hours straight is going to do them any favors are idiots.
---
Source:  Used to do the 30+ hour binges on expansion releases.  Still didn't keep up with the people who were just better at leveling.
---
Really! Thanks for the info, there is still the steep 10s price at early levels though lol.
---
Yes it's because ud racial on a pvp server. On the flipside warlock is much better on alliance with pally buffs, and in pvp with pally support (and no enemy pally dispels) so it's not a huge difference.
---
literally BS and WW on CD.
---
Hc strike if you have shit tons of extra rage to avoid capping 
---
(If Horde spam hamstring for WF procs)
---
When you can execute - thats all you spam. 
---
fury warrior lesson over.
---
Orc for both pvp and pve for horde 
---
Human for 100% only pve 
---
Or gnome for a mix.
---
Plus walking.  Lots and lots of walking.  It definitely increases activity in the intestines and bowels.  During a 1 hour walk I often turn into a fart machine and a nice, satisfying poop usually isn't far behind.
---
Was it used in PvP too?
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Sometimes, but often you can apply the same logic - people don't just flip a coin and decide to cheat one day. Usually it's just the catalyst or the result of a relationship that broke down over the years.
---
That would apply to all spells though right? So in dungeons if I cast other healing spells it'd auto cast on me?
---
Need? No. But you would be severely gimping yourself for no reason if you just decided to not take any professions.
---
You won't be able to level very effectively without first aid but you can buy food from vendor.
---
you can turn that fight from a dps race, to a tank and spank .
---
Absolutely! Great work already tho OP, keep going.
---
Only when your not targeting an ally
---
This dude *tanks*.
---
I got in but realized I'd just go too hard just to get my account reset.  Ended up letting my friend use my account until launch.
---
Last I read you can only reserve 3 names.
---
It's a lot more impactful. Best example I can give is like, in retail you can burn 3 cd rotations and you're still fighting.
---
In Classic if you do a certain misplay you can just get insta gimped. Fight's can last 10 seconds seriously. And the fun part about that is after you learn how to manage and control that you can kill multiple people by yourself and it's very satisfying.
---
I recommend you watch Vurtne's video which are actually from vanilla. And you can see what I'm talking about. If you're want something in more modern playstyle you can watch people like Greatwizard, Perplexity, Goth. I find Greatwizard's videos especially good.
---
Dwarves are dope if wasn't rolling a mage (most likely) I'd probably be on a dwarf priest or pala, fear wards for priest is op and dwarf on pala mount is extraOP
---
This could potentially happen, but i'm not sure. While I know private server players are going to be the minority throughout my time playing on pservers I very rarely encountered super toxic situations. Generally speaking the people I grouped up with for dungeons were friendly.
---
R/cursedcomments
---
As of now RP-PVP servers will not be there at launch.
---
Tired of about 98% of the posts in this subreddit now tbh. It's amazing how reddit attracts practically everyone now; it used to be a safe haven.
---
Lol wow plain flavour
---
Funny thing is, he was awakened too soon.
---
THIS is what I'm here for. Thank you.
---
Gaming on a slow ass ips monitor no thanks m8!
---
The demand for Pots or rather Elixirs is BY FAR higher then those few ppl powerleveling the Professions... as they are going through dozens of Pots per Raid per Person... remember in Vanilla there was no 'only 1 Flask OR 1 Def/Attack Elixir' so you could stack half a dozen Elixirs per try per Person and thats gonna stack to huge amounts quickly
---
I'd buy one of The Barrens. Probably not my favorite zone geographically but just so many memories. Chat was always something to behold.
---
If you choose not to tank at all until end game, then your lvl 60 learning curve is going to he extremely harsh.
---
&gt;u/Lord\_Sicarious
---
Idk if these spiders are hidden or respawning immediately but I just died at the entrance lol.
---
I think this is a cool idea and definitely worth discussing. I don't see a practical way to make L60 Vanilla content relevant at L70 without level scaling or a power boost to said L60 vanilla content; both of which would have undesirable side effects.
---
Lmfao I haven't deleted shit bucko
---
I'm at work much easier if you search it up for me, thanks homie.
---
Im lvling mage first so i am my own vendor haha all my point was that you can play perfectly fine doing nothing but lvling there will always be 1 of every profession in your guild
---
Seriously? Granted, I mostly only go on this sub when something shows up on my front page but this is the first time I've seen anything about streamers and I'm on reddit every day.
---
Your DPS sucks on boss fights.  You run out of mana and you simply can't make a decent difference when contrasted with good players.
---
That nerd tried to snipe my guild officer's lol
---
I hope you dont mind me sharing your 10 commandments with my guild hunters, this is great
---
Does every layer have its own herbs/spawns?   
---
Do you think you could make a conscious effort to 'switch layers' by joining or leaving groups?
---
Water WoW
---
I highly doubt that, maybe on the private servers full of sweaters yea but retail wow holds a hell of alot more of a variety when it comes to raiding guilds
---
Don't you guys have phones tho?
---
They should have had a closed beta focused on bug testing until about 2 weeks before launch, then let the streamers in.  WoW is going to feel very old by the time it actually releases with 3 months of nonstop streaming.
---
24 hours?!  Some of us will go for 24 DAYS without a shower after Classic releases.  World Of Stankcraft.
---
you can only reserve three names during the early access reservation period, but, there won't be a restriction once Classic releases, as far as i know.
---
The gladius is guaranteed. You buy it from the goldshire vendor, and as far as I am concerned, it's pretty much mandatory. 
---
And I wouldn't count on the shield. Shields are wierd to start. At a normal level, a shield is like twice as much armor as your chestpiece. At level 1, your starting shield is 5 armor. not 50. 5. And the one you get in goldshire for showing up is 55 armor, when a reasonable value for a level 5 shield would be more like 100+. 
---
Really, shields don't do anything until you either get lucky with a world drop, or get to about riverpaw gnoll bounty, where the first semi normal shield shows up.
---
Private servers are also wrong but keep comparing them to Vanilla. It will be fun watching heads explode.
---
This is really cool. Love seeing original content like this on here. A troll elemental shaman in tier 2 gear would look awesome in this art style.
---
The numbers are accurate. Blizzard posted something on it a while ago. Everything is the way it should be. I‚Äôm playing on the beta, and it definitely feels accurate to me.
---
Because in this video it lists shit thats gonna happen regardless... Like the first thing is it talking about competition... If you don't want competition then why even play Wow at all??? Go play BFA where you get everything handed to you. And everything else it lists its gonna happen regardless if theres a streamer on the server or not. Big streamers on servers are not that fucking big of a deal and people need to just get the fuck over it.
---
Classic damage is quite a bit lower than pservers
---
Across the board for all classes as well. I agree. Can‚Äôt wait to hunt down a set for my shaman again!
---
Heroic rag was a much better fight than tank and spank over there
---
I have died 3 times now, not able to get into the cave. Will come back at a higher level. I will say though, as I was wandering as a ghost, I never got a different location pop up, so I suspect it still remains undiscoverable.
---
Well when half of your game assets at that point in time are just directly taken from WC3, its not hard to look like Warcraft Orcs, because they literally are.
---
Lol Yeti Cave! I did the same. Went into that cave and didn't come out until I was 60.
---
It's been like that since day1 buddy! Have you ever seen rogues or druids stealth while leveling even just once? No.
---
It depends on the, let's say, receiving party in the picture is alive or not. If that NE is dead, then it'd still be necrophilia. If not, then: vitaphilia, I guess?
---
Them playing 20hours a day to hit 60 fast and having such a strong social netting they can just do groups of 2 or 3 and blaze through content and opponents wanting to PvP them.
---
On ND a group of 4 or 5 APEs leveled together as a group and just steamrolled to 60 in one big grind basically.
---
Cheeto master race rise up over the Dorito heretics!
---
how so? surely having a fully party means it will be easier wouldn't it?
---
Stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors.  Beware the moon, David.
---
&gt; And despite some brainiacs not getting it, WPvP doesn't mean "southshore battles". It means that you could be attacked at any time, anywhere in the world, that you had to fight for your right to farm, quest, or simply travel.
---
Right? I'm actually getting sick of people saying wPvP didn't exist in vanilla after AV. PvP was happening CONSTANTLY in BRM, on the roads to BRM, outside Stratholme and Scholomance, etc. Honestly, I think a lot of people who claim to have played during Classic just straight up didn't, or they played on a PvE server.
---
no one cares about specs, really, for 5-man dungeons as long as you have someone willing to tank and heal, but, the problem with DPS'ing as a Paladin is that there's nothing you can really do to increase your DPS, other then ensuring you have literally every single buff available to you 'cuz Retributions damage is an RNGfest. you'll always pretty much be last, unless literally everyone else is AFK.
---
serious, hardcore guilds won't let you in, but if you don't care about that, just find a casual guild and they should have no issues with you... just expect to be asked to heal during raids.
---
Female draenei were great for wall jumping in BC. I went fucking everywhere.
---
I will never play alliance.
---
I always level my profs with me and even take a break from leveling if I start out-leveling my profs. 
---
Actually enjoy having my profs maxed before I get to 60.
---
I would have been great for Blizz to add those helms and shoulders to the game.
---
&gt;until BC when our threat was increased and our armor multiplier skyrocketed
---
Your timing is off. They made this change in like 1.8 (or whichever patch was the Druid rework).
---
Check out Taladril's Feral Tank guide; there really wasn't much of a change between end of Vanilla and TBC. The only real change for bears was better itemization.
---
You can reserve 3 names, but they don't all have to be on the same server.
---
If I reserve my name on 3 servers and wait until launch to pick which one I'll actually play on, that artificially boosts the pre-launch census data for 2 other realms.
---
Undead Mage.
---
I don't think Blizzard bans for that.
---
Pserver is the way to go while you wait
---
Ah alright, make sense then
---
Then tell those hypocritical arseholes, that they don't get to spit on the work of people who do an actual service to the game and it's community, by demanding that something is "properly tested".
---
Going to assume that any streamer you‚Äôre watching is also more geared than any person normally would be at that level. Might not affect damage but definitely affects ease.

Judging by the music, you would think this video was from vanilla. :P
---
Blizzard already did testing on this and showed the numbers are correct. Even a handful of private servers had comparable numbers based on a youtube video some dude did with testing at various levels. Everyone just seems to think things were stronger based on their memories and there were some private servers that intentionally overbuffed everything to be harder for more of a challenge.
---
Yessss. My druid bud and I did this back when I was a dumb kid.
---
Bladethorn if you're out there. Hello!
---
A bit to much pservers for me then i guess, but good to know it's the same as it was back in the days!
---

Well most mages will be arcane-frost anyways, only guild officer mages will be heavy frost. And guild officer mages will have say in when people are allowed to switch to fire because they recruited a moonkin and power infusion priest.
---
I didn't even have anything to print, because I wasn't aware of those leveling guides. Well I probably had heard of them, but I probably thought that they were scams to get money from me.
---
Not that I mind. In hindsight I liked going my own way to 60.
---
&gt; The balance of damage to hp gets a bit silly at naxx gear level but around BWL/early AQ patch it's perfect
---
Absolutely. Tier 2 PvP was the best. Weapons like Dark Edge of Insanity from AQ started to push too far and then full blown naxx gear broke the game, but Tier 2 era PvP was the best version of vanilla PvP hands down. In fact, I've said this in other threads, once AQ opens I'm probably done with Classic because it is the beginning of the end of my enjoyment.
---
Got it, thank you!
---
you deliberately distorted one of his points and ignored every other point
---
areas of the game constantly becoming unplayable because there's 40 people following one guy around is not vanilla
---
Yessir
---
My wife says I spend too much time reading this subreddit and she's going to leave me if I don't stop refreshing every five seconds. She doesn't give a fuck that I want to avoid streamers and says it's time for me to grow up. I have to say that I understand where she is coming from since when she asked me to cook tonight I told her I hadn't levelled the skill yet and she flipped the fuck out. I think I am at a major crossroads in my relationship and my life, do I play warlock or shadow priest?
---
I upvoted both of these comments because I‚Äôm the same as the guy booking days off, and the guy saying ¬´Jesus¬ª to myself after doing it
---
How did it save your life? Were you literally on the verge of death?
---
Level 40 mounts aren‚Äôt too bad to get. Chances are you‚Äôll be pretty close by the time you get there. It‚Äôs the level 60 mounts/training that takes effort to acquire.
---
I've even seen it twice in WoTLK when people twinked at 60. So yes very rare.
---
In before Mankriks wife and Chuck Norris jokes.
---
Underrated game
---
You're posting and reading content into and exclusively from an echo chamber. What you see isn't a majority. It isn't a major fraction of the minority as most threads rarely see comment numbers above 10k where the ones that do are unique outliers.
---
Less than 1% of the people who will be playing are talking about the game through Reddit and forums.
---
You should really sort the "Potential Impact" column by... potential impact, not alphabetically.
---
Oh they know from the 9 million or so threads about sharding and layering on the official forum.
---
Not to mention they already said they are aware it's not working properly.
---
But we should still make countless threads about how the sky is falling over an unreleased game in Beta, yeah?
---
Yeah people act like Vanilla was some DOS game. It wasn't at all. Crazy how memories are shaped after 15 years
---
Nice, ran with some guys from paradosi or fatal union. Cant truly remember anymore
---
Pretty solid info as I plan on rocking a warrior w/ bsmithing/mining right from the get go. Keep us updated bud!
---
Leveling faster gives you better access to profession-based gold-making because you'll have less competition for high-end materials in high level zones, and you'll be prepared when other fresh 60's start gearing from the AH.
---
A good guild in TBC uses Bears, Prot Warriors, and Prot Pallies as needed. They each have their strengths.
---
When dueling and parties you can see them or at least could. So drop group before dueling stealthers.
---
Gotta get atleast 35 to max and a lot of trainers are in high level dungeons
---
Why
---
Nice, yeah I was in "Nappy" in Paradosi. I can remember back when george got the arcanite reaper plans and we 40man General Drak in UBRS
---
Well, after seeing that you are in one of the later EU time zones, I have to say that your schedule does not easily allow you to raid what so ever.  
---
It is possible that a guild pops up that fits what you can do, but then there is no guarantee that said guild wont be the type of guild you want (casual, serious, hardcore, etc.).  
---
Hate to say it, but I think you need to accept that your current life doesn't allow you to do this particular thing reliably.   To make things worse, you only have 2 days out of the week you are willing to raid, and 1 of them is usually a break day for most guilds (saturday).
---
There will always be another Pax. There won‚Äôt be another official wow classic launch.
---
Gotta be at least 35 iirc to get make level professions.
---
It's 80 damage, and that's a 533% increase over rank 1.
---
In comparison, the difference between rank 1 Instant Poison and the last rank you get while leveling is only a 477% damage increase.
---
Damage is damage.
---
Dormammu, I've Come To Bargin!
---
Okay... all this streamer talk went out of style since Kotaku made article about it.
---
Bro what is that circular spell addon? It‚Äôs sweet
---
I feel like Cata gets too much of the blame for the diminishing popularity of WoW. With Cata we saw a few poor things, like LFR and such, however we also started getting raids that were a challenge to complete, challenging heroic dungeon content which felt good to do at the time, some unique and interesting zones (yes, including vashj'ir as bad as it ended up being). 
---
A lot of people I've run into that are glads, multi-glads, R1 players, etc. all agree that Cata had some of the best pvp the game has ever seen in terms of arenas and BGs. 
---
Personally I think that most of the people who talk down on Cata only remember the spine fight, vashj'ir, and LFR and think to themselves "oh these three specific instances make the entire expansion bad" when in reality it was pretty solid.
---
If you want the maximum FPS on Ultra in all situations, yes, you should get the most expensive CPU you can find. But that still won't keep you above 100 FPS in all scenarios.
---
I'm doing this now as well and I'm actually enjoying it. Sometimes you just want to destroy shit with no issues you know. I'm more interested in leveling every class I can to 20 so I can get a good feel for how different it is to Classic since I haven't played either in years.
---
Your screenshot is amazing, but what‚Äôs even better than the screenshot is you calling out all the know-it-alls in the comments!
---
You have to be a fool to think Blizz doesn't care about streamers. They are one of the most crucial forms of modern game advertising, regardless of whether people know classic exists or not. There used to be commercials for milk. Its not about informing people the game exists, its about generating interest. It is absolutely a concern of Blizzard's that streamers are able to make the game look attractive, that's why they invited so many to the beta.
---
Oh wow
---
Sounds like the start of a country song.
---
&gt; Bawls. That's a throwback to 2004-6 right there!! 
---
2000-2001 for me.
---
It isn't technically BiS for warriors, and doesn't even get to experience its full potential in MC due to the fire resist mobs have.
---
Ret pallys are garbage no matter what they use. 
---
Enh shamans are garbage DPS and would be better suited to have one using nightfall than sulfuras.
---
So it all boils down to PvP potential, in which all 3 have the ability to abuse the weapon.
---
WTB classic
---
Ahhh I get no respec
---
2000+?
---
You had 'Take screenshot' on W?
---
also: recursion
---
ok
---
I'll probably keep going, I will admit that killing stuff fast is pretty fun.
---
No, no. You missunderstood. I didn't say that people care about leveling in classic now. They do though 15 years ago and Blizzard did care to make leveling long and hard enough so they have some time untill people will start hitting 60s and yell that they did run out of content.
---
You should tell her unfortunately you haven't leveled much in that profession and you aren't sure to cook her the proper foods that would give her spirit and stamina to last her through the day. As a child of the night you seem to be don't let her pull you to the light, stay versed in whatever manner of darkness you wish to do, either corruptind people with your mind magic or raining hellfire on them. Then if all else fails, take the route of mind magic and "explain" it all again.
---
Thats overwatch. Its hard to get even muted unless youre spamming the nword. You can shitpost all day in trade and be fine
---
Or just do classic.
---
Seriously??
---
Ok... except AQ is likely 10~ months away if phases are around 2-3 months each.   Enh shamans and ret pallys do horrible DPS no matter their gear, and both could be using nightfall instead (Much cheaper than making sulfuras anyway).  
---
With that said, I couldn't care less who gets it, as warriors don't really view it as an absolute BiS or anything (or shouldn't now that we know it isn't 'that' good), more of a status symbol.
---
If we want to argue over who can use it to its fullest effect at any point in the game.. then yea, warriors all the way, easily.
---
Thing is, that is assuming BRE is as broken on classic as it currently is on private servers due to the very high proc rate.  
---
If BRE is no longer BiS until naxx40, then priorities can and will change drastically.  Sulfuras might end up being BiS until cthun for 2h fury.
---
No idea. Originally lock or hunter. 
---
But I also like mage and mained it for 3 expansions in retail. 
---
Also rogue 
---
Warrior would be sick too. And I love chain running dungeons. So that makes the most sense. 
---
But also shaman. And priest. 
---
Fuck my life. I started with just lock or Hunter a month ago. Now I'm here. Thanks a lot reddit.
