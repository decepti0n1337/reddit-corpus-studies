Asmongold is hood for real.  You can't teach that.

If that's what gets them off, they have bigger problems going on in life. So no worries :D
---
Well, I know Warlocks are less played than most other classes and not many go to raids, I think. Either way you can go wrong with either class, both are fun.
---
 I seem to recall the ffxi sales system being fairly bad as well.
---
Yea this is a good idea. I’ll probably do the same.

30%-45%.

Lotta people will be lost between 19-39. That lack of fast travel really gets to some gamers. Thats fine. If they make it to their first mount IMO they're hooked.

It would end up in a stalemate if the hunter doesn't give up the opening since both players can just end up doing nothing.

There is a penalty to applied spellpower on al spells sub level 20

Uhhh

Thanks brah!

It was an example. If you want to make a list, go ahead.

That example alone is enough to show it's a shit show...

Hell the fact it's ran by Asmon and friends is enough.

I see now why wow client tooks so much space on my disk

Probably in the neighborhood of 75-85%. That's just how game releases work these days; people get bored easily and the casual crowd doesn't really get invested.

If people choose emotions over logic and get 'offended' over what people "sound like" over the internet, still in 2019...

Talisman of Binding Shard dropped in 1.3, it was only dropped one time, and was hot fixed the same day to not drop anymore.

So by yours, Hunters and Warlocks shouldn't have pets?

You're too low IQ to understand what's going on.
---
I can't help you understand it. Sorry.

I guess I’ll go back to a pserver or play Stardew Valley.

It had an enjoyable leveling grind and the server I was on at least had a pretty awesome community. Overall I miss the game :P

Yeah I’m all for authenticity but I want to play with a modern monitor, resolution, frame rate, and server speed. I *hate* the idea of having it feel super laggy so we can reproduce a couple buggy 15 year old interaction.
---
The shitty one is happening right now.
---
The REAL one with proper setup will be in 2 days by another streamer.
---

---
It's reasons like this it should be removed. If you don't like someone there's the ignore button, accessed just as easily. The only thing a right click report button does well is fight gold sellers. If you can't bother to type up a proper report to report someone you probably weren't that bothered by it anyway.
---
Again, I think you've misunderstood the argument. Time vs ability to complete the raids. I'm not saying it's as faster to bring an enhance shaman. I'm saying it's still very doable and that bringing one or two hybrid dps will not add hours to a raid time unless the raid is shit anyway. Play whatever you want man. Idgaf.
---
The Gnomeregan quests to get the teleporter and then the one that grants those nice leather pants.
---
didnt asmongold make a video talking about this and how easy it was to get suspended by abusing it,  regardless of the intent.
---
I'm inclined to believe that they would simply open the store if that were the case. They may start small, not even mounts. There was some kind of initial investment in Bliz making Classic available again. They won't simply shutter it if it leads to a player drain from retail.
---
Going to break it to you softly.  Fixes like what you ask for aren't exactly clean.  It's not like they can change one value and it works.  In all likelyhood this requires an extensive refactor of the spell system that wasn't done until 2.0 or later.
---
Same here--he's been getting my twitch prime subscription these past couple of months haha
---
Got a Holy Pally friend leveling with me. How good are hunters with them at max level?
---
Damn you weren't wrong. That rabbit hole took me to MGTOW for the first time. What a messed up mind set they all have.
---
Might as well ask this; what about requesting invites for group
---
Why don´t they preposition the duellants all across azeroth and then switch to them as duell starts? This is so ineffiecient. They port like 20 players and beat around the bush forever.
---
Because it'll be easily exploited.
---
The community should regulate itself, as it should in any good MMORPG.
---
It works in BFA because everyone is faceless and everyone shares everything, barely anyone abuses it. That's not going to be the same in Classic.

My guess is that MC will use 1.4 loot tables at launch since it doesn't really make sense to use the earlier one.

Great news!
---
That's a small sample size.  I know you arent the only ones, but even so there is no perfect system.  It may be painful to reroll but consider entire communities being completely fragmented by not being able to communicate in their native tongue save for say, 5 people.

These people have no home server.  We english speakers have so many to choose from.

Yea, your reading comprehension is off the charts. This was a fun waste of time.

how many PvE enemies do you know are worth spending viper sting on? If you are PvPing and not leveling, you are not playing right.

Cool. Be sure to go female and get pink pigtails, cuz that’s pretty rad.

He did, he said "Hi I'm Asmongold and I love World of Warcraft." Minutes later he was disconnected and put on a silence pending game master review.
---
I mean, ok, but what does that have to do with anything I said.
---
Damn that blows, its gunna be abused heavy. Gunna miss pserver world chat and its shenanigans when the PC police roll thru
---
I mained a Hunter, then Shaman for PvP rank climbing until DKs came out and I found my fav tanking class until I quit in MOP. My priest I tried to lvl still sits at lvl 20, the druid I got to 60 something from tanking dungeons in BC. My friend mained a mage for the entire time she raided in WoW and still played that character until quitting a little after Legion. The female raid lead we had was a Shaman. The all ladies WoW guild I ran with on a PvP server had every class with a warrior lead. Stop being stupid.
---
Yeah, totally torn. Was planning on horde priest but am now strongly leaning toward Druid cuz I’ve always sucked at it and have never taken it really serious, so something new in an old game. Pally buffs will be huge for Druid and horde doesn’t really have much to compensate. But...shaman purging my hots all day in pvp sucks so...ugh
---
Lol that’s not a stalemate the rogue forfeits.

It's not shit. Human priests are still better than Troll/undead in pve

It's basically like the incels, except these ones sometimes get laid and hate women even more for it, it seems
---
You do know there’s a whole version of gold shire that doesn’t require pants, right?
---
This was before they ever had any class roll outs. So no offense but I don't think that really goes with what I'm wishing they had done. The first class they added was DK's in WotLK. They already cut the class count down from before vanilla launched so they wouldn't just be starting from scratch either.
---
Yeah, they have big weapons
---
Does anyone know if South America is getting classic realms?
---
I was just looking for something like this as well.
---
This fucking blows. Its gunna murder barrens chat and get abused. Someone kills you with world buffs? Just have your raid report them and have them temp banned
---
I’m not leaving because of some bugs. What do u think we are? Children who leave the raid group after 2 wipes?
---
What about the people who had decent ping back then? It really didn't take much to have a low ping in WoW. If you just have to have high ping to replicate your personal vanilla experience then just play on a server further away. But seriously, what do you people think internet was like in 2006? Broadband had already become pretty common by then.
---
And that revamp is what Classic is running  on - now keep up. 1.12 numbers are dumped into 8.x client and server - which is why we see a myriad of bugs BECAUSE the way things are calculated have changed.
---
You're not breaking anything to me. This is literally what is causing a lot of bugs in Classic - how numbers and data are executed are different than they were. Even the FOV has changed causing the entire world to scale differently.
---
This is old news.
---
There are consequences to playing under-powered things, and one of those consequences is being less wanted. Its just how it is. 
---
But I agree that you don't need to min-max to clear stuff in a decent timeframe. I'd personally be fine with 2-3 "non-viable" things in my raid...but thats all.
---
Tipsoutbaby had a video saying it would ruin classic. I guess he wont be playing now.
---
Whichever you think looks cooler.
---
Warstomp and range are nice in all content but berserking can catch people sleeping in PvP or threat bursting in dungeons.  You also get hp regen threat from heals.  Depending on how much you want to PvP orc is a nice option for the stun resist.
---
But really, just play what you think looks cooler, you'll have more fun.
---
I think 50%, it's going to be big.  A lot of people will be retail players that don't understand why it's taking forever to level and why they die from single mobs questing.  I think it'll pick back up eventually though.
---
Only my pride tells me you're right. I would like to stick to the #nochanges as much as possible.
---
But, i cant say i enjoyed the long BG queue times from vanilla. Sometimes I'd queue for hours trying to get into an AV match on my server.
---
Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands, right?
---
3.5 GB of *anything* for free was a big deal back then
---
Do mage with friends, solo warrior and keep an eye out on things with your mage to help your warrior? Make the mage a tailor and stuff.
---
now that I think about it, it isn't even just pvp, the retail reddit guilds are typically behind trade chat pugs in terms of progression
---
something about this website attracts the extremely incapable

Or just ignore them. Where do you draw the line? Your opinion of a sick fk could very easily be too sensitive for most people, or maybe it's not sensitive enough. The point is as long as they don't threaten physical violence or dox your info they should do nothing. You can ignore them and move on with your day.

It solves everything, especially in Classic where if half the server has you on ignore you have a very hard time getting anything done.
---
How long does it take to complete it?
---
Awesome!
---
Best news to wake up to
---
Hunter is petless 1-10 though.
---
If it's going to be utilized as a flagging mechanism for further manual investigation by GMs then fine.
---
Auto-squelch (even worse auto-DC/suspend) in Vanilla is a big fat no.
---
The point of layering is to not have to do server merges. They are trying to launch with a minimum number of servers to support the long term players. I suspect after the first week there will be a lot of drop off, many tourists will have gone back to retail by then. After the first month a lot of people will leave as well as they decide they don't have enough time to play or they've gotten their fill of nostalgia.
---
It’s a nerf to Tauren hunters though. You have to be even further than other classes to be at the minimum ranged attack range.
---
Except for paying for health care before 65.
---
Lol blast from the past
---
I'm sorry that you're disappointed. But I prefer spell batching to remain.
---
No. I had a great time back then, but that was then. I want to hang with in game friends, etc, but beyond that I’m gonna try to do something totally new.

If only mages had another spell that rooted or slowed the target. With out blizzard they will never be able to snare some one! RIP mages. /s

First time I've heard this FarQ guy talk. Should be running for president... That was the most tasteful and respectful rebuttal to world buffs critiques I think could've come out of the conversation. Another awesome podcast.

They asked to be layered into the tournament.

As a main tank, maybe. 
---
I'm rolling a mage, so I'm expecting 7-9 in any 40 man guild raid.

Serious PvPers won't be playing Classic. They'd be on Retail.
---
Spell batching interactions are pretty important in vanilla pvp
---
Vanilla open beta felt a lot more like a hype machine (a very successful one) and it made the most sense since they didn't have a game for people to play yet.  IE those in Vanilla were already hyped for BC without getting into a beta because they were currently playing the game.  But of course Vanilla was limited to the closed beta and whispered hype for the game (many less videos back then!) so when the very interesting game opened up to all there was a flood of people that would then join at launch and really because of open beta launch was insane because hype had gotten larger than they anticipated from the success of closed/open betas.
---
I fell like this is the reason Garrisons were so shitty. They always hated on player housing and never wanted to do it. Then they did and it was terrible so now they have an excuse to never touch it again.
---
You’re suggesting changing the mentality from always be improving to what exactly? Never improve and play anything? And that’s how you’re going to down razoregore? The post seems entirely self contradictory.
---
1) Have you found a guild?  
---
2) Would you be opposed to rolling Alliance?
---
Druid can OT just fine up til like twin emps, gets shaky after that
---
&gt; That seems like a decision for Blizzard to make after they receive a report
---
It's an automated system. You still get silenced for literally anything as long as enough people report you, it's also cumulative so it doesn't even have to be the same thing you got reported for each time. They may take it off when they see it's nothing but you're still penalized that entire time until then.
---
The police don't arrest you and take your license away before looking at the tape to see if you actually sped through the school zone.
---
Oh, god. There's a picture of a half naked nightelf. Look at her large breasts. Blizzard was very naughty back then.
---
Ferals druids are pretty good tanks as well tbh.  You're not going to main tank in raids though.  That's definitely going to be a warrior.  Maybe offtank though. my guild used a feral druid as our number 3 tank through AQ40.  Any 5 mans from level 18 and up to 60, even UBRS, are easily tankable by a bear.
---
Because it has to be 2 letters. Thems the rules brother.
---
yes for all content anyway
---
Druids are pretty good but... just not quite there

Pallys have not taunt and mana issues but are good at AOE tanking

I don't know exactly how Gouge should work but it's actually not a melee ability, it has a range longer than melee in the tooltip, so I'm not so sure melee leeway is affecting it.

BLIZZ YOU HAD A SLAM DUNK WTF ARE YOU DOING?

---
It's an automated system. It's like getting arrested before the judge and jury review your case to see that no you actually didn't do anything wrong. You're still silenced for the time before the review. Meaning any small guild could mass report you, get you auto silenced over nothing while you can't talk for a few hours because no one at Blizzard has the time to review all the masses of reports constantly coming in.
---
&gt; Get them the fuck out of the community if they can’t change their toxic ass behavior.

It's ironic how toxic you actually sound saying that.

Hah! Man that would get extremely annoying really fast. No, RP and raiding are completely separate activities. I think I've done one or two dungeons while RPing but never a raid. 
---
The last RP/raid guild I was in had a set night for RP where nothing else was scheduled. Raid nights were separate. Even in that guild though there were only a handful of people who showed up for everything.
---
Guy is just funny and plain entertaining to watch. Also laugh is contagious too, that doesn’t hurt either.
---
Night elves should have been their own faction, not necessarily neutral as in it could be on either side.  
---
In the "dream" WoW I think it would have been cool to have nelves/cenarions (i.e. dryads) as a faction, Belves/Naga as a faction, and Forsaken as a faction.  Then the Horde and Alliance.
---
There is a case to be made for druids as tanks I think there is 5 bosses they can't tank in the whole of vanilla and there are a couple of bosses that a druid do better. Tanking as a druid requires alot of farming tho (pummelers) and alot of knowledge about your class
---
Simply stated an observation after watching a hundred episodes of Preach reading people stories. Most of girls who sent the stories were priests or druids, not all, but most.

I use opposite faction as mob bait so I can run past.

Except that doesn't happen and they don't ban people for abusing the feature, its a common way of targeting streamers on live. Keep trying though. I especially like the part where you had no idea how the system actually worked and just shoe horned in some random private server hate.

It's funny.  You almost need to go holy to get consecration before you put points into prot.  Then gotta keep that 5 minute buff of salvation up at all times.  I've seen like 3 or 4 pally tanks on vanilla that were good. It only lasts up to lvl 60 dungeons.  Then they're only useful in undead dungeons (Scholo/UD Strat) then.
---
Aw snap, that means I get healed for 500 whenever I Vanish!
---
I mean...Blizzard servers were never going to be the same as private servers, regardless of how many clicks it takes to report someone. Blizzard is a global company with a public image and a strict Terms of Service. Private servers don't have the same considerations.

Oh yea?  What's wrong with him smart guy?

Oh yeah I've found a couple, but so far they've all been raiding guilds that are just on a RP server.

I'm not necessarily looking for a guild, just curious if there were others out there like me who like both.
---
Ganking is all well and good, but I gotta say I'll never forget the time a 60 from the other faction helped me kill an elite I was struggling with.

I've always preferred those kind of interactions, personally. Thanks again bro!
---
Deadzone is usually exploited when the hunter is slowed or rooted, in which case leeway will not be applied.
---
&gt; I simply don't care about other solutions.
---
Well I'm going to ignore you then because you obviously have nothing to add to this conversation.
---
&gt; WOW is a public space, and should be considered as such.
---
Hate speech is protected speech in a public place. You don't have the right to throw rocks at someone in public because you don't like what they're saying. In the United States we have the first amendment for a reason, because the idea of 'toxicity' is so highly subjective from person to person it can't be measured. So as a US company Blizzard should regulate their public space as any other public space would be regulated, not their own rules of what toxic is.
---
Compared to private server levels of OP? Yea
---
But the general bugs around them is concerning.
---
Did someone do that to beat his original record?
---
Find a different guild, whats the huge rush? You won't be getting world first at that rate, we'll have a ton of time in MC before BWL. 
---
Playing 10 hours a day for a month is a REAL good way to burnout quick.
---
Feral druids aren't that far off if you gear them well. I follow a streamer who clears Naxx on his pserver every week as a raidleading feral bear tank.
---
Tell that to BRD, AQ20, AQ40, Srat, Scholo, BWL, Onyxia, RFC, SFK, Stocks, Gnomer, RFK, Mara, Ulda, LBRS, and UBRS.
---
If we get into this line of thought though we need to buff all the raid encounters because vanilla was seen as difficult for most people due to inexperience / lag / less information. We won't have the same difficulty experience we did in vanilla so we would have to buff everything up to 2019 modern difficulty standards and change the encounters so we don't just go in knowing everything that will happen. Otherwise blizzard is knowingly changing the challenge of the game by not accounting for our modern skill levels and knowledge.
---
Have they fixed leeway?
---
I think you are misinterpreting why Blizzard is releasing Classic. They know that retail is dying and they know that Classic is popular, the current devs just dont know *why* either of these things are happening. Classic will make them money and it will bring back a lot of players that have quit over the years and even some new blood, I've no doubt the staged release schedule is partly to give them enough time to figure out why people are so keen to go back to a 15 year old game.
---
This is more than likely the beginning of a new development cycle for the game, probably after testing BC and WotLK servers to guage public opinion. They are not going to sabotage it, this is Bizzards lifeline, without a resurgence of Classic wow the company is bankrupt and nothing more than a victim of Activisions corporate vampyrism. The popularity of Classic WoW is something they can hold up to Activisions management and tell them to get fucked when they try to force the mechanics that killed retail back into the game.

Mage or Warrior are both good. Mage because it makes aoe grinding very easy between consecration, blizzard and shields. Also having a water buddy helps the pally's recovery speed and blessing of wisdom helps mage sustain, so less downtime. Warrior because any time they get a healer they become much easier. Both combos are great for forming the core of dungeon groups as well.
---
I have a way of naming my characters that if I don't get them all, it doesn't matter. 3 won't help me :(
---
When I played WoW for the first time my ancient PC was still running Windows 2000.
---
I played in vanilla to half of BC with 1k ping. Moved to a location with 60 ping, it was life changing.
---
Holy crap you’re genius. How did I never think of this?
---
NOW is the season of the melee hunter. We will use your leeway against you, melee classes! Brb making a tauren melee hunter.
---
Teleport/portal are the only spells whose level requirements have never changed.
---
He has 10kish subs? That's about 30 grand a month just off twitch subs + sponsorships and other aves of revenue such as YouTube. Probably close. I'd guess 400+ right now. The ok only real high six figs are probably asmon and soda
---
I'd feel guilty of taking the glory from my lowbros.
---
what Abbott American servers?
---
Cool, I'll look more into it. I'm more concerned about my two friends loving the game than what I play as, I'd love to have some IRL friends get as into the game as I am. They are both big social gamers and love RPGs but fail to stick at games for more than a few months at a time, except PUBG and total war for some reason.
---
Aww...I see you looked through my history. Go ahead and say whatever you want. IDFC
---
Make sure everyone lets warriors get charge off too plz. Mages should probably be able to start duels with a polymorph while we’re at it
---
My arguments have only ever been in attempt to understand Blizzard's decisions or to predict the decisions they were so silent on (until today). I never argued that Blizzard was *right* to disregard language-specific realms, I just argued the reasons why they chose to. And then I used that basis to argue that Blizzard wouldn't be giving Oceania any servers.
---
The arguments are still sound, they're just irrelevant now because Blizzard changed its mind.
---
Yeah, I think that's the best way to look at things. I'm not too hopeful for the future, but I will enjoy it while it's here!
---
The shipping cost for practically everything is just so high... The lowest I've seen anything (shipped to Massachusetts) was like $50 with the bigger items being over $200 -$300. It's all still tempting though
---
I am not sure if anyone mentioned it yet, but didn't they also quote spell batching as the reason why the Classic client doesn't lag to high heavens with a whole bunch of people on the screen when compared to BFA?
---
REDUCE THE WINDOW ALREADY, IT'S SHIT.

HA! I’m tied with the world’s fastest leveler for level 1!

Actually I didn't. But what's scary is you are what you hate since Nazis were socialists. The irony is so thick
---
Oh boy !!!!  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGRZpzie2vc

we are guessing around 70%

Or the gnome named Biter.
---
Second chance because we all started out playing vanilla together.
---
I'm not responding to this in a post that has nothing to do with it. Go bait someone else.
---
/r/EsfandTV
---
So all physical damage and even some casters are going to lose fights due to server enforced simulated lag.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When this tilts you as it will. Make as much noise as you can so blizzard reverts this moronic idea for leeway.
---
Respond to me in PM's IDC. You can't change literal facts.
---
I thought I can cast blizzard while mounted and summon 3 water elementals that tank for me like the Archmage in WC3
---
[deleted]
---
We are in the exact same situation my dude
---
And there it is, the nazi buzzword. What a way to invalidate your argument. Maybe they should just remove chat entirely, that'd stop those mean trade chat "nazis"
---
Oh so true “dude I had 50 ping why am I lagging”........ it’s all about becoming one with the lag
---
Haha what a pathetic reply, no not everyone cleared even close to what I did, everyone can and does on the private servers though, in less than an hour too (17 min MC anyone?) 
---
100 is nothing when the raids are fucking easy and clearable by all. 
---
You have nothing, fucking trash.
---
I like your tinfoil hat
---
The person fighting the hunter will be moving which does effect leeway.
---
Not yet.
---
Clip?
---
Uh, Retail PvP is terrible right now.
---
You're dumber than a box of rocks. Seriously. Reread this whole exchange and watch how you keep altering your argument every time I respond.
---
Holy shit guy you went from timing it based on your opponent's actions to trying to use my own argument I made as if it is your own.
---
Holy fucking shit you're brainless. A literal fucking zombie. 
---
Fucking cringe, holy shit.
---
Picking shaman so my choice is made for me. If I wasn't sold on that class I'd probably be Alliance this time.
---
yeah, but blizz has always been very lax when it came to moderation. a couple salty people with auto report makes it too easy
---
&gt; decide they don't like you.
---
Maybe apply yourself and try to be a person worth liking, then? And as for my “Banner of Wokeness”, which is actually a fantastic name that I’ll use from now on, I have nothing to prove to people like you. People who would rather let shitty behavior fester and just turn a blind eye... that’s just shitty behavior in of itself. My goal is to help curate the community and make it one to be proud of, I’m not willing to tolerate the intolerant and bigoted. Look up the paradox of tolerance some time, it’s an interesting thought experiment.
---
If you genuinely, truly, in your heart of hearts think this will be abused against the average joe because for no reason at all, then I don’t feel this is worth debating further. You’re closed minded and have made it very clear that your only fear with this system is that your poor behavior will be punished. Ease of stopping abuse far outweighs the fringe cases of someone abusing the system and not then being punished for abusing it. Think you were unfairly reported? Appeal it. I have a feeling you do deserve the report though. Have a nice rest of your day.
---
Race to 60, so you can terrorize players in STV.
---
0/10
---
Because you don't blind or sheep on a druid or hunter &gt;.&gt;
---
Even bleeding edge guilds want a few druids in the mix. Nobody can replace innervate, b-rez, motw, thorns, and the longivity healing that druids pull off. (We're really REALLY mana efficient just not super tank healing)
---
Keep in mind the gouge would have been cast up to .5 of a second before hand meaning in that .5 seconds both targets would have moved some distance for a total of 1second of walking time total that alone would give a similar extra range to a similar level to leeway
---
For like a month Spell Batching was the number one talked about issue and half the sub was ready to die on that hill. Not to mention all the YouTube videos.
---
i'm not sure. you'd have to find footage of blizzard from 1.12 to prove
---
What part of go bait someone else is not sinking in?
---
Blue post today confirmed exactly everything I wrote here, and how my experience in BC was unique due to my low ping and very high end PC. 
---
Ez clap tbh
---
C'mon dude he seems like a nice guy
---
Perception is very meh, not something to even consider.
---
Stoneform is really good with its niche uses. Pve and pvp
---
From my understanding. Sword and mace spec are more beneficial if you want to tank or do dmg from infront of the boss. No use in pvp
---
Spirit is meh at best even as a healer. 
---
The extra rep is nice. Say it takes 10 hrs of mob grinding to get exhalted you only need to do 9. So mehish. 
---
Treasure finder and frost resist are both rpg flair things. 
---
Thats my input anyway.
---
Theres a big wide world out there, You're sounding very small minded.
---
It's super interesting that you think you know my prior position on the melee leeway issue since I've literally never posted anything about it anywhere. But sure I'm definitely moving the goal posts away from where you put them.
---
\^.\^'
---
Gotcha, appreciate it.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that the wrongly scaled druid base damage may attribute to better performance in raids for both dps and tanking.
---
Its still unproven that the damage scaling is off at 60, and if that information he put together from private servers will carry over to classic.
---
If so, the druids are perfectly fine offtanking most raid content, and potentially main tanking for very specific fights where block/party/crushing blow is not a main factor for damage mitigation.
---
Paladins, due to several game mechanics and total lack of gearing options, are at best capable of tanking dungeon instances.
---
yes, it was a streamer only tourney
---
I'm not surprised lol
---
It just depends in the guild, I'm sure there will be less serious guilds that won't mind meme specs
---
Motherfuckers. I thought I was the only one thinking of doing this. Now I know I won’t get a cool name like George
---
I got Fridays to myself; so getting someone who raids on fridays probably won't be too hard. I'll probably be running dungeons on Friday-Saturdays during better peak hours.
---
Or you could not be a soft skinned bitch and ignore them
---
XP isn’t ANCIENT.... maybe old AF.
---
Omg. Stfu allready!!!
---
No I'd rather be a soft skinned bitch.
---
I'd be down with a 'duplicate' character option. Like, I get to 60 in classic, they roll out BC, and I can start playing from 60 on BC but keep my 60 on classic (for continue naxx funtimes).
---
I think there certainly will be because you don't have super bullshit items deciding entire seasons like you do in retail. Acting like retail's current iteration of PvP is "healthy" is laughable. Its literally figure out what trinket in the newest raid/mythic/whatever you can abuse and abuse the fuck out of it for rating until it gets patched.
---
What professions would you recommend? 
---
Is the Ench trinket really that important for bare??
---
Classic Gymnastic never fails.
---
Hmm a game design that was in Vanilla yet I don't remember it? Well I don't remember it so if it's in Classic then it's going to ruin my immersion! #NoChanges(FromMyMemory).
---
Thanks for letting me know!  Classic WoW will be open on the 13th or just open to create characters on?
---
That would add skill talent and logic to fights in vanilla.
---
Seems like people actually wan't nostalgia over another chance at WoW.
---
you need an active sub to reserve a name. So if you are planning to sub just for classic, you'll have to start paying a month early just to reserve the names. I doubt there will be a shitload of people reserving.
---
I see.
---
Do you want to warstomp or resist stuns?
---
Já tem a comunidade? Estou procurando
---
Manda um alô
---
Does it make kiting impossible though? Yes the mobs can hit you from further away but you can also hit them from further away. It will require adjustment, and it may well be worse overall, but it's not impossible.
---
&gt;“Self policed communities” tend to just be a euphemism for “incredibly toxic and culturally homogeneous communities”.  
---
&gt;It doesn’t really matter what’s banned and what isn’t. Without some authority to step in and stop things, it just devolves into any deviance being met with hyper aggression.
---
Waiting for the bit where he explains how that's a bad thing.
---
I wan't to be a hunter in classic more than pretty much anything, bar maybe world peace or some shit.
---
Leeway means I won't play a hunter and potentially not the game.
---
I've wanted to play a hunter in classic for over 10 years now and it finally happened, aaaand  its gone.
---
So basically we have to subscribe 14 days earlier to secure the name we want...
---
Seems a little thirsty.
---
No one is advocating for toxicity. Please reflect on why people are concerned about this before spewing uneducated nonsense.
---
Nice, not gonna steal it. All my names are based on booze.
---
Troll Hunter- Bowmore (Scotch whiskey)
---
For example
---
Egad! It counts doubly so if there is a linkable copy.
---
I'm somewhat torn on which faction to play. I mainly levelled as Alliance, but faction changed to Horde and spent most of my time there. This means I know the Alliance levelling zones very well, I know where to find the hidden quests, I know when to do each area and which quests to group for efficiency, so getting to 40 is fairly straightforward. I like Stormwind as a place, and probably prefer it to all other major cities.
---
My main goal at 60 is to run AV. I'm even thinking of starting a guild mainly dedicated to running AV. I believe Alliance typically do better in AV, but if I did end up doing organised AV PvP this wouldn't matter, indeed because of the Alliance dominance there might be faster queues for Horde. I think it's also easier to turtle AV as Horde, thus dragging it out.  If I don't end up in organised PvP then being Alliance might lead to more AV wins.
---
With that in mind, my choices are roll Horde, main either an Orc warlock, Troll shadow priest, or an Undead mage, and have a Tauren druid alt.
---
Or, I can roll Alliance, main a Nelf shadow priest, and have a Nelf druid alt.
---
I'm considering horde because even though I don't know the quests as well, it might be fun to experience something different. I faction transferred to an Undead mage, who I mained throughout WotLK, so it would be cool to go back and play one from the beginning. I did level an Undead shadow priest to 60 on Nost, and didn't struggle, so I think I'd be happy to do it again. Drawbacks are the aesthetics of Orgrimmar aren't really to my taste, and questing may just not feel like WoW without doing Darkshire. Also, undead mage will be very overdone.
---
Drawbacks to playing Alliance are the lack of class options I'm really interested in. I don't want to play a Gnome, and Human magi are boring. If Dwarf warlock was a thing I think I'd definitely do that. I could main a Nelf SP easily, and Mind Control out of Shadowmeld seems like a lot of fun.
---
Part of me just wants to say fuck it and try and be the very best balance druid like noone ever was. I did that on my original toon and dropping massive starfires was great fun, if not particularly viable.
---
Are people such snowflakes they can’t handle words? You know how many death threats I received doing the pvp world quests in legion, I never felt the need to report them, I just told them to git gud
---
Life’s dope.
---
Well... can’t really argue against that
---
Hell! I was in Seattle, WA (PST) and have been playing on Elune (EST) server since vanilla release and I never went that high of ping unless the server itself was going buggy. 
---
I had Qwest DSL, and not the best option at the time even - I just assumed that it was there because the fucking cows were VASTLY larger than the other races that it makes sense they have a little longer reach.
---
lol
---
LULW
---
Apparently it did
---
Damn. Your comment sent this fool to the void
---
Haha tattooing the symbol of 3 toed mud hut living sewer dwelling scum dont think so.
---
That's not class balance it's cheating.
---
He played a shaman and just rerolled Paladin a few days ago iirc
---
This guy reading comprehensions!
---
https://youtu.be/SwSR1SHYZRI 3:12 in the maydie video looks to be exactly like the leeway in the beta, the rogue is strafing away, maydie strafes to the left and white swings him from africa
---
You will lose fights due to melee leeway as a hunter.
---
Pure chance will be how hunter v others goes every now and then.
---
&gt; choose emotions over logic
---
Etiquette is inherently illogical, existing to prevent people from getting 'offended'
---
That’s is a really well done tat. Coloring and all is top. Got some good color saving gel for it to keep it fresh?
---
I’m pretty sure it was. This is the last patch of vanilla wow before BC came out. Before the BC pre-patch I mean.
---
Do you remember the lvl 60 pvp PTR where they gave you premade characters with a full set of epic gear? 12 year old me had a BLAST dueling people in Mulgore on that server.
---
"Lol, I can't even pay attention to the shit my phone is saying that I'm saying!"
---
have fun staying in a warriors dead zone with this leeway
---
as if warriors in classic needed any more fucking buffs lmao
---
Funny how you twerps still talk about nochanges people like they’re a thing anymore. Layering is a catastrophic change that really trumps any other change bliztivision could make, period. It is the antithesis of vanilla and anyone who was actually nochanges has given up
---
I chose to play BFA because I liked it. I have no trouble subbing and playing it again for a couple weeks.
---
you're the most wise baby boomer I've ever met
---
The one in red ridge where you and a group fight your way into the keep overrun by blackrock orcs
---
Yeah even the hardcore guilds bring 1-2 druids.  You will be just fine.
---
&gt; hoodwink people into trying BFA. 
---
Oh no imagine if someone actually ENJOYED an entirely different game? Activision strikes again!
---
Too much Us vs Them on this sub. Just because someone enjoys Mario doesn't mean they can't go buy a Sega Genesis.
---
That's a conspiracy theory I've heard but as it wasn't ever confirmed for classi, let's not operate from a place of irrational fear.
---
Ahhh, I was so happy when I got my Jboots
---
From a married person to another - cheers to that!
---
This is dumb. You’ve already had one meme locked due to it being deemed “low-effort”. Clearly you haven’t improved.
---
Baiting people to interrupt you by using that rods cast 5Head
---
Bro ive wasted 10x that money on far dumber shit I want my nane
---
&gt; I'm also interested in if the aoe leeway for spellcasters works diffently for Tauren. Do they receive an increased range of attack on their spells?
---
How does your reply answer his question? I.e. How does Melee Leeway affect Frost Shock and Earthbind Totem kiting whether the Shaman is a Tauren or not?
---
Classic will be released as 1.12, when EPL and silithus added quest hubs to the game. Your comment would be correct if those 2 zones were not able to be quested in. There was a point where it was nearly impossible to have any quests past 59 and you had to grind mobs all the way to 60
---
What can you play then. Healers are the only thing it won't effect much. Druid healers move alot so it screws them over, only tanky healers/nonmoving dmg dealers wont get destroyed.
---
Shooting you a PM now!
---
Allowing the most toxic and shitty players of your game take over is a really quick way to kill your game, there's a reason literally no successful games are handsoff in this respect
---
I'm actually having fun in BFA, leveling from 1 to 120 and it was super cheap as well, 30 euro's for the entire game with 1 month of subscription. 
---
so I disagree with you.
---
Technically we don't need much so I'd rather not go down that path.
---
It won't give any advantages to enjoyment having leeway in game, for myself it will be way worse.
---
This is exactly what I wanted as well, I don't want to miss quests but I also don't want the locations of objectives spoiled
---
Yeah, my first character on Vanilla was like that, several levels of just grinding before moving to a higher zone.  By the time I made my third alt, it was much easier to level up.  TBC leveling was a joke, I rolled a BE Pally soon after launch.
---
I don't remember it either
---
It's not like they just fired a bunch of staff that would have been involved in checking and processing reports.  
---
They couldn't possibly use the same automated system from retail that they implemented to save money.  
---
How naive are you exactly?
---
Raid content.
---
He's been trolling a lot here. (all his posts are unrated/hidden)
---
&gt;Don’t see why we wouldn’t just be chill with the Tauren though.
---
Tauren have many Native Americans customs and traits.....
---
*USA sweating*
---
The automated system is also going to stop people spamming heinous shit faster than a person can work through a report queue. It's not perfect but it's better than n word spam
---
People just don't like you.
---
Is this really worth wasting your time to write up a post? Try not being  a shit rogue you dont need to have a free opener to win. Fucking Nephew alert.
---
If you're that ignorant of the situation why argue against something of which you have so little knowledge?
---
No, Ryan started the fire!
---
nice
---
Your Place in The World.
---
Correct.
---
There's a world of difference between a free trial and a game you have to front a sub to play (you could argue it's a f2p game basically for the BFA crowd though I guess).
---
I just wanna fk ppl over, troll and face roll in pvp. What class should I go?
---
Why are so many people against it? Seems like a good feature to me.
---
Also every dungeon from 40-60, as well as special events like holidays or even AQ gate opening.
---
I understood him perfectly, But then again I'm not being a pedantic a hole.
---
Plus druids, I understand though having never played one, are still crushable. Also they cannot block
---
Unfortunately, the poll will undoubtedly be influenced by the pre-set order
---
It answers it because leeway affects everyone the same, so it doesn't matter what race or class you pick.
---
We download all our games because the download speeds are universally higher. But ping can easily be the same or worse than in 2006, depending on your location. And something like melee leeway depends on ping rather than those other factors.
---
Or, here's a great idea, we can just add those people to our ignore list and we can *not* have the easily abusable system in the game?  
---
That shit will be automatically filtered by the profanity filter as well which is enable by default.

---
Blizzard is the company that runs the server farm, they are in charge of the infrastructure. They can also software lock their client to specific OS' by not developing it for newer ones. They should restrict the client to windows 7, anything after that is NOT blizzlike. They also need to set up a separate data center with old equipment otherwise it is NOT blizzlike. You're a fake nochanger
---
Aw... seems you're a little rump ruffled. I wouldn't play PVP if I were you if that happens so easily.
---
Yeah I mean you can prefer that, but it's really hard to defend it from a design perspective.
---
It makes everything feel slower, and sure, it makes certain things more or less viable, but IMO you end up with a more responsive product that 99% of people will prefer when they actually experience it.
---
Bald paladin squad purging evil with the power of the light circa 2005: https://youtu.be/YGprNddeo2o?t=308

I never talked shit about anyone
---
I've played retail for years with this being a feature, never seen it get used on anyone "famous" on my server.
---
I'm fine with more challenge is all, gl on your warlock or whatever
---
What are those bosses which require warrior exclusive cool downs? never tanked in vanilla.
---
I'm actually someone that wants changes, but I now realise you're just arguing for the sake of arguing so I'm out.
---
If you actually want to have a conversation about this then I suggest you don't start out with a strawman so hard that you have to pack every orifice of your body with the stuff to pull it off.
---
But in case you're not an odious littler troll:
---
- duplicated effort
---
- training pro social behaviour
---
- conditions of entry vs secret police
---
That's basically a summary of my views, I don't think private gaming venues (which is really what virtual worlds are) are some great bastion of political free thought so I couldn't care less about the doomsday potential of asking people to leave their shoes by the door on the way in.

“From 1-40 In 10 minutes”
---
Clickbaited.
---
Cross realm bg were in Vanilla. They came with patch 1.12.
---
Isn't the whole point of that sharding crap to make day 1 smooth?
---
I have a better idea: everyone starts at the same time with NO $7.50 charge.
---
Personally I'd love for Raid specific gear that can only be used in new raids. So you can still wear your Naxx gear but then you enter Kara and any gear you get there goes into a 2nd page that gives you extra stats on your current gear but only in Kara. Then you go to Emerald dream / Caverns of Time / Hyjal and they only work in those instances.
---
That way you still get more raids and more gear but the power creep is still based on your regular classic gear.
---
Maybe in those instances there is a few pieces that aren't bound to the instance so you can still improve your character outside. Maybe a few legendary items which you can then show off outside the instance.
---
If this isn't ideal, we could add gear equivalent to Naxx gear with a different bonus for while you're in Classic+ instances
---
So Sunfury bow would have like:  
---
52 DPS  
---
Equip: Improves your chance to get a critical strike by 1%.  
---
Equip: +16 Attack Power.  
---
Equip within Karazhan: Provide 25 Attack Power to everyone in your group.
---
So it's very similar to Soulstring from Naxx but has an added bonus.
---
It didn't have charges.  It was just a use item, and yes, no one should ever turn that quest in.
---
Why wouldn't you have insurance...?
---
Why stop there? Why not go to 30 to 40k?
---
The game was designed to handle a certain player base. You want to over quadruple it and call that blizzlike... just deal with the layering for a bit. It will be fine.
---
What comments, that you're asking a question that's asked over 25 times a day because you're too lazy or ignorant to use the search?
---
Tauren for that sweet sweet stam passive. Also they're dope.
---
It's already obsolete for all of us who will be re-subbing to play Classic.
---
Weird
---
And then you move 1mm closer and it says “you must face the target.”
---
Classic will hold people’s attention for awhile, but in the end, there’s more to accomplish in retail. Once everyone has raided to the end of classic, I imagine they’ll return to retail until there’s a reason to go back to classic
---
7.50?  ( seben fitty )My beer and wings for the week is well over 80 bucks... That's weekly. I think I am ok with the early sub
---
Yes, and if you look at blizzard's definition, then you cannot argue that it isn't an exploit.
---
That's what they're doing with layering.... Or you could just deal with competing for mobs for a week. It will be fine.
---
If you don't want to be camped you have two easy options:
---
Don't roll on a pvp server.
---
Take the res sickness
---
Nothin humble brah my shit it liiiiiiiit.
---
The why are my votes never hidden
---
&gt; It's kind if weird that your so supportive of cheating in a multiplayer game.
---
It's like you don't even know what you're saying before you say it or something
---
I gank popular streamer-&gt; I get reported 100 times-&gt; I get automuted or temp banned  .
---
I never ganked anybody, this is one of the main reasons I felt like an idiot for playing on a PvP server from Vanilla to MoP.
---
Everyone will quit, rather than play with world buff exploits.  The game will fail.
---
The system is fine as is.  
---
The profanity filter is enabled by default so most people would never see it. The rest can just ignore people they don't want to see.
---
Im a brazilian and i plan to play classic.  I hope i can play on a very populated server which is a key trait, imo, of classic wow.  I played on Dalaran as a alliance back in the day.  What i fear is that the portuguese comunity wont be able to unite a decent population for a dedicated server altough meaning we can have local server to play with low ping.  After i stoped playing wow in late 2008 the south american server went online and i have no ideia of the current hype from brazilians, nor any other portuguese speaking comunities, for the classic release...
---
Well, how much dev time would you sink into races that no one will play? 
---
Not that we need edgelord demon hunters.
---
not my mommy taught me not to draw on myself
---
You are not alone
---
Mmm. I like right click reports, but not automatic action
---
its true its extremely well done
---
Remember the pre battlenet launcher? I liked that one.
---
Oh no. What if I enjoy it! That would be AWFUL.

What is Blizzard's definition of an exploit?

Lol? The first line in the OPs post is confirmed.by blizzard. The second reply to the first comment is literally the blue post confirming it. How exactly is it a conspiracy theory?
---
AoE leeway: you're not casting arcane explosions while moving. Doesn't affect you (unless you're using Sapper Charges in PVP 
---
Melee leeway: restos and eles trying to kite are getting hit from further away when trying to kite stuff without either targets being slowed. Enhances get to smack stuff from farther away if neither targets are slowed.
---
Keep in mind that leeway is only active if neither you nor your target are slowed.
---
And then those 100 people get banned for making false reports so the joke is on them
---
What about 'suggest invite' I really want that.
---
Agreed. Why would anyone try to stop a conversation that they have no plans of being part of?
---
I was more referring to world first 60. I think he said that he will be taking lots of breaks while leveling to 60 his first time so he most likely wont be world first. But keep in mind Joana himself said that speedleveling was a much smaller community back in Vanilla so the competition is gonna be a lot larger for this time around.
---
Then why do you keep saying it?
---
It's the same thread champ
---
asmon tested it and got booted out of the game pending GM review
---
Yeah that won’t happen. The mainstream plays mobile games that literally play themselves. They aren’t going to go back to a version of a game that takes more time and effort to get those shiny epix.
---
Here's what I prefer. Increase server caps to 5000 and shard only the starting areas. This gives some leeway for populations dropping by half after a few weeks and not feeling dead. Also once players level a bit and spread out it won't be a big deal, people will enjoy all the activity in each zone.
---
imagine actually being on Warsong and not being BR. That was my life.
---
I'm curious to see how aoe farming will be once most people get to 60 and when there is a lot less competition for mob grinding.
---
Waking up those damn peons.
---
I know. I couldn't think of anything else to say.
---
I've never said that bad words are cheating. You must be looking at someone else's posts.
---
&gt; I said its weird you want it harder to report cheaters.
---
The majority of reports are not used on cheaters and are used to silence people the reportee doesn't agree with. It's not like you're missing out on reporting a speed hacker if you can't report them in 2 seconds. You're being intentionally obtuse at this point by having your opinion refuted all over this thread.
---
Hammer of Revitalization shows Phase 5 but it's from DM. Is this a typo or do you know something I don't?
---
this wont happen, retail will always be the much more popular game. classic is niche
---
Probably more than 50% but that's why we have layering. Otherwise they would have to do server merges and classic would be perceived as a failure.
---
Low quality shit posssst
---
I literally quoted your exact words saying that and I'm not the only one in this thread to tell you you've said it. Don't backtrack now you said it not long ago even.
---
Good luck!
---
Do you think mage is
---
Majorly gimped now?
---
Well I'll keep downvoting and reporting the constant reposts when there are threads going on. No reason for 1,000 duplicate threads.
---
Do you feel better? Or still hollow inside?
---
My vote would be with warrior. You’re well versed in their gear/play style etc. you’ll hit 60 relatively quickly and do the things you’re keen on, potentially ahead of the curve. And warrior dps is high on meters with rogues till late game raids when mages overtake them. 
---
Warrior seems where you’re most keen on spending your time. 
---
Then when you hit 60 and have downtime then level a mage to fill in the time or break the routine/monotony if you feel so inclined.
---
Why is this likely? Have they said so or are you pulling stuff out of your ass?
---
Yes sir, played dwarf rogue my entire wow career. Me and my bud want to experience the other side this time. Thanks for the consideration though !
---
Could happen. Retail sub numbers are in the gutter.
---
Vurtne does it in the first scene in vurtne 1 where he is fighting two rogues.
---
You may be new to reddit but with that kind of name calling you’ll fit right in, trust me.
---
The limited time I've spent in retail since cata, I found it very useful for reporting people spewing unnecessary racist BS and stuff of that nature. No clue whether it ever contributed to a change in someone's behavior, though.
---
Why can't you just use the ignore feature? What if my guild decided the way you worded what you just said was toxic?
---
That hurts. I'm a shinigami.
---
Nah normaly im really calm and polite but reddits horrible and brings out the worste
---
https://youtu.be/vGCIGEUB32M

Never played one but from what I've seen is, in raids, yeah it's a lot of frostbolt spam but in pvp they are fun af with a lot to do. Also, at one point in raiding, you'll swap to arcane, though, I don't know how they play.
---
Yep. Took two Windows XP re installations and 5+ CD install attempts to reach the login screen.
---
11 year old me almost did a backflip when the cinematic introduction started playing on my second hand Pentium 4 slim desktop machine. 12 frames per second in Northshire Valley too!
---

---
I’d be lying if I said I don’t enjoy it when Nazi Snowflakes need to run back to their safe spaces because different opinions triggered them. Haha
---
I guess you should report me for being toxic, I wasn't being sensitive to your people
---
So what's the meaning? Explain it to me. I'm trying to understand your side of things, man, I'd appreciate if you didn't lump me in with "you people" whatever that means. 
---
For the record - I don't like or want world buffs in vanilla. I think it's a shitty mechanic. But don't call it an exploit if it's not.
---
This is the first time OCE will have low ping on classic/vanilla
---
You don't have to be a condescending jerk to get your point across.
---
That isn't nearly bad enough for me to care.
---
The pre-set order is random.
---
I misread the title, thought he was going for 1-40 in 10 minutes played. I know he’s fast, but he couldn’t be that fast lol
---
It’s a 1/2 decent looking tat but man that’s fucking stupid, don’t listen to the haters though man it’s your body so do what you want to it. 
---
It’ll be funny listening to you explaining it though
---
Top = largest relative effectiveness.
---
No you'll swap to fire.  Arcane has always been the supplementary tree for mages.
---
Well I'm offended by your political beliefs so I'm going to report you
---
To be fair nostalrius did a lot of things right
---
This kind of happened with rs3/osrs afaik osrs has 10 times the playerbase
---
Epl?
---
Shit, my bad!
---
No ones every quoted me as saying mean words are cheating. Ever. It's not something I've ever said. I'd love if you could actually show me a quote where I said that.
---
I use google specifically to find things on reddit.

---
There's the link again. Are you simple?
---
&gt; Your post was very poorly worded
---
Thanks for the kind feedback.
---
Server first, not world first
---
We need them both, you see an enemy player, you need that moment to question, is this a fight or a chance passing... You read the body language which is oddly visable even in a game and the events unfold!  Love that moment. 
---
Except on my warrior, leveling everyone wanted to fight, I eventually just attacked everything that moved regardless, it was going to happen anyways!
---
Say, you are playing X class, and an Enhancement shaman come at you. You sap/blind/stun/sheep/ban him from existence, but in the meantime his auto-attack procs windfury. He will be sapped/blinded/sheeped/banned from existence, but you also die.
---
Feel free.
---
diminishing return is player based, they dont share with other ppl abilities
---
The game isn't even out yet so there aren't reports to silence people. Your thinking of BFA which is a different game with different mechanics. This game is still in the beta so a majority of reports are actually just bugs.
---
Played horde in original vanilla and was always jealous of alliance.  Alliance dominated both pvp and pve on my server.  I will be going alliance this time around.
---
Reading your other responses in this thread... you need to go outside.
---
That's why as I stated before I'm not in favor of auto-adjudication of reports. A person responsible for triaging these reports can clearly tell the difference between some kid screaming the N word and someone being reported for killing their favorite guildmaster.
---
Part of why I asked this question in the first place is because I was unaware that there is auto-adjudication currently for right-click reporting.

If you think this is about wanting to make mages OP you haven't understood a damn thing about what the complaints are about.

This dude is right. Everyone here seems to be retarded.

I’m 25, unemployed, no girlfriend, literally living in my parents basement, and can’t wait for classic!
---
&gt; The game isn't even out yet so there aren't reports to silence people.
---
It's the same system as in retail. Don't be dense dude. It's not like language is going to be policed differently in BFA than Classic. That's honestly such a bad opinion it baffles me.
---
'Legolazz'
---
&gt; Do you think I'm incorrect to say this is something the sub is up in  arms about, considering the huge influx of posts about leeway over the  past couple of weeks? 
---
You characterized it as a "here we go again with the crybabies" But I honestly don't care to argue semantics about emotions being objectively "wrong" or "right" either you'll read them with a common amount of charity and ascribe reasonable meaning to what I said or not, I won't jump through the hoops you laid out. 
---
But see how based on your post it seemed like you were completely against changing leeway? Or you might go down the cringe road of pretending your post had an entirely different meaning.
---
Take your head out of the sand dude.
---
&gt;BFA bad  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Layering bad

&gt;Min-maxing bad

&gt;look at this nostalgic screenshot

You really want to see these same posts every time you click on the sub?

That's a good thing for the main post. The biggest reason for unreliable surveys is poorly worded questions.

I'm going mining/eng for pvp. Professions depend totally on what you want to do in the game. Want to make money? Herb/alch or skinning/LW. The trinket is bis for bear druid for the entirety of the game FYI

Bugger of Negative Larry
---
That should never happen, not even after a hundred reports.
---
Random inputs = random outputs.
---
I did not characterize it as anything of the sort. You're assigning additional meaning to my comment because you're emotionally attached to the subject. It doesn't need to be more complicated than you saying "Sorry I made an assumption about what you meant".

IT'S AUTOMATED. IT'S FUCKING AUTOMATED. HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DO PEOPLE HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S AUTOMATED IN THIS THREAD?
---
Sorry about that but I feel I had to caps lock that since all of the defenders of right click reporting ALWAYS FORGET THIS.
---
I'm not telling you to like people saying things you don't like. I'm telling you to grow up, ignore them and move on with your day. It's not worth it since it's so easily abused and there is already a feature for you to ignore these people.
---
yo its like $8 man. You can make that in like half an hour for minimum wage where i live. Who gives a shit
---
Again no where in that link to I talk about bad words being cheating. Lol. Your confused by something. I think you know your wrong so you won't quote the text. If you did, you'd see I never talk about words or language ever in there.

Great piece of art!  Would never mar my sexy body, but this shit looks amazing!

Only illogical if you are ignorant of human development or history. Try pouring some vodka on yourself before your daily routine. Good luck.

Talking or reading about layers is dead to me now. I don't even want a triple layer nacho. A 5 layer burrito. I will never layer clothes or say it again.  I don't ever want to see a layer of snow on the ground.  I am officially layered the fuck out
---
Poll is pointless. Players will just vote on classes played by the majority through bias.
---
The answer is also clear, but again pointless to say due to "majority meme" rule.
---
holy shit dude, I'm talking about the abuse of the system. You saying I'm for people cheating is clearly you saying mean words are cheating since THAT WAS THE CONTEXT OF OUR CONVERSATION. It's like you can't even think straight.
---
Yeah, nobody told *me* that it was automated. That's why I asked a question. That is the purpose of questions: to find unknown information.
---
It's the same UI but it would make no sense to have the same auto suspensions. That's just a bad idea for classic.
---
58-60 you (c|sh)ould be doing dungeons to gear up anyway?

BR? BR!

Why would it make sense for them to make a new system when they already have one? The fuck are you smoking dude?

Resets are part of duels, its super needed for mages.

Man, you're daft.

No one is losing $2 million dollars. TWO MILLION DOLLARS. From medical bills if they have proper coverage.  Which they can afford with TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

If you think that's even *feasible*, you're a fucking idiot.

&gt; Yeah, nobody told me that it was automated

Why are you coming into a conversation about a system you don't understand in it's simplest form?

He told his viewers to mass report him, and got banned?

This video has some good info, but a few things stood out as misinformation:
---
* Animated Chain Necklace not in until Phase 2
---
* Mantle of lost hope not available until Phase 5
---
* Hide of the Wild is not until Phase 2
---
* Ghoul Skin is not in until Phase 2
---
* Faith Healers boots are not in until Phase 5
---
* Ring of Mending and the .5 Questline not available until Phase 5. Same with the offhand and Idol. 
---
* Briarwood Reed is not in until Phase 2
---
* You present HOTW and Deep Resto talent builds, but don't include the popular moonglow spec. 
---
* You suggest sometimes using Rank 1 and 2 Healing touch for Mana efficiency. However, Rank 1 is less efficient than Rank 4. Rank 2 at that level of +healing would be essentially the same level of efficiency as Rank 4. Neither Rank 1 or 2 is more efficient than Rank 4 if you don't spec into Gift of Nature. Your most efficient rank early on is Rank 10. 
---
* Brilliant mana oil not available until phase 4. 
---
* No mention of Five Second Rule/timing of consumable use. Innervate weapon/Pre-casting
---
* I would also want to let Resto Druids know that the Gift of Nature tooltip is misleading. It is a +10% increase on base healing only, not total healing.
---
maybe no changes refers more to things like dungeon finder, summoning at meeting stones etc.

That's just not true. Joana practiced and refined his route on private servers. He even did a run on a repack without any other players competing which ended up at [3 days, 22 hours.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/513215340558286878/560247566667874304/lvl60-joanna.jpg)
---
I’m a fan of Esfand but he’s more than doubled his sub count since Classic Beta’s release, he has many months to go to even maintain that kind of money, like 8 months.
---
I guess that's how you misread my statement but no it's never words that are cheating. Though like my statement said it supports cheating to make it harder to report them.  I haven't ever wavered from that. Getting rid of right click supporting is just going to be a way to make cheating more prevalent.
---
Calling it denial but it literally is next month 🤔🤔
---
Technically yes, but it's not like it every really matter that much. If it is important to you being a strong 2 man pvp team then well you wouldn't be picking druid anyway. Your hots don't stack either.
---
Ahh that makes sense
---
To answer you’re question -  no, I am not. Tat looks cool though
---
Jokes on Blizz - They gave me a BFA Trial with 3 days subscription. I'll be using that to reserve my name.

Disposable income needs to be disposed of
---
Peace! Have a good night! 
---
I'm arguing to show the absurdity of the argument that Blizzard isn't in the hardware game so it doesn't matter.
---
I wonder if they accounted for trial accounts that were used for nefarious deeds instead of actually playing the game.
---
Hunters wing clip because its all they can do, theyd rather not be in melee ever.
---
Who or what was I asking?

F
---
Paladin mount quests! Did them on my belf forever ago, stoked to see what they’re like for alliance
---
We will all need luck since they are removing skill.
---
I am not too sure
---
Double the shaman value to get an accurate reading. They are only one sided horde. Same goes for paladins.
---
Cut off your left hand. You love a challenge I await your 1 handed rise to rank 14 sir.
---
It's the melee range ratio between the aoe of the planted totem vs the Tauren being hit ... seeing how an elemental and resto shaman isn't caring about melee due to wanting to escape the melee range.
---
There is ABSOLUTELY a concern until verified. Have you verified it or are you people still not understanding the variables in question here?
---
Confirm that an Orc shaman dropping an Earthbind totem can kite worse, better or the same as a Tauren.
---
Sure bruh, do whatever you want
---
Idk if you ever sort by new but that's how I view reddit by default. When I sort by new and scroll, I get multiple of the same posts on a single page. One title will say "should there be TBC after classics success" then 3 posts down you'll see "Post classic content thoughts" and further still "when will we get wrath". Its not bad to post something it a cursory search provides no duplicate posts but most people aren't even looking which really bogs down the sub.
---
Doesn't NEED to be fixed is the point. It's going to feel strange as it was meant as a lag fix mechanic. But since we're emulating classic and "no changes" is everyone's mantra, it's in as it is part of the classic mechanics.
---
Most people in here probably insta bought 6 months of playtime to "have the chance" at the beta.
---
tried it in a raid group, was unbanned shortly after but its unacceptable
---
Dork alert
---
From wowwiki:
---
"
---
An exploit (known as "exploitive activity" by [Blizzard](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blizz)) is a method of playing the game in a way not intended by the game developers to gain an advantage over other players."
---
I can't see how world buffs working like every other buff in the game is unintended.
---
Also, Kevin Jordan (vanilla designer) said on Countdown to Classic that the designers knew world buffs would be stacked to some extent. So world buffs would be consistent with that statement.
---
And, for extra special since you want to be a smartass about it: I am an information security professional. What i am hired to do is find compromised networks and hosts. There are two primary methods by which an attacker gains access to a system: through established, stolen credentials, or through exploiting a flaw in software that gives them unnecessary access. Your web server may have a flaw that allows an attacker to execute code remotely on a system. So in the context of WoW, I would say there is no exploit I am aware of regarding stacking world buffs, because there is no bug or internally inconsistent mechanic enabling this.
---
And, for extra EXTRA special: five pages into Google as you instructed and I have found no blue post, EULA, or ToS clause defining an exploit. So, please, enlighten me where I've gone wrong - or admit you're using the term incorrectly. There is no shame in admitting you're wrong.
---
Unfortunately that’s just not true. There are weekly threads put up for class discussions, LFG, etc. Those things get posted nonstop anyway.
---
I've never heard anyone say no changes. 
---
I think it's an irrelevant point.
---
You didnt have 20Mbps at the time of wows launch . 
---
Im sorry you just didnt bro its a cool story buts its complete  bullshit
---
More importantly you’ll be constantly competing for the same drops.
---
As someone else said, I would vote for warrior as well, if you have the experience as a warrior, probably easier to go warrior. Offtank/dps role is a lot less intense, as well there's going to be a huge amount of dps warrior slots for many guilds now that we have much more knowledge of the game and know how meleecleaves destroy bosses.
---
I'm fairly certain harassment and so forth is in the ToS. Bad words are one thing but harassing people or spamming in chat aren't good for the games health and again in pretty sure against ToS.
---
But this time they could have the benefit of hindsight.
---
the current leeway and .4sec spell batching really does feel like someone intentionally holding out on an unviable position which may end up hurting the product.
---
often this comes down to mgmt personalities/egos.  there is no telling what is really going on.
---
&gt; Confirm that an Orc shaman dropping an Earthbind totem can kite worse, better or the same as a Tauren.
---
Hmm so much negativism from OP and some comments...
---
I wonder why would someone come to Classic reddit if he actually doesnt like the game. Haters feeling need to share their frustration perhaps?
---
There will be tourists for sure. And the BfA kids with low attention span. They wont be able to handle not having instant gratification and frontloaded content. But reports were coming from people making more friends during stress test than in last 7 years or retail. Do not underestimate the power of real mmorpg, social interactions

So if I understood it correct, you bind the other 2 stances in the switching bar of current stance. Isn't there the danger to spam a stance switch and switch twice, back to the first stance?

See answer below actually detailing the correct answer instead of spam.

Check his post history. I already recognize the low effort shitposting

What a confusing thread. Just ask people to rank classes in order of skill required to play them at their peak, with 1 being the lowest

If everyone in a discussion knew every single detail of what was discussed, there would never be any point in humans having discussions.

---
Head to gurabashi arena, have the people watching in the stands and the duelists on the field. If someone trolls they will be flagged for PvP, kill them and have people camp entrances. This way if they keep spawning and dying they will have a longer cooldown on respawn and be detected. Not perfect but could work.
---
So, basically you're requesting sticky threads for topics that are currently being beaten to death?
---
That seems pretty reasonable and would contain the barrage of threads we get about the same issues.
---
I agree
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=no+changes&amp;restrict_sr=on
---
It comes up in basically every thread on the subreddit. People are wanting the true to life classic experience, no QOL changes that destroyed the game as we knew it.
---
It exists and will continue to exist because of how the client operates. Same with spell batching. It has been removed from modern wow as it wasn't needed, and how the game plays with modern technology.
---
But seeing as we are emulating an old version of the game, the old mechanics are going to come back, for better or worse.
---
You mean instead of being correct, I should read below where I'm actually correct?
---
  tl;dr - I'm correct.
---
As someone else said, go rogue, or alternatively go mage.
---
Yes, it's also in PVE and it's a major pain in the ass.
---

---
what about that makes you think he is scared to post in this subreddit?
---
He has literally posted in this subreddit.
---
I literally said "I don't have a position on this but I fail to see the drawbacks." I was not aware of any drawbacks. No argument was made. Read before you get snarky.
---
As a software engineer, I can make code do anything. However, I can't buy a brand new 16 year old blade, nor would I want to. I get what you're saying but it's moot. The hardware that the client runs on is the user's responsibility. Blizzard's job, as a software company, is to provide the software (in a form that it once was). That's surely not hard to grasp. The software (including batching) was a product of the hardware limitations, and they're recreating that, however they're running it on modern architecture and are thus essentially simulating the old hardware. This is beneficial for a variety of reasons including scalability, security and parallelism (backups, crash recovery) assuming they're using AWS. They have literally made the game as it was. That's literally what people asked for. If they were to limit it to old GPUs etc they'd lose sales. Not only is your argument fundamentally flawed in that the computers that WoW is installed on is the users responsibility, but it doesn't make sense in a business sense. They've done their #nochanges job, now it's our job to sleep in the bed we made.

#The Battle of Darrowshire
---
Rich Campbell. He's probably one of the more famous casters he's done a lot of different games for different tournaments. Plays WoW as well
---
It has no affect on server performance. It still exists in retail to this day but the windows are so small now that for human reaction time it may as well not exist. 
---
But back in vanilla it was a little less than a half a second or so - creating some interesting mechanics and a bit of a skill cap in PvP (although I still feel a bit of this is over stated because you’ll never know where in the window you are) 
---
But it doesn’t negatively effect actual server performance, it can potentially feel a little less “crisp” than retail - at least that’s what the beta feedback was and that it may need to be tuned a bit more. Not sure what state it is in now.
---
I guess Its worth to try a dualboot then ;) Maybe there is enough support.
---
That's because everyone's a winner and you share all resources on retail. You don't compete for shit. Thus it doesn't get abused. Even if you get muted it won't matter on retail since everything is interface-initiated.
---
Not so much with Vanilla.
---
What are the common complaints with retail anyway? Seems like run of the mill WoW to me.
---
fuck you and the toxic people in this sub
---
Aye and removing those / down voting makes sense.
---
But why are we brigading posts without a relevant sticky?
---
I just spent $30 on happy hour margaritas, I can spend $7.50 to get my name if I want.
---
Downvoted by reddit plebs
---
It's intentionally vague so they can choose when they want to enforce it. Doesn't change that the auto report system is more ripe for abuse than helpful
---
No problem man I am the flip side of that coin so I 100% understand your sentiment. Hope you enjoy your journey this time around!
---
My point was your suggestion for a solution as some type of cure all for the issue isn’t accurate. It’ll happen anyway.
---
If you can make 30k a month for even 6 months - that’s a lot of money that could be saved if you acted like nothing really changed..
---
I’m not concerned for any streamer in particular, but I always wonder if they will spend the money like an NBA star and wash up or invest in their future.
---
&gt; If everyone in a discussion knew every single detail of what was discussed
---
I'm not saying to know everything single detail. I'm saying know the basics. You just sound ignorant if you come into a conversation and give your opinion only to be discovered you're completely uninformed.
---
If the #nochanges crowd really were dedicated to even all the hardware limitations then they should be forced to play on a 4:3 1024x768 resolution monitor.
---
These motherfuckers are crazy, lol.
---
Druids can be a guilds MT. Several guilds did it in vanilla. I think there's a handful of bosses in the whole game where the main OT has to MT but I know several guilds did naxx with a druid MT and I think many guilds had a druid that could main tank  raids somewhere on the roster. 
---
The gear isn't optimal really though. Especially not at first and it would take more work to gear up then a warrior but you can do it for sure.
---
It's not known whether it's automated or not. This guy just has some problems.
---
It was impossible to quantify the difference between having to play with potential lag and having to play with a majority population that doesn't speak your native language, but I think I made a good case for the latter being more invasive and detrimental to the affected playerbase
---
Its really not impossinle to quantify , playing with terrible lag and delay is way worse than not being able to understand people .
---
I have played on SEA severs before where no one spoke english and it was still playable due to low responsive ping .
---
You think server language is more important than ping i say thats bullshit i can play the game without talking i cant play it with horrible lag effecting my gameplay.
---
Its easy to sit there and complain about  language specific servers and talk shit about the oceanic server when you already have a nice smooth 30 ping .
---
Ill make you a deal you have to play on 300 ping servers but you get language specific servers... Bet you will cancel your sub and unistall the game within a week .
---
See you at launch.
---
Zzzzz
---
You’re such a child, and half of your points are just wrong
---
Yeah, can't wait for someone to grab a Black lotus and the other person that was nearby gets his whole guild to report him.
---
This is exactly how it worked in actual vanilla. I think changing it would effect class balance massively, Frost mages would be even better at larg scale pvp for example.
---
- Loot trading online inside of raids **SO THE GM'S DON'T GET CALLED ABOUT MISLOOTED ITEMS ALL THE FUCKING TIME**
---
- Leeway isn't broken, it is how it operated back in vanilla suck it up.
---
- Not BFA client, it's an earlier client (WoD client from memory, not BFA)
---
- Right click reporting again so GM's have less to do.
---
- Auto loot, **BECAUSE THERE'S FUCKING ADDONS FOR IT ALREADY THAT PEOPLE USE.**
---
- Layering because that was better than a 10 hour lineup for a QUEST MOB. Servers back in vanilla housed a fraction of what is going to be playing Classic. To prevent server merges later (that sucked super hard) this was their solution.
---
If you don't like it, go play on a private server and stop bitching.
---
How do i do this?
---
i agree with you about removing legacy code, but the vocal vanilla wow fanatics don't (or didn't at least). that is the problem. yes they probably do host their own servers, but i meant in AWS fashion. i think sharding is proof of that.
---
PvE, no. PvP, absolutely. Rogues received a lot of "buffs" while other classes like Hunters are literally unplayable right now, on PvP atleast.
---
Once I hit 60 I used to solo dungeons, disenchant blues and sell sell sell. I made money super quick that way back in the day.
---
LOL are you not celebrating american indepedence day ? 
---
All my aussie friends cant wait to celebrate independance day . Cant wait for thanksgiving and 4th of july to roll around aswell....
---
90g with rep bonus! ;)
---
Do dem quests mon!
---
There's not much DR you will have to worry about.
---
Roots:
---
- Entangling Roots / Nature's grasp, this is your main DR source, and with both having it not a huge problem.
---
Stuns:
---
- Pounce from cat stealth, doubt both of you would go for a pounce on the same target, stronger to one pounce, the other ravage (rogue ambush) for high damage opener, most people will die before stun is out with both druids on them.
---
- Bash from bearform, 4s stun, again doubt both of you would use this.
---
Not that punishing so don't worry too much.
---
He mentioned that he bought a house for the money. Perhaps not all of it but I doubt all of it is in equities.

All three of those are top-tier for synergy; it's up to you what you want to play.
---
Retail PvP has spiraled into exploiting whatever is busted atm (usually an item from PvE) until it gets patched.
---
They got a lot more bureaucracy now.
---
Oh god please keep BR isolated
---
Dude there’s thousands of us west coasters who will be playing all night long, I wouldn’t worry about. We have a group of almost 100 Oregonians going and alot of us are late nighters.
---
Something certainly has changed, because back then I played with 120+ms ping at all times even living in an east coast city with cable internet. Now it's always 20-30ms.
---
No one will ever believe me but I was teleported here by the first GM I ever talked to
---
I was like 10 or 11 playing vanilla, just a little lad with a dwarf paladin .
---
I don't remember the specific details but I reported something, maybe something stupid not even worth a report but since I was such a noob I probably freaked out over something like selling my shit to a vendor not knowing you could buy it back lol
---
Anyway, the GM whispers me, and remember back then they are all fuckin RP'd up.
---
I tell him what's going on he tells me, ofc in a nice way, that it was a simple fix or avoidable problem and I tell him im new to the game and a lil kid.
---
All of a sudden I get ported from Kharanos to an area that seemed like another world. 
---
It was either a mistake or a tease, cuz I was ported back fairly quickly, but there were at least 10-12 GMs in the area (could tell by their little &lt; GM &gt; badge) 
---
I don't think it was a mistake though because he seemed not to be flustered or try to cover it up, I think he knew it would make me wonder about all the cool looking stuff that was around as well as how cool the GMs themselves looked.
---
After this happened, rememebr I was literally 11, I looked into how to become a GM lmao
---
I tried to apply and everything, thinking it's fine that I was a kid and I'd be able to get around it somehow.
---
The whole thing seems almost surreal, but the whole trying to be a GM thing afterward makes me cringe when I think about it, a brutal, yet nostalgic reminder that this did indeed happen lmao
---
Vic 4 lyf
---
Good
---
Wait wait wait. YOU said to ME "Hope that's not too hard for ya to understand", I repeated it to you. And you edited your comment to make you look like the good guy? Holy shit haha
---
Good luck not pvping, when you try make your way to MC or BWL an good luck not pvping when you try to do a world boss
---
I did.  I had a cable modem.  Good ping, lower up/download.
---
Although you’re correct on much of that, just a small note: briarwood reed is available at launch. That is, unless every source I’ve seen just fails to mention which patch it was added (which is normally an indication it was available at launch). Otherwise, good note on everything else.
---
Someone literally found the code of leeway in the original vanilla wow files that shows it is exactly what is in the pbe right now. It's on the subreddit you can look at it yourself.
---
Arugal Must Die.
---
Love the zone, love the instance.  Love the level range, where every class kinda starts to come into it's own.
---
They nerfed a lot of stuff from Vanilla in TBC . . . world buffs, eng items, tidal charm, etc...
---
Eastern Plague Lands
---
Tracking is great for hunting people in the open world. But rogue and mage have much more control over the fight.
---
Rogue can almost 100% of the time pick their fights. They get caught in a bad engagement, they can usually vanish and get away. Combine this with strong CC's (multiple), you have a really strong class.
---
Mage as well has a number of tools that give them heavy control over combat. Polymorph, frost nova, slows, counterspell. They are quite strong no matter what opponent they go up against.
---
Hunters suffer from deadzoning, as well as heavily reliant on their pet. If you encounter someone who can cc their pet, their damage output drops. As well as their crowd control isn't as strong. Freezing trap is "okay" at best, (need to FD to trap someone), and kiting only gets you so far. Against any kind of caster, you have very limited options.
---
As I said if you want to troll and roll people, rogue is amazing (nothing says jerk like sapping someone 3 times in a row waiting for the DR and doing it AGAIN!) or polymorphing their mob and watching it heal up to full.
---
It's the opposite. Mage CC keeps targets still and/or limits their movement speed. Warlock CC makes targets move around unpredictably at normal run speed and potentially pulls extra packs.
---
Chain. Heal.
---
&gt;Hunters have historically been considered one of the better 1v1 PvP classes on classic servers, with the knowledge we know from the Beta, will this still stand?  
---
Nope. Scatter/freeze DR and melee leeway are big nerfs to them. Hunters go from being a strong all round PvP class to just having a niche in BGs, which is also pretty questionable really with slow batching frost update. They can still mark rogues I guess, but yeah their control takes a big hit and their damage was never that impressive to begin with.
---
How was it never intended? You're literally making that up. Where has blizzard EVER indicated stacking world buffs is not intended? If you give me a link to an official document of blizzard or blue post stating what an exploit is, I will venmo you $20 no question. My word on it.
---
Thx m8
---
He sucks.....
---
I'm not sure what you're saying here. You can go on any private server at the moment and use a powershifting macro. If you start in cat form and try to powershift, then you need to press the cat form macro twice to make it happen. Once to leave cat form, and another to shift back into cat form. This is not happening on beta.
---
Who do you have healing? Smite priests with Lol well?
---
Still doesnt matter, no one remembers leeeway being how it is.
---
Ah the ole im right and bye move, always the main move of an intellectual titan.
---
Another suggestion is to have a level 20 warlock alt so that you can use it as a bank and also as a summoner for raids.
---
&gt;there's old Orgrimmar back
---
Ah, yes, the city made out of sticks and kodo shit.
---
.
---
Roll Alliance.
---
Locking this post at it is going nowhere fast.
---
Layering wouldn’t get rid of the rush to snag your name, customize your toon and login before the large amount of people in your layer get rolling. Layering presumably will have more than just 10 people in your starting area.
---
One of those people is the guy that made this video lol
---
Yeah true. Thx for reply. My thoughts on hunter were  that I wanna use eye of beast in like tanaris, or putting shadowmeld and sending pets to mess with people
---
It doesn't even have to be a popular streamer. I did a pug raid in Legion and got logged off because the Raid Lead told everyone to right click report my name in Discord.
---
I'm confused.. Did they add layering to later levels as well? I thought they said the starting zones and the few ones beyond that only?
---
There's tons of gamer tattoos.  If anyone requires an explanation they're prob not worth talking to about it lol.
---
THIS ISN'T SPELL BATCHING.  Seriously how fucking hard it. The thought behind spell batching is that it would activate, but have a 1-300ms delay depending on where you hit the batch. It not activating at all is something else entirely. Holy shit.
---
Him and Slappa.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m50s) He says he is fine with the 3 hour "squelch", (cannot talk to other players for the most part). So, like I said, the issue is the automatic DC associated with the abuse, not the surrounding stuff.
---
Devilsaur mafia x 100
---
Streamers abusing the shit out of it
---
multiboxers abusing the shit out of it
---
Asshole guilds abusing the shit out of it
---
The fact that automated punishments actually completely screw you over in classic, in retail you can still just queue up for a dungeon or raid and go do it. On classic if you get muted you can't pug anything.
---
you don't have to be the fucking justice cop. Just /ignore someone and move on with your day, Why are you trying to take away someones abillity to speak in a community-oriented game? If someone's being an asshole. Everyone ignores him and the same effect is achieved without having to have big brother step in and stop him like a fucking child in a kindergarten room.
---
This is the correct way to show excitement as an aussie. Fuck yeh kunt. Fuck yeh.
---
Alguem br? Rag best server huehuehue
---
PvE will most likely be unaffected but PvP is a completely different story. Melee classes, especially taurens, have become a lot more powerful against ranged classes with the leeway implementation. Before anyone comments, yes Leeway was in Vanilla but didn't behave in the manner we are seeing now.
---
The added range when in pursuit is a game changer for melee classes. 
---
Hunters are hard to judge atm as they are still buggy as crap. Freezing traps don't activate if you sprint over them, theres a delay with feign death dropping combat amongst other issues. The melee leeway implementation will make things challenging as a good melee player can possibly keep you at the 7yd range, keeping you in your deadzone and just make it a lot more difficult to create seperation to begin with.
---
The potential consequences of these changes CAN (Im saying can, not will) be that a lot more people decide to roll a melee class rather than their original choice, especially on pvp servers. It may have ramifications on both pve and pvp aspects of the game. We will just have to wait and see.
---
You realize that the pirated realms yield like 20 fold more than classic from pickpocketing, yes?
---
you don't have to be the fucking justice cop. Just /ignore someone and move on with your day, Why are you trying to take away someones abillity to speak in a community-oriented game? If someone's being an asshole. Everyone ignores him and the same effect is achieved without having to have big brother step in and stop him like a fucking child in a kindergarten room. Ignore achieves the same effect without the potential for abuse and zealous fucks with justice boners trying to take away everyones ability to speak in an online community game. Trolls are gonna be trolls and are part of the experience. Don't like it just ignore don't fucking get them silenced. Some of us like the open chat where you can say anything without big brother taking over.
---
I suspect (just my thoughts) that with the large spell batching windows, the game runs much smoother when there are large number of players on the screen all casting spells at the same time.
---
I doubt they just added it into the game for no other reason but to have the game feel more "authentic". I bet it has much to do with large-scale combat game responsiveness.
---
????
---
Yeah, I think my heart is set on warrior and I like the playstyle but I keep doubting myself since they can be gimp solo. I love leading 5 man's, I love being competitive on DPS/HPS meters in raids, etc. I should be able to log on and get a couple 5 man's easily while gearing, etc
---
By the looks of it this man was already a grown man with that gray ass beard.
---
You're ok. I had a friend who leveled a subtlety rogue with spi/stam gear.
---
Jaina ain't evil though.
---
I mean she was pretty close to committing genocide after Theramore got nuked, but she *didn't*. Everything else she has done is perfectly reasonable tbh. 
---
I mean the whole imprisoning Sunreaver people was a bit dickish, but expelling them from Dalaran was fair enough at the time.
---
That's basically just screwing ppl.
---
SAME only I turn 25 in August. Just in time to feel even more like an useless NEET. At least I’m employed
---
Excellent points. To expand on the 4th point it's sometimes a good idea to tell your healer to stop doing direct heals as soon as the last mob in the pack dies. At that point they should be moving up to near the next pack and starting to drink. A renew/rejuv should be enough. The tank doesn't have to be 100% hp when starting the next pull, and they can be still drinking while the CC is being executed on the next pack. They only have to get up when either mana is near full or the tank needs healing.
---
This might come across as telling healers how to play but try to suggest it constructively.
---
And real men wear pink.
---
As Styx would say, you have too much time on your hands.

No, sorry.

The NF uptime dream
---
A decent amount of programmers do so they can see large sections of code at once.
---
No it's fine I just turn my phone upside down
---
This behavior is not how the original game was. There are tons of vanilla videos on Youtube that prove that the beta's behavior is bullcrap.
---
Is there a human in the loop?  Yes: Great! Less spam and Nazis.  No: An open invitation for abuse.
---
Does this guy have to play horde 😑
---
I'm curious if combat rogues can pickpocket brd for decent gpm.
---
The only role I haven't done in a competitive raid environment is main tank, and that's more of a guild role than a raid role. As I said, I don't have the time in this stage of my life for that unless I win lotto in the next 7 weeks. There is tons I love about warrior, especially classic warrior.
---
Thanks
---
Who cares what he thinks on it?
---
I pointed you to that video to prove to you that you’re wrong. You do get automatically squelched if enough people report you.
---
Either way it doesnt matter in retail cuz you can just queue up for anything and barely anyone communicates to begin with.
---
Not so much with Classic.
---
3 hour squelch is not fine and will get abused.
---
Ehhh... I gotta be honest, "pretty close to committing genocide" sounds pretty dang evil to me.
---
Are you trying to get to a certain level at a certain speed or something? Why wouldn't you just wait until level 10 for the new gun?
---
This wasn't possible in vanilla. Not an authentic experience.
---
Big roger there
---
Tossing up between spriest / ele shaman and rogue... Mainly for world PvP, solo farming and casual play. I won’t be playing much, so hitting 60 will take a while. I’d love to be good in duels and world PvP. Ele shaman burst looks like heaps of fun.
---
Also, how are these classes dependent on gear? As a casual, I won’t ever have the best gear...
---
Thanks for your help! :)
---
This tourney was fucking crazy, Cdew wrecked ever mage in the beta lmao he didn’t lose a single game
---
God damn. Me and my buds found a way to circumvent this patcher. Purely because it was awful. It was our first run in with torrenting. Thank you to those people who packaged patches and put them online for us to download.
---
Anyone who had sub 100 ping would which is at least 50% but I would not be surprised if it was closer to 70% of the vanilla playerbase. But only a small portion of the playerbase here probably actually played vanilla. It's fine if they think it should be changed but they should stop arguing that nobody remembers it like that or that it wasn't like that and just say it should be lowered because it's just to high atm.
---
&gt;Ah the ole im right and your not move, always the main move of an intellectual titan.  
---
&gt;You're changing the subject because you know your wrong.
---
How ironic
---
&gt; This is the perfect solution   
---
&gt; No solution is entirely perfect 
---
Which is it buddy?
---
Also any "solution" that relies on server merges are automatically garbage. All merging two servers together does is destroy them both
---
Opinions are like buttholes, everyone has one, and everyone else's stinks :)
---
Can't go horde sorry mate, I bleed blue.
---
They had a real bracket running, but they used the box as well for the memes
---
It would be quite hard to lose to a mage.  Elem shaman's burst is insane. 
---
Kind of sad everyone knows that now.  I felt like a special snowflake in Vanilla.
---
Yeah he kinda lucked out dealing basically just mage, which he said was the class he was focused on beating since ven won last time.
---
yeah nice try peasant
---
The only thing that ruined it was people being attention whores and blocking the interviews and messing up duels
---
I hope we all do
---
Is it though?
---
She stood there pissed off and ready to do it, and got talked down.
---
If she was actually evil, she wouldn't have listened to reason.
---
Early vanilla I used to use a Druid to heal a hella geared rogue solo rattlegore I think, he drops a sinew used for a cloak maybe? Guy paid me 50 gold per run. Dahis, was one of the top rogues on the server. I think he became a leet warrior in arena later.
---
Perfect with two stealth classes. Need to be careful though, skellies can see through stealth pretty far!
---
I’m 29, married, no plans for kids. I spent a *lot* of time in high school playing WoW and played on/off in college (haven’t played in 5-6 years?).
---
I remember the first few years of WoW being very much about the social aspect and exploring the world. I’d spend hours with people I met through the game running around strange worlds with “??” level mobs, trying to jump onto ledges and hills we knew weren’t meant to jump on, trying to find entrances to places, etc. It wasn’t rushed or about being maximally efficient or whatnot. Just exploration and socializing.
---
I remember in the latter years that I played the sense of adventure was completely lost. Players seemed more hardcore and concerned with maximizing DPS, having the best gear, leveling as quick as possible, getting through raids and instances as quick as possible, etc. I got swept in it too and would try to get into the best guild possible for raiding purposes, and would obsess over my DPS stats and whatnot.
---
I don’t think I’ll ever play WoW again, but I hope some of that early magic and sense of adventure/exploration returns, and that players who weren’t around 15 years ago (or whenever it was) can experience that for the first time.
---
I wish we had Ghostcrawler back. The concern is fair and reasonable. I agree it is bullshit the way it is handled right now. But I also labor under the suspicion that the people in charge of these decisions are not stupid, and if presented with evidence that abuse is occurring that they will revisit the way it is handled in classic. I also hope they are intelligent enough to act on these things before abuse occurs, but the radio silence on layering abuse does not prove encouraging.
---
How could I not be hyped for Vanilla-lite Classic when there is layering, auto squelch, sharding, loot trading, incorrect animations, leeway to Africa, incorrect PvP mechanics such as walking through Blizzard and not get slowed thanks to the properly functioning spell batching???
---
Nights in vanilla were actually DARK too so that’s gonna be fun.
---
who benefits?
---
Solely tauren warriors?
---
it also means you can hit them from farther as well.
---
Vanilla doesn't have rated PvP, it has premade dodging. The people who use full engi consumables for PvP spend their time figuring out how to avoid fighting others with full engi consumables rather than how to avoid their traps.
---
I'm going to miss the wild wild west of the private servers.  Ignore exists and is all you need.
---
Ok can someone explain what I’m looking at here
---
That's genius. I'm doing that now, thanks for the idea :D
---
the slow from frostbolt might be disableing his leeway

Can we stop listening to that entitled ass clown? All he does is find something to complain about. It’s beta, ffs.

Except you are advocating for a safe space of your own because you are triggered by Nazis and the n word.
---
That's not a single target though. Also it's not "just so they could proc snares+frostbite" if he's getting one or more rogues out of stealth with it.
---
When you walk over to kill one same level mob in a quest, you can all put the same dot on it and it is not really going to be alive long enough for you to really be concerned with any diminishing returns.
---
Yea.
---
Layering was my only concern. Sounds like it SHOULD be phased out(see what I did thar?) by endgame. Everything else is meh. Original wow had weird PVP interactions that didn't really get cleaned up till Arena in BC.
---
Can you please only respond to these threads and these comments so that the specific people who need to see this message actually see it?
---
Are we really that much better to hang with mate :P
---
Yes, that's how I do it. 
---
There is a forced cooldown between switching stances, so accidentally switching twice shouldn't happen.
---
It might take some time to get used to, but once you do it works fine.
---
You missed a lot of the early no changes threads then, the only reason people aren't complaining about it now is because there's no indication we're getting them after the beta became a thing so there's no reason to complain. Achievements are a huge negative.
---
Seeing this image allowed me to remember how our family computer room smelled 13 years ago
---
Whether or not blizzard holds these events, we as players can organize our own events. And back in Original Classic, before the days of achievements and a mountain of collectible items, reputation on a server was the primary take away from PvP events.
---
I accidentally opened it today when trying to click on the exe for my p server 1.12 client. Hadn’t seen it in over a decade.
---
I paid 15 dollars to play the 2 day stress test and I'll be spending another 15 to get my name/s. Idgaf.
---
As if that ever really comes to be the case with any game.  Some things might get adjusted, but why wouldn't they continue testing POST fixes to make sure they are working as intended?
---
The reason a company might decide to stop a test like this, would be to play the PR game leading up to release.  I imagine much of the work is going to take place post release, if they even intend on truly fixing them at all.
---
This was fantastic news to wake up to, literally the best news out of Blizz since the beta/stress test announcement.
---
You gotta have a strong personality to get something like this, you wouldn’t be able to.
---
LUL Neatherwind looked like ASS SHIT
---
BFA is an absolute blast. So is classic. Every expansion was a ton of fun. The fact that you are so burned out at this point that you are calling name reservation a scam is your own problem.

Why are you saying this on every comment
---
&gt; Maul is the highest threat per second ability in the game.

according to a pirated server.

---
I will be able to play more hours now then I ever could have as a kid. I think Classic will be better than vanilla for me. The fact that my two best friends will be playing with me is icing on the cake. Never been this excited for a video game.
---
&gt;none of the things that the sucessful ones did
---
this just in: blizzard has shut down wow classic and decided to give the server-side code to a bunch of shady russians that will exploit it and the players.

Yea this is just a shitty guide all around. Dude is just spreading hot garbage misinformation.

This is the Manaweave Robe. I have bested and contained the Arcane Rifts in Alchemist End. I have sealed mana wraiths out of the great bar inside the mage quarter. These robes are L33T

Normally I'm a cake kinda guy, but if it has layers, gtfo with it
---
fairly sure me saying i cancelled the leave i had booked for launch was a good hint that ws exactly what im doing.
---
but hey be salty that someone doesnt share your opinion!
---
Awesome job by all of those guys. It is moments like this that will be remembered throughout not only WoW history, but gaming and eSport history. Inspiring, to say the least.
---
Something something depends on the people you choose to play with or Raid with or join a guild with
---
I plan to defend red ridge from horde who think they can encroach on Alliance territory. They never expect the 60 rogue to come defend the low level zone.
---
that is a really well done tattoo
---
I remember when hunters tried doing this for a couple months early in vanilla.  They frickin sucked and were just dead in the water.  Yea, you might be able to cheese a rogue here and there, but you would get absolutely destroyed by a warrior and any caster in the game.
---
Just like the first time.
---
I’ve been absent on these servers for quite some time,  did people actually think this wasn’t a thing in vanilla??  And if so how did no one find it in one of the most popular vanilla series ever LOL
---
I bet you feel silly! Muhaha
---
Addons, macros, console commands, and UI tweaks will be done during the stress test if possible.  I will not be leveling professions other than Cooking and First Aid until I'm 60.  The 1-10 time is generous because it assumes launch night.  If I were to level sometime after launch, my estimate would be around 2 hours.
---
In a similar boat. I prefer the horde races but i prefer the alli starting zones...
---
"if they are looking for a challenge" well, they aren't. The vanilla PvP system is pretty good at making challenging fights a timesink compared to stomping, so they will be stomping. I don't know why you're disputing this behaviour when it's literally all we've saw in vanilla and it's all we see on private servers. Farming honor is the name of the game and stomping is significantly better honor/time.
---
Unfortunately they cannot erase your first experience from your brain.
---
No lvl 50 testing?
---
Shit I wanted to know if class quests were available in the sunken temple. :(
---
There's so much evidence that Blizzard is wrong this one time that I hope they take a second look.
---
Pretty sure mages outright sold food/water in cities back then.  I didn't tip so much as I paid the fee.
---
15000 was not a true classic experience.Nost was not a true classic experience.
---
Nice try, but first you'd have to prove that latency noticeably improved in past 15 years.
---
The devs directly said it? Where? You keep saying this over and over and refusing to provide a source. I can't imagine why unless you're making this mythical developer statement up to sound more credible
---
You're clearly not supposed to jump a wall and escape before starting AB, there's no parallel to world buffs.
---
 Very nice post, I just have to ask.... does it matter? 
---
Just asking... because I could literally argue the difficulty of raids, the meta of what class is better at pvp, and so many other things off the difference of modern computers today.
---
Hi 60.  the 1-10 time is generous because it assumes launch night.  if i were to level sometime after launch, my estimate would be around 2 hours., I'm dad.
---
1. If it is Blizzlike, what is there for #nochanges folk to be?
---
2. The #nochanges community has been vocal in questioning whether or not it is Blizzlike.  Not necessarily that leeway exists, but the extent to which it does.  Keep in mind this is a mechanic is not fresh in our minds from P servers, and we're remembering how it worked 15 years ago on laggy computers.
---
Right. I mean if we want to get down to it “as intended” is technically however it is in retail. We’re talking about an iteration of the game that lasted about two years out of 15. The game has been given many iterations to get to where it is, for better or worse. But mechanically, in my opinion, it’s never been better than it is now. With the exception of the ability lag bug many people are experiencing this expansion.
---
frostbolt in raids are true. you also will need to buff, open portals and make food constantly, you will feel like a vending machine after a while, no joke.
---
absolutely solid in pvp against a lot of other classes.
---
priest is a healing class in raids, imo the best healer and ppl will want to be your friend for BGs, dungeon, an raids. but you will be a fulltime healer, respeccing is not really an option in classic.
---
so farming is a problem if you are gonna do it solo.
---
I'm serious about neither. I will do both and have fun.
---
How is it a nerf. Nothing has been changed since vanilla, it’s just the same.
---
It would be a buff if they changed it, but it’s just neutral now.
---
Congrats aussies and to the people who live in the shire.
---
Because goddess forbid you create the petition first, post it here, then have to go through the soul crushing depression when only three people sign it.
---
&gt;I don't care what anyone says, you should not be able to run through a trap or a blizzard.
---
Go back and play retail then.
---
Fog helps alot with atmosphere.  The right color hues make each zone have a particular feel.
---
How stupid are you? How do you think you get squelched in BfA? By being right-click reported for spam.
---
The fucking FAQ is called the squelch FAQ.
---
Forget where i saw it but i am pretty sure a good few months ago it was said that if they did have this in classic it will have a human element behind it  to prevent what ppl think will happen
---
You can't do that through official Blizzard approved means. If you do it through any other means you're an a******.
---
&gt;literally unplayable
---
I don't think either of these words means what you think it means
---
Actually I am. I wanna get it on my forearm. After voting yes for 14 years I can’t imagine changing my mind within the next 14
---
Sneak into opposing factions city, bring gnomish mind-control helm, wait for the opportunity that leads to the most chaos.
---
At level 40, mages have no chance in winning
---
Not really.  Still got to do a lot of PvP whenever I wanted.  There were always some people running around flagged, and the typical hot spots like crossroads and such were always active; cities were also getting raided reasonably often on my server as well.  
---
Bottom line is that if you want the danger and potential annoyance aspect of ganking/camping, then PvP will always be more exciting.  For me, I never liked being camped, and I had no desire to do it to others, so PvE was my pick.
---
Great answer.
---
True
---
Lmao
---
Layering is temporary.
---
No, because Blizzard knows they are wrong about not implementing one but are too afraid to say so.  The pop that wants an rp-pvp is basically double that of the ones that want a traditional rp-pve server...
---
Nothing. Every lesson was a joy in classic. It was only in future expansions that lessons were hard learned, such as burnout being directly under my own control and directly affecting my enjoyment of the game.
---

Clip of the interview!
---
For sure MT takes a lot out of you, takes a special kind of person to devote that amount of time.
---
Hope you have a good time playing a DPS warrior!
---
Only if you were still on Dial-up / shitty DSL / or long range from the servers. In that era you already had ppl getting pings in the teens depending on what they had and where they were located.
---
Silverpine and Ashenvale are my two favorite zones. Great music that matches the zone perfectly.
---
I was a part of multiple expansion beta tests, didn't get one. Didn't care that much. They let a bunch of streamers in to build hype, and a small collection of subs to find bugs.
---
If you want to play vanilla that bad private servers exist.
---
Ah, nice. That's the piece of the puzzle I've been missing (like I said, haven't played much of 8.2 yet.)
---
&gt;I thought a Warrior could use a bow for more than just auto-attack/pulling.
---
They can't use it even for auto-attack. The only class that can auto-attack with ranged weapons is the Hunter.
---
Free speech doesn’t apply to hate speech, now fuck off loser.
---
&gt; It was never gatekeeping, what the hell is even wrong with you types. It was literally just a phrase that united the entire Classic community
---
Nah. #Nochanges cultists never were and never will be the entire Classic community. Just a vocal minority repeating stupid things they heard on youtube.
---
&gt; Like 90% of the people here that like to take regular shits on people who say no-changes were literally no-changes people themselves not even that long ago.
---
I have been saying #nochanges was self-contradictory, idiotic, disingenuous and harmful to the game from the very beginning.
---
&gt; The gas-lighting on subjects like this is getting old as fuck.
---
"Everyone was united behind #nochanges and #nochanges was never gatekeeping!" is 100% pure gaslighting fuckery.
---
People organize mass-reports against [random player] out of personal spite and then the game-AI-skynet system purge that player. Basically, there is no human behind the control sticks to actually check and verify if the reports are legit or just organized bullying.
---
This is very outdated thinking. Warriors were uncrushable because of shield block. However, the meta for warriors now is to go Duel wield fury spec for the threat generation. They will also be crit and crushed. Bears deal with it much better through higher armor/health/effective health.
---
Which dungeons?
---
*laughs in 600ms Australian ping*
---
&gt; If you can provided better values for any of the assumptions, please provided references and we can continue this discussion.
---
Nice try #2. Hitchens' Razor.
---
Blizzard needs to operate as a cash machine for bobby-kotic and activision so they cant afford to have actual people to man the controls and check if reports are legit. They let AI-skynet handle that.
---
Anecdote on the blizzard spell in particular: I'd use rank 1 blizzard on my human mage in vanilla to defend bunkers in AV to keep rogues and druids from sneaking in on me. Event with sprint, the undead rogues wouldnt make it half way through before frostbite kicked in.
---
This is akin to saying that blizzard needs to tone down mouse speed internally because the majority of players have better mice these days.
---
meanwhile shamans pop up from the grave and finish your ass off
---
This should be the top comment
---
Bear base threat will be about ~4% less in Naxx gear compared to pservers. Or about 140 AP. This is the difference between having gift of arthas debuff... or not having your Ony buff.
---
[Projecting](https://youtu.be/S4nTC2wc6A0)
---
Mages walk
---
How embarrassing.
---
I think that might be mage, rather than gnome.
---
Mages at that level can very profitably AOE grind. When a person invites you, they are hoping you are not incompetent.
---
So, what are the odds that an incompetent player will accept a group? it's highly likely.
---
What are the odds that a competent player will accept a group? Much much less likely, as a large portion of the competent ones would rather aoe everything down. Really, it's a massively negative value proposition to invite any mage in the open world, because most of the ones you would actually want in your group will turn you down. 
---
People tend to be happy to invite rogues because they already know... rogues benefit from having basically any group member. They are a massively frontloaded instant damage class, that hates taking damage. If you tank any hits, they love it. If you target the same mob as them, they like it. If you target a completely different mob, they are probably okay with it. If you apply any buffs or debuffs that are relevant, they love it. 
---
Really, it's VERY hard to not benefit a rogue by grouping with them.
---
This is very outdated reasoning. Warriors were uncrushable because of shield block. However, the meta for warriors now is to go Duel wield fury spec for the threat generation. They will also be crit and crushed. Bears deal with it much better through higher armor/health/effective health.
---
If there is no actual human person sifting thru the reports then mass-report-AI-ban will be happening all over the place.
---
Have fun with that

If that's the case then the slow from Ice armor should do the exact same thing as well. However it clearly doesn't in the Classic Beta video I linked in the other comment. The NPCs are hitting from like 10yds

This doesn't really matter as much anymore as the meta is shifting towards warriors going DW fury for threat generation.

---
I would not want to play that either.
---
Stop being paranoid instead.
---
Thats been my go to on and off for about 3 years. But i have been on this one server that is fast leveling to really test the classes i wanna play as so i can decide and dedicate.
---
It always baffled me, I mean the community literally has memes about how Ret paladins or Oomkins are so hey guys maybe since we know how bad they are and we know WHY they are bad and we even have a cheat sheet on how to fix them(in the form of TBC) maybe we should, uh... fix them?
---
"NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Right, and telling people that is good. But shadow isn't really alone in that regard and it isn't just those hybrid class specs that have that problem. Want to main tank a raid? Good luck finding a spot. xxLegolasxx looking for a raid group? Sorry, we already got 50 hunters applying, we're full. Affliction lock? Sry, won't happen.
---
What I don't like are arguments like that:
---
a: There are no shadow priests in raids, they don't exist.
---
b: Well, there are a few spots, but getting one will be a challenge
---
a: Lol maybe in fucking nub guilds that'll wipe on Magmadar for a year.
---
etc. You get the point. If people are dealing with absolutes and dismissing other opinions and trying to humiliate other players, it stops being an argument and turns into a shouting match. I'd hate to see that happen here, but the potential is there.
---
I've been playing on-and-off since the 2004 beta and I dont recall ever being able to run thru an improved blizzard, or hunter trap. That being said, I do recall clunky wierd (but also fun) shit happening in vanilla due to batching.
---
My point is, as I said: Batching = absolutely, its  a fun little quirky game mechanic but the window should be smaller.
---
You are correct. It was updated in patch 1.4, but available from the start. 
---

It's so obvious he intentionally show a lot of skin on stream.
---
Wait what? Esfand is as far from hot as you can possibly be
---
Nah. They're still going to be extremely strong, especially in world pvp. Most fights aren't decided due to tiptoeing next to a melee's deadzone. You're kiting them at 41 yards or you're intimidation/scatter + trapping them.
---
Dishonourable kills are only from civilian NPCs like the alliance have in southshore

Then don't play it.

I’d like vanilla to stay vanilla, like blizzard said it would. Players phasing in and out isn’t vanilla. Layer switching mega farming isn’t vanilla. Being able to teleport out of a gank isn’t vanilla. Being the 3001st player to log in and being on a completely dead server for several hours isn’t vanilla.
---
Blizzard should offer non-layered realms with bigger caps, and insert a pop up with a nice big red warning sign you have to “accept”. This would list all the “negatives” of that type of realm. It would of long queue times, sparse living mobs, etc.
---
Let people fucking choose at least. If they want to wait in queue to play a whole server, let them.
---
well thats dumb, unless the tank is getting smashed and requires your full healing attention you should at least throw a hot on them
---
For the Horde!!
---
Honestly, I only just even learned what that was and how to best do it. I avoided WoW until about two months ago because of the addiction I heard so much about. Now I have the addiction, and a lot to learn. I got a little taste of classic during the stress test, and I can’t wait for it. I don’t even care much about min/maxing. I just enjoy running around killing and questing and doing professions for far too many hours at a time.
---
How do you know there are actual blizzard employees checking the bans? Did they start doing it after people abused the click-report? (I havnt played retail wow for a few years now so I have no idea). If there is no person checking the reports, then people in BGs may mass-ban top performing players just for being top-performers, kind-of like how its done in many FPS games these days.

November 30th, 2004, only 25% of US adults had broadband in the home.
---
What about better server hardware? I wonder how much that would matter, either way. Surely the server hardware between 2004 and 2019 is quite different.
---
It was a toggleable option in the menu.
---
Agreed this notion that most of the population was running around on dial up with 200 + ping is ridiculous. Not one person in my guild was on dial up in classic and I'm not doubting that many were, however broadband had definitely taken off by 2005 and cable / dsl was fairly common.
---
With regards to latency, that data is particularly difficult to find. Hence making assumptions for the purposes of starting this discussion. I prompted you to find other resources not because I want to be right or be wrong, but because I want more people bringing information to the conversation and for the discussion to flourish.
---
Y is this so far down. If they "fix" leeway and spell batching we're fucked
---
Compared to few years. 1-2 months are nothing
---
Turn on the profanity filter then
---
Yeah plus the retention rate is very low, but imo that's more of a.reason to find a group you like now
---
That way, they see you're also committed to the guild and weren't just there for the classic hype.
---
Imo a guild is much more likely to treat you better if you're putting in the effort and showing you don't want a carry from them
---
I do agree with that statement. its late, and I dont feel like doing more math. However, to spitball, I'd put 150-200 ms batches up for evaluation.
---
I dont get this video.
---
You are NOT in a duel there. So why should the trap (thats normally invisible) do anything?
---
If this video is a troll: Obviosly worked for a lot people.
---
thanks man
---
As some1 who wont play classic wow I can say that melee leeway is not required anymore in 2019. I have the freedom of objectivity. 
---
Our internet connections evolved and outgrew latency issues which was the sole existence of melee leeway. It made sure players with bad latency could actually do *something* as a melee. 
---
Anyone who disagree with that are either retards or people that benefit from it.
---
Once again no, that's what the frost loves are. As depicted in every novel.
---
I'd be surprised if they haven't done that already. Either now after the testing or before when deciding for the batch size. I hope they are keeping the batch size options open...
---
Most people had sub 60 latency in 2004.it wasnt 1990s.
---
For Elemental at least, you won't have any competition on spell damage mail except from other Shamans. The downside to that is that there's not a great deal of good Elemental mail from raiding until you get into BWL or AQ. 
---
Tier 1 is effectively a healing set, Tier 2 is a bit more friendly. 
---
So if you're looking to fill holes with Cloth/Leather, and when it comes to Trinkets/Weapons, you're more than likely near the back of the queue behind Mages, Warlocks, Priests and Druids.
---
It's not too dissimiliar a story for Enhance - except for Mail your competitor is Hunter, and you're not gonna see much Strength gear there. However if you manage to get a raid spot as Enhance, you may have an easier time getting toward the front of the queue since the gear is your main spec. It'll depend on your guild loot policy I guess.
---
Fair point. But isn't there a moonwell in stormwind?
---
I was horde and we all laughed at him.
---
Yeah Mr. White!
---
&gt;For the era of vanilla, an exceptionally good world latency was ~100 ms with an upper bound on playable of 250-300 ms. 
---
This is unequivocally false and all of your writing is predicated on it. At no point in time in the last 20 years has 100ms been considered good latency in any video game.
---
We need Yugoslavian server now :D
---
I agree with you man. But after reading these comments, it seems like just a bunch of sheep responding. From the business end it's smart, and I bet a lot of people will be suckered into this without even knowing they are being suckered.
---
I believe there's a difference in the amount of communication required in retail vs vanilla.
---
Atleast we know it's here to stay in this form and its a feature that actually got enough attention that we have a fair idea on how it works and will affect combat. As a caster I think its cool to add another aspect of pvp to be mindful of. I see a lot of people saying mages are specifically disadvantaged but I dont see how leeway changes a mage using pom+pyro, MC-helmet, sheep, etc from rolling over people.
---
Honestly I've been testing it out all day today and it's felt great. Ill see where I'm at in classic if it's much different than the private server, but so far I'm loving it!
---
100 milliseconds, not great, not terrible.
---
That would be my hope, but with how frequently I hear complaints about it...Well, this post is the result.
---
Unfortunately, I dont have beta access to go and do any kind of test in game to get performance based stats instead of this speculation. I'd like to give it a go during the next stress test though.
---
When I reactivated it really confused me that this wasn't in the menu anymore. I thought I was going crazy and spent a good 20 mins combing the options.
---
I think it depends on the demographics of the players. I think a lot of older players will join and maintain their sub, but younger players may not be as excited by Vanilla's slow place and leave for BFA or something else.
---
So, since Tauren have a larger hitbox, are they able to heal/cast and can be struck/healed by a further distance compared to other races? Can anybody confirm or test it in beta?
---
Hey guys,
---
im an old guy that played in vanilla a lot. i mained shaman and mostly did open world PvP and the smaller BGs.
---
Even made PvP video.
---
i am thinking of playing a prot Warrior in Classic and maybe look into raiding...rarely did it in vanilla because it was so time consuming and boring.
---
also, even as the stupid clicker kid i was back then, i realised that some PvE players are so bad on a fundamental level, it just baffled and annoyed me to play with them, seeing them slowly burn to death in the aoe fire on the ground /facepalm.
---
so, you think that actually raiding while working a job, having hobbys, meeting friends and having a GF is an option in classic as prot warrior? or is it too time-consuming even with the modern knowledge and skill of the players?
---
i have big hopes that raiding will be so much faster and easier because players are much better then they were back in the days.
---
and playing the shitfest that is retail from time to time shows me that people are indeed playing better.
---
really torn between picking a tank for pve´ing or just picking any good solo DPS class and enjoy the game for what i can make out of it...
---
I am entangled in what profession I am playing.
---
Just so you know there aren’t any lock trainers in darkshore or darnassus. So if you meet him there you would need to run all the way back to the other cities to train.
---
You ever consider that they might be completely full of shit?
---
You know how many times the community has said something about WOW, Activision said, "No, you're wrong. Trust us, we know." And then they turn out to be wrong.
---
It was not like this in the original game. I couldn't consistently melee people from that far away. It's wrong.

Take druids for healing. "They are the worst healer and reasonable guilds bring them only for their utility like innervate, motw and combat rez".
---
Curious, is he still following his old guide or has he updated it?
---
its far down because classic was over a decade ago
---
Implying people who have waited classic for years would not play just because they dont get to speak their mother tongue
---
What? I never knew that. Is the follow up question worth it?
---
Ya....but people aren’t generally going to be tanking molten core as fury. The only reason the fury tank is a thing is to allow dps to go full haam and not worry about pulling threat for speed clears in raids. Most people I don’t think will be aiming for this type of play.
---
It's a ton of xp that you basically get on the side. So it's definitely worth it.
---
Melee leeway, spellbatching window is too high meaning you can easily vanish a death coil, gouge a blink, mouseover macro to not lose combo points, sap/gouge/expose armor procs crippling poison.
---
True! ultimately though people will still go for broken tooth for most things. That attack speed is too sexy. Im just so sad about losing the insanely fast movement speeds, eyes of the beast + the zg bat was immensly fun

&gt;Impact of 20ms vs 120ms latency
---
&gt;I've recently discovered that there's a bank of servers near me with 20ms latency (spikes to 30 on occasion).

Ele shaman gonna get curb stomped at 60
---
Everyone on private servers knows ele shamans are the backbone of horde pvp, enhance is a meme in both pvp and pve.  This is nothing new.
---
How hard is it to not drop N bombs? If players were being banned for being slightly rude I'd agree with you, but that's not even remotely close to the case. If Blizzard allows hate speech to go unrecognized and unpunished on their platform, it's a tacit endorsement of those ideas. They're absolutely right to ban those who can't pass the very low hurdle of "don't use the worst word in the world".
---
If grounding totem wasn't bugged on beta the mages might have a shot, having to wand it down every time after already absorbing a spell looked painful.
---
Is this the one where if too many people report you then you get muted automatically for a bit?  I used to abuse that in tbc I'd spam to get muted then afk in bgs because for some reason if you were muted you were immune to being reported afk.
---
deadzone is still a thing. So 3 more yards. 13+3=16
---
My Ping 2004 was something between 30-50 :D
---
?? We had 10mbit and we could have more. Sweden was known for having amazing connection.
---
Very good pattern, but I think I won't do this :)
---
If you really wanted to be resto for raid healing, go 25/0/26 below. Your primary heal is Healing Touch, all the rest of the healing spells are rarely used, so the spec below buffs Healing Touch in the balance tree by extending your longevity via Omen of Clarity and Moonglow plus Nature's Grace to occasionally reduce cast times.
---

---
Considering that Omen of Clarity is only a free spell every 30 seconds, you could go 30/0/21 and heal raid just fine, while having lots of caster dps when soloing.
---

---
The other common raid healing spec is the 0/30/21 Heart of the Wild spec, where Heart of the Wild gives you a ton of mana to extend healing longevity.
---

---
The reason none of the specs uses more 21 or 26 points in resto is that Healing Touch is the main raid healing spell, easily used 80% to 90% of the time. Thus, it's not worth it to take talents that help out the rarely used spells.
---
in Germany you could buy the "fast path" option from your ISP, which reduced your ping from \~50 to \~20, which was considered mandatory if you were serious about CS 1.6 (most played shooter at that time). So you are correct
---
Hunter?
---
no, what makes you think that?
---
Would it work to put out a warning saying: ‘anyone getting closer than *this mark* will be killed, and having a force from both factions all murder anyone crossing the line?
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, I remember that "too far away" bullshit so clearly as well despite being practically on top of them.
---
&gt;2:10:48
---
I have made many changes to my Horde guide over the last 1.5 years, using much better routes now.
---
I need this but in shaman form. Great job
---
Cdew had something like 2700 hp, and a large mana pool as well, he had a decent chance of just standing still, spamming lightning bolt when the mage comes into range, and casting a heal when he was at 80% and winning that fight. at 40 with that hp a mage isn't beating you in a head on fight, they had to make you commit to big mistakes, just statistically unwinnable unless you basically throw the game. Large hp pools destroy burst classes and it doesn't balance out until 60 with T1/pvp blue or group pvp where being tanky but dealing less damage means you can be ignored more easily.
---
Both players played amazingly well, I think Ven needed to duel more elemental shamans, they are one of the hardest matchups in the game, he also had bad RNG on a few fights, one fight he netted himself after a CS resist IIRC, another fight he was crit 3 times in a row and it basically took him from full to 1%.
---
at 60 you are able to rapidly cc the shaman with blanket CS and open up with a much more dangerous line of burst damage that could kill the shaman before he can react, which is why most will have NS for an instant heal and not elemental mastery for the guaranteed crit.
---
enchance is the least dangerous, resto with good gear was a very fun fight but it was 1 or 2 mistakes from either side autowinning.
---
Happy (Graccu's Mince Meat Fruit)cake day!

Can we please stop this meme? DSL and Cable internet had been around for *years* when WoW launched. People playing on dial-up were already a meme in those days. Sure, there were a significant number of people still using slow connections, but the fact that they were a butt of jokes should tell you how quickly the network situation was changing. "Leeway existed just to compensate for the fact that everyone was lagging" is total bullshit and is, frankly, a big flag that the speaker probably did not play WoW during vanilla.
---
Changing leeway in the way proposed in clearly and unequivocally a nerf to melee classes and a buff to ranged classes and nothing else. It's no coincidence that the loudest voices are people planning to roll mage or hunter.
---
Zug zug
---
Can you point one out?
---
Are you saying blizzard is wrong?
---
O.K  but you will never get a full tier set.
---
Less so than enhancers.
---
Elementals will learn their role as support, drop totems, purge for possible 1300damage per purge, nuke hard in burst windows.
---
Enhancers are 100% deadweight.
---
Elementals can be countered but by casting from 30yards they arent as easily curbstomped as 300damage white hitting enhancers.
---
Absolutely nothing. Kiting will be exactly the same it was in vanilla: very powerful. Anyone telling you otherwise just wants it to be even more OP.
---
There are aspects of the beta that lag but none of them have to do with spell batching. The most vivid example in peoples' mind is Blizzard - but that has absolutely nothing to do with spell batching, and neither does any other
---
In my opinion, if you’re going to be mostly pugging then tanking should be fine, you’ll always be In high demand.
---
But, if you’re going to join a guild there’s only a couple tanking slots and the tank is generally the only roll where if you don’t show up, the other 39 people probably can’t raid that night.
---
If you want schedule flexibility I don’t think a tank is a good idea. A healer or preferably dps would be the best.
---
With a spellbatching window that high you'll feel like you're playing on 400ms anyways.
---
Scatter/freeze DR. What exactly is this? They shared DR in vanilla but did not in private servers (and people remember private servers), or what? Im lost on this one. But if they are working as in vanilla then its no way a nerf, the basis cannot be private servers. OR if they are working incorrectly, then a quick fix will solve this until 27 August.
---
yes
---
windfury totem competes with air totem (+21 agility I think) .
---
basically if you're melee, try to NOT get grouped with hunters or rogues in raids because they will want the agility totem
---
Mine is that one in Badlands when you ride the motorbike.
---
Nice leveling plan.  
---
Got a link to the UI setup checklist console commands and macro's etc?
---
Classic will have tons more casuals than private servers.
---
Pro: leveling in a group environment turns you from zero to hero real quick. Paladin shines as a support for other classes (duo leveling to 5man)
---
Yeah I’m trying to find a new job and move out lol, I made some stupid mistakes that landed me in this situation, hoping that I can change it soon, going to be hard with Classic now though lmao.
---
*Everyone disliked that.*
---
i think i was level 25 on my first character before someone told me that it was wrong to chose my armor based on Armor value.
---
If that's what you think, hope I see you on your ret paladin.
---
BC is actually a better game, and no major content was removed. 
---
WOTLK + original Naxx 40 would actually be my ideal WOW iteration.
---
They didn't start really gutting shit until Cataclysm.
---
If you can cycle them possibly, still a huge tax when you could be saving those for a healer or two.
---
Easier with a warrior who can self-breka fears!
---
I too am glad Cdew did the shaman community well but the rest sounds crazy. Yes alliance have an edge in BG's as always but horde players know ele is godly. It's great for PvP early in the expansion.
---
Horde feels like an adventure, it's you against the world. Alliance feels like you're cleaning up your own shit.
---
I think I can find 4 more to have our very own 40 man raid
---
It’s an entertainment product. If I want any sector of the economy to market to me—it’s entertainment. I don’t care about insurance, craftsman tools or diabetes pills. 
---
It’s also an entertainment product...where else should I spend my disposable income, what’s a worthy expenditure for me to make in your eyes?
---
I think OP means you should only kill them where they are located on a site. Perhaps like an excavation camp?
---
Correct, being able to hit the armor cap REALLY helps with this.
---
And you are correct, crush cap is because of shield block, hitting it on cooldown helps. The crush cap is block + dodge + parry added together, must equal out to 100%.
---
You say that but beside the Forsaken they make a nice partner to that story line. Besides, alot of Thralls horde was about accepting the outcast and survival. After the many stabs in the back the Blood Elfs got from Lordaeron  and Dalaran they definitely wouldn't work with the Alliance so their choices were Horde or bust (it helps Sylv was for the horde at the moment) and yeah the thing about forsaken being exlordaeron is there, but they're lead by a Belf essentially so it's a weird situation. Also, I never got the idea that the Alliance it "rotten underneath" they seem as goody two shoes as i gets but I don't play ally so I don't know nor care too much. Either way, I like the contrast of elves in the horde, it's far more unique and interesting then sticking them with humans for "muh lotr"
---
I plan on playing horde dum dum
---
Forsaken has the best classes, voices, animations, city, music, lore and the best looking character models. Sylvanas is the best leader. Undercity/Orgrimmar and  Tirisfal Glades/Barrens/Crossroads music is way better than any Alliance music. Alliance players are jerks, Horde players have honor. Shamans are cooler than Paladins.

I feel...negativity
---
Exactly, my ping has remained the same over the years, usually between 40-80 ms. The only time it was worse was when i was on a mobile connection.
---
Watch the leeway video, Tauren range is increased, it’s around 10 yards melee. Even if you take the high end of the estimate and assume 11 yards, it’s 11+3, so 14 yards is the END of the deadzone.
---
So in the worst possible scenario, as in tuarens, both moving, the min range would be 14.000000001 yards.
---
I ended up spending all night updating my Durotar guide by taking out the "Need for a Cure" quest, since it is not working the way vanilla wow had it.  It took a lot longer to do than I thought as there was a lot to it.  There may be a short stream like 12 hours from now.  I got lots of holiday stuff coming up over the next few days, but I should get the run finished well before the beta ends on the 12th.
---
I'm quite torn between levelling a Warrior or a Hunter. Hunter has loads of good utility and was the second class I ever made in wow. Warrior however, was the first class I ever played and levelled at all. So I'm looking to recreate him in canill
---
Pro: Historically there’s far fewer druids in raids, so far less gear competition. I’ve heard of druids getting geared out in mc/BWL in a matter of weeks.
---
Pro: Tons of different specs to try out and play with that are hybrid based
---
Con: these specs are generally for pvp purposes. If you want to raid you’re gonna be healing or playing as a token cat dps with an apparently god awful rotation to pull off.
---
Con: people will always judge your class as the worst healing spec, no matter if you’re a healing god.

You probably won't get any BiS gear for enhance but you will get BiS weapons. No real guild will give you a crown of destruction but there are a ton of 2h weapons that are pretty terrible for warriors. Even something like hand of rag will go to a shaman over a warrior since its not terribly slow. Also if you get rank 10 in pvp you'll have decent gear to BG with.
---
Sub is 18.99 CDN
---
yeah 12 yards isn't right. It is supposed to at 2 (or apparently 2.6666 from that guy that looked at the game code) yards to melee range (which is 5 yards normally) when both targets are moving. To account for client to server to client lag in pvp
---
As a level 50ish warrior, I was having a difficult time in Un'Goro. My smartass decided it was time to reward myself so I went over to the auction house, bought the entire chromatic set (+resistance to all) using most of my gold. It looked pretty sweet in my defense. Went back to Un'Goro and died to the first normal mob because i had ZERO stats.
---
People still want spell batching and leeway and it has been present on the majority of private servers too but Its TUNED to 2019 and the batch window and melee leeway range is Much lower and feels much better to play than what is in classic beta now..
---
If they dont change it pvp will be even more stupid than ever ..
---
Or people like my dad who never learned it in school, never needed it in life and doesnt need it for anything but EU wow Servers, but play wow like a Religion for 15 years
---
Holy is top dog for paladin plain and simple, but once you get some good gear ret is more than viable in pvp, specifically with engineering. 
---
Just remember you aren’t a warrior (although if you go reckoning it does play more similar to warrior) you provide rng burst and support with BoF BoP and dispel. Not to mention Blessing Of sacrifice placed properly means you can’t be sheeped or ccd properly.
---
Personally I’ll be raiding as holy, and premade pvping as holy, but once I get some gear I’ll be going ret now and again to fuck up some random bgs/world pvp
---
Light be with you.
---
I remember doing shadowfang keep a shit ton back then, it was so quick to farm and id just do it over and over again. I remember doing some of the higher lvl dungeons but they took longer and the payout/time wasn’t as good as sfk so I just stuck with that.
---
&gt;~50 to ~20, which was considered mandatory if you were serious about CS 1.6 (most played shooter at that time). So you are correct
---
This, this, and this. Anyone who played CS in 2005 knows that anything over 50ms was completely unbearable. People wouldn't even scrim on your server if they saw 60ms

Cat dps.... my hand hurts thinking of it again. (But hey a level 40 blue leatherworking head is BIS forever!)

Really cool, I made my own phase 1 item progression for the leveling process and this helps for endgame, thanks!

Well like the idea that alliance will have better BG's because of streamers or the idea that the paladins will play their roles and shaman will go enhancement. None of that makes any particular sense which is what I meant by crazy. Some people obviously will think enhance is the better pvp spec but no more than rets for the alliance.

GOOD. The fucking Russians can fuck off on a server by themselves

Assuming you're not using 100% of your bandwidth, which was the case for any 2006 video game running over a shit DSL connection, your latency has almost nothing to do with the connection from your home to your ISP. 
---
Latency is mostly related to physical distance (light can only travel so fast) and to the time a computer needs to process data packets traveling in between network nodes. It's also worth noting that those 2 factors are correlated, since the number of network nodes usually increases with distance. 
---
In terms of network infrastructure, I haven't seen any huge technological leap in the last 15 years responsible for lowering network latency to the average consumer in any meaningful way. 
---
The only major change we had in recent years came from software developers incorporating network optimizations into their software since most operating systems at the time optimized their TCP/IP settings for file transfers and not for games or real time audio/video.
---
Despite my connection having almost 200 times more throughput now comparing to 2006, my latency to the game servers only got worse, mostly due to the fact that the realm I play got moved to another data center.
---
Garithos did nothing wrong.
---
People are WAY to bothered by what other people are doing or not doing....noone cares.
---
As long as I have fun, I'll play it.
---
No. How is this so hard to figure out for you? It's a change to have leeway in the game even though it was in the game back then, and it's 'nochanges' to remove leeway - because INTERNET CONNECTIONS are better than they were back then. To replicate the same PvP gameplay from vanilla WoW, a mechanic that existed then needs to be removed.
---
Posted because some German guy the other day was *convinced* there wouldn't be Classic Oceanic Servers
---
my ping got worse from 2004 to 2019.  
---
with an added option to my 2004 16mbit line, called "fast path" (which is nothing else then turning interleaving off), I had arround 10 to 20ms.  
---
now with 50mbit in 2019 (with no way to turn interleaving off) I get 40-60ms.
---
bandwidth increased by a lot, latency did not.  
---
fuck right off mate
---
Hehe, have an upvote
---
First time I tried to get into Undercity (as a noob Orc) I could not find any entrances at all. Elevator was too hard to figure out.
---
Probably not since they aren't adding the original epic mounts. But maybe.
---
You will absolutely be auto muted. It just takes more reports than on retail.
---
They are doing Internal testing for 40-60 content
---
So keeping the reporting system hurts no one but yes if they keep auto squelch that will be problematic. What you deem to want is a time machine and that just isn't happening. You can't change progress you can only go with it or avoid it.
---
People won’t realize how truly terrible this is until guilds competing for world bosses / world firsts mass report each other to fuck each other over.
---
Or until a streamer gets his sperg army to mass report a dude ganking him.
---
It will 100% happen. This shit will make the game so much worse.
---
How will it change warlocks?
---
This is how you draw people to your channel, that was great lol
---
So how does it work? Will the players be able to choose a server that they like? My friends and I live in different language regions, and we'd obviously still like to play together rather than be "distributed" across the locale-specific realms.
---
Many people will say paladin is one of the most boring classes, but honestly I couldn't disagree more.
---
Paladins are incredibly versatile, you can do healing, dps and tanking. During the levelling process you also don't see the problems the tank and dps specs have at max level, though tanking requires your group to paly a little differently.
---
You can usually handle 2-3 mobs at the time due to having so many tools available. 
---
Straight up solo levelling might be a bit boring, as you want to play mana efficient and so it usually ends up being putting oyur seal up and waiting for the mob to die. But I don't think that's a whole lot different from eg a mage, who just casts frostbolts and maybe a fire blast until the mob dies. With a ret spec and a decent weapon mobs die pretty fast too.
---
so tauren hitbox is as intended? i saw them in some clips hitting from 10-12 yards away.
---
also quick question, How would this affect the tauren hunter deadzone ?
---
More work?
---
Launch day is also my 39th B-Day!
---
but doesn't that also remove the deadzone for the cow hunter?
---
That makes no sense at all. By what logic was vanilla WoW not intended to be playable for forever? Every game is designed with that in mind.
---
OP is definitely a virgin.
---
Oh sup FMG/FC guildie
---
also if a person follows this guide and does serpent + arcane + whatever on each mob, gonna be oom very fast
---
What do you mean by how? Do you mean what should you prioritise? If so, then while leveling invest in the beast mastery tree. You will basically have your own tank keeping aggro on mobs while you shoot away-it makes for a very efficient leveling experience.
---
Once you hit 60 and start doing instances or even raid and your gear improves then you should consider investing more in the marksmanship tree. You can always go for a 20/31/0 spec as its still great for grinding/farming (and is considered to be the best raiding build with the caviat you can keep control of your pet/keep it alive) or you could go for a 5/31/15 or 0/31/20 (especially if you need the extra +3% hit surefooted offers).
---

---
I just want the rat catcher flute from the tram. Hope they haven't patched it out!
---
This is good. More shamans to the release means more wf totems for me
---
Ooft. Bit of a shit time tbh. Will be really hard to get a guild that raids at those times. Good luck though bud hope you find one! :)
---
Link me too please!
---
For sure, [this](https://youtu.be/gKx3qqbdMfY) video is a bit boring but I really recommend the talent build he goes if going on a pve server. It will make your leveling experience much better! Good luck!
---
better
---
It really depends on your play style. The 1st link looks good. I can't open the 2nd link so I can't tell you anything about it.
---
Most important thing in the leveling phase is to learn to control your pet and to learn your rotation. Always start with an autoshot, then weave your abilities in between two autoshots.
---
And tame pets to learn higher rank abilities as soon as possible. You can find which pet has the abilities you want on 
---

Yer, it's a bit of a pain. Over the years retail has had a few, down too one that I know of now, was hoping classic might be different.
---
I would focus on my life and getting a job in your situation. Classic isnt going anywhere
---
I'm like so confused...most of the pvpers are going horde and have been raving on forever about them because of better pvp radials.
---
Australian here who did arena in WotLK with 300-600 ping on a US server. In vanilla I would have had worse. In 1998 I would have been lucky to have 3000ms. Now I have 20-30.
---
Agreed. If it's used RESPONSIBLY with humans involved who have some common sense, then it's a good feature. But it is definitely a pandora's box if they automate too much of it
---
Paladins are also vastly easier to play than shamans, but they don't have as high skill-ceiling. So if you really want to learn how to master a class then go with the shaman, if you want an easy time with great results go with the paladin.
---
At least 21 shit a week... What

---
I appreciate you taking time to respond back, and you bring up several great points I'd like to answer. I can sometimes be long winded but if you do have a chance to read through my post and take a stab back, I'd love to hear your thoughts. The 'nuance' bit will be more apparent at the end. If I just can't stop myself typing (because this shit is interesting to me, yo!) I totally understand and will try and simplify with the bullet points at the bottom.
---
&gt;You are very clearly communicating that you believe there was talk of the vast majority not wanting this old game which Brack did not. Brack stated very absolutely that anyone present or watching who was wondering if they might do legacy servers did not actually want that. 
---
I'm slightly unsure of the tail end of this sentence, but I assume you're implying that the vast majority of players **hadn't** come forward and said *"I don't want to play vanilla WoW"* and that Brack **couldn't** have had that information, because the players didn't do that?  
---
I won't dive too far into this, as I'm not 100% if that was your intent. However, if that's the correct interpretation, then the players *have* come forward, in the **millions** and claimed they didn't want the inconvenient mechanics from Vanilla. 
---
This can be complicated to attempt to explain in a short amount of words, so I'll try to keep you for as long as I can. As I said in my previous post, Product makes decisions leveraged upon tangible data and understanding the 'why' instead of relying on actual worded response when dealing with a user group. Humans, and more specifically, gamers, are notoriously bad at providing quantifiable feedback. How many times have you seen players mention something like "LFR is **shit**" or "arcane mage is **good**" or "current lore is **bad**"? All those words and terms are meaningless without context. So we instead will use other 'identifiers' to help gather and aggregate the data to find out what the person actually feels. Those examples I mentioned above? Here's some fake data behind those players: Players that participate in Normal Raid *and*queue into LFR while using blue weapons are more inclined to dislike LFR if they do not receive at least one weapon per lockout.  Players that participate in arena bracket 1300 through 1800 and play Shaman think arcane mage have no counters. Players that have purchased multiple warcraft books from the shop, *except* those written by Chrstie Goldie do not like current lore. 
---
Those three comments made by three different players have helped fill out the player behavior (called a user persona) when you have millions of players providing tangible, quantifiable information from metrics, you can start to build out a matrix of what players want and don't want. Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this, and how it'll come full circle.
---
At the **time** of the statement, the vast majority (and I use the word in it's true meaning) of players have communicated via **action** that they did not want vanilla wow. The data showed that almost all players that participated in dungeons would use the LFG tool INSTEAD of going to a town and using /2 to look for a tank. 
---
Why do you think Blizzard adds store mounts? They have all those thousands of data points where they can say the **vast majority** "while some users complain about them, or make a youtube video in spite, the average user will continue to play, and we gain a net positive" 
---
**tl;DR starts here:**
---
Okay, hopefully you've stuck around this long and I can make the rest short and sweet, although it's going to taste like poison. 
---
1. As far as Brack's concerned, the only thing that matters is what the vast majority of users have identified as objects of retention and acquisition. Niche holds weight, but nothing compared to the larger demographics.
---
2. Opportunity cost must be managed and weighed based on the tangible data *available at the time of the decision*, weighed against the usergroup's **proven** wants. For all intents and purposes, the niche *doesn't exist*. Otherwise you're now applying needless risk that investors do not want. 
---
3. Just because you or your peers are directly affected, doesn't mean you or your peers are in a majority demographic that the company has deemed worth salvaging. 
---
4. The phrase "Vote with your wallet" is actually true and terrifying. However, those that collect the dollars from your wallet know that humans are more bark than bite, and the majority of the will bend the knee (risk matrix to determine if it's worth the move if it's a PR nightmare)
---
Now that you have the context behind my thought process, I can finally answer your response. 
---
The reason J Allen Brack was and is correct is because the data he had at the time showed that the majority of players (at least in early 2016, in WoD) showed that he was correct. Are there outliers? Of course, there's always going to be outliers, people have been playing private servers since TBC. Hyperbole is hyperbole. When addressing a question in public should you be aware and considerate to those outliers? Absolutely, which is why I said the entire thing was a media training gaff. Data changes over time, and more importantly, you gain more precise data as you start to learn what to look for. 
---
When the server N was taken down, and Blizzard flew out the developers, do you know what the majority of what was discussed was? Metrics. Proof of user data. Validation for a niche demographic that Blizzard realized they could actually get back at a much lower opportunity cost than expected (thanks Omar!) Why do you think Classic WoW is labeled as a project instead of a property during investor calls? 
---
Note that this isn't exclusive to Blizzard, or the games industry, this is almost every single company that operates under the profit motive and wants to grow. It's not inherently evil, or wrong, because they're just attempting to provide the greatest amount of value (called value proposition) to the greatest amount of people at all times.
---
**super duper tl;dr:** If you give a navigator a mislabeled map, but he follows it correctly, he's not wrong if he ends up in a different spot than you intended.
---
That assumes that a person is checking the legitimacy of the reports. If it is all automatic, there may be openings for abuse.
---
The SM7B is not $1200
---
Take your time. Classic is so much more than an endgame rush. Its prob the perfect game for you tbh.
---
I find heavy handed spell batching very disappointing from a gameplay perspective, same as the leeway issue. Nothing game breaking but over the years WoW became very, very responsive and slick input-wise. I stopped during Cata but by that point the character control was on point, servers reacted speedily and everything felt super fluid.
---
I get the point, these mechanics are *accurate* but due to tech improvements, they actually detract from how *authentic* the gameplay is, as well as being the simple straight, forwards downgrade from modern systems.
---
Like I said nothing game breaking but given the choice between actual straight up 1.12 vs "1.12 in the modern client with modern infrastructure and responsiveness" vs "1.12 in client with a hacked together and less fun simulation of the old lag" I'm choosing the option with the best gameplay, modern client with it's upgraded features, then actual vanilla, then a little way down the line, what we're actually getting.
---
btw the old blizz downloader is still working
---
Ahh, good to see I'm not alone.
---
I love it:)
---
That explains why I'm still farming STV and haven't found it yet...
---
Why would you give trash water to your allies in a bg? That stuff is crucial to winning.
---
I can raid on schedule, it's just my four work days  will either have to be early morning or mid day, or find a guild that raids wed/thur/fri anytime on those days.
---
Don't let me catch you on that path from Aerie Peak I defend my dwarven brothers as they sheltered my people in a time of need
---
For the Alliance!
---
And dps and tanking gods
---
Thank you. I don't know why OP went through all the effort to make something that looks like a formal research paper when it's all based on some bullshit assumption he pulled out of his ass.
---
I've been seeing more and more completely asinine posts with *way* too much effort put into them lately. People on this sub are bored and have too much time on their hands. Launch can't come soon enough.
---
In about 20 years time your kids will look at this the way we look at people who tattooed glam rock band logos on their bodies.
---
So? That doesnt change anything, i have heard people be excited about a bunch of little things, not once have i heard anyone beeing excited about melee leeway lol...
---
why so?
---
Cdew had a couple of practice duels earlier in the day where he managed to get chain lightning, earth shock and fire nova totem to crit for 1600 damage combined.
---
Shaman good class.
---
Buying from a vendor is ridiculously expensive.
---
reminds me of some of the stuff drdisrespect does, but with his own twist. funny stuff
---
Who won the tournament?
---
Stop being silly. They always hook aussies up. We chill.
---
People are always eager to trade these, easy xp- farming specifically not so much
---
I dont care the form of your internet, there wasnt as good internet as there is nowdays, thats just a fact.
---
people in this sub are a-holes
---
Everyones ping got better, unless they live in the 3rd world, in which case who cares about them.
---
Should have clarified sorry, as a priest I barely use it while levelling so a full stack goes to waste unless I play all day.
---
A pala can tank 5 man content fine. It jsut requires a bit of adjustment from the gorup as they are a bit slower building threat on single targets.
---
Maintanking raids is a problem, a prot pala has big problems here, especially with mana efficiency and bosses where taunts are required. It's doable, but you need a guild cool with it and it will be noticeably harder than a warrior main tank. Prot palas do make good offtanks in raids though, especially for aoe packs.
---
In pvp a prot pala is a very powerful tank spec, especially against melee classes. Their reflect damage can be very strong and prot can support very well. So, much better than a prot warrior in that case.
---
"Lazy Peons" in the orc/troll starting zone. In the German client when you hit the ircs, they say "Arbeit! Arbeit!" (Work! Work!), which is a running gag between me and my coworkers.
---
I'm going to play on an international server and with an English client, but for this one quest I will switch over to German.
---
Here's the sound file (Warcraft 3, but it's the same in WoW). https://youtu.be/i5iDji-VuY0
---
&gt; Probably the best PvP caster in the WoW 
---
He's not even the best steamer named rich Campbell lol
---
You were super mad for days mate. 
---
Get your meds right and you'll be all good. 
---
Come find us with our tinnies and fairy bread and chill.
---
That's fine, normal people will just join guilds where we can speak freely without Overwatch superfans trying to police our speech.
---
Comparing lobby based games with an MMORPG, come on now.
---
&gt; will be released in a broken and unfinished state. 
---
Based on what ? your personal feelin ?  
---
&gt; will leave within a few months 
---
Can you look in the future for me , and tell me the winning lotto number please ?
---
&gt; private servers, BfA or different games altogether? 
---
PServers have bugs aswell.
---
why would we?
---
beta ends soon ? was that officially stated? is there a date? i thought they would keep it running till 12th of August
---
bfa is so bad that i am subscribed and i dont even have it intalled...
---
and classic i cant play but i do have installed.
---
Of course you would prefer highest tier classes, but guilds are competing for people, some guilds in order to be able to do 40 man raids will have just some casual specs and classes because why not? There will be many people going what they want instead of what is the best dps option for example and I am sure there will be many guilds that will go on with raiding and will just invite whoever because they need people. That is standard, they won't be top guild but they will still raid.
---
FINALLY.
---
Can you guys stop whining about this now? It's authentic and we're keeping it.
---
no changes
---
Thank you, you are the hero we need
---
If the Brazilian community wants to get in touch in site we'd all be happy to include them in the conversation. We were only focused on European communities, but there is no reason we shouldn't include non-English speaking NA communities.
---
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
---
It isn't used because people in Retail don't talk.
---
yeah, whether or not this would work depends how they implement the system.
---
it works as long as "able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account" doesn't mean "go through the character creation process a total of three times" but instead means you can create three characters, delete one, and then remake the third.
---
if so, as soon as the character creation launches i would try to quickly create the characters with the names i want and then a week later, delete and remake them as i want them to look when there are presumably fewer people creating characters but still before launch.
---
i know it's not likely to make a difference, but it took like 3 minutes to do and i've otherwise pretty much run out of things to do to get ready for classic.
---
You still need the invite from Blizz. I was invited to the first but the 2nd was US only, I'm *assuming* I'm in on #3. You might get an email closer to the time.
---
BGs will be fine except AV where map layout and tower structure favour alliance in non-zerg games.
---
T H I C C F A N D
---
This is still our ping
---
See, and this is why I don't believe anyone of you when you talk about latency.
---
Because you're so ignorant about networking that you can't even tell the difference between bandwidth and latency.
---
It doesn't matter what Blizzard is doing. 
---
There will be always one guy posting it as a "terrible decision" on reddit.
---
Where do you people come up with this shit? Kiting works accurately in the beta. Just look at any of AlkaizerX VODs on Twitch of him playing Classic beta and you will see him perfectly Hamstring kite mobs with his warrior all the time. Are you sure you're not just bad?
---
Also NPCs are not gaining any range from leeway in the beta, this is blatantly false. Leeway only affects players, we've already seen in other threads how the code causing leeway is written and know for a fact it only affects players.
---
More Subs = More Money for Blizzard.
---
Just buy it on the AH and get our XP for free
---
Chernobyl?
---
Obviously, but no internal testing is going to be as effective as few thousand rabid nerds.
---
"SWIM BITCH!" (reference to: https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdsBeingDicks/comments/6tydjw/fly_bitch/ )
---
I love STV on a pvp server, can't wait to go back.
---
Hahaha yeah, clearly. Just kidding obviously, he's super kawaii
---
Then I would recommend not rolling a warrior. From what I remember from vanilla/tbc it was annoying to level one even using the tricks that won't be in classic (/sit to force crits, hamstring 2h kiting), you constantly had to eat and aggroing more mobs was either run fast or die. Not the most enjoyable experience.
---
My man.
---
Rent, never own.
---
i cant stand the idea of streamers (asmon and soda are obnoxious examples)
---
but even i really enjoy esfands content
---
Thanks for your advice:)
---
32, not married.. classic will make sure it stays that way.
---
I'd argue it's a mistake not taking Pathfinding. I spend most of my questing time with Cheetah on. Hawk is nice if you're not moving much, or during Dungeons, but otherwise I want that movement speed.
---
Personally I'd also put a point in Improved Mend Pet. That free Curse/Disease/Poison cleanse can do some big favours while levelling. There's a lot of lengthy debuffs in the world.
---
You could free up points by taking one or two out of Frenzy, but it's purely about choices. I always found 60% is enough to give pretty much full uptime on a fast attacking pet. Alternatively you can drop 1 in Spirit Bond, and the Imp. Hawk you're using.
---
Gives you something like this:

---
My understanding of the "main concern" for right click reporting has nothing to do with singular toxic players. The largest objections are centered around abusing the function to get players auto-banned. For example: You're farming mineral nodes somewhere and someone starts taking the nodes you're farming. So you get your whole guild to mass report this one person to get them auto-banned so you don't have to compete for resources. This situation could be abused in many different ways of course, this is just one example.
---
I have a friend with a huge horde tattoo, hes rolling alliance in classic
---
Who begged for spell batching? I remember I was like "Who tf asked for that?" when I read an article of it being in Classic.
---
Why does everyone assume that the latency they personally got in 2004 was the average latency? Anyone living in America/Europe could have gotten between 20ms and 200ms depending on their geographical location and what kind of data service they had. Personally I was in Australia and got ~450ms give or take a couple of hundred ms depending on time of day. Yes, I'm 100% serious.
---
Then there was the discovery that Wow didn't have TCP_NODELAY set and so people paid for tunneling services that reduced latency, I managed to get mine down to ~320ms.
---
So the spell batching was not going to behave the same for every single player. However with modern real internet connections I do think the window should probably be reduced.
---
they allow it cuz of monie$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
The math checks out!
---
Thanks for the insight! :)
---
Great to hear, I wasn't sure there was an immediate interest/need in anything like this, so really happy to hear that you can use it too!
---
&gt;See how i was addressing how you DON'T have a resto shaman in for each group. See that part. That would indicate that the context i am speaking about is occurring because the enh shaman is allowing you to have an extra dps group with shaman buffs. 
---
You are aware that an enhancement shaman pushes the dps of the group not enough to warrant one over a real dps?
---
&gt;Yes, because your raid is going to have 7-8 resto shamans.
---
I absolutely don't get your point with that.
---
Who the fuck would take so many shamans with them on a raid? A more normal number would be maybe 2 or 3.
---
&gt;is going to change the amount of dps they add to a group. 
---
Yeah, but not the way you think they do.
---
I should probably mention that I raided from MC to AQ40 as enhancement because despite all proof it took me so long to finally realize how useless this shit was in PvE.
---
A friend of mine also suggested that I use the shooting tree later. It seems that it should be very powerful. Thank you for your suggestion.
---
By what logic? Europe has always had better ISPs than North America. USA literally has 3rd world tier internet compared to Europe lol.
---
&gt;Classic as it exists has a large and passionate population
---
I suppose we will soon see how large and passionate they really are.
---
Fuck no.
---
That's part of the charm of those early days.
---
They did that. Anyone messing with the tourney was KoS. They eventually moved it to an uncontested zone (a small island somewhere) and dropped pvp flags. No more problems.
---
People will farm dungeons at 60 for a few days. Then progress starts, which may or may not take long for a lot of those players. Then they raid log, just like most do on retail.
---
And PvP without rewards stays interesting for most a month at best, just like it did in Beta. TM vs SS is just a (potentially) bigger bridge zerg battle in Alterac Valley. My guess is that Phase 2 will launch in mid to late october to keep PvP players interested.
---
I also hate fun.
---
MOONKIN MOONKIN MOONKIN MOONKIN!
---
You're ignoring the facts and cherry picking my response. I literally just showed you that the official WoW Vanilla atlas has bosses in MC listed as having 93 shadow resistance when you said it wasn't a thing lmao. You literally said earlier that bosses have no resistances. Now you've changed it "except some odd ones" after being proven wrong, only to be proven wrong yet AGAIN. You even ignored the part of my response where I point out that Glock, an addon made specifically for tracking raid boss magical resistances, was a thing in Vanilla.
---
You said priests were simple, and I mentioned downranking (lie spells?), then talked about political correctness.
---
Largely yeah you look like an adventurer not some glowing murder hobo, however, the sets look distinctive and expensive enchants glow which is relatively rare.
---
The nature of most gear looking meh is intentional, when someone geared walks by they are special.
---
If everyone is special, no one is.
---
Makes getting players booted and banned using right click reporting easy.
---
That aside it’s not against TOS to multibox.
---
I hold it in very high regard as well. My first MMO, and I went in completely blind. Didn't know about shuttleports. So I basically walked across Tatooine before I knew fast travel existed. So many great memories from that game.
---
I'm not talking about residence lol
---
Yeah, but the more I hear about features that make it into classic from modern WoW, the less interested I become...
---
Leeway has been in the game since 1.10 and classic is 1.12. I wouldn't expect it to go anywhere.
---
1 head horde 1 head alliance
---
tonight
---
Tauren master race.
---
Like arcane shot in the rotation? The hunter is going to go oom fast with no noticeable damage increase
---
If you think that's the only scenario in which auto-squelch and disconnect is going to be abused you're delusional.
---
wouldn't be the first time they do mixed battlegroups.
---
Wondering about the differences between enhance and ele shamans for pvp. Is one generally favoured over the other or do they have different specialities (bgs, world PvP, etc...)?
---
Everybody downvoted you because you state your opinion, but present it as a fact which has been confirmed.
---
Statistics can be used to prove anything Kent, forfty percent of all people know that.....
---
You had copper lines so it's really just the distance to the data center.
---
On some private, they litteraly made mob resist to pickpocket to nerf this.
---
So let's see what happen but it may stay lucrative in Classic.
---
I don't think its his only enjoyment but it's part of the total package in an MMORPG. Some jokes can be really funny but also edgy and offensive to some persons but a well development person should be able to laugh it off or at least have a barrier to it.
---
I don't see where your math comes from. You can simply compute the probability by
---
P(B&gt;L+R)=1-F_B(L+R)=1-(L+R)/Bt
---
where I assumed B to be uniformly distributed in [0,Bt] and L+R to be within this interval.
---
The Rhok'delar quests.  Those solo fights always sounded like an interesting challenge back in Vanilla, and it would be great to finally see them.  Though I'm still on the fence about my class and may not even be a Hunter.
---
THICC
---
The first link has good info on it, but the spec itself is pretty bad. Going 58 points or w/e into BM makes no sense for leveling. You need to get 5/5 Mortal Shots since 55-59 is around the levels where your ranged shots are starting to scale really strongly. [Here's the spec I would recommend.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0GdtxotqVohx)
---
TBC sets were honestly gorgeous!
---
Hopefully with severe punishments for even a single instance of abuse.
---
Why is just multiple characters being poorly controlled.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0xzVIR0sZZxgcoxq
---
It doesn't matter what points the player takes in the balance tree as long as they take Nature's Grace and Moonglow. In the resto tree you can take one point out of Nature's focus and put it in imp. Rejuv but that talent only applies to the base healing value so it's not very strong IMO.
---
Yup. When they removed the rpg aspect.
---
If you're the highest level on the server, you wouldn't have any competition for spawns anyway.
---
Yeah please segregate NA and SA.  This game is social - it’s tough to play with people who don’t speak English.
---
So 1 out of 4... Which isn't the majority lol

I heard that Bizzard will remain the same.

Realistically the only thing you'd use the melee weapon for is totem killing and I don't think weapon skill matters for that.
---
You don't need to think about melee weapon skill, no.
---
You do, however, need wand skill but you'll get it automatically since priests use wands A LOT while leveling.
---
You're making the same bad assumption I'm guessing a lot of people claiming stuff is though. Just because your latency has changed over the years it doesn't mean the internet infrastructure as a whole has changed much. The standards for what's considered good, average and bad latency is pretty much the same today as it was in the early 2000s.

---
We don't know how that works but a former Blizzard employee said that he wouldn't recommend abusing the system because false reports are taken very seriously and will get you in a lot of trouble.
---
If you just act like a decent normal human being when playing the game you got nothing to worry about.
---
Isn't this a dangerous road to go down? Once Classic comes out, she will notice that your attention is diminishing and she will blame WoW for it.
---
locks are strong. you can kite well with fear and curse of exhaustion. void saccing is also really nice, especially if you have the trinket that summons your void for free
---
don't know if I am more hyped for this or for /u/EveClassic to stop making baseless assumptions drawn from zero evidence.
---
Ok thanks everyone, question answered !
---
Fun-fact:
---
Did anyone notice I am not a native englisch speaker?    :D
---
Your wand is your everything. If you’re only casting you’re wrong. You’re whole rotation revolves around wanding. Anyone that says otherwise doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Early levels: mind blast&gt;pain&gt;wanding till dead. (Personal experience for max dps happens with holyfire) holy fire&gt; mind blast&gt; pain&gt; wanding. The second rotation is only for when you have bad gear, or fight harder enemies. The difference in rotational damage between the 2 is mainly changed by your wand. TLDR: wands are your god while leveling.
---
&gt; I literally just showed you that the official WoW Vanilla atlas has bosses in MC listed as having 93 shadow resistance when you said it wasn't a thing lmao
---
First of all you didn't "literally showed me". You told me. And the Official WoW Atlas has datas from the BETA if not even Alpha. It was out of date by patch 1.1 so not really the best source ever.
---
&gt; after being proven wrong, only to be proven wrong yet AGAIN.
---
"proven" you keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means. You didn't prove jack shit.
---
&gt; Glock, an addon made specifically for tracking raid boss magical resistances, was a thing in Vanilla.
---
that's because resistances varied from boss to boss. Still most of them had nothing beyond the unmodifiable baseline resistance due to level difference. If every boss had 75 resistance the whole Glock addon would be rather useless wouldn't it?
---
&gt; Spell Penetration improves Shaman DPS substantially
---
I never claimed it doesn't, on bosses with NR. Shaman dps is still shit anyway.
---
Im 32 and my uncle is in his 50s and we are both coming back.
---
Yup! Which is why many people, including myself, would say this does not "feel" like how it was in classic at all.
---
Its interesting because of the challenge, running dungeons by yourself obv will be more hard and a challenge to do a dungeon with yourself. 
---
its what i think its the most intriguing.
---
One button press that does many things is cheating, controlling 5 char with one press that does one action or ingame macro is totally fine, i did it for months until last month, when i quit, got bored of farming, made many mil from it and got botchecked by gm's no problem, it is on the edge tho, isboxer has some functions that will get u banned but thats more automated multiboxing
---
Would you have time for both is you're playing casually?
---
I levelled a hunter recently to 22 on a private server as well as a warrior but only to level 10 so far. It's a pain levelling a warrior as they're so gear dependent so what I've been able to do is save any green drops while levelling the hunter for the warrior to use. With decent pieces the levelling of a warrior is much improved.
---
is it because you think they are gaining a advantage by using more money? 
---
If you have 5 characters its 5 x gear, 5 x epic mounts etc.
---
Your
---
No it doesn’t...not in classic.
---
Lol 'etiquette', 'honor', bullshit, a win is a win. There should be almost no rules to begin with unless related to exploits. Go read playing to win, educate yourself, if it's in the game it should be allowed.
---
I bought all the white vendor armour from a quest hub before leaving it and did not know that talents existed for far too long.
---
damn never lucky
---
Why? Blizz knows better than to make ridiculous assumptions and slap approximate math on top of it when uniform distribution trivialise the problem.
---
Anything above 50ms was considered a bad latency in EU in 2005. Hell, most serious Quake an CS players were used to play with 10ms. Clanbase Eurocup games were mostly &lt;50ms too.
---
Ha ! Glad I could help !
---
It's definitely a toss up for me. I think I'd probably go Endurance until about 40/50 or so, then switch them around.
---
As I mentioned, I find I don't spend that much time in Hawk (largely just because I'm lazy about switching Aspects mid-fight - easier just to stay in Cheetah unless I'm fighting something particularly tough or doing 5mans).
---
On the Mend Pet side of things though, worth remembering that in 1.12 Mend is still channelled (5/6 sec iirc), so it's a big damage drop if you're doing it mid-fight.
---
If you're finding you don't need to mend much though, I'd agree it's a worthwhile swap even if you're as lazy as me with Hawk switching.
---
Like, i have the money for it aswell as i think it would be funny to try doing some dungeons when my friends starts to fall off. 
---
but i rather have a dungeon summon service running 1 warlock and 2 mages and summon people back and forth to dungeons.
---
The fov isn't changed, it was just bugged for widescreen displays back in vanilla. This is like saying that the game having proper support for windows 10 is a bug.
---
In a fair duel a rogue gets the opener! If they wouldn’t be in an duel environment the opponent wouldn’t even know there is a rogue (if he is good) so he would’ve the opener anyway

Mitch McConnel’s younger self.

This kind of thing happens often at that time. It’s really annoying for people who don’t like PVP.
---
Cheating no, very unfair yes, blizzard makes the rules and is allowed so cant call it cheating, its a dick move tho, i know i ran 8 just openworld, some treid to attack me, deleting them is fun but feels a bit evil
---
i never really RBG'd on retail during BFA but some arena partners were telling me about people mass reporting in RBGs to DC players. unsure for how long since i didnt take a big interest in BFA.
---
I also dpsed with a shield for a while.
---
Classic is very different from retail. First of all you're less likely to be squelched on retail because of less competition thus less incentive and also less interaction general. Secondly being squelched matters less due to LFD/LFR. In classic being squelched means you may as well not even play.
---
There are more issues though. Imagine two rival groups competing for arena master. After winning there's some taunting in general chat which leads to the winning party being squelched out of frustration by the losers. That's ridiculous, especially since it doubles each time and there are cases of people being squelched for a month. Imagine two guilds competing for a world boss. Let the mass squelching commence! Imagine two rank 13s from different guilds competing for rank 14. There's nothing stopping one guild from mass reporting the other rank 13 to the point of being squelched, repeatedly disconnected and suspended. If you think players won't stoop to that level you're delusional.
---
This isn't true. We constantly passed over shit builds for better builds. We benched useless builds all the time. We didn't want to sit in mc any longer than required. In fact back then we were even benching dps warriors cos we thought they were shit. There was a constant culture of take the best, bring the trash only when they can't fill but know you're getting the leftover shit cos your dkp is too low from having been passed over every other raid for your trash build for someone who specced properly. Next you'll say you took a bunch of fire mages.

wow you just said that and you were serious saying it.

when did we stop enjoying freedom and started aching for someone to police everything we say and do?

What's funny is that you use the excuse of 13 and 14 year olds not having to see racist, xenophobic or otherwise just gross (you actually used gross... wtvr) shit on a video game chat, Not knowing that most racist xenophobe and trolls in general are 13 and 14 year olds....

I do not want my kids to grow up in a fake bubble of induced altruism where they are not exposed to the shitheads of this world and the dumbasses (that one is you) out there, because guess what! they will be exposed to them soon enough in their life. It's better to learn to deal with people, the same way i deal with short sighted idiots (also you) on the internet and in real life, rather than hide, run away and pretend it is out there.

&gt;That makes you a bad person so I find a lot of  schadenfreude  myself  in knowing how your life must be.

I leveled a Hunter in a private server soon as well. It was quite satisfying to finally get a pet at level 10. I think I'm gonna go Hunter with a Warrior alt.
---
&gt;I can't watch someone because of their physical appearance.  
---
This type of superficiality lead us to today's media. There's lots of instagram models with the personality of a grass blade for you lad.
---
Tier 5 and 6 were almost perfect across the board, imo.
---
Extra green lit, more subs per person more money, they make the game rules, so not true cheating.
---
So hunters will be working how they were in classic and not like how they were in private servers. 
---
Sounds pretty good. I mean things like the dr change was a balance change that blizzard implemented in the 1.10 patch, it’s not a big.
---
Pretty nice writeup. I better remember this one if I decide on rolling a hunter.
---
Like I already said, spell leeway is good, melee is not :)
---
You are correct just 1 SM7B mic is not $1200. You must be the smartest person in the world.

If you're innocent the temporary punishment will only be temporary and once cleared you can make a big deal of it and talk to a GM and demand that people get punished.
---
I found it really hard to use Vent after lower latency apps like Mumble released (and later TS3). The delay is just outrageous, even on LAN Vent manages to be like half a second behind.
---
I appreciate that Discord is indeed bloated, and at this point you're so far committed that instigating change is hard, but Mumble is just so far ahead of Vent in voice quality and latency that I wouldn't ever be able to back to Vent now. (Also the mumble server is free to host without a license.)
---
Tattoo looks well done, but whatis with horde players and totally cringy atm tattoos?
---
yeah man legion and bfa have really nice aesthetic imo. they are toning down the particle effects and going for more tasteful themes. but classic wow had a great aesthetic too, super unique but not over the top. colorful and yet realistic. i still really like the classic wow vibe.
---
&gt;I find myself listening to Skarm and others and he's an amazing speaker. But in my opinion I think he's lulling average players in to a sense of false security.  
---
&gt;People want to do the best they can and that's admirable, but I think what's going to actually happen is under geared half added, no consumable tanks that get wrecked.
---
Skarm was in my book a good content creator, that was balanced in his views regarding Prot Warriors, Fury Prot and Druid tanks...until he said that 14% Parry on Classic bosses vs 5.6% on private servers don't matter.
---
From that moment I realized that he is either dumb as fuck, or intentionally misleading people into believing that Fury Prot Tanks and Druid tanks in Classic will be as viable like on private servers.
---
I'll go for the later, because his entire career on YT was about "Fury and Feral tanks are the best option" and changing it would harm him.
---
But, let's be honest here...most people don't realize what a 14% parry chance actually means for tanks. It makes Fury tanking instantly non-viable and heavily dampers the Druid tanking ability in raids.
---
Still, people will roll Warriors for Fury tanking and get wrecked. Same for people rolling Druids and attempting to tank raid bosses in Classic.
---
There was a SOLID reason why the only tank in Vanilla was the Protection Warrior : anything else simply did not survived the incoming damage...because of 14% Parry on bosses.
---
I really feel sorry for people who will want to "prove" that Fury and Druids can tank raid bosses. They can...after the raid content in on farm status. But not before.
---
BFA gear makes me puke.
---
Rogue is not the most populated class, not even close. They were in early vanilla, but are one of the least played classes on vanilla privas and that is how it will be in real Classic as well. Just look at any of the polls done here on classicwow subreddit, Rogues always end up the 3rd least picked class for once Classic launches in August.
---
Warrior and Mage being the most popular classes by far, exactly like on private servers.
---
Gouge is a melee spell... it requires you to be in melee range. It’s like sinister strike, it’s a weapon based melee spell.
---
Are you saying you can have leeway on attacks like sinister strike but not on auto attacks?
---
enhance is melee
---
ele is ranged caster
---
none of these specs is favoured anywhere, both are more niche.
---
try enhance in WSG on single enemys with berserk-buff
---
try ele from the backline in bigger BGs. 
---
enhance is mostly proccluck and more gear dependent.
---
u wanna have windfury procc off each other. no critprocs = you lose. proccs = maybe you win.
---
i played ele sham in vanilla and even grinded to rank 10.
---
gear is not that much of a problem, melees are more gear dependent imo.
---
if you have first hit on any unsuspecting target, you have a good chance to win, but thats reality for almost any class because of the more bursty vanilla gameplay.
---
i vanilla i often wished i rolled another class because most of the time you will get raped by other raidgeared classes.
---
theres no way you win against a rogue. vs warrior its a 6 seconds win or die fragfest, shadowpriests are winnable but rare, druids should be easy but also rare. warlocks will just toy with you, mages that manage to land a CS will also eat you. paladins will outheal you and you will die to autoattacks in minute long duels. hunters are also winnable.

Yes, names are limited to a realm, there can be, let's say, a "Darkin" on every realm

Nah your sentences were good and it was all spelled correctly, well written english! ;)

This post has a Shrek is love Shrek is life vibe

Here is your example:
---
To this stupid statement, I can say you don't need a PvE server : just go on a PvP server and avoid enemies. 
---
If you think perma-flag PvP on a PvE server is the same as rolling on a PvE server, you have not a single clue about what off-pvp team ganking means, how gamebreaking it can be, and how unimmersive it is to see an ennemy you can't attack but who might latter attack you when in a bad situation following a wrong pull or already in a fight. 
---
Geez, those "go on PvE server and perma flag" guys...
---
On my warrior choosing my first talent point and thinking cruelty was terrible because 1% extra crit would only take me from 5% to 5.05%. 
---
(To be fair this is actually something that really bugs me still in the game that they don’t distinguish between things that are a percentage point increase (such as cruelty) and things that are actually a % increase to your stat)
---
Can you feel it, Blizzard, closing in all around you? The Classic WoW players have been awakened. The sins of the past have finally caught up to you. You will be called to account for all the atrocities you've committed, the unspeakable horrors you've let loose upon this world, and the dark, ancient private servers you've shut down. Though my soul was one of the first to be devoured by your evil, there are thousands more bound within your subscription service, and they cry out for release.
---
Look now to your servers, Blizzard, for the champions of boar intestines gather at your gates!
---
I never got on with destruction as a farmer I loved affliction  as very little down time and seeing a field of mobs run around slowly dying made me hard.
---
If it didn't happen in real vanilla with exactly the same mechanics, it won't happen in Classic.
---
I’ll pass on a barrens full of “N Bombs” and Maga shitposters, thanks

"Make report abuse bannable"
---
And now tryhards will just get disposable account with a level 1 to report everything they want.
---
Blame the system, not the people. 
---
In Waloonia, you can be studying english for your whole scholarship and not be able to make a full sentence. 
---
My family is impressed that I can speak English at a « top level » (from their point of view). When talking with natives (internship), i only feel decent when i make endeavours. 
---
I also mix flemish/english... a lot of words has the same etymology.
---
Its still cheating... Blizzard just turns a blind eye to it bevause its profit for them. If one person buys 5 subs so they can multibox, that's more money for them... If multiboxing were a thing with 1 account it would be a bannable offense.
---
38 &amp; cannot wait!

I had a 30 ping back in vanilla thanks to fast path.
---
I feel you.
---
both are viable in pvp as far as i can remember.
---
BG is teamplay. raidgeard Warrios with dispell and healing will love to stick to you both as WL and rogue because you cant get away so easy and eat tons of damage.
---
in 1v1, both WL and rog are among the strongest classes and CAN win against any other class if played and geared right.
---
no rog will just "roll" over you. you got fear, seduction and other tools to stop these pests for some time and get a nice bolt and dot on them.
---
I got the full Horde crest. Lok'tar Ogar brother!
---
Amazing work :) you got something for Warrior? And or lock?
---
Beautiful :)
---
Imagine getting the temporary instant punishment while you are tanking a world boss, making you whole guild wipe and now the guild that reported you can have the world boss for themselves. Nice.
---
You said they had $1200 microphones. Not that the total price for all of their mics was a cost of $1200.

Learn to English.
---
"improved classic" already exists. it's called retail and has 15 years worth of improvements for you. please don't try to ruin this game too.
---
The bow quest for hunters. I got the leaf so close to AQ that I never had a chance to do it
---
Doesn't solve anything, try hard will just get disposable accounts to abuse the report without any risk. It just mean spending little money.
---
Auto-squelching and disconnecting players is going to be used as a weapon. If I'm an enchanter and I want to destroy my competition, there's nothing stopping me and four friends from auto-squelching any other enchanter who advertises their services in trade. They won't even be able to get revenge because they won't know who squelched them.
---
47 and cannot wait.
---
adapt to what eaxctly? if it WAS on vanilla and it ill be on CLASSIC, what does that guy has to adapt to?
---
I've heard that priests and warr combo is rly good in PVP, so I would say it depends on what your team is otherwise playing.
---
Exactly! If you really want to play, then play. You will make new friends ingame. Vanilla had good community, it's pretty likely that Classic will to.
---
Most of the people I'm going to play with this time around *I actually met ingame anyway*. We started with vanilla 7 RL friends back then, only 3-4 of us left that will play classic this time, but it's fine. Looking forward to making more/new friends to play with again.
---
Did you think I meant EU servers were in the US or something?
---
And 39 people accepting a subpar tank.
---
ESPECIALLY healers.
---
But, once Classic hits, you, and everyone else from private servers, will wake up to the reality : Warriors are VASTLY SUPERIOR tanks, and Protection Warriors are GODLIKE tanks compared to anything else.
---
This stupidity about Druid tanks will last for a while more, until people start raiding, and see what Druids can and cannot do.
---
And the CANNOT DO will heavily out-weight the CAN DO, to the point of : "Druid tank? Is this a joke?" that was the norm back in Vanilla.
---

The amount of toxic garbage replies in this thread is mindblowing. It seems as if it's almost a natural reaction of reddit's worthless trolls to jump out of the woodwork to instinctively shout down anything that resembles effort and dedication. "Scientific" does not mean "perfect", it means thorough. 
---
There's no nuance either, of course. One questionable assumption immediately renders everything "completely worthless" and "a total waste of time". And instead of arguing for a better solution the reaction is blanketed dismissal of all results. Yeah, all numbers used here could be wrong, but that's not the point you fucking retards. It's a flexible model - provide better numbers yourself and it will work just as well. 
---
So let me state this very clearly: this is good work and a useful foundation for further inquiry. Thank you for doing this and for doing it in a throrough and substantiated way. The model itself can be calibrated to provide insight under different configurations, which is great for testing and discussion. 
---
The only thing I wouldn't have done is the final conversion to percentage - it's much easier to understand the effect quantified as an enlarged reaction window than as a referenceless percentage increase, particularly when it boils down to "back then reacting wasn't possible, now it is".
---
&gt; I explained why Classic is much different from retail. Reporting will be  used as a weapon against players and also as a threat to coerce them. 
---
You are making speculations without any evidence.  You didn't see it live. Maybe there are also 1-2 smart guys in Blizzard who know the differences from Classic to Retail. Maybe they have a solution for this. Just wait for the release and complain when it is actually a thing.  You can find wild theories for everything but it doesn't mean that they will become reality.  
---
Additionally Blizzard confirmed already that they are checking auto silences and if it was abused is has consequences for the reporters.  
---

---
&gt; If you think Blizzard is going to investigate each report then you  ignore the reason why they introduced auto-squelch in the first place,  to cut down on GM's doing the manual work. 
---
I don't say they investigate each report. I said when a server 1st kill or a PVP rank 14 is denied because of the abuse of reporting system then they will check and it will have consequences.   
---
And again my question: When did Method got any squelches during world 1st race?  
---
When they don't get squelched who will be?
---
Can we not put how many days left before release in the title? It’ll go by much faster if we stop counting the days lol.
---
" No that will never happen."
---
You underestimate how try hard some can be, on corrupt private server there are players paying gm thousands of dollar just for a few pieces of gear or even to just temporary ban for a few hours competition for ranking. And those will play classic and they will abuse anything they can even if it mean spending hundred on disposable accounts to have the same result.
---
Yeah, so the discrepancy is even bigger if you add the french speakers in the rest of Europe too. Italy, Spain and Portugal don't have areas outside their country who speak their language.
---
I did too a few days ago. :D
---
I'll be 5 boxing and leveling mostly through dungeons and doing all the 5 mans solo, I have many reason why but one of them is my friends who are playing are casual people so I'll have every roll to help them and I can do my own thing while they level. 
---
You cannot target 1 guy and blow them up with shamans, they are using the same multi-box restrictions as BfA.
---
I'd worry about layering exploitation for gold selling more than anything else.
---
Why did you not take a screenshot?
---
&gt; Skarm (tank youtuber) has shown that Feral Druids can tank nearly every boss in Naxx, including KT 
---
On private servers, where raid bosses have 5.6% parry chance.
---
In Classic, raid bosses have 14% parry.
---
This will make Druid tanking highly undesirable for raid progression, and DW Fury tanking impossible.
---
Ah yes, the good ol' 
---
&gt;P(B&gt;L+R) = 1-F_B(L+R) = 1-(L+R)/Bt
---
Quite exquisite, that is.
---
Cheers :D
---
Right click reporting isn't in classic wow
---
Melee leeway isn't something we had to adjust to for a very long time as it has been removed from modern clients. If you haven't played with it, going to feel weird. It was an artificial method of compensating for lag.
---
Not something we have to deal with anymore, as latency to the servers is so quick, as well as the way the server ticks to check on player position is much faster. (As well we have a billion ways to get on someone and stay on someone now as melee compared to previous)
---
I don't even know how to find all the interviews they've given, let alone watch them all... Blue post was the last example.
---
So they get temp banned, and you and your guild get actually banned for abusing the report feature? How is that in anyone's best interest to do?
---
If you want to learn the class properly, get to aimed shot asap.
---
So again you made a long post just to agree with me?
---
The 'enabled be default' profanity filter will block that and you can simply add people to your ignore list if you don't want to see them.
---
Your argument that just because it didn't get abused in one instance means it won't is bs. World firsts and rank 14s aren't the only instances it could be abused. As I said there's nothing stopping me and four friends from mass squelching all the competing enchanters in trade chat. That's pretty effed up.
---
Except you said yourself it's a recent change so you would have to watch at most 1 video? A couple of blue posts?
---
Everyone wants to play a shaman now, right?  \*hihihihi\*
---
Scotland is however relatively well connected to the servers in France, the British / France backbones were early on super fast, compare it to the north of Sweden, which had 150+ ping to even Denmark, let alone France.

The ignore list will be in classic so have no fear!

Hahah I wholeheartedly agree. But it was my intention to illustrate the feeling I have every day at work.
---
Hah, don't we all! But you wouldn't be picked out of a thread as a non native speaker at all, nice job.
---
I've been semi fluent in a couple of languages over my life and never kept up practice sadly, one of the ways I envy non natives for picking up another language is that available media !
---
&gt; Doesn't solve anything
---
That would be false. Most people will not have multiple accounts.
---
Are you really suggesting there should be no punishment for abuse, because it isn't effective anyway? xD
---
It's objectively bad for the game, if you care about classic you ought to be against it too.
---
When I looked at gear from vanilla or tbc, it just feels epic but when I look at any other gear from today I feel nothing, even if it may look cool. Maybe it’s nostalgia speaking but I always felt like the gear during vanilla/bc (Raid/pvp gear) looked so sick. Like when I see someone in full field marshal gear I couldn't help but inspect them every time but in legion, I didn’t think of it at all. I dunno how it is now tho, I stopped playing during legion.
---
I would probably move the MB to after the shadow weaving stacks have built up, opening with holy fire (best damage per mana spell too) is absolutely best.

Because blindly putting a trap down without some kind of enabler like scattershot or a bomb is something someone who is going for R14 will do. "PLEASE WALK THROUGH THIS OBVIOUS TRAP AFTER I FD RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU"
---
Every high level hunter uses scattershot into trap, or some other form of CC INTO a trap. Due to you having to be out of combat to drop a trap, and people who notice you plant a trap (not invisible right away) you can easily walk away from it.
---
Yea, that is my main issue. He disgusts me, not just by how he looks but by his mannerisms.

Where's his Academy Award?
---
Chances are it's already been explained to you, but the way it works is, you'll log in to your wow account, and since you have a token on one of your characters, you'll be able to press a button to reactive your sub.  
---
then, with your sub active, two weeks before wow classic launch, you can go to the server option in wow and go to the classic servers there, make up to three characters (and therefore reserving the names)  
---
TLDR- don't waste $7.50 unless the specific name you want is worth $7.50 to you.

Yeah, just seen a post from the forums with blizz saying leeway working as intended so more than likely won’t be changing it. RIP
---
Bandwidth =/= speed. Having the ability to download more doesn't mean shit as long as you can get all you request in the time frame it's required, a game like wow is incredibly light on network usage, let alone wow from 2004, which used kb/s at most. Latency is (mostly) due to distance and infrastructure of the ISP, where traveling further or on outdated equipment (e.g. Copper vs fiberglass) is what increases latency.
---
Yes but a temp punishment is too much when I am innocent.
---
You still don't get it. Why do you think someone saying something "racist" means they need to get globally muted or suspended? Just put them on ignore so you personally don't have to see their messages anymore. Problem 100% solved.

He will find out that you abused the system and you will get some juicy ban together with your friends.  
---
Easy.

Rhok’delar!

Yeah, we're gonna need a source on that one.

But at least some streamers who will just use it to earn money and host silly events got the beta, right? right?

you keep thinking you're proving anything, while in fact you are only proving you don't understand the concept of "proof".

I think some classic release celebration undies are in order.

Then again I'm 29 so exactly the sort of people OP is lamenting, maybe in a few years I'll be right there with you.
---
Basically, hunters are screwed. If you're reading this and considering hunter, you should be concerned:
---
With leeway in the game, melee attackers (who are meant to be kited because they do so much damage) aren't kitable. And for hunters, kiting is the most important thing they can possibly do. Warriors and rogues can literally shit on hunters without the hunter even being able to melee, trap, or shoot. Here's why: 
---
If the hunter tries to melee, he's screwed because he isn't meant to be a melee fighter like other classes, and deals negligible damage compared to Warriors and Rogues. (even Ret paladins - for *those* guys)
---
If the hunter goes in for a trap, well, there isn't going to be any trapping happening because the melee is so far away because of leeway that the melee can literally walk around it, and resume hitting. And let's not even get started on the Scatter-Trap DR which is also gamebreaking.
---
And if the hunter tries to kite, well, the melee is in his deadzone and he can't shoot so he's just gonna get smacked and killed without getting a single shot off.
---
I really hope Blizzard reconsiders this stuff, especially leeway and the scatter/trap DR. I know of many Hunter mains who are rerolling or even considering quitting WoW. The game is different nowadays, and it's meant to be enjoyable for everyone. 
---
Please throw us a bone. Us Hunters don't do big PvE numbers, nor do we get brought to raids by the dozen. Give us our PvP mechanics, it's why thousands of hunters love Vanilla for how it is.
---

&gt;It's objectively bad for the game, if you care about classic you ought to be against it too.

Hahahaha, yes, it is your objective opinion :D

Please give me an objective list of thing I have to be against when I care about classic.
---
You're acting like everyone had 200 ping back then. That's absolutely not true, shitty ping was more common but the average person was not playing quake with 200 ping.
---
I disagree completely. 
---
It would enhance the faction identities, and the RP side of the game. We know special characters can travel all aspects of the world if they work hard enough to be recognised by the other races as a friendly. 
---
I could imagine my Tauren Druid working to make peace with Nelfs and eventually working up to a point he would join their forces for conflict against the Undead or Alliance. 
---
Nelfs had to be twisted to join the Alliance.
---
I don't think you get it.

Before they removed totem stomping and possibly said something about their stance.

Then 2 days ago totem stamping silently came back into beta. I want to know what their stance actually was before to figure out whether it is likely that this is on purporse or not.

The hunter has the initiative too. He can run around searching the rogue.

Typical behaviour from someone who in unable to dispute the facts presented to them. Showing you literal screenshots from Blizzard themselves that show Bosses have shadow resist somehow isn't proof.

I hope you remember this conversation during Classic WoW when people dive in to the game files and you realise i'm right :)

I just don't understand people that know where an answer would be but can't be bothered to look.
---
Yes it was in Wrath, as RAF wasn't in for classic from memory.
---
its their game thats why they can police what people can say lol
---
"Broadband" doesn't have any significant impact on latency though. Also, as you said, location is important - your experience clearly wasn't the experience for everyone,  yet your entire post is predicated on the assumption that low ping didn't exist nearly 2 years before the patch Classic is based on because *insert random broadband statistics that have nothing to do with latency here.*
---
&gt;I don't even know how to find all the interviews they've given, let alone watch them all... Blue post was the last example.
---
I can't tell if you think this is a thing that can be googled and Im too lazy to, or if you are genuinely trolling.
---
It's 20 seconds. You should divide 480 by 24 and not 408 by 24 since if you mount up you lose 3*160 speed. 20*136=2720=17*160

So you and all the other people saying stuff like that, actually want the game to be worse, just to "stick it" to other people?
---

---
People forget something very important here.
---
Blizzard customer service back when vanilla was out was a bunch of GM's hopping from server to server answering tickets. Whenever someone was spouting racial garbage in trade, or gold seller spam, a gm had to log into the server, take a look at the ticket and respond.
---
Now the customer service staff, have to hop between GAMES, not just servers. And they are going to have to somehow manage, classic and BFA servers at the same time.
---
As such they are going with the auto-squelch system to try and fix some of that strain.
---
Do we know how many reports it takes to auto-squelch someone? Probably a freaking lot. It's not just a few people and boom you get squelched. It's going to be dozens at least.
---
It was easier to get someone suspended back in vanilla by opening a ticket than it is to auto-squelch someone now.
---
Alright I hope you enjoy getting squelched by the automod system :)
---
Ty
---
right-click report *was* in the beta but it was removed.
---
Right-click report is fine. Should be handled manually. Those automated systems are shit and I despise dealing with companies who use those systems in general. We got the ignore button that should be enough. Everyone should take own responsibility for dealing with such individuals like it is in real life. Besides getting known for being toxic is going to harm someone’s chances to advance in late game significantly more than the squelch can ever do.
---
It is an MMORPG, communities don’t need policing that much.
---
After playing the beta from Australia I can definitely say it never felt like this in vanilla. 
---
Everything feels unnaturally delayed. Attacking, controlling your pet picking up loot, loading the discovered points on the map, your selected talents or quests have this split second before it loads the content. 
---
There's this really jarring delay that feels really unnatural and I all around disliked the feel it gave to the game.
---
I'm all for an authentic experience but I think some recreations are a bit too far. The developers back then most likely put these things in place because people's PC and internet was still sucking as well as inferior server technology.
---
Those guidesnare missing the skills to focus on while leveling, which is important since you can gimp your gold towards your level 40 mount if you train every skill available.
---
There's a couple of private server bugs allowing for feral druids so I think they will have a harder time in classic, however I am not going to turn away a druid who wants to tank.
---
I'll give them a shot and see how they perform for a while before I start not inviting ferals to tank, some people seem to be making the decision before release.
---

I award you 8 out of 10 bruhs for this.
---

---
are you autistic lol
---
For my understanding: does that mean that you as a hunter can be in ranged mode at the same time the enemy is in melee range? I mean a tauren melee with leeway reach you above 10 yards away if I am not mistaken, but if a non tauren hunters deadzone is fixed to 5-8 yards you should be able to shoot back, right?
---
I misread, I thought you were quoting the "average" as in the average for the masses. I see now you were referencing your own average.
---
No what i'm suggesting is to remove the right click report because it is too easily abusable and it wasn't in vanilla.
---
It's called dead air
---
Most of the bugs aren't content related, but are related the the modern client vs vanilla content.
---
Go mage. Easy leveling, great for pvp, money grinding and also pve ... all the other classes are biased towards the one or other
---
Terrible, terrible damage
---
Shaman has much more utility, priest is more straight up healing.
---
Shaman has totems like grounding, tremor totems which provide some real strength to your allies. As well as elemental shamans can crank out some extreme burst.
---
But as someone else said, depends on what you have around you.
---
&gt; Typical behaviour from someone who in unable to dispute the facts presented to them.
---
we'll see when you'll present some actual facts.
---
&gt; counter any of the points!
---
You aren't making any points worth countering
---
&gt; Showing you literal screenshots from Blizzard themselves that show Bosses have shadow resist somehow isn't proof.
---
That Atlas was so utterly shit that's really cute you think it's proof of anything more than you being a total noob
---
I feel most alive whilst rapidly approaching death
---
You clearly do not understand the implications leeway has on the meta and how it actually does fuck hunters
---
Hey it’s almost like classic is a 15 year old game that hasn’t had some of the technology updates from the last decade...
---
Very relatable! 
---
Classic - where art thou
---
Go Hunter or shaman wouldn't be bad. You are looking at decent spell damage through the druid/priest, so something mail would round things out well.
---
Shaman would be really good for totems, amplifying the warrior and rogue nicely. Hunter might be good if you decide to solo. But if you are grouping 80% of the time, go shaman.
---
Because 12 year old alliance players need a written note from mom to do it
---
i was writing a long response but then i thought meh... you won't get it anyway. you're response shows the maturity level and intelligence i am conversing with.
---
Interesting how you never actually answered the question though.
---
OKI DOKI BUDDY :) 
---
Still waiting for you to counter the facts! Where is your proof about Atlas being incorrect then?
---

---
Yes it is something that can be googled. Not sure how you didn't know you could Google for videos but you can.
---
Oh shit. God damnit Blizzard. Although at least they didn't say anything about automatic punishments, though. I really hope they aren't THAT stupid.
---
No one is forcing you to see their messages, you are allowed to put them on ignore. It's of no consequence to you if they keep talking when you can no longer see it. Why are you SJWs so obsessed with policing thoughts and speech? Just mind your own business.
---
This is like the army reserves ads around years ago (or may be still current? I dunno). They’d show people in their normal attire for work/life and then they’d pull their shirt apart like superman does to show their military camo shirt underneath to symbolise “deep down this is what they truly are”. Only underneath our normal attire would be a wow/horde/alliance shirt

Can we please ban tattoo posts from r/classicwow ? I mean the retail sub is already flooded by those. Seriously.
---
Yessss!
---
Maybe having an example where all classes had different values was not the best idea.
---
I guess it would have made more sense in the scenario of no bias towards either of the competitors.
---
It still kinda helped me to do this. It feels kinda freeing because the considerations with my undecsiveness despite having a bias towards priest weren't very productive. Now I can concentrate fully on the chosen class and no longer have to feel so undecisive.
---
‘No problems detected’ seeing this brings the memories, I remember having issues with these launchers lol
---
I can feel you so much dude !
---
Depends how serious you are about PVP.  
---
If you PVP, level your weapon skill. You'll get small "accidental" hits on your target in PVP. Will they help? Only a tiny amount, but everything helps.  
---
I will admit that leveling weapon skill on a caster PVP is more useful as a class such a druid who might be holding a two hander and getting accidental hits here and there in and out of form shifts, but if you like to min/max, then it's an option.
---
Human priest is BIS in aq/naxx soz
---
Damn, that's a really nice offer! Thanks alot!
---
But my problem is space haha, I got none
---
&gt; The issue is your numbers are only coming from either BFA/Legion Levels or Wrath Pre Patch
---
&gt; That is the unknown variable and its not easily predictable
---
Which is why it basically can't be considered.
---
non-issue?
---
It fundamentally changes how the game plays. Please watch these two videos and see the HUGE difference mobs having leeway makes to Mage gameplay.

Classic: [https://youtu.be/67Z8MTAX-nQ](https://youtu.be/67Z8MTAX-nQ)

---
What's that?
---
I know stupid when I see it though
---
These are the objective arguments I expected :)
---
Without hostility and ganking that interaction would have not felt unique, important or memorable in any way to you - because it would be the norm. It's thanks to the WAR that you remember such a thing even happening in the first place.
---
&gt; You cannot target 1 guy and blow them up with shamans, they are using the same multi-box restrictions as BfA.
---
Can you explain this to me? I don't have play BFA
---
Yes, if your decision is between two classes that you value similar, you can skip the RNG and flip a coin and then decide you are not happy with the result and pick the other! :D
---
&gt; RP-PvP wasn't an option at launch
---
Neither was Russian or local Oceania servers.
---
BFA joke.
---
Not surprised...
---
 That is the only thing you see everyday when looking into the mirror afterall
---
But only if u post it on reddit!!1
---
It costs 100 mana so it's rather expensive, but still useful occasionally when leveling.
---
Well then there's nothing to be done. On the plus side it means a lot of free money for Blizzard.
---
r/trashy
---
It's not vanilla.
---
I don't give a fuck what some CS rep on the forums says. I have 2 years of CoC kiting vanilla memories and a bunch of videos like [https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8](https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8) to prove what they're saying is complete bullshit.
---
Mobs did NOT have extra range when both player and mob were moving.
---
Thanks! Sadly I don't have much in the works for other classes, it's a bit of an time consuming process and I suspect that there would be double or triple the amount of entries if we start digging into DPS classes!
---
I don't really get the point of these, you can't just look stuff up as you need it?
---
Classic is so slow paced, you don't need this at the ready.
---
That won't change. There will still be 3000 people in your layer just like it would be without it.
---
*your language.
---
And it takes one ticket to report the abuse of squelch function to get abusers banned.  
---
This happens 1-2 times and people start thinking about the abuse of the system.
---
I recently asked another player to please hide their recently equipped helmet from the option in the menu.
---
I reasoned my request by telling them that I liked their hair and found it to be sad I couldn't see it anymore.
---
That player agreed and did as I requested. :)
---
I dont care anymore, im gonna sell my soul to this game
---
I’m really curious what this would look like at max.
---
Once you go Horde, you never get bored
---
Unless this gets fixed I'm literally not even playing Classic.
---
Cone of Cold circle kiting is now pretty much impossible, because mobs have an extra 3 yard melee range...
---
His name is Robert Paulson.
---
It means that you stand still for 3 seconds to mount up but with aspect of the cheetah you can start running right away.
---
So it takes time for the increased speed of the mount to make up for those 3 seconds that was lost when mounting up.
---
So if you are going somewhere short then dismounting, then it is faster to just use aspect of the cheetah.
---
Standing by the bridge in AV, casting distract on people who are mounted so they run off the edge and have to go aaaaaalllll the way back up again.
---
Rain of Fire doesn't apply any CC effects, with the exception of Aftermath or Pyroclasm which are a 10% and 26% chance, respectively.
---
So how exactly do you *"remember this happening with my rain of fire"*?
---
Is that necessary?
---
You do your side no favors.
---
So there's no code specifically disallowing a shaman boxer to target a single person and end his family line with 1 button, right?
---
So you simply request Blizzard to hire more Gamemasters until there are enough to work on all tickets in a reasonable time?  
---
If you achieve this I will be very thankful but until then I appreciate to have a system to report spammers, exploiters etc.
---
Gonna be honest that’s way to much to read right now but I love the dedication you guys have in making classic as much like vanilla as possible
---
This one was a blast. I remember it took me hours to be able to do this quest because it was so difficult. I think that was the first and last time I did this quest.

I got a question for leveling a warrior regarding the specs: is alchemy and herbalism fine? I think it might be a good way to have some pots with you in sticky situations.
---
Pretty much the entiee desolace zone.
---
I don't even remember much from leveling my first character apart from that zone.
---
In WoTLK or sometime in a later expansion Blizzard made enemy players unable to target totems with macros. Why? Probably because at that point in time Blizzard considered it to be detrimental to Shamans as it was rather easy thanks to spell haste, GCD reduction and more classes having summons to remove totems.  
---
Because Classic is played in the Legion client and uses the new Macro API initially players couldn't macro-target enemy totems. Some players came to expect this as 'working as intended' but clearly it was not. Just like Hunters and Mages noticing a bit of a setback so do Shamans revert to their Vanilla roots with enemies being able to target their totems through Macros.
---
Matrix?
---
Yes, you are, but mostly because you can't figure out that to those you see as racist, people like you and your opinions are equally annoying to see in the chat. You are biased if you think some specific side needs to be silenced for some reason, rather than not interfering with players as a whole and letting each individual moderate which players messages they themselves can see.
---

No, but to be fair you can also potentially wield a legendary weapon if you raid enough, even if you're 7th in line or whatever, whereas hunters and priests are outta luck unless a guild is straight up meme-ing.

---
What am I supposed to be looking at?
---
Firstly, that's vs other players, not mobs.
---
Secondly, I don't even see any leeway.
---
&gt;None of the information you brought were actually in the game.
---
You're doing it again...
---
&gt;Pulling facts and figures out of your ass that are consequently proven to be incorrect
---
I feel like elemental shamans should be the gods of duels in most cases, but mages are tough, if you fail your grounding totem and then get hit by CS you'll most likely get nuked.
---
I haven't watched how the ele shamans of the beta play as I haven't watched the tournaments but I'm fairly sure that even amongst high end pvpers it's common to play the class entirely wrong in a 1v1 scenario. It's all about just auto hitting with flametongue, spamming totems, mitigating dmg, then burst once you have them at under 70% ~, never ever risk them bursting you down, just focus on keeping yourself above 70% hp and untill you can insta burst them you just need to focus on keeping yourself healthy.
---
This is cool but i remember the video too. And that's not it :[
---
This is a bit of a naive take. I'm sure this will fall on death ears however :).
---
I'm not sure how you can finish leveling in an hour. Possibly Freehold running, but that was nerfed quite hard in 8.2. Furthermore that was never "over in an hour". Additionally, you don't have any of the zone content done so you can't actually progress with the War Campaign and/or flying...which means you actually have to do the content, which you would have done anyways by leveling.
---
While BFA doesn't have a lot of character progression, it also doesn't have "zero". It has more than Classic at end game. In Classic, you have raiding and PvP. Like you can grind Rank 14 and raid Naxx over and over..that's pretty much it. Unless you want to farm your factions mounts, you really don't do a lot. Classic was more about the leveling than late game. In BFA you have raiding (which is much harder and more rewarding with much better class rotations), better PvP (WM, more BGs, arena, brawls, etc.). Furthermore you have to put in work to unlock flying, so if someone has it you know they have progressed through all the zones + rep + war campaign. As far as leveling character progression Classic has BFA beat, though I think that's just by the amount of expansions that retail WoW has now. I think the level squish will fix a lot of this.
---
Who actually rerolls because your spec isn't the top 1% (especially with the Azerite Necklace)? BFA is a much more balanced game. Multiple classes can actually raid tank well(and not just Warrior and occasionally Druid), all DPS specs are pretty viable (not like Feral/Balance druid or Ele/Enh Shaman) and are within some range of each other. Gearing is much better in the modern game, you don't have paladins wearing cloth or getting gear with weird stats on it. War/Titanforging is ass but gear on a whole is a lot better, at least at 120. 
---
[Raider.IO](https://Raider.IO) is the same thing as Gearscore from WotLK. It will exist in Classic as well in some quantifiable form or another. Players have always cared about gear score, even if it wasn't called gear score. That is the whole point of WoW, to get good gear and destroy other people in PvP or to push harder PvE content (which has a finite life in Classic). 
---
BFA has content that scales indefinitely. There is always something to do. Like in Classic once you do a dungeon that's it, you will never go back there. It's almost all wasted content. Raiding has a larger overlap but that as well becomes meaningless once Naxx is out. 
---
This is not to say BFA is perfect. It's not great and I cannot wait for classic and will be rolling Prot Warrior, but what you listed about BFA is not correct.
---
the bulk of content is not really testable in beta (a lot of the dungeons, the raids, and higher-level zones).
---
the cynic in me wonders if the 60 dungeons are as faceroll as the low-level ones and they don't want that to be evident.
---
Ironically I had that exact same bug on Feenix Emerald Dream back in 2013, except it was near the blood elves in hinterlands.
---
Hi guys, Myself and a friend are having the first 2 weeks off for the launch of classic WoW. We are looking for players who are interested and able to commit to grinding 5 man dungeons from 20-60 as an efficient way to level. We are a Paladin and Warrior. Any class welcome. Will be playing on oceanic server.
---
Best comment in the thread.
---
Contested zones no, you may be remembering being in the opposing factions zones
---
The idea and intention of spellbatching is that, as in f.e. this example 2 mages would cast sheep on each other simultaenously (as in: the both perceive it being cast at the SAME time, or player A might think he casted it slightly before player B due to lag/delay, when in fact on the server player B was slightly faster), that there should be a small "pity"-window for both players to get their spells off, rather than player A getting frustrated and ragequitting due to lag, or calling it a bug or a hacker.
---
But spellbatching should NEVER allow for exploitative behaviour and mechanics as in "opponent casts sheep, so now I cast sheep as well to counter it". If spellbatching is being abused to counterplay certain abilities or mechanics in ways absolutely not intended, then it becomes a massive problem. 
---
It just makes absolutely no fkng sense that you should be able to interrupt or counter a 1.5s casttime spell which would cc/disable you AFTER you've noticed the opponent starting to cast it, by casting a similar spell which also has 1.5s casttime. That just completely defies any logic, basic common sense, and good game design.
---
Tldr: Just exactly the same as with rightclick-report or layering, its not the system itself thats bad, its the players exploiting those systems in completely unintended ways which are bad. Thats still more than enough of a reason to either remove or change something about those systems.
---
Well, yes, mages are a top class in vanilla. Only warriors can compare. Warriors have weaknesses in solo play, mages have weaknesses in gorup play when it comes to pvp.
---
For PVE both are excellent classes, however warrior has the advantage due to also being able to tank.
---
When you just look at dueling oturnaments mages seem overpowering due to polymorph, but keep in mind, that a) there were no druids in this tournament and b) polymorph isn't that good in gorup pvp. It can be dispelled and the mage has more threats to handle. Mages are still very strong yes, but they do have vulnerabilities in group pvp.
---
I uh meant RFD the one from the last boss my bad
---
their marketing folks are experts at date-based shenanigans.
---
You can miss totems mobs put down in ulda so I assume you can miss player torems
---
I always thought classic had the best looking raid gear. The later expansions go way over the top.
---
I'm in the same boat my man.
---
Was 24 when WoW came out, turning 39 this month. Been playing WoW off an on ever since, but excited about Classic and being able to return to where it all started. Retail is ok, but I miss Vanilla.
---
Hey don't make fun of Starcraft Brood war!
---
As a Swede, I had under 50 back in the day. Routing from Norway shouldn't add another 30 ms compared to me, if you played on eu realms in Germany.
---
No they don't. Leeway only affects players, not mobs. How come half the people on this sub don't even look into the matter before running their mouth.
---
Mages can't turn into a cheetah, druid wins.
---
or you know, just choose what looks cool.
---
Leeway is objectively present for mobs as well.
---
Nope, you are.
---
Really, that Atlas was laughable even back then. Seeing someone using it as "proof" in 2019 shows how fucked up private servers scene actually is.
---
Good lord, none of you kids actually ever played the game.
---
In the middle of the NIght Elves attempting to genocide the Horde race on the whims of an hitler metaphor invulnerable demi-god and, the Orcs turn to literally anything they can to survive.
---
They don't know its demon blood, it was literally a trap by Mannoroth who knew that Cenarius would act like a complete lunatic and drive the Orcs to desperation to survive.
---
Get out with your complete lack of Warcraft III knowledge kid.
---
Ah right, yeah just download the client via bnet.
---
This may be a weird place to draw a red line, but if I can't abuse hamstring kiting on mobs while leveling, I don't think I'll be very interested to level at all.
---
this will be me:
---
\- hyped for classic for like a year
---
\- watch loads of videos i dont need to watch about gold farming, class tricks, leveling routes
---
\- talk to my friends who are playing, link up with old guildies
---
\- made a complicated spreadsheet to plan my pre-raid gear, where i need to farm etc
---
\- will probably ding 60, clear MC and BWL fairly easily cos i've done it plenty before, go into raidlogging mode
---
\- still bored in life
---
no, it isn't, not even close.  I find this an interesting decision.
---
my theory is the tuning issues in low-level dungeons persist in the higher dungeons and they are not keen to have them compared with vanilla pre-release (higher level dungeons are much better documented than the rest).  who knows what state early raids are in , as well.

I think it is worth remembering the attack power normalization error was only caught a month into beta, and only due to 1) the original values being factually known and 2) a poster providing extensive documented evidence that the legion values somehow were still present.  most bugs simply don't have the comparative evidence pool this one did.
---
Love it
---
I've taken that into consideration for devaluing the druid, as I don't think a bear on whom you can't see any items, looks cool.
---
Doesn't change the fact that the UK is still advantaged compared to most European countries, do you think lappland has lower ping than Scotland to servers in France?
---
The Wrath and Judgement sets are my jam.
---
Yeah I agree, people learning how to play the game was definately a big factor of it. And that's probably the main reason why it was a problem in the earlier stages.
---
Wow, so after you used baseless abysmal arguments for weeks even stating (I quote) "Australia isn't getting servers" but you made a post today so therefore all the past absurd arguments you posed are redundant? Can I use this strategy in my workplace? When I have an argument with the family?
---
I would never shit in the office.
---
Question: will we be able to download the game before we can reserve our 3 names or how will that work?
---
Also rogues have detect trap.
---
Good! But words may not be as persuasive as actions! Better keep up the brownie points when wow hits and leave little notes that say: "This service was brought to you by wow classic and blizzard entertainment."
---
Not at all specific to the Frostwolves. The Shadowmoon were the most spiritual and almost a peaceful clan. You can still be "savage" and have reverence in nature and the elements; that's kind of what shamanism is and the old orc race has always been defined as a shamanistic society.
---
I came to the same conclusion as you did.

Local infrastructure absolutely matters, again, outside of London and a couple of the very big cities in the U.K the infrastructure to the houses, along the streets etc, is really really bad in the U.K. I couldn't say for Lapland but I can state categorically that the Swedish mates I game with get consistently better pings in games than I do and Sweden is a little bit further from France/Luxembourg (Common data centres) than the U.K.

Welcome to half of academia.
---
&gt;So we've been hoodwinked?  This isn't actual how it worked in Vanilla and the Blue Post is feeding me false information?
---
Yes.
---
They are cutting back on GMs for Classic substantially from the Vanilla days. This would be such a common issue and would take so much time to parse out that this solution is highly impractical/improbable.
---
The neckbeard invasion of Blizzard servers come August 27th will be bigger than anyone dreams of.

Turning 43 in August and coming back to WoW after quitting during Cata. Already levelled chars to 60,40, 2x30 and 20 on a Pserver since middle of March this year in preparation. 
---
My wife is only semi amused...
---
Already infected my 10yo to play WoW with me.
---
if you choose to play on a server on the other side of the pacific ocean instead of one in sydney you can't really complain...
---
Why didn't we see this on private servers?
---
How good is raid gear compared to PVP gear on druids for PVP? Mostly want to flag carry and 1v1. Is the PVE gear much stronger or would the pvp gear be good enough?  
---
I'm just thinking if its worth it to main one or just have it as an alt I can just pvp on the side.
---
&gt; baseless 
---
I don't think you know what that word means.
---
He was a god on Arthas before Aurora transfered. Insane damage in that video.
---
this
---
so what ?
---
I guess someone has to be the highest per layer, will be tough to do if the stress tests are any indication.
---
I'm so glad wow has top tier streamers again, love what these guys do. People gotta remember they out here to entertain us, and they doing a mighty fine job of it.
---
First of I never played on a private server. Second I never said that warriors where not superior tanks what I said was druids can do it and some fights like patchwerk and hateful strike tanking and maby treath limited fights like vael (al tho this will have to be seen as we still have no data from level 60 gamplay) are better done by ferals. Warriors will still be the number one tank but I do believe most guilds will run a feral "offtank" that maintanks a couple of bosses. Lastly eaven tho I have not played on private servers and the numbers on private servers may be wrong ( in some cases more and in some cases less) it is not like we knew everything back in vanilla and all the knowledge gained on private is meaningless.
---
Owell it has no impact on anything I said so that's probably why I don't know about it.
---
There's no max speed abilities pre lvl 20 anyway.
---
Same thing here. As much as I REALLY want to relive my nostalgia, I have been playing Horde since 2007. Played Orcs in Warcraft 2 and 3 also. I will try Alliance this time and see the other side.
---
We don’t know that for sure tho. I’m very curious to see  what vanilla private servers will be like after Classic comes out. If the remaining ones update their data with values from Classic, they might just be closer to vanilla than Classic.
---
Yes but definitely no. Cable internet was not widely available or popular back then. 40-80 was not a "norm" back then. It was simply possible.
---
I think Shaman (esp tauren) vs Mage looks like matchup the most influenced by leeway.
---
it was flat ground, at the worgen just north-west of Darkshire. Mage getting annihilated by worgen +10yd away from him.
---
Am I supposed to watch the full 8 hour video? Can you at least post a time stamp to when he tabs to the private server?
---
Cable internet didn't surpass dial up until 2005.

---
34 coming to play with the other gaming OAPs, was 20 when i started playing, sadly not having holiday to play on launch but will be playing after work daily
---
Not leeway, obviously. Were you not an imbecile, you could have figured that out.
---
No one is saying that that is not a bug, obviously that needs to be fixed. But you need to stop calling it melee leeway and talking about it in conversations about melee leeway, since it obviously has nothing to do with that, as melee leeway is a PvP only mechanic.
---
Mobs can not activate melee leeway.
---
&gt; Since these design decisions are about the player experience and not the exact configuration of the back end or technical limitations (such as allowing mass mail), I implore the development team on World of Warcraft: Classic to use a significantly reduced event loop cycle time such that the rate of success for double Crowd Control is similar for players on modern "average" connections to what it was for players on "average" connections during the era of vanilla.
---
Even if your numbers are a bit off, this is the key conclusion here.
---
If beta doesn't *feel* like Classic then something is wrong. The *experience* should be the same, not the behind-the-server numbers which are subject to various issues/errors/miscalcs.
---
Gnome because I’m Alliance mage and humans suck
---
Of course, that's how people organize with their friends ahead of time.  Isn't that automatic for a mmo?
---
The stress test is the actual client we’ll be playing on, so just set up your entire UI there and then once character creation goes live on the 12/13th copy your WTF folder over.
---
What the fuck is "name reservations?"   Sounds like some idiot retail shit that creeped in.  Like, you can't just use first come first serve when people log in?   Fucking blizzard...
---
I'm disappointed it hasn't gained much traction unfortunately, but I'm going to mentioning it everywhere in the hopes a Blizz dev sees it. I think it covers all the bases of layering and still gives the best immersion/Classic experience, with none of the layer hopping exploits.
---
Yes there will never be more than 3k people online in your world and mist of them won't be in the same zone as you. At the very most you'll see 400 people in your starting zone at launch
---
tainting your skin? nope.
---
ah ok thanks!
---
Doesn't this just make half of the immediate future content way too easy for anyone who already did Naxx? Anyone that's already done Naxx is gonna be *really* bored if 5 of the 7 the raids in 1.13-1.16 are catch up raids.
---
No, I, like many others used the *italics*fact*italics* that all server post WoD pre-patch in Oceania have been hosted in Australia and there has never been any information, *italics*ever*italics*, posted by Blizzard that this would not be the case going forward. That is much stronger evidence that scrunching up some non-related argument about German *italics*language*italics* servers (which were still hosted in Germany).
---
I restate the argument, most of us predicted, which factual base confirmed by precedent, that oceanic servers would be in Australia. 
---
You simply used an argument that broke precedent, was unrelated, baseless, and most importantly buddy, **bold**proven wrong.**bold**

Yeah i was kinda bad sports no accepting the lose. He would have gained so much more respect and followers if he wasn't a lil bitch like that. But the fact that he got lucky to get the beta invite and is still streaming private servers makes me more angry.
---
Layering hasn't even properly been tested and people want to fix it. God damn.
---
ahh true
---

---
Maybe, it is supported in the beta right now though.
---
They have a CD and some will share a CD with other trinkets of similar type
---
I wish the Alliance symbol was a little less.. Flashy? I like the simplicity of the Horde symbol.
---
People have much better internet nowadays. Leeway isn't compensating for latency, it's actually buffing melee classes.
---
Long batches is like being killed behind a cover/corner in a shooter. It's annoying, unfair and nobody wants that, except for apparently some classic players.
---
I will start playing on September 1st, avoiding crashes, queues, waiting 2h to loot a mob and having a look where the big Spanish community lands. When I start playing, 80% players will be leaving The Barrens/Westfall.

Yup, classic - spellbatch = retail. Totally not a slippery slope...
---
He had some health issues, I hope he is ok.

maybe a stupid hashtag oversimplifies where different people stand on an issue

I'm curious about what people think about rogue. As a melee class they should be able to benefit. But also being a class that does a lot of reset/kiting. Which side are they on overall?
---
You listed your region as "US EAST - PVP" which heavily implies a a pvp server, yet posted to the pve thread.  Which are you?

More interested in the location of Mankrik’s wife.

Ah okay, hope he will feel better soon.

Is having character name changes that bad? Especially if the forced name change is placed on characters that are inactive. In practice you may only have to rename an alt you rarely play.
---
Alivewind pass
---
I played vanilla wow in net cafes with 30-60 people.
---
It didnt change, but it did spread... I dont know how ppl remember things but here cable was just a minority, like 10% of the playerbase on those years... RDSI was the standard with ADSL just releasing... a lot of ppl talking but noone seems to  that, when anyone nearby was using internet, oh god you really noticed it.
---
For some countrys cable became the standard 5-6 years ago, at most... I can talk just about my ping but i was averaging 300-400 with RDSI and like 200~ on adsl... obv things had changed with cable.
---
1-60, yes, there's more warriors. At 60, mages are the most played class.
---
Good god you both are heretics and should be purged from this realm for even suggesting such madness
---
It's already timestamped. If you're on mobile try copying the link and opening it in Chrome
---
most feedback to player density in the last stress test was too many players not enough mobs.  likely means we'll get many very small cap layers on launch and not have to worry about it.  tl;dr sharding
---
\- You can certainly complete some parts of the content without a full raid IF people are ok geared.
---
\- Some Off-specs do work, Shadow priest is a good example for buffing shadow damage (which raises raid DPS)
---
\- Some specs DO NOT work in some content, Fire mages in Molten Core for example will have issues.
---
\- The more optimal the raid set-up the quicker the raid will kill stuff.
---
There seems to be a factor that I've not seen brought forward yet: Healer Mana.
---
I remember when we first started BWL in Vanilla, Razergore was a tough one due to co-ordination, and Vaelstraz was an absolute DPS check, we spent a lot of time slowly edging up our DPS each week as we farmed MC until we got him down. But one thing I do remember when we didn't have full raids, was healers running Out-of-Mana if the fights dragged on for too long. 
---
If you bring sub-optimal specs, your healers will be the ones having to pick up the slack as fights take longer than expected, or tanks don't mitigate damage properly, meaning more healing, this means even more that they will have to min-max to make up for the other classes slacking off.  Healers can already have a hard enough time farming outside raids with all their amazing healer gear, I only survived raiding in Vanilla by help from guild mates and because my girlfriend played a Mage and we farmed together to get mats for all our potions and flasks. It took me years to get an epic mount due to all of the consumable costs of raiding, yet all the DPS guys got better at farming with each item of gear they obtained and tried to slack off on consumables. So yeah, you can take sub-optimal specs into a raid, but it'll be your healers who are paying for it, which personally, I don't think is that fair...
---
As elemental you have a decent time getting mail gear(most healing shamans won't want tier gear until t3 and there are some good off pieces) and shield. For weapons (if you can get hand of Edward the od from ah you are golden), rings and neck you have to go whit pre raid blues (if you are not really lucky) until zg and when that instance unlocks be prepared to run it a lot. Over all gearing is fairley easy. As enhancement it is alot harder to get gear only easy part is weapons. Enhancement also falls if alot in power the better ppls gear get and there really are not enough gear out there for you
---
I’d suggest finding an instant 60 private server and mess around some to see what you actually like
---
Not true- AOE leeway exists, meaning that base moving nova range is 12 yards. Plus every "meta" mage pvp spec except for pom pyro includes arctic reach
---
I mean a white board isn’t that big of a step up to get out of scuffed... I’m personally on team cardboard cuz it makes me giggle, but yea

To be fair Asmon is also a fucking disgusting mong of a person who will happily live in a gigantic pile of mold and wipe his blood on the fucking wall so it also makes sense that he wouldn't care about the quality of paper he writes on.
---
pssst dont tell!
---
Some guy was making a guide on how to get to level 10 without competing with anyone for mobs, just by doing fetch quests and explo.
---
One of the ways you can tell something is good or liked?  Bursts of hate posts and trolls, the ones that cling to you as they drown.  At the very basic nature of uskind, there is this dark rage, envious jealousy of others or objects and places.  Most can just ignore the ticks, the whispers from behind ears or above  eyes.  We grew up around them, games of trickery often followed by tears or bloodlets from a scraped knee or ego.  That ego is a pest.  
---
Venruki was great and rekindled my itch for the ice blow
---
Yes? The hit/miss calculation is identical.
---
This will get upvotes because it's a nice picture, but it's actually a terrible idea
---
Great. If by being a "good player" I should sacrifice anything I value  (namely a playstyle) I must be a masochist, isn't it? It's the same as always. Follow the sheep or go to hell. 
---
The "wasted time" argument is a common fallacy which can be turned against so damn easily. These individuals are being pushed into wasting theirs by following a path they don't want to. It is a perception issue on min-maxing which ignores enjoyment in their equation. 
---
By this definition the church did *warn* people about being left-handed and pushed people against it. Was that a good thing to do? To avoid them wasting resources into different needs?
---
Im so torn between Mage and Pala. 
---
Played the same Pala since vanilla to legion but am undecided if i want to heal.   
---
Pro: In Raids and organized Teams its okay. I love the class fantasy. Epic-Mount Quest is hands down the best quest ever. 
---
Con: What if i dont have the time to play in Teams and have to solo? Solo farming sucks, not sure if i want to heal alone and i dont have to time to bring solid damage as a Pala.
---
Mage:
---
Pro: Viable alone as well as in Team. Fantasy is okay. Portals.
---
Con: Isn´t Pala...
---
Any Ideas?
---
Sadly it is allowed, And sadly there will not be specific realms where MB is allowed. this would be an actual solution, because normal players (who have skill and thus don’t need mb) wouldn’t be bothered or impaired by these no skill people who need to compensate.
---
My method - being on holiday. In Wales of all places... :picard:
---
If you are 100% playing hour 1 launch just go grab flight paths and explore. You will most likely pass everyone in leveling since  majority of the leg work will be over.
---
Guess he is in Sweden haha   :D
---
But yeah you are right, never thought of him until this post.
---
Hope he is back with some Warrior-action.
---
Definitely better than US launching in the middle of the day, though there will still be *thousands* of us logging in at 11/12. I'll be up all night, there's absolutely no chance I'm gonna be able to sleep knowing Classic is live.
---
Oh man that thing is auctioning for a lotta cash right now, wonder how much it'll cost by the end.
---
The only real solution is for Blizzard to redesign the itemization with all raids mind.
---
As in "here is where players start at, here is where they end at", then scale everything proportionally.
---
it's not getting that many upvotes
---
but thanks for saying it's a nice picture
---
I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just wondering where you're getting your info from?  I remember meleeing totems as a caster (no hit%) but I don't remember ever missing.
---
No one said that, but if you think any group deserves special treatment, that makes you pretty pathetic. Fact remains that blacks/gays and other minority groups are the most privileged groups in all 1st world nations, and what do you people do with all of that privilege? You lie and pretend like you're some weak, oppressed victims that deserve more, MORE, everything.
---
You will never be taken seriously in the adult world if you keep that kind of attitude about silencing freedom of speech and playing victim olympics. Grow up, minorities.
---
What up, homie! It'll be human male again. Can't change that for the sake of nostalgia.
---
Not a fucking chance that it's going to play out this way. For $15 for a month of high quality mmorpg gameplay you're going to have a constant flow of new wow players.
---
95% sure I've settled on rogue for launch after leveling one up on a p server over the summer. Makes leveling on a PvP server much easier.
---
I never said they were the same. The distinction between them becomes arbitrary at some point. How could we ever judge that one person go too much outside help during leveling?
---
I'm pretty sure you can install Luna Unit Frames and only use the raid frames. Those are the best raid frames (and easiest to set up) I've tried - prefer them over Grid.
---
Correct
---
Ok, i see. Seems kinda fucked up, is it a bug or something not sorted out yet or a feature? :)
---
Thanks, dude! Be sure to post it if you decided to do it! ;) I would like to see it!
---
And I believe Duskwood was called Brightwood.
---
TBH I don't recall personally doing, this but I safely assume I did. I only noticed this was a thing when I started moonlighting as Tank and Healer classes. 
---
As Tank, I've come to accept that the mob will come back when the DPS is dead.  
---
As Healer, I've come to accept I should be standing on Tank for when the dead DPS inevitably kited into another pack.
---
IMO people only learn if there are mistakes to learn from.
---
Exploration is a laughably terrible route for leveling efficiency.
---
The majority is a very specific marketing term in this instance. The majority live inside 4, maybe 5 cities? As soon as you step outside those cities it plummets. I'm 25 minutes by car on a motorway from the outskirts of Edinburgh and my connection gives me about 8 down through Steam on a good day with nobody else in the house using the net and hardwired. I'm also in one of the more affluent and recently upgraded towns (lots of new build houses) so my cabling is going to be relatively new and reasonably up to spec.
---
why not?
---
Ah... I see... alliance scum then.
---
Lok‘tar ogar!
---
It wasnt really called anything. On the map from the old War Craft 1 manual, Karazhan is refered to as "Medivhs tower" and its placed among a bunch of jagged rocks on the map.
---

---
Grenades are part of vanilla pvp.
---
They were funny but they talk too much in between duels. The post-duel analysis should be short and concise so the next duel can start as soon as the duelers are ready, so that cds won't reset. Even the participants were complaining and starting duels on their own because they were tired of waiting so much. It's not a blizz tournament guys, no need to stretch it out as much as possible. The 30 tournament went better in this regard.
---
Hunter is still okay I would say. Especially in Tier 1 and q bow/stave will be pretty good!

Could someone explain to me what "Melee leeway" is?

everyone should have engineering like everyone should have first aid
---
He’s too obsessed with US politics atm.
---
yikes
---
The gankers make the tournaments more fun to watch. Change my mind.
---
what he means is that its something that needs to be done anyhow. Use the time to do it when u cant kill 5 boars. When your done, go back to questing and with a few startup levels.
---
Weapon skill is irrelevant in PvP, the game always assumes you're at the maximum skill for your level when fighting the opposing faction.
---
i really like your idea!
---
There are things a friendship survives - this is not one of them.
---
It's working as intended apparently
---
I don't have beta access but you can literally watch any of the leeway videos on youtube.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE#t=2m15s
---
(This is a hunter that is 10-11 yards out that can't auto shot) 
---
If I were you I'd try not to go for 7 year old baby-tantrum mode, its literally been shown/proven dozens of times in a BUNCH of videos.
---
'till you die
---
49 here.  Wife is the same age.  Our oldest guildie (that is coming back with us to Classic) is 59.
---
A steady flow of new players ain't so bad. You might need to wait 5 minutes for Sarkoth to spawn because someone killed him recently, but it isn't anything compared to having to compete with 150 other people for Sarkoth on launch day.
---
If you're looking for beta player opinion you should ask one of the streamers playing hunter
---
Is Blackcrow not in the game at launch? 
---
Cats aren’t the greatest for leveling- owls have excellent AoE threat through screech, and boars have charge. 
---
Always open with Autoshot.
---
Your spec.. it’s pretty horrible. 5/5 AotH AND 5/5 Endurance training? Skipping Mortal Shots leaves a lot of damage you’re missing out on. There’s a lot of misinformation within this post, and it hurts unfortunately.
---
&gt;I've always found that idea of "games v real life" strange. There is no "real life" because it's all real life. Video games, sporting matches, lovers, work, quiet moments alone. That's what life is and every part of it is as serious as any other part.
---
By that I mean that your life "outside the game" is important in order to support your "life inside the game" (don't know how to say it differently). If you are longing to go back to "the game" while everything else doesn't matter to you then there is - in my opinion - something wrong.
---
No. Not everyone should have engineering. Engineering is a primary skill, you only get two. If every single person went engineering then the economy would collapse. 
---
First aid is a secondary profession, everyone can get it.
---
You obviously don't use your computer enough if you think 4 monitors is useless.
---
\-makes duels too long
---
\-makes it boring for  the audience
---
\-and it feels wrong, it's called a "**duel**" when you think about what the word duel means 2 characters drinking and eating and ignoring each other doesn't seem like it fits the term.  
---
ofc this is just my opinion.
---
I can't believe no one used thorium grenades. Ven's "the big one" is kinda shit by comparison imo
---
Vanilla world and BG PvP yes. Not duels.
---
By such logic, living action potions should be allowed too.
---
Intentionally misspelling a name you read 2 seconds ago to seem more uninterested is more cringy to me.
---
thats pretty much what they do now. except instead of nuking all your gears stats at the end of an expansion you level up. they did redesign itemization at the end of vanilla to do this, crit/hit % became rating so it could scale down as you level up.  
---
the best way i've seen itemization done is vanilla where early raid tier itemization is absolute shit and as you get to the high end it becomes really good and specific to who it benefits and how. i.e. mc gear has spirit,int,agility. naxx gear, agi,stam,hit,crit.   
---
it allows early tier items to be powerful but not dumpster everything the moment you've completed your first raid powerful like retail is. while also making dungeon gear relevant even after the first raid tier because its stats are strictly better for a chosen role than some early raid items.  
---
i don't think they should change or add to classic though, i think they should keep it as close to vanilla as possible, fuck it up as little as possible then make changes to the modern game if they think they're good changes.
---
Ok thank you. Do you know if they as bugged as people are complaining about? It's hard to tell since everyone bitches about everything
---
Not me, a family friend.
---
It is still important in order to support his "more fun life".
---
Besides, if someone is unhappy in his job then maybe that person shouldn't drown its sorrow in WoW (or any other kind of drug) and instead look for a job that doesn't make them miserable.
---
I misunderstood downranking and down voting. My mistake. I will edit.
---
I have to say I havent started my research yet (im a researching guy, honest!), but now that Im here Im just gonna ask and do it the lazy way: is there a dedicated site where ppl get their 1.12 addons from?
---
Please stop arbitrarily replying to my posts, since you didn't reply to every post I've ever made on reddit you're just picking posts arbitrarily.
---
lmao do you really think so?
---
Also regardless, you'd still have been muted or temp banned so the problem still stands.
---
"one of the guides says it has good healing potential in PvP. But the other guide says it is not as good as Shaman healing in PvP"
---
That right there is the issue. At some point I think you have to say fuck guides and play what you want. To me it's mind boggling that people are planning every tiniest aspect of the whole journey before it's even begun when in reality I highly doubt that most of it matters at all. You're going to able to PvP as both.
---
They break the EULA.
---
no youre a comedian
---
I thought you were done?
---
Oh fuck that. It's scary but way too plausible.
---
&gt;Depends what your priorities; gathering skills can be leveled while you’re getting to 60 but you’ll have to finish it off st the end
---
Yep. One thing to consider though with gathering is bag space if you are taking herb/mining and skinning as well.

 I had planed at first to go for mining+skinning if I roll a warlock but decided against it after some consideration. On a fresh server the access to big bags are a long way off. Inventory space will be very bad for quite a while especially for something like a hunter or warlock( don't plan to use a shard bag for leveling though). If you have to neglect picking up items or return to a vendor more then you otherwise would have you are basically throwing away free money.
---
which is even more concerning, is launch supposed to be the test period?
---
Don't play a mage. Melee leeway completely breaks them. https://youtu.be/9H_BrXp3jTM?t=412
---
ele shaman is really strong in classic at 60 and you can own people pretty easily the biggest problem with ele sham is having the gear
---
Considering you're already level 28 you would have to back track to level gathering profs. Crafting profs are a major gold sink and I would recommend saving gold until at least 60% mount. But if you get that prof itch have at it; it's entirely up to you!
---
I still don‘t think blizzard will use content like uldum and hyjal they already used in expansions. I think they will go (if they do it at all) for new stuff like a scarlet raid someone suggested
---
Best to wait with crafting professions until lvl 60.
---
I think ore and herbs won't spawn fast enough to lvl gathering without spending hours extra in the starting zones.
---
I played on a PS launch, it was really hard to lvl professions. I made a route where most people wasn't and ran around a few node spawns that usually spawned there, worked but was slow.
---
Since most players are unavailable to lvl gathering before leaving the low lvl zones it means that you get almost all the mid/high lvl resources for yourself if you do it.
---
Skinning doesn't really slow you down, only if you are really speed lvling. So that I think is a pretty good profession.
---
Who gives a fuck? Just ignore them its not like people are gonna die if they read the N word on the internet. It's not a "tacit endorsement". The ignore function is 100% non exploitable unlike right click reporting and it achieves the same affect. Some people actually enjoy shitposting trolls I.E barrens chat, and if you don't like it ignore them instead of calling big bwother on them to come put those naughty naughty boys in detention. The argument for kids not seeing it is fuckin' dumb because theres a profanity filter anyway
---
Would you pay 20 bucks just to report someone? :o
---
Sounds like a bug
---
Ok:) Its been a looong time
---
I could def get on board with channels.
---
Don't play a ranged toon. Melee leeway completely breaks them. Look at https://youtu.be/9H_BrXp3jTM?t=412 for reference. Hunters and mages get the worst of it as they rely on kiting the most.
---
Cool. Im testing this
---
i really am glad they didn't pander to the people complaining about no transmog in classic and put it in but likewise i would say it's not needed anyway, most of the good looking kit is the top tier stuff in classic, like the hand of rag or something from KT in naxx, so the fact it isn't in is mostly irrelevant  as you would want to show off your kit anyway
---
Team up as 5 and immediately start killing mods 5-6 levels higher than me.
---
That should give me the boost to get out of the starter area and then move on to mid-tier quests and dungeons as early as possible.
---
Yes, and its not authentic becauss they didnt back then except for harassment and death threats which are real issues
---
The question is especially pvp wise gonna get good.  Orcs are obviously really racially top tier.  Their stun resist goes off any attempt plus AP boost cooldown AND don't that get a bonus with axe?  But on the other hand if a boxer outreaches your own jabs it doesn't matter how pretty you move your feet.  Someone threw out yd numbers like 12 away?  That seems insane
---
Level your wand skill, and try to level your other weapons skills for those moments where the mob you're trying to kill is immune to your wand.
---
S A L T
---
It's working exactly like it did in vanilla. People are just basing what they "know" on how it works in private servers that have gotten it wrong.
---
Guess I gotta remember to keep my wow client running and logged in while at work.
---
Shared DRs for what? I figured,  out of all the classes i wanted to main, it probably gonna be a hunter, since above all I want to be a character that can stand on his own in world pvp and outdoor adventuring.
---
Wrong.
---
U know some people still don't have NBN right
---
Hey at least you aren't thinking of playing druid!
---
Careful guys we got the edgy anime protagonist over here. Hes gonna pull out his blue eyes white dragon after that line
---
Oh god. That's temporary right?
---
True that.
---
I've seen the video, he was definitely not at 12 yards.
---
It’s never to late to recreate....?
---
Again, some of those are good against specific classes. And doesn't giving classes with no healing abilities free instant heals make them significantly stronger..? I dunno, just guessing, someone else is probably far better qualified to answer.
---
Where did i said that i want him banned. I told one guy that he can report him, its up to twitch if he get banned or not.
---
Are you connecting to the same server that you were connecting to in 2004?
---
Yes and have a report button makes it much easier to deal with these issues
---
signed.
---
I'll turn 40 in November. I have a 14 years old girl that doesn't want to try Classic, but sometimes she plays retail. Guess I'll have to look for a pocket healer somewhere else.
---
Then what's the point of the post
---
Yes, they confirmed: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887/23

If
---
You’ll be able to kill 5 boars. Not every single quest is a bottleneck, just a few of them, and you simply skip those if they are too bad. Simply grinding mobs&gt;exploration eco.
---
To summarize: The opponent shouldn't be allowed to use abilities and consumables I can't use.
---
Sounds like the explanation of how Vanilla could become today's retail.
---
I was 22 and started a week after launch. I could never really get into wow after WotLK, and I even took time off during most of BC. 
---
Beta has been a blast and I can't wait for Classic in August.

Many thanks!

OK, thats why i said technically

Wait till you see the mind control on his forehead!

If you're able to cc someone and get out of combat than I dont see a problem with eating in a duel.

Just like in arena you always see healers drinking when they get a chance. 
---
Just part of the game.

Use what resources you have available.
---
Deadzone in Beta begins at 11 yrds for all races, except Tauren, when it begins at 14. There exists no race where deadzone begins at the listed 8 yrds.

Agree to disagree. Bigotry and conservatism can overlap. Many people in politics have bigoted views. In punks opinion if you disagree with him (conservative views) you’re just an idiot. That’s a bigot.
---
Check out the the crevasse between loch Modan and the badlands. This map seems to be pre-Dark Portal and post-Cataclysm simultaneously.
---
Ya. I get that part. I'm joking about how a similar bug for mages would let you PoM two spells out, if that's how spell batching interacted with buffs. 
---
That was actually a bug at one point in time. I can't remember which patch. It had nothing to do with leeway tho. PoM would just not drop off.
---
Happy cake day though! It’s all love
---
Should have been Warcraft 3 Human campaign. Orcs and Humans is to broad with too many interesting events that are only loosely related to show a coherent introductory story in 3 hours.
---
Our private server guild did simple /roll for maybe a month, the introduced classleaders and lootcouncil. It indeed doesn't seem wise to introduce lootcouncil when officers don't know the raiders.
---
The Horde are one of the factions in WoW.
---
So if I took engineering over alchemy or herbalism I would get the benefits of engineering but I would have to rely on someone else for herbs or potions, what does engineering provide that makes it worth doing this?
---
(I’m new to WoW so I honestly don’t know)
---
In vanilla almost every guild used DKP system.
---
Each raid that people does they get some dkp points.
---
Each item they get they use up some dkp points.
---
The item goes to the one with highest dkp points (likely a priority on things for main spec also).
---
One of the biggest flaws with the system is that people can't really catch up to the others dkp points if they join late or doesn't participate in every raid. Although I think there is a version that tries to make sure that people don't gain excessive amounts of dkp.
---
Another flaw is that people pass on almost every item since they want that one amazing item before everyone else in the guild, so they want to try to be highest on total dkp.
---

---
You sure? Realms change for sure and also charakter names etc. Not sure how the setting in wtf are strucured though
---
That just creates a system whereby duellers have to keep stacks of 27 different potions keybound on top of their class abilities and are expected to learn when and where to use each on. That doesn't sound fun whatsoever. I'd guess keeping it to something simple like engineering removes excessive complications. Bombs and pets, done.
---
Don’t know anything g about him but I recently made the mistake of watching one his videos and it was easily the worst wow vid I’ve ever seen. Zero brain power. Guy makes Payo look like...well, still an ass..but maybe not as much as a dumbass.
---
But the whole point of the already implemented spell batching is to replicate the feel of the old hardware. Either take spell batching out or reduce the window. The current version is game breaking.
---
I mean... Connected realms are effectively a server merge where everyone gets to keep their name. It could be worse.
---
You sure? Realmnames change for sure and also charakter names etc. Not sure how the setting in wtf are strucured though
---
You = dumb nerd
---
Is that beautiful?
---
No, it was called BRM after its formation when Thaurissan caused it to be raised. It's a strange coincidence that there's also an Orc clan with that name (turns out volcanos happen on all planets with tectonic plates).
---
If you're in no rush to 60, levelling the profs whilst levelling is pretty good.
---
World of Warcraft: Reloaded
---
the point about gearing ele shamans is a myth invented by noobs, totally not the case.
---
I’m an alt-aholic so of course I like t-mog and want it in classic, but oh well.
---
Fear spam, probably, yeah.
---
"Doesn't sound fun" is subjective.
---
If you wanna say bombs only then, does that include arcane bombs? You think a 1k mana drain, 500 damage and a silence is balanced?
---
No. Whoever created the character first gets to keep the name. Imposters get an X or other letters appended to their name and a free name change.
---
No it's not.
---
Kultiras on the right of Gilneas ...? They lied to me
---
Have an upvote. You made me smile on the way to work. Thank you. STV Gorilla Warfare FTW
---
better off going down holy and to use smite as your main dps, then respeccing at 40 when you've got shadowform and mind flay becomes better at that stage.
---
Haha. He made a warrior guide and half the items he suggests aren’t even in phase 1. I think he just watches other videos and makes his own bs version of it.
---
The painter of those (/u/kertislagg) has indicated (in their last post) that undercity might be next. ^_^
---
I usually grab skinning when levelling for the most part, along with first aid. If I'm levelling a cloth wearer I'll take tailoring as well, but that's about it. I find that mining and herbalism force me to go out of my way for things when I'm usually just focused on levelling quickly and take up too much bag space to be work it. 
---
With skinning I know I'll be stopping by a vendor before too long and can sell it all, as well as the fact that I don't have to go out of my way to level it; the mob is right at my feet. An added bonus is free skillups from corpses left behind by other players.
---
Play horde, fear is crap when going against the horde.
---
Yeah quite a few Bean, Jellybeans &amp; Joanna
---
Spell batching existed back in the day, they should implement it as it was in vanilla, period.
---
I agree. It's pretty pathetic that some people are already thinking and worrying about post-naxx when the game isn't even out yet. I mean god damn it, try living in the moment for once in your lives.
---
Probably the same people staring at their phones at social events.

I once kept my PC on for \~20 hours to download a \~500 MB demo for Prince of Persia Warrior Within. Oh how times have changed.

So nasty, can't believe you have done that to your body. Do you know how harmful it is, and how in years after you will regret it? Your children will see it and probably commit dangerous and violent acts, because their father decided upon such a stupid idea... Had a friend not long ago who almost lost her arm due a similar idea, I hate when men (and women) get these things. It's not healthy for your skin and when you grow old it will look even worse...
---
Make the right decision: Choose alliance! ;)
---
I was hoping richturpin would show up. Just to see payo blow a gasket
---
Well, I like it - I've always thought that developing new content exclusively for the ultra-hardcore, endgame raiders was a major flaw in WoW's content plan.
---
Combined with the new zones, dungeons and questing content you've previously suggested, I think this would go down well. It's a content plan built on levelling alts and gearing up new characters, rather than constantly following the progression treadmill upwards and onwards.
---
Imagine you have a day off and out and about in the world, run into black lotus and fight for it with streamer, streamer dies you get reported by his viewers and there goes your day off waiting for ban review.
---
Does this count as shitposting? Also. I read this while shitting at work, so does this comment count as shit posting also?
---
If you're taking a crafting profession, skilling up while you level will definitely slow you down if you're planning to race to 60.
---
But there are also some benefits to doing it that way; there are a few items that can help you along the way depending on your choice.
---
Tailoring for example can really benefit casters, there's a few pieces on your way to 60 that'll be BiS (or close to) for a long time; Spidersilk Boots @20, Robe of Power @33, Dreamweave Vest &amp; Gloves @40, Dreamweave Cirlet @45. And there's a number of +Frost/Fire/Shadow green pieces too.
---
Blacksmithing has some levelling gear that shines too. Leatherworking less so.
---
Orcs were a peaceful, shamanic tribe before they were enslaved during the Scourge and forced to fight until they broke free, and everything bad happening to the orcs after that is basically just them growing up in a culture that hates them because they were used by the Scourge.
---
If people don't participate in all of the raids deserve less loot naturally.
---
You’ll still see 66% new people with layering since people are supposed to stick to their own layer.
---
I second this. Ulduar had everything and more.
---
The scourge did not enslave the orcs.
---
Would it though ? The latency bar looks green to me in this clip. No in that case in particular it would cause such a huge latency issue.
---
20 ms lol yea if u live down the street from the data center
---
This one has a life! What a noob
---
Yea keeping up with workouts will be tough. And no cardio...
---
Played the campaign twice, but not much more. I'm not too fond of rts. I'm not quite sure how they don't know its demon blood though, care to explain that? (the "kid" thing only achieves one thing, make you look like an idiot.)
---
48 and coming back for Classic.
---
Won't this happen regardless though? They plan to merge layers after phase 1. So regardless if you can choose or not, one day it will happen.
---
seems like you're a noob too.
---
Well it should play functionally like it did it vanilla. The current iteration is not vanilla-like.
---
i did this all the time in BC as a holy paladin. pop auto-crit, cast a heal, mash holy shock like an insane person. maybe like 70-80% of the time they would both get benefit from the auto-crit. if it's a bug it's been around forever.
---
Now imagine how disastrous the same situation would be with the Blizzards layering system.
---
What happens if with layering, few e-celebrities roll Madoran? Same shit, it's likely to stay overpopulated for a long time.
---
With OP's suggestion, just stick to the guns and merge that med/low Madoran 3 into 1 and 2.
---
Yup.
---
Wait what? That literally happens in nearly all nationalities and languages. Fact is, most people will switch to English or the other language that everybody can understand.
---
Sounds like you are actually great at getting ganked.
---
I'd skip them for leveling, they are fun, but don't add alot of value.
---
That’s the searing gorge my dude, it says right on the map. It existed in classic it just didn’t extend as far east (or west for that matter) as shown here.
---
Of course it is, but how many people do you think are going to be interested in tournaments where they know they have to prep full stacks of 27 different pots in order to really compete, compared to a few bombs..? Be realistic. Seems really obvious to me that this is exactly why they *don't* allow pots.
---
I don't believe arcane bombs were allowed were they? For that reason?
---
Fun fact. Nostalrius was working on implementing something like layering right before it shut down. Also crossrealm bg's. You can see that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL06DdydiC0).
---
Do you know this streamer by any chance or why are you so invested in this post. You don't like the fact that i posted this and thats fine. Just go on with your live. Go out, enjoy the sun..
---
"If a photograph is worth a thousand words, a YouTube video should be worth...?"
---
What does that even mean?
---
I think it is great idea with only very minor downsides.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think Blizz are ready to scrap layering after investing into it.
---
As a mage losing to enh shammy is unthinkable. Give them 20 yards meleerange if you want, it still doesn't happen. Ele hardcounters you and resto is unaffected anyways.
---
Sounds like you're super intelligent too, since you've managed to figure out the purpose for my post.
---
Ouch! Im so sorry.
---
Internally
---
Eye of the Flame gives 43 spell dmg only to fire spells. Considering the amount of fire resistance/immunity bosses in MC and BWL this item is no where near worth 1000g. It's pretty much a meme item.
---
Yeah, was worried about that.
---
Could be the inted way of the spell.
---
A similar effect is mage shatter, that's only 50% extra but proper way of using shatter, even up to wrath was casting a spell then following it up with an instant cast, even if either of the spells connects before the other and breaks nova both spells will get the extra 50% because at the time of casting the spell nova was on the target.
---
It's a bit different with elemental mastery since a spell should instantly remove it but if two spells are cast at the exact same time maybe the same thing applies. 
---
Could also be a batching bug.
---
You can't use grenades if you aren't an engineer.
---
Cdew just sawed this tourney in half
---
Esfand: THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE!
---
You mean embarrassing coincidence
---
The system that was used in one of the guilds I was in vanilla made it so the long time raiders could get like 20 items before other people could get 1 item (any new player or someone that couldn't get into every raid because of limited spots or unable to join every raid because of rl).
---
I think this is an "improvement" but not necessarily a fix. At this point, I'd take whatever is possible. 
---
While I do think this could be a step in the right direction, I'm still strongly in the "layering is bad" camp.
---
Just don't work and play WoW instead
---
Joana and some other speedrunner agree that cats are faster, but very marginable, so not gonna impact 99.999% of players. Owls are better for most since they are tankier.
---
And some of us like making sure toxic assholes get silenced. Guess Blizz is on our side, not yours. Sucks to be you.
---
Right? That popped out to me as well.
---
I’m the CEO of Blizzard and I didn’t get an invite
---
Seems about right, yeah. Just make sure you're actually using keybinds and not keyboard turning. =P
---
Your comment make it seem like we dont know what to expect at lvl 60 😂
---
It's not the same. CRZ requires sharding/phasing whereas a server merge just moves all the players from a certain number of servers into the same world permanently. 
---
I can't believe that someone would even suggest this for Classic WoW as CRZ is one of the main reasons that ruined the community aspect of WoW as the game "developed".
---
Good catch, though I think Blizz might say this is intended/Vanilla correct
---
Unique names are ridiculous tbh just let people use a second name that is the same for all characters kinda like swtor.
---
I dont think you'll need any addons until lvl 10 and later, it will take you an hour or two to get there and by that time  
---
there will be loads of addons ready for you.  
---
Macros etc is just copy/paste and you'll be fine.

---
No I’m pretty sure it’s B. We want to know what the probability was that these events happened to occur at a point in the spell batching cycle such that the remaining time B is less than the combined response time. Bt is the upper limit on batching (400ms) so if we are assuming average L and R, that sum would always be less than B and the probability your wrote would be 100%. Am I missing something?
---
For you. 
---
I could hook my computer to an expensive line and had excellent ping, sub 50ms. Granted, I'm at a hair under 20 now, but that doesn't cause what OP falsely claims modern networks would cause.
---
Happens more with Germans and French people, in the games/servers/parties/raids i’ve been part of.
---
The problem with PoM is the first spell puts gcd on everything. Elemental mastery applies twice because the hard cast spell and the instant cast spell go off at the same time.
---
Actually it does, or at least you should acknowledge that it's a very debated subject and have the humility to recognize it. You should read Noam Chomsky on this.
---
Layering is progressive. You'll see new people coming from other layer each time there's a merge, which will occur often.

Power creep is a symptom caused by the fundamental human need to obtain/see/do something new. We get bored. We want to "improve" our characters. We want to get something for our efforts. We are not happy with the status quo for long.
---
Removing power creep is simple. Just create new resistances for whatever new instance you toss out. Collect one or two of them on the way through the raid and you have a raid that adds no stats - except resistance that doesn't affect any PvP.
---
The problem is people want to improve their characters. Can there be side-ways progression without a large portion of the base feeling like it's worthless to do? Does a large enough portion of the player base enjoy raiding more than getting gear with higher stats?
---
After. EVERYONE is going to be AFK bot farming every mineral/herb node in the game for months after the launch. It doesn't make sense to struggle through that so I will instead power through leveling and deal with it later. At least I am progressing quickly to 60 rather than not progressing at all waiting for a node to respawn.
---
priest is better in pvp. well. it depends. full resto is not that useful in pvp imo, the ending talents are kinda bad, so most shamans run an ele/resto build and play a healer with the ability to blow people up with natures swiftness combos. 
---
priest is the staple healer for horde, and it really, really helps that they have power word shield. i cant even mention how many times pw:s has saved me or someone else before they got bursted. not to mention they have a hot, fear and dispel. a very complete toolkit.
---
&gt;Well you seem to speak pretty good English so I'd suggest an English server. The issue with France and I think Germany is they aren't taught English from a young age like the Dutch or Spanish making multi language integration harder
---
Germany is quite high in the  [English proficiency Index Europe](https://www.ef.nl/epi/regions/europe/) , so they speak pretty good English.
---
Spain in the otherhand is on the same level as Italy and France, so at almost at the bottom of Europe. According to the index, Russia is not that far away if you look the the points awarded for the English level.

Without being disrespectful.... this video was terrible.... Your argument is flawed.  
---
Your saying min/maxxing forces players to play in a way they don't too... which is just wrong.  
---
Min/Maxxing forces players who want to join a Min/Maxxing guild to play a certain way. If you don't want to play this way.... don't.  
---
If you want to raid in a particular spec... join a guild that allows it, don't expect min/maxxers to compromise how they play the game.  
---
Running a guild and running raids takes effort. Leaders often want this effort rewarded by bringing raiders that make the encounter easier...   
---
Im no min/maxxxer and play meme specs whilst i level cus its fun.... but when it comes to raiding ill be either making my own guild sp i can raid how i want or get in line and be building in a way that makes other take me.  
---

A good foundation for an extended endgame plan, but I find the content draft itself kind of boring. Why not use more things like "Depths of the Undermine"? Those already explored themes such as Karazhan, Sunwell Plateau etc. don't need to be re-explored imo. To put more mystery into the game, they should give us completely new themes.
---
Why do people - who have absolutely no basic understanding of what layering is and how it works - make suggestions on how to fix layering? I don't get it...
---
Are you going to your Car Manufacturers and tell them to just put wings on their cars as that would solve all those traffic jams? Stop being this kind of human, just stop it. If you don't understand something, don't comment on it. Just don't.
---
It's a jeopardy pun where they are saying the video could have just been a write-up.
---
I would rather they just not include any bombs or potions at all.
---
Rules are rules though. You can't just not enforce them because they didnt affect the outcome. Also did he not use tidal charm?
---
It's a downside when compared with the ideal situation of having a single server that never needs to be merged. But I struggle to see how you could argue it's not a major improvement over the layering system.
---
Yes, you will a sudden influx of new faces if the population drops. But compare that with totally breaking world integrity and having people phase in between server layers daily so that your world is continually filled with strangers and people you've played with are suddenly in another plane of existence.
---
Why would it convert a frostbolt to 1 damage? How are you supposed to kill it if not with spells? Wand hit or melee hit only?

Best wow tat ive ever seen
---
Yes exactly, that is what  [https://www.ef.nl/epi/regions/europe/](https://www.ef.nl/epi/regions/europe/)  tells us, Italy, Spain and France are the only of the major population countries at the bottom of the rankings. (Near Russia)
---
what a silly argument.
---
I'm assuming there won't be that many realms so I think we might not see faction imbalanced realms to the same degree we saw them on live in the past. Even when player numbers go down after the tourists leave, people would have to mass transfer to another server from one faction exclusively to create substantial imbalances.
---
Of course one realm might just end up having bad luck with a large amount of players quitting on one faction exclusively but I think that's unlikely.
---
Whatever the case, the only thing I can see happening is Blizzard offering free transfers to the underrepresented faction of a realm. I don't think they will ever merge servers because a server merge is always incredibly bad PR for an MMO no matter the reasoning behind it.
---
Doing professions are more a time sink than anything else. If you try to do it all: cooking, first aid, gathering, and crafting while you level, it will drain your gold.
---
If your goal is to level efficiently then then maybe take one gathering prof while you level to store/sell mat’s, bet expect to spend a few days to power level your crafting later.
---
If your intent is to have a profession augment your gear along the way then plan to either set aside a little time each day to craft, or (part of) one day a week.
---
One thing to consider is that many of the mobs will drop food and healing pots, and you can buy these at vendors as well. If you are willing to put off cooking and first aid until later to power level, it won’t gimp you, it will free up some gold.
---
Not if people are sticking to their own layers.. And since there is 0 official information as to how layering is going to work, you don’t know that merges will ‘occur often’. Otherwise link an official source.
---
I seriously doubt that the discord community is representative of a server in any way. People who use discord regularly are a specific sort.
---
This is my expectation as well. But results will vary guild to guild I guess.
---
I wouldn't but i know some players would (the ones that spend literally thousands to buy gears or even buy a corrupt gm to disconnect rivals that are ranking/trying to kill a world boss on certain private servers).
---
Playing through the bottleneck and staying awake longer than the other people.
---
I mean, do what you want. I'll be rolling a warrior landing melee hits from 10yd away on people trying to kite. If you can't beat em join em.

I laughed quite a bit. Even participated while taking a flypath. People shouldnt take themselves so seriously. If someone was overly abusive you could always ignore him
---
I work for a small independent rural ISP in Canada, where a good chunk of the customer base is still using a 6-10mbps ADSL connection or a 3mbps fixed wireless connection.  Most of the customers are about 200km, or about a 2hr's drive, from the province's main internet infrastructure hub in Toronto.  Most of the DSL customers have latencies to Toronto servers of about 15-20ms, with the wireless customers between 20 and 40ms.  There are some fibre customers with latencies of &lt;= 5ms, but due to just how rural most of the customer base is, the vast majority are going to be stuck on DSL for many years yet.
---
Rogue loses since they can't do their signiture 5-8 kiting, that was how in vanilla good rogues won against warriors, unfortunately with the added melee range it's no longer possible. You will have 0.34 yards to play with instead of the 3 people had in vanilla, which is way too small. Against tauren warrior 0 yards so that is completely impossible.
---
There is a simple fix, remove right click report and hire some gm instead.
---
&gt; Anyone that's already done Naxx is gonna be *really* bored  
---
Less that 5% of the player base being bored is IRRELEVANT in the grand scheme of things.
---
Guild drama is part of what makes classic so fun :)
---
Yea this makes more sense to me.
---
Though I think the most appropriate analysis would be to also use a distribution of reaction times and ping. Both of those are likely normal distributions (perhaps the reaction time is log normal). The aggregate results would be more representative than the comparative numbers provided by OP (someone with poor reaction time now vs then).

België staat wel een stuk lager in de ranking dan Nederland, maar jullie zijn zeker (in het noorden) op de goede weg met het Engels.
---
I know very well how skull works. Thank you.
---
That is not how you use skull. Why would anyone cc you if you burn yourself needlessly with skull for 8 seconds. The whole purpose of using skull in a pvp situation is to deny being cc'ed in a split of a second and punish the enemy for using their cc or big cooldowns (blind for example) and take advantage of that.
---
If you pop it 8 seconds early you are dead. To use it effectively it is to use in the shortest window possible, meaning you have to react at least in half of a second before the enemy sheep is coming off and for that spell batching is necessary.
---
no :)
---
shouldnt affect them negatively since you reset/kite when enemy is slowed anyways.
---
From my experience on a private vanilla server, we did roll/loot council. They decided if it was a high prio item for someone/a class, otherwise it was /roll. Being a guild with grown ups this didn't cause any issue and nobody got salty.
---
Lol
---
Reporting someone for being an asshole is a legitimate way of dealing with people. Let me guess, you're also against people calling the cops on criminals? Because of "muh freedom"?
---
Are you going to teach your kids to just ignore bullies in school? Or are you going to do what any good parent would do, and tell them to go to the teachers if someone doesn't stop abusing them?
---
I hope you never, ever have kids. You're not fit to raise them. If you were, you would notice that even with right-click reporting, people will be exposed to assholes like you. And teaching your kids to report those fuckers is the right course of action. Not just telling them to suck it up and ignore them. That's what deadbeats do. Not sticking up for their kids, and not teaching them the ways of dealing with people that abuse them. Ignoring is not a viable option, btw.
---
&gt;Blizzard this language layering is just unacceptable.
---
You will still meet a lot of people from different countries. Only not Germany, French, and maybe Italy and Spain.
---
There are literally some players on certains private server that buy gear for a few thousands dollar. There is even some story about some ranker giving (alot) of money to some gm to temporary ban/disconnect other rankers so that he would get rank 14 more easily.
---
Ele shaman is busted
---
Connected Realms are not the same as CRZ. It IS a server merge, with the only difference being everyone keeps their names and guilds.
---
Your post is a bit vague because you would have to adjust what you do depending on the class you fight against.
---
Generally speaking I would say the most important thing is awareness. In vanilla/classic PvP pretty often the person opening up (getting the jump) is going to win. Over time you will also learn which classes are more likely to attack you. 
---
My first instinct as a caster would be to start running away immediatley to keep a distance (vs melee) or trying to get into the deadzone (vs hunter). If you are new to PvP you will need practice. Try duelling other players and you will slowly learn how each class ticks.
---
Running and dotting is usually not the worst tactic as a lock. Have your pet engage the enemy so he can't get out of combat. Try to take him down slowely you probably won't burst anyone to death.
---
Be flexible. The quest you are doing is never the only quest to be done. When out manned or out gunned move on. 
---
Play by Tzun Tzu rules.
---
to the crazy power creep that would come with extra content. Says it right there in the title.
---
It blows my mind the kind of feedback some humans can't resist posting. This tat is fucking awesome! One of the most creative tats I've ever seen 😁
---
Swifty hasn't done shit in over 10 years.
---
It is. You have no valid argument against "racism". No solid argument exists for why it would be any more "bad" than your views on things are.
---
Truth is you're just a thin skinned little bitch that hates freedom of speech. You're a selfish little creature that wants to silence anyone that disagrees with you. It just makes you pathetic, you know? No sane person can feel respect towards your kind, because you don't behave in a respectable manner.
---
when will you people realize that classic is not a remaster? No “fixing” things.
---
Wow your comment is unbelievably cringey
---
Druids have alot of talents that overlap. A druid with 151515 wouldn't be too bad with furor, ooc, cheaper shapedhift and charge  etc
---
Get any gathering professions you plan to keep as you level but don't worry too much about crafting until you hit 60 imo.
---
I really liked a lot of his videos but the political stuff was a bit much for me. I also get the feeling that he is just pushing out way too much content in the last few weeks and that negatively affected the quality.
---
Probably has more to do with Tos violating sales than individual toxic behavior. Not to worry folks. You'll still be able to relitigate the 2016 election in Elwynn.
---
Purging Stratholme was the right decision dont @ me
---
You have to directly target the totem to kill it fast, it can absorb 5 redirected spells.
---
I hope tl;dr can’t really apply here.
---
My first thought is Druid, but I don’t really know all talent trees in all classes.
---
Body and mind.
---
I assume that’s the joke.
---
Awareness, is everything in my opinion. Its not about learning to react fast its about learning to act appropriately to the situation.  
---
What consumables do you have to counter the immediate disadvantage? and what is that?   
---
Is a rogue about to stun lock you to death requiring an mediate VW sac to absorb the burst?  
---
Is a warrior approaching? - Get him in combat asap to avoid the charge  
---
Are your surroundings helpful or lethal to you? Can fear help you run them into mobs, is running an option or will you just pull more mobs?  
---
How many gankers is there? More than 1? You may need to accept your fate, save your consumables and look to position yourself in a good spot to die. Or is the level advantage / gear enough to counter mobs + 2 enemies?  
---
Learning to react correctly to the situation is better than reacting immediately but in a way that makes the situation worse. Learning to remain calm and think the upcoming fight through is step 1. PvP is about learning that they are going to do to you and countering it in the best way possible.
---
Extra content?...
---
https://imgur.com/a/B1HPZ7i
---
Not nearly as nice as yours. Was made by an old friend (who is not a tattoo artist) while not entierly sober years ago. And this time around i will be going horde... 
---
Still, with well over a year /played as alliance, and the fact that a good friend made it, this ugly tatto has some meaning to me :) 
---
(sorry for bad pic, at work^^)
---
PvE servers sound just like the tryhard WoW experience everyone is detailing here. 
---
All that world buffs, consumables, loot council crap is not happening on a PvP server. 1 gank in your entire route of world buffs will knock the buffs off and people will be waiting to gank. After the first serious progression guilds are full, people will be stuck with having tanks that want full might with random dps offset pieces and a 2Her to PvP and a full third of the healers coming to raid in some bastardized PvP spec that's "good enough" for MC. You'll have people in raid that don't care to progress and treat raiding as a chore to gear up and will want to limit wiping time.
---
If you like the content at 60 and are in a hurry to level, PvE servers are for you. If you consider fighting people at level 30 in STV top shelf content and don't mind not leveling for an entire week, you'll love the PvP servers.
---
Instanced PvP is the exact same, world PvP is a lot less common but griefers will still ruin your leveling experience by killing quest givers. Lot less trash talk too since people don't give a rat's ass about PvP accomplishments. Back in 2004, people would just say go play Halo if someone was trying to brag about big dick PvP crap.
---
I think leveling is a lot more boring without PvP, but some tryhards want to hit 60 in the first months, many of them being on this sub. 
---
I never encountered world PvP on a PvE server because I never flagged myself. When I rolled on PvE, I just wanted to level someone and raid a bit, I already had my PvP fun.
---
All my fun memories were on PvP server. I geared a whole shit ton faster on PvE though. Barely anyone even walks into MC with good blues that give them competitive damage. One thing I did enjoy about PvE servers was that people could wear any lower class armor and build themselves a working set of year that was nigh competitive with MC gear, much of this being craftable. People cared about armor and stam on PvP servers.
---
I'd play PvE if this is your first time on vanilla. People are already planning to rush 60 and camp the crap out of lowbies on fast leveling classes.
---
He makes some good points. I didn't even know about the tunnel system despite the fact that my vanilla guild did down a handful of Naxx bosses. Naxx is definitely one of the big reasons why I'm coming back to classic since I wasn't in a guild that cleared it. However, Blizzard did cheapen the experience of Naxx when they re released it in WOTLK and made it a super easy 10 man raid. Its sad that most of my memory's of Naxx are from this time period. Because of this reason, I'm still of the opinion that Sunwell was the greatest raid in WoW's history. Its debatable, but in my opinion it was the most difficult raid in all of WoW.
---
Of course there will be players who wants to min/max because that's a playstyle they enjoy. I'm in no way trying to shit talk or hate on those who chooses that playstyle.
---
What I'm trying to imply is that the mentality CAN be hurtful to a big part of the vanilla community.  
---
I'm not saying that Min/maxers are "spoiling my game". I'm talking about a topic I find interesting and want to discuss with other people because I genuinly believe that it might be an issue.
---
Druid. There a better. ways to optimize it than 15/15/15 but the pvp build for druid kinda looks like that already.
---
Uh, if the majority of players don't go past BWL then you've just admitted that 4 or 5 of the 7 suggested raids in OP's 1.13-1.16 are totally useless to those people anyway, and are only catering to the people you said are irrelevant. 
---
I also think you'll be shocked at how many people on official classic servers finish Naxx. It'll be more than 5%. It's not even *remotely* comparable to 2005 where everybody was pretty poor at the game and had terrible PCs and connections. Even people who are returning to Classic from later expansions are gonna breeze through Naxx, it's all time investment, mechanically it's a total joke compared to what came later.
---
For me its ToT
---
I think people are ultimately overreacting to this. People will learn to stutterstep or the meta will shift in a different direction. Vanilla has never been a bastion of quality balance or competitive gameplay, and I don't think it ever will.
---
I am just curious to see what tricks evolve from skilled hunters &amp; casters to deal with it, and how melee classes will react to them. I think the meta allows for a higher skill ceiling with melee leeway than without.
---
&gt; People will farm dungeons at 60 for a few days. Then progress starts, which may or may not take long for a lot of those players. Then they raid log, just like most do on retail. 
---
Clearly you NEVER played Vanilla.
---
Everything you said is the opposite of what will happen.
---
Naxx geared people will STILL farm lvl 60 dungeons. Because alts, friends, gold.
---
The raid progress will take A TON of time for the VAST majority of the players.
---
You can't raid log in Vanilla. If you RAID in Vanilla, you play 3-4 hours/day, during non-raid days, to sustain yourself in raids.
---
&gt; And PvP without rewards stays interesting for most a month at best 
---
Another proof that you never played Vanilla.
---
IMO the best answer would be to add increasingly difficult content, but with gear on par with Naxx. People will still do it for the challenge and gear variety, but there would be no real power creep.
---
RemindMe!  65 days
---
It started off funny, but their antics got old rather quickly. I just wanted to watch the matches, not spend 10 minutes listening to them talk about shit and do the same things they'd been doing for the past hour. Rich was annoying too.
---
Also mount while in water and on boats.
---
Imagine making a thousand words bullet point criticism of an off the cuff fake tournament sponsored by players and expecting to be taken seriously.  Muh viewing experience much?
---
&gt; You're clearly not supposed to jump a wall and escape before starting AB, there's no parallel to world buffs.
---
It's the same thing....    You  are not supposed to have an entire raid stack all 7 world buffs and BREAK PVE content.   
---
I can't dumb this down for you anymore than this.
---
This is exactly what they did early on in vanilla, if queues got out of hand on a given server they would offer free transfers to low-pop servers. This happened on Blackrock, I remember my server (Daggerspine) getting a huge influx of Blackrock refugees on Horde.
---
Why would you remove daze that literally the one thing that makes the world interactive...
---
Ya I didn't say it should work with POM. I was just joking that it's too bad there wasnt a counter bug somebody could use to actually compete with shaman lol
---
Didn't that eyes mage complain that he had to go to work in the morning lol
---
Lol it's so easy to say find a job that doesn't make you miserable, not that easy in practice.
---
Solution to issues with gear discrepancies which would happen if Vanilla didn't end at Naxx I guess. Well, they actually already happened with Naxx. The idea of expansions isn't solely to add content. What happens at the beggining of each expansion is that green gear in the new continent can often replace the best raiding gear of the preious expansion in only a couple levels. Because expansions are also supposed to be reboots of gear level.
---
If you don't do that, a fresh level 60 will be complete trash in WPvP, discriminated against in raiding content, etc. Generally speaking, gear reboots are necessary or the differences between "old" characters and new ones get too big. The same is true with the economy btw, and that's why each expansion introduced massive gold sinks in the form of aesthtetic unnecessplayers get too big.
---
I hate that... Its not a true merge.
---
Its more of a combination, rather then a merge.
---
I think they want to recreate the vanilla experience down to that. Spinebreaker, there we go.
---
&gt; attacked by a similar level character
---
Then I'd probably just /wave and we'd both go on our way.  
---
But assuming we're talking about a PvP server where no one takes a fair fight, I think my exact key/click sequence would be: Escape &gt; Logout &gt; Change Realm &gt; [Whatever] PvE &gt; Create New Character.
---
I agree, but you know the ones who are forced to change their name will make an absolute outcry about it. Cross server name restrictions, whilst sounding like a bit of a melt, probably is the best option to avoid all hassle later on down the line

People get tattoos of things that are important to them on their bodies. If you don’t like tattoos that’s fine, but this is a well done tattoo and is by no means trashy.
---
I get that, a duel makes you (me as well) think offensive engagement.
---
Its like you would have to introduce some stat which helps players to survive in PvP for more than 2 seconds.. hmm..
---
As someone that quit midway through Soda's tournament because of trolls, this one was completely fine and watchable, in my opinion. Part of it was that there was instant satisfaction of trolls getting killed for interfering and part of it was that everyone generally behaved as there was IIRC only one case where they chained two or three interruptions one after the other. 
---
As for blocking Esfand's interviews, I think that was part of the fun, it was like crowd huddling around the winner and hugging him.
---
they have to get rid of layering first
---
It's not because of that.
---
It is because the (normal) human brain works in ways that prevent most people continue an activity that will be irrelevant in the near future.
---
Because this is what you get on private servers : IRRELEVANCY. Only the most hardcore Vanilla enthusiasts play to lvl 60 and raid on private servers.
---
Everyone else gets its dose of Vanilla for 20,30,40 levels, takes a 2-3 month break, rolls on another pserver, gets the next dose of vanilla for 30ish levels, and quits again.
---
And this was clearly the NORM after Classic was announced.
---
What is the sea to the east called? I can't read it :/
---
Sir this is the development police. We would like to know why your IDE is using a white theme.
---
I was comparing it to other classes, not to vanilla. If you can stand closer and still shoot as opposed to needing to stand further away in order to shoot. That may be a buff on a fight you can stand further back, but when you’re in a close quarters fight and need to abuse the minimum ranged attack difference a smaller race would be more suitable.
---
cheers, only makes it all the more important knowing which streamers goes where.
---
Here's how it's not a major improvement.
---
Existing problem: Server merges suck and people don't want them
---
Blizzard's proposed replacement: Layering. Layering has some problems.
---
Reddit proposed layering solution: Server merges. ?????
---
You're just posing the original problem as a solution and it's exactly why it won't happen. We have this thread weekly and it's the same thing every time. I'd take layering in phase 1, which if it goes to plan will barely be a problem, over my server community becoming 1/3 or 1/4 of a bigger community for the rest of the game's lifespan. The main problem with layering comes if not enough people leave, but we don't know if that's going to happen until it either does or doesn't.
---
We all want to play in World of Magecraft right?
---
Water for everyone! :)
---
Every time you log in or join a group you will be put on a different layer. So you won’t magically see new people after phase 1. It will be the same people you’ve seen since launch, just not all at once.
---
It was kind of considered BM back in the day.
---
This is the BWL Trailer. Link actual player footage or you are just feeding the misinfo.
---
The set WAS updated in patch 1.9 to have the new models and thats a fact. I have no idea why the BWL trailer use the new models. Obviously they were kinda done with most of them, but they were NOT put in game until AQ.
---
&gt; You people somehow think that the majority of Classic players will clear Naxx
---
Because they will. Its a cake walk now. You know how to prepare so you will do it early. You know you need 8 tanks so you start giving your warriors loot early. Naxx isnt hard and the encounters are known.
---
Upvoted you anyway, dirty Alliance scum!  :)
---
Saw a guy with an old WoW shirt at a train station today. The hype is real.
---
Ping and download speed are not at all the same. You might have more stable ping now, but it's an equation of client time to the server (and back).
---
Ahh yes, the virgin brand.
---
r/madlads
---
If you use any other spells you just lose dps it’s a waste of time and not optimal to use anything other than what I listed in a standard pull.
---
Did ven won? Who he played in the final?
---
If no drinking then they would simply wait and stall as much as possible to regen mana though spirit. Thusly prolonging the duel even more.
---
Exactly! There are a lot of brazillian trolls out there and that's why I'd rather play with NA and EU players... however, the latency is such a big issue.
---
For some reason, he thinks it's better for people to raid MC forever.
---
Oh ok. Thanks for clarifying.
---
naxx by itself needs a stat squish. aq aswell.  
---
the only real problem with stat inflation I see is PvP.  
---
introduce a stat cap to PvP and everyone can wear their shinies without being too OP.  
---
let everything scale down to the item level of the rank sets and weapons, done.
---
Yeah I agree. I also feel the same way about leeway. They both need to be adjusted to match modern internet connection, but they don't need to go away entirely. It's just unfortunate that Blizzard hardcoded the values back in 2004 which were unable to scale.
---
This will be my first time playing on a pvp server and I plan on ganking anyone and everyone, except for lowbies.  Killing lowbies is neither a challenge nor entertaining so I'll spare them.  Though watching them run just at the sight of me will be funny :D
---
I don't play retail. Imagine how frustrating it would be as a hunter if someone just walked through your trap, certain game mechanics should work as they were meant, not because of some buggy tech.
---
My God you need to relax, LOL. That overdramatic response is just hilarious.
---
So link them or shut up. Jeez. Like you want to know the most annoying this on this planet? People saying shit like "There's proof of X" for the sole purpose of winning an argument when they actually dont have a clue.
---
Post a video showing this. Preferrably with either an upload date on youtube predating the 1.9 release, or a with an upload date on Warcraftmovies.
---
The sets got updated in patch 1.9 and that has been prove in this thread over and over with so many links such as patch notes, archived forum posts etc. Meanwhile actually nobody managed to find conclusive evidence of the models being in game pre 1.9 yet.
---
Why is this bad?
---
&gt; Plenty of guilds on the pirated servers can't clear naxx.
---
Which is only duo to the fact that pserver tend to die out in later stages and most guilds cant fill their raids anymore. In fact every single guild that was still raiding in Naxx on the last vanilla server  cleared it.
---
yes but they only had one pvp realm and were a small developer team that didn't get paid.
---
maybe activision blizzard can do better?
---
They didn't want a repeat of Tipsout's tourney. That's what.
---
ima fully flask and world buff myself before a duel
---
Spell dmg focused ret does pretty well tho, not great but not horrible either.
---
Totally disagree,
---
Min/Maxxers represent a small percent of the community. There are over represented here because of the nature of the type of person interested in discussing a game that isnt out yet.
---
But lets clear up a few things
---
1. All thing player wise equal. A dwarf is a better raiding priest than a nelf and an obvious choice for purist min-maxxers. But this will never stop a nelf priest finding a raid spot. Ever. There is too much requirement for healers in general for this to be an issue.
---
2. The people who are turning you down, are people you want to raid with because they get stuff done. They get stuff done because the spec / roll a more optimal characters. They don't want to give you an exception as it breakdown their whole mentality. its simple supply an demand. You want them more than they want you 
---
3. Most non-min/maxxing guilds (and even most hardcore guilds) will take a dedicated player who applies his build / gear correctly but is no 100% min/maxed over an uncommited/unreliable min/maxxer any day of the week.
---
4. Boomkins, Ret Pala's, Prot Pala's, Shadow Priests, and other typically under performing specs can raid.... but you have to justify their presence. If your guild is wiping on content because you can meet the dps checks or your running out of mana then its an issue. Raiding isn't always about what you want to play but 40 people working together to achieve a goal. There should be no expectation for people to take you along unless you can show why your more valuable than something else.
---
Min Maxxing causes no greater problem than non-min/maxxers crying that the other kids don't want to play with them because they want to play the game differently.
---
I plan to main a dwarf prot paladin. Im about the biggest anti-min/maxxers you can find, min/maxxers hate me... but even im on their side of your argument.
---
You're traversing a fine line between being satirically funny or just ignorant dickishness. And I can't tell what it's supposed to be lmao
---
This. Most likely Blizzard were done with most of the new T2 models, but for whatever reason never got around to putting them ingame until 1.9.
---
All it proves is people have a really poor understanding of what constitutes evidence. Cant use a trailer of something that was never recorded on live servers as evidence of anything.
---
The only other civilisation in the south is the Zul Gurub troll nation, and they seem hostile

not great, not terrible
---
You can't wait for classic to turn into a collection game where all the meaningful progress is the amount of mounts and other collectible items you have ?
---
One thing I've always enjoyed in wow is the variety of different European accents.
---
You, by being so butthurt about things you don't understand and commenting on everyone who thinks about playing ranged.  
---
Don't bother answering, this is not a discussion.
---
It's almost like people are only interested in the easy loot, and then quit...
---
So that contradicts what the other guy said. Remove layers slowly =/= merges occuring often.
---
They did say that people are sticking to the same layer as their guild. That can’t happen if a random layer is assigned upon logging in.
---
We need some more in depth &amp; technical information on how they’re going to implement layering. You can see how many different theories there are right now.
---
Matrix salute
---
People don’t get famous on retail servers tho
---
I live right outside of Houston, the 4th largest city in the US, and my ping still spikes up to 300ms+ on a regular basis

I'm no expert on Classic, but from the research I've done Hunters are perfectly fine for all content until very late Raids.  Their DPS is fantastic until AQ40 and Naxx.  Still possible to get into a raiding guild, but you'll have to be spectacular for those raids.  Anything Blackrock raids or less and you'll be fine.
---
It IS a remaster tho. They even changed the graphics, and UI. Just like a remastered version. Then they changed a ton of other stuff that goes far and beyond just a remaster.
---
Why is power creep bad?
---
Its thoroughness is worthless if the variables that he used are pulled out of his ass.
---
He has what looks like a valid point, but he ruined it by trying to prove it at all costs using rigorous methods, when the data available just doesn't allow for it. It'd be more useful (and honest) to give a more rough approximation of the effect current hardware has on the old vanilla configurations Blizzard wants to use here. The fact that he did it formally but with the wrong data only dilutes his point.
---
To add on to the other comments, I've heard that addons were able to use the targeting functionality such that you didn't even have to use a target macro at all.  Just press a button and your character will automatically attack a totem with whatever skill you input for the addon.  It was basically like Decursive: practically automatic, and that's something Blizzard really hates.
---
menethil harbor and stormwind are the two busiest ports in the eastern kingdoms
---
You make great points. I hope you're right.
---
Priest can heal even with 15 points in shadow. And 15 points in disc is just enough to take 15% mana regen and free cast. So, 15-15-15 priest is almost viable for pve. 
---
And rogue in backstab build.
---
Sub servers were already proposed but there are two main problems: confusion for new players who want to play with friends and fluctuating numbers/unpredictable population distribution. This proposition solves the initial pop by distributing and not letting people switch but what happens if one server retains 100% of its players and another only retains 1%? Blizzard would have to manually manage servers and merge and they dont want to do that
---
No, everything but aoe spells are calculated from the edge of the model. The one (and pretty much only) advantage tauren hunters get from the larger model is that it’s harder for mages to sit in their deadzone and nova them.
---
omfg that's not real right?
---
&gt;The new models were released with BWL in patch 1.6. Existing pieces required a further content patch to change.
---
This would be true if the old and new sets were different item ID's. To my knowledge there were not, and any update to the set would have retroactively updated all the old pieces as well.
---
I think the Twitch 'culture' is way more rife on US realms. EU doesn't have any big streamers. This is a good thing.
---
There's a difference between knowledge of the fights and how well you can control and play your character. Poor at the game has nothing to do with which mechanics you've memorised. I could go memorise BFA fight tactics right now, doesn't inherently mean I'll be any good in the fights themselves when I have to use that knowledge perfectly on time.
---
You ever watch any of the really old world first videos? Some of the best players in the world playing at 10-15 fps keyboard turning and clicking. Imagine how they'll fair today, and now scale that comparison to the whole player base. I never said there wouldn't be plenty of people who can't finish Naxx on Classic, of course they won't, but you can bet your bottom dollar it'll be more than 5% of the player base who are actually still playing when Naxx is release.
---
makes it less fun to play if you're anyone except the top 1% of players in things like pvp, and makes what should be challenging end-game content too easy once you moved even a little way past it
---
&gt; They can control, on a day-to-day basis, the population distribution.
---
Well of course they *can*, but they absolutely shouldn't. It completely destroys the community in the game.
---
Got any proof or are you just going to link that dumb fucking trailer like everyone else?
---
&gt;2) servers merge together into one realm (Madoran) end of Phase 1
---
This is the best possible solution to the tourist problem, I think. I would probably go for more servers per pool, maybe like 10 instead of 3, which will merge into 2-4 servers eventually according to demand.
---
~#NOCHANGES~
---
#LESSCHANGES
---
Alot of inaccuracies for something that's supossed to represent the lore
---
You could argue the same with regular servers, but it isn't true. A lot of people will see that and specifically pick Madoran 2 or 3.
---
People who want “new classic “ content should ask themselves first ...
---
Do you trust the modern WoW team to not  fuck it up?
---
That's a problem you'll face, but at least it only happens once instead of every single time you log in like with layering.
---
The old and new T2 were both the same item ID so any change would affect any version of T2 currently existing on the server.
---
WHY was spell batching in the game in vanilla? What PURPOSE did it serve? Do we STILL NEED IT to SERVE THAT PURPOSE???
---
 The argument that simply because something used to be done a certain way it should be done that way again is past the borderline of retardation.
---
LFD preceded LFR, so I'd say that.
---
Also they've split raids into too many modes/sizes.
---
Ehh, fair enough. Like I said, I don't claim to be an expert on this stuff, my original point was about alchemy being way too involved for duelling for most people to care, so it's easier to just exclude it altogether. I never argued grenades *should* be in duels, I just think engi makes far more sense for practicality in organising these tournaments. I'd rather **all** profession stuff was out altogether, but that's just me.
---
It could be because my horde character was a warrior lol
---
I think he's saying that your video is rambling. It lacks focus. I think you would benefit from following the common writing processes. Eg, what are you trying to say with this video?
---
There's zero new information in the video. It's an opinion piece on a basic topic, with no proposed solution. It's not good when the viewer's reaction after watching your video is "meh" and they forget about it instantly.
---
Sorry if we come off as harsh, we probably don't mean it as such :)
---
I think from what I've heard of beta the nodes spawn significantly faster on beta than on Pservers. Still, during the worst of the zerg mining/herb will be rather horrible to level I expect. Skinning is always good. So my plan is to take that herb and gather what I can, but not stress about it. Skinning of course. Go back to leveling herb when I've gotten the mount and the worst of the zerg has passed.
---
The slight advantage you get from being able to melee from 8 yards means very little when you realize that melees get to hit you from that same 8 yards, and that’s much more beneficial to them than it is for you.
---
No, making the game work on a modern client is not the same as remastering it. Just watch any blizzcon panel and you’ll see that they’re not in the market for “fixing” stuff or balancing stuff just to make the game “better”
---
Cringe.
---
Not another layering "solution". /r/classicwowlayering is the sub for that.
---
Oh man now I really want a Fall of Draenor miniseries.
---
Because nobody has linked any.
---
If you have actual conclusive evidence in form of a video recorded on a live realm where the date of recording is documented to be pre 1.9 then please post it.
---
But making fun of me for actually having evidence when all people link is the stupid 1.6 trailer that was never recorded on a live server? What does that say about you? Facts are not as important as being right to people obviously lol.
---
They aren't even really merged, you'll likely get put in a new layer whenever you log in, so you're always going to be surrounded by strangers.
---
The beta was a streamer circle jerk that I only noticed because people on here wouldn't stfu about it.  It meant very little.
---
No humor allowed here.
---
They changed the whole story to your average movie plot to appeal to a wider audience ( non-warcraft fans ). Sure there were some nods to the wc community like murlocs, and it was thrilling to see the orcs etc in such high quality....
---
...but the STORY, my god i cringed away in my seat
---
Same here, I've been playing hunters my whole WoW career but always admired druids. But Blizzard isn't doing what I expected they would do with classic, they get one sub out of me but time will tell if i'm in for more
---
/u/awesometographer has a pretty good 'no kill' 1-10 leveling guide that I will be using.
---
Which is English.
---
I've got mouths to feed, pal!
---
&gt; Never saw "some of the best players" keyboard turning. That's just bullshit. Capturing video tanks your performance btw. 
---
Here you are, took me 30 seconds to find randomly. World first Thadd kill, keyboard turning mage.  [https://www.method.gg/video/TJsCv2lU3u8](https://www.method.gg/video/TJsCv2lU3u8) 
---
&gt; 99% of the knowledge you have is from Vanilla. Most of that other 1% is wrong. This isn't just knowledge of the fights, the mechanics of the game, but also characters as they changed through each patch. 
---
No, it's from whatever you played first. 
---
&gt; As long as we are using anecdotes, I just talked to someone that said he cleared naxx on a shaman. The guy was an idiot. He was telling people to take shit talents, and spam LHW. 
---
You implying he didn't clear Naxx or that even idiots can clear Naxx..? 'Cause to me you can interpret that either way. Pservers have cleared Naxx with boomkins in raids, "shit talents" doesn't mean much.
---
I genuinely don't even know what you're arguing at this point.
---
He won $2000
---
Exactly. And the video is not proof as has been demonstrated over and over. All someone would have to do is post a video showing new sets from a LIVE realm where the date of the video is documented to be pre 1.9.
---
Yet literally nobody has been able to do that. Meanwhile there's a ton of old forum threads and archived posts all talking about the new models in patch 1.9 which is being backed up by with screenshots and patch notes.
---
If anything, this thread is a testament to how monumentally stupid people are that they would rather deny any evidence presented to them over changing their own position even when that position isnt backed up by any actual evidence.
---
This solution would be fine if the sub servers had low population to begin with.
---
Below is an example;
---
1. 1000 people
---
2. 1000 people
---
3. 1000 people
---
4. 1000 people
---
5. 1000 people
---
6. 1000 people
---
After 1 week, merge servers 1-3-5 into server X
---
After 1 week, merge servers 2-4-6 into server Y
---
After 2 weeks, merge server X + Y
---
Doing it this way would require server ques though
---
I haven't played since Cataclysm, but has there ever been anything like the Wintergrasp pvp zone system that was in WotLK? I played as alliance on a low ally populated realm, and pretty much every time I joined Wintergrasp, I received 20 stacks (which is maximum) of this Tenacity buff:  [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=58549/tenacity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=58549/tenacity#comments)
---
It didn't help when horde was chain CC'ing you to death, but as a paladin, every 5 minutes when I could bubble, I felt like a raidboss and was almost oneshotting horde players and took a while to take me down. Fun times even for me even though I was massively outnumbered.
---
Ele hardcounters mage? Lol what? Iceblock and cs shuts down ele.
---
Enh or ele, either way mage is favored, but yes ele is more dangerous to face.
---
Ping to cs is way different, servers were in peoples houses around the world. I had 3ping to a toronto 1.6 server and 135 to useast datacenters in wow till cata.
---
I like this. Let the name priority go to whoever set their name first in the event of a merge.
---
The damage ticking? You know that Blizzard is also a damaging spell that ticks the same way, right?
---
There is still the hail mary of how well it did in places like China.
---
reporting someone for being an asshole because you have nothing to respond, and get triggered means he got under your skin. learn to ignore assholes.
---
Are you seriously comparing someone being mean to you to someone committing a crime !!?? no someone committing a crime warrant calling the cops for sure. Freedom stops when you trample on someone else's freedom. except someone being mean to you has nothing to do with your freedom.
---
I will teach my kids to protect others against bullies and stand up to them. i can see you have the right intentions but the wrong reaction here. Reporting bullies to teachers will make it worse, especially that most teachers have no idea how to deal with bullies.
---
you can say i am unfit to raid my kids as much as you want. your opinion means carries very little relevancy here, as you have failed to prove to me that you know how to deal with the issue at hand. yes bullies are scum, so are racists, sexists and homophobes but the way to deal with them is not to ban them from existence.
---
The issue in wow right click report is that it has been demonstrated time and time again, that it is abusable very easily. have your guild mass report 1 player within a minutes and they automatically get banned. In games like league of legends, there are options like mute as well as report. However, the main difference is that it is not an imperfect computer code that decides the outcome, but a real person that review the case. Blizzard want right click report because they have been laying off support staff for years to save costs.
---
But they can't go on saying, we want to add right click report because we don't want to hire support staff.
---
So they play on the bullies and trolls making people's lives miserable to have a portion of their customers supporting this deeply flawed feature.
---
and just to clear things up, i have never ever been reported for toxicity. I always stand up to bullies and hate seeing people being harassed no matter who they are.
---
Get in shape, clean your house, fix your diet so you have energy and time to play. Get everything set at work.
---
That’s a yikes from me bro
---
Depends, with layering it might not be unplayable, but if is I am going to do exploration. probably a little slower than grouping up for level 5 mobs but at least I get to unlock flight paths.
---
&gt;  Mages aren't favored vs Rogue.
---
???
---
Also rogue &gt;= hunter when both players are good.
---
I’m asking about what the classic team got wrong.  Unless you are referring to classic then you’re just wrong, as everything you are talking about has been proven to be 1:1 vanilla
---
They’re not updating talents, adding new abilities or items or any of that. All items, abilities etc that  are in classic were in vanilla. How does that make it a remaster?
---
Get ganked more and gank more, that's it. Nothing will make you better faster then practice.

Hey now, they could just mean their dad is 69 now.
---
I don't know if my 75 year old dad knows about Classic or not, if he knows about it he'll be playing it no doubt.
---
I'm not going to tell him cos mum will never forgive me!
---
They did in the past though (actual vanilla) and it set the precedent. Since it was done then, I don't want a new addition to remove that aspect.
---
I have to disagree, I think it really did occur with LFG/LFR in late WotLK/Cata. 
---
Thinking back on my times in BC/WotLK there was a huge community and I remember spending a ton of time even then hanging out with friends and just goofing around. The end game existed but it wasn't all raiding. There were guildies who were into doing quests, dailies, and who didn't touch PvM end game at all. PvP was different, especially with Wintergrasp in WotLK. 
---
It's easy to look back now and say that some of the things they added eventually lead to other things which brought the game down. But it's just as likely they could've taken the game in another direction and those things could've been great additions. Personally I love flying mounts for the freedom and feeling of exploration. I remember the first time I was able to fly in the game on my druid and my friend back in High School and I spent hours exploring every nook and cranny of Outland because it was so new and interesting. 
---
I remember hopping into a friend's Mammoth and riding around EK/Kalimdor during WotLK and working on the world explorer achievement for the tabard. I really think it was the deconstruction of the social atmosphere of the game with LFG and LFR that lead to the degradation of server communities.
---
Daze is an important part of the open world and especially pvp.
---
I'd also say that pre-invasion humans ,especially, and most races generally were pretty disparate. No all encompassing "human" alliance. I think its in the warcraft manual but a lot of the lore of the alliance was actually centered around the human kingdoms coming together. Not that dwarves/elves were after thoughts exactly, but Gilneas, Stormwind, Kul Tiras, Dalaran, Lorderon, Alterac, Stormgarde were clearly separate, wholly independent kingdoms and the bulwark of the alliance so it wasnt "humans" trading with dwarves, it would be Stormgarde trading with the bronzebeards or Stormwind trading with the wildhammer. So maybe Stormwind didnt trade with Ironfroge all that often.  It doesnt mean no contact considering gryphons. 
---
This would fit because there were no dwarves when Azeroth fell, the dwarves helped Lordearon of course and it would make sense they had closer ties to Lordearon simply because of your point - easier access to trade(orcs attacking the dwarves helped of course). The wetlands is between Khaz Modan and Stormgarde, maybe not easy travel but easier than the badlands and burning steppes. Menthil Harbor basically at the foot of Khaz Modan mountains.
---
40 meta isn’t the same as 60 meta though. Plenty of classes don’t have their full build/kit.

---
Ven finished 2nd btw, cdew won the tourney but no one is mentioning that for some reason.
---
Yeah which is a lot of money but not enough that anyone actually involved took it more serious than you seem to be
---
Depends on your reason for playing. For me, nostalgia is a huge part of the experience. I want to cobble together 15-year-old memories into fresh delights. I'd like to show my wife around my old stomping grounds. I want to be reminded why I used to spend 60+ hours a week in an imaginary world.
---
They had to test it earlier than the usual 1 month because of the way they were building the game. Also they have had time to find and attempt to fix problems. I didn’t get into the beta but any time spent improving the product before it launches is time well spent IMO.
---

I live a similar life. I’ve been increasingly tuning in and out of meetings with clients while I think about they sweet sweet sound of gouge, cheap shot, and kidney shot. Sometimes I wonder if people can tell if I play vanilla wow. 
---
Did that one guy in the elevator just give me a nod because he somehow suspects? Did that other guy from yesterday raise his eye brows and smile because he saw classic wow reddit on my phone while I was simoultansously pissing in the urinal? 
---
We are everywhere. Where you least suspect us.
---
I'm not planning on playing that late, but I've found that being on the west coast and planning to play from like 8-11 PST, there aren't a lot of groups looking to raid in that time frame. It's unfortunate.
---
I like a lot of the changes they made to attunements and raiding in WotLK, and I think the lore and game design was top notch. I think it went too far with LFG and adding too many raid modes that started to water it down. I think they would've hit their stride if they would've stuck to a strict size limit for each raid and then added hard modes on top of that. 
---
Basically if they made ever BC raid similar to Ulduar with mechanic activated hardmodes and not every boss having a hardmode would've kept the game fresh and interesting while allowing guilds who were stronger to progress through more difficult content without it being an endless grind.
---
I agree that introducing server pools is the best way to deal with the tourist problem. Instead of merging them all, I would suggest merging on demand. So if M2 and M3 struggle, but M1 is fine on its own come P2, just merge M2 and M3 and leave M1 alone for the time being.
---
At this point, I wouldn't even bother with naming the servers M1, M2 etc, and give them regular names instead, maybe with a realm pool suffix (Madoran - Blackrock, Maelstrom - Blackrock, ...). This makes it less weird if only some, but not all of the servers get merged together.

Strange then given how many bigots seem to gravitate towards bigotry, isn’t it?
---
It doesn't matter whether you agree or not. It's **Blizzard** that identified it as a problem, not me, I'm simply relaying why layering is even here in the first place.
---
&gt; Comparatively, layering is just server merges on steriods.  
---
Not even remotely. With layering I have the chance to interact with every single person (in my faction)  on my server, from launch day until the day they or I quit. Even if it's a small chance that I bump into them in the world, they may be invited to a party I'm in, they may join my guild, I may see them in chat, I may buy their stuff from the AH. 
---
With server merges, after months of my server community growing and evolving, one day our community is just a small part of a giant community who are mostly total strangers that I've never even had a *chance* to interact with before. It's a preposterous argument to say that layering is somehow that but even worse.
---
I’m pretty sure blizzard is set on layering. It’s not the worst proposal we’ve seen here though.
---
Then he should accept that he isnt gonna Get a spot in any mediocre+ guild and stop whining about handicapping himself

Caloric restriction very rarely works anyway! It leads to muscle loss, a slower metabolism, and almost everyone will binge after a while, gaining it all back. 
---
Eating nothing at all is different (fasting). After a couple days, the body will start using fat, and you'll lose almost no muscle (sub 3%) while losing fat weight. You'll enter ketosis and feel amazing.
---
I think there might be a difference in how northern Europe and America remembers this. In northern Europe it was probably the norm to have &lt;80 ping when playing Vanilla.
---
I cringed so hard, damn.
---
P sure Cauthon is maining Hunter on launch, it's what he mained in Vanilla
---
That's how it was supposed to be all along before bfa i think.
---
Was supposed to be much smaller.
---
There will be plenty of more people you don't see that are hidden on other layers. The problem you describe will be present regardless.
---
How is this different from just having multiple servers that eventually merge together? I guess in this case we know which servers (Madoran #1, #2, and #3) will eventually merge?
---
I mean... it just seems like another way of saying "Don't do layering, just merge low-pop servers."
---
And what I am saying is it WILL be the same as 2004, but NOT the same as if they just increased the server cap as on pservers, OR if they just let people sit in queue. It makes a huge difference.
---
You’re arguing with Reddit users. They’re never going to understand.

I got aggro on onyxia as a mage when she went from phase 2 to 3 and pulled her back to tank spot and god knows how, but i survived her auto attack and tank got threat again
---
1. Idk

2. I don't really think so if you are asking if you can raid and then log out until the next raid. It's pretty necessary to get potions and other consumables. 
---
3. Playing with friends and nostalgia

The reason I linked a source showing that it only made 90% of its budget back is because I wanted to avoid this tired comment.

I would rather my community get adjusted slightly then having the whole server run like shit or crash.

*At one moment in time!* But since 2004 you have a lot of millions of people who played at one time or another. And the frame of reference is not the whole planet, but the bunch of countries where it was released.

If you are the kind of player that lost hype already, you were a tourist to begin with.
---
No because you are actually killing mobs? Instead of waiting for one for 30 minutes
---
Content isn't necessarily harder, it's just the orchestration of 40 people.
---
Vanilla is probably easier than TBC raids, starts getting actually difficult in AQ40/Naxx with a competent group.
---
Depending on how much you want to respec, if you want an epic mount, and if your guild requires consumables, you'll most likely have to farm as well.
---
Vanilla has this persistence to it where you can go at your own pace and always return to the same spot you were at without any of your work being undone.
---
1.  90% of raiding was significantly easier in Vanilla with a few exceptions in AQ40 and Naxx end bosses.
---
2.  Probably need a decent source of income for consumables but, and grind to be raid ready.  So not at 60 but after you have a raid ready 60.

How is a video of one of the only vanilla raiders to do Naxx keyboard turning not evidence that some of the best vanilla players didn't keyboard turn? I'm not wasting more time combing through videos because you don't like that one, you get the idea, it happened.
---
&gt; What does that even mean? 
---
99% of your knowledge of the game can't come from vanilla if you didn't play vanilla. 99% of your knowledge of the game (as you claim) comes instead from whatever xpac you played first. I don't really even quite get what you meant here anyway.
---
&gt; I am saying that despite all the information handed to you without you having to work for it, he is still an idiot. 
---
So, an idiot can clear Naxx. That's my whole point, the clear rate is going to be *huge* compared to back then, not just 5%.
---
You're right, the Burning Legion did, the masters behind the Scourge, well initially.
---
Just make names unique globally.
---
Bro there are people out there, and not an insignificant amount, for whom normal difficulty is "progression raiding." Relax.
---
Yes. That would have been the joke.
---
I mean if I hop on retail wow I get 20ms ping. I'm est and the server is Chicago. So you don't have to be right next to it but pretty close region wise and you'll get good ping. I hope they get rid of or reduce spell batching.
---
Can we start being a  better community and reporting these types of posts? There is no reason to have thread after thread of people complaining about others having discussions. At least the OP is trying to have a discussion...these posts are just worthless.

I think the renewed interest in World of Warcraft seriously helped their 1H2Q results.

No, it didn't. The slow effect on the Blizzard was a separate effect that applied by itself.

I Played Hunter and Shaman in vanilla and switched to Paladin with tbc. I also leveled druid, dk, priest and warlock to max level till i quit at the end of cata. But my main was always my Paladin because i loved the diversity of being able to tank and do dps (Never really was into healing).

Out: Shaman, Paladin (because of Horde and i think Pally is trash in vanilla because it only can heal and i never enjoyed that), druid
---
Probably not: mage, priest
---
Undecided between: Warrior, rogue, hunter, warlock 
---
First i thougt okay i think warrior will fit best because of the diversity. But i‘m going to play really casually this time around and warrior will be very gear dependent (and gear equals Time) also it will be trash in wpvp without heals and i wont have them as i play with a friend who is going mage. 
---
As for the hunter i really like the ability to solo Farm and be less gear dependend. But on the other hand i am not sure about leeway, traps and the bad pve damage. Also only dps role.
---
Warlock wise i am a huge fan of the classfantasy and the pet thing. Not sure about gear dependance and only one role.
---
Rouge (my favourite atm) is really strong in wpvp and but not so in bgs as you rely on your cooldowns. Also highly populated and not so much needed in Dungeons.
---
My Main goals come Classic are wpvp, bgs, and doing Stufe in the world as well as 5 man Dungeons. Perhaps some causal raiding but not sure about that. Will only be able to play arround about 10 hours per week (After nolifeing the release week) but still want to be competitve as far as possible in bgs and wpvp without the best gear. Leveling Speed and difficulty is not an issue for me as i enjoy leveling and am quite expirienced with that. 
---
What class should i play? Also sry for all the mistakes as i am not a native speaker
---
Or the reddit hole.
---
Yeah they are changing the macro API, there are other minor changes.  But #nochanges!
---
Is this a troll?
---
That's the problem with vanilla+, when some classes are decked out in t3 they break the game.  Holy pallies can functionally never oom for example.
---
Wasnt The Swamp of Sorrows named that after the invasion of Azeroth by the Horde?
---
Same...
---
I liked the movie. It would have been pretty good if the human story was less generic/corny and the guy who played Medivh was charismatic.
---
Priest with [21/15/15](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGshbZrEzZVMgz), a workable PVP spec not too dissimilar to tri-spec.
---
I had pretty much the same ping in vanilla, so keeping leeway like this is "no changes" for me and the rest without bad ping, i had 50 ping during vanilla in Sweden.
---
“Melee leeway” is working as intended. After careful study and testing, **we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.**
---
So ur opponent doesnt know u wield sulfuras..?
---
This is going to come off as ignorant but whenever someone, on a forum, begins lecturing about the cost of running Blizzard I immediately stop believing that that person knows anything about that at all. Unless you have a high ranking position at Blizzard, stop talking as if you do.
---
Your real point is this: 
---
&gt; Server resets will push the more casual players away. 
---
People are coming back for fresh launches because fresh launches are awesome. A fresh launch are a very entertaining part of the game.
---
People are complaining about economy ruining laying but then support this idea. Realistically with layering every night during non-peak hours servers will only have 1 layer running. With this idea you have 3 or 4 servers running all the time with 4 times as many resources up at once. When the merge hits you will less people on the server by design with 4 times as many items to sell. Everything  will drop in price because there will not be enough consumers.
---
Wow...that is bad, seems like most of us Hunter mains float to Warlocks a lot of the time as a second option.
---
What
---
Dumb comments get dumb responses.
---
In my experience you are likely to get ganked fairly often levels 20+. Corpse camping is less common, but every once in a while you run into a rogue ten levels higher than you who had a really bad day. If graveyard runs a few times a day (maybe hour, just depends) sounds awful to you then roll PvE. Just understand that endgame world PvP can and will be a lot of fun. I’d say it’s definitely worth the risk and extra time it takes while leveling.
---
You can't even read. Damn.
---
Yes it is.
---
I mean i think they wanted to give time for people to get the names they want before people try to start selling them
---
I love stupid jokes like this! Have my upvote
---
&gt;Best way to not get ganked is to gank others first. You may feel bad killing that warrior at 50% fighting two mobs, but he's just going to jump you when his paladin buddy shows up and you're killing a named mob.
---
This had me laughing out loud in the gym.  So, that's totally me.  I see horde my level or below and think "he's just trying to quest".  Today, I saw a horde toon and I casted a DoT on HIS target.  We went our separate ways.  What happened next?  A Rogue came out of stealth, killed me, then ran off.  Next?  That toon I just helped came over and attacked/killed me.  No good deed as they say.
---
So yesterday I had to go to Booty Bay to take the boat to Ratchet.  I was waiting at the docks and literally surrounded by Horde players, but we were all just waiting for the boat.  I mean, there were at least 10 of them.  Then?  Well, we all just got on the boat.  Guess I'm just too hopeful.
---
WHY? THIS IS LIKE ASKING FOR MOLTEN CORE LOOT TO BE ON NAXX LEVEL. IT'S JUST STUPID.
---
First of all I didn't even know they updated their shitty in game chat to allow copying text cause I've been using Prat all my life.
---
And second ... that's even less efficient than typing! And it still has to go through at least 2 people.
---
Creating asap a lvl 5 bank is a good idea. I'll do the same! Which class / race will be easier for you?
---
Spell Batching.
---
Nice, I wish I had any potato videos from back there, but my computer wasn't good enough to record.
---
If you booked off the first two days of release you might not have a very good time :(
---
It's fine, but you're right about most of the damage coming from mb/swp/wand... in which case your deep investment into disc doesn't really bear fruit.  You dont need anything you pick up there.
---
I remember begging my mum to preorder wow to get into closed beta i remember the beta went on until like 2 weeks before launch or something but i was a noob and only got to like level 30 or something
---
It's impossible not to upvote this:D
---
Yep, and that was the problem. They shouldn't have assumed from the start they they would get multiple movies without starting from the good part.
---
It's typical movie exec greed where everything's going to be a franchise/connected universe.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Lvl 1 rogues also beat afk mages
---
Just curious, why level 5?
---
&gt;Your post is a bit vague because you would have to adjust what you do depending on the class you fight against.
---
My inexperience is the problem for sure.  I laugh because everywhere I read, I'm hearing that Warlocks are almost unkillable in 1v1 situations, and yet, I was killed by a Shaman 1 level below me.    So....  problem check: definitely me lol.
---
I'm not for or against anything, but i just want to add: your char gets 'deleted' anyway with a new expansion.
---
The best player in full naxx gear is back on the same level (gear wise) as everyone else. 
---
What i'm saying is: fresh server or TBC progress, your char and your hard work gets 'deleted' anyway...
---
You're going to regret that when you're older 😂
---
No. You're being deliberately obtuse. I never suggested things should be added at all, just that things should not be added or removed solely based on whether or not they used to be there. Their functional purpose is the only thing that matters and 400 ms spell batching no longer has the same functional purpose
---
Eh not really. Warcraft 3 was such a standout from the previous games it really didn't rely on the previous lore to be great. You'd just need to establish a rough idea as to what the horde was, what the legion was, and you're off to the races. Very minimal back story required.
---
Hell, they explained all of this to decent detail within the game itself because they knew people may not know about the first two games.
---
Usually there will be a realmname&gt;char name tree in the wtf folder, jus rename them the proper realm name and your char name
---
I like the idea but they should make this worldwide. One name database for every server in every region. You either got that name in the world alone, or you don't.
---
No extra content. Stop it.
---
I know, I did say it's not the same, all I said that it is similar in a way that, the nova might not be on the target when a spell hits the target but still count for shatter. I think since spells are batched, both spells go off exactly at the same moment, the end of the batch so both gain Elemental Mastery.
---
horrible music
---
i thought everyone is complaining how easy classic is and pservers are so much more tuned up and demanding.
---
this sub needs to make up there collective mind.
---
It looks pretty good.
---
That's nonsense.
---
No.
---
Until that team gets reassigned to the Warcraft pet battles cars game for iOS and Android
---
Something pretty close to this is the best beginner friendly druid pvp build.
---
The leeway is the same for any hitbox size, a fixed +2.66 yards increase hardcoded in the client. Proportionally the leeway benefits every race more than Tauren because it doesn't scale on the base melee reach. 
---
The base melee reach for any race is 5 yards. It's 6.95 yards for a male tauren and 6.6 yards for a female tauren. The jump from 5 yards to 7.66 yards is a **53.3% increase of melee range**, while the jump from 6.95 yards to 9.62 yards is a **38.4% increase**.
---
TL;DR: Melee leeway buffs orcs and gnomes more than it buffs tauren.
---
pve player
---
If you decide to roll on a streamer realm I think that'll be the only time you encounter TRUE faction imbalance in classic.
---
It's a nice idea but it's too much.
---
Too much in the opposite direction of original TBC. TBC had too great jump in stats (as it made all previous content irrelevant so fast), this has too much overlap (as majority of a new patch content is "catch up" and not an upgrade for top level guilds.
---
Honestly they could just go similar way as originally, but not to so much extreme. Or like this, but not so much extreme.
---
Just introduce 1 catch-up/side-grade raid each, or each second patch and the rest just scale normally vertically, but in sensible scale. Just make each Tier slightly better than the previous.
---
Introducing alternative paths to get to current-1 raid Tier, maybe with the side-grades for offspecs or introducing more resistances. But don't overdo it so much that top tier guilds have almost nothing to do each patch, compared to other players.
---
Seriously, you guys need to stop believing PvP server = Corpse camping/Ganking server.
---
This very rarely happened. And if it did, it could be explained 95% of the time by the fact that you actually farmed your attacker (or its alt) at some point back in time. So in a way you deserved it.
---
I would say that PvP server is more about the two factions questing in contested area. If you compete for the quests, then you benefit from killing the opposition. But if you do, they will want revenge. And that's how the circle of war starts. But that's also what makes PvP servers awesome !
---
Yeah, And Tol'Barad was in that bay too.
---
All those melee range functions cap out at 7.66 yards. Why are we seeing melee attacks greater than this?
---
If you're the kind of player that wanted actual Vanilla and not layering, broken batching, broken leeway, 1.12 AV, mount bullshit, 16 debuff slots, right click report and loot trading - you were a tourist to begin with.
---
Thank you Father Blizzard. This is the best version of WoW with all these changes. I can't wait to jump up and down screaming I'M PLAYING WORLD OF WARCRAFT on August 27th.
---
/s
---
Fuck outta here with this high horse bullshit. If folks get deflated due to whatever reasons they want they have every right. The Vanilla community has been wanting an official version of Vanilla for over a decade. Now we get some bullshit that's anything but.
---
Take your cringe elsewhere.
---
What if there’s other people with the same idea? You can’t assume you’ll be the only one who thought of this genius idea. What if there’s two or three groups of five running around killing the same mobs as you? 
---
It just seems like it’ll be a shit show all around, and there’s nothing you can really do about that
---
you can have 2 professions, so there would still be plenty of people with enchanting and alchemy

Completing classic ha
---
They could either do it again 
---
Or just stop playing 
---
No game is supposed to be played forever
---
38 here :)
---
take a nap, alex
---
Wow, I did not know that. What about polymorph etc. It can can ground them forever unless the totem dies? Or the effect pulses like other totems?
---
^&gt;went
---
There are still rural areas with only dial up, satellite, or very limited 4g connections.
---
yeah, im planning on playing an ele shaman in classic so if you could just delete this post that'd be great
---
There are videos of rogues doing the 5-8 kite from original vanilla and staying below 7.66 range and still not getting melee hit. There has to be something different. 
---
Same with spell batching, the idea is the same, but the implementation is obviously different than it was.
---
&gt; This is the shittiest meta shift I have ever seen.
---
It's working just like it did in Vanilla, why would there be a big meta shift?
---
She failed to adapt her business with the times. I feel no pity for her.
---
If you are lucky enough to get into the 25th stress test, that's when you create your character, set up keybinds/addons etc. Only thing you gotta change on release is the realm name for the folder and perhaps character name.
---
There has never been a server merge on retail, even though it's sorely needed. There's been connected realms, but player names and guilds are not unique on those realms. In other words, it would say like Butthead (Dragonblight) and Butthead (Fenris), and the guilds are handled similarly. 
---
I do not believe they will ever merge realms with WoW Classic either.
---
TBC son! Most fun raiding I've ever had
---
&gt;crevasse
---
You are correct, it looks like, but a crevasse is specifically in a glacier. This is a crevice.
---
Funny how nearly everyone that has conservative views turns out to be a bigot, but yeah, keep trying to defend non bigot conservatism. And certainly make sure to keep posting videos that try to normalize it.
---
I think shutting it down is a mistake, and I think the limited invites was a mistake. If there's any fear of killing the hype or people burning out then the project has already failed. The optimal trajectory for the game is if it comes out and it's good and fully functional, so that people will keep on playing it beyond initial hype. And the best way to ensure that is more testing.
---
Not on private servers with no leeway
---
ya thats me hahaha.
---
the best part about classic wow for me is being a low level noob and meeting some very friendly player in goldshire, who gave me 2 gold and then another kind soul who gave me a green BoE level 7 dagger "stonesplitter tusk".  I felt so taken care of.
---
Ok I should rephrase that.. for players that are looking forward to some type of content after vanilla content.. what else do we have other than to trust them?
---
For dungeons Warrior&gt;rest
---
For raids Warrior&gt;rest
---
Pala being better in dungeons is a lie because they have tons of downtime
---
The main reason of layering that it is dynamic. This solution isn't.
---
Nobody can predict with high accuracy how many people there will be in the beginning, and how many will stay. Not even Blizzard.
---
There is no "added melee range". It's exactly the same as it was.
---
That is terrible and kind of a gamebreaker for me, i wish they fix the DR =/
---
If it bleeds, we can kill it
---
Personally, I feel like leveling any profession other than cooking and first aid will slow you down.  You are better off grinding easy mobs for a level if you get into a spot where you are dying too much.  If you plan to take your time to 60, then you can of course level professions and use all the pots you want.  Or craft all the mail and plate armor you want, etc.  So, yeah, it's fine.
---
Spot the attitude that ruined wow for ME (not everyone)
---
I mean I won’t argue that point. I have the same belief.
---
15. Why I never used this
---
What vanilla vid exactly? Every video ive seen the trap after scatter lasts way longer than 5seconds.
---
This math gave me a boner.
---
&gt; Except for retail AV.
---
1.12 AV*
---
&gt; Except for broken batching.
---
What's broken about it?
---
&gt; Except for broken leeway.
---
It’s literally the exact same as having a bunch of servers but with a much worse naming convention that Blizzard would never use.
---
@chromedDragon whats your discord. i wanna chat about post-classic stuff. ive been talking with **Titi**\#7251
---
But we haven't seen the Classic team *design* anything, just get the old stuff to work in a manner than people like.
---
I have no problem with "everything needs to be a franchise/connected", but then they need to follow through and accept that the first entry will not be super popular. I mean, how many great shows have a "meh" first episode..?
---
His videos were funny as fuck
---
Was about to point that out. It's like the sundering has already happened.
---
Yeah I heard him say that. I also heard him later talking about the many guilds he's going to need (which would mean he told everyone). I understand big streamers being concerned about sniping, but he has a private army walking around with him at all times. I'm not sure he needs to really worry about it.
---
I still think they could have had a parellel Thrall and Varian movie, from essentially refugee youths, to gladiators, etc.
---
Max level is 60, pve and ovp gear might be interchangeable depending class and spec, farmable at dungeons, questing, raids and battlegrounds.
---
Hard to say which addons to recommend since some of them might alter the way the game was originally designed to be played, also not all addons have finished development.
---
You're right. I do think it should be lowered, but "The argument that simply because something used to be done a certain way it should be done that way again is past the borderline of retardation." can be taken to dangerous waters very easily.
---
Blizzard forced her out of the market buy giving away goods for free. How can she compete ? What will be the cost to us once blizzard takes away our free lunch?
---
My investigation shows that objects in Classic Beta appear to be ~20.5% *smaller* than 1.12.1 in a `(wide)` resolution, when the player is in the same position and with the same camera angle/zoom level.
---
A lot of hate in the comments here, but I love it. If you love something then why not? Looks great! Whoever the artist is did a great job!
---
Nah I think this was the way it was set back in WC2. But obviously Kul Tiras is very different now vs. what it was like then.

---
Why are you leveling as arms?
---
Wait what did he really?
---
Give them the stealth not the opener
---
Dont dot a rogue before he gets to stealth but freezing trap aoe spam etc is completly fine.
---
I suspect you play a rogue and are not very good at duels
---
She had to "relocate" her "business" to Goldshire, she now thrives there as an influencer, entrepreneur and self-proclaimed gamer girl.
---
After vanilla , so TBC?
---
https://i.redd.it/cr59hablt6v11.png
---
There's much less of a connection and effort to D2 character names. Also, it was a free service compared to paying $15 a month for WoW.
---
I named my d2 characters troll names like BearFocher, testicles spelled backwards, etc.
---
Even if it is, if they are trying to recreat the "experience" of vanilla, some technical things have to change to compensate for the change in latency. This and batching might have been fine when the average good latency was 150 and even 300+ was very common, but playing the game at 20 ms latency, it's not accaptable to have these in the game as they are now.
---
Imagine if they capped your FPS in raids at 10, because people had \~10 FPS in raids sometimes even worse and people were forced to look at the ground to increase their FPS. 
---
I had a farily strong PC for the time and I was barely getting more than 30 FPS in raids.
---
But way way less than the OPs idea, which is what we want.
---
1. I think it was slightly harder but that might have been because I knew less about the game.
---
2. If you stockpile the consumable your guild requires or you use then sure.
---
3. I enjoyed the thrill of being in such a big world with a social environment that mattered.
---
Taurens, movement desync, EU players on NA servers, animation delay.
---
I thought the bloody/fleshy style was neat. Maybe OP mains undead and was wanting it to be more on the exposed flesh side of things. Red is the hordes color and they have a couple of sayings that involve blood, so maybe that’s where the inspiration was from. Can you elaborate on why you find it trashy? It just looks like any other well done tattoo to me.
---
gnome rogue, orb of deception -&gt; turn into a tauren, now enjoy the extra melee range as a rogue. OP as fkkkkk
---
It's doable, sure, you just bind actions to inputs. But you'd probably be better off just getting a wireless KBM.
---
Nobody wins. Everyone loses, because no one will play.
---
Interface addons are pure preference tbh
---
People will favor server 1 of any server just because it feels like the real server. It's 1 for a reason.
---
Modern WoW's content isn't the main problem of modern WoW. It's the modern WoW systems and gameplay that fucked it all up.
---
The mugs who thought to do a warcraft movie should have done arthas's story as a trilogy.
---
I still vote start from the start but make it a TV series.
---
I get where you're coming from but.. I feel it might just piss away a great build up.
---
I really hope that huge 4chan leak is correct. A fired employee (take with grain of salt) said they are doing the classic trilogy. Vanilla, TBC and Wrath.
---
Yeah, no. I'd hate if something where I put in all my hundreds of days /played on my original character from vanilla and TBC to log in and see I've lost my name.
---
&gt; These systems meaning merges?
---
No, sharding tech. The modern game is designed around it and it has been a hot topic for a long time. You seem kind of lost as to what this entire discussion is about. Why do you think there has been so much uproar about layering in the first place?
---
I think it's worth mentioning that Naxx was out for only 4 months before TBC was announced. I know a lot of people that stopped progressing because they knew TBC was essentially a gear reset.
---
in a pve game. wow pvp is a joke.
---
If you get ganked by a high level it’s always worthwhile to ask if there’s some high level friendlies around to fight them off. That’s how some serious PVP brawls started when a lowbie gets ganked, calls in their guildie for backup, the ganker calls in his friends/guild, it escalates further, then it’s the Battle for Azeroth in Lakeshire.

---
It's not. Due to spellbatching the 100% buff applies to both spell casts. It's not a bug and intended behavior.
---
Bank alts are very useful, sure. But you're not always next to a mailbox and the 1 hour delivery times can put a dampner in moving things around.
---
Please don’t ever post something called “item level” on a picture related to Classic ever again.
---
Lol see you in August when you inevitably play the thing you can't stand and give the people you hate $15 a month to do so
---
I used a PS4 controller for SWTOR (a similar MMO) and it worked way better than you'd expect. The main problem is that the UI is designed for mouse interaction.
---
You might think you don't have enough keys, but it's actually the opposite. I bound R1, R2 and L2 to Shift Alt and Ctrl, and bound my spells to Triangle, Square, and Circle, plus all combinations (That's already 3^3 = 27 unique keys). You also have the left D pad and the touch pad.
---
Combat was really fun, I'd actually rate it much better and more practical than using a keyboard, but an MMO mouse it still better.
---
that's like saying "lets add flying for classic."  pretty much the same result.
---
people want to start over because after aq  most servers get dead very fast
---
When lounging, a controller is superior to KBM in every way.
---
Low 40s. Played launch through Wotlk.  Wicked fucked excited to play launch (and hopefully eventually TBC) again.
---
Please share, I'm also running a warrior, paladin, 2x mage, warlock group for AoE dungeons
---
&gt; this requires tons of addons that will most likely not exist at the start of Classic for Classic
---
It requires ONE addon, [ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/home/), and it will be available for Classic at launch.
---
Walk. Dont run.
---
Sure, but when playing WoW, a KBM is superior to a controller in every way.
---
&gt; How to fix them
---
No layering. EZPZ.
---
From someone who have been playing competitive pvp games for the last 8 years, all this seems funny.
---
There's a huge part of the community that claims that Vanilla was all about the adventure, the community, the cohesion of the world and so on, explicitly saying that PvP was never balanced nor fair. On the other hand it seems like there's a huge amount of people that are all for a fair and organized PvP, like in modern competitive games, yet Vanilla didn't even have Arena or anything like that.
---
I agree that having a bad PvP experience is, well, bad, and to lose a duel due to leeway might not feel great, but to me Classic PvP has so much bigger problems than this.
---
last time i played (last year ish) i ended up raidlogging but i was pretty depressed at the time and lost my drive.  My guild were fuckin awesome guys tho (playing with them again) and i think in a normal state i'd have played more
---
anotehr problem was that i was resto druid and got lucky and basically got all my pre-bis and raid gear very quickly (not much competition for loot as well) so that kinda took away the motivation.
---
this time i'm hoping to do cooking and fishing (never done before), get some pvp ranks, maybe do some rep grinds.  plenty of stuff i haven't done despite having a fuck ton of played time in vanilla :D
---
For min/maxing sure, but 99% of the things you do in WoW can be done with a controller just as well as they can be done with KBM.
---
Nah Blizzard is wrong
---
Played a Tauren warrior and there was no 15 yard melee range while running
---
You actually had to be near people unlike this abortion Blizzard is releasing next month
---
"German"
---
I disagree. The players would still be able to move around just not as freely. The only thing that changes is the convenience of the phasing.
---
EZ
---
Not really.  I'm legally blind with only 2 degrees of vision.  My setup is very different from everyone else's.
---
&gt; Can there be side-ways progression without a large portion of the base feeling like it's worthless to do?
---
I would like to see more progression done in a horizontal fashion. Gear that doesn't have just more stats but instead can enhance/alter talents, spells, and abilities. Just improving none viable builds would be a great start, then have gear that can introduce a whole new spec for a class. You wouldn't need to add in a new talent tree but could have something that would change all instances of +fire damage to apply to other elements.

Is this a thing? No Nut November but for July, pre-classic... I can attempt this.
---
I'd translate this to "lol you smell a lot"
---
So a PvP-specced rogue beats a mage who doesn't do anything whatsoever to improve their PvP chances. That's kind of obvious.
---
Tru not since 2009

Healing priest on horde, priest are the only dispellers for them. Warlock for alliance, will of the forsaken and shammy purge really hurts them in PvP.

In GTA V, RDR2, and Witcher 3 I turn off minimap and the majority of the UI that's nonessential.  A much better gaming experience.
---
their intention is to let you know that it looks like shit. it's not stupid to give an opinion on something when you're clearly fishing for attention/feedback. when people post positive things about it do you think " What's your intention in doing so? 😬"? and it's even more cringe that you're digging that deep to have a meaning behind a wow tattoo. the difference between glasses and your shit tattoo is that you can get contacts. retard
---
That would lead to the creation of name hoarders. Groups that snatch the most desired names then random them for $
---
Ah okay, I didn't know that I assumed it was more addons working together.
---
29 going on 50 here. I’ve watched some streamers and I’m so out of touch with them and the online gaming community in general.
---
Or instead of adjusting Blizzard could just recreate the game properly and if that means cutting systems that were implemented to solve problems that don't exist in 2019 then mostly everyone agrees they should do so
---
Their opinions would be baseless because they haven't used the addon.
---
Wrong place to ask IMO
---
The factions where fundamentally unbalanced at release  because shaman and paladins where very different, and had their own strengths and weaknesses. 
---
Don't get me wrong my idea was a way of potentially making it work not a fleshed out design. 
---
I didn't say they would permanently pick a side. I said they could gain rep for being able to travel into previously unfriendly zones. If you wanted you could also build into picking a side for conflicts, so using wsg as an example, you could decide you want to fight for the night elves instead of the horde. This removes any balancing issues for the battle grounds.
---
You'd also be able to have guilds that spanned all the factions. Making the characters more like mercenary armies than whatever they are currently.
---
assuming at least a million people will play classic that means a lot more people to hire, which i haven't heard of yet, and i doubt they'll transfer GMs from retail to classic, even if they do, it's probably not enough. Considering this, there's a chance the report system might be automated, which yes, as you said is obviously an invitation for abuse and it will definitely happen since there will be a lot of drama on the servers.

You get more range on your abilities as mage when jumping because of the leeway. (Arcane explosion and cone of cold) Was watching beta streamer testing it.
---
smite is propably the fastest way to kill
---
ok thanks guys,  
---
do we have any idea what the time between phase 1 &amp; 2?
---
My friend will play something like that.
---
I feel like you overestimate the speed of light:  
---
c is around 300km/ms, so the hard, physics limit is that we've got to add 1ms round-trip latency for every 150km of spatial separation.  
---
Optical fibre has a signal propagation speed of approx. 0.65c (0.70c for copper!). This means that even if someone in Stockholm had a straight, Magic Fibre™ directly to Paris, they would still have inherent network rt latency of over 15ms before any data processing is accounted for.  
---
Really just wanted to do the math so please do point out any mistakes I may have made.
---
This is literally the perfect solution. It blows my mind how many Blizzard shills are downvoting this, and the mods are on patrol to delete as much about this as possible.
---
Of course it was the right move, tons of bugs were found in the beta many of them gamebreaking.
---
Without specing into subtlety?
---
Ideas? Yeah, a couple of months seems likely. Nothing official though as far as I know.
---
Beta did his job by reaching a big audience on Twitch.
---
Beta did his job fixing bugs.
---
Beta did his job testing the new systems.
---
Beta did its job not showing everything with the level cap.
---
I think the Beta was fine.
---
As long as people are limited to 10 characters total (for the first year)
---
If that's what you need to tell yourself to sleep easy at night with your CPAP on, then so be it.
---
Higher bandwith does not necessarily affect your latency.
---
ok sorry to hurt your feelings
---
He's leveling an alt irl
---
Well, considering screaming the N word in world chat is against TOS, you should be mad at Blizzard if that's somehow a problem for you.
---
I care about politics but I could care less while I'm playing wow. I just don't care to see 12 year old edgelords using slurs.
---
Play trolls but seeing as im going druid this time around I feel conflicted
---
People will bitch about anything. Smh
---
I would love to see a subtlety build with BiS engineering tools for maximum mischief
---
Yeah, there was. I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or whatever, but your private server experience means fuck all compared to blizzards ACTUAL 1.12 server with the 1.12 client.
---
It all makes sense now Morally Grey is a hair color....
---
&gt;This isn't just "another one", this is the main one that has been suggested for over a year now
---
Didn't know layering had been suggested a year ago.
---
I guess TBC wasn't power creep. There was nothing creeping about how much the power increased there. Power Leap seems the better description.
---
THEY TUK HER JOB?!!!?
---
both are, classic more so because you will rarely if ever use "niche" spells while leveling and raiding.  
---
I leveled with controller, much more enjoyable.
---
It seems like you think using slurs in public channels is somehow acceptable. Not only is it not socially acceptable - or I worry for your environment if it's okay to you - it's also against TOS
---
I love Asmon but that is just too true.
---
Trueee, the shaman enhancement tauren..
---
There would be too much CGI for a TV series, so it would either look really bad for a long time or look really good for half a season.
---
Instead of power creep it could be spec viability improvements, ie make other specs viable through gear in new content while making the general power creep incredibly low.
---
My moms got a winnie the pooh tattoo in the same lol. Good tattoo poor location. Lok'tar Ogar
---
Probably druid since one of their PvP specs is 11/11/29, but you would be still a lot worse than an actual good build.
---
They absolutely addressed and understand the problems of layering and they are removing it as soon as it won't be necessary. I don't see the problem going further in this...?
---
But they also could be a level 1 toon with the name reserved. So maybe play time could work then, aka whoever has more playtime on that toon.
---
Pretty sure I've seen someone get kicked a while ago on the r/wow subreddit, after his guildmates reported him as a test when he wrote "fuck" in the guildchat.
---
I’ve tried that, it ends up having a negative effect though, just too slow... I do actively try and dodge other players though, get out of the way of horses, go around objects that I can actually walk through, but shouldn’t be able to like crop rows on the McLure Vineyard, etc...
---
*Can we get an "Alexsenual was right" in chat?*
---
Hunters are fine and won't be excluded, but fantastic isn't the word I'd use to describe their DPS. By BWL they're the worst of the pure DPS classes. 
---
Play the class because it's fun, absolutely. You'll be brought to raids, but you won't ever beat Warriors, Rogues, or Mages really.
---
\&gt;  i doubt they'll transfer GMs from retail to classic   
---
They don't need to. This is part of the reasoning for reskinning the old client, instead of giving us the raw 1.12 client - It allows them to maintain their current GM system. So they don't have to change their streamlined moderation system.
---
I think if you're trying to do that, the holy/reck spec would be your best bet. You get pretty much all your needed holy talents and the big talents as well from prot to be able to do it all without having to respec. Weapon swapping with the reck procs isn't a good idea because I believe your stacks go away when you do so, so keeping your 2h out in pvp is probably the move. This spec would allow you to heal in pve, and do decent damage while still maintaining your healing power/utility to a good degree in pvp. Plus you should get talents like improved BoP (which also improves freedom i think) which is huge and also getting Kings, so even more utility.
---
Yes, hence: this post.
---
Reset nor TBC is the way.
---
I actually like the near same level pvp aspect. But nothing seems more senseless than swimming out to my island on STV where I’m fishing while I’m at work just to kill me when I have a fish pole in my hand and then camping me because I can only Rez within view. Cheap shot bleed out. Pussies. Find someone your own size.

---
Basically fury until you get PH, and Blood Craze. Then switch to Arms until you get Anger Management.
---
I'll basically be running around, body pulling large groups.
---
I'll have an increased range on demo shout, and it will lower mob melee dps even further with talents.
---
I'll use piercing howl to self peel if I start taking too much damage.
---
After running around grabbing whatever I need to grab I'll kite the mobs back to my group who will AoE them down, and at that point maintaining threat isn't really a concern anymore because the mages can handle shit just fine. My goal at this point is to stay in melee range of a few mobs for rage, and focus on keeping spells from being casted. Frost nova + Intimidating shout will be really nice to reduce damage taken from casters as well.
---
This is all theory at this point, and I'll be setting up my own private server for my group and I to test the waters. With GM powers we can teleport out of dungeons, reset instances, reset talents, repair, etc; so we'll see how that goes.
---
How would you change it? I'm trying 1/3 Inspiration atm for the debuff protection but I'm not loving it. Divine Fury doesn't seem to help me much as I rarely ever cast smite/HF and if I'm casting greater heal it usually means there's no stress. 0.5seconds off a luxury spell's cast time is pretty lacklustre compared to 10% damage reduction when casters tunnel you.

I mean, I don't know the exact specifics, but where do you think all the developer's salaries come from? The magic good will fairy? It comes from subs. It's tied to the cost of the game. You might be willfully ignorant of the cost of developers, but as a developer (not for blizzard), I'm not. I know we don't know the specifics, but why should we ignore one of the biggest driving factors for a company?
---
You assume everyone comes back for fresh launches. You don't know this. I can stay for an absolute fact, that I did not come back a fresh launch after I lost my level 17 Nost character got deleted. I have 100% proof that not everyone comes back. I'm 100% willing to bet that multiple resets pushes more people away than it pulls people in.

I have no idea what its is, how it looks like and how it works. But I'm indeed 99% sure that thing, that controller or whatever it is, will never work as good as a keyboard and mouse.
---
Its based on knowing what a mouse and keyboard can do... so not compleetly baseless.
---
But maybe I've a terrible imagination that I can't imagine a controller with the amound of "easy to reach" buttons and a curser as precise as a mouse.

Corpse camping will usually only happen if a) you have killed them in the past and they've put you in their "kill on sight" addon list or b) you are near a quest location or near a profession node
---
Do you have a group or will you be multiboxing?
---
I don't think that's fair either. The person who played the most is most deserving of the name? I'm not sure what the solution is if there even is one.
---
Works for OSRS, ofc I'd like to see a few years of untouched Classic before truly making up my mind, but I see no reason a similar approach could not work.
---
Ranged have leeway also.
---
nO cHanGeS!
---
Purgin' due to politics. Let's keep to nice peaceful topics, where no one ever gets at all contentious, like layering, changes, post-naxx content.
---
You said that the Classic team knows the basic principles of Classic. Layering is so far away from the principles of Classic that it's basically the opposite of some of the core principles of Classic. So even having layering for a "limited time" (which we don't know for sure yet) shows me that they really don't understand the basic principles of classic.
---
It was going to be my main. I'm just going to roll some bland ass OP class and make an alt later on :'(
---
Dont listen to what other people say PLEASE DOWNLOAD A LEVELING ADDON. You will need it and enjoy leveling 100x more if you do.
---
Yeah that's a good idea along with the account being active.
---
They still might. Movies like transformers can break even in the US but may make 10 times the budget internationally. Sometimes they may even do a chinese dub and reanimate the characters like kungfu panda. It's no mistake that fast and the furious have a super diverse cast because they know it will appeal to anyone on the planet.
---
Yes it is! That mount is amazing. It's still my go to ground mount in Retail in BGs.
---
Delayed release.
---
I will check it out, out of curiosity.
---
Looking at the launch pf previous expansions, EU launch will still be full as fuck

I don't think menethil harbor existed at that time?
---
Oh man that makes me wet. I hope so too
---
Hey thanks, but we're really not looking to play Warrior, and we'll unlikely go anything but DPS except for 5man dungeons to find groups quicker.
---
I heard Spriests are probably one of the best 1v1 classes, but I was wondering if two of them made them a force to be reckoned with in Classic as they used to be in retail about 10 years back. 
---
We're looking to play Battlegrounds and leveling mostly, some Open World PvP, so that's what my question is catered towards. Mostly DPS, maybe if necessary some off-healing if the situation requires this, but that's it. 
---
What do you think? On paper I would say it should work wonders. You're both incredibly durable with heals and shield, and two sets of DoTs should destroy most if not anything right?
---
always druid, we recently got a second druid after 6 months of having 1 per 40 man.
---
^ very easy early lvling too, pull 4-6 at a time
---
I’ve literally been talking to the guild I will be raiding with about this in the fact that I updated absolutely love to see content be released continuously (not quickly) as a 60 cap to avoid the troubles of new spells, higher level cap etc to avoid straying from the classic part of the game. The whole reason for classic is to have the original game that was so amazing and perfect in my opinion (besides known bugs that made it fun still) and having a longer stretch of end game content without changing the original concept of vanilla ya know? This is something I would love to see but 
---
1. It’s ultimately up to blizz/activision 
---
2. Could potentially cause problems as content past what was already in the game there isn’t the core group of developers from the past might not all be there obviously from me shooting in the dark so new content will potentially not have the same feel. 
---
An example I would have would be that looking from Onyxia and on up until Naxxramas was the same not necessarily cut and paste but same formula. You had a streamlined route or palm of attack for raids before progressing to next boss or final boss etc but naxx was such a revolutionary raid having the freedom to go wherever and plan alternate routes etc it was such a perfect and well designed game (speaking off punk rats naxx video that just came out) and having the potential for amazing new content like that while remaining at the 60 range for higher tier groups etc
---
The top 5% shouldn't get nothing but designing entire raids for such a small group seems like a poor use of resources. I'd be fine with a single *really* difficult boss added to every raid patch. It gives them something to struggle with while the less cutting edge players can struggle with the normal raid.
---
Any chance of a source?

Ya I was thinking mage too but their PvE rotations is a nightmare of boring.

So much has changed in the internet infrastructure since 2006 and yes some people had 20 ms. Most people had 100+ ms back in 2006.
---
Well, if you're completely new to WoW, I doubt you're level 60 in a week, but yes. Apart from just the enjoyment factor of doing PvP. Could always be phase 1 is shorter than that but, who knows. It really is in the air currently, but 1-2 months seems a reasonable guess.

Why the F are you even here?

Top lvl cringe btw.

well thats why i said its only mandatory once you have your zg trinket, because then your greater heals are as fast as the flash heals. before that it would be okay to take some points in spell warding instead i guess.

A couple hundred years before the opening of the Dark Portal according to the wiki: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Timeline_(unofficial)#The_New_World
---
Without being able to swap layers at all. Major difference.
---
We should just be able to make surnames in wow. This way there would be less likelyhood of duplicate names and would be great for rp’ers.
---
Also with a merge, you could just change the surname, and your character name would stay intact.
---
getting my piss jug cleaned up and ready to go.
---
And a Dance studio !
---
Yes you have decade old memories and YouTube videos with a bunch of unknown variables that's clearly more reliable than a client tested with full knowledge of the variables.
---
I think it looks pretty much good to go from what we have seen.
---
There are literally loads of ways you can do this.
---
3P Warrior tier, gives you an extra intercept charge every 10m
---
5p Warrior tier, chance on weapon swing to give 2 rage, cannot occure more than once every 10s
---
8p When you battleshout you gain a bright red rage aura around your character for 10 seconds
---
There is visual progression, mobility progression, and generation progression, there are tons of ways to itemize set bonsues and gear. 
---
Secondly, the players sticking around for end game content are doing it to hangout with their friends and fight more engaging bosses, this obsession with gear is not going to be as big an issue as you guys state it to be. People who are obsessed with gear are just going to quit when they finish the current tier regardless.
---
Thirdly you can stat gear in different ways.
---
Paladin 5p gives like 45 spell power, you can give that as a proc for 10s but double or triple the amount and make it have 1ppm, and the net result of spell power is the same distributed.
---
You can also make things like Corrupted Ashbringer which are weapons so powerful that you are actually Taxed HP to equip them.
---
The muti-dotting everything for leveling is not going to work. You only have one proper dot each ...... mob have way more HP. A warlock putting up all three dots on the same target still needs to do some work. 
---
As to PVP Spriest doesn't work too well with either Mage or Rogue. The dot will break sheep, gouge, blind. The shadow weave does nothing, have no mobility.
---
Best pairs are Warrior + Paladin (not shaman even though they got WF the dispel and freedom is HUGE on warriors). Spriest + warlock both lack mobility and rely on shadow based damage and dots, both are tanky. Mage + Rogue insane burst, CC and mobility. Double hunter is pure cancer even more so than Druid + Rogue or double Rogue. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
From my experience, some classes I tend to see in demand for PvE have been:
---
Warrior tanks  - pretty decent demand in 5 mans (less so in raids)
---
Holy Paladins in raids (4-6 to cover blessings). Because some players see them as "slow and boring" to level with a "boring healing rotation" at 60, they are sometimes in short supply.
---
Resto Shaman - I don't have enough recent raiding experience as Horde to say this with confidence, but from my understanding, chain heal and the buffs provided by the Shaman class make large quantities of Shaman healers pretty desirable for a raid group.
---
Warlocks &amp; Resto Druids - While these aren't necessarily in high demand, for whatever reason these classes often make up a smaller percentage of the total population relative to other classes.
---
Escape Artist is better than Stoneform. Every gnome melee knows this.

Too bad they were forced out, must suck for you :/

Yes, but why would someone think about it when he isn't playing (anymore)?

So why is this considered a good thing but suggest invite isn't? They're both QoL features that weren't in Vanilla. You're literally suggesting that they take out one QoL addition since they have another one that does just about the same thing but slightly less convenient.
---
She can sell me reagents any time.
---
a little air blew out my nose with this one, wp

I would prefer a delayed release. It's sad to see that we are so impatient to play Classic that we would prefer to have it bugged and not authentic than enjoying the game to his full potiential.

Yes they probably patch is since

I embrace the lore. I'll take my night elf to the moon well and "pray" for Elunes blessing before going into a dungeon cue. I try and behave like my race and class as best as I understand them.
---
Not sure that pally's smoke.  :)
---
thats the same except for world pvp isnt it?
---
There's been talk of weapon procs such as Rogue Poisons, Shadow Oil, and all those random "chance-on-hit deal damage" procs having a chance to proc off of 2 attacks if they're made within .6 seconds of each other. So if a Rogue has 2 weapons that are close in speed and equip the same Poison, the first strike will continue "checking" for a hit for the duration of the "spell batch", allowing it to proc off of the second strike made with the second hit or any instant attacks (such as Sinister Strike) made within the same window. 
---
So you could go auto attack (1 proc chance) &gt; sinister strike (1 proc chance + proc off auto = 2 proc chances) &gt; off-hand auto (1 proc chance + proc off first auto + proc off Sinister Strike = 3 proc chances) so 3 hits with a total of 6 rolls to apply poison within .3 seconds of each other.
---
Although I'm not sure if this has been tested thoroughly in Beta.
---
The whole reason why they went back to implement spell batching was to ensure that you could execute important pvp maneuvers like vanishing death coils and gouging blinks.  In doing so, they accidentally drastically lowered the precision needed to execute those maneuvers, making it less vanilla-like.
---
You can be a pedantic man-child all you like but you're arguing for a less vanilla-like experience for 98% of the playerbase.
---
Warrior tank, paladin healer, and two mages. We will prob pug the 5th as a recruitment tool for our guild.
---
I thought the Burning Steppes hadn't been a part of the Red Ridge Mountains since Black Rock Mountain exploded a couple hundred years before the First War?

Yeah, Medivh and Lothar were horrible miscasts.

Whoosh
---
Ele is still pretty good at 60 and always has that 1 shot potential.
---
I wonder how ranged toons managed to survive in Vanilla then?
---
very different as it affects leveling experience and changes the amount of different classes at level 60.
---
I didn't like the changes in Cataclysm to PvP or talents.  Warcraft is much better as a trilogy.
---
Nice one, where did you get it?
---
The Lies in "The Truth About Layering": Why I was wrong in 2019.
---
Bugs. The phased release is perfect for rooting out bigger bugs post-launch.
---
That's assuming naxx clears in classic will be as low as retail. There are private servers where a couple dozen guilds cleared AQ40 on first reset. Molten core is very possible to be cleared in the first week of the game being out. The playerbase is a lot more hardcore and knowledge is already there.
---
the blind resist is stone skin
---
I am.. I played a shaman in classic, and after Cdews sick plays and glorification if the class, I feel like it'll be over populated now. So I think I'll be a Priest.
---
my [human route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit#gid=1812004207) gets to 11/12 with only 1 bottleneck kill quest (webwood venom at level 6)
---
Thanks for the answer. Guess I have some time to consider what I want to play. Might end up rolling a warlock instead of a shaman.
---
&gt; You'd have 5-20ms on ADSL playing shooters and sometimes 100-200 in WOW.
---
Originally all of their servers were located in Texas. The latency from Dallas to the New England area is still pretty high. By patch 1.12 they had more locations and divided them up by Battlegroups. For example, Ruin was the most popular US East group, and Bloodlust was the most popular US West. Granted - the majority of Vanilla happened on their Texas servers, which meant that most americans had poor latency, but not everyone did, and it was cleaned up by the end of 2006
---
Now I have to make a character on all three to arbitrage the AHs before merge and play where I'm not getting ganked/where spawns are up.
---
Dude what do you mean? Grenades are a huge part of vanilla pvp and are fair on all classes. Unlike fap which just fucker over certain classes. Really everyone who wants to pvp in vanilla should go engi
---
Delayed release. There’s no do over, I’d rather not take the risk of having bugs that fuck up the experience for everyone.
---
I’d leave at the end of Cata, only because I met a lot of great people during Cata, otherwise it would be Wotlk
---
It wasn't against the ToS so there is no point debating it. Being an asshole is your right in the game. The community can handle it themselves if they want.
---
In the midst of the attack by the Night Elves and a crazed Demi-God, it's the trolls who actually detect the magic pool as a potential source of power.
---
All the Orcs know is it's a source of magical power, and Thrall was like we gotta stop juicing on dark magic. But Hellscream is like, we will literally all fucking die if we dont, we are fucked eitherway.
---
When Mannaroth shows up they are surprised as hell.
---
Yeah Dwarf and gnome is interchangeable
---
What world you live in where this would be the case? Pretty much every gaming company relies 100% on automation to trigger punishment on players who get reported nowadays, they don't care about false positives making innocent players get unfairly punished after receiving tons of reports coming from coordinated trolls.
---
I would leave right after the end of WotLK.

This is just so wrong I don't even know where to begin. Mythic raids are a billion times harder than anything in vanilla, and the majority of vanilla was made for casual players. WoW has never catered to the top 5% of players.
---
dude sick. looks like we've been having a very similar thought process. gl with your group
---
It has been in the games for 3 years prior to that post, why would they?
---
Stormwind also didn't have access to the cemetery behind the cathedral or farm but doesn't mean they weren't there. The Cemetery has graves in it that predate wows release so we can surmise that both existed pre wrath.
---
Hmmm alright, thanks! That explains a lot. We might be thinking of Mage/Rogue or something then.
---
Still, on the topic of Shadow Priest, so you get the other DoT abilities later on? Meaning early game it'll be Shadow Word: Pain and spamming some hardcast ability?
---
Retail WoW probably brainwashed me, but I can't imagine the damage will be that lacking! This is definitely gonna be an interesting experience, as all I know is post-Cata WoW. Can't wait, honestly.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Probably going to take a break in AQ+ honestly. PvP will probably die off then because they don't update the gear.
---
As for expansions? I don't really like tbc but I'll play for the launch. Then come back for wrath and call it quits.
---
I'm more tempted to believe those leaks so far. Even so far that I have to consider a class that is fun in all those expansions.
---
Like, Druid in Classic is awesome but on the weaker side and balance is just not viable. But in BC, Druid tanks were actually insane. So far that when I raided BT the MT was a Druid.
---
no..... stoneskin not only makes you immune to poisons and bleeds but also is one of the few ways to get out of blind, the best CC in the game. Nothing to do with resist mechanics.
---
/facepalm
---
Private servers are not the same
---
What you're experiencing on the pserver will be more of a problem 6 months from now in Classic when people are starting fresh toons, not at launch.  There won't be too many bored level 60s for a while in Classic. 
---
Now, there will still be gankers, but the majority of 60s will be focused on raid attunements/5 mans to get raid ready.
---
I think it could have been done better
---
The AB release, lvl 40 raise and AV weekend was all on top of each other 
---
Maybe delay the AB release, and end it off with AV weekend
---
Maybe also telling them in better time when things are gonna happen
---
Just out of curiosity, do you think toggling on *walk* to reduce your own movement speed would reduce the leeway range? Or is the 30% slow condition dependent on the existence of a debuff?
---
What an ignorant comment/ it’s literally impossible for me to send data from New York to California in nanoseconds let alone less than 50 milliseconds. Why would you comment on things you clearly have not even a slight clue about?
---
Yes, they are basing it on private severs. Know how I know that? Because Blizzard have confirmed that this is working as intended, on an actual 1.12 client. Therefore, everyone who remembers anything else are mistaken. This is objective truth and not up interpretation.
---
No it was this exact dance template:

Recreate the Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK as a trilogy and forget about the rest :)
---
"Works" is a generous term to describe that.
---
I would leave when WoD would come. Not because i didn’t like WoD, but because it feels too recent at the moment. Maybe that changes in 10 years if it were to be re-released.
---
Suggest me something else if you’d like

Me too. I would absolutely love to go into TBC. Wrath not so much as that is when they introduced one of the biggest game killing things for me, dungeon finder.

Gallows humor didnt exist 100 years ago?

---
Depends on how bad the bugs are. If we're talking a bug where you can 1 shot a raid boss, then it's blizzlike and we can accept it. Anything worse than that tho! Haha no thank you sir!
---
&gt; Also, how is working the additional 25% stun resist with the 5% base resist ? It is 30% at the end?
---
Yep. And it stacks with other talents like Iron Will which could bring it up to 45%
---
Bullshit. In 1996 I had cable internet and had 25 ms ping to Quake servers in my area, and like 120 ms ping to servers literally 3000 miles away (Florida to California) if the routing was favorable. Your claim of 100 ms being "good" in 2004-2006 is complete bullshit. By 2004 100 ms was already considered "bad" or "barely acceptable" to anyone interested in serious online gaming. Out of three different raid groups I participated in in Vanilla, the only people playing with a ping over 150 were either in China (one person), the middle of nowhere Canada (2-3 people), Alaska (one person), or one guy who had satellite internet. That's out of three different guilds over the years, each with enough people to field 40 man raids with people sitting out, and each with different main focuses (PvP, casual raiding, more competitive raiding (e.g. some server firsts on a medium pop PvE server)).
---
If you look at all internet users in the United States, maybe you can make an argument about ping times in general, but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about WoW players who play seriously enough that they would even understand what leeway is and its potential impact on gameplay. This is automatically selecting for very well informed players looking for an overall optimal play experience. This means anyone old enough to pay for their internet in this category would have gotten cable or ISDN if it was available. 
---
Your entire premise is based on a lie.
---
Of course they're not fair on all classes. Some classes can break the grenade others can't. Some people don't have engineering and can't even use the grenade.
---
It takes insane cognitive dissonance to even fucking suggest the grenade effects all classes fairly.

Pve,  dn't have the time or interest to get ganked over and over again in stranglethorn vietnam

Horde enough to shave my legs? Nah, I'll roll gnome.

37 here, i was busy doing cocaine when classic was released, this time ill play it right.
---
There was a poll here not too long ago, out of the people who cared to reply a full 2/3 were &lt;15 when they started playing original vanilla WoW. Meanwhile I started playing as soon as I finished my very last exam period of my degree in spring 2006. We're not even the old farts, spare a though for all the old grognards who were already approaching middle age at the time (there seem to be plenty in this thread).
---
Yes, you could (in 1.12). Know how I know that? Because Blizzard have checked on an actual 1.12 server with an actual 1.12 client and it's working as intended. I'm not sure how this isn't getting through to you.
---
Should give it to your mom then.
---
You could level an alt? This way you wouldn't be *forced* to progress your alt through content your main has already done.
---
Anything equal to or beyond the power of Naxx (T3, I..v ~80) should never be added to the game. Naxx already breaks the game in half.
---
Any horizontal content should be around BWL/AQ (T2  / T2.5) at best.

Released doesnt mean that it was fully adopted and everyone suddenly has it... it took time and im talking for my country because is the shit i had to suffer but in many citys(even some really big ones) it took too long to get cable.... Myself had 1mb max speed with 60-90 latency in fps(mainly cs in country servers or nearby countrys) and 150-250  in wow servers(own country) till 5 years ago...
---
Yep, Druid by far. Warlock would be the 2nd least played.
---
Why should I care if someone spent 6 years formulating a theory when the underlying assumptions are not only wrong but intentionally manipulated to make their worthless point?
---
I like classic BC and wotlk. After that i have zero interest.
---
I've heard that. And I've also heard how screwed they are in 1.12. I don't mind having to be really good at the class to succeed. I do not want to try twice as hard to be half as good.
---
Most players had 20-100 ms back then. Therefore they experienced the game back then with spell batching and leeway as it was back then. Therefore to recreate their experience from 2004-2006, assuming that's the goal, then the spell batching should remain as is.
---
The good ole Blizz way is fine with me. Vanilla released and it was like an open beta with a paid subscription. The bugs will never be 100% fixed, so why delay the release?
---
I don't think you realize but half his suggestion involves slowing down the power creep.
---
You joke, but my HR guy has been playing wow for about 4 hours now.
---
Or where a boss is completely impossible to kill. But that was more of a feature than a bug I guess..
---
Dude, holy shit the horde loves this place, been leveling 2 ally toons in a PS there are horde players there 24/7 since like 10 days ago.
---
I love it, i know where ill be going to get my world pvp when i hit 60.
---
The difference is that **this is how it was**. Your other two examples are not how it was.
---
I love bc and wotlk, but also dislike that they begin to break down the classic philosophy. Flying in bc is unchangeable. I wish it wasn't there, but the expansion doesn't work if it's taken out. Cross realm dungeon finder in wotlk however aren't necessary and absolutely shouldn't be in the game. So, if they keep xrealm dungeon finder then I'm playing bc and that's it. If they do wotlk without dungeon finder though then I'll play through that as well.
---
No. This was more pserver bullshit and isn’t in Classic.
---
Yea it was a biggy for me, the sudden change in energy, motivation and clear thinking is the best. Look up r/Semenretention so many eye opening topics!
---
now its getting interesting lol thatd be cool if it does
---
No. That's a PServer thing and doesn't work.
---
Here is some constructive criticisms.
---
Orc attack boost is 25% to BASE melee AP .... maybe 1-2 DPS at most?
---
Undead free bandages are weak and require a body nearby
---
Tauren you mentioned shadow resits for undead but not mature resist for tauren ? how about the 2 extra yard range?
---
Dwarf frost resist. bleed, disease and poison removal and immunity for 6 or 8 sec.
---
Troll shadow priest with shadow guard can proc blackout very important and makes them a good choice.
---
That is improved Blizzard, which is a talent in the frost tree. Rain of Fire and Blizzard are spells that act the same way, dealing aoe damage in ticks over 8 seconds. Idk if Blizzard is only a CC in BfA, but in Classic, it does AoE damage.
---
Why would you think there'll be server merges for imbalanced factions when that doesn't even happen on retail.
---
r/classicwowplus is that way -&gt;
---
Seriously though, you know there’s a specific sub for that topic and you still choose to bring it here?
---
Good job.
---
Except they won’t. The world record for getting 60 is like 4 days and 20 hours. Accomplished by Joanna a hunter. And that was done by meticulously planning everything out.  Not a single person will get 60 in 3 days played time. Anyone who thinks that hasn’t played vanilla wow.
---
In a foreign field he lay

Lonely grunt, unknown grave

Why should you listen to the #nochanges crying in Vanilla but not TBC? Some people prefer that.

yeah same, horde paladins and alliance shaman killed the game for me.

I never jump around as 'part of combat'. I only use names that fit the world or an rpg-setting at least. But that's also along the lines of what do I practice to not break immersion for others.
---
Every time I hear someone use the word "rotation" to describe using abilities in a PvP situation I realize I can't take it seriously.
---
How does resilience work for the classes that don't crit?
---
And I'd rather PvP be balanced through set bonuses and stat optimizations than through just "This works here but not there."
---
You too, man!
---
I also miss her... "reagents" damn so much. Hers were the best.
---
No changes
---
Never played or had any experience with Alliance PVE so not sure what the unpopular class it. Probably something that is fun in PVP, maybe rogue?
---
&gt; b) increased response time in peripheral components of computer; input devices - mechanical keyboards + higher response time gaming mouses
---
If anything these are slower now since they all use USB while back then PS2 connectors were the standard.
---
Would you find this authentic and fun if all classes and raid were bugged like a private server ? If waiting a bit could bring us a perfect Vanilla it's fine.
---
Well it's not the case of Classic since it's more or less ready.
---
Mages can beat ele shams at higher levels esp at 60, but you gotta be smart about it. Venruki caught on in one of the duels and realized it becomes a battle of attrition with the mana. There's a lot more to it, but that's the gist of it.
---
33 here
---
Well, glad nobody has stolen my names. I just logged in using the free 3 days after the last time I logged in was legion.
---
Lmao youre the one insulting me when you are taking everyone simply explaining why youre wrong as a personal attack over a video game.
---
Fap can single handedly win you match ups witha single press of a button. While grenades take a lot of skill to land the skill shot and are generally accepted as a fun item all pvpers use in vanilla. As I said if you want to be serious in pvp mostly everyone besides you agree that you need to take engineering.
---
Nooo Wrath
---
so no world of warcraft then?
---
This isn't how ping works. I live hundreds of miles from the valve servers closest to me and I get 5ms in CSGO if I queue into a Seattle server
---
God I hope that's not what it means
---
Before pre cata. 
---
Wotlk was questionable in my eyes by cata ruined it all for me. 
---
Why blizzard, why?
---
You're tearing me apart blizzard
---
BC
---
TBC didn’t get too high until Sunwell, same with Vanilla I think gear is fine till Naxx where it does a quantum leap.
---
&gt;You know you need 8 tanks so you start giving your warriors loot early. 
---
This was never *the* issue in Naxx 40. You absolutely didn't need good tanking gear to tank 4HM, you just needed to be crit immune. Druids could actually be used to tank the 2 caster horsemen since getting crit by them actually wasn't a big deal unless you got insanely unlucky and hit at the same time as a high-stack damage pulse.
---
The issue is that Taunt is considered a spell in classic and can be resisted 8% of the time, which means your tanks actually needed the 3pc set bonus from Naxx 40 or needed to get lucky on the fishing boss in ZG for a trinket to force their taunt to hit if it got resisted. 
---
I'm a pretty big supporter of keeping classic WoW as close to authentic as possible, but that shit was absolutely retarded and should be changed either globally (tanks literally never have spell hit, so this is always a potential issue) or specifically for this encounter.
---
It wouldn't be the first time in the history of mmorpgs that this has happened. Server queues are the most common solution which maintains the integrity of the "one world for all" experience that mmorpgs, like Classic WoW, were built on. i.e. one of the core "classic principles". Say what you will about layering, good idea or bad idea or whatever, but there is no arguing that layering in itself flies in the face of what makes classic, classic.
---
Where did I suggest they take out anything, you creepy soapboxing eager-to-argue freak?
---
There's oceania servers coming.
---
The RTS came in a trilogy and the MMO came in a trilogy as far as I'm concerned.
---
Its fine, im playing on a PS, lakeshire is filled with 5-10 hordes everydays and i just done my questing with 2 characters just fine, dying 2-3 times tops.
---
Care bears will say you spend 80% of the time corpse running, they say this to validate their choice to play easy mode pve.
---
I play GW2. It’s not the same. It’s just a universal resistance and once you get to max, you don’t need more.
---
Blizzard is going to release Classic and then become ghosts to the community. Every couple months, they'll press one button and new content will release, but that's it.
---
Then in ~2 years, if they haven't already figured out a way to convert Classic players over to Retail and there's still at all a significant playerbase in Classic, they'll dump TBC on them and MAYBE open up a single Vanilla-only server per region for the diehards to free transfer to and then be completely forgotten about.
---
Blizzard is never going to spend any resources or time developing new content for Classic unless the Classic community accepts all the changes that makes Retail have much higher profit margins than Classic ever will. That means an in-game store with pets, transmogs, mounts, whatever. It means WoW tokens. It means $60 expansions.
---
It's just not going to happen.
---
Exactly this. I'm very much looking forward to all the ppl rolling shammies because they're not the 5% that are as good as Cdew. And pvp becomes fun against them at that point.
---
+1 lul if they roll enhance.
---
Obviously the best thing is going to be practice but outside of knowing the exact combo to use on someone who jumped you, just start tossing abilities and moving. Obviously the easiest targets are those who sit there and backpeddle while you destroy them. 
---
Maybe try ganking folks so you can understand what people who you get the jump on do to repel you. If you can get a fear off and get away though you’re golden.
---
Backpedaling to cancel the leeway mechanic is a valid strategy so I would assume *walking* works as well, but I can not test it.
---
I feel ya but i dont think its that big of a deal for mages. Guess we just have to wait and see how everything plays out, im rolling mage anyways.
---
Does this apply to Druids when shapeshifted?
---
Good god.
---
Imagine being this cynical.
---
This guy knows how to beat an ele sham.
---
I'm being downvoted but im very confident i'm correct. You get mana leeched back to your own mana bar when using viper sting in 1.12.1
---
So then you admit your post was dumb, pointless and you wasted everyone's time by bringing up a pointless statement?
---
K, moved on.
---
This guy plays horde
---
And they have still yet to fix fucking layering. So stupid. It’s so dumb. So pathetic. Absolutely ridiculous that they won’t acknowledge there are issues with layering. Absolutely disgusting.
---
Costco v. BJ's tattoos inc.
---
They had enough time. Beta could have been handled differently. I don't want to wait for the fuck up. I have the feeling no matter what they do, the first 3 months of the release will be the beta.
---
So, I vote for BUGS NAO instead of bugs later.
---
Right! Thanks!
---
At one point during vanilla I attempted to roll an alt on German EU because I was taking German in school. I found I wasn't quite fluent enough to express things like "The quest reward is in the back of the cave. Take the first right and follow it to the back." I remember thinking it was really cool figuring out what guten n8 was though.
---
Some people say it doesn't happen as much as everyone says, some say the opposite. Really it comes down to the individual server and the zone you're in. Some - even most zones, you're probably going to be fine. Maybe the occasional death. Some zones are going to be a war zone and full of relentless corpse camping.
---
It's best to expect the worst. You're committing to playing on a pvp server so you should be mentally prepared for your days being ruined occasionally. If you hate the idea of your limited free questing time being spent running back to your corpse, then it could just not be for you. Because it it will happen sooner or later.
---
As an undead rogue I'll be doing more than my obligatory fair share. Night elf male, human male, gnome male, all these things will be prime targets.
---
Tip I don't see mentioned often for newer players - if you're being ganked repeatedly, ress as far from your corpse/the enemy as possible (preferably in a bush or something) and immediately mount and run away when you respawn. That's a solid tactic against most classes. If it's a Rogue or Hunter, logging off for 5 mins can be the best strat. Usually enough time for them to get bored.
---
Wotlk turns to shit. 
---
Hopefully they also don’t super nerf TBC dungeons and remove attunments.
---
Cata after they push the patch that retard-proofed the dungeons
---
I don't know man. Mythic raids aren't that hard tbh. Be geared. Be good.
---
After BC I'm out. BC was the best time I had in this game so I wouldn't mind reliving it. I don't specifially remember what made me feel this way but WotLK just didn't feel like the same game to me anymore. It was mostly there but some things just felt off. And every expansion after just got farther away from what I fell in love with at the beginning.  
---
To be fair, even BC introduced a few things I didn't like. Flying was cool at first because you got to experience something new. I liked the discovery of places you wouldn't normally be able to see and BC was designed with flying in mind so it worked fairly well. Plus it was max level and Outlands only. So overall I don't think it was a bad implementation. However, after I saw the cool things and got use to it I realized I didn't like it. It simply took most of the danger out of the world. You no longer had to worry about running into other players or mobs so the world was less threatening and therefore less engaging.  
---
The second thing I hated in BC were dailies. I hate FOMO. Thankfully it wasn't terribly overdone in BC and at least netherwing had those eggs you could farm outside of dailies for the rep. But I hate feeling that I have to login every day or I am all the sudden behind. Weeklies would be a decent alternative. But still not a huge fan.  
---
Anyways, long story short, I'd stop after BC.
---
so why call the mmo by the rts' name?
---
With leeway in the game, melee attackers (who are meant to be kited because they do so much damage) aren't kitable. And for hunters, kiting is the most important thing they can possibly do. Warriors and rogues can literally shit on hunters without the hunter even being able to melee, trap, or shoot. Here's why:
---
I really hope Blizzard reconsiders this stuff, especially leeway and the scatter/trap DR. I know of many Hunter mains who are rerolling or even considering quitting WoW. The game is different nowadays, and it's meant to be enjoyable for everyone.
---
More classes are also raid viable in multiple specs , gear also favours this too, vanilla shoehorns most specs because gear from raids is limited and not variable.
---
I think they should look at where the people are and design their difficulties accordingly. Most people midway through Tier 2? Make the next raid Tier 2. Most people have Naxx on farm? Make the next raid Tier 4. Find where the speed bumps are and smooth them out not by making the content easier but by introducing new opportunities to get through it.
---
Imagine being this naive.
---
Blizzard is a corporation with shareholders. The bottom line is all that fucking matters.
---
that's just the nature of the beast. Trust me I've done it on big private server launches and it does indeed suck....but at the same time it felt correct. I would much rather know that everyone in the world is in my world at the same time than quest faster. I've waited 10 years for classic, 3-4 hours to level 5 is nothing. I'd rather be able to partake in the shenanigans players tend to get into than potentially miss out because I'm on the wrong layer.
---
I was responding to this line:
---
&gt;So this is going to make classic FEEL different from your actual vanilla experience...
---
That line is wrong. Classic is going to feel exactly like my low ping Vanilla experience. Like the experience the majority of people I played with had. Complaining about bullshit melee range that makes no sense is literally part of Vanilla for a lot of players.
---
Testing shit aka min maxing is whats fun for me when im max level.
---
Because they did have time to model it out i guess, lore wise they had one during the first war.
---
I always assumed this was due to spell batching.  The first spell requires cast time and the second spell is instant cast so they both go out in the same batch, where the crit buff is still active.  It might be easier to replicate given the relatively large current spell batching window.
---
fucking disgusting
---
Helloo?? What about SPANISH? It’s way more people affected by spanish
---
Oh I’m hardly naive, but holy shit. Where did Blizzard touch you? 
---
Don’t like it, don’t play it?
---
This. Modern content is actually some of the best they've ever made. The art, music, animations, cinematics, dungeons, raids. Hell, I even like the M+ system granted they could do a better job of preparing new players. Writing sucks, WQ mechanics suck. GCD sucks. downgrading from legion class legendaries sucks. Azerite FUCKING SUCKS. 
---
It's not the content. It's the gameplay.
---
It's not.  One is warcraft, one is world of warcraft, because they take place in the same universe.
---
&gt; I fully expect to be downvoted or directed to /r/classicwowplus but this is a much better spot for this discussions IMO. I'm hoping for the opinion of all of us, not the ones strictly devoted to seeing changes.
---
Well hey. No disappointments that way. And more pleasant surprises.
---
Given u/EveClassic :s track record with guesses, say with regards to Language-servers and Oceanic servers I might bet on them being wrong just based on that.
---
But if I'm honest I expect them to be relatively right on this. I won't mind TBC realms though.
---
World buffs are not exploits.
---
Sadly most people are just ignorant bandwagoners. Why think about a system when you can just be outraged and complain about minor problems :\^)
---
5 weapon skill does exactly nothing in PvP.
---
Portuguese in Europe, not in the world. Spanish has more speaking people in Europe than Portuguese, and perhaps italian even.
---
I played ele sham back in vanilla and this is how it was. The same thing also works with Clearcasting (both spells will cost 0 mana)
---
No
---
It takes on average 200ish hours of play time to reach level 60. Some classes are faster and some are slower. Hitting 60 in a month is a pretty reasonable goal.
---
How they always did it? You choose the language you want to play in and then you get the list of possible realms to chose from.
---
One percent of resilience reduces damage taken from all player attacks by 1%.
---
&gt; set bonuses and stat optimizations
---
This would still only work if those set bonuses and stat optimizations gave PVE benefits that meant nothing in PVP, or vice versa. So it's essentially the same thing, just much more convoluted.
---
PVP has never been more balanced than it is in Retail right now and it's because nearly everything is separate, including talents.
---
Okay. That's fine. That's how they designed it and that's how they want it to work.
---
Can we not cry this time around boys about every single little "design choice" about the game? Because that's how you end up with BfA.
---
Again, you *know* there’s a subreddit for this, but you don’t care. How is this my problem?
---
&gt;premature balding, bedwetting, nerd tribalism, and infantile humor that mark a Horde player.
---
That's weird considering the poster boys for classic alliance players are [these two](https://i.imgur.com/q45Wued.jpg)

Meanwhile the Horde equivalent is [this handsome devil.](https://www.method.gg/images/uploads/teams/players/29-01-18-2-Qeer7bs[1].jpg)
---
Good luck using a potion to remove CC while you are CCed and can’t use said potion.
---
yes if you read the post you'd see that's exactly what i said and more
---
since you have 5/5 wand and 5/5 spirit tap, you're fine with any spec. Specifically with yours, you're focusing on survivability/tankability/pvp rather than dps. You'll never die, but you hardly have any +dps talents. 
---
Since you care about efficiency, go pure holy being sure to take Holy Specialization and Divine Fury. You can then go as far as Searing Light &amp; Holy Reach for max efficiency, or switch over to disc to diversify and be somewhat competent in 1v1 world pvp scenarios and a somewhat easier time leveling.

I didn't say he used sprint.

Oh my, I thought there was Vampiric touch, but you're totally right. That's it. 
---
Sooo maybe I'll skip out on the Spriest. Now leaning towards Rogue or Mage. I heard Mage has a boring rotation late game (Frostbolt/Scorch + Fireball spam), but I'm worried that if I pick Rogue I'll regret not having gone for the great QoL teleports/portals. 
---
How important were they? Having the teleports. I'm assuming they save a good bit of time on the whole, but there will also be less areas than the WoW I'm familiar with... Though, with how gigantic the Classic map is still, just thinking about having to take the flight paths everywhere sounds exhausting/costly, but this might be a bigger thing in my head than it actually is in-game.
---
My guild had a DKP decay system. If you miss a raid you lose DKP points. It wasn’t too bad if you miss one here or there, usually if you let the raid leader or a guild officer know ahead of time(at least before they started forming the raid up) then they wouldn’t take away points. Or if the raid was full and you were left out they wouldn’t take anyway being that you aren’t making any points so no double penalty for that.
---
It was there mainly for players who weren’t apart of the core raiding group can’t stockpile DKP from other means and come into one raid and take some loot away from the actual progression group.
---
Give us the bugs, it's vanilla.
---
They was fired but they will be hired again..
---
70% crit chance hell yeah
---
You are a party pooper, mister!
---
We're all going PvP from the start this time :)
---
How do you get 200 to France(or wherever the datacenters are) in Europe? Even from Sweden, I get 40-50 ms.
---
Druid easily the fastest
---
Then Hunter and Shaman
---
He said a mage will be the fastest leveler, mage aoe grinding is much faster than hunter questing
---
What about the shit-tier writing/acting/plot?

I'd much rather heal than spam frost/shadow bolt till my eyes roll out of my skull.

I dunno, funny titles for both?

I'd leave right before the release of ICC and come back for MoP. Then leave forever.
---
People who join later, let's say year or two after launch, will get bored or frustrated more easily and quit. This would mean that the game would die out very quickly.
---
Number one reason is PvP and world PvP. 
---
If someone wanted to level a character and just do PvP it will be very boring and frustrating when you ding 60 and your ilvl is 58 and you're competing against people with ilvl 80+. You're forced into doing early raids until you get an ilvl that is competitive enough.
---
&gt;for as long as possible
---
Correction: Gear should NEVER surpass ilvl / T3 item power. 
---
Naxx gear already breaks the game in terms of baalnce and power scaling. 3 dots from a full Naxx geared lock (T3/Sp combo gear) Will kill anyone with less than ~5k hp.
---
Between Priest, Shammy, and Druid for me. I want a fun offspec, and Elemental and Balance seem fun just because how much extra effort they take to even be able to raid with at all, max consumes and full BiS before you can even consider stepping foot in a raid. But Priest is my most played class by far, and I suppose Shadow is possible endgame if you're lucky enough to be the person to fill that one raid slot to buff Warlocks. I'm also really confident in being able to level Priest fairly efficiently and quickly, I have a hard time getting behind the more melee orientated leveling play styles of Shaman and especially Druids, whereas Priest is the only full cloth caster hybrid class. I do think Shamans and Druids have the slightly better class fantasy, and Shamans get ghost wolf at level 20 making them the fastest class in the game at that point, and it's also cooler than travel form.
---
I wish this was easier. So far I'm only confident I'll be playing Undead or Tauren, oh and that's another thing, Undead Priests get the best Priest Racials for rolling Shadow.
---
Another counterpoint - they're still a bunch of demon consorting bastards, and the PC undead are evil as hell too. All those low level quests testing the new plague show how nasty they are and playing through those zones really showed you how accepting the average forsaken was of Saturday cartoon villiany
---
It's actually really simply explained why they were characterized that way in game when all the rest of the lore wanted them to be less outright evi l- for the majority of vanillas development most of the team refused to think of them as "the forsaken" and instead referred to them as the scourge, and treated them as such. Chris was having fits about it the whole development process. 
---
All the quest writers were only playing lip service at calling them the forsaken, and wrote the quests as if they were outright evil. It caused alot of drama during development 
---
Thats the real reason why the forsaken are so damn evil.
---
Eating and drinking during the duel adds a layer of complexity and strategy, otherwise it is button mashing fest to see who gets lucky with Crits, resist and misses. 
---
As to people suggesting real world encounter.... having a duel area already works against classes like hunter and druid.
---
In my own opinion removal of eating and drinking will trivialize the duel.
---
I'm 34. Hoping I'll be able to find other old farts to play with
---
I was 20 when it came out in Nov 04, so I'm an oldish fart:  34 (35 a couple weeks after classic release)!  Still trying to decide between the main class I play now (priest) or my vanilla main (shaman).
---
To a part yes but I think it will be traded for gank parties. Also there will be those who don’t raid and or finished gearing. Remember we have promises to clear MC in a week. So once many are 30’s and 40’s there will already be guilds pulling in BWL
---
With the presence of layering, how could you remotely care about these small to medium bugs.
---
If you can't drink/eat then you are removing Shadowmeld, because eating + shadowmeld is one of the most useful combos. So you now have to ban all the races with passives. Like orcs woth that 25% stun resistance or trolls with regeneration because there is nothing you can do about it.
---
Also, you are removing 2 skill from the mage kit, are you going to remove 2 skills from every class?
---
Amazing how people take so much from private servers as fact, and this is coming from a private server player.
---
Alright! Thanks again.
---
Also, I played a good bit of Fire Mage and generally found it more 'interesting' than Frost. Is it still 'viable' in Classic or was Frost by far the better pick, as it has been in most of WoWs lifespan?
---
How was Fire in Classic? Are there 'instant' cast Pyroblasts? Was it as much waiting for procs to get big damage as it is now?
---
No they don't. Internet latency has not significantly changed since 2004.
---
Locks can just dot you and there goes your 6k hp.
---
ele shams / PoM Mages can actually delete players every 3 minutes.
---
The scaling on some classes is bat shit insane... adding MORE power creep would actually ruin the game.
---
Yes but there should be an offline time limit. Like 3+ months offline you do not keep priority.
---
A totem is an npc and count as such for hit calculations, not a pvp target
---
At the end of TBC. I'll come back for Wrath if they make changes to it.
---
It wasnt a beta, it was a showroom
---
My post is directly addressing that, saying we could make different types of progression not just power
---
I heard there are these Raptors in ungoro crater that you can make bank off if you can tag them
---
This is something I've been thinking about quite a bit recently. Essentially the idea of speedleveling vs. "comprehensive leveling". For me, I am just as much concerned with getting to pre-raid BiS gear as I am getting to 60. Putting the finish line there changes the equation on whether profs are worth it or not. If your goal is super low played time or world first, you obviously won't be taking professions. But maybe your goal is to kill Rag in the first month or even first 2 weeks. A guild doing this will need some people with high profession level (would want at least 1 high BS, 1 max skinner, 1 high alch, 1 high enchanter, and 1 or 2 tailors) . At that point the question is "what's the fastest path to 60 w/ a gold mount, and 2 300/300 profs?" instead of simply "what's the fastest way to 60?"
---
The more I think about it, the more I like leveling profs as I go. If you can get ahead of the big pack, your gathering profs will be mostly uncontested. (If you ultimatly want a crafting prof at 60, just take it's necessary gathering prof plus skinning and bankalt the mats needed to level your crafting prof later). Skinning plus any extra mats from the other prof makes the 40 and 60 mount come much faster. You won't get world first 60, but sub 6 days /played to 60 is still very attainable even with 2 gathering profs, cooking, and first aid. 
---
I see a number of issues with sprinting to 60 and doubling back. Doubling back only works assuming you have an epic mount, given how much farming you'll have to do. Getting 1k gold fast on a fresh server with no professions is not going to be easy. You can't sell devilsaur leather, Lotus', thorium, bags, enchants, nor transmutes. You're going to be farming cloth, essences, and vendor junk predominantly. It's possible you could corner a market early and make bank, but few people will be able to do that, especially given what "high value" mats you'll be able to farm. I'll admit, my experience with vanilla gold farming is somewhat limited, but lets put some numbers to it. Let's say you can farm 50g/hr as soon as you ding 60. I think this is a reasonable rate. At that pace, you have ~20 hours of farming just to get your mount, assuming 0 gold at 60. Then you either have to back track and start farming your prof mats or buy them on the AH. It's hard to say how long that could take or how expensive it might be, but I think it's safe to say it's at least 10 hours of farming. Remember, if you go to farm up a gathering prof now, you'll be fighting against the leveling pack nearly the entire time. So you have at least 30 hours of post-60 farming to do.
---
Compare that to leveling profs as you go. Let's say you take Herb/Skinning. In order to get to 300 on both, you need to skin 400 beasts and you need to collect 500 herbs. Skinning beasts takes 5 seconds each and picking herbs takes 20 seconds each (running off your optimal pathing, potential failures, actual picking, running back to your pathing). Time spent on collecting gathering mats is less than 4 hours throughout the leveling process. Double the gathering time numbers if you'd like, it's still rather fast. Now its unlikely that skinning alone (assuming you are saving the herbs for alchemy in this scenario) will get you 1k gold by 60, but it should get you a substantial part of the way there. To maintain consistency, I'll assume that aside from skinning gold, you start at 0g at 60. Skinning should easily get you 100g by 40, but that means you've lost all of your skinning money. So how much money can you make from skinning on just 40-60. I think somewhere between 250 and 400g is reasonable but I'll defer to someone more knowledgeable on that. Let's call it 300g. We also have to consider you're better ability to farm given your 2 gathering profs. Adding the 200 plus herbs, rugged leather, and devilsaurs, your gold/hr, jumps to 60. Getting that remaining 700g will then take ~12 hours. Total hours is still less than 20, compared to over 30 hours by zerging to 60. 
---
While this isn't conclusive by any means, it's interesting to think about. Some things I can say for certain are:
---
1) you will not get world first if you take any professions beyond first aid.
---
2) you can and will stay ahead of the leveling pack even with gathering profs, assuming you know your route.
---
3) with professions that are at least 250, your gold farming potential at 60 is not only higher, but its more adaptable. Satyrs and furlbogs getting camped, go check WS for a lotus, head to Ungoro to kill some dinos. Adaptability is important in vanilla and having that open to you shouldn't be discounted.
---
Was a mistake!
---
Blizzards most recent forum point says otherwise. Classic leeway isn’t the same as vanilla leeway, they said themselves that the current leeway is to reproduce a similar feeling to how the game played in 2004-2006.
---
They already implemented a cooldown on changing layers.
---
Private Servers win. Their spell batching feels right, their leeway feels right, the mob damage feels right, and they have no layering. Better product. Plus they get to take from Blizzard whatever they did have wrong. They will have a perfect recreation of Vanilla WoW, and it’s all free of charge.
---
Best mobility is druid if not indoors, mage with blink every 15 sec and rogue with improved sprint and prep. 
---
Shaman need to cast ghost wolf form and it does nothing to remove snares. Hunter aspect of the cheetah is good for kiting and setting up openers, not for running away.
---
Stuff in this thread is amazing, now I want to see the Iron Forge once. Link please.
---
THY TOK R JRBS!!!!!!!!
---
If you want leeway as it “aCtUaLlY” is you are not a conpetative player and you wouldnt notice a difference either way.. sadly the majority of people are not very good at the game so they have no clue how it plays out
---
Yeah, same.
---
I can wait to quit again the second they announce TBC. Absolutely garbage expansion.
---
Really bad writing on bliz's part.
---
I'm actually hoping that classic gets popular enough that they split the timelines and completely ignore everything that happened in retail wow post vanilla, so they can development the plot in a fashion more consistent with the previous games. It's alot to hope for, but hey, we got FMA and FMA:B right? If an anime can do it so can a game!
---
Would it be feasible to let the players choose whether to move your character to BC or keep it in classic and run both sets of servers?
---
yea sorry, i replied too hastily. seems like fun way of approaching it
---
Power Leap, really.
---
Excellent, I am not on beta just read stuff here. Is there a work around to the cd?
---
In theory there will always be servers dedicated to classic. If they ever release expansions they will be separate servers
---
You're a person who still thinks that leeway is broken even after [they've confirmed it isn't](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887/23).
---
You're also probably the sort of person who instantly thought "they're just saying that!". If you never believe Blizzard, you will never believe that they're not fucking it up somehow and you will never be happy. You may also be the sort of person who genuinely believes they were ever going to faithfully recreate every single patch to the correct timescale with every exploit and bug as and when it happened.
---
You *cannot* have an "authentic" vanilla WoW experience in 2019, it is never, ever going to happen, through Blizzard or privates. This is as close as anyone is ever going to get. Enjoy sitting and waiting, angrily hoping for something that will never happen while everyone else forgets about all the completely inane bullshit and plays the game, I guess, man.
---
Because post AQ the game turns to shit, tbh.
---
Naxx items are too powerful and break the game.
---
There is no perfect solution unfortunately. The lvl 1 with the name reserved wouldn't get to keep the name under either of our scenarios.  Unless they logged in and left the toon afk whenever they weren't playing.
---
Some combination of level and play time would be a more equitable solution. Maybe a parameter for percentage of time played on that character. So people don't have to change the name on their main because somebody that does nothing but play WoW has a 4th alt that has more play time than the others only character.
---
Most importantly is before anyone is forced to switch names give everybody with a conflicting name the option to change it. Maybe a cosmetic incentive of some kind. Make an in game event of the merger and renaming. No matter what people are going to be upset might as well make it something *happening in* the world instead of something being *done to* the world.
---
So no matter what the spec is each class has their full kit of spells, with the exception of the few talent base abilities. So a fire mage has stronger fire spells and couple extra fire abilities. Frost mage has stronger frost spells and a few frost abilities otherwise they both have the same kit.
---
source?
---
Isn't it like 3.5 million right now?
---
Yes this as well. Even if leeway was coded exactly the same as it was in 2006 (Once again, their forum post implies otherwise) this was hardly known by anyone and was therefore not part of any meta until now, so my point still stands.
---
Yikes.
---
&gt; So how many years of PVE content is a new player going to have to trudge through in the game with 40 other people before they're at all competitive in PVP?
---
That's the hemorrhaging I'm talking about. Raid gear should be great in PvP but it shouldn't be the *best*.
---
bugs
---
Torn between a mage or a rogue at this point.
---
Important considerations:
---
* I will not have time to hit 60 let alone raid
---
* I will play with friends who will also not have time to hit 60 or raid
---
* Going Alliance, but would love to visit and "hang out" in Horde zones for nostalgia 
---
* PvP server
---
Pro/cons
---
**PROS**
---
* Food/Water for me and friends makes 
---
* Portals are good since I want to see a lot of the world for Nostalgia
---
* Easier leveling being ranged and having AoE access
---
* AoE gold grinding helps me save time
---
* Fire and Frost both viable for PVP
---
**CONS**
---
* Squishy. Will likely die on being looked at in world pvp
---
* No stealth so it may be harder to safely visit enemy areas (Can I portal to enemy cities?)
---
Rogue 
---
* Good at world PvP both offensively and defensively 
---
* Can sneak around enemy faction territory with ease and even enter enemy cities 
---
* Slow and difficult leveling
---
* Need to use a lot of first aid
---
* Very weapon dependent which may make leveling even harder
---
* Alternate spec (daggers vs swords) requires a different weapon which again is hard to get
---
Overall I think rogue fits more of what I want out of the game, but Mage really fits with how I want to play the game day to day. Hard decisions.....
---
Those leaks were extremely fake but it's pretty safe to say they'll do TBC and WotLK if Classic ends up being a success. Basically no reason not to.
---
I think that there will be bugs at release, but since very many ppl are playing, those bigs will be addressed rather quickly.
---
BC I actually look forward to more than vanilla. I'd *probably* still play WotLK again, but as a tank or healer instead this time. Cata, no thank'ya.
---
I'd love to see TBC redesigned with no flying mounts and no dailies. Add in a bit more world PvP elements while they're at it.
---
Well on the bright side, there IS a melee hunter build. It just requires pvp gear. And world buffs.
---
So, just farm r14, get a sexy Ony buff, and you can be a weaker Warrior for 2h! Easy.
---
The game will feel laggy and unreliable thanks to this and if you get hit from 15y away you will feel cheated.
---
I don't think intentionally making the combat feel worse is the right thing to do. Spell batching at least adds some element of skill, leeway is purely detrimental, because it functions like lag. Nobody likes lag... The whole reasoning behind #nochanges was to preserve the integrity of the gameplay of vanilla wow, which does not extend to emulating bad internet connection. Keeping leeway the way it is now will just make the game less fun and more random, and nothing else.
---
I wasn't talking about long-term. By that time, there will already be info about the actual amount of players, etc, and other soultions may be used (like opening new servers and allow migrations in case of population overflow)
---
What Blizzard probably tries to do now is to open less servers than predictions (to reduce the chance of having a bunch of dead servers eventially), use layering to smooth the phase 1, and (if that is required), do something more permanent after, with statistics and etc.
---
Luffa!!!
---
lmao you think there will be 3k pop layers at the launch so naive
---
Hey look, it's the moron himself and I didn't even have to say his name three times! Pretty pathetic that you searched yourself on Reddit.
---
It’s super nice to use before you vanish to get rid of bleeds and poisons. It’ll be really useful versus rogues warrior feral druids and hunters. I guess you could say that dwarf is the ultimate vanish class
---
I agree, the Scarlet Monastery is a garbage place for garbage xenophobic religious zealots like all humans are in vanilla.
---
What, did an Undead Rogue hurt your feelings?
---
My only complaint with the movie is that it felt like it was rushed and shot entirely in a small room with CGI
---
This isn't science. It's a pre-planned conclusion looking for an excuse to justify itself. The very premise is a lie: that most WoW players would have had ~200 ms ping. It's a simple fact that, among players for whom this kind of thing would have impacted their play in a way they would have appreciated, like raiders or PvPers, it is unlikely they would have been on dialup. It's taking a global average of all users and trying to apply it to a small, niche subset of users that would in reality be among the outliers of low ping at the time.
---
And for what purpose? To justify a major, fundamental change to the game among a crowd that claims they do not want change. To create a permission structure in which requesting that change becomes okay.
---
It's idiotic. Don't make up a lie to justify what you want. Just admit to yourself that maybe some aspects of Vanilla actually sucked, and that some parts of modern WoW, like how it handles spell processing, simply make the game feel better. Admit you want a change because it just feels better. Don't make up convoluted and easily disproven lies about average internet latency among WoW players in 2004-2006.
---
This hardly seems relevant to Classic wow.
---
It didn't even last the week after the initial announcement. What exactly are you looking for here?
---
Lmao has a cast time and anyone can literally run or use a movement skill. I get it man you dont want to admit youre wrong but you do t have to get so hurt over it.
---
Why are you surprised? Vanilla lasted for 2 years and was more than a decade ago, private servers were a thing even in vanilla and still exist. They have much longer history now. I leveled some low level characters in vanilla and one character to lvl 40, came back when tbc launched and leveled up to 70. Just now when I look at the classic videos I realise that many things I remember about vanilla werent actually there until tbc, like summoning stones summoning for example. My point is that its very easy to mix up things when you played different versions of the game many years ago.
---
Warriors do not go Dual Wield fury, that’s a Pserver thing and mainly because the armor values and hit chance are way off.
---
Try that noise in classic and get two shotted. Even a lot of these Fury PSERVER tanks have acknowledged this.
---
Wait and see
---
I dont want to make a thread on its own for this and me playing a hunter or not depends on this, couldnt find a better place :D
---
The only people that ever get to make demands of Blizzard are the Activision executives, board members, and the shareholders.
---
You're just a ant.
---
Except they did run and use a movement skill in the tournament and it missed and batcbing made it still hit.
---
I would drop after patch 2.4.3 (i think it was the patch just before WOTLK, where they made Sunwell easy for everyone. Cuz... ppl could'nt kill Mu'ru). That's where they changed the classes too much with pruning and skills removal.
---
Did you even read what I said? I said, mages with different gear level, but both bringing consumables and taking the raids seriously should be both awarded loot.
---
I would not give loot to people that slack, go afk, show up late, not have consumables, play meme specs, not know their class or the fights etc. obviously, but if someone puts in the effort despite not being geared, deserves rewards for it.
---
Troll with a well timed berserk can be very powerful. especially as a caster.
---
Correct also the players are buffed well higher than normal game will be possible cost wise. The MT and OT will maybe have a flask. The DPS won’t because the materials are much more available on Pserver.
---
Buddy, CS was played more than Q3 from like 2000 onwards. By 2004 the Q3 scene was basically dead.
---
Flying mounts. 
---
You used to have to walk everywhere, or if you were a big boy you got a whole entire 100% speed boost from your mount. But you still had to navigate *through* the world.
---
Flying mounts are what killed this feeling of immersion in the game. Now you can just mount up at 310% speed and fly over everything. The only scenery you get to take in is the treetops.
---
slapping a modifier on a raid you can do in lfr 30 mins after hitting max level is exactly the problem
---
Go play a funserver, buddy, won't you?
---
Sucks for you, but that wasn't typical.
---
So wait till weekly quick question thread. Even if I can make an argument about layering and playing a warrior, still shouldn't post here.
---
&gt; briefly from patch 1.9 to 1.12
---
from 3 January 2006 (1.9) to 5 December 2006 (2.0.1)
---
&gt; briefly
---
&gt;companies dont produce something unless it makes them money
---
Very astute observation
---
There has been no comment on them. However the vendor where you enter the code were added in the BC pre patch so later than the 1.12 so it seems unlikely.

Nothing will top George Fisher having a Horde tattoo, [and subsequently having a heated gamer moment about hating the Alliance in an interview that led to him appearing at Blizzcon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2yvZM1wn04)

Good1
---
Release TBC after Vanilla!
---
In terms of WoW playing population in 2006? Not in any significant numbers.
---
The NPC won't be in the game as far as I know, so no.
---
I always wished they disabled drinking for arena.  As a healer I just didn't enjoy the games taking so long and made it so I couldn't even stand playing 2s.  Managing your mana should be a bigger part of the game.
---
I did from release and my experience aligns with this.
---
I'm less concerned with immersion though and more concerned that you can just randomly allow one thing and not another.
---
Well according to OP, Naxx gear would be nerfed by a lot, and the new top end tier 5 gear would be 2 ilvl higher than what Naxx gear is today. And assuming T5 content is more difficult than the previous tiers, T5 gear would be even rarer than Naxx gear. So OP's idea lowers power levels overall until people start reaching the very top end.
---
I'll enjoy it less and less as time goes on and be 100% out by Cata.
---
BC had flying mounts, dailies, and on a personal level I'm sure I'm in the minority here but I disliked the aesthetic of the expansion overall.
---
WotLK had 2 good raids as far as I'm concerned (Ulduar being one of the best in the game's history IMO), but also started LFD and never having to leave Dalaran for 99% of your playtime.
---
My mistake. I can't imagine the OPs working with out the players of a server being able to choose what server for there realm and made assumptions.
---
They are also punishing for not properly executing their rotation correctly and carry a lot of huntard stigma(I played one in Vanilla and TBC)
---
Feels a lot like you have to put in more effort to achieve sometimes not even as good results as other DPS classes and you still get to be the butt of half the guild jokes regardless of performance.
---
Fun class to play but they have their issues even without bugs.
---
I'm sure I will get downvoted for saying all this though for... reasons...
---
Yeah you are correct, it’s just hard to look past those sweet bursts you see sometimes lol. Kind of why I’m leaning towards priest since ele burst and enh rng can be so unreliable.
---
The same way it does now. That’s classified as account sharing (now, and in classic) just FYI.
---
You don't have to pay for BFA. You have to pay a sub fee. They same price we have been paying for 15 years.

Surprisingly people don't seem to understand that. There's been posts on here saying they are giving us classic as a favour and purely fan service.

Yea I would just vendor them. I think almost nobody will buy enchanting mats at the start of launch because nobody got gold.

Spell hit chance is 83% on bosses (17% chance to miss) unless it's different for warriors...

If you display the layers and let people pick a layer once with 1-2 limited number of swaps would allow people to play with their friends in the same instance of Azeroth but remove the ability of people to exploit it by swapping layers on demand.

I'm missing something here. This is how the game worked before. Everyone that had today's connection speeds and latency back then would have the same experience. It was only because of your latency that you thought the leeway didn't exist.
---
Right here. After 27 years, it's finally confirmed to me that Darkshire was formerly known as Grand Hamlet.
---
Layering is not a problem.
---
That’s the entire context for this discussion...

You gotta pay a sub to play classic, just like it always was, you dumb or just training with this post?
---
Booty Bay is a goblin city though right?
---
You are correct, and it's surprising how many people forget that.
---
Maybe you weren't playing at the time, but Naxx was always legendary for the supposed difficulty and rarity.  My guild downed the 80 Naxx within 2 days of the release of WotLK.  Then after some farming, it all felt boring again.
---
The myth of Naxxramas was defeated.  Some people miss that myth even if they never did the content.
---
That's something about raid progression which was destroyed IMO by raid difficulty.  The sense that there were unique and interesting places to go that were extremely difficult but dropped the best loot, and it was exclusive to the best players.
---
People's sense of wonder and imagination is why MMOs are successful.
---
I'm getting flash backs to Ulduar and Trial of the Crusader. Ulduar was probably the best raid in the entire game and got followed by TOC which was the worst raid in the entire game. Yet when TOC came out all interest in Ulduar died even though Ulduar was superior in every way and only was out for less than 4 months so lots of guilds were still progressing and things were still fresh. TOC just offered too much free loot for so many easy encounters.
---
Not the right thread lol
---
Cdew even explains this himself after the duel tourney. It’s just fitting a 2nd spell into the batch window
---
Youre a nobody

&gt;Your yearly subscription to WoW Classic pays for about two weeks of toilet paper at Blizzard HQ in Irvine, CA. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/c8ta9s/your_yearly_subscription_to_wow_classic_pays_for/
---
You know it's true because some guy said so. Lol.
---
Hunters kited just fine in yesterdays duel tournament.
---
1. Need a subscription to have Beta, Stress Tests, or Name Reservation.
---
2. Classic and Retail are bundled together.
---
3. Retail is getting a level squish back to 60.
---
There are a few compromises they'd likely have to make in Retail to attract Classic players, but the biggest hurdle to returning players isn't what Classic players "hate", it's the fact that they've missed out on so much and feel like they'll never compete.
---
Maybe not in 9.0, but "10.0" with the level squish allowing Classic players to transfer their characters over and feel equal in accomplishment and preparedness to Retail players? Yeah, that would do it.
---
Some one doesn't like having fun! Take a chill pill billy
---
Leeway is broken in that slows are not disabling leeway as they should, but:
---
15 yards is a massive exaggeration. Try ~9.
---
H0rD3 f0r 1yf3
---
Ah, I see. I didn’t note the sarcasm. So sorry!
---
your inferring what i said in what you said, my idea was permanitely picking a side, yours was faction growing.
---
The idea sounds fine, and it would require a lot of working out. All i'm saying is having neutral factions that permanitely choose a side can still give some integrity to the lore while maintaining the idea of A v B which wouldn't change the game fundamentally. Your suggestion would.
---
Holy. Shit.   
---
This would be so fucking epic.
---
I enjoyed bc and wotlk more than vanilla. If they end up going all the way through wotlk I'll probably stop there, unless some other game ends up coming out that catches my interest.
---
What? No I'm not. He lost all his fights against the shaman. I'd call that getting owned. I didn't say anything about his other fights.
---
There is no pre-planned conclusion. In writing this, the method was determined before looking for evidence of historical and current latencies.
---
There is very little available on that matter as most reports are only concerned with bandwidth and even then, none of it is specific to connections to world of warcraft servers.
---
Therefore, I used the best info available to me: anecdotes from forums posts from the time and an informal poll for current latencies.
---
The math is right. If you can provide better evidence for different inputs for latency or reaction times or batch window size, then I am happy to rerun the comparison.
---
he actually played the duels pretty well just that Shamans are hella good and especially at that level.
---
Yes, their round features make them blend in really good with the surroundings thats why they are soo good.  
---
The stoneform is just a nice touch.
---
And just what do you think your sphere of influence or ability to organize a boycott is?
---
You?
---
You and your friends?
---
You and your guild?
---
You and your realm?
---
You and and this subreddit?
---
None of those add up to a significant enough amount of consumers for Blizzard to care. Especially considering that the biggest of those groups (this subreddit), seem to completely disagree with you.
---
I'd just be happy with no arena, although the damage has already been done
---
You keep your gnome rogues away from me.
---
After Wrath. Wrath was the beginning of the end. Once they do away with spell ranks, I’m out
---
&gt; I thought Classic was gonna have a lot of high level PvP'ers and I thought the reddit community knew something about the game and was pretty hardcore but I guess I'm gonna be reaping people come classic.
---
tell me about your accomplishments in original classic and what server and guild you played in. I mean surely your ego isn't from playing on private servers, right?
---
Right? Schadenfreude....it’s not just for Germans. Sorry Germans, low blow.
---
I would think no expensive consumables... the reason that the old convention was no consumables it because if you use them, it forces the other person to use them if they want the duel to be fair. This ends up costing both duelists a bunch of gold. If neither use it, the only downside is that it removes a degree of skilled play.
---
I really love that my post is becoming the de facto reference to let people know just how little they matter to Blizzard. &lt;3
---
Oh, my bad, but still, point stands, after 1.12 so probably won't see them in game.
---
Lok’tar Ogra!
---
&gt;it's the fact that they've missed out on so much and feel like they'll never compete in knowledge or accomplishment.
---
Ya that's one of the reasons. Lots of us have way more problems with the game than that. 
---
&gt;Maybe not in 9.0, but "10.0" with the level squish allowing Classic players to transfer their characters over and feel equal in accomplishment and preparedness to Retail players? Yeah, that would do it.
---
They will probably try. It's going to lose them a lot of retail players if they make too many classic type changes to anything after BFA. They should just treat them as different games at this point.
---
The real answer is no, it won’t work due to the engine it will be running on. The old engine allowed for macros to be made where backstab was able to be executed from the front. The engine wow classic will be released is the same engine current wow runs on. Which means making macros will be similar to live. For everyone saying “no it’s a private server thing” that is not accurate. Once upon a time in vanilla you could make a macro which allowed you to backstab from the front.
---
IKR? Venruki played amazing. He’s definitely a top tier mage, it was just a bad class matchup. Cdew also designed his spec to deal with mages because they gave him the most problems in the level 30 horde tournament. I believe Ven defeated Cdew in the first tournament as well. 
---
He actually almost beat Cdew once this time around, but got roasted by a juicy Windfury proc.
---
i sure hope so. not every single pvp interaction is BaTcHInG
---
I don't remember what patch or specific details, but long ago priests could get a (fast?) dagger and get a stab in between wand auto-shots, or maybe a shot in between auto-stabs. It was a timing thing that helped your melee dps.
---
Yeah, discussed 2 years ago where it was everyone versus you. And you lost. And now we have definitive proof from Blizzard.
---
#DETUGKIRJRBS
---
did you not see mt 15 other posts about levelling zones and dungeons
---
Leveling resto is a terrible idea, you can heal low level dungeons as elemental or enhancement.
---
Enhancement is probably better for leveling than elemental since you don't rely on mana as much.
---
son: OMG i do no DPS in RAIDS
---
- Shamans get nothing
---
Well, to be fair, they never really showed any real examples.  Bottom line is that they have an artificial system in place, and human error can be very real.
---
because you like feeling like toilet paper
---
Calf tattoos automatically make me judge you as having poor decision-making skills.
---
There is a lot to decompress in this image.
---
This is my thought. When people say they don’t want to pay for BfA. You’re paying what was paid in vanilla and the $15 is worth less for most people playing now than it was then. I’d be curious to see if there is correlation between price complaints and free private server participation.
---
I love both games. And I love Layering.
---
But i won't be getting access to BFA \^\^
---
Muted and reported
---
With his current subscriber count of 10k hes making 100k in less than 4 months. And again he has sponsorships that probably have payouts and YouTube. This isn't a short term thing either. Classic has a loyal audience and he will remain in a healthy place for a long time
---
AQ40 and Naxx is so far out that I'm baffled that this sub talks like it's right around the corner. I think it's gonna end up being like real Vanilla, where not a lot of people end up doing AQ40 and Naxx because they're either burnt out or need to stop playing to handle other things. The most obvious progression, if they choose to continue, is with TBC. Not only that, this chart seems to just draw on a bunch of shit from TBC and Cataclysm of all things, and is pretty much ignoring the fact that Naxx gear by itself is pretty insane for most classes; if you add anything past that you're in the realm of silliness if everything else stays the same (skills, talents, etc.), like the set bonuses and trinkets alone would probably break the game.
---
The best version of gear would be slightly more powerful with more optimized stats. And more gear to support specs like feral Druid tanks etc. maybe more proc items
---
They should have delayed it just for that authentic experience. Anyone else remember a time when Blizzard would push release dates back all the time?
---
you are so off the mark it's staggering
---
Found the future google overlord. I really hate the anti freedom notion people are starting to spout lately.  BUT MUH PRIVATE COMPANY, incoming
---
There's also a bug with elemental overload on the beta.
---
There is always a need for a good healer. If you're a priest and decent at what you do, the race doesnt matter.
---
Not hard when he only duelled mages as an ele sham lol. Total counter.
---
You dont demand anything you basement donkey.
---
That's unlikely to have any significant impact in comparison to gold sellers and buyers.
---
If you have gold in Classic, you're much better off selling it to one of those companies.
---
If you want gold in Classic, you're much better off buying it from one of those companies.
---
What do you mean? Someone is saying he may be onto something. I'm not obsessed with how much he is making just confirming that he has found something lol.
---
On the one hand I think that this would be a decent idea - and it could come in handy. On the other, I tend to lean towards the world evolving how it does, you know? It can be a bit shitty if one faction is dominating, but they’re usually dominating because they kicked so much ass and their competition all quit. I think plain old transfers would be best, that way a dominated server could slowly work their losing side back up if they got smashed wicked bad. The transfers could just change their name, they’re the ones coming to a new server, after all.
---
There are 2 ways you could level up.   
---
Either the leveling build i suggested or elemental.   
---
Elemental would allow you to itemize into a more int / heal / spell damage setup so you could heal during leveling as well.   
---
Although enhance might be a little faster.   
---
Something like this:  [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=shaman&amp;talents=w6xcxdxexfw4w\~w-xaxbxrw8xkxlxmxnw7xgxhw9xoJcJdw.xiy4y5y6y7y8xsxwxRxSxTxUxux.x\~xAxMxxxGxHxDxtxFxVxWxXxY](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=shaman&amp;talents=w6xcxdxexfw4w~w-xaxbxrw8xkxlxmxnw7xgxhw9xoJcJdw.xiy4y5y6y7y8xsxwxRxSxTxUxux.x~xAxMxxxGxHxDxtxFxVxWxXxY)
---
It should be considered gold selling to openly offer gold for other currencies/services outside the game, right?
---
It's just an example of one thing that found its way into classic. I'm not saying people will use it, or that's it's good or bad. I'm saying one of the things on your list is already there
---
Thanks a ton!
---
&gt;The playerbase is a lot more hardcore
---
The *private server* playerbase is a lot more hardcore, because they've been playing the same game for years on end. Speedrunning is basically all they had left to keep them interested.
---
same here dude...
---
already told my family and friends after August 26th i don't exist anymore.
---
I feel like an old fart. But I'm only 25.
---
and how would that be a wise investment for blizzard?
---
Larger player base+a company making money is a good combination to actually see problems addressed
---
And don't slap the games name onto the movie. That instantly turns away so many people from watching it just because it's association with the game.
---
Wrath would be my limit.  TBC was my favorite but I enjoyed Wrath enough that I'd probably stick around.  Cata would 100% make me nope right out.
---
well Josh can only pick people that put up their hand and are willing to participate.
---
It's not like he has a giant pool of people to pick from and he never entered the dungeon himself.
---
Well this is clearly rock solid proof, case closed boys let's go home.
---
I am talking about what people can do if they want to, not what I will.
---
eh you could say this stuff about any class they all have good points
---
It 'should' be handled manually.  So far it wont be handled manually, but they claimed they would limit the automated punishment.
---
If they came out and said they would sort out reports by hand, then no one would care about the feature itself.  THey wont come out and say it, because they have no intention of sorting by hand.
---
But it's not. WoW tokens are an authorized form of turning gold into Blizzard balance and real money into gold. There's no risk at all.
---
Trading gold in Classic for gold in Retail is just as likely to get you caught and banned as buying from 3rd parties is.
---
No, sorry about that :)
---
They are still several orders of magnitude harder than anything classic has to offer.
---
Once again, hot air. Enjoy being the monkey flinging shit from the back benches. That much is obvious to any bystander here. Enough attention for you. Bye.
---
I think he's probably going to spend some time as resto as well gearing up.
---
I played from early wrath to late cata, I loved the content but didn't like how it continuously mattered less and less what server you were on. I don't see it as a matter of which expansion, but more of a progressive scale of the more cross-realm interaction there is, the less likely I will be to continue.
---
Cata had great raids and content up until they nerfed too much and totally ruined the expansion with DS + LFR
---
Don't bother. Any bystander can see who has a point and who just wants attention.
---
You realize that anyone could list millions of examples where fan backlash caused a company to change course? Heres a few off the top of my head: Microsoft, NFL, Facebook, LinkedIn. Most of which dwarf a company like Activision blizzard.  Stop trying to sound intelligent when you are obviously misinformed. Also you don't put commas arbitrarily in the middle of a sentence.  That's called a comma splice friend. 
---
Its hilarious that you think the largest possible access to people would be a subreddit haha and that youd even attempt to use the reddit as your method of change. Oh also try to remember that your opinion is just yours and you have no business making assumptions or generalizations about the thoughts of an entire subreddit heh.
---
Sign.... I was trying to go a day without downvoting... well that didn't work out.
---
Not bashing private servers players. Just the thought that we shouldn’t have to pay a standard sub to play classic. We are getting two games for one sub, not the other way around. Most of us here probably won’t play the other game but that’s on us.
---
Well melee are the clear winners but Warrior comes out ahead because A Rogue will want to kite a Warrior between is Melee and Intercept range with bleeds and Crippling poison but this isn't possible with leeway.
---
Bow down to Warriors.
---
What if they made Wrath without LFD and dailies for example?
---
Basing things off of feelings is not a good idea when you're trying to recreate a 15 year old video game. I don't want peoples 15 year old memories of a video game, I want the actual video game.
---
If you're not first you're last 😎
---
I have played in both stress tests and watch Bean play the beta nearly daily. We Hunters have some bugs but people are really just blowing this out of proportion.
---
I will play classic and would play tbc. Wotlk was great, but I wouldn't dedicate time for that tbc. Maybe tho..
---
Shadowmeld is nice for defending in WSG, Stormform in other situations. If you don’t care about looks.
---
Gimme gimme hunter tendies, Be they crispy or from Wendys. Spend my hard-earned good-boy points, on Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints. Mummy lifts me to the car, To find me bugs near and far. Enjoy my tasty leeway treats, in comfy big boy booster seats. McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's, But of my batching none remains. She tries to make me take a nappy, But sleeping doesn't make me happy. Hunters are the only food, That puts me in the napping mood. I'll scream and shout and make a fuss, I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss! Hunters are my heart's desire, Fueled by raging, hungry fire. Mummy sobs and wails and cries, But tears aren't hunters, nugs or fries. My good-boy points were fairly earned, To buy the hunters that I've yearned. But there's no hunters on my plate! Did mummy think that I'd just ate? "HUNTERS, HUNTERS GET THEM NOW, YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW!" I screech while hurling into her eyes, My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise. For she who is un-pooped on is she who remembers: Never forget my hunter tenders.
---
Yea I’m definitely gonna be about half and half pvp/pve but I would rather step on a lego than play dwarf/gnome rogue. What’s the best rogue farm in classic of you had to guess. I was estimating BRD pickpocket runs around 30-50G per depending on drops of course.
---
Because they're not going to develop a system that differentiates between the two just for those that want to trade gold between games. And they're purposefully limiting the need for GM involvement at all in Classic.
---
They'll see large unwarranted gold transfers and your account will get flagged. Do it enough times or with large enough quantities, and you'll be suspended or banned. That's it.
---
Base AP is everything besides +AP afaik. Strength is included in “base ap.”
---
Well yeah, but you guys had Sodapoppin burning Alliance flags on camera.
---
Yea I’m torn between a gnome mage/lock and a dwarf hunter as my first alt
---
It didn't. You could effectively get to crit immunity in tbc using also some resilience gear, defense was just better at it for a pve tank but pvp pieces could work in a pinch
---
Honestly feels like we're just getting trolled. 
---
I want to ask the Devs "Show me where the bad hunter touched you"
---
"It came out over 15 years ago" is a great argument against people who say that their memories of the game are 100% accurate.
---
Tbh I think I would jump ship if BC was released. Even though BC was the most fun I had in all the years I played WoW it was 100% because of my guild and not because of the expansion itself. 
---
Vanilla was a cool experience with community and the feeling of being a small person in a big world (even after you'd been everywhere on the map) and BC didn't have the same feeling. Flying mounts + the discontinuity of Outlands and the rest of the world ruined it for me. Also daily quests were horrible - as a lot of people have already pointed out, daily quests felt like a chore and if you missed out even a single day you'd feel guilty and behind already.
---
I hope (even though I don't think it's very likely) that Blizzard somehow find a way to continue classic beyond Naxxramas. Keep the max lvl at 60 and introduce new instances and new zones in Azeroth, that would be so awesome.
---
They are both good for their own reasons. Thats the hard part. I kinda like the idea of female dwarf because its more unique than ne female, lol
---
For PvE it rarely makes a difference. For PvP it can be handy, but it's mainly for duels against warriors and rogue - it's not much use against anyone else. It does not remove magic dots/curses, so it has no use vs mage/priest/warlock/shaman/druid etc.
---
Cataclysm without a doubt. Cata changed the vanilla world, and while Wrath introduced LFD in its later patches Cata fully embraced the 'don't talk to people, just push a button' mentality.
---
They are not checking every report. They checking it when you write a ticket.  
---
Some are not requesting a check by a GM because they know already that it is because of stupid spamming etc.
---
This is blizzlike. Anyone who goes hunter literally is a huntard. They are chosing to play a shit tier broken class. Xd
---
Either will be fine. I am rolling resto shammy with some ele pvp fun. Sad times on farming though
---
Tauren Warrior IMO
---
Are people not allowed to criticize desicions? They can’t play the game then?
---
FYI front stabbing doesn’t require macros. Just that the ability be spammed quickly. The most common method being to bind the skill to mouse wheel scroll up or down. It allows you to to execute the skill right in the gaps of when it was possible.
---
You’re correct in that it will not be present however as it basically exploited the lag present on pservers.
---
And how long did you play classic until now to know that it will be a problem?
---
So the value is server side then?
---
TBC.
---
And as the night falls
---
The High Warlord calls
---
and the battle carries on
---
and on
---
what is the purpose of it all?
---
Me, 35, and wife, 36 in October both looking forward to it.  Although I wont have much time to play since I'll be back in school when it launches.  Cheers for the wife being able to sugar momma/carry me when I do get the time to play...lol
---
"Not as tough as Asmon" could have left it with that
---
&gt;They'll see large unwarranted gold transfers and your account will get flagged.
---
Once a month? I seriously doubt they will bother. They would also have to flag your account and investigate. We still don't even know what the punishment will be. 
---
There's also a host of ways to skirt around just trading a mass amount of gold to somebody else. Use the AH. What are they going to do? Make a program to watch for people buying stuff selling for slightly more than current market value and investigate each case?
---
For solo farming, I plan on doing BRD stealth runs for chests, soloable bosses, the coffer enchants, and dark iron ore. I probably won't be pick pocketing because the value is super low in Classic and can be resisted, which would kill you and destroy your GPH.
---
For duo farming, I'll team up with a Druid and do a lot of the same but more bosses, nodes, and such. Once Dire Maul comes out, that will be our primary farm spot.
---
Ditto.
---
Criticizing what? #nochanges is wishful thinking, there are no grounds for crying about it.
---
The human weapon skill would be the stronger choice for a PVE rogue.
---
THANK YOU. Its like these people think world pvp is a duel, if you can't adapt to 2.5 yards you were never going to be great at playing hunter anyways.
---
This isn't the first time they did this. A while back they auctioned off a bunch of stuff too. But this time definitely seems to put the nail in the coffin.
---
same but i choose locks
---
Level up as enhancement until like 40, then spec elemental.
---
*sigh* So little understanding of the architecture of a client-server application.  
---
Sure, it's the server who decide when an attak is valid. But, when you have a client and a server, it make no sense to have 2 different verification, because itwould mean that your client let you do something that the server wil automatically reject, or that the client prevent you to do something that the server accept.  
---
Sure, in his videos he can't attack, because he didn't change the verfication server-side. Everybody and their children understand this, no need to brag about it. BUT, and this is a big but, that doesn't mean, in any way, that there's no leeway server side.  
---
Finally, Blizzard admit that leeway is present on the vanilla 1.12 version that they use to compare with classic. But, i'm sure that you know better than Blizzard what is inside their server-side source code.  
---
I don't say that leeway is a good mechanic, i just say it was here in vanilla.
---
Yes, you're right, you'll likely be able to get away with it.
---
But now we're back to the point where you're better off selling and buying gold from 3rd party sellers rather than bothering with Retail at all.
---
It's both side. As I said.
---
Hunters are fucked rerolling warrior
---
Simple as.
---
More doom and gloom please. 
---
Your deadzone remains the same and if anything your melee attacks are now able to hit that mage trying to deadzone you. People don't seem to realize how much damage hunter melee does, in fact with decent gear a hunter is able to melee down warriors with a degree of consistency. Similarly rogues struggle vs hunters that use deterrence and if they don't tidal/grenade and intimidation can be tough news-bob for a rougue as well. Keep in mind that in order to not autolose the rogue needs to open, needs to have skull or barov peasant caller (and a lot of hunters know how to play around the peasant caller). Without it the rogue ends up scattered, trapped, flared, marked, aimed shotted, concussed and stinged (you may avoid the multi-shot if you don't get stunned from concussive). Oh, and the rogue likely will have to use thistle tea to have a shot at killing the hunter.
---
Hunters are amazing at whining. 
---
\- Fastest levelers
---
\- Best gold farmers
---
\- Great 10sta pvp+pve ZG enchants
---
\- Little to no gear competition and gear faster than any other class except maybe Druid
---
\- Get a practically free epic weapon in MC
---
\- With BIS PvP gear end up with around 6-7k HP
---
\- Top tier backline group PvP class. Hunters with their range and stings can often dictate larger fights
---
\- Solid solo PvP matchups. Favored vs war+rogue+druid and unfavored vs warlock and priest and on fairly even footing vs the other classes (mage can be hard and paladin depends  alot on the paladin and if scorp pet or not).
---
\- Require little raid consumables to pull near optimal DPS
---
"Noo, leeway broke Hunters"
---
Makes me wanna play a hunter now that the class will be less populated.
---
Out of that comp, would recommend mage or warlock. Shaman you will need to go resto end game for raiding.

MAGE CHADS IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT

I dont think you are remembering correctly. It was Cross Battlegroup finder from 3.3.0
---
[Patch 3.3.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.3.0) 
---
I only remember this because it was one of my biggest gripes about WoW and how is was the decline of the sense of community a servers used to have.
---
Ven got 2nd place.
---
It has great use against ud priests, dispel devouring plague.
---
Base strength but not plus STR on gear from what I know, but I will test once stress test is available.
---
Not really..."before BFA" is a very, very, open space. Like 95% of the lifespan of the franchise.
---
I hope you are aware of the fact that you don't even need BFA to play Classic wow. You can just start a free trial account which gives you Classic by default and you need to sub. 
---
The monthly sub is the only thing you need to pay to play Classic. All in all Classic is actually cheaper than OG vanilla cause you don't even need to buy the base game.
---
Skipping on viper sting? Yikes.
---
.. I don't know what i'm looking at, can someone explain it to me?
---
How is getting the buffs available in the game an exploit? Is using Blessing of Salvation amd exploit too?
---
As a Warcraft fan, I thought it was a it was a fun movie to watch
---
What in the fuck does that have to do with an icon?
---
Can you log in to both classic and BFA at the same time? I also don't want to actually play retail. I don't think I have any characters anywhere near 110, since i quit well before BFA.
---
48... cant wait!

Leeway is same as vanilla, AV same as vanilla in 1.12(a patch in vanilla wow, not retail) spell batching is the same as vanilla just with faster server and better ping, vanilla macros were broken AF and many were not good for the game as it made impossible things possible, auto loot was in the game just had to hit shift. Armor-less mounts could prob be added and maybe only avail for very start of game so only first wave of 60’s get them. Hopefully layering is only in the game for first couple weeks. You’re forgetting a fuck ton of stuff that was in vanilla that SUCKED. You advocating for no changes or your ideal version of classic?
---
I don't think classic breaks without the Horde v Alliance story. Classic was a time of relative peace lore wise. 
---
The only thing that mechanically would change is languages, which would further add RP, if gaining rep also included learning the language.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
As Hunter it’s pretty hard when you’re ele because the pet pushback.
---
He came back and had one of the funniest moments in the stream. 
---
Payo vanished during the duel and then this happened.

&gt; Layering. Why not display the layers and restrict the ability of players to **hop between layers?** Again, probably because of some technical reason, so they can maximise the efficiency of their hardware. $$$. They want to juggle us back and forth between layers like some pawns. Why put up with it? Demand to see it addressed even if it costs them more money. 
---
wrong. you have no clue why layering exists AND they are in the process of restricting layerswapping (internal CD)
---
In that video it takes 2 spells in which the second one could have been directed at it?
---
And Passiondale
---
Iirc, the vanilla sound track drew heavily from Conan the Barbarian. Give Anvil of Crom a listen and see if it sounds familiar: https://youtu.be/9j6nyEcIk98
---
Really great guide; informative and concise.
---
The only thing I would do is add information on Tauren mount restrictions, that being that they can ride Kodos and Wolves but not Raptors or Skelton’s but can ride all neutral drop mounts.
---
Yea I’m interested in this, if you wouldn’t mind shooting a reply after testing on stress. I am pretty sure it’s just no +AP. 
---
Just tested on a “cough” pserver “cough” and it definitely was including +str gear. With 51 base str and 23+str with 191 ap on sheet (no +ap) I got +47 ap.
---
Depending on your credit, it can actually be cheaper. The additional costs and time for maintenance is what will get you.
---
Im out at Cata, WotLK was highpoint for me.
---
Trivializes Naxx
---
I've never seen the Obsidian forest in game
---
shamans are shit at 60, why would i roll one
---
just roll a mage like everyone else lol
---
i heard it did very well in China
---
You run ZG because there are some bis items for a lot of classes and for the enchants.
---
Too many pink and purple crystals made players look like some fairy tale anime garbage. BT picked back up with style points though.
---
So, you add a LOT more HP on the new gear as well. Double the Stamina budget.
---
The whole game is much slower than retail tho
---
I'd go for LFD, dailies and maybe flying, but for the rest I think that's just your opinion, cause the game still felt good, and Heroic mode was kinda dope for the era. Achievements have great downsides, but mostly in raids and pvp's, so I would have them remove those sections. It feels good to have this kind of horizontal level up, even if it's not to everyone's taste. The first big problems can be pinned on daily grinding and less community because of LFD...
---
Fair enough.
---
Some of these are broken, like multishot hitting totems and being able to run over traps, but some of them are just so fucking nitpicky.
---
OMG, there's a sound of my arrow hitting my target in Classic, I'm literally rerolling.
---
&gt;.&lt;
---
Wtf is this thing ?
---
Did you even read the replies to your post? Get real.
---
wotlk because i'll hate how the tank classes balance out between each other
---
Wetlands is in Arathi Highlands in this map
---
Seriously, why are they flocking to classic lately? You'd think they'd be content ruining the first time
---
Even worse when shaman gear dropped for alliance, and likewise when paladin gear dropped for horde.
---
I was just watching an Onyxia video the other day of an allaince guild getting a shaman helm. Doesn't really help on the gearing of your raid members xD
---
You sound like a fucking boomer
---
wrath. fuck achievements
---
Person: "oh cool, whats your tattoo supposed to be?" 
---
You: "You're not worth talking to"
---
although the cumulative stacking of the CD sounds pretty damn good.
---
DKRTYYY!
---
somehow i think a warrior that been helplessly kited thousands of times might welcome this.  Maybe the pserver meta was not fair and this is more balanced.
---
This is just a minor detail, but it bugs me that nobody ever brings it up: Classic WoW is, *technically*, already patch 1.13. If you look in the launcher and on the Battlenet client, the game says patch 1.13. So if there is any extra content, it will technically be called patch 1.14.
---
Orc rogue &lt; fears
---
Undead rogue &gt; fears
---
Orc rogue &gt; stuns
---
Undead &lt; stuns
---
Those two races are pretty much preference tbh. I personally hate getting feared so WotF is my preference.
---
so you are a 22 year old fortnite zoomer that never played the game back in the day and now is talking shit like you did? nice
---
They did ban thistle tea
---
Yeah idk wtf they are on about. I don't think I ever saw a "melee hunter" in Vanilla, and survival wasn't some melee spec. It was still ranged, but once a melee caught up to you, you were a little more well suited. That's not a damn melee hunter.
---
Tbh the reason I still like that movie is because of the orcs, it was just so fulfilling to see them on the big screen like that. Seeing a griffon tear stuff up  was cool too though.
---
Have you ever ran around with 50 other people trying to complete Gloom weed/Doom Weed?
---
I'm guessing not. Layering is a good thing. Trust me.
---
Watch the video again right when he gouges the rogue also lands a melee attack on the mage. But ice barrier absorbs it. You can see the absorb on the mage portrait.
---
So explain how he attacked from that range then?
---
Wrong website to ask.  Check the official website.
---
No one said you said he was a bad player.
---
No because you cant pop health pots in arena.
---
If you cant do it in arena you cant do it in duels. 
---
Ramsy Bolton said it best 
---
(Remember those are the rules.)
---
Well the point of the sheet is to point out discrepancies and/or potential bugs to shine light on things that are different/seem different... and blizzard has been tracking this sheet's progress. They've made quite a few bug fixes in the last 2 builds, but they still have a lot to go.
---
I don’t give a sith. I will play hunter. And I will like it and have fun with it. Cos I want to. And you cannot do sith about it!
---
I felt that was the biggest problem with the movie, they really should have done an Arthas story or even Illidan.
---
Your "Improved weapon totems" is literally worth 10 DPS lol
---
Just another view point on it.
---
I could see playing through BC again, but not Wrath. I didn't like the direction it was going and ended up unsubbing for most of it the first time around. LFD changed the nature of the game drastically.
---
People naturally want to progress their character and get better than other people. It's a healthy competition that drives people to spend hours wiping on a new boss. And sure we all want to see the new content and boss fights but what is the point in doing Naxx2 or Naxx3 after you've cleared it once? You're not getting any better gear and the bragging rights for a 4th boss kill are lack luster.
---
Hero.
---
Well congratulations, you just made all other gear obsolete. Wasn't that exactly what this thread is whining about?
---
I’ll add it to the list of 100,000 other opinions on something that isn’t changing.
---
As a future mage main I just want to say, THANK YOU for this! The text guide is very clear and easy to read. Will be having this alt tabbed for a long time.
---
Classic =\= pristine copy of Vanilla. 
---
That is your main problem. But hey, I’m sure crying non-stop and throwing out names will get you what you want, in addition to making you look really immature.
---
But did you know layering has bad things and layering is bad though? Did you know that?
---
Aaah you are THIS guy^^ nice work
---
So an actual nobody on a 3rd rate server with an ego? 
---
Private servers haven't evolved shit. People abuse pots more than ever, but WSG has devolved. Big fish in a tiny pond, not a single premade or guild would have touched the best on Magtheridon back in the day. Especially given how those same people started the stormscale move for the most competitive pvp in TBC. Bunch of mediocre players on private servers with egos that never accomplished shit going around flexing 15 years later. Way to be.
---
Yeah what the fuck is this about?? I almost laughed when o read this thinking about how upset this guy was he had to buy some extra virtual ticket thing he would never use just to get access to the main beta experience
---
Just before Cata hits, anything after Wrath is complete garbage and ruined Wow for me. Been playing private servers for a decade for that reason.
---
No, this totally new and extremely insightful video has brought up points that I’ve never once heard before!
---
stopped after 20 seconds because you couldnt even start neutral.  
---
"small number of retail subscribers who defend it on the wow forums. their game is literally so dead and so boring that they take the time out of their day to give their worthless opinions. \[....\] they spew out of their friendless sharded heads."
---
**so everyone who disagrees with you is a friendless sharded retail subscriber who spews out worthless opinons?**
---
holy fuck i seriouly hope you stop making any more content. youre just as toxic as the people youre trying to condemn.
---
Me and my buds are designing our leveling experience around your spell cleave strategy, any video coming for that?
---
joke i hope
---
How is the classic subreddit a wrong place to ask about classic, what are you on about my man.
---
I appreciate the numbers, but this doesn't pass the smell test. Private servers (supposedly) have the same spell batching delay as the beta but no one complains about batching on private servers.
---
The way I see it, there are two possible scenarios: either spell batching is implemented improperly on the beta, or people are complaining about a problem that doesn't exist. But your argument that internet speeds are faster so we have to reduce the delay doesn't make sense.
---
TBC
---
They also admitted it will be different with today's network infrastructure. We've seen tons of videos from Vanilla and Classic that shows how big of a difference it is.
---
It is working as intended - for 2004 internet with high pings and slow speeds.
---
It's 2019. If we want an authentic experience then it needs to be tuned to how it was executed.
---
Would you rather play an old video game whose framerate was tied to clock cycles back then to play with clock cycles today? Or would you rather the game be tuned so it runs at a proper speed on modern hardware?
---
Same shit. Simply plotting numbers from 1.12 server on today's infrastructure may be exact in case, but it is not authentic in execution.
---
How this shit escapes so many people is beyond me.
---
Out of the loop, what's going on?
---
I interpret this as the hunter class being broken, but why's that?
---
I understand just seems weird that spouse’s can’t play from the same bnet account.
---
Not everyone knows there is a weekly question thread, how about chill.
---
then we flipflop to #changes for wotlk and say no dungeon finder!
---
Cataclysm. Or WotLK.
---
If Gnome Warlock/Mage is okay, then I have a hard time understanding, why this wouldn't be the case for Rogue aswell.
---
That's thin even for an arm
---
you won't regret it at all. Playing a race you don't like just for slight min/maxing edge makes zero [sense. No](https://sense.No) one will care, unlike what this forum would have you believe. Most people are casuals, and not hardcore min/maxers like private server players. Please choose Night Elf. Just keep in mind that Shadowmeld only works out of combat in vanilla, so it's way less useful than in later expansions.
---
Its a Bow snapping and the bow string popping.  
---
I think...
---
What are they gonna do, heal him?
---
yeah exactly! one is the original game, the other is the mmo adaptation. why call wow warcraft, if they are completely different games?
---
all these people downvoting you are going to get dumpstered by hunters when classic comes out and then complain on reddit to nerf hunters i guarantee it
---
More doom and gloom please.
---
Your deadzone remains the same and if anything your melee attacks are now able to hit that mage trying to deadzone you. People don't seem to realize how much damage hunter melee does, in fact with decent gear a hunter is able to melee down warriors with a degree of consistency.
---
Hunters are amazing at whining.
---
- Fastest levelers
---
- Best gold farmers
---
- Great 10sta pvp+pve ZG enchants
---
- Little to no gear competition and gear faster than any other class except maybe Druid
---
- Get a practically free epic weapon in MC
---
- With BIS PvP gear end up with around 6-7k HP
---
- Top tier backline group PvP class. Hunters with their range and stings can often dictate larger fights
---
- Solid solo PvP matchups. Favored vs war+rogue+druid and unfavored vs warlock and priest and on fairly even footing vs the other classes (mage can be hard and paladin depends  alot on the paladin and if scorp pet or not).
---
- Require little raid consumables to pull near optimal DPS
---
Technically yes it does do something against those classes, practically speaking you'd almost never use it for that because it makes no difference to that matchup (of course you'd use it a duel to burn the cd but it doesn't make a difference to the outcome). Hunter sting does very poor damage and has a pet that will keep you in combat or from bandaging anyway, and if a druid is going cat form against you you probably already won (although I guess you can remove the very weak opener dot if for some reason they get an opener on you).
---
Why would Blizzard ever give you something that was in the game they're mimicking and have ALREADY SAID AREN'T BUGS.
---
Blizzard has told you to fuck right off, not me.
---
Are you a moron? This post is completely specific to the Beta, which is very different to pservers. Now only that, you are basing it off getting fucked up while leveling by hunters? God thats the dumbest shit I've read in a while, seriously
---
Well what would you propose?
---
- Taking out flying means remodeling some zones like storm peaks, cause they're built around it
---
- Achievs were a good side goal for a lot of people, asking a bit of effort to gain some titles and have fun filling up that bar, which you didn't have otherwise. The raid part could be taken out and it still would work. 
---
- Rep tabards were a way to get ahead on reputation which allowed you to get some interesting items, patterns for bags, mounts, by doing dungeon, which you would do anyway, it's just a bonus way to gain rep.
---
As for difficulty, what would you then have? A mix of normal and heroic, as one difficulty? What then for people who want more challenge? They get nothing?
---
Now I do agree, you're mentionning what would make YOU stop playing, but WotLK is definitely not about #nochanges like Classic is, so it's interesting to see what could go away and what alternatives there are, that's why I'm debating this
---
How did you come up with that? There's no way the risks will be the same. Seriously work through each step of buying gold from a third party site, and tell me it's exactly the same as just trading gold for gold in the same game. 
---
We don't even know what the official line on this is. It may not even get a ban.
---
It'S JuSt BeTa oP
---
You're asking a technical question about an ongoing beta.  I know this is a discussion forum, but its not official and you aren't likely to get a good response to your question.
---
LFD was hardly used by anybody in WotLK before ICC's patch and its 3 dungeons. I did the daily heroics at least 2 times a week for the whole duration of LK and never used LFD until then, like most people - nor did I use i on my leveling alts. Heroic dungeons being dumbed down was a bigger turn off honestly, but what hurt my soul is how unused gorgeous zones like Zul'Drak ended up.
---
Yes the totem isn't destroyed until the spell lands, so in the case of a projectile it can eat 2 spells. He doesn't outrange the totem, you can see it's gone when he turns around a second later. The behavior on beta is wrong, as should be obvious from reading the grounding totem tooltip
---
ZG is coming out after BWL. Barely anything in there is best in slot compared to that. It's going to be an alt run instance. The enchants are really the only unique thing and the trinkets for main classes.
---
Because it's what Blizzard sees.
---
Character A receives large amount of gold from Character B.
---
That's it.
---
Lets just ignore the massive problem dead servers were during Vanilla. Creating a server transfer system when it was never a planned feature was a huge amount of effort and work. Blizzard dedicated a massive amount of resources to solving the problem. If this existed during the height of the games success, its likely going to be more severe for a remake.
---
This guy clearly did not play during Vanilla nor does he have any understanding of how online games work.
---
Highest level punishes twinks though. 🤬
---
thank you I've been waiting for something like this for months! great work cheers.
---
as long as viper sting works, hunters are gonna be just fineeeeeeee
---
Yeah, I haven't played retail since like 2010 and I have no interesting in what that game is now it's completely different.
---
AQ20 had a lot of stuff for people who could and could not do AQ40. I always felt Naxx needed a 20 man raid companion like the previous tier. It would also be nice to have another dungeon or two as well. 
---
I know a lot of people who quit during Naxxramas because their guild broke up during AQ40 and couldn't really do the next raid. If there were another 20 man raid and other dungeons to explore, then a lot of people might have stayed.
---
Lol your post history is hardly 3 people. Idk what your goal is, but I'd be willing to bet you still play mage even while you're begging others not to.
---
You also can't use stuff like grenades in arenas, but they were allowed for the tourney. People also swapped trinkets when out of combat, also not allowed in duels.  
---
    
---
Your reasoning doesn't fit, the rules are just arbitrary, and a strong case for 'anything goes' can be made.
---
Assuming they keep classic around, I'd just stay in classic. Otherwise I may do TBC, but I'm not sure. I don't like the idea of losing 2 years worth of progress.
---
 Why not reinvent the wheel while your at it
---
yawn
---
You tube is littered with vods that are from 2004. No memory needed.
---
Cata was my favorite. MoP was good, but that’s when I’d probably bail. Would love to replay cata though.
---
I'm not, the Alliance attack before the start of the cataclysm its self.
---
&gt; there isn't going to be any trapping happening because the melee is so far away because of leeway that the melee can literally walk around it, and resume hitting.
---
Not only that, melee can just walk straight through the trap if the spell batching lines up.
---
That's exactly what came to mind as soon as I read "as a level 40..."
---
Of course those can easily be checked (some I believe even automatically). You can't check outside help by other players.
---
I would be okay with TBC and Wrath if they were re-tooled so that they shared the same game play paradigm as Classic.
---
The first green quest rewards that I got has stats that were on par with raid gear and that is bullshit.  I could understand making it the same as Vanilla 300 crafted gear, but making raid gear obsolete almost immediately was horseshit.
---
Word of warning you will spend the majority of your time in pvp OOM unless you downrank, not my cup of tea Shamans are my favorite class in tbc+wrath but they were so broken and unfinished in Vanilla if you don't play Resto you are going to be at a disadvantage.
---
Putting special mounts to farm off bosses works, special armor, making the raids closer to difficulty of hard modes from wotlk, these things help give people bragging rights. 
---
Vanillas entire player currency is vanity. You want people to message you about where you got your bad ass gear or mount, your awesome CD trinket that alters gameplay, your wacky CorAshbringer. The entire games core relies on vanity. The game will either and die slowly with no new content, look at what happened on the beta, interests dwindle and people can excuse make all they like but beta shows the exact amount of time it takes for people to stop being engaged.
---
&gt; Taking out flying means remodeling some zones like storm peaks, cause they're built around it
---
Yep. Seems silly huh?
---
&gt; Rep tabards were a way to get ahead on reputation which allowed you to get some interesting items, patterns for bags, mounts, by doing dungeon, which you would do anyway, it's just a bonus way to gain rep.
---
It just felt hollow. It didnt feel like you were doing something specific to help a faction. You were just doing dungeons and bam, exalted. 
---
&gt; As for difficulty, what would you then have? A mix of normal and heroic, as one difficulty? 
---
Nope. Just a a flat difficulty scale like we had in Vanilla and TBC. 
---
&gt; What then for people who want more challenge? They get nothing?
---
Well, either that... or they could add an LFR version, normal version, heroic version, mythic version, and maybe a mythic+ version for the super tryhards lol. 
---
That's my whole point. In my opinion, Wrath would need a serious overhaul to keep me interested.
---
actually 0 IQ
---
TBH that's not what Cata was hated the most for at the time. WHat happened with Cata is that they brutally changed both gameplay style and classes in a stupid way, along with taking away the soft grinding/skill requirements that most of the normal playerbase loved.
---
HP bars were multiplied by 4 but damage only by two, and all classes were given healing/defensive abilities, slowing down gameplay dramatically. Cost for Arena Team creation/ Double Spec disappeared, and so did arena rating requirements for gear. Warlocks were taking away Soul Shards which they got used to for 5 years for no reason at all. Mana stopped mattering outside of some specific very long fights. Healers suddenly became unkillable in 1v1 PvP, now you had to gang up on them. Etc.
---
Everything past Ulduar is dead to me.
---
Great, you’ve successfully made prot pally a bit more viable as a tank. Now what are you going to give horde to compensate?
---
DKP = Dragon Kill Points, if you were wondering btw.
---
Fucking lol. Epic rebuttal. Thanks for the valiant insight.
---
You are just nitpicking right now.
---
It doesn't matter if i say since WC2 or before BfA, because since as you said KT was basically left alone since WC2 until BfA.
---
And before WC2 it didn't even exist, so obviously but phrases refer to the same intervallum of time between WC2 and BfA....
---
Why dragon killing? Is this a reference to Onyxia being the first raid boss killed?
---
Azeroth is so mountainous
---
At least i have chicken .........
---
where has blizzard said, that scatter+trap dr is not a bug? tbh it's obvious you are completely out of the loop. stop arguing
---
I said that I didnt forget it. It is in the guide.
---
I'm starting at 3 am hoping the dedicated are ahead of me and the more casual players have gone to bed so the starting zone might be doable at least.
---
Oooh now i see it, thanks man.
---
It needs a reference too. Something like
---
&lt; You're mom said, you = dumb nerd
---
Then it's a cold hard fact
---
Scuffed spell batching causes elemental mastery to generate 2 crits if you shock right after a cast btw, this is why he was critting so much
---
Maybe I'm the minority, but special mounts and vanity gear wont keep me playing WoW after Naxx. 
---
I'll keep playing for gear and trinkets that give me an edge -- especially in PvP. But even that'll get boring when I'm rolling around 1shotting new players in blues/greens. 
---
&gt; The game will either and die slowly with no new content...
---
Yep. And I'm ok with that. I'll play Classic and TBC if they offer it and then I'll find something else to do. I dont need a lifelong hobby.
---
Watching Cdew smash mages was great. Too bad I fell asleep not too long after Payo’s last duel.
---
The only problem i see with that is they would have to nerf naxx to have proper progression which would probably piss off alot of people as its classicly the end with the #nochanges people 
---
Reckon it would be good to do this on a classic+ designated realm people could copy their characters over onto it or something.
---
&gt; Flying in bc is unchangeable. I wish it wasn't there, but the expansion doesn't work if it's taken out.
---
What locations in TBC require flying and could not have flying replaced by a convenient tunnel or a set of stairs? The only places that require it only do so because they're isolated from the rest of the map by arbitrary mountains or other features obviously placed there for no other reason except to make the area require flying to reach.
---
Like sure, removing flying from TBC would require changing the maps, but the extent of flying integration into the world design is really just along the lines of "what if we took this otherwise completely normal subzone, and just made it inaccessible?" Think Isle of Dread having arbitrarily steep cliffs around it with no way to reach it on foot.
---
Mind flay is never really good. Low rank, max rank, tons of damage gear - it's just a poor spell. At most you should have 1 in your rotation to slow down a mob from reaching you while levelling.
---
^(and better pvp racials)
---
Honestly I would not be surprised by that. It makes the most sense from their standpoint. Though honestly, as much as I loved BC, I think I would be more interested if they took the classic+ route. I would love to see where they could take vanilla. And then after its run its course or if it doesn't prove to be a big hit, they launch a BC server. I'd love that.  
---
But realistically, the easiest way for them to make more money with as little of effort as possible would be to just releasing each of the old expansions. So I would be content if they go the way they are currently thinking, but would love for them to explore classic+.
---
People follow a certain  set of rules when dueling and if you dont abide by the rules people wont like it. Just follow the rules it's that simple.
---
&gt; Therefore, I propose Blizzard spend more money and time than the entire Classic project.
---
The only reason we're getting Classic is because they discovered it would be cheap to accomplish.
---
Nope, not going to happen.
---
I'm so excited to go back to my regular vendors. I never RPed, but there were my specific repair shops, reagent vendors, etc.
---
I never understood too, but have you ever tried having more than two browser windows? it is way easier to have to on top of each other while the screen is vertical... but I'm just autistic, because I can watch four streams at once and still play wow...

---
As soon as TBC is announced. 
---
The whole point of this experiment should be to try a new path, not just repeat the exact same shit I’ve already experienced.
---
You forgot that Gnomes have an increase in Engineering which is a  required profession for serious PvPers.
---
Citing an imbalance here is not a reason to add another imbalance over there. You simply can’t account for what else a drastic change like that could effect for both pve and pvp and to what degree for each.
---
But locks have retarded pets too
---
&gt;its just the announcement hunters will be great
---
&gt;its just the alpha dont worry they'll fix it
---
&gt;its just just the beta dont worry they'll fix it
---
&gt;the game just launched give them some more time they'll fix it
---
&gt;its just phase 1 they'll fix it now
---
&gt;tbc just launched im sure they'll fix all the pet mob AI bugs they have on BFA this time around with a new wow timeline
---
Give us a set that makes pure Enhancement shaman decent for example.
---
&gt;More likely, they won't do shit until the problem becomes so bad, people just accept WoW tokens into Classic.
---
I agree. More people will be open to trading vanilla gold for retail gold than using third party sites tho. 
---
If they don't do anything about it, then tokens will exist in classic. If only in a round about way at the start.
---
Still waiting on that invite?
---
Why would that not be fair? You played 1 day on your toon and the other has been playing 30 of the last 60 days on the toon. Pretty sure they should have priority even if they made 5 days after the original.
---
I'd edit the Phase 1 mounts as to not have "both discounts." The Rank 3 faction discount will only be available in Phase 2 and can't be taken for granted before then.
---
how would a bit of extra mana regen **compleatly break PVP**?
---
Bugs. I’m going insane waiting. It’s like Christmas when I was 10 except I’ve been waiting for 6months lol
---
Totally agree, but thats why my friends and I who played vanilla are reassembling and making a guild. This will be more than likely are last time playing classic wow so we are going all all!

Its also just fine for dungeons. Especially where you're fighting the undead.
---
&gt; He had no competition on his fresh server runs either.
---
Wouldn't he by definition have more competition on a fresh server where basically everyone is in the starting zones along with him?
---
Settle down sperg.. save some cringe for the rest of us.
---
Ohhhhh okay
---
If they did this there is NO way any streamer would  e able to get their name. How many people would be there right as the flood gate opened to reserve names to snipe Asmongold?
---
&gt; More people will be open to trading vanilla gold for retail gold than using third party sites tho.
---
No they won't. If there's no difference in risk, it will be much easier and cheaper to buy from 3rd party sites.
---
Absolutely chill. No emotion, no name calling. Not sure how much more chill someone can be. 
---
On the other hand telling someone to chill is condescend, it is something you would tell an out of control child. Pls respect others even on the interwebz.
---
Hunters don’t prioritize a 2h melee while levelling
---
They rarely level weapon skill while levelling
---
Best gold farmer? Lmao
---
You don’t know hunter friendo
---
Sure that isnt just gouge damage?
---
Won't the just do "TBC classic" instead? Seems easier.
---
It's decent. It's not *great* because it's fairly easy to dispel and has a 30sec cd. Probably the best use of it is in bgs you can fear ward a lot of your team in the start gate and having the team roll out with fear ward on is a really nice boost to everyone. In duels priests will just dispel it, but you will get some use out of it vs warlocks.
---
r/outoftheloop
---
What happened?
---
Dad?
---
&gt; Get a practically free epic weapon in MC
---
Rohk won't be in the game until phase 2 (its a 1.5 quest that uses the world bosses) meaning by the time it comes out you'll want the xbow from BWL.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Jfc this sub sometimes
---
I'd appriciate if you give it a rating on wowhead if you enjoyed it!
---
If you can powershift instantly, then you can cast while mounted. You would need to make a macro to dismount and then cast, just like you would need to make a macro to powershift. It is a bug.
---
Cant be! This is a map from the movie. Way earlier.
---
Lol touche, but that's not really a "melee hunter"
---
Wow. That sucks. Leeway feels so off.
---
Looks like a great resource if enough people start using it. Currently it needs help with Warrior, Warlock, and Hunter, but I’m sure it will balance out in time. I will definitely keep an eye on it.
---
&gt; Give us our PvP mechanics, it's why thousands of hunters love Vanilla for how it is.
---
Don't you mean private servers? Cause every mechanic you described lines up with my memories of what Vanilla was actually like.
---
Enhancement doesn't have any good physical abilities, their only one has a 30 second cooldown.
---
Elemental shaman does nature damage which isn't affected by warlock curses
---
Balance druid just simply outputs less damage than mage/warlocks.
---
Prot paladin has no taunt and terrible itemization
---
Ret paladin has various issues like no proper abilities and being a 2hand class (which is naturally a weakness except if you are horde and can do something to proc windfury). 
---
Hunters don't have mana issues at all.
---
Give any of these classes infinite mana and they would still do shit dps.
---
"Viable" when you have other people carrying you. When you're in a progression guild, that shit ain't gonna cut it passed MC.
---
I remember doing my Pally epic mount quest and the Scholo part ended up being so.. weird.
---
Ended up grouping with a Warlock doing his mount quest at the same time. Also we couldn't find a tank.. So our group ended up being like: Holy Paladin, Warlock, Shadow Priest, Hunter, Rogue. I was healing with the Hunter and Warlock tag team pet tanking.
---
That's very true, I haven't even thought of that! I'll make sure to add this later.
---
This, exactly this!
---
Zangarmarsh is one of my favorite zones from an aesthetic point of view. The art team at Blizzard was probably tripping balls on shrooms when they create the zone! 
---
I also disliked the new races in TBC.
---
One of my dreams for Classic is to at least attempt a world boss. I never really made it far enough in Vanilla to warrant an attempt, and they honestly just sound like great fun (even if rewards are meh)
---
Not sure if anyone said this but the chances of popular names being on an unplayed alt are less likely. I mean you can’t choose which toon they are going to ask you to rename. 
---
Honestly the only solution is to announce exactly when they will merge, announce there will be a race to rename should you have a conflicting name, and the fastest to log in and change their name back to their original name gets to keep it. Seems fair to me ;)
---
Shadow priest does great damage and would probably be perfectly viable with better Mana Regen or lower Mana costs.
---
LMFAO at who says '' Hunters are fine '' fucking sad
---
I think too a lot of people are thinking they'll be Angwe 2.0 when really they'll just end up as someone's source of easy kills.
---
I don't even plan too. I'm saying why give a system that has the potential for abuse any ground when /ignore works the exact fuckin same for you
---
I watched one video from this guy where he legit cried about how sjws and such ruined wow.  Sounded like a giant bozo.
---
That will be because LFD only came out with icecrown patch 3.3.
---
they removed it for beta only, its back on the menu: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/please-reinstate-or-give-alternative-to-right-click-report/208582/27
---
&gt;melee attacks are now able to hit that mage trying to deadzone you
---
Leeway isn't applied when slowed or immobilized. Strike one.
---
&gt;Fastest levelers
---
Mages. Strike two.
---
&gt;Best gold farmers
---
Mages. Strike 3, you're out!
---
I don’t think it’s just that. It’s mostly the fact that leeway feels so weird and many of us who played vanilla feel it’s off
---
Humans inc.
---
The argument is that shadow priest go oom fast as well, so why are they excluded?
---
I guess Survival should be explored more in Classic, I know I will be testing as some of the talents could help counter these issues...should be interesting to see what gets rolled out to live servers.
---
why did you keep repairing if you were going to keep dying?
---
LFD didn't exist until ICC's patch.
---
I think it would be incredibly fun TBH to implement such a thing, It's just how could they possibly think of going that direction. I would absolutely love being more reclusive on a night elf race.
---
If we are speaking from a "completely change the game for the sake of improving and ignore everything beyond vanilla" i'd probably be up for it
---
ya that's actually true
---
Agreed. OP isn’t talking about changing damage numbers, just rotation longevity.
---
&gt; scatter and trap
---
wont work in classic, they share DR.
---
Inevitable: For *what*.    
---
People talk about humans because they assume PvE/Raids/level 63 boss. For PvP Night Elf and arguably Gnomes have a place.
---
No. Are you kidding me? People aren't going to be as willing to buy from a sketchy third party site as they are to just trade in game currency. Maybe a few people will buy lots of gold from Chinese sites, but less people are going to do it.
---
If they announce BC I'm out. Unpopular opinion but BC is what started the path that retail wow is on now. Flying and Dailies completely ruined the feel of the game for me and it started to feel like a job. If I want to farm for 9 hours to get rep let me do that, but if I have to log in to do the same exact missions for 30 days strait i'd rather you tickle my prostate with a cactus.
---
In order to "keep cheating" I would have to be cheating in the first place.
---
While we raided in vanilla we used world buffs (mostly DM/Felwood and a dragon head if we had one at hand and it was not already up) for the "this is it" try of the evening on a particularly annoying boss. 
---
We didn't constantly raid with those on because it would've been too much of an hassle and not worth it. Remember on legit servers you can't get a dragon kill buff more than once every 6 hours (I think the same goes for hakkar heart) so you stack what you can when you need it, to get the extra oomph.
---
I remember people stacking the everliving shit out of everything, mostly to make 1337 videos like Decimator Patchwerk video. 
---
Nobody thought they were "cheating" back then.
---
They are perfectly in line with the vanilla spirit. You can use everything that's in the game to defeat the game, as long as you're willing to put in the work.
---
Farming Felwood shit takes hours. Running a raid through DM North takes time. If you're willing to put the time in you get advantages out of it.
---
Same as the amount of consumables you can stack. Food, elixirs, Scrolls, blasted lands shit, everything goes.
---
It makes raids easier? That's the whole point. That's the whole classic spirit. Don't like it? Go play retail.
---
Should be fine. If your memory is 1x8gb stick then throwing in another 8 gigs of memory wouldn't hurt. Even if its 2x4 I'd nearly consider replacing them with 2x8 and try to sell the 2x4 on to someone else.
---
It's clearly a joke to poke at him. Smh at some of you guys
---
Depending on how the release of BC impacts the population of the classic realms, I might jump out once BC is re-released. I only want 1-60.
---
Yeah I rolled a warrior in vanilla and he was my only toon. I didnt know any better how hard leveling a warrior would be. Just face tanked my way to 60.
---
Well you're simply selfish and have no regard for other people.
---
Careful with that edge kid..
---
8 *yards* away.
---
Y'know, really drive that absurdity home.
---
One of my PCs has hardware entirely from ~2011 and can run the Classic Beta completely maxed out @ 1080p/60. Admittedly there are no raids to test but even during huge events with the community with way more than 40 players and all sorts of spells going off it doesn't struggle at all.
---
The build you listed blows that computer away by orders of magnitude.
---
Because it takes a long time to make and i dont want to spend that much time on randoms for a random bg. Not worth it.
---
I’ll probably play till the end of Wotlk if they continue like that. I was 12 when Wotlk released and I had only started raiding by the end of the expansion. With classic coming out I can experience al the raids I wanted to do when I was younger.
---
you're acting incredibly pretentious, and also assuming that 1.12 had no bugs.
---
scatter+trap didn't trigger DR prior to 1.10, nor after 2.0. it was a bug from 1.10 when trap was added to the DR table. the purpose of the DR table is to prevent the same effect from being continuously applied to a player. does it really make sense to you that a freezing effect (trap) and disorient effect (scatter) trigger diminishing returns on eachother? 
---
there is a reason why this was fixed in the next patch (2.0) and players are complaining about it now. quit acting like such a cock
---
Hey, group of my real life friends and I are recruiting for Classic wow! We played back in the day and we would love to have you join! were just starting to recruit for raids/bgs/guild events, ect... your more than welcome to register! As we get closer to release date, discord will be starting to ramp up! msg me if your interested!! [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowclassicguilds/comments/c96fre/auspvp\_just\_that\_simple\_recruiting\_for\_classic\_wow/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_sourc](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowclassicguilds/comments/c96fre/auspvp_just_that_simple_recruiting_for_classic_wow/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_sourc)
---
r/lostredditors
---
&gt; also assuming that 1.12 had no bugs
---
I'm not assuming that. I'm just accepting that we're getting 1.12, warts and all.
---
You should too.
---
Doesn't the Tauren's new melee range with leeway put them out of range of certain ground-targeted AoE abilities?
---
You can deduct your mortgage from your taxes as well
---
Yeah, they did.
---
Same as most of the stuff he listed is exactly blizzlike/\#nochanges.
---
That comment is ridiculous.
---
&gt; Yes, if the hunter is standing still or is slowed by 30% or more
---
Or the Hunter can just backpedal
---
Ah shit.
---
In the Retail planet.
---
Yeah, this is the one area I’m not buying blizz’s data
---
Too many vids from actual vanilla disprove this leeway stuff
---
That was in Wrath. Harrison Jones first showed up (I think) at Zul’Aman in TBC, but Dun Da Dun Daaah! was in Grizzly Hills. 
---
Still a bit salty over how many times he got himself killed aggroing avoidable trolls. “Get rescued by Harrison Jones” my ass; he would have died on the first pack if I hadn’t pulled the entire cave off him.
---
And we still don't know what the Moonkin Form hitbox is.
---
More money? They already have textures and character models made. What makes you think it would cost so much money?
---
Also, they made classic because they released there is demand for it.
---
Individuals run scams FAR more often than companies with a reputation to uphold.
---
Your age is irrelevant right now. The problem is that you own 20-year-old underwear.
---
Lots of people had decent internet and/or lived close to the servers back in the day. And the vanilla community constantly whined and demanded changes. Yet as far as anyone can recall, whining about tauren warrior melee range was never a thing.
---
I meant they could hire more GM so that they can investigate report before banning someone instead of having an automated system that do it right away and is easily abusable.
---
Never played an MMO before, was 12 years old, and wasn’t sure my parents were going to let my brothers and i subscribe after the trial so i just wanted to go see the world i guess (mom ended up getting into the game too, though 😂)
---
The fact that Mr. Octopus is bigger than SW itself.. Holy cow, what boss is that?
---
Ya but we can abuse them and they dont get to run away.
---
Oh are you just copy pasting this everywhere?
---
Leveling is fun! I absolutely love it! But doing it fast is something i like aswell.
---
You know a lot of the 1.12 bugs and exploits are patched for classic because they are using legion client... so your point is moot? Are you saying we need blizz to implement and recreate each and every bug/exploit that was in the game?
---
They said that itemization will be 1.12 but that loot tables will be 1.3 (its why stratholme xbow isn't on pre-bis lists) Rhok'delar was added the same patch that that xbow was added. They never specifically mention rhok, but I don't think they would call out a specific item like that.
---
Cataclysm.
---
That expansion was balls compared to the previous 3, and ultimately what ruined WoW.  
---
Like I've said in another thread, "Cataclysm did the most damage to WoW, and WoD was simply boring enough to make me realize it."  
---
There's always a change of leaving sooner if an amazing game comes out, but let's be real....
---
Not him but dor me it totally ruins the immersion and the connection with the identity of you character.
---
Back then it meant something when you were a *frost mage* and it was part of your character. It took significant resources to switch. And each spec had its own flavour.
---
With dual spec, you're just a mage. And suddenly, you know everything and just switch whenever the game requires it. You're also often doing it for the game reasons, not for the in-world reasons.
---
It's weird because I think I didn't explain it properly :(
---
Hunters are the fastest levelers though.
---
Added!
---
See now that argument just doesn't work. I \*have\* to understand your point of view? I'm not allowed to have my own, only your interpretation is correct?  
---
In a tournament setting like this one, the ecosystem is shattered as artificial limitations are imposed which benefit and disadvantage different classes in different ways. A "no thistle tea" rule can mean the difference between victory and defeat, same goes for trinket swapping, mana/health potions, big cooldowns etc. These arbitrary rules are enforced by whatever authority figure is in charge.  
---
If we're talking just dueling in general, then anything goes - nothing but maybe some misplaced pride in an immature person would be at risk, there is nothing lost and nothing gained. The only rule is that whoever makes the opponent reach 1 hp the fastest is the winner. This rule is enforced by the mechanics of the game.  
---
In world pvp it's the same thing, however more is at stake like time lost to a corpserun and failure to obtain honor that could have been gained through winning. The only rules are the ones enforced by the mechanics of the game.  
---
There's not really anything more to it. Why practice a losing strategy by introducing arbitrary rules? xD
---
Added it!
---
Why are you acting like Vanilla raids are hard?
---
I would celebrate a Warcraft Series on Netflix so much. There is tons of story they would make billions of dollars they just need to explain the story better and not like they did in the movie. 
---
The story in the movie was telled disastrously they literally began right in the middle of the story and ended the movie with a rough cliffhanger. Non Warcraft fans which knew nothing about the background story were marooned with lots of unsettled issues.
---
I hope there will be a better movie/series in the future!
---
Play in first person in game and Irl
---
Fixed the BoU text!
---
Also with mobs having abilities they don’t have on private as well as using them on conditions rather than on cooldown.
---
I agree, I was expecting to see a lot of alliance players that I've seen in other peoples streams. However they made a rule that they had to be streaming, I guess so they can watch that everything is above board?
---
Wonder why Monkeynews wasn't invited? He streams
---
&gt; So was wall climbing, yet they fixed it. 
---
Nope, that was a byproduct of using the new engine. It required no work or consideration from Blizzard.
---
Respectfully disagree.
---
PvP advancement separated from PvE advancement.
---
Me too man! We still get sick gear up to tier 2 which is just enough to solo damn near everything and optimize that gold/hour for an alt of your choosing.
---
BESIDES. 
---
I can't remember the last expansion where I raided with 1 character the entire time through. Just when the hunter is starting to become plateaued, in comes my warrior. Problem solved and now the amount of stuff I can do in game has doubled.
---
True, Cata was good before they nerfed the heroics in it. It's amazing how much they destroyed the game in Cata simply for accessibility. CRZ, LFR, nerfed heroics....makes me quite frustrated just thinking about it; the beginning of the end, even if I liked MoP a bit.
---
Who wants 10y leeway?
---
You dont seem to understand the part about systems that were put in place to deal with 2005 issues that are no longer needed.
---
Its not needed, the problem it was fixing doesnt exist in 2019.
---
Keeping it in is against no changes, because it changes how the game played from the original version.
---
Im not really sure why everyone doesnt get it, but its fucking stupid stabbing air and hitting a guy about 8 character model lengths away in PVP. Dragon hit boxes are huge for reasons, but it looks and plays stupid as fuck in PVP.
---
Jesus, thank you I keep forgetting that phase 2 doesn't have a raid. So you'll get it phase 2 and use it until BWL.
---
Why are you assuming there's less risk. What are you talking about. Again and again and again I will say we don't know what blizzard stance is on this yet.
---
Whirlwind had an 8yard range while melee is 5yard
---
From my point of view the Jedi are evil.
---
Why is it an issue if it is imbalanced? Lots of things about classic were imbalanced and that added to the game imo. It made each faction actually unique, and helped fuel the rivalry between them. As long as the imbalance doesn't reach a point where people are actively picking one side over the other because of a clear imbalance. I don't think making Pallies a more viable tank would do that.
---
Enjoy playing your gimped version of classic wow where player movement is DRASTICALLY different than the original.
---
hmm weird, last time i checked layering, auto loot and right click reporting weren't in the game in 2006. do you have a source for your claim?
---
Idk about you, but I don't remember the game feeling clunky. All these mechanics - including the crazy long spell batching, just makes the game feel clunky. Back then, this amount of clunk wasn't noticeable. Nowadays, it is. I really want to play classic because I think it's a fun game, but why add unnecessary clunkiness to it when it could be smoother. 
---
I don't see why anyone would want their game to feel unresponsive and laggy. I haven't played the beta tbf, but just watching streams, even simple things like vendoring items seems laggy. Just.. why?
---
Yeah. It was only good for established fans because of fanservice, but even for established fans it was lacking in a lot of aspects.
---
 I'm glad it happened but I'm pretty disappointed with what will probably be the only cinematic Warcraft adaptation when all is said and done.
---
Stamina?
---
Is there a bracket ? Who won? I'm on a fishing boat in Alaska can't watch any vids with slow satellite internet
---
Thx
---
Spoken like someone who’s never done a Mythic Raid.
---
Go do Mythic Dazar’alor and say that.
---
Nah let's get started on the BFA route with giving everyone everything.... I'd love if people like OP would just keep their opinions to themselves......
---
Just layer jump like everyone else was going to anyways lol.
---
&gt; The one (and pretty much only) advantage tauren hunters get from the larger model is that it’s harder for mages to sit in their deadzone and nova them.
---
They also can get healed from +2.6 yards further than Hunters of other classes, which is pretty handy. One of the only "one-sided" differences between the races.
---
Logging out to preserve buffs is shady.   Exploiting the song flower to buff the whole raid is especially shady.  
---
You are cheating.  Fact.
---
I feel you have been living under a rock. Mages are able to hit 60 under 3 days played from launch.
---
That is next level of stupid indeed. WOW priest? Is that a thing? Are you talking about Preach?
---
I'm going to school to be an accountant, so I think I'll be safe too.
---
Some of the obvious higher level stuff:
---
- Black Lotus
---
- Arcane Crystals
---
- Felcloth
---
- Devilsaur Leather (longer payoff for this)
---
- Righteous Orbs
---
- Azerothian Diamonds
---
- Deeprock Salt
---
Some Thorium Brotherhood rep specific stuff that can be sold/saved for later:
---
- Dark Iron Residue
---
- Incendosaur Scale
---
And if you have any intention of going through Hillsbrad for levelling; Turtle Meat. Trust me.
---
That doesn't seem right to me. If potions and such were "only" considered bad manners, I'd still do it since there were money up for grabs, but I didn't see ANYONE do it. To me it's like saying juggling in a fighting game tournament with prize money is bad manners. Literally noone would follow such a social convention "just because".
---
my favourite build on private servers is maxed out spell power on an ele shaman for shit like this. most of the time all it takes is elemental mastery with chain lightning and a frost shock to kill someone
---
I don't think I'll even make it to TBC. 
---
Once a decent % of players reach AQ40/Naxx gear, anyone that doesn't also raid becomes irrelevant in PVP. I think we will see most of the casual/pvp players leave around this time - they just can't compete against the item level difference. 
---
I will raid and get gear, don't get me wrong. But I'm not interested in clearing BWL/AQ40/Naxx every reset. I just want to PVP.  I'll be protecting lowbies from gankers, not farming consumables. I'll be PvP spec, and not eating respec costs. I'll be rank 10 with MC/BWL loot, and when that's no longer viable, I'll get bored. 
---
I think this is why FRESH is always so popular. I hope the phases are timed well so we get to enjoy the fun stuff for longer. 
---
I'd probably return to play TBC after.
---
Uhh yes because these have been the rules in world of warcraft from the beginning of the game. 
---
Almost everyone  follows them and if you dont no one will take you seriously in pvp because you will be considered a cheater.
---
There's just no argument that Blizzard will treat gold trading any different than gold selling. They restricted and banned gold trading between realms too. So whatever the risk from Blizzard is, it will be the same.
---
Which means you're much better off going with a known company than an individual.
---
also apparently people forget everything over 15 years, TIL. Fuck, that means doctors should retire after 15 years of practice!
---
I don't see how you can say that. Do you think ostlers magically became car mechanics?
---
People always say this but there's always going to be that one mage ahead of the pack. Jokerd was even late to the latest FRESH experience and got past the pack and set a new record.
---
... I miss sitting. On my human paladin, when I was a shit-geared ret paladin ... next to my grandmother's epic geared male Tauren Elemental Shaman ... fishing with my Nat Pagle's fishing pole ... on the coast of Darkshore, staring at the sunset.
---
It was a PvP server. Warrior charges. War-stomp. Shock-Stomp-Chain, Auto-Crit, Grounding Totem, Grenade, Lightning bolt, Tidal-Charm, Lightning Bolt, Shock-Boom. /kek
---
Warrior sends me a tell, calls me an Alliance traitor. /topkek
---
My grandma wooped my ass at PvP, both on her Night-Elf Hunter, and her elemental shaman, 'cause I was a kid in Classic.
---
RIP Grandma, July 2012. Nathrezim PvP.
---
Winning is winning. If drinking is a winning strat then how are you a lil bitch?
---
I’m not sure I found but I’m almost 35. I was too addicted to Ultima Online when WoW came out so I quit around level 40. Looking forward to making it right this time.
---
Maybe you're right that the match up will still be favourable, but you gotta admit, 2.5 extra yards is significant. In any case.
---
The matchups (and circumstances) that would be close without it will be against the hunter now.
---
While arguably lots of modern wows faults were introduced in Wrath, I felt like they were honest attempts to fix problems from TBC. 
---
I may be wrong, but I feel that most original wow players have a “pre cataclysm” view to the golden age of the game. It was a fantastic 5 year run.
---
This is why I’m stuck between mage, warlock, and rogue. Mage and rogue are far more popular, and all three excel in all 3 categories.
---
Traitor scum! 🤓
---
&gt; Reckon it would be good to do this on a classic+ designated realm people could copy their characters over onto it or something
---
Any new content should be on new realms. But I do love the idea of a decade or more of new Vanilla-like expansion content a lot more than just getting TBC, then Wrath, then a dead end.
---
No, but if you just work a job without keeping an ear to the ground about shifts and changes to the industry or competing industries so that you can plan ahead, then it's your fault.
---
When self-driving trucks become the standard, anyone caught without a viable career path will have no one to blame but themselves. The writing's on the wall.
---
&gt;Which means you're much better off going with a known company than an individual.
---
No. You aren't. The punishment for trading gold access servers is a slap on the wrist to what happened when you buy and sell from third parties. 
---
Fewer people will take that risk.
---
Yeah same with Paladin, that's what gave me the thought to post it here.
---
I'm an old fart, and yes I will be telling the raid I'm going AFK to get get some fiber.
---
That's not a solution. Perma flag is certainly the worst thing you can do on a PvE server, as you'll end up being engaged only when your ennemy is sure to win by outnumbering you or attacking when pulling a mob or two. And it completely misses to point of meeting *like-minded players.* I want to meet people who will enjoy being killed in wPvP, not snowflakes who think dying is "wasting your game time" and want a protection from it, or whatever is the excuse (unless you simply don't like PvP, but if you don't, you won't stay long on Classic since content is rather limited).  
---
 I like it when the rules are tough and to survive, you have to be tougher.
---
This is just sorting out the shitty hunters.
---
The maximum melee range of a male tauren with melee leeway is 9.61 yards. Both 8 and 10 yards spells and AoEs such as nova would still be in range with their respective spell leeway, so that doesn't change anything. The tauren deadzone is also pushed from 11 yards to 13.5 yards, so again that doesn't change anything for a warrior.
---
People keep talking about this supposedly HUGE tauren advantage but it doesn't seem like anyone is able to provide an exemple. Besides, it's really [not as much of an increase](https://i.imgur.com/FAR2PQJ.jpg) as most people seem to imagine. But you can't stop the reddit hivemind from spreading nonsense when it's trendy.
---
Don't make a hunter. I'm serious. I'm trying all that I can to get my message across to Blizzard and it just seems like we're fucked. Melee leeway, scatter trap sleep DR, people being able to run over our traps without activating, trap activation lag, we're just screwed. It actually makes me so sad :(
---
The problem is that the list is not prioritised at all. Some of the bugs are huge. And some nearly irrelevant. And they are just mixed together randomly.
---
So when players that are not THAT interested in hunter (like u/EveClassic) skims the list, sees nearly irrelevant bugs being listed, we write hunters off as nitpicking crybabies.
---
Combine that with the most recent weirdness of private server hunters WANTING private server behaviour for some abilities, NOT original wow behaviour, and you have the reason for this perception that hunters are crybabies.
---
Well, and there's probably still some leftover hate from our memories from the original huntards in 2004, where 80% of hunters were literal huntards.
---
&gt; You can certainly construe songflower and getting WCB on alliance as shady.
---
Construe?  ROFL  God damn, you are too far gone.  Not an ounce of intellectual honesty.
---
Feelsfuckingbadman...was really stoked for classic but that flame has completely burnt out. Haven't played WoW in 9+ years so I can wait for them to fix the game or not play at all, simple as.
---
nope still fucked, just watch hunter streamers
---
This level of roleplay...
---
cuz it procs on 2 spells?
---
I believe it's spell batching and melee leeway that people are mad about. Basically people can play inside the hunters dead zone very easily (leeway) and if you're moving quickly enough you can avoid traps you shouldn't be able to avoid (spell batching)
---
I’d skip Wrath, play Cata until DS, then play all of MoP.
---
Don't feel bad for alliance tbh
---
TBC was peak WoW and I would play the hell out of it.
---
WotLK... well, Tier 7 was so easy that it didn't hold my interest. Heroic mode in TBC meant something, it was genuinely difficult. Heroic mode in WotLK was still faceroll easy. I quit before Tier 8 was a thing, but apparently that was better designed and more challenging, so maybe I would hold my nose and stick it out until then.
---
Looked small until I watched a few streamers run from one end of a zone to the other. Then I was reminded how massive this world really was. Incredible that it seems so large in scale even 15 years later.
---
Shaman population just went up with Cdew's win. I for one have new opinion on shaman.
---
Cool so now we move the goal posts to some arbitrate number instead of time to level. :)
---
There's multiple aoe grinding spots, at some times you don't even 
---
aoe grind but quest. A task mages are also very good at.
---
Why would every layer be contested, you make it out like every layer will have 3000 mages all at a specific grindspot lol.
---
Cool man wish I could watched! I'm up here for work for another month so no vids for me, just text. But I'll be back home just in time for classic launch :)
---
So what you're saying is we need TBC?
---
Sorry, I haven't seen anyone testing that, from the streams I've watched. But I would assume they do get healed from further away.
---
You better believe it.
---
Happens to everything when it goes mainstream enough unfortunately.
---
I'm referring to women ;)
---
Which claim? Also, are you absolutely retarded? Are you saying that melee leeway has anything to do with layering? Auto loot? Right click reporting? What is wrong with you?
---
&gt;Their DPS is fantastic until AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad news bro, but that's like, more than half of the encounters in vanilla.
---
It's not supposed to be able to do that. it didn't work that way in vanilla
---
It was cheesy as hell and didn't escape the 'video game movie' thing. That said, I enjoyed it as a prior player and it did awesome in China, so I feel like there was room for a sequel.
---
If you think mages wont be able to hit sub 3 days 60 when Classic launches I have bad news for you..
---
What about joana?
---
It's exactly 100% identical. Because it's been checked against the original.
---
His point is this is Classic WoW, and not Classic WoW enhanced. Everyone who keeps coming up with these ideas for changes is going to get these responses because we don't want changes. 
---
Vanilla WoW was the best version of WoW for the majority of us. We just want to enjoy the game we enjoyed so much before, and everyone who wants to "improve" the mechanics is trying to take that from us.
---
I don't want to play your version of classic WoW, I want to play the game I fell in love with years ago that was taken from me change by change until it as unrecognizable. 
---
I don't know why people keep posting ideas to change mechanics here anyways. It not like you posting the idea here is going to get the change put into the game. I highly doubt anyone but some PR intern pays any attention to this sub. And most people here are adamantly against any change so why do you think people are suddenly going to want the change you suggested.
---
There are videos from TBC of tauren meleeing people through arena pillars.
---
Joana himself thinks mages will be the fastest.
---
32 here. I originally had the week off and was hoping to hit 40 or so to get a nice head start on my leveling but then I had to go and get a new job in a couple of weeks and won't have any time banked up to use. 
---
Seriously debated passing on the job because of the couple of vacations that I had planned(one being for classic) but they are letting me take the important one with my wife at the end of the month.. plus being responsible and everything so ugh. 
---
I'll just have to eat into my sleep time pretty hard the first week.
---
Raising dot limitations totally breaks pvp! Watch out guys!
---
I will not start before the weekend of September 6th.
---
I’m having a hard time choosing between nelf hunter and dwarf rogue, but I’m more leaning towards the rogue cause stealth in vanilla is too valuable
---
I asked myself what am I doing and quit wow for 2 years in the spot. Joke's on you, brain, classic is better than wod!
---
PepeLaugh
---
So you're saying that NOT CHANGING how leeway works, is changing the game?
---
Your solution for how to keep NO CHANGES, is to CHANGE the game? Is that correct?
---
Lol it wasn’t a joke, you’re just saying it is as a defense mechanism against negative feedback.
---
I dont, this is lvl 40 meta PvP. If anyone takes any of these tournaments for anything other than twink meta or a fun way to pass time they dont quite understand the game. This will change drastically at 60.
---
No, it doesn't. I think some addons did.
---
Complexity and strategy... all I remember is a mage polymorphing and drinking whenever his mana ended... repeat... repeat... repeat... no interaction gameplay, boring as fuck. Every competition has rules. Even ancient wrestling had "no biting and no attacks on eyes". And NO, it doesn't simulate real fighting, on the contrary, in normal WoW zone its nearly impossible to do that, by trying to kite such absurd distances you will eventually aggro some mob that will destroy your whole strategy and you will die. Only in such artificially empty areas like Caverns of Time its possible.
---
Easier solution is 
---
Step1. Switch over to 2.0 talent trees 
---
Step2 release 1-2 new filler raids for the other specs.  
---
Because 2.0 talents with only 51 Pts. 
---
 creates a few more valid builds. And more combos becomes viable.  
---
Tankadin/retardin/Balance all becomes viable.  
---
This shakes the meta and a few more instances that cater gear for the other roles of the classes.   Dps warrior set etc.  
---
I don’t mind adding more gear in aq20-&gt; aq40 Level and a future nax level raid.  
---
With 8pieces gears you could be creative with set bonus on gears to cater different specs.
---
I wish there were more side-grades, like sets that make other specs viable.
---
On a recently launched pserver a mage hit 60 in 2 days and 20 hours and that server had insane dynamic respawns. I will be extremely surprised if anyone hits 60 in under 3 days
---
Male undead casting animations for sure!
---
Least favorite probably female tauren
---
Exactly. The map shows where Kul Tiras used to be before Cataclysm.
---
Thank you for this! I have been trying to google image all of the mounts and my results have been pretty bad. Appreciate you putting everything in one place!
---
Love how you used these four words in the same phrase: "humans", "responsibly", "common sense".
---
I agree but this might still encourage people to consider and look up shaman more and realize that it is really strong at 60, too.
---
I'd argue that by today's standard, no one understood the game back then. You're probably right though :D
---
RemindMe! 2 Months
---
They're not mixed together randomly, but rather in the order that they're found. I've thought about putting priority colors or something but overall the things on there would be the same. I already know blizzard is looking at it, so I'd imagine outside of maybe some things that aren't bugged, they intend to work through everything no matter the severity.  
---
I do agree for someone never looking before though that it's really just a list. Which is the point I guess, not to really go "Oh its THIS ONE THING" that is bad, but collectively many things.
---
It will run 3 at the same time, maybe 4. You're good.

---
Bold move, going with Darnassus. I'm sure only a handful of people know exactly where this picture is taken.
---
Well do you think getting your whole raid through ubrs to mind control a priest and give a 83 Fire Resist buff so your whole raid can kill Rag or Vael is also "shady"? 
---
This is quite similar to snagging song flower or WCB for your raid right?
---
Blizzard has said getting the ubrs buff is a "clever use of game mechanics". Not an exploit. So unless you think that is also "intellectual dishonesty" then maybe this is just not the game for you.
---
Your qualification metric for an exploit is apparently doing "shady" things. Its very unclear what is "shady" and whats not. I dont think that is very "intellectual" at all.
---
2days 17h actually. Also you have to remember that Classic will have dynamic respawns too. Some people seem to think that's a feature only on other servers.
---
They have tons of issues in the Beta right now.
---
Trap and Scatter Shot share the same DR. Deadzone actually goes to 11 yrds instead of 8 yrds (and NO, for all the fuckwits saying this is Tauren only, it applies to all races. It's even worse for Tauren though, their deadzone goes to 14 yrds). Melee leeway is a thing now too, so other other classes can hit you from 8 yrds away (or longer if they're Tauren.
---
So you need to be farther away from people to shoot them. And farther away to kite them. And Rogues can CS/Sap you even when you stand directly on top of a flare. And anyone with a movespeed buff can just sprint over your trap and not trigger it due to the 400 ms server heartbeat. 
---
Add on to the fact that your pet is now an autistic spastic and rarely listens to your commands. So yea, Hunters are fucked right now.
---
I hope it's either classic+ or nothing. I quit when TBC came out.
---
The only meta I remember is the one that existed 13 years ago. I'm not averse to making balance tweaks. Especially if it's to buff the Class I've decided to main! But it I don't consider that likely until a good while after launch and people are less afraid of the notion of changes.
---
Like I said, you can’t compare a 500k house to a standard apartment. If you’re applying for loans for a 500k house but only make enough for a much more modest home’s monthly payments, of course they will require a higher down payment. If you’re saying that 100k is a risk, why even mention 500k homes? There are many homes that cost far less in Germany. This may require you to move out of your neighborhood into a cheaper area. Credit alone does not dictate how much they require you put down. Trying to argue that renting is better because you can’t afford a 500k home for your first house is absurd no matter where you’re from.
---
Can you cite the source for the number of shaman players that will be playing classic for sure in 2 months? I'm excited to see the data and where it is from!
---
and the confirmation that scatter shot and freezing trap share dr
---
There are a lot of people out there that are hoping for the same thing. Personally I wouldn't mind for this franchise to split in an entirely different direction from all the expansions/retail. I know it would seem weird and slightly awkward at first, but I would fully enjoy having expansions come out after years of Classic that are "Classic-oriented." They would keep the same feel of community, never introduce flying mounts, and maybe balance classes *just a tad* (I will certainly get burned for this).
---
And so enough said, we don’t need them working on new content.
---
&gt;You just said you had no idea what Blizzard's stance is/was and now you're claiming to know?
---
What? Current servers. Not classic to retail. 
---
&gt;I'm done with this conversation. I won't be seeing anymore of your messages
---
Excellent.
---
I see, I had no idea. Hmm I was going to level a hunter but it was just to be a gold farmer. I might  go to plan B now and go with a frost mage.
---
Thanks for the explanation mate.
---
How I and my guildies experienced vanilla: We just ignored people if required, if they'd end up in a group with any of the guild members, they got an instant kick. And guilds back than talked with each other. So if you really ended up on multiple ignore lists, you basically had to start over with a new character or server transfer. 
---
The report system was only used to report gold/account sellers. 
---
Or actual bugs and breaks...
---
The game had 3 classes. Healer, melee and caster. Zero difference between classes, just take a look at melee classes.  Every melee got their interrupt, short cd stun, gapcloser, ohshit defskill button and wtfburst button.
---
This.
---
Only those not prepared for the class call...
---
What if the other guy has kids and can't play as much? Whoever came up with the name first and registers it should get it imo.
---
Definitely not as bad as people say. Most times you get ganked, they move immediately. Or if they're questing in the area, give them a minute to finish. Out of thousands of hours in vanilla I only got camped like 3 times, I went to do something else for 10 minutes each time and they were gone. No big deal, and definitely way more atmospheric and worth it end game.
---
It was great I agree.
---
Those are based on the assumption of replacement packs the way blizzard has done expansion packs so far. We're talking about expansion, literally adding content without fucking up ilvls and not raising the level cap
---
Yeah, cause watching hard evidence isn't nice is it. He's ALSO stopping his movement constantly to prove how far the NPCs are away. But let's pretend it is completely as it used to be.
---
Prep healthy meals.
---
Any horde routes?
---
One of them was close. He had to reset the fights over and over and still lost them all. I'd say that's called getting owned. 
---
Is he good? Yes. Is he better than I am? By far. Do I think he did good in all his other fights? Yes if course.
---
I’d probably play BC for a bit but I didn’t like the expac overall. It was ugly, and introduced flying mounts and dailies.  WOTLK was the beginning of the end.
---
I think so. I for one, and I’m sure many others, didn’t realize ele could do what he did with it.
---
I'm sure it's already been said, but kinda looks like a whole raw chicken
---
Taking up 3 or 4 debuff slots it's way larger of an issue for them
---
Exactly. Not to mention overheated and it was a 1v1.
---
I'm with you brother.
---
I had 8mbit adsl at the time, i remember my ping being around 30 in ironforge at peak times
---
Check Looking for Group Monday thread. Guild recruitments are all there
---
nah that would make too much sense. lets split up PvP and PvE completely for 5 expansions and then add templates so gear does not even really matter.
---
Yea, you are not someone who can form actual arguments so you just scream shady and intellectual dishonesty and run away. Go figure.
---
Sounds great :)
---
Finally... I can be a lunar chicken without minmaxers picking on me, I'll just have a macro ready to send this out anytime someone calls me oomkin.
---
Oh well, my bad then. I recall that LFD really became something "normal" only after Cata hit, hence my surprise to all these posts talking about it as if it was characteristic of WotLK. I'm pretty certain some other dungeon finding tools were around during LK, but LFD ? It's really something that was there only at the end of the xpac, or so was it felt by me at the time.
---
Same here. I feel like they spent 90% of their budget on the Orcs' CGI.
---
But they don't, sooo? SW:P is the only thing pushed off. Mindflays slow gets pushed off but who gives a shit about that?
---
A good hunter kiting someone in PvP will be at max distance so the melee leeway only adds a little big of extra difficulty if that.  I never really used traps while kiting or on the run in general, those were more for FD + trap or setting down and forgetting in strategic locations in BGs. No one should be running directly behind you like an idiot in PvP either. It's pretty obvious with the animation for setting a trap so easy to dodge when chasing down a hunter.
---
Scatter Shot and Traps have always been on the same DR, too. This isn't hunter breaking shit. It's only game breaking if you're a shit tier player with no idea of what you're doing.
---
Did you even read my post? You get real.
---
The first lvl 60 will probably be a mage. All it takes is one or two to get ahead of the rest and then the server might as well be dead to them, zero competition and they'll easily catch up and pass the hunters on the way to 60.
---
Game designers are definitely responsible for layering. Engineers and programmers just implement whatever they're told to by the lead developers. They've already stated that server lag isn't the reason for layering, it's purely gameplay related in order to relieve congestion during questing.
---
I think they'll still pick on you. Warrior can 2x our damage after all, so that's a thing. Haha. I'd pick on the Shadow Priest's though if they're around. They're virtually useless in a PvE raid environment. Deflect the bully!  Haha
---
Raising Mana Regen = giving people everything. Any more strawmen you'd like to throw out dishonestly?
---
I had decided to be a warrior tank since I've been a Blood DK for the past few years, but after some research I fear I'm starting to change my mind.  
---
Now that's what I've been hearing, correct me if it's wrong: It seems tanking in classic requires tremendous amound of time farming gear and consumables before you even think about [raiding.](https://raiding.You) You will be in high demand for 5-mans (which I love) but will have a hard time getting a raid spot if you're not very very dedicated. You have a very hard time leveling (to the point where it's not fun) and soloing stuff.  
---
So I naturally think, ok, that seems to be too much responsibility for me right now, how about going Fury? Is it easier to manage and not so hardcore requiring? Are there too many fury warriors and competition?  
---
And now I'm thinking about rolling a priest. It seems to be a little bit easier on the the farming and gear aspect, not as much responsibility but still require high-level skill on your rotation when doing challenging content. Which is exactly what I'm looking for. A class with a high level skill ceiling that is on one hand very necessary and easy to find dungeons and raiding with and on the other hand not so brutal on leveling, pugging a thing or two and farming consumables.  
---
So, what is right and what is wrong?
---
Lol battlemasters were added like a month after BGs. BGs don't turn PVP servers into PVE, you better believe there'll still be fights on raid nights.
---
You don’t take premeditation...
---
I may have herd a few Tauren's before too.
---
You also don't want to play vanilla if tbc comes out, so why your opinion of the longevity of a game that you plan to abandon should even be taken seriously is something to consider.
---
Early BGs had somewhat long Qs and had to be Qd in the zone.  There were roaming arathi and ashenvale/barrens back and forth fights.
---
Cata. Pretty easy.
---
Yeah yeah, just this, just that, just another that blah blah blah. That's how we got to BfA. Shut the fuck up.
---
its an iron maiden song about one of the bloodiest battlefields in WW1
---
The only thing that stops a SP and Elly shaman in pvp is their mana bar.
---
Don't allow players to swap layers more than a couple of times per character just to ensure they play with their IRL friends in the same instance of Azeroth under the same realm. Also, list the layers under the realms.
---
No but it does break a good talent build.
---
Did you know that by definition, accurate is to hit the intended target?
---
Relevant.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w
---
The SM7B is not $200.
---
It can also function as an additional vanish
---
&gt; If a melee character in your deadzone can hit you because of leeway, you can hit them back.
---
Isn't this still bad for hunters though? They don't want to get into a melee fight with melee classes because they'd lose that fight. Sure they can wing clip and try to get away, but they can also get hamstringed(strung?) or poisoned.
---
Considering the Earth is millions of years old... And wow is 15 years old... That sounds pretty brief. Now go away.
---
If you lived in a big city or so maybe
---
Hunters are still an amazing class. Even with all these bugs. Hopefully blizzard fixes them
---
bro, some people want to optimize a certain spec, regardless of how that makes an-unoptimized raid.
---
you kinda come off as an elitist idiot because u/Neeko2lo clearly already knows enhance isn't raid optimal
---
So many straw men. Giving a taunt changes the class that's why I'm always against that for paladins. They should be able to tank ST fights but can't because they run out of threat gen after a couple minutes bc Mana.
---
No one said give infinite mana.
---
I'm not arguing you are just wrong. Let me know when your post score is above 0 and I might consider giving you a few pointers.
---
The point was that leeway and spell batching are required for some players and he used hyperbole. I pointed out some players are still on old tech but fixate on the number.
---
Am I paying $30 a month or $15? I’m pretty sure it’s $15 and I get the option between both when before that $15 only got me BFA
---
&gt;still a meme class that goes OOM in 10seconds and dont get invited to anything
---
&gt;
---
&gt;please put your dress and start healing
---
Watch your tongue, naive. I'd like to see your precious raid succeed without healers.
---
In fact DPS are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to necessity in a raid. Good tanks and healers are far more important. You DPS are a dime a dozen. 
---
You're the waterboys of the wow football team. You aren't fit to wash the tank quarterback or the healer linemen's jock straps.
---
Remember that when they're plowing your girl on prom night.
---
The fact is, the point of discussion should be whether or not the implementation of leeway and spell batching is the right way to do it, not whether or not YOU think hunters are "grateful" for their class
---
I think you avoided the question.
---
I was not asking you for a high school essay on the topic "Why Do Companies Lie?". I was asking you WTF Blizzard devs would lie about a simple, specific, factual issue which nothing important hangs on, when they have been completely open about fixing similarly significant bugs.
---
He won the duel tournament as ele.
---
you think you do but you don't
---
Classic + would be interesting but I think the safe bet for Blizz would just be to roll out BC. Considering I never got to play the game for real until Cataclysm (part of end of Wrath but even still not that much) I would be ok with either strategy they go with.
---
We're already speaking to several Spanish communities, sorry I never mentioned them in the OP (mostly because it went through several edits). I mentioned Italian and Portuguese players specifically as we've yet to manage to get in touch with any of those communities.

Go play bfa.
---
Of course  it will happen, that’s just the way the internet and idolisation works. What will also happen is people realising they’re not the 1% who are good, and they’re not going to be playing elemental shaman in constant favourable matchups vs mages.
---
Wait seriously? lol
---
It's actually perfectly viable. There's a BG'focused spec where you forego lethality in favor of both imp sprint and endurance. By then going into premed instead you can also pick up 5pts in MoD which can't with any other dagger spec without gimping yourself. So in the end you have shortened cooldowns, highest stealth level and detection in the game and with tea you can still 100-0 most classes in the game with ease.

I already debunked your bullshit.  You ignored it.
---
I loved Cata until they released Dragon Soul and LFR. I felt that was the exact moment WoW started to die. I also was not super fond of the PVP Power and PVP Resilience stats but that was a whole other thing
---
You have to be out of combat to be able to use Shadowmeld, so not really.
---
That’s why “Cata babies” are touted around more than other expansions, other than “Wrath babies” during Wrath itself.
---
It was a major shift in the game world and fundamental game design. Up until that expansion it had been a progression of changes through content patches and the first two expansions. 
---
After Cata dropped it was clear that an even greater step change between expansions was possible and Wrath was just a taste.
---
not gonna happen, there's a GOT prequel in the works bout the White Walkers so a Warcraft movie featuring prominent undead would probably be seen as too derivitive. Though hollywood does like to release similiar movies sometimes (Antz and a Bugs Life for example) so maybe that will push it to get produced.

---
They hand picked the streamers dude. They slowed down beta invites, so you should probably not go for a third month of sub.
---
It's also probably just better to not level a character and then have it deleted right away and level another one. So don't feel too bad about the last month of the beta.
---
My DK was a vegetarian ICly, so I only purchased those sorts of foods from the vendors. The Lunar Festival was fab for stocking up on meat free foods to shove in my bags. If I was playing a Tauren, they'd never strike first in PvP and any Druid I rolled never attacked another Druid.

But more importantly, every interaction with your customer base is important.  By claiming that "Nothing important hangs on this" you are demonstrating a colossal ignorance/misunderstanding of how public relations work.
---
Just make the bosses hit har...fuck.
---
The most effiencient leveling is not 1 hand and shield. Defcamp tested the fuck out of it and came with the numbers that elemental after 40 is the most efficient and till then rockbitter + slow weapon is the best.  
---
Overall shield specialization is totally useless unless you are going to tank (keep in mind you will need the 5% dodge talent and stack agi to tank otherwise you will have a really hard time, there is a tanking shaman guide out there), 5% mana is the most important talent because you get oom way to fast.  
---
**Windfury for leveling is total shit.** This is a personal tip from someone who has leveled a  couple shamans. You only have windfury on you bar for when you get ganked or is ganking someone, still you will depend on elemental spells and totems, windfury will be a gift and not a mean.  
---
The best enh shaman out there is **Bloodskull** (look on youtube), and in the bloodskull enhancement shaman school we learn that we should never depend on windfury otherwise we would win only 20% of the time.
---
This guy in particular.
---
But how do you add enough worthwhile content to last years without breaking the game or squishing stats? 
---
Straight up, people aren't going to stick around for vanity items or more iLvl 92 tier gear with rearranged stats and different set bonuses. And if you do add better gear, you'll reach a point where damage output beats character survivability to such a degree that the entire PvP meta changes. 
---
And if that becomes the case, how do you keep the game enticing for new players? No one wants to be the new guy in WSG playing against a crit capped lvl 60 Rogue in t6 who auto attacks you for half your health. 
---
And for PvE, you'd either have to have all future raids at a similar difficulty to Naxx (which would be boring) or implement raid specific mechanics like what they did in Sunwell and ICC to make encounters artificially harder. Or you could just make future boss mechanics super punishing I suppose but you're going to alienate all but your most hardcore raiders.
---
Hell yeah, night elf rogue ftw!

That's not how you spell undead.
---
I'd love for them to continue classic as a separate franchise and launch expansions without the mistakes they have made. I know it's not going to happen but I'd like to play this ten years down the line and not have it become what retail is now. I haven't played since shortly after wotlk but since classic was announced I've gotten my fix on pservers  (I know it's not the same).  I love the difficulty and rewarding moments of vanilla and hope they can continue it without catering too much to casual player feedback and money making opportunities.

Sceptor of the Shifting Sands quest for opening Ahn'qiraj
---
if you feel bad about blizz taking away her job... well, I've got some bad news for you, bub.
---
You have to feed it. Check the diet of said pet
---
Some specs were buffed, in the expansions. Play those if you want perfect class balance but that simply isn’t what classic aims for. Any class can be fun to level and play, but no not every class can top the damage meters.
---
Thats not how you spell Orc
---
If you are feeding it and it’s happy this shouldn’t happen. Probably a pserver bug
---
wow I never figured that blasted lands was black morass. Just played the dungeon &amp; thought it looked like a swamp of sorrows dungeon
---
You explained it properly.
---
For me because I enjoy both PvP and PvE I liked dual spec and used it for that. I'd like to see a different version of it where there's like a 12hr cooldown and you still have to go talk to a trainer. Those 50g respecs just to tank or PvP forced me to pick one or the other and in TBC PvP is all I did because arena was so fun.

You have plenty of time to provide good water to teammates before the BG begins. If you gave me trash water I’d give you downranked heals because well .. no time for randoms, not worth it.
---
Ah alright, probably why it was removed in Cata, thanks for the answer :)
---
Just make names unique across all servers. No one cares about your handle.
---
Pretty pleeeeeeease???
---
How about they prevent it from happening instead? Limit the imbalance to 60:40 by locking charakter creation for the bigger side at that point.
---
Launching at 8:00am on a work day in Australia so all the people who take the day off will hopefully have pushed through the starting zones by the time everyone else gets on in the afternoon/evening. should work out well i hope.

---
Stop posting your shit article my friend.
---
cata, fuck cata.
---
Can you elaborate some more on this? I haven't played the beta.
---
Imagine back peddling in 2019 Vanilla for an advantage in PVP...how ironic &gt;.&lt;
---
I mean... you kind of are a major hero in classic WoW as well, just not during the leveling. We slay one of the old gods after all. We become known and exalted with many factions as we put in the effort. The issue with modern WoW is that it is more story centric than Classic. It went from being somewhat sandbox style MMO to pure themepark on the rails style.
---
At 10-13 yards I get hamstrung, I effectively lost all kiting abilities. Yes I can wing clip, however at 10 yards I shouldn’t be able to be hit. Therefore concussion shot and kite away with cheetah that’s assuming spell batching doesn’t f me and I get dazed cause he auto hit me at 10-13 yards. 
---
Hunters are also wing clip bots with Nightfall
---
Swings and roundabouts - you might lose a bit of early gold but you'll have a bank full of enchanting mats.
---
ill post a ward here to read answers
---
Do you have 8 shamans in your raid? If not that's another entire group which now gets totem buffs, improved ones at that. 
---
On top of that you get another nightfall-bot that need very few high in demand items and utilizes mail pieces that are in abundance. 
---
Reincardnation comes in handy as well,
---
Seriously, enhancement shaman is a perfectly viable  spec in a raid and people have taken enhancment shamans cfrom MC to Kel'Thuzad.
---
Is it super optimal? Most likely not. Is it a boomkin? No, it's considerably better.
---
Well, you'll get *an* answer.  Maybe not the right or best one.  Just have to look at all the recent outcry about melee leeway for a perfect example.
---
Anyway, other guy was right too.  Wrong thread.
---
because battlegrounds won't be the epic experience you remembered. warsong gulch and arathi basin in 2019. oh ok.
---
that too
---
Lowlevel Twink Items like Shadowfang. Early on everyone and their mother will run SFK and all the Dungeons. Uldaman will be run a lot more in the first few Weeks than ever again and lots of people will have no fucking clue how valuable these items are.
---
I plan to buy stuff like that early on and bank it until a few month in. 
---
I'm also sure most people have no idea how valuable stuff like Large Fangs and Wicked Claws can be.
---
And the other 50% of the player base will tell you that
---
1) it's unfair that a PvP player gets to be somewhat efficient in raid by "simply" having gathered gear via PvP rewards, which can be done solo as well
---
2) it's unfair that basically everyone in PvP gear gets utterly demolished by people who have farmed PvE gear only. PvP player should have the right to have fun if they choose not to raid.
---
Effort is probably placed into them due to the lack of any credible data when someone makes a insufferable comment based on a opinion. Imagine a world where people want to understand a statement, supported by relevant data, than simply deciding how or what something is or was. Blasphemy, I know.
---
The good;
---
Male Orc melee animations, 2h and 1h. In fact all the Male Orc animations are pretty good.
---
Undead Male; Casting Animations are awesome
---
Tauren 2h. That hit has some weight behind it!
---
Dwarf Male; Great 2h idle animation. The spinny special attack is fun too.
---
Human male 1h special. It's iconic.
---
Night Elf Female... Everything. 1h special, Every weapon idle stance (especially staves), JUMP
---
Gnome 2h backflip.
---
Troll bow animations are fun and unique too
---
There are definitely horde icons next to Durotar, Barrens, Mulgore, Thousand Needles, Tirisfal, and Silverpine.  Badlands and Swamp of Sorrows, too.
---
She's in Legion too.
---
I’ve missed you guys
---
Ill be playing mage in classic, the ONLY negative thing with mage is that you will have to drink ALOT while leveling. Tho later on you will have mana gem, evocation etc for lesser drinking :&gt;
---
the deadzone is smaller but they are able to hit you from further away within it?  i think?
---
&gt; "Why would they lie?"
---
&gt; "Here are several reasons why they might".
---
&gt; "OMG you dodged the question!"
---
You did.
---
If someone asks you a clear and specific question, you can't squirt out a cloud of generalities like a frightened squid and hide amongst them. You need to respond with something specifically pertinent.
---
I did not ask you "Why do companies lie?", I asked you "Why would they lie **about this**?".
---
You have still avoided answering.
---
&gt; But more importantly, every interaction with your customer base is important. By claiming that "Nothing important hangs on this" you are demonstrating a colossal ignorance/misunderstanding of how public relations work.
---
All the more reason not to lie about something totally trivial and easily fixed, right?
---
And let me point out the elephant in the room one more time. *People have decompiled the 1.12 client and proved that what Blizzard said was true.* How does that fit into your deranged conspiracy theory?
---
I think you read something completely different than what I posted.
---
Imagine getting mad over a joke 😂
---
I'd report this for Rule #7, but it says no "low effort memes" and this meme has way too much effort.
---
&gt;Gear that doesn't have just more stats but instead can enhance/alter talents, spells, and abilities.
---
And it will boil down to: "is it an upgrade?"
---
If it's not, a lot of people will not even bother.
---
The only thing that is obvious here is that you are condescending and ignorant. As many people have pointed out in this thread OP has made a biased assumption when determining the average latency for his calculation.
---
Since the latency plays an integral part in this he simply discredited his own effort. It's hilarious how many people are blinded by the fact that he dumped a few links to "back up" his faulty assumptions. The approach might be laudable, to proceed with scientific methods in mind, but the result is both shameful and meaningless since this neither proves anything nor points to any solutions that we didn't already know without doing the maths.
---
The entire spellbatching debate has become a joke as the entire issue is really as simple as I've stated in this thread before. The system doesn't act the way it should in select cases like a sprinting rogue not triggering a trap. Does that mean the entire system is wrong and should be changed or removed? No, because the system simply isn't accurate enough to what it's trying to simulate yet.
---
That is the end of the discussion. The system needs finetuning and the OP has done nothing to make that any more likely.
---
As a final point: To ask of someone who criticizes something to "do it better then" must be one of the most trite responses the history of discourse has ever seen. An individual's right to voice their opinion and make arguments for their own point is not invalidated by their inability or unwillingness to undergo the same efforts.
---
He had the equalant of like 7000k hp at lvl 60 and got bugged double crits with EM and was fighting mages over and over. That helps, lol.
---
out of all the possible things you could have picked, you picked arena. lol
---
I think you don't understand how wpvp encounters work then. I suggest getting on a private server or something and doing some world pvp and seeing how it works. If you lay traps and forget them in BGs you're a shit tier player
---
the rating is hidden rn
---
Did they not in Vanilla?
---
So Wonderfull uwu
---
I like transmog in retail, because at that point there’s so many cool items and you can make some really cool, unique mogs.  It’s almost a game in and of itself.
---
But in Vanilla, transmog would be horrible.  You wanna feel that fear when that rogue in full Bloodfang ganks your ass in Arathi Basin.
---
The algorithm/maths were tweaked with a higher average ping in mind. If added in today, they would use different averages to tweak the amount of added yard range.
---
I think so, from what I've seen at least ([video talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj0GCK0ngpY)). But a lot of players are coming to Vanilla from years of private servers and this fact was never actually queried (or assumed to be a bug on the side of the PS) and having them not share DR is an interaction a lot of players have gotten used to from PS play.
---

---
As for why would you scatter feign, I don't play hunter, nor am I hardcore PvPer on private servers (I play casually though) so I'm not super duper sure. I imagine there's way more skilled players than I who might be able to provide a more decided answer, but if I had to hazard a guess, the primary use case would be to give the aggressing player no choice in the matter of landing the trap. For example, fighting a caster (say Mage) who isn't necessarily sat in your face but you want to force a reset on, scattering and then moving into range to feign trap is way easier than trying to face tank their damage while you get blasted with Frostbolts, even more so if you get frostbite triggered on you. Or if you're just not as confident with the class and simply want to gaurantee the trap landing against a rogue. Maybe, just because feign is inconsistant and has a delay sometimes and could possibly result in you dying, if you don't buffer it with scatter.
---
what ever happened to the white raptor?
---
Dont look at the happy face in the pet window. But look at the Unit Frame.
---
In the pet window look at the loyalty level. You want to feed him pretty often during level 1 and 2. It gets easier by level 3 and by level 6 loyalty(max) you only have to feed rarely.
---
Try and keep him from dying because it reduces happines by a lot and it will run away
---
&gt; It would make more healers available if people do.
---
Ha ha, yeah right. People who decided on shaman based on lvl 40 twink meta duels will play healer, lol.
---
Tidal charm (:
---
True, I just don’t like the downtime spent on drinking, but I love all the aoe abilities mage has compared to warlock. How effective is the warlocks hellfire compared to something like blizzard?
---
Yeah, I'd love to get to Wrath if they dropped LFD.  I really enjoyed paladin tanking in Wrath.
---
You should really feel bad for the poison vendors. A patch happened and every single rogue in the world simultaneously discovered a new way to make poisons with the vendor's mats. Quite a few of them poisoned themselves after losing their livelihood
---
Leeway was in Vanilla, it is in Retail today, and they confirmed it's working as intended in Classic. I was just giving you an out, but instead I'll just say: get the fuck over it you whiny bitch.
---
Let's propose some alternatives.
---
&gt;People go out in to the world to farm or to get to portals. Any pvp is just a minor annoyance, it's very rarely fair or interesting or engaging. That's why noone does wpvp at 60,
---
People will kill each other over rarespawns, questitems, mining/skinning/herbalism-nodes and other monsters naturally. Maybe they dont want to get attacked  afterwards so they attack preemptively or they dont like the name/guild of the enemy players. Or, which is my top reason, **WPvP is actually fun and a quick fix for dominance.**  
---
Phase 2 will introduce World Bosses alongside the honor system and its rewards but not battlegrounds. 
---
**Phase 2 Release and the weeks following it will be the most epic world pvp experience that WoW will ever have cause people have incentive to grind WPvP Kills for rewards.**
---
I honestly cant wait.
---
Is a cooldown enough though?
---
Hunters have some bugs, even though they have been fixing them over the recent weeks , doomsday reeeeee sky falling.
---
Leeway also caused all non melee to scree. More founded than hunters I'd say since they are bug fixing those and currently nothing said by blozz to actually change this part. The she do we want the vanilla experience or the vanilla code exactly as it was debate.
---
You think me using the word construed  is debunked bullshit. I didnt ignore anything. I provided arguments amd you ignored them instead acting as if the use of the word construed is an automatic win for you. Which it certainly isnt. Your argumentarive skill is similar to that of a 6 year old.
---
I think my biggest thing is just that the layers should be permanent rather than this more fluid system that we see in the world now. I would rather be able to choose my layer and have it last indefinitely (until an admin merge that is) as opposed to being able to hop back and forth at will (even on a cooldown).

should be enough to prevent frequent layerswapping, unless it can be reset somehow. im positive blizz will make sure relogs or deaths wont reset it though.
---
I'd quit the day cata comes out. Just like i did in retail.
---
Have you looked into moonkin 5man tanking? I always thought it would be a fun thing to try once you severely outgear the dungeons but nost shut down before I put any real effort into it and since then I haven't really raided much. 
---
It would probably require a pretty wonky set of gear, which you'd have to get from raiding as both resto and feral (and various non-raid gear). Pulling it off could lead to some good laughs, I think.
---
How is shaman population small at all? Numbers show it being top 3 or 4 most played class on Horde side on every major pserver, on the census on this subreddit, and the population of the last stress test.
---
Only beat by Warrior and Mage (sometimes slightly beat by rogue as well).
---
I would name the references for the pservers but it would get this comment deleted T_T. So just to say it's not just 1 preserver or only perservers but all major ones and stats from other places as well.
---
Pet loyalty has levels. It doesn’t matter if you have a green happy face. When you first tame it is at its lowest level and will run away if you aren’t feeding it. You need to feed it to up it’s loyalty levels. It gains levels as you gain levels. So if your level 13 and your pet is 13- it won’t get anything. It will when your are 14. Since you’re 13 and it’s 11 it will get experience and loyalty.
---

I haven't looked into it, but pretty much anything can tank 5-mans once you have the gear.
---
Hey dude sorry to bug ya but any chance that wallpaper is available in 1440p? I just got it off wallpaper engine!
---
What a nice gift!
---
Heh I thought the rp aspect of having to gather gear designed to help you against a challenging foe to be pretty cool. I never had a problem with farming resist gear, and doing dungeons over and over with guildmates created a bond between us. Like what's the difference between having to farm NR gear for a few weeks or having to gear 10ilvls so you can do harder raids or higher m+ keys? If you want a game with no "artificial" roadblock go play a fighting game where all is unlocked from the start and only your mechanical skill determines who wins.
---
Yes. Hunters suffer the same as every other range class in that it's a little easier for melee to hit them. They're not worse off and it has nothing to do with the deadzone.
---
&gt;I was just giving you an out
---

No, you were pretending like you had an actual argument, got blown the fuck out, and now you're backpedaling.
---
To the "was in vanilla" argument, why are we including the updated graphics then?
---
Flasks and elixirs increase your dps, too. Are those exploits as well? Classic is a RPG, you spend time preparing for battle and you're rewarded for it. Pretty basic RPG mechanic. 
---
Btw, world buffs go away after one wipe. You most likely won't have them on your progression kills cause you'll be wiping a few times on bosses before killing em.
---
&gt;However, they are still able to ride any Neutral mounts such as the [Swift Razzashi Raptor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19872/swift-razzashi-raptor) or the [Deathcharger's Reins](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13335/deathchargers-reins), making the limitation rather useless.
---
Yeah, good luck getting those.
---
The biggest issue is not names lol, it's the disastrous effect on the economies.
---
If you figure that one out I'm sure Blizzard will hire you to sort it out personally!

One of the cornerstones of an mmorpg is to be able to take your sweet fucking sword you just got to drop and pwn some noobs with it. I think it's perfectly fine for pve gear to make you a glass cannon in pvp. Sorry to the guys who only had blues in vanilla, but tough shit.

Yeah no.  Every class has a raiding spec, you want to dps, don't roll a druid.  You might get to be the lucky feral, boomkin though, don't even bother.
---
The Blackrock Mountain text is oddly familiar.
---
There has been demand for classic for years, this was not new information to Blizzard. They actively didn’t make classic because of how much work they thought would be involved. Once they realized there was a cheap(work hours cost money often as much or more than asset generation) and easy way to effectively emulate Vanilla on modern architecture did classic become a viable option.
---
and that take could lead to the playerbase shrinking. You dont want to exclude casuals from your game for 2 weeks, this is how you kill your game and EVERYONE looses because servers are dead.
---
Hell yea brother!
---
You can't do that only for gearing reasons, or else yes, everyone would spam warriors, more than they already do.
---
People don't just have lower pings, servers are quicker and more responsive aswell, surely that plays a role in the issues we see today.
---
The more you know about other classes the better you will do. A lot of battles are decided in the opening few moves. When I played a rogue, I could count on about half my victims to just stand there and not react when I opened up on them. A lot of people just give up. A player who's familiar with a rogue's strengths and weaknesses has a good shot of surviving. 
---
The best general advice is to not give up. I've seen people bounce back and win against some pretty crazy odds.
---

---
Each tree helps you over all but it isn’t what stops you from being a healer. While leveling a Ret Paladin can heal 5 mans just fine with int int gear. 
---
This changes once you start getting higher level and really need those extra spells and capstone to be efficient.
---
Total spell dam and specific spell dam will affect the same spell the same way.
---
20 frost dam = 20 spell dam and healing in regards to frost spells.
---
The coefficients used to determine the effects is based on cast time.
---
You can. Warrior pre-raid can walk right into AQ and have success. It's not going to steam roll, sure, but when you can split run MC and BWL with 20ish with ease every week. You can feed the mouths faster.  
---
You're right that it'll still be a challenge to gear at a decent pace, but autist always find a way.
---
Try thinking of a spell batch like a traffic light cycle. 
---
If you don’t react to the green light fast enough you will have to wait another cycle to get through.
---
If most people take 3 seconds to react to the green light and the light lasts for 4 seconds then they will make it through.
---
Now we add your cars (latency) into the problem, years ago  most people had a car that took 2 seconds to start moving, which means you couldn’t make the first traffic light. However, today most people have a modern car that can start moving in .5 seconds, meaning most people can now get through the first light.
---
If you wanted to recreate the conditions where most people (unless they had exceptional equipment or reaction speeds) would miss the first light you would need to reduce the traffic light cycle time (batch window).
---
In this way OP was right by taking into account reaction time and latency when discussing spell batching.
---
Min-max would be engineering + blacksmithing for anti-fear trinket, since hunter pvp trinket doesn't break fear. And as a hunter you can trinket swap in your feign death, so more than 2 trinkets is fine.
---
Of course while leveling you could do mining+skinning to earn some gold and save some ore.
---
Shadow priests do decent damage.  Only reason people say don’t play them is the same reason as a lock. In raids they don’t do as much as mages due to debuff cap.
---
The melody is ”Country roads”

I gave you a source. Ask sakaar yourself since he's the source.

A list of coefficients for 1.12. As others have mentioned, nearly every spell in the game treats elemental damage and spell damage the same, provided the spell uses that school.
---
yay, the 1%ers can do that.  The normal crowd will be fine playing the other pure dps that can "reasonably" keep up with warriors, and then you will have the meme specs, who are having "fun" but at the end of the day they are still being carried.  They don't compete, they barely beat tanks.

Ah, well, you posted to the wrong thread on the LFG post then.  Anyway, we're a hard no on PVP servers
---
Move on you sheltered need.
---
So you have two WoW account under the same [B.net](https://B.net) account?  You should be able to open WoW directly and log in without [B.net](https://B.net), but I think it will still flag you online for [B.net](https://B.net). [B.net](https://B.net) might screw things up for you as it would detect the [B.net](https://b.net) account logged in two different places.

Main a lock and alt a priest. Leveling a priest  would be slower and more boring if you’re questing. So just play it when you feel like a change from the lock.
---
'a former blizzard dev allegedly said blizzard will be answering classic tickets with real people and not automated responses despite it being automated on retail'
---
Yeah you'll need actual proof to back that up, not a reference to a person not even employed by blizzard.
---
There are no alternatives. I just want it to play like Vanilla - Blizz don't care.
---
Beta fix. 
---
Beta test. 
---
But most importantly, on July 12 Beta get to rest. 😪😪
---
The automated system is there so that horrible people can't roam free until a GM can look into the reports. It's a temporary measure, once a GM takes a look at your case either you'll be punished or the people who reported you will be depending on if it's false reports or not.
---
&gt;your equation
---
Read your own quote of the OP, dude.
---
I was so hesitant to play because of this. I never played back in the day, but my husband is a big fan so I decided to try it out with him on a private server before the release of Classic.   
---
I literally took a day off of work yesterday and did basically nothing except level with him. My biggest fear confirmed: I'm addicted and I'm gonna be broke. But I'm having the best time, lol.
---
The stealth talents are nice but not worth the significant dps loss.
---
I'd jump at the end of TBC..WotLK killed it for me DKs, LFG bullshit
---
Telling them to change it to make it authentic.. hmm
---
Really need help deciding between warlock or hunter for a FUN alt class to my warrior for light PvE and some PvP. Fun should be the main factor, since I love the class fantasy of both equally.
---
Catering to what you expect the audience to want is how we ended up with BFA. I would rather have server communities and long queues than layering and abuse of mechanics.
---
So if you're playing priest right (as in Forsaken) weapon skill won't ever matter.
---
its confirmd that its one of the possible prequel series, there was like 8 proposed tho idk which one will be icked. With how little they showed of the Whtie Walkers in GOT I wouldn't be surprised if they had saved some for the prequel series.
---
From what I've heard, as it is now it's 400 ms, or .4 seconds, while the only GCD reducers in WoW were originally added into BC, and even that was only reducing down from 1.5 seconds to 1 second. By Wrath there are some ways of pushing the GCD for certain abilities down even further to .5 seconds, but even if "WotLK Classic" still runs with .4 second spell batching, the GCD can never be reduced to abuse that.
---
Not necessarily. It's not a clean cut choice like you're hoping for. 
---
It boils down to survivability vs threat generation. Both critical to tanking. Warriors naturally have higher surv. and lower threat than a bear. So it depends how you value those "stats". 
---
Imo, once survivability is "adequate", anything extra is superfluous. Having more survivability just so healers end the fights with more mana is pointless. 
---
However the more threat gen you have, the more your DPS can go nuts and bosses will die faster.
---
As others have mentioned warriors are even dual weilding to sacrifice some of their survivability for extra threat gen.
---
The playstyles are very different too. Warrior has a lot more moving parts, which is a very engaging and fun experience, but druids are more role-versatile. Gearing a druid is also easier and pairs well with a warrior as they're not competing on any drops.
---
For me, the choice is easy, Bear all the way :)
---
He knows goddamned well what the melody is :)
---
There are already a bunch of updated for Classic addons on Minion.
---
The two arent really comparable. Self driving trucks would legitimately be a security nightmare. It will be decades before they're really viable.
---
Nah I really don't care a rats ass about if you believe him or not. Ask him if you want, if not I'm perfectly fine with you basing your opinions on pure guess work. Cya
---
You are presenting it like this is a new idea.
---
Or do you acknowledge this is almost an exact repost of dozens of other people?
---
&gt; They can switch servers at any time. 
---
THEY CANT SWITCH SERVERS IF THEIR FRIENDS ARE PLAYING. Sometimes i feel like this sub is dominated by solo players, seeing all these "which faction should i choose"-threads.  
---
Were talking about WoW Classic, THE game with the most forced socialization i can imagine nowadays. People are going to play with their friends/family/guildies/retailbuddies. If they cant login they wont start solo on a different server oO, what are you guys thinking? :O
---
I kinda hop it doesn't do "great". I just want to play Vanilla. Can't we just play Vanilla?
---
True-dat. (Though Ashkandi totally is, if you're a non-PvP guild. There's no reason for a warrior to have it for PvE reasons.)
---
A lot of people will pick a class strictly because they are strong in 1v1
---
Polying and eating/drinking was not allowed in vanilla wow. At least on my server it wasnt. Shadowmoon US PvP. I know this because I was a lvl 60 mage. Same with pots and engineering items.
---
Xfire
---
I'm not a fan of having every class be capable of everything - that's not the Classic way. But I'll be honest I'm not exactly the biggest fan of there only being 1 real capable talent build for most classes when it comes to raiding.
---
If there's a future where Blizzard continues with BC before deciding to keep evolving the game apart from WotLK I'd wish that they keep flying to the Outlands.
---
That way they could keep expanding Azeroth with ground mounts and if Blizz ever wants to go back there or another Planet they could design that expansion with flying in mind from the start, giving them space for creativity while keeping Azeroth the way it was.
---
Warcraft 3 was a standout because its graphics were much more strong, voice acting and imrpoved upon the previous system. Now, while the story was more intricate and involved than before, they've expanded upon the past lore in the last 15 years to where you can definitely have a heavy story prior to arthas. It just wouldn't be anything people remember because they didn't play it.
---
But, they're not trying to attract just warcraft fans, they're trying to get anyone that they can
---
I like Wrath, so I'll stick it out until cata
---
id have to say hunter because they are more dominant pvp-wise during leveling and also with less gear at 60. warlock is more of a main class because it is weak until it gets gear.
---
how are paladins like end game both pve and pvp? i am a casual now so i dont think i will hc raid. i am torn between paladin or warrior, love tanking. i used to have a 60 warrior in vanilla and played a paladin in wotlk.

---
Do shift modifier macros work?
---
/cast \[mod:shift\] Multi-Shot
---
/cast Arcane Shot
---
16:10 is superior for gaming
---
16:9 is for fucking movies, rly, cmon
---
but each to their own of course
---
Inevitable unsubs. Subs they just got back.
---
Streaming reduces 20-40 year old social outcasts into attention seeking whores who remind me of the ditzy blondes who will do \*ANYTHING\* to get onto to TV for their 5 seconds of fame so when they are sucking dick for the next 20 years they can look back and always think \* I got onto Esfands stream\*
---
Only on Reddit can I read how Nelf ilare the absolute worst, and then read the exact opposite in another post.  Haven't watched the video yet, will when I get home.  Hopefully it's not just trolling.
---
WoD, but I'd probably just stay on WotLK until MoP came out rather than move to Cata if I had the choice.
---
Have you tried /castsequence with reset timers?
---
I'm not sure what timing we'd want exactly for rotations, would need to play around with it, but something like;
---
/castsequence reset=6 Aimed Shot, Multi-Shot
---
There isn't much value to be gained from dredging up old reddit threads and talking on those, that isn't in line with the meta of reddit. 
---
The more these conversations are in the forefront of our communities, the better...or do you disagree?
---
&gt; No, you were pretending like you had an actual argument, got blown the fuck out, and now you're backpedaling.
---
He showed how you are wrong about leeway and you ignored it.
---
1.  This exact code was in Vanilla and that's reason enough to keep it as it is.
---
2.  Leeway was originally intended to improve the experience for people with poor ping, and plenty of people still have poor ping, even if you personally have better ping now.
---
3.  You're asking the devs to change what was actually in Vanilla because it would improve the experience for you personally even if it is detrimental to those people who have poor ping now.  You should realize how dumb an idea that is.
---
If you don't have the ability to understand the above, then that's your problem.  But the devs do understand it, which is why they've said leeway is working as intended.
---
Blizz doesn't have GMs for specific games.  All retail GMs are also Classic GMs.
---
&gt; What's your idea around random layer hops like we've seen some examples of? 
---
Hard to tell, blizz experimented A LOT on beta
---
&gt; It might sound alittle trivial, but it would kindoff suck. 
---
Randomly vanishing players/monsters in a world is a NIGHTMARE and HOPE i doesnt occur often.  
---
I have no answers to how layers exactly work. What happens when a new layer gets opened?  
---
Layer 1: 3000 Players  
---
Layer 2: 200 Players?  
---
That would feel weird to the Layer2 people, but you just cant pull 1400 Layer1 players out of their layer (so you got 1,6/1,6), that would break immersion. :(  
---
Again, i dont have an answer to that, i dont even have beta access. 
---
**We just gotta hope blizzard comes up with a working, TEMPORARY solution with very limited exploitability which gets removed ASAP.**
---
It's obviously not working or playing the same as it did in Vanilla.
---
I want it to play like Vanilla. It doesn't currently.
---
Yes it should be changed. Shocking.
---
You're such an unpleasant person, god I hope you don't end up on the same server as me.
---
Ping doesn't entirely depend on the distance. Will the distance affect ping? Sure but what also matters is how many hops (different routers) it needs to go through on the way to your destination. You can still live several hundred (or even thousands) of miles further than someone else from the server and still can have better ping based on the routing.
---
Back when I was student I lived on student dorms, we had internet that was basically just one hop away from the national backbone so my pings were much lower than they are right now. I live like 2 miles away from the dorms I used to live in and have much worse pings because I have regular consumer ISP and it takes me several more hops to reach the backbone.
---
I remember discussing CC and kill orders with dungeon groups, good times. Tol barad was also fun. I didn't raid during that expansion.
---
Blizz shouldnt go their traditional expansion route or this entire classic experience will be wasted. Players want to level capped. I know the experience and the possible fifteen+ /played days worth getting to cap in lvl , gear, and professions is what most hype but level cap is the reward. I want to be 60 for a long time. longer than i have been level capped in any iteration of the game. The move i predict blizzard is going to pull off is a type of system that imports your characters to a BC server and so on and so forth. This will allow for blizzard to have people paying for retail, classic, or the expansion 2.0 servers. Whatever the customer wants.
---
Then they wait. Their friends are obviously experiencing the same issues. Sometimes I feel this sub is dominated by people with a high time preference who have no respect for good game/world design.
---
&gt;The only factor now is your distance to where you're sending and receiving information.
---
No it isn't. The routing is a factor which can be more convoluted over a longer distance but that isn't always the case. 
---
Geography isn't always a direct factor either as some places can be geographically closer but further away from an "internet highway"
---
On another note, satellite internet is apparently a popular (or necessary) thing in parts of the US.
---
I've never been able to do that, lol. I can't focus on both.
---
Interesting. I honestly didn’t know this was against TOS
---
I never said anything about the timeline. But it WILL happen.
---
A regular really hot guy.
---
Jokes on you, there won’t be any hunters.
---
Omg I miss xfire, I wish it was still around, so much nostalgia there.
---
Yes we need layering.  Some of us who played back in the day have since moved out of our parenta basement and actually have a life.  We don't wanna spend hours in queue or fighting to tag mobs.
