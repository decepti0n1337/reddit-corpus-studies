At the time, I was very young and played on my Dad’s account, so I never got past mid 30’s. I eventually did on a server I won’t mention, but I am looking forward to doing it for-real this time around.
---
---
---
Yeah, those warlocks need to get on early and farm shards for half an hour or more till their bags are full so we can all act like afk assholes!
---
Odd, I always thought it was easy being a rogue. Stealth to and from quest objectives. Super short kill times, options to avoid annoying, random world pvp. 
---

---
I always feel naked playing anything but my rogue. Life in the shadows. 
---
Man world pvp back then was so good. I remember leveling in hillsbrad,arathi highlands and a few other zones. Anyhow, I used to run into a dwarf hunter named pig face. I remember this player by name because we battled it out in many different zones when we were leveling. It was so much fun and in the end we ended up greeting each other at times because it turned into a respect thing.
---
My personal favorite right now is Deep Rock Galactic. It's not an MMO, but if you like team based horde shooters it's fantastic, and you can tell the dev's are pouring their heart and souls into the game. 
---
I'll probably play some Wargroove when it's released in March. Until then, nothing. Maybe Artifact. I downloaded it but have barely touched it since.
---
Fuck that druid heals are god
---
Yes, classic is an easy cashgrab, anyone can figure that out. They can get people to subrscribe to an MMO they have already like 60% finished and which they never have to release content to. It's a no  brainer really. But luckily for us we want this cashgrab.
---
Inb4 stupid people claim it would never work in vanilla because of how iLvls worked.
---
Well make an addon that evaluates stats, procs and on use effects then, it's not hard to do.
---
We all have off moments
---
But lowkey that hemo ability on the murlocs seems custom as fuck ngl
---
Gearscore works as an evaluative tool because there is no community. You just group with random people you never see again. That just won't happen in Classic, not with server caps. There will only be so many people and you'll know who the bad players are, good gear or not. 
---
Probably a fury/arms warrior in M+.  Rogue in raids.  Feral Druid in PvP.
---
fleeing speed used to be a bug on many private servers too.
---
But their pet better come with the big dick dps
---
I remember running from darkshore all the way to ironforge. 
---
Wetlands were hell.
---
Check out warmane outland. Server has a pop of like 3k, everyone knows eachother. If you ask to join a Kara pug, the first question they will ask is "GS?". If its sub 3k gs, they will stop responding to you
---
Why did you teach your dog how to use a computer?
---
While WotF is a pain in the ass, only about 30% of horde play undead so it's not the end of the world. Tremor Totem is not that big of a deal, it pulses every three seconds so you usually get at least Fear's cast time back in CC time, and you can easily have your pet kill the totem. It's by far the worst of the anti-fear abilities in the game. Feared people will often run out of the totem's radius before it pulses.
---
Alliance does have some anti-warlock things. Fear Ward is brutal in organized PvP, because while it's less common than WotF due to being a race+class ability, a single dwarf priest can cast it on most of their BG team before the start of a match and then dole it out pretty liberally during play. Horde warlocks very often have to deal with seeing their fears do nothing. Also, alliance has two classes that can cleanse which is a big problem for enemy warlocks.
---
In world PvP, horde locks definitely have the advantage because there's a smaller chance of paladins and dwarf priests being around, and WotF is at its best in 1v1; but in BGs (and especially premades where there'll almost always be a dwarf priest), it's a lot more even. On a 1-to-1 basis, Fear Ward is a way bigger obstacle for warlocks than WotF is, it's just that there's a lot more undead anything than there are dwarf priests.
---
I would argue that alliance warlocks are better off than horde in the premade meta, but horde certainly has the upper hand elsewhere. Most alliance premades will have at least one dwarf priest and a couple of paladins, and that's a nightmare for warlocks to deal with. Out in the world you usually don't have to deal with that then it's a hassle to be an alliance warlock when every third guy you meet is undead.
---
Hindsight is always 20/20 my dude.
---
The change to the rating system was necessary for TBC so that level 60 gear wouldn't provide the same flat bonuses and make the 70 gear provide overpowered stats in order to be an upgrade.
---
I doubt we will see that system in Classic, since it wasn't yet necessary. 
---
Holy paladins are always in high demand for raids. A huge portion of people who roll paladins without prior knowledge of late game pve expect some retribution style of gameplay and end up quitting after a bit of raiding. What this means is if you roll paladin specifically to heal, guilds will really want to hang on to you. 
---
*Picks up paper*

"5k for collectors edition? Tell em he's dreamin" 
---
I was a 10 year old kid who played a human rogue. Had on idea what i was doing. I used most of my gold on green weapons and gear on the AH. I thought i had to buy gear to not be weak lol dont ask me why. 
---
I remember at lvl 38 i bought a horse for my last 9g or whatever it cost. I was so fucking hyped for lvl 40 because then i would be able to ride it. I hit lvl 40 and realized what the hell i cant ride it? Requires apprentice riding skill what?? I looked everywhere to find the the riding trainer. I finally found the npc and at my disappointment it said i needed 80g to buy it. How the hell am i going to make this kind of money? I felt my heart sink into my stomach. I have never been so disappointed. I had been so hyped to ride my horse around the world. Thats the moment i decided to give up on this lvl 40 human rogue. I made a mage and leveled it to 19. I did deadmines for the first time and got my emberstone staff. My first rare item. Then i unfortunately had to quit wow completely. My parents said i was spending too much time at the computer and that the game was toxic for my brain. I was really sad.
---
This time around i have nothing stopping me. Nothing will stop me from reaching my goals this time. Im so fucking hyped lets go!
---
You are literally in this thread calling min maxxers the death of gaming. That seems a bit extreme and bitter to me. 
---
The ironic thing is I think the people min/maxing will make the game MORE welcoming, not less. Raids being easier along with 1.12 talents means that meme spec isn't holding anyone back. I was in a casual guild by p server standards last year, and it had a lot of former raiders who didn't have a lot of time to dedicate, yet still knew their shit. Made for a very relaxed atmosphere. 
---
GW2 is also handicapped by its megaservers and all zones being instanced, which is like a less aggressive sharding. Imagine GW2's event chains but with an actual, seamless open world like vanilla WoW's, spanning several zones, involving faction PvP and having lasting repercussions for the entire realm. For example, every Saturday there's a caravan going from some zone to the next, and both factions fight for control over it. The faction that wins gets its repair costs lowered for the next week.
---
We usually let the druids do the offtanking so the warriors can dps.
---
Way to cherry pick one word and misconstrue my point
---
Same with AMD like 2 years ago
---
Kingdom come deliverance is a fun immersive rpg; worth a go if your 15th century enthusiast.
---
&gt; Just felt stagnant.
---
Same reason I quit. Its hard to explain why its so meh.
---
TBC
---
&gt; You are literally in this thread calling min maxxers the death of gaming. That seems a bit extreme and bitter to me. 
---
What? Where? Do you even know what "literally" means? 
---
Oh, I understand now. You are one of those guys who actually think they are superior and become aggressive as soon as they feel someone doesn't think like them. Ha ! Gotcha.
---
More seriously dude, you must chill. I personally didn't say anything in the above posts that should offend anyone. You did exactly the same in your first post.
---
&gt; Raids being easier along with 1.12 talents means that meme spec isn't holding anyone back. I was in a casual guild by p server standards last year, and it had a lot of former raiders who didn't have a lot of time to dedicate, yet still knew their shit. Made for a very relaxed atmosphere. 
---
I believe you and hope you will find the same, and that I will find something like that as well.
---
Been there done that, I remember even farming the gold for my epic mount. It tool forever lol. Also I must say, most us had no idea what the hell we were doing. I even remember meeting a player in durotar and going on an adventure around different zones. We died so many times trying to avoid mobs but it was something that I honestly remember enjoying.
---
Yeah world PvP was the only way to make cross faction relations, because you bump into the same people enough and eventually you just let one another pass to happily gank your faction's lowbies! Win-win!
---
Yes we all know. He was bringing into question the reason behind quoting the dude, not the quote itself.
---
Great, I saved all your names and will approach you guys on here as we near summer. 
---
Guaranteed this will be done. The lists are already made. It's trivial to divide the lists in tiers are create a score out of that.
---
Fire the moon!
---
or wait... moon's unemployed
---
nvm
---
Yeah, it should be better this time around, and if it is the 1.12 itemization all the easier for MC and BWL.   Hitting MC with Tier 0 because you had no idea what BiS was and dragging in lvl 58/59 healers because you needed more and wiping ion trash for 2 hours....can't say I'm going to miss that, but I do have fond memories of that pain....
---
So not likely 100g repair nights, but those did exist in vanilla.
---
Verrae is comin back!
---
Alliance locks can spam more shadow bolts with Salvation! 
---
Worth noting that in the version of Loot Trading that is currently on Live servers, this ring would not be eligible for trade.  
---
Not saying that whatever ends up in Vanilla will resemble what's in live, just that this example doesn't match up with the current loot rules.
---
Can you recommend any besides blue plz / epic?
---
Rogues level slower than Warriors, btw. According to LMGD and some other top guys.

good old times, when legendary gear from previous expansion was better than lowest-tier raiding gear from current
---
&gt; he top 1% of pvpers
---
What does that even mean?
---
I saw some clickbait today I totally fell for, something to the effect of, “classic WoW is challenging,” clicked the link, read basically the summary of a blue post from the classic forum that said, “we have no news,” and, “we’d love to do a q&amp;a, when we have something to talk about.”
---
Got my hopes up for nothing.
---
Man I remember old videos like this. Fun times.
---
That's not what he means at all.
---
Rogue is 100% in the bottom 3 of leveling classes. 
---
damn that's a top level of conspiracy...
---
my guild too tried to do that, but wasn't very good, and it ended up with drama-after-drama and of course, guild leader rapequitting into rivaling guild.
---
The ilvl it shows other players in retail is based on highest potential ilvl, meaning it includes what’s in your bags and isn’t just what you have equipped
---
Then once the community is established they can incorporate micro transactions and bank even more
---
Zero chance they will do that.
---
Fuck, my bad,  I thought that was you in this thread. I'll admit I was being a dick in that case, sorry. 
---
Currently a mixture of classic private servers in preparation of retail classic and yugioh duel links.
---
Might just stay playing it tbh, classic can be my side game.
---
Yes, the private server community have been doing the lords work for those that want to create such an addon.
---
The worst part is that it can't be broken, not without breaking DPS meters, Threat meters and boss mods. 
---
Private vanilla.
---
Personally I'd go for https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzgoZVGdIczx 
---
There are many possible variations depending on personal playstyle and gear available, like picking +15% Seal of Righteousness damage if you have spell damage gear/trinket instead of +10% STR and so on, PVP-oriented players would definetely prefer Spiritual Focus etc.
---
There is no "Universally best" Holyreckadin spec so you'll have to test and find which spec suits you the most by yourself, because people will keep telling you different stuff and all of them have their own truth.
---
I used to be under the impression that horde lock was the only way to go but I’ve since convinced myself alliance pretty much balances out with other positives. 
---
Cleanse is an incredibly powerful anti lock spell that you won’t have to deal with. Not that there are many dwarf priests, but fear ward won’t be a concern either.
---
Bop and bof are incredibly powerful when used on a warlock. 
---
Your going to be a unicorn on the server so you’ll probably have your pick of guilds. 
---
Wotf is powerful and shamans can be more of an immediate threat, but there are ways around it 
---
Its faster than paladins, priests, shamans, druids and about even with warrior.
---
Sure druid is fast around 20-40 and rogue sucks &lt;15 but druids slow way down. 
---
standing in fire = more rage
---
[removed]
---
Please keep us updated on this. It looks very promising.
---
Boy, I've never seen a post about this before. I wonder if people would like sharding in classic beyond the starter zones too.
---
Vermintide 2, Dark Souls, and Divinity Original Sin 2 are getting me through.
---
Unless you want to pretend you're Drakedog running around with a Succubus in World PvP, then alliance (gnome) warlock is better.   
---
Paladins complement a warlock amazingly with freedom and protection helping against their biggest weakness - getting blown up by melee. 
---
WotF removes one fear effect every two minutes. Paladin's cleanse is spammable and removes fear whenever they want. It also removes your DoT's.   
---
The random 1v1's you get into in a BG (when you should be using felhunter, not succubus) also aren't as bad as people make out. Warrior can remove fear anyway. You don't really cast fear against mage or warlock as they have too many ways to remove it, and getting locked on shadow should mean a loss. A rogue that opens on you should kill you WotF or not. If you do survive the opener, they often don't have their CD's in a BG situation and Gnome can coil - escape artist and kite away. Priests it matters, but then dwarf priests have fear ward. That's all the UD races..  
---
  
---
Every healer can perform well in raids the only limitation is set for druids. 1 or 2 heal druids are good in a raid but you don't want more. Priest and Palas and Schamans are always welcome.
---
Your personal skill is way more important than the class.
---
If you absolutely devote yourself to being a healer, then roll a priest. If you want to heal and occasionally do some dps then I'd say paladin. While shadow priests are great at dps, you can't expect much end game with then (aside from pvp). There IS, however, room for retribution paladins end game. 
---
It also helps that you already had a shadow priest, you know the class. 
---
It would be nice to get some updates... still from the moment that Blizzcon ended, I already expected another 6 months of no news.
---
Imagine you just killed Ragnaros but you accidentaly gave the mage T2 pants to a warlock. Loot Trading means the Warlock would be able to give this item to every other of the 39 people, preferably a mage, who were in the raid when Ragnaros died.
---
The reason I like Con Aura over focus is that I can also get Holy Shield but it's a hard one.. I'm defo aiming for spell damage gear
---
Well of course retail style gearscore would be useless in Classic, they would obviously give Classic gear score different criteria that would make it work properly.
---
There was an interview today, it's in german.
---
https://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cbs-News-PC-World-of-Warcraft-WoW-Classic-Blizzard-Interview-8388913.html
---
Hunters or rogues.  I could alt-tab Ony in vanilla as hunter and not miss much.
---
Oh man i was clueless to say the least. I don't even know i managed to make it to lvl 40. I was only 10 so being from Sweden i didn't really know great english back then.  I could only understand a little bit about the quests.  I don't think i even did that many quests. I think i just grinded mobs for the most part tbh. Now that i think about it, that's probably why i had to buy gear from the AH because i never really did many quests for rewards haha. 
---
Damn that's cool that you had adventures and stuff. My english was not that good so i didn't bother with communicating with people. I never really got into a group on my rogue. I just solo grinded. That is something i never got to do on vanilla. The whole community and friendship aspect. I've done it now on private servers and it feels great, it's not official servers you know? I think i was too young to even understand what the game was about back then. A bit of a shame i guess. But hey classic is coming back. So i will get another try haha :)
---
Sigh, this fucking thread....AGAIN. Why are people so fucking worried about this? It's not like guild leaders aren't going to know what gear you have regardless of gearscore. You won't be able to sneak into a better guild than you deserve regardless. 
---
Give me dual spec. Make it cost 1k idc
---
TBC private server, although I don't want it to burn me out.
---
Otherwise been in limbo myself. I want an mmo progressive game but everything sucks. Maybe I'll check out Rift again or SWTOR
---
Not even the same subject.
---
Whichever one has to spend the least in consumables 
---
Just curious, how is that possible if its factory sealed? Unless they'd be admitting that it's a reseal (not legal).
---
Nostalgia is definitely going to be a large part of the initial community, but a big reason we are getting classic WoW is because there is a demand for this style of game play and it's really is an important piece of video game history.
---
To me going back and playing classic WoW has a bit of the appeal that going back and replaying a favorite game of mine from years ago has.  It's satisfies the nostalgia part, but it reconnects me with why I liked the game in the first place.  I am really excited to return to this version of game, and it feels like the perfect time to relive it again.
---
I got fucked on that fight so many times.  Start to run out of Blizzard and suddenly Flamestrike pops up.  Or I get out of the AIDS and immediately get backstabbed.  G-frickin-G.  The running joke in the guild was that I was the best facedown Shaman on the server.
---
Most of those aren’t sealed anymore and they say it isn’t outright, mostly just for people that want the box for their shelf or whatever.
---
&gt;ComputerPictureGames: How far are you in developing "WoW Classic"?
---
&gt;Brian Birmingham: We were very excited to present our progress in a demo at Blizzcon and to be able to show our players the Barrens and Westfall in their classic looks again. We've shown players up to level 19 for all classes, demonstrating that this approach can work. There is still a lot of work to do, including dungeons, guilds, and the auction house. But the basic parts now fit together. We are very confident that all active "WoW" subscribers will be able to travel to "Classic" from the summer of 2019.
---
----
---
Translated further: 
---
&gt;Brian Birmingham: Non-answer with a lot of words.
---
On top of that: AOE leveling on PVP server is like an invitation to gank you.
---
Getting Holy Shield is already stepping in a dark zone and your Raid Leader won't be happy about your already clearly suboptimal Illuminationless healing spec.
---
Unless you are nicely geared/have wbuffs and nobody finds out. 
---
Very sorry, thought you meant the retail AoE loot where everyone gets a random piece of gear when a boss dies, you know
---
Here’s to hoping I am wrong, but how else can they milk it
---
Right right but you must understand a factory sealed product != a non factory sealed product. Believe it or not that lining of plastic alone increases the price by an exponential factor. It'd be like that with anything. I'm sure an original Ipod in its box is worth a few hundred dollars but a factory sealed original Ipod is worth tenfold or more.
---
mage
---
Any odd items like wolf helm/edgemaster could easily be accounted for with the algorithm (factoring in class/level/race/faction for how optimal any given item is).
---
Solve this by a day 1 hogger raid.
---
Oh you sweet summer child
---
By doing the same with TBC.
---
Right, I’m saying the last time I checked, the ones selling for $250 were non-factory sealed, key-used boxes, the actual unused, sealed boxes were in the multiple-thousands range.
---
[laughs in rogue]
---
For sure. Game design completely changed after Wrath. They introduced quality of life stuff more in Wrath, but they didn’t completely alter core gameplay at that point. Playing BC Wrath when they were live, and vanilla now on private servers I can honestly say it feels like the same game that. Has just been tweaked and balanced. When I tried to play Cata and then resubbed In Legion it felt like a completely different game. 
---
Wait I'm a moron. I read your top comment wrong -- we're both in agreeance on the same thing. My bad.
---
Gearscore sounds a lot like the "banned addons" they talked about at the blizzcon panel that "go against the spirit of the game"
---
Frankly I'm not worried
---
Hey, no worries man! I do that too from time to time.
---
Die beste Gildenhomepage aller Zeiten
---
God I'm so sick of People not understanding basic concepts in this place. They are making something for a very specific demographic that has not bought their product in years. The specific goal of this entire thing is to get back subscriptions that are long gone. This demographic even has access to this content for free, and it is just the way they want it to be.
---
If Blizzard does not deliver people will simply unsub. It's that simple. "But but on retail they don't care about what people think they do whatever they want!" Yeah because there's no option to retail. There's no other wow for those people to play, and many have never really quit. Here they are dealing with people who quit years ago, who they know that have proven if they don't like it, they will just leave and take their money with them. Blizzard wants our subs back, they know and even Activision knows that the only way to get us back is to deliver classic the way we want it.
---
You can grab Illumination and Holy Shield though
---
It has to be, teaming up is encouraged. Not to mention, imagine how much more social Modern WoW would have to be if there was no LFG/LFR, Server sharding/phasing, and a leveling journey that takes months.
---
&gt; can't explain why
---
They butchered class design, its trash. Everything fun about my specs are gone and it just feels boring
---
My two cents: I primarily play games to have fun. A secondary reason is for the challenge. Both of these things are subjective. What I find challenging in a game may be easy for some and impossible for others. However, when I started a dwarf priest, I decided from the very first level that I would become one of the best healers in the game. For me, this would be fun and challenging. 
---
Going in, I knew what I could and couldn't control. I couldn't control drop rates or my guildies own mistakes. I couldn't force anyone to run stuff with me. And even though these things can be frustrating, I focused on what I COULD control. Gaining experience with my class and learning how to be the most effective, efficient healer in a raid. Doing extensive research into spell mechanics so I could use that knowledge to push out a few more critical heals. Farming items and running 5 mans so my gear is as good as I can make it. And, most importantly, helping my friends and guildmates as much as possible so together we can win. 
---
Doing your due diligence and learning the mechanics of a game you are committing months of your life too makes sense and, as I described above, still maintains a large degree of challenge. And vanilla WoW challenges are not the same as retail. In retail, the challenge is to do the most damage possible and avoid death in dungeons and raids (is it even possible to be killed out in the real world anymore??). In vanilla, the biggest challenge by far is to get people prepared, attuned and ACTUALLY SHOW UP for 40 mans. When you down Ragnaros, it is 100% a team effort (more likely 90-95%) and your guild breaks out in joyful cries. The fight itself isn't very difficult. Molten Core is pretty basic and easy. It's the buildup TOO Molten Core. 
---
So, in short, WoW is gigantic, so large in fact, that I doubt any one player knows everything about it. Taking the time to research your faction, race, class, and abilities is absolutely worth doing since you really are only scratching the surface of the challenge that is vanilla WoW. 
---
I only played vanilla the last month before tbc so I never got close.
---
That does scratch the surface a bit lol
---
Be a Warlock and **become** the fire.
---
And even with all the available info you still have tons of decisions to make.
---
For example I'm leveling a warrior right now. At level 17, with my current weapon, against this level 15 rabid bear, is it more efficient for me to use sunder armor, rend, or both? How many times should I sunder? How much rage do I want left over for my next pull? There is plenty of nuance that even the most detailed guides are unable to cover and the player will have to feel it out for themselves.
---
It'll be difficult.  As GM you'll often be leading raids and need to be one of the more prepared players in terms of encounters.  I don't think people will be happy just 'figuring it out' when they could be 1-shotting it, get epics and then do the next encounter.
---
I'd consider maybe keeping this attitude for 5/10/15/20 man content but shelving it for 40.  Not least because MC is quite formulaic. 
---
Shaman plz need that windfury bad.
---
It took me nearly a full year to level my first character ( to 70, because tbc came out in the interim). 
---
I leveled a holy paladin, because I didn't know you could respec at max level, and was told holy was the only viable spec. Still, lived every minute of it, and plan to take my time again
---
Retail should introduce a method the player can utilize to remain in whatever shard they're currently in. Maybe a quick /noshard command that precludes shard switching for 30 minutes. 
---
Poor kitty's.... Hope shes a good healer! 
---
I was looking at all 3 of these. I might have to check one out.
---
Good luck and congrats! 
---
This is complete bull. I presume you're confused because the field of view is larger in retail than it was in vanilla. People have done [tests](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9tybxz/movement_speed_is_correct_on_the_demo/) and confirmed that there is no difference.
---
Best of luck.  Enjoy your solo time! 
---
While I have thoroughly enjoyed all three for hundreds of hours each, they are very different games and I think you should try the genre you are most familiar with first. Each is very impressive but the learning curves can be off-putting.
---
That's fair. Most of the videos I see that showcase exploits are made in an effort to draw attention to the bug.
---
One thing to seriously consider with this topic: if you are in a voice chat app in an instance, set up an emergency "record conversation" button. If blizzard uses chat logs to see what happened in their investigation, and this ninja threatened to sell it back to you over voice chat and no where else, no evidence, no exchange. 
---
I wonder if that would be the case if you are using voice chat on battle net.... Could blizzard bring up the conversation after the fact??
---
No, but it's just as overposted by people all saying the same thing. 
---
I left because of warfronts, literal trash. Also classes were butchered, feels horrible to play 
---
&gt; Wetlands were hell
---
still nothing, compared to the orc in the tunnels, at the end of Wetlands
---
Locks have to farm hundreds of soul shards before and during every raid
---
I agree with you. My hope is that people won't use them. However, as a realist, I know they will and it'll ruin the experience, then become the norm.
---
It would use the Wrath-style gearscore calculation. Blizzard revamped it to what it is now in Cataclysm.
---
Me too. 
---
Yeah ESO is a solid game, the updates have been revolutionary to how it plays
---
Gearscore was a thing before LFG was launched in Wrath.
---
Being better than 99% of the other PVPers.
---
You didn't use an add-on to calculate gear score in Wrath. A website would ping the public WoW character database to search for a player. You had to alt-tab out of the game, run the search, then return to the game. This can't be banned because it exists independently of the game.
---
This is the real problem. Not addons.
---
Currently playing Elder Scrolls Online as a single player game, Smash Bros Ultimate and will probably get back on Tree of Savior tomorrow, since they are revamping the entire class system.
---
It's all good :)
---
&gt; I see I am only a couple of kills away from 60, so I turn on my recording to get the big moment on film.
---
&gt; 
---
haha my way. guess I'll return to it...
---
&gt; It was basically 3 frames per second and so blurry you could hardly make out what was going on
---
haha, I remember balancing between quality and performance was a hard thing
---
I was recording at half resolution and 30fps. That meant, with 1280x1024, it had 512 height, and youtube downscaled it to the closest supported format, which was the so-called "HQ".
---
Those are my go-to as well. Octale and Hordak Versus the World was one but it started very late in vanilla and they transitioned it to general gaming later on. There's not much of an archive.
---
maybe if they close discord, facebook and twitter...
---
I only read a few comments and things got weird but it’s wow so I sort of assume these things would happen lol. 
---
I am very interested in something like this for when classic finally drops. I have never made it past 40 and I never did the keys thing for scholo or any raid for that matter. 
---
If your rolling alliance on USA I will be joining if possible 
---
&gt; Leveling my 23 Human Warlock through Redridge.
---
&gt; I must have been about 13 at the time and I thought this was the hardest zone in the world
---
wait, level 23 in redridge, "hardest zone in the world"?
---
I was leveling 17 in redridge because I mistakened it with Westfall XÐ
---
The original comic probably has panel 1 being an Army recruit, panel 2 being a marine, third panel being some kind of special forces, then a helicopter pilot then finally an air force guy watching TV and complaining about the smallest thing. The joke is that being in the marines is harder than army so presumably marines like shitty situations more than army personnel. Then special forces actually enjoys shitty situations so much they level the worst leveling class in the game(warrior). The pilot has it easy compared to everyone else so they're just commenting on the situation. The final panel is comparing the Air force to retail since in real life Air Force personnel have it roughly 3000% easier than every other branch.
---
yeah nail on the head, they've sucked the life out of WoW, as is most games these days. Hence the rush to remake classics because game companies are so useless these days
---
As soon as you get feared you stop shooting. So as easy as it is to hunter and you could do this on fights like the first 2 in MC and potentially win, it's not entirely possible on Ony.
---
To be fair, I'm not sure if it was better at the time or if he was just using it for flair while ganking 20/30-somethings.  Wouldn't blame him either way though =p
---
hmm i forgot about the fear. we were alliance so he did have the possibility of fear ward.
---
or he's a FUCKING LIAR
---
The first thing that came to mind, this guy sounds like Anakin. Read the first comment, exact same thought lol.
---
The moment my dwarf hunter received his bear pet, I kept him all the way through to level 60. Exactly like the dwarf in the cinematic lol. I also miss the RPG aspects like collecting ammo, feeding my pet and gaining weapon skills. The game feels needlessly stripped without it
---
This so mutch. Don't let people "fear" you out of going Alliance becaus hurr durr WoTF but not mentioning Fear Wards and Paladins.
---
Kotor 
---
What are you talking about? He is still there
---
&gt; sorry if you were planning on using the ninja looting excuse of like I totally didn't mean to click it, I guess, I guess I just have to equip it now
---
Ion, Blizzcon 2018 (Loot trading)
---
Sorry but what Ion is presenting disagrees with your belief that it would not also apply to need. 
---
Another one of my favourite memories was rushing in a massive zerg group to kill all the faction leaders. I had joined the group late and was urging the group to wait for me so I could tag the kill. The entire raid had stopped damaging and were tanking the damage waiting for me to get there, it was a random PUG as well. Amazed me. I came in at the last minute and got in an autoshot before the boss dropped
---
I only remember when I Raided orgrimmar, server started to crash, and I had to fetch my suster from the train station, so I had to leave my character in Orgrimmar.
---
Was fun to log in the next day.
---
hes lvl 120 tho
---
Get to know people and if pugging inspect in Org/IF before heading out. Problem solved.
---
GS is an oversimplification and a terrible way to evaluate players.
---
Gear score could definitely be adapted to Vanilla. It would just take the community assigning every item per class its own point value. So HoJ is worth near the max amount of points despite being a lv 55 item. 
---
I pray this never happens, but it's possible. 
---
He's just a liar. Even a full BiS hunter with just autoshot the whole time would still be bottom of the DPS by a pretty wide margin.
---
I don't think the dps checks in vanilla are that tight to require such an add on, especially in 5 mans.  It's a lot of keeping mobs CC'd and not dying to the one or two mechanics that one shot you.  
---
Vanilla had tankpoints way back then too!
---
Mages leveling is great though? They’re  like the second or third best leveling class in the game. Conjure food and water, make gold selling them, aoe mobs to grind xp efficiently, only thing better is a hunter tbh. 
---
Kinda sux that blizzard is keeping us in the dark. Other companies would be eager to show what they have been working - but blizzard is just coasting on their rep as company to sell the game.
---
Honestly, it's almost the opposite. Wotf had a big impact in the casual part of the game, almost every other horde seems to have it and you just can't rely on fear as a reliable cc. But for the upper 1% of pvp, warriors actually know how to use berserking rage, alliance priests are dwarf with fear Ward, mages counter spell fear, spriests will silence it... Basically everyone has a way to counter fear so at the upper level of pvp the alliance/horde difference isn't as noticable.
---
inspect 40 people (more Realistically like 60+) for every pug? people wont do that homie. 
---
sorry.
---
&gt;You didn't use an add-on to calculate gear score in Wrath.
---
You're right, I don't pug content period.
---
Seems an easy way to break it would be to not have an armory and disable census addon api.
---
I will puting the progress on the project and asking for our community feedback. Thank you for the  support!
---
No, he's not. He is level 80, and it was my choice to make him like that. 
---
The number of people who would want an armory would far outweigh the people who would abuse it. Which means abuse would happen.
---
Thus reducing players to a number. Sweet.
---
Thank you to all of you, I recived several great ideas for the project and support!
---
He doesn't exist as he was. I still have the same account though. I don't agree with many of the design decisions blizzard did later or everything they're up to with retail. If I have an option to play vanilla and pay for it on a sanctioned server where I'm a customer it's an obvious decision for me. Playing on a private server for the sole reason of it being free is just silly and I stand by my comment.
---
Your aoe farming spec is fantastic for dungeons, seriously, that 3/3 improved blizzard makes pulling aggro off the tank a non-issue since mobs will never reach you. Which,  if they're waddling slowly toward you while hitting no one, most of the time also translates into free damage reduction to your tank and mana for your healer.
---
Try doing it without the slow and you'll die quickly while stressing everyone out.
---
first i played on wargate and nobody used gearscore there. it was so fun! but the population was too small to PUG groups and i only ever ran kara once. other than that it was just HCs.
---
i played on icecrown after that and was really against using gearscore but after a while i broke. i didnt have the strength to stand in dalaran for 2 hours inspecting everyone only to end up having to kick 80% of them because they lacked gems/enchants, and then wipe at sourfang every time.
---
im sorry, but i think people will use gearscore.
---
LOL what do u mean u had a choice there is no vanilla lmao 
---
You are arguing for the wrong thing dude, game changing and game disappearing is two different things. 
---
Holy shit.
---
Final Fantasy 14
---
You still need to gauge youre threat, so its not like you can go balls to the walls without any care.
---
"It's not the healer that sucks, it's the dumbfuck that decided "I'm going to SIT MY DUMBASS IN THE FIRE LIKE A FUCKING DUMBASS" THAT sucks."
---
Or my personal favorite of the Tank not even bothering for a ready check, pulls the room, and I bubble hearthed out because fuck that.
---
Sure at first but after a vanish you're pretty much g2g, especially true for alliance. 
---
&lt;Working Adults&gt; [H] US-PvP
---
A little play history background, myself and about a dozen friends all played vanilla from 2004 until about 2008. During the pre BC days, many of us cleared MC, BWL, AQ40, AQ 20 and ZG. I've personally cleared 8 bosses in Naxx. 
---
BUT, we are all working adults now with a much greater time commitment to real-life, and less free time. We plan on being a semi-serious raiding and PVP Guild, but with a very structured weekly raiding schedule to allow us old farts a chance to progress without burning out. Raids will be capped to twice a week and 3 to 4 hours per raid night. 
---
We are still in the planning phase is, so no website yet, but please message me or leave a comment if you're interested in joining!
---
No beta or alpha questions? Talk about softballs!
---
A:Arms Warrior. Cause they dont get invited to raids.
---
I dont think this is true? Their gearscore was presented on their tooltip when mousing over characters.
---
Yeah i think you hit the lottery with a TF tank, its so OP
---
who knows what blizzard will change which will make vanilla crap and basically GG to ur time
---
I dont see why people are worried about this. GS was a SOLUTION to blizzards shitty raid and dungeon design, not a cause. GS has no application in Classic, I wont mind of someone makes a GS mod at all, it wont have any bearing on how groups are made.
---
It is true.
---
But they aren't selling the game...
---
Female Dwarf Rogue.  Glorious!  Especially in near full tier 2 but still using Dal'Rends swords because RNG hates me and we only ever saw 1 Brutality Blade in MC.
---
I've sunk so much time into WoW that it's hard to imagine a world or my life where it doesn't exist in some way. Still, I can't bring myself to play bfa when every spec my favorite character has is gutted to include only five or so abilities. You get absolutely nothing for leveling once you hit lvl 100 and my class actually lost so much after legion that I have to use talents to get back what I lost from my artifact. The fuck? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I also just don't like mythic plus at all. I liked it when five mans were just there to gear up for raids then you never had to look at them again. The sense of progression is just never there when the same lowbie content remains relevant forever. I wouldn't be so against the concept of m+ if the time component wasn't thrown into the mix. I have literally zero interest in optimizing the correct trash mob path. It just isn't fun to me. 
---
There's also ZERO community aspect anymore. Guilds are just totally meaningless unless you want to be a mythic raider. You can log in and do everything except for high end raids without any regard for who you're actually grouping with. I remember in the old days you would see some scrub one month then a few months later notice the same name and notice that the guy was wearing blues and maybe a couple epics and you were proud of him for advancing. Nowadays you don't even need to know anyone's name. You have no connection to your server and as a result the community is either dead or much more toxic than it used to be since you'll probably never see that guy you were a dickhead to ever again. And do you remember when someone in your guild FINALLY got that one item they were desperately wanting since forever ago? Now you don't give a fuck and aren't happy for them because wow it didn't titanforge so your buddy didn't actually get the item they wanted. 
---
The Comedian - when your wow gameplay time reads you've spent 54 out a 56 game play days were spent in the Barrens telling Chuck Norris jokes.
---
No, why? You could say that anout people valuing boes more than others, focusing on bis gear, basically everything with optimizing your play based on past knowledge.
---
Ele shaman is also pretty easy (respec after 40), as long as you have waters. You tear through mobs pretty damn fast.
---
"Low brain nonsense" :D
---
Fast movespeed, non-dependence on mana, self sustaining, escape from bad situatiosn, tank down / snare elite mobs solo, stealth to avoid ganks.
---
Druids have some hella QoL while leveling.
---
I consider myself a no-changes guy, but with prior knowledge as to the turn-ins, the War Effort will be nothing like it was in vanilla. The idea of the war effort was an excuse to bring players out into the world again (as post bwl everyone tends to sit in major cities). It also makes low level players feel apart of something on an older server, as they can contribute too. 
---
It is 100% guaranteed that the top progression guilds on your server will end the war effort in no time through massing the supplies needed. The experience of the War Effort event will be lost. This is different from say, progression guilds just clearing raid content fast because strats are known. The speed in which progression guilds clear content will really not affect the average players experience (aside from pvp) too much. Knowing the mats will destroy the experience for everyone. Randomizing(to some extent) the mats needed would help being back the original intended experience. 
---
Having said that, I don't really care either way.
---
Absolute worst part.
---
I can’t remember how I got passed him. I think I just hit spirit and hoped for the best.
---
This falls under the pseudo authentic experience of changing specifics so people have to find new ways to beat bosses and get gear etc etc. It makes total sense. But there a lot of vocal #NoChanges people who say it'll ruin wow some how. No valid argument just that it isn't blizzard-lile even though it's blizzard themselves making classic wow.
---
Reminded me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxS7eT_ky4
---
No one knows, so there is no point to talking about it yet
---
Stone skins was very effective for pvp back then too. If I'm not mistaken.
---
The point is that the War Effort won't even be an event now. Top guilds will complete the turn-ins almost instantaneously. 
---
Your analogy fails because, even though it's true that you know what gear to get--that doesn't mean you can get that gear before it's available. You can't just walk into Naxx right after you hit level 60 and get the BiS; you still have to do pre-raid gear, clear other raids, wait for Naxx to be released, etc.
---
But with the War Effort, you can just amass the materials and store them away. When the War Effort begins, it will end within minutes. There will be no 'Effort'.
---
Why'd you use today's date for aapl but all time high for nvda? 
---
At the end of the day, it does not ultimately matter. But this War Effort change (the changing of materials from known to unknown) can increase the longevity of Classic WoW by a significant amount--for little to no work (simple database changes).
---
I agree with your points, though.
---
You know what I mean. Not selling physical copy But that classic is a replica of what wow was during the vanilla era.
---
This is exactly what I’m looking for (as I’m sure can be said for many others as well). I was Ally back in the day but not opposed to rolling Horde to have a slightly different/new experience. Curious what you are thinking for raid times? 9-12EST is probably best for me so just wondering what you’re thinking. Thanks!
---
Even private servers with ridiculous populations do not finish the war effort in minutes with all the preparation and prior knowledge in the world.
---
If anything, the top pvp players are likely to go alliance due to paladins. Having a paladin on your side is better than not having to deal with WotF.
---
Flashbacks...
---
It would be so contentious and dependent on spec that it would be a little weird.
---
That would actually be better than gearscore. 
---
If someone took the time to get their optimal gear, chances are they can spam shadowbolt  and avoid standing in fire at the same time.
---
I equate it to the return to Lordran each year. It’s the repeated enjoyment of a masterpiece, and while the first time will be awe-inspiring, the following adventures are far from dull, and I still love the anticipation of the next.
---
Somewhere between Normal and Numberomancer. I use to play just to top the meters, but now (10 years later) I've grown up a bit and care more about general guild progress and having fun. But if I don't need to keep up fears or banishes, I'm going to get to the top of that dps meter!
---
Warlocks can coast through Vanilla since they are generally the lowest DPS class anyway and are always needed specifically. 
---
I stopped at 113. Wasn't worth continuing.
---
No.
---
Considering Hunters make some of the most gold at 60 I don't think we mind buying ammo TBH.
---
I’ve only seen mobs with text only when you click them, but with an enemy it’s always there
---
I'm not sure what style Wrath gear score was but it sounds like you're agreeing with me
---
Currently planning to play a Druid, Feral/Resto.
---
I’ve Raided in Classic, MC, BWL, AQ and a little Naxx (very little TBC raiding.)  As a Hunter.
---
I also raided during Wotlk and Cata.  As Resto Shaman.
---
I’d like to raid mainly on the weekends, that’s when I have the most time to play.  9pm-12am ET during the week.
---
Open to EU English speaking Guilds as well as NA Guilds.  Horde or Alliance doesn’t matter.
---
I’m open to all types of servers.
---
A mature guild would be great, I’m 30+.  Being established for a while would be awesome.
---
:)
---
I'm not. It wouldn't be worthless to min/maxers out there.
---
Yes, it's possible. However, it will take time to get to that point in terms of your Guild's progression to clear Naxx in 12 hours (or at all). I was able to raid Naxx in retail and my guild ended up killing eight bosses. It is very difficult and even knowing the mechanics like we do today, it takes a long time to gear 40 consistent people.
---
If you are willing to put in the time to level and accumulate gear, are willing to pass some loot to more consistent guildies because they do put in more time, and are willing to farm for consumables so that you're ready at each raid, then yes it's doable. But it'll take work. And probably like 2 years.
---
He makes a lot of very good points. 
---
Keep in mind it's possible Naxx won't come until 18 months after release (same as Vanilla), which would be winter 2021.
---
I don't think a guild raiding 3 nights a week would be able to clear Naxx, but they could take down a few wings.  Only like 0.1% of raiding guilds cleared Naxx.
---
Unless you're a omega no life neck beard. Don’t worry about it. I had no issues playing Alliance Warlock and got to rank 11. 
---
Just go for it
---
Private servers have been running for years and haven't had population issues. The game is good enough to retain players. The majority of people will never run out of content.
---
Most popular opinions seem to be separate TBC and Wrath servers later on, and/or seasonal servers. But this was already discussed yesterday, and the day before... and the day before that. Let's wait til we get our hands on Classic before we get too ahead of ourselves.
---
If you are somehow able to collect gear from BWL / AQ40 because your guild is going to carry you for no apparent reason, and someone is giving you enough money to buy raid consumables and to repair your gear and get you the enchants on the gear you need, and you are somehow in a guild that is actually progressing, the answer is still no.
---
Ok definitely didn't get that
---
There is a few fights where he could potentially win, like Garr where the rest of the DPS is running between adds and then in and out on the main boss. He could just autoshot the main boss and as stupid as it would be, he would be pretty decent on the meters.
---
Or Baron if he stood away from the main group and didn't get hit with a bomb.
---
Either way, Hunters in good gear with no rotation will not be over 200dps... which is way less than anyone who isn't trash on any bosses in MC
---
Too ahead of ourselves? It's not like its a problem that will or will not arrive, it's being realistic.
---
The same could have been said for 07scape and yet look at it now, it is far more popular than rs3
---
It certainly isn't about nostalgia for me. I just played a private server for two years and loved it. The game is simply better in vanilla than it is in retail. Even if I didn't play vanilla when it was released I would still prefer the game as it was than as it is now. 
---
07scape is a fundamentally different game than classic wow. Anyone can get to the end content how 07scape was originally, it just took enough time. 
---
Retail babies are downvoting this video lol  
---
It is harder to reach the end game of that than it is to reach the end game of classic wow. 
---
The level of grind is not comparable 
---
For me, it's less nostalgia than it is that WoW Classic is a better game. It was balanced (or unbalanced) in such a way that required stricter play style, more cooperation, and thus more satisfying rewards. I think people will enjoy it more and retention will based on why they loved it the first time. 
---
07scape is a solo game, classic wow requires 39 other players. Apples to oranges.
---
Just ui stuff, original classic seemed to make every effort to hide information from you, and you had to circumvent that with alot of add-ons. The modern ui eliminates the middle man and if very nice to have.
---
There is no such limitation for Druid’s. People who have only played on PS will be in for a rude awakening when they are in MC with four Druid’s for the first time.
---
I agree it is better, but what would be better would be to play through it all.. it'd be amazing.
---
arguably classic to WOTLK is the best experience you could have. I could imagine a year long season where it goes through the three.
---
“who chained the vael cleave and wiped all the melee?”
---
Still is annoyingly, not sure what's up with that
---
I'll just stand in the fire for a few seconds it will be fine \*Dies\*
---
I'm gonna be the buzzkill but I main healer and PUG a lot (100+ 10-14 timed keys and like 20 15+ keys), I often have my DPS stand in shit and die but I rarely take the blame for that *shrugs*
---
Gear score is useless in Vanilla anyways, because you can some inspect someone and tell right away how good their gear is. Items are way more unique in Vanilla and its easy to tell how geared someone is without needing a gear score.
---
I worry about this too. Private servers are a terrible representation of what will occur for one simple reason: we do not know how long a unique player continues to play the same account. I played on three private servers over 5 years, as an example. 
---
Getting burned out is a real concern and there's really only 2 ways to address it:
---
1. Allow players to progress to a separate BC/Wrath server. This will likely be what they will do. It just comes down to how popular classic is. 
---
2. Expand the vanilla content. Talking mount hyjal, emerald dream, etc. while keeping the content level 60. This is.... unlikely. The last thing blizzard would want to do is alienate their live player base and this would do that. Allowing new content to classic subscribers would be like a slap in the face UNLESS both were expanded at the same time replicating the experience. 
---
They had an excellent opportunity to “Are we there, yeti?” in this article. Shame.
---
Ask yourself the same question. Also yes we know how much WoW has made with microtransations that don't include subs.
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-made-4-billion-on-microtransac/1100-6456669/ 
---
Incoming people complaining about "elitist raiders".  He makes a perfect point about not being entitled to view content just because you bought the game.  In BC I felt like it was an accomplishment to be invited to a top server guild raiding BT, and the reason I got there was because I knew how to play my class and played the hell out of the game.  As he says, that sense of accomplishment has had a giant shit taken right over it.
---
It's kicking my ASS because I've been playing on a private server and having so much fun.
---
I can't wait for summer
---
A fairly common ninja looting scenario back in the day was people calling for everyone to pass on a drop to talk about it, and someone going "oops I greeded" after everyone else passed.
---
Honestly it will be hard to get in a hardcore raiding guild that only raids for 12 hours a week. Your best bet would be to put in 20+ until it gets on farm status, THEN you can dial it back
---
I’m probably going to jump one one about a month or so before launch so I can re-familiarize myself with the controls and /commands, but I want to put off the experience for as long as I can so it’s that much sweeter when it’s finally here 
---
The first time I ever saw a fully geared level 60. There were two of us questing in Duskwood and there was a troll shadow priest looking badass on his mount with his cool matching gear.  We started slowly backing up a few feet at a time, one by one, hoping he wouldn't see us, until we reached some bushes where we hid for like 15 minutes until he went away, convinced he was going to attack at any time.  I was not on a PvP server or flagged for PvP so there was literally nothing he could have done to us.  He was probably watching the whole time like wtf are they doing.  
---
WoW's Achievement system isn't a harmless system at all, they're intentionally designed to fuel addiction and give you a sense of sunk cost to compel you to play more, same thing with dailys and especially reputation grinds tied to dailys.
---
Frankly if you're logging on or doing something in the game, it should be because you want to be doing it, not because you feel compelled to be ticking off largely trivial/pointless but time consuming achievements.  
---
The only people that seem to think it's a compelling idea are people who are already have the sunk cost feeling from retail WoW and don't want classic to be a separate game entirely. 
---
I reached somewhere around lvl 12...
---
Same here, I still obsess about the numbers a bit, but in more of a fun way. Min/maxing, theorycrafting, but I never take myself too seriously.
---
Not at all. Much more mages on Horde and you counter them as much as any class. If Decursive is allowed paladins are the biggest counter to be honest. If you lose to Warrior or rogue on a Lock with an actual pvp spec you are simply bad. 
---
Lets be real here, this community is so polarized that virtually any news will generate outrage. They are well aware of this and so have taken the smart route of keeping us in the dark. I absolutely don't blame them. 
---
I had to make a notepad file of al the locations of controls /bindings since they are so different from live
---
Thanks, I'm super stoked about this one. A real chick who enjoys her own personal space and likes to game with me.
---
Oh, I hadn't thought about that. I'm leaning towards no battlemasters. I want the real feel of queing at the BG. I think it would add a different element to it and make it more of a time investment, vs being able to que then go craft or play the AH.
---
I believe that's the proc from Quel'serrar.
---
Holy Paladin and Elemental/Resto Shamans you raid for gear. If you want PvP healer gear that is awesome play Priest. 
---
Rank 14 is kind of a waste of time with Benediction sitting there in Molten Core as well. 
---
BFA:  Big F’ing Activision
---
This is exactly what I’m looking for as well. Similar backstory to yours only I’ve only played Alliance. Playing horde on classic will make the experience even better for me. Let me know how to join up. 
---
I've been playing EverQuest 2, because I started playing EQ2 November of 2004 instead of WoW. I had to pick one of the two to play and went with EQ2 at the time. Eventually quit and switched to WoW and January 2005. 
---
So, playing EQ2 classic server and will quit it again to switch to Classic WoW :)
---
I'm so happy I can read german!  The interview with the developer is interesting.
---
This is pretty close to a real spec people play. This is from the "Classic PVP" Discord
---
&gt; Trispec. Requires a decent amount of gear to keep urself sustained, recommended for 3 priest comps on horde and offensive priest play on alliance side.
---
&gt;  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusmZf0tZVMgu0d
---
Been working on something with others in this sub.  
---
This might be something for my troll PVP build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrsbbZbhtZVMgz0t 
---
    
---
This build covers alot of core abilities. Blackout + shadowguard &amp; swp, silence, lvl 1 Nova for invis, imp Mana burn, extra inner fire armor, and matyrdom/healing focus.   
---
I understand the spell reduction in your build, but armor is where it is at. Being able to reduce meled damage is your best bet. Also being annoying as fuck with Mana burn is fun too. I'm only going this build cause of troll shadowguard though, I don't know what I'd build otherwise
---
I love the old graphics, but I also love the freedom of choice.
---
I don't see a problem with a client side toggle, of they did it right. 
---
Either way, the blessing of protection animation will still have that stupid giant crown with wings graphic that I hate with a passion.
---
I'm not sure you raided in vanilla.
---
If you did, you'd know that the smaller server community, lack of LFR, and dungeon finder means that you'll get to know people you can pull from for your groups. It also means at a certain point a guild tag becomes a badge of skill and credibility, because guilds recruiting for the harder raids don't want their credibility trashed by a player with a bad rap.
---
If you're the type of raid leader who is uncertain and needs to inspect themselves you've got entirely different problems.
---
12 hours a week is fine for raiding, assuming your 12 hour window lines up with your guilds raid schedule. However, it will not be enough to get consumables for those raids. To progress in naxx you'll need a mountain of pots and elixirs and flasks. You'd need to anticipate wiping 20 times over a 4 hour night, 3 days a week for 4 - 8 weeks (or longer) depending on your guilds experience level. So either stockpile that or you'll need more time to get what you need each week. 
---
But like someone else said, naxx is a year or two away after release so your schedule is likely to change. 
---
Also, pre-naxx gear comes from other raids or from very involved rep grinds. Those also won't be available at launch. 
---
If you want a class you don't have to think about to DPS or work hard on choose Mage, Lock. They are both as good as rogue 1 v 1 and better in BG's. Mage has a much higher skill cap than the usual Soul Link Lock spec though. So if you don't want to think in PvP? Choose Lock.
---
Hunters are actually the highest skill cap ranged in raids and also rely on a swing timer with their autoshot. In PVP their best BG specs are also highly skill based.
---
Daggers is not a good option in 1.12. It was in real Vanilla because Swords did not have buffs they will have in 1.12. In patch 1.8 or 1.9 Sinister strike can proc sword specialization. To be honest **anyone recommending people play rogue as a first timer are either trolling you or have no idea what patch this is, what it does with class balance in pvp etc. The two classes I would not touch as a new player raiding is Rogue, Warrior.** Not because they aren't good, but because they are the hardest classes to get a raid spot with and the most competitive for that spot. You will have an extreme struggle even getting 5 man gear on a rogue,let alone a raid spot as a new player.
---
Melee are NEVER easy mode in PVE. You have to worry about positioning, threat more than ranged usually, and they almost always have harder rotations or at least rotations where doing things wrong screws you. They are also much more gear dependent on pre raid bis and it's much harder to get in Vanilla. You can take a mage (due to hit talents) and get some boe tailor crap and some greens and do "ok" dps in a raid. On a rogue/warrior you have to buy Devilsaur that can cost 1/4 to 1/4 the price of an epic mount
---
Im so bored of people dismissing classic wow with bs words like nostalgia and "rose tinted glasses". 
---
Its not our fault yall were 5 when the game came out.
---
Not if you go balance.
---
r/wow reaction to this video is like terminally ill organism's reaction to the cure, or a severe alcoholic's reaction to the treatment. I can't even properly describing it with words, it's just so bizarre.
---
This guys basically says everything that is wrong with the game in a very consize, staightforward and well argumented way. It all seems so obvious to me, and yet everyone in retail is in complete denial.
---
Their stance is "yeah bfa have some problems but overall things are fine". 
---
Any interesting bullet points?
---
If they based gearscore purely off ilevel it would be useless for Classic but if they make a gearscore for classic it won't be based off ilevel
---
This is a good spec. But I thinking about it more I would take all points out of Improved Mindblast and put them in Shadow Focus instead. I can't see myself spamming MB enough to care about a lower CD. 
---
Why frost bolt over fireball? I feel like it does way more damage 1-20 at least. I’m only 15 right now. 
---
After doing some research, I would rank the leveling as:
---
1. Hunter
---
2. Warlock
---
3. Shaman
---
4. Druid
---
5. Mage
---
6. Priest
---
7. Warrior
---
8. Rogue
---
9. Paladin
---
Agree/Disagree?
---
I don't play priest and it's not my spec, go debate Howfeel on discord.
---
Did people use ventrilo then?
---
The wrath hear score add-on was based on the stats and your class, rather than ilvl. It still wasn't perfect, but it was better than pure ilvl. I still hated it though. 
---
Go horde lock if you hate pve. Locks have the most ridiculous threat in the game, and even as alliance with pallies salvation, you will constantly have to hold back on dmg.
---
Playing horde lock in raids you might as well afk.
---
They won't have trouble maintaining a playerbase. It would be very interesting to know what their target numbers / expectations / projections are for lauch, 2 week,s 2 months, 6 months, 1 year + etc are. 
---
I kind of think they are looking at this like an experiment, will it have a huge following? Is this what people want?
---
They could even potentially be using as a testing ground for how to make a new mmo. What can we take from classic and retail. 
---
hmm - I played with a big group of people from GR Michigan.  What high school did you go to?
---
These types of antagonistic videos are part of the problem with retail wow.
---
Blizzard think we’re spoilt children.
---
T1/2/3 were not made for DPS warriors, but for prot/tanking. 
---
If you want DPS, you will have to look at their other gear sets, and lots of non-set items. 
---
Frostbolt is more mana efficient, and then the talents in Frost make it way better. You get a pretty significant chance to freeze your target in place on frost spell hit, so a free Frost Nova, but after that, you can get talents that give you an extra 50% chance for a crit when using a Frost spell on a frozen target. And Frost just gives you so much more safety to take on multiple mobs and you have more tools for escape. Fireball does do more flat damage but you also have to take cast time into account. 
---
What I have done at that level is at least open with frostbolt for the initial slow and then use fireball. But yeah, eventually frostbolt becomes just too good with talents to not use.
---
I got to 60 but it took me a while and I stayed at 59 for the longest time because I liked the 50 59 battlegrounds. I ended up not really raiding much so I wouldn't have lost much by staying at 59, though the 60 battlegrounds were fun too.
---
Just imagine working there knowing that the only product you have that people give a shit about is one released 15 years ago and was built by people not even at the company anymore. If I worked for actiblizz I would be jumping ship as soon as possible.
---
1 year to go through vanilla, tbc, and wrath? What are you smoking? With how long it took to get attuned to each raid, gear checks, drop rates on necessary gear...I don’t see how you would get the real experience. Now if your talking a year for each expansion.....maybe but you run into the problem where only .1% have actually completed everything 
---
play on p server cause its prob gonna be closer to vanilla than blizzard classic 
---
Yes, raiding in classic will be a lot more like raiding on private servers than original vanilla. Semi hardcore guilds will clear naxx because they will know how to farm BWL and AQ and there will be a lot more 60's per server. Most guilds will clear molten core in two-three months after launch and will farm it for 9-12 months. They will clear BWL after 4-6 weeks and will farm it for 6-9 months. AQ will take longer and only be farmed for 2-4 months before Naxx is dropped. I would imagine that your semi hardcore guild will be able to clear it in 2-3 months with 1 night of farming and two nights of progression. This will leave you three hours a week to farm consumables and get ready for raid. This might not be a popular opinion, but I still believe it to be accurate.
---
The weekend event battlemaster should appear but not the regular ones.
---
One of the cooler things about classic is that a trained eye can tell what you're wearing without even needing to inspect, let alone run a script to inspect for you.
---
If you could reduce players to one number in classic it would be *40-man-raid-fail-ratio*. There is however, no consensus threshold for what constitutes a fail. 
---
Well you have to remember most of the people still playing the game are those low investment players he describes. They are a reflection of what the game has become.
---
I find it very difficult to not want to place the blame heavily on Ion for the shortcomings of wow. I think he is one of the most obnoxious and  unlikeable personalities I have ever seen. I am very surprised his name doesn’t come up more often in this discussion of the decline of wow. 
---
Eww LFG icons
---
It is for me and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
I LOVED battlemasters, theres something about all gathering around the war table in IF to queue for PVP, or grouping up in the halls of SW castle
---
If they keep true to classic (vanilla), it will take a couple years before a handful of guilds are actually farming Naxx. I'd love to see BC again too, but I hope they wait and actually let people experience the content before rushing BC and making raid gear obsolete. They rushed to BC in vanilla with less than 0.1% of the player base having cleared Naxx, I hope they let at least 15%-20% of people at least clear a couple Naxx bosses before an expansion. 
---
Did you find a guild?
---
That's fun too though! Most of the time I would just hang out because sometimes you want to switch BG's anyway, it gives the city more life, another reason to be there other than just the AH and bank
---
Your Shadow Tree is exactly what I would do, having considered it more. 
---
I understand what you're saying about Blessed Recovery, I wasn't sure about it anyway. But I would think Improved Renew would be useful given how important that instant hot is and how often it would use it. Also, not seeing the usefulness of Divine Fury. This build, for me, is a kind of hybrid between healing, and dmg. So, I'm not going to be standing around casting a lot of 2.5 sec heals, that just takes too much time. I'll be throwing hots and dispels to mates, and on the dmg side SWP, Silence, occasionally Mind Blast (also helps Blackout proc), lvl 1 nova (like you said). plus dispel (defensively). Haven't really thought much about Improved Mana Burn, have to consider that. Does MB add to the Blackout proc? I guess it would. 
---
Anyway, I feel like Spell Warding is more useful than Divine Fury given how many mages, locks, priests, ele shamans there are in pvp. 
---
so on the weekend a battlemaster would appear in vanilla?
---
Right, the point is that that used to happen at the battleground portals themselves in Arathi Basin, Hillsbrad Foothills and Ashenvale instead of SW and IF.
---
Yeah. For example for warsong gulch weekend there was a Watson emissary in .org that would allow you to que.
---
I would've been fine with if wow was f2p at this point, 
---
Before the battlematers the areas would frequently break or in to massive wpvp because you always had people there sitting on their hands waiting for bgs to pop
---
There are as many types of wow players as there are people playing wow.
---
There's no pugs formed from scratch in Vanilla. It's more like you got 20 guildies that wants to go in (therefore "hosted by %guildname% runs), then you've got 10 more people from your friendlist who already proved themselves before, and THEN, when it comes to last 10, you PuG.
---
Does this really happen on private servers? If so I’m excited then that I don’t have to be hardcore to raid naxx.
---
The thought wasn't that we would see it intentionally, but rather that some items that are being ported from 7.3.5, the devs would forget to correct.
---
Whoops, opened mine back in 2004. Hope I can at least run around with my little zergling pet.
---
Do you have a link to the classic PVP discord?  I've been trying to find it, but the links I've seen have expired.
---
Only if they found a way to buy back enough stock to make their own decisions. 
---
Going to have a group of 3 or maybe 4 people looking for a good raiding guild with pvp.  Looking for US times - Horde or ally.   We all played vanilla original, numerous expacks and even played private vanilla progression servers up to nax.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGcK63HU66k
---
Maerad says no
---
Bungie was an independent company with a shitty publishing contract. Blizzard is a fully integrated part of Activision / Blizz and is completely under its control.  All we can do is hope for the best.
---
Wow 
---
Would crowdfunding be a viable way to make something like that to happen?
---
Well I will be rolling my Orc Lock because stun resistance is better to have than WOTF
---
https://discord.gg/SsZAZ3z
---
Also when using a database, search for supply officer or battlemater to see the other pvp items that aren't involved in sets. You'll find different armor, weapons, and consumables.
---
While the overall video is pretty good, he is misleading about his experience. Given he talks about Devilsaur wars, speed runs, and how "most raiders" will be bringing flasks to raid shows he's a private server "vanilla" player, which was drastically different from retail vanilla.
---
Alliance Locks are stronger than horde in PvE due to expansive mind (and Pally support) while Horde Locks are stronger in PvP with WotF (and Shadow Resistance). WotF is arguably the best PvP racial in the game but Escape artist isn't that bad. It all depends on what you want to do more of but imo the difference isn't huge either way.
---
Oh, well I wouldn’t assume that anything broken will go unfixed for long, especially considering that they are currently using a working 1.12 client with original 1.12 data as a cross-reference for Classic. 
---
Not unless you’re going to crowd fund billions
---
Thanks!
---
So, just a little history for ya here:
---
AV and WSG were introduced in 1.5.  Battlemasters to queue for them were introduced in 1.6, roughly one month later.  AB was added in 1.7, along with its own battlemaster.
---
In the history of WoW, there was *one* very frustrating month where you had to fly around the world to queue for a battleground, and the introduction of battlemasters was almost universally praised as a massive QoL improvement.
---
You *could* fly out there to queue (and many people did, since the reward vendors were there), but it wasn't a requirement.
---
I love the passion people have for keeping it old school difficult, but this is a particularly strange one.  People fucking *loathed* it back then, and they'll fucking *loathe* it today. 
---
Too deep on the banner bull man, other than that good video.
---
Remember, it isn't just gold.
---
Hunter soloing screws the enchanting/consumable markets and inflates gold
---
Aoe farming DM inflates gold. Herbs plummet. Once people are more geared Rich Thorium at the end of the instance tank prices on arcane crystals.
---
I'm worried for the economy.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxoGs0bZbhtZVMgzcd
---
(Points in imp renew of holy specialzation is up to you. Renew is more mobile which is good, holy spec is more thru-put and dps - helping you burst a low target or solo quest / farm as needed)
---
Shadow Reach would be better than shadow weaving. 6% of your shadow damage is insignificant, but the extra range to keep enemies snared with mindflay can keep that warrior at 6m instead of 5.
---
More points in shadow focus would be better than imp mind blast helping cover shadow res gear / buffs. Missing a scream is means you die.
---
I can't see myself passing up healing focus, yes its redundant with Martyrdom but resisting interruption is huge and I'd rather be safe than sorry.
---
Are you planning to hard cast at all? Divine fury ups your HPS and DPS by a huge amount, I'm sure its more valuable than magic damage mitigation.
---
Imp Mana burn is something you want to get for sure, it lets you easily solo any other healer, seriously hampers hybrids and lets you potentially 1v1 mages.
---
Last 2 points I'd probably put into blessed recovery, but its flexible.
---
2c.
---
there was this halo forger who also got into level design and stuff and got a job at treyarch i think and i think bungie too. he said a misconception is that activision ruins the game and he says they are really hands off that its the developers fault for destinys inadequacies (never played it but this is what he says) i have a feeling blizzard would bad without activision too
---
Also recruit people that level the same speed as you. No one wants to be lvl 60, watch the people they leved with and ran their prebis with raid mc while their mt/guild lead is lvl 40. If this happens you will bleed a lot of 60 members toguilds that already started raiding.
---
I likely wouldn’t do much PvP if I have to fuck around going to ashenvale to queue for WSG as alliance. 
---
World PvP doesn’t interest me much, especially when it revolves into people randomly spamming AoEs so that aspect of travelling around isn’t a good side effect for me.
---
I hope you're right
---
Not having played the game before is not a huge disadvantage. The main difference between "noobs" and skilled players is that the skilled players are always making an effort to get better. A lot of the new players, especially from retail, will be looking up guides and stuff and try to min/max everything. Even though they haven't played this content before. And then there's people who will just play the game and have no idea what they are doing. And everything in between. 
---
I can't do that without within a day getting a call saying my internet will be shut down forever if I don't uninstall.
---
Well, it would have to figure out the characters spec first then, as that often decides whether an item is bis or not. 
---
wat
---
The pre patch to TBC the pvp system was changed. Honor and bg badges became a currency to turn in for the pvp pieces, so you didn't have to do the rank grind. 
---
Pretty sure it was implemented in the later days of vanilla as a catch up mechanic and get people used to the TBC changes that were coming since you played on it for about a month until the dark portal actually opened. But it's how the pvp system was in tbc. 
---
A lot of good points - though I wonder why you think mage's are more plentiful on horde when I've found them to be far more plentiful on alliance (the whole, not facing gnomes and paladins thing).
---
Chill dude, it's a joke!  Read it again :p
---
Ferahgo here - Old Frostman/Frostwolf VC member 
---
Does anyone have Stewballs contact info they could DM me?  Have been wanting to sync back up with him and Taunie for some hot MMO action these days.  
---
Lost contact with almost everyone from that guild since it's been about 15 years, it would be great to reconnect with those guys.  Especially since I have finally published some old clips that have been sitting on my hard drive for well over a decade now.  Please help me get this to him!  - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpafoIL\_u5c&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpafoIL_u5c&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
When you say the mage PVE spec is awful at PVP, are you talking about frost mages? How are they awful at PVP? Or did you mean to say raiding because that I can agree on.
---
Greetings, FriendlyFyre\_tv, if you're interested in a raiding project, you can join our Discord so we can have a talk about it.   [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) 
---
I think blizz should say they’ll be different but then not change them. That way people won’t stock up on them and it’s still blizzlike
---
yes. there was an interview like, today or yesterday. 
---
Screw the lifetapping Warlock, the dps warrior better utilizes the health to resource generation conversion.
---
LOL This is unfortunately true. Basically, this interview tells us nothing. 
---
SL lock is not nearly as good as you seem to think without insane amounts of shadow/spell dmg on gear.
---
Yeah you're kind of forced into raiding as a paladin if you want to heal. The raid gear is just better for pvp healing in every single way, I have no idea why paladins PVE raid gear has more stam than it's pvp healing gear.
---
If you want to gear via PvP, you have to play a ret paladin/hybrid ;/
---
Really, really, REALLY annoying.
---
there was this like 50 year old guy at work who would always tell me how awesome his new green he got from a quest when a new expansion would come out. he would start laughing and looking at me and shaking his head and go dude you wotn beleive this i got this new sword from a quest and it does like FIVE THOUSAND DAMAGE. HOLY CRAP IM SO POWERFUL ITS SO INSANE BLIZZARD REALLY DID IT THIS TIME. this is what people think is awesome about retail. 
---
CPG: How far along are you on the game?
---
BB: We are working on it and hopefully it will be ready by summer 2019
---
Move along, nothing to see here...
---
Suppression room is the most boring thing in fucking existence for a rogue. It's hardly a responsibility. 
---
Piston is up, \*click\*, /sleep, wake me up in 30s.
---
not retail vanilla but on a private server we were all leveling in stv when this level 60 druid is ganking us. well 5 of us level 35s teamed up on him and actually killed him. was really funny
---
Ugh, he might have good points but damn is he obnoxious. He needs to take a chill pill.
---
ahhh yes the Warrior/Shaman cluster fuck. Both classes want the shoulders/helm/leggings, shamans want the axe. I started just grabbing 3 warriors and 2 shamans for every group and zerging it. No need to even try and find a mage. No one else wanted to run it unless they were doing it 1 time for their quest.
---
What an experiment. You are really testing the limits of human capability here!
---
After 24 months release a small update, only add a Karahzan raid, with tuned down gear and bosses that will lead guilds that have cleared Naxx. If that works out maybe a unfinished zone that will be patched. Keep talking to the community, learn from mistakes each patch and just add fun and epic quests. 1 Horde zone 1 ally zone and a combined one filled with outdoor group content.don’t raise the level cap
---
Grim Batol rework that fits vanilla style raiding. Maybe we need an Uldum Patch first. 
---
3rd year Add Blood Elves, Draenei and other races but don’t give each faction a shaman or paladin. Time to level once more! With new starting areas with slight different stories. Never make a shared city we need to kill each other on sight and not get used to be inline of sight of the enemy
---
Cavern of times can host different Hall of Fame raids for seasonal patches not to drop gear that is superior to what drops elsewhere but just a vanilla raid or an event played out in other expansions.  High skill ceiling not so great gear, just for a certain color theme on existing tiersets 
---
Let’s first make this 24 months a success, I know Blizz employees left, but the once who are currently working at blizzard, where once true fans of the same vanilla as we did. I think it can be a success,
---
I hope this could be a turning point a lesson for many developers to take matters into their own hands and stop the destructive path they walked down to with Cashshops and MTX. 
---
We also need to make this a success to prove that we are right. Make this game a success for 2 years and that will give us enough insight if all that I am preposing is the right path to follow.
---
Hatebeard going to main a troll shaman! 
---
FOR THE HORDE!!
---
Think it will resemble old Vanilla pop more than private. Bad and new mages have a hard time dealing with shamans (they don't use rank 1 fbolt, blizzard and kill totems or use multiple spellschools) and shamans are really OP early if you have a bad player vs a bad player. Private has a lot better players than retail will on average as well. Most of the Paladins will be Ret not Holy (look at popular content creators as an example). Just like most of the Shamans will be enhance (even though elemental is great). 
---
But yeah mage probably has a better life on Alliance if playing with premades and Holy Paladins. The racial is also nice in mirrors on gnome. WOTF helps against spriest/lock. Gnome and Undead are both great choices. 
---
Decursive is going to be big imo. It's the main reason Alliance are just stronger in group. Probably a lot of internal discussions about the addon. 
---
All these people claim they are going to play warriors and on Private they do it (and a lot give up in the 50's due to not wanting to tank). You know what's going to happen on Retail though. They are going to run into that Murloc camp around level 10 and then you are going to see them reroll ret paladin just like before. 
---
On Horde the Murlocs in the undead area are same way. Orc/Troll area it's that troll island. Just watch some of these content creators Classic Demo videos and that about sums up how bad these people are going to be. 
---
You are kind of a young guy and a great mage, but we saw all this happen before and it will happen again.  Private is a like a vertical slice of a vertical slice. Most players are going to look like this. Not to put the guy down or anything. He simply doesn't know how to play these old style classes. He has a BIG audience. EU might be a little different. They seem to be a more hardcore audience. I'm from NA. Not putting down my country or anything, I just remember how bad people were in real vanilla.  It was actually hilarious. You are gonna have a blast on a mage. :)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHqNyzAv3SU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHqNyzAv3SU)
---
That.. was not my argument so I will try to explain it in a way someone like you might understand.
---
1. I played during Vanilla.
---
2. My argument is that after 3 years of the same fucking content, what happens to a game? It dies.
---
Nothing. 
---
During my big MMO phase I quit vanilla WOW on and off all the time and picked up right back where I left off and kept progressing. It felt like a single player RPG progression wise, was nice.
---
Current WOW you take a break, and then you have to get "caught up" - it's  awful.
---
1 thread = all of the players. Seams legit 
---
Playing on the Alliance back in the day, I had no idea that shamans wanted the axe. Makes sense though.
---
For the life of me, I can't remember what our 3rd dps was, but it was probably another warrior or paladin for that reason.
---
You must be a casual player who needs to play a completely different game every 5 minutes or their ADHD drives them up the wall.
---
 
---
Need to play the new shiniest game every time one is released! 
---
Pretty sure he meant raiding. I know from experience you nees different specs not just for PvE and PvP, but also for gold farming. For raiding, you should run without ice barrier and with PoM if you are winter chill specced, or full out on arcane with arcane power if not. For farming you want imp. Blizzard. Most people would say a single frost mage spec should do it all well, but it's not the case unfortunately.
---
Only need one mage in the raid that goes deep frost for winter's chill (and that spec still misses things for PvP). Usually the worst geared. The mage PVE spec for tier 1 and 2 is arcane frost without shatter. 
---
17/0/34 is not bad at PVP at all though. It's fine in 5 mans. Us mages only went the other spec on raid nights. Same with the fire spec when we could finally go that. Good thing about mages is farming gold is really easy solo.  If you aoe level, you make some good money doing that as well. Farming money on some classes solo really isn't all that viable outside gathering. You have jump runs and stuff you can do though. You could also run instances on healer/tanks. 
---
Mage has a really high quality of life in Vanilla. It's a very good choice. You WILL have to dedicate some time to learning pvp though. It has a high ceiling. It's very fun though. :) Mage also starts kind of weak. They really start to hit their stride around 20. A lot of classes are like this though. People think druids suck for leveling due to the Classic Demo, but when they get cat form they are one of the best, if not THE best on a pvp server. 
---
If they start using gearscore in classic, I'll bust an anuerism.
---
I'm trying to have a conversation with people about easy to get chests. It's not that complicated but you failed to grasp that and took the time to be toxic instead.
---
Not sure of your point honestly? There’s a plethora of publicly available information if you wish to invest the time to learn.. how exactly are you stealing?
---
&gt;Bad and new mages have a hard time dealing with shamans (they don't use rank 1 fbolt, blizzard and kill totems or use multiple spellschools) and shamans are really OP early if you have a bad player vs a bad player.
---
That's actually very fair and it's something I've talked about on stream when people ask "ARENT SHAMANS A PROBLEM FOR A MAGES THO?"
---
And you hit the nail on the head- if you throw a mage and a shaman who aren't in the top 5%, the shaman is almost always going to win.
---
I'm glad I asked ty for the thoughtful response.
---
Same brother, I can't wait for classic to release.
---
locks and hunters are on a different level then feral 
---
T is the default for auto attack, no need to put it on the bar
---
I’d like to engage in those activities this time around 
---
And a "taking a sword to the face while being yelled at in Turkish" enthusiast. But I second this, KCD is fantastic. I got it during the Steam Winter Sale for like 30 it have been so happy with it. 
---
Theoretically, if wow was rebooted, meaning not just remade. I'd keep about everything that's in vanilla and slap newaged class design and mechanics without pruning. That's probably what I'd do, as much as I detest retail I think it definitely has an upper hand in raid and class mechanics, especially back in MoP or WoD to some extent where classes has more spells as they do now.
---
I didnt even play in vanilla.
---
Im sure thats how things were back then. Im not convinced thats how they'll be now. If you want to convince me you'll have to be more persuasive than that.
---
Id be thrilled if you were correct though. Id love a world with no gear score addons.
---
Makes sense. Crossing my fingers youre right.
---
On a different note: sounds like i should pick up alchemy if 1 flask equals an entire t8 set.
---
Your giving them too much credit. Blizzards just doesn’t communicate with the fans anymore. They keep promising they will, but if they did then BFA wouldn’t be this way and femtauren mouths would close.
---
It's a lot of stuff we've already heard, but some interesting points are how the devs talk about using the original client for reference for even minute details.
---
For instance, one of them mentions testing charge to see if the actual charge itself puts you &amp; the enemy in combat, like it does on the modern client, but it turns out that in classic charge actually only toggles your autoattack, and only when you swing at a target does it put you in combat.
---
Another one that is mentioned is when exactly the pet of a warlock despawns when you summon a new one. A lot of people reported it should be the end of the cast, but when they doublechecked it using the reference client, it turns out that in classic your pet instantly despawns the moment you start summoning a new pet.
---
The rest of the interview is just a lot of reminiscing and stuff you heard at Blizzcon.
---
As far as im aware fury warriors are up there on the dps ladder, so i'd say just about as hard as a rogue or a warlock/mage. I'd definitely wouldn't be breaking a sweat about these things if I were you, especially when raids and 40 man there's plenty of spots to go around. And im 100% sure people will be pugging and clearing raids also.
---
Play what you want don't worry about spots it definitely won't be a problem.
---
Which part of Blizzard? The Overwatch team is extremely communicative. 
---
Fury can be a little rougher to find a raid spot. You’re very reliant on gear. I’d suggest finding a good guild for you and let them know you plan on dpsing as a warrior in raids. You should still tank dungeons while leveling and getting some pre-bis.
---
Pre-raid 5mans and UBRS will be hard. You are basically expected to tank. 40man raids will not be an issue as fury warrior is basically the most numerous class in 40man raids due to their versitility and DPS potential.
---
WoW, Diablo and Hearthstone.
---
Though Supposedly HotS is the best for that.
---
I 2ss5'd AQ40 geared players on my champion set(blue pvp set) warlock. I strongly disagree.
---
I want to preface by saying im not a lock main but warlocks were only low dps in MC.  ZG and beyond they get nutty and scale amazingly.  They also cant coast.... they have to get on early to farm shards, summon all the lazies, healthstones for all, ,soulstones, make sure a certain curse is on every mob and often have to cc.  Did you play vanilla?
---
No thanks, current activision(Blizzard) developers lack talent and creativity. They would destroy the entire game in a single hotfix patch.
---
Thanks! Sounds promising that they are looking at detail!
---
yeah i can't get on a private server and ruin the impossible amount of fun that will be blizzards classic. Which i really hope we dont get a different experience then what even the private servers can provide. Really hope this is done correctly man please....
---
Its easy if you get the gear and keep a tank set.  Warriors are huge on the meters and you can get kitted if you run tank early on and just dont bring other plate wearers on your runs.  
---
Fury warriors are the best DPS class (at least in the high end gear, they take some gear to get ramped up). They're also going to be by far the most populated class begging for raid spots.
---
If you want a raid spot, you're going to have to approach a raid leader with one of two things, ideally both:
---
*  Pre-raid BIS fully enchanted and well-chosen, including the expensive craftables if available, showing you truly know your class and what items to max out your dps, and have put the effort in.
---
*  An acceptable pre-raid Tank Set and a total willingness to tank as much as needed.
---
Remember that even DPS warriors had to offtank lots in Vanilla so dont think you can avoid having to collect tank gear. If you're hoping to get into a raid as a fury warrior and never ever tank and only dps then you'd better make sure you're the highest dps warrior on the server before you apply!
---
&gt;pet of a warlock despawns when you summon a new one.
---
whattt? I know it's been a long ass time, but I distinctly remember the pet suffering a stun for the duration of the cast before the new pet appeared. 
---
I think they shouldve pushed the RPG aspect in later expansions, rather than roll it back.
---
 More inconvinient bullshit that makes you go "goddamnit I forgot about X"
---
Battlemasters were unequivocally a positive addition. Imagine flying to the fucking Arathi Highlands from Orgrimmar just to run a BG... 
---
Oh wait, I don’t have to imagine it because I did it and it was awful. I can only imagine how bad it was for Alliance to get to WSG.
---
The hearthstone team has always been pretty communicative, its just that they don't often say what the community wants to hear. I'm not sure how communicative the Diablo team actually needs to be when they get like 1 content update a year. 
---
My strategy in this regard is to be one of the first people in pre-raid BiS as a fury warrior.  
---
It will be my 100% driving goal the moment we're allowed to log in to the game. I want to be the guy that is an obvious invite because I have my gear so quickly.  
---
So my strategy is basically exactly what you said you can't do.  
---
I honestly know of one in a fairly high level zone but I don't want to reveal it. Is that poopy of me? I'm sorry D:  
---
My cousins were visiting from Europe and I wanted to get a "quick" UBRS run in to get some better gear (I had only raided the first couple bosses in ZG at that point).  Three and a half hours later get finally cleared it, and I finally got the Beaststalkers Chestpiece for my Hunter.  I still have it in the bank today
---
where is the link? cant just say stuff like that and not provide a link, 
---
P.S. That was fixed only in WotLK
---
Literally unplayable, just cancel classic now /s
---
To add:
---
You still had to do a butt load of pvp and bgs if you wanted the items, it just took away the competing with other players for the rewards and honor decay parts. Given enough time casual players could get r14 gear.
---
I wouldn't be against this IF they made the costs very high, or implemented it at the end. It would combat the 16hrs  a day for 3 months stigma.
---
Badges being part of the currency was a double edged sword though, kept bgs alive but it forced players into a bg they didn't care for. And if you win you got 3 badges, loss was 1 badge, could make the argument it pushed people to try in bgs and kick afkers. 
---
If the time commitment was the same for bwl/aq gear and epic pvp gear then it would be ok in my book. 
---
The title might be its own reward, kept in the competing fashion, still showing other players how dedicated you are.
---
But seeing a HW or GM was always a holy shit moment, and I'd hate to take away from that. But in late end game maybe it wouldn't matter as much, since seeing people in naxx/aq40 gear was the new Ooo Shit! 
---
This sub is just handing out reddit gold huh? :D :D 
---
This is correct. Even though they are wanted in raids, they also are gear dependant and highly populated. It doesnt take 10 hours a day of playing, but you will have to stand out even just a bit to get the spot. Either great gear, tanking capabilities or overall dedication.
---
Welcome to theorycrafting in a game where you have a low skill cap and aren't heavily punished for being wrong. Everyone has an opinion that is objectively difficult to invalidate.
---
&gt; in Vanilla we had all kind of pops, from low to full and it was basicly fine, and everyone could find a server size they liked to play on that actually within the Vanilla design.
---
Thats easy to say if you werent on one of the ones that was abandoned. Some of us were on realms that died. We were the 'target' realms that Blizzard kept giving "free transfers" to. But noone took them, because who wants to play on an empty server?
---
It was awful. And yeah we eventually found better servers... by abandoning our home like everyone else did and rerolling on a high pop one. I can see this happening again this time. .
---
gear cap in PvP.  
---
no items with itemlevel above the PvP items.
---
which means PvP gear or BWL and some AQ pieces only.
---
I didn't said that.
---
I said that anyone noticed that for such long time.
---
Regular wow and Classic are entirely separate games. Regular wow will still be receiving new expansions and changes, while Classic is a recreation of the game as it was originally for players who prefer that. They won't effect each other in any way
---
It was originally in German, so here's the translated version: https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-blizzard-interview-14-01-2019/20229
---
Point 7 might be true for PvP (which seems to be what you're talking about), but I don't agree with you when it comes to raid PvE
---
&gt; most ppl here never fully experienced vanilla recently (only possible by playing on ps).
---
Except that PS is not a real Vanilla experience. Some parts are well emulated, don't get me wrong, but some parts are also very far off from the actual Vanilla experience. For Example: Look at the screwed economies, overcrowded zones / farmspots due to the population being to high for what the game actually was designed for. And more of these issues.
---
This is also a issue i see often in "No changes" discussions, where often you see ppl saying "No Changes" and then proceed to tell that they want Classic to be like the latest or their favority pserver. Basicly asking for changes compared to Vanilla. 
---
Posted above by someone 6 hours ago. In German though.
---
Honestly it's gotten to the point where because I can't correct all the misinformation I've considered letting it fester and just hoping people make terrible decisions because of it for my benefit.
---
Sticky hands: the player who rolls on everything because 'it's an upgrade' even if the stats are right, the cloak might have 1 more armor but has int and the rogue takes it, or hunters and weapons. Like the seagulls in finding Nemo, "mine?"
---
I can see why u think its a good idea but its not worth the effort since u will most likely die severql times until u reach chests and moneywise its just not viable
---
&gt; The hearthstone team has always been pretty communicative, its just that they don't often say what the community wants to hear.
---
Not really. The team only pokes their head out a month before an expansion and 2-4 weeks after. Iskar tweets a few things on mechanics related things once a week or so, but that's about it. They're nowhere near as good as other companies and I guarantee it's because how profitable Hearthstone is and the higher ups not wanting to polarize the community. Year of the Raven had a balanced but polarizing meta, until they killed Druid and let Hunter run rampant.
---
I'd like for battlemasters to be at the actual BG locations only. It always led to some amazing wpvp shenanigans.
---
**/s**
---
It is possible if you keep up with the patch progression all along.
---
Start stocking up your consumables as fast as possible.
---
When Naxx launches you should be in AQ/Bwl gear.
---
There are always guilds that raid weekends, but its not that common.
---
I Currently raid Naxx /AQ40 with about 12 hours a week on my rogue.
---
2 raid days and 1 day to farm consumables.
---
Not sure about the time needed to farm consumables for a warlock.
---
I'd rather deal with wotf then having my dots and fear cleansed all the time.
---
1v1 pvp you will have it harder.  
---
structured pvp you will have it easier.
---
if still in doubt go SL and rape everyone either way.
---
I'm still having fun in BfA, I love the zones for alting, world PvP i better than ever, and the end-game still needs gear and skill.
---
To me, it doesn't matter other people can obtain 370 gear from easier content, they can't do M+ content without skill and knowledge.
---
The gear I don't mind.
---
Legion's way of dealing with artifact power was better, classes felt deeper, but overall, every MMO has ups and downs...
---
I still BfA, I just play it less until content updates (as with any MMO once the initial content is done).
---
I can't remember what expansion it was but I know a really long time ago when I would go to summon a new pet it would stun it and the stun duration would be like 24 days or something crazy like that.
---
Most people are hoping that it captures the vanilla experience.  Things like: the gear curve being very small so old gear isn't instantly worthless with new expansions, people investing time into a character to develop a name recognition, sense of community.  But most of all we sunk several years into vanilla.
---
It's not like legion(sorry it's the most recent expansion I have played) where everyone races to level cap, clears the first raid, then is gone until new content.  People in vanilla played everyday.  I even knew most opposing faction PvP members by name and vice versa.  WoW was an amazing time and I think many of us yearn for a piece of that nostalgia again.
---
No it was based on ilvl. Each slot get some percentage based on the stats you can get (a chest is worth more than a bracers of the same ilvl because it give more stats).
---
You could be a warrior wearing icc cloth intellect gear and have 6k gs no problem.
---
No that's fine. I just wanted to know if others have been thinking about this. Like when is a good time to try for gurubashi arena? Being level 5 and getting a 14 or 16 slot bag right away.
---
It's no longer Monday but I will try applying anyway. 
---
Yo, my name is Artur, I am from Poland and I love Vanilla/TBC World of Warcraft. I like feeling of accomplishment, doing long quests, grinding and reaching everything slowly, making new friends, running dungeons, gearing up to have easier leveling experience, be more of use and handle myself in world PvP.

I am going to enjoy my every moment of Classic experience, do many quests, get my reputation, skill fishing, cooking and other stuff. I will run same dungeons many times, hunt rares and participate in world PvP to hunt people or run away while being the hunted. I won't rush my way to 60 lvl. It will take approximately 3-4 to 6 months for me to get to max lvl probably. I will get myself goals to achieve, participate in some RP events probably to learn how to RP better and do some crazy stuff. Right now it's the only game I am waiting for. I am not grinding lvl 60 on private servers to lose any will to do so in Classic. I got max lvl once, it was on Nostalrius as far as I remember. I played some Rogue on private servers and raided as one in Legion. I was in top 5 raiding guild on my server. I am willing to farm resistance gear and have my consumables when time will come. When it comes to help for guildmates. It depends. I would rather not run 30 minutes to kill one person and would do so only if I am not in middle of something else and other guild members are further away. I would not give my precious resources for someone new if I had no assurance that I will get it back soon enough and might need them anyway. I am rather honorable and proud enough to try and get stuff done or achieved rather than being handed to me and will ask for help only if I don't find better way getting stuff done myself. Also, if someone help me out, I will rather pay my debt as soon as possible. It would be cool to find someone to be able to count on and do the same for other member. Cheers!
---
I'm to old to know that /s mean sarcasm :-(
---
I will have a set up much like this one, but my prot tree will be a bit different for pve.
---
Your choice is what we all struggle with. Divine favor or holy shield? Both can be really awesome and play with the lore that paladins are a defensive class. 
---
In pvp divine favor will help you vs casters and brings more utility to your group, holy shield will help you against rogues and warriors. Your can always respec after you find out what you fight against the most in bgs or wpvp, will you pocket heal or be more offensive, etc.
---
That being said, I think it's great they are just trying to figure things out and don't give out false information. Nothing bothers me more than information that's simply inaccurate - you know, like those past three BlizzCons where they teaser information about features and such that somehow never appear to make it into the game as teasered...
---
Now with classic it's mostly information regarding sharding, loot trading, possible realm transfers, all that stuff. Better not to talk about IDEAS until they are set in stone. All you'd do is upset people either way..
---
That's very much so NOT the case. Retail numbers are still quite a bit bigger than (stable) classic numbers are going to be.
---
How is it more true for alliance? 
---
aww
---
What I found interesting that they said they focussed strongly the last weeks on fixes based on the community feedback of the demo.
---
I think that's great news that the feedback is heard and implemented.
---
 54 Stam  + the 30% (?) extra you get from the mandatory talent in disc tree, so it is sth like 750hp, that is like 25% more than you have in blue gear. I probably wont change your mind but PWF is by far the best long time buff of any class in PvP
---
What appears to be the plan is:
---
Classic wow will be a separate 'game' that essentially freezes at the 1.12 patch.
---
While the retail version as you know it will continue to get future patches and expansions. 
---
Classic wow will always be there as an option to play while you have an active subscription.
---
&gt;Stopped at 119 due to boredom.
---
And now imagine BfA's endgame is even more boring and dull than levelling. 
---
Pally blessing -threat ?
---
I reported this on a pserver once and after long conversations with the gms we never really came to a conclusion. The problems is in the mangos code itself and we assumed maybe it was like that in vanilla.  
---
After noticing though you can't unsee it and it bothers me anytime I'm around that area.
---
Since they fixed the lanterns in Westfall I'm sure they will fix this too. RIGHT BLIZZARD!?
---
Right. Forgot there is a blessing for that.
---
The guy literally said "as long as they dont have to tank, which they usually don't"
---
Skyrim WoW edition.  And it be an mmo. 
---
That's my dream game.
---
this i agree with 100%
---
Wrath was basically the same, it just went off the item level of the gear. That's why pvp trinkets were higher points when the addon first came out.
---
MC Dogs are easily done with 3. Sulfuron easily done with 3. Domo easily done with 3.5. Razogore also is just 3-4 tanks. Post suppression room also 3. Like you don't need any of ur dps wars to tank and maybe just 1 at that. I've always used just 3 prots for almost everything you listed.
---
Unless they wanted to go really in depth with it it would be a lot easier to just assume optimal spec.
---
If people would jump off the nostalgia cloud for a minute, or would have actually experienced the pre-battlemaster era, they would realise flying out to Arathi, Ashenvale and Alterac was a dang nightmare timewise. Not to mention getting raped multiple times while there. Why would you want changes such as these to get "that vanilla feeling" back when that feeling sucked? 
---
Is it the Theramore one? Or higher?
---
Zone scaling making the games less linear would be ok, maybe not dungeons though. 
---
And pvp level scaling in bgs, I guess like they did in swtor. 
---
Yeeaah, that's your opinion.
---
The most relevant part to me is that they reconfirmed summer 2019
---
Oh, right. It's a bit confusing because it's an actual popular belief.
---
Here here!
---
Shamans should be much lower, shocks being on the same CD as the 5 second rule make it awkward to manage your mana when leveling, and windfury 2h might be bursty but not at all consistent
---
As a warrior tank I would always cherry pick the group to only include casters+rogues that only needed it for the quest. The axe isnt that great though if you have WW-axe or if you're getting the SM quest reward axe that alliance get.
---
Rogues are pretty straight forward and beginner friendly considering their toolkit imo. Their neither easy to lvl nor especially rare and wanted for dungeons I agree.
---
ESO already exists though
---
I think that a beta phase will give the community some time to send feedback and help Blizzard determine any outliers they may have missed.
---
The community has a keen eye.  Sometimes too keen, imho.  I’m not worried as long as feedback is being listened to.
---
It sure is 
---
Totally agree man, after Nost shutdown everyone who played vanilla and wanted vanilla was wholeheartedly  and openly against the decisions of Activision after WoTLK or even expansions before that. We cried out for vanilla, vanilla as it was not some sort of frankenpatch with new age technologies. After blizzard announcement of classic somehow those people speaking out for vanilla faded away and new people came in from all different regions, meaning retail, TBC WoTLk pservers or from quiting. And most of them don't know what to ask for in general.
---
Projecting my insecurities? lol I dont think that means what you think it means. 
---
You are not a min maxer if you are just practicing leveling. Especially if you "don't care about gear". Gear is VITAL to leveling quickly. Go look up what an actual min maxer is before you try to defend them, dipshit.
---
Meta strategy.  You just don’t understand it yet. L
---
My retail account is a collectors edition. Get lots of comments on my mini pet :) 
---
I have this idea that the reason vanilla stayed so popular even though it's so old was because of private servers and their shorter lifespans.
---
It gives people the time to play the game, but would either eventually get shut down, or a new realm would open. 
---
At first it was just a taste of vanilla, since a lot of servers had wonky scripting, then it became better and better, more Blizz like was also the selling point. We don't know was will happen after the 2+ year mark. But essentially they could open fresh realms and the hype would reset because of worlds firsts and the aq opening event.
---
Pservers fueled the addiction. Gives you the fix, then it gets taken away, then gives it to you again. 
---
With Blizzard giving us classic we will truly see the effect of 'permanent realms' 
---
I will never do SM Arm with a Warrior who says "LFM SM Lib+Arm" then says "Let's do Arm first, then we'll do Lib".
---
So why would you go balance?
---
Agree! I much prefer going to the entrance and maybe doing some wPvP while I wait for my queue to pop, rather than sitting in Orgrimmar staring at the walls inside that building.
---
also no windfury :(
---
Yea, that's personal loot and it's one of the worst things they've done to Wow, what a shame.
---
I'm now curious if they released class with everything open how long it would take for the best to clear naxx. 
---
And one that's cleared open TBC with everything unlocked and see how fast they cleared BT and SW.
---
Then open northrend, but the argent tournament would really fast track wotlk content, if everything was unlocked at the start.
---
But how long would it take the most dedicated players if the content of each expansion was unlocked as long as you beat the last raid boss on the previous one.
---
You should probably mention what timezone &amp; time you plan on playing in.
---
You may also have more luck in /r/wowservers or the subreddit of whatever server you pick.
---
But honestly, you probably wont get many or even any bites.    
---
You're probably better off just jumping on and making some friends in game.
---
Is it the same for druids?
---

I've been playing 1.12 private servers for 4 years.
---
If nostalgia was a motivator for playing I would have stopped years ago.
---
Sure, it'll be a factor for some people. That they'll get their fix and move on shortly after.
---
But for the rest of us, nostalgia isn't even a key factor.
---
Time Consuming != Hard
---
And groups would be waiting forever to find someone with this magical combo for things that are trivial to complete anyways. The most hardcore of guilds might do it but to the extent of the General populous worrying about it I doubt it’ll happen. 
---
Can we all do SM Graveyard so I can try for my next wand - all Priests (please support your priests)
---
I have been playing vanilla realms since I quit retail in TBC, still logging in 5 days out of 7, still find things I want to do.  I have dont the pvp grind and the raiding, but I am still here and still rerolling when I feel like it.  Having played dozens (over 50) characters to level cap I am still not bored.
---
So please tell me when I am likely to burn out, because it hasnt happened in over a decade playing the same game.
---
Mood
---
It’s less likely for those reasons. I mean you can withhold belief that it’ll be without an add on but you can’t claim it will be with one because we don’t know yet. And even if there is an add on, the lack of lfr, crossrealm grouping, and such will force players to be a part of guilds or at the very least not tarnish their own name on the server. 
---
&gt;we do not know how long a unique player continues to play the same account.
---
I had a little look at some raid logs a few weeks ago. There's unfortunately not a lot for some of the older servers.
---
But from what is available, 12% of players that clear MC also clear Naxx. Which is a pretty big step up from the 0.1% or 1% figures that people commonly throw around for the original Vanilla.
---
Population always dies off around the same time AQ40 comes out.
---
Many guilds seem to struggle with it and fall apart.    
---
It's also usually around that time that a new server comes out everyone jumps ship.
---
Thank you very much! good read nothing new really.
---
it helps a lot that english is itself at it's core a germanic language. machine TL works less well when translating french or italian and a *lot* less well when translating chinese or japanese.
---
It’s spelled furry warrior - with two r’s. Just sayin
---
The answer is start a new alt.
---
well. 
---
I guess you're not *wrong*
---
Disagree. Shaman has great mobility with Ghost Wolf (and the GW talent points that make it a 1 second cast). Combine that with a great (slow) two-handed weapon like the quest staff from Wailing Caverns, Rockbiter Weapon and Earthbind kiting - and it can be very smooth! Drop Searing Totem and auto-attack and kite (download Swing Timer addon for the best result). Basically you can have very little downtime as a shaman if played correctly. 
---
How are feral druids?
---
I love your UI. 
---
I get downvoted for this every time I say it. And I get a lot of comments from people disagreeing with me.
---
-
---
But yes, yes it is possible. And I'm currently doing it. 
---
To those who disagree: Your opinion is not going to change my reality.
---
If you can consistently show up to every (or most) raids, which for most guilds will be 2 a week, for around 2-3hrs. Then there's a good chance you'll make it into Naxx.    
---
(You'll also want to find yourself into a top end guild. If you find yourself in a "casual" guild that wipes on the same boss every week or takes 3hrs just to clear MC you'll obviously get nowhere.)
---
Gold from raiding is enough for some classes to cover consumables, but most classes will need to spend a few hours gold farming each week.    
---
And naturally, as you progress future into the content, you'll need more gold for more consumables.
---
Or if one week you find yourself with a lot of free time you can stockpile for a while.
---
You may also need to be able to spare an hour or so before each raid to get DM:T buffs.    
---
If you're lucky, someone in your guild may clear it and allow others to use the ID for buffs. But don't rely on that.
---
Some players also sell DM:T IDs, if you've got the spare gold.    
---
But I often see people spending far longer looking to buy an ID than it would take to form a group and run it themselves.
---
Remember back in Vanilla when you could sacrifice your pet, then made it rez by a healer ? This way you could have both your pet and the sacrifice buff! 
---
I kinda get the feeling you like to play rogues and think they're underpowered.
---
I was a tauren hunter on Azjol Nerub server in Europe. Think I reached somewhere between 48 - 52 before TBC launched.
---
I started really early in vanilla's lifespan, but I was always just exploring, looking for chests to loot. Young me thought that was where the real gold was lol. I saw other characters riding by on mounts, wearing gear with purple text on 'em. But that was never my goal. It will be this time around, though! :)
---
Mob health, cast bars, item tooltips with vendor price, stat comparison, showing all character stats (e.g. hit and avoidance).
---
That's the only way I'd still be playing release.
---
I am talking to you though and you said
---
&gt;I can’t think of one example of a fight where a dps warrior does anything special.
---
I also said Warriors kick just like rogues
---
You sure about that? ...
---
It's not really toxic. I think he's replying sarcastically because of the use of the term ''thought experiment'', which obviously, your post is not. 
---
You mean to ask: *"Do you know of any great chest spawn locations early on in the noob- and startingzones?"*
---
There's a couple easy ones in Durotar, in the quilboar camps. 
---
Mulgore, in the gnoll camps and by the harpy nests.
---
Barrens as well; quilboar camps have some chest spawns.
---
It doesn't tell much, but that they're confident could indicate a launch early summer.
---
What are you talking about priests have it easy mode, it might be slower then a warlock, hunter or druid, but still, no downtime. I mean no downtime, ever after you get to level 14 with shadow tap and a good wand.
---
I've already created a guild for this purpose. :)
---
Link to latest advertisement: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/afu75o/looking_for_group_monday_january_14_2019/ee1f9ez/
---
It won't be a "**must not** know anything, **must** learn everything by playing" kind of guild. That's certainly interesting but I think that would take too long and would be very hard to find at least 40 people for it. So we'll take our time, play the game and learn and will go in "blind" for each raid. But after the first few wipes and after we had our fill of "this was new!" we'll allow ourselves to rely more on our more experienced members (or even some out of game knowledge, if necessary). I think this way we'll have plenty of fun. :)
---
Eso is not Skyrim. And doesn't have the lore of Warcraft.
---
&gt;If Blizzard increased server population caps and kept in sharding (in early areas). Would the compromise work?
---
It is better than just sharding, yes. And I actually expect them to do that, because that seems to be the whole point - to lessen the effect of tourist flood.
---
Thought i still believe simple queue would be better. Because the fear of getting sharded some time later (not a launch) will be present forever.
---
Or they could just make a separate sub to cut the tourist flood and nearly negate the problem at the beginning...
---
&gt; And yes, I am quite worried they will implement it around world bosses and events like aq opening. But like I said if they still allowed for vanilla numbers in a zone would it be THAT bad?
---
And THAT is not an option at all. Even if there are several shards with the same (large) amount of people in it, it is NOT THE SAME as having everyone present. Top guilds or known players should compete over bosses, resources, farming areas and such. 
---
Even if see 200 players around me on Azuregos pull, there is no point in that, if top Alliance guild is in one shard and top Horde guild is in another.
---
if you chose a well populated server, you shouldn't have issue with party and going through a "ghost town".
---
I created a Nelf druid last friday and there was plenty of players.
---
Did all my teldrasil quest with 2 others randoms then did a lot of party for quests in Darkshore and already ran WC with a bunch of weirdos wanting to go all the way to the barrens by walking :)
---
As long as you can say "Hi" before inviting someone in party you shouldn't face any difficulty 
---
VE instead of that one point in Mental Agility
---
If you take the shortcut from Valley of Trials (Orc/Troll starting zone) to Ratchet, there's a chest spawn in the water.
---
Yeah, not really.
---
It's more like a 5 years plan :-D
---
People will adapt to the circumstances. This is how it worked in vanilla, and it is also in large how it works on private server, with the addition of having signups thru discord or google spreadsheets.
---
they increased the resource needed on Pserver to adjust to the number of player
---
Pretty sure Blizzard have already said that they understand that sharding areas like world bosses is not an option.
---
But stories like these really concern me:    
---
 *[Retail players gather a 120-man raid on a city. Game Masters step in and stop the raid due to excessive (10s+) lag caused.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769527245#post-4)*
---
not really, there was a comparison that showed them being just slightly behind hunter. that is my personal experience as well.
---
Could you share said file? :)
---
I want to see the bodies of 200 naked female trolls spelling out "Welcome to Classic" on the ground when the game launches. Phasing will absolute ruin that. People on the same server will not have shared memories. Sharding goes against the spirit of the game, even if its intentions are good.
---
Chili has a 100% spell dmg coefficient and it definitely is good with world buffs and some spell damage consumes. On pservers you can stack grilled squid with chili but i cant remember if it's blizzlike or not. If it is, then chili is dps up even in single-target in comparison to str food buffs.
---
Carrion birds (deadwing pass) and wind serpents (zg) can both be found at level 55 and 60 respectively, so I think that won't be a problem for you.
---
Don't forget the racial vanish if you're an alliance druid! Pulled too many mobs? Shadowmeld into Prowl
---
Kicking bosses can be a heavy responsibility, but there's only a handful of fights where that's the case iirc, so pretty cruisy most of the time yeah.
---
Great template but mages have it easy, and good druid players can level very fast.
---
Thats exactly what it is
---
The rng was the part that let me quit
---
Add to the list "Don't use Evasion vs Warriors." I see this constantly and it couldn't be further from the truth. Warriors are possibly the best class to use evasion against. 
---
Does wagyu beef taste worse if everyone could afford to eat it?
---
Would a porsche be less fun to drive if everyone else owned one?
---
Would your gf be any less beautiful to you if all girls looked like her?
---
If having something or seeing something someone else does not or cannot makes you happy only because of those two criteria then you a pretty fucking shitty person.
---
Why do you give a shit about other people seeing it? Does it make you feel special to see something only because you know other people cant? what a fucking horrible personality trait you have there.
---
Here's the thing: with realm pops at normal, having battlemasters means that bgs will pop far more reliably. Otherwise you'd definitely only see av and ab on their weekends.
---
Battlemasters were already in the game by the time I started playing, so I don't have the before and after experience to compare to.
---
That said, it might be reasonable to consider having no battlemasters on pvp servers where easy access to battlegrounds might detract from world pvp. Plus, it would tend to turn the areas with the battlemasters into perpetual death pits, which might be a desireable result.
---
But I have strong feelings about that, and I myself won't be playing on a pvp server. If i were to vote, I would vote for battlemasters to be in the game.
---
Np. Yeah, mostly confirming some things more or less. But a good read indeed. :)
---
Yes that is why I don't want sharding at all in later areas. This is the discussion we need. You make and excellent point of the possibility of world raids going uncontested.
---
What about if sharding around the world boss area just vanished. Like if duskwood was sharded but once you got up the mountain path to the nightmare dragon all shards dropped/merged. Though I hope sharding does not go as far as duskwood.
---
Why do you care about casual people playing the same content? Is it only valuable to you if you know others are excluded from it? thats a pretty fucked up way to see value in your own experiences.
---
What is an alt?
---
Yes ofcourse, if undead is going to be a lets say one of the most played races on the horde, thats about lets say 30% probably more your fear is going to be extremely dumbed down, if a rogue can break your fear or anything at that matter what does that leave you with? your cc is predominantly fear, and wotf makes you immune to fear for 5 whole seconds after breaking.
---
It's pretty easy to determine someone's spec though?
---
If you are wearing healing gear then calculate +heal/mp5/spirit(if druid/priest)/mana/crit
---
If you are wearing spell power gear, then calculate spellpower and crit
---
If you are wearing str/agi/crit then calculate that. Use what class it is to know exactly what spec. If you are a rogue wearing daggers you assign to dagger rogue sheet.
---
In theory it'd be pretty easy to develop this, and with good understanding of theorycrafting you could make it quite accurate aswell.
---
We already have spreadsheets for privat servers that calculates your optimal dps doing a x time encounter based of your gear. And you can change gear out to see how much it impacts you, you would literally just need a sheet for every class/spec like this and then assign gear score based on that.
---
Grearscore was one of the main reasons I quit WOTLK after trying it, so I am with you completely. Thankfully my experience on TBC servers was that even though some groups used GS, I could easily find enough that did not. So I hope that enough people would ignore it for it to just die out.
---
Queues are always going to be needed, even if there is sharding, if you want a healthy population on all servers. Otherwise there would only be overpopulated or lower pop (soon to be dead after tourists leave) servers.
---
Also you don't want to cut the tourist flood imo. A portion of the tourists will probably decide to continue playing because it's more fun than retail and that is good for classic.
---
LOTR online had musical instruments, which you could play ad hoc or program. It was pure QoL and I loved it! You could go in an inn and play together with other people.
---
It's stuff like that I'd love to see in other mmorpg's.
---
For WoW mechanics, I'd like an improved achievement system where careful consideration is done for each achievement to prevent abuse.
---
&gt;you're reduced to a number  
---
vs being reduced to inspection (your gear)?  
---
Its exactly the same thing, except in later expansions they "fixed" itemization so having higher ilvl is almost always better  
---
The only way it would work properly in classic is if someone were to add custom value to all the items, which would be one hell of a job to do.  
---
Assuming we have some sort of armory then yes, it wouldn't be needed. But if I'm looking to join a ZG pug while sitting in orgimmar, it's hard for me to tell people what my gear lvl is like.
---
...or 2g 
---
However, you can bet your ass that gurubashi arena will be filled with dozens of lvl 2-4 players right after release, non-stop preventing each other to grab the chest :D
---
Just follow the long line of skeletons from Booty bay to the arena...
---
Doesn't really matter if the mats are randomized, for every server with at least one big guild, the scepter will be the limiting factor, not the war effort. 
---
that story makes me kind of sad :(
---
Yet I have never seen GS even mentioned on a vanilla private server. For such an addon to thrive people have to use it. If the majority ignores the "&gt;X GS only" groups, anyone who tries to make such groups will just give up eventually, because it would take them too long.
---
So I believe (hope) the classic community will save us from it.
---
They're not easy, you need to kill quilboars to get them. What he really wanted to know was the location of *unguarded* chests. 
---
Of which there are some in Duskwood. However, your agro range will be so big, you will not be open the chest anyway.
---
Only really easy unguarded chest that I know of is the one in the water behind the durotar start zone.
---
awhile back i remember people used to always say Heart of Wyrmthalak is suppose to scale with spell power in vanilla. do you know if that is true or not? i just think its odd that this trinket would scale with spell power but the dm trinket doesnt

[ Looking for group ] Druidtank : "lfg dungeon"
---
Immediatly receive an invite.
---
Well LFD doesnt change anything.
---
That poison quest...
---
The reason they are sharding is very simple and obvious:  
---
1. So people can play / their servers don't die  
---
2. So that they don't have to create way more servers than necessary and have half of them dead when "tourists" leave  
---
3. So that servers have stable pop after "tourists" leave  
---
4. So they don't have to bother with merging which fucks with the names  
---
2 to 4 is basically the same thing  
---
Playing on a "dead" server and/or unbalanced factions (pvp serv) is still real sorry and blizzard has to introduce faction queue/restrictions in order to make sure it doesn't happen  
---
Couple of streamers can completely save/ruin (most likely latter) the server because classic is not made to host tens of thousands of people  
---
If they do want fewer servers with way more players which will be very welcome, they will definitely have to introduce dynamic respawn for everything because game just wasn't build on idea of having 10k+ in one world  
---
I have opinions both technical and logistical about sharding, but let me tell this story instead. 
---
When wow launched I started on mal'ganis. It had a huge population and the server was taken down for a few days because it couldn't handle it. This did suck. But after some tuning and adjusting concurrent user caps, the realm was back up and I was questing in silverpine forest. There is a quest there to collect pumpkins that was a bottle neck with all the people running around, but everyone there quickly set up a queue so we could all get it done. Then this Jackass came along and butt in line and was being a dick about it. So me and a few other guys camped the spawn points just to deny this one guy the quest item, but we did let everyone else in line complete the quest if we could. It was more fun doing that than just doing the quest on it's own. But also, my friend list got it's first 4 entries and it's first ignore. 
---
Fast forward 14 years, and the 4 guys I friended that day are still friends on discord. We guilded from mc through sunwell plateau and are planning to do it again in classic. If we had been sharded out instead, it's likely none of that would have happened.
---
For me, the starting zone at launch is part of the vanilla experience that has it's pros and cons. But I think sharding is overkill and sets a bad precedent to address a temporary problem. 
---
None 
---
I never did graveyard but always wanted to. Why TF is everyone skipping it?
---
I do, but not character models. Human males are just horribly painful with that hair lip. 
---
Everything you idiot. Do you think anyone would bother devoting their life to ice hockey if the Stanley cup was a participation award and no winner was declared? I'm sorry that you've never been able to feel that you're better at something than most people. It's very rewarding to see that the effort you've put in above everyone else has paid off. 
---
I was one of those people in Nostalrius, but only for 1 run. I have no regrets. 
---
upvoted them all back!
---
The worst thing is, they can't fix it on pservers either since it's client side coding (we asked for it on a quest-centered RP pve pserver)
---
Oh i'm sorry, i didn't know that no one else could play hockey if they don't play in the Stanley cup. Idiot 
---
As far as i know, i'm still allowed to play fucking sports exactly like every other person plays sports, just in a different location and with different competitors, but no one stops me from playing with a certain type of ball purely because i'm not "good enough".  
---
That's just plain wrong. There are a few pieces of gear that are readily apparent, like shoulders, chest, helm (if displayed), cloak (if displayed), pants (if not wearing a robe). Gloves, belt and footwear would be barely noticeable. Neck, wrists, rings and trinkets are just not visible. 
---
Not to mention that a ton of gear didn't have a unique model. 
---
masochism 
---
Glad I quit early WotLK and  missed out on all the "fun" things this dude is describing
---
Posts like this make me think private server spergs are going to ruin classic wow. Hopefully they are only a small portion of the population.
---
I agree with your assessment. And whole heartedly agree that sharding is bad for the players experience. 
---
But if they increased the population and added sharding, to the player you see roughly the same population while questing and possibly more in the cities and later game. To Blizzard it's less realms and other headaches to deal with in the long run.
---
this.
---
What does nostalgia have to do with it? Vanilla is an objectively good game. It stands on its own.
---
Idk about the whole dwarf priest. The thing is, you basically get nothing as the other races on alliance and in any serious guild you'd expect someone rolling priest to at least have done a bit of research and picked dwarf.
---
Obviously classic will be a lot more casual than pservers but still though, if you are interesting in semihardcore raiding you are prolly gonna be laughed at for not going dwarf. 
---
I'd like to have somewhat better battle sounds effects. While the music is cool and all, many effects sound like 8bit samples or something. 
---
Druid cat noises are horrible. The gunshot sound of guns very loud/intrusive compared to the mild bow thwang. It's why I prefer bows over guns while leveling as a hunter.
---
It's rather - would you have more money if everyone else had more money?  
---
No, because of inflation.
---
Priests watch the world burn.
---
You can do fine with 4hours of raiding until AQ so doing that time you will have to farm up a lot of money/consumes
---
Shadowmeld can't be used while in combat in vanilla.
---
They're free to play as much as they want. It's YOU that say people are elitist idiots if they say Stanley Cup should be an elite tournament and EVERYONE gets to play and win it. 
---
True lol.
---
Can’t shadowmeld in combat during classic. Not until wrath
---
Unpopular opinion: War effort may have been good in retail vanilla, but on every private server and most likely classic it's been a shitshow of people war profitering because the rewards for turning in isn't close to the cost of the items and people rather make money than turning stuff in knowing someone else will do it for them.
---
I think i have kinda the build that you are gonne use: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzxZVGpIczxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzxZVGpIczxo)
---
I'm still in doubts for the tallents in holy, 10% strg and 10% intel is nice, but the 70% reduction is good in Pvp and the increase in dmg in seal of righteouness is handy for the extra dmg for the reckoning and tanking.... what to do what to do.
---
Good thing about this build is that you can heal, tank (no raids) and be viable in pvp.
---
Most of the people I see claiming this stuff were little kids in WoW or get information from content creators that are just in it for the clicks and aren't interested in giving good advice.
---
He is absolutely right. Getting to [this point in the game](https://i.imgur.com/FPCJrTB.jpg) was so thrilling- it's hard to even describe it now. And part of the reason it was thrilling was because of all of the effort and time that we put into getting there. Not only that, but effort and time building a cohesive group of people who all played well together.
---
At the same time we had our raid 'support team' which comprised of people who wanted to focus on professions, gathering, lower level dungeons, alts, etc and didn't *want* to raid. And they didn't *have* to raid in order to do their thing, have fun and feel a sense of accomplishment and community. 
---
but... that's a rare mob, with a 33% chance to drop the wand at all. you could just get [this](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7001) and would be at roughly the same place, except it's a quest reward, so no randomness involved.
---
One thing I loved about Vanilla was that I knew I'd never be able to see AQ40 or Naxx and that was fine by me. I was amazed every time someone in tier 3 walked by. Now everyone's sitting around in welfare epics and nothing feels impressive anymore. I don't think Classic is for you pal.
---
If he dies he dies 
---
That is not entirely true. The vanilla private servers that run for years have a very low pop. 
---
The 'big' vanilla private server either stop after a while or 'move' into another fresh one, so that the entire population leaves and starts over.
---
There is no Nostalrius running for years on end with several k players. They all stopped or restarted.
---
There's loads of DKP addons. WebDKP, GuildDKP...
---
Why would they ruin anything? Because they more informed and better? 
---
Because of their toxic elitist attitude, thankfully they will be a small portion of the population.
---
@3 sm/ruin needs no respec and is brilliant for everything in game.
---
@6 If by "can" you mean "has a slight chance" I agree but anything over 40% odds is delusional
---
Playing at a certain difficulty is not the same as not playing at all. At all. 
---
I can go outside and play football a football match now - i cant go and play for manchester united, but i can play football if i find 21 other people.
---
I cant raid in classic if i'm not "good enough" - at any level, it doesn't matter if I find 39 other people because there is no difficultly level. Thats the same as saying you can kick a ball but you cant play a match sorry, because you aren't good enough.
---
Tell me why any game has difficulty settings or why any sports league has different tiers if I am wrong. 
---
Did you experience the game when it was like that? I was a complete noob during vanilla, didn't know what the fuck I was doing and saw no raids, but I loved the game and didn't feel like I was ripped off because I didn't  get a free no effort pass to all content.
---
During TBC I was a bit better but for the first half of the expansion I was stuck in kara because I didn't put any effort in, then I decided that I was going to put in the time to improve, and I did, and it was noticed when I applied for one of the top guilds on the server. I got to see end game content, and it was a journey getting there that made it all the more rewarding.
---
This is not only my experience but many people shared the same journey, when you let people make their own goals and have the content there if they feel up to the challenge it's so much more rewarding.
---
I understand you feel differently but do you have to be such a little cunt about it? 
---
Did you know that SM had more wings planned? You can even access a garden area with GM commands
---
Well I ran WC as an alliance yesterday and I can tell you I had to do a lot of Wpvp to get my ass to the instance portal.
---
On my 5 last runs of BFD we had group fight for 4 of them.
---
SFK is always a fuck party if you're alliance.
---
Don't remember the last time I ran RFD/RFK/SM without having to do Wpvp to get to the instance.
---
Uldaman is the only one where party from different faction generally help each other to get to the portal
---
Not anymore. I haven't been able to dig it out of any clients :/
---
Strange, cause I cleared cleared AQ40 and started naxx in vanilla - Classic was very much for me and my hundreds of house played as GM and raidleader thoughought classic kinda proves it - but i've never taken value from knowing others cant see the same thing. 
---
I have fun playing and have fun that it was challenging - do I care that others get to kill the same bosses on lower difficulty settings? No, cause i'm not a sick bastard that excludes people - we used to add a few green/blue geared people from IF almost every raid and take them though MC and BWL when it was on farm because their reaction to being able to see the content gave us joy.
---
What do you think about this?
---
http://armory.twinstar.cz/talent-calc.php?cid=5&amp;d=vanilla&amp;tal=50013213052000020405103030000000502300100000000
---
This is more healing and mana burn oriented while keeping some important PvE holy talents. Troll would be the race to make more use out of Blackout. 
---
so wagyu taste good and porsches drive well because they are expensive? got it.
---
Private server players are old vanilla players who now have a clue. Player behavior in Classic will be must closer than pservers than Vanilla. 
---
I think battlegrounds are alright, and infinitely better than WoW's current system of queue anywhere because it can group players into an area, and since they're in cities it makes the cities feel more alive. You want this in an MMORPG. 
---
In current WoW you can queue from anywhere, and cities feel pretty dead. Perhaps if this old way was still in place the cities would feel more alive. 
---
That said, it takes more than one system for this. E.g you could be working on your professions while in queue, current WoW you wouldn't be doing this because they require less time and effort and are worth less. Maybe more PVP outside the front of the city would happen as another example. 
---
Granted you don't want to be stuck in the same place for PVP queuing going from expansion to expansion, but that's a different issue. 
---
Gear Tourettes got me
---
I actually don't take kings or imp HoJ, and I'm debating on actually taking imp righteous fury. I never needed it in vanilla tanking with a t2 mage and r14 warrior in strat and scholo while I was still in blue gear. Ofc they got blessing of salvation instead of kings. And we could easily beat the timer in UD strat.
---
I'm always torn on the theory crafting on armor, def, or 1h specialization. 
---
Armor is a static reduction on melee, though I've heard it's not worth it. Defense helps on bosses and getting crit too often along with dodge and parry, there is a sweet spot (and if sitting will proc it anything in classic) And the 1h helps dps and threat generation.
---
But yeah, I will take holy shield.
---
Ion did say at Blizzcon that addons that weren't around in Vanilla and that add functionality that wasn't available would be looked into (and the implication was they wouldn't be allowed).
---
This was specifically in reference to grouping addons replicating LFG but hey, why not gearscore-esque BS too
---
If they bring phasing/sharding to classic I just won't sign up for it.
---
mage takes no skill 10 second interrupt, tons of instant casts, blink, aoe instant cast root. over powered class  
---
Mages literally get whispers to go to raids and instances. Locks will be very strong in Classic compared to Real Vanilla due to 16 debuffs and new itemization with tons of spell power on it.
---
Fury and Rogue is going to be very hard to get a DPS spot with. Rogue prob harder due warrior doing better dps and having more utility and being a pain in the a@% to farm pre raid BIS on. Most rogues will never even get pre raid BIS let alone get in a raid. They will give up. Too many morons believe old propaganda videos from bad players crying about rogues and think that 1.12 rogues are op when every class has a spec that can beat them 1 v 1. It will actually be hilarious to see all the posts by rogues crying about how they suck. Same with the warriors.
---
Smart people are going to roll mages and laugh their a@% off at all the badly played melee.
---
&gt; "Hunters are easy mode". They have a high skill cap in PvP. They have a bad wrap because they had a pretty high skill cap and were easy to play wrong.
---
I agree that the skill cap on Hunters' extremely high - The difference is that the base skill is much lower. Just understanding kiting puts you at a massive advantage against melee classes. The pet and Viper Sting in STV-esque PvP wrecks casters.
---
I'm no Orangemarmalade jr. But I'm semi-decent at PvP as a mage. From what i've learned playing vs a hunter that knows just a bit of his class is a hell of a lot more disgusting than PvPing against competent rogues or wlocks.
---
Why? Because the class spikes so hard from little knowledge vs the necessary knowledge for spiking as a rogue or say, Warrior.
---
He opens with the strong argument of new players not being able to find raid spots and expects me to continue reading.  The average person on this sub seems to be completely out of touch with reality.
---
I agree. If there is phasing/sharding in Classic here is one player who, sadly, will not participate. 
---
Maybe, but how would it account the shapeshifting-bonus for ferals? How would it know that titanic legs are best for dw fury but not for 2h fury? Would it be able to calculate weapon skill while not knowing whether that person has fully specced into it or not? Would it know that belt of never-ending agony is better for sword rogues, while t3 belt is better for dagger rogues even though the pure stats on t3 are better? I dont doubt one could male a somewhat accurate and useful gs algorithm, but all I'm saying is that in a lot of cases it will not be accurate enough for people to use it over inspecting and talking to someone. These spreadsheets you are talking about are mostly relevant if said character is actually full bis, if one item is changed than the whole set-up might have to be changed. They also dont account for situational benefits vs possible rng benefits. I.e. crusader vs +5 dmg on MH for dagger rogues, where crusader would come out on top in a spreadsheet. However, due to the proc being unreliant in terms of proccing right before melee has to step out for example, most dagger rogues opt for +5 dmg due to the dps being more stable and generally ends up giving higher dps.
---
Again, I dont doubt someone could create an add-on that would be pretty correct in a lot of situations, but it just wouldnt cut it in a lot of othet situations. Especially for people who has the knowledge about what works best themselves. 
---
But everyone constantly complains about mages having to drink after every encounter essentially?
---
Nope. Not doing it. Those three weeks was where a lot of us made our best game friends, guilds and started forming community in chat and in the field. Not going to play 'classic' wow where no one knows one another and you can't play together anytime you want- no matter what level of quest you are on. If Blizz doesn't want to pay for enough pipe to deal with overcrowding at first- fuck em. Sincerely. 
---
Thanks for ruining my interest in this gaem /s
---
Feels better to walk into somewhere after putting effort into having the ability to walk in there rather than just walking in because I showed up.  Been on both sides of the coin.  Never saw Plane of Time in EQ or a good chunk of naxx but saw all of TBC.
---
You call that being toxic? Jesus Christ this really is the snowflake generation
---
I can't wait for the part where you see a chest but you have to fight a mob to get to it and another player runs up and takes it.
---
Then you push the boundaries of chat rules.
---
I noticed Google Translate suddenly got phenomenally better almost 2 years ago, and even before then it had become fairly better than most machine translators.  So that's a big part of it.
---
I like the spec you have. I will go for the same. The only thing I would change in your spec is 1 point in Improved Mana Burn instead of Mental Agility. 
---
What's stopping you from raiding Naxx? Get attuned and go do it. You might not beat the first boss but that's down to you. You're not entitled to have the difficulty adjusted to your level. You don't see people throwing a fit that there's no easy mode in Dark Souls. The fact that there ISN'T means that the people that DO put in the effort to beat it get a sense of accomplishment, which is the entire reason people play games. If you remove the skill required you also remove the sense of accomplishment.
---
You can play a game of street hockey (5 man pug) any day you want, but winning it isn't going to feel the same as winning the Stanley cup (Naxx) because they're not the same and they aren't meant to be either.
---
Clearly, current retail WoW is better suited to your preferences. 
---
I always leveled as frost then respec'd to a arcane/frost raid build. Never liked fire, it was boring and felt useless beyond fireball spamming raid bosses. I played around a bit with arcane during TBC because of Arcane blast. That made dungeons so fun. Highest DPS in the game over short fights. It was below frost and fire though when it came to raid bosses because a more mana sustainable rotation had to be used.
---
You are totally missing the point of my argument - how does it diminish your feeling of achievement to walk into mythic raid X if someone else who had less time/ability gets to walk into lfr raid X?
---
You don't want others to see the same bosses you see because you don't think the "deserve" it? how does them playing the same content at a lower difficulty for less rewards affect the fun you have whilst playing? I honestly cannot understand that mindset - I have fun playing on the most challenging difficulty I can with my friends, I don't and never have given a shit what other people outside my immediate group get to see or do.  
---
On fights where there's no fear mechanic Humans are much better than Dwarves as most high end raiding priests have the talents and gear to push towards a high spirit build that benefits the 5% racial. 
---
Night elves are objectively worse than both, yes, but Human vs Dwarf is encounter specific and you can certainly put forward an argument for wanting to minmax a spirit-based build in a guild that already had lots of dwarf priests. 
---
How many Naxx encounters had Fear mechanics?
---
 There's gonna be so many feral druids tanking dungeons for people! :D  
---
There's gonna ne so many feral druids looking for a raid spot! D:
---
I would say although technology advanced quite a bit since vanilla the servers wouldn't be able to take the income of the players at launch without sharding. Wow classic launch is going to be the ultimate server test of 2019 when a few million people will check it out. Sure after a while in this busy world we live in a lot would get fed up pretty soon that there is no tag kill/loot, aoe loot, mount untill 40 and even that is only 60%, the good old 5-15 fps fights and my favorite is the jackasses who leave the rock in the vein and only take out the ore making respawn take that much longer and wait not like more people can loot same vein etc. 
---
The old players will remain but the new ones will will give up and then they can disable sharding. If i remember right during bfa launch the servers were strugling even with sharding. Im sure classis will see a lot more players.
---
Im againts sharding myself, there is nothing cooler then a capital city beeing full of visible players, or seeing a lot more people while going through zones who need the same mob as me. 
---
I think something also to note (and your response above is 100% correct), is that Private Servers do generally tend to attract a slightly more hardcore audience whereas regular servers are going to see more players who just pick based on "player fantasy".
---
You're going to see a lot more Human Mages and Undead Warlocks because these are the most common tropes and power fantasies that players gravitate to, regardless of the struggles they may see in PvP. People want to be Gandalf or Medivh or Dr Strange, and thus roll human. Same as how those attracted to demonic warlock types will probably go whole hog and roll an "evil" race to go with it.
---
A simplification of course, but the above kind of decision making is going to influence the classic server population a lot more than whether certain classes do better or worse on alliance vs horde, I feel. Or at least be a significant enough number to sway the totals.
---
So if you go back in time you lose money?
---
Let me add to this:  
---
Unconventional specs. There have been a lot of threads on this subreddit regarding specs like feral druid or ret paladin. Often these threads contain a lot of people telling you that yes you can raid as them because vanilla is easy or some variation thereof.
---
Just be aware that there will be maybe one raid spot every couple of guilds and you'll be competing against a huge amount of other people playing meme specs.
---
I am in a similar boat as you, my friend. I got less time than I had when I was younger. My plan is to first and foremost establish an economy for myself (gold makes life easier). When I have achieved this goal I can start raiding because I now have a steady income which means I can spend way less time to get consumables comparing to people who farm the gold by killing mobs or whatnot. I have done this before, so I am telling you from experience that you will save a lot of time, especially at end game raiding, if you have a steady economy for yourself.
---
People already did the math on the 5% Spirit and its nothing even in full naxx gear
---
I grew up near Detroit, Grosse Pointe South.  Moved here for GVSU and fell in love with it. 
---
It's more like if everyone is special nobody is. There's a million mounts in retail, nothing is special anymore. There is nothing to aspire to. Want cool looking gear? Transmog. Want more powerful gear? Lfr.
---
Gear is just stats, there is no uniqueness in it anymore, all rewards are cosmetic and everyone can do everything which leaves players with nothing to aspire to so they quit. It's just simple human behavior. We feel better if we work towards a goal for a time and complete it rather than get it handed over to us.
---
This goes for everything in the game. Leveling, dungeons, raiding, pvp, crafting etc. It should be about the journey to whatever goal a player has, not about the reward which I was retail is currently. It's a very common thing when someone works to achieve something for a long time that once they get it they feel empty. Like.. what do I do now? I have been working towards this goal for a long time, and now that I've reached it I got nothing to do.. it happens to everyone at different stages in life. Bjørndalen the all time Olympic record medal winner goes around giving speeches about this. He won everything so often that it was hard for him to keep his motivation up, because he had done everything. Won everything. Because working towards his goals is what was keeping him going, when he ran out of goals he didn't know what to do. He had to set himself new goals, but u can't do that in retail wow.
---
Ok, so then why are there multiple tiers of sports leagues? You don't have the choice "enter in the stanley cup or not" - your whole argument falls down when the very example you give caters to multiple ability levels with people competing at their own abiltiy level.  Darks souls was only advertised as hardcore - WoW was only ever advertised as a more accessible MMO (see no death penalty, rested xp, less grinding). Why is it in the only one thing you want to feel superior? And why do you feel less of an accomplishment if there are multiple tiers (just like sports)
---
'If you remove the skill required you also remove the sense of accomplishment.' - Again, how does introducing different tiers of skill levels stop you from feeling accomplished when you beat it on the highest difficulty? have you never played a game ever with variable still levels? 
---
If i play a team my own level and why shouldn't i feel accomplished? do lower league sports teams never feel accomplished because they don't play at the highest level? 
---
Some, not all.
---
I’m just a simple normal player, lmao.
---
If the healer dies, it’s the tank’s fault. If the tank dies, it’s the healer’s fault. When DPS die, it’s their own damn fault.
---
Yeah. I also worry about the strain on resources with higher pops, but I see the bind they're in. If they have to, then they have to. I'm all for no changes but am not going to have a panic attack if there are some. 
---
Read up about Lacoste's pricing strategy. Some products rely on a hefty price tag to give their products an inherent value. 
---
The issue with WoW and accessibility is that the journey should feel rewarding, that's what made Classic so special. If you had wagyu beef every day, you would not appreciate it as much as if you eat it once a year. 
---
Like the one in the icelake in the area outside ironforge.
---
Who gives a fuck about feral druids? LUL 
---
Also with spreadsheets using the optimal rotation you can calculate even how good shapeshifing bonus is.
---
How would they know Titanic is good for dw but not 2hand? By looking stats. After 9% hit is useless for 2hander, so it would look at that.
---
It would assume people are specced optimally of course. Obviously this is a limitation but hardly doubt that ruins the concept.
---
Again it uses spreadsheets knowing whether or not you are dagger or sword(Based on equipment) and runs a simulation.
---
TL;DR If you can make spreadsheets that estimates dps based on perfect rotation and perfect uptime, then you can estimate how good ones gear is by seeing how the estimated dps changes.
---
Obviously it's not perfect, but it's way better at estimating gear levels than even experienced players, why is that? because experienced players made them, to calculate what gear is better.
---
On nordael they did not and after 1 week they are at 20% firebloom.
---
Very true.  I tried that on a private server though and found I didn't have the discipline for it and underestimated how much I would need. Was saved from too much grinding by inheriting banks from people who quit. 
---
You were spot on about the:
---
"I'm sure we would all like to see old population caps and no sharding compared to a higher pop with sharding."
---
But to have a discussion; 'times change.' Blizzard has changed and the majority of it's playerbase has changed. What happens to a realm in the future is hard to discern. Low pop realms and realm mergers suck, but so does playing with sharding. Which is the lesser of 2 evils in the long run? 
---
I would be surprised if Blizzard can pull this off correctly. 
---
Why can't it be high pop but with dynamic respawns instead of sharding? Blizzard claims it's for server stability, economy balance, and not being able to roll back the changes. But we could say that about sharding. How will it be rolled back if at all? How did the pservers pull this off?
---
And the biggest boogeyman of sharding being implemented in city raids and world events. 
---
This stuff just hurts my brain.
---
It is very easy to find a guild and to get into raids as a fury warrior. An ideal raid comp has 10-12 warriors in it, and you really can never have too many.
---
However the reason guilds are always looking for new fury warriors is that the lowest warriors on the totem pole leave because you almost never get any gear. Being the 8th fury warrior for gear priority, you might not get a single upgrade in a month of raiding. 
---
That is why it is important to get geared as quickly as possible (and have an OT gear set) so you are at the top (or close to it) of the meters and have priority on gear.
---
".Therefore, it is important for us to have an original build of 1.12 internally, which we can use as a reference"
---
so does this mean they already have a working 1.12 but for the sake of bnet they have to backport a later patch, and make us wait until summer? ;/
---
I wasn't aware quests, 5-mans, UBRS, Molten Core and Naxx were on the same tier?
---
You're free to get a group together for the lowest difficulty setting (MC). It will probably be fine. Beating the highest difficulty level (Naxx) is a lot harder.
---
I can't really see what your problem is.
---
And yes, introducing easier difficulty levels waters the content down regardless if you can select a harder one. If God of War only had the hardest setting then beating the game would truly be a feat. Now it isn't. And Noone cares if you beat it on the hardest setting.
---
Dark souls only has one setting which means that beating it is hard, period. It's not hard due to some artificial inflation of the content.
---
There isn't a single game where awarding the best players with true rewards isn't working. Eve Online is the greatest game noone ever experiences due to the fact that the coolest shit is that exclusive to the people that put in the effort.
---
Giving the same rewards to people that DON'T put in any effort waters it down. 
---
yea, we need more alliance warlocks for easy kills pls. keep promoting it bro. 
---
It's funny that you would assume that, because someone plays on a private server, they are bound to be "elitist". That doesn't make any sense. Someone playing on a private server just likes vanilla WoW better than retail, that's all there is to it and the portion of elitist players is the same in both demographics.
---
If anything you are the toxic person here calling them "toxic spergs".
---
I understand the argument that reward levels should be more defined. I am totally on board with the idea that should have significantly less reward than mythic - as it does but that could always be increase (important to note here i wouldn't care if only the mythic versions of raids gave loot, I just want to play the bosses at the level that challenges me - nowhere have I said that LFR deserves rewards comparable to Mythic). 
---
The million mounts argument is a simple fact of a game being 12 years old with 15+ races, hundreds of raids and multiple progression path. 
---
I don't know what kind of mindset you have but I don't look at an LFR geared player and Mythic geared play in think they have been reward evenly - do you honestly believe that? If your goal is "being better than everyone" then go and work towards getting in Method - or your own server first guild - why do you think your opinion about people of lower skill than you is worth any more than the world 1st raid who say raids should be EVEN harder to keep scum like you out? why do you get to decide what difficulty level is acceptable and why is it always precisely under what you yourself are capable of? 
---
I’m not assuming that if someone plays on a private server they are elitist. I’m saying I’m glad private server elitists are going to be a minority.
---
I’m a private server player myself.
---
You have to understand something about these people and that is they are the worst types of player. They're the aspirational people who like everyone else having to wear the same tier gear because giving something for them to aspire to is more important than players looking how they want. They're the people who never went to AQ40 or Naxx but imagine it would be great because if they did then they could pretend to be cool in Ironforge. They're selfish and self-absorbed but worst of all they're not even good at the game. Mythic raiding can only be as difficult as it is because there are lower difficulty modes for others to enjoy.
---
I agree with his points but people really need to let go. It's becoming cringy how hard people are clinging onto old WoW. BC was released 12 years ago and some of you guys are still constantly talking about how it was the last good expansion, for fucks sake.
---
Depends if they do itemization right and backtrack on the 16 debuffs. Those are two really big nerfs past private servers. I can think of a few specs (will prob play one) that will work with raiding that dumbed down/nerfed for tier 1 and 2. Of course this will change in AQ. People thinking they can do that there? Well they are in for a surprise. In fact the difficulty jump from tier 1 and 2 that have been butchered to AQ is going to break a lot of guilds I think. Until that point they will have done completely fake raid content.
---
Millions of players vs thousands of players at launch. Probably can't really compare retail to private servers. 
---
But then again, I don't know the first thing about the server technology.
---
Yeah, making the 1.12 client work with all the bnet stuff of today isn’t possible.
---
I know, I wish it wasn’t that way either lol
---
&gt;There is nothing to aspire to.
---
Imagine if you ASPIRED to beat the hardest content because that is what you enjoyed doing.
---
It's certainly not very much, but it's something, and it's better than nothing on a fight where there's no Fear mechanic making fear ward 100% useless. Even tiny numbers matter when minmaxing.
---
And they wear leather, not plate
---
If everyone ate wagyu beef all day every day people would probably get sick of it pretty quick.  Even things that are amazing if you eat them all the time become the "norm" and are no longer as special as they once were.
---
Cars for most of their existence have been a shiny status symbol to show off in your driveway although I honestly could not care less(yeah being able to get from point A to B is probably the major reason to have one and why I do).
---
If all girls looked like my girlfriend the world would be a creepy place so I am going to skip that one.
---
That being said at an all you can eat sushi place I have no problems with everyone else also eating as much sushi as they can.  Anyways the point is these are terrible examples and in general most people are "shitty" because who wouldn't want to be "special" -see almost every hero/super-hero book/movie ever.
---
Lets sum it up:
---
Warriors: Have to tank very commonly. This is the definition of responsibility. Also has to kick and uses melee positioning(harder than range), has to be very careful with threat
---
Rogues: Melee class, has to kick, has to click on things in BWL doing supression room, might possiblity tank something in an emergency with evasion. Has to use vanish properly with threat
---
Feral druid(prolly the closest hybrid to being good): Has to tank often(This is like the primary reason you would bring them), has druid responsibilites like combatres, innervate (shouldn't have to buff because their buffs are weaker), apply faerie fire.
---
Warlock: Has to bring lots of shards, summon, occasionally give health stone(not used so much), 1-2 warlocks has to tank twins, keep curses up, 1 warlock has to use imp for tank with good imp positioning. Has to be careful with threat
---
Mage:
---
Has to buff, has to sheep on some encounters, often tasked with aoe situations like goblin packs, has to be careful with ignite threat, which means all mages has to stop using fire for 4seconds. 
---
Hunter: Has to pull, tranq and kite very often. 
---
IMO:
---
As a 2nd hunter and especially 3rd hunter your responsibility is very low, especially if you have 1 masterrace hunter who does all the stuff for you. At most you have to tranq something which is very easy. However there's the chance of you being backup hunter if materrace hunter isn't there. A bit risky with wanting low responsibility.
---
Mage: Very little responsibility tbh, at most you have to sheep a mob once and then just be careful with ignite. Though the ignite thing is harder than being careful with own threat, since you need to worry about all the mages threat.
---
Rogue is prolly the lowest responsibility class. You can fuck up but it doesn't really impact the raid. Obviously you have to click things in BWL and kick especially on Skeram in AQ, but other than that you have very little to worry about other than dpsing, and overaggro is not a big deal except vaelstraz. 
---
Didn't know that.
---
There's a sense of accomplishment if you are able to do something for the first time.
---
Clearing a Raid for the first time is a great accomplishment. Clearing a raid for the eleventh time, but for the first time on this specific difficulty isn't as much. You've seen it all before and done it all before. This time around everything was just a bit harder. Next time will be a bit harder still. So you didn't climb the summit, you just took another (tedious) step on the ladder.
---
It's not about casuals being unable to see a given boss for the first time as well. It's about *you* not having been in this room with this boss before, seeing it for the first time and beating it.
---
Phasing is horrible
---
Is it really a suprise to you that people enjoy exclusivity?
---
Super easy
---
Yes. They also taste like victory, achievement and hard work. 
---
switching weapons resets reckoning stacks sadly
---
I thought that was a weapon crate. Under the waterfall, right?
---
Namecalling aside, I think it's more that the more "informed" a playerbase you get, the more likelihood you get that people will misuse information in the way that gearscore tainted later versions of WoW.
---
I don't for example remember anyone rejecting human and nelf priests from raid groups in favor of Dwarf, in vanilla, but now as the OP has stated there's a meme that if you arent Dwarf you suck, which is a very different slant. 
---
People don't like that phrase 'sharding will be needed'.
---
Some would rather sit in ques than have sharding.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I'd rather have sharding than ques. Coming home from work ready to play only to sit in que for an hour always chapped my ass.
---
That’s nonsense and you know it. Retail wow is a pile of dog shit. It is a spineless attempt at creating a living, breathing world. 
---
Are we sure that we are getting an armory for our classic toons? Has anyone from blizzard mentioned it?
---
The tiers aren't  quests &gt; 5-mans &gt; UBRS &gt;Molten Core &gt; etc when it's the same game. Name me one other game that lets you play to X% completion but not further unless you move up a difficulty setting. 
---
How does anyone beating GoW on a simpler setting affect the enjoyment you have beating it on the hardest? Bragging rights over pixels to give yourself a superiority complex? 
---
The vast majority of top level athletes at the top levels of sport that they compete in don't have the same attitude as you, that says a lot. Sports teams have youth teams, charity events and such to get people involved, they don't close the door - they want people to experience the same they they do and of course the reward (pay and notoriety) will be less ' those playing at lower levels understand that. 
---
the sitting for crit is proberly not going to be in classic, since its a bug. But we will see what blizzard will do about this
---
&gt; What about if sharding around the world boss area just vanished. 
---
But the point is, world bosses are not the only place where we don't want to see sharding. We don't want it anywhere. I mean, Darkshire could be just as a place for world pvp as a dragon in the center. 
---
I just hope they will keep to their word and not let sharding go further than the starting zone of the first week or two.
---
fewest elite mobs and bosses and lowest level, people rather go for library armory and cathedral in one run, by that point you either are too high level for graveyard or dont really care about the loot at that point.  iirc x
---
Contrary to the list OP made, this is a myth I believe in. Playing a PvE dps warrior witch is all about crits and the bonus 50% crit chance on overpower that triggers on evasion seems til be my best shot at killing people outside of just iron grenade stun.  Obviously I don't PvP besides when I get ambushed by others. Care to explain why I am making the wrong assumptions and conclusions?
---
Yeah because if you have to spend 10min to do something it's awful.
---
You have to take into account that the BC reveal was shortly after Naxx's original release which made alot of guilds not want to do it as the gear would be replaced by TBC quest greens, im not taking away the difficulty of Naxx but there was less of an incentive to get the gear. 
---
I know that they mentioned it. But they say a lot things, not all of which remain true. I heard there was some issue with sharding on RP realms, where it shouldn't have been used.
---
Can you link to the thread?
---
Oh piss off with that attitude, classic needs qol improvements for blizzard to even consider keeping it up for more than a year.
---
I played Druid during vanilla and absolutely hated being forced to play as a healer from MC to Naxx while I had dreams of tanking raid bosses as a feral. I never got the chance to play as a feral DPS in raids once back then. Itemisation was awful for feral, respec costs took a massive time investiment and overall I deeply regreted my class choice until TBC where bear tanking became decent and later LK when kitty DPS became massive and a ton of fun.
---
I gave vanilla feral another shot a couple years ago because main class nostalgia. Improved theorycrafting over the years and the such sure helped raise the efficiency of feral druid in a raiding environment but the awareness about hybrid classes hasn't changed much and the amount of effort and additional grind (looking at you Pummeler) you have to put in to be on par with bad warriors is just disheartening and very symptomatic of vanilla's poor balance.
---
Last summer I rolled a Warrior and never looked back.
---
After 20? I hate druid leveling before 20. 
---
Hunter, Warlock, Druid, Shaman, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Warrior, Paladin
---
Never played paladin so I don't actually know if they are worse than warrior.
---
I agree with everything you said except that tmog should be in classic, simply for the fact that looking goofy as you levelled was a massive part of the prestige. Of coursr you look like an idiot, you are level 27. See that level 60 over there whose armour matches and looks gorgeous? That could be you.
---
Raid spot as a rogue or warrior is usually much easier then as a hunter. Having said that, trying to do a 5man as a rogue is way harder than I expected.
---
That is exactly what the video is about - accessibility to raiding by people via tiers of raid difficulty.
---
Tauren hunter
---
If theres a spot to fill with every dps in retail warriors wont have a problem in a roster thats 100% bigger than retail
---
Classic is an easy game to begin with also warriors exceed in execution phases and that there is value over other classes on certain fights
---
You know what fixes gear competition?
---
Retail loot system. It’s objectively better.
---
Yes, it's a sick way to derive enjoyment. It basically saying "i like having this, not because its good or enjoyable, but because you cant" - cant you see why that is a horrible mindset? just enjoy the fucking thing for what it is.
---
I’m can’t wait for Classic but I was actually enjoying BfA until my friend got Mythic level gear from a world boss then something else I can’t remember. Instantly put me off knowing that gear was available so easily and felt sorry for Mythic raiders. 
---
Sure they will gear faster but in the end a casual can get the same not even having to wait too long it’s absurd so I’m back to Pservers haha
---
Honestly I have always been optimistic in any expansion but at the moment BfA is incredibly poor and will probably be only worth playing at the end of its life span where everything has been added unfortunately, sad to see them lose sight so much. 
---
Too much CHAMPION! HERO OF THE WORLD! Not enough, Hello adventurer! can you help me? 
---
There is a secret to getting into raids as a fury warrior, it's actually the same as the secret to getting into raids as any class or spec.
---
Be on time, be reliable, have everything you need, know the fights, help your guild where you can, own your f*ck ups, don't bring excuses and be self-sufficient. Everything else will follow.
---
Dude sounds like he's having a great time good for him.
---
I want to play priest like I did in vanilla but on the other hand I don't want to play dwarf.
---
So I'm just not rolling a priest at all.
---
You can have this if you put in the effort. Let's not give everyone everything they want in videogames. Earn it.
---
So wagyu taste better if you worked hard to get it? so if your friend buys you it for lunch, his actually tastes measurably better than yours? Bullshit.
---
If you buy a porsche you enjoy driving it just as much as someone who was allowed to loan one for a day, only you get to enjoy it more often. If you had a porsche would lending it to a friend mean you enjoyed it less the day after because they got to understand how much fun it was without the hard work or would it be even better because you and your friend could then talk and share about how much fun your porsche is to drive?
---
from alexensual?!. do you know why he promotes dwarf priests so badly? cos he is a dwarf priest, and want to make sure his choice is absolutely correct, that he is right, and other picks are inferior. aka he is biased.
---
human buff is significant, cos spirit is valuable by itself, as it gives 5% more mana regen for a healer, and even more valuable with t2 bonus and talents, as it regens constantly in combat, so human regens 5% more than dwarf.
---
It would be enough already to push it ahead, but on top of that you get more +healing from that talent. All this calculations, t3 kek.. do you know how many buffs you got in the raid, including world buffs? it all scale up the buff, calculate with that.
---
Noone saying its some omega giant number, but if you ever played a healer in vanilla, every +healing counts, cos it affects ALL you healing spells all the time.
---
not to mention, that humans got better int and spirit base stats.
---
all of these three aspects combined make humans a superior healers, dwarfs more of an utility pick.
---
Every game becomes more difficult the further you play it. At least games you can "beat".
---
Also, all athletes (100%) have the same attitude I do. That's why they're athletes. They are driven by the will to win. It really takes an extreme winning mindset coupled with a lot of training to win at the highest level. You're being absolutely ridiculous if you try to claim pro hockey players couldn't give a shit about being the best. That's the entire reason they play. 
---
Achievements, mythic gear, mythic only mounts, world firsts, acceptance in progression guild and more are all rewards that are not removed by the exististence of LFR. Why do you gain your own reward from comparing yourself to others so much? 
---
But that doesn't have anything to do with WoW or private servers specifically, that's just how the gaming community evolved as a whole in my opinion. 14 years ago we were all bad and poorly informed but not *less elitist*, we just lacked access to information on a large scale. Nowadays guides, builds, videos etc. are very common and therefore the community is more enlighten.
---
If anything I'd say retail players are a lot more used to being spoonfed optimized builds and guides (Icy veins is *huge* compared to what EJ forum was for exemple) and will be the more demanding portion of the community.
---
You know lobster used to be the food of peasants right? It tasted just as good then (thats why people ate it almost to extinction)  as it does now - the rarity of it does not make it taste better, just more expensive.  
---
This whole sub makes me think classic is gonna be full of shitheads like this.
---
Not possible. One would have to add value for each spec for almost all level 60 items and bunch of &lt;60 items, and all that is basically manual work that needs to be done without mistakes. Theoretically possible, realistically not.
---
I'm pretty sure optimal leveling keeps you in holy until like 40/45 except you also grab improved wanding and spirit tap.
---
Don't be afraid to be gnome lock! People on the alliance are so scared of undead but honestly you don't need fear to win 1v1.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/aebq0i/video_world_of_warcraft_is_garbage_an_essay/
---
Surely it's possible, but then they'll have to backport many security fixes, they'll need to backport Lua changes to prevent Decursive and other similar addons from working, they'll need to implement modern battle.net integration. And keep it working with all future changes. They decided that they better go another way.
---
What metric are you using?
---
All games get more difficult, in their respective tier - if you start on Easy maybe the last boss is as difficult as a boss on normal - games don't say "sorry if you want to see the next boss then switch to normal mode or higher"
---
Why are you clinging to the notion that different raids are the difficulty tiers and not difficulty levels when no other game or sport is like that? How can you not play to be the best at Naxx mythic? why does it matter if there was a Naxx LFR (im not saying there should be btw) 
---
I think you must see it more as a PvP spec for healing and some dmg with reckoning with always a 2hander equiped. And in PvE you can tank/heal well enough with a 1hand and shield. The pro for this build is that you can do it all so you dont need a respec, the con is ofcourse that what you do isnt optimal but aslong as you (and your team) has fun its all cool :D.
---
Resto Shamans and Boomkins this is no argument. Like I said everyone has to respec to be on the cutting edge and their heal gear = their PvP gear and the offset pieces with a ton of dmg go to them due to armor type (leather/mail).  Getting that spellpower trinket in ZG can be tough though inside the guild. You could always go in the B group though with the alts and carry (healing) and get them though. Big deal you have to heal. If you didn't have to heal there wouldn't be 40 man raids. They would be 25 man like in TBC. That was the cost of making hybrid heal specs DPS viable. A MASSIVE Multiplayer Online RPG became less massive.
---
Ret Enhance simply have a hard road raiding, but that's not the whole story. They get really decent weapons as soon as AV opens (before that can get the Arcanite Reaper) and can compete in MUCH lesser gear that warriors. A reckoning bomb even in a combination with blue PvP gear that any casual player can get and using the Unstoppable Force is going to hurt. Same with Windfury. Eventually that gear stops being good enough, but the casual players who like those specs have had their year and a half of fun. Some people just want a class they can hop on, buy a weapon do BG's, get some ok gear and do more BG's and World PvP. For the hardcore players who want to get rank 14? The weapons are great for ret/enhance. If you want to raid to gear on a Ret or Enhance and aren't a raid leader or officer, I would ask why you are doing it in the first place. As a raid leader you can get Ashkandi, but good luck getting that as just a raider. Same with the axe in ZG or the Mace in Naxx. Think of those specs like BM Hunter. They start off strong, are really easy to initially compete with, but eventually stop being great. They are there so new players can play the game and compete. **Blizzard flat out said this was their design intention with paladins. Enhance is the same deal. You are "op" with near zero learning curve in many situations for 2/3rd of Vanilla WoW in easily gotten gear. The victim complex, especially with rets needs to stop. Enhance Shamans for some reason aren't as delusional.**
---
Feral druids are weird, especially with weapons. They have easily gotten weapons that end up better than rank 14 really early. Storm X talked about how they are probably the easiest class to actually gear for PvP. They are just a class no one understands the itemization on, that has the highest initial learning curve in the game due to macros and weird rotations in PVE with odd items like the blue 40ish crafted helm. They can easily get the gear that is GOOD for them. Atiesh? I mean seriously...it's just as hard to get for any class. Run the guild basically. 
---
On my warlock I would need demonic and dark runes because lifetap was on the gcd and it would make me lose dps. Screw your healer mana I'm trying to save a global!
---
Sounds like casual cata-fetus talk to me.
---
I played and raided a lot of vanilla wow, never on private servers.
---
Melees have a fuckton of consumables they need to use tho and they're required to farm resistance gear more than a ranged dps. Your melees are expected to be top damage on every encounter if your mage is slacking does anyone even notice?
---
Positive
---
The issue is apart from the likely-to-be-UD classes (namely clothies and rogue, that's already 4) there's warrior (most likely to be orc, but has fear counters by default), shaman (tremor+interrupts, quite an annoyance) and well, non-UD rogues are still painful. 
---
Pretty much 6/8 classes from horde (hunter, druid are just out... with druids being the least populated of all...) have strong counters to fear (even if they can be outplayed) and, well, there's still the BS trinket, shadow reflector... 
---
The benefit of ally locks is just group-wise due to having to deal with less cleansing of their DoTs (no pallies, just priests doing so), but still CC-wise they still depend on the team. WPvP, especially solo is way weaker even if can be enhanced through engineering (but hey, the opponent can do it as well.. so it's still a handicap). 
---
They wear tight-fitting leather that is correct
---
Some ppl still go to the bgs portals, at least at the horde side.
---
cos 
---
A. only there sand vendors from which you buy pvp this particular bg specific health/mana pots (cheap). and which you can only have 10 max, and you use a ton, and need constantly to replenish between bgs.
---
B. its faster and easier to requeue if you stand in the portal after bg is ended.
---
C. you can duel or test things right there, with other ppl who wait in the for queue. you don't need to ride through all the orgri every the time to get to durotar.
---
Why didnt you take the photo at the same angle:p
---
They are just stripping out retail WoW to become a mobile game
---
Sounds like a vanilla tryhard talk to me. Blizzard ain’t doing great these days, unless keeping two MMOs turns out profitable - classic ain’t staying.
---
When he says “starting summer” does he mean starting from the start of summer such as June or does he mean starting from whenever they release it in the summer which could be August or even early September 
---
You are the man! I would follow you to battle
---
When he said “starting summer” what did he mean by this? Start of Summer? Or starting whenever they release it in the summer? 
---
This is communication 101, it's nothing but PR-speak and you're eating it up. He says what we already got told on BlizzCon, but you still manage to hear something different. You hear confidence and an early summer release, when in reality he's sticking to the given script for a question that's certain to be asked. 
---
Oh, and speaking of cata. Someone who started playing then played wow more than people vanilla players at cata release.
---
Agree! I much prefer going to the entrance and maybe doing some wPvP (Tarren Mill vs Southshore!) or some duels while I wait for my queue to pop, rather than sitting in Orgrimmar staring at the walls inside that building.
---
Hopefully we get at least 4 years before TBC is pushed. I have no intention of rushing or sacrificing the quality of my rl to accomplish what I want to do in classic (kill KT).
---
If NEETs/shut-ins run out of content a week after Naxx releases, should the rest of us be forced to move on again when the stated aim of the project is vanilla for as long as wow exists?
---
Wow. You must be very capable to decide how much people enjoy things and for what reasons. If someone were to offer me a porsche right now, I would be hella glad for sure. But if it had been my dream for 15 years to work hard to someday drive my own purcahsed Porsche, it can be make me relatively even more glad, no matter what some edgy guy in Reddit talks about ”measureable” enjoyment.
---
In German it sounds like it’s supposed to be released at the start of summer but since the interview was in English for sure I don’t trust them that they translated that correctly so we better don’t get our hopes up.
---
Makes sense. Thnx for explaining.
---
It's more like "I enjoy having this because it was a struggle getting it". 
---
jesus christ it got 18 upvotes T_T.
---
"Imagine traveling to a dungeon to do it. i don't need to imagine it, i did it and it was awful." 
---
Imagine traveling in the WORLD of warcraft (i rather sit in one city and queue, more comfortable and convinient therefore its good Kapp), imagine making friends and warlocks to summon you, imagine you need to communicate with other ppl and organize stuff, imagine bgs feel more valuable, special and exciting, and imagine using mage portals from your friends, imagine not sitting in one city and having a different hs from Ironforge, imagine Darnassus wouldnt be so empty and actually used, imagine world pvp between queues cos each factions portals are nearby, imagine not jumping in circles in main city, imagine most ppl wouldnt be so lazy and dumb to upvote your post? we woudlnt have wow we got now.
---
I’m praying for a July or later release. There’s way too much stuff going on in June like exams etc 
---
Thanks for the link. Missed that.
---
I played lock on nost and that's crazy! So basically if you missclick summon demon in combat your pet instantly dies. Very interesting. It does give me a vanilla vibe. The game doesn't hold your hand you make a mistake you're punished for it. I sort of like it. Wonder what other little things like this they got wrong.
---
You dont get my point at all - would driving the porsche you worked hard for feel less glad if you knew your friend was given a slightly slower version of the same car by his dad as a birthday present? 
---
Its not about working hard, you can still work hard and become WF in retail, it's about your enjoyment of the game being diminished because someone else gets to experience an easier version of the same content without the same level of effort.
---
I ask again, would your experience of driving your porsche that you worked hard to get be affected in any way by knowing that there are people out there having the same experience as you without any effort at all? If the answer is yes then i'm sorry, you're not enjoying the car, you're enjoying your superiority and thats a dickhead kind of feeling.
---
Gid gud, scrub.
---
i honestly dont think it will be all that fun. especially with sheep/fear/scattershot/blind/freeze trap,charm removing reck stacks. but yea i say try it and have fun thats all that matters. but i would make sure i have spritiful focus and precision. its very important to be able to heal without being interrupted by damage and when you hit someone that you dont miss all your reck hits due to no hit rating 
---
Oh... rip. Man that makes my choice a lot easier though lol!
---
Warrior white hits and Mortal Strikes hits rogues like a truck. A MS and autoswing will put you in execute range. Fury can get lucky and one shot you with autoswings and the Bloodthirst if you don't dodge anything. 
---
This is one reason Tauren is kind of underrated IF their hit box also works like it did in real vanilla. Those stunned targets (as you seemed to notice) can't dodge and rogues don't have a PVP trinket to get out of stun. You could sit on rage and dumpster rogues inside the stuns from stomp grenade. Warrior usually beats rogue anyways though and Orc PVE DPS racials are much better.
---
It's not just low level tho. You see a warlock in t2 and you see a lock in a mismatch of nefarian and Rare offtier drops and you know the guy in the random assortment of gear is gonna do 3x the dps. Like yea it looked fucking stupid but you better not laugh cus hat clown is gonna murder the shit out of you.
---
Same here.  I resubbed one month on a whim a while back, got up to 110 and thought, "no way am I paying another $50 *and* repeated subscription fees for more of this".  It should be one or the other...pay for subscription, or pay for expansions, but not both.  The game just isn't worth it.
---
No, birthday presents dont make me less glad. But if EVERYONE had a porsche as a birthday present, it would lose its value as a hardly obtainable object and an achievement. An MVP award that is hard to obtain and awarded only to the best athlete sure makes one a lot happier knowing that he is the only one of all these others, that was able to get his hands on this award. Should they feel bad for others that only get some secondary awards? Maybe everyone should get their own version of MVP awards given to them as well. And thank you, but I dont need your sorry.
---
Waaaa! Just give me everything without having to work for it! Waaaaaaa!!!!
---
Heh I’m hoping as early as possible. Can’t stand the wait 
---
And you can't still enjoy things that are hard to get, even if other people have a lower quality version that was easier to get? Or if some people gave no effort to get it?
---
You know everything that you have or ever done that you are proud of has been achieved or obtained by someone with little or no effort? does that mean you don't derive any satisfaction from anything because you know others had gotten/achieved the same thing with less effort?
---
agreed with you jirconny.
---
The vanilla distance is from like 2004.
---
Okay, makes sence :)
---
It's an interesting thought, not sure how valuable a few silver is over just grinding exp though
---
*Activision*-Blizzard is in this whole mess **BECAUSE** they ignored their core audience and went casual and mobile friendly and this is coming back to bite them in the ass now.
---
They used to be all about "Gameplay first". Now I dont know...
---
That's pretty solid really. Thats something like I was gonna go beforehand. I have a feeling the game is going to be very easy with itemizations so we'll see what happens. Also dungeons I can always drink. I think interfire is underrated though for PVP
---
what?
---
&gt;went casual
---
You do realize that casual was at wows core since vanilla, right?
---
Calling people that started in cata fetuses when the expack was out for 8 years is not exactly smart
---
Yes you're absolutely right about divine fury. I mostly be getting it to be viable in dungeons. I feel like my build would be useful in mc, dungeons and PVP. I was mostly looking forward to not having to Respec til 2nd patch
---
Oh, spare me the sheep herd mentality lesson. I don't keep up with the Classic news enough to really care whether it's true or not, it was a quick and innocent assumption. I'm hoping for a late summer release anyway since I want to spend it outside.
---
Horde priest is a pretty nice niche because you dont have paladins.  Shamans are best at raid healing and druids are druids so you basically get the majority of the responsibility for keeping tanks alive.  On alliance it is usually split between paladin and priest with the paladin having more of a tank healing perspective and priests group healing.
---
If you can just get devilsaur set then you're likely fine. Also thrash blade and something else are good. Just put enough effort in to say 'hey I'm a top dps spec and I care enough to get a decent amoubt of gear pre-raid. Then when you do raid just don't be shit.
---
If Blizzard does read these posts this this the conversation they need to see. Sometimes we get suck in a state of mind we forget the other implications.
---
I just want to test the waters about how people might feel about the possible compromise.
---
And just so you're prepared, blizzard didn't really promise anything, they just kind of stated temporary sharding in early zones. Pretty vague.
---
Human priests are viable and it's not like you will get turned down for being one, at best you will maybe get laughed at. On horde side there are even more options.
---
T1 is not even good for mages, the actual numbers would be higher. Regardless, alchemy is not a bad choice, but it's important to consider that the limiting factor in getting flasks is actually Black Lotus, a herb that is constantly camped because it's pretty damn rare (and expensive).
---
"oH NoeS doNt leT oThR PeoPLe see My SPeCiAl PiXeLs! THEY HAVEN'T PASSED THE SPECIAL TEST TO SEE MY SPECIAL PIXELS!!!!!!!"
---
I'm not a retail apologist, because I think BFA is total garbage right now, but is he seriously complaining that they released a mount instead of fixing the game's issues? What, does he want the art team to switch to programming? The fuck is he talking about?
---
No one has said anything about threat here yet, but fury warriors do have a threat problem. Pull aggro at the wrong time and it's a wipe. 
---
This is even more an issue for horde with windfury totem and no salvation - which is what I played at the time.  
---
Salvation helps a lot I suppose, but remember paladins wont want to class-bless warriors with salvation, so you'll need to enslave one of your palas to keep blessing you every 5 minutes.
---
Waaaaa I suck at the game and want to have it all now waaaaaa!!!
---
world of paladincraft thats some good shit.
---
And i do belive its proc from Quel'serrar.
---
And then his internet dies as soon as Herod is dead, right? 
---
5000 isn't vanilla server cap. Some people take longer in character creation, then mess with settings. It's a non-issue
---
Just stick to retail buddy, it clear classic won’t be for you.
---
Ahhh dual shadows. I loved this series back in the days &lt;3
---
M O T H E R T R U C K E R!
---
"Sheep herd mentality lesson" for telling you exactly how it is? Again a 'quick and innocent assumption' about what I said. Did I say anything bad about Blizzard? No. I pointed out how pointless the question was because Blizzard aren't ready to disclose their release date yet, it wasn't a stab at Blizzard. 
---
It's exactly your kind of 'quick and innocent assumptions' that feed the real clueless ones with delusions and hope about an earlier release (in this case) when nothing of the sort was mentioned and you instantly get defensive when faced with facts. 
---
My sheep mentality lesson is not as much a sheep mentality lesson as much as it is to actually know what is really being said and knowing how corporate communication works. 
---
But whatever, read and comprehend text as you please.
---
Ur wrong... will not happen. No issues. Private servers have launches smooth and easy with larger caps than u suggested and with worse servers.
---
I suppose it's a matter of perspective. For one that started in 2004, then someone who started in Cata would indeed be defined as a fetus. The commonly used derogatory slurs being:
---
TBC-Kids
---
Wotlk-Babies
---
Cata-fetuses
---
MoP-sperms.
---
Agreed,they really should do something about that, lit torches in rain kinda kills the immersion.
---
Why wouldnt there be? 
---
Maybe in pservers...less hardcore in classic, people will be more lenient
---
I think it does, and so does darkmoon card afaik but not sure about the coefficient. Some items scale a lot better and some really badly. Also we dont know how blizzard will make items scale cus some items like kazzak's neck that adds fire dmg o autoattacks is pretty crazy with original 100% spell coefficient which it had iirc.
---
Let's be realistic here guys.
---
We all know this is gonna be a thing. It's the mentality nowadays. It didn't exist back then simply because people didn't think about it then, not some technical difficulties.
---
It will not be identical to GS (because vanilla itemization is different) but yes, we WILL have some kind of addon to separate people into "good" and "bad" players.
---
All of you saying "if this is in the game I'll quit" better quit now to save yourselves soe dissapointment.
---
They still have rare mobs in retail?
---
"Waaaaa how do I know if i'm having fun if everyone cant see how amazing i am"
---
It really depends on how the launch is. If there is sharding I won't worry about chest chasing. But if there is none and it's a shit fest in starting zones I want plans to do other things.
---
The only toxic elitist people I found on private servers were those that were actually pushing for server firsts. That was, even on private servers, 1% of the population. The vast majority of private server players are exactly the same people that have played retail until now. No difference at all.
---
With only MC/Ony out for like the first 5-6 months, spend most of your time stockpiling stuff for later. This is sound advice for pretty much anyone, as the average person's gold/hr usually doesnt increase at the same rate of consumable prices, consumables are usually very cheap early on, and kills your wallet like a big steam sale around aq/naxx release.
---
Waaaaa give me everything for free cus I'm a scrub waaaaa!!!
---
Try finding a screenshot from which I couldn't guess whether the characters have appropriate gear for a given raid.
---
Rogues are NOT the worst leveling class.. I have played vanilla since Alpha and recently leveled almost all classes in private servers and rogue is probably one of the fastest and easiest leveling classes.. You just kill non-stop.. Sick of people being "experts" nowadays...
---
At this point just don’t play fucking Classic. Retail isn’t being cancelled.
---
[[Blade of Ternal Darkness]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17780)
---
This blade is like a gimped version of the original, because after 3 procs it will be deleted :(
---
1. No one ever said that.
---
2. They are. For leveling, that's why people recommend them.
---
3. OK
---
4. Yes they are worse than horde ones. Stop spreading misinformation. Decursive favoring alliance wtf where that came from?
---
5. You don't, but prepare to be substitued for one at any time.
---
6. They are OP in PvP when they have all their cooldowns up. Not as OP as in 1.1 but yeah, still really really strong.
---
7. It is the most unbalaced "exp" for sure, but that's not exactly a bad thing.
---
Sorry, but your post kinda sucks
---
The interview really gives me hope that they are working on it with a lot of passion. Actually WoW classic is the only game I'm looking for in 2019, can't wait to sink some time in after work without worrying about missing content if I don't want to rush through the content within half a year.

---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community. 
---
**What we expect of members:** 
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.

As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes. 
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.

How can we forget when people keep bringing it up all the time?
---
Why are you going on a rampage in this thread? I assure you that ranting at people here isn’t going to change anything for classic. You really need to chill out.
---
Informed and better? Like the OP that thinks SL locks are imba (prolly cause he was keyboarding turning vs them), doesn't even mention full destro-locks and points rogues as "the worst leveling class".. 
---
Yeah, I would love to fight vs those "informed and better" players all the time when classic hits.
---
Atm on my pserver, I'm raiding 12h a week (3x4h), cleaning all content from MC to Naxx.
---
I need another 2-3h just to farm my consumables, and I need maybe 1h before each raid to prepare stuff, consumables, farm 60 shards and get WB (dmt, zg, rend, ony/nef, SF, dmf...)
---
I'm buying half of my consumables and play a bit with AH to make money.
---
I'm full BiS (+Atiesh) so I don't need extra money/time for enchants, and we're doing fine on raids, cleaning Naxx in one night, so we don't need extra consumes.
---
I would suggest atleast 20h/week. But if you don't mind missing a raid, and if you're guild doesnt force you to tryhard with flasks, you can be fine with 12h/week.
---
Play Horde and your problem is solved.
---
You have to understand I was like 13 at the time, and still fairly new to wow. I didn't even have my own account, my brother-in-law let me use his account to level my charcater, lol.
---
Good part is that places like STV sort of thin out the masses of Warriors around 30 on a pvp server. Warriors get shit on so much during leveling that it discourages enough people.
---
&gt; Hopefully they are only a small portion of the population.
---
Yeah, right... Classic WoW is only being a thing because of those players, you know?
---
dw BfA is just like legion, only with another story in another location and your old gear, including your artefact weapo is completely worthless again.
---
Nah I don't want to see the eclipse, I just saw one yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that.... Wait, no I didn't, eclipses are pretty rare and it's neat to see one BECAUSE THEY AREN'T COMMON.
---
Human warlock named taekwondo. Was like 7 or 8, and I had my brother help with making him. I was in a taekwondo class at the time
---
I'd rather take that than sharding. And under 20? Absolutely not. You're going to spend a lot of time in the 12-20 zones, having the experience ruined for that long would ruin any kind of community feeling we were hoping to build.
---
"Waaa no one can experience anything unless they are conveniently exactly at or above the ability level i believe i am at waaaaaa"
---
They will be more lenient, but there'll still be huge amounts of Fury Warriors around. If you can get in with friends, then great. But just because people are more lenient on classic doesnt mean that it'll be any easier to get one of the 5-6 DPS warrior slots in a raid group when 12 fury warriors all want them. 
---
Possibly hyperbolic numbers but there's definitely going to be a LOT of fury warriors. You may not need to have BIS gear but should definitely be willing to tank. A fury warrior who refuses to tank at all shouldnt expect to get any raid spots anywhere.
---
Not just b.net, many other things, including their anti-cheat engine. If they used the old client it would be filled with bots like privates servers are.
---
&gt; The question is,will classic be like cataclysm,battle for azeroth and others
---
God I hope not
---
None. I want to experience classic wow as it was, maybe only with the option(!) to have better graphics. Guild halls and capturable zones? Imagine if your guild captures a zone just by being there, without it being a game feature. That'd be fun especially because everyone on the server would know "yeah that zone is owned by guild X".
---
I think they did not do it on ND to keep the timeline speeded up to be in time for the release of classic but it was the case on LH
---
I think Ion was probably under a lot of pressure from Brack to make game decisions to increase sub numbers by any means necessary.  He never even had to say those words to him.  Brack never had to say, "Ion, I want you to bring in the subs."  All Brack had to do was foster the culture of growth by congratulating the team when the sub numbers went up and starting an inquisition if they went down.  "Our numbers are down this month; why did this happen?  What can we do to reverse it?"  He promoted and rewarded designers whose features brought in subs and shelved the guys who didn't.
---
Shelved designer: "But J, the dungeon finder will destroy the community of WoW..."
---
J: "Isn't the goal to get as many people to play the game as possible?  We need the casual audience to let everyone experience World of Warcraft, not just the people who have time to sit in the LFG channel for 45 minutes."
---
It's nefarious and simple.  I've seen this at corporations so many times.
---
Phasing has it's good things, specially lore-wise when after some camp/place is bombed it actually stays bombed for you. But yeah, It works better in a single player game.
---
Now, sharding, that's just... really bad
---
My first character was a druid, because I did not know what I want and a friend of mine suggested to roll druid to check out different roles. 
---
Needless to say, we all were keyboard turners and clickers and he leveled his warrior in protection and I went for a balance because "Star-related" power like Starfire and Moonfire seemed to be really cool. Eventually he gave up on warrior in early level 50s and I in mid-40s because Hurricane (It used to be the last talent point in balance tree, oomkin form was introduced later) did not live up to my expectations.
---
I guess that's a matter of opinion. I would say Rogues are pretty painful to level in the early stages, because they are squishy but have to stick to melee and facetank everything while any good warrior will hamstring kite with a slow 2H and take minimal damage leading to less downtimes. Surely paladins are slower (and super boring) but their sustain is much better.
---
I would argue that SL Lock is a lot more cheesy and lame 1v1 while destro has more front loaded burst but takes more skill to execute. I'm sure we'll see more SL locks and SPriest because they are known for being "noob stompers".
---
Compared to the mmo's of the late 90s and early 00s absolutely that isnt the point here. The point is that vanilla was harder, grindier but also more rewarding than later expansion; Thus making later expansions casual by comparison.
---
Is the hunter timer the thing to time your auto shots with your movement?

Does seeing eclipse lose its value if 10 million other people see it too? What if you flew 10k miles to see it, do the people who just already lived they and got to see it without any effort enjoy your enjoyment of the eclipse?

Does seeing eclipse lose its value if 10 million other people see it too? What if you flew 10k miles to see it, do the people who just already lived they and got to see it without any effort enjoy your enjoyment of the eclipse? Should people be prevented from looking at the eclipse if they don't pass the required test to appreciate it as much as you?

If you answer to these questions is yes then you're a dick.

The rarity isnt the issue, its the gatekeeping preventing others from seeing the exacct same thing because they "arent worthy".
---
In vanilla wow when you kick someone you’re run is effectively done most of the time.
---
You can’t summon from inside the instance, it’s huge work to replace anyone other than dps class and in general groups fall apart after a kick.
---
Plus, one or two Needs is all a ninja needs.
---
No joke read that exact story before coming here. I was swindled!
---
A gear score mod would call my BiS BWL geared fury warrior shit tier since the avg iLvl would be below 60, a DPS warrior in full valor would probably have higher gear score than me, and do roughly a fifth of the DPS.
---
Lol. You make this comment as if you know or play vanilla private when clearly you don’t. I’ve been playing private servers for years and you’re flat out stupid to think ninjas suffer any sort of consequences. Don’t be naive. Just doesn’t ever happen. 
---
The rock paper scissors will get back at you, you annoying thing! Just wait until I get my Reckoning stacks! Then you'll see! *You'll ALL see!*
---
This is fucked, I came here hoping for a real conversation about classic and this sub is now dominated by casuals complaining that achievements, mount sharing and other shit will not be included.
---
Plus they heavily downvote anyone who disagrees.
---
There’s gotta be some sub we can go for people who support real classic?
---
You sure this isn't nostalgia speaking?
---
You're worse than the tank in that situation imo.
---
Even if it could (which it can't) it wouldn't mean anything. Those people who made Blizz what it was are gone now, Blizzard would be only Blizzard in name.
---
Sad but we have to admit that there's just no way back now.
---
They already have. Read the post
---
One of the major reality checks for BFA players is to realize that heals are slow in classic.
---
Yes, priests have flash heal.  Yes, paladins have flash heal.  But both of these are expensive and weak and cannot be spammed.
---
I play a resto druid and the most optimal way for me to play is to throw slow, big heals.  No, I am not going to top you off when you are at 85% health before the next pull because it's going to reset my 5 second rule and if you make me drink after every pull the dungeon is going to take the rest of our lives.
---
When a DPS pulls threat, by the time my heal finishes on the tank and I start my next one, that might be a 5 second wait- and you might not be my highest priority.  *Every* DPS class in the game needs to be able to survive at least 10 seconds of threat on a mob in classic.
---
Thats not server-side bug. Thats terrain bug, thats client-side problem that is present in ALL clients up to WotLK.
---
A female, undead mage which was also my main.
---
Did you ever play vanilla?  Not trying to gatekeep just wondering.  There were casual guilds in Vanilla raiding, but those raids took weeks/months to down Rag.  You're still limited to 2-3 pieces per boss for 40 people, sometimes you just didn't have the gear to clear Onyxia or Molten Core.  Some of the more hard core guilds had their raiders get Pre-raid BiS and bring full consumables and raided for 5 nights a week.  People weren't excluded, people were limited by the amount of work they wanted to put into it.  If you're guild took months to down Rag, because people were in blues/greens or not BiS other guilds didn't have that issue and already had those on farm ready for BWL.  It really was a long journey as a team that made the end result worth it.  Raiding/Pvping in full tier 2 around EPL/BRM was the most fun I've had in WoW hands down
---
What's the analogy? Vanilla WoW didn't say "sorry, switch to harder difficulty to play Naxxramas". It was just harder. Sonic 1 didn't ask you to swap difficulty either. The latter stages were just harder.
---
If you want to have instant gratification where everyone wins and noone is allowed to be better then just play another game? I don't understand where you're coming from. Everything you're whining about is the VERY REASON that people want vanilla WoW back.
---
If you feel the retail version has done it better then play the retail version. It's not that hard.
---
I've been playing WoW on and off since 2004 and on private vanilla servers 2012 to now so no, it's not nostalgia. Vanilla is superior to every single expansion that came after. That being said, I did like TBC.
---
The swing timers work for hunter to. It's a big bar on the screen that counts down to the next auto. I am not saying it's impossible to learn or anything, but it's a third party addon to play the class correctly/easier, which for brand new players might not be great. 
---
Rogues use it as well raiding due to sword specialization. If you clip the autoswing you won't get as many sword procs. It's very nice to use for leveling a shaman or warrior to.  You can kite with hamstring or earthbind totem and only get in melee range when the melee swing is up on the 2 hander. You take a lot less dmg. 
---
With a rogue you use a bar addon in pve and pvp (energy tick).  So you just kind of get used to it. 
---
Let's sacrifice our own fun and kill wpvp so our streamer overlords can have fun. God forbid, I would never disobey my favourite streamer. Infact I'm gonna donate 500 dollars to him so he can keep ''working''
---
there isn't many of us left sadly
---
&gt;And you can't still enjoy things that are hard to get, even if other people have a lower quality version that was easier to get?
---
Not to the same extent. Having a super rare item on your character feels like more of an accomplishment if I'm one of the few people that have it, compared to having the same item as everyone else except yours just has slightly higher stats.
---
&gt;You know everything that you have or ever done that you are proud of has been achieved or obtained by someone with little or no effort? does that mean you don't derive any satisfaction from anything because you know others had gotten/achieved the same thing with less effort?
---
No, because in a good game that means they are either extremely dedicated or talented and thus deserve it. 
---
I'm so happy I can click translate on google chrome! This is pretty interesting actually.
---
My at that time best friend, who also introduced me to WoW, helped me creating my first character - a human priest. I was 12 y old and lacking creativity. 
---
The name finally I came up with after 30 minutes was ‘Xholy’. I did not understand a single thing about WoW and just ran around in the world exploring for the most part. I also NEVER specced into any holy talents (funny cuz of my name). I instead put all talents in shadow and the rest in disc, and only points in the worst talents of course (meme spec).
---
Today, when I look back, I somehow realize my friend kind of tricked me to roll a priest cuz he wanted free heal-slave for his rogue, but I guess he eventually realized how shit I was at the game. 
---
This was in very early TBC, btw. Once WotLK came, I turned into an achievement-wh*re, and dedicated my teenage life to that until Cata came and I quit cuz by then I had more knowledge of the game and I thought it turned out to be too boring. 
---
Yet wrath was WoW's highest point.
---
It’s pretty easy to see that it is the sharding action itself that is the problem. 
---
If other players - sometimes huge amounts at the same time - randomly pop in and out of your world, that is rediculous.
---
If you are chasing a pvp enemy that suddenly disappeara into another shard, that is rediculous. 
---
If the raid on BRM, that other group on its way through pre-instance deadmines, or that dueling tournament suddenly shards, that is redidulous and laughable amd immeraion breaking. 
---
Sharding is not worth it, it completely ruins the game. Seriously, DONT negotiate on this point. DO NOT “put yourself in the shoes of developers”. 
---
The only sharding that can be marginally acceptable is below level 10 or so in the starting areas. Even that will be a problem, and they will have to extens this to level 20, and possibly 30. This sucks and ruins the first part of the game. 
---
Ask yourself what’s more important: empathy for some thought-up problem some devs may have to balance server poplations, that their bosses want them to “solve” by just using sharding, or making the game work and function the way it has been proven to in the past.
---
Lo and behold: There was no sharding in vanilla! And it was a huge success. 
---

#nostockholmsyndrome
---
this is the classic wow fanbase (retail babies) mentality in 2019
---
Right so this is just another 'WHAT ABOOT POST NAXX CANTENT' post. 
---
I never played Horde past lvl 20, recently went through wc3 again and wanna play horde but in the past, can't do that in retail anymore.
---
I think statements like "I can 2v1 2 rank 14's with blue gear" basically tells you how much of an asshat OP is.
---
But dworfs are cool as fuck?
---
Anyway just go horde? Or human priest tbh as long as you just argue that you hate dwarf looks i think a fair amount of guilds will be okay. The problem is with people who don't know how strong dwarfs are.
---
Not this manchild again. Smh.
---
My post thinks of ways to get them and their followers on PVE servers so they don't ruin our fun. Our fun wouldn't be ruined at all. I don't watch streamers. I'm past 40. The entire thing is a mystery to me when it comes to MMO's. I think Classic will kill retail WoW. I don't want to see the repeat of garbage Arena again or the RBG community, which is the worst collection of people in any game. If they shut down RBG's today in Retail WoW nothing of value would be lost. It would just mean a bunch of exploiters who make a living off selling carries would need to go work at Burger King.
---
If you think streamers/influencers aren't important to Blizzard and can't be a threat to our fun all over again? Might want to read this article. Once Classic gets popular again who do you think they are going to let poison the well all over again? The wannabe esport athletes and people that need content to promote the idea they are "pro". I say give them a outlet that doesn't ruin the game this time around. See if it works.

---
Female human warrior, same one I've played every expansion since.
---
And they run off doing /train. I can see it now. lol
---
I’m still loving retail and I’ve been playing for 12 years. To me it just seems that people’s expectations are higher than they need to be and they complain about every little thing while the game is still great. 
---
Maybe try to level your cooking skill
---
You get 13% spell crit from world buffs in vanilla. Funny enough my retail character gets about the same baseline from passives. I think when they removed world buffs from the game they were worried combat would feel too slow and baked the stats in through talents in wotlk.
---
You got me! Guy in my 40's who thinks streaming is stupid and who has never subbed to a streamer in his entire life. I'm worried about the game being ruined by streamers/influencers. Not trying to ruin it for streamers.
---
You know that the answer to all those questions are "yes", you're just virtue signaling.
---
GS became a thing only after the community went to garbage thanks to the LFG tool, server transfers, and so on.
---
In small communities (like on pservers) your rep is what counts.  You can have garbage gear but if you don't let anyone in your 5 man die and don't need to drink a single time, they're going to remember that and you're going to get invited again.  In classic, people friend good tanks and healers so they can run stuff.
---
Occasionally, pugs will require an inspect on the IF bridge before invite or something, but that's fairly rare.
---
The eclipse loses value if it happens every day visible from everywhere in the world, yes. Quit being bitter because you suck at wow.
---
The meta of classic servers will be somimated by the ps crowd for sure
---
Close to those times. I'm is PST, and we were discussing 6pm-10pm, which I think is 9pm-1am EST. Right now, Tue/Thurs is one option with weekends off unless we are grinding new content and need an additional raid that week, but only 1-2x per month will we raid weekends. We might have our 20 man instances on weekends so there's an option, but won't need all 40.
---
join the troll master race.
---
I agree with you. 
---
I just can't help my brain from thinking! 
---
Streamers are already liable to mess up big part of classic as it is just by being there, no need to help them with it.
---
Same here. WotLK destroyed a part of the community with gearscore. Now ilvl is so closely tied into the game with the loot escalator gameplay, everything is ruined.
---
I'd actually like to see this sub sharded to prepare everyone for launch day.
---
If you go by number of subscriptions yes I suppose it was. From a gameplay and overall "fun" standpoint I respectfully disagree though.
---
Yeah I was Raidleader and GM of a progressing guild in vanilla, managed to clear AQ40 and try a bit of Naxx before TBC launched. 
---
None of what you have said is diminished or incompatible with having multiple tiers of difficulty per raid, I think we can all agree that blizzard fucked up with itemisation of LFR /normal /hc and mythic - but I also know that after years of playing hardcore that I still want to experience the story of WoW because thats all I have the time to do - remove gear from every level of raiding aside from mythic and i'd still be happy there is an LFR to let me see how the story from the expansion plays out. Me seeing a raid boss die doesn't remove the enjoyment that you gained from killing him on the hardest level. 
---
When i was RL we used to take low geared non-guildies from IF into MC and BWL when it was on farm, their reaction from getting to see stuff they wouldn't normally see was priceless. And i cant think of one time i felt better about getting an item than i was about killing a boss, or one time i killed a boss on mythic and thought "that was nice, but loads have killed this on LFR so its meaningless" - I was just happy to kill the guy on the difficulty i wanted with my friends - what everyone else did in the game didn't change that.
---
One thing I liked about having to go to zones to queue up for the specific BG was the world PVP that occurred.  On my server anyway, we would quite often have world PVP action going on at the border of ashenvale/barrens while waiting in queue for WSG.
---
lol okay kid, it's time for you to go to school.
---
Female Night Elf Druid named Andromath. She never made it past level 11, and she was made back in wotlk. 
---
A human paladin, made about a month after launch (I was more a SWG player at the time). I always played paladins or warriors as cavaliers/knights in D&amp;D, so paladin was my choice in WoW having no idea about the class, viability of specs, or how it all balanced out in the game.
---
I also had it in my head that the abilities/spells were special things, and should only be used in special/boss fights. So I would ‘conserve’ my abilities by only using them once in a while. I finally abandoned the toon around low 40’s in Tanaris when I picked up warrior and tanked it.
---
Yes, this means I white-damaged my way to the 40’s in vanilla wow on a paladin. The upside was I didn’t die much. 
---
Rediscovering the paladin class in WotLK was amazing.
---
Driving around in a brand new 2018 model Mercedes that you spent your hard money on while all of the noobs scuttle beneath you in there crappy generic cars. It wouldn’t be the same would it if every single person rich or poor could own one? Exact same concept for raiding and earning that epic loot.
---
I agree that they could potentially be a problem. They are gonna want content that they can sell do better at other people in. That's the point of my post. It also depends on the streamer I think. Some really do care a lot about the integrity of the old game it seems. Others care about their "content". I'm just trying to think of content that won't ruin the game this time around.  If you don't give some an outlet they are going to trash the game and attack it and try to convince others not to play it. That doesn't make them evil if they got a kid to feed either. I get it and I understand that it's a job.
---
I also never intended to ruin Wpvp. That is why I tried to brainstorm ideas like the outdoor queue. Maybe put it in Tauren Mill/Southshore. This would make it impossible for larger streamers to ruin (they would go to PVE servers) and would keep a fun arena fun for longer. If guilds want to have a tournament they would still have to fight for it.
---
I agree with someone else on the post that it's almost certain someone will try to make that does the same as GS, but I think the community and you(as part of it) should resist it.
---
The alternatives I've suggested so far are not only more accurate predictors of positive raid contribution, but they avoid GS's many pitfalls.
---
I do get the point that it "reduces everyone to a number" but at the same time I can see some benefits:
---
At a glance I can check for:
---
* BiS scoring of gear
---
* Scoring of gear per spec
---
* Scoring of gear based on completion of content
---
* Scoring for theoretical Class performance (dps, healing, tanking)
---
I'm not saying that "gear score" should be the end all be all, where skill and personality doesn't matter, but I can see some benefits.
---
Yeah idk what people are talking about rogues being the worst.  When you're practically 1 shotting any caster mob with a good dagger on ambush crits, huge CC potential, sprint every couple minutes AND ambush?  Not to mention stealthing past all the BS while questing to skip the "harder" content if required.  My rogue got to 60 WAY faster than my warrior and my friend leveling his 3rd 60 as a priest in /played time.  Much easier (although still tough) to solo elites too with kiting thanks to CP/poisons/evasion.
---
They should just take the MMORPG label off of retail WoW at this point.
---
It's an insult to all the OG devs who poured their hearts into creating the legendary WC3, Vanilla and TBC.
---
I made a reddit comment regarding a videogame. Not a fact presented in a thesis, if my assumption gives another redditor false hope then bless the poor bastard.
---
Trolling or just very salty that you were/are to shit to finish a raid.
---
Get in early
---
Blasted lands, grinding mats for ROIDS.
---
Those are all instances in horde controlled zones that are completely safe for horde and not for alliance. Alliance rarely, seldom go there *because* of the wpvp implication, the loot in those places doesn't justify the time.
---
Same reason why horde don't go to VC, it's not justified. I stand by my opinion
---
You could grab flight paths. Super convenient later on
---
My first character was a Night Elf Hunter probably 4-5 months before TBC. I will never forget getting to level 5 and thinking that I will soon be able to wear plate gear, I just have to level up. Oh the delusions.
---
I was 14 when I installed wow for the first time, as the open beta started. My first character had to be a dwarven paladin called Morgi since I played this class in Diablo 2 and loved the ability to heal myself while running around in plate with a huge hammer. 
---
I remember that I only got to level 24 until the beta was closed. I started again with a paladin at release but eventually resigned at level 10 and rerolled a night elf hunter. Yeah, it was mainly because of shadowmelt. It took me about a year to reach level 60 and I wasn't able to buy my mount until a generous guildmate paid for it at level 55.
---
Best time in my life.
---
Undead Warrior on friends account, got it to level 8.
---
After that I played on another friends account for a few years until I got my own PC and account where I made a Troll Hunter who is now a Human Hunter (Sylvanas made me quit playing Horde) still my main  though 
---
Rogue do not kill non stop, you are stopping to bandage and eat all the damn time. 
---
&gt; You have to understand I was like 13 at the time, and still fairly new to wow
---
I was 12, and that was my first character
---
Where's the bear?
---
&gt; mine?
---
And they call it a mine... a mine!
---
First char was a dwarf hunter.
---
The only reason I picked hunter, or even found out about WoW in the first place, was because of a friend who told me how cool dwarf hunters were. Told me they could tame bears, use guns and even feign death. That hunter was my main for a majority of the time, until late wotlk, when I ended up quitting the game. 
---
I think it's cute you think that anything approaching a  decent guild is going to raid with 40 people with content this nerfed in tier 1 and 2. Why would they? So they can gear slower? 
---
We will probably raid with a core of MAYBE 20 people in split runs and sell carries for a few spots for useless tier gear. Example. Mage pressing frostbolt. The tier gear is useless and we will reserve everything else.
---
The two groups will rejoin in AQ. 
---
A paladin, his name is vikings
---
Why does being "better" (better geared) make the game more fun? 
---
I was once one of the best geared rogues on my server - I thought my gear looked cool but I never felt "better" than anyone becasue my enjoyment cam from killing the bosses, not the pixels they dropped - gear was a way of progressing, not the goal, the goal was to kill the boss at the end.
---
I was also the first tank on my server capable of tanking sartherion 3 drakes - was it the gear on my toon that made me feel good or killing the boss? Did i care when others killed it after us, or when blizzard nerfed it? No, because the fun was doing it, not the reward for doing it - I cant understand where you are coming from at all - why comparing yourself to anyone else means anything.
---
ooh reminds me of what I had still in the bank... until I lost my original account.
---
I was leveling a character in late WotLK, when there was already Dungeon Finder.
---
I remember, there was all that group loot in dungeons, and normally you would click pass on an item you didn't need.
---
But, there was an item called [Greed], so well, if the item'S name tells me what to do, I clicked Greed. And, of course, won it by roll of 100, thus getting the [Greedy] achievement.
---
we used to make macros to charge and cancel auto attack in order to interrupt out of combat
---
Funny, saw the same article and have the same reaction when seeing the "News"
---
Clickbiated hard.
---
yes, the worst guilds. Because it was more of a hassle "hell I can't hear anything" and "hell, as soon as I connect to ventrilo, my game DC'es", and "hell, everyone's voice is so disorted, as if robot speaking, can'T comprehend"
---
When I was playing on pserver, I saw PUG annoucements on chat where the PUG leader said to meet him in a city for gear inspect. It's usually done quick as bis gear is easily identified.
---
The keyboard turning is real, looks like he's playing with a controller. 
---
But considering the limitations, why would you bother when its just as easy to inspect someone and almost just as accurate, especially when its not that important in a 40-man raid? Especially as the communities will be pretty small and the chance of having seen the person before is so high?
---
I think that's the bear
---
Killing the boss is the reward. You're saying Naxx needs an easy mode so everyone can feel they "killed the boss". We're saying the boss only needs one difficulty and whoever kills it gets to feel they killed it. You're the only one who's mentioned items. 
---
NO CHANGES
---
It has been years since I've heard anyone say anything positive about retail. Even Blizzard themselves has gone on record saying they've really fucked it up.
---
Gear Score seems like it would be really tricky in Vanilla, as it would have to be based off of a tier list of good items for any sort of usefulness. Not only is that time consuming to put together at first, but also the item levels don't really account for the different builds and talents you can have for every character.
---
If you use some sort of gear score addon to determine usefulness in instances when Classic comes out, you are going to look like an idiot.
---
I'm already leveling one.  Have to go into ZG to get the other.
---
Not in all zones. Wetlands for instance should keep the fog, because it is a part of the aesthetic. They are some other zones like that.
---
same with "casuals" it and every word after it will have a nasally sound in my head
---
still waiting. When it's cold enough, sometimes one comes over the seas, and instantly gets shot down. It's rare, like happens once every few years, and I want to picture it before it's shot down. So... Mankrik's wife.
---
The in game community and guilds will create fun things to do.
---
I'm sure you'll see costume contests, races, duel tournaments, stv arena battles, hide and seek or sardines, maybe even some more weddings, and all sorts of other shenanigans led by the community.
---
I'm not really sure what you mean though.
---
Dwarven Hunter in the closed beta - got to lvl 7 or so :D 
---
first character on release was female gnome warrior named Loan in a hardcore guild - good times. 
---
The only way this really happens is if people create some kind of BIS tracker. Since there have been enough charts about what is BIS and what isnt it would be easy to see that this person has X items and missing Y items to be the best they can be for a raid.
---
Still Classic isnt a game where you need everyone to be at the tippy top. Unless youre trying for server firsts/speed runs most guilds will get by just fine even without BIS. The hard part of Classic is still going to be carrying people though the mechanics something that never changes really.
---
To hell with that. Were you one of the bastards who would never move his arse to the dungeon, patiently waiting for others to summon them ?
---
The standard should be that everybody travels to the dungeon, Warlock summoning being the exception, period.
---
3 times
---
When he spoke about Alts it really hit me. I haven't touched any of my 120s in months. I've just been leveling Alts left and right, finally trying out classes I've been avoiding, and questing through zones I've never been to. Really makes me excited for Classic when leveling one toon will be all I can manage.
---
Fuck rogues. 
---
&gt; when your wow gameplay time reads you've spent 54 out a 56 game play days in the Barrens telling Chuck Norris jokes
---
basically before they introduced afk dc
---
I think its ignorant how you think people wont. Even if you're doing split 20s that will rejoin to 40 when AQ comes out doesnt change anything, 20+20 is still 40 the last time i checked. And thats besides the point the question was regarding fury warrior raid spot.
---
This stands especially in vanilla where the majority of the beat gear is from raids, meaning they're the most relevant content so more people will do it.
---
Oposite to retail where raiding guilds are just continuously dying because they simply arent that relevant anymore, so if every class can find their spot there you can be sure fury warriors will in classic
---
Human Rogue, only lasted until the mid teens then I switched to mage and mained that for something like 7 years.
---
Absolute first probably a dwarf hunter over at my friends house, I only played him for couple of minutes though.  
---
Then some time later I made a char on some awful private server - Troll hunter. The server was so broken I ran out of arrows and did not have enough money to buy any. So I just quit out of frustration.
---
It was a tauren druid on my friend's account. I got to maybe 25 before I got my own account. I didn't create another druid until Wrath, though.
---
I don't think he's wrong though. They are making way too many mounts these days to try and drive player motivation, which is both diminishing the value of mounts and wasting resources. No, the art team isn't going to create all the content themselves, but when you devote all those resources to making mounts it still comes at the expense of something else. Imaging if they had put those resources to something like artifact weapons or tier sets. 
---
Mine was a Tauren Warrior. I am from Wisconsin so the idea of a cow person titillated me. I made him black and white like a moo cow of course!
---
Yes I agree 
---
You may be soing it again! The only alternative to taking a stand is to get bogged down in self-contradiction. It’s a no-win situation friend. 
---
If you truly believe that the scarcity of a food increases its flavour i've got a sandwich made of my own shit to post you, one of a kind so it should be delicious!
---
Objectively enjoying something despite of its exclusivity (not because of) isn't virtue signaling, its being a normal fucking human being. You're an idiot if you think that the price of something should affect your enjoyment of it - good things and experiences are good because they are good, not because they are expensive or exclusive.
---
Crossing my fingers!
---
I play for fun, I'm not racing to lvl 60. The loot might not justify it but the journey sure does.
---
When I played horde I did go to VC.
---
Have fun playing the game with such a square minded attitude.
---
Night elf hunter named 'Batoussai', I was a fan of rorouni kenshin.
---
Yes, and I find them to be incredibly more common. Or perhaps it's the fact that nobody is killing them because there are so few players.
---
A lot of misinformation in this thread coming from inexperienced players (same as every other thread I guess).
---
As the leader of one of the most tryhard private server guilds out there, I can tell you that good fury warriors are always sought after. Despite what other players have said in this thread, no other classes come close to fury warrior in dps, at any gear level. This disparity is a major problem going into Classic that a number of the top guilds have already recognized, and if Blizzard doesn't do anything about warrior damage (specifically Horde), you'll be seeing a lot of raid groups that stack 10+ fury warriors for every 40-man.  Most top private server guilds are already bringing 10-15 fury wars...   
---
So yea, unless Blizzard does something to bring warrior damage back in-line with other classes, good fury warriors are going to be one of the most sought after of all the classes and roles. 
---
For horde, traveling to both Alterac and Arathi is a real pain in the ass, and likewise traveling to WSG for Alliance is a real pain in the ass.  This results in horde more likely to queue for WSG and Alliance more likely to queue for AB, which causes fewer BGs overall.
---
Battlemasters solves that problem to an extent.
---
A better solution, though, would be to make trade a global channel.  The reason a lot of players sit in cities all day long is because they want to run a dungeon and unfortunately many players use trade instead of LFG (which is global).  If you could stay connected to what's going on in chat while sitting at a BG portal people would be more willing to make the trek out to somewhere.
---
You need to WALK to vendors? BLiZzZ should make all vendorz accessible via MENU interface!!!
---
As they said VT but also get shadow reach and healing focus, invaluable for pvp. Meditation is not that good, so limit yourself to 11 disc. 
---
Is this good for streamers? Cool, that means i would vote against that crap.
---
Night Elf Hunter with my first name. Decided after reading the manual on the way back from the shop.
---
Why would there be? It's 2 different development teams. And they haven't said a word about the issue
---
Hillsbrad has quite a bit of quests lol
---
Night elf warrior. 
---
That video is so accurate. Although from what I remember is Overheals were generally bad in vanilla and TBC. I remember it being acceptable in Wrath though.
---
Since when humans can be hunters?
---
Ah, so you cant argue my points so you switch to discounting them for some immaterial reason - don't forget you started this immature string of reply and responses not me. 
---
Im sorry the only enjoyment you get out of the game is feeling better than everyone, its a shame, because the truth is you'll only ever be slightly less shit than the majority. 
---
Oh wow that is pretty cool. 
---
Human Warrior in the open Beta. I wanted a Night Elf Druid for release, so I opted to play in the Human areas in the Beta so as to reduce spoiling.
---
Well I do hope they go on pve realms, tho they have so many people following them around they could be protected on pvp realms too by them. 
---
I just hate the thought so much that I'll have to wait and see which streamer goes on which server so I can avoid them.
---
Itczh wiel relesien inne Julysches 2019.
---
Do you main dwarf hunter by any chance?
---
Night elf priest named Lindre.  Still my main to do this day although its human now because too strong for PvP.  
---
Might go dwarf for classic though for fear ward 
---
" Strange, cause I cleared cleared AQ40 and started naxx in vanilla - Classic was very much for me and my hundreds of house played as GM and raidleader thoughought classic kinda proves it - but i've never taken value from knowing others cant see the same thing. "  
---
Look, guys, if i act and talk like i played in vanilla, even though it don't bring ANY evidence, you will belive me right?  
---
Go back to legion where you started this shit show, there are some private servers out there still for that kind of sad shit like you
---
Yes. Having shards is easy, doing your curse is easy. A warlock isn’t going to get nutty until they have BWL+ geared. Even then they get out DPS’d by mages, furies and rogues basically the entire way. Hardly anyone actually trades for healthstones and if you play in a semi decent guild, soulstones are a non-issue because people aren’t dying. 
---
&gt;Did you play Vanilla? 
---
Lol
---
I remember the exact same thing.  They probably patched it early in vanilla.
---
I know at some point I was able to solo-heal UBRS 15 man as a druid, which felt really good! I don't think the class is that bad at all. 
---
&gt; "Rogues are OP".  Every single class has a spec that can beat rogues. 
---
But most people aren't playing that spec, and rogues scale with gear (in PvP anyway) at a rate that makes them very OP against weaker-geared players.
---
I've been victimized so many times by ambush rogues with Perdition's.  I haven't started raiding yet and have 2.6k health.  Often, if I'm jumped while healing in AV or something, a rogue can keep me controlled from full to dead.  Good warlocks can also keep me controlled long enough to kill me, but only those two classes, and the skill required for the lock to do that is much higher than the rogue.
---
Undead Warrior... his name was Mooglly. My dad had an undead mage and was playing before me, his character was Googlly (named after Google). We traveled Azeroth together as Mooglly &amp; Googlly. 
---
What's the benefit of being out of combat for an interrupt?
---
Friend who got me into the game played a troll rogue and had me roll rogue too. I chose undead, made it to about level 15 and rerolled Druid. That was my main until the end of TBC. 
---
They do not say anything new. Release is as announced in summer 2019. 
---
" Does seeing eclipse lose its value if 10 million other people see it too? " Not even comparable to what we are talking about but ok. Viewing your answers is like seeing someone take a IQ test just to score lower each time. Keep it up champ
---
Gnome Warlock on releaseday, Hit level 28 rerolled to a warrior and went for 60. I never returned to the warlock. She is 28 to this day.
---
Night elf Hunter. Played nelfs in WC3 online. 
---
My best friend played a human rogue. We were 19.
---
Needles to say we didn't know much how the game worked and the night vanilla launched was crazy. We were talking on the phone trying to describe what we were seeing and doing. 
---
What joined a the normal server, because we thought that have us the option to pve and pvp, lol.
---
He kept getting mail pieces and said he was going to save them for me cause I'd need those. We had no clue how the stats worked except what the world of Warcraft website had told us in the class profiles.
---
We also thought of he sold something to the vendor I could buy it from the vendor when it came to soulbound items. Boy were we wrong. 
---
We were also in a guild and I remember we had a 'mandatory meeting' thing and everyone was in that area where the Darkmoon fair is by goldshire, standing in a big circle and doing duels and thinking it was a waste of time because I wanted to level and become a hero. 
---
There were many times we would take off everything except our cape, belt, gloves, and boots to look like goofy superheroes, or dueling naked when we were bored or waiting on someone to come to an instance.
---
A little after level 40 we joined a "wpvp raid" and had a big stand off in XR, but everyone was too afraid of flagging... I found myself trying to trick horde into flagging with the duel commands.
---
We got to level 46 before rerolling to horde on a pvp server. 
---
At one point we came back to dabble with paladins, but our horde mains were too important.
---
Rogues have a lot of utility during c'thun, their ability to completely stunlock tentacles is a raid saver.
---
The progression model is just dogshit.  Progress through raid. Do harder version of same raid.  Do harder version of still the same raid. Wait for next patch.  Repeat for another 4 months.  
---
Remember when you would progress from through a raid tier and *actually advance to another raid?*
---
You should invait u/snapunhappy to the conversation. He has great insight that will "prove" you wrong. He did after all do all of AQ 40 AND was a GM for a guild he don't even say the name to, or bring any evidence to that he did
---
I used to in late TBC
---
now, back to the old good days. Night elf druid, with this appearance:
---

---
but gray hair - aging

and alt - Human warlock, with this appearance:

---
(original screenshots)
---
A troll priest named Sheetz which I leveled to about 56 before it hit me... this wasn’t my class.
---
Next leveled an NE rogue on one of the many new servers that kept popping up and stumbled into a raiding guild and made some lifelong friends.
---
Why are you so angry about his comment? He's right, it was pain in the ass. Like don't you realize you're on the WoW Classic sub, right? Most people are against LFR and things like that. With that being said QoL things like battlemasters are more than fine.
---
and "pros" like [snapunhappy](https://www.reddit.com/user/snapunhappy). He is infact so mature and all knowing that anyone who downvotes his shit posting is only mad because he is right Top KeK
---
It's a shame they won't let you raid as one. Tanking on a druid is amazingly fun!
---
I respect your opinion and am glad you enjoy the game! :)
---
People don’t like the retail game because it’s strayed too far from what initially attracted people to the game. The genre and the gaming industry in general has seemingly sacrificed the longevity for quick little nibbles of the ‘carrot on a stick’ to lead you along to keep subbing. It focuses heavily on the individual player and many start to feel isolated in the world and the world starts to feel small and lifeless. It really sucks to watch the meaning get dragged out of existence. 
---
It’s as if the hardest raid boss in wow history is the new development philosophy itself.
---
The only chance of defeating it for many of us in this here sub is to return to classic to remember why we fell in love with this game in the first place. 
---
Please try r/wowservers when looking for players to okay private servers with (Rule #1).
---
Found memories of chain pulling this instance because the damn mobs always run away to the group that's less than 15 yards away
---
That's because nobody developed such an addon for private servers. It's probably a combination of not wanting to and not being able to. They have all the information, they just have to create the addon to go along with it.
---
When the professional and capable addon developers from retail get their hands on Classic and the information provided by private server players a gear evaluation addon won't be far away sadly.
---
Night elf druid, made it to 53 i think? before i gave up...
---
Then i made gnome mage named Legbite :)
---
I get so anxious playing subnautica.  I haven't played it more than 3hrs because diving in caves at 1440p just freaks me out.  Beautiful game though....wish I was more brave.
---
That happened to me yesterday. I was so pissed off.
---
I cleared an entire cave of level 18 enemies while level 13.
---
Jack ass walks in as I kill the last one and takes the chest.
---
"Sucks to suck"
---
No, what sucks is that I corpse camped his ass when he went into duskwood for two hours.
---
The problem is it's not a long time buff in PvP, unless you're some kind of PvP god who stays alive for 30 minutes in PvP. Not to mention getting dispelled (which is the first thing I do when I see another priest). There's obviously a reason why it costs so much mana and that's because you're paying for 30 minutes of it.
---
Also, PWF talent is not mandatory for everyone... Martyrdom for 2 points in that tier is mandatory, and for the other 3 I take PWS every single time. The PWF talent increases the health given by 160 (not 210 as you guessed), while PWS talent increases your shield by 140. Except one of those you use multiple times each single battle and the other only makes a difference each time you are at full health (which is once at the start of each battle, and maybe more if you're in a big fight where you're getting topped off by another friendly healer). I still come around to put a point in PWF because the next tier only has 4 points, but that puts my personal PWF at 62 stam.
---
Anyway, 1700 mana is still not worth it in most BG cases because starting with that much less mana is a lot worse than starting with 600 less hp. Do the math any way you want, your mana will make up that difference in many ways whether it's using it on heals, killing opponent faster, or utility spells. A priest without mana is going to get their hp melted down no matter how much they have of it - case in point fight any hunter who knows to use Viper Sting.
---
Like I said though if Inner Focus cooldown is up, by all means buff Fort. But if I res and need to run after the flag carrier I'm not buffing myself just to run into battle and die again or not be able to kill someone because I didn't have mana.
---
Be a prot warrior first.  Prove you're a competent tank.
---
Here's the thing: a guild does not raid if they lack a geared MT or OT.  If my guild is looking to recruit 1 fury warrior, I am going to pick the guy whose resume includes pre-raid BIS prot gear and acceptable fury gear.  I would always pick the prot warrior who will be relegated to play fury during raids with gear not quite as good as the fury warrior who "doesn't know how to tank lol."  The competent tank proves he has situational awareness and understands fights and mechanics.  The "I dont tank lol" fury warrior spends his weekends dying a lot in BGs and begging for pocket healers.
---
Because I will need to feed warrior tier to someone when it goes unneeded, I want to feed it to someone who will know how to use it.  I need a second string tank bench who I can call in when the MT/OT doesn't show up, or when either one of them is bored of tanking for months and wants to play DPS for a while.  Or when we're short on brez and I tell you to pop on your prot gear and DPS in it in case one of the tanks dies.
---
Then off to Winterspring for the E'ko farm. Vanilla just has endless stuff you can do to prepare for raids.
---
when you have to grind the entire week just for flasks and consumables
---
Shouldnt people with the worst gear be priority for upgrades if the goal is to improve raid dps?
---
I made a male human mage. He looked similar to the trailer one.  In W3C archmages and humans were my favorite units, so I've rolled it. I remember hating the deadmines quest reward staff, which was a wooden pole, compared to a more magical crystall staff looking loot I could never get.
---
Problem is you can't just repeat instant rewards and always expect the same reaction.
---
He might have some instant pleasure right now, but that's a one-shot. 
---
Imagine that you hate the meal you were served at McDonalds. It smells lime the sewer and is probably rotten. You ask the cashier to make up for your money and give you a better burger but instead he gives you one of those toys from happy meals and he CHARGES you for it.
---
Isnt reduced threat for the first 5 mknutes of the fight enough?
---
Dwarf Rogue in late 2005. 
---
I liked (like) sneaky characters.
---
So... Changes?
---
My brother started playing world of warcraft when i just started in 2nd grade (i was 7, he was 9). 
---
He had a few alliance chars. One of my friends were over and me and him played on my brothers account and lvl'ed. (My name is Lucas his was Frederik so we called it Lufr)
---
A few months later me &amp; my dad started playing too, my first char on my own acc was called (Luel) -My brothers name &amp; mine.
---
These chars ended up being our main ones aswell until i quit wow in   Lich. My brother and me lvl'ed the same speed all the way up together, while our dad got quite a bit ahead of us and boosted us/helped us.
---
Gear score in Classic means exactly nothing. Hence, even if some retarded dude makes a gear score addon, nobody will use it...because there is absolutely no point to use it.
---
that is very much every comment he has made in the entier thread. Love his lack of  self awareness in this all, i hope he is a actual kid and not a adult with this retarded mentality "Haha fucking crying downvotes because people know i'm right"
---
If I looked like this the roleplaying would be awesome. 
---
The irony there is that the reason why WoW was so successful was that it was much much more casual and accessible than it's predecessors. 
---
Let's be honest. No one used swords in proffessional armies such as the Ottomans. They used pikes.
---
God I'm a saint at parties.
---
What "resources"? People who do art (a.k.a. things like mounts, pets) don´t waste any resources creating that. There isn´t magical box labeled "resources" and every time someone adds something to the game, they take one resource out of this finite box of resources.
---
The only way to do what you are suggesting is to fire some people from art team and hire more developers instead of them. But here´s the thing: You have absolutely no idea how much time it takes to make something or how pressed art team itself may be. So taking away from them might end up in decrease of art quality and, guess what, even more complaints and shitshow on the forums and Reddit.
---
You're a moron if you think you'd enjoy your Porsche anywhere as much if EVERYONE had one. Then it's baseline. It's the norm. It's nothing special. You'd enjoy it now because it is special. That's how exclusivity works, and has worked, for the entirety of human history.
---
You can claim you're above everyone else, but you're not. That's why it's virtue signaling. Because it's bullshit and you know it. 
---
Human priest. Mained up until I stopped most recently in 7.3.
---
You can say whore it’s ok I won’t tell anyone 
---
I think the difficulty level argument is a good one, but for a long-term game like an MMORPG, I personally find the content more interesting to try and beat if I haven’t already completed it multiple times before on lower difficulties. It also makes the game feel much bigger when you know there is still content you haven’t reached, and this provides, at least for me, a compelling incentive to beat your current obstacle so you can see what’s waiting for you behind it.
---
Another argument is that there -are- difficulty levels. It’s just that each difficulty level comes with a new set of content rather than the same content re-used with buffed opposition.
---
The reward feels more valuable when you know you have really earned it by dedication.
---
I think Vanilla had plenty of content to do without needing to do the hardest content. I played the hell out of Vanilla but never set foot in AQ40 or Naxxramas. I think content does seem more exciting when it is more exclusive and requires more dedication and/or skill. Though I agree there are definitely some players who enjoy standing in Orgrimmar/Ironforge flexing their e-peens a little too hard.
---
So you wanted to melee dps so you rolled a melee dps class. Good job.
---
That looks like a red wine bottle with red grapes and a thin banana glued on it.
---
Also, it rests on a table where some wine was spilled.
---
But they stack so you gotta do them both nevertheless.
---
&gt; r/wow reaction to this video is like terminally ill organism's reaction to the cure
---
Very accurate description.  But people never want to admit that they are part of the problem.
---
Feral druid, Enh shaman and Ret pal are supposedly melee DPS classes, just like Warrior or Rogue. Only very poorly balanced back in 1.12.
---
It's cool.
---
I've posted previously that I won't play / will quit if they offer level boosts, items, gold, etc for real cash, BUT I would buy a collectors edition mini-pet, since it's cosmetic and doesn't affect game-play (unlike the former).
---
I would add better AI for packs of mobs. In Rift mobs actually moved around zones and could launch attacks. That made the game feel alive.
---
On that note...a human warlock named Midivh.  Yes, I thought I was being clever.  No, in retrospect, I really wasn't.  Also quickly realized my mistake and went forsaken for life.
---
Agreed, but the "Best in Slot" talk is not much different.
---
A female human mage.  She was my main for vanilla, TBC, and part of Wrath until my guild needed healers for raiding. 
---
The *instant* I spawned in the Northshire starting zone, another player knelt down in front of her and pretend to eat her pussy. 
---
Rule 1?
---
Easier than getting in as an arms warrior.
---
Why were people telling me rogue is easier for a noob and is more straight forward compared to a mage? This swing timer thing just confused me, ive never heard of it?
---
I was thinking of running there, but I compared the routes in my head, and as alliance I don't think I stand a chance at getting there before the orcs and trolls :P
---
Make them the same for both games with the offical classic being based on the new framework The WTF might be able to just transfer over or be server side saved. best to get used to them now.
---
I completely agreed with your post until your came to the AQ opening part, the thing is we don't want sharding outside of starting zones at all, atleast in my opnion. I get it from the starting perspective when everyone is in these few zones + a lot of people will leave from retail a few weeks after launch. 
---
But it would be REALLY BAD if they do it at AQ opening, their can't be 2x AQ opening on 1 server, destoys the whole thing about it being rare, same thing with sharding around world bosses, u are supposed to fight for these things.
---
Blizzard already said this too, they have no intent in doing this and it would be a huge problem that would destory the game what u are saying. At that point why not just create more servers? If u want to create multiple servers on a realm via sharding anyway.
---
Mine was a night elf druid named Kazembo. I was having fun, until I reached darkshore and couldn't even 1on1 a mob at my level. 
---
That was the moment I started a warrior, my main for all of classic, bc, wotlk, cata, mop and legion.
---
"... is no longer an RPG, it is a ... collection game" 
---
Wow, hit the nail on the head there. 
---
# GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
I don’t necessarily think the travel time was bad, but if it’s a dungeon you can just go in when you get there. For a BG you could wait for ages after travelling there because your server had twice as many Alliance as Horde players, there was a limited amount of BGs going and you could not really go and do much else because you did not know when the BG would pop.
---
I'm assuming you're talking about this part?
---
&gt;Auf der offiziellen Webseite hat sich der US-Entwickler bereits konkret zu den Classic-Servern geäußert. Demnach befinden sich diese zum **Start im Sommer 2019** auf dem Update-Stand „Patch 1.12 – Trommeln des Krieges“.
---
It roughly translates to:
---
&gt; On the official website the US developer already concretely commented on the Classic-Servers. According to that they will already be on the update state "Patch 1.12 - Drums of War" when they release in summer of 2019.
---
The "Start im Sommer 2019" part just refers to the server release (or **start**) in summer, and not to the beginning of summer.
---
Orc Warlock, which was the only character I leveled to 60 in vanilla. 
---
Tauren Shaman  which I abandoned at level 6 after dying to the gnolls over and over and my gear turned red and i had no money to repair because I didn't pick up the "useless" grey items from mobs
---
This is a hard one. If you are loot council you have to consider that often the newest person is also the lowest dps but they are also new and unproven. If you give them gear over your long time member then you risk your relationship with a long time reliable member. If you give gear to the new guy they may also leave because you don't know their loyalty yet. But they may also leave because they get no gear. Bit of a trick. DKP solves alot of that since your old member may be saving for 1 item and wont spend it and lets new people get all the gear they want without risking your old player not getting what they want.
---
Then they turn around and open trade.  A single tear flows from  your eye as you regain faith in humanity.  The trade window is then populated with a single Darnassian Bleu.
---
Now that I think about it, if just skip shadow focus and mind flay if I am already ditching silence. If I wanted decent pve / PVP as a troll priest, I'd probably go something like this :   
---
   
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxrMsAboZbLtccZVM 
---
Lemme know your thoughts
---
whats wrong with using your DKP to give something to your guildmate? less things for you then
---
How do mages compare against warlocks? 
---
Because that's what creates a world. Diversity and different strokes. Make LFR not drop loot if people just need something easy to experience content. Constantly being fed gear that we replace frequently cheapens it. It's planned obsolescence so that we keep going. They don't need to artificially create drive if it's inherently worthwhile.
---
The game has no prestige, I can get cool gear by right clicking. The rewards isn't that it's rare its that you earned it.
---
I just got tusks of mannoroth after my first try. I get compliments on my shoulders now, but I feel incredibly guilty because I put in little to no effort while others have spent hours trying. I've played since 2004 and have enjoyed warcraft lore since warcraft 2. Rlthess shoulders are a big deal to me. But I don't feel proud at all for having them. But I'm part of the rare few with the item.
---
Seeing that others don't have it doesn't make someone feel good because others are going without, it makes them proud for enduring and succeeding, creating drive.
---
I understand your opinions and take them into consideration but I think your tact is a bit too trolly to gain traction. 
---
Tauren druid. I ran WC endlessly to get the stinging viper mace.....
---
Who needs forms when you can melee with a blue mace from WC must have looked retarted lmfao
---
Your advocating for giving that casual guy a fast track to get similar gear.  Why does that guy deserve an easy track to get epic gear in a lower difficulty (even if it's 80% strength to hard mode).  What made vanilla raiding special was you couldn't just log on a couple hours a week and have full purps.  You could go through an entire raid night of wipes and emotions only to have one piece that was useful drop to you and a mage got it instead of your lock.  But you kept coming back because now you have more DKP and I want that fucking mageblade
---
Bother with what?
---
Some nolife player will do the work, someone will host the service and everyone can just quickly look it up. Inspection requires you to be in range of the player and for both to be online, and most people don't exactly know what's good on other classes.
---
But it would be fun to do, together with a string of other allies. The alternative is standing in line for quest mobs anyway. So getting exploration xp, grabbing some flight paths and taking some screenshots of the road to STV is fun ;-)
---
Running behind other lvl 2 or 3 allies and gleefully watching them draw agro from tigers meaning you don't and then noticing YOU have become the front runner and getting 1 or 2 shot by the stealthed panthers... good times :D
---
Oh if I wasn't clear. I do NOT want the AQ event to be sharded, I just have a fear blizzard will do it for the same reasons they state for the release.
---
I'm not against that at all. I'm just arguing how easy it would be to implement gear score and how efficient it could be. I don't want it myself.
---
As someone who only raided MC and ZG in Vanilla (I started late vanilla) I really loved the feeling that there are much more "dangerous" raids I haven't seen yet. It makes the world feel bigger and more mysterious. When I saw someone with awesome gear I though to myself I wanna get that too and see the bosses he has seen. It motivated me to start raiding more seriously in BC to experience the content. Working for something and having it pay off is a good feeling. 
---
I quit at the end of Cata and one big reason was LFR. Beating tough raid bosses of just doesn't feel exciting or rewarding (for me personally) if you can faceroll them in LFR. Of course you could always say "just do it on hard mode" but for me reaching a tough boss is an awesome experience in itself and a big reason for raiding. Being able to see a big important boss like Deathwing on easy mode just spoils the real deal for me.
---
Perhaps you are wired differently and you enjoy multiple difficulty settings and that is fine too. Because we are getting Classic there will be soon be a version for types of people which is awesome.
---
Guess I WONT be playing classic after all... ffs
---
Human warrior. But had to delete because my older brother already had one. So I went for a Night Elf druid, when they told me he could shapeshift into animals!
---
Okay thanks for clarifying mate.

that. Directly and seriously.

did you just downvote me without even reading the title?
---
A male orc warrior, because it was the first on the screen when i clicked 'create new character' and I was so fascinated that I didn't get there were other options haha
---
Hunters are most def easy mode when it comes to leveling and pvp (if you know how to actually play the class). I've leveled 2 rogues and 3 warriors to 60 across a few different private servers, I recently made a hunter and it blew my mind how easy it was to quest. Most elite quests are easily soloable as a hunter, not so much for any other class than a warlock
---
One could also try to find a fledgling guild prior to launch with DPS spots open. This wat you can essentially “reserve” a Warrior raid spot before the masses join the competition.

My dad and I were waiting in menethil harbor for the boat to theramore. As the boat finally pulled up, we saw that it was filled to the brim - with pirates - horde pirates that had all used savory deviate delight.  They jumped out of the boat, killed us, and ransacked theramore. 
---
Private server spergs aren’t gonna ruin Classic WoW. People who play Human Rogues/Warriors will be in one guild, and the people who play Night Elf Rogues/Warriors will be in a retarded guild. Won’t be a problem. 
---
This was the main reason I bought gold back in vanilla.  I was an MT, and this saved me so much farming time - flasks, repairs, consumables, etc.
---
Except that’s 100% wrong. Not every suggestion here is some elitist circle jerk. Wotf matters if you want to dabble in pvp at any level. There’s a reason less people roll locks on Alliance and it’s not a meme. Stop giving people bad advice. 
---
I was so outraged the splash damage cancelled Netflix.
---
Same reason people hate groupfinder and prefer physically going to a dungeon
---
Yea, they've got original 1.12 clients and server code, but concluded that the quickest route to market is to back-port modern clients and servers rather than modernise the original client. It's good to hear that they've got originals for reference though.
---
Not enough there for me to figure it out, especially since I'm pretty confident he's wearing a tabard.
---
&lt;shakes violently&gt;
---
Maybe show a photo of the chest-piece....? 
---
but all that blood and tears made your tier set worth it.
---
WF isn’t really that great unless you have the weapon for it (non normalized proccs). 
---
This is less "bad advice given" and more the opinions I see from those who want to absolutely min max their characters, or people who are simply playing the percentages and aren't trying to consider anything beyond that (like individual player skill). 
---
There's no doubt that dwarf priest is in fact the "optimal" alliance choice for a priest who absolutely wants to *totally maximize* their chances of getting an invite to a hardcore, min/max raiding guild. 
---
Rogues can indeed seem OP for less-than-skilled players (who happen to constitute the majority of the playerbase). Rogues have the advantage of picking their fights, suprising their opponent, and people tend to panic and not respond correctly when they get jumped from stealth. If an average rogue player jumps and average [insert class] in the open world, the odds are likely on the rogue. The rogue can wait in stealth until he has all his cooldowns up; the victim usually doesn't have that option. Rogues tend to pick unfair fights where they know they have an advantage. 
---
Hunters are an easier leveling class. A high ceiling and a low floor are not mutually exclusive. 
---
Playing well is more important than rolling the "right" class or race, but if you're talking about a very large population of players, most probably aren't going to know how to play optimally. Rogues and WotF can be a pain for players less skilled than OP. A new player will probably having an easier time leveling with a pet class. Etc. 
---
Very good explanation of a very good period of pc gaming. *sigh*
---
&gt; Not every suggestion here is some elitist circle jerk.
---
Proceeds to elitist circle jerk.
---
Riiight.
---
Why do people complain so much about the game they play? I don't get how these players comes up with, what seems like extensive analyses, what in actuality is just their own uneducated opinion. They are angry about where the game is going, because in their opinion its going the wrong way. All wow players are children? Please stop being so emotional, when you deliver an analyses. You are cursing and shouting. This is not FUCKING productive. 
---
It's one of the best druid pvp specs when geared. It has never been about raiding. You're mind is limited by memes.
---
Human Paladin in the open beta. I think I made it to the early 20s, don't remember anything more than that. I wanted to try out the Alliance because I would go to play an Orc rogue in the release version.
---
I’m a little confused by this statement, how did he talk to you if you then proceeded to corpse camp him..? What’s special about Duskwood in this scenario? Also... level 13 clearing 18’s in classic... sorry man, lot of questions here.
---
don't have it
---
aah guild tabard, could be
---
there was some apocalypse-themed movie, when someone was waiting for a train, and the train came... but all covered in fire.
---
maybe you now which movie was that?
---
Sorry, for clarification I am a hunter, so I was able to kill the level 18's one at a time without risking death.
---
Duskwood because the person who took my chest most likely wanted to avoid the deaths to horde in RedRidge.
---
Corpse camping because I logged onto my 26 horde rogue to kill him in Duskwood.
---
Can someone explain why warriors have a hard time getting a raid spot? 
---
update: here!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLf6pp5Tvk8
---
Probably a pserver and switched toons. You can have both factions on a realm. 
---
The 13 killing 18s is a feat through.
---
Or maybe it's retail and that's how easy it is and he had warmode on.
---
idk wat ur talking about. im getting thunderfury 3-4 months after launch
---
You could rather dedicate more into healing and just take improved wrath and nature's grasp. 11 in feral is typically mandatory for pvp so you can use bear charge, stun and tank out situations. People use bear instead of moonkin because moonkin is too limiting despite it supposedly being the tank option for balance. You could raid heal and pvp heal with some finishing moves using wrath spam. 
---
Hotw hybrid can heal as well but with only 21 points you will need lots of healing gear to make up for it and stack Int to scale from Hotw. You can off tank with that build too.
---
TL:DR: nothing we did not know, currently they are working on the feedback they got from the demo and they have a reference 1.12 build to veryfy stuff (example given was that warrior's charge does not get you into combat, it simply activates your weapon animation and you strike when you reach the mob)
---
to me it rather sounds like we are getting a (public?) beta at the start of summer, but that is up to interpretation.
---
Keep in mind that back in Wrath, 10 out of the 12 million players absolutely understood the simple logic of COMMITMENT=REWARD.
---
Since than, those 10 million people left, and the 2 million playing BfA are the ones who thinks that REWARD=LOOT PINATA.
---
So, no wonder that retail WoW players are reacting negatively to this video. They simply just don't get it.
---
Snowflakes.
---
Why not just watch a youtube video of someone doing it? You get the experience minus pressing a few buttons. That's more or less LFR today. 
---
Night Elf Druid, man leveling in Teldrassil was such a dream, it was US closed beta (im from EU) and i think i lvled to like 22 and then i entered Barrens, needless to say i didnt lvl that character anymore, had too much fun killing Horde :D
---
His point is that a video showing somebody beating a rank 14 isn't necessarily a show of cutting edge PvP skill, because being rank 14 doesn't require any skill.
---
And he's right. There are classes that can 2v1 two bad rank 14s with blue gear.
---
The ONLY place hybrid builds are limited is in raiding. Dungeon runs are easy mode and any spec combo will work if people know how to gear and play.
---
If you want a really good translation website, try to use [https://www.deepl.com/translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator)  
---
It is way better than google translator!
---
no it means they have a 1.12 client that works similar to a private server, but does not work with the current server structure they use for BfA/Legion (classic is based on the Legion client)
---
QoL changes seem reasonable but they can always have undesirable effects ingame. I'd rather not have battlemasters, no AH in stormwind (or don't have it linked with ironforge one) etc.
---
I mained Warlock on Alliance. Here are my thoughts.
---
**Pros:**
---
* Population is relatively lower (due to WotF obviously) - easier dungeon and raid spots as well as loot
---
* Human Warlocks get Perception and add that to Paranoia from Felhunter which allows you to catch rogues out of stealth fairly easily and throw up a DoT + Deathcoil
---
* Hordies often don't prepare for you as there are few Alliance warlocks
---
* Don't have to worry about Fear Ward
---
**Cons:**
---
* WotF is the big one, especially on rogues. But like a mentioned, Warlock humans in particular have some counter play. You can also use other items (like the stun trinket) to get the 3 seconds of CC you need to do stuff.
---
So with many pros, and one big con that can be overcome. I would say going Warlock on Alliance is a solid choice considering the utility they have.
---
Auf der offiziellen Webseite hat sich der US-Entwickler bereits konkret zu den Classic-Servern geäußert. Demnach  
---
befinden sich diese zum **Start im Sommer 2019** auf dem Update-Stand „Patch 1.12 – Trommeln des Krieges“ 
---
Translates to:
---
On the official website, the US developer has already commented specifically on the Classic servers. According to this, they will be available for the start in the summer of 2019 on the update stand "Patch 1.12 - Drums of war. 
---
So, they are saying the release will be **sometime** in the summer of 2019. They use the word "start" in place of release. 
---
If they stick to their word and use sharding to address the rush in starting zones, for a short period of time, then I see absolutely no issue with it and I understand the benefits.
---
Will they stick to their word? Who knows. They've been pretty adamant that sharding is not something that fits with classic and have openly recognized that the "single world" is one of the key pillars of the game. I don't see why after everything they've said they would wake up one day and think "nah, let's shard the fuck out of it."
---
At this stage there really isn't much point in getting worked up about something that may or may not happen. All signs are pointing to it not happening. If that changes then we'll have something to talk about.
---
It was actually a human warrior on some private server to see if my PC could run it (it couldn't). A couple of months later I got a new PC and started on the real servers with a human mage.
---
Looks like a tabard and a white shirt is involved. Can't tell what chest piece it is just with a few neck pixels.
---
To the morons who downvoted: maybe you just suck at healing and don't want to hear the truth \*shrugs\*
---
If its just the starting areas im fine with it
---
I've switched from druid to shaman to druid again. I won't overthink it as I always have to have a druid so will just roll with it. Easy leveler anyway.
---
Yeah that’s the bit that confused me.  Thanks for clarifying 
---
I despise the feeling of playing a lobby based game in an MMO. This includes both queueing for bg and lfg tool. In an MMO location should matter. Yes, it increases travel time but also makes you feel like you are living in a world. Why would you be able to just join the war effort in the fronts while sitting back in the capital drinking thistle tea?
---
Human warrior which is still my main to this day. I liked the alliance aesthetic and the idea of playing a armored powerhouse. 
---
This would be the only alternative, but playing them is nicer and more involving, even without gear drops or achievement. Allowing spectators would be a suitable alternative to multiple difficulties. A way of being involved/seeing out the story would be entirely adequate 
---
Hunters dominate 1-59 pvp, and are then become more average at 60 when everyone starts gearing up. Mages are powerful throughout all levels and all stages of gear. Mages can also pull off flashy out plays if they're much better than their opponents.
---
I'd say overall mage would be more powerful and more fun if you're pvp focused. 
---
A private server glitch that was hard to fix for years. They have fixed it now however and don't expect it in Classic.
---
When you have to grind the entire week just for flasks and consumables
---
You go to a dungeon because you *have* a group, you went to the BG portals hoping to *get* a group. One of these sucks, you can probably guess which.
---
Alright cool, wasn’t doubting the story was just a little curious haha 
---
Also, off topic... Smite Hades... how many worshipers you got on him? :p
---
1)True.
---
2)I've seen people saying that hunters are a noob friendly class because they can just turn on autoshot and go afk.
---
4)Paladins are good at countering "DoT and run" in group PvP.
---
5)If a guild kicks out an established and geared player in favour of a situationally useful racial, then the leader is probably not very good at decision making.
---
6)Same could be said for ele shamans or even PoM Pyro mages tbh.
---
7)When it comes to PvP, vanilla is not even more unbalanced than TBC.
---
[GW2 didn't have a mega server in the beginning.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/April_2014_Feature_Pack#Megaserver_system)
---
Oh no, you have to kill quilboars to get the chest? Nevermind then. That sounds really hard.
---
The people who BG typically don't care for WPVP so what does it matter?
---
Anyway, I thought vanilla was vanilla and we can just pick and chose which points we want, we get it warts and all, which means battlemasters.
---
Yeah, reskinning is tough work. Why on earth would we want more and more mounts. They don't feel rewarding at all and they are also pointless. I can ride 1 mount at the time and I can choose from hundreds, which I somehow obtained by a lottery roll. I will happily trade in all my mounts for a game with community and rewarding gameplay. I agree that some mounts look very very good. 
---
We’re in the endgame now.
---
Top guilds will seek to control the war effort, and that will mean DELAYING it. Only the players who successfully complete the incredibly long scepter of the shifting sands quest will get the title/mount and they will need time to finish it. So, if they have stockpiles, they will hold off on donating them until that quest is in the bag. My prediction is that top guilds will store up the most difficult/expensive donations and control the market until they can donate it all. Of course, the 5 day travel delay can also work for them as well. 
---
Also, both the alliance and the horde need to work together so, if the server you are on is unbalanced, the war effort will take considerably longer. 
---
Besides all that, some of those donations were massive meaning that even thur largest guild will find it impossible to complete on their own. Where do you even store 40,000 STACKS of linen bandages??
---
I couldn’t find anything about the garden in the post above but I thought this video was cool. It shows the original scarlet monastery when it was a single dungeon 
---
https://youtu.be/Sj3rzrmft-w
---
&gt; some of the strongest or easiest 1 v 1 classes are the weakest in BG's and the weakest or harder classes in 1 v1 are the strongest in group PvP.
---
Which, I think, hearkens again to the glaring issues in retail...*everything is the same*.  If everyone is special, then no one is.  Classes *should* have strengths and weaknesses.  
---
The company is pumping out collectable art at a stellar and consistent rate...but hasnt fixed mechanical issues with the game known for almost a year now. The problem isn't that they are making too many mounts for players to collect. It's that they aren't doing hardly anything else.
---
11 year old me could grind like the wind. 26 year old me has bills to pay abd minimal time to play. I doubt ill be grinding in my off time.
---
Undead warlock (bc the friend who introduced me into WoW played one, too) - I don't remember the name, bc I played it until level 20 and then started playing every other class until I sticked with my hunter.
---
&gt; The 13 killing 18s is a feat though.
---
Being a hunter does lay that to rest, but I’m also one of those people who refuses to orange quests for to maintain a good flow while leveling.
---
Night Elf Druid.  At level 8, I was getting chased by Furbolgs, and fell off Teldrassil, and died halfway down on a branch.  I spent an hour trying to figure out how to get back to my body, then gave up and rerolled.  
---
Depends on you and how good you can play the classes.
---
I would argue in BGs and wpvp many people won't stay in your dead zone. There will be plenty of new players. And you aren't alone usually in bgs and can usually hang back throwing arrows at people and annoying people with your pet and traps. And setting up hunters mark macros will drive a stealth player insane.
---
I would also ask about the factions your going to play? Alliance have escape artist and blessing of freedom. Things that will annoy you further if you are horde.
---
But as an Orc warrior mages made me f'n nuts because I'd never have free action potions ready.
---
What class would you rather play? How much pvp will you do? And what other things will you do? 
---
I think the first time I ever played WoW was late 2005 and I made a night elf (druid?), but never made it out of the starting zone.
---
After that I made the first character whose name I know. He was a Troll Hunter called Swedishfish.  I made it to level 27 or so before I quit.
---
I came back after BC launched and made a Blood Elf Pally that became my main thru cata.
---
NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE AND MORE NOPE. 
---
You wonder why BFA is on life support
---
wow I thought this was the MS2 subreddit for a second.
---
yeah but the way u said it "is it really that bad?" 
---
In my opnion it is, im fine with it for starting zones since retail players join and they should be able to play the game too and not have to wait forever to kill mobs. But for any kind of endgame sharding shouldnt be a thing. Good thing that so far blizzard agrees :)
---
How fun is sex? Fucking awesome right? Is sex any less fun because everyone gets to have it? Is sex with a specific person less fun because someone else got to put in less effort to get them to have sex with that  person than you? Is sex with someone who has sex with lots of people less fun? If you got to have sex with lots of people who it gradually be less fun for every addition person you had sex with?
---
How fun is riding a bike? Is riding a bike less fun because anyone can and because they are so cheap?
---
That's how life works, I really am not lying when I say I enjoy the experience not the exclusivity, and experience does not diminish because if it's commonality. Porsches are not fun to drive because they are special, if I put the exact same speed, cornering, weight distribution in a mini magically then it would be as fun to drive - why would you care what badge is on the outside or how many have the same car? 
---
I hate groupfinder, would be fine with Quartermasters.
---
i somehow mained the first character i made,  male human mage.  regretted it after almost 2 years and wanted to be gnome but then wrath came out and humans got that wicked sick racial.   but eh, quit shortly after haha
---
If you are not going to Silence I wouldn't go any farther in the Shadow tree past Blackout. You could use those points to go higher in Holy or Disc and take Spiritual Guidance or Power Infusion. Otherwise your build is too diluted. 
---
I am so sure it will be delayed
---
I doubt any changes for launch. This doesn't change the fact that the honor system in Classic is complete crap. I firmly believe Classic will not be without changes in order to prolong the product as a stand alone mmorpg. Blizzard knows of server life cycles and won't try and make the game a "Live" changing game but will attempt to lengthen each "FRESH" server cycle. I just feel that it is a matter of time.
---
I'll be honest too. I respect the no change concept but what's trying to be recreated it a style of game, a style that was lost over expansions. You can keep the style but still make changes to nearly broken systems of the time. A shit and highly exploitive honor system didn't make Classic Wow 'classic'. It's just shit we put up with in an unfinished game that was never attempted to be finished (used loosely)  in its original style. 
---
I recently jumped into BFA after holding off for a while. I enjoyed leveling from 110 to 120 even though it was stupidly quick to do so, but after reaching max level I'm completely dumbfounded by the design decisions made. I quickly upgraded my gear to heroic dungeon standard, and subsequently ran out of any options to progress as a solo casual player. I get the impression that higher iLvl gear is just pot-luck rather than deliberate progression; hoping for whatever loot pops out of world quests or warfronts. Raiding feels redundant. I'm a keen PvPer and even that has been messed up; playing solo offers almost zero progression, and from what I can gather of item scaling there's not much point in getting the gear anyway. Thinking back to Durotar and Elwynn Forest brings back really fond memories, and honestly it's pretty damn depressing to look at what WoW is now; an impersonal and lifeless world with seemingly no reason to stick around. I won't be renewing my sub.
---
My friends and I call that NE trek to stormwind the "trail of tears"
---
Hello, I'm a futur classic player from europe and i'm in the same situation. If anyone have advice, it can be cool guys.
---
Is this over in Booty Bae?
---
Take a breath. 
---
No one wants to choose the wrong server. Things have changed and hopefully the realm names will be announced beforehand and there will be polls, and discussions about who is going where. Guilds will recruit and you'll see what kind of people you will probably play with or against.
---
We got you man, we got you.
---
You will, if you want to raid post ZG. 
---
Once you get som gear it will be like the old days, ”now what? Nothing to do, I guess I will grind mats then...”
---
Thanks Soupa!
---
Go your time zone and PvP, no chance it will be ded
---
Also avoid the streamer servers.
---
female human priest! because why would you want to be one of those other weird looking non humans
---
Female troll shaman called Bacun..... yeah im not too sure what happened here. I remember getting to about level 36 and not being able to afford to repair my gear then re-rolling lol
---
If I end up with nothing to do sure I just dont know if I will hit it. I expect to be lagging behind the pack in terms of levelling and gear.
---
Not at all. It is the easiest to level, but that’s about it.
---
Probably the ‘hardest’ rotation for PvE (compared to vanilla standards) and high skill ceiling in PvP with dead zone and such.
---
Great at farming when DM is out, so I guess one could argue that getting gold is easy, but I wouldn’t say it has anything to do with difficulty that you spend an hour less farming per week.
---
I would get rid of Improved SWP, it's not going to help Blackout proc. 
---
Great Success.
---
I came from DAoC as well!  I rolled an orc warrior because I played a mercenary in Camelot and have always liked the melee classes.  Leveled him sword and board / full prot tree and got to about lvl 45 before I burned out on him and had to take a break.  
---
I had come straight from grinding out my second max char in DAoC, which was a true leveling grind - So I got burned out on gaming in general for a while and came back in BC but rerolled to a human mage.  
---
I  am thinking about rerolling him with the same name as a Shaman this time, but the pull of the priest class is very strong.  
---
I'm more concerned about dodging streamers' servers than anything else.
---
Well first of all you need to calm down and wait for the realm names to release. Then keep an eye on this subreddit, classic WoW forums and other large gaming related forums for realms that people will choose. There will always be a few very popular choices no matter what, so picking a realm that won't die out after a few weeks/months won't be hard.
---
Make a money alt
---
I mean it does proc blackout right? Are you saying the points would be better somewhere else? I can understand that. Might as well go for PI if I drop those. I feel like just getting blackout by itself would be super useful for a troll as a semi PVP build, mostly PVE build
---
Night elf male druid. I got to 60 just before TBC hit.
---
This time around I will play a night elf female hunter. Druids are super nostalgic to me and I’ve mained a Druid for all xpacs, but honestly I don’t enjoy them before the TBC changes.
---
You are comparing two completely different things.
---
When you form dungeon groups, you participate in social activity. You form a group, go to the dungeon and do said dungeon. You can meet new people, spend time with friends and so on.
---
On the other hand, doing BG is solo activity. You don´t form a group, you don´t socialize, you go from point A to point B. That´s it. What is even worse is that you actually don´t do anything at point B. You just click on a guy and queue. And then you wait. And wait. And wait, until you can enter the BG.
---
That´s not MMO experience, that´s game being tedious for the sake of being tedious.
---
BFA isn't on life support because of raid difficulties - it's on life support because of dogshit treadmill features like artifact power and world quests, the destruction of community by allowing LFG and LFR to be cross realm, the over simplified talents and speccs and the willingness of the device team to release broken patches they they never get around to fixing. Raids are the only thing it feels like blizzard can kind of get right.
---
Give me back server integrity, talents with choice, speccs with more than 2 buttons, decision that meant something. Allow the elite raiders to have considerably better gear, keep lfr/nm/HC/mythic on completely separate trajectories so that running some isn't an introduction to the next and that's fine with me. Just give me difficultly levels to see the completion of the story I spend hours playing and months following. 
---
Ahh yeah, I meant if the population was increased to for it.  
---
Like if vanilla could only handle 500 players in a zone, but the new server could handle 1000, but sharded to 500 would we really notice. That kind of thought process.
---
are you talking about enchants in korean MMOs? XÐ
---
I wasn't suggesting it's on life support solely because of raid difficulties, but it's a big contributing factor.
---
As far as I'm concerned, there should only be one raid difficulty. I never heard people back in BC complaining about how they can't access SWP or BT. It was understood that you either put the time in and did the content, or you didn't. Blizzard created the entitlement mentality we see today.
---
Worst case scenario, you learn after a couple weeks to try a new server and go there.  Vanilla's not like live where if you miss a week, everyone else is already level 120 and in full pre-raid BIS gear and is 3 artifact levels (or whatever it is now) ahead of you.
---
I want there to be enough servers I can avoid the streamers.
---
If only I didn't have wife/kids.  May be a cool idea for streamers that plan to nolife the launch.
---
Night Elf Rogue for some reason. I played it for about 5 minutes just jumping around having no clue at all and just ignoring the tutorial messages. 
---
My second character was an Undead Warlock and that's the character I took the game seriously with, and I never looked back!
---
&gt;You really can pick a role that fits you.
---
But I wanna be a paladin tank? Nope go to TBC. Lol
---
Where others fail, we succeed.
---
Every person that queues for something and then leaves the city leaves it to do content in the world.
---
Tell me, what is better for MMORPG? People being in the world doing stuff or people jumping around one city, waiting until their queue pops?
---
Play on PVP servers and avoid whatever PvP servers Classicast plays on since they are hosted by people like Asmongold. That pretty much sums it up. 
---
I think lack of servers will be a bigger problem. There are no good MMO's and there are a lot of people who want one to play again spread across lots of crappy MMO's and private servers on multiple games. 
---
Streamers are going to be a huge issue for Classic. That is why I tried to think of ways to keep them and their autistic fans busy. Got attacked for that though. People seem to think ACTIVISION/Blizzard will cater to us instead of influencers and loudmouths on Twitch when all Activision cares about is esports and mobile. I think they are delusional. Time will tell. I hope they are right.
---
My first character was a Forsaken warlock, since I started playing in early TBC and the cinematic for that expansion had a Forsaken warlock casting hellfire nonchalantly and killing a lot of charging murlocs and I though that was the coolest shit.
---
Later I switched to a NE druid and ended up raiding with him as a Healer. I did revisit the warlock and got to 70 with him, but by then I was too invested in the healer role.
---
Human mage in May 2005.  I played him all they way through to the end of WoD, with a faction/race change around WotLK to mix it up a bit.
---
No changes - dead on arrival.
---
That being said, classic doesn’t need to be a shitty streamer bait mmo.

I don't think the majority of the playerbase changed.
---
I think the majority quit because the game changed.
---
Azerite system is being completely changed (and there is popular theory out there that states they have worked on that since Beta after problems with current system became obvious), so they are definitely fixing something. It just so happens that doing mechanical changes is much more difficult than creating HD skin for nightsaber.
---
At that point I would remove points in Imp. SWP. I would def fill up Imp Shield. Put the +1 where you want.
---
Enjoy the cross realm BG's after they cry about having nothing to do on PVE servers with their stupid audience of 30,000 viewers. :( I swear streamers are going to wreck this. I think we should get out in front of it, but we will see. I hope you are right and Activision stops putting streamers and failed esports before an actual good game and the masses. I just don't see that happening with this company.
---
Asmongold already tried to convince his audience that cross realm BG's were a good thing on his stream btw.  He won't be the only one who cares more about "content" than the game.
---
The in game aspects are all really cool, I remember Kripp winning this in wrath when it was first popular (I think). However the streaming aspects are a little extreme, in fact I don't believe twitch allows you to stream while you sleep
---
They are in the processes of (hopefully) fixing some thing...after a year of sub money. Sunk cost fallacy in a game.
---
Alliance warlocks are way better off in PvE tho with Paladins giving them Blessing of Salvation for threat reduction! You can also always use death coil or an engineering grenade or whatever while WotF is up and then re-fear them.
---
Engineering is a gamechanger. Seriously, if you want to PvP, don't even think about not getting it. 
---
A night elf druid was my first character. I saw the opening cinematic where the ne hears a battle, runs of and shape-shift into a panther. In awe I had to have that ability.
---
Only then I discovered I liked casting more then playing a cat with melee abilities. I leveled balance until I entered a cave in duskwood killing along another druid playing feral. He out preformed me so badly I decided to let this character slip.
---
I then proceeded to watch the cinematic again and fell in love with the mage hurling fireballs at a demon. Since then in every rpg I will play a mage. 
---
Maybe I am overrating the usefulness of R1 MindFlay as a blackout + slow effect. It costs 6 points to get there.
---
Jesus wtf
---
Me too I love druids, currently have one on live atm.
---
My favorite is "yeah bfa has some problems but I'm having fun collecting MoP battle pets."
---
Here is why Classic is fun for a long time, despite the fact it seems on the surface like only leveling content and a generic end-game:
---
1. Leveling is fun, it's not just the chore you do to get to end-game
---
2. Leveling takes time (takes significantly more time to get to 60 in Vanilla than to go 1-120 in BFA)
---
3. At level 60, there's so many small goals that you don't have today, and those goals take a lot longer to achieve (i.e. it's not just 'grind LFG until X gear score')
---
Most people who played Vanilla didn't even set foot in Naxx, and had a blast playing the game.  "Stays the same" isn't an issue when people are having fun.  Look at Counter-Strike as an example.
---
&gt; In "Battle for Azeroth" the pet despawned at the end of the spell. Many players reported this as a mistake or at least saw it as a contradiction to the original functioning of the summon, so we checked the problem based on player feedback. While many bug reports entered by players are correct, it turned out that this is not the case here. After a thorough review of our 1.12 reference code, we found that we had correctly replicated the classic behavior and that the demon pet actually disappears at the beginning of the spell. 
---
I remember commenting on the feedback thread here, saying yes it is working correctly in the demo, only to be shot down and told how wrong I was.
---
Aspects of other MMOs being brought to WoW are part of what ruined it.
---
Then maybe you weren´t getting the right mounts. There are some out there (5 million gold one, Hivemind, mounts from Warfront and Island Expedition resources, mounts from WM world areas and Island Expeditions and so on) that aren´t guaranteed drops or reputation rewards.
---
Besides, it´s not like community dislikes mounts. People want them, so Blizzard is making them. And my point still stands: You can´t change artist into class developer. These two teams are completely separate.
---
The presence of easier levels of sports (street hockey with friends vs the Stanley Cup) doesn't map as well as you think to "levels of difficulty" of the topmost tier of "hockey" play. It maps more closely to the entire game.
---
Street hockey is more akin to quests, 5-mans, and easier types of content, not the easiest form of the hardest content. You are playing "hockey" (WoW), you just aren't playing in the "Stanley Cup", which takes hard work and dedication and friends to enter. The Stanley Cup is more akin to the raid itself, not the hardest raid (Mythic vs LFR).
---
At least in Classic you can participate in the "Stanley Cup" if you so choose, you may just get your tail whooped. In real life, you have pretty much no access to the Stanley Cup. The tiers of difficulty are throughout the game natively, and that speaks to the game design people desire from Classic, a focus on the world, journey and community rather than the endgame. 
---
As we have seen in Retail, a focus on the endgame invalidates the majority of the world you are in, and keeping the world persistent and important has been a **major** concern for the Classic community.
---
TL;DR: Hockey != Raids, Hockey == WoW, and there are plenty of tiers of difficulty built into Classic WoW, just don't expect the rewards from the "Stanley Cup" just because you exist in the world. You gotta fight for it.
---
Yea.. you could modify it so that your played just be less than 7 days.  Just remove rules 1-3 on the out of game rules.
---
I'll choose the PvP server with the best name, streamers not an issue because EU.
---
As a lvl 1-3? Yup, it's hard.
---
Thanks for explaining how to perform the tactic properly. Any other insights to the method you could shed light on?
---
The last statement ; I feel like wrath was supposed to be the capstone of the lore. You did it. You defeated the lich king. You are the champion. Then they were like uhhh let’s get a giant dragon to f up Azeroth and give the heroes something to do. 
---
Human mage. Ran out of the abbey at level 3 or so. Died to Defias right outside. Deleted my character.
---
I took some detours afterwards on other classes, but I ended up rerolling an Undead Mage on another server around 1.7~1.8 or so and maining that for the rest of my playtime.
---
1. Rogues and warriors are hardest to get a raid spot with?  Really?  I don't know about Rogues, but Warriors?  The top DPS class and the only optimal end-game tank class?  It's hard to get a raid spot with?  Really?  
---
2. Hunters are easy.  Most of your leveling is send-in-pet, auto-shot, profit.  If that's all you do in a dungeon you've done 70% or more of your potential DPS just by doing that.  You rarely have to drink or eat because all you do is throw in a mend pet every once in a while.  They have a high skill cap to be "elite" but they are the easiest to be serviceable with.
---
I stopped here, because these two points you made are so ridiculous I can't even keep going.
---
Did you not see the part about them working on this for half a year? You can´t just magically pop things out of thin air and unfortunately, Azerite system was a failure. Not "we didn´t work hard enough on this" failure, "this just sucks" failure. And it´s impossible to fix "this just sucks" systems in span of a month. You can either completely rework or remove them. Option two wasn´t possible, so they are doing the first one.
---
Does this mean we should be praising them? Not really, they still screwed up. But does that mean they aren´t doing anything to fix the game? No.
---
Watch yer back
---
It depends a LOT on what your plan is.  
---
Some people say you have to be the guy on all the time, running people through dungeons to get thier BIS pre-raid gear, get attunments done and helping people. While this is true for someone that is alone because you have to make a name for yourself. While leveling the guilds that dont have GM's / Raid leaders as the main tank are going to be looking at the best possible canidates for the job and these are usually the people that get those spots. You have to make the right friends in the right guilds.  
---
I personally don't think a MT needs to run all the lowbees or newly 60 people through attunements. Sure it helps when they are on and can help you with that but thats not their job. Their job is to MT for every raid that your guild does, know the fights, and organizes other tanks. If youre not going to make 90-100% of raids, then dont even try to go as MT. I think that is really the ONLY requirement to be a MT and after gearing yourself up I'd say the most you need to be on is raid times which will probably be 12-15 hours a week + Consumable farming time.  
---
The other route you could take is just start your own guild, but its not for everyone and its a stressful job being a GM dealing with 40+ of other peoples shit =). Sure officers take a lot of that burden off you, but you still get smacked with a majority of the decisions. 
---
Good luck =)
---
Graveyard is the only one I really saw neglected.  It depends on your level which ones you do.
---
What's "pull a Bungie" mean?
---
This is peak performance.  You may not like it, but science has determined that this is the ideal ~~human~~ dwarf figure.
---
Release TBC, use TBC PvP system.
---
I’ve played hunter next to my Druid since TBC - love both.
---
What do you like about vanilla druids? I dislike how you are not really a HoT healer yet, though it is clear they were somewhat meant to. TBC makes HoTs really great. Also, feral becomes way more viable. Resto / Bala hybrids were also super fun due to HoTs.
---
What I do like in vanilla is balance / hybrid specs, but only on a geared character and only for PvP.
---
I think 40+ hours a week is a massive stretch. Especially early on. I think after the initial gearing and raid starts that could be cut down to half of that easily. 12-15 for raids and 5 for consumables. You dont need 20 hours a week for consumables. 
---
I too wish we could play til wrath.
---
Honestly Classic will keep my attention, probably for 3-4 years.  TBC and Wrath would keep me until I'm in the grave.
---
It only applies to alliance if you have sword spec, and horde if you're sword spec or have windfury in your party - or either if you have Ironfoe and/or Hand of Justice trinket.
---
There's not much else to explain. Just use an ability after you auto attack happens to reset the swing timer. 
---
NPC armor needs to be increased to offset the increased player optimization of armor reduction debuffs, and Windfury Totem should be nerfed to offset Horde warriors doing 30% higher dps than Alliance.
---
Holy shit. I didn't even realize I did that. But no. That's a clear Borat reference. I did play the -shit- out of RO tho.
---
There are definitely bad rank 14s, but most people who out that much time into it are really good players who love pvp. They would also have a ton of consumables and a huge gear advantage. Unless these are bought accounts, a blue geared shadow priest isn't winning.
---
Also, shadow priests are good, but they will only win when outnumbered against very bad and unheard players. Hell, on my dwarf hunter I beat undead shadow priests more often than not, because I could just stoneform devouring plague.
---
I appreciate your virtuous stance on raiding availability for all skill levels, but tiers of difficulty makes for a poor end result (which is what current WoW is). Participation trophies just end up making everyone less happy, not more.
---
Another thing, you are doing what a lot of virtue signalers do and trying to say EVERYONE who can clear top end vanilla WoW raiding is a dick and is taking great pleasure in seeing so many not achieve it.
---
Sure there are people who are dicks and do this, just like in every facet of life, but I think most are not. I would say most people who get to that level are just very satisfied and happy they were able to achieve it and don't really think about those that do not. 
---
Sure they may strut around Ironforge and take some pleasure in the jealousy that they pick up on, but hell, they earned it, more power to them.
---
To me, that is the great thing about classic or vanilla WoW, the option to achieve the highest reward is there for everyone, you just have to want it bad enough to do what is necessary to make it happen, but nothing is stopping you.
---
Your bold items are extremely blatant forms of loot ninjaing, which may have worked with LFG across multiple servers (WOTLK +), but won't really work in Vanilla because the people you group with are always on your server. So, if you were in a group where there was this obvious collaboration, it will be easy to avoid those people in the future, and to bring it to the attention of the server, as a whole, so that others won't get duped by these thieves either.  Also, the first time some one did this in your group, you have the option to hearth and disband from the group, so you are not further wasting your time.  
---
So, in a era of cross server LFG, where there are no repercussions for your actions, this is more of a big deal then in the classic version of the game, where your reputation at 60 will matter, if you want to participate in group content. 
---
Shitty people will be shitty,  but all these conspiracies about rampant ninja looting seems far off.  
---
And now that most.. some.. several?  Of us have careers and high paying jobs, the time investment is greatly outweighed by the cost of gold.  I have a feeling Blizzard isn’t going to do much about gold buying this time around other than the most perfunctory efforts
---
Middle ground exists. Everquest had you camping a single mob for literally several hours while also competing with other players, with no way to share the tag. 
---
I don't think even the players back then enjoyed that considering a lot of them went on to make WoW.
---
you mean, me? Or the in-game one?
---
Rogues tend to get jobs on every important encounter ever made. Probably the most responsibility, honestly.
---
People were just as elitist in retail vanilla. I agree. 
---
Remember when rolling a troll priest meant you were a complete moron? And yet troll is considered better than undead in pvp nowadays 
---
Nah, you are missing a key idea. Think about Weight Watchers. They use a points based system to help people lose weight, it works because they decided items are worth X number of points based on the calories in them, so if users simply adhere to the points, they stay under calories
---
Same thing here
---
The community could come together and give every single item its own unique rating not tied to rarity/ilvl, etc. I.e. if this weapon with a lower ilvl is better for this spec, it would be rated higher
---
Obviously a lot of contentious debate would go into that, but that's what people do, come together and hash things out, all the time
---
Then your gear score would be based on these custom ratings.
---
Lot of people in this sub are very close minded and can't think outside the box. 
---
&gt;I don't know what kind of mindset you have but I don't look at an LFR geared player and Mythic geared play in think they have been reward evenly - do you honestly believe that?
---
Well, considering Titanforging is present in the game, they certainly can be rewarded comparably to Mythic raiders when it comes to iLvl, it's just a matter of time. The main difference comes down to achievements and titles along with other cosmetics, which is not exactly as important to a lot of people you are going to be talking with here.
---
Maybe if we all keep our subscriptions wow will be playable in 2020. Only a few more hundred dollars per player and they should be able to strap things together. /s
---
Oh boy. Rogue was my first, and ultimately main, character until Death Knights came out. The anger and frustration I felt as I worked to level my rogue mostly solo is the stuff of legends. Nearly all of my friends easily out-leveled me, some who started after I did. I did finally end up raiding but being stuck with a somewhat weak, big damage dealer wasn't fun as I was very limited in what I could really do by myself. I started a druid on a private server and absolutely love it, never again will I be stuck only playing one class.
---
battlegrounds or level an alt that was not in a capital city were like the only thing to do if you could log on for half an hour before work or another thing that was about to start.
---
Eyjafjallajökull
---
Yeah but people disagree with that "hypothetical" because you will know people around the server, classic is a lot about that. So having some of your friends on another shard would suck. Imagine being the one that did the whole AQ even questline and u are one of the people that can get the mount in the 24 hours, tons of people are just their to "watch" who gets it etc. But half of your guild is on another shard, a lot of people you traded with (enchanters or w.e it could be that knows u) are on another shard, so they wont be like "Wow u actually got the mount" etc because they dont see it. Now it's just an example but acording to a lot of people this is what classic is about, community, achivement. It kinda ruins it if their is more then 1 world per server.
---
Ofc for some people that aren't very social it wont matter.
---
This would be way worse on an RP server ofc. I imagine they would be even more mad about it.
---
For starting zone however its acceptable (you won't really know everyone yet anyway, it's only for a limited time, hopefully you wont be sharded in cities so you can "meet everyone their" etc. 
---
Troll female priest, was in time of vanilla wow but believe way after it release was young and played in internet cafe as i couldnt afford game subscription back in that time, name was something like Exismiss, as i couldnt use random name and i couldnt speak English at all. I reached level ~34 and i didnt play anymore dont remember reasoning/
---
No. I played a Fury warr a bit in high end content and threat was an issue. There were times when I had to back off the dps so the tank can maintain aggro. Rogues have ways of dumping threat, fury warriors don't. 
---
If I wanted to play a doc class again though I'd just go Mage. 
---
This is a great story! I remember having similar feelings of awe and wonder when entering Westfall (I started in Elwynn so never did the treck from Kalimdor, though I remember a similar treck when heading to Desolace for the SM quests, but I digress). I had joined my friend's guild at that point and two high levels (a lvl 60 dwarf paladin named Tylerdurden and a lvl 58 female human rogue) ran me and a couple others through DM. It was the most amazing feeling of amazement and pride and being associated with these juggernauts who could crush these elites that would kick my butt. It's one of my fondest WoW memories from the early days (ca early 2005).
---
Once AQ and Naxxramas come out you'll be farming way more than just 1 week boy.
---
I remember on the last private server I was on, our guild started farming gear and consumables for AQ release like 3-4 months before the raid was scheduled to come out.
---
SL locks are insane 1v1. I agree that there are better specs for bgs, but SL lock is damn near impossible for some classes to kill unless the lock is a complete moron. 
---
As a hunter I would literally rather fight any other class/spec in the game than a SL lock. 
---
I was on a massively populated server at first. Stayed populated a long time. Then with merges, it merged with another. Now it's dead again. Unsubbed now- but sometimes I logged onto an rp server just to enjoy trade chat again.
---
= do not let TBC get released
---
I think this would result in going hunter on a pve server and farming non aggressive mobs non-stop, no quests. 
---
I don't understand what the point of it is, except for being extreme and trying to attract twitch views? Pretty arbitrary rules. Like just add "no flight paths" and "must play zoomed in to first person" and "request a duel vs everyone you meet", or "can only use bedpans IRL and eat hot pockets" ffs.
---
You're going to be surprised if we get it released at the end of the time frame that they said it was going to be released? Lol. 
---
What does 'because EU' mean?
---
I wanted to play a Druid but my 5 other gaming friends had already chosen Classes and one was a Druid.  I ended up playing a Hunter and now that I think back on it I was probably the most meme-spec huntard.  I fixed my spec and completed a bunch of raids but I couldn't take the grind at the start of TBC and quit shortly afterwards... I was raiding and having fun right before TBC, then the xpac hits and I'm back to grinding fml.
---
You can always unsubscribe. Nobody is stopping you.
---
no changes
---
Nobody cares about casual players playing the same content. People care about content being nerfed to be accessible to casual players. 
---
If you play casual and are capable of beating the top content nobody in the world will give a shit. If you are casual and are not capable of beating the top content and want the content reduced in difficulty so you can beat it also you are an entitled idiot. 
---
I'm not saying anyone is a dick who isn't trying to deny the others chance to see the same content that they see for reduced rewards. I know the majority of higher end raiders probably feel the progression path is too close, which I would agree. 
---
I would agree that the majority do not even think about, not would have any opinion about others who have not achieved, which is why LFR makes no difference to them or the majority. The rewards for higher end raiding aren't enough, and the rewards for lower end raiding are too high (ilevel should be constantly the same levels as HC dungeons and no titanforging and maybe release a full tier after any other difficulty but whilst the rewards are still relevant) - I could see a benefit in keeping raid difficulties on a completely separate progression path, with skill determining if you can bridge that gap, not gear. 
---
Nothing is stopping anyone gaining WF and all the prestige that goes with right now - do method have an argument that because they can been the raid Inna week it's too easy and open to too many casuals? What if they got to decide how long they would like the raid to last them and they said 3 months minimum, giving no one else the chance to kill anything ? Is that fair? Who gets to decide the threshold? Is 10% of players or 0.01% like naxx? 
---
Decursive does favor alliance imo. Pallies can just spam a button and nullify the other team's traps, sheeps, viper stings, and more. Horde with Shaman purge is more offense oriented which isn't as helped by decursive
---
On a side note, fuck decursive. I hope that garbage mod isn't in classic. 
---
no
---
July, level 16 gnome, with engineering. An obvious reference to time machine?
---
PS. "Start im Sommer" literarly means "start in summer"
---
But it IS more social, because you can bypass the tediousness by MAKING FRIENDS. Again, how is this  such a difficult concept to grasp?
---
Nothing wrong inherently with the idea of spending some of your own for a friend, but as it DKP was established it wasnt allowed to used this way (atleast I'v never heard of it). I wouldn't be against such, but this happening in secret would breed miss trust. The hardest thing about vanilla is the organisation of so many players into coherent unit. I see your point of view and lets say you want to use your DKP for a friend. Bring it out on the open and ask about it. If the guild is okay with it, no harm done, but if they are not, you are undercutting fellow raiders to do it in secret.
---
Yes.
---
This would not be humanly possible with the stipulation of having to marathon it. The safest way to ironman with all the restrictions including talents and healthpots is to grind lower level mobs and not go any where populated or do difficult quests, the leveling time would be significantly lower than normal. Talents and consumables you craft and loot seem reasonable for an ironman. Just no gear past white, no grouping or help.
---
Fuck that. You should play games to have fun. If you don't find it fun to farm gold for several hours a week then don't play a game that requires you to farm gold several hours a week. 
---
I guess you were better at wow when you were 12 than I was at 13? lol.  
---
Why does that even matter xD
---
I think my first char was a male Tauren warrior (ironic as I've never ever played this race as main and ended up playing mostly trolls or undead). I distinctly remember this was on the public beta client, which I could BARELY run. When I spawned I saw a yellow human mage who I foolishly tried attacking... after that, he polymorphed me and started doing /lol emotes, lol. It was a completely amazing experience even though I ran the game at 10 fps at best. At some point I tried the zeppelin from OG to UC and I remember I could no longer play my character because by the time the client loaded the new zone, I was already on the way back with the same zeppelin. Good times...
---
&gt;Yeah I was Raidleader and GM of a progressing guild in vanilla, managed to clear AQ40 and try a bit of Naxx before TBC launched.
---
Couldn't you then be the raid leader and GM of a progressing guild in Vanilla that focuses on helping casuals experience content rather than advocating for a massive change in Classic's endgame content that most of the community is stalwartly against?
---
Carrying casuals through content they wouldn't normally experience seems like that's a major part of your enjoyment from raids based on what you said. If that's how you get your kicks, do that instead of advocating for serious endgame alterations. I don't see why that solution is unsatisfactory if it provides you with "priceless reactions". You'd just be stripping yourself of that with raid tiers.
---
Night Elf Hunter named "The"  haha
---
Right, but how does that addon know if the lock you are looking at is affliction, SM ruin, or DS ruin? Or if that druid is HotW hybrid, straight resto, feral dps/tank or feral tank/dps? On top of that, a lot of those gear pieces are going to be very subjective. It'd be a convoluted clusterfuck trying to boil all that down to some set number; and then you need that number to actually mean something have be consistent across each class and spec. It's a way bigger mess than I think you expect, gear score was already very problematic back in Wotlk where gear was a lot more progressive than it was in vanilla.
---
Relax Internet tough guy, no need to get all pumped up and toss out downvotes.  I said appealing, didn’t say I was going to do it. 
---
And even if I were, some neckbeard has no influence on whether or not I would play a game that requires farming.  
---
Thanks for your concern, though!  
---
EUrope, streamers or at least the ones anyone cares about are all American so the extra ping saves EU servers from dealing with the asshats and their legion of boot lickers.
---
It's crazy to me that there are more people defending phasing/sharding on /r/classicwow than there are on /r/wow! When did this place become so incapable of criticizing Blizzard?
---
Love it. Love how this subreddit knows WHEN to post a selfie. In this case it's a proper reason. ;)
---
I'm a nice guy, if everyone wants to clear all the wings from SM, I have no problem doing so.
---
... But some people keep saying we need to do Graveyard, but that's not one of the three SM wings. I'm not sure how to make them understand.
---
&gt;Shadow Reach would be better than shadow weaving. 6% of your shadow damage is insignificant, but the extra range to keep enemies snared with mindflay can keep that warrior at 6m instead of 5.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;More points in shadow focus would be better than imp mind blast helping cover shadow res gear / buffs. Resisting a scream means you or your team dies. 
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, I'm struggling to decide between Healing Focus or Martyrdom or both. HF only applies to healing spells but it's constant, and very useful if you need to get a self heal of while a rogue is wailing on you. Martyr gives 100% against interrupt on all casts and 20% resistance to interrupts, which would be huge if it wasn't situational.  
---
&gt; Are you planning to not hard cast at all?  
---
Yes, I plan on hard casting. But the problem with this type of build is that it spreads you too thin. If I'm going to 5th tier in Shadow, then take advantage of shadow damage and I'll only be hard casting Mind Blast for dmg, it has a 1.5 sec cast and adds to Blackout proc. I won't be casting Smite or Holy Fire. Yes to Heal but not sure I'd be casting that enough to warrant 5 points in DF. But I agree Warr, Hunter, and Rogue will be the bane of my existence. So, you might be right about HF and DF. But I'll keep renew instead of HS in that case. 
---
Here is my revised build:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGs0bZf0toZVMgzcd](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGs0bZf0toZVMgzcd)
---
No shit sherlock.
---
&gt; Rogues or Warriors are "new player friendly" 
---
I'd say Druids are, as officially states on 2004's WOW website. But, for some reason, warrior was always the default in character creation. About rogue being new player friendly? Never heard that. Only that rogue is quick to level because doesn'T require mana or HP breaks.
---
&gt; Hunters are easy mode 
---
probably someone looked at level 19 horde's in warsong gulch.
---
&gt; Hybrids have to respec and it's not fair. 
---
WOW is not hybrid-friendly, and the respec cost is what also makes it not meta-build-hybrid-friendly.
---
&gt; Locks are bad on Alliance 
---
where did you even hear that? from some gnome horde separationist?
---
&gt; Rogues are OP 
---
they are not only capable of killing, like everyone else, but also of sapping the same player every minute, and in many cases, of killing without the victim ever getting out of CC.
---
&gt; Vanilla is the most unbalanced ever 
---
in terms of balance between specs and class, I agree. But it'S the natural economy, supply vs demand. Nobody wants to play a least-needed spec. Which makes the game balance itself. Especially in a re-play, such as WOW classic, when we know what abilities, resistances, etc, will be useful.
---
&gt;The tickets that Blizzard gets has clearly always been surrounding the greed rolls
---
Ok. You are a moron.
---
I honestly don't want any changes to classic, I just disagree that several difficulties being the root cause retail wow being dogshit. 
---
And I'm crap at getting my point across without looking like a troll apparently. I don't want lfr in classic, but of all the things I'd strip out of retail tomorrow it wouldnt be that. 
---
I like the idea of what a druid is supposed to be and its ability to shift forms for different effects. Overall I love the nature feeling to the spells. Also love shaman for the same reason.s
---
I'll be playing on EU servers so whilst there are streamers it's nothing like the following NA streamers have
---
For that sweet grinding torture?
---
Smoke the powder snort the thistle!!!!
---
Wait.
---
I like how he captioned the picture with the caption the picture already has. 
---
When the server names come out and all the streamers start announcing where they want to play the mods should sticky a post that shows which servers to avoid. 
---
In all fairness I wasn't mocking balance, only that the word came up in the context that it did. 
---
numbers, my friend. *links icy veins*
---
Jötunn!
---
There is some good advice here. I agree warriors and rogues should not be advertised as OP or easy. Rogues *were* OP and warriors could be but in 1.12 things are different. Warriors you NEED a current raid tier weapon(s) to have fun in PvP in 1.12, unlike early Vanilla where any slow 2h would do. Spriest and locks just wont die otherwise and your survivability isn't as high as other classes gear up. 
---
Rogues also suck in BGs which you touched on but it should be fleshed out. In the pre BG era of Vanilla, rogues were a scourge and it's when the World of Roguecraft videos were made. In 1.12 they no longer have the same relative power and are hard to get into raids. 
---
I think most defenders are looking at it for a smooth launch. The expectation is that if launch isn't smooth it will hurt the community in the long run more than sharding in the starter zones. I don't see alot of defenders of it beyond the start zones. 
---
I did a ton of twinking in the 49 bracket with 3 friends we all had various classes.  If you're into the 49s you get 30 point talents which can be a huge deal.   We had an MS warrior, disc/holy priest, SL warlock and a pom/pyro mage.  Good times =)  
---
Your question is really hard to answer in general.  Every bracket is different and has different talent possibilities.  Personally I'm very biased against the level 19 bracket, I think gameplay only really gets fun at 39 but then at 49 you hit peak twinking as everyone has mounts and spec possibilities / gear are so much more interesting. 
---
Also at 19 you get the most 'tryhards' and the biggest power imbalance.  A 49 twink can be extremely strong, but at least you aren't this god-tier level above other 49s.   19 twinks with the full kit are ridiculous, hunters outranging and kiting everyone or rogues one-shotting with ease.  Kind of silly. 
---
Nothing funnier than 1 shotting someone your level with a gnomish death ray lol
---
Probably because the phasing of people on the same server for the launch of the game is very different from persistent phasing that uses a pool of all servers in a region?
---
Phasing itself can be a useful tech, but can also be misused or poorly implemented. Don't blame the hammer, blame the carpenter. 
---
Everything outside of the in game rules is retarded. Though not being able to make money on the AH is just as dumb too. Who the fuck wants to go through all of that garbage and then can't just turn the game off and sleep as needed? 
---
&gt;I recently participated in LOTROs legendary servers, and for the last few months hop on from time to time to see the community still strong long after the initial hype has worn off 
---
and it's not vanilla! It's not THAT different from the today's LOTRO.
---
&gt; My leveling pace is super slow as I'm still in the low 40s 
---
I am in upper 30s, and even though I'm leveling with +25% XP buff, I agree. The legendary servers have x0.6 XP rate against the standard servers. The problem is, there are only 2 servers, and it'S extremely hard to find a group for a low-level dungeon. But, in WOW, it's different. Look at private servers, which alone have more players than the entire LOTRO...
---
Yes I agree with you.
---
There are many important things sharding can take away.
---
Blizzard could be afraid of the lag fest that was the first aq opening.  I got dc'd and didn't get to see most of it. 
---
Hopefully they leave sharding out and prepare resources for increased server activity for these parts of classics new life. 
---
Yea, it is a bit weird. I'm in a guild with a nice group of guys. I guess it's just I don't have anything better to do. They only raid 6 hrs a week anyway, so plenty of time for other games or activities in my free time.
---
I see you are quite a keyboard warrior. I've been arguing with blizzard apologists like you since MoP, and I think I've heard all these arguments hundreds of times at this point. Now I just don't care. 
---
Just look at the number of subscribers  - you will see that the game is at it's lowest point. I know they are not official, but there a couple of really good estimated numbers floating around, all about -3-4 millions tops. 
---
&gt; As they said VT but also get shadow reach and healing focus, invaluable for pvp.
---
Done.
---
I disagree about Meditation. Priests stack Spirit right, most gear has some spirit. My understanding is that regeneration stops the moment you cast for 5 seconds. If you think about a long BG battle those 5 seconds every instant cast means you basically have no regen going on at all during a fight. So having 15% regen always going on adds up to a fair amount of saved Mana. Unless I'm missing something about how this all works. 
---
I’m sure this is the same as a lot of people but my most memorable times were leveling in stv and the wpvp through the 30s. Reading, healing and drinking in nessingwarys tent to come back swinging, playing wide-ranging 1v1s as and against rogues with mobs getting aggroed, fierce competition for leveling areas, and getting jumped while coming out the BB tunnel. Retail just doesn’t have this amount of substance
---
You realize hes the retail daddy right? Like yeah he said some very pro classic shit at the classic panel but hes still the guy heading up BFA and all the anti vanilla mindset mechanics.           
---
           
---
Ion can talk till hes blue in the face about what made Classic great but when his Activision masters snap their fingers he will danace just like the rest of them.
---
I dont know if defending is the right word for it. I defend their decision to do SOMETHING at launch. Because 3-10k people in starts zones would suck butt and that wouldn't be reliving the true vanilla experience either. I think people get the true vanilla experience confused with the nost experience.  
---
People that are so gun ho about nochange and not having sharding in classic for the starting zones are dillusional and don't really know what theyre talking about =). 
---
Also I did the 6 month renewal, so even if I quit I was paid up through March or so anyway.
---
Priests are way more effective because they can dispell 2 magical buffs/debuffs at the same time, and they are available to both factions.
---
Hmmm... cata I think
---
If it's not gearscore then it's: min req pre-bis! And so on. People will always assume people with better gear are better. Which in the case of vanilla is probably gonna be right 
---
Is that the guy from Dawson't Creek?
---
What evidence do you want? I can probably dig out some screenshots and link my main from classic that's in them?
---
I, for one, approve of you rubbing into the faces of those of us that were wrong.
---
Tauren druid. Changed server a month later to join friends and made another tauren druid, the exact same, that became my main until I quit retail.
---
I loved the druid class in Diablo 2 and the ability to turn into animals. Obviously that didn't go really as planned and I was forced to heal all the time, respec'ing to feral every second day for some fun in Pvp... Hybrids were really rough back then.
---
&gt; The latest Interview which we had to translate from German talks about how they are confident that they will release classic for a Start of Summer 2019.
---
They didn't say that. They said that you can start playing WoW Classic in summer, not at the start of it.
---
\- Avoid streamer servers. Check. Thank you all.
---
Too me thats that last paragraph is what "twinking" really is. Twinking a 49 doesn't really exist, thats just basically running dungeons on that character to get the BIS gear you need.   
---
Twinking is when your high level character provides for your low level character, of course theres some things you need to do on your lowbee, but by the time you hit 49 you should probably just hit 60, why not at that point? 
---
Twinking a low level character is to make them extremely OP for their level.
---
Or which ones to choose, if you want a crowded server
---
Warlock is one of the easiest classes to gear.
---
Autism is strong with this one 
---
100%. Shortly before the game drops I plan on browsing for pre-launch communities I like, and following them. I was originally in a pre-launch RP community, and that really helped shape my experience for the better. It also so happened that both the servers I rolled were originally high pop and active (Bleeding Hollow, and later Maelstrom when RP-PvP servers launched). Of course several years later Maelstrom became the 'wrong' server and Emerald Dream became the right one. 
---
Yea, that's probably true for a lot of things, but maybe not true for all qol. Things that were defined through the database or are different in retail anyway. Like the boss debuffs thing. The numbers in thr database for boss health and whatnot were keyed on 8 debuffs, but retail is unlimited. They said maybe they were going to limit to 16, but that qol would be more work than setting it to 8 because of the need to balance boss health.
---
I forget what they said about debuffs so that might not be a good example, but just an idea how qol could require more work in some cases. You are right though, quite a few probably cost less to just leave in.
---
Looks like the "contest winner tabard" 
---
You are seriously defending gold buying? And on a high horse? The fuck...
---
I mean yeah, I don’t think there is any one right answer. I was just looking for ideas. But obviously it’s gonna vary widely based on bracket. 
---
I like the idea of the 39 bracket the most. It feels more sophisticated than 19s because more classes can come to play, but it also is still distinct from level 60 PvP gameplay. Movement is still at a premium without mounts. Toolkits aren’t fully complete yet but a lot of the major things are available (including max eng). It just feels really unique compared to the other brackets, imo. But that’s a different conversation.
---
Every raids seems to have between 6-12. Warriors. Can't be too hard 
---
Massive server fights over world bosses.  I love the tension in the air as your raid team stands assembled and seeing rival pvp guilds standing at a distance, daring each other to pull first.
---
Definitely easy to quest, but playing them well is more difficult than most other classes. They had a reputation for being awful in instances despite having the best cc in the game when played right. That's a pretty solid testament to how poorly they are generally played.
---
Same goes for pvp. Yeah. A bad hunter will beat a bad player at most other classes, but people aren't bad anymore. No fd/trap macro a skilled melee will shit on you. Not being mana efficient when needed means a good druid will shit on you.  Then you have classes that are really hard to counter (frost mage, warlock) and have to have good timing on reflect trinkets and the few interrupts you have (fd, scatter, intimidation, nades). If you just send your pet in from a mile away, it will get killed or cc'd.
---
Word doesn't break death coil. Honestly it's easy being a ally lock. Everyone is not expecting you. And to be honest there are more orcs than undead imo 
---
I take it you've never built something or developed software before??
---
All those questions could be answered and assigned values. Nothing you asked is impossible to do by any means. Addons are certainly capable of telling which spec you are in.
---
IDK what else to say except you severely underestimate developer's abilities to solve problems.
---
&gt;Feral druid(prolly the closest hybrid to being good): Has to tank often(This is like the primary reason you would bring them), has druid responsibilites like combatres, innervate **(shouldn't have to buff because their buffs are weaker)**
---
What Druid in their right mind would give up Furor and be completely useless for anything but raiding for 3 more stats?
---
And it was at its highest after wrath, which had 4 different raid difficulties and different raid size combinations to cater to most type of players  (lich king 10 nm man was killed almost 2 months before lich king 25 hc).
---
So sub numbers were highest with at least 2 raid sizes and difficulties - is that your point, that those are the best number?  I wouldn't disagree with that  I think mm/HC and 10/25 man went far enough and perhaps we didn't need LFR past a sightseeing/Spectator mode with no loot. 
---
Fyi, Flash of Light is the primary heal for a Holy Pala. It has a crazy high healing output and you never go oom using it so you can cast it without pause throughout the entire encounter.
---
&gt;There are definitely bad rank 14s, but most people who out that much time into it are really good players who love pvp. They would also have a ton of consumables and a huge gear advantage. Unless these are bought accounts, a blue geared shadow priest isn't winning.
---
I generally agree, but OP was talking about comparing the skill ceiling in Vanilla with the skill ceiling in Classic or on private servers. If you watch some Vanilla PvP videos, you'll see plenty of rank 14s that could be beaten by any semi-competent player nowadays regardless of gear or class.
---
Vael, going balls to the wall with DPS until you draw the short straw and burn out in a blaze of glory. And this time I'm rolling alliance so I'll have salv -- I'll be able to push even harder.
---
I play a healer, I don't farm shit :P
---
I played official release of chogall.  Was most fun I ever had in the game.  Wading through 2k+ people que was just part of the adventure.  I personally play bfa and have seen how terrible sharding is and want no part of it I’m classic.
---
I'm concerned i'll pick a server with people that are coming back for the first 30 lvls and then dipping. Inflating the server for the first few weeks or a month driving away players that would be there for the long haul for a possibly shorter que. Then when the first couple months are up and people realize the game isn't for them they are gone and large chunk of the player base will just disappear. I am toying wit the idea of waiting a few weeks or a month. I'll try and stay away from streamers. All the same i would totally like to play with Josh from countdown to classic. 
---
People that use"ugh" in a pretentious manner make me cringe of the face of the Earth
---
C'Thun, I want to fight this Old God while he is relevant content.
---
It's not about downtime. Mages can kill things safely and easily and have CC abilities at their disposal if things go wrong. Warriors have none of that. As a warrior you just straight up can't do certain quests that other classes would breeze through. If you facetank a mob and get bad rng with too many parries/misses you basically just die.
---
Ragnaros for the (second) first time.
---
Mechanically not much going on but epic af nonetheless.
---
Spell crits deal x1.50 damage by default. A talent that increases crit damage bonus by 100% brings that to x2 damage. Bonus crit from moonkin area doesn't offset the damage lost from a pure DPS class.
---
I will probably just choose Burning Legion since that was my Vanilla server. Hoping to see some old names from back in the day geet resurrected.
---
Your tanks should have an addon that automatically removes salvation. I believe it's a lazy pig feature. You 100% want your pallies blessing salv on warriors. Besides warlock, warrior has the most threat issues in the game. If your guild isn't super tryhard you'll find you spend a lot of time sat afk auto attacking out of fear of pulling aggro.
---
I had the level 49 warrior in this group.  I would often be able to beat other level 60 warriors in /duel without using any cheese.. I would have more HP, similar weapon, and PVP talents.  The 49s were VERY strong if we got lucky with some drops.  
---
In BGs we would regularly win 2v4, 3v5, etc type of engagements.  While it wouldn't be the same as at 19 when it's basically no contest, at least in this bracket it requires skill and coordination to win those lopsided fights.   I also  had a 49 shaman that was a flag runner / PVP tank type of character and that guy was borderline unkillable.  IMO they were definitely twinks, a clear step or two above the other level 48s or 49 in the BG and especially deadly in synergy with other twinks getting support / heals / range dps etc. 
---
Hunters have a surprisingly large amount of responsibility. Normally raids only bring 3-4 of them, which means every hunter must be able to tranq shot, pull bosses and trash, kite, etc. On top of this you have to manage your pet. While not very difficult, a poorly managed pet or a momentary loss of focus can easily wipe the raid.
---
Jealous of that beard. Really does match that guy in the video well..  says my terrible memory. Get your cosplay on, want to see the full setup. Was the guy holding a double barrel hunting gun un the video you reference, I forget?
---
30'ish when installed first time- beta -a friend was on the early design team and my late teens son wanted to play as well. He was mage for life.
---
I had never played a game in my life to that point. But I loved the theory behind Paladins. 
---
I got her to 20 by release and re-created her. I played holy throughout. My husband started at release and rolled a warrior tank. So it took us forever to kill anything when the sons mage wasn't grouped- but dammit, we hardly ever died. About 2 weeks into release we took over a guild a friend of ours had started and this guild still exists, although mostly 'retired'. 
---
At our peak we had to split into two guilds- one for hardcore raiders and the original for the support team- professions, grinding mats &amp; leveling.
---
Once I got her to 60, got her charger and started raiding I rolled a mage and hunter. 
---
Yeah max level profession is a cool part of level 35.  I never really got into professions for twinks just felt like a gold sink and made the playing field even more uneven =P
---
If I find a streamer doing this I'm going to find them fighting a mob, buff them, then insta-kill the mob they're fighting so they get XP.
---
Xholy. xmarkish. Consistent, at least.
---
You can't view people's specs and talents in classic wow, please take your condescending attitude to a sub where you know what you are talking about.
---
Wind fury is shit. The damage it provides doesn't even come close to blessing of salvation from paladins. Fury warrior has a ton of threat issues.
---
I guess I can see your point regarding cross-server LFG affecting it.
---
But there's still a big difference between 4 voices complaining about a ninja vs. 1 voice.
---
100% this, kinda want to find a mid pop server myself, but really want to just dodge any and all of the big name streamers
---
Literally nobody said doing these things were hard. However YOU said Warlocks can coast through Vanilla which is objectively false. Your desperate attempt at saving face is hysterical.
---
I went to GVSU and played a lot during GVSU also. Still here in GR with three local buddies who are planning on playing classic when it drops.   We have tons of original classic experience, bunch of the expacks and private server raiding also.  You still looking to create that guild?
---
Undead Frost Mage!  Ugh.  So much fun.
---
Nochangespls
---
Got to wait for BC and Cloak. 
---
I am also from WI and the idea of cows do not 'titillate' me.. :-D
---
They are tasty though.
---
MOOOOOOOOO
---
Lmao I guess I haven’t changed that much innit 
---
The out-of-game rules are subjectively stupid. You literally *can't* complete those anyway, as Twitch suspends you for streaming while sleeping. I'm tempted to say this whole thing is just a joke/troll post, given the essentially no-sleep allowed for the entire time rules. No one will hit 60 in 7 days real time with white gear given all the other requirements.
---
Chogall a private server? Again you're not looking at the true vanilla experience. If people really wanted the true vanilla experience we'd have limits to like 500 people logging onto the server at a time, and then being stuck looting a corpse for 30 minutes after you killed something. Nobody wants that. People want a smooth launch.  
---
This conversation happens everytime someone brings up sharding... Its only happening in the starting zones for the first week or so they said? Just get over it. You may have had fun making your way through 2k+ people but for a majority of people that sounds like aids and is no way like classic. Its like private servers...  
---
These starting zones the first couple weeks are going to be such a TINY part of your journey through classic its ridiculous to get worked up over it. I dont even know if theyre doing the whole starting zone like elwynn forest but even if they do... Thats 1-10 MAYBE 1-12 that you have sharding involved with. If you're looking to meet up with thousands of people I'm sure you can just head to a major city and you can join them all.  
---
Yes I dont see it happening. In a raid of 40 players you will inevitably have players that will google everything that the raid has issues with and get frustrated that the raidleader wont do the same.
---
Eventually these players will quit and join a better guild and your guild will start to bleed players until you cant even kill the bosses you used to be able to kill.
---
I'd like to see you do this challenge, OP. Seems like you're very confident in it.
---
Regardless of rules etc. If someone can pay a bit of money to cut out a shit load of grind then they're going to do it when they have limited play time. The worst part is, there is nothing you can do to stop it.
---
At the same time, you think there wasn't gold buying going on in the World First guilds?
---
Even some of the most hardcore players were buying gold back in the day.
---
The funny thing is, you kind of did the right thing back then. You’ll see, if you roll a paladin in Classic, you will mostly do white dmg throughout the leveling (hence people say they are slow and somewhat boring to level). 
---
Just gonna say this.... Restore druid do ONLY have combat ress for dungeons... 
---
I got her to 20 by release and re-created her. I played holy throughout. My husband started at release and rolled a warrior tank. So it took us forever to kill anything when the sons mage wasn't grouped- but dammit, we hardly ever died. About 2 weeks into release we took over a guild a friend of ours had started and this guild still exists, although retired'. 
---
At our peak we had to split into two guilds- one for hardcore raiders and the original for the support team- professions, grinding mats &amp; leveling. This [was my birthday present one year](https://i.imgur.com/Nc4SLrT.jpg) from my guys. [I loved them to death and will never forget them.](https://i.imgur.com/Ilw85oB.jpg) 
---
Once I got her to 60, got her charger and started raiding I rolled a mage and [hunter](https://i.imgur.com/Ouqm2Wz.jpg). 
---
1. Spell crit is x1.5.  Melee and ranged crit is x2.
---
2. \+100% is 100% of 0.5, meaning you go from 1.5 to 2x.  It's a horribly worded tooltip (especially since others say "50% more" and actually mean it). 
---
3. Yes, but you lack threat generation and sustain.
---
4. I don't think this is anything new and groundbreaking.
---
5. On a long cast that's easy to interrupt.
---
The biggest flaw of the Moonkin was mana.  If you're doing a lot of shapeshifting and healing, you'll be burning a lot of mana.  I'm not saying it's bad in PvP (I don't know, only played Feral before 70), just that it's not going to be the be-all end-all you think it is.
---
Hogger.
---
That’s my point, thank you.   These laughable Internet knights are jumping on me for making a statement.  Hilarious.  
---
Why?
---
I just smash buttons on my pre bis 60 rogue. I do around 400-600 DPS on boss fights.. only fully epic geared rogues and warriors has beat me on damage yet. I really don't think it matter that much lol 
---
I am going to skip raids completely for my choices. I am most looking forward to those leet raiders dying to jandice barov in scholomance. 
---
Another great encounter, although not too hard, is the boss summon for the warlock epic mount. 
---
Raids I think there is always a margin of error, which means on almost all encounters you can have people afk. 
---
Do you really think that after 15 years people still dont know what a balance druid has to offer? They are still bad. Sorry.
---
I like the idea of Affliction Lock - Marksman Hunter - Disc Priest.  Drain Mana, Viper Sting, and Mana Burn! 
---
On every pserver I've played, and also if you just get your own client and make a personal server, 
---
When you summon a new demon it just stuns your current one.
---
It's hard to believe Blizzard is actually going with this instant delete pet thing.
---
Then just make them root or Slow mmune? No need to fuck with resistances, just make them immune to traditional kiting methods. Wouldn’t affect warlocks or priests, but it’s a start.
---
Coasting as in nothing a warlock does is a challenge.
---
It’s not false. Warlock is an easy class to raid with, stop trying to convince yourself that it isn’t. I’ve mained warlock since Vanilla, and on multiple private servers. I guarantee I know more about this than you do.  
---
Thats fair I feel like the same is doable at 60 though in BGs if you have the gear that you can work for. You can 2v4 3v5 people if youre gear is up there and If I'm going all the way to 49 I might as well finish it up =D.  
---
I like a challenge but thats when I play my max level character in BGs, when I think of twinking someone I just want to go poo on some people.  
---
Your outlook on twinking is fair though and in the end is all about what YOU want to do =). 
---
Balance is not as good as others (to not say bad) in pve, no one say it's not good for pvp
---
LOL every single piece pre-BiS or fucking kill yourself is already the norm.
---
I’m really looking forward to the loot dragons in BWL (Lashlayer, Flamegor, Ebonroc, Firemaw).
---
They are all a complete cake walk, but they also drop a lot of top tier gear which can really help a raid get geared up extremely quickly. It’s also fun because the first two bosses are so hard in comparison that it really provides a huge moral boost to guilds.
---
hordes of morons following them.
---
came here to say this.
---
Heres hoping....
---
But still, thats going to leave the people that don't check the reddits and discords likely choosing the wrong servers. Either way this goes, with low pop caps, there's going to be some dead servers.
---
I feel for those folks in advance, because leveling is slow, so re-rolling isn't that much fun, plus waiting on mergers or transfers sucks. "Oh hey, now there's 3 scarab lords on this server thanks to mergers, lol #community"
---
Oh, definitely. There was a rank 14 mage we used to play with who was terrible. We ended up replacing him on our arena team in tbc, because he couldn't do basic shit like cc or change targets when he needed to. He would just pick a target and dump all his mana into bursting them down. 
---
I had even dueled him on my blue geared hunter in vanilla, with him as a rank 14 frost mage. Smoked him every time, and he would go on about how overpowered hunters were, even though other less geared frost mages gave me fits
---
It’s not good for PvP. For every video you see with huge star fire crits, there are dozens of hours of failure. 
---
Flask alone cost nearly 100g. That's about ~2 hours of farming. You should go through about 2 flasks per raid. That's 4 hours farming for one raid night and that's just your flask. Let's say you raid 3 nights a week. That's 24 hours raiding + farming and that's not counting any protection potions, elixirs, food buffs, ekkos, etc etc.
---
I totally understand. When I was a kid and first got the game I choose Druid for shapeshifting. Seems like you love the fantasy / theme of druids like me. I just get bored with the actual mechanics and weakness of many spells to such an extend that they are useless compared to other spells. I found TBC fixed that and added some really cool spells (love Lifebloom).
---
Druids, Rogues, Ret Pally and Shadow Priests all have usefulness but they were always pretty limited numbers in raids.
---
I was 100% dead set on playing holy reck when classic comes out.
---
But according from the info from the demo you will not be able to /sit and get a full 4 stack reck bomb from an npc, which kills 80% of the fun for me .
---
I fully agree with you! Hive Mind and other very exclusive mounts feel rewarding to obtain. Most mounts however are random drops (warfront) from bosses that take zero effort to kill. My nightsaber feels more rewarding then 80 percent of the mounts I got (not obtained in my opinion). The most rewarding mounts I have are the winterspring frostsaber (obtained in vanilla) and the Hive Mind (awesome quest line). 
---
Yes, so that part is a wash. But including other healers means allies get the advantage in dispels due to pally vs shaman. Pally is particularly brutal if you are a hunter in group pvp. 
---
Literally... nobody.. said.. it.. wasnt... easy..
---
Now you are just redefining words because you cant admit you fucked up. You cannot coast through Vanilla as a Warlock. Period.
---
There is not a single class in the game that need to do anything that is "hard". You just have responsibilities that have to be done during the raid. Messing up on your banish or fear on the wrong mob, or not having a soulstone up during a wipe can be just as detrimental to the raid as the maintank not positioning the boss correctly.
---
The first time I saw 3 alliance guys, close to Booty bay entrance as a newcome shaman in Strangletorn Vale  
---
I hid in the bushes in spirit wolf form and spent some time trying to figure out what the hell they were talking about... if I moved a little my nameplate could become visible to them, so I stayed there around 5min, adrenaline high as hell until they're gone
---
&gt;Things have changed and hopefully the realm names will be announced beforehand and there will be polls, and discussions about who is going where.
---
I wouldn't expect anything approaching this reasonable from Activision Blizzard. 
---
i agree with you jabron but how is someone wanting multiple difficulties virtue signaling? just seems like a ridiculous thing to say. its like anyone who doesnt agree with me is snowflake or virtue signaler.. 
---
Classicast streamers will play on a PvP server?
---
Private servers have it wrong. Do I agree that it's pretty clunky to have the pet despawn instantly? Yes of course. But that's actually how it worked. And that's what they say we're gonna get. That's really promising to me.
---
EU has a lot less (very) popular WoW streamers that seem to be interested in Classic it seems, unlike NA which has ppl like Asmon, Soda and upcoming ppl like Tips, Esfand and Staysafe. 
---
Coasting mean easy lol
---
You’re getting hung up on something very silly. 
---
fear ward has a 10min cd. most overrated spell in vanilla.
---
He’s just jealous of your majestic WoW-beard! 
---
I reckon you shouldn't worry about this yet, first of all, no one knows yet how this is going to play out. Is Blizzard going for authentic Vanilla realm caps or are they going to opt for the "pserver" route of "massive" (possibly overpopulated) servers. When they release this info it would be a lot easier i reckon to start planning anything. 
---
Yeah sounds like you and Triangle should stay in retail.
---
Just to get everyone on the same page. When Blizzard says phasing they're talking about quests/events that walk you through different phases where the world changes. It does not mean the action of "phasing" between shards in general. It does obviously require sharding because two players seeing two different worlds can't be in the same environment. There will be no phasing in Classic because there are no quests/events that require it.
---
This person is talking about sharding in general, which they correct with an edit at the end of their post. This isn't super important but I think it's helpful for everyone to use the same terms.
---
If anyone in classic refers to "gear score" automatically know they are complete noob.
---
Item level is absolutely not correlated with the best items in WoW.
---
BiS items like edgemaster are even level 40s items.
---
Will there be server transfers? If so who cares. 
---
Nope I'm not worried about it because I don't intend to play Classic for at least 6 months after it's launched. I'll wait for things to settle before I start playing.
---
It would be "extra-blizzlike" because they will say one thing and do another!
---
Hunter, sadly it was not classic when i started. 
---
Are you planning on play ally or horde? If ally - remember that you are going to be purge spammed by shamans often, making both Imp fort, and Imp renew worse choices to their alternatives.
---
I'm also unsure of how much mileage you are going to get out of Vamp Embrace. Unless you are doing hybrid gearing with +damage, your damage returns (and thus healing) are going to be really poor. I just did some testing for you: with max rank skills and +0 damage (assuming you are going full +heal gear) and you are healing for around 200-250 damage, over 7.5 seconds (Vamp, Pain, Blast, Flay) for about 900 mana. That number only falls off from there when blast is on CD, and does not improve with gear (again unless you start slotting dps gear in which case why not shadow?).
---
That bad DPS, bad HPS, bad DPM, and bad HPM. 
---
Admittedly that is in a group wide AoE, but only you can guess how often you will be playing solo, or in a group of 2,3,4 or 5 to help stretch those numbers from "bad" to "decent, maybe."
---
Conceptually I love the idea of healing via dps, and enjoyed playing smite-heal priest in previous expansions, but the gear constraints of vanilla I don't think lend themselves to VE being useful without gearing as DPS.
---
2c. GLHF.
---
Chogall release during vanilla.  It was one of the first additional servers added to the game.  
---
My main focus, back in the day, was farming the dungeon set. That by itself took ages, but was fun. I might do that again if I can't find the time for raiding.
---
That's pretty logical though, no? Blizzard has announced plans for limited sharding in Classic to address launch issues. That's why there's less criticism of it on /r/classicwow, because it's a different implementation (as far as we know).
---
If they announced Retail-like, full server sharding there would be much more criticsm. Probably more than on /r/wow.
---
I am kinda worried the population will be small, since I am located in the Oceanic region. I'm living in Thailand these days and from my tests, only Oceanic servers have somewhat acceptable ping for me (200 ms). I just hope there will be enough players to make it fun, since I feel it's the least crowded region with regards to WoW players.
---
Someone photoshop a charging bull in the background. 
---
&gt; Pretty obvious you havent played this game much.
---
I haven't healed as a resto druid much since 2006, this is true.  But I stand by what I said.  If you pull threat or the tank gets CC'd or something and the entire mob group scatters and starts beating on you, you need to use whatever tricks you have to not die right away because the heals are going to take a few seconds per player, and if a mob gets loose on me, I have to heal myself before I can deal with healing you.
---
Friends decided for all to be NE to be in proximity even though I wanted to be a Paladin, so I made a NE (yes male) Warrior with green hair. It is what it is.
---
Looking back, starting off with friends in the same area and getting introduced to the game were more important than class at the time. I got the chance to try Paladin in the next beta at least.
---
Warlock on an RP server. When I found out you couldn't PvP on an RP server (and not liking how a warlock played), I re-rolled a rogue on Arthas US and found one of the best server and PvP communities WoW had ever seen. 
---
Just please make sure to actually play a Dwarf. And not some Undead scrub.
---
They absolutely are. They have shown examples of super small details and rather time consuming things being made vanilla like. They have also shown that they listen to demo feedback but double check next to their ref client. They have an example about summoning a demon pet with another active. Feedback and even devs all said the pet is dismissed at the end of the cast, but apparently it was at the start. This shows both what kind of details they look at but also that they use feedback only to find things to fix, not to change. They make it as it was in vanilla. 
---
The only thing I’d worry about is the time. They need a lot of beta testing to find all the details and honestly we can’t expect them to find and fix all before launch, it would take years. I’d say get it 95% right and make sure the big things are as they should be. I don’t care if there is 10 more leaves on one tree down in south Duskwood.
---
Everything beyond Princess H (and all of Nax), as I didn't get to beat them back in Vanilla. 
---
Hakkar was one of my favorite bosses, though. Honestly ZG had A LOT of solid boss fights, looking forward to that whole raid. 
---
Yup. As a human, I'll have Redridge, Westfall, Stormwind, Ironforge, Menethil Harbor, Auberdine, Darnassus, and level 5 within the first hour.
---
Super quick and makes the 10-25 leveling go a lot smoother, since I can fly willy-nilly from one leveling zone to the next.
---
Sunk cost fallacy, if something isnt bringing you joy, it doesn't matter if you already paid for it. 
---
&gt;That's because nobody developed such an addon for private servers.

&gt; I have a feeling Blizzard isn’t going to do much about gold buying this time around other than the most perfunctory efforts
---
I hope they treat it exactly like they did during vanilla:  Go after the gold sellers, leave the gold buyers alone.
---
hyggelig!
---
I really think that Blizzard is going to have in-game Gold purchasing as a game mechanic.
---
Think about it: The core audience for a re-release of vanilla is probably the people who played it the most back when it was new, so people with a lot of free time back then, like teenagers or college students/young adults without kids. That core audience is now late 20s to 30s, probably relatively well off financially, without much time to actually devote to the game like they did previously.
---
The demand for gold is going to be off the charts. Soulless Activision-Bliz could easily get a huge amount of money off people who just want to log in and raid by buying whatever consumables they need rather than farming. I would be shocked if there hasn't been discussions around it. Personally, I would settle for that being the extent of it and I just hope there's no dungeon-loot selling.
---
Those fanbases will disperse real quick, imo. Or stick together as tightly as any large guild- aka I doubt you’d notice them.
---
Yeah, ZG was a lot of fun. Plus there is the small chance to get a tiger mount. While mounts are WAY over saturated in retail, having a ZG tiger or the AQ bug mount in vanilla was a big deal.
---
Video of starfire crit is the same as pom pyro video... do yourself a favor and watch a good balance druid video like stormx
---
Looking forward to [doing this girl again](https://i.imgur.com/ItLyN1G.jpg) in all her original glory and parading her head into Stormwind. That was unforgettable. 
---
Lol. Nothing is special when everything is special. Except for you big guy.
---
Damn, if only I had such a old screenshots. The oldest I can find are from Wotlk and that's only because I uploaded those on FB back in the day.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
I think atleast Tips announced he will go PVP. Dunno about Esfand / Staysafe. I think Asmon talked about going PVE and i think the same for Soda, but not 100% sure on that. 
---
Definitely dwarf hunter cinematic like.
---
Also fake Santa in the Santa Clause 2 movie. Your skin looks like rubber.
---
Probably yes, seeing that servers were a thing in Vanilla. The restrictions might be less though.
---
To Ret Pallies specifically, I hear them always getting a bad rap, but I feel like that's because a lot of people who get the opportunity to play ret pally play it like a faceroll DPS and not a support DPS.  I always thought the point of having a ret pally was for things like Nightfall debuff, Blessing, spot healing, and bubbles.  I only ever raided Horde though, so - grain of salt.
---
Every raid I've been in Warrs get the class salv and the tanks know to click it off. 5 min rebuff seems like a poor solution to the problem.
---
night elf...
---
or...?
---
#changes, erm... night elf.
---
Not now I'm not. Ask me again when I'm looking at the login screen.
---
Shroud, Ninja, Summit, Tim  
---
the ones i remember saying they will stream  
---
so yea EU will be quite chill  
---
All classes have a viable raid spec.  If you come early (not 5 mins late or on time) and with your talents in the right spot you will join the guild raid every time.
---
I only healed in endgame WoW from WotLK+, so IDK if it was different in classic or I made too much work for myself bringing what I needed in terms of flasks and consumables, but are you saying that because healers are rare and in high demand so others will give them flasks and consumables?
---
Its funny to me that they've added so many mounts, and yet I still run around on my Frostwolf (The first epic mount I ever got), because it MEANS something. I played AV every day for who knows how long to get exalted. When I finally went to Arathi and purchased the mount, it was a great feeling. I worked for it and earned it. I've had this mount for over a decade and I have over 150 mounts now, but it is the only one that really makes me FEEL something. A lot of the other mounts I've collected have just been too easy to get in comparison. There was no feeling of seeking it out, working towards it, and EARNING it. 
---
its a good pvp hybrid without moonkin form 
---
Usually healers gets some help from the guild with consumes because it's so hard to farm them yourself. 
---
Just sitting here Hoping a server would be named nostalrius and Im sold
---
*cue dramatic, somber music*
---
*snow-covered Dwarf reaches top of wintery peak. Ironforge looms in the background.  He places a hand on his faithful bear companion.*
---
"Four years have passed..."
---
That's fine up to about AQ40 where you really have to start spending gold on those consumes. Easiest way of getting around it is probably to play tank and just have the guild give you your consumes.
---
Who cares about pirate servers? I'm talking about real WoW back in the day. 
---
Well August 22nd 2006 was when patch 1.12 was released. I wouldn’t be surprised if classic was released around that time 
---
Hoping they go to a pve server
---
&gt; Get your cosplay on, want to see the full setup
---
hunting gun...
---
and I need a license for that... 
---
and in order to get a license, I have to at least complete several months of sport shooting courses... and I have to pay for the gun with something. so, not this year.
---
Also, another problem would be getting a bear... either alive or dead. Alive would be harder to setup the scene, dead would be harder to get. 
---
BTW, hunting guns in WOW are single barrel.
---
I like the subject, so I will respectfully give some counterarguments. Think of it as a journey: you start in a town or hub, then the closest enemies are the easiest, if you go to more remote areas of the zone they get harder, then if you enter some of the buildings or caves they get even harder, then when you find a dungeon they are even harder still. You cannot just go straight from new character to a cave, or even to a remote part of the zone or you will die. There is a progression. As you grow stronger, you now feel strong enough to maybe challenge that cave that stomped you 2 levels before. It makes so that the dungeon feels like a dangerous place, much more dangerous than the open areas close to your town. Raids are simply the next step from dungeons. 
---
In your hockey analogy, everyone can play a game with their friends, same as here: its called the open world. Or you can be a bit more into hockey, and play with your school, it's called dungeons. Or you can play for the Stanley Cup and be the tip of the top, it's called Raiding.   
---
I'd actually wouldn't mind having Soulwell/Tables however I don't think there is even a ghost of a chance of those being added to Classic. I guess it does feel a bit more personal when you have to make and hand them out yourself but it definitely can get a little old after a while.
---
Kill multiple mobs at the same time instead of one. Mages excel at aoe grinding. Use your wand more often.
---
It wasn't in Classic (past patch 1.9) so it's almost certainly not going to be in. There's an old blue post that talks about it being removed.
---
FFXI with its forced hours of mindlessly grinding with a group in the same spot for 10% of a level was what drove me to WoW.  The first time I saw my roommate running around solo killing "high" level mobs, I was hooked.
---
As sad as it might sound, you might actually be partially wrong about that. I fully expect all Classic launch content to be cleared week 1, week 2 tops. 
---
Man, we'll have to see what happens on the actual servers. There's already a huge split between private servers and actual vanilla, mostly with healers, but also with raid compositions in general as people have learned classes and specs.
---
Warriors are weird because they're top dog melee DPS and tanks, but at the same time they are the most played, and very gear dependent. You'll likely have trouble finding a spot if you don't know people or put in work, due to competition. 
---
Hunters are decent DPS early but drop off hard, so guilds will tend to avoid them. You take a couple for tranq shots, but in general there are more hunters than spots, so again could be tough competition.
---
Everyone needs healers, right? Wrong. Shamans, pallys, and druids are shoved into "healer only" for raids, and yet they all kinda take a back seat to priests. While healers were very hard to find in vanilla, everyone now rolls a healing spec on private servers for these classes, and it's kinda healer flooded in my experience.
---
Warlocks *used* to be pretty rare, but now that people know they're top tier in naxx, they'll probably be more common. Problem is, you still don't want to take tons of them, especially early. Spots will still be open for banishment/SS/summoning and other utility.
---
Mages are a top DPS option, but then again there's tons of competition. Hard to stand out from the pack, good to know someone, but you'll keep your raid spot if you get one.
---
Just about every class will get taken to raids, but the main ones getting spammed are mages, priests, and warriors. On the other hand, those are also some of the more popular classes, and people who want to high-tier raid know those are always in demand; so then you've got a lot of competition. Really hard to say.
---
With the large number of tourists that will be dropping off a lot of servers will shrink. Knowing this a head of time Blizzard needs to communicate what their plan is to deal with dead servers. The only two real options that have been given are to just merge low pop servers or close low pop servers and give those players free transfers off.
---
I'd wait and see what Blizzard plans on doing with low pop servers before worrying too much.
---
No it's more a case of it not being necessary most of the time. Our base kit is just fine, on certain bosses we may need consumables but not as a rule of thumb.
---
You won't be doing any reck-bombs in PvP.
---
The /sit macro is not going to work. At the most you'll get one or two extra swings per enounter.
---
On the ground, I was on my felsteed, in the air, on my netherdrake.
---
Nothing to do? That's when you start corpse camping the opposite faction in active leveling areas.
---
Hunters also seem to have limited raid spots from what I've seen from pserver raid videos.
---
The gold you're buying usually comes from hacked accounts whose gold will be restored. This means the gold is essentially duplicated and the economy starts inflating, requiring people to buy more gold and so it inflates even higher which means you're fucking over both yourself and everyone on the server.
---
So please don't buy gold and if you have to, at least buy locally farmed gold from a guildmate who has more free time than you since this won't actually cause inflation.
---
&gt; Besides, it´s not like community dislikes mounts. People want them, so Blizzard is making them.
---
Yes, and the retail community is absolute shit, which is why the game is shit.
---
When I read it i came off like Classic is starting in summer (aka launching in summer), not that Classic is launching at the start of summer.
---
That may be the case in good guilds... I remember chugging major mana pots like crazy back on Nost.
---
A ret pally is helpful for exactly the things you mention. They are super useful to the raid as a whole. But the number of them needed is very low so this would make getting a spot less likely than a warlock, mage, fury warrior or even a hunter as most of the time their dps is just pretty damn low. So you can't start trading out high dps classes for lots of low dps classes despite their utility so in a 40 man (perhaps other than naxx) you're going to see 1 or 2 ret i'd think at most.
---
I still see a diff between a toon that only runs lfr and one the runs mythic - link me a character with the same ilevel as a fully mythic geared raider that hasn't ever stepped into anything but LFR. 
---
Mythic gear would still be special if lfr dropped nothing and normal mode dropped blue and mythic only dropped epics - the separation would still be there without the need to remove a way people get to see the completion of storylines - either that or don't complete storylines in raids, allow story progression and completion outside of them entirely. 
---
There is still people geared to the teeth, it's just the gap is too close, there is maybe 1 difficulty too much, LFR shouldn't reward gear and normal/HC/mythic should have separate progression paths with obviously different  gear.
---
Gear inflation is a separate and very large issue and obviously I'm not being clear that my opinion is that allowing a simpler way for lower ability players to kill raid bosses isn't automatically a bad thing. But people will obviously have different view points. 
---
I was finishing high school and it lead into college and my life got crazy so I always became an altoholic in the mid 20s. Then I got fed up and resorted to botting to farm xp while I studied in my college library and eventually got bands. I miss my original vanilla account to this day. What a bonehead I was!!
---
hah obvious troll is obvious
---
And a raptor from bloodlord if i recall
---
Yeah but you don't really need to farm those. You get them plenty when doing dungeons.
---
One of those things I'd categorize as "a change I'd actually like", but also "don't implement it, because then you justify other changes."
---
As the raids progress there are fewer and fewer spots for hunters since their dps drops off in comparison to the others are gear gets better. Because in early raids/low gear level groups they do very well, but less so as things progress.
---
Mana pots, by the truckload.
---
I think you can distinguish retail Wow poster because they talk like casino gamblers: this ilevel and the gscore that of the tier 4 of azerite bla will only give you a 4.6% advantage over M+.
---
They don't even look at the game like a Fantasy story, like LOTR, anymore. 
---
The whole point of the raid is that it's like finally going to the Mordor volcano, and facing Sauron, after an epic adventure in other parts of the World.
---
And how much did they make with subs? You need to provide that number as well if you want to draw any conclusions. 
---
Als the number you mentioned includes not only microtransactions from WoW, but also from Candy Crush (absurdly huge market), Hearthstone, Overwatch, Call of Duty, Destiny and all the other games they offer microtransactions for. I hihgly doubt WoW makes more from microtransactions than Hearthstone, Overwatch or Candy Crush. 
---
You don't know how much of those 4 billion is only WoW microtransactions... and even if you knew, you would have to know how much Blizzard did make from subscriptions in 2017 to compare the numbers. If we're guessing 1 million subs (in reality it's definitely more) for 10 bucks a month each (that's also more in reality) we're already at 120 million bucks a year. And as I said, that has to be one of the lowest possible estimates already. 
---
And besides all that, I ask you again why Blizzard should go through the effort of releasing Classic instead of just releasing new microtransactions if they truly were THAT much more lucrative than subscriptions?
---
Still doesn't add up. 
---
I'd love it. Not only do they remove some massive pointless timesinks, the materials for them would be another gold sink which the game could definitely use. Priced high enough that you're not going to summon it for any random 5 man, but make it a raid staple.
---
Most of my BiS pre-raid gear was crafted or from pre-60 dungeons, as I recall. Plenty enough to terrify people doing random WPvP.
---
different time zone, you would never meet them
---
The easy spot to obtain is the one you get by making friends with people during leveling and pre-raid dungeon runs.
---
Top DPS or most efficient tank healer, and you think there are easier classes?
---
* Druid - Innervate and Battle Rez.  Other healers want you.
---
* Hunter - Tranq shot, and if you're an engineer FD + Jumper cables.
---
* Mage - High damage.
---
* Paladin - Best tank healer
---
* Priest - Best overall healer
---
* Rogue - High damage
---
* Shaman - Best AoE healer, good fear-breaker
---
* Warlock - High damage
---
* Warrior - High damage and required tank class
---
I don't think you'll have a problem finding a raid no matter what class you play.
---
With that said, you must be:
---
* Resto Druid
---
* MM hunter (or SV in later tiers)
---
* Fire Mage.  Unless in a fire raid, then Frost Mage
---
* Holy Paladin
---
* Holy Priest
---
* Something rogue (don't know them well)
---
* Resto Shaman
---
* Something warlock
---
* Fury Warrior (for DPS) or Prot Warrior (for tanking)
---
Wait till you get a partner and a couple of kids (if you don't already) - that time will go down even more!
---
&gt;Nothing to do
---
Alts!
---
Go ask this on a pserver subreddit. Classic will have a modern macro engine so we won't be writing these sorts of arcane scripts.
---
Most played class in the game (because they are the only tanks and best dps in the game) and as such much competition, also fury warriors are expected to have tank gear for some fights (e.g. Garr)
---
How long will it take even top-tier players to get leveled and attuned for classic content?  That alone will push it out a few weeks.
---
I also think the people who are level 60 in a week or two are going to by far be the minority.  Lots of players probably won't even start until the initial surge is over and the servers have settled.
---
At the very least it looks like you've got a few syntax errors.
---
    /run local start, duration, enabled = GetSpellCooldown(*Spellbook*); if duration - ( GetTime() - start) &gt; 1.5 then CastSpellByName("Aimed Shot"); end;
---
Try playing around with some debugging.
---
    /run local start, duration, enabled = GetSpellCooldown(*Spellbook*); print(enabled);
---
    /run local start, duration, enabled = GetSpellCooldown(*Spellbook*); if duration - ( GetTime() - start) &gt; 1.5 then print("foo"); else print("bar"); end;
---
There's a **very** good chance that this kind of macro will not work in Classic, so this thread may be better suited for your server's subreddit.
---
But if you're still having problems, PM me and I'll try to find time after work to help. (Like 10-11 hrs from now.)
---
Remember, their arguments already won in our timeline. The end result is 10 of the 12 million subscribers left. I think the 2 million that agreed with them are the ones who stayed. The ones who wanted an RPG? They left. The ones who wanted a community, the ones who wanted challenge, who were interested in a good story and lore, they all left. It's now a casino game for the 2 million junkies that are left.
---
I thought the vast majority of it (at least back in the day) was gold farmers? Usually hunters just grinding mobs for hours (in some Chinese sweatshop at $0.10/hour /s)
---
See this is a great constructive post.  Thank you for your sensibility to this incredibly sensitive topic (to some)
---
Is there any reason why Blizzard wouldnt be able to operate 2 dev teams at the same level of quality?
---
Your forgot the Stockades, but yes Horde side has more low level options
---
Which you get from doing dungeons, in truckloads. Just play the game, no need to farm shit.
---
NElf hunter, but I started in BC not vanilla
---
Finally someone who knows what he is talking about... wanted to say the same
---
It's a casino game, for the same junkies who get addicted to mobile games.
---
I can't say for sure how it was back then, but nowadays it's from hacked accounts. I have some experience in the matter I'm afraid to say.
---
Bullshit. Did mc/bwl on nost and none used flasks, few potions were enough. We werent particulary geared either. Back then people compensated lack of skill with consumables.
---
People need to understand that having a burden and a responsibility was part of what made WoW special. If you’re a mage, your burden is to conjure food and hand deliver it to maybe 4-8 people and those people will remember you and be grateful and build a bond with you.
---
Shaman need to buy Ankhs in case the raid wipes, Druid’s need reagents for battle Rez and GOTW, warriors need to pay outrageous repair fees, etc. That’s the price you pay for the privilege of working together to raid. You only need to look to retail to see what happens when people can treat their group members as little more than AI.
---
If you are winters chill specc'd i'd suggest getting ice barrier over pom, as it helps with farming or pvp, while that one pom per fight wont make a difference as you dps is lower than the others. Just my .02
---
Regarding a lot of the min/maxing stuff we see on private servers ( particularly when it comes to races ) I just don't think it's going to matter that much on classic. Classic is going to be a new ( new-old? ) experience for the overwhelming majority of the playerbase. The extreme min/maxing only exists on private servers because there's nothing better to do when you've been going through the same content for years on every vanilla server that pops up. Full consumable, race/class restricted speed running is not going to be some kind of gold standard, at least for a very long time ( it took quite a while to develop on pservers as well ).
---
realy? where did they say that in german?
---
Haha  i just found this thread i had no idea my discovery of the Air elementals sparked such controversy  its nice to know it reached players beyond mmowned and inspired others to explore. I always loved exploration and would try to inspire other players to join and help me on my travels. Sadly with the introduction of flight i found exploration seemed to die over the course of expansions.  
---
To those explorers still out there remember to climb those peaks and dive those lakes there are discoveries to be made and sometimes its right under everyone's nose.
---

---
But that is farming isn't it? By the time your progressing on Nefarian you really should have your pre-BiS set. But that guild was really bad so it might just be an odd example. 
---
warlocks on alliance are in demand since people don't like to roll them to often because of the Undead racial Will of the Forsaken. and for horde restro shammy's always seem to be welcome
---
Ever met a rogue with cold blood and amush...? Ever duelled an elemental shaman? Be prepared to be amazed...
---
Mounts sure... maybe grind in winterspring. But transmog? yaaaa no.
---
On the contrary, I think a smart business man could read it as the market being ready for a spiritual sequel to WoW, and getting tired of retail. Whoever makes it first and properly might hit the jackpot. In an industry so saturated in every genre, it's funny that there is only one traditional MMORPG, Classic, and the demand is starting to grow again. 
---
Yes the very very small minority of players will clear the content very quickly but the number of people who do that are peanuts compared to retail.
---
4 horsemen, one of the hardest fights in the game and i never saw them myself
---
Many macros that relied upon heavy scripting in vanilla are still doable (and much simpler) with the modern macro system, take your fd + trap macro, it's literally just:
---
    /cast [combat] Feign Death; Freezing Trap
---
Another example are the enable autoattack that melee classes like to add to their attacks, that's just simply
---
     /startattack
---
     /cast Sinister Strike
---
You still have responsibilities here, just like buying ankhs you'd need to buy materials components to cast foot tables and soul wells. You are right that it does remove a point of contact between players, but not completely. You'll still want to get new health stones and might need to top off food and water, and it would be cost prohibitive to just spam these abilities.
---
It wasn´t modern Retail community that asked for QoL changes back in Vanilla/TBC/WotLK.
---
And don´t pretend that people didn´t care about cosmetic stuff back then. And no, it wasn´t just because it was rare, it´s because people like cosmetics in their games.
---
just a thought, but if you want to be more or less untouchable, I'd go for mobility (and maybe the 29 bracket). so, the classes that come into mind:
---
- druid, travel/cat form
---
- shaman, ghost wolf
---
- hunter, aspect of the cheetah
---
paladins, rogues and mages should also work, though less effective.
---
no idea how or even IF druid twinks would work, but these classes should make short work of WSG matches and be able to completely dominate AB.
---
Tfw you are a slave of WoW economy. Please god spare us from inflation. Lol really.
---
Haha but what happens to wow actually also happens in the food industry. 
---
Does wagyu beef taste worse because it was filled with substitutes and watered down to a % of actual beef so everyone could afford to it?
---
The answer is yes. 
---
The opposite actually, usually me and a nother traveling to the stone while 3rd member of the grp stayed SW to get the last members...
---
For a casual player I think the stone can save som time doing dungeons etc... 
---
didn`t know feint death freezing trap is one thats still possible. good to hear. t4i
---
I did not went past BWL, so I all raid bosses in AQ40 and Naxx are on my list.
---
But stick them with 4x frost mage and watch the tanks crap themselves
---
The real vanilla experience is having a level 17 right above your raid geared level 60.
---
It's a bit of a shame, but I think it'll still be OK. Outside of the hunter FD/trap macro, the only other "necessary" macro I can think of is the warlock drain soul macro, which I think should still work with the new system. Most of the other ones I can think of will either obviously still work, or were relatively minor QoL macros that won't be terrible to do without.
---
Except again, wotf is a big deal and not min/maxing. Doesn’t make you any less wrong. Why go out of your way to provide commentary on a game you’ve never played? Weird. 
---
Yikes, sorry to hear that, hope you got it all back.
---
You can combine any ammount of spells that are not in the GCD together, so FD+Freezing Trap is able to be cast.
---
Same thing as PoM+Pyro etc...
---
Actually the only things we won't be able to do are basically "bot-like" things like autoatic targeting the person with the least HP, or the person with a curse, etc...
---
On the other hand, we'll have mouseover, focus, @party1 macros etc and this will make combat much more dynamic.
---
Yea, I always wanted the Raptor mount because an undead on a raptor = one of the most badass things ever. 
---
Finally got that wish in patch 2.0 when the PvP Mounts became available for essentially everyone. 
---
They will follow the streamer around, converting trade chat into twitch chat, zerging the area wherever they go, bottlenecking the server, just a few things that suddenly came to my head why you're wrong about that.
---
Yeah IMO classic WoW was a sweet spot. The only thing I miss from pre-2004 MMOs is the true "sandbox" style like SWG had. 
---
RFC is the only one that Alliance can't easily do, though. WC has several neutral quests, SFK has a part of the paladin class quest, RFK has only neutral quests, and RFD has neutral quests and one Alliance exclusive quest. If anything, Alliance has more as Deadmines and Stockades have only Alliance quests.
---
Last I heard many of them were talking about PVE being their choice due to all the ganking they'd get. 
---
You're taking his comments way, way too seriously, overanalyzing and drawing parallels that don't make any logical sense and getting upvoted for it. This subreddit is nuts.
---
Depends. If you are a warrior, then you don't have to wait and spend days trying to get your Hand of Justice and other things before the zerg, but if you do have a couple people to do it with, then you should do it. As a warrior, I will probably roll a mage or hunter alt for gold farming once I hit 60 with the warrior and maybe do a bit of things. I would be happy to have this done in the first month.
---
**checking my watch** (yeah we wore watchs back in 2005)
---
"Shit its almost EST raiding time....time to login and put mana/health pots on the AH for 5x what they go for normally because of lazy last minute people logging in before raids."
---
I don't get why it should be sad. Other people do whatever they want. Back in Vanilla raids were also cleared rather quickly by the top guilds. Then what? It does not really affect your gameplay as far as I know, right?
---
Farming dungeons for consumes is farming, btw. 
---
Well, some like to change the behaviour of it and need a macro. For example if you wanna be able to spam it without turning it off again. Also hunters might want one that can be spammed like that and both have ranged and melee. This way you got something to spam when an enemy is in the dead zone and as soon as they get either far enough away for ranged or close enough for melee AA starts.
---
I remember reading in a magazine all the way back to the closed beta days that the Alliance zones had a lot more polish. I think it makes sense for the Horde at the time of vanilla to be a lot less established, it probably attracts a different subset of players.
---
I hope, it's just that the development costs are so high that the only ones who can safely release an MMORPG are the billion dollar companies. There's so many indie MMORPGs that are stuck in pre-alpha/alpha seemingly forever.
---
I tanked MC for my guild for a long time, until we were beyond that and were gearing up some new tanks and I went on my mage, never realized how awesome that fight looks until I was at range, for the tank its just firecrotch. Infact, most fights are crotch. Geez, price in Kara was the worst, just giant purple crotch.
---
Female human paladin named Europea
---
for some reason i got LW/Skining 
---
I generally agree with what you said (most of my disagreements probably come down to personal opinion), but I do take absolute issue with one:
---
&gt;The mage PVE spec is flat out awful in PVP.
---
Just not true.  Frost spec is extremely viable in PvP - your role just changes.  True, you lose controllable burst.  But in exchange, you get massive increases in survivability and utility.  And it's not like you lose burst entirely - you still have Shatter.  It's just not a bit more fickle and the top end isn't as high.  But when the stars align, you can still churn out some incredible burst damage.
---
Hi, /u/Sirka99
---
You don’t need to buy gold when you play 12 hours a day lol 
---
In all of my time playing private servers I've never gotten a "truckload" of mana pots from dungeons, curious which 5 mans drop them like crazy.
---
I absolutely needed to farm as a healer for raid consumables. My guild had a spreadsheet of all the required consumables and the amount of them that everyone had to have in their bank.
---
You might get away with only a couple of stacks of mana potions in MC but in the later raids unless you're in a really casual guild, most decent guilds require everyone to have consumables.
---
Also when AQ and Naxxramas come out most of the people in my guild farmed 2000-3000g worth of consumables before the raids were even released, and that includes healers.
---
None of the people I know on private servers that raided end game said that they never farmed anything or needed consumables, in fact most of them farmed for gold weeks or even months to keep buying them.
---
But again this applies to the more decent guilds and the people raiding in them, if you're in a very casual guild you might have more leeway with it.
---
I still don't think it's good to make a general statement that you don't need to farm shit as a healer, it's only true if you're in a guild that wants to progress very slowly.
---
Not overanalyzing anything. It's exactly the sort of comment that gains traction and is then parroted over the subreddit when it has no  basis in reality. Now you're here defending the guy because I'm taking this way too seriously, but why shouldn't I take it seriously? If someone is talking out of their ass and not being serious, then he's free from criticism or rebuttals? What world are you living in? "lul why u so serious m8" is the only thing I've gotten as a response. I could ignore him talking out of his ass and I could ignore you for stepping up for some randy on the internet, but where's the fun in that? 
---
It makes the game easier -&gt; therefore, the answer is NO.
---
22 sept., the last summer day? What?
---
Nice.
---
To be honest I think that an ability to create macro which will do these 3 actions (Pet Passive, Feign Death, Put Trap) instantaneously on a single button is a bit too much. So far what we can do is just wait for more information to pop up. 
---
Hope they are going to put enough effort in the anti-cheat system to prevent some quirky software from accessing the full LUA. 
---
Never thought of BFD and SFK as horde dungeons.
---
&gt;You can have garbage gear but if you don't let anyone in your 5 man die and don't need to drink a single time, they're going to remember that and you're going to get invited again. In classic, people friend good tanks and healers so they can run stuff. 
---
Unless they don't give you the chance to prove yourself because you are "not geared enough".
---
Honestly, if this becomes a thing in my server, I will try to rage on Blizzard forums along with all the other people will do so, and if after a few weeks they've not found a solution, I will quit Classic for good.
---
I think the reason one might be able to deem them "hard" to level is because they have no heals.  Warriors have the same issue of course, but Warriors they can get Blood Craze and Bloodthirst.
---
Unless my memory is failing me, Rogues don't have any comparable abilities/talents.
---
&gt;They have a bad wrap because
---
Rep. As in, reputation. 
---
On the most recently launched popular pserver the first bosskills (Ony and MC) were logged about a week after launch, so thats leveling, attunements e.t.c. in a week. So yeah, maybe my week 1 is a bit optimistic (although i do feel that on Classic launch the hardcore will go ever more hardcore), but i don't have alot of hope that week 2 all content will not be cleared. 
---
And sure the ppl that go hard are a minority, thats the same on retail though.
---
Wot ken ah doo fer ye tadae?
---
Druids are well known for being excellent 1v1, since their kit is so massive. They aren't great (and arguably pretty bad) outside of 1v1 duels though, and are very gear/spec dependent, as well as being very high skill cap. 
---
However, with things like engineering and consumables, it's hard to say that there's *one* pvp king.
---
Paraphrasing an explicit statement from Blizzard has no basis in reality. Okay dude.
---
&gt;it's on life support because of dogshit treadmill features like artifact power and world quests, the destruction of community by allowing LFG and LFR to be cross realm, the over simplified talents and speccs
---
But all of this has been the case in Legion, which retailers gobbled up and hold up as one of the best expansions ever.
---
Then you're stuck being some edgelord zombie, whose lore makes it retarded for them to be Light-wielding healers, or a Troll, who look terrible in cloth and have the worst race design in the game for their females who look like elvish cosplayers instead of their own species. 
---
Rogues are easy to level. Other then that this is full of truth. There are gonna be a lot of really fucking salty max level rogues. Who realize that by patch 1.12.1 rogues are relative poop who literally need every cool down they have just to potentially win.
---
The big shocker for people is going to be the humble shadow priest. They'll be in bg's created corpse fields.
---
I agree with you on BFD, which is why I listed it as an alliance dungeon as well in my post. I consider it pretty neutral. SFK is pretty clear cut horde imo 
---
First day of Autumn is September 23rd.
---
I want to roll on a PVE server. I'm just worried that Oceanic wont support to many servers. I hope they don't die out.
---
Ok real talk time. People always shit on LOTR for the eagles not flying Frodo and Sam to the mountain. The eagles have no reason in the story to do this, but put that aside for now.
---
Why doesn’t the elf dude just stab this fucker when he isn’t looking and just push his body in? Or cut his hand off and just punt that thing. He doesn’t have to touch the ring, saves the world, and probably doesn’t even kill the guy. This still bothers me to this day and I never won’t be mad about it.
---
Support DPS was the concept which Blizzard tried to implement in the very first iterations of game, sadly with little success, because there is always someone which does the same thing better and your combined supportive efforts don't sum up that efficiently.
---
Blessings, Healing, Bubbles are paladin baseline abilities, but on top of that you are a top-tier healer instead of mediocre DPS if you're holy. You can swing Nightfall as holy with the same success rate (But generally Nightfall works best on an Off-tank). On top of that most likely you are going to use Sanctity aura for +10% damage which only profits you, instead of Concentration or Resistance auras. 
---
Yea, a totem that can be your #1 source of damage with good RNG is pretty shit. You're right.
---
yes, it will be a minority, compared to retail i don't know though. Not alot of ppl are clearing the hardest raids very fast in retail either. And i'm expecting quite a few players to go pretty hardcore in Classic to be fair. 
---
Well maybe they do, I dont spend much time on this sub. But it is something nonetheless interesting. 
---
I think it will also make a difference that people have done a different version of Naxx in Wrath. Much harder and some different mechanics, but at least people have a general idea of what’s going on. I remember back in the day going in to Naxx and all I had to go on was some MS Paint diagrams done by guildies and videos in the crappiest quality imaginable.
---
I suppose part of my reasoning is the number of alliance starting zones with no dungeons. If you consider that redridge, duskwood, loch modan and wetlands have no dungeons it helps make my point. On the horde side you have 3 dungeons in barrens, one in silver pine, one in ashenvale (neutral BFD)... only horde “starting” zone without one is stonetalon.
---
One nice thing about vanilla is that you can theoretically run every dungeon as either faction, but some dungeons are clearly easier and have better rewards to run as one faction over the other
---
Bro you are being generous. As a Druid you weren't forced to be the healer. Shit man that woulda even been fine. No your pathetic dopey ass was there to throw innervate at the real healers lol. 
---
Even before megaservers it had overflow servers, if there were too many people in a zone you got pushed into the overflow together with people from other servers.
---
Median XL Sigma drops Friday, updated Diablo 2 engine, it's going to be amazing. 
---
But I'm not talking about raid content.  I'm talking about what your average player has available as useful content past level cap.  In Vanilla, there were lots of things to work for, which would represent different power increases (epic mount, hard-to-earn gear, atunements, reputations, farming consumables, etc).  It's all mission oriented.
---
With live, you hit level cap, and quickly get geared from LFG to the point where you are just farming Artifact Power and then raiding.  Everything you do outside of the raid is to farm AP.  And it quickly gets old.
---
I think the saving grace of legion was that it was tied to a strong story that had its major conclusion, recognisable weapons that added back some class complexity and interesting questing.
---
I really enjoyed questing in drustrav, pretty much anything else is not worth the time in BFA, it's all so very pointless. 
---
From a story point of view legion was the conclusion of a 20 year campaign against the burning legion. BFA feels recycled story wise, coupled with shitty never ending systems that progress stuff you don't care about (I cared about my class of ursoc) with raids that no one really recognises, classes and talents that were pruned too in earlier expansion and felt somewhat invigorated in legion thanks to artifacts. 
---
And legion came after the steam turd that was WoD so ofc it looked better - it has some content or one.
---
If someone asked me for a list of how to fix wow, removing lfr wouldn't be in it, however changing its rewards and making it not xrealm would be fairly high up. Just because I want to give people the access to see the conclusions of story lines doesn't mean I think the reward should be comparable to each other.
---
Xrealm, titanforging, summon stones, class simplification, talent simplification and progression balance between game difficulties could go a long way to fixing wow. Maybe raids wouldnt have to be so easy if leveling wasn't a joke and 5 mans had little to no difficulty changes from one to the other. Or maybe raids only need 1 difficulty if the story could be wrapped up outside of them so we wouldn't need a tourist mode?
---
Blizzard:
---
&gt; We are very confident that all active "WoW" subscribers will be able to travel to "Classic" from the summer of 2019.
---
That guy: 
---
&gt;It doesn't tell much, but that they're confident **could indicate a launch early summer.**
---
I was the one paraphrasing to clarify what Blizzard really mean with their corporate speak. He interpreted the sentence and inferred that Blizzard could release Classic early summer due to the word 'confident,' despite the fact that Blizzard sticks to what they've been saying since Blizzcon: Summer 2019. Not late summer, not early summer, not midsummer. The guy answering questions hasn't been given clearance to speak about the release with more detail, so why shouldn't I correct some guy who infers something that clearly isn't there? Could it be released early summer? Sure, but that's not what the Blizzard representative is saying, and that's all I'm saying.
---
Yea let me know how good your damage is when you're dead on the ground cus you pulled off tank
---
Well then for their sakes hopefully the realm list with have the updated low, medium, high, full words next to it.
---
Though you can't account for accidentally getting into a more touristy realm for it to only die a month or 2 in. 
---
And there won't be cross realm play for them this time around. 
---
But they might hear word on the retail servers, if they are playing active, and go with their friends or guild choices.
---
Back in Vanilla raids weren't really cleared fast, the pace was a lot slower, even between the top guilds. Now i am from EU, but iirc MC was in at launch in US. First Lucifron kill was around 2 months after release (20-1-2005), first Rag kill was not untill 25-4-2005. Onyxia was killed 28-1-2005.
---
BWL was faster than MC, but Nefarian still lived for 77 days. C'thun was "bugged / overtuned", so could have been killed earlier if he was fixed earlier but lived for 113 days, Ouro even lived a day longer. And Kel'thuzzad lived for 90 days. 
---
Thanks for bolding the relevant part of the other dudes quote for me, "could indicate". You're really going off the rails and out of context simply for the sake of arguing.
---
Just avoid any server with a popular streamer 
---
&gt; when everyone has naxx gear
---
That have never happened ever... Not even on private servers with hardcore players will anyone but a tiny minority even set their foot in naxx.
---
Lol they already operate multiple dev teams to varying degrees of quality.
---
I created a Tauren Warrior, got him to level 14, on my uncles computer when i was visiting, needless to say he encouraged me to buy my own computer and get my own game, because I was taking all of his computer time. I think i called him Khangestan or something like that, was in classic days of course.
---
What private server ever lasts long enough for that to happen though? Blizzard wont be shutting down classic so even if it takes 4 years it will eventually happen on the launch servers don't you think?
---
And you're incapable of arguing properly, so why are you doing it? For the sake of arguing, I'd wager? 
---
"Going off the rails and out of context," how about you counter what I'm saying instead of deflecting? 
---
This is a good argument for reagent costs (which I agree with). But doesn't really address the idea of repeating the same function way too many times
---
For some reason there aren't a ton of crazy hunter pvp videos like there are for warriors/rogues/mages. I mean, a good hunter is a good hunter though. Check out this:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O4FA16PU44
---
Hunters fall off for PvE content since their damage scaling is low, and aren't great in PvP battlegrounds due to low CC and mediocre burst damage. But for world pvp and 1v1s? That's a different story.
---
The grind is significantly longer in vanilla than retail, while the content is more difficult in retail people can access the content quicker and without a grind before hand (world buffs, potions etc.). 
---
The normies clear raids very slowly in vanilla, if private servers show us anything, not to mention you have a much slower gearing process and shit like attunement quests that can be long.
---
The dude said "They could be releasing the game early summer" and you started attacking him. What is there to counter? You're just being childish and refusing to understand that you're arguing an OPINION.
---
Some people seem to talk like they've gotta find a new raid slot each day.
---
I don't get it.
---
Even if you're playing the most over represented class/spec or hell, even if you're playing something like a booking, you only need to find that slot one.
---
Sure, maybe it'll take more that your first message to get an invite but it's really not a challenge worth any note.
---
I look forward to modern macros in Classic. You can use an addon anyway that makes the same thing so it has no effect on gameplay. You just have to use one less addon.
---
Comments like the one below perhaps?  I know he was replying to the OP, but he replied to everyone with the same "i was awesome, but I am fine with WoW having training wheels for people with lesser skill, their rewards don't threaten me at all, and if you dont agree with me you're a dick attitude.  IE  signalling his virtue. 
---
"Snapunhappy &gt; Why do you give a shit about other people seeing it? Does it make you feel special to see something only because you know other people cant? what a fucking horrible personality trait you have there.
---
&gt; Haha fucking crying downvotes because people know i'm right: name me one experience that feels better by virtue of it being limited without sounding like an asshole. If you feel better only by excluding others you're a dick"
---
But hey, I feel I am getting off topic here, maybe I mis-read it, but sometimes things sound like they sound.
---
Bottom line for me on this topic, current wow is dogshit and this video says it perfectly, things need to go back to the way they were.
---
i havent been looking super hard, just chillin atm and seeing what happens.  are you starting one or have one already?
---
That's the shit I subbed for
---
I think I might be missing come content here. Are you saying this about elemental or enhance shammies. If it's enhance how in the sam hell can an enhance kill a mage? Not arguing just asking.
---
Go rogue or mage lots of CC, stealth etc
---
The first character I created was a Dwarf Paladin
---
I remember POURING through the game manual and deciding I'd play paladin because I could wear all types of armor, use most all the weapons, and be able to do all of the roles. I loved the idea of having choices and not locked into one specific role or playstyle. 
---
I was wrong. Leveling sucked and I essentially just spammed rank 4 flash of light on the MT for hours at a time, 
---
I'd do it again in a heartbeat
---
Isildur and Elrond weren't in the cracks of doom in the books; if Elrond tried to take the Ring by force or by killing Isildur than it would have driven Isildur mad and either way would have turned Isildur's Kingdom (which is much stronger than what it is at the end of the third age) against the elves who already had great casualties fighting against Sauron. Elrond didn't know that Sauron would be able to rise again for sure and the elven lords suspected that the destruction of the One Ring might cause the Three Rings to lose their power. 
---
Elrond would've risked turning all the men against him and having the Three Rings lose their power just for a chance at being able to destroy the One Ring when it might've not mattered in the end anyway. This is all without even considering the fact that the One might have taken control of Elrond too if he had been able to take it from Isildur.
---
I understand your point. However, I used them to write the analysis and to highlight something most don't really even notice. Thanks for watching
---
Rogue is nice because of stoneform. And there's always priest ;)
---
I didn't say you should farm dungeons. Just do them like you normally would and you'll get mana potions as a bonus.
---
Rogue may be a good class due to being able to slink around undetected as well as for being able to escape easily.
---
Every class is easy or hard I’m its own way so don’t let any perception color your judgment. Try a few things and figure out if they are fun and go from there.
---
What is a better metric to determine whether or not a player is suitable to join a group?
---
Ilvl is generally a quick and easy method of evaluation, although in vanilla I don't think ilvl shows the quality of an item in the same way it does in bfa. Lots of lower ilvl items can be very strong due to having hit chance on them. 
---
The problem is if groups are trying to pug 40 man raids they're going to want an easy method of making up the group so I won't be surprised if they do just check ilvl. 
---
Now is the time to come up with other useful alternatives so they can be popularized on release. 
---
Convenience doesn't make a game more fun.
---
Attacking him? What the fuck are you on about? 
---
He infers and poses it as a real possibility given the wording, I correct him and he gets defensive, and then you jump in like a knight in shining armour because I correct some defensive dude on the internet. There's no intentional ignorance or misunderstanding, he inferred something that isn't there, I tell him the facts, which is, there's no real way of knowing because they aren't telling us yet.
---
But keep on going, give me more clichés like how fun I am at parties.
---
I did dungeons through all of vanilla because it was fun and I was in the top guild on my server. I never farmed them I just did them when I was in the mood and wanted to do something fun with my friends.
---
That video was pretty cool thanks
---
You only need to find a raid slot once. It's not like you'd need to find a new one for every raid.
---
So don't stress about trying to find a slot.
---
Even if you joined late, people drop out of the game all the time due to things like burn out or RL commitments.    
---
So slots open up all the time, even in older guilds.
---
Are classic mages anything like retail? Ive tried mages during wod and kinda hated it. 
---
&gt; I'm curious which dungeons drop a "truckload" of mana potions because I've never seen that myself.
---
I also know from personal experience that this is complete bogus. No one who has raided end game would say that running a couple of 5 mans for mana pots is adequate.
---
I play a healer myself and getting away without farming is not true in the slightest. Probably only applies if you're in a very casual guild which doesn't mind progressing very slowly or maybe not at all.
---
Most healer druids don't go furor from my experience. 3 more stats to the entire raid is a lot.
---
&gt; knight in shining armour
---
&gt; give me more clichés
---
I'm just gonna point out the irony and then leave you alone because you clearly aren't listening or interested in having an actual conversation. The double layered irony in you believing that your opinion is a fact while ragging on another person for having an opinion is pretty funny though.
---
Same idea but simplified, it's about learning different scenarios. For example you blink before a warrior uses intercept, he's probably going to global you when he does.
---
It really depends on how you choose to spend your mana. If you heal your assigned targets smart to avoid overhealing you won't need mana potions on most fights. If you're constantly spamming heals then yes, you'll have to chug a lot of mana potions.
---
BUT the bag comes with some attack speed, so at least you gain a little bonus for the lost bag space.
---
Also: Priests, Locks, and Mages can use ammo bags to increase their wanding speed.
---
Vanilla, Gnome Warlock, friend's account exposed me to the game.  
---
About a year later, finally had my own account; it was the original reason that I got a credit card, so that I could subscribe.
---
Human female, Warlock.
---
Didn't make another toon until TBC, not even a bank toon, just loved that Warlock so dang much.
---
It's a 2 minute cooldown
---
It lasts 5 seconds.
---
That's a 4.1% uptime on any undead you happen to face.
---
According to the demographics survey, 39% of horde players will be undead.
---
So, factoring in cooldown, duration, and chances of encountering someone with it... it's present for 1.6% of pvp as an alliance warlock.
---
Perhaps our definitions of "big deal" vary slightly, but 1.6% definitely doesn't qualify as a big deal to me.
---
Nope. People are delusional if they think the natural order will end up in everyone having Naxx Gear.
---
People shit on Classic all the time as being easy, but it really isn’t for the average player. The average player isn’t that good and can be carried in some dungeons, but not Naxx.
---
Alright then, have a good one.
---
TBH, Lucifron and the core hound trash that we wiped to for hours when first attempting MC all those years ago. 
---
I am enjoying your iron man youtube series, good luck with the mage. Also I recommended to avoid silverpine so you do not get oneshot by the patrolling sons of Arugal(unless you want a fun challenge)
---
Please see my above comment as it did not reply to you properly.
---
as someone whos leveled every class to 60 at least once, I can confirm rogue leveling is faster than shama  and pally. although not necessarily easier
---
First was an undead rogue, but ditched him for a troll rogue. This was back when the game  first  came out and the first batch of servers  were overcrowded, especially if you were a fool like me and ended up on archimonde. When the next batch of servers came out i jumped ship and race swapped. 
---
True story. I had a Ret paladin alt in WOTLK AFTER they got nerfed on Haomarush I believe and used to beat people in duels with no weapon in my hand in the 1850 gear. I got the rating with an elemental shaman who had never played Arena before.
---
For BG's Arcane was also broken AF. First it was broken with shatter. Then it was broken with deep arcane It was the first time since Vanilla I can remember being able to really destroy a healer fast and it was mainly spamming one button with a slow on for torment of the weak. It was so dumb.
---
This was the start of WOTLK on mage. The funny thing is people were losing their minds about DK's and I was just running around one shotting people lol.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FFITWbUu3M
---
I will say that SL/SL in TBC was the least fun thing to ever fight against though. Not so much as broken OP (could read a book in the time it took to kill you) as it was just stupid. 
---
Human warlock. Probably because my older bro was a gnome warlock. I was real young.
---
Also you need to practice dwarf running. It looks easy but it ain't. Belly always forward so you're ready to Charge any second. 
---
I just have to say, I enjoy reading how upset it makes you that people have vanity and enjoy even more how you don't see how vain you are yourself. 
---
I hope one day you gain some self-perception 
---
During the Stresstest I did create a female Troll Priest, because I wanted to test something I was 100% not going to play, but was surprised how awesome that character was.
---
Totally forgot about her, when I did get my account back a couple of months ago, I saw that I had recreated her on  and all those memories came back.
---
Can't believe I forgot about her. :(
---
I think it was stated in the making of wow that the alliance area were created first, it's why you see that polish and they feel lived in. Like with SW and NPCs walking around and kids playing.  But by time they were finishing the horde areas they were getting into their release schedule and just didn't get to the polishing.
---
Gnome warrior on Ursin. Named Buttahead.
---
Sartura.
---
The first boss, where Rogues actually had some sort of responsibility.
---
That's why she became my favorite.
---
I was just thinking how amazing these movies have been to memes and internet quotes.
---
Not only are these movies a big part of my childhood, they still give us joy through new use.
---
Also this game that we love, vanilla, might have benefitted hugely from the lotr leading to me writing here now. (Also never invite a nelf hunter named after Legolas)
---
I guess that's true. It seems to be the same way on private servers too though. Most people play for the rewards rather than for fun, myself included unfortunately. I could spend an hour in this Strath run but I'd make three times the gold just by running around farming herbs. 
---
But you’d only do dungeons for pre-bis? Once that’s achieved then you’d only run certain dungeons for runes/orbs/pots, etc. 
---
&gt; What private server ever lasts long enough for that to happen though? 
---
Nostalrius and many other. Private servers doesnt close (usually) they merge. I can still log in and play from all my characters since 2015 and raid naxx if I wanted to, but fresh have been more fun.
---
they would have massive security issues using the original client.
---
Troll Hunter in closed beta.
---
Just do dungeons even if you dont need anything from there 4Head, play the game 4Head
---
Legion introduced *and* finished off Sargeras and Argus in one single content patch. It had Illidan on the cover, it had a random ass vrykul zone for the wrath nostalgia, and the Nightborne were Ctrl+C "Sin'Dorei" Ctrl+V. I tried reading up Legion's story and no matter how much I read it all sounds like random shit happening with little correlation to anything. If that's what goes for a strong story on retail, I'll have to adjust my image of retail players a bit.
---
It does because I get to spend more time playing the game instead of doing pointless shit.
---
The 3 classes you choose from are all great with their skill floor and ceilings and pvp advantages.
---
I would probably go combat rogue as the most straight forward class.
---
As world of roguecraft put it, you only NEED 2 buttons when fighting most players.
---
WR speed run to 60 is 4 days 20 hours, nothing is getting cleared week 1... MAYBE week 2 but even that is pushing it
---
Specifically stated as "tied to your retail sub". So if you have an active subscription, you have unlimited retail and classic.
---
So let's say you are right and not everyone has naxx gear its fair to say that atleast 1 of each class will eventually end up with full naxx gear then. I am not interested in how attainable it is I am curious as to how things play out in that scenario. 
---
Some people say that hunter is fine at that point but others say that due to how poorly they scale and how well classes like warrior and rogues scale they basically become gods.
---
My mage that I still play till this day has come through every expansion, It was originally called "Crazyjelly" Awful i know.
---
It has changed race and name since then.
---
https://youtu.be/alH2QXm8MM8
---
Tinklepants the UD Lock
---
Ah, shame, but that would actually make perfect sense.
---
The hunter scaling issues are related to raid pve performance. If your primary issue is pvp, don't worry about it.
---
I still fail to see the point. How does that affect you?
---
Considering that on the last released big pserver the first kills came in at around 7 days, week 1 Ony / Rag kills are not that far off, if ppl go more hardcore come Classic it might be possible, altough it also might be a little optimistic as i already said. Early week 2 there everything was dead on that pserver.   
---
&gt; Blizzard flat out said this was their design intention with paladins. Enhance is the same deal. You are "op" with near zero learning curve in many situations for 2/3rd of Vanilla WoW in easily gotten gear. The victim complex, especially with rets needs to stop. Enhance Shamans for some reason aren't as delusional.
---
Devs also admitted specs being that inbalanced for PvE wasn't intended.
---
&gt;That was the cost of making hybrid heal specs DPS viable. A MASSIVE Multiplayer Online RPG became less massive.
---
Source for that? 
---
I agree with almost all of the points he makes but in no way is this concise or straightforward. It's a very long-winded rant and I could easily see how the points would be lost on someone who doesn't already agree with him. I already agreed with these points before watching the video but had to turn it off after about 9 minutes
---
If you're coming at it from a retail standpoint sure. Back in vanilla we did content because it was fun, not because everything was about gear, gear and more gear.
---
That's why gold sellers exist
---
Is this USA only?
---
Human female Rogue named Natalya made on bro's account. First friend I made was a Human pally named Oriel (or something like that). 
---
Quickly got my own account, in part to avoid Oriel who it turned out was batshit crazy. 
---
I'm playing all the same things! 
---
True, though I look at current sim tools that are becoming easier and easier to use, and I feel like there's a way for people to score how much of you're classes optimal gear you have, and assign that a score. Might not be there now, but I can see it being developed. 
---
I would never have players like that in my guild. I want to experience vanilla as close as possible to how it was 14 years ago. If you're trying to play it like you would play retail I'd kick you from the guild rather than have you sour the experience for everyone else.
---
And by 'you' I don't mean you specifically but a general 'you'.
---
Omg I can't wait anymore:(... 
---
This is the attitude that will kill classic
---
And even in recent expansions old raid trinkets were BiS over higher iLvL items. Yet iLvL was still a general metric used to measure player power, and thus buying entry into a raid. People would carry "iLvL" sets to trick LFG leaders, and then swap into their actual gear that had better throughput. 
---
I think rogues can beat SL Locks with Serenity to remove soul link.
---
This is what retail players will have a hard time adjusting too. Sometimes you do things because they're fun, not because of gear.
---
Well I'm thinking about Rogue, Priest (tho I'm not sure if I want to heal tbh haha) and Warrior
---
When I ran ZG pugs on nost I sure as shit inspected every single person I invited. I didn't want shitters in my run with terrible gear that would slow down the run because they most likely don't know how to do the raid.
---
SL WL can be beaten by Rogue w/ Serenity
---
Netherwing or Lightshope server
---
Undeads and Trolls are awesome. And Trolls are actually the elves' ancestrals, so it's not a cosplay.
---
Basically, the aftermaths ; short ranged Vs long ranged view.
---
Thanks for the resume :D
---
I got into wow sometime after launch, but before most guilds had Ragnaros on farm. I made an orc rogue and got him to around level 10 I think. But he died somewhere in Org looking for an RFC group when I realized I didn't want an orc rogue anymore. So he was deleted and I rerolled an UD rogue.
---
Okay, okay.
---
Even with the fact that you're Alliance, I'm gonna give it to you.  
---
Props.
---
Let me ask, is your wife a NE druid by chance, one of those jumpy ones?  /s
---
Tauren hunter. Didn’t make it past lvl 20 I think
---
yes, why? Mankrik's one was green
---
Very little people that 'gearscore' (itemlevel) is pretty bad in retail, specially at the start till about half way through legion ilvl meant pretty much nothing. It will be a thing no matter if you, i or jim from down the road like it. 
---
Dire Maul Tribute run usually drops some nice mana pots.
---
Just make sure the huntard in your group doesn't ninja them.
---
Holy Priest I guess?
---
8:30am GMT.
---
I think its good that it is tied into your normal sub. If it was $60 to play, I don't think as many people would try it out. Current WoW players will try Classic during content droughts and might get hooked. Or they will switch back and forth as content in retail goes up and down. If it was $60, a lot of those people probably wouldn't bother.
---
12 hours a day is the norm at the level of hardcore world first players. Ya think they weren't busy min-maxing, theorycrafting, testing raids etc. (baring in mind BWL wasn't tested but anything including and past ZG was). 
---
Gold buyung was definitely a thing in their scene.
---
I agree that one of the biggest mistakes that people make with Ret Paladin's in regards to raiding is expecting to have strong or even "decent" dps.
---
The guild I am a part of - our raid leader and myself spent a good while theorising and discussing what role a ret could provide within a raid.
---
Any ret's basically become dedicated cleansers and BoW maintainers. They supplement the rest of the raid allowing them greater output.
---
They are placed with the Main tank particularly to allow in our case we intended to run two in the initial launch experiments to allow for a buffed up MT and two people that can easily dump their mana for lay on hands.
---
And back in Vanilla, it was HORRIBLE when "Something Awful" created a guild on one of the servers and started to play / raid.
---
Warrior - any
---
It was consumables used only in duels that was generally frowned on.    Mini-pay-to-win type issue.
---
What would be the downside of allowing server sign up maybe 2-3 weeks in advance? Have the realm list with a periodically updated faction balance. Pick your realm and name hit accept and wait til launch. If you find out you’re on a pvp server with streamers then delete your character name from that realm and sign up for another. 
---
Maybe I’m missing why this wouldn’t work but don’t recall a discussion on this possibility. 
---
if you're complaining about spell batching you're a god damn retard.
---
OH my god my one in a million pointless PvP scenarios that mean nothing won't occur!?
---
Never understood why people are bothered paying a few bucks/month for a great game with continued support that actually represents a fun hobby while most waste much more money on actual nonsense without giving it the slightest thought.
---
Maybe they were asked not to ask about it
---
I thought they didn't have focus targets in vanilla wow.
---
I think you are cherry picking there, the expansion could have been stretched over two expansions but then you would be giving retail shit for reusing and dragging out content.not every zone has to be directly related to the main storyline, stormhiem had an interesting questline building up sylvanas and her lust for power through capturing Eyir and her Valkyr in order to extend her own life and allow her to raise more forsaken, only stopped by graymanes personal vendetta against her for the death of his son. While not directly relevant to the main legion storyline when playboy it definitely felt like something sylvanas would try to achieve and something genn would like to stop. You can argue that there being a vykrul zone in the broken isle  yet no mention of them being  there when we found them in  wrath and for answers to that I'd be grasping at straws, but for the decision that were made (wrath nostalgia, lack of inspiration) the writing was better than that of other expansions. 
---
Suramar remains one of my favourite zone purely for its story development of the expansion, I wish all zones were like that over the course of content patches - no expansion before or since has had this and I doubt it will again because it's a lot of effort for 'complete' zones.
---
Legion is widely regarded as one of the best expansion for storyline content, try playing it from start to finish, read the quests.
---
Reddit.com/r/wow/comments/809tcf/tldr_legion_lore/
---
Is a fairly ok tldr, but playing the storyline makes it feel a lot more conjoined than just telling it, there are less abrubt end and dungeons, raids and the order hall storyline fill in some other gaps.
---
But it's ok to not like anything blizzard have done after wrath, or tbc, or vanilla or wc3.
---
Thank you!
---
ty bud ;)
---
LOL that's the fastest fucking one way ticket to never getting in a guild or getting a group again.
---
You know they have an addon on private servers for group forming that literally everyone uses that has a blacklist on it??
---
You would be tagged faster than you can say sweet bippy if you snagged an item you didn't need and went NOW FOHKIN PAY ME BITCH.
---
Ok about meditation, had it been 30% I might have considered it. The thing with pvp gear is that usually people stack for “intensity” e.g. power, and stamina, and intellect also counts as “intensity” to a point, because you want to cast your most powerful spells as fast as possible for maximum healing/damage output. If you die with some mana left, some int/spi gear shoud be swappped for stamina...
---
What you are talking about is an attrition fight situation. I think it became more a thing in TBC due to resto druids, resilience and arenas.
---
However, I suppose horde is more bursty and ally more defensive due to shaman/paladin dynamics. However, for an attrition fight I’d say druid or horde priest. 
---
But then again, I’m no pvp expert, although I did play a shadowpriest/healer pvp priest in vanilla.
---
Please try r/wowservers for private server discussion (Rule #1).
---
&gt; it's not hard to do.      
---
     
---
said every non-programmer ever when asking for something...
---
Well I'm in the group that hasn't played WoW retail in years - like 10 years to be exact. I'd personally much rather pay a one time fee - for a game I basically already paid well over $100+ to play at one point in time. It's pretty much the same game, no new content, so they don't need monthly fees since there is no new development. 
---
I'm sure most would prefer to see it as F2P, but I'd at least be willing to pay something to get my foot in the door. I think you will definitely get more people playing if they only have to pay once instead of every month.
---
„Hunters aren’t great for pvp battlegrounds“
---
This couldn’t be further from the truth. Battlegrounds and especially premades are where hunters can shine extremely well. They have amazing capabilities to close down choke points and influence teamfights heavily.
---
Paladin.
---
The idea of a plate-wearing warrior that could heal and buff his allies was amazing.  I didn't even hesitate.  I knew it was the class for me!
---
Then I got to 60 and started raiding.  I realized I was a cloth-wearing Heal/Cleanse-bot that might as well be equipping a fishing pole, if it had enough intellect and mana +5 on it.  I eventually re-rolled to a Warrior and became an MT.
---
I just like.. how hard do you think getting pre-bis gear is??
---
Literally the only item I would even consider that people might ninja and have it actually effect you in a meaningful way is HoJ, dal'rend,(maybe?) and ironfoe?  Every single person on Nostal, etc already used master loot reserve for these items anyways.
---
Everything else is just so easy to get.
---
In my case it's because I already paid well over $100+ to play this same game 10 years ago, and there is no new content or development. I'm sure they would get a lot more players to stick around if the game was F2P or with a one time buy-in.
---
Doc?
---
There are a ton of notorious cockbag guilds in the private server scene that are on the "do not group with" list as they will literally with no shame steal everything and tell you to go fuck yourself and they don't care about anything the server thinks.
---
Keep yer feet on the ground!
---
A tauren warrior whose name I forgot. Back in the beta for Vanilla
---
Created, then ran east, found the bristlebacks and promptly died six or seven times.
---
Only in hindsight do I realize that I didn't get any attacks in because I was spamming the "toggle autoattack" button.
---
Rerolled a paladin and had someone translate the buttons for me. Got him to 40 before the beta closed.
---
Are we supposed not to wear watches anymore?
---
why did it work on nostal with 12k+ online players? and it wont work with like 2500?
---
what is the classic pvp discord?
---
This is a big one on my list, never got to try as we only had 6 out of 8 tanks with enough gear. Clearing Naxx has always been a goal of mine, but became obsolete after TBC so I never went back. 
---
Orc Shaman in open beta, I was so excited for bloodlust and magic! I always loved the shaman in WC3 but thought the witch doctor totems were kinda lame, once I saw they gave the shaman totems in WoW I was a little disappointed, leveled to 14 and couldnt get over it. DELETE. 
---
I made several characters in beta to try classes out, but my first character when the game went live and whose name I remember was a male Orc Shaman. He was my first 60.
---
LOL I have retard. I use it consistently against hunters to waste their scattershot and against mages. Do u even play p servers? Stfu if u dont.
---
Here is a T3 hunter video if it helps: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ui6mf3lHSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ui6mf3lHSU) 
---
Servers and GM's aren't free
---
Nah, gotta disagree sorry. It won't cost me anything additional to play WoW Classic. I don't want to pay another $60, after just spending $60 for BfA and $15 a month every month. I think there will be a lot of crossover from current, and I want to be able to convince my current guild (Most haven't played since Vanilla), to give Classic a shot. For people who haven't played WoW in a while it might be slightly better to have a one-time fee, but it would be hard to convince current players to shell out another $60 to play a 15 year old game. Keep in mind as it is, these players won't have to spend anything additional to play Classic. It won't cost me anything extra at all.
---
i dunno man no one in my life wears them anymore nor have i worn one in years...
---
i used to own a digital camera and a pocket organizer i dont own those anymore either
---
do you guys not have phones?
---
Ah, yeah, “fun” aka casual lol. Gear’s the game in order to have fun in Raids/PvP. 
---
They could charge for cosmetics like some other games do, and they already have infrastructure from retail. 
---
No but it removes aspects that weren’t fun. You would struggle to find a Mage who didn’t love it when tables got added. Being against everything just because it wasn’t in classic is silly. Give them a really high regent cost so you have to think twice about using it, that’s in the spirit of classic.
---
Eh, I have a feeling that you're talking from the standpoint of just going into MC and what you can get away with. I've pugged MC with 2 stacks of mana potions as a healer, but if you're a part of a decent guild doing progress you're going to put in the effort to bring the other stuff as well in order to make the raid go as smooth and fast as possible.
---
If you can do the raid in 60 minutes instead of 3 hours when you bring a bunch of consumables with you, most decent guilds will require you to do so because making the raid take 3-4x longer for everybody because you can't be bothered to farm gold for consumables is very selfish.
---
In places like MC and ZG you can get away with just having a couple of stacks of mana pots and your flask and still clear the raid with a very casual approach, but it's a major understatement to make a general statement that you never need to farm for anything.
---
Here's a copy paste from a healer when it comes to Naxxramas for example:
---
*This is what my guild (well, the healers at least) are required to bring into naxx:*
---
*5x Flask of Wisdom*
---
*2x Flask of Titan*
---
*4x(5x) Brilliant Oil*
---
*1x Spirit of Zanza*
---
*1x Swiftness of Zanza*
---
*45x Major Mana Potion*
---
*35x Dark Rune/Demonic Runes*
---
*20x Mageblood Potion*
---
*20x Elixir of Fortitude*
---
*40x Kreeg's Stout Beatdown/Gordok Green Grog*
---
*40x Nightfin Soup*
---
*20x Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops*
---
*10x Restorative Potion*
---
*10x Limited Invulnerability Potion*
---
*25x Greater Frost Protection Potion*
---
*10x Greater Fire Protection Potion*
---
*10x Greater Arcane Protection Potion*
---
*30x Greater Shadow Protection Potion*
---
*10x Greater Nature Protection Potion*
---
*20x Crystal Basilisk Spine*
---
*10x SapperCharge(engineers)*
---
*10x Holy Water/Crystal Charge*
---
*20x Chillwind juju*
---
*20x Heavy Runecloth Bandage*
---
Now you can obviously start removing stuff from that list, but if you're a part of even a half decent guild it goes way beyond just a few mana potions.
---
The amount of gold most people I personally know farm for the two end game raids are around 2000-3000g just to spend on consumables during the first couple of weeks to make it a bit easier on themselves, but on top of that you need to constantly keep farming consumables to replace the ones you use during raids.
---
LOL private servers, you're the retard bud.
---
it doesn't need to affect me to have a opinion on it. I like content to last, like they say in the Blizzcon 2005 panel, where Blizzard dev's (i think Jeff Kaplan) themselves state that WoW needs undefeated for the world to feel "large". And therefore i find it sad if all content would be cleared in 1-2 weeks after launch. Vanilla content is not designed to be cleared that fast. 
---
It woild make sense that Classic would be "free" if you already have a wow subscription. If you dont have a subscription a one time buy in would make more sense.
---
Oh I'm quite aware, but I'm proud of wanting to be inclusive, I think it's better than being proud of pixels and excluding people for the sake of making myself feel better. Ofcourse I think I have the right opinions, it would be stupid to hold them even if I thought they were wrong and made me feel bad about myself.
---
And I'm not really upset, I'm a judgement prick that uses fairly pathetic arguments to try and manipulate people into my way of thinking because I don't have the capacity to win arguements with logic or reason so the best I can do is feigned empathy, condescension and misplaced outrage over things that it reality I can kind of agree with. I'm a terrible debater but I have strong options that I don't like to change.
---
We all have our weaknesses. 
---
What do you mean explain 1337? Isn't it just leetspeak?
---
I have looked into that extensively as I’m pretty much in the same position as you. A few things.
---
1. Hunters not scaling well in late vanilla seems to be at least to a big extend connected to the fact that they lack good upgrades in AQ40 as a preparation to nax.
---
2. don’t confuse sustained averaged dmg output in pve bossfights with burst potential. The latter is what is mostly relevant for pvp and is still extremely good for hunters.
---
3. hunters actually get amazing upgrades in nax so if you manage to get decked out you will be Gucci.
---
4. with nax gear your agility will be so high that it’s actually worth to spec survival for the +% agility traits. This will not only increase your dmg but also enable you to get all the great pvp talents in the tree.
---
Nothing to worry about. Don’t confuse a bossfight dmg Meter with pvp capabilities 
---
Cosmetics go against the point of Classic.  Blizzard has stated many times their goal is to create the game as it was.
---
i havent played retail in 6 years. Ive played on pvt servers the past 3 years
---
Prot Warrior is certainly the single worst class to solo world pvp with. You might beat a rogue. You MIGHT beat a squishy caster if you are lucky. And that is only 1v1. Low Dps, No Self Heal. You're pretty screwed. 
---
Assuming your gear isn't completely outclassed by an opponent you'll still be competitive. Hunter has a high skill cap so if played well you won't be an easy kill for anyone
---
I think they want crossover the other way as well though. If you're just buying in for classic, maybe one day you get bored and decide to try retail. I think their thought process is giving access to everything is better than having them separate. 
---
I would agree that free is always better but business gotta business.
---
Using item links (and later spell links in BC) in chat with “anal” before or “in my pants” after.
---
Ex:
---
[Tough Hunk of Meat] in my pants. 
---
Also 1337 means elite. By replacing letters with numbers you get one of the earliest memes of the internet. L is 1, E is 3, and T is 7, O is 0, S is 5, A is 4. 1337 spells leet, slang for elite. Using numbers instead of letters is 1337 sp34k (leet speak)
---
I’m happy to hear it, any personal favorite?
---
yea, I base my opinion on verifiable and recent experience. What do you base yours off of, your retarded 12 year old ass 15 years ago? Fucking brainlet. People like u are the reason classic is gonna be shit. 
---
Dps. Autocorrect on phone
---
If there is one thing i can't forgive, its taking away ZG and ZF as raids and replacing them with shitty 5-man clones. I had some of the best times doing those smaller raids. They felt more personal and challenging. 
---
If you are a hardcore endgame raider who is spending hundreds of g every week, definitely take the time to learn how to manage the auction house instead. You can make enough money for your consumables (providing you already grinded some money in the first place) each week by spending just a few hours a week rather than 10+
---
Personally captures the video makers alt-right alignment as well.
---
&gt; do you guys not have phones?
---
I really set myself up for this one didn't I
---
Dwarf priest a couple of days after EU launch. Can't remember the name unfortunately but only got to level 15 and then I quit. Didn't even know about wands.. Thought the game sucked and went back to Tibia. 
---
Came back to wow after a couple of months and rolled a warrior. Let's say it was a pain so only got that one to 37 before rerolling again. 
---
Thanks for the answer! I don't really care about pve performance my main concern was doing all that pve then being disappointed in the end result.
---
Why wear watches? Do you not have phones?
---
Depends on the gear. With pvp gear they are really hard to kill. Rogues if they dont manage to stunlock-kill you are fucked, mages struggle too. Warlocks depends on what pet they use, if they have vw out they are fucked. Druids will usually flee once they see they cant kill you
---
Pretty unspecific question, so I can only give you a general overview:
---
Mages **level** much more slowly than Warlocks, and slower than rogues for that matter. Yes, there is AoE farming, but it's not nearly as useful as people hype it to be...it's primarily used as a matter of last resort when zones are too congested for questing. On the other hand, you have food and water aplenty, and of course portals to help you out with those travel-heavy quests, so it's not all bad.
---
**As a dungeon class**, Mages are great, easily on par with WLs. Sheeping is super useful, and everyone welcomes free food. You have kiting ability and one of the first "Oh Snap!" Buttons to exist in WoW (iceblock). You have good single target damage and you are one of two classes with actually good AoE damage (the other btw. is the WL)
---
**As a raidclass**, the mage is pretty good, but loses in Utility against the Warlock. You provide food/H2O and Arcane Intellect, but that's pretty much it. The portals can be useful if your raid travels across the world, but generally, the prefered method is to lazily wait for that Warlock and 2 Volunteers to get there :D Ironically, one of your strongest selling points in dungeons, sheeping, is almost useless in raids, whereas the Warlocks Banish becomes immensely useful. Even more ironically, you will not be able to use your best dmg spec (fire) until after BWL, because half the stuff you see in raids before AQ is either highly resistant to fire, or flat out immune.
---
**Damage wise**, the Mage is excellent. No problems there at all, you will be alongside rogues and warlocks up there in the dmg meter. The only problem compared to the two, is Mana. The Rogue doesn't need, the WL can restore it. You have Evocation, Managem and Pots. Learning how to use those intelligently, is part of being a good Mage.
---
**In PvP** the mage is fun to play, especially because hes such a good counter to Melees, foremost the all-too-numerous Warriors. It has a pretty high skill ceiling, and a good Mage can be an absolute horror to play against. However, it's almost irrelevant how well you play...when you are up against a Warlock, especially a SL, you are dead. Sorry, but they simply counter you, end of story.
---
Yeah, I think that's it, in a nutshell.
---
&gt; SL Lock doesn't lose to rogues (usually)
---
Even with Serenity?
---
didn't really bother me, and I'm pretty liberal.
---
It was in the demo Alex tested it on stream
---
I made a thread asking for a straight forward class that does well in pvp for a noob. I got a lot of rogue replys, but you say thats wrong? Or did u mean in pve, cuz im thinking pvp wise.
---
&gt; If you dont have a subscription a one time buy in would make more sense.
---
Why tho? Why pay $60 when you can jump in for $15.
---
I was thinking that too. 
---
Is there a viable spec with concussion blow being played?
---
I for one could not stand the fucking baby crying in the background over the whole video

These are nice notes, righteous fury not being required is great.

Any priority you may have in a guild - Primarily we want to do the endgame raid content. Dungeon running and PvP is secondary. We welcome a balance of gaming and taking time out for RL.
---
Any pertinent rules.
---
-Standard non toxic social rules. No harassment etc.
---
A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application) You can PM me for now, I can give the discord link if you need more info.
---
Extra information - currently we have 10 Australian mate in our 30s s forming a guild. We’re taking time off work for launch and will be playing daily. We have no issues with people who want to have a social or family life.
---
Who told you that because it worked in the demo
---
Paid "$100+".....lol if that's all you're in for that's nothing haha. But to be serious, f2p means microtransactions and such galore and then it's not classic wow.
---
Dwarf Priest, no explanation needed.
---
We got up to four horsemen in vanilla where we had to quit due to not having any tanks. Sure vanilla is a more casual raiding experience than retail but still, no reason not to have fun.
---
Maybe they do, I work as a programmer though and it's really easy to do.
---
And this is why the conversation is so important. Many of the modern changes were made to get people into "the game" faster only to find out that those time sinks were a major component of the game, running to instances being one of them.
---
I think the difference though is that running to an instance IS gameplay. There's opportunity for pvp, harvesting resources, chatting with other people in your group. In the case of mage tables vs summoning water, you're sitting in front of Org hitting the same button every 3 seconds for 15 minutes....that's nuts.
---
No we won't be starting one but will be looking for one if we can find it.  High population with pvp and raiding
---
All of my prior characters have been horde so far. All signs point to dwarf priest being the best with ward and all that. This is making me want to roll alliance this time. I’m not afraid of a new experience, I just have so much nostalgia for the horde side lol. 
---
Were you an alliance member? What were some pros to being alliance in your opinion? 
---
Thanks for posting this, haven't seen anyone mention it before. Really love the team working on Classic, they seem to understand our love for it.
---
i always come early kappa
---
Human 60 paladin on a RP server (Earthern ring from memory).
---
(Still has his gear on to this date)
---
I ran 25 UBRS runs, no lightforge ever dropped. I was one of those people who had no idea of how to properly play the class. I would try to tank and heal at the same time. The talent tree I had at the time was terrible!!
---
I played from launch solo for majority of the game I am still shocked how different vanilla was from retail.
---
My guild got up to the four horsemen in vanilla without any problems what so ever, we couldn't get any further because we only had 3-4 tanks. We had very few requirements regarding consumables because frankly they weren't needed.
---
When you start demanding that people farm for hours and hours just to be able to do a singular raid night that's when people start leaving the guild. Certain consumables should absolutely be required but far from all of them.
---
Spending 4 hours grinding to save 1 hour of raiding makes zero sense.
---
now, why did this get no attention apart from 1 downvote?

---
Whats absurd about a moonkin? The best spec in the game bar none, nothing can compete with a crit chicken
---
I was there for launch and before that. The game was a broken mess but it drew millions of us in anyways. I won't explore Elwyn fresh again, I won't finish VC again for the first time. But I do hope to not spend hours every week queued up, competing for quests, getting loot-locked, d/ced, and so on. Now THAT would be fresh and new, something even private servers still can't do for me. This is a game I want to see working properly  day 1 so that all the memories are good
---
I get that Warrior is a pain to level, but I'm not going to let that stop me from making one. I hit 60 as a Paladin so I've experienced slow leveling anyway.
---
Who cares if PvE server players quit because they're bored?
---
I agree getting blackout by itself would be useful for a troll. SWP does proc blackout, but the proc is based on the cast itself not the extra duration. 
---
Can you show me this? Because I find it very hard to believe they'd rewrite the bug they fixed just for the demo.
---
The /sit macro was famously patched somewhere around 1.9 and it carried over into 1.12. 
---
They've already stated they're going to implement **all** the bug fixes that were implemented by 1.12.
---
The /sit macro did not exist in Vanilla 1.12.
---
Just for reference, [here's the bluepost showing this was fixed long before 1.12.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
&gt; “Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?”
---
&gt; “**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.** However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.”
---
&gt; BFD
---
I didn't even know it existed until my second alt which I was playing sometime in the summer of 06. Horde on my server never ran it for some reason, not sure why though, I personally loved it!
---
I made it to 60 but it took me a year. I took my time, explored the world, tried to dps as a Paladin, unsubbed and resubbed a few times.
---
The hyperventilation is real.
---
How are rogues and warriors even comparable in terms of newbie unfriendliness? Rogues at least have stuns, sprint and vanish. Warriors have zero panic buttons. Is it because both lack healing?
---
and SM in Tirisfal
---
Yep. 25g respec just for that stupid innervate talent then afk in raid. Good times. 
---
It's a combination of different problems. For one, there are less people spread out on more servers/shards - on the other hand, blizzard enjoys shoving them all into the same shard when you're in an area that doesn't have people in it.
---
So for a working example even when a rare mob spawns in wrath areas in the shard you wind up in, someone probably already has killed or trained it. Or as in my hunter example, you'll get jammed into the shard without it the moment you try to get to it.
---
Trying to tame rares *or* kill them is an exercise in futility now.
---
No. Buyers need to be banned as well.
---
ZF a raid?
---
It's been like what, 30+ years since Blizzard was founded? I think some people are forgetting that there is a more likely reason the company is faltering....age of the founders themselves. Did we expect them to dev games until they died? They have been handing off responsibility or starting new companies for at least a decade, and as the key people we consider to be Blizzard leave for whatever reason it was bound to change as new minds took over. I'm sure Activision plays a large part in where we stand today, but I think maybe time does as well. All empires collapse
---
It sucks for EU that there's absolutely no famous streamers who played vanilla besides Forsen. For Americans there's Asmon,Soda,Esfand,Staysafe,Summit,Lirik and many more. 
---
Dwarf Pally named Kcirtap. Got him to maybe level 33 over the course of a year (I was like 8 years old and had no idea what I was doing.) 
---
Realistically speaking, this is going to happen.
---
Unless addon api wouldn't be able to inspect people, but even then it will probably exist in some form from extrnal sources like [raider.io](https://raider.io)
---
But friends, and to some extent - guilds, don't need your score
---
I haven't played priest so this is just my opinion, but MindFlay doesn't seem great in helping kite melee as it is channeled so you have to stand in one spot. It's good for slowing opposing flag carrier, or peeling off for team mate. But personally I don't think it is worth 6 points. 
---
That is what I agree with. Traveling the world can be considered a "waste of time" if you're literally doing nothing but moving from point A to point B. If you're doing other stuff in between it can be quite fun. But conjuring up drinks over and over and over and over does not lead to anything interesting.
---
I'm raiding just fine with my bear. It's a good offtank and it is better than warrior on some boss. Almost every guild now bring at least one nowadays (alliance side, might be slightly less the case horde side).
---
Mankrik's was an orc.  Not a NE.  :)
---
People has done the math, and 5% spirit means alot when you have darkmoon card. Certainly alot more than fear ward which adds nothing on most fights.
---
While the racials of a Night Elf doesn’t add anything in raids. It adds alot when playing in the world and in battlegrounds. Vanilla is not all about the raids. As long as you are a decent player, you will not have any problem finding a raiding guild as a night elf priest.
---
Human Paladin, day 1 of WoW. I actually made a version of him in the open beta, so he's technically a bit older than that. Still have that character to this day (not subbed currently, though), with a bank of old items, some of which are no longer accessible.
---
I rolled on a RP realm because "PvP" sounded scary, and "PvE sounded only a bit less scary, so I went with the nice-sounding "RP." I had no idea what it actually meant, but it turns out I really came to enjoy roleplaying.
---
I unsubbed and resubbed several times throughout Vanilla, dinged 60 about a year after launch, and never really did much raiding. I was in a "raiding" guild (we did MC, and barely downed Rags before the TBC pre-patch; a feat I never saw because I was still in high school and had a bedtime long before our raid ended). I mostly PvP'd and got to the rank of Knight-Captain, which ain't bad given that I was a studious high schooler whose parents imposed time limitations on the amount I played. Also, the title unlocked the legacy pvp set armor transmog when that became a thing, which was nice.
---
I think I started as Mining/Blacksmith but never put effort into it. At some point after hitting 60 I put the time into maxing Engineering and never dropped it, even through Legion. Engi made Paladins a blast in PvP. Oneshotting people with lucky Gnomish Deathray  rits, landing grenades to get off *just one more* Holy Light. Reckbombing unsuspecting hordies outside Orgrimmar as they sat and drank.
---
I can't wait to live it all again. I know it won't be the same, but I'm gonna put a bit of effort into professions as I level (herb/alch), gonna change it up (dwarf instead of human), and try to do some raids if life allows (probably MC, maybe eventually BWL).
---
Damn, nostalgia is powerful.
---
Yeah I have 0 interest in 1v1 specs. MindFlay would be an additional tool to support the team. It's probably not worth it given that the 5 points required to reach it are lack luster. At that point, might as well not take blackout at all, even as Troll.
---
Yea SL/SL was never broken like people claim. What it was though is a top tier spec so easy to play to 100% skill cap. You could have a capybara play it and, get glad especially in twos.
---
Crap man I forgot about Arcane mages. Jesus they were scary. I only played the first half of WOTLK before I quit. So maybe they pulled it out at the end but, for me I will never understand why such a garbage expac is remembered so fondly. Maybe people just love Ice Crown that much lol
---
I see a lot of people on here not wanting to roll on the same servers as streamers, but I see that as a great chance for some organized guild wpvp to shut said streamer down. 
---
Am i missing something? 
---
An issue with hunters that's not often discussed is the choice of upgrade from quest bow is very limited. Good luck getting the Chromag xbow. If you do that, no upgrade in AQ40. No upgrade while progressing through Naxx til KT. 
---
I find that statement kinda hard to swallow, as I remember wipe after wipe trying new bosses in Naxx, learning the strats, and going through flasks and mana pots like crazy (and when it came to certain bosses, the importance of timing for pots.)
---
Maybe your guild walked into Naxx and one or two shot all the bosses, but when it came to raiding, ours worked hard, long, and ate flasks, pots, food, and at times, rotations just to get the mana back to successfully kill the bosses.  
---
A nice, steady stroll through one of your favourite dungeons with empty bags and someone to DE can make you some nice coin.  Heal pots go to the tanks and dps, mana pots go to the healer / mana dps.  Swap out to empty bags, and between the de's and some drops that sell, it's golden.
---
Ugh, I made you cringe.
---
Wow, what a terrible design for a book cover...

Back in Vanilla, we would hold Searing Gorge so we could grab all the black lotus.

The joys of a pvp server, the absolute JOY!
---
Elemental ofcourse- enhance cannot do anything against a mage with a brain.
---
I'm not exactly sure if you meant to respond to me or somebody else with this comment. All I was saying was that the raid PvE balance is better in 1.1 than it is in 1.12 (for example, rets and enhance can actually put out competitive, and probably better DPS than warriors with 1.1 talents and mechanics, compared to 1/3rd with 1.12 talents/mechanics/items). It seems from your post that you might agree with me on this one, but I can't really tell. I was just responding to your post which didn't seem to draw a distinction between the two, and just said "balance is better in 1.12" while seemingly not mentioning PvE as a big part of balance.
---
&gt;They are there so new players can play the game and compete. Blizzard flat out said this was their design intention with paladins. Enhance is the same deal. You are "op" with near zero learning curve in many situations for 2/3rd of Vanilla WoW in easily gotten gear. The victim complex, especially with rets needs to stop. Enhance Shamans for some reason aren't as delusional.
---
I'd be interested if you have a source for this. In the recent Kevin Jordan (the game designer who created and balanced all the classes) interview with countdowntoclassic, I recall him saying that the terrible balance of 1.12 PvE was not intended and was something they were always trying to fix, which is a bit at odds with the statement you're making here. 
---
As for your statement that enhance and ret are OP for 2/3rds of Vanilla, I guess I have to ask what you have in mind when you say 2/3rds. Because we know from private servers with a progressive content release but frozen 1.12 that enhance and ret are slower than average levelers, start off dealing ~50% the damage of fury in prebis in PvE and only gets worse, and aren't invited to serious PvP groups even at the start. I would say that these 3 things make up the game, so they are in fact underpowered for 100% of the game. Where is this 2/3rds that you're talking about?
---
Being a druid in classic. Is like coming so close to getting laid over and, over. Then at the last second rather then bedding you. The girl's BF comes into the room and, kicks you in the nuts. You come so close to greatness and, fall short over and, over. 
---
Okay that makes sooooo much more sense. While I very rarely lost to elemental on my mage. I am very willing to accept that all of those shamans were terrible. The skill cap on that class is uber freaking high after all.
---
How are yeh
---
So are you saying that only the initial cast procs it not the extra 5 ticks of damage? (Regardless imp swp)
---
Rock would be scissors, but rock can't find scissors because scissors is invisible.
---
SM is next to a Horde zeppelin. It is miles away from any alliance wp. 
---
I love playing prot in BGs. You're really annoying. Interrupts and stuns are fun to use but what it comes down to is such a low amount of dps you just cant kill anyone in the given window of stun/interrupt. So prot warrior as part of a group pvp can be awesome, but solo I could really only kill rogues consistently or casters who significantly undergeared me that could stun/silence and get a few crits into with SS etc. I'm sure there are better prot pvp players by all means but just as my experience in general. 
---
Ohhh, I hope not. The only people I trust less than Blizzard to get this right is the playerbase at large. And those OSRS polls have led to some very anti-old school features (Grand Exchange is my primary gripe).
---
Fear Ward has a 10 min *duration* and a 30sec cooldown.
---
O RLY?
---
Thank you. Apparently me admitting my assumption was half-assed and mostly baseless is denying his self-proclaimed "facts" and spreading corporate propaganda. I even literally said I didn't care and hoped I was wrong. Dude needs a cig and some coffee to cool off.
---
All that damn time and you give up in the 50s? Yikes
---
Your idea of really easy and mine might be different.  When you say really easy, I hear "A trivial change to a system I know well using technology I am skilled with"  IE something that gets almost no story points and is submitted for testing an hour later.   This add on will be a bit harder.   Not rocket surgery, but it isn't getting finished in an afternoon, because even if you're really conversant with the project, you still need to create all the data for shit like the wolfshead helm [IE. +whatever if equipped by a feral drood, +whatever/x if equipped by feral druid who is a tank, etc.]      
---
      
---
You're very likely misjudging the scope here. 
---
U don't need it to be annouced beforehand if u are simply smart about it. If they don't do it just do like "We choose the first server with B and after that alphabetic order" so "BA&gt;BB&gt;BC............. If no server with B then u go to C etc" that way u will have a server choosen beforehand.
---
(But ofc it's easier if they just annouce them, but mostlikely they will be leaked just like demo ones did because u can preinstall the client)
---
I'd guess a PVP Prot Spec might be something along these lines:  [**Legacy-WoW.com/vanilla-talents/warrior-talents/?tal=3200502000000000000500000000000000055250103003001251**](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/warrior-talents/?tal=3200502000000000000500000000000000055250103003001251)

But doesn’t rock become an unstoppable force?
---
You're getting downvoted and getting troll-y responses because it feels like you're assuming that people who disagree with you do so because they're assholes. When you open with "why do you give a shit?" "Does it make you feel special?" and "What a fucking horrible personality trait" it makes it hard for people to believe you're arguing in good faith. It feels like you fundamentally misunderstand the opposing viewpoint - and that you'd rather accuse people who hold it of being bad people rather than try to understand them.
---
You don't deserve people giving you shit, though. If I was qualified to apologize on behalf of this sub, I would, but I'm just some nobody. Still, sorry people have been dicks.
---
Regardless... The fact that so many people *have* disagreed with you should tell you one thing: To this community, to the people who are disagreeing with you, offense is not given or taken by this exclusivity in the game. The concept that even though we all start at the same level 1 blank slate, and that we all have the same opportunities with our characters, only a select few can advance to the top... We don't see that as a way to laugh at the people who didn't make the game's cut, it's a motivational and inspirational idea that drives us to try to accomplish the toughest things the game has to offer.
---
The fact that there is a division in the community - the haves, and the have-nots... That contrast gives context and meaning to the "haves." Yes, I'll agree, being a "have-not" is a negative feeling. But what makes Classic so great in comparison to Retail is that Classic isn't afraid to give the player a bad time to motivate them to move forward. The experience of playing Classic 1-60 is an adventure made up of peaks and valleys, good times and bad times. Retail 1-120 is a boring flatline. But Classic's peaks only mean anything when the player has the context from the valleys they rose from to understand it.
---
Like, I hope we can agree on the principle with a simpler example. It's been 5 levels since you got the newest rank of Frostbolt, and your go-to spell is hitting weaker than it ought to. That's not fun. It's not the end of the world though, you won't quit over it. Because next level, you get the next rank. And when you do, it feels really good, better than just being strong all the time. Because you had the context of the whole last level or two you spent with a weaker Frostbolt. The peak means more, because you had to pull yourself up out of the valley.
---
That same concept of negativity motivating improvement is one half of the puzzle - the other half is that, yes, things do mean more to people when only a small sub-section of the population has access to it. I don't know how I would try to convince you that I don't think that's some kind of moral failing, though.
---
**TL;DR**
---
You don't deserve people giving you shit, but they did because you sound (to put it really bluntly) holier-than-thou. Exclusivity isn't supposed to put people down and make them feel bad, it's supposed to motivate people to rise to it's level. I would argue the concept is a more extreme form of the peaks and valleys of positivity and negativity that make Classic superior to Retail.
---
If u want to play PVP, as far as i know from all the big streamers, the only one that's PVP so far is Sodapoppin, the rest wanna go PVE because otherwise their viewers will ruin it from them (ofc maybe a few 500-2k streamers will still go PVP, but that's the only REALLY big one i know that want to go PVP)
---
Why would a rogue be screwed? Wound poison and it’s GG stunlock or not.
---
Another thing to remember is that the 60 naxx was removed after tbc, so noone could go back and solo it
---
I meant ZA***
---
You forgot moonfire spam
---
Would be more impressive if it were all him solo; he mostly seems to duo pvp with a devilsaur partner.
---
it will happen
---
I hear you, but to me the initial chaos is what makes it fun.  Imagine if you will 1 million new creature crawling out of the spawning pool, do they suddenly all disappear into different space time, or do they fight it out and let survival of the fittest differentiate them?  I prefer survival of the fittest.
---
You shouldn't exspect "Everyone to have naxx gear" that's not going to happen, no matter what it's a lot of time invested into pots etc etc. Even years down the line only the top % will get it (yes over the years the % will increase ofc, but it still won't be a whole lot of the 60's"
---
Ds/ruin warlock and combat rogue
---
in early content, hunters gets the most spots, then slowly they start getting less and less.
---
Hahahahaha, that sounds like a lot of fun :)
---
Druids are way easier than shamans, well feral anyway.
---
Why? Streamers are just random characters in the game with not any more relevance than a NPC if you don't give them any. Or do you not want to end on somebody's stream? What does it matter if you don't watch it? 
---
Sharding put the nail in the coffin for me personally regarding playing on retail. It’s so fucking rediculous.
---
Classic is definitely not for you.
---
No.  It is the attitude that will preserve it.
---
Except one of them actually does damage capable of killing someone without double activating trinkets.
---
I didn't say it wouldn't take time but it's fairly straight forward. When I say easy I mean it's not complicated. 
---
You have 124 spirit, adding 5% gives you 130 spirit, you only get 6 spirit from the racial. 
---
124 spirit comes from the base lvl 60 priest. 
---
Having like some naxx gear, rest bwl and aq40 gear gets you to like 264 spirit. adding 5% gives you 277, only a 13 spirit increase, that’s honestly nothing even with dark moon card.
---
When you can run one dungeon per night, and most items have (at best) a 40% drop chance?  
---
A lot different than live where you can get better-than-raid gear from World Quests and can farm 15 minute dungeon runs.
---
Wash yer back!
---
The investment in that case is time.
---
Human mage, emulating Rhonin from the books. Emulating to the point that I wanted to make him a sword and staff mage and kept trying to make a strength build to compliment his spells. Fun times. Still wish we had a proper "battle mage" build ability.  
---
Fair enough. Upon reflection I think I might have over sold the disparity between food wells and individual delivery, but it’s just hard to argue with how the game feels when every point of contact is one to one.
---
same goes with "one time buy in" if classic ends up being more of "niche" for A LOT of people but not a lot of "new players" joining one time payment would be the worst choice for blizzard. Since u pay once and then they never get money again.
---
Because it's more than $60 after 4 months of playing.
---
Thanks for filling it out for me.
---
Ah, fair enough.  Regardless, I hope you don't write it. Vanilla needs GS about as much as it needs flying mounts
---
They want to create classic wow. Adding in premium cosmetics makes it a diffrent game for what people exspect. Them adding that and they can start adding a lot of other stuff, like buying gold etc. It's not what most people want to see when they want to try classic again
---
For us it mostly had to do with 40 people learning to execute the fight. If we still had trouble at that point it was time to consider consumables because it was clearly a gear issue. The only boss I can recall where we had serious oom problems was patchwerk but our healing officer handled that by creating rotating groups of healers so they wouldn't have to rely on consumables.
---
I'm sure there were others that I can't remember but it's been 13 odd years. 
---
But it's more than just your time. It's the time of everyone in the raid. There is such thing as a price that is too high.
---
I hope people will allow this in Classic, they're really fun to play. 
---
Many more sandbox elements - wow is quite limited when it comes to exploration and world interaction.
---
I would like to see a truly huge world, in which you could not teleport to or from all areas. You’d be stuck at the frontier without AH, mailbox, and so on - but were able to farm some great trade goods. Travel would have a cooldown of a few days.
---
Guildhalls are a unfortunately terrible idea, due to it drawing people away from the cities and into instanced areas - but having rooms cities be usable by top guilds (with some perks like maybe an outlet vendor for excess raid goods etc.) is a dream. These could be prestige goals and go by round robin among those who fulfilled the high-end prereqs, best raids, least deaths, most class-and-spec-diverse raids, or what have you. 
---
I have no interest in writing it because I don't want it in the game, but I'm fairly certain someone will. 
---
The way the book title is sitting right at the edge of the picture rather than having some padding around it is making me uncomfortable.
---
most people are competitive players. that was also the case in vanilla. I knew many people even from my crap guild that didn't want to do dungeons for the fun of it, but for the reward so they could go to raids. That has nothing to do with reatail, but with different mindsets that existed long before WoW ever came out.
---
That of course doesn't mean you can't kick ppl from your guild who don't adhere to your mindset
---
Worgen druid. I was like hell yeah I can turn into a werewolf, a tiger, a bear and more, that's cool
---
Check my answer to Selky just below.
---
it has been 75 days since we heard anything.
---
[http://vanillafans.com/](http://vanillafans.com/)
---
atleast i hope it wont be like after last blizzcon where it took them 225 days to give us any info.
---
Ok, so your issue is that difficulty should be tiered so different people with different effort levels can complete the game’s content and “experience it all”.
---
A lot of games with single player campaigns benefit from this approach, for sure.  Halo, Goldeneye, GoW, and a bunch of others.
---
What’s different here is the MMORPG aspect of the game.  MMOs have traditionally been more focused on “here is the world we built, here’s the bar, now go for it.” 
---
Your argument of “well this just makes a small percentage of people feel good and elitist!” Is actually true but not completely to that degree of arrogance you’re suggesting.  It’s up to each player to either be boastful and exclusive or simply taking pride in their accomplishment.

Your argument of “how does me doing it on an easier setting take away from your hard mode?!” Is a bit tricky for sure, but I’ll share my thoughts.  Setting a bar in a living world (different from a single player scaled-difficulty game) should be a bar that is unbiased of your time commitment and skill level.
---
The reason I say it should be unbiased is because it fundamentally gives everyone the option to do easy mode.  Therein lies the issue.  If you’re a top geared, 900+ hours character and suddenly a 250 hour character can see and do what you just did is kind of a slap in the face to your hard work. (Yes, it is because of exclusivity, but it was EARNED.)
---
So, in (long) conclusion, here is my answer to your point of “how it’s not elitist to bar people by not having a difficulty setting,”:
---
It is “elitist”.  It is exclusive. It is a flat unbiased bar that simulates the real effort of a real life skill.  Not a scaled experience.  The truth is that the content is supposed to give an opportunity to achieve something universally great.
---
Using the hockey analogy, it’s essentially “we won the Stanley cup!”
---
Vs.
---
“We won the Stanley cup!”  “Oh yeah, which one?”
---
Scarcity is what makes an achievement an achievement.  I’m sorry to beat a dead horse, but this is how vanilla is geared towards players and the important thing is:  it’s OKAY to not see and experience everything.  “When everyone is super, no one is.”
---
DING!
---
Can't wait for blood lord and panther
---
It is. Thanks for the explanation.
---
So as a noob i should go mage instead of rogue or hunter for classic?
---
“mages struggle too”
---
Hmm I’m gonna disagree on that and 99% of other people will too. Mages are one of the best if not THE best wpvp class in classic. So much surviveabillity with ice block, ice barrier, cold snap if you’re running deep frost and elemental is even more powerful.
---
It’s turning me on tbqh
---
We do what we must
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
Spec? Didn't show it in the video or even link it in description
---
Is hunter good against most classes 1v1? Are mages better?
---
Got mine today, 50 pages in and loving it.
---
Do u have to be really good at rogue to do well? Or is it noob friendly
---
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
that is not how vanilla shadowmeld do
---
I think you mean 1337 5p34k.
---
I'm worried that they will put sharding in at launch to ease the launch of Classic. This will lead to them saying something like "Oh well look how well it works!" (Even if it doesn't), then lead to Blizzard leaving sharding in place against the wishes of the community.
---
I'd rather have no sharding at all, even at the start, than risk this scenario happening.
---
Actually I have business associates there. But I was unaware of the difference between US streamers and EU streamers.
---
has been posted and discussed yesterday
---
Thanks for reminding me not to DPS in classic.
---
How do hunters to in end game pvp compared to rogues &amp; warriors.
---
This was posted yesterday and received quite a few upvotes (should be easy to find), I believe barely over 24 hours ago, so I'm removing this as a repost (Rule #7).
---
There’s a ton on twink trio vids on the net, just google. Just maybe not while at work.
---
This post was removed due to Rule #1 (this sub is for Classic WoW, not private servers). Please try r/wowservers for private server gameplay.
---
I loved the salt when I would band-aid during iceblock.
---
Good times
---
As a noob i was looking at mage, hunter, rogue, warrior. Sounds like i should go mage or hunter?
---
First was my human Priest who is still my main today (now my gnome Priest).
---
Molten core, honestly. People blowing up as the bomb in the middle of the raid group, and hearing the inevitible meltdown on voice chat. 
---
Good times. 
---
That's why mages are first to the raid, and make food and drink before everyone else gets there.
---
You don't have to be the only person doing it, that's what teamwork is about. That one time you show up late for raid, the other mage stepped up and filled your roll and helped you out too
---
No you can't because they don't exist....
---
I dunno, with the direction Blizzard/Activision is going I don't forsee any projected changes they have being very player friendly.
---

---
l2p
---
It's weird ay, all this hyperventilation over getting into a raid. Just don't be a dick and it'll work out.
---
This sounds quite unhealthy.
---
It really depends on what you like to do. If you like solo play and, world questing and, just being chill like 90% of the time. Play hunter. Honestly  though if you want a highly noob friendly class that can devastate anything. Play a priest. You will most likely need to heal raids but, oh man in pvp. You are the absolute scariest thing to see on the other side of a bg. 
---
Newer players used to the new game think that in pvp a disc will be more "helpful" to a team. In classic this is not the case. As a shadow priest you will heal your team for 25% of the damage you deal and, brother holy crap will you deal damage. In addition to that you still have access to shield and, dispel magic two of your strongest "disc" spells. Keep in mind this isn't new wow. With working trinkets and, reasonably timed CC. Pull a buddy out of a 45 second CC and you are the real MVP. Dispel magic is the strongest pvp spell in classic after all.
---
I was thinking in terms of dps PVP. Wich class would u reccomend?
---
That fight hurt my feelings, on more than one occasion. You won't see another fight that requires that level of full raid coordination and awareness until Gothik, imo.
---
yea bullshitting on ventrilo while spamming 1111121111131111411112 along with spacebar. good times...
---
Yeah asmongold definitly said he was going PvE
---
Don’t remember my character’s name.  I remember making a human mage and playing for a long time during the free trial just going around to Goldshire, fighting Kobolds, and whatnot.
---
From there I’ve become an altaholic and it’s been hard to remember which character was what and what purpose I had intended.
---
I came up with this for Prot pvp awhile ago.. Haven't really tried it properly on my 60 warr.. Only have a few peices of t2 and zg pieces kind of meh gear, and a lot of it is def oriented not damage. 
---
Mostly stuns, silence, aoe slow, overpower when you can, and the extra bleeds to improve single target DPS (though it's still bad ofc =P).  Designed to be played in group PVP 
---
WHORE
---
That’s adorable.  I really like that.
---
there are many potential problems a big stream could bring to a server (many good as well so I dont really consider it a big problem for me at least but I'll list some things I believe could be negative), such as population imbalances if everyone liked said streamer they might flock to their faction causing you to be outnumbered, if they like raiding Org you may have to deal with it often, people will bring them up a lot in chat, their fans might camp World boss spawns and try to let them get it for attention, if you are on the same Faction as them and you have a similiar raid time you might find an enemy raid trying to block the path for them and in turn blocking you as well
---
If you mean Learn 2 Play by that, then it is already included in the "(and other Myndflame videos)".
---
the problem is if your server has a good population for 2 weeks you committed a lot of time and then suddenly 90% of Horde quits the game but alliance loses 20%, so you are stuck with a major investment and now have trouble finding groups and get dominated in Wpvp by numbers, and as far as streamers go there are so many it might be hard to be sure none are on your server 
---
Not trying to demotivate you, but have you actually ever published a game?
---
I play retail still and I agree with everything he says in the video. PLENTY (if not all) of people in my guild feel the same way... I just like progression raiding enough to continue playing... The raids are actually really good its just the rest of the content that is complete shit.
---
I just hate being lumped in with "everyone in retail". REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm little over 70 pages. it's super interesting.
---
For context, this is coming from someone who cleared Mythic Uldir back in October and I don't terribly mind breaks between tiers. Obviously you are referring to a different demographic of players but I still just hate being lumped into the "retail" category.
---
Correct. The tool-tip reads:  Gives your Shadow damage spells a 10% chance to stun the target for 3sec. Meaning the proc is based on the casting of the spell, not the damage ticks. 
---

---
Finished it last night. Great book.
---
Focus target was removed as a keybind in the classic demo as well. Either that or not present in the client the demo was using in the first place.  
---
I prefer the modern macro system tbh.  
---
Oh man that's a real bummer. So does that mean only the first proc of mind flay as well?
---
stocks
---
Hmmm.. I'm not sure if he still has the video up but I personally asked him on stream while he was in westfall and he got crit everytime he sat down on stream
---
If you are only looking at DPS and, only wanna play the classes you listed. I would go for Mage. Hunters are fun at first but, they get kinda lame after a while. Not bad just kinda lame. Mages on the other hand only get cooler with time and, are hugely rewarding to play. 
---
Also if you pick mage. Look up how to farm herbs in diremaul. Or Orbs from stratholme as that will be how you make most of your money.
---
I'm about half way through and have really enjoyed it. 
---
Almost feels like I'm part of the team!  /s
---
You saw this happen on stream, or he only said it?
---
I’m not trying to imply that Alex is lying, but he’s not necessarily the most level-headed source of information. He’s burned himself many times before so I take his points always with a grain of salt. 
---
Yeah that's why I almost preferred the raiding in MC and BWL because it's so relaxed. Even after I'd gotten all the loot in there it was so chill to just lay back and fire shadow bolts while shooting the shit on discord. AQ and Naxx required a lot of focus and tryharding. 
---
(This is on private server though, wrathbaby here).
---
Blackout, MindFlay, and Silence would be an awesome combo, but it requires a significant commitment of talent points that gimps the Disc and Holy tree. I would like to play around with this hybrid spec I'm talking about just for fun. But at the end of the day there is no way it can be as effective in pvp as going deep into any individual tree. I'll probably end up with something like 31/20/0
---
For pretext, my raid experience in Classic is only MC/ZG due to a crappy computer and internet.  
---
C'thun and Four Horsemen - because out of every boss in the game, these are the two that make me lose my confidence in myself. I've read/watched/studied the strategies for every other boss in the game, and only these two scare me to death and make me think I might wipe the raid while trying to learn them.  
---
I hear what your saying. I only took VE because it was cheap. 
---
I believe he designed it so that is was supposed to resemble a textbook.
---
plot twist: he's the hacker
---
Most of the streamers are no lifer-s playing 16+ hours a day, so it really won't be an issue. They will easily outlevel everyone within a day. No one playing 16 hour days is going to be playing just to annoy streamers, and even if they are they will quickly get outleveled through playing inefficiently. 
---
This is good news isn't it? This is proof they're trying to stick to vanilla as much as possible.
---
1337 Hax0rZ
---
I remember in vanilla I had a lvl 30 night elf hunter named zomglazors and a pet named pewpew 
---
No because you would farm the same raids until the next patch released the next teir...
---
So, I can’t attest to vanilla, but I found that rogue PvP required a considerable effort to be decent at the class.
---
(Late BC and early Wrath, so someone with a classic background, please feel free to correct me)
---
and that price should be nearby to whatever-manna-biscuits-cost (from the vendor).
---
removing barriers - whether they be qol, time, social, etc - comes with consequences.
---
making mage food/water more convenient indirectly lowers goldsink usage
---
oh shit ur right, my bad
---
I doubt it, they'll get bored of that too fast, no matter how sheepish they may be in character. 
---
Feral druid aren't considered memespec anymore because they actually work well if you put the effort (as a tank and as dps alliance side). Almost every guild alliance side have or want to have one. (Spot are still somewhat rare because you don't really want more than 2 tho).
---
Yeah he's a meme lol but I seen it work a few times when he tried it after I asked so I'm 100% sure it works in the demo
---
If the "everyone has Naxx gear" time actually happens, this game will be far enough that either A. Burning crusade will release or
---
B. The developer's can FINALLY start "making changes". It's only vanilla until all the content is in then it can be anything...
---
Day made thanks
---
Perfecting swing time will only really gain you about up to 5% more dps. Un the end it's very negligable in the grand scheme of things. I wouldn't worry about it in any case. 
---
I've tested many things on private servers in all raids and this was something I tested extensively 
---
I will roll an alliance warlock, go sl and laugh at everyone trying to kill me while they slowly die from my dot (including rogues of course) :)
---
Druid are far from being beginner friendly.
---
Hey stop that 
---
So, what do you think it's worse than a holy priest in solo pvp?
---
Mages? Rogues? Really?
---
He wasn't saying mages struggle win wpvp but rather they struggle in trying to beat a holy preist. The priest will simply outlast the mage with heals and mana burn. 
---
G00d c47ch.
---
Just post the video itself...
---
I'm Tichondrius all the way. 
---
Here's to hope you're right.
---
True, maybe I’m just annoyed we need to have such a big stock of it when grinding and farming, and also lose 1 bag slot :(
---
Don't base anything on Naxx. You won't make it there, and most won't either. 
---
Stuff might get downed but people won’t be geared lol
---
That’s a hat
---
Any chace this'll make it to eu?
---
Yeah given that pole arms were pretty much the de facto weapon it's shocking how uncool they are. 
---
Well, even still, I wouldn’t count on it working because all it takes is pointing out that this was patched out of 1.12 and they’ll definitely remove it.
---
On private servers it’s only created hugely degenerate play
---
Night Elf Hunter. I was young and thought the elfs in Lord of the Rings were cool. No, I did not name him Legolas.
---
Oh okay, sorry.  :P
---
My first character and main was a gnome warlock, with tailoring and enchanting. I created him on the first day of retail. I chose warlock because the manual (or maybe website) said it was one of the most complex and difficult classes to play. I chose gnome, I think because of the intellect boost and escape artist. I eventually tried all the other classes, though I only got a dwarf hunter above level 35.
---
Warlock gave me everything I wanted in terms of multiple ways to do things, and high utility. I could dot, I could nuke, I could tag-team with my own pets or with other players, I could even (drain) tank in the open world and certain instance fights. My utility was just silly, with healthstones, soulstones, eye of kilrogg, summoning other players, underwater breathing, detect invisibility, buffs and debuffs, crowd control (seduce, banish, enslave), and probably a couple I am forgetting. The only thing I recall lacking was mobility; I didn't have stealth or direct healing of others, but those didn't seem part of the image of a warlock to me anyhow.
---
I never needed food or water! Even when nice mages just gave them to me, I never needed to use them because I could life tap and drain life. I rarely thought twice about going into an open world fight with a health or mana bar at only half. It was a bit of a shock to me, in fact, when I did create characters of other classes, how much downtime they had by comparison.

You can drink while the group continues to pull.
