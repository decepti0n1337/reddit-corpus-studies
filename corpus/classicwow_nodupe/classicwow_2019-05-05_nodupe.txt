Ill be your wow gf. but im a guy and wow classic isnt out yet.

---
Where did Stan get a frostwolf tabard
---
Get to 60 casually. Get some decent weapons. BG it up. Don't got time to raid 2-3 days a week. Logging in a hour here and there for bgs and honor works out.
---
Yes and while you still had to pay the gold for the mount they didn't require the epic riding skill
---
CD Projekt needs to get on this ASAP
---
Tier 0.5 on my Druid and Shaman. Wolf mount for my Tauren Druid, and Raptor mount for my Orc Shaman.
---
Hm. I haven’t read the book, only seen the movie though I have been meaning to read it. In that case we may not see a game like Oasis for a while. Sounds like it need a few petabytes of storage and a really stable connection.
---
Huh does the raptor require exalted with darkspear? Or do they skip the rep requirements
---
Karazhan
---
Honestly? Hit 60, fuck around in Eastern Kingdoms &amp; Kalimdor. It's not the old gameplay systems I'm longing for, it's the ability to explore and do whatever I want, whenever I want in a game world not arbitrarily split into multiple expansions.
---

---
Retail is often great (not right now though), but it's biggest shortcoming is always that the new continents make the old obsolete unless you're leveling, which itself is seen as something to endure to get to "the real game".
---
Bonus points for being an adventurer again, and not Azeroth's mightiest champion.
---
To play the game
---
Can you ride the lodo without being exalted with taurens or the raptor without trolls exalted? Say if you were an orc
---
Kind of another extreme, my GF killed herself when I was 19 and I'm still dealing with it nearly 10 years later probably *because* I refused to deal with it appropriately at the time.
---
I have a wonderful GF now that hasn't done anything wrong in our relationship beyond a couple of stupid fights but as soon as any of them hit a certain point (usually when serious feelings start to develop) my brain just starts freaking out and it takes all of my effort to contain it and not.. Sabotage? Things I guess.
---
they where superrare i think, in the few months i played back then i only got 2 or so total , both world drops as i never did have the time for to many dungeons n raids
---
You should instead try an instant level 60 server and try out the classes kit there. Last thing you want is getting to 60 and hating your class in comparison to another one.
---
i raided MC/BWL and had full epics by the end of vanilla but i never got one as a world drop and i don’t remember the first item i got in a raid.
---

M...MAAAAHH

BATHROOM!
---
B...BATHROOM!!!
---
If I ever decide to have kids and during their ages of 1 and 18 a game like Vanilla would exist, I would completely disallow them from playing. Yes very hypocritical of me considering I look forward to Classic and have got fond memories of Vanilla, but I admit I was very addicted (though it was a welcome distraction during my fked up teenage life), and I think that teenagers should never touch something as addictive.
---
I understand what you mean. Still, the style sonically speaking along with it's lyrics about everything from redemption to retribution works well in montages imo. I guess what I'm trying to say is the fantasy style and themes of good vs evil is what makes it fitting.
---
I was going to roll warlock for the same reason but I wanted to be mellee in pvp.
---
eef dees cleep reaches 3000 likes, I will eet a shoe.
---
Oh my god I thought it was a thing. It's bizzare that at some point they were like "we should let priests use swords"
---
Bullshit, 10g in in redridge mountains is a princly sum, no way that happened
---
Warlock Epic Mount Quest.
---
Yeah I used to play ranked games with WiFi and never had an issue.
---
When they altered then to be buyable with tokens toward the end up vanilla you didn't need rep, but I don't know about on release
---
/r/classicwow is the only sub where I actually filter by new.
---
People used a 2nd account with a "bot" to search for underprice items and super rare recipes to snipe it automatically without having to be checking the AH.
---
Any tips
---
I just find there's a difference between saying the spec isn't good, or is even shit (which is fair) and saying that you'd be ruining the experience of anyone unfortunate enough to group with you.
---
Cool that we could come to an understanding, though. :3 I wish you the best of luck with drops in the coming months~
---
Flying mounts killed world pvp, the total size mass of all of outlands is 1/2 of a azeroth continent, with on top of this 280% movespeed mounts that bypass the world and go directly to resources, there where only linear dungeons, and arenas are good but TBC became literally a sit in shattrath que simulator.
---
In my opinion the bad points far outweigh the good, however thats why i save my opinion for replies, not for stated facts.
---
I think the idea of arena is good, butI Would not want arena que in capital cities if it where re-implemented. Arena que is like a organized duel, so why not que it in a place that will hype you to murder opposite faction or duel in the world as well.
---
Linear dungeons are fine but there should be a mix of labyrnth and linear. if I had to take one over the other i would chose more maze dungeons rather than straight forward. Variety is good and ideally i'd want both
---
Deal. Props for not chickening out of the bet. I respect that.
---
Username checks out.
---
you know what IS coming in 2020? skateboarding in the Olympics.
---
People who level to 60 within the first month are not going to have pre raid BiS. I am calm thanks.
---
Are they really that different? I don't recall anything being off when I rolled a pserver. That said I was 12 or so when wow originally came out.
---
They have always revealed next expansion every other Blizzcon because the expansions come roughly every 2 years. BFA was released on August 2018 (and revealed Blizzcon 2017). So unless they plan on extending BFA the next expansion will be released before Blizzcon 2020.
---
i agree, the itemization in dungeons and heroics is very fun. I probably should have included that in the good points. However I guess I didn't include that the levelling experience from 1-58 felt substantially worse then vanilla.
---
You gain a sense of character progression in lategame but lose it in the item buildup while levelling

It's a good thing he makes a preface to check the linked time stamps in the description for all his videos of this type incase you dont want to watch the whole thing.
---
Those paintings made the games so COOL.
---
Have you used the app ? They might just vibrate your phone on a successful action, like many apps do. But it's not like it matters. Apps always gobble up permissions and codebases are rarely trimmed and clean.  
---
Either way, I hope you're this whipped up about privacy when browsing the internet or choosing your software. Otherwise this would be really hypocritical.
---
Oh my! What a big boy!
---
I don't think it's as toxic as you make it out to be. There's a MONSTROUSLY dedicated group of Vanilla players who don't like pservers and have been begging for this to happen for well over a DECADE.
---
Then you get the usual "just asking" trolls, the "so, after Naxx" trolls, the "I'm totally no changes BUT" trolls, etc.
---
Folks that have been wanting this forever don't want the formula messed with and as much as I know how broken the game can be at times, I agree the formula should not be messed with. Not even the visuals.
---
So to see folks argue and troll the community pisses people off. Not to mention the reason why the current model is the way it is is because the game has been nickel and dimed to death over the years. A little bit of arena here, a splash of cross-realm there, a touch of sharding, pinch of LFG, etc.
---
Everyone should just leave the game to vanilla. This isn't to be messed with, it's for the die-hard vanilla fans.
---
You've got folks going in to play some of the worst specs because they think they are fun, KNOWING they aren't going to top any meter or take any name in PvP - just because they like the class/spec. That's how die-hard some folks are. You know it's fucked but to hell with it because it's home to you.
---
Let folks have their game and instead of coming down on the community from a high horse, you should come down on the trolls.
---
funny how Burning introduced flying mounts in Outland, but its 2019, and you still cant fly in Quel'Thalas or the Exodar... even though those starting zones are technically on the Outland map.
---
LBES is up there for sure.
---
There’s gotta be some kind of massive pull you can do in BRD. Lots of ledges wheee mobs will go insane distances if you pull them. Plus that place is massive to begin with.
---
My man maxed his dodge rating
---
Why the fuck would they not take the grey trash item? That's a good source of gold! Now if you really want to fuck with people you leave the cheese in it.
---
Yea i was around 11/12 when i first played and yes this guy has a really good video that goes in depth if you dont know there are differences.
---
I actually worked on private servers when i was around 16/17 myself and know for a fact that private servers are NOT the same as real vanilla. Especially now.
---
On private servers 800+
---
What's your modifier
---
It's a video game... when you see someone hasn't logged in for a while then you just assume they've moved on and forget about them. You don't need to tell them that you've left.

What's your modifier?

Rogue in Emp's room in BRD, stealthed to the ledge near Emp.  
---
Group enters BRD &gt; 3 players and warlock stay at entrance &gt; Rogue stealths to back corner in Lyceum and kills Fire guard there &gt; Receive summon &gt; Keep summon menu open &gt; Cast [Magic Candle](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1399) at a max range enemy &gt; accept summon during Candle's travel time (before combat) &gt; wait for massive group to arrive.
---
[Here's another one that I just made](https://i.imgur.com/qcXScn9.jpg), Dun Morogh at night. The only difference is the skybox. It think it really adds whole another immersive level to the game.
---
500g to over 1k gold in potions &amp; buffs per raid session when naxx is released, 1/3 of the classes need to respect to farm gold (50g) and respect back to raid spec (50g), if you raid multiple times a week that can be 200g or 300g weekly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Potions buffs for raids are kinda expensive and just get worst and worst after dm with the gold inflation, pservers usually have faster spawn for herbs nodes, so i expect it to be even worse in official servers.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEweKgWHro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEweKgWHro)
---
Horde questing is generally better logistically but Alliance far and away have better zone variety and storytelling with a vastly higher number of memorable quest chains.
---
Lol.... I literally took that picture when I posted this.
---
What a troll shadow priest.
---
As an ele shaman, hell yes I want my warrior/rogue buddies to get that for that sick as +% nature damage taken debuff.
---
You may not like it, but this was the ideal video quality.
---
Shortly afterwards: “My inventory is full!”
---
I prefer the originals. In a vacuum the new graphics are nicer but they clash with the scenery.
---
Gear up and pvp in Blackrock Mountain/WSG. I'll probably play Hunter or Warlock which were my favorite classes in vanilla, and gearing them isnt terribly difficult.
---
Efficiently
---
Are there any differences that would matter to the day to day life of a non hardcore/progression player? Im rather ignorant on the topic. I know private servers kinda have to fudge drop and proc rates but besides that idk.
---
A basic one I can think of is the room below the bridge at the entrance to scholo, it’s huge and filled with mobs, and if you shoot them they aggro all the way to the entrance.
---
Also lmfao I highly doubt we're going to be looking at 2500 server population caps.  I'm very drunk and I took two flexiril so I can't word this - but it's 2019, they already said they're using some new code for things, why wouldn't they use new server code/netcode/whatever you wanna call it server blades?
---
[removed]
---
All ammunition is stored in bags slots. There is no unlimited stuff
---
Kill KT.
---
Though if I’m being honest, it’s going to boil down to the community/guild I settle into. Was considering starting a guild with some friends, but I want to stay open to a good option in someone else’s guild.
---
You know there’s a way to keep both right?
---
Literally the best tanking weapon in the game.
---
This is false in 2019.
---
Levelling an alt is probably the way to go
---
I don't think that at all, but also I want to add that these examples are not done by a professional. It's just to show what it MIGHT look like. I'm sure professional Blizzard people can improve the skybox while also making it blend in seamlessly with the scenery.
---
 we need more of your kind,    then blizzard would  be scared and release classic quickly
---
Yea but rogues had a "throw weapon" white basic skill at some point, 3 sec cd?   
---
Warriors too unless I'm mistaken, could be wrong. But rogues did. No ammo required. Unlimited throwing.
---
Anyone remember what patch this was?
---
Okay. Which ones are generally better?
---
No world chat in vanilla, it's a private server thing.
---
Fiery is melee only
---
*sits and waits for MCC and Infinite quietlyi
---
I want to clear Naxx. Didn't get to fully clear it back in vanilla. If I'm rolling priest or mage then Atiesh is the ultimate goal. Collected most shards on priest in vanilla.
---
Bonus: Get enhancement shaman to rank 14 with Sulfuras and make a proc video with Paul Oakenfold and Soil on the background...
---
I literally am doing this right now at dinner while showing my family the Reddit page for classic
---
Wrath or Cata. Definitely not vanilla or BC.
---
Dude, you have so much free time for Classic now.

Can't play their flagship games

MMOs might get a revival when something "new" happens to them.  MOBAs blew up a while back, but they were essentially just the existing core RTS gameplay mechanics ripped out into a new game with new rules.  BRs are pretty much the same thing with regards to FPS.  Same core gameplay, but a new way to play.
---
MMOs of old aren't going to become huge again, but somebody might find a way to revive the genre and make them feel fresh.  It has nothing (or, very little) to do with generational differences.  I think the easiest connection to make is with MMOs and VR, but I'm not going to pretend to have a grasp on the timeline for when VR becomes mature enough for that.
---
For me, its overall just enjoying the game with a group of raiders. I want to join a guild and push whats possible getting the kill timer for full clears down even lower, working on strats, and doing theorycrafting and working on parsing.
---
I played the same paladin since release of classic to release of bfa. 
---
In classic I plan on playing a hunter. Ammo and pet feeding worry me though. Are they a hassle or do they add just the right amount of "role playing" to this MMORPG?
---
Well, I don’t know if you’ve noticed but... I’ve been talking about mass a lot lately.
---
Careful, I got a temp ban for linking those websites. Might want to update your post.
---
Lol no. .001% of players will have that much to spend on gloves in classic
---
If it becomes big in twitch they might.
---
Lol would be a fun challenge to aggro every single mob in BRD or LBRS. I think a geared group of 60 could do it ok. 1 Pally with max block gear and 4 healers?
---
WELL PACK IT UP THIS SHIT SUCKS
---
Not if you don't respec.
---
If you don’t like it, don’t go
---
Fun watch. Thanks!
---
Idk log in, fuck around. Hope friends stay past 35-45.
---
The book is a *completely* different and, altogether better story.  Definitely worth it.
---
I hope we have something a little more open-sourced then the Oasis!
---
I know I know, reality :(
---
What exactly is your issue with content creators making videos that are the length that makes them more money?
---
Because different people like different things?

I quit the moment they said they were working on classic
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
watch my kids experience the same thing I did 13 years ago.
---
Im not
---
I remember swapping tanks and doing a rotation so there was never really a main tank
---
Small channel I found with only 700 subs.
---
Informative and nice background voice to listen too.
---
Throwing weapons act like hunter ammo where they only have 200 charges iirc
---
That’s not in vanilla.
---
This was never a thing.
---
Hell yeah fishing. I'm a simple guy. Steamwheedle port is my spot. What about you? I also find Feralas has some nice spots. I'd rather stay still fishing the same spot for a while than chase schools.
---
Most gave up while leveling.
---
current Moon Guard player here.
---
roll a free trial toon, go to a major city in your faction, and read Trade chat if you don't believe me.
---
it gets old after awhile.
---
just stale unfunny memes and real world political bullshit most are trying to get away from in the virtual world.
---
I've got it muted. I have no doubt it will be the same in Classic. one part of it I'm not looking forward to.
---
Get to 60 and the use that character to fund a 19 twink rogue who will then camp WSG when it gets released.
---
you overestimate gamers way too much. Just because they play games does not mean they know shit all about tech or their phones.
---
I imagine there will be a lot of alts when money gets good.
---
/vomit
---
Christ you're a douche hahaha
---
Classic was announced in the middle of Legion btw. Also major dick move to leave a mythic raiding guild like that lol.
---
Shit was so much more fun
---
if being a douche means "saying what needed to be said", guilty as charged.
---
Does the flute interrupt them?
---
That's the cool thing about classic... You weren't the one true hero (although there are millions of the one true heroes).
---
I’d forgotten about that bug completely, but I vividly remember it now haha. Good times. That must have occurred during later patches though, because I didn’t start until mid 2005
---
My goal is to hit level 60! I never got to max level in retail--always too busy starting new characters and never committing to anything.
---
These are the results from the past week's votes from my previous thread, still available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhxvgr/big_poll_what_endgame_professions_for_each_class/).

I have left the polls open in that thread in case you just now have learned about it and want to vote as well, no polls have been closed yet.  
---
I love reading over data like this, hopefully we can gain some insight and reasons for why people have voted this way via discussion.  
---
Thank you to all who voted!
---
people who whine about pillars are massive shitters 100% of the time
---
I think you’d wipe for sure, but would be fun to watch.
---
Pretty good video and nice pep talk, but cmon.  PvP player not in r12-13 gear?
---
Not so unrealistic.  If they raised the level cap, what was the point of Classic?
---
You can’t be the dwarf butters I’m the dwarf.
---
Not a problem. Look up a pet feeding macro to simplify that a bit too.
---
I know this isn’t exactly what you’re talking about, but I actually ordered the WoW dungeon guide off Amazon for nostalgia purposes when they announced WoW classic. 
---
Since then, I’ve seriously used it to look up boss drops and where to get quests, etc. while playing on private servers. It still holds up and is just too much fun to read through. 
---
Also it cost like 4 dollars, so it’s not a huge risk for how awesome it is.
---
id take horde over alliance on any given day
---
Maybe I’m missing something, or I’m just wrong, but with the established BiS lists, isn’t figuring out stat weights unnecessary? There’s no need to compare what provides better stats when we already know what items are superior.
---
thats fucking awesome
---
Razorfen Downs has a big spiral up to the end boss.
---
I think I only did the dungeon once since it was so far out of the way, but something on an upper level aggrod on us while we were on the spiral.
---
I saw them as they passed the level above us, quickly typed RUN, and then I ran.
---
I don't think any of us made it out of the instance before getting killed, but I remember the tank saying "The next time Karpmaster says run, I'm f\*\*\*ing running!"
---
There's a lot of addictive shit out there. WoW is pretty benign considering everything else. Just don't be a shitty parent and your kids will be fine, WoW or not.
---
I forgot about this song. God. In its way this type if shit was just as ridiculous as Zoomer teens playing Fortnite and watching TikToks.
---
Well, For myself, some of the bad you put were actually good things in my mind. Also a lot of the good were Great to me. 
---
I'm not a world PvP person(I actually only play on RP servers) so flying mounts were something nice and actually added to the immersion of the game. It didn't make sense that my priest could defeat bosses like Illidan but couldn't ride on a gryphon on her own. 
---
While the world did feel smaller to me, a lot of what I felt was removed what the downtime moving between zones that I wanted to be in. I don't feel like that hurt the game, at least for myself. I loved leveling in TBC as much as I did in Classic and didn't feel like it changed that much. Back in the day, there were still plenty of people out in the world leveling between 1-58 and was still easy to get groups. Mounts at 30 made more sense too me as well since it was the half way point to your epic mount. 
---
I will say, I wasn't the biggest fan of the lore myself. Also, I wouldn't have minded some dungeons that weren't so linear because I love having that variety.  And lastly, I didn't like that meeting stones because summoning stones because it took some utility away from warlocks. 
---
But when I learned why people want different expansions and how different people want the game is when a friend of mine said she actually liked Titanforging which is in retail. I think Titanforging is garbage that makes gear a lot less rewarding. But that is my opinion and she is allowed to have hers.
---
too bad it was bugyy as fuckkkk
---
Some items you can farm, but plenty you can’t. If there’s one item 98% as good as bis but 10x easier to get trying to get bis is pretty silly.
---
Just a suggestion, but it might be easier to compare if engineering stayed green for each class, as opposed to green staying as the top profession.
---
Classic Hype!!!
---
For Horde I would say: (emphasis on guaranteed gold and xp)
---
1-15, don't just level
---
15-23, skin deviates for belts to sell to twinks like 30-50g a pop. There's a ton of them and they respawn quick while you wait for WC. Then go in there as the solo skinner. People will loot everything for quests and leave you with tons of skins.
---
23-30, the Hillsbrad Fields have a ton of humanoids for guaranteed silver and cloth. The yetis spawn decently quick and can also be skinned plus the plentiful beasts around the caves. You can do loops inside the cave then outside for skinning.
---
30-35, you can do circles in the Salt Flats in 1k for mad amount of skins and xp.
---
35-45, STV and grind basilisks/gorillas or just skin all the stuff people kill for Nesingwary. You'd be surprised at how many people don't skin.
---
45-50, kill and skin Incendosaurs in Searing Gorge. They are everywhere and drop alot of loot+skins.
---
50-55+, kill beasts in Blasted Lands. There's tons of them and you might get some Draenethyst Fragments or farm beasts up in EPL.
---
60, No worries about leveling. Farm deviate delights, solo BRD sections for rare materials/fiery/etc or craft high demand items. Whatever you want at this point.
---
Isn't there supposed to be a sequel coming?  Ready Player Two?
---
Am I the only one that’s seriously annoyed by this? So many gold making guides. Even the most secret of places are exposed now for everyone to see.
---
I understand that, but this isn’t new itemization. If there’s BiS and second best, we know it. There’s literally no need to determine stat weights since the lists have already been long established. 
---
You didn’t really address my comment.
---
Do you mean the stats on the tier 2 warlock set?     
---
It's gonna look like this throughout the entire expansion:  [https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=212](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=212)
---
Custom channels in vanilla were a thing, world chat most likely will move over to classic from private servers.
---
Next time you feel the need to share one of your "memes", please dont.
---
I just like playing with gear tables. Not only that but I haven't checked to see if the BiS lists are updated. Gear in Classic will be unique compared to private servers since they're using 1.12 itemization but restriction gear release tables. Private servers haven't really had that scenario before since they use patch-progressed itemization.
---
&gt; People used a 2nd account with a "bot" to search for underprice items and super rare recipes to snipe it automatically without having to be checking the AH.
---
bot, automatically? not so much. Just a normal addon like auctioneer, etc that scans the last page continually. If there's something that's within predefined limits, it makes a noise, and then it's manually purchased.
---
TL:DR; Scan the AH. It goes ding when there's stuff.
---
A good enhancement shaman has a lot of options for said mage
---
I only cleared 2 wings of Naxx in Vanilla, I want to finish the game. Other than that, I miss how relaxing grinding mobs for gold is or fishing in some far off spot with no one around.
---
Druids can 'aoe grind' fairly effectively, not as good as a mage obviously, but you can pull 3-4 mobs by prehotting, dotting each mob up, then bear swipe and thorns to finish them off.  You can start doing it around 22. It's better with direbear and barkskin/hurricane @ 44 but it's doable before that.  3-4 mobs a minute isn't bad.
---
True,  but the point still stands that we know what items are in the game and what will be coming and when. 
---
There aren’t new, undiscovered items coming that would make stat-weighing necessary except for funsies.
---
For druid it's not so much about kill time, but more about never having to stop. You are always active. Stun, shred, rip, bear, maul, dead, toss a rejuv and kitty again. Also druid can solo more things than most classes. You can cc, tank, dps, stealth and heal yourself as 1 class.
---
Wpvp was dead long before bc and flying mounts bgs started the death of wpvp and crossrealm bgs was the nail in the coffin. Bc had more wpvp then vanilla at the end due to pvp objectives that provided buffs for ppl in the zone.
---
Long-term? At the risk of triggering the meme squad, I want Thunderfury. I’ve always wanted one and never gotten it.
---
I’ve also never finished BRD. I’ve completed Scholo, Strat, Sunken, even both Spires, but I’ve never had a team hold together long enough to take down Thaurissan. This time, dude’s gonna die.
---
Destructo holo goggles on my lock...had the helicopter too...
---
i dont want to post the name of the bot here, just google it, have the word sales and man on it xd
---
I mean gay leather bondage and Paladins are a natural fit.
---
I see your point, I guess that's true. Of course it does beg the question that if we do have these incredibly accurate detailed lists of every item's rank, the only way to make that in the first place would be a accurate state weighting forumla which would be very well known and someone would give it to OP and he would be happy.
---
Horde has easier leveling, easier travel, rune of the guard captain, arcanite fishing rod. Horde are the favorite in vanilla friend.
---
Yeah BfA came out last August or something whereas classicnwas announced 2 blizzcons ago. Is this dude some sort of phony?
---
Guess so, anything for a good story...
---
If you want a good impression of what the classes can do at 60 just look up an instant 60 server and figger it oot.
---
Actually most adults don't have a problem reading more than 3 sentences. And playing on a private server isn't illegal.
---
Frostadamuz, your videos are amazing. Keep it up!

At least in the last few fights he started using concussive shot.
---
This literally took me 30 minutes to make. It’s not that big of a deal lol.
---
11 min video with MAYBE 2 mins of content and 3 mins of shamless self-promotion at the end.... gunna be a yikes from me. 
---
For those who don’t wanna waste their time like I just did: rank 10 might be obtainable and the gear is good, you won’t see AQ/Naxx but will probably be able to clear the others. 
---
Does anyone know of any youtubers who aren’t just milking the cash cow with these lame ass 10 min vids but are actually try to be efficient in their delivery?
---
This reads like the level of scrutiny you'd want to have at a prison to track inmates.
---
So - part of the reason they're doing this is because people have been cheating the system. They'll walk in as a group with badges, have 1 person collect the badges, leave, walk back in with people using those badges. I don't know about spy level software, but it's deffinitely something that has needed to be addressed for a long time.

&gt;PSA: If you're worried about personal privacy, you probably shouldn't play WoW. Not only will they have your name, number, address, credit card information, etc. They will also have your IP address, your daily schedule (He plays 4 hours each week day from 6-10 PM), your work/phone location (if you ever log in to your account or blizzard site from work or on mobile), your password (hope you don't use it for any other sites with the same email!), and any URL that you are coming from or going to from a blizzard site.
---
most of this can be avoided by using fake information, next.
---
IIRC what's makes weapon skill so godly is that it not only decreases the rate of glancing blows but also reduces how much damage is glanced once a glancing blow occurs.
---
Skinning. 
---
Take skinning and mining. Send mats to a bank alt so you can power level 300 engi (or if you're a baller, just level engi as you go).
---
"remember in Classic new raid tiers to not invalidate previous tiers"  you just bamboozled most retail players.
---
Whatever it is, the hunter in my UBRS group will find it.
---
I don't know where the impression comes from that private servers are wildly inaccurate, the values that base their drop tables on are based on thousands upon thousands of data points collected by players in retail. The health and armor values are probably accurate within 98% almost every mob. Drop rates for items are similarly accurate.
---
"how do you do, fellow no lifers?"
---
Sure
---
Warlocks are not excellent raid dps throughout. They have it very rough in T1 and T2. They come good once you get a lot of BWL gear and have access to ZG. End of  AQ40 and in Naxx they're excellent yes.
---
According to this, yes:

most of us on woweconomy don't bot, we don't cheat, there's plenty of gold to be had legitimately.
---
Apparently the server cap was a design decision, not a technical limitation.
---
I see my decision to never play Overwatch was a good choice
---
that's a fair point, warsong gulch, arathi basin, AV, those could use a rework when we are talking about classic as well
---
bullets... okay, so far a bit plain... dynamite... okay, kinda getting there... mechanical pet squirrel... uhhh 'kay... spring loaded taunt box... now we're talking! ...robot control remote... jumper cable defibrillator really??... polymorph reverser! snowball machine?! fire-breathing robotic dragon!! mind-control helmet!! Invisibility field!!! WHAT?!!
---
Wow, good argument. I stand corrected. Thanks for expounding and I hope to see you in Azeroth my man!
---
No, you can read about the original server blades if you Google hard enough.  The technology was not there in 2004.  It quickly became available.  I believe there was some design decision involved, but it was more heavily placed on the technical aspect not being able to work well with the engine
---
Anyone that can heal becomes a very hard fight. It's ok with very good gear. Bloodthirst is just a pretty weak attack without full raid gear/buffs so while your dps goes up and you get imp intercept, your burst goes down a lot without Mortal Strike and WW/OP with a slow 2her.  
---
  
---
Deathwish is fun but can be a bit hard to justify when there's mages/rogues/warlocks around that will drop you in 5 seconds. It can be very useful when you're trying to kill a healer and not taking damage, but in that situation you'd be far better off with MS anyway.
---
Make some friends and get my own guild maybe
---
Using Good for nothing cringed streamers 
---
Yeah no
---
Yeah I can't even play it anymore
---
I would say since its not raiding its part of the leveling content. Thats what I am looking forward to most myself. :)
---
I know they had blades, but that's pretty typical for 2004. It's just a form factor for servers, it doesn't say much about their individual power.
---
One of the classic podcasts had a game designer from back then as guest and they said the player cap was a design decision, not a technical limit.
---
This pirate server shit is the gayest shit. No one with a set of balls gives a flying fuck what your moralistic standpoint is of these servers. Your the person who rats our his  buddie over something inconsequential
---
Complete the Rhok/Lok'delar quest line on my hunter.
---
Get at least rank 10.
---
Finish AQ40 and Naxx.
---
I think he would prefer it is noble intentions. That's fine by me since I am such a small channel I am mostly just using it as a way to get the results out. I just want to know myself the results but extra views don't hurt at all.
---
Uh...mostly just the way the AI functions sometimes and how some of the spell mechanics are supposed to function vs how they actually function.
---
Not sure why im getting downvoted. I guess people dont really like this information.
---
I don't disagree but I had no control over the colors. Green is apparently the color for the largest piece of pie.
---
Ya, I wont argue with the pvp part since that really isn't a point of your interest.
---
However on the levelling part, what made it a lot more repetetive was a number of things.
---
A.) The quest item rewards and dungeon drops combined far outweighed all world drops asides the unlikely unique. So item progression was super stagnant while levelling. Greens and drops felt like disenchant trash. The feel of item progression changes is akin to removal of ranks in spells later in cataclysm.
---
B.) The removal of almost all elites areas of challenge, higher item drop rates of certain quests, and higher saturation "Kill X in nearby area" quests filling space like dustwallow marsh drove out the variety.
---
Those two things combined really hit the levelling hard, it went more to a mentality of "you need to be able to do everything no matter what" which is a huge step in simplifying unnecessarily too much.
---
Lead a raiding guild which kills Kel’Thuzad.
---
As a warrior I still have horrible memories about that blizzard talent. At least I know about Free Action Potions today, which I did not back in Vanilla!
---
Its inaccurate info because it's not BIS. Not an opinion
---
I'm amazed that you have the answer this question on behalf of everyone who want TBC to return, especially when you yourself didn't even like it.
---
Your conclusion "Because those players who want TBC expansion started there and that's just what they know." or in other words "Because they don't know any better" seems really well thought out. Bravo!
---
&gt; The nochanges group isn't interested in letting other players have more choices, even if it doesn't affect them in any meaningful way.
---
This is a blatant strawman. The reason it is a blatant strawman is the last clause. Nochanges advocates believe the changes WILL affect them and more importantly, the GAME. 
---
If it were the case that a change wouldn't affect them or the game, then I am positive most would be fine with it. 
---
The REAL argument behind nochanges is that when you introduce changes, actiblizz is bound to fuck it inadvertently or introduce some system (like LFD) that gives QOL but fucks the game. It's called "The Law of Unintended Consequences" for a reason.
---
#NOCHANGES (but let's be real there are going to be changes, we just want to move the needle in the direction to minimize them as much as possible)
---
I tend to be a bit ecological and put margarine into mine
---
Lmfao your not spending 1k gold per raid thats fucking nonsence
---
im playing on pservers to just help retain my knowledge. cant wait for classic full release
---
There's gonna be too many DPS, so no you're good to play Tank
---
They are not very good. I ran two Twink guilds in late classic and then in TBC and to my recollection there were never any good Twink balance druids on either side of the field. 
---
Affliction Locks were MONSTERS when they stacked spell power/shadow damage and got the dots rolling. 
---
Frost mages had tons of utility. Priests were viable , although shadow spec was rare and not really as good since you didn't get shadoform.
---
Druids did well as flag runners and healers. We had a tank druid who would stack Stam and buffs and hit over 10k hp.
---
Druids don't need pillars to run away from someone. Take the pillars out of all of the arenas in TBC and Druids would still be Druids in all of them except Blade's Edge (that one would have been too small to create space). And pillars probably hurt Warlocks more than help them. They were strong in 2's because of Soul Link. In other brackets, they were much weaker.
---
No pillars would just turn 2's into Mage + Rogue or Mage + Elemental Shaman popping all of their cooldowns and deleting someone immediately. Ranged classes would dominate. Healers wouldn't even matter. Rogues (and maybe Feral Druids) would be the only melee with a chance at making high ratings thanks to stealth.
---
I played a bit of TBC on a private server recently. The only way to survive against Rogue + Mage is to abuse LoS. If you get stunned behind a pillar, you can survive because the Mage can't touch you. But if you get stunned out in the open? You're dead before that Kidney Shot wears off.
---
Sure bruv
---
Looking like the results will be this Tuesday at about noon on Pacific time. I hope we can get a great sample size and it is on track to get 2000 easily.
---
If you built the Twink correctly, you had pre-xplored all the areas you ever needed to go. And geared up almost completely by the time you were 28/38/48 etc.
---
Back in vanilla wow, like actual retail vanilla wow, warlocks where only really hated for their fear. In TBC the trend of just hating warlocks and druids started for a reason.
---
When you introduce somethign that effects how you play the game it becomes a game function. Thus a huge part of PvP in TBC involved running around really huge pillars. This isn't whining, this is stating "This mechanic was introduced really poorly" LoS is important, If arathi basin or warsong gulch or alterac valley was staring at a giant pillar i'd hang myself
---
I mean, Blizzard really did have to swallow their pride on this one. I gotta hand them some respect for that.
---
And the montage probably was pretty easy to make.
---
i can count the individual pixels this is such a low bitrate. It'll be so weird to see modern recording software with modern internet and hardware and classic all together.
---
Umm no, gnome racials are really good for pvp too if u know how to use em
---
The 39 warrior or Eh Shammy was hard to BIS because the POD had a ridiculously low drop rate. Like .03% off the best mob. Someone either had to get SUPER lucky or farm Uldaman like crazy. I probably did that 300-400 times and never saw it drop
---
39 Hunter BIS weapon was also super rare but that was pure min maxing, you could still be great with the 2nd/3rd best.
---
Stringy vulture meat? What about chunks of cow meat? Perhaps vegetarian quelthalas options? 
---
:)
---
Then yours is a strawman as well. Someone suggests a change that would have no meaningful impact, then some nochanges bloke says "well yeah but Blizz is going to implement it this other way which will be bad"
---
Fact is there are changes and fixes you can make to vanilla to make it better, even if it's not the same as actual vanilla.
---
If we had actual vanilla, half the classes would be broken for a year. Would get old real fast
---
Bring the player not the class is good design (you never want to punish someone for preferring A to B) but not how they do it. 
---
What will be nice is having an actual class identity again. It's slowly been eroded away after Cataclysm.
---
2ice blocks and infinite kiting is hard to beat for enhancement sham
---
Primary goal is clearing Naxx 
---
After that, getting full tier 3 or BIS (or close to it) depending on class and spec
---
And of course the dream of Thunderfury, Ateish, Asbringer and Zulian Tiger
---
Yep and it is looking really interesting :)
---
I thought only t3 boots were better than epic pvp boots for hunter
---
‘Til ya die.

Just because it is already being done does not mean anyone needs to  lay down and accept more of it.  Slavery happened, doesn't mean its ok to go around enslaving people.

It's a fucking survey with 4 questions. It doesn't need a video it needs a jpg. Create some actual content
---
My Wife is with her mom tonight and all I could think about was, "Damn, I wish Classic was out because I had like 12 hours free time today...."
---
You got a guild yet, 1776?
---
I plan to be streaming classic for 18 hours a day after release (praying for server stability) with my squad. I am sure they will all be there with me and having fun. If anyone wants to join us in game or in spirit. You can follow me on twitch @MarkTatsu. I am getting a better camera and working on some fun effects and things to make it a better experience.
---
&gt; If we had actual vanilla, half the classes would be broken for a year. 
---
Why do you think half the classes are broken? None of them are.
---
&gt; dishonorable kills.
---
Personally, I would be fine with getting rid of DK's. I agree with you there. But AGAIN, we don't really know for sure what impact this would have - for example, perhaps one faction would be able to lock out a faction from a raid because they keep killing attunement quest NPCs. That may not be possible now that I think about it, but certainly there are some quest NPCs that can be killed for the purpose of griefing. That's why the DKs exist.
---
&gt;Then yours is a strawman as well.
---
I don't think you know what a strawman is...
---
&gt; Someone suggests a change that would have no meaningful impact, then some nochanges bloke says "well yeah but Blizz is going to implement it this other way which will be bad"
---
... nochanges is a general statement used to indicate that changes could *ruin* the game in unanticipated ways. It isn't saying, "well yeah but Blizz is going to implement it this other way which will be bad" as you put it. It's saying that if they implement it the exact way as requested, then it could have unintended consequences. Such as adding colorblind mode to various games often has the consequence of people using it to gain an competitive edge - which then forces other players to use it as well for the same reason and then everyone is playing with a really weird unintended color scheme. If you aren't following how this argument works, then I can't help you.
---
so is engineering pretty much a must have for endgame raiding as dps in vanilla?
---
Atleast for me the towers in hellfire peninsula and other areas really reinvigorated wpvp while levelling. I honestly think you need some sort of incentive for wpvp to exist ones you have bgs they are so much better for farming honor and provide  the pvp community alot more challenge
---
Love this post! Bring class flavors back!

hf then with that whore you call Gf/Wife....

The gaming industry has become too focused on profits and selling out. They cant innovate for fun or creative ideas anymore. They only innovate to try to get people to spend more money. All of the major publishers aren't interested in creating art they only want to make microtransactions and digital slot machines.
---
Flying mounts did not kill world pvp, if anything they concentrated it. I killed more players in skettis then I did in STV during vanilla. 
---
People say this all the time it’s total garbage, if you had trouble finding world pvp in TBC I feel sorry for you bloke, because TBC was when I had my best, you missed out.
---
I already said it was a good idea to do that too. I don't understand your anger at me saying I would do what you also like. I just didn't think of it before. I wasn't even going to make an info-graphic before.  Any suggestions on a good way to make some charts and such? Excel? 
---
Also, a secondary thought. Isn't a video analyzing and giving my opinions on the data and discussing what the implications of it might be count as content? I mean for example, what if the data shows like a 90/10 ally horde split? I think that might just call into question the makeup of the forums and reddit honestly.
---
Ow my casual head
---
Not super huge pulls, but typically a group wipe if it happens by accident:
---
* razorfen downs: on the spiraling mountain you can aggro the mobs on higher levels through the walls
---
* razorfen hills: hunters better dismiss their pet when they drop to the low ground (the part where you escort the goblin)
---
* death mines: you can aggro almost the entire pirate ship crew through the walls by accident
---
it buffed both warlocks and druids im not sure how this can be argued in balance, they are the two classes that excel in lengthening a game out. Whether they needed it or not, they got it and it was a buff. Second classes that benefit from it the most where rogues, warriors, priests, and paladins. Mages, hunters, and shamans where all directly nerfed to it. (mage rogue comp was one of the best however)
---
I remember being able to throw in Wrath as a rogue. There was a combo and finisher I believe, the finisher slowed the opponent
---
People are interested in this for the same reason you want vanilla to return. There's an era in the game that we no longer legitimately have access to and that we have fond memories of in one way or another.
---
The positives and negatives of the respective expansions are subjective and therefore meaningless. Given a large enough audience you'd end up with every possible answer. 
---
Some people loved flying mounts, others hated it. Some players found a new favorite class because it was altered and/or added to from Vanilla, others had their class ruined. Or as another used so delicately put it, for some people TBC was their first World of Warcraft experience, so it's just what they know.
---
Subscription numbers grew steadily long after vanilla. The vanilla players was in a minority when the game was at it's peak, should we alienate and deny them their possibly favorite expansion if there is to be something after the last phase of Classic?
---
Depends on how hardcore you are IMO. You can eek out just a little more dps with engineering most times but back in the day guilds cleared content without having good knowledge of BiS or what professions benefited the most for raiding.  
---
So unless you are part of a hardcore, extreme guild it won't matter much.  Most people take engineering for PvP reasons not for more raid dps.
---
[More like a freaky circle](https://youtu.be/_7FFQPmGgUQ?t=49)
---
Rob Pal-ford approves
---
He didn't say specifically that he was going to use it to level with, so holy paladin is a good pick for a solo pve class at max level with the right equipment!
---
I get that. I was just making a joke about how it’s not more closely related to “priests” given their name. But I agree, it fits.
---
The confusing part for me is that there does not appear to be any structural landmarks for each quadrant when you are in the bank area. I have to look at the minimap to tell which way I am facing and then figure out which way I need to go based on that rather than just looking at landmarks and knowing my current orientation in the circle.
---
I was asking why, not that it shouldn't. TBC and beyond all branched off in a different direction, vanilla was a slower pace game with heavier EQ influences.
---
i plan enjoying classic WoW, and then see the direction they go after that. Maybe pantheon will be a good MMO to play around with if wow starts going back the same route. It's obviously not my preference but im not going to tell other people they are wrong for liking TBC or bfa.
---
man, I just wanna swing my sword around and not be some mythical "Champion of Azeroth"
---
can I just be a an average joe guy with a sword? please?
---
you could play world pvp but that is a completely different discussion, it felt more like your option of actual pvp was substantially more annoying if it did happen. People would pick and choose their fights, literally hover over you on a flying mount and just wait for you to tag a mob. Overall i felt personally that there was both less PvP and also more lopsided fights then what already existed.
---
Going to a Tool concert in July, I hope Classic comes out during that month as well!
---
I don’t get the hate for this guy. He puts out good content and makes it interesting with his delivery. He promotes himself because that’s what you should do if you stream and make YouTube videos.

Funny when I read Purple Lady, I took it as a metaphor for an epic LOL

that is not the point of this series of guides though.  it's just food for thought, advice, and different places to have a go at it.

Every rep to exalted, going to be hated by Booty Bay for a long time.
---
Lol WoTF can be semi-replaced via pvp trinket, hardiness not so much.
---
&gt; Bring the player not the class is good design
---
This is the antithesis of Classic WoW, you know. Not saying your wrong, but all the evidence so far seems to indicate it is bad design.
---
I wish undercity had a main chill spot like Org, it kinda does but I mean everyone is just on an edge of a circle all the time

Same with mage. The idea of being a fledgling apprentice mage who is fragile and easily killed but has some nifty tricks you can do to save your life in dangerous situations while exploring the arcane arts is so much more interesting than inserted op god character who can make fireballs rain from the sky and is untouchable
---

---
Keep in mind, they are probably going to be using the current API, which includes /follow being disabled in BG's and world PVP.  Which limits your options to teams that can use IWT to get around - (melee.)
---
Why on Earth would you macro the only difficult part about being a hunter? ;)
---
Lots of people didn't get to play vanilla, and a good amount didn't in BC either very much. Why not bring it back? Nagrand was the best zone ever
---
Whats the difference between Human Rogue and Dwarf Rogue for PVE, DPS wise?
---
 It's cos the undead are edgelords
---
I think that I will start to crave TBC after a couple years of Vanilla.
---
There are a lot of things that I don't like, similar to your BAD points plus dailies, faction imbalance (ret pallies on Horde being way more viable) and how the lower tiers become irrelevant as new raids and dungeons come out with more token rewards (Magisters Terrace and ZA are the two that make me /sigh).
---
I also looove the way class specs evolved to be unique, new and viable. Paladin and Shaman specs become sooo much fun for example.
---
The raiding experience is the main thing that I want from TBC though, especially through T4 and T5 content. It was just so fun. The smaller raid sizes made guild raiding more intimate and this is when I had the best social connections in my guild as we were a tight knit group struggling and succeeding together as we progressed.
---
I also liked how creative you were forced to be with your raid composition, since the class specs were still so unique but raid sizes were small. Wotlk ended up killing this imo.

What a rush, eh?  I got into Vampire The Masquerade late, but adored the game.  Fantastic story telling, great character and skill development.  Very psyched to see a sequel.

There were a few on the servers I was one. None of them picked up steam but honest to goodness it was attempted.

I mean could you give some more details? The response was kind of vague.

When are these moronic comments going to stop? It's very possible to criticise this decision by Blizzard AND not participate in BlizzCon. So many dense motherfuckers in here.

Haha I agree with this completely.

I'm 99.9% sure it can

The Iris range of Intel graphics were a special upgraded version of their normal integrated graphics.
---
Now, it's no powerhouse or anything, but [if you look at notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Iris-Graphics-6100.125591.0.html) (scroll down about 1/3rd the way, to look at individual game examples) you can see it can play a surprising amount of games at low-medium at even 1920x1080 in some cases.
---
So I'd be pretty surprised if it couldn't do Classic at at least 1366x768 and medium-ish settings.
---
Finally clear 40 man Naxx &amp; kill Viscidus
---
Just FYI, you can roll any of the classes and put your talents all wrong and still not have messed anything up. 
---
All of the classes have at least one useful spec and your first respec is only one gold.
---
Having said that, watch YouTube summaries to find a class you want to play at end game, then look for an leveling guide for that class.
---
If you really want to dip your toes in and get a feel for how the game plays before Classic Launch, you could play a little on a private server or try the free version of the retail game. That will give you an idea of what you'll be spending lost of your time doing until Lv60 (spolier: doing quests and killing monsters)
---
Yeah but on retail they have cross-servers. In the tight community of classic, if you /ignore everyone who is doing those real world bs stuff then eventually you'll have all of em ignored. Most people won't want to start that to begin with, to protect their reputation, though.
---
Wanting to go to FP but ending at mailbox ahhhh UC problems. :)
---
Everyone is talking about how kids have been raised on instant gratification, faster paced games, and I think that's why the younger generation will love it. Having a break from all that and being able to relax and not be constantly stimulated might be new to them, and they might enjoy it. I think everyone here is underestimating how much they will enjoy it just because it's different.
---
I see youre a hunter. If someone rolled hunter but only melee'd, you wouldn't take that guy anywhere because he's a clown and a detriment to the team.
---
Nobody is saying he cant play how he wants. He'll just be playing alone.
---
That's almost certainly untrue, he just won't be playing with a bunch of minmaxing tryhards, which I believe was the point of the original post.
---
I am so salivating over playing Classic that I actually considered trying private servers. Got immediately stuck with the whole downloading client bit. Everywhere I go it requires some third party downloader to get it. Just kinda kills my desire to do that when I've got to install other shit. And I realize people torrent it but I've never gotten into that.
---
Its 99% for PvP not PvE. There's no "must have" professions for PvE, they are all nice to haves to make getting gear easier in the early phases and cheaper resistance gear when needed. Otherwise you could be all gathering professions for $$ and nobody would notice it care in endgame raiding.
---
You say that.  But 5 second shocks, grounding totem,  and purge.
---
If you preheal their combo when those finally run out, there's pretty much nothing that mage can do. 
---
3 minute mages are a little different,  they can 2 shot anything out of poly
---
Mage is tough sub 20
---
I think your problem is that 2's was just impossible to balance. Pillars don't have anything to do with it. Warlocks weren't as good as Mages in 3's and 5's. Druids were still good in the other brackets, but not nearly as dominant as they were in 2's.
---
Removing pillars would make the game worse in all of the brackets.
---
Druid is low tier in end game content.
---
Should get them to 5 for professions at least one should be enchanter.

each to their own man, I personally didn't hover over people and wait for them to tag a mob, I would KOS anyone I seen if they were my level. Sometimes they would be fighting a mob, sometimes they would have mates to help them.   
---
You're right those flying mounts did turn some people into complete pussies who would wait until you were seemingly at a disadvantage, it was moments like those that I enjoyed the most because to be the joy of world pvp was fighting at a disadvantage, using the environment around you to flip the situation around and actually win the engagement. I was particularly good at this to the point where  reputable players, some of them glad then later multi glad, from both factions would come and watch me do it day in and day out, some of those people will be the ones I am playing classic wow with.  
---
Don't get me wrong tho man I am over the moon for classic wow and perhaps back in 2005 or 2006 I wasn't good enough or understand the game enough for my above mentioned play style to be viable back then. So yeah I could be biased and I'm happy to be proven wrong, your arguments are well structured and make a lot of sense so perhaps I may end up on your classic forever band wagon after release, well that is if you'd have me of course.   
---
Thanks for the post and the discussion, you've brought up some very fond memories!
---
Poly-stun was always underrated. Mages win by a 1 shot combo with a blanket-cs. If the shaman gets anywhere below 75% its a wrap once the combo happens. Arcane blast + shatter is not anything I want to teach people but you mentioned it 🤫
---
The trade chat in Moon Guard is local server only...
---
I get to catch Tool tomorrow night, hoping they play us something spicy from the upcoming album!
---
Lmao I forgot this scene 
---
The only thing that caught me off guard was the elevator , I remember my first time going as a Troll Rogue and I was impatiently waiting for it to go down so I hit the space bar and I died 
---
Good times
---
I want to play a class that is fun and engaging and requires thoughtful use of abilities I found leveling a Druid to be quite good at that but I watched some high end raiding and it seems like the Druid just constantly spams Maul and that's it. 
---
I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions and if they could explain to me what makes them so interesting and complicated to play.
---
. . . .
---
The tenth toon on account 2 will be a level 5 enchanter / Bank / AH alt.
---
the 9 will just be campers, running between a mailbox and vendor.
---
Maybe it is because I always played a caster but item progression has never that big of a deal for me while leveling. It was cool to get an upgrade and a nice blue piece was always really awesome, but not as nice as getting a new spell to use or a higher rank of a spell I already use so it becomes more powerful or another talent point. That character progression always massively outweighed item progression for myself.
---
I will say, I didn't like removing elite areas. While I do sometimes love to just sit down and zone out and level for a few hours while listening to music, the elite areas were awesome because it did add that element in the game of people having to come together for a common goal in places that weren't instanced. They were also able to be skipped around if people wanted to just do solo play.
---
Troll post!
---
Mind flay rank 4 comes at lvl 44, and rank 5 is at 52. Those are great times to respec shadow. You can do it at lvl 36 with rank 3 mind flay if you reaaaaally want to, or lvl 40 with shadowform, they aren’t bad, but holy has some great talents and shouldn’t be overlooked.
---
I didn’t beat sunwell. I didn’t beat naxx. 
---
I’ve done every other hardmode raid in the game. But those were my end of HS, beginning of college years couldn’t commit to real raiding.
---
Not a troll post.
---
Troll post
---
First things first....
---
How many mushrooms will you carry?
---
I just think they should release the game with no additions/fix’s, but they have too much data to utilize that goes with their marketing scheme
---
Pretty much the entirety of my TBC raiding experience. Never got a Dragonspine Trophy for my rogue. :feelsbadman:
---
Yeah, no I got that :)
---
In my second paragraph I explain why I believe this question to be meaningless.
---
I enjoy every expansion up until and including Wrath of the Lich King, but all for different reasons. 
---
To me vanilla is a heavily RPG focused game. It's slow, it's punishing, I'm not powerful and I'm definitely not important. The rotations are horrible on all classes, but it doesn't matter. The class fantasies are so strong that casting shadowbolts a million times in a row feels great, I feel like a Warlock, a darkcaster that use questionable magic to accomplish my pupose. The world feels alive and breathing, everyone around me is off doing their own thing and sometimes our goals lines up so we team up and do it together. 
---
With every expansion after this the game kind of lose it's RPG elements more and more until we ended up with whatever the game is today that just feels like a huge checklist to progress through the expansion. Whatever WoD was didn't feel like a grand journey, it was just a grind that I didn't care much for at all.
---
TBC and Wrath did offer more to me than the latter expansions did. In TBC my favorite class, the Druid, felt much more fleshed out and the gameplay was amazing. In Wrath my class felt even better! Though the expansions feel great to play, it definitely feels more like playing than existing in it. Quests and dungeons start to feel like a checklist and the cities feels less like cities and more like game hubs, but that's okay. The expansions were built for me to progress towards a greater purpose, one small step at a time.
---
I've been keeping my eye on Pantheon for a while, but after 10 years of searching for the next big MMO I've kind of lost all hope for it to be anything more than X hours of mindless fun. Nothing really compares to the early years of WoWs existance for me so I'd rather invest 30 hours into a RPG or a few rounds in an online PvP game. I much prefer sticking with 1 game over longer periods so hopefully something will come along to prove me wrong.
---
With enough time and money, anything is possible.
---
Maybe if you ran it on a MacBook, then screen shared it to your iPad? Just a guess though.
---
Stock up on Winter Squid during Winter and sell for extra during Summer. They won't be worth a lot more, but hey.
---
Adam Jones teased a new riff on Twitter with a caption along the lines of "getting ready for Sunday". So you may be one of the lucky people to head Tool's new single.
---
comparing social apps to some app that stores your credit card information, social security number and more.. is beyond stupid.
---
You're telling me you haven't memorized every single textured polygon in the city? What a nub!
---
Custom channels were always part of the game and anybody could join a public channel.
---
A couple of retail servers did have the world chat, but it wasn't ubiquitous like it is in today's PS scene.
---
Whether use of 'world chat' type channels will become widespread in classic remains to be seen. I suspect it will be.
---
For every one good hybrid player there are a plethora of bad ones. The real world issue with them comes down to the lowest common demonator of player you will fill your roster with. A retarded rogue or mage will vastly outperform a retarded hybird, or they will be a benchmark for a half decent hybird to stay ahead of.
---
If you find the magic tryhard they are definatly worth the raid spot. It's really not more complicated than that for the average guild.
---
Yeah it's the fact that it all looks the same that makes it confusing, not the simplicity of the layout
---
I read this in your voice. All of it.
---
I wish I could upvote more than once
---
yes, if you don't pay to respec you won't spend gold, thank you for clarifying that
---
I want to level through each and every zone, exploring every nook and cranny, completing every single side quest. Endgame doesn’t interest me. I want the journey to 60 to last as long as possible.
---
human has more dps in pve, less control in pvp, perception is not good at all compared to stoneform
---
Or sometimes the door would just open at the wrong point...
---
I did not expect either to like that so much or have it be so relevant.  Good job.
---
FP is always to the North east. Just take whatever ramp leads up and to the right
---
Move WASD to ESDF, that gives you some additional room. Other than that, maybe add alt as a modifier for spells that can‘t be selfcast
---
You’ve got a bit of it backwards. Just go for the cookie cutter elemental spec. Elemental shaman barely lose any healing power in resto gear. Resto shaman do terrible dps in ele gear.
---
I kind of like the little clusters and small groups that form in UC.  Seems to suit the place more.
---
We could always designate a spot though.  It's not convenient, but the throne room has space and the ambiance is as classic as you can get.
---
I would be interested in BC just to experience it, i wasnt playing wow back then and i think itd be fun to work my way up to killing Kael'Thas
---
Yeah...he gave a debuff to the MT I think, they had to switch off periodically with the OT, but I wasn’t the MT priest so I can’t remember what it was, I just spammed group heal and renew and flash of light the whole time over as many people as possible.
---
Anyone who didnt click engineering, will not be endgame. Pvp or pve
---
Balance Druids offer exactly one thing that no other classes/specs can offer: a 3% crit aura.
---
What are the drawbacks?
---
* Eats up an important debuff slot
---
* Below average mana efficiency
---
* Below average damage output
---
* One 10 sec duration AoE spell on a 60s cooldown
---
* Scales poorly with gear
---
* No resistance penetration for their schools (Nature, Arcane)
---
* No tier gear
---
I don't think it's the end of the world to bring hybrid DPS to raids and I personally don't mind having a few of them in raid, but it's more or less universally agreed upon that they're shit at what they do.

No shit?

It’s a sub based game, the entire point is to keep you interested and subbed. Congrats Inspector Clouseau, you broke open the case.
---
You cracked the code, Murphy. You'll make detective in no time
---
then don’t play
---
remote desktop
---
Actually I am, gonna be a human rather than a BELF though, will be a nice change to have stormwind and Ironforge be home
---
It’s not the same price.  It comes free with your garbage content version.
---
my question is, why are we paying for a subscription?
---
You're welcome to stop subbing the moment it's no longer enjoyable.
---
On the login screen , on top of the pilar : a snake with ∞ 
---
∞ of grinding
---
You pay for goods and services provided by an entity
---
Blizzard has said that they're basing the game off 1.12. If Jujus were duo-faction in 1.12 it'll be duo faction in 1.13.
---
Better leveling yes, but at 60 alliance is most definitely favored. Also, alliance has more choices as to where they want to level 1-30, and their quests tend to be far more interesting.
---
but why are we paying a subscription? I feel silly paying for a game I already bought in the first place. I'd give them a lump sum at the beginning for remaking it, but what is the subscription for?
---
Agree. The only clear advantage I can think of where you can point to it and say this is definitely Alliance favored has to be the AV bridge.
---
Because we always have, literally for 14 years, because the game is good enough to justify it.
---
You PI the mages when they pop their cd’s (trinkets and combustion). Usually I just tell he mage I’m assigned to to make a macro to whisper me when they want PI, but on certain bosses you know it’s coming (like huhuran - you know at 30% people will pop their dps cd’s to burn down the boss).
---
PI counts as long as you use it before the spell lands (so if you cast it before a fireball hits, even if the cast has ended, PI will affect the spell). All mages contribute to ignite - it only shows on the meter for one mage.

Okay, I'll give you money for the game I already payed hundreds of dollars for you to make. Maybe $60. Why am I paying $15 a month? This adds up quickly, and I don't know why I'm paying so much for something I've already bought.
---
Their business model
---
We have for 14 years because it came with content updates which they had to create. The content updates for classic don't have to be made. They already exist. I'll give a down payment, just like any other game where the whole game's been made. But why classic wow?
---
https://youtu.be/LbQjEHTr_Us
---
&gt; 5 fucking minutes of backstory on AQ
---
Yes. Because he listened to fans of his videos, who commented that we enjoy the lore of the region associated with the grind.
---
He mentions that in the video.
---
I think you mean [lightning bolt](https://youtu.be/j_ekugPKqFw)
---
tbh I feel bad for you mages.
---
you have to deal with Khadgar being the "I'M SO MAGICAL I'M ALWAYS RIGHT AND I WAS MEDIVH'S APPRENTICE BUT I'M NOT CORRUPTED BY DEMONS LIKE HIM SO JUST DO WHAT I SAY BECAUSE I CLOSED THE DARK PORTAL BUT NOT REALLY AND ACTUALLY NOW COME IN THAT PORTAL WITH ME BECAUSE WE ARE TIME TRAVELLING NOW, JUST GO WITH IT AND THEN I'M GONNA FORGET THAT I WAS A SON OF LOTHAR AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE SIDES ANYMORE SO I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MEDIVH'S TOWER AND READ BOOKS EVEN THOUGH A DEMONIC SWORD IS STABBED INTO THE PLANET AND ITS DYING BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE MAGNI HAS GOT IT COVERED PLUS I LOVE THE HORDE NOW BUT I DONT WANT TO PICK SIDES SO YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW" guy.
---
at least Jaina had some character development.
---
They could justify a subscription with new content. Classic wow has been made. What justifies a subscription model?
---
Probably Scholo. You can pull the trash under the bridge at the entrance and they will effectively pull 60-70% of the dungeon trash while running to you, plus some bosses.
---
It's their business model for WoW. I'm having a hard time understanding why you're failing to grasp that a product that's always been based around a subscription based payment method is requiring you to pay monthly to enjoy it. Unless you're intentionally being an obtuse moron.
---
Why do people pay for cable TV when 1/3 of a 30 minute show is advertisements?
---
Nobody is forcing you to pay for a subscription sir.
---
Hate to break it to you but this is the model for every game.
---
Obviously you don't see the need to be subbed to have access to Classic. That's fine, but 15 bucks a month is nothing for something that people truly enjoy. Maybe it's just not for you? Either way I understand.
---
Oh I know why they're using it now. Blizzard is run by greedy animals. I just want justification. They justify it in bfa with new content. Nothing new is being made for classic wow.
---
Nobody is forcing you to pay for a subscription sir.  
---
See? I can repeat my argument in every thread also.
---
Hell yeah we will be, and it's gonna be great
---
You buy the new content by purchasing the expansion pack in a lump sum
---
I remember when the reason was, because they are developing monthly content, are adding stuff to the game. Today there isnt any reason or content kek and ppl still defend this greedy shits that have thrown your life game down the toilet for other país services on top of your monthly subscription and box cost. Keep lying to yourself
---
https://itemization.info/
---
Why did they have a subscription for 14 years? Because they had teams of people creating content well after you bought the game. Same with TV yes. Not classic wow.
---
There are a ton of files that are not related to Classic in the current client. This is neither meaningful or unexpected. More likely than not the  new 7.3.xxx is built around these files existing to compile the build. It does not mean any of it will show up in the game, and they won’t.
---
I would love to play the retail version of this game. It's where the true community is going to be. To me, this is a subtle greedy trick Blizzard is pulling that unfortunately is not unexpected.
---
Server costs, maintenance, GMs, bandwidth, etc.
---
When you buy and play a single player game you have paid for the hardware to run it, the maintenance for the machine since it's yours, no management needed to take care of your own issues, no bandwidth costs.
---
When you play an MP game, matchmaking servers are a dime a dozen and P2P is used. With dedicated servers you are more than likely seeing these in limited quantity from large publishers who have a consistent income, weigh the sales of the game vs server costs, rent servers to users, etc. These servers also generally don't serve millions of concurrent players at a time.
---
So feel free to pay whatever costs blizzard needs for whatever server cluster you are using, the GMs assigned to that server, maintenance costs, storage, etc - and I'm sure they'll let you play for free.
---
Shutup and take my money.
---
LOL
---
That's some new content. Sunwell didn't come with BC at first. The subscription was justified, that was an amazing patch. Now though? It doesn't add up. It's Blizzard's greedy trick.
---
This just in: Corporations are greedy.
---
Really? WC3 I pay a subscription? That's online though. League? Nope. It made sense when they were making new content. THey arent doing that with classic wow.
---
Who gonna make all your potions then?
---
Do all dungeons with my RL friends, obtain Benediction, obtain T2 chest and shoulders.
---
You’re paying a subscription for the regular version.  The classic version comes free with that subscription.  If you don’t like paying a subscription for the regular version there are several private servers you can play on for free.
---
For real? That is fucking awesome!
---
Corporations can be swayed too. People are letting this slide way too easily.
---
If you go caster in vanilla, Flat Spirit/Int gear is the juciest random drops you can get, it makes grinding so fast
---
Yeah colour consistency is so important in data biz. And don't get me started on pie charts..
---
Fucking Ben Shapiro over here OUT LOGIC'D me with pure, distilled FACTS. MUST WATCH! 
---
Don't play Classic if you have some kind of moral objection with paying Blizzard for a service they're providing, nobody is forcing you to. Private servers are free and will keep on chugging as long as people want to play vanilla World of Warcraft.
---
&gt;as quick as possible
---
Druids tanking!? Was there even gear appropriate for that in vanilla for them?
---
Yes of course. But we are still talking min/maxing where time spent on alts is significant. Having a 60 alt Raiding for World buffs and rep recipes etc is something else than a lvl 35 alt with artisan professions.
---
We could talk about the time spent and how important an alt like that becomes in the early stages of the game compared to late game.
---
I honestly don't think you would have a very noticable difference choosing something like Mining/Engineering over BS/Engineering. But of course, there is one.
---
Vanilla WoW was nowhere near as grindy or time-wasting as the MMOs that came before it. Vanilla WoW was considered casual when it came out.
---
I can agree with most of this. This is what I was looking for in an answer, I didn't realize that it would cost so much to run large dedicated servers. You've changed my mind about the subscription model. My next question is, why $15? Part of that cost was justified by newly created content. I feel you should be able to pay a reduced sub price to only play classic wow.
---
&gt; Corporations can be swayed too
---
Alright, good luck with that.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
The developers that are converting the 1.12 data they recovered from backup into the 8.0 client. The costs associated with purchasing and upkeeping the new servers that will host Classic. The staff, such as GMs, they will be paying to help manage the community.
---
Paying a one lump sum would be great and would be something I'd be interested in opting into if it was an option. On the other hand, it's 50 cents a day per month and if that's something that's going to make a significant impact on your monthly expenditures then you need to focus your attention somewhere that does not involved video games.
---
I see tailoring recommended for warlocks very often because of the bloodvine set.
---
Is there a way around levelling tailoring? I *really* hate doing tailoring, is there maybe some other +spell hit gear that can get me 95% of the way there?
---
Luckily you're getting a 35% discount over the 2004 subscription inflation-adjusted, but there's also still a nonzero cost to all of the tools they've developed to make classic on modern tech possible and maintenance for the classic client fork.
---
The point is they're not really an incredible gold sink if they're so expensive no one uses them. I'd bet at least 5x more gold was sunk in respecs in TBC than vanilla because it was cheap enough that many people respecced every week for pvp on the weekends and then back for raids during the week.  
---
Only people that played a ton could afford to do that in vanilla, so really very few bothered. Most people just pvp'd in pve specs if they wanted to do both.
---
Guild wars 1 did rather well in its time with no sub cost. that being said, the gaming industry nowadays is designed to nickel and dime you every chance it gets.
---
Very sorry to hear that,  I hope you get better!
---
Can’t talk for you obviously, but I would just ruin it by being distant, controlling, paranoid, angry etc. I realized it wasn’t the self sabotage popularized by Hollywood (even though that was the net effect) that was happening. It was me or my sub conscious telling me to distance myself more than actively trying to ruin anything. Like the last thing I actually wanted was to be put in that vulnerable position again.   
---
It’s really weird, and the only thing that really made a difference was trying to be as open and honest as possible, not gonna make assumptions on your part or tell you what to do though, but your response sounds similar even though your situation is obviously more extreme
---
You’re getting 2 games under 1 subscription.
---
Really? You can't think of a single game being released due to pressure from fans?
---
Wow that's awful
---
Why dont you just try not being a total loser?
---
Yikes you guys never played back then did you? WotF is on its own 2min CD, breaks cc and provides 5 seconds immunity. It’s like having a second trinket. Hardiness is good but wotf was the best PvP racial in the game period. Going to come back to this comment and laugh in a few  a months.
---
Like a dwarf?
---
In their fantasy minmax world - alts probably. In the real world, it'll be the tons of people doing just fine without engineering. I plan to pick up engi solely because I've had it on every one of my level capped characters in every expansion, but it's certainly not going to make or break your game.
---
Also check Frostadamus (I think it’s spelled that way) he keeps stuff updated and does good farming spots and just generally cool tips and stuff. I don’t think he farms the cash cow, but I rather quite enjoy his content!
---
Isn’t that a violation of privacy of everyone that doesn’t go? If so, why can’t I sue them into the ground for invading my privacy?

Either that game is easier or we have different definitions of what a casual player means
---
count on me to kill every alliance on sight
---
They just keep getting better as opposed to other classes like Hunters for ex.
---
I hadn't thought of the reduction due to inflation, that's a great point. Since I agree the game needs a subscription, and a 35% decrease in cost is I think very reasonable, I no longer think the $15 subscription is unjustified.
---
ITT: people who claim to have played Vanilla giving all the wrong advice 😂
---
am i being hit on
---
Gives new meaning to, "vicariously I, live while the whole world dies, much better you than I"
---
the universe is hostile so impersonal - unless you play with the wow classic community. Thwarting the universe since 04.
---
It's a mantra that needs to be tempered. Class identity consists of a class's flavor, its strengths, and its *weaknesses*. People who prefer Warrior are punished because they are not allowed to heal. Everyone considers this just because they know that a class cannot have a strength if other classes don't have a comparable weakness.
---
Lol get outa here. It’s there rules get over it my man. I’d still go if I could drop all that money to go
---
yah for sure, thats part of why it isn't really nostalgia. I just don't consider TBC and beyond the same as vanilla, my interest in pantheon got peeked when i re-played vanilla wow recently and realized how good it still is. if theres gonna be any mmo that carries the flame should blizzard mega fail its gonna be that game.
---
ITT: people who claim to have played Vanilla giving all the wrong advice 😂 RemindMe! 4 months “WotF noobs.”

Going back to redo classic is like getting a second chance at high school. I'm sitting at the cool kid's table this fucking time.
---
Why? You have a huge amount of resources at your disposal. 
---
I told you to look, i gave you examples.
---
NPC AI and NPC Abilities.
---
Loot tables
---
Spell and ability mechanics.
---
Raid encounters.
---
Im not typing anything more out for specifics.
---
This is actually one of the biggest things for me when it comes to the amazing immersion of the world (of warcraft). Everyone starts as some random little shits who randomly get slaughtered by murlocs, gnolls, gators, and whatever you may encounter, if you're at all careless. Not to even mention the random elites scattered around in low level zones. This kinda immersion makes you think "damn, wish i could get stronger and become something". You feel like you do when you level up, and again end up being a weak little shit at lev60 when entering endgame instances, which starts another phase of getting stronger.
---
None of that "Lets allow everyone to be a highlord supreme warcommander superhero savior of the realms unique snowflake, just so that everyone can feel 'epic'" -crap that retail is all about nowadays. Just everyone being a small part of the world instead, and maybe, eventually, some day actually becoming stronger than others if you work hard enough.

Pillars behave differently with more people. This is why I said pillars where implemented poorly. if arenas where actually balanced it would be more like WC3 where different size teams had different pool arenas.

Pillars make 2's extremely shiet, directly to what i said, then do become less relevant till they are mute in 5's. Once again, this is why i said pillars where poorly implemented

This is honestly how I feel. I do think $15 isn't as bad as it was in 2004 due to inflation, but I still wish I could pay a reduced sub for only classic.
---
LMFAO
---
&gt; Hardly a gold grind that is worth it as a fresh 60, that is my point.
---
If you don't have dungeon prebis this gold farm is "hardly worth it?" What are you talking about?
---
This is what peak performance looks like.
---
Strange response considering I didn't tell you you're wrong. I was just wishing you luck on your campaign. Chill out dude.
---
You’re getting downvoted because you’re talking out your ass, not that hard to comprehend. You also know very well you’re talking out your ass :)
---
Oh man I am so happy I no longer have to be content with playing on a private server. I never liked them and was always hoping for a blizzard run option.
---
Frost my dude you're about 3 decibels and a fuzzy microphone cover away from having a Vanilla themed ASMR channel.
---
Listening to you talk is like being in a peaceful forest sitting next to a babbling brook.
---
Only that brook speaks English and teaches me things about Classic wow.
---
There isn’t, you’re talking to a moron who likes the attention. Your main clue was how he said the videos from the worst, most ill-informed, money grubbing would-be content creator (that doesn’t actually produce content) would give him a leg up on other players.
---
Have fun.
---
i meant bg, sorry!
---
Just log out when you're working. The game isn't going to disappear overnight. You can log in when you've got free time
---
Pro tip: if you're looking for a segment that leads up to the elevators, they have big green banners above them for immediate identification. It saves me a couple sec each time I need to leave compared to before I noticed it.
---
While Molten Core and Onyxia are the only raids it's possible to clear everything in one night.
---
After that, once new raids release raiding turns into a multiple nights/week thing for everybody.
---
I'm already writing material.
---
Yes. Sapper charges give every engineer good aoe damage. It's absolutely game-changing.
---
Not sure what this is referring to. lol
---
Information they already give out them selves you mean? People are such hypocrits.
---
If it's something they can flame and cause a riot about they care, because they want to feel like they're doing something good. But they don't really care. Not at all, not when Instagram, Facebook, The reddit app, any damn thing you use, takes that same information and sell it.
---
Everyone and everything does it, so either stop using internet at all or quit QQing about nothing.
---
Blood Vine is really good, but if you're in tier 2 by the times EG comes out, which you can easily be if you start playing at lunch, you won't really need to replace your tier 2 with blood Vine. It is good, but the overall DPS you get from higher tier raid gear is better.
---
People on the internet are extremely paranoid.
---
I just want to play TBC because that was where i did most of my playing. I missed out on the end game stuff because i was a newb just doing pvp. I would absolutely love to go through TBC as if it were live again. I actually love the dungeons and quests/zones. I really am going to enjoy classic but I would live forever on TBC or Wrath. 
---
I think it would also give players a chance, that didn't get to play it, to see what the game was like then. Blizzard would make money ( at least for the first few months) if they released each expansion in 18 months to 2 year intervals. Then people could stay on the expansion they liked or move on to the next. I know most people won't like that and most don't want it but I would be even more excited to see TBC be relaunched. 
---
Anyway I will probably focus most of my play time on Classic and cut back on retail (even though i enjoy it).
---
2-3 ppl per guild?
---
If does have a main chill spot, it’s just in motion.
---
Pros do laps round the acid moat ad naseum
---
Full T2 for my Pally.
---
responding to my own comment because with the reappearance of Turalyon, Paladin class flavor has been violated as well.
---
Now he's immortal because tl;dr infused with the Light and has lived for thousands of years and hung out on a Draenei spaceship and blah blah.
---
I miss a time when the lore wasn't so... grandiose.
---
P99 is the Everquest version of Classic WoW. It's a very hardcore game in comparison to WoW.
---
He's saying if it's possible to progress through all PvE content as a casual in EQ it can be done in WoW.
---
To be fair when WoW first came out it was quite popular even among young kids.   
---
The ones that didn't play WoW in my school were all playing D2, RS or CS 1.6

No? Starfire spam. No moonfire.

Hey Papapag! I'd definitely recommend priest. Priest + Warrior is a great pairing. Priests also level well solo (with drinks) and are a general blast to play. Discipline priest in particular is a lot of fun to play in PvP, especially alongside a warrior friend which you have. Priest arena PVP is a lot more than just healing, which you'll find if you roll priest. It is also a fully competent spec for healing your group's dungeons, which is nice. Another nice aspect about priest.... shadow priest is a fully competent, fun spec to go. Best of luck!
---
Summer is by far the best time to game. You can sit in your shorts and chuck cokes and have a good time. In the winter its cold and the darkness makes people depressed.

#TheJuly16DreamIsStillAlive
---
&gt; Why do you think half the classes are broken? None of them are.
---
Before their class revamps and other big changes there were all sorts of broken stuff. That's where the "warlocks are mushrooms" meme is derived from. Shamans deleting people with infinite windfury, rogues kicking ass pre-weapon-normalization, broken ass CC, the list goes on
---
&gt;  It's saying that if they implement it the exact way as requested, then it could have unintended consequences.
---
And that's why it's such a great way to deflect from actually talking about it. Instead of actually talking about a specific change people purposefully throw up some shitty implementation instead of a reasonable one
---
&gt; If you aren't following how this argument works, then I can't help you.
---
~~"If you can't follow how the argument is flawed, then I can help you"~~ What a useless thing to say, you almost got away with pretending you're trying to have a civil discussion
---
Feline satchel of a thousand drip, thunderforged chest of the rap god, Lucifer skeletal bracers. 
---
Damn, this mans almost pre BiS
---
Yes. Druids make very good off tanks in raids too.
---
Damn I must have had some shit experience because I only ever saw warrior tanks.
---
Oh snap! Thank you, Bitter!
---
I'm hoping for something in the spirit of Aenima.
---
Yeah, I may have already hit capped for PVP in that setup or I was just posing in my new digs: [https://i.imgur.com/KaegLct.png](https://i.imgur.com/KaegLct.png)
---
No.
---
Oh snap! What’s the hunter hit cap for pvp ?
---
&gt; Greta van fleet
---
Eww. Nobody I know that likes Zepelin likes GVF.
---
This is wrong- bloodvine is BiS for warlock until T3.
---
That's PS only. I've never had the pirate ship and RFD spire issue in Vanilla and I did plenty of runs for friends that were just able to enter the instance (bigger aggro radius). No clue why they never bothered to fix it tbh :&lt;
---
It's awesome
---
What twitch was originally called.
---
Would you allow employees from any business camp in your house and have access to all your computer and phone files at any time?
---
Loved the references to old youtubers like Wowcrendor Oxhorn and Illegal Danish
---
It's no secret private servers are inaccurate. Dying to play the real thing!
---
Zero chance.
---
Your main goal for classic wow is to twink? 😂 yikes.. that’s something people do on retail because it’s so boring.. thinking isn’t actually fun
---
Had a rogue in my guild back in vanilla the had it, always came on top in the dps charts
---
Oh believe me i know.. i've been playing this game since it came out. I'm 100x better at WoW geography than real life. But for some reason i'm always forgetting this lol.
---
Instant 60 servers can be great fun to get a small fix without investing too much before Classic.
---
Me and a few friends have played there 1 or 2 days a week for like a month now and just trying different shit and duelling. It is fun.
---
An actualy hybrid druid is what I've wanted since Cataclysm. With the loss of the talent trees at the end of WotLK the hybrid dream died. In current WoW you get to choose one other role that you want to be a shitty hybrid of and that's it. You don't even get all your bear or cat abilities.
---
The current Lead Game Designer did the math.  
---
You really can't go wrong with either. I've played a bit of both. If all you want to do is raid heal, the decision is honestly pretty arbitrary. I'd pick it based on whatever race / aesthetic appeals to you most at that point. 
---
For PVP, that's an entirely different story. What I enjoyed most about priest is the tight focus of skills on healing / CC. You're bouncing around, healing your teammates, throwing timely CC, and controlling the fight. You are a badass at this, but this is all you can do. What I enjoyed most about shaman is the diversity of play styles available to you. One month you can be healing and dropping totems for your friends in a Warsong Gulch. The next month you can decide, F that. I'm rolling enhance and dropping big ass windfuries on bitches in Alterac Valley. 
---
Hope this helps. You honestly can't go wrong with either.
---
Lol, i still have my original jtv account. I get pm's every now and then because people want my username on twitch. I think the people messaging me might even be younger than my account is.
---
You don’t say
---
Not exactly since LFG was made global during patch 1.11, and I distinctly remember it being like a server-wide Barrens chat that people complained about and then got restricted to cities.
---
I thought about that and really like reading Karazhan, but there is a bit of tone dissonance to go from undead scourge to suddenly an Alice In Wonderland style chess game.
---
unpopular opinion: if you want an inferior product for free, go back to your pirate servers.
---
the level of entitlement on this sub is reaching levels that shouldn't even be possible!
---
I don’t care, I love it.
---
On top of that, there's no box price like on retail, so that's an even lower cost as well.
---
You're welcome! The editing on this video is very well done.
---
We're getting the very thing that we've been asking for for *years.*
---
Most of us Classic fans have said time and time again that we would pay a subscription for it if they released it. Now we're just putting our money where our mouths are.
---
Of course it's always better to bring a tryhard hybrid than a bad rogue/warlock/mage/warrior.
---
The og karazan had the crypts which is hands down the scariest place in wow ever designed. I would imagine it's redo to be very macabre. But the gear to be less death knight like and more old world magical.
---
$105 a month on WoW? Holy shit.
---
Good luck I guess.
---
It's much lower than vs ??elites, I think you only need somewhere around 5%.
---
I'm still tryna figure out how to get mine to play wow cause that would be great.
---
I really believe that you don't even gotta be an mmo gamer to enjoy vanilla wow.
---
corporations can be swayed to give away their work for free? really dude? just go back to whatever pirate server shithole you came from. your opinion is irrelevant.
---
Crit isn't important for shadow priests so they'll probably pass on this set.
---
&gt;derstand that most of this information you have already provided to the company running the event simply by registering and paying for your ticket. There are multiple reasons why this app is important, the top among them being that they clearly have had issues with people faking tickets to illegally gain access. Another big reason for this is to do analytics on the event itself. This involves tracking what you do with your app (literally every website can track what you click and see, and what website you were at before you came to their page) to better understand your interests. They could spend a ton of money on a booth that, based upon their data, didn’t gather much interest from the attendees. This app helps them to make a better conference next year by better understanding their client base and eliminating the stuff that people don’t care about. As someone who works in and wit
---
you should 'PROBABLY' know what you are talking about before talking imo.
---
Thank you so much. Also how good is the blue PvP hunter gear?
---
You're going about this wrong. Just make a statement that it is great they dont require rep to use. If you're right youll be upvoted. If you're wrong a neckbeard will spawn and bitch at you then you'll have an answer. This asking nicely thing doesnt work here. That said I'm pretty sure you dont need rep but size limits still apply to the pvp mounts.
---
People taking ret paladins to anything are just wrong
---
I suppose, but the crypts are a separate part from the actual castle. The raid is great, one of my favourites in terms of flavour, but it definitely is more comical and light hearted with the theater fight and the chess battle.
---
good question, I wish i had the answer....
---
It’s not any better than dkp. 
---
If your raid team is raiding because they like killing bosses, dkp is fine, loot council is fine.
---
If your raid team is raiding because they like purple items, loot council will eventually lead to problems every time—drama will ensue. 
---
Dkp gives agency and allows for meta gaming. I like stalking people in gear competition with me, trying to project their upgrade path, looking at their balance and spending habits of dkp, and figure out what I need to bid to out bid them to get the items I feel will give me the biggest benefit. 
---
In any raid team larger than 50 people, dkp ensures your core 20-30 are getting most loot while your periphery players scoop extras and a save dkp overtime to hopefully get that bonereavers edge or Ashkandi drop.
---
Full Resto PvE spec? Not that great.  
---
Mana Tide totem gets insta deleted, you lack the burst that Ele/Resto spec has, no real survivability talents either.
---
Good news is you can spec 30/0/21 Ele/Resto and heal just fine in PvE since the Purification talent in Resto is a 10% increase to base healing, not total healing so it's a small hit to efficiency. Pretty much the only time you need to be full Resto PvE is while your guild is progressing through content. Once content is on farm you can get away with healing as PvP resto just fine.
---
Clicking all the damn candles in BFD should get a low level honorable mention
---
Bear in mind that bloodvine won't be a thing until phase 4 of classic. That's going to be many months down the road. I mean bloodvine is really good, especially for locks who don't get any talented +hit for their shadowbolt, but that's way down the road
---
Well that’s not how loot councils work? Loot councils aim to deliver the most benefit to the raid with each item. Giving an spriest/moonkin/ele/ret/enhance/feral first drop of nearly any item is an inferior use of the item. 
---
If you want first dibs, join a dkp guild and save for a max bid. All dkp is equal.
---
tbh he mostly matches, its just all the stupid logos on his clothes.
---
BiS raiders will look much worse.
---
Healing is probably the exception
---
&gt;Healing Way
---
Literally skipped by any player who knows what they're doing. If you're casting Healing Wave it's because you're not in a raid. Literally every healer on PSs just casts CH or LHW unless they're cheesing some world boss mechanic with 8 piece T1.
---
If you are determined to go,  go buy a cheap burner phone that's clean of any of your info and use it for the app only.﻿
---
It's a good design but they removed uniqueness to each class. Which was a huge mistake. 
---
They got it right in tbc. All classes has something unique to bring, it was better to have a balanced group but any good player would do.
---
Tbc balance, talents and spells in vanilla is my dream, that would be the perfect mmo.
---
This is kinda a commentary on modern gaming if we'd all prefer to play a game from 15 years ago rather than anything recent.
---
Ideally I'd like to do some serious Naxx progression, clearing it, even once would be an accomplishment - In Vanilla I was a 2nd string raider because of my crazy work schedule. I did everything up to C'thun but got totally left behind in Naxx.
---
Ideally I hope I can end up in a mix of T2.5/T3 with double Servo Arms, or an Arm + TF.
---
But now I've traded a crazy demanding job, for a crazy demanding woman - so who knows if it will be any better XD
---
Imagine in 2030 we have classic re re released for vr mode
---
Wait but can you play classic wow without private server ?
---
Nice joke. Take your private server meta and exit my game, thanks.
---
I resubbed at the beginning of April and didnt even make it to the end of the month before canceling.  Retail is nothing like the WoW I remember.  That said, I just spent an hour wandering around looking for a skinning trainer on a pserver.
---
In general, druid is not complicated in pve, very little classes are in fact however, their gear for feral can be a bit un-intuitive. Druid is very complicated in pvp (if you're good) due to stance dancing etc.
---
Thank you for your nice job!
---
Everything .. human got 5+ sword skill which is godlike in pve
---
Its not a fixed amount. Durability of the weapon act as ammo.
---
So if you have 200 durability on your throw weapon it consumes 1 per hit.
---
Dude 
---
That’d be badass 
---
I’d wanna raid Iron Forge everyday for the rest of my life
---
As far as I know, there was a limit to how many people could join a custom channel in vanilla, and I think that limit was \~50. Not sure if that will carry over to Classic.
---
I want to raid again.  Like, real 40 (and I guess 20) man raids where there's 20 something-bolts flying at a HUGE boss every 2 seconds.  Not really looking forward to all the trash clearing, but I've got 3 monitors now instead of one.
---
Hey, you're late to this party, but I'll lay out my opinion following this thread's debate and some additional research I've done. 
---
In my current opinion, there's pretty much no bad choice for race if you're sure about going with daggers. Dwarf is probably the best by a smidgen for both PvP and PvE due to the usefulness of their racial, followed by gnome. NE would be third best for PvE, and it's very debatable for PvP, depending on how highly one values the improved stealth. I personally love that perk, but I'll acknowledge it may be a bit less powerful that the dwarf/gnome racials. 
---
The real question is: are swords better? For PvE, probably yes, but not by enough that it matters (unless you're a dedicated min/maxer), and daggers get better with later content. In PvP daggers and swords are about on par, but some people have more fun with daggers while others get frustrated by the need for constantly positioning yourself behind people.
---
TL;DR All races are perfectly fine for rogue, but make sure you're sure about daggers over swords, else you might regret not going human (if you're planning on raiding).
---
Incorrect.
---
I am not talking out of my ass. I know for 100% fact some of the scripting and shit is not exact. And some things ARE wrong on private servers.
---
Its not everything. But of course people cant use any sense on the internet. 
---
10 years ago...it was even worse where like half the dungeons didnt work and loot tables were all fucked up.
---
And on a lot of private servers its still not perfect. 
---
Hell...you think blizz gave out the actual code? Nah..it had to pretty all be redone. 
---
But only people who have ran servers and know how coding works would know that. 
---
So no. I am not talking out of my ass just because you are upset there will be differences you dont understand.
---
As far as im concerned. Nothing is exactly right unless its official blizzard servers.
---
I'll be making Bruce Lee jokes fuck Chuck Norris
---
If you're going to try to correct someone on the internet, you shouldn't add spaces in the middle of the words you're using the seem smart.  It's "methinks," not "me thinks."  The latter just looks like you don't know how to conjugate properly.
---
Had a semi casual guild at the start that raided two nights a week. We got up to Huhuran (which were admittedly stuck on for a month or so) before our guild disbanded due to unrelated non-raiding reasons (The guild master's wife was cheating on him so he disbanded the guild). So two is doable. Not sure how one would go.
---
That's actually exactly how loot councils work. The people who put in effort and achieve results get geared.
---
And a smart loot council and guild members know how valuable each drop is for each spec and prioritize items for certain specs unless the person in the approved spec is not reliable or doesn't put in effort.
---
For example, a shadow priest should never get Neltharion's Tear until all mages and locks have it because they will (and should) respec healing for Naxx, while mages and locks will still be using the item. 
---
On the reverse, Lok'amir is best used by a dps caster because it has high spell damage on it, so it should go to them. If/when they change to a healing spec, the item is just as useful then as it was when they were dps, so nothing is lost, and in fact they would likely be at the end of the line for a Naxx healing weapon due to them getting Lok'amir.
---
This is exactly how it happened for me recently on Lightbringer server. I was shadow and got the first Lok'amir. I put in effort and got results. I switched to healing in Naxx, waited for everyone else to get a healing weapon, then got one myself and we continued and cleared KT.
---
When were casters added to the arena spectators?
---
Also, which parts are still possible?
---
So you are saying you wont be joining your friends on a friday night at the Grim Guzzler. Such a shame
---
Well, that is itself a good reason to go back and ask the question
---
Yeah there's not a lot of skill in this video. Just melting people in 5 seconds.
---
Hijacking this thread to ask, where do you se prices over time Frost?
---
Did on priv servers
---
&gt;can I just be an average joe Azerothian guy with a sword? please?
---
One of the reasons I like MoP so much - you went from the high and mighty slayer of Deathwing to a regular old adventurer fighting the unknown in a foreign land (Pandaria). It felt like a step forward in the right direction.
---
Until WoD came out, which then took 500 steps backwards in the whole "sole savior of Azeroth vs average Joe" thing.
---
It's like having another talent tree with a 31 point talent.
---
I bet you that Tencent is behind all this because they own Activison Blizzard most likely to sell your personal info to the Chinese government.
---
This, but instead of black, it will be pink, purple, blue, green and gray color theme. Also I see that he has some nice engineering goggles
---
I wonder if Star Citizen probably will be out by then.
---
Quality is what counts
---
I don't know if it will be TBC but I think they will need to add something. In 2 years anyone who wants to raid will have cleared everything and done everything there is to do and just start leaving the game again.
---
Support staff, servers etc aren't free.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I lose weight when I play WoW. I don’t snack and I only drink water. Does wonders for my waistline.
---
Yeah what I wanted was somewhere I could compare their stat difference between patches, the other comment provided it though :)
---
Wrong.
---
It wasn’t so much the nerf but the bug fixes that made him killable. Before the bug fix, tentacles could spawn in unreachable places. That (and other bugs) was why he was unkillable.
---
We can only hope
---
Uh, hello? You have to Moonfire spam to claim your rightful title of "Oomkin" - efficient Starfire casting ain't getting you to 0% anytime soon.
---
While I believe the ability pruning has gone too far ,I still believe that the classes I play are still distinct "duird, warrior, warlock, shaman, and DK".
---
Originally, there were only supposed to be about 500 quests and the intention was that you’d mostly grind to 60. I’d say you got off lightly.
---
Smartphones are dogshit cheap. Even the fucking thousand dollar ones you can get for free just a bigger bill every month. Even people asking for money outside walmart got smartphones.
---
Does your brain even work? The only people without smartphones are babies and people who don't want smartphones.
---
why are his hands so tiny?
---
i wanna kill kelthuzad and experience 40 mans
---
Because Blizzard doesn't want to "waste" resources rebuilding content that people won't see that often. If you take a freecam or some kind of addon/offline server and view those BC areas from the sky, you'll truly see how broken and ugly those areas are. 
---
They ***really*** built those areas without flying in mind.
---
Legion was VERY, VERY good in terms of class fantasy. It was damn near the main selling point. Everything felt unique enough.
---
I do not think "bring the player, not the class" has been their design philosophy since Ghostcrawler left and I know they haven't outright tried stopping class stacking for a few years.
---
Not yet, horde/pvp for sure, depending on latency NA most likely. its up in the air if i pull the trigger on classic depending on my friends, it could be 3-10+ people. Im open to invites, PM of you want please and thanks.
---
As you describe, DKP systems are inherently predatory and cause strife between members. You may think it is balanced because everyone earns the same dkp, but it disincentivizes performance. 
---
If you are just there to tick the DKP time clock every hour, who cares if you are 5th on dps or 10th? No need to put on those extra consumables if it doesn't help your standing. This has trickle down effects to where hardly anyone is using consumables. People go afk randomly, people aren't focused, and the raid's performance can suffer dramatically.
---
And we haven't even discussed what you brought up, gaming the dkp system, bidding people up to get to them to spend more only to get yours cheaper the next time it drops. Flat item prices helps curb this, but you can still screw someone over.
---
All of this is a negative atmosphere, whereas loot council is capable of nuance and solving issues on the fly, and generally builds a trusting environment if you raid with a guild through multiple tiers.
---
And at the very top end, the hardcore guilds have every piece of gear simulated for each spec and it goes to whoever benefits most because every raider is quality and there is no discussion about it potentially being a poor decision since it's all mathed out in advance. Those raids are the ones that do speed runs and set records, so yes, loot council is the best for casuals, semi-hardcore and the most hardcore with different approaches for each.
---
Not just dual wielding shamans, but all meme specs because much more viable in all scenarios. It was wonderful, I loved BC boomkin.
---
Yes, for sure.  
---
My 2015 MBP runs wow retail WoW flawlessly. If you're not sure, go install retail wow (for free up to lvl 20) and see how it runs :)
---
I expect that my raid schedule will still allow for hitting the grim guzzler of my choice on Fridays.
---
Stormwind will die and Ironforge will rise!
---
People have said no, but the problem was mostly down to the fact that tentacles could spawn in places where you couldn't kill them. Technically, if you could get a C'Thun fight where no tentacles happened to spawn in those places, it might have been doable. But depending on the exact RNG odds, it could be something that would take thousands of samples to get.
---
Same. When you aren’t bored it’s easy to avoid stuff.
---
If it allows to export data, you could quickly move it to Google Data Studio which allows to set colors for certain dimensions.
---
It's strange that everyone absolutely hates dailies today (mostly because retail beat them into the ground...), because when Isle of QD was released, I remember players **praising** Blizzard for all these wonderful new repeatable quests, new ways to farm gold/rep/resources, and alternate ways to gear. Most players loved them.
---
Yeah.. that is not real. 
---
I’ll probably make 20 before even hitting 20 with one
---
Classic wow community is unlike any other community there is. Just communicate with the group ahead of time that it’s your first time doing X and you’ll get help
---
I’m sorry, I don’t speak fart noise. At least come up with specifics when you try to come of as remotely knowledgeable ;)
---
You need 40 people to raid. There's gonna be plenty of room for people who don't play tank/healer/mage/rogue. I say stay of r/classicwow for a while :)
---
You probably think you're good at the game, don't you?
---
Not to mention you can run it decently on a potato so no need to invest in upgrading your rigg for it.
---
If someone is willing to put in extreme effort to make hybrid dps viable then they'll probably be a reliable raid member so take em
---
Maybe, but I know when a relationship is superficial or not, there is no such thing as a 1-way fulfilling relationship wouldn't you agree? If one isn't happy the other has to know deepdown, maybe they know but dont ask because they perceive being alone as worse.
---
It'll pretty much be like any WoW expansion. Right in the beginning, people won't get upset if you don't know the dungeon or whatever. If it's six months in, they'll be less patient.
---
Vanilla dungeons are less complicated than modern ones. The bosses mostly do one or two things and there are almost no environmental mechanics. If you're just ordinarily competent at WoW, one or two runs through each dungeon will teach you enough.
---
Are you good enough at tanking or healing to do heroic dungeons in retail? If so, you'll probably be fine. The class mechanics are quite simple, and while the dungeons can be difficult, it's mostly because the mobs hit really hard and the packs are big. It's not because you have to know a whole bunch of complicated stuff.

You're going to spend a long time leveling up. A very, very long time. If you're paying attention to what you should be doing and what works for your class as you're leveling you're going to be fine.
---
There really aren't that many end game dungeons, and the mechanics aren't anything crazy. At the very least you're a 10 minute youtube video away from knowing what to expect of what you're getting into.
---
When/if you start raiding you definitely should watch some guides to know what to expect. It's the same deal, Molten Core is VERY mechanically easy, almost every fight is a straight tank n spank with some kind of easy wrench thrown in.
---
Don't worry about it. Play and have fun!
---
I mean... dual 144hz 4K ultrawides BIS.
---
Thanks. I have no problems on watching guides for endgame content, but i want to have a legit experience on my ladder to 60.
---
I'll never forget the night Giantstalker's Jorts dropped.
---
I watched the shit out of it as an adult. I miss G4.
---
I'm pretty sure they always had the net. They had it as far back as I can remember. Don't know about elites in the arena, but if it's something that was added in a patch along the way, it's a safe bet that it'll be there from the start in Classic. I don't think they're withholding basic mechanics, just item drops. You should expect dungeons to roll out in their final 1.12 state.
---
Im gonna play really casually coz i have job and family so only things i wanna achieve is scarab lord and atiesh. And ofc sulfuras and rank 14 to my alt enha shaman. 
---
/s
---
Seriuos note just experience content becouse i started just before tbc launch back in the day.
---
This is why my goal is Scarab Lord Mount and Thunderfury.
---
You gotta spend money to save money
---
Literally just wrong....
---
*frost aoe* 
---
delete dis, ancient chinese secret
---
Just level! The most you'll run into is people expecting you to know every dungeon. Just let them know you're new and haven't ran it before and they should be accommodating, especially since tanks are in such high demand.
---
I'd highly suggest learning how to tank at low levels. It isn't crazy hard or anything (it's actually mega easy) but having a bad vs a good tank is like night and day
---
Okay,  next week is my turn to repost this.
---
As a druid would say, "shift happens"
---
Assuming it launches in perfect condition, I don't want any updates to the game whatsoever. I just want new generations of servers to open up every so often. That has been the lifeblood of the vanilla community for like a decade, so it has proven to be enough. Vanilla WoW is sufficient in itself to be worth playing for years as long as there are resets along the way. Nobody wants to reroll during AQ40 or Naxx, but a fresh server is a new chance to do better than last time.
---
People are downvoting cause they don’t want it to be true.
---
Yeah it's not really as quite as good as it looks here, seeing as you probably want to loot stuff and you won't have the spot to yourself, and it's probably the best spot in the game for it at the right level.  
---
It is good, but not on super popular launch servers. Also keep in mind good efficient questing will be significantly faster than just pure grinding so the other specs aren't as far behind as they appear. 40 - 45k/hour (or higher I dunno?) should be possible with optimal questing routes.
---
You only need 1 buyer.
---
I plan on playing enhancement shaman.   And I plan on raiding.   As such, I feel the onus is on me, to learn all the tricks while I level up, have the right support professions I need to boost my DPS and the group's 
---
I don't like when I see a pre raid bis slot for a hybrid.   I don't think it's as easy as say a warrior or rogue.  As non of the bis do account for utility.  Sometimes you'll have to give up str for int, as being able to twist totems 3 more times before you run out of mana is more helpful than 0.7 DPS gain for you alone.
---
Nice try, capitalism
---
Also scarab lord mount and thunderfury on all.
---
I can't wait to have an actual community that isn't toxic as fuck. Pserver people are so used to having 10k populations and tend to be toxic. I'll be happy with my 2.5k pop server where your reputation actually matters
---
:pepeMLADY:
---
Like buying a Ferrari because you need to drive 5 km to work.
---
5 km is 3.11 miles
---
They make you pay for gas every time you fill up your truck too. Bubblegum subscriptions are also silly, I paid you 98 cents, all the gum I chewed is gone but you still have my 98 cents, give me the gum you owe me.
---
You would need a few dozen replacement shields. As in classic  blocked hit one damage to shield.
---
Weird how all bear druids should go enchanting and its lowest
---
This is how capitalism works, if you consider it greedy, but pay anyways, then you are necessarily ridiculing only yourself for being so weak you would give in to temptation to play some dumb game. Otherwise we pay 15$ because Blizzard knows that is what the game commands, also it lines up with retail so you can play either.
---
"feel silly" 
---
K then don't pay for it, #adultthings
---
I don't sub to netflix anymore because they have kids in drag, oh well.
---
Even retail has to put its shit on classic...
---
Are you sure that was in 1.12?
---
Oh my sweet summer child, I see you never played archeage.
---
I’d bet some money that with the current knowledge and increased player skill it would be doable.
---
faulty logic, it has always been 15 bucks for a sub, they aren't charging more they are offering more. It's circular logic that doesn't end, until someone throws a stick into the wheel. The stick is they charge 15 bucks for a sub, whether it's 1 or 2 games.
---
Actually, iirc the epic mounts only cost like 90g. Normally you then needed to buy the riding skill for 900g. 
---
The sweet thing about the PvP mounts however, was it didn't require riding skill. So that saved you 900g.
---
When I leveled on a recent server, I did wand spec then the rest in shadow like most people do, but instead of respecing at 40 for shadow form, I just kept adding points until getting shadow form at 45.
---
The reason for this is even with shadow form your rotation doesn't change. You start with a mind blast, shadow word pain and mind flay. At that point the mob has reached you and you wand it to death. Depending on your spell ranks/mana efficiency, you might not even want to mind flay.
---
In that situation only about half of your damage is coming from shadow spells and the other half is from your wand. Dropping wand spec to pick up shadow form is trading equal damage lost for equal damage gained. It makes no sense, and only serves to increase your next respec to 5g.
---
Did you allow for vanilla mob density and not pserver. How well do resistances match up
---
Of course, I will be really pissed if you make mistakes in my group, don't you dare.
---
That’s a solid analogy for the raid scene really
---
You can technically ask guards, where the skinning trainer is
---
Grow my neckbeard to 2 inches
---
Congrats you figured out what I was saying
---
nothing to do with game the recording is dog shit
---
also the fact many of the top guilds that would be attempting this have made it their job to play video through streaming and what not so they wouldn’t have a job getting in the way.
---
You needed like a whole raid to help you with this. But what about if 40 people ganged up to do all the quest together. Wouldn't they all get the black qiraji mount or could only one person in the raid get it?
---
Meant to say 2005. Was early vanilla.
---
I did quite a lot of farming back then and people mostly farm the same stuff. I also farmed DM as a Paladin and BRD as a rogue before it was cool. My BRD pickpocketing spree was frequently accompanied by a mage who was aoeing the packs. This was however changed later. 
---
What I think is missing from Private servers or rarer are full stealth runs. 2 druids + 3 rogues/druids. Our two druids financed almost their full consumables and epic mounts with this tactic. It was a PvP so if you need 3 rogues for instance X you'll instantly get three, heck sometimes they where even paying you for participation. 
---
Private servers get drop tables wrong but this just changes efficiency. In classic you often purposefully didn't farm at the most efficient spot because you KNEW that there where either gankers or you had to fight of other people to tag a mob. 
---
There are also difficulty differences between farm spots. Tyrs Hand could be farmed by a fresh 60 but can only be farmed efficiently either with specific build/class combos or good gear. 
---
In the end I wouldn't rely too much on gray drops but on white stuff that is needed. Also general rule, try to dodge AH fees. I sold almost all of my farmed stuff to a friend who was a dedicated AH goblin.
---
Yeah but melee had it so rough in raids so guilds stacked ranged.
---
You only need to level enchanting to craft the trinket, then you can drop the profession and continue to use it.
---
I know this wasn't the case on release. The skill was quite cheap (something like 90g) and the mounts we're extremely expensive. They ended up reversing this either toward the end of vanilla, not at the start. 
---
I remember buying my first epic mount with pvp tokens, and paying the gold for the training which was cheap. Then they made the change and I kept the training and could suddenly buy mounts for a lot cheaper.
---
PVP Blues would be enough?
---
Oh yeah buddy. My 2 weeks of vacation conveniently refresh in August.
---
We can only hope :)
---
Does anyone in the raid die?
---
Yes: bringing an extra battle res is a net DPS gain.
---
No: it doesn't really matter what you bring.
---
The downside for Druids is that the extra DPS from your aura, the extra healing from innervating the priest, and the contribution of whoever you just battle ressed doesn't show up on meters against your name.
---
Come home after a long day, light up a spliffy, hop on my lock, grind some gold, kill some alliance and visit a 5 man with my friends. Go to sleep.
---
It's pretty good. Honestly, in PVP &amp; PVE, hunters don't suffer from the same itemization problems that other classes do. The "all loot = hunter loot" meme is kind of true in a way. Hunters don't have to go around collecting wonky nonset pieces like other classes that need nonstandard attributes like +spell dmg &amp; +weapon skill. For hunters, the main attributes are carried by their sets which are often BIS or close to it. Even the Tier 1 hunter set stays competitive deep into the game. I legit bagged all my other gear for it and it's 8 piece bonus in my PVP/crit video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvgajLF0_lI
---
But, there's certainly a bit more to gearing if you are hardcore and want to minmax.
---
The wow community is filled with manchildren who sometimes need to have the obvious pointed out to them.
---
Still so many postings here on  raid composition and comparing classes etc...
---
At the end most raids will struggle to fill 40 slots and optimal raid composition can maybe be planned with 30 slots, while the remaining ones are filled with whatever is available respectively rather taking a good player on a "sub"optimal class than a pug or bad player on the "optimal" class.
---
or who knows, maybe I'm wrong..
---
Also repair costs. They are a joke in retail at the moment. I still remember one raid that was almost aborted because too many people where running out of money to pay the bills. 
---
And the mounts/epic mounts/bank spaces keep the economy stable in the first 2 months.
---
Not sure, can't really find any info on it.. It has never been an option until now because with progressive itemization it's a MH-only weap until 1.10. Anyone who can clear this out?
---
Still, I find it very hard to believe that any guild would allow a rogue to take it over a warrior - even a fury warrior, which tanks every now and then.
---
Wow that’s a crazy update. 
---
Great find mate
---
I finally found a moment where running my own business sucks ass. Damn you classic wow, damn you.
---
I am going to take off at least 4 days, its about all i can afford without leaving myself short for xmas. I also have kids that aren't at school yet haha so i doubt how much "quality" time i will be able to dump in.
---
Indeed a dedicated tryhard hybrid dps is better than a low effort pure dps. Even if their dps is then just on par or slightly below, they bring so many other utilities to the raid.
---
Is that Lil Uzi Vert?
---
You'll get jerks no matter where you go, but the people who genuinely enjoy classic are usually perfectly happy to explain mechanics to people trying it out for the first time.
---
You can. But nobody except for tryhards chasing the shortest clearing time do. 
---
Flasks alone can get very expensive without changed lotus economy.
---
Unless you're in Australia every day is a mixture of hot and cold
---
Man I loved Shockadin.
---
RIP in peace.
---
An interesting test for sure. But aoe-mage does run into a lot of problems like contested spots or even getting ganked. Hunters can probably match their speed if they find an efficient quest-route, maybe.
---
But uncontested and just grinding mobs aoe-mages are the absolute masters.
---
Yeah in vanilla you would have to get it, true. Still, I want people to look exactly as they are. It is hard to describe correctly how I feel about it. It is like people are hiding behind something they are not. In rpg's i love the purity and honesty. I don't like truly epic geared warriors to transmog themselves to wear dresses and tank Nefarian with a fish in their hand, it makes the game feel super retarded, ruins the epicness of the scene and attracts more trolling. From a distance, i like to be able to see what the person is wearing. Also, it makes people need on items they would not otherwise need on, just for the look of it. And this might generate tricky situations.
---
In vanilla, the best things are no transmog, not lfr/lfd and no achievements. All of these are huge game ruining experiences and if you demand ANY of these, you should know that all these have a huge effect on social and community side of the game, they ruin it and make it feel more like BFA type of dogshit.
---
ret isn't that bad, cmon bruh :(
---
Hunter jumping down after the alter activations in sunken temple not having dismissed his pet can pull a ton of mobs down to the lower level.
---
The current devs for wow are not capable of adding anything to classic that would be fitting. It just needs to be patched at the proper times and then left the hell alone. The only thing they should do is add new servers for a “ladder reset” for people who want to experience the fresh server feeling again.
---
You only have 2 weeks of vacation a year??
---
5 weeks ready and waiting
---
And here Iam thinking this is a classic wow subreddit
---
Thanks thats some good things to know. What do you mean by Hunter's big red?
---
Always remember most the people who “know everything” are a vocal minority. I’d say more than half the player-base will be casual or just as lost as they were back in 2004/2005. Don’t overthink it and just embrace the game when it’s released. You’ll be fine :P
---
Outstanding PTO gets cashed out when I leave, so yes (did not feel like waiting for Blizz to reveal the date so summer starts on 1/6 for me).
---
Absolutely not. For instance, even though I've played since Vanilla, I never stepped foot in a raid. I don't know any of the boss encounters, so I'll be going in blind. But that's the fun part about it. Rediscovering parts of the game I never really knew about.
---
I think it's more important to sort of have an idea of how your own class works. Everything else can be easily/quickly learned, but knowing your class takes  *months* to master.
---
BRD has a lot. Ogreseer gloves and cylopean band are both big upgrades too.
---
[Ban'thok Sash](https://itemization.info/item/11662)  
---
Goes from simple green to blue with hit + spell power.
---
I wish I could :( Just started a new job so I doubt I’ll be able to get any. Wont be sleeping on weekends tho hah
---
Definitely could be some gains there, I've never played vanilla or tbc ret so it was all new to me. I read BoW, Sancticty Aura, Judge on HoJ/when SoC running out and use HoW was the way to go but yeah, felt like hard work. You do randomly completely blow up a mob with you get SoC/Judge crit with vengeance up, but then there's really sad times when it seems like nothing procs or hits.
---
Employ someone to run it for you
---
To be fair, that's something that if you just play well, will happen.
---
I really want to get Ashkandi :3
---
I got hunter to 23 kills with a pet with no armour/stam training, so I think 25 or 26 would be quite likely if you played well depending on gear.
---
Imagine conflating TBC and WotLK with Vanilla.
---
Hardiness is better, unlucky.
---
The only analogy I can think of is the medical field. The best doctors in 2019 are not the ones who remember everything from med school, but the ones who can find the best answer in the quickest time.  
---
Make up for your lack of knowledge by exercising great research and listening skills and you will catch up very quickly. Vanilla WoW is not complex by any means. Humble yourself and accept your role as a student to those who have played the game extensively.
---
I had some 15 upvotes before his fanbase came in with the downvote train, so I know I'm not alone in having that opinion.
---
Who needs to waste vacation on classic when you can just not sleep?
---
Good bot!
---
As soon as it's announced, there will be Australian laughing his ass of while booking his long service leave for a sweet 12 weeks of paid leave.
---
That's what I really loved about vanilla... You weren't "champion", "hero" or any of the other intense adjectives used to describe the player. 
---
You were just "troll" or "mage" for instance. People wanted your help but didn't expect you to single-handedly liberate universe from the burning legion.
---
Having Sylvanas, Thrall, Vol'jin, etc all looking up to me, or at least at eye level with me just feels wrong. I'm not the hero you all think I am.
---
Just curious, wouldn't your warriors &amp; other mdps have priority on something like that (if both shards even drop considering they have like a 5% drop rate each)
---
Keep talking like that and blizzard will slide in that cash shop
---
This should be like an ad for people to lose weight. Instead of the shitty "DRINK A CUP OF VINEGAR A DAY AND YOULL LOSE 20 POUNDS".    
---
It can be like play wow and watch your weight disappear (your life but still)
---
I wouldn't mind new content or balance changes added to the game after classic is "done". 
---
However, this creates a problem, because I also think in that case they should keep their existing classic servers pure vanilla and also keep rolling out fresh servers for those who want to reexperience a fresh server. But this means that Blizzard most likely won't do this because it involves splitting classic into two different games and adding multiple servers for both. So this is unlikely. 
---
Hence, I think blizzard would never take the risk of changeing classic and won't waste their resources on making a second version of classic.
---
You best believe the hard spots to fill will not be DPS slots.  
---
There's going to be more than enough mages, warriors, and rogues to fill every raid in terms of dps.
---
Yeah I get 25 annual leave + 8 bank holiday + time overworked + queens birthday and im from UK
---
No. Blizzard actually admitted this themselves on the forums, and then shortly after patched it (something to do with tentacles not spawning after a phase iirc)
---
True man, it's more than just a game!
---
I know.  I had just flown from Stormwind to Hillsbrad and didn't want to fly back, so I was hoping there'd be one there, then in Menethil, then in Theramore.  I turned in Qs along the way so it wasnt a total bust.  Eventually I got to Hinterlands, yay!
---
The phone game uses a lot of the content from DK1&amp;2, it's not just slapping a name on an unrelated game, but it's still nothing like the originals in gameplay.
---
People are different. Ignore the idiots, play with those who let you play and learn.
---
As good as tier 1 Mage.
---
It's all fun and games until Frost Nova is resisted by 1-2 mobs 😂
---
Yeah I would highly recommend for Mages to skip on going AoE builds. It's totally an established PServer thing.
---
This dude simply knows more than you, and the joker you are currently engaged in a cirklejerk with.
---
2017, Blizzard said "They look into the matter", they didn't specify in what way. It could've been the next lame Timewalking bullshit.
---
2018, theyannounced dedicated classic servers, including specifications for content schedule, overall philosophy, and gave us a (albeit vague) release date.
---
So, congratulations on your self-humiliation. You may now proceed with the CJ to feel less ashamed of yourself.
---
See above reply. You two are just sad.
---
Definitely doable. Just need a few attempts and some good RNG.
---
The extra mob killing is intended to make you grind more to fill in the xp gap between quest turn ins. It’s not to keep you subbed longer lmao
---
FYI at that time WoW was actually very forgiving in terms of being “grindy” for a MMORPG
---
That’s TBC. In vanilla it works exactly as Hunter ammo.
---
General/trade in cities has always been pretty shit. Barrens chat was similar but still held a soft spot in my heart. Chats in the actual zones tended to be a lot more friendly though.
---
sad little man :D
---
You’ve apparently not played on private servers
---
Maybe too opinionated but incorrect? He isnt going to raid with 21 pts in resto. If you want to raid and pvp resto is the best choice. You arnt farming 100g a week for respec until late into 60 life. You wanna go deep on all the situations you find yourself in pvp and discuss what's best I'm down but the simple answer to resto sham in spell power gear is yes, they are beastly. Iv played the full 2.5 aq geared ele sham it's fun, I found myself to be more useful as resto. Maybe just my playstyle.
---
Barov peasant caller was fun and also the cannon from Strat live. These were trinkets tho, I don’t recall any stand alone “toys” unless you were an engineer. Also there was a underwater breathing staff from Gnomergan that was dope. Tons more, but just some from the top of my head (;
---
Bro twinking is definitely a thing in vanilla..and it actually is fun gearing up an OP low level toon, the world pvp is really fun too. *Laughing until Im crying emoji* Lettuce Mayonnaise and Onions
---
I feel like you haven’t been subbed to this group very long to even ask this question... it’s almost an everyday thing where people ask blizzard to please release a date finally so they can cash in on this exact question and even to the point where people have said they had to “pull the trigger” and take time off in hopes it will be out when they get the time off due to how long they had to request off in advance....
---
Y'all get vacation time??
---
I've pulled every enemy in BRD on a private server. I can tell you there's not a chance in hell you're living through it. I don't think even a 10 man raid could survive it. It's constant stun lock from hell.
---
[Gyth's Skull](https://itemization.info/item/12952) gets a pretty big one. I wasn't even aware of this one because pservers usually leave the updated version even on progressively itemized servers. I had to actually research old loot tables to confirm it was a trash green before 1.10
---
50 cents per mana pot? I’m down just don’t give anyone else that deal.
---
It's not completed, but Star Citizen may fit close to the bill..?
---
Once you’re geared on your main, twinking is a very fun side hobby. I had a 29 dwarf hunter in vanilla and it was a blast (sry for the pun).
---
BRD items got a fair few updates.
---
I’m definitely interested in how rogue does here.
---
Wouldn’t be easy to set up but I’d also be interested in which duos perform the best.
---
I think it might be possible to pull lbrs from ubrs. Maybe if you have an active hot on you, get knocked off the bridge and use slow fall or something to survive the fall, get hit by the mobs in lbrs and healer gets the aggro from your active hot.
---
&gt; * Eats up an important debuff slot
---
&gt; * No resistance penetration curse for one of their schools (Nature)
---
These aren't real. Starfire is not affected by either of these, and your rotation is Starfire only.
---
They just killed off Tirion. That was the first line.
---
I am curious: what media do you feel is worthy of shedding tears over? Movies? Books? How about music? What is the threshold?
---
Or is your incredulity actually about grown men being emotional? I (a man) would say that as I have gotten older my capacity for empathy has only increased. When I consume media in my thirties that I had previously consumed in my teens I find myself crying at things that did not move me when I was younger.
---
When it comes to games, I do not think I have cried over World of Warcraft, but I have cried to: Gris, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Firewatch, The Walking Dead, and Final Fantasy VII among others. That Dragon, Cancer does not make the list because I have not yet brought myself to play it. Should I feel shame about this?
---
Trying to decide between Mage or Priest. Also trying to decide if I should go with the PvP option/what looks the best and go Undead, or if I should Min Max and go Troll. Ill be playing a lot so having either as an alt would be possible, however I would love to hear some pros and cons and decide on one main. 
---
I love PvP and I love dealing damage and topping damage meters. However I also really like healing and the idea of being more desirable for dungeons/raids. 
---
Whats concering me with rolling Priest is that I might really screw myself over in the PvP department. Im not so sure I want to constantly respec to get kills. Ill also be playing solo and I imagine there will be less I can do in world PvP on a Priest. Thats why I feel like Id have a better time leveling on a Mage. I also dont like the idea of having to go and beg for water if I play a Priest. 
---
I feel like if I play Mage Ill have a good time in PvP and just in general. However I feel like a big part of me will miss healing too much? But if I go Priest I cant earn as much and easy money as I would on a Mage. Nor would I be able to defend myself as easily. Help! :(
---
I love meme specs. I heard someone mention a gear set that a shadow priest could use to get physical damage reduction at above 57%. Thus making it quite tanky, coupled with mindflay spamming for aggro. Haven't seen it since. Does anyone know what it was?
---
As a magic tryhard ret paladin, I can tell you that this guy is spot on.
---
Loved legion so much. Haven't had that kind of fun since Vanilla.
---
Would you like to add a WoW token to your order today sir? You could suckle mana pots all week if so!
---
At Blizzcon they said they're going to use the modern API but will put restrictions on functions they feel don't belong to Classic.
---
They didn't specify exactly what but it's very possible that anything LFG related will be restricted since it didn't exist back then, so I don't think those addons will work.
---
I know I wont. I'm going to run a guild and all I expect is for people to be willing to learn and practice.
---
Hell I don't know everything either a lot of things I havn't done in years.
---
If you don't know something just ask. If your in a dungeon just let everyone know that your new. If they are interested in a smooth run then its in their interests to get you up to speed to a certain extent.
---
Yeah..well... your video games cost more so.. take that.
---
There is details left out.  You are no longer druid, warrior, ect.
---
You now feel like an feral, balanced, guardian, resto druid. or Fury, Arms, Prot, warrior.     You cut the full "Druid, warrior" feel for a piece of it.
---
I think something to keep in mind that not all hybrid specs are created equal. 
---
I would say Balance Druid, and Ret/Prot paladin have the hardest time justifying a raid position.  Balance druid is really bad because of their mediocre dps and their mana issues aren't offset by the 3% crit to the party and battleres (they will probably use innervate on themselves if they want to keep doing dps after a few seconds).  Prot paladins because they don't have very much dps at all when they aren't tanking, or their tanking might be iffy if they are something like 30/21/0.  Ret just doesn't do damage.   
---
Shadow priests are probably in the middle ground.  They're a little better than balance druids, and they bring a buff to all the warlocks.  But it's a struggle doing decent dps as a spriest without being given a debuff slot (since so much of their damage and efficiency comes from SW:P).  But they deal more damage than druids and shadow weaving is better than moonkin aura.  
---
Then there are the Ele/Enh Shamans and Feral Druids, which I think are the most viable as non-healer positions.  Ele and Enhance bring windfury totems and totems in general are just really good for raids.  Honestly, you could bring all resto shamans, but you don't want all your healers to be shamans in a raid, I don't think.  It would be really nice to have at least 4-5 groups with shaman totems.  Particularly for the tank group and any melee dps group.  That leaves some justifiable slots for enh or ele shamans I think.  
---
Then feral druids I think also have a place.  Some encounters they actually make decent main tanks on (particularly resistance based encounters like Huhu), and they also make fine offtanks.  One of the nice things about a feral specced druid as offtank is that when they aren't tanking if they have decent dps gear set to switch to they will put out reasonable dps (though less than a true dps, way better than a prot paladin, and probably competitive with an offtank warrior).  
---
Anyhow, those are my thoughts on hybrids in wow.
---
That was also my first epic in vanilla... Got it somewhere Feb '05. Sold them for 30G. I had no idea at the time how valuable they really were... No one did. Biggest regret I ever had in terms of lost potential to this day.
---
if they did august id be really dissapointed. the whole point of a classic summer is to have the whole summer, not barely half of it..
---
Insane for warriors:
---
https://itemization.info/item/13142
---
BoM is better because you do pretty much nothing but auto-attack IMO
---
Then you're doing something wrong :-) I run my own business too and I can play as much as I want (and still keeping up the business)
---
Huh? Your abilities and talents were gimped to enforce the legendary system.  They even took out warrior stances for crying out loud.
---
Realistic - to main tank Rag.
---
Hopefully - to main tank progression through the whole raid cycle.
---
1. I'm part of a guild, yes.
---
2. Pretty much planning to devote 90% of my wow time to classic but I won't *completely* leave retail. 
---
3. Guild won't suffer for it, I'm not one of the main raiding slots. They pretty much know my intentions. 
---
4. Not that I'm aware of.
---
I read some of the manual while heading home &amp; installing.
---
"Enchanting requires some herbs."
---
So I had an Enchanter/Herbalist because of the manual. Eventually dropped Herb for Engi because Engi seemed fun (It was).
---
I think there was a single enchant that required one Peacebloom or something. Definitely not enough to need Herb with Ench.
---
Engineering seems to be the favourite endgame profession. I guess Mining would be its ideal companion?
---
Feral is not bad against two IMO, if you switch to bear of course. Why do you consider wanding a Con? I mean, what's not to like? You start 5 second regen counter, it is still good dps at 45. Also ret is shockingly low!
---
wat
---
Yeah normally they do, but I have subbed for wow with gold for a few years now. And I don’t even play that much.
---
Thunderforged? This ain't Pandaria lad.
---
And the winner for least effort is...
---
Nokia 6310 is powered by Sisu and Perkele.
---
yeah I think most people would consider a "classic summer" to at least start at the end of july, at the latest
---
10 minute sample time is way too tiny to draw any meaningful conclusions, especially frost which has to wait on respawns.
---
They could give us more info tomorrow for all we know.
---
i remember when i could tell whether or not people were just being retarded on purpose
---
Wrong. It's a population thing. Faxmonkey has been a thing since basically the beginning of wow.
---
You just won't ever get the chance to do aoe on a fresh server.
---
Shadowpriest is a wpvp monster, you cant go wrong on that. You can always farm herbs for cash
---
The complicated thing about feral druids is getting a raid spot and tryna stealing gear from rogues
---
Human pve dwarf pvp, gnome for the looks
---
&gt;good Guildmasters should understand and even anticipate that people are going to leave the guild/quit playing the game. 
---
Yes (i strongly implied this too)
---
&gt;  often without notice 
---
No
---
The attitude of "it's just some dude/dudette on the internet" is problem. Egoistic.  
---
Let us say you were playing on the local soccer team and had a match on sunday you were supposed to go to. On friday, you heard about a new baseball team starting up in town. You always wanted to play baseball and finally you had the opportunity - actually you'd lost interest in soccer now.
---
What would you do? Call your soccer coach and tell him that you had decided to stop playing? Or would you just not show up, don't pick up your phone and think to yourself "those were just some dudes i used to play soccer with"?
---
Cata still had talent trees
---
Do the full Paladin experience that was taken from me when my BC level 56 Paladin Holysmitey was hacked and turned into a gold farming account back in 2007.
---
I want Judgement armor. Eventually Corrupted Ashbringer too all while joining a raiding guild and hopefully experience something i feel i missed out on all those years ago.
---
Oh and actually level professions this time as i understand how it all works now
---
2 months 4 days continuous paid vacation booked, I hope the release date aligns well with that
---
I want to be as good as my favorite twitch streamer Asmongold
---
How contested are herbs? And realistically how likely am I to be able to make decent money from it with all the other players roaming around? Never done herbalism before. Also how do you go about getting your Epic Mount fast as a Priest?
---
Can someone remind me how leveling fishing worked? I leveled it, but wasn't really a fan, and it's been too many years to remember. :)
---
Could I level fishing right to 300 in a lowbie fishing pool? Or did I need to move to a higher level fishing area?
---
From memory (my crap memory) you could level fishing right up in your lowbie area, but it was beneficial to be in higher areas for the more useful fish.
---
Its a real burden. Specially ammo. If you run out, youre just dead weight on a group.
---
Pet isnt as necessary tho, I simple go petless on raids and 5 man, only call it if necessary offtanking
---
While in Vanilla I got 2 epics in the same day. Lifestone and Destiny! Both at Eastern Plaguelands, the same day. It was unbelievable since it was my first time looting an epic.
---
I dunno if I'd trust them not to muck it up to be honest, but I'd be open to them trying things out on separate servers. 
---
Frankly what I'm really hoping for is Classic to be such a success that Blizzard realizes they need to go back to their roots a bit with retail wow.
---
Theres no arena pvp on classic.
---
Paladin is the best Warrior friend on classic. It might be 1 button healer (on raids) but you have the biggest array of buffs any class can bring, pve and pvp. And Pally has the most lasting mana pool of any other healer.
---
No it wasn't. Look at other videos from that era lol.
---
Exactly. Barrens chat is in our hearts, we just have to unleash it once more.
---
I heard it has been used to fend off bears.
---
Mine was a Glowing Brightwood Staff I bought for 300g in TBC.
---
It would probably be right around the warrior's numbers depending on gear/spec. 
---
Warrior is actually pretty strong in the 40s if you have a good weapon and replace most of your mail with plate but rogue would probably be more consistent/faster with basic questing gear thanks to cooldowns and poisons. 
---
No way it's going to be faster than mage/warlock though and the difference was less than 2k xp/hr between the warrior and mage/lock in the OP's tests.
---
Pretty sure.
---
no he probably won't really be playing with much of anyone, this isn't like trying to play a ret paladin or something that's even 50% effective, this is being a melee warlock or something roughly 10% effective
---
this is actively refusing to contribute purely to be a special snowflake
---
Ah and why donu call it justin tv? U want to impress with your knowledge.. i seeeeee
---
:(
---
Well if they have beta in the early summer and release later it could be called "classic summer".
---
No it isn't, you clearly haven't read any of the thread, have fun playing your warrior or feral druid, hyperbole isn't your strong suit.
---
How do you think antivision-blizzard get tax breaks not just tax breaks they even get tax returns? You think those are for free?
---
Remember: When you are having fun you are most vulnerable.
---
Dat -1 int tho..
---
more like classic bullshit if thats the case
---
Lmao how much of a dunce do you have to be to think feral druid is the pinnacle of min maxing? I love when people try to be condescending and reveal they know nothing.
---
SPARTANS !!!! .... WHAT IS YOUR PROFFESION ????
---
If you don't know the dungeon or are a bad tank, don't go in as a tank. Try and find a slot as a dps, it's only common courtesy towards your party.
---
they still go for 800+ gold on servers with low pop
---
Oh yea. My retail guild's structure, and probably most others, isn't even compatible with classic. Though was hoping I might have some known entities to level with and maybe group package deal into a guild, but play what you like for sure. Not really going to hurt my enjoyment.
---
I revealed the OP's point. Some of the folks in this sub act like absolute douchebags over a fourteen year old game.
---
in my experience, even the more knowledgeable players are pretty patient and helpful. Don't be afraid to ask questions or make it known that you're not sure what to do.
---
It has never been a problem for a NE priest to find a guild on any private servers, I do not see why classic should be different.
---
Hopefully they do and move into TBC as soon as possible, while still giving you the option to play on pure vanilla servers ofc.
---
My plan is to go mining because everybody and their brother seems to be planning on going engineering.
---
Sure but that could be the case how they think in Blizz.
---
So i was in a confusing moment for a while what to pick as my profs. This chart actually gave me a reason to do alc/herb instead of engi (As i always been but this time i wanted a diff flavor) and wasnt sure what to pick instead. Thanks!
---
&gt; Also do you think that there wont be any beta test or something?
---
I do not think there will be a beta. I think they're confident in their method of using the 1.12 reference client, and they aren't necessarily building new mechanics they haven't built before. Mechanics of Classic are simple compared to some of the theatrics they put together in retail.  
---
In addition to that, I think Blizzard wants to see some tourism dollars. Blizzard understands there is a certain tourism market for Classic. I'm not talking about retail tourists, but tourists from other games and from vanilla's past. These people will play Classic to see what all the hype is about and also to chase old highs. The people that don't stick around will still have to pay that first month's fee. If they run a beta, people might just discover they don't like vanilla without having to pay the fee.
---
In Vanilla it takes a long time to form a group and run to the instance. You can't easily replace a player or leave for another group. Players understand that you have to communicate with eachother and give advice to people who need it. Just let people know that it's your first time doing an instance and they will explain what you need to do. If you are willing to communicate and learn you will do fine.
---
Demonshear (dropped from Balnazzar in Strat Live)
---
1.9 -- 99-149, 2.3 speed 53.9 DPS , chance on hit: 150 shadow damage + 8 damage per 2 seconds for 30 seconds
---
1.10 -- 163-246, 3.8 speed, 53.8 DPS, chance on hit: 150 shadow damage + 40 damage per 2 seconds for 6 seconds.
---
Massive change.
---
i wouldn't call them 'trees', in cata they introduced primary spec and mastery - a typical build looked like 31/10 and you couldn't really skip the last point as it rounded out any build. 
---
A hybrid druid in vanilla was more like 29/11/11, no one missed moonkin form and it allowed for pvp shenanigans - 8/22/21 made for a mobile flag carrier with nature's swiftness and 24/0/27 let you heal in a raid and have damage above that of a wet noodle, too
---
In post classic, that basically translates to "doesn't matter what class you choose because they are all the same so no one if offended"..
---
I can agree with that. 
---
I think he should be banned for gatekeeping because he is using oldschool knowledge so the newer people wont understand.
---
https://itemization.info/item/13178 becomes the second best healing ring pre-MC after originally having bizarre stats.
---
Rogues aren't all that great at straight up constant farming, especially in phase 1. They're a gear dependant melee only class with no self-healing, so the Tailoring plan doesn't seem that great. Killing a single Devilsaur every few minutes when your CDs are up should be totally doable though.  
---
If you're set on making gold with professions (you could always do pickpocket runs in BRD for decent and extremely reliable income - it's economy-proof, luck-proof and instanced), I'd suggest Skinning/Mining. Do a lap of Un'Goro for Devilsaurs and Thorium, then do a lap of Silithus for more Thorium - you're one of only two classes in the game that has stealth and gets to skip past all the elite mobs and mine in the bug hives there.
---
It's just not realistic, you need every piece to fall into place. If mob resists nova, if you get ganked, if there are any other people in the area, if you make any mistake with your blizzard placements. If any of these things happened your kills per minute plummet and it would have been faster to single pull with shatter talented.
---
I want to know the Warriors going with Tailoring
---
Naxxramas 10 man
---
I don't know what you think the age of the game has to do with refusing to make an effective character. Why do you think you're entitled to other people carrying you through content?
---
Did vanilla used concept of ilvl and item budget? Those stats seem very random.
---
Hmm very true. Maybe a beta for subscribers?
---
I won't take a single day off for Classic. Unlike my 15 year old self, I have a life now - things to do outside video games. Have fun though.
---
I bet he was really excited about posting this thinking he'd reinvented the wheel or something.
---
I specifically got laid off with unemployment running out in November. I really hope it doesnt release as late as August.
---
I prefer the old skyboxes. Add it as a toggle. Or don't add it at all. Happy either way.
---
Reeeeee
---
Agreed. $3.50c weekends instead of $350 spent on shit cocaine 😀
---
I'm targeting 2 weeks off with a week of work in the middle. My health hasn't been great the last couple years. I took a week for BFA release and that felt about my limit of 18+ hr gaming days with odd sleep times. So will work a week in the middle to get back on schedule a bit and hopefully force 8 hrs of sleep.
---
Sounds like a hunter pet that does less damage, takes more damage and needs to drink between every pull
---
Why is cap America is on the thumbnail tho?
---
Moon Guard is also the meme server. You’re gonna get that more than the typical Classic server.
---
What’s the best?
---
I'm sorry, this is too low effort and has been removed.
---
You're missing the entire point. I'll concede the argument.
---
You can't rez up a dps on every bossfight. On a good run a raid is over in 1-2 hours, thats 4 rezzes at best.
---
Yeah once you had all of your artifact abilities unlocked + BiS legendaries that added crucial abilities.
---
Fordring's Seal from In Dreams: https://itemization.info/item/16058

Rosewine is even arguably better than that.
---
I‘m all fired up now
---
To be fair, other contemporary MMOs at the time were copying and improving on blizzards design. If blizzard hadn't changed WoW then people would have left for other games. The grind-based punishing MMO style wasn't acceptable after WoW became popular and introduced the idea of a "casual MMO". Honestly this "decline" that people say WoW has had since vanilla has been happening since WoWs conception because the design of the game itself invited these changes across the whole industry.
---
There are much better ones available
---
&gt;company wants to collect data
---
Oh my god, I never thought about that. Do you seriously think tracking in-app behaviour is malicious ? Even Reddit does that stuff.
---
Why won't you answer the question? Where does the sense of entitlement even come from?
---
Please use our weekly LFG sticky thread or our Discord's recruitment channel.
---
&gt;Any idea how much gold per hour pickpocking in BRD makes? The skinning and minning sounds great for what you suggested. Thank You
---
Famous Blue Raincoat. I listened to a lot of Leonard Cohen while farming.
---
Different devs, different vision. Vanilla content was relevant for it's whole life mostly because of not so much catch up mechanics. Itemization was HORRID but it actually helped the game by making it relevant and heavily boosting the RPG element.
---
Now im supposed to trust current blizzard to release new content, which will require even harder work than Retail? Nah sorry. Making horrid items to be in check with the items of old will require something i would only trust the team from 2005.
---
One mistake and they might turn the game into "level to 60, do this new content and never do anything else but naxx". I already have PTSD from the times ToC and IC  dungeons got released, making the rest pointless and braindead easy. 
---
So no, i dont want anything. But since this is yet another "my opinion wont hurt the game" i'd go with seasonal server restarts each 3 years.
---
I mean i already see "blizz we want vanilla" if they go that way... Just release it and with or without restarts, just let it eventually die out. If there is MUCH success, give TBC servers to those who want, but be careful not to split the community too thin, because that will definitely kill both.
---
What's the point of classic if you start changing it?
---
My first character will be the rogue, afteewards a mage or hunter for farming.
---
All these possibilities are present in pservers and it is still used. But you have to know what you are doing, and where and when. If you manage to be ahead of the pack for example you should just go for it.
---
I marked as NSFW because I think it adds to the humor, but maybe I'm just weird.
---
Vanilla had some *fucking weird* itemization.
---
Agil Plate and Cloth? You bet!
---
Having to inspect people, instead of gearscore which means absolutely nothing.
---
I. CAN. NOT. WAIT.
---
I just got fired for this. Thanks OP.
---
Which gathering profession do you think will make the most gold?
---
Oqueue has been broken hasn't it?
---
The stat values in this list aren't what they'll be in classic. If you adjust the stats to patch 1.12 numbers the list changes pretty dramatically for some classes. I wouldn't go of that list.
---
I am pretty sure it's like 30g/hour but you can get more with mining nodes and selling health pots
---
What sense of entitlement, my guy? Where did I say anyone has to take me (or this dude's off tank rogue, I still don't think you've read the thread) through any content? There's no lfr, the only raiding I'll be doing is with people who know what I'm playing, and if they don't want what I'm playing I won't be raiding with them, whether I'm a fury warrior or an arcade mage. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
There's also nothing wrong with playing an off tank rogue or an arcane mage, if that's what you want to play. I'm not sure where you get off suggesting that people playing what they want to play in a game they pay money for is somehow negative. I'm sure people will complain about playing a shit build and not getting to do group stuff just as much as people will complain that sometimes those same shit builds are in the group but it's a guild run or something and they're a pug and OMG if they'd just kick that hunter I totally have a friend who could do twice the dps.
---
That’s actually bad you still need nutrition
---
Just get the epic mount before you start with wow
---
No. This edit is disrespectful to Hurricane's work.
---
Right out of college WoW was so necessary. Living in Boston and $700 student loan payments, was barely in break even mode. WoW and older video games I owned were the only entertainment I had for a few years.
---
Your "friends" gave the app permission to do so. There's no difference to them asking "who do you know?" and your friend answering "I know /u/AnUb1sKiNg and he lives in Redditstreet 123". It's not like apps are hacking users, but rather users giving data away willingly because they don't care :/
---
It's still a tree no matter how you want to define it personally
---
Some people will, some people won't. Personally I prefer to take a few minutes out of the dungeon run to just explain people what they're struggling with or let them run their heads against the wall a few times to figure it out on their own. Naturally you'll need someone with my PoV as party leader to be allowed this, but I always felt like those kinds were the majority - at least in vanilla. Can't speak for BfA where everything is just GO GO GO. FASTER FASTER FASTER.
---
Nobody really gave you the right answer: Value is abstract. Value is determined by humans. 
---
I do woodworking. Why do I trade you a desk that I spent 15 hours building for a few pieces of paper with numbers printed on them? Because we ascribe monetary value to those pieces of paper. 
---
Why does Funko get away with selling those plastic figures for $8 when they cost $0.20 to make? Because there is emotional value in the items. 
---
Do not think of value in terms of fairness. Think of value as something people imagine. There are certainly *some* cases where value is pressured by market competition to reflect a price war between different retailers (televisions and computer monitors are incredibly cheap these days because so many different entities are competing) but even then the willingness of customers to pay is contingent upon a human thinking "that is worth it to me."
---
came here for this comment, its always that one guy \^\^
---
Classic wow, buddy
---
Yeah I get what you mean, but I was referring to the way that it forced you to lock in a spec.
---
[Boreal Mantle](https://itemization.info/item/11782)
---
This one is better for almost the same amount of trouble. Good luck.
---
Sounds pretty handy
---
Pikachu face?
---
no one is advocating kicking someone for being a hunter, it's kicking people, or rather not inviting people in the first place, who lack the basic decency to not attempt to hold back strangers for their own weird satisfaction. How do you not see how rude it is to force people to pick up your slack in group content purely because you've decided "heh wouldn't it be more fun if my character was just bad?".
---
Its honestly more annoying that you think people dont already know about most spots :p
---
Yank those goalposts another fifteen feet and have yourself a good night.
---
I'll be playing rogue as well at the start. Like other people have said , we are in a very very advantageous situation where we can take nodes and herbs easily with stealth. 
---
I'd suggest using that to your advantage. Personally, I will go herbalism and alchemy to start with, mainly to stock up hard on thistle teas but also because so many raiding guilds will be stockpiling pots and potions for the raids. 
---
Alchemy and herbalism is a great great money maker, especially if you farm the rarer herbs that are harder to get.
---
lmao you're such a coward it honestly disgusts me
---
This is not what peak performance looks like
---
1. Moonkins does not eat up a debuff slot. You only spam starfire in raids.
---
2. Moonkins are one of the classes that scales best with gear, since starfire gets 100% of your spell damage.
---
3. Curse of shadows bring arcane vulnerability for starfire, there is no need for nature resistance penetration.
---
My favorite raid would have to be Ulduar and my favorite fight would be Algalon the Observer. I really enjoyed the entire storyline of that expansion, but I felt that fighting an envoy of a titan was really cool, without getting too out of hand. We even managed to get server first #humblebrag ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGW5k4j7dWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGW5k4j7dWc))
---
In classic, I think my favorite raid would be ZG. But I honestly primarely pvp'ed back then (coming over from DAoC). I was in a guild that ended up clearing up to the spiderwing in Naxx (leaving the rest of the raid undefeated). But I honestly didn't start to raid for real until TBC.
---
I think my favorite fight during classic would be Onyxia. It wasn't that hard, but I just really enjoyed the fight.
---
I like you, I have unfinished business, in the sense that my ultimate "boss" eluded me as well. I really wanted Grand Marshal / High Warlord. Only did ever make it to 12. That is what I am going to be chasing.
---
Probably not. Run speed for Hunter pets was normalised in patch 1.9, and Blizzard is aiming to recreate 1.12, rather than creating some kind of hybrid patch.
---
Personally, I'm a little disappointed by this, because weird pets with various unusual qualities are one of the coolest things about Hunters. Hell, personally I'd have preferred the Beta version of Hunter pets, where even their size wasn't normalised (which made stuff like the Stormwind Sewer Beast, or the Warg pups from LBRS more interesting.)
---
Makes me wonder if they could have released it in a new engine like they are with WC3 🤔 a man can dream...
---
[I got you.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9HMej4NmBw)
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard won't just let gold sellers exist. Obviously there isn't really a full proof way to completely block it but I have no doubt that they will utilize  their current tools to fight against it, though.
---
Gold selling being against the ToS is #nochanges.
---
Unless it's blizzard selling the gold. I honestly expect them to offer there services in classic at some point it's how they make money now.
---
gold selling will exist as it always has
---
I have the luxury of working at a very very small hotel as a front desk clerk. I do absolutely nothing at work for dozens of hours. I'll be getting paid to play Classic for 8 to 12 hour shifts.
---
I'm sure they'll implement the wow token system that is in live.
---
If you arn't aware:
---
You can buy in game time with wow gold. This is done by other players buying wow time tokens with real money then selling them on the AH. Their price is dictated by supply/demand and can't be manually changed. It allows some players to buy gold while others can use gold to pay their game sub.
---
I think a beta for people who subbed between 2004-2006 would be pretty cool
---
This is a cheap compilation of YouTuber Hurricane‘s work.
---
yeah what a shame, it's real bad now
---
&gt; and daggers get better with later content. 
---
what if I play on daggers but not going further than say zg content?
---
Short answer: No  
---
Long answer: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
True. Sitting on ass all day playing video games is peak performance.
---
That has to be the most retarded idea they could have. Being able to legitimately buy gold in classic would make it extremely p2w
---
Ban'thok Sash goes from a middle-of-the-road starter PvP item for fresh 60s, to being 2nd bis behind Angelista's from BWL. Off the top of my head I can't think of a more slot efficient blue item in the entire game.
---
Post talent specs so we can make ruthlessly tell you why you're a horrible person
---
I mean, agility is still really good on plate since it contributes to dodge and crit.
---
You came to this sub expecting insightful ideas? LUL
---
The raids. Kara was fun to the 10th power. SSC looked awesome with the naga and the fights were great. TK had the 5 phase KT fight that took our guild more than a month of solid practice to get down. Hyjal had some stinkers, but interesting change with an outdoor raid. BT is my alltime fav behind Ulduar. Lock tanking Illidan felt so badass. And our guild didnt get through all of Sunwell before Wrath, so that would be nice to complete.
---
Also I really liked practically all the dungeons as well. The ones you had to swim into a lake and pipe to get to, shattered halls with its brutalness, the ones at the top of the map (those 3 were all unique and great).
---
How do you do this testing? Is there a server or a way that I can create a level X to test things at that level? Do you need you're own server?
---
I can't help but feel you played Druid wrong.   
---
They shouldn't have problem with runners as they have Entangling Roots to prevent that. When I look at your Druid screenshot I also don't see that ability hotkeyed, did you forget about it? Did you make good use of Furor? On that note I'm curious about the talents you took for each class too, could you share your builds?
---
well most tier 1 is pretty bad
---
It's the same with me, only I do snack and drink soda
---
Some things actually got nerfed
---
https://itemization.info/item/18323
---
If we're talking completely fresh like on Classic launch, Warrior feels way better than Rogue imo.
---
Warriors can kill multiples starting when they get cleave and a decent 2h sometime in their teens and they can continue that way as long as they keep their weapon up to date. Rogues are stuck on single target mode until level 30.
---
Where did you even get this from? No weapon has 200 durability
---
You sold that a lot better than I did.
---
Having a good time planting with my friends, and make some new friend along the road. I hope I'm able to find a decent casual raiding guild and be the MT in raids.
---
The good content
---
Yep, had to downvote for this very reason.
---
I've actually seen this quite a bit
---
We are going with 1.12 that means all pets will have normalized stats, only attack speed will remain.
---
That means no Lupos with Shadow Damage.
---
No Mazzranache/Takk the Leaper with increased mov speed.
---
No King Bangalash with hidden attack speed increase.
---
No pets such as the Wind Serpents in 100 Needles with increased spell resistance.
---
Worth or worth?
---
It did, partially. But stamina was part of the budget so you could end up with really odd and powerful items.
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with agi. Gives crit, and for tanks it also give Dodge.
---
People have this idea that str is for warrior, agi is for rogue and hunter, int is for casters etc. Doesnt work like this. You just have items with stats, and classes benefiting differently from those stats.
---
 [https://itemization.info/item/11904](https://itemization.info/item/11904)
---
no way they'll implement this
---
Is grinding for rare companion pets a viable way to make money? Do the huge profits make up for how unreliable it is
---
Anyone have a good guide for hitting Exalted with Thunder Bluff as a non-Tauren?
---
Okay just don't expect other players to be part of his fantasy..
---
Absolutely.

Holy shit, I am playing on tbc server right now, rings from 5 man TBC dungeon are almost the same good as these items.
---
Oh so it's not a burden as in I'll run out of ammo on a boss if I'm full when I started. It's only a burden if I'm a bad player and forget to restock. Awesome. I can't fucking wait for classic ughhh
---
Everyone treating classic like it's going to be hard content and needs perfect raid comp when you could clear most content using only hybrids if you really wanted to. 
---
Better take that mage instead of boomkin cause you might be in that raid an extra 3 minutes.
---
No idea about casters in the arena spectators, but there's a route that avoids that that is still possible. I tried to draw it out on a map:

Each color is a new pull. You get access to one or two dark iron veins doing this and the mobs just drop generally decent stuff. No net npcs when you go this way.
---
Why not? More money for ActivisionBlizzard
---
Depends on the market, not that many pet collectors in vanilla since there is so much else to do.
---
they lose real money to player earning ingame time, sounds like the most failed system ever from a buissness standpoint
---
Emphasis on good run. Until guilds are geared and clearing runs in 2 hours, that Brez might be the difference of clearing a boss or dieing at 1%.
---
they've tried so hard so far to keep everything as it was and keep the fanbase happy, and you think they'll just shit on that by implementing something as stupid as the token system.
---
Not at all bad. Some fasting is always good. Just drink water (around 3 liters) and your good. If you know that you lack specific nutrients, keep taking them. I do water fasting every once in a while and I feel so much better after that.
---
For me it's skinning for devilsaurs and when that isn't possible more it's either RFD or BRD pickpocketing, with RFD having herbalism for grave moss, and BRD mining for dark iron veins. 
---
Tailoring is usually not a good money maker, as the profession is flooded with mages and priests who have to level it for gear anyway.
---
You could go your entire vanilla career (like me) and never see one drop. 
---
Farm felcloth or something :)
---
I try to collect every pet in classic
---
The dream tbh.. :D
---
So you're gong to shift out of cat (losing all your energy), cast entangling roots, then shift back into cat spending like 600 mana just to stop something running away? Doesn't sound super efficient to me. Nope don't think entangling roots was hotkeyed as it shouldn't be part of a grinding rotation. Yes spec was Lotp/furor. I think druid's pretty straightforward to play grinding - never cap energy, shift to heal every 4-5 mobs, use FF before specials and rake if it will get full ticks. Innervate when &lt;20% mana and barkskin heal any accidental pulls.  
---
I did do another test with druid in straight rogue agility/stam gear and it was much worse which I assumed but someone on here last week was claiming agility was *amazing* for druids so I thought it'd be worth a try.
---
A good feral druid could push middle of the pack DPS on P-servers through BWL. They were regarded as bad DPS in vanilla cause people wouldn't powershift and would just sit in kitty form and attack.
---
A good druid will have all the buffs and mana pots ready to go. There are the winterspring buffs, hydrocanes, wolfshead helm etc which really get them going.
---
Thanks for all the answers guys, such active subreddit, nice! :)
---
Well you can only buy in game time if someone else has already paid real money for the token. So they pull the same amount of money.
---
This is horribly ripped off
---
Not even on tryhard pservers is it expected that you know things in advance or have played the game before. You are gonna be just fine.
---
Into the end game my guess is mining and herbalism. Engineering has consumables that people use and then need more of, and all raiders need pots and flasks.  Leather wont matter as much as people start progressing into content that gives gear way better than LW can make.
---
A "classic server option" was announced at Blizzcon 2017. BFA came out August 2018.
---
Well they can try, but there is generally a truth to the worls that is so long as a market exists you'll always find people attempting to supply it.
---
Could be trolls, or RPers, or worse - Troll Warrior RPers!
---
No, but the information is out there for you to learn. Why would people someone that doesn't know his class/dungeon/raid mechanics instead of someone who made some effort to learn it before going all blind?
---
I'm 21 and I've started playing WoW last year, I learned everything I had in my power, just because I don't want to make other people's life harder, before going into raids I researched it, watched videos, same thing for my class when going into PvP.
---
Denying to learn stuff that is free out there just for the sake of your "own experience" is just being egoistic tbh.
---
&gt;Hunters can probably match their speed if they find an efficient quest-route, maybe.
---
Depends on the mage and server really. Good mage AoE is very hard to do, but when done optimally there's no competing with it. There really isn't. I haven't done the math yet(actually plan on doing some time), but a perfect 1-60 with aoe is like 2½-3days played.
---
I think people will be upset if they cant pay for their sub with in game gold like they currently can. Unless they do something that branches across retail and classic. 
---
You need to be aware that ActivisionBlizzard dont care about their player base anymore, last blizzcon is proof of that. Remaking classic is free money for them, same as wc3 remake. Thats why they're doing it, not because of a love for their player base. They wouldn't have served up cease and desist for the all the other classic servers if that was the case.
---
They know its free money because nost had 100k+ player accs.
---
If you like gathering your own mats then sure. If you have a class that farms gold quickly and reliably then perhaps just buy mats from the AH?
---
Just wanting to know. Did you hamstring kite on your warriors test?
---
Else you gonna have to try it out again.
---
I think most are pretty obvious seeing as you have enough talents for 31pt and 5 left over.

Download this repack, this is all the code that a server needs to run, it's surprisingly lightweight and doesn't take much processing. Then you need a vanilla wow client, any will do. Set the realmlist as instructed on the website, open it all up and you have now your own test server with GM privileges. And here is a list of GM commands: https://www.reaper-x.com/2007/09/21/wow-mangos-gm-game-master-commands/
---
Indeed, I can't believe anything below AQ40 and Naxx requiring full optimization, especially of the players have an idea what they're doing. No idea about Naxx though, never raided this I have to admit.
---
I'm a huge altoholic, so probably getting every class to 60, ideally before TBC servers are a thing (or however they decide to handle Classic post-Naxx)
---
Not a question, just using this thread to discuss something; I didn't want to make a whole new post about it either.
---
**The discussion will be about the viability of phasing/sharding (will use these terms interchangeably), the necessity of an actual beta of the current client and the effectiveness of an internal beta versus an open beta.**
---
Blizzard is a huge company. *I would presume* when they do internal Alpha/Beta testing for a particular game, they probably send invites to most employees, maybe thousands? Can it be expected that they would indeed test the viability and effects of phasing of Classic starting zones and first initial zones? Would they actually test this internally with the people they've got? My thinking is, even if they test this with 1000 people to see exactly how much initial competition there would be for mobs/quest items, it will not be reflective of the actual launch situation. A lot of realms will instantly hit population cap.
---
Thus, for how long would Blizzard determine phasing will be active? And, how many zones would they implement this on?
---
These are important questions which I feel need to be addressed as soon as possible. An open beta needs to happen so that a *realistic* stress can be put on the servers and the effects of sharding and mob competition can be studied.
---
Personally I am against all kinds of sharding and phasing. I am willing to sacrifice a few good days at start trying to tag mobs and complete quests. It's annoying but it's a part of the game especially during a huge launch event. With time populations can normalize and the players will start to spread around Azeroth more evenly.
---
Yet, Blizzard has that mindset that they want to minimize all possible player lashing out from annoying things such as these. They don't want to deal with all the negative feedback. But in any situation, there will always be some sort of negative feedback from minorities.
---
They have the net. Here is a video from Sept 2006 that shows it. [Youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NPg20GdNxk&amp;feature=youtu.be). You can see the mage get netted at 1:40ish.
---
I can tell you you're definitely better off going 8 points prot before you even start the ret tree. Divine Strength is like... level 55 and beyond.
---
You are missing a very important point. Raiders have been optimizing every last drop of effeciency our of raid compositions. People are litterally racing to see who can clear raids fasters. MC is down to like 20mins now.
---
The end result of all that optimization is the current Meta. It is not some kind of social stigma or racism it is simply the case that with everything taken in the account there is still a big gap in performance between classes and specs. 
---
Take a look at the different class [raid logs from pservers](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx)
---
Apologies will delete
---
I removed it, my apologies
---
Instead of claiming that pserver density how about instead you prove it?
---
Take the LH core and play through it, and match it to joana's 1-60 speedrun, you have exact data of both, clearly you would be able to download it and in 2 hours have clear evidence that there's something majorly wrong with pservers.
---
But no instead you make baseless claims on reddit on a topic that isn't even relevant because mob density doesn't matter when you are comparing different classes grind speed on the same randomly chosen spot..
---
There's not much to it. [These are all the quests that give TB rep](https://classicdb.ch/?faction=81#quests:0+2+1), there's not a lot of them. After that you'll be turning in runecloth and doing AV (once it's released).
---
Warlock pet only goes oom if low pet management skills :P
---
This makes me laugh because my brother got to rank 13 in vanilla and stopped because of how grueling the grind was (and he really didn’t need the weapon) but he always regretted not hitting 14. That grind has to be the worst in any game lol. 3+ straight months of 14-16 hours a day. 
---
What server(s) did you play on? 
---
I was on Illidan (H) and Stonemaul (A)
---
My entire WoW career I've never had a pet drop. They are super rare.
---
We don’t know how spillover rep will work in classic or if cloth turning will be available, so it varies
---
You have a sustainable rotation with BoW and bandages. With BoM you're going to have to stop and eat/drink every 3-4 mins or so (or drop rotation). Might be worth a test.
---
I’m looking at monitors and Im thinking about going with a 27” curved widescreen with amd/free sync 144hz with the protection from blue light from longevity hours of playing.. pretty sure is Asus that makes it but the question is should I go through with the purchase or get a 4K monitor with 60hz for better picture? I feel like wow doesn’t need that much to run nicely but I want to know what this community thinks.
---
The patched version of Kentic Amic was so fucking good for 49 caster twinking
---
Not as a reliable way to make money, but you can incorporate the grind into a bigger farming routine in some places. Swamp of sorrows comes to mind, where you can grind the dragon whelps, but also just gather loads of herbs and the mobs drop expensive grey items to vendor.
---
What's the divorce good to cost though?
---
Not me. Those days are long behind me. Going back to WoW at all is already a big deal for me, I'm not gonna get super addicted like I used to be in high school.
---
I agree, 
---
It might be them changing something up,  because clearly the rest of blizzard side doesn't give a shit. Just take a look at retail, fixes that shouldve been patched taking 6 months +. But I have full confidence that if the order comes from up top to put in a wow token that no amount of devs can/will stop it.
---
Yeah I did consider that but vengeance sounds more fun. You're probably right it is better. I might have another go with ret, I think I can improve it.
---
Yes but the problem is just RNG.
---
Two things were changed:
---
A) Big boy tentacles could no longer spawn in random unkillable places. If you get on these, it's wipe.
---
B) Tentacles spawning doing cthuns vulnerable phase.
---
B really doesn't do much. On pservers people have been able to kill cthun in 1 phase, they can handle not focusing cthun that hard. 
---
The problem is A). If you get just one bad tentacle in phase A you wipe. It's basically just RNG, I can't tell you what the odds are to have no tentacles spawn randomly in a normal 2vuln kill, I don't think anyone can, but the boss is hard enough already and with a literal 8 min walk back time and massive consumable requirements I can see why none killed him before the changes.
---
You might be right, if I turn the taunt off on every second mob I might get a better result. I have aoe taunt off of course.
---
What's the rotation?
---
Oh well, as far as we put links, this guy was even better than Trig :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXndQK8QIoQ&amp;t=231s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXndQK8QIoQ&amp;t=231s)

You had many great players in Vanilla. Not that many made vids, and even amongst those who did, not every one became famous. the top 0.1% are always savages, in any game, even with the low skill standards Vanilla held, these people were there.
---
I agree.
---
Yea, I'm not going to dispute that claim. But there are other factors to consider such as private server-inconsistencies. I heard Fire Rocs in Tanaris had a skill in vanilla which might disrupt AoE-pulls, for whatever reason private servers failed to include that skill for those Rocs.
---
But with perfect circumstances I think you're right, Mages will get the World-record time to hit 60. Hunters just have a bigger margin for failure.
---

Here's an idea. Plop a camera down on your desk and put out your own videos. Instead of bitching about free content that you probably didn't watch anyway, show us how it's done and make videos you think should be made.

I feel the same way as you but I dont think its the feedback blizz is afraid of its that people could straight up throw in the towel if they initially aren't as hyped as the rest of us. Fighting for mob tags is infuriating and could drive people away for good.
---
It depends so much on your server economy. In classic (if I remember correctly) you can theoretically level all professions up to 300 after reaching level 5 (correct me if I'm wrong pls). Also many crafts do not require BoP materials. So besides gathering and selling in the AH, it might be actually be possible to earn money with crafting professions if you have the right recipes.
---
Lol daym
---
But spirit was almost useless for almost everyone except some healers and meme dps specs right?
---
I don’t entirely agree with your comment. If he’s never played before he shouldn’t have to research every boss fight beforehand and watch videos....that takes away all of the “oh shit!” Moments and the fun out of the game. OP has an advantage over all of us, he’s never played before and gets to experience all the joy we had when we were younger. Back in the day there were very few videos of boss attempts and even if there was one, most people wouldn’t watch it. You would die by something and laugh about it.
---
I’m sure a lot of people (myself included) would have no problem bringing him to raids and would never expect him to know all the fights and researched mechanics.
---

I'm going to play a Human Mage, I didn't play vanilla I joined in WOTLK and I was horde all the way, change of pace :) 
---
I know it's more efficient to play as a gnome but I don't like being small. I'm not trying to play optimally.
---
I think mage would be in with a really good shot for WR if someone mapped out exactly their route. It would involve going back and forth between aoe spec and single target spec. Mainly Single with some AoE up to 40, and mainly aoe with some single after 40. Slow running up to 40 sucks, but aoe levelling and mage portals are super strong for 40-60.
---
Lol that offhand would even make oomkins great in raids, almost a shale they took it away :o
---
Because it was the best expansion.
---
is there a video about the biggest differences between between release wow and 1.12 regarding class changes / raiding / pvp etc ? Since it's so far back it's all just a blur to me...
---
Wow VR: https://youtu.be/Y_zXXqRhP_U
---
Unless your gear is really basement level it doesn't matter too much if only 1 resists, you can just barrier and ignore it and kill last. If two resist I'd cold snap and nova again, or reset if it's not up (generally that's rare enough it will be there when you need it though).
---
I imagine that's what the zookeeper said right before he took aim at Harambe.
---
I wouldn't bear for only two mobs and you're not in danger of dying. Costs a ton a mana to shift and you have no better dps in bear, swipe is terrible unless you're hitting like 4 targets at least.   
---
Yeah I don't really mind wanding at all I quite like it, but I know other people hate it. I'm pretty set on priest as my main.
---
My only problem with hybrid dps is that they (atleast) most of the time are underperforming and at the same time they are stealing other peoples gear. My intention is to raid as resto shaman to gear my self easier for elemental spec. If we have 1-2 elemental shamans in raid with loot prio on dps gear, my elemental gearing is going to take ages.
---
It just feels bad to lose gear to meme specs. 
---
I wouldnt care if there would be few hybrid dps in raid, but they should have lowest prio in gearing. 
---
Like Lok'amir should always go to healer first, even thou its elemental Bis untill naxx. 
---
And i dont think im only one whos swallowing the healing pill just to get some sweet dps gear.
---
No not worth it. Professions or dungeons is the way to go.
---
Lewd
---
Wotlk is actually when they nerfed will of the Forsaken ☺️
---
nah not all, its just how men are
---
These are some of the most killed/video'd/remembered mobs in vanilla. Even ignoring that, the point is really to test the specs not the mobs. Even if it was mobs nothing like vanilla and the numbers are wrong, the playstyle and comparison between specs should hold.
---
you dont need the rep for the racial factions afaik.
---
Do you think that 3rd party scoring addons such as raider.io, gear score, etc will catch on in Classic? I love running dungeons, but I've hated what the mythic+ tracking did to the community. I don't want addons to ruin the dungeon community and create external restrictions for players.
---
Yes, both existed and worked a lot different from modern WoW. In vanilla item dictated the budget available to a piece of gear and then that budget was further increased based on item quality. rare gave more than uncommon and epic gave more than rare. On top of this no stat was required to be on an item, stamina was part of the budget, main stat was part of the budget. So you could have items with no stamina and in exchange they usually have extra DPS stats that are more valuable.
---
Every stat an item could have had a value and while I don't remember all of them I know primary stats (strength, agility, stamina, intellect, spirit) were a baseline of 1, attack power was 0.5, critical strike and hit were estimated to be 13-14 and this was later proven when the rating system was implemented for TBC. But even with this budget known, some items didn't line up with it exactly, usually 'hybrid' items that had a load of primary stats like Feralheart.
---
It would be bis forever for healers and casters that have issues with mana.
---
Skyrim was bad enough having the player be [The Chosen One](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne) in every damn quest line. In an MMORPG it's even more ridiculous.
---
There was a neck with this same effect wasn't there?
---
I get your distrust, and it's not that I don't harbor the hesitations about changes. But for instance we know certain classes can't function in certain roles at an acceptably competitive level, I am more curious if people want that as a permanent thing. I'm not really interested in whether people want new content, more wondering if they want small tweaks to existing content or not. 
---
&gt;&gt;"my opinion wont hurt the game"
---
And this is a little dishonest to assume to be what I mean. I've never played on a private server but I was advocating for the continuation of pure classic wow when nost was shut down. I do actually understand the draw of the original game. But it doesn't mean it's not worth also discussing the problems classic has. I did not say it would be better. But there is also a chance to learn from decades of mistakes. Will they? I don't know, lets have a discussion about it and not be dicks.
---
it's great for healers and the best leveling stat. Trash for dps and tanks.
---
It is.
---
how about 34-35" curved widescreen 3440x1440 at 100-120hz?
---
Getting the best out of both worlds. This resolution is a lot more forgiving than 4k, and the imagequality is verygood. 
---
I got acer predator X34 and its amazing. 
---
While playing CS go or overwatch i hope that i would have 165hz+ though, but with slow paced games this perfect.
---
Also, i would never consider 60hz monitor for gaming anymore. It feels stuttering.
---
I find your numbers way off.

I dug this up from AEONS ago where warlocks could apparently do 120k / hr at the pirates.

The quote from near the end, when he talked about the clasic demo, was especially touching:
---
_"In that short week, I had the most fun playing World of Warcraft I ever had"_
---
And now imagine how we felt, when after playing this exact game for almost 2 years, had to watch it slowly but surely drift away into wha it is today.
---
Kind of breaks my heart. I found the crimson and emerald whelp in vanilla.
---
Of course it was designed to make you subbed as long as possible. It's an MMO. Sub based MMOs were designed that way.
---
However if it's done right (and in case of Vanilla, even with all the warts, it was) grinding is enjoyable. People enjoy the (grindy and long) game and keep subbed. The developer rakes in the money. It's a win-win. Nothing wrong with it.
---
As for your is it worth it? Only you can decide. It seems you've decided that yes, it is. I'd add that you don't actually pay for Classic. You pay for WoW. Classic is part of WoW.  A "game-mode" or "server option" or whatever you'd want to call it.

Full dreamwalker with atiesh

gonna take a while
---
I'm afraid it will be a thing, I'm hoping it won't.
---
I'm just assuming OP meant classic wow raids since this is the classic wow subreddit
---
Thanks heaps! Really helpful.
---
One thing I've noticed lately are the amount of toxic trolls here all of a sudden.  Weird
---
Yep, Choker of Enlightenment from Lucifron. Those items would be like 66 mp5 each for a Paladin casting Flash of Light.
---
&gt;don't shoot the messenger, this exists in live and has stopped gold seller spamming.
---
The reason why this was introduced in live, was to combat the gold inflation, which itself was the result of idiotic design decisions.
---
Classic doesn't require such a mechanism, as it has adequate ways to drain gold from the economy.
---
I love my X34, plenty of real estate and extremely emersive. You don't need a ton of fps for wow. On the 1.12 client (pserver) I have it capped at 64fps because of vanilla animation limitations and it is extremely smooth. Retail which will be closer to Classic I have capped at 90fps with ultra settings, gsync is amazing.
---
rip thats a nerf for some
---
I'm very surprised by the low amount of people going with BS and LW.
---
For PvP folks (especially important on alliance side), picking up BS (Armorsmith) for the Glimmering Mithril Insignia trinket (30 sec fear immunity, 10min CD) as any class is really strong, and I'd highly recommend it. 
---
LW is really good for those who dislike farming for gold, with its 3 day cooldown from Salt Shaker, giving you a steady income of gold without any effort. This can also be achieved by having Tailoring or Alchemy, but consider trying out LW if you haven't done so before. It's great to level up early on together with Skinning, then later on dropping for another profession like Engineering (every class) or Tailoring (PvE casters). 
---
A Tailoring + LW combo will net you a lot of steady gold from the Mooncloth (4d CD) + Salt Shakers (3d CD). If you plan on mostly doing PvE content as a healer, this is a dream combo as you make a lot of gold while leveling up, and won't have to farm for much gold at 60, which can be a healers nightmare.
---
Personally, I'll most likely roll with Engineering + Armorsmith as an Alliance Gnome Warlock since my focus will be a lot on PvP. Glimmering Mithril Insignia is very strong against a lot of players who will roll Horde Warlocks/Priests; since they won't have to deal with anti-fear abilities like the undead racial WotF on Horde side. Glimmering Mithril Insignia will ruin their day, get one.
---
How hard is it to get rank 10 as a healer? How would I get honor?
---
T2 is shit for PvE why would you even suggest this?
---
I would personally be annoyed if you didnt know the basics of tanking, like equip a shield and atleast know how to pull mobs so that you dont get multiple packs and that you know how to keep the aggro. For healing i expect that you know how to heal, which also means healing the rest of the grp and not just the tank.
---
There is a level 35 Restriction on Artisan professions.
---
&gt; I think people will be upset if they cant pay for their sub with in game gold like they currently can. 
---
People will be upset that they won't get into raids by clicking a button.
---
People ewill be upset that they won't be full purple 2 days after dinging 60
---
People will be upset that they get one-shotted by 3min Mages and PvP Warris.
---
People get upset over a lot of things, and the worst thing you can do as a game designer, is to care about them being upset, and compromise your design in the process.
---
If they do that, then Classic is **DEAD**. Not slowly bleeding player numbers. Not being a bit less popular. DEAD. Instantly. The people willing to play it will be gone in an instant, and Private Servers will spring up like mushrooms after a rain, hosted in countries that simply ignore US copyright laws.

1h is pushing it. We cleared BWL and were into AQ40 and 2-3h runs of MC were quick on a pserver. Not every guild is speed running raids.
---
Incorrect. if the tentacles spawned in the correct place, it was possible. The odds of none of the tentacles bugging out was super low, but not zero.
---
To enjoy levelling my favourite classes alongside my friends - this'll probably be Priest, Mage and Warlock. Might dabble in some pre-raid stuff on those to enjoy some more group-focused content.
---
Aside from that, probably just do some basic item/rep/recipe grinding on whatever I end up "maining" and probably try to maintain a 19 Priest twink too.
---
Don't forget Arbiter's Blade, Spritecaster Cloak, Ban'thok Sash... BRD was really good for 49 casters.
---
Not a chance. The only way to stop 3rd party gold sellers is with the wow token which is a much better option since it's player to player trading instead of the chinese gold farmers.
---
Is there a standard tip for mage water and food while leveling?

we used to have battleground groups and literally sit infront of the warsong gulch entrance all day

&gt;I've dwelled among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It's funny to say they are small, it's funny to say they are big. I've been at parties where humans have held bottles, pencils and thermoses in front of themselves and called out, 'Hey, look at me! I'm Mr. So-And-So Dick! I've got such-and-such for a penis!' I never saw it fail to get a laugh.

Like someone already stated, it'll be the modern API with restrictive access so you can't recreate stuff that may disturb the flow of mainly social interactions.
---
there was so much time, that i leveled a rogue to 60, thought maybe will go priest, so i leveled one to 20, then i thought, no i think pala would be cooler and leveled one to 44. now i know my first choice was right and i will play rogue when classic hits. nevertheless it was a lot of fun. now i will stop playing till launch to not get burned out
---
You're the good kind of weird
---
"vanish"
---
I don't own a phone.
---
So I guess I can't go lel.
---
I'd expect the amount of successful gold sellers to be reduced, due to Blizzard's anti-botting system becoming stronger over time, but they will still probably exist.
---
It’s no big deal and you weren’t to know, it’s just not very nice for content creators to have their work copied cheaply like this.
---
I don't have to.  I work in education and we have 12 weeks of paid vacations a year, 6 of them in the summer.   The only downside is I can't ask for days off outside the school holidays , not for any reason , so if Classic would be released right now, I couldn't stay home.

Sorry, this post was removed because the image/meme does not obviously relate to Classic WoW without the post's title included (Rule #7).

i tried it. u can aoe like 5-6 mobs that are like 5-6 levels lower than u. against mobs with the same lvl u pretty much cant to anything.
---
Wish it was in better quality so I can see more player names. I can make out a few in the chat and recognize a lot of them.

I simply cant remember maybe someone can:
---
apart from gnome racial, free action potion what other anti movement impairing items were there in vanilla?
---
Is all of the following correct?
---
**Bullets**
---
* Bullets are used with guns
---
* The best crafted bullet is Thorium Shells (17.5)
---
* The better bullets are Rockshard Pellets (18) and Miniature Cannon Ball (20.5)
---
**Arrows**
---
* Arrows are used by bows and crossbows
---
* The best "crafted" (swapped) arrows are Thorium Headed Arrow (17.5)
---
* The better arrows are Doomshot (20)
---
Yup
---
IIRC you would still get honor points for being in party with ppl who killed enemy players.
---
I got to rank 11 as priest healer in vanilla and rank 10 was not that bad if you focused on pvp entirely.
---
Can I get uhhhhh, blessing of freedom?
---
I want to play druid as my main. I'd like to have a spec that can heal in raids, but can also do good in bgs without needing soemone to peel for my healer ass 24/7. I don't want to min/max my healing for raiding, but I also don't want to be a burden for my guild. Any suggestions?
---
For who?
---
How do you balance these classes then? It's RPG, every class shines in something. Why look at the competitive part only?
---
Lets say you buff rets and druids for DPS, already strong PvP and solo classes, do you see how it starts to bring other problems?
---
Classic has issues but so does Retail, why do you think they can fix classic (which ask the question why classic in the first place) if they can't fix Retail after 16 years? You can't have balance in ANY game, not even close, all you can have is meta change. If blizzard start working on bringing constant meta changes, then why make classic in the first place?
---
People have this utopia in their heads but they only look through the window, never noticing the shit under it.
---
I can't stop people from discussing this, but i wont trust current blizz with anything that has "fix classic" in the sentence.
---
Problem is those addons that just measure the quality or level of your gear will fail to account for if an item is best in slot.  Which is what is going to matter far more for efficiently clearing content then your gear level ever will.
---
I meant from items, gear, that kind of stuff
---
It’s going to run on the modern client, so that probably won’t actually be as true as it is on private servers. It will be easier to run than BfA though!
---
A lot of druids have enjoyed playing 0-30-21, doing both raids, world stuff and PvP with it. The spec is probably a good fit for your purpose.

---
I forwarded your question to a hunter friend of mine and he says that he’s pretty certain that you got everything right. 
---
However, he added that realistically you’ll be better off to go for the best crafted version of ammo 98% of the time since it’ll be near impossible to get the “best” versions in quantities that are worthwhile for any PvE/PvP scenario.

But how would I interact with others then Frost? 
---
I can also use magic of Google and search for "vanilla grinding spots", but I am still supporting creators.
---
Oh, I understand that. I’m just afraid that it will somehow turn into some quantifiable number or score. The Division 2 just recently went through this where people were trying to max out their gear score instead of building a solid build. This caused a lot of problems with grouping because a person with a near perfect build with 450gs was doing more dmg and surviving more easily than a person that rushed 500gs. 
---
I really do not want to see chat spammed with required gear scores. I’d rather take someone willing to learn a new role or dungeon than some  try hard trying to rush a dungeon to push up some arbitrary score.
---
Thanks! Will definitely check it out.
---
Yeah, demonshear would be good for spellpower paladins (spelladins) with its faster speed
---
Nice
---
Looks nice! ;) gj
---
No standard, whatever sounds good is fine. High level mages make low level water/food quickly in stacks of 20 so it's not a huge pain for them to make up 3-4 stacks so don't worry too much if you only have 20s to give them at lvl 30.
---
So like three guys ever?
---
It’s a massive upgrade for literally everyone else who would use it.
---
honestly this is so true. I spend so much money in my free time. Now my free time will be spoken for for 15 bucks a month.
---
Ice Threaded Arrow have all right DPS, but they are beaten by Thorium Headed Arrow. Unless THA is too costly, I think I will just be using those as my standard arrow for end-game.
---
Or good, because that means people not using other farming methods, therefore making another one more profitable.
---
it only gets worse from there on till 60 :P
---
I'm gonna be playing classic wow, and I'm sure I'd be considered a part of the younger generation, especially on this sub.

Holy shi\*.. i'm gonna have to try that out.. he made it look so simple xD
---
Cool strat but it doesn't look faster than mage aoe. His entire 5 minute video looked like 2 normal mage pulls, and mage does it with way less consumables/trinkets/cooldowns.  
---
If you think numbers are off or bad fair enough but I'm not going to argue with an ancient 240p video with no stats. If you want to try to count how many mobs he kills in 5 mins that would be a good start but I can't be assed with that grainy footage.
---
Yes lets make sure everyone has to do a self education on cyber security. That is precisely what everyone wants to do anyways, so might as well let the corporate overlords force it up our arses. There's no reason we should be able to trust a company like blizzard, or indeed any company, enough to not fuck with our rights. What do you think its a free world or something?
---
I bet that is literally your line of thinking, and fuck that whole notion dude. Fuck them, 2. They need to do better, and we need to demand it from them. Nothing else to debate about it, except a last comment just to clarify this: You suck.
---
I was not trying to be arrogant or somthing. Should be the first result. Something with wow auction house :)
---
&gt; Did you just have some of your dps warriors throw on a shield?
---
Yes.
---
It's really not to get spotted buying gold, you put low quality item in AH then the Chinese farmer buy it for the amount u paid on their site.
---
I have a small family loan  to repay and I wanted to raise some pocket money to last me for the first few months after Classic launch, so I started work at my cousins' company. I asked if I could work until end of August and they said it's no problem. So basically I'm hoping launch will coincide with me leaving work.
---
There's simply no other way I want to do this. Going complete balls to the walls die from a heart attack sitting on the chair 20 hours straight no biggie.
---

---
The moment Blizzard runs the actual game, there's no way any pserver will survive for more than a day from blizzard's legal department.
---
Ban'thok Sash is the biggest item for DPS casters, easily. Ban'thok Sash is one of the items that makes me genuinely sad about there not being progressive itemisation, as you will see literally every DPS caster use it for basically 90% of the games lifetime, or 100% for anyone that doesn't get far in raids. I understand that Blizzard doesn't feel that progressive itemisation adds much, but I really feel they should've continued the 1.10 cut-off points not just for new items, bu also updated items. Pre-1.10 updates are generally OK, but the 1.10 updates on a few items are totally insane.
---
What about agility with wands?

Yes they will, the same way they have been so far, by being in countries that don't adhear to US copyright laws.

Ill never forget that guy who died was it the cause  no sleep or starved cant remember it was asian guy and it was on the news and it was wow player
---
It does need to be tempered. But it's never good game design to build it such that someone likes say a Rogue and are told they shouldn't play it because it's bad at the end (hypothetically speaking). That's what bring the player not the class should be: everything has a role that makes it useful and there shouldn't ever be something that people pick only to find out it sucks and they should have picked something else.
---
I'll be seeing them on the 13th, can't wait!
---
Hey just curious where you find these phases?
---
And Blizzards legal department can do what exactly against a private Server hosted in Tuvalu, Kiribati or Palau?
---
There's no way a company as big as that is above using sketchy methods under the table to get rid of something that's harming their buisness.       
---
Hell, they could even offer a tiny bit of revenue to x country if they deal with private servers or they won't allow their game to be played in x country.
---
I'm quitting my job. ..yeah, seriously.
---
Yes, how do you balance classes. That's something interesting to talk about it. I do understand power creep. I do understand that someone has to be at the bottom. But seeing there are potential problems doesn't remove all possibility of a solution. 
---
   
---
&gt;&gt; do you see how it starts to bring other problems?
---
You do a disservice to yourself and others when you assume the people you're talking to are idiots.
---
&gt;&gt; People have this utopia in their heads but they only look through the window, never noticing the shit under it.
---
​This is can easily be said about any person's view point on the topic... I am happy for no changes ever. But that's no more a utopia than anyone else talking about the problems classic will have. 
---
Finally, I don't think classic needs fixing. I loved classic, and I am eagerly anticipating it's re-release. But this is seems to be a team built of people who also love classic with the effort and thought going into it, so I'm going to give them some benefit of the doubt.. If it wasn't for them we wouldn't be having this discussion, so I think being sparing with our criticism of the mere concept of change is something we can at least afford them.
---
Only Mograine of the 4 hit hard, so you ‘just’ need 2 well geared and 6 decently geared one
---
You think tokens can stop this?  Token are deterrent for scared players, the rest already know where to get their gold. It ain't stopping anything, it's just blizz getting a slice from the cake.
---
I read somewhere that the game will only run on 64bit? That would suck, I only have an oldish laptop and its 32bit
---
Also, is this game going require more from a PC than vanilla+TBC did? I have an i3 laptop which can't really run dota2 or cs:go but it should run WoW hopefully? (I am fine with playing on bad-ish settings, it's nostalgia anyways)

Went from being a Mail chest with +defense to a ridiculously strong Warrior DPS item
---
There was an ask reddit post last week that brought this up and was a real eye opener to me. Most people in the US get fuck all in terms of paid time off to the point where someone who gets 2 weeks is considered lucky. 
---
As opposed to Europe or more specifically the UK where 28 days is the legal minimum that your employer must give you. Me and all of my mates all get 6 weeks of PTO a year and that doesn't include bank holidays, christmas, Illness etc. What employers get away with over there should be straight up fucking illegal  , I can't even comprehend only getting 2 weeks a year to spend doing things that I want to do and then have to spend the remaining 50 weeks of the year slaving away 9-5.
---
I would love them to go back to their roots too, but they're far too removed for that I think.
---
Yes
---
I don't think these countries will take a little  bit of money to violate their citizens and illegally (in their country) shut down a private server. 
---
And if one country gets bought out, they'll just go to another country. There's a lot of countries in the world.
---
should be said that those dps warriors also have tank gear that they have picked up over time
---
Ah yes.. you are right. There was a level 5 restriction to learn a profession at all, but that was enough to disenchant everything. I'll change that in my previous post..
---
I'd rather have tokens than pserver garbage.
---
&gt;Hell, they could even offer a tiny bit of revenue to x country if they deal with private servers
---
What bit of revenue are we talking here about, exactly?  
---
Tuvalu makes a sizeable portion of it's GDP in hosting services, preciselby because they are a safe haven where copyright claims from western countries are largely ignored.
---
I don't know what fantasies you have about Blizzards wealth, but it's not enough to buy a country.
---
&gt;Or they won't allow their game to be played in x country.
---
I can think of few things that governments could care less about than what video games their citizens are allowed to access.
---
These are awesome! I’m trying to pick out my favorite but can’t decide - they all look great!

---
Different businesses require different things. If this guy is a contractor, good luck playing WoW on the job.
---
Once vanilla comes ill be a mage i like to pvp alot but im unsure the professions to go because i hear that Engineering is good for pvp.
---
That seems reasonable. Having said that though it was public pressure and interest that created classic in the first place, what could it do in regards to wow next? If classic proves a success then what people have to say may start mattering to blizzard a little more.
---
Lovely stuff.
---
Which faction has more need for mages due to geography?
---
I've heard good things about night elves Starshards being the most mana efficient damage spell in the priest kit.
---
Would it speed up the leveling process in any meaningful way? And is there any good use for it at 60 whatsoever?
---
They will certainly try. If they think for two seconds that they can implement the token system on Classic, they will, and say it’s to combat the gold sellers. 
---
For you to buy $15 of game time, someone else had to spend $20. For every token sold, it’s $5 more profit than if you paid cash for your sub. 
---
Someone stated the tokens were in response to a poor design decision that had put too much gold in the system and to combat gold sellers. Also false. The influx of easy gold was to make the token system palatable to more players. Instead of continuing to combat gold sellers, Activision just figured out how to replace them and make a profit on it. 
---
For every 3 players buying tokens off the AH to pay for game time, that makes up for 1 sub lost. If the ratio is 4:1, then profits go up even with the sub loss.  To increase profits, they can add items for ingame gold amounts most players would need to buy gold to get, such as a 2mil gold mount. Token sales go up, and so do profits. Even if the price of the token goes up or down in game, that doesn’t change the extra $5 figure, as long as Blizzard sets the ingame price to a figure that players can farm, and enough gold that people will spend $20. 
---
So to implement it on Classic, they will have a lower gold price on the Classic servers (because it’s harder to farm there), and you can only buy a token on Classic with gold from that server. Regular servers will still have their regular market price. That way both will still support the $20 token for $15 game-time model.
---
This doesn’t even touch the mounts for cash sales. Add in some models from later expansions to Classic and says it’s because they don’t add any ingame advantage. Pets for cash sales do well because some are released with P2W pet battle abilities that let players buy wins for months, then get nerfed down.
---
Savage. But true
---
I won’t take days off :) Classic isn’t going anywhere.
---
Yes just use Wowhead.
---
If you don't like to alt-tab you can use Overwolf that gives you in-game overlays/windows for web browsers and a whole lot more. So that then you can do things like order pizza online without even having to leave the game. Now that's what I call livin' the dream.
---
They wont fuck it up you stupid idiot you are probably still one of those retards that think blizzard will add flying mounts and LFR to classic. 
---
Even if they introduce tokens or some shit i will never play p server garbage. Never ever in my life.
---
I could waste a slot with that, or take another Rogue that will do twice the dps.
---
The current wow devs are obviously not great. But if we remove our cynicism could you see yourself wishing for content that seemed fitting or not, ever? I'm not really curious whether it could be done right, I'm more wondering whether the prospect is exciting for people if it was done right.
---
Why downvote the guy, this is true
---
These look pretty awesome, like something Blizz would use in a blog post.
---
It's so so bad on private servers due to no regulation or repercussions
---
They are sewing pieces together, they aren't making anything. And when i say i don't trust them, i pretty much say "i dont trust the upper management" since they pull the strings.
---
Do you play retail? I used to be a part of a pretty hardoce guild back in legion, and now im in constant contact with these people. Nothing changed...literally. Benched classes, benched specs, same as always. So to answer your question "How do we balance classes" i will tell you as i already did, there in no balance, only META change.
---
Therefore if you change the meta once, you need to change it again, which begs the question of why make classic in the first place?
---
Lets say that they bring classes closer together, hardcore guilds will bench you exactly the same, the gear will be distributed exactly the same. I won't give you that leather piece from the goodness of my heart, ill give it to the rogue, not the druid.
---
So what did we accomplish? Except opening the pandora's box which will cause people to cry for another meta change, therefore getting back to the original question: Why make Classic at all ?
---
Only on Reddit.
---
1) Will different animals still have different stats as hunter pets? I remember walking my Dwarf hunter to Mulgore at like like level 15 or something to tame The Rake, and kinda want to do that again.
---
2) Will you no longer gain XP in battlegrounds? I had an awesome 19 rogue twink back in the day that would also be fun to rebuild.
---
Bad bot
---
In my opinion: Horde.
---
Since Blackrock Mountain is kind of hard to reach from any of the Horde cities, many raiders tend to have their Hearthstone set to Kargath. Having a mage there for portals is basically a must.
---
Alliance has it easier when it comes to logistics. Ironforge is pretty central on the Eastern Kingdoms and Menethil Harbour is very close by, so that Kalimdor isn't that far off either.
---
I mean, it's obvious you won't be tanking them in leather dps gear.
---

People say no but I think they're naive. There have been gaming feats thought to be impossible only to be broken over a decade later. I'm sure consdering every single usable item, exploit, and strategy physically possible, it could be done. How long did people even attenpt pre nerf Cthun? Months maybe? Definitely not decades. Some kind of exploit or strategy would have come up.

It was all the rage in WotLK and it didn't account for BiS then either. It WILL be a thing, it'll be up to the community to decide whether they care.

Engineering is probably the profession that has the most usage in pvp. grenades and stuff. if your goal is to pick the profession that has the most advantages in pvp, i would say engineering is the better choice here.

It wasn’t just one guy, and there have been many people who died from going to extremes while playing a game.

It’s usually caused by a blood clot that forms in the legs from sitting and playing for extended periods of time. Once the person finally stands up the blood clot is freed, travels to their lung, and causes a pulmonary embolism.

SO engineering + which one is best.

Because we're all about the Prof Plums.

Lol did you forget that the Mana Igniting Cord exists or something?
---
This kind of blatant misinformation doesn't really help the debate about itemization in the slightest.
---
You want to take engineering for maximum raid dps anyway.
---
Beautiful. Barrens.chat website is the prettiest forum I've ever seen as well.
---
Keep in mind that druids, paladins and shamans will be expected to heal towards end game. Druid and Paladin tanks weren't really a thing in vanilla.
---
If the majority of players were actual citizens of said country, then yeah it wouldn't happen, depending on the country of course.     
---
They would most likely go with what makes the country the most money.
---
Yeah, I should have mentioned the MC farming runs weren't full clears. At first we were clearing up through Major Domo and then up through Ragnaros until our main tank got geared with FR. But we went through 4 tanks that left the guild as soon as they got their FR, so that took a while . . .
---
&gt; I don't know what fantasies you have about Blizzards wealth, but it's not enough to buy a country.
---
It is however enough to pay someone under the table to perform ddos-attacks and to bypass ddos-protection to make the server unplayable and therefore somewhat useless.
---
BiS until C'thun.

Yeah well, back in WotLK they did the math for Yogg-Saron 0 keepers mode too, and they said he was unkillable, yet Stars got a legit kill confirmed by Blizzard.

Just somebody saying "he did the Math and it's undoable" is not necessarily enough to believe him, especially if he doesn't publish his methodology. Anybody can make a claim like that.

Well, i am considering picking up a Valve Index, which should ship a couple months before 2020. Not quite full blown Oasis, but not far off.

I'm switching jobs this month so I don't have any PTO in reserve, and I don't really wanna ask a lot of time off so quickly. I'll just level normally then request PTO later on when I'll be aiming for ranks. I want R11 at least, which I think I can get while working. Then hopefully I can take like a month off and rush to R13.
---
No to both i believe
---
pet normalization as far as ive heard happened before 1.12 
---
and xp in bgs started in WOTLK i think
---
Well of course mining goes with engi in general. If you want to level up engi with gold and the AH, i dont think theres much difference in the remaining professions. Not sure if tailoring nets was added in TBC or earlier. But if you dont plan on picking a purely gathering profession, tailoring and enchanting is cheaper to level since they dont need gathering. I would go with mining engineering personally, and if you can make decent gold from anyting aside from gathering, drop mining and pick anything else up.

Yeah, I do. And this is crazy wrong. Balanced has changed enormously. It's people's perception of balance that gets called meta. People are ignorant, lazy, and habit driven. They won't accept something is better when it requires investigation, testing, reviewing their own biases, and potential disruption to their place in the hierarchy of performance in a guild. 
---
&gt;&gt; hardcore guilds will bench you exactly the same
---
This is just plain not true as well. Truly hardcore guilds are the ones doing the testing and investigations required to find the niche uses, the best builds, the optimal utility, they are the ones on the forefront of change. Its the guilds who tell themselves they're hardcore, who follow the meta, who will bench you, because they can't do the testing and investigations themselves, and so can't see why now this class excels when it previously didn't. The hardcore define the meta, the wannabe hardcore enforce it.
---
&gt;&gt;Why make Classic at all 
---
Because what made classic truly enjoyable isn't the balance, isn't the raids, the open world content, or the pvp. It was being immersed in a world with all of those things, it was putting in hours and hours and hours of effort and being rewarded, it was the community that developed, and feeling like you had a place within it. People don't love classic because warriors were the best tanks. Does it contribute to their love? Maybe, but it's still worth bloody talking about.
---
A lot of tier pieces aren't BiS for a lot of classes. Its kind of a downer, cause they look so cool, but yeah its how it be in classic
---
As you said, SM/ruin lock is probably best for this.
---
Frost mage's pvp and pve spec have enough differences its ok for this but not great, also once we are at AQ+ pve should be fire
---
30/0/21 shaman is the pvp spec and is decent PvE also....its not the ideal raiding spec without mana tide and stuff, but its still pretty good, and shamans are enough in demand you might be able to get away with it if your guild isnt too hardcore/for the early raids at least
---
MM hunter PvE spec is pretty solid in PvP still
---
I think there are 31/5/15 or something warrior offtank specs which would still be decent PvP?  Probably would only have 1 offtank like this in a raid max though? Im not sure
---
Idk on healers
---
From my experience on Nostalrius, there's 2 reasons why we didn't take any hybrids. (we still had a feral tank and a SP though)
---
First getting enough healers was already super hard, so by forcing the hybrid classes to play healer we could actually manage to raid and even have people in backup. If we didn't do this we would have been lacking healers pretty much every week. 
---
The second reason is jealousy. Even if the player was a real try hard, we couldn't allow him to play hybrid because if we allowed it, some of the healers would also want to play hybrid. "Why can he play hybrid and i can't ? It's not fair. /gquit". 
---
So if you take an hybrid, not only are you not getting a healer, but you also risk losing healers. It didn't even have anything to do with if the hybrid is good enough to replace a DPS, it was 100% about having enough healers to raid.
---
Many people don't understand how freaking hard it is to manage a guild in vanilla WoW, especially managing your roster. It's a game that you have to grind alot so people get burned out really frequently. You always need to over recruit to anticipate those guys leaving. WoW vanilla is as i said a game where people invests a lot of time into and expect rewards for it. In serious guilds (i'm not even talking about hardcore guilds) you can not afford to not raid because "oh well today we didn't have enough healers". It's really really important that the guild manages to always raid, as soon as there are problems with the raids, the moral of the guild goes down, conflict over trivial stuff erupts. Some guilds disbands over stuff like that. 
---
So yeah, unless your guild is doing really good with its healer numbers, it's a really bad idea to take hybrids in your roster.
---
More like you watched that Skarmshitter get told how bad his BiS was / wrong and copied from that.
---
Raids. I started playing like 10 months before BC came out. No one was raiding because BC was about to come out. I didn't get to do a god damn thing lol.
---
I'm literally just going to pick a healer class just to secure myself an easier time getting into a raiding group and just raid.
---
Probably level an alt once I get to that point. No dual spec, so it feels almost necessary to have fun outside of raiding.
---
Is the 30/0/21 shaman spec for healing in pve or for dps you mean? Thanks
---
There are two belts better than it in MC/BWL if you're a mage and THREE if you're a Warlock or Shadow Priest.
---
Not sure what wonky stat weights you're using, but spell hit isn't worth THAT much.
---
Extra whitening Nintendo flip
---
On a pserver right now, I didnt realise til the other day lol, but I've raised up to aq40 with a guy who plays enhancement with nightfall. Nightfall is noticeable, as are his buffs to the melee group. No one has any issue.
---
Great fucking vid

---
You would be surprised by the amount of things pservers are capable of nowadays, however the quality compared to Blizzard might be different.
---
Unless your summer vacation is in September I have some bad news...
---
It can also be done if the player plays so bad that hes just taken for the luls
---
Well this goes back waaaaay back to vanilla open beta. I play a ranger type in every ame. The lone wolf, walking the forest. Often lawful neutral or chaotic good alignment. So naturally i will play a hunter. Funny thing is, i never played one. Back in the day i wanted to play a nightelf hunter. Friends wanted to play horde. i HATED it. so i picked the race i hated the most and the class i hated the most out of spite. thus began my wow career as an undead rogue. throughout the years i fell in love with the character, the faction, the race, everything. so i will play horde again, but this time orc female hunter. the only one that holds a bow in the proper way other than female nightelf.

Thats my plan. Healer to 60 and raid/dungeons. Level an alt when I'm not doing that. Play at my own pace. I played regularly from vanilla to the end of WotLK and I quit 1 week into Cata.
---
&gt; Everyone starts as some random little shits who randomly get slaughtered by murlocs, gnolls, gators, and whatever you may encounter
---
It gives weight to the actual world. If you go out there without a care, you will die. The world is dangerous, you have to tread carefully and if you go too far off the beaten path things may turn ugly for you.
---
One of my favorite features in the game is the invisible ghosts see in Darkshore that might kill you randomly if you explore the abandoned houses. It's a cursed land, you shouldn't be there. Besides monsters the spirits might just kill you.
---
It makes the world feel real, because if you go out there in the real world to places you don't know, you might not turn out fine. It makes the world feel big and meaningful and it makes you feel like you're living in it.
---
Instead in retail you're basically in DisneyLand. Sure it's fun when you get there and spend a few hours messing around. Its super fun! But to actually "live" there? Nowhere near as amazing
---
You're on fire! Dope as always, thanks for creating these and icon packs.
---
Don’t forget world first on every raid boss kill.
---
We get proper leave and universal health care. It's nice being treated as a human unlike American workers.
---
Ayy , always nice to see one of the other 5 or so rets clearing current raid content. I see u on dat legacy players, on a side note how the fuck is “almondbutter” always top ret ?!?! That guys a monster.
---
Even if Classic is shitty, Blizzard won't let the pservs alive, they will be shut down asap.
---
&gt; Just out of curiosity, did you recently run into any solid objects at high speed?
---
Nah, just wasn't thinking far enough ahead, what you say makes sense.      
---
Wouldn't there still be a way around it though?       
---
Like, why isn't every single private server hosted in those countries?
---
Not trying to argue for or against private servers or copyright laws, just interested since i feel like Acti-blizz would do sketchy stuff if it meant more profit.
---
Obviously we have different opinions it seems. 
---
So, how do we balance then? I mean, yes technically it's better balanced in retail but RPG, itemization and classes being homogenized and drained from their abilities paid the price for this. 
---
It seems like blizzard need to start working on 2 games which makes no sense. Im going to agree with you on what people think when it comes to balance and meta, but these people are well... part of the game and always will be.
---
Also people benching others is a fact, and this has nothing to do with them being the investigators. Blizzard uses that info all the time, therefore patches and expansions etc etc.
---
How do we balance classes then? How do we add items and content without creating the bullshit that happened with ToC and IC dungeons? What you suggest is pretty much a second game, and what the two of us find for right or wrong means nothing since we are 2 people out from 1 million with different views.
---
You ask for a second game that goes along with Retail, which for me personally makes no sense, since i never asked for it. Am i right ? Ofc not... its just me, but then again you either open the box or you don't.
---
There’s also living action potion that can remove stubs currently on you.

Best professions for a hunter wanting to do PvE?
---
To you the same question as to others who posted the same assumption:  
---
How will Blizzard shut down a private server hosted in Tuvalu, Kiribati or Palau?
---
Don't these already exist
---
Yikes. Go play BFA bud
---
You’re gonna summon all the people who still play BFA and hate private servers with this post.
---
Yup, guild i raided with only did satzrdays from 14:00 to 20:00 :)
---
Maybe its not best to go with engineering first but rather a more gold efficient profession so Skinning + something else.
---
Unionize! Fair wages and benefits. I still get treated like a dog but at least I have a 401k and pension plan.
---
I had posted a question about this yesterday and it looks like they do plan to use phasing to be sure starting zones sent too congested.
---
&gt;Like, why isn't every single private server hosted in those countries?
---
Most of them are. And even if the're not, legal battles based on international copyright-law are not an easy matter, especially when you suddenly clash with "principle of use" laws, freedom of speech and similar problems.
---
It also depends a lot on the countries willingness to help Blizzard. If someone hosted a pserver in, say, Germany, that would probably get shut down quickly. If he does it in Bulgaria, there is a good chance the cease&amp;desist will end up in the wastebasket under some officers desk without even getting read.
---
&gt;since i feel like Acti-blizz would do sketchy stuff if it meant more profit.
---
It's a cost/effect risk-calculation. If the "sketchy stuff" carries a risk of backfiring at a too high cost, even an evil corporation doesn't do it.
---
Really well done, these logos got me HYPEDDD!
---
I am looking forward for it but only to watch. I dont have the time to invest  nor the space for a computer setup. Maybe a laptop, but i was so crazy addicted to wow i am scared it will be the same now ^^

Players in nihilum didn't really have a job to get in the way since all of them took time off

Pretty much why my PvE character is going to be a healer.

Group PvE : healing (if you plan to go for a hybrid class, you are pretty much forced to heal...)
---
PvP : both healing and dps, depending on the gear you equip and the playstyle you go for
---
Solo PvE : same as pvp
---
You have to grind to exalted.
---
Took this [ring] (https://itemization.info/item/15855) from 2nd BiS for feral tank to 5th.
---
Pirate ship might be private server, but I definitely remember the razorfen spire issue during vanilla, perhaps it was fixed during a later patch though. I remember this because it became the default procedure to tightly hug the outer wall when climbing the spiral.

You need to grind to Exalted with Gnomeregan.
---
Great work!
---
Let's see them then big boy
---
I didn't ask for anything, I feel like maybe what was originally brought up in my post has been lost. I don't feel it'll last because people will be frustrated knowing their class will never ever be able to match dps with another class. This isn't me, I'm going in knowing what to expect. But not everyone will, and the classic you love will dwindle in population as people leave because they see no hope on the horizon for what they want. Classic only happened because more than just the Nost people spoke up, when those people start to turn against it where will that leave the die hard classic fans? You gotta be willing to compromise at least a little or there may be nothing left to argue over. 
---
I also don't really get how lowering the mana cost of a shadow priest spells by 3% constitutes asking for a new game. It breaks nothing other maybe allowing them to be viable in Naxx. I don't care if they are viable, but would it bother you because it doesn't capture how it exactly happened in classic? If so that's great, tell me how you feel, if not, tell me about that. I just wanted people opinions on minor changes...

I mean it kind of does. Some classes do well with more density. Others start to struggle. It would still be a meaningful result but density is not irrelevant, at least not if the density is super high or low.
---
At practically 0 density, those that can tag best and have the best addons/macros and an infinite mousewheel they can keep spinning are most efficient.
---
true, but just so it's out there.

World of Warcraft Classic Remastered if game developers keep up their current shenanigans.

Canada is in the same boat unfortunately. Minimum paid vacation is 10 days a year, and that is what most people get. Once you are at a job for a few years you might get a third week and then work your way up there. Government workers tend to get more vacation time for the same amount of years served as compared to private sector workers.
---
Hahaha soo relatable
---
You did good. VERY good =)
---
Idk whats with the downvotes. This is a funny comment
---
That‘s illegal. Blizzard would perhaps explore every reasonable *legal* avenue. They would never collude to commit clear felonies like this that gets many people into jail and is traceable.

They are not a damn mafia. Ddosing other projects would be economical suicide.

How u gonna run any dungeon or get into a guild if your ignoring everyone around you.
---
To be honest, the big issues with private servers is not the scripting. It's more than okay, obviously some things aren't completely perfect and people talk all the time about "uh boss armor values" people really don't care. If it feels like vanilla and it's a fun game then that's more than enough. Nostalrious was the biggest pserver ever made and trust me there was so many bugs and errors on that server compared to newer servers you have no idea. The problem with private servers is the server hosts, all the drama and bad rep that it brings, and ofc classic itself basically killed vanilla pservers.
---
Taking 4 weeks as i feel anymore will throw me off going back to work while giving me easy enough time to get near or hit 60
---
Yeah, I agree with that.
---
My plan is to mostly roll Greed on the bullets, since most the top ranged weapons, including the BiS, are not guns. I'll roll Need on the Doomshots, and just save them for a worthy occasion, such as progression fights on difficult bosses or DPS check bosses.
---
They have sharding and dynamic respawn. How do you think it's playable with 8k people online?
---
And for the sub fee, buy one less hamburger a month and u have it
---
Most of them are in Russia, US laws are powerless there.
---
We're talking about grinding at high levels, if you have issues with tagging mobs from other players then grinding isn't really something you want to do or you would want to have a new spot.
---
The worst thing about this:
---
You cannot un-see it naow :D
---
Wow I remember sitting in the electronics section of my town's pre-supercenter Walmart staring at this box ceaselessly while my mom shopped
---
Toxic over a game that is borerline skilless for an FPS too.  That contributes to the toxicity.  You can step into that game and already feel like you’re amazing at it because the game does such a good job at giving you positive reinforcement for the most basic shit.  Ding head sounds, assists on kills if you tap them, heroes that require little to no aiming or planning.  
---
It’s like little league where everyone gets a trophy except its teens and adults so they think they did all the heavy lifting.  
---
That and throwers.

Let me know what you all think :) If you can hit this spot for a level or two you can make absolute BANK &lt;333
---
I'm rolling a nelf survival hunter with the entrapment talent. Meet me on the bridge to our base and wait for horde?
---
Because other countries are cheap and secure enough. The latency is better. They have better ddos protection.
---
A private server organization with a decent operations security can just migrate over to a plan B the second things get too bothersome.
---
There are some very big hosts with good latency such as Voxility who have a history of not bowing down to any legal threats. They are just very expensive but if things indeed get more difficult, then that will be (and is) the next option.
---
They do not have sharding on any private server.
---
Yikes.  BFA strawman, which has nothing to do with this topic or my comment.
---
They haven't succeeded in 15 years, what makes you think they'll succeed now?
---
I just hope they'll ban hard, only thing *we* can do is report RMT.
---
ah cool, thx!
---
I will tell you that i agree with this particular post. I personally don't care about my class being on top, its not something i expect from vanilla. I also see however a mass propaganda and hysteria on the forums where people be like "no one takes rets and druids" which is wrong and infuriates me to hell. This will hurt new players since they are fend false propaganda.People forgot to have fun over the years because Retail turned into a job instead of a game.
---
Hardcore and i mean HARDCORE guilds will be the people that wont take more than 1-2 ret paladins or Spriests. Rest will take them, and even hardcore guilds will take them after a while, after all you don't need 40 people, you need 20 to be decent, the rest can simply hop around.
---
It seems however that many people fun in the game comes only from what the DPS meter shows... My opinion on this matter? F-em, don't want them, no need them. If many leave because of this, what did we lose exactly? If you come here to find the game you loved, why do you care about tourists being here for the wrong reasons? 
---
I came as an ass in the last sentence, but i'd rather have less populated game than "my deeps is low, blizz fix or i quit".
---
Funny thing is we talked pretty much about raids and stuff but we never talked about PvP/RP/Solo/Leveling/Dungeons etc etc.
---
I mean, yea SP has mana issues but are monsters in PvP. War is OP dps but SUCK at solo play. Rets are a meme spec, but strong in PvP, great at healing/soloing, can tank decently esp. the undead dungeons.
---
The game you want is here, but i won't budge for people that suffer from severe tunnel vision. If DPS and competitive play is their thing, the can go right back in Retail or change genres with actual competitive games such as DoTA, CS etc. Every change, every QoL led us to Retail, and in our case it led us to quit and want classic. Im not going through this again, if they start changing im off to a different game.
---
If they change after 2 years, in 5 more we will again have people that want classic.
---
"I also don't really get how lowering the mana cost of a shadow priest spells by 3% "
---
That's you, remember though, there are 1 million just like you.
---
&gt; • No sub fee
---
I hope you're not trying to imply this is something positive? Free to play is one of the biggest issue with private servers. No paid staff meaning no decent customer support or quality control. People aren't scared in the slightest of losing their accounts, toxicity and botting is super rampant.
---
Wow! This is absolutely *amazing*! Awesome job :)
---
Looks awesome!
---
Hardcore guilds: 1-2 resto and maybe 1 feral
---
Casual guilds: anything goes
---
^(thanks for the info~)
---
There will definitely be Druid healers in raids, although they won’t be able to top the heal charts and they are more of a support for priests with their innovate spell. 
---
Unfortunately feral and balance don’t do anywhere near as much damage as other DPS classes so you’ll be stuck with restoration.
---
With that being said though I do think people this time around are going to be more flexible and lenient in raising. I don’t think it’s going to be too ‘professional’ where you won’t get allowed in if you’re not healing. Everyone’s just going to be having fun with it
---
Judging by past private servers, it always felt busy everywhere. That might be all the “grinding” we get - even if grinding means grinding mobs for quests. And my point was just an example. It works the other way around as well. If it is too dense and difficult to pull them one by one this screws over the balance as well.
---
so boring...
---
yep, if you want to maximize your time in groups you don't want to be a dps class
---
Well that sucks. Do you know if there's a way to test how my PC does with retail without subscribing? Maybe a trial acc or something (I'll have to download 100gb of crap first right won't I)
---
Tokens aren't what's wrong with bfa
---
I guess it depends if you’re going to be speed running to 60 or if you want to have a fun and easy time leveling.
---
IMO a paladin will be more rewarding at 60 with raid content, but a hunter will be a lot quicker and fun to level. 
---
I was considering going a pally to heal end game but I’m not sure if I’m going to enjoy the leveling myself
---
Viable with multiple healing specs and even a different role as feral offtank.  Druids are afforded a lot more opportunities in raiding than most classes.
---
Three plus is a good bet. Couple healers and an Offtank to soak up gear, make trash easier, and they'll superior to Warriors in a few situations.
---
I expect there won't be enough Druids for all the raiding guilds have one three and/or play well enough to fill feral roles.  So skilled players will be in demand.
---
If you looked at the math itself it's kinda a joke. I saw this post:
---
&gt;“Basically, every 60 seconds the encounter requires your raid to do roughly 230,000 damage in order to keep up with the various spawns,” he wrote in an ancient Warcraft forum post that’s been scrubbed from the internet. “Now, a 40-man raid can certainly accomplish that on a single target. But when some people are in C'Thun's stomach, and the targets of that DPS are spread throughout the room, and when clustering at all means that you get destroyed by a spawning tentacle or a jumping eye beam, the end result is simply impossible.”
---
Assuming 5 random players in the stomach, in a raid of 40 with 28 dps, say 4 dps in the stomach, you have 24 dps to do 230.000 damage in 60 seconds, which is a DPS of fucking 124
---
Some of you might be fine with it, especially those who come from BFA and don't understand the impact and importance of gold in classic, but there would for sure be a major walkout if that happened.
---
Hi, /u/smykk
---
For many of us it's a nostalgia ride. I know I'll personally help anyone along this journey. I want others to experience the joy I did when I was younger playing it.
---
If that is what you want
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
I played the shit out of dk1 and still go back to it sometimes. I'm scared of a remake though because modern games off this type usually have wonky physics and it just never comes close to the clean movement and animations of dk1. War for the overworld is a prime example of this, it just felt weird
---
I can't take the gamble unless there's an official statement.  :(
---
Perfectly willing to neglect everything else in the pursuit of months of killing players for a tabard.  If they aren't awarded it would be not worth.  So risky.
---
Send the admins enough c&amp;d's to exhaust them financially and force them to settle.
---
lol this is actually a really good video. I did not expect that from a 400 subscriber video
---
True for balance, a bit less for feral. Optimization has been done regarding feral dps that allows you to be a competitive at some points (in MC and in BWL, clearly no more in naxx even with AQ gear)
---
Don't really care about leveling fast, will be going quite slow either way.
---
yeah ya fuckin mutt
---
Nice, they look like MTG expansions.
---
I really love your borders. Teach me how.
---
I love them all except for the colors on the Onyxia one.
---
Anybody whose played on anything resembling a private server can say the same so, lol, and there’s technical reasons for it as well but I’m too lazy to type out something to someone who is 27 years old browsing a subreddit spewing false information convinced you’re right I deal with enough of people like you at work all week
---
If they're in those countries I imagine they just ignore cease and desist letters...
---
Excellent job dude. Love it
---
Are you ok?
---
Warsong logo looks really good
---
You can never be fully prepared for barrens chat.
---
I like that because I don't agree I must be a BFA player.  Private servers are hot piles are steaming dog shit and those of you who wallowed in those cesspools wouldn't understand the importance of enforcement of server rules, lack of corruption from staff, or bans for faction collusion.
---
GMs selling gold and items on pservers is worse than tokens.  Most around here are just upset they can't call players the nword when they get pissy.
---
Probably just a character model display bug.
---
Sure thing sport, arguments are difficult to elaborate.
---
BIS for hunters too
---
It also creates a situation where there's some pets are objectively "the best".
---
Some recent private servers have seen every hunter worth their salt getting Lupos f.ex.
---
&gt;Bad: All linear pathing dungeons.
---
Bad: Lore getting kinda weird with draenei/Blood elves being crammed in horde/alliance
---
Bad: Smaller world (smallness amplified by flying mounts)
---
personal opinion bad: Faster casting/reward to spastically bouncing around vs position
---
Edited in bads:
---
Bad: Levelling from 1 - 58 felt much more boring due to "balance" changes of items and quest difficulty
---
Bad: Meeting stone.
---
Bad: Level 30 mounts and cheaper prices. (rest in peace shimmering flats experience, only vanilla.)
---
Because some people just don't agree with these points.
---
Linear dungeon? So what
---
Lore ? Who cares
---
Smaller world? Better world
---
Leveling felt boring? Leveling was buffed to the point where you could actually level with quests and not get constantly fucked and needed to grind like in vanilla
---
Meeting stones? People liked getting summoned, it allowed them to do other shit while waiting for groups.
---
Basically all your negative points are just personal shit you don't like because you like vanilla. I like vanilla too, and I'm not the biggest fan of TBC, but at least I can see past my biased opinions and realize that TBC was a pretty great game.
---
Ah classic response 
---
“Nice argument bro”
---
&gt;keep telling yourself that
---
That was an excellent retort as well man, you seem extremely well-educated. :)
---
Pretty neat spot, usually kill all the ones I go past. However I prefer the basilisk cave. Easy grinding spot with good gold per hour for its level range.
---
Was quest sharing part of Classic? Or did that come in BC?
---
I always enjoyed collecting the way off random dungeon quests and then sharing them with my friends when we did the dungeon.
---
Do you like being an asshole? Then rogue is the perfect class for you!
---
Most guilds will accept plenty of druid healers, it really won't be an issue, if a guild needs healer they will accept you.
---
As for resto only being viable, well with serious tryhardness you can do fine as feral dps or even tank. Boomkin however is way way worse.
---
Now *this* makes me hyped.
---
I said "those of you", not that all of you were. You sure got defensive fast.
---
Private servers _are_ a cesspool, and the lack of any sub option does mean the server staff is... well, virtually nonexistent. But I'd much rather have a playable game and have to put a few "free speechers" on ignore, than a ruined economy. The corruptions and shady bans you speak of depends a lot on the server. If you play on... well, I don't think I can mention names on here, but some private servers are more playable than others. Just gotta know which one to pick.
---
Which houses in Darkshore? I've never heard of this
---
The one he’s thinking of died after drinking nothing but energy drinks to stay awake for something like 72 hours. I can’t remember if it was the sleep deprivation that did it or the toxin buildup from not going to the bathroom.
---
Is getting to level 58/59 then repeccing healer to get the last few levels from dungeons to gear up a viable idea? Or should I just get 60 then worry about gearing?
---
I haven’t played retail since Wrath and I don’t remember what tokens are or what they do. 
---
When players now are worried Blizz may add them to Classic, what are they worried about exactly?
---
Now this was on a private server, so it may not behave the same, but I once did a BRD where we got to tomb of the seven, near the end of the dungeon. We had skipped the whole dungeon by doing the lava jumping. We lost a guy on the pack before the boss but since he did not need loot from the boss we told him to run but not enter the dungeon until we had killed the boss.
---
He completely ignored it, so once he entered he got in combat with the event. One of the minibosses decided to aggro on him, and it ran through the door, pulled the ENTIRE dungeon on the way to the entrance. The poor guy did not realize what had happened so he got stomped as he tried to run towards us before 50+ elite mobs came rushing back towards the boss room where we all just stood in confusion.
---
Yeah that fucking NOOB **REEEEEEE**
---
I cant wait to to do those BRD full clears.
---
10/10
---
I’ll be honest dude, people like you are why this subreddit is starting to suck dick, change your attitude.
---
If Blizzard fails at creating a close vanilla experience with NO major changes many others such as myself will go straight to the next private server that emulates the closest true vanilla experience, and “Nu-Vanilla” will die and so will Blizzards chance at recouping their fanbase after their last atrocious Blizzcon.
---
If you level up with a healer there's no point
---
No. The only shield that works like that is the engineering shield and even that one dont have 100% chance to take damage.
---
What is the best **gun** in the game?
---
For clarity: Used as a weapon by a Hunter, not just for stats and pulling.
---
Wow that's really good
---
You would probably die trying to pull even 4+ packs in Full T3.
---
If you got ten people killing mobs while you tag em there's no point too.. Wanna get more specific?
---
Meant in the same way you win at naughts and crosses, but probably more like connect 4, you only win when they lose(make a mistake)
---
The normalization was things like removing shadow damage from Lupos. Pet attack speed wasn’t normalized until BC. The Rake will be worth getting because of easy access to 1.2 attack speed. 
---
Correct me if I am misremembering anyone.
---
It's very nice for Hunters as well. Although not as nice as it is for a warrior. I guess it's decent for Shamans as well.
---
Taking my time. I'm going to level progressions/first aid/cooking/fishing whilst leveling to 60.
---
Once there, my end game goal is to get 0.5 and maybe do some light raiding.
---
really nice
---
I’m pleased you didn’t make a darkmoon faire logo

---
I think my post gives a good indication of my personality and the guild I would like to achieve. Looking for some ideas and constructive criticism.
---
Pretty sure it was always available to both factions. The thing is though that the NPC where you could turn in Juju's was located in Orgrimmar and not Everlook like in later patches.
---
Well, they openly said on panel that there will be no WoW token in classic, and I actually believe them. Because they will sell more tokens anyway, due to players buying and trading retail vs. classic gold (the classic player then converts the retail gold for game time).
---
Of course they could sanction it, but that would be even harder than tracking down Chinese providers.
---
What I'm curious about is how they handle the "soft" microtransactions that were already available in Vanilla, like Blizzcon items, TGC Codes or collectors edition items.
---
I believe they did. Hence they discontinued items which reduced mana cost by a flat amount. Such bonuses were moved to set bonuses. So that Blizzard could have better control, and if any stacking would occur, they would know about it in advance.
---
You dont know of the Backdoor do you? :D
---
As I've found out in beta patch .10 dwarf mages were no longer create-able, however, ones already created weren't lost. Is it possible there is a max level dwarf mage somewhere in the game?
---
You... monster...
---
Is there really going to be no pvp reward when game releases?
---
BFA happened
---
&gt;it not only decreases the rate of glancing blows
---
Afaik it doesnt. It only reduces the damage penalty from them on top giving a small amount of crit and hit, something like 0.04% per point.
---
- guilds getting like 4 bonereavers edge during first raid lock
---
Oh nice we have a guy with an inside track on when the release is.
---
Release date/proof plz.
---
If you refuse to acknowledge how condescending your comment was and won't meet me half way on the understanding that Joe in his basement who funds his server through small donations and sells digital goods to players can produce a preferable, my lord even comparable, product to what a multibillion dollar corporation maintains then this conversation simply can't continue.
---
You get downvoted for stating factually correct information.
---
This sub truly is a gathering of emotionally unstable neckbeards.
---
Agreed. These people taking multiple weeks off are fucking nuts. I might take a 3 day weekend if there’s nothing else going on.
---
Int in vanilla is spell crit, and it’s take between 55 and 61 (depending on caster class) to gain 1% of spell crit. It’s actually a massive buff.
---
Leveling the skill required a certain number of successful casts.
---
I believe it was like: 1-25 requires one cast, 26-50 requires two, 51-75 requires 3, etc.
---
So yes, other than travelling to trainers to rank you up, you could fish in a lowbie area
---
You don't have to play what Blizzard produces.  Doesn't make private servers any less of a hot steaming pile of shit.
---
You're so fucking cool bro!!!
---
Yeah the new trial system is that you can always play characters under lvl 20. That would be a good test because Classic is based on the Legion client, so it’ll be fairly similar to BfA
---
Going to make a point of finding this and pointing it out in every RFK group
---
nah u rite clessic releez june 1nd 1000 % xdddfsdfdDDDFDsfdfsdfd
---
Tokens in retail WoW allow players to either use in game currency to purchase battle.net balance OR use real money to purchase a token that could then be sold in-game for in game money.
---
People don't want these coming to Classic because it allows players to officially purchase gold, thereby disrupting the economy and potentially creating a p2w system.
---
Good read. Good repost
---
not even remotely funny because I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard trys to weasel tokens in somehow...
---
Very cool
---
Who?  I was looking through the itemization database when it got updated and saw that Gyth's skull used to be green, which i didn't remember due to not being a warrior in vanilla. Due to people telling me it was apparently "always blue" I did a bit of googling, found http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/thread-4725.html which confirms it.
---
No I quite clearly said that some will be fine with it. I also said that many won't be. You are making a chicken out of a feather here.
---
Private servers have never been produced by "Joe in his basement", it's always been a group project. They're already in a state where people are reducing their claims about private servers being incorrect by claiming the armor values are a percentage off or two. 
---
The fact that you think private servers are so bugged as to not even be comparable to the real deal does indeed lend credence to the theory that you in fact haven't even played on them and are coming from BfA. There, _now_ I said you're a BFA player.
---
The token bought and sold in game is like a transaction with an npc or a real player? Or blizzard straight up gives you gold like a gold farmer would?
---
Love this thread, it will be great to link to when people argue that MC/BWL could be challenging in 1.12 with proper scripts.
---
Also i just want to make sure, they wont be reverting these changes right? Or did i misunderstand the blue-post? From my understanding they would only remove items introduced in later patches, not revert changes made to items.
---
I’d rather play that hot steaming pile of shit than whatever you call retail.
---
I wonder if we're going to start hearing stories about people starving themselves or their kids again once the pvp rank race starts.
---
Awesome, just the molten core's font feel something off, and should be Onyxia's Lair. But it's still a great work!
---
Loot traiding is raid only which is fine because who raids with pugs anyways
---
Sharding isnt going to be in the game anywhere but the starting zones at launch
---
Right click report does suck tho
---
This is what coldsnap and snap steps are for. In Frost We Trust!
---
In your opinion what makes a perfect guild and perfect GM?
---
If that your toon you no-lifed pretty hard back then
---
These look fantastic great work. What did you use to make these they look so detailed and well done?
---
The ganking is a real problem on PvP servers. When you are in the middle of killing a dozen mobs, there is not much you can do against basically any class if they decide to jump you.
---
Hey, you know what? You can have your opinion. That's just fine.
---
I'll go ahead and melt with my 2x 1.3 speed daggerinos and consecutive white crit hits proccing overpower all the time while you wait for your next swing.
---
This type of post really doesn't accomplish anything. Any class can be leveled in any spec. Some are slightly better/faster than others. Yet, all those who rolled retbulls, arcanogods and survivalist ninjas also had just as much fun as  us two, if not more!
---
You should play what you actually want to if you have little time. If playing in a group or doing 5-mans is more important than a specific class, I’d recommend healer. It’s easy to gear, easy to play and usually in high demand.
---
Yes, that's my primary gripe with Skyrim. If I want to RP as a potato farmer who happens to be into stealing, let me. I don't want to lead your bloody guild.
---
Might not be your case but cant count all the times a hunter runs out of ammo halway in my 5 mans
---
Doesn't it take something like 200+ hours to get to level 60?
---
You don't even list your loot system, and one of the most important factors for figuring how competitive a guild is: time from server start to raiding. 2 weeks? 2 months? That will pull hugely different groups of people.
---
Very contested, yet still profitable
---
Your name is depressing.
---
Why? Do you consider a life without 10+ hours of video games per day cool? It's just normal.
---
What do you find to be the best loot system and your preferred raid start time?
---
I think we’re still on for summer
---
over the years they fricked this game up so much it's unbelievable. What did they think ffs...
---
oh, wait, they thought $$$$$$$$
---
Maybe, I figured he was referring to the Chinese guy that played for 19 hours straight in an internet café.
---
Wow! I love these! I get nostalgic just looking at them. Well done
---
I bet it'll be released in early August.
---
No straight up gold. It's s a transaction. 
---
You buy a token for 20€.
---
You put it in the Auction House. 
---
Another player buys it in gold for whatever the price is.
---
The other player can use it to gain 13€ in credit to its battlenet account.
---
I personally don't think it's that bad. It obviously creates some inflation as a player A that has time farms gold for a player B that doesn't. 
---
But not necessarily. Maybe the player A would have use the gold another way. Maybe player B would have put the effort to farm the gold.
---
I downloaded III on Steam, just as good as it was back then.
---
I would say these gloves are definitely worth an epic mount.
---
Tell that to the Nostalrius staff.
---
Ahh, that’s a great idea. Twinking was some of the best experiences I’ve had in wow. A 28 sounds super fun
---
He has the same feelings as others.
---
BFA just isn't fun. Its not an MMO, and its hardly worth any amount of time investment to feel good about.
---
Think anout 8 days of gameplay if you know what your doing. Keep in mind ill be going for 18-20 hours a day for 2 weeks straight 🙄
---
Oh boy, ur getting my hopes up for the future! I hope this happens truely! :D
---
You will never replace it.
---
It's a transaction with a real player. There is no extra gold created, the owner of the gold just switches.
---
The official argument back then was that the age and situation of the playerbase changed - many now have a job, a family, less time to play the game. So they thought it was fair to bring two kinds of players together: those with a lot of surplus gold could cover their gametime (or buy other Blizzard goods), while those without as much playtime could cover their gold costs ingame.
---
And of course the token system ruined the goldselling market pretty much over night.
---
Both of these arguments are solid and sound, but it still made the game "pay to win" to some degree, as you can buy yourself into raids easily and other endgame content easily for the right price.
---
I haven't called retail anything.  You should work on your reading comprehension.
---
You're definitely going to get addicted again.
---
It's not an opinion - that's the whole point of this post. It's worse.
---
I smell an anti-vaxxer.
---
That might actually kill you. 😄
---
what
---
Yes thats fine, though i wouldnt say you need to bother respeccing until you start raiding really.
---
my opinion of a perfect guild was be pretty chill, just groups of friends that play with other groups of friends without drama. ie say 8 group of friends that all individually get on or can at least be civil with eachother, and perfect gm? one that lays down the "law" and doesnt play favourites, or at least someone that doesnt favor one person over another just because they play togthere a ton, ie judges people on what they do, not how long they known eachother.
---
...except if they favor me, cmon man... give me that epic healing trinket... ill run you thru rfc on ur alt....
---
w00t
---
The point of video games is to have fun so yeah, telling someone they shouldn't dual wield is 100% opinion.
---
You do need the final level, just have it as done as possible as early as possible. Have your friends run you through the instances you need early on. I had a friend with a main on a different account than his twinks so he could run his own toons. That was dedication!
---
Curious question, I know little about pservers. Do the people running them have the source code, create their own source code, or a mix? If they are using the original, do they have the capability of fixing all the bug, to include but nit limited to the bugs that were/are still in classic?
---
I’m just saying I’d rather play on a private server for vanilla than play retail with tokens and whatever else retail it has. No need to be in super defensive mode. You came to a classic wow subreddit after all.
---
And it increases your armor. Agi is right behind stam for warriors with sufficient defense.
---
He's not saying "Don't dual-wield because it's not fun.", he's saying "Don't dual-wield because it's ***WORSE***."
---
Try attacking the actual position instead of making one up yourself.
---
Yea that is some good advice for sure. I know i was worried about joining a pre existing guild roster where the members could likely collude or be biased towards new members. If your not having fun whats the point?
---
[Bloodmail Boots](https://itemization.info/item/14616) go from completely useless to BiS until BWL for fury warriors. I bet most warriors will still be wearing them into AQ40. This along with [Brigam Girdle](https://itemization.info/item/13142) (already mentioned here) make pre-raid hit cap MUCH easier for DW warriors to achieve.
---
Hi, /u/karpatika_wow

---
9/7
---
&gt; Any class can be leveled in any spec. Some are slightly better/faster than others. 
---
Yeah, obviously. He could have added "if you want to level most efficiently" to his post but that should have been inferred.
---
What’s their reasoning for not including wsg in the second content update? Isn’t that when they are adding honor?
---
I've seen conflicting information regarding druid healers, so I thought I'd get opinions here. If enough of my friends end up playing classic, they'll make me play horde and I'll probably play druid so I can tank dungeons if I need to and mainly raid heal. To be blunt, I don't want to be stuck on a sub par class if the other healers in a raid aren't as good or geared. Is it worth playing druid in my case, or should I just play priest?

80.000 unified Pepegas talking about Classic!
---
This is super informative and thank you so much. So how would you compare rank 10 gear to tier 1? I know I read that tier 1 is better than tier 2 for dps as long as you have a t2 Hunter proccing expose weakness but I’m not sure if it’s true. I have a lot of questions so should I just PM you ?
---
A website based on this theory: wowclassiccountdown.com
---
shut up nerd
---
Take a healer, ull find group fast without the much needed farming of consumables that tanking requires
---
&gt; than a ruined economy
---
Priv realms economy gets ruined much quicker than Classic will. I don't think tokens change economy for the worse, it will mostly just shift some of the grinding away from chinese farmers to western people.
---
One thing that doesn’t get said a lot has nothing to do with WoW: be a good leader.
---
Keep a level head, pay attention to how your guild members are feeling, listen to and respect their thoughts on the guild, resolve disputes as fairly as possible, lead by example, etc.
---
I’ve seen a lot of GMs who follow the rules of their loot system to a T but who rage out/show bias/never take criticism/give themselves special privileges and then wonder why people don’t like them lol

easier to get into groups ? you ever thought about starting groups ?

Nostalrius was hosted by OVH, a french company **that has a US branch.** Therefore, you could threaten them with c&amp;d letters.
---
If you host a PServer on Tuvalu.tv, you can shove your c&amp;d where the sun doesn't shine, as TTV is operated by the Information and Communications Technology Department of the Government of Tuvalu.
---
I'm not answering your question, since I see others have already covered it. Just giving my opinion.
---
I think tokens are a smaller evil that helps us get rid of or greatly reduce a greater evil, namely gold farmers and sellers, and potentially hackers as well. My conclusion is that I would not be against having these tokens in WOWC.
---
Had to repost and edit this because this sub blocks many key words:
---
So basically all private servers comes from the Mang0s project, which basically did the fundamental building blocks, note none of this is the same as what blizzard had, it's just emulation.
---
N0st started out as what we call "stock mang0s", basically just this thing, and then they slowly worked on it, making improvements on it.
---
n0st did pretty decent work and was considered the golden standard when it closed, and private servers were a bit lost because they didn't share what they had accomplished.
---
This changed tho and a project called elys1um got the "core" so all the source code and stuff, and had a big popular server. However elys(ium) was very corrupt and soon it was threaten to release the source core, and elys1um decided that instead of having it leaked, they would just make it opensource.
---
So ever since then, we have a opensource core of what's considered the best private server scripting by most(there's another competing server who would burn down my house for saying that), and people can work on the opensource and submit bug reports etc.
---
But no, it's all emulation and adding vanilla values, the only thing we have that's made from blizzard, is the client the game is run on.
---
The biggest things for me would be:
---
1.	Reliability, including holding the guild accountable for their reliability. 
---
2.	Be calm and level headed. Guilds will always have guild drama. It’s best for the GM to stay out of it and be a calm voice of reason. 
---
3.	Communicate with the guild. You can’t please everyone with every decision. But if you explain your decision and make people feel like they’re in the loop and being heard they’re far more likely to accept the decision, even if they don’t like it, than if they’re in the dark. 
---
Basically the same things that make a good manager in the real world.
---
You are really making me lean more and more towards Priest. Would you say Undead or Troll is the better choice? I would choose Undead probablybut if the Troll racial matters a lot Id be willing to compromise.
---
The real endgame.
---
Not sure how to respond, but I assume you don't want an "opinion" about your plan to intentionally get dodged. This is post is purely informational since a lot of new players may believe that dual-wielding is the better option.
---
For raids yes, but for dungeons their flexibility is unmatched and they are good enough that it isn't an issue. By far the easiest class to get into/spam 5-mans.
---
What are your favorite loot systems? I'm torn between loot council and DKP/GDKP.
---
im thinking of the possibility of using lootcouncil in raid group 1 and dkp in raid group 2?
---
Unfortunately even with everyone going engineering, actual mining materials are rarely expensive.
---
God no. I mean I liked the movie, but they changed so many things from the book. I get parts being changed to keep pace and interest in the movie. The arcade game scene being one that wouldn't have translated as well to a movie, but still... Just leave us be where we are now, and imagine where the characters go from there. Don't ruin it by giving us a stupid sequel.
---
Yes a 10+ year old game has changed over the years. I don’t get why people are surprised by this.
---
In classic I was mostly into pvp, mained a MM hunter and ret Paladin.
---
For hunter I did a lot of MC raiding and only got to the first 3/4 bosses (fairly sure we didn't skip around and did them roughly in order from closest to entrance to end.
---
My favourite thing as hunter was kiting the boss away to the beasts room in UBRS and then using feign death to reset him. (I know it's not a raid)
---
Then I fell in love with paladin and more specifically ret paladin, grinding AV rep to exhalted and got the unstoppable force. I raided some of MC, did heaps of ZG, got invited into a ragnaros kill and an AQ20 clear.
---
For raids I was geared up in healing gear, but had a holy/ret build that was mostly ret. I was also a cleanse bot basically, fairly sure most of these raids I had barely any idea what mechanics and stuff were but I was doing my part. I also felt like a true paladin laying down my life to save the raid from a complete wipe/run back when I used divine intervention on someone who could res.
---
Apart from that I really enjoyed doing the raids and the few epics I managed to get felt really really good.
---
Friend suggested I go proper holy and join them for proper raiding, I actually might have done naxx and other raids. But I preferred smacking people slowly with my big mace ;)
---
Never fully cleared MC/ZG or did other raids and I'm looking forward to actually experiencing all of them properly this time around.
---
My favorite was piccolo of the flaming fire.
---
So yuckie seems like a pleasant guy with lots of friends
---
Yea I was just thinking about how everyone was on Ethernet back when wow was released, and how everything is wifi now.
---
holy shit 6 weeks? youre basically off as much as you work. 
---
I believe i get 4 days a year off. yes i hate my fucking life.
---
these are my current thoughts on my guild and thought process

---
Have you leveled 1x vanilla before?
---
You already level slow, how much slower do you need to enjoy the world?
---
the best part is, you get to go home after to play more classic!!
---
thats a wonderful comment about .3 and explaining every decision in detail!
---
Yep, dual wield, proc overpower with the extra crit chance talent, switch to a 2h, take out half their hp bar with an overpower, pull out your daggers again and wait for the proc.
---
Living on unemployment checks is the best way to enjoy true vanilla experience
---
Pretty sure that most desktop users go by eth still. I guess the more casual gamer who probably play on laptop is fine on wifi. Mmo doesnt suffer on wi-fi like fps players might either.
---
Try to avoid rested exp I guess.
---
im torn between dkp and loot council. maybe lootcouncil for raid grp 1 and dkp or GDKP for grp 2.
---
yeah you should probably not do that
---
The devs almost didn't know what they were doing until about Patch 1.10.  From what I've watched and read about the development of WoW, it's clear to me that it originally was going to be a lot more like other MMORPGs instead of redefining the entire genre as endgame-instance-focused.  It feels like they made this decision very, very late into development and so spent a lot of time throughout Classic fixing items to suit this direction.  Many items never really got properly fixed.  TBC introduced the complete standardization of gear stats that has continued ever since outside of when they attempt to do funny proc-based weapons or trinkets.
---
I hope they do it at the same time. Keep the retail people away from the servers so its not so crowded on launch.
---
I've been trying to find a good priest setup with a slight unoptimized healing build that allows for some solo grinding.
---
Priest gets access to holy nova aoe farming, if you can find good locations for it (before DME opens). 
---
But I'll have at least another set for sure, that's not really an option.
---
As a warrior, when would I need to go protection to tank over just carrying a 2nd set of gear? I'll be fury. 
---
I've heard Strat+ but it seems to be debated a bit!
---
would you mind pasting this comment on my other post about the perfect GM for everyone to see. Thank you!
---
Well that's why I posted the article. Yes it's league of legends players but it shows how many more people use wifi in North America vs Korea for example and it's effects. I would guess that there are a much higher percentage of Wow users using wifi now than there was in 2004.
---
But you're right, for an mmo not a big deal
---
There is already no customer support planned for classic, so...
---
everything else im ok
---
Invite a friend to your party and have him follow you around doing nothing.
---
Yes, multiple times to 60. I personally don't feel it takes that long. :)
---
Started editing as I went. Added a bit about loot systems. 
---
I do like the two tier system. One that’s more progression focused and one that’s more casual.
---
That is a fair point.
---
One of the biggest nerfs was to [Spirit of Aquementas](https://itemization.info/item/11904). It's just a decent offhand now, but the old mana reduction effect was completely busted, especially for paladins. ~83 mp5 just for spamming Flash of Light -- nearly four times more than Warmth of Forgiveness, a trinket that drops from the Four Horseman -- and Illumination still granted the full mana cost from crits, so it even scaled with gear. 
---
And you got this thing as a reward from a simple questline that any healing class could solo. Definitely one of the most extreme examples of nonsensical vanilla itemization I can think of.
---
*Laughs in Hunter
---
Oh yeah, and then there's that. I'd love to turn that off as well. Hahaha
---
Hm okay
---
Well, unfortunately you are one in a few, it's unlikely that blizzard will go out of their way to add a NPC/option just for you.
---
what a strange resolution
---
no
---
Slow enough to get quests without turning gray. :(
---
The racial for dwarfs is Rams,.  Gnomes have the robo chickens
---
I loved arenas, blood elf starting zone was the first thing I saw when I logged into the game and I remember TBC as the best and most happy period of my life. I don't need a pro and con list for it, I just want to relive that again.
---
Not to mention, I *will* target an aoe farming mage even if I've been ignoring everyone else in the zone because that shit is just obnoxious.
---
I totally agree. :)  
---
But that makes me think, since they already have the Twink NPC, and exp can be turned off on a character, then it might work to toggle 50% on a character as well. :D
---
If your a half way decent player you should be able to get to 60 in around 10 days played without any issues. That's 240 hours of play time. Two hundred. And forty. Hours. That's way more than you get from most modern video games. And then there is always the option of making multiple characters. Say you want to experience all 9 classes. And say you spend 200 hours on average getting from 1-60. That's 1800 hours. 75 days of play time before you even start the level 60 gameplay. And if you REALLY wanted to go all out you could roll on both alliance and horde. A combined 16 characters. 3200 hours or 134 days.
---
There is absolutely NO shortage of time for you to spend on exploring and experiencing the world.
---
I haven't seen the movie but the book is hot garbage.  A lot of people loved it for some reason but I feel obligated to at least try to save you hours of your life.  It has a good concept but the characters are mostly bad and the writing is middle-school creative writing class tier.  I'll probably get downvoted and you'll get a lot of recommendations saying it's good so I expect my warning will not take root but don't say you weren't notified ahead of time!
---
They look awesome.
---
Hah! That would work for mob exp huh? Not quest exp.  
---
2 Accounts. Just following me around. That would work as mobile storage. :D  
---
I like it. :)
---
Thank you!
---
The change doesn't only lie in the sellers, but also the buyers. The problem lies in _legalizing_ it. Yes, there will always be a way to buy gold, and some will get away with it. But the overwhelming majority will not risk losing their whole account, with months of playtime, just to save themselves a day or so of farming. 
---
Being able to farm gold is an important skill in classic, because gold is important. Being able to just shell out $20 for it whenever will be a massive change to both economy and, perhaps more importantly, people's playstyle. Instead of farming for what they need to play, people will keep farming to pay for gametime or even other blizzard services.
---
The "ruined economy" on private servers is mostly limited to a few items such as reagents and cloth which exist in almost unlimited supply, and can be farmed in dungeons. There's also the added problem of some private servers (again, you can choose) having a non-blizzlike population cap, leading to 3-5x more active players.
---
I’ve seen druids in the top few spots on healing meters in 40-man raids. But because of how HoTs don’t stack, there’s limited spots for them. 
---
I think Druid will definitely be worth it for you, judging from your interests. You’ll find plenty of people wanting a tank for 5-mans, and you’ll be gladly accepted as a healer for raids. Just get in good with a guild early on to be safe. That’s my opinion! Hope it helps you decide.
---
I'm planning on spending mine on a road trip so no chance for that. On the other hand, WoW got me to consider getting a part time job. A friend of mine got a gig on a local outdoor cinema and he got paid for showing up an hour early, cleaning up, operating the projector and basically do whatever he felt like for the rest of the night as long as he staid near the projector and was ready to fix any issues that might arise.
---
For the last 15-20 years video games have turned into a gigantic form of socialization, especially because real-world kid friendly locations are pretty rare these days. Parents are far more protective, malls and arcades are dead, you might live miles away from your friends if you're in the suburbs, etc. It makes day to day interaction outside of school difficult. 
---
MMOs used to be that, then it was MOBAs, now it's BR games. Each of these got less and less involved. You needed to level in MMOs to play together, sometimes be on the same faction like in WoW, commit to hours long dungeons or schedules. MOBAs were better for this, you're in a game for at most an hour at a time and you don't have to level or anything like that. 
---
Now we have BR games (and I supposed FPS games in general like Siege/CSGO) where it's easy to drop-in and drop-out as need be. Hell, if you die in a BR you don't even need to stick around, just back out and queue for a new match. Not to mention BR games are far less intense and something you can kind of do in the background while just interacting and socializing with friends.
---
Having said all that though, the biggest issue towards the success of another MMO is without a doubt money. MMOs require an absolutely massive amount of money to produce and are a huge gamble. Just think for a second about how much goes into making an MMOs compared to any other type of multiplayer game, it's staggering. So big AAA game developers don't see the investment as a worthwhile one, especially after the track record for the genre over the last decade. Meanwhile indie devs have no hope of ever creating an MMO, pixel art and chiptunes won't cut it.
---
&gt; To be blunt, I don't want to be stuck on a sub par class if the other healers in a raid aren't as good or geared. Is it worth playing druid in my case, or should I just play priest?
---
&gt; edit and I have no interest in pvp, so that's not a factor
---
You will never compete with paladin/priest/shaman healers if they are remotely competent, and especially if there is another druid in your raid that is an idiot replacing your rejuvs with his. That doesn't mean druid isn't fun to play as a raid healer though. I loved it. It's like you are THE ultimate raid support. Brez/Innervate/Bear Taunt, all clutch.
---
It's a shame you have no interest in pvp, druids are AMAZINGLY fun in world pvp, and you can take it to a next level in wsg.
---
Same here but I’ll probably end up with three tbh
---
I'd prefer corrupted blood plague again
---
This is blatantly not true. They are just not going to transfer items that went to the wrong player.
---
I think that would be a nice detour sidestep. Not everyone is an edgelord wanting the naxx gear. Not that I'd want a seperate tier 3 or anything just a few nice niche items for offspecs. Turn gear on its head.
---
Perfect guild is probably too subjective. The main scale being casual to hardcore. Personally, I think it’s a balance. Just finding 40 reliable people that swing casual is gonna be difficult, and same with the other end. I think what a good sign to look for is finding a guild that helps each other when they might not be rewarded. “I need help completing this class quest” and people jump on board to help progress their guildmate’s character. 
---
GM needs to be confident. Lots of quick decisions is a good description of GM or raid lead’s responsibilities.
---
A worth option would be to level to 60 normally and the. hit the xp stop npc. this way you can do every kalimdor and eastern kingdom quest without turning grey since they scale ;)
---
Do the same for bc/wotlk/cata/mop/wod/legion/bfa and the two expansions following bfa so you did every single quest!
---
This. Full Body Immersion.
---
Nevermind, wrong subreddit! xD
---
Making reputations and therefore non-native mounts easier to get would devalue them. The system is badly designed, totally, but that's what it is.
---
good bot!
---
Those look really authentic, impressive.
---
I’d say depends if you’re in a guild at that point with other players at that level. If you’re having to really search to fill end game 5-mans I would wait to respec, if you’re in with a group that is running them constantly, go ahead and drop that gold.
---
totally agree! I just made a post about this with a link to my guild goals and mentality. Being selfless will be a very re occurring theme, but not to the point where a player is hindering the guild.
---
My favorite loot system has always been DKP, where points are never taken away from people and bidding is done privately. I don't see a GL as a main leader, but more as an organizer so my biggest thing come classic will to be fair and kind, I think everyone has had dick raid leaders before and it's just not necessary.
---
Engineering is big, for the sole reason of feign death/jumper cables. Your guild will find you an asset to bring for raids if you can provide, albeit a non reliable, but possible wipe prevention.
---
I'm probably the only one who does this but whenever I level, I freeze XP every 10 levels (usually I'll stop on the 9's since going every 10 is a wee bit too much) until I finish all the quests in a particular level range. It works great; I just wish you didn't have to go to the cities to do this.
---
I think it's a good thing. It puts some form of pressure on Blizzard to not disappoint and hold their horses on the marketing BS that could push people on the fence. And at the same time it provides a solid backup plan for vanilla-addicts in case Blizzard do fuck it up one way or another. So in any case it's a win-win for us, the players.
---
You say "Blizz-equal" but I'd say private servers, once they have the chance to "steal" all the exact values, have the potentiel to be more authentic due to the real and clunky 1.12 client emulation, compared to official Classic with a backported modern client that feels and responds very differently.
---
I'm going to roll a horde hunter. What professions should I level with? I know at 60 I want engineering but I'm not sure if I should start with that or what.
---
Upgrading your spriest’s dps is the worst use of items only after upgrading your other hybrid dps classes. 
---
No serious guild would let that happen. Attempt to justify why you deserve all the loot in the game first and see how it works out for you in practice.
---
I agree, I found this took form in a lot of horde players making their #1 alt a mage for traveling purposes.
---
i hear alot of good things about dkp but im worried it could cause a problem if people collude to whisper bids to each other?
---
Definitely check this channel out , the guy has great content
---
Dangerous thinking to be optimistic about making a decision to listen to part of your base?  If you want to foster a good culture between company and people, surely you'd want to praise the goods as much as you rally against the bads, right?
---
ive used dkp in guilds in the past and it felt like if you didnt donate every week for an increase in dkp you would rarley get an item over other who donated every week
---
Flask of petrification.
---
I'd prefer to play Cyberpunk but CDPR still won't tell us when it's coming out!
---
Two weeks a year is a pretty typical of a lot of US companies. I got 3 weeks/year when I hit my 7th year at the company I'm with.
---
Both are good, if you plan to raid as shadow id pick UD because of the extra dot. Troll has a -20% healing curse without cd.
---
So it comes down to Wotf vs healing curse, pick your choice
---
Lol
---
I know, there's a lot to do. And i've been playing this game since forever. I can't get enough of it.
---
So being able to buy the mounts from the different factions faster in rep, but slower in level is the advantage? Hahaha I guess it's a nice trade-off. You spent your days travelling and making connections with the factions of the world, so they let you ride a Ram, or a Tiger. :)
---
Your privilege is leaking.
---
Hahahaha When they added achievements in the game, i got Loremaster because i had done pretty much all the quests in the game. XD
---
Just don't dude... Just because you had a shitty experience on pservers doesn't mean everyone did. And nobody cares what you thought or that you'd rather play a p2w game.
---
Fuses wiring is baller but I feel like it will actually get you gold once a raid scene has established.
---
So you'd like, hold on to then for a while.
---
Unionization is really hard here. As soon as corporate catches wind of your efforts, the kill order comes down to fire the rabble rousers.
---
It's pretty much standard that as soon as you get hired, bosses are instructed to begin building you a folder documenting every infraction you make, regardless of how minor or how new and unfamiliar you are with the company policies. This way, they can fire you at any moment and cite reasons for doing so.
---
Lucky bc the old loremaster was "do x quests in y" which have beel like 3500 combined or so if i rememver correctly.
---
Just don't log out in inns, and the rested xp should be close to non-existent.
---
I could totally do this if they add the freeze exp npc in the game. I think this is the best idea so far. :)  
---
Because you would still get the reputation from the quests, but not the Exp. Win win.
---
Freeze XP at level 10 (Because of Hunter Pet Quest) then every so often when i want to continue progress.
---
It can be done. You just have to deliberately plan out your questing plan from zone to zone and minimize the killing of non-gray, non-quest mobs along the way. I’ve been working on an Alliance Quest Completionist Guide for several months now that achieves the goal of maximizing reputation while minimizing experience. It’s currently complete through level 35.
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
atleast late game dual weilding you can create more rage with enough crit, and every main hand swing should be a heroic strike with the right gear
---
Well the way I see it, Some gear will drop and the people who want it can bid accordingly without pressure from others on the spot. I mean players could bribe each other on how much to bid I guess, if they really tried, but if Carl and John discuss it, they still don't know if/what/how much all individuals will bid. I mean they could keep a private record of everyone's DKP but then again it wouldn't be required to use all your points to win a piece of gear.
---
My understanding is that they need the 4 pc set bonus from teir 3 as well in order to increase the hit chance of taunt to ensure the fight goes smoothly. A resisted taunt or two could wipe the raid.
---
Thank you for all the help! I was set on Mage again two months ago but you might just have convinced me to roll Priest instead! :D
---
Nope.  Gnome gets 5% intellect bonus so its near negligible
---
Well, i would take twice as long to reach the same level to use the mounts. So won't devalue that much.
---
We won’t burn your house down, we will just grumble from our server telling you that 10k concurrent isn’t blizz like in the slightest.
---
r/theyknew
---
I feel more for some sort of mentoring system that EQ2 has. Downgrade your char to a certain level to do quests suited for it. Mentoring friends to play together and even give them a small xp boost.
---
A while back I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5gr6a/60k_subs/ejde82h/?context=3) and am still interested in a more formal look at this trend.  I wonder what a huge analysis of this might look like taking in to account dozens of other games.
---
/u/awesometographer where you at fam?
---
You're amazing. I'll def use these for my personal guide. Thank you. :)
---
Why not both? I love my Rift and classic WoW, so job permitting, I'll be spending a good amount of time with each.
---
You guys really are impatient huh
---
What is the maximum amount of characters in a guild name in Vanilla?
---
lmao why are these words blocked?
---
I am also in favor of TBC ASAP for a different reason.  Even though nochanges seems to have "won" on class balance raid tuning issue, TBC fans are still going to be pushing for changes until they get their expansion to play instead.  Opening up TBC Classic would draw some people away from Vanilla Classic, but those are the people who are trying to turn Vanilla into TBC anyway so no big loss.
---
I feel like this is a great idea on an established server, or where people have been 60 for a little while. Because it requires you selling the items on the AH for a decent price, which might not be the case for a while at the start of classic. People aren't going to have the gold to spend 
---
Good idea, but I wouldn't bank on this getting you 100g+ on the F R E S H at the beginning.
---
God damn. I've been excited to jump into classic because I figured it would be a nice change in attitude and demeanor from the player base as, I would assume, the players would be in my demographic - played vanilla or tbc through school and are now older and wiser, and want to enjoy a game together. People like you make me so sad.
---
You almost go out of your way to misrepresent not only the whole post, but the person you responded to. Clearly the word 'worse' in both the response and the original post are referring to damage, dps, and performance. The original post literally mentions hit chance as being the detrimental factor in choosing the one handers.
---
I used to think that the toxicity that I remembered when we were children was because we were children, but as I've grown up, I see others still haven't.
---
So what's the reason behind fast offhand for combat rogue? I know from TBC on you had combat potency but since that isn't in vanilla I'm not sure what the speed helps? Is it just for more poison procs? Are those not normalized to a proc per minute like most enchants?
---
Yup. Putting in a week of PTO when it launches
---
Seems less volatile than loot council to me, because that's asking people to be okay with all the choices you have to make constantly. Where some kind of modified smart DKP has more of something to learn on in my mind.
---
To be fair this is classic wow, the blizzard product not r/wowservers, one of the most toxic wow private servers subreddit. 
---
That said, token gold injected into vanilla wow ruins the economy and the larger game.
---
I don’t know what set you’re speaking about, but I’ve heard of Shadow priest tanks doing dungeons as high as ZF. Maybe give it a try.
---
Read this as Legos I made for each phase and I thought someone had made BWL and ZG out of legos. These logos are awesome! Very nice!
---
Yeah if you watch some of my other videos i almost always tell people to hold onto these types of items till 2-3  months at least. Your absolutley right theres such a low amount of physical gold in the economy that items sell for a fraction of their true value. 
---
Which also means if your smart you can scoop up some really nice items for a much lower value ;)
---
Do you mean in current WoW or Classic? Because there will always been the points in the late 30's and 40's where you end up having to grind to catch up; at least that's how it was in original (assuming they change nothing about XP gain for Classic). I was an avid altist and completionist pre-BC and there were points where I needed to grind out a level or two (and this was with the Gelkis/Magram rep grind (to revered, at least).
---
By the time token were introduced in wow it wasn’t hard to gold cap 10x characters on a single server. Gold has been meaningless in wow since at least cata.
---
Pservers will never measure up because they just don't have the same player base that an official game can garner.
---
Found the guy with a steel-reinforced F5 key.
---
my guess would be 2-3 months inbetween the updates
---
I gave 2 examples of shadow being last on loot in my post, yet you accuse me of justifying why I need 'all the loot in the game first'?
---
lets say our guild raid group 1 has 5 rouges, if before the raid all 5 rouges whisper each other: "i will be bidding X,Y,Z on item A,B,C" if they drop couldn't they come to agreements outside of raid to not bid against each other and maintain the highest DKP? 
---
Im quite un experienced with dkp you can have a set price table to each item prior to raiding right?
---
No need to judge the entire demographic by the comments of one person. Some posters here played WoW as very young kids and are now in their 20s and have a look how smart I am mentality. Another portion never actually played the original WoW but rather on private servers and carry a similar disposition.
---
Great video.  I was an airline pilot for the past few years and I just quit because I got tired of it. The people are all the same, especially the new young pilots. Copy paste resumes. You never see the same crews again so the conversations are always the same "where'd you come from?". It's the retail wow of jobs. Now I'm at a new job where you work with the same people and are actually invested in the outcome of the company. More teamwork and real relationships. Can't wait for classic.
---
pservers are susceptible to ddosing, shitty ping, bugs, broken quests. Some are over populated 4x what they were on live. 
---
Sounds dank, no wonder pservers have no fee; no one would pay it.
---
Judge does complete shit damage, only use it once as you pull. Use Rank 1 SoC and you have 0 downtime.
---
For mages and warlocks as gnomes it doesn't matter. Humans, however, get a huge dps boost from their weapon skill racial, same with orcs but only for axes.
---
Angelista's is not even close to bis, why is this garbage upvoted. If you're a warlock you have 4 better options:
---
Mana Igniting Cord
---
Sash of Whispered Secrets 
---
Firemaws Clutch
---
Nemesis Belt
---
Please don't pretend to act like you know what you're talking about.
---
This was the classic Release if anybody is curious - [https://cl.ly/8936a9933bf5](https://cl.ly/8936a9933bf5)
---
Yea if loot council was used for raid group 1 and dkp for raid group 2 or vice versa.In my mind Loot council would only work if every decision was backed by some kind of numbers or stats. With the reasoning behind the decisions so no one is left in the dark. Maybe these decisions could be made public before every raid?
---
You shouldn't be allowed to save a shitton of money on cloth just by spending a little more time levelling.
---
It’s beyond unlikely there is sharding on vanilla private servers. That’s a backend blizzard thing, that definitely started after vanilla and bc and wouldn’t have been in the emulation that is mang0s.
---
Dynamic respawns tho for sure
---
i will deffinatly be learning more about the diffrent dkp systems.
---
22 characters for a guild name
---
So they couldn't afford to do so. So the goldsink did its job lol
---
Thank you so much!
---
I hope they stick to the original classic release schedule in terms of time between new raids at least
---
Why is it obnoxious?
---
Thank you bro for real
---
&gt; 22.6 pageviews per unique visitor.

Those are rookie numbers. Gotta pump those numbers up.

Itll probably take a few hours before the necessary addons are ported to classic.

---
I win.
---
Thank you for the info. I completely understand that you're referring to efficiency and DPS, and not necessarily somebody's subjective opinion on "fun." A lot of people won't intuitively know this sort of thing (or may have straight up forgotten), so thank you for providing it. You're not telling people what's fun - you're providing information.
---
That being said, my rogue will be leveling as Subtlety, because it's more fun for me 😁
---
I'd suggest leveling with gathering professions. Mining/skinning then just vendoring all the materials for that cash money.
---
Between retail and pservers I've leveled 3 warriors to 60 -- one arms, one mostly 2h fury, and one DW fury. I actually kinda enjoyed the DW leveling (it sucks for pvp though) and it was nice to always have my 1h skill up for tanking dungeons, even if it wasn't the most effective dmg from a numerical perspective. 
---
I think the number crunchers on the warrior discord are saying arms is going to be the best leveling efficiency, but honestly I hated leveling arms so much I'd never do it again. This time around I'll likely be swapping between 2H fury and DW depending on the weapons I have available.
---
When it comes to leveling, min/maxing doesn't really matter as long as you're reasonably efficient and enjoying yourself.
---
I dont know its possible to be perfect. There's just too many clashing personalities in the world. The best GM I ever had was accountable, transparent and fair. It's really hard for infighting and mutiny to start that splits up guilds when things are clearly and truthfully conveyed to everyone. You can have private conversations with people and your officers, but everyone should be told what and why decisions are made. This includes loot, punishments, promotions etc. Behave at all times from level 1 onward like your entire guild is standing behind you. Dont say anything you wouldnt want them to see or hear, and dont do anything you'd want them to remember you negatively for.
---
Absolutely. If I made it seem like I was generalizing the community, I didn't mean for that, just specific people that seem to go out of their way to cause disruption for the sake of anti intellectualism. Unfortunately, there have been many moments in the last month or so that I've seen from a vocal (hopefully) minority that make me worried about what 'bringing back the old days' really represents.
---
You're new to me, I'll def have to check out some of your other videos. 
---
&gt; Which also means if your smart you can scoop up some really nice items for a much lower value ;)
---
Hoping I can snag a particular pair of gloves, staff, and world blues from some of the new casuals.
---
didnt play classic much, is maraudon 
---
/DM whered you’d get pre-raid bis for the raids its released with or are they just released later on for stories sake?
---
A resisted taunt won't wipe the raid, you just stay in for a little bit longer and taunt again. You'll need to get it resisted three times in a row for it to be a wipe, anything less is handle-able. 
---
Plus there are other items that can help you out, like [this one](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19947), so having 4pc set bonus is not required. It helps, but if you have 8 warriors with 4pc set bonus, the rest of the raid probably geared up to the point that I'd say your raid is overgeared for 4HM.
---
&gt;I get 31 days off a year and incredible health insurance
---
Shouldn't be dependant on employment and the quality of your company.
---
+1 this
---
Yeah I’ve found that blocking the caustic ‘know it alls’ makes for a better experience here.
---
you sound like a great person to have in a guild, your wisdom and attitude is very valuable. Thank you.
---
If they f\* up Classic, there will be no player base.
---
Yeah it's 5 weeks minimum in denmark, paid, along with all the christian holidays on top.
---
&gt; spend the remaining 50 weeks of the year slaving away 9-5.
---
If only that was the case, I don't get off until the project is done. If it takes 40 hours a week that's great, but if it takes 95 then oh well. Tough shit. I told them I'm taking 2 weeks off classic though and if they don't like it, they can find someone better.
---
Tis possible to think private servers aren't all they're cracked up to be and never have played WoW past WOTLK. In fact, that's exactly my case!
---
This guy thinks you can't buy items and gold on pservers.
---
No chance my man. We got a group of 5 of us doing it together, so fuckn keen 🥳
---
Sure, but maybe people shouldn't generalize an entire nation of people / employers?
---
woosh
---
Also implying that there are enough axes to make orc racial worthwhile
---
The most popular pservers have had ruined economies. 10k pop is a joke.
---
The more often I refresh /r/classicwow, the more likely it is that there will be a blue post. That's how it works, right?
---
Guys?
---
Finally got a chance to watch this and post some thoughts, probably no one will see this but oh well.
---
I'm a bit of a self-proclaimed EQ expert (and total WoW newb) so I was interested in this one.
---
My big disappointment is that the discussion didn't get very deep into EQ mechanics and how they both contrasted with and inspired WoW which I think is a really interesting topic. Especially in the context of how everyone nowadays claims that vanilla WoW was a "hardcore" MMO. And of course you'd have to include DAoC in this discussion since I feel that game was actually what WoW "borrowed" from the most.
---
They did mention how at first they dismissed WoW as a "casual MMO" that wouldn't be able to compete with EQ. I find this shocking since at this point EQ had released two post-McQuaid expansions (Shadows of Luclin and Planes of Power) which really began to "casualify" the game in a big way. 
---
Player to player item trading was replaced with The Bazaar. You could instantly teleport all over the world with the PoP books and Luclin spires. Instead of having to visit several racial cities and other places, now you had a giant "mega city" called the Plane of Knowledge which housed just about everything you needed. The "newbie quests" were implemented to give everyone a really nice set of gear to start with instead of having to work your way up from literal rags. Instanced dungeons were implemented, armor dyes were implemented, in-game maps were implemented... I could go on and on. All of this was at least a year before WoW released.
---
In many ways EQ had already become more "casual" at this point than WoW was at the time, so how did they come to this conclusion? Were the developers just that out of touch with what they had created?
---
Also the elephant in the room that was never mentioned: Gates of Discord. This expansion launched February 10, 2004. Players fucking hated it, and a lot of people were already not too happy with Planes of Power. The two biggest EQ celebrities were abandoning the game and telling their massive fanbase to come over with them to WoW (Alex "Furor" Afrasiabi and Jeff "Tigole Bitties" Kaplan).
---
The writing was on the wall for anyone who was paying attention. EQ was unstoppable for a solid 2-3 years, and then they tripped at the 5 yard line and fumbled the ball right into Blizzard's hands.
---
I also found it interesting that EQ2 was described as trying to be "very different." Sure it was doing some things differently, which MMO doesn't at least try some different stuff. But the feeling across the community was that it was a lame attempt at EQ trying to put out its own version of WoW. And if you feel like WoW was such a huge threat to your game that you had to whip out a Hail Mary... maybe we should just play WoW instead?
---
I also feel like they downplayed just how big of a failure EQ2 was. Like how they lost their engine and had to completely rebuild the game shortly before launch. The game was absolutely doomed.
---
I've read that between Gnomish and Goblin engineering, one of them is "for melee damage" and one of them is "for ranged damage". Which one is for which, and what is the reasoning? Are tanks in the same group as the melee damage people, and are the healers with the ranged?
---
I kinda find it hard to believe that there is such a clear cut divide, since there are so few items that are exclusive to each spec, and they don't seem to strongly pull towards melee or ranged.
---
I've seen that, and it's a great guide. But you end up have to avoid everything, or not killing anything, which is not playing. :(
---
This is sadly the truth. I played a boomkin and a ret paladin during vanilla and all the way through tbc. I didnt raid cause it didnt interest me and I know that I wasnt wanted it needed. I loved playing an offspec and I did really well in pvp. But part of why I did so well in pvp was because I was consistently underestimated. People complained about hybrids being useless and I didnt get it. I did decent pvp dps and healed my allies while using all of my utility to help win battles. Unfortunately most other hybrids weren't doing this. I saw a lot of ret paladins act like warriors and try to solo 5 people before dying. They didnt bring anything to a pvp group cause they just wanted to solo the world. I almost never saw another boomkin but when I did I dont think they understood the class enough to even be considered a threat. 
---
Hopefully classic will bring some more mature knowledgable players who can bring a decent hybrid to 5 man dungeons and pvp. All the hybrids do so well in short fights and pvp if they utilize more of their class then 5 spells from their meme spec lol.
---
I guess you could have a set price for items, and if enough people want to pay the same price they can just roll for it, I wouldn't be sure. My thinking also is whether people know what others are bidding or not doesn't really matter, because if you win you pay your points, and if you don't you keep what you were trying to bid. The only benefit to privacy is so you don't have bidding wars and people +1ing each other constantly or place their bid based on what another did.
---
Main tanking MC+. Tanking ZG/AQ20 as arms/fury isnt that bad.
---
Inflated pops
---
Cross faction collusion
---
Dynamic respawns
---
Guess those aren't significant for you
---
Because it's your fake day, I'm gonna say yes.
---
Yeah I would think giving out bonus points is a good way for players to give themselves and advantage, which works better than the threat of losing what you've already earned
---
Recently played a horde side druid on an unnamed server. Raid healed through BWL with him. Found druid to be really fun, no regrets at all. They are one of the best leveling classes and the ability to tank means you'll always have groups. During raiding you will also get geared quicker then any other class because no one else needs your gear, there will only typically be one or two other druids in the raid group and druid stuff drops ALL the time. As others have said you will never out heal a priest/sham etc. if they are good but your spells like brez and innervate make up for it and means there will always be a spot for you. So just play what you want.
---
Telling people how much they need to drink in 2019 lol.  
---
    
---
Drink when you're thirsty. Your body knows best.
---
‘Best in slot’ does not care about time.
---
I mean, this is why not everyone should be entitled to an opinion.
---
thanks so much for all the input. DKP sounds like the way to go if you can get a fair and transparent system. Will defiantly be asking the guild members what they think.
---
An excellent question u/Horsecunilingus
---
Yeah, just saying these points doesn't bring anything new to the table. But I really like that he tackles issues that many people seem to ignore, just saying "it's shit, no communities, no reason to invest your time" while not saying why it is. Because I believe that through Classic we may also get the next expansion of WoW retail that is actually worth playing.
---
Ah, true. Impacts the Cloth Market, which in turn impacts Tailors and First Aid.
---
8/11/31 is what I plan on lvling and raiding in. Not sure if I'll be a burden to my guild as I'll be 2nd in command so I can do whatever I want.
---
While progressing through the game, dps warriors (and there will be plenty) have ample opportunity to pick up T2 which is one of the best defensive sets in the game for the effort required. 4 Horsemen doesn't require mastery of tanking, just a taunt and a meat shield, especially if you are tanking the back 2 horsemen which don't get attacked for the first few minutes.
---
I think that's an interesting idea, my only beef with loot council really is the good players will say "I did amazing I deserve it" so one has to be careful to remember to gear the under average players as well, to help MAKE them average and give incentive imo
---
It's not that its needed it's just that warrior, rogue, and mage are the most played class will take up a good 20% or more of a server population. You wont necessarily need a full optimized raid to clear MC. It's just that they will be there looking for a guild and ready to fill the slots. When people are looking for guild mates especially early on when guilds a forming their will be 5 mages to every druid and 10 warriors or rogues for every paladin or shaman. So raid leaders will have plenty of viable options. It will be easy to pass on hybrid specs
---
Started in BC but looking forward to giving Classic a try. I play only tanks on retail but warrior has always been my least favorite tank. Are Pallys/Druids viable at all for tanks in Classic?
---
In PVE there are only 3 race combos where you will feel an impact. Not to the point that you shouldn't choose anything else of course, but you will feel the difference during your journey.
---
1. Dwarf Priest, the most famous example. This isn't about 3-5% more performance,  it -can- actually make the difference between being invited or denied to a pug raid. You will feel that you have something that others don't, just based on your race choice.
---
2. Human and Orc paired with a melee class. The dps increase from weapon mastery may not make or break you (like 5% more?), but it affects your weapon choice (in the case of Warrior, at least). You will feel that your race affects you apart from just + dps, because now weapon availability also plays a role.
---
Every other combination won't affect you much in PVE, PVP is a different story.
---
In your case you would lose 2 dps and about 2-3 Frostbolt casts worth of mana as a human. The math has been done with average gear. So have fun with your Human!
---
I guess it's more of a problem in the levels 1 - 30. After that there's less quests possible than levels to be gained. :)
---
Sounds like secondlife. VR chat is essentially secondlife without the building aspect.
---
I was on Stormreaver-US (Alliance) back then.
---
Taking the Lords name in vein.  Learn some self control and respect for others.  #Blessed
---
Bonereaver's Edge is still the most impactful change, to the point where PvP'ers who were unsure about what class to roll are rolling warriors.
---
yea my first response would be to look at boths players logs and gear, and if player 1 did amazing then was it because he out preformed or was he already outgeared. players 2 logs were competitive for his gear in comparison and its a much bigger upgrade for player 2. item would go to player 2 if he shows the same attendance and dedication as player 1.
---
I actually quit before I could down Cthun, I just a baby, and Im not even sure who almondbutter is tbh lol
---
Thanks for the in-depth explanation :)
---
It's againt subreddit rules to "share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour".
---
The real fun part is that one of the remaining pservers has the name of a settlement in the Eastern Plaguelands, which as of two weeks ago still triggered the automod.
---
OOC did you play other MMOs before? I'm curious if people's view of vanilla leveling speed is colored by their first MMO experience, be it one that was faster or slower than vanilla.
---
its so hard in a 40 man enviroment lol.
---
For sure man, I just like having a system where all members feel like they have control, or at least some control over that piece of gear they really want &amp; they are rewarded for things other than flat raid dps. My goal is to reduce drama and help people feel appreciated, so they can get what they want and in doing that I get what I want.
---
People ran benchmarks and found the legion client with vanilla graphics runs better than 1.12 client even on a potato. Yes you can play classic on your grandmas dialup PC.
---
I'm not sure if you should try to find 2 raid groups as your first time GMin
---
Maximum raid dps... boring
---
Exactly
---
love or some crap
---
It's definitely more than that. Look at the rankings. Of top 20 warriors dps in Naxx on LB we have one night elf, one tauren, one dwarf, 5 orcs and 11 humans.
---
Top 20 warriors on ND we have one dwarf, 10 orcs and 9 humans.
---
Same server but only AQ shows two dwarves, one gnome, 6 orcs and 11 humans.
---
The top 5-6 positions are mostly RNG based, but the fact that 90% of the top warriors are either orc or human really shows how powerful those racials are.
---
This is juicy
---
I kind of like Stranglethorn Vale.  Lots of little spots, plus Booty Bay itself.  And the fishing contests, of course.
---
Holy shit I didn't even know about this one. There's another +hit belt off the bat miniboss in scholo also. There are honesty a ton of ramifications to this change it's gonna be a massive headache.
---
Ahh great, so all 5 man content should be fine? How about UBRS?
---
Not for raids. Maybe as an OT Druid but definitely not a pally
---
You should stop caring so much about what others think is "the gold standard". There have been and still exist plenty of private servers that aren't 10k pop.
---
As someone who has never played and is planning on playing when it releases.   What is the difference between a raid, dungeon, bg, and world?
---
It's bigger now
---
Glad to help. You can always roll a mage after priest :)
---
I have not used it personally, but knowing the mechanics I would think it would not be that useful. It is a long channeled spell, so any attack will cause pushback, reducing the damage of the spell or stop it casting. The counter to this would be to use power word shield, however this costs considerable mana.
---
In the end, I think you'd be leveling the same way other priests do. Mind Blast, SWP, wand til dead.
---
There are some niche builds for Starshards as a dps spell at 60, but they aren't realistic except in a very casual setting.
---
can you speculate please?
---
Absolutely fucking not. Play what looks good to you.
---
ME NOT THAT KIND OF ORC!
---
For dungeons sure. For OT somewhat/mostly. For MT for most fights NO.   
---
Pallys lack a taunt and the gearing isn't there.
---
Druids get crushed too much and bleed your healer's mana too quickly. 
---
They can work for some fights, and often make fine OTs but warrior is king of classic tanking.
---
Sweet! Good to hear!
---
how a bout you go fook off my page you numbnut
---
I've wondered this for so long. Glad to know it was wasn't true and that with the right RNG/Skill it could have been done.
---
Spell hit is worth 10-15 spell damage depending on how much hit you have. If you're a warlock this belt is  about on par with mana igniting chord. If you've ever raided on a vanilla server in 2019 you'd know this item is heavily contested and you could go 8+months running MC every lockout and never receive this item. That means literally every caster will be using this belt for an extended period of time. When an item becomes this widespread it no longer becomes optional. The player perspective of the item changes. Now if you see a caster who doesn't have this easily acquired but incredibly powerful belt you look at them and say you're a noob. That's not what vanilla is about. This Change effectively makes this belt mandatory if you want to join a half decent raid guild.
---
dont play rogues cause i dont like the playstyle so dont take this as fact but i asked a rogue in game one time (recently on server) and he said its for more poisen procs not sure it its normalized
---
Thank you very much. I greatly appreciate the response.
---
The ceiling for the player base population is higher in the official releases (total pop across all servers)..this is all I meant. The inability to match this part of the original Vanilla experience is where private servers will never measure up. The community just isn't as big on em, which IMO holds it back significantly.
---
Oh man, the feels! Great work :D
---
Damn these are great. Maybe mods can put these in the banner at each phase?
---
Thanks! After reading other replies I hit on almost exactly what you set out in your guide. It is good to have confirmation that I will not be hurting myself too much by going holy while levelling.
---
I always carry a paladin in my bags for this kind of situation.
---
And which server of those has been more accurate than Nost and its predecessors outside of pops?
---
i tanked ubrs as arms. hell i did dm w at lvl 58 as arms
---
Blizzard is going to increase the subscription cost for World of Warcraft to 20 dollars a month 3 months after WoW: Classic's release. Mark my words!
---
I hope they stick around phase 2 and 3 for as long as possible. Once AQ and Naxx comes out, even BWL a bit, PvP becomes so bursty that it just isn't fun. It's just a game of who gets the opener.
---
You're a moron. You could always buy gold from gold farmers even in 2005, the difference is when it's not 'shady' or against TOS, a LOT more people do it. 
---
Every game is in some way P2W if you include under the table practices. Boosting in MOBA's for example. The difference is the threat of being punished/hacked whatever, because while that has a low chance of happening, it's enough of a deterrent a lot of the time, because most people deep down know that they will have more fun  if they earn the Gold themselves. Even people who will buy it, will do so far less often (and at a greater price) than they would if Blizzard supplied that.
---
It kind of depends. Fire mage really felt like fucking fire mage, it just didn't feel like "just a mage" anymore. Shadow priest flavor was asesome, though I didn't feel like a regulqr priest at all anymore (which is super cool and kind of lame at the same time)
---
That literally shows nothing. A 3% increase over someone might be all they need to be in the “top 20.” All that data truly shows is simply how popular they are as race choices.
---
Well if you have time for 2 raid groups of 40 you should invest that time into making sure your first raid group is successful and establish your guild as a good one
---
My recommendation for new guilds is loot Council for everything that matters for progression and dkp for everything else, the most important thing is to make sure the guildies know this
---
Never not too soon
---
Gnomish has the battle chicken, which increases melee attack speed.
---
Man that is hardcore as hell. Dude played 18 hours a day for a month, lost his progress due to a bug **and kept going**. I was hell bent on raiding and logged 127 days on my DK before Ruby Sanctum was released....but this. This is like crazy.
---
Quick question will phase 1 and 2 be without battlegrounds? Ty
---
Yes, but you're wrong, so??????
---
So you're saying the key is to never stand up. Noted.
---
I dunno honestly, I have close to zero raiding experience, and my research is limited. From what I understand, daggers are viable, but possibly require more work on your part to keep up with sword users. I'm gonna go for it and not worry too much about min/maxing.
---
&gt; total pop across all servers
---
The total population doesn't matter if your server is a wateland.
---
get them goblin xls baby!
---
There's a couple countries that simply put people who disagree into prisons and camps, so if you'd like more information on your perfect dystopia let me know.
---
Hybrids will always underperform in raids. They aren't meant to beat pure dps ever. They bring so much extra utility that isnt going to be used. In a fixed variable fight like a raid boss you cant use a druids mobility or a shaman/paladins ability to quickly switch from dps to heals and cc. We all know what a boss is going to do and about how many healers and tanks we will need to bring.
---
But in pvp the variables are much more complicated and unknown. The hybrids shine in wpvp and battlegrounds when you can force fights over objectives. Being able to switch from dps to heals and then cc is so valuable in a fight. The hybrids are incredible support classes. In a raid it would be better to just bring two warriors to dps but in pvp a warrior and any paladin will beat any two warriors in a fight. 
---
I know it sucks but the hybrids will never be top players in raids. If you play a hybrid you should expect to heal and buff. Obviously you can find a nice guild and casual raid through bwl but you wont me competitive. But you can play any "meme" spec in pvp and crush people. Just recognize what you are good at and for and fill your role
---
How long does it usually take you and how often do you play while leveling?
---
I’m really wondering what’s going to happen after Naxx / how long each phase will last. I’m actually extremely excited how much they’re spacing it out, I hope it isn’t rushed. It’s going to be amazing to level slowly again, by slowly I mean it’ll probably take me 3 to hit 60, but still to really enjoy the entire leveling process is going to be the best.
---
Ahh, got it. Just connected the dots. You're not intentionally going out of your way to misrepresent the arguments, you're only reading the first lines of text and formulating a narrative.
---
Title of thread was "don't dual weild" and in the body it explained rational analysis as to why - but you only took the first part into consideration and perceived it as an attack of free playstyle.
---
First person you responded to started his post with "its not an opinion" and then continued to explain that it is objectively worse, however you didn't get beyond his hyphen and responded with a disengunious response.
---
Because of those examples, your response to the next post insinuating that it was "worse" was because you lacked context for the post because you're being abtuse and near sighted.
---
So it would of course be par for the course to only acknowledge the first two words of my post. Take this response as you will, respond or don't, read the first sentence or it all, I think my point is proven already.
---
Have a blessed day.
---
You can farm BiS gear at 58 if you reroll prot and run Strat, Scholo, LBRS. Can run BRD at 54 specced Arms. And do a couple ST runs at 52 for your drake rings.
---
Looks like you were struck by the streamer fanboys. rip
---
You must not understand how different the experience is then. Whatever you think the issues with Pservers are, I guarantee you that the game post-WoTLK isn't even close to replicating the old-school WoW experience and Pservers are way more effective at scratching that itch.
---
I love these. I can’t wait for phase 1 ^.^
---
Yeah biggest problem with boomkin is starfire doesn't do enough damage. It's a long cast with low damage, and they have a core flaw in their dps rotation in the form of nature's grace. Because of travel time you need to crit twice in a row to benefit from the cast reduction. And we won't even talk about having to get some wonky AF gear just to curve the insane mana issues
---
Was it in Vanilla? No? There you have it. Doesn't matter if it's good or bad.
---
The purpose of Classic is to bring back Vanilla, not some "improved" version of it.
---
It does if we're talking about the size of the community at large. Part of the beauty of WoW is the massive community outside of the game. This comes from a large amount of people playing the same version of the game.
---
What do i spend gold on if im not saving up for the lvl40 mount?
---
now i just find myself buying blue upgrades on AH with my paladin because i know i will get my mount anyway :D
---
Well, that certainly pushes the melee towards Gnomish.
---
Got any idea why Goblin would be for ranged?
---
Does anyone know if its worth it to AoE grind for XP in a 4 man group? The group would consist of a warrior, mage, shaman, and priest. I do not plan to only AoE grind but if anyone knows if the XP per hour is better off questing I would rather not waste my time just grinding mobs. Question is for low, mid, and high level ranges. Thank you.
---
Guess there is no need to craft arcanite reaper.
---
You save it, money saved is money earned!
---
Not sure what your point is.  Are you trying to say GMs selling items and gold to players to keep their server running is not shady?  Or that it's ok because vanilla had gold sellers?  Maybe you think tokens will make people suddenly have more disposable income and seek to ruin yours gameplay is some way.  Doesn't matter I guess.  Doesn't make pservers any less of a massive steaming pile of shit.
---
They said they will release phase 2 "when the players are ready for it". So I think they will just keep a track of the feedback a few months after release of a phase and launch the next phase if a majority wants it.
---
I defiantly agree.  I'm not sure if you saw my guild outline I linked but raid **group 2** is TBD and will start between **phases 2** and **3**; by that time I expect **raid group 1** to be fine tuned. 
---
Between phases 2 and 3 everyone should have 2 characters level 60. **Group 2** will be for new members and gear up mains to establish raid **group 1**. 
---
Raid 1 can fill both raid slots until group 2 is created.
---
https://youtu.be/CGQ8w46JOL4
---
Both systems are very vague in their naming. DKP can have caps, bids or set prices, prios, rankings etc. Loot council can also have many variations. 
---
My preferred way of handling loot is this:
---
An item drops, it's posted in /rw, those who want it post what they would replace in /raid. The class officers dicuss in o-chat who should get the item, maybe let one from each class roll. Like if a spellcaster item drops, let one warlock and one mage roll for it. I also like the idea of having class DKP, taking the warlock/mage items as an example, spread them out between the classes so one team aren't completely loot-less for months. 
---
Loot council takes a lot of work from the class leaders, as a CL myself I love doing it, but not everyone is so keen on spending extra hours after the raid noting everything down. 
---
DKP is subject to loot whoring which is terrible. There should be a system to combat it, not sure how.
---
I'm wrong about a hypothetical migration to pservers that never happened?  How can I be more right?

There is not going to be any "PvP system". You can kill each others, but there's no honorable kills or anything like that.

Too much 4chan surfing for me. Some of his points are pretty spot on, but after four pepe the frog cut ins, the brainlet faces, and calling people beta cucks it made me groan a bit. Also, his style of videos isn't my thing. Insulting things you don't like and calling them the worst game on the market is just immature.
---
You invented an argument and made up a long story supporting it that I didn't bother reading.
---
Don't dual wield or you're somehow having fun inefficiently or wrong is a joke and can't be taken seriously.
---
2-3 months a phase? Sounds a bit short to me... 
---
So we have 6 phases now. With 2-3 moths phase 6 (Nax) will be rolled out after 10 to 15 months. I think (hope) it'll be rather 3-4 months.
---
have fun. attaining r10. attaining benediction.
---
I've looked all over the different 'top 100 servers' websites, after the sponsored servers the top ten have two to three fun servers, one blizz like server, and the rest are instant max level garbage..
---
 The most populated ones were always the ones with a place you teleport to and buy a full set of gear, then group up and go kill these super high health do nothing mobs that drop godly gear.. Only to repeat that process three times then pvp 
---
I'm not saying this to condemn private servers or whatever, I was looking for a fun experience for myself
---
Sounds like you haven't looked at actual numbers and are considering your interests the most popular
---
I'll play a version of Classic with tokens where at least I don't have to fear my character being deleted due to server admins falling out or getting a cease and desist letter and the entire server being taken offline.
---
&gt;Orc paired with a melee class
---
Not true for rogues since they can't wield axes.
---
Bloodfury is still nice though.
---
Leveled 3 warriors in my vanilla/pserver life.
---
Yes 2h is better as is the arms tree for leveling 90% of the time. However, there are certain points where dual wield can be stronger, such as getting the Stalvan blue 1h while the quest is still red, or thrash blade + another blue at level ~44. 
---
The playstyle of melee kiting with slowish 2her is the way to go, and a good 2her is 75% of your leveling power. All that said, sometimes it's more fun to dial wield, and at 60 Fury of course comes out ahead with good gear.
---
I like fishing deviate fish just ouside of the enterance to Wailing Caverns.
---
The argument was not one person implied the thread had anything to do with fun, but analytic evidence. I kept my word count low this time, if you need, I'll bring out the crayons or use emojis to help.
---
Because they are trying to follow the release order of vanilla. The honor system was added two months before battlegrounds. They are bunching some stuff together, like BWL and battlegrounds, despite being separate patches by about a month in vanilla, because they don't affect each other too much. But if you added honor and battlegrounds at the same time you would completely remove an entire phase of the vanilla PvP scene (the "golden days" of world PvP).
---
I like your ideas a lot about the Loot council, but at the same time i would like transparency. I like the idea of my officers or loot council to feel comfortable speaking their reasoning publicly. I wouldn't want anyone kept in the dark i like involving more than one class to keep up the competition and fairness. maybe post the officer chats at the end of the night.
---
I see a lot of issues and benefits with DKP. DKP would have to use a set loot specific values. Im not sure of other ways to combat the loot hording.
---
will save your comment for future
---
This got me hyped. Nice job!
---
Valid point, but try and go beyond top 20 and it'll still be lots and lots of orcs and humans. They are objectively better at damage and thus tanking as well. That's just a fact, and the difference is large enough that some items become human or non-human prio, not sure if it's the same with orcs though. It's not a 5% int buff that gnomes get over humans. That still pulls some people towards gnomes, if we look at the rankings as above there will be like 60% gnomes and 40% human. Very few horde warlocks seem to be able to push dps for some reason. I'm guessing maybe the lack of salvation hurts them too much.
---
There are some arguments about whether the private servers overvalue weapon skill. So potentially the dps boost will be lower on Classic, which I really hope. I hate racials that are too powerful.
---
Wow when I joined this sub there were only 8k subs
---
Like the Rank 8 stuff etc?  Maybe.  The biggest problem with fury is that your uptime on targets is so low that when you do get on top of someone you need to be able to global them.  You can't do that as fury so unless they are so undergeared you can still kill them quick....you just won't be able to pull off the kill.  If you are obssessed with the dual wielding thing just play rogue.
---
I agree with you except for phase 2. Even a few weeks of phase 2 will be long enough :D
---
Cant speak with certainty but in BC and Wrath, when rogues used deadly poison on offhand, a faster offhand stacked deadly to 5 more quickly.  Slower offhand also had a risk of not reapplying a stack of deadly before your stacks expired.  So I guess that means it wasn't normalized back then.
---
Well, easy and hard are both subjective, right? Gold isnt completely useless or people wouldn't still buy tokens. I think tokens were actually one of the best things blizzard ever did. It cut down on Chinese gold farmers and gave players a safe outlet to buy gold (which they were going to do anyway) while rewarding dedicated players who didn't need gold free game time.
---
Up the ante : level with your own 40 man raid ! :D
---
You know well enough that we aren't allowed to mention private servers by name on here except for nost, but nice try rulebaiting.
---
Nope. I'm not gonna set myself up for disappointment when the servers are all swamped and nothing is available to kill.
---
Oh yeah, greater diversity makes for much harder balancing. But Blizzard has never actually made an attempt to  balance different pets anyway, except by just removing everything that made them unique. Instead of balancing different pets, they just killed off all the most interesting stuff, so now Brokentooth is optimal for pretty much everything.
---
Previously, sure Brokentooth technically had the best damage output, but Lupos did Shadow damage instead of physical, and that one Buzzard pet can do Fire damage, and there are those super fast wolves from AV that can chase down mounted enemies in PvP. These made it so that different pets were better for different things, which I much preferred. Personally, I'd have loved it if the strongest DPS pet had a terrible run speed that was actually slower than a normal player, because that creates legitimate trade-offs.
---
But yeah. Pet Normalisation really kinda killed my interest in Hunters as a whole. I'm not into minmaxing, I just like the class fantasy of searching out rare and exotic beasts with unusual abilities, and breaking them to my will. That sounds like a super archetypal Hunter to me. Plus the idea of pets losing fundamental qualities (like run speed, size, damage type) always felt super game-y and unrealistic to me.
---
There is one thing, that i never saw mentioned with long quest chain summoned bosses, like Thunderaan:
---
what happens if the raid wipes? you have to gather materials again, or just go back and retry the summon.
---
Same question goes for all bosses for long chains, that are summoned anywhere.
---
Thanks.
---
Exalted with gnomeregan is what you need.
---
Yeah nah i just bought a 49” lg 4k tv for like 300 bucks at best buy, its 120hz and does the job nicely. The ultrawides seem like a racket.
---
You must be new here
---
Same my friend.
---
I'm leveling feral right now and it seems incredibly strong. Could someone break down the min/max potential of feral raid dps because? I'm sure they dont scale as well because their weapon does doesnt matter, but I can do 60% of mobs HP in one ravage crit at 40, and their talents seems pretty good for PvE.
---
You must like being a dick to people just asking for information.
---
WoW Tokens were not part of vanilla
---
/thread
---
There was an issue that was up on twitter involving blizzard staff about warlock pet summoning. There is a specific you can easily google.
---
I'd actually take rosewine over Fordrings for PvE (speaking as someone with experience as priest and shaman). 5mp5 is way more valuable than 7 +healing and some stam imo.
---
&gt;  I just want to hear some explanations for this line of thought other than "Retail bad, Classic good" or *"No Changes"*
---
Not really ilvl. But there was some sort of "budget" for stats. It's very wonky though, +crit, +hit and +spell damage was very undervalued for example, so any item with lots of those was usually very good. Then they also made a lot of changes to items throughout vanilla, so when they got updated I don't think they necessarily followed the loose "budget" that had been mostly adhered to before in the same type of content.
---
I mean, let's just assume the character you create in Vanilla is the same character who goes through the dark portal with Khadgar and friends in WoD. 
---
At this point you have killed so many murlocs, gnolls, gators, orcs/humans, goblins, and monsters that you are probably famous around the entire world (of warcraft) for being a death machine. Not to mention playing a part in the fall of Rag, taming kael thas, illidan, Lich King, killing deathwing, killing onyxia, leading an assault on Orgrimmar/Garrosh. You're not just slack jawed dirt farmer from Westfall, you -are- a hero unless you've leveled up entirely by picking flowers and mining ore. If we were leading into BFA and the NPCs were still saying things like "aaah &lt;character name&gt;, before I can trust you to help with important task, I need you to prove yourself loyal to &lt;FACTION&gt; and gather 15 bear flank. Return to me when you have completed this and maybe I'll let you help us." then people would be shitting on WoW saying "MOTHER FUCKER I KILLED ARTHAS! I SHOULD BE LORD COMMANDER OF THE ALLIANCE!" 
---
Don't get me wrong. I prefer vanilla and being a character slowly building themselves up. I don't really want to be the chosen one. But it makes sense that eventually after being such an important player in major events that your character would get a title. And before people come in and ACKSHUALLY me by saying an NPC got the final blow or whatever, the player character is at least present during every major event since Vanilla so even if you yourself didn't deal the final blow, you have been at every major battle and have survived each one and killed countless mobs and peons at the very least, so you're obviously leadership material.
---
I haven't heard or seen anything about using eng for max dps. I assume it's just using bombs on aoe pulls? I wouldn't be hitting max dps of what I could be as it is cause I'm playing undead rogue.
---
Whipvine Cord is BiS for priest until Firemaw's clutch (extremely minor upgrade PvE wise) and then C'thun belt.
---
Padre's trousers are also pretty freaking insane.
---
Exactly what makes the video so good. He wen't the extra step to help describe his feelings to the viewer and let them understand why he felt an instant connection to the "vanilla" era when he tried out the beta back in November.
---
To go one step further on that discussion, with my past experience of Private server population exodus always to the newest " F R E S H" server combined with actual elements of a highly social and rewarding MMO, I have zero fear of an initial population drop due to "tourism".
---
I really do believe the combination of social pressure of people flocking to Classic en masse in tandem with its highly rewarding and social structure of the game that people will be as horribly addicted to playing it as they did in 2004/5.
---
Classic is going to be the WoW killer.
---
This is definitely the attitude behind the reasoning, it's pretty simple.  People are really concerned about any changes, so anything that represents a change is immediately a threat.  Whether that's rational or not isn't really of interest, unfortunately.
---
Lol, rule baiting. That's your argument? I already mentioned a few of them.
---
I'm a min/maxer dude what are taking about my playstyle?  Keep making personal attacks instead of points and keep expecting to get nowhere.
---
Ok, thank you for the info :)
---
That's the only explanation there needs to be.
---
We're not asking for Vanilla 2.0, we want vanilla as it was, with all of it's flaws and imperfections.
---
Makes sense. I didn’t start PVPing until pretty late in vanilla so I was oblivious to the content order on that front
---
I can see you want to go hard, but be mindful that as a new GM most hardcore players will already be playing together or joining experienced guilds, since we don't know when phase 2 or 3 hits and how long they last I would put a 2nd raid group on hold until it makes sense
---
My guild is using Suicide Kings, Which is basically a simple Loot Ladder.  If you’re top in the ladder, and you want the item, and it’s for your class, you get it.  Then you go to the bottom of the ladder.  It’s fast, fair, and transparent.
---
I know, but I mainly see people concerned about changes that can fundamentally shake the foundation of gameplay. Loot trading obviously brought with it fears of PuGs basically locking in gear for each other during dungeon runs, and sharding ruining the lively world that was eventually phased out for a dead almost single-player experience where you MAY encounter someone else questing if you're really really lucky. 
---
WoW tokens, on the other hand, don't fundamentally shake the flow of gameplay to me as gold sellers have always been a thing (and profitable enough to be running for literal decades) so this really doesn't shake anything, even if it does give players more gold to work with. A gold buyer is going to buy gold regardless of whether or not he's allowed to.
---
[The Modern Gamer](https://i.imgur.com/2W8VP7J.jpg)
---
You dont need to bother respeccing healing spec until 40-man raids like Ony/MC. 5 man dungeons and pre-bis farming can be done in off spec easily.
---
Well, last night as I laid in bed I was thinking. Would it be better to just stockpile herbs/skinn, or, etc and wait for players to hit max level and actually have gold to spend and then sell it.
---
Nothing too crazy. 2  natural days off, 5 paid vacation days off, then 2 more natural days off, then return to work. Time to enjoy the game and not have to worry about work for a bit and relax. I'm not interested in hitting max ASAP and I don't like to take vacations where I travel so I usually use my vacation days as pto as sick or "mental health" days. It wont interfere too much with my normal handling of PTO and I'll get time to feel like a teenager again during summer.
---
I'll be honest I tanked as mostly fury (15/31/5? on mobile atm) till the second half of BWL.
---
Depends what server you’re rolling on. If you role on a server with a big pserver population like the classicast server or a server with a major pserver guild rolling on it boes are likely all going to be bought up pretty quick and items probably aren’t going to be selling for much of a discount early on.
---
someone plays and pays for Path of Exile
---
Ok?
---
You should add data for the amount of pointless memes being posted and how much actual intellectual conversation had decreased
---
Hopefully there isn't default Blizzard chat rules. Talk twice in a row and you can't talk for 30 seconds..
---
Will look into it. What dictates who starts at the top or bottom? Can you surpass people based off performance/dedication?
---
People who want to buy gold are going to buy gold whether it's allowed in the ToS or not, so I still don't see WoW tokens as a "p2w" experience since people who want to do it will do it anyway and it's not like gold is added to the game.
---
While i agree with you on BC and Wrath in Vanilla there was a debuff limit on bosses of 8 until ZG it became 16 so rouges run double instant since the debuff slots are better used on other options.
---
Hi, /u/assdickpendits
---
It's useful while levelling for passive mana and health gen. And in Blizzards mind it would probably continue being useful at 60 for generation out of combat. It sort of can be if you're a warrior grinding mobs for example, but it's pretty situational. 
---
Main problem was it was included in the overall stat budget for an item, instead of being roughly equally added on every item. So if you found an item without spirit it would naturally have more of the other stats (which are useful in combat, when it really matters), and obviously be much better.
---
That was a big oopsie on my part, it is indeed Duskwood lol. And the ghosts I was talking about are these https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Unseen
---
Look I totally agree with you, I think there are very strong arguments to be made for some things like this that are more holistic in nature.  The reality is that this subreddit largely subscribes to the "no changes" philosophy. Some are rational enough to at least appreciate the argument and agree/disagree, but it's the minority.
---
Yeah its Duskwood. My bad. The ghosts I was talking about are these https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Unseen
---
Ignoring gold seller spam is a part of vanilla.
---
Difference between "This is garbage" and "This is not for me" is just how you decide to present the same idea, emotionally or politely. I think he chose the right idea for these memes/way he put his opinions out. There are so much reasonable/calm/*careful* content creators that if he would go the same way while talking about the same topics he would be less noticeable, compared to going another way - hard memeing/semi-offensive, etc.
---
Well, you aren’t getting a lot of the flaws and imperfections so is that gonna make you not play?
---
It’s hilarious if you think gold farmers vanished when the wow token was introduced.
---
Um, no, you literally just mentioned Nost. Nost was 4 years ago. It might surprise you to hear that there have been other private servers since then.
---
you take both
---
It's some minmaxery that involves throwing bombs every minute for an extra 10 dps.
---
Well yeah I get that, but if it's possible why not do it?
---
I think this is a classic case of, don't hate the player hate the game, however cheesy or outdated that line is.
---
Gold is extremely meaningful in vanilla and handling it is a major part of the gameplay. Making buying gold "legal" would force pretty much every one to buy them on their first character, since you are always low on gold at early levels. Big part of vanilla is also that the playing field is equal to every one and you have what you have earned with your own work. WoW tokens work on current WoW because gold is meaningless before max level.
---
On the first raid of a given tier, you /roll for your position.
---
You can’t surpass people for performance, but if you miss too many raids you drop down a couple of spots on the ladder, so the most dedicated naturally get the most loot.
---
Good performance is expected from all members,
---
&gt;WoW tokens, on the other hand, don't fundamentally shake the flow of gameplay to me
---
Have you ever played Vanilla? Gold is literally the prime resource of the game. If you make that BUYABLE, you destroy the entire game. No, seriously. You can buy so much shit with gold to make your character stronger and hold advantage over others that it's crazy.
---
Because I dislike gold selling in general, and WoW Tokens are condoned gold selling. And there is a fairly significant portion of people who aren't willing to break the rules to buy gold, but will buy gold if official means are available. I want Blizzard to try and get rid of gold selling entirely, not create more of it.
---
Beyond that, I would argue that WoW Tokens DO inflate the economy, via incentives. The primary audience for \*purchasing\* WoW tokens are people who do not have the time to farm significant amounts of Gold, but the existence of WoW tokens incentivises other players to spend their time in-game farming gold instead of taking part in other activities. Essentially, most of the players buying the tokens with cash weren't going to be gold farming anyway; and some of the players buying the tokens with gold, wouldn't have farmed that gold if the tokens weren't available for purchase.
---
wonderful system.
---
A good GM is someone who can lead a guild or group of people but is smart enough to assign important roles like raid leader, class leader, recruiting or even "banker" to other key trustworthy players.
---
Been a "clan" leader in several other games, and I plan on bringing my crew to Classic.  Much like if you are a manager at an actual Job, role assignment and leadership are the most important traits you can have.
---
Lead by example.
---
That was low-key huge for healers.

So true but i have a secret blizzard isn't allowed to know
---
###I don't want to risk my characters just vanishing one day when blizzard comes knocking###
---
I figure in a year or two, hell maybe even within a few weeks since I'm sure there are already gold-selling farms planned to set up shop within hours of launch with their myriad of bots, people will be demanding Blizzard be more on-top of the gold-selling spam and advertisement whisper spam and then we'll be right back on this same topic. Should we add the one thing Blizzard did that basically removed the issue of gold sellers, or should we continue to let them pester us and make our experience less enjoyable due to the constant whispers from a plethora of botted accounts?
---
And I've played in all the popular ones as they got released. Predecessors of Nost with dynamic spawns and high pops, just like Nost.
---
The answer to gold selling is not to embrace and normalise P2W. Seemingly people will accept any kind of mental gymnastics when it benefits them.
---
Tokens/gold selling has a huge impact on the game. It's true that gold sellers have been and will be a thing, but you don't seem to see a difference between fighting it and endorsing it. Gold selling causes inflation which devalues every legitimate players time spent farming.
---
Think it's worth it to save mining materials for eng later?

I fully expect Blizzard to ramp up on taking legal action against vanilla pservers once classic releases.
---
What are you talking about?
---
They're literally recreating flaws like spell batching to make classic more authentic...
---
I will try my best. This time around with 40 man raids and a group 1 and group 2, its paramount i can build trust with core members to help run the guild. Without sacrificing my role as a leader or jeopardizing the guilds integrity.
---
Any tips on good trust building exercises in classic wow?
---
Wow tokens are made way too easily available. Literally a few minutes with a credit card and you are flush with gold, grabbing all the best BoE shit off the AH and just paying to win. Chinese gold on the other hand always came with a certain risk. You were putting your information out there. You might get scammed or permanently banned if blizzard found out. Felt a lot more sketchy and as a result a lot of people didn’t do it. I would rather put up with an occasional Chinese website whisper than an intrusive wow token
---
Actually, you might need to since you are the one misunderstanding something he said, when it's easy to understand.
---
Also, your toxic behaviour is hilarious. Keep doing it so we others can laugh at this for a bit longer.
---
I've actually seen this subreddit shy away a bit from the "no changes" mentality, but I think that's mostly because after the (extremely inconsequential, temporary, beneficial) changes to add sharding in like 6 zones for a few weeks and loot trading since CS just isn't what it used to be, a lot of the "no changes" people gave up on Classic, and that mostly leaves players who are fine with what Blizzard deems as "necessary" changes (for better or worse) and players who are "okay maybe some changes are fine" but still brigade for no changes regardless.
---
holy ... 300 armor?
---
That's borderline insane.
---
Ohhhh!!! Did you solve it?! Can I make a raid at level 5 and not gain exp from mobs? XD
---
Some add-ons yes. Newer and more modern add-ons may have their functionality disabled for classic.
---
Thank you for a genuine explanation and reasoning.
---
Come on, you were trying to come off like you are  better than OP because you "have a life". Stop playing dumb.
---
Just because someone is gonna book off a week or two to nerd it up like they did when they were younger doesn't mean they have no life.
---
Pservers also have gold buying, voting for gear and rewards, loot trading (through GM ticket), crashes, a lot of bugs and unfinished scripts.
---
And die out now and then. Or get sued and shut down. Or drama that shuts it down
---
Short answer: Not too much if you aren't planning on playing endgame content (or do plan to play endgame content but not in a hardcore progression group).
---
Long answer: Yes, those racials can be a huge difference while levelling and at endgame content. While I imagine that you probably aren't looking to raid at the level of a group like Method, the racials can be a huge boon, both while levelling and at endgame content.
---
While the individual numbers aren't huge, in and of themselves, the specialization racials only giving 1% expertise for example, that 1% means less itemization needed to be spent on trying to reduce bosses dodging or parrying your attacks as a tank, or simply dodging them if a DPS.
---
Even before you reach endgame content, fewer dodges and parries means faster mob kills, which means (ideally) less damage received from those mobs since they die faster, which means less down time between pulls dedicated to eating/drinking.
---
More specifically, when applied to Mages (the class you've expressed interest in playing) the bonus to your mana pool may be extremely small, all things considered, but when you think about how many extra spells that small amount of mana will allow you to cast before needing to regen mana over the life of your character will add up to a considerable reduction in down time over the life of your character.
---
Having said all of that, play what you want to play. Unless you TRULY derive your fun from Min/Maxing, then no amount of optimization will make a character fun that isn't what you truly want to play. And if your idea of fun is being the best you can with the character you want to play, then you could be the #1 ranked player for your class, but because you chose your class, race or spec based on what was deemed "best" by the number crunchers who look for the ultimate Min/Max setup, it'll only ever feel like a chore or job.
---
TLDR: The racials matter when looked at over a long timespan of a character's life, but they matter absolutely zero if you aren't having fun.
---
Oops, i upset the #nochange team. :)
---
&gt; They got it right in tbc. All classes has something unique to bring, it was better to have a balanced group but any good player would do.
---
What are you talking about? In TBC mages were literally ousted for Warlocks because they did the same thing but far better... DPS was completely out of whack in TBC to the point tpons of people re-rolled warlock.
---
I will admit that Blizz gave more love to some underutilised specs in vanilla, like Prot Pally and Boomkin. But because they made classes all similar, the slight power advantage that warlocks had meant that they were just straight up better to bring than mages, hunters and most melee DPS as /u/wulgpwns points out.
---
Well, if you don’t have a quality group, you don’t have a raiding guild.
---
The way to get dedication and performance is to have high standards for EVERYONE, not to reward the high performers.
---
The reward is membership in the guild, and the fruits should be spread out evenly.
---
My favorite raid was probably ZG... I mean as far as progression was concerned, I made it through C'thun in AQ40, and did basically nothing in Naxx. By the time Naxx came around I wasn't really raiding anymore, just with my guild casually.
---
But something about ZG just kind of spoke to me, even if it was pretty damn easy. Maybe it was the locale and the flora and fauna, but I just had a good time there.
---
I wouldn’t say Spell Batching is a flaw. I’m talking more bugs in the open world and raids that just shouldn’t be there. 
---
But there are literally people in this community who want those bugs in the game for that”classic feel”
---
Well fuk... id still die for classic tho so...
---
You're ignoring the fact that the token doesn't get rid of goldselling nor account stealing, those things still happen on retail.
---
The purpose of the token is not to combat goldselling but to make Blizzard earn more money for each sub (20$ instead of 15 and no discounts like you get with real money).
---
The token only encourages to buy gold those who wouldn't otherwise because they want to avoid the risks.
---
That being said, I know very well how the token works and I wouldn't care that much if it was added to Classic but I believe it doesn't make sense from a business perspective because retail is still Blizzard's flagship and by not adding the token to Classic you're pushed to play retail if you want to pay your sub with gold (that I believe is also one of the reasons why the sub is shared).
---
While gold was certainly bought before the introduction of the token, I would wager that there were far fewer players who did so merely because of the risk associated with it.
---
I never bought gold until the token was added, as I'm sure a lot of people never.
---
I think the same logic applies to vanilla servers. There were people who had no qualms with playing on a pserver (myself included) but plenty of those who would never do so and will only do so when Classic drops.
---
i suppose because some people have such boring and monotonous jobs/lives that they just want a chance to engage in a race/competition in a game they know is gonna be great. probably has to do with nostalgia and wanting to escape/return to a better time. for me, i didnt get far into wow because of the sub back in the day. only got 1 month in, got to around 50. runescape was only 5 bucks so my mom was willing to do that lol.
---
I feel like there's an issue that people don't talk about much, but I think that there's a real risk that within a few years, however, (though that's a ways away) we might run into the issue of hyperinflation. It won't take *nearly* as long as it did in retail, especially given the smaller playerbase and slower gold output, but I think a hyperinflated economy that makes breakthrough for newer players next to impossible is going to inevitably become an issue some years down the road.
---
But, just like "wHaT HaPpEnS AfTeR NaX!?!?", we'll worry about that when we come to it.
---
Or you respec. 
---
Now you need 100 golds per week so you have to farm.
---
You'll encounter plenty of PVP on your farming spot making it less boring, win win.
---
In 2005 I lent a guildie the last 200g so he could purchase his epic mount. At the time we were just acquaintances so it was a bit of a risk on my end and a massively meaningful gesture from his end. 
---
He worked dilligently to pay me back and that meant a lot to me. We ended up becoming pretty good WoW friends for the next year and a half. There was a little bit of a bond forged just because gold was hard to acquire. Would that have happened if there was a gold-buying interface built into the game? 
---
There are so many similar reasons along those lines.
---
Well I am hoping there are others out there in my shoes. All my old guild mates have aged, and moved on or lost contact.  I'm hoping its a rewarding experience to start from scratch as the GM this time around. Returning players like myself, who want a quality guild and a competitive scene without the bias of pre existing guild cores.
---
Haha you should quote what I said about retail so everyone can laugh with you
---
His point was that poison procs aren‘t normalized, so faster weapons apply poisons quicker.
---
You sir, are exactly the reason why I set up my Oceanic guild. Positivity and enjoyment of the game is exactly what I want - so I’m building a place for other likeminded people to join.
---
Remember when the guy you grouped up with to kill a slow-respawn mob then got added to your friends list and you said “Gidday mate” as soon as he logged on or vice versa? 
---
Yeah mate, that’ll be me and **A LOT** of others. Don’t stress the kids and their memes or toxic comments. They’re just kids being kids. They won’t want any part of our type of sub-optimal gameplay but that’s all good, we will have heaps of fun with people trying out new things. 
---
It was never about being the first or the best. It was about the journey we went on, getting that first raid purple or seeing that big fiery dude take a nap. Or just saying “ding!” and getting a bunch of “Grats man”. That’s what WE BRING!
---
I’d like to believe that gold selling will be somewhat less problematic now than it was in classic.  Blizzard’s detection systems have only improved, so the cases that occur should be more likely to lead to bans.
---
kinda sad that blizz has decided we’ll all be using identical near bis blues for about a year basically out of laziness on their part and the community seems stoked about it.
---
You realize the wow token is basically zero sum?  It just redistributes wealth as it requires people both selling and buying it
---
Not immediately.
---
You have to give time to developers to adapt addons to work with the Classic client.
---
Equally as hilarious as pretending that nothing changed at all is an argument.
---
You have to tryhard your rotation with power shifting and such AND tryhard your farming by soloing Gnomeregan until you can't stand it anymore to get mounds of Manual Crowd Pummelers for their consumable attack speed boost. With BiS gear, hours of extra farming over and above every other class, and top-tier execution, you can have...mid-tier DPS. They're not as bad as once thought, but it takes a lot of commitment for a frustratingly mediocre level of output.
---
Truthfully? I guess its the anticipation more than anything, Wow was my first MMO (excluding runescape lol) and it has so much good memories from when i was a kid, meeting people whom become good friends from all different places around the world while i was young, having an actual reputation on your server, (being /w by mutiple people instantly when logging on for a group they are forming, spending long hours in dungeons and purposely adding the good party members to play with later, and actually playing with them later!), but I guess like me, loads of people are forgetting the annoying parts too, since you mostly only remember the good.. i was a neglected child that had little affection from people, and feeling wanted was such a nice feeling, i guess its just old emotions taking over.
---
I am going to take off AT LEAST 5 days off work, (have 15 to take) maybe even extend it depending on how I feel as it gets closer, I have already told me fiance (who will be my wife when classic releases, as long as its not in the next 2 months) that we will be having multiple date nights before it releases, and that this is going to be my time, she has her own time sometimes too, shes spent mutiple days playing maplestory (i play it too) with old friends so i guess its kinda the same, we have a relationship where we dont need to constantly validate eachother, we will be spending time togthere, but that will be going to gym and food time mostly. 
---
sorry for long read, i understand if you dont understand my view on it, and thats okay, :)
---
I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the gold token - it's not Blizzard just selling gold to people, it's them selling an item which they can in turn sell to other players.
---
that belt is so fucking hard to get. raided mc for 6 months on the last server i played on and only saw it drop a few times. never went to me. sadly we’ll see 90% of casters in the same blue belt for all of classic.
---
Not that good
---
Same question as to all the other internet-legal geniuses goes to you:

What legal action exactly is Blizzard going to take against a PServer that is hosted in Tuvalu, Kiribati, Palau or a similar country?
---
You wanna send a cease&amp;desist order to a provider in Bulgaria? Best use soft absorbent paper, that will ease the use-case tremendously.
---
[Okay okay, it's the closest thing I could get to crayons! I couldn't resist. As fun as it was to draw this though, it's stale arguing with bad faith actors, so enjoy the drawing and hypocrisy. I even used bright colors.](https://imgur.com/XhWC7BV)
---
If you don't have much time the only important thing is to roll on a PVE server.
---
Since you will always be behind the HC players in term of gear, you would always be the victim in world PVP.
---
I assume you won't raid, so if you want to find instant dungeon group play a warrior tank (level as arms, but respec prot at lvl 60).
---
There will be too much tanks for raids and not enough for dungeons.
---
But frankly, play whatever class you enjoy the most : I had an alt rogue on a PVP server in Vanilla and it was the most populated class, I still could find dungeon places.
---
In the rare instances I log onto WoW to help someone summon a Goblin from the starting zone, or make someone some keys for their Mythic Tol Dagor run or something, I'm not peppered with whispers upon whispers upon whispers for "b u y VV 0 VV G 0 L D @ VV.VV.VV. S H A D Y S | T E . CN | 4 G 0 0 D P R 1 C 3 S" like I am on private servers or was before WoW tokens were introduced in late WoD. 
---
Are people selling Mythic, Mythic+, and raid run carries still an extremely huge issue? Absolutely, and I think Blizzard should start banning people for advertising it, including investigating the guilds linked to the runs for it because I think it's one of those things that's extremely detrimental to progression especially given how common it is, but at least I'm not also spammed with shady links to gold selling websites anymore.
---
Ye, didn't think about that :-) 
---
But with a longer phase 2 people who didn't level up that fast because lack of time (hey, it's still summer) will be able to catch up when BWL releases.
---
This hit too close to home
---
I guess it depends on what you want to accomplish. 
---
Option 1: As a baseline you can pug ZG, eventually AQ20, and eventually MC and BWL if you put a bit of effort into pre raid bis type items and network your way into regular spots. Granted these pugs will not be regular or successful for quite some time but this is the most flexible option.
---
Option 2: Guilds that raid 1 night a week are relatively uncommon in my experience but I've seen their progress as painfully slow through MC and parts of BWL. If you plan to just show up and do the bare minimum this is option you deserve.
---
Option 3: If you plan on putting significant effort into your character at max level outside of raids such as stockpiling consumables, stock piling gold, being a 110% prepared, and bring a reliable raider for 1 day a week then 2-3 day a week semi serious raid guild may want to take you to raids when needed. If your going to put time and effort into your character in general joining as a social/perpetual trial raider will allow you to kill bosses taster than you thought was possible
---
I leveled this way recently and I absolutely love it.  It's not the fastest kills, but if you're doing it right you just don't stop.  Like, at all.  If you pull too many, you can normally heal yourself enough to stay alive and shadowmeld is OP af. 
---
On top of that, I don't have to switch specs to heal at all.  If you build it right, you have tons of spirit and shields can be very mana efficient if you invest a little in the talent tree.  I leveled the entire way to 60 that way and never changed spec.
---
Downside is you're useless in 1-on-1 pvp and you don't have the burst damage.
---
Upside is you're a NE and not a fucking dwarf.
---
Link to build: [Elune's Spirit](https://symmetrywow.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=45)
---
I tweaked it a little bit to fit my personal play style, but I think its a pretty solid build.  Very fun way to play, but def not min/max.
---
I totally get your view on it, and my relationship with the game is similar. It was the only real social interaction I had outside of the same people at school, and it was the only way I could talk to my dad who was deployed in Iraq at the time. I appreciate the long read, cause that was a really good insight on what Classic is going to be like for others. Thanks!
---
Why would I buy the wow token if I can buy gold from the chinese at the fraction of the price lol.
---
Building a gold-buying interface into the game is a pretty big deal, regardless of the source of the gold.
---
I just tried a raid with 2 people. Didn't reduce Exp gained.  
---
Going to do some tests with more people and while questing.  
---
Seems like a ton of work if we have to disband and party up again.
---
The same can be said for a proper damage dealer who does twice as much (or 3 times as much) damage as a boomkin.
---
it's fun
---
But the argument is basically in game (WITH "changes") vs sketchy outside of the game
---
DW leveling is perfectly fine, nothing that requires a "PSA" at least.
---
I mean, you could still get those big ticket items for extremely cheap every now and then, even on extremely high pop servers (think nost). Had people snagging the gloves for like 30g all the time.
---
Just like buying it from gold sellers...
---
Very few people realize this and subsequently REEEEE about inflation and stuff that doesn't happen, like the economy being ruined.
---
Gold isn't hard to farm, I want to pay for my sub with it.
---
Up to you really. Personally I would buy gear from the AH if you don't need to save it, to making your leveling experience smoother/faster.
---
I hope. I should've prefaced by saying that I'm absolutely cool with WoW tokens not getting added, but at the moment I'd much prefer them over the extremely obnoxious flood of gold sellers. It's a matter of preference. I've never purchased or sold a WoW token since they were released, so I still never plan to use one, but if them simply *existing* helps stem the tide of gold sellers then I'm all for them being in the background where I honestly don't have to see them.
---
Even if they were added I don't expect them to get used to the same extent as WoW tokens in retail. I expect using them to honestly be pretty uncommon, because I think a few people at least will share the same mentality. They're a necessary evil that we just won't acknowledge or feed into because its mere presence keeps the gold sellers at bay.
---
&gt; civil discussion
---
Dude you started off by disparaging a whole group of people by misrepresenting their argument to make them sound like assholes.
---
&gt;shitty implementation instead of a reasonable one
---
THe reality is that implementation is difficult and often gets fucked up due to either malice or incompetence. It's the same reason communism has never worked. It sounds nice in theory but it is fucking horrific in practice.
---
Now this is the situation when if you don't care then you should pick gnome, but if you don't like gnomes you pick human. 
---
5% gnome int vs 5% human spirit: (free spell cast and a bit more crit). Spirit is not entirely useless on mages, but still less impactful than int. Gnome wins.
---
Escape artist vs Perception: EA might be not that amazing on mages as it is on other classes, but perception is pretty much useless racial for anyone besides human rogues. Gnome wins.
---
Gnome arcane resistance vs sword/mace skill for humans: the Arcane resist bonus is small but it could help in PVP and specific PVE situations. You are not going to be hitting anything with swords, so again - Gnome wins.
---
Engineering Specialization vs Diplomacy: 315 Engineering skill lets you summon 63lvl creations as a gnome, the rest races summon 60lvl. Diplomacy (+10% rep bonus) is a great helper if you are grinding and saves you time, but... it's just going to take a bit  longer as a gnome to achieve the same thing. But as a human you will never ever have 63lvl stuff. Gnome wins(?)
---
Yeah, played a lot of Ragnarok, and some Final Fantasy. Some random other ones as well. But nothing that got me too much engaged.
---
Crazy awesome
---
Amazing work good job
---
I certainly hope it works out for you and your guild
---
Can't hate for getting ganked for it then
---
About a month of playing like 4 hours a day. Weekends probably play like 16 hours a day. :)
---
You can tank all instances fine, however you would probably be an off tank in raids.
---
I won't be taking time off of work or really anything crazy but I personally am excited for the feeling of playing an MMORPG again and seeing the slow progression on my character and having to  earn my items.
---
any reason to hide name?
---
Your biggest gold sinks while leveling will be things like food, water, and repairs. A big amount of gold goes to your class trainer. If you can avoid buying new ranks of spells that you don't use frequently, you'll save a lot of gold. Some other common options for gold sinks are leveling professions or buying gear from the auction house.
---
Back then, the game was vastly different in how it approached players and how players approached it. I don't think Blizzard refining the process like they've done so many times was inherently bad, but each expansion changing the game in newer and newer ways always risks alienating those who preferred things a certain way. I still remember when they started tweaking with how healing worked in Cata and not really meshing well with it. Of course I'd gotten used to the change, but I still liked how things used to be more. 
---
To me, vanilla (and BC for that matter) was where I felt most at home with what was expected from me and what I expected from the game. Certainly isn't the most polished experience, but one I did love.
---
WoW is a lot of peoples favorite game, but not current retail version, they like the old version. Classic wow forces social interaction &amp; world pvp/community. Something retail lacks. I never thought i'd quit wow but BFA made me quit. Now i get my favorite game back, basically. 
---
I look forward to the world pvp, social aspects of wow again.
---
I appreciate the effort but you can't read the comments.  They are really fuzzy and illegible.
---
Never said I'd hate getting banked for it just wondering why somebody thinks aoe farming is obnoxious behaviour 🙂
---
So it seems like a party of 5 would be the best bet so far.  
---
5 People questing together until level 30.
---
There's also seemingly a fundamental misunderstanding of how gold token works. It's not Blizzard just selling gold to people, it's them selling an item (with zero character bonuses) which they can in turn sell to other players, requiring both a seller and buyer for anything to take place.  Yes there could technically be an impact to the economy, but it should largely be a redistribution of wealth.  The argument would be to take this change, which is obviously a plus for blizzard (and for classic's potential longevity with them), to at least get rid of the pervasive and sketchy gold sellers.
---
Why would you sell gold for a fraction of the price for a WoW token since it's literally a net loss?
---
&gt;WoW token is 3,000g per token
---
&gt;shadysite.cn is selling 3,000g for $10
---
&gt;Buy 3,000g from shadysite.cn
---
&gt;Spend 3,000g on WoW token
---
&gt;Now I have a $15 WoW token in my Blizzard account
---
&gt;???
---
Hmm I wonder if it's more farming than Warriors having to farm Titanic, LionHeart and possibly edgemasters? Also what's powershifting?
---
Thanks for the input though, guess I should decide how no-life I want to go :)
---
It will be a competitive environment and we will lose and gain people along the way who want to keep their spot. Quality is harder to come by the higher the standards, starting a fresh guild not everyone may be on par at the start.
---
Even the lowest performer can be one of the most dedicated members of the guild. As long as he has the will to improve. Learn upon his mistakes and make changes and ask questions they will stay. You get out what you put in.
---
What about MadSeasonShow tho?
---
At this point I would love if blizz teased adding in tokens, just so all the wannabe elitists have to actually come up with points as to why they are bad. Spoiler: they are not.
---
Thanks buddy. Victory or Death!
---
Why couldn't someone just answer like this guy, simply saying "that was a thing in wrath or cata". Done. Corrected. Everyone is happy. I go "aah I see".
---
But no, you gotta downvote me... for asking a question, making an assumption, not being able to correctly pull some trivia out of my ass like a no life hardcore fan. Jesus christ you guys are fucking cancer. Literally can't even ask a question without getting shat on.
---
Hah, that's funny.  Yeah, autocorrect happens.
---
Anyway, I didn't comment because I care if people on this sub think I'm smart, I was pointing out the mistake in the iamverysmart post to which I replied.  Just being pedantic to a pedant, obviously you can relate.
---
What part of your life do you abandon when you use your earned vacation days?
---
This will happen with all classes. You want this to happen to some degree. If all your members of X class like each other its soooo much easier to deal with class balance and loot. So sure, if all the rogues decide so and so needs the rogue item the most and they don't bid against him they get it cheap, and they get to bid more against the other classes for loot. Would you prefer they all hate each other and spend dkp to spite each other or horde it forever refusing upgrades because they want that 1 special item.
---
Good GMs roll main tank and have a main healer egirl who somehow is always at high dip. Sign of a good guild is when said egirl breaks up with him for the Chad dps warrior and the guild doesnt fall apart
---
Yea your body isnt a system that can be gamed /s
---
https://youtu.be/1MbFYHCK1lM

Here is the Alliance guide! Very underrated WoW classic channel
---
For what it’s worth, the other argument against the token is that making it legal to buy/sell gold means a lot more people would do it, than if it carried the risk of getting banned.  I don’t think Blizzard would follow in the footsteps of private servers that published lists of accounts they banned for gold buying/selling as a scare tactic though :P
---
yeah, this is an important point. a big negative of private servers that i havent seen mentioned in this thread is the playerbase themselves. there are a lot of undesirables on private servers who are only there because it's free. even a nominal fee like $15 USD a month is enough to keep these people out
---
this is the single biggest thing i'm looking forward to in wow classic
---
And GL with the temp ban. Half your playtime you won't be playing, instead.
---
Funny, right? Because "Methinks " would autocorrect to, "me thinks". So, case in point...
---
Pretty much this. You'll still be poor while leveling to 60 unless you're months behind.
---
Need to farm vendor items first few weeks till gold is actually in the market.
---
because private servers are illegal you criminal scum
---
If you think the decision was made out of laziness, you are naive and need to take a step back. 
---
WoW Classic is not being developed for the 10% of the community that are PServer diehards. 
---
I agree that fully progressive itemization is ideal but I am a purist and I know what I would be getting myself into. 
---
For the majority of the playerbase, they are not going to want to have to memorize what items they need to keep in their bank for a later patch. Most won't even know that items do update over time and one day they will log in and all of a sudden, their gear is different. 
---
The itemization will not affect raiding. It will not be the difference in a guild downing Ragnaros and wiping for 8 hours straight. The only thing that the itemization affects is the sense of progression. If you are using a level 52 Chest piece all the way until AQ40, it feels bad, but that's about it.
---
&gt; by being in countries that don't adhear to US copyright laws.
---
The server might be in Ruski Vodka Putin land, but Blizzard can still go after the European ISPs that facilitate the connection to said servers.
---
Druids are always nice, they bring so much utility to the raid it's crazy. They are also very rare in raids because most people seem to believe they are not as good as the other pure classes. This is of course very wrong, they are capable of great healing output, but they are just incredibly difficult to play. Their big weakness is their mana pool. All their spells are really expensive and mana inefficient. Luckily they have an insane mana recovery spell right? Well unfortunately it's not rare that you will be assigned to innervate a priest instead of yourself. Although it's becoming rarer so that's good. I always refuse innervates when offered unless it's the ferals. 
---
Feral is great, but again, not easy to play. When you are timing your powershifts with energyticks and using tons of hard grinded consumes and you are still beaten by the mage who literally just stands still and presses frostbolt... well it kinda taps your will to play the class.
---
I'd rather not play at all than play on a private server.
---
Great perspective. I never thought of it that way, if I could incorporate the Class leaders and class groups to work together like that before every raid. Maybe a mix of DKP and suicide kings where every class has its own ladder.
---
I am not going to take time off work or stuff like that, but i am going to play Classic hard, it will be the only game running on this computer the next 2-3 years.  
---
*Why i am exited ?*   
---
The friends i made in vanilla i still talk to today, more than 10+ people that have become true life friends, and this was over 12-14 years ago. So im exited to play and talk to people, old and new. Make new friends make new memories.   
---
Just knowing i have a deep love for the game, is enough to know i will enjoy it no matter what Class/Faction/Race i play, whether i PVE or PVP. 
---
The game is still the best game ive ever played. And i started to play games when they where on cassette bands and keyboard connected to the TV.  Its more than a videogame, its a way to escape reality and deep into a great world, with like minded people. I might not be able to play the game as much as i did in my mid 20's, still dont matter.  
---
There is moments you love the game and moments you get so angry and annoyed. it all just adds up.
---
This is called grieving, not player versus player.
---
This is an extremely bad faith argument. You are posing this as if we have to chose between wow tokens or gold sellers, which is baseless and stupid. 
---
It gets even more fucking stupid the moment you realize gold sellers will simply sell tokens for real world money, which the buyer proceeds to sell on the AH.  
---
How about this: blizzard gets their act together and curbs gold selling, not ruin the economy by pretending g they’ve solved it by obscuring the pipeline and dipping in on the action themselves.
---
Thankfully most of the community is old enough now where Egirl drama might not be a thing. No one steals this  ORCS E GURL. will have to add egirl to the application.
---
&gt; /u/awesometographer where you at fam?
---
doing pally leveling math, as always. This is cool and /r/dataisbeautiful - but I've got my hypothetical 1-60 time down to 98 hours. Need more.
---
pretty sure killing other players is defined as pvp :P
---
This would be true for me if Ubereats wasn't a thing.
---
Yeah and Blizzard buys gold from the Chinese farmer so now they can spy how their network operate. A few weeks / months later once they have enough data on who's who they ban all the accounts involved in the network.
---
It takes time, but it works.
---
There is one terrible memory I want to fix by playing Classic, killing Nefarian, for real!
---
I was in a small guild which could barely count 20 players and to access MC and then BWL, we had an alliance with another guild, just a bit bigger than my guild.
---
With this alliance, we cleared MC and we tried maybe three times Nefarian (I still remember Chromaggus kills!) when the other  guild decided to recruit more and they stopped inviting us.
---
I think I will never forget how disappointed I was at that time :/
---
We were able to clear ZG and AQ20 after that deception, even Onyxia as she had been nerfed and some of us had some good stuff (my hunter had 6/8 T2 for example!) but it was not I wanted to do!
---
I recently had the occasion to clear BWL on a pserver but by the time I reached lvl60, my guild was already clearing AQ40 and BWL was then not a challenge any more, I did not like it at all :( My hunter did not have the Onyxia scale cloak so you can imagine how interesting was the fight for me, I died as soon as Nefarian randed :(
---
Competition is healthy for any market. If blizzard isn't willing to deliver a quality product they will crash and burn to their competition. And that's a good thing for us consumers because it pressures them to deliver a game we want to play.
---
&gt; A c&amp;d order from an american court, is worth less than used toilet paper to a hosting provider in Tuvalu.
---
Watch out US. That powerhouse Tuvalu with total GDP of $39 million  and 11,192 citizen is real scary.
---
Sorry I don't get it. What did I do wrong? 🤔
---
"drinking when you're thristy" doesn't work for some people, like me. I would die of dehydration because I don't feel a strong thirst. I have to force myself to drink.
---
Sorry if I offended someone in 2019
---
Not many people purchased gold from Chinese farmers. Of those who did, many were suspended/banned. Other people heard about that and then didn't buy gold. 
---
Contrast that situation with Blizzard literally baking a gold-buying interface into the game. Surely you see that many, many more people will now buy gold than did before.
---
Technically yes, but the players you are killing not only have no chance against you, on top of that you're increasing the chances of these players of:
---
1)Logging out/ taking an extended break.
---
2)Making them quit the game(less players for you to fight),
---
When Rag dies on day 5 reality is going to sink in.
---
People that play video games are mostly idiots.. that said, it also doesnt matter if all their info and identity gets sold and stolen because... they are idiots and it doesnt matter
---
yaaaaa don't mix dkp and sk. 
---
do use class leaders. the key to a good RL and GM is distribution of power and responsibilities. Your CL and officers need to be empowered to act in your name and you need to trust and back up their choices or get new ones.
---
I will be using SK with a loot council in my guild raids. Tanks and healers need to be geared in order to progress in content so their gearing takes priority over the DPS. But beyond that SK is the fairest system in my mind. It lets people who are geared for the content other than 1 or 2 upgrades come and build up their place in the list and it lets newer people sit at the bottom collecting tons of gear without having to go negative or come for several raids and watch upgrades get DEed because they can't afford the DKP.
---
Browsing this thread I finally found out why I didn’t recognize half of the pre raid bis when I tried out a private server...
---
Actually Blizzard has already proven that private servers were informally wrong on data. Blizzard has the data and will make it authentic over the private servers. Eventually the private servers will data mine the files and change the values and such when classic releases.
---
Those are one time grinds, which are admittedly tough, but the Manual Crowd Pummelers you basically have to tack on every week over and above your usual consumable farming because they have consumable charges on the weapon which is what you're using them for, so it's kind of a different category than most BiS gear grinds. And powershifting is where you take advantage of (I believe) the Wolfshead Helm and some talents to gain energy by switching out of cat form and then back into it really fast. You have to time it right before your natural energy gain tick in order to get the most out of it and max your DPS. Basically you burn all your energy and finish with a 5 point Ferocious Bite, then powershift on time to immediately get I want to say 80 energy back (could be 70 but I think 80) so you can immediately start shredding again
---
why would I
---
Somewhy, I imagen the onxyia logo as u presented, but with a dragon eye in the "O"
---
Diablo 1/2 please !
---
I've been buying for years but sure.
---
Dude, you are just delusional. Did you even bothered to check what Tuvalu is? It's tiny Oceanic country with 12k population and $39m GDP. And it in this case Blizzard has enough money to buy it out or at least completely ruin their economy.
---
Agreed. Tokens work in OSRS for a reason but they would definitely not translate well into Classic WoW.
---
12 years of something happened.
---
Bought millions on retail and haven't got a single warning
---
What are like 3 or 4 advantages each of going gnomish vs goblin engineering?
---
Chuck Norris jokes are infinite content
---
I would call someone who is dedicated and wants to get good a valued asset of the guild regardless of current performance, within reason.
---
These people will often be able to coached into being really good over time and will be extremely loyal.
---
Yeah for sure. Just look up eng leveling guides and they'll tell you how much you should be saving in order for you to reach 300.
---
Are you really not getting it, or are you deliberatly pretending to not get it? Because I can't believe that I have to explain such a simple matter.
---
It doesn't matter how small Tuvalu is.  
---
They are an independent country, with their own legal system.  
---
And therefore, they can safely wipe their bottoms with anything coming out of a US court.
---
And as a matter of fact they are doing exactly that, on a daily basis.
---
People are also upset because they are used to the pay to win lifestyle of BFA and they’re scared of getting their bnet accounts banned if they try to live the same lifestyle of getting carried through every raid and gear boosted out the ass.
---
I pay $15 a month for an emulation of Vanilla WoW, if I don’t get that emulation, then I’ll switch to a private server that has a more accurate representation of the game I love like I have for years.
---
People aren’t going to stop buying gold, if my $15 a month can’t pay for GMs to detect and ban gold sellers/buyers in a 20 year old game then I’ll take my business elsewhere, simple as that.
---
Assuming you wont be in hardcore pve &amp; pvp groups:
---
The majority of players will run around with inefficient specs in pvp or pve anyways, because the large amount of them cant be bothered to constantly respec.
---
Those pvp specs wont do as well in pve. Those pve specs wont do as well in pvp.
---
Just do your stuff, you can do both. Noone will rip your ass because your a combat rogue, because their holy priest wont survive it anyways.
---
He griefs because he [thinks he's cursed](https://youtu.be/OWLYq2EdTqA) since bad things happen to him when he tries to steal stuff.
---
They can't "fuck it up" because anything they put out will be better than w/e vanilla private servers you've played simply because it will be handled properly and not go anywhere. You can go back to the same server years into the future without your characters randomly be deleted. That's why I am not worried in the slightest. If there's issues on launch, people will voice their opinions and they'll change it to be closer to vanilla
---
This, everyone will want deviate delights for the entirety of wow classic. That's exactly what an angler wants.
---
No I wasn't. You're inferring that completely from your own prejudices.
---
I answered the post title, gave my personal reasons for my choice and never addressed OPs choice to do it.
---
I haven't lost myself in a virtual world for 10 years. I want to come home.
---
Don't forget that the other group members have to be close to you to leech your XP. If they sit in a capital city far away it won't affect your XP.
---
About the raid experience I wouldn't trust private servers implementation, but I'd bet a group of 5 would be more than enough to leech XP.
---
There's a formula somewhere about group experience : I think you receive 1.4 times more XP per mob (group bonus) but you divide the exp by 5. So a group of 5 would give you about 1/3 less experience than solo.
---
Oh wow, that's kind of awesome. They really do need every trick to be competitive on the charts then. 
---
I will say farming Gnomer instead of skipping right to the Crowd Pummeler gives you a chance for fused wiring drops, which go for 3-6g each.
---
In TBC it was conventional to put deadly on main hand unless you had windfury. With slice n dice, mongoose procs, drums it was extremely uncommon to lose your 5 stacks during your normal rotation.
---
Paladins just become boring Priests in end game PVE healing. For PVP there's no doubt in my mind that a Shadow Priest is more fun than a Paladin, so I personally see Priests coming out ahead in both PVE and PVP. The efficiency of Priests makes them above average levelers. Hunters, Druids, Warlocks (and maybe AoE farm Mages) are faster, but those classes trade it off by not being as in demand as a Priest later.
---
Wow I am impressed ma dude ❤️
---
How can they catch up if they're ganked 24h a day ? :D
---
can't wait where u can't actually get the same gear power as mythic raiders only doing mythic dungeons.
---
Which wasn’t very difficult to achieve.
---
totally. being forced to be "the chosen one"  really kills the immersion for me.
---
they thought that making the game easier would yield more players LEL.
---
Joined this sub a couple weeks ago and just bought a new laptop.  Can't wait to play!
---
And yet the classes all felt like what they were. Everything had distinct flavor and play styles.
---
i don't care for blizzlike much personally but spend one week around wowservers and tell me that isn't the most colloquially agreed upon format for a server.
---
&gt;They can't "fuck it up"
---
_"Hey, there. So, as you may know, we really love Classic, but we feel that a too large portion of the community is left behind in the raiding system. We therefore introduce CLASSIC LFR (R) to alleviate that problem, and grant all our customers the experience they hope for. Oh, ald also, LFD, and its cross-realm"_
---
The above is sarcasm right now, but if I have learned one thing about Blizz in the last 14-15 years, it's that no amount of upfukkery is beyond their abilities :P
---
This isn't my opinion on why tokens are bad but a explanation on why blizzard will unfortunately probably put them in game and I've come to terms with it.
---
Blizzards looks at it this way... we can either:
---
1) Not sell wow tokens and spend money on gold selling detection.
---
Or
---
2) Sell wow tokens legitimately and not have to spend nearly has much money on detection. 
---
2, obviously is the better business decision for blizzard and blizzard is a business. They dont spend money on detection and make money off the tokens. Win, win. Where the other option is lose, lose for them.
---
I know how gold tokens work and I agree they are the best way to sell gold in-game. The issue I have with them is that they make buying gold legal instead of bannable offense. New players are going to feel like they are forced to buy them since they are always short on gold. Blizzard has also gone a long way in the last ~15 years in blocking spam messages in-game, so it's not going to be as bad as it was in real vanilla back then.
---
Yeah, you can certainly get some gold farming done at the same time while you farm them. But they are sadly BoP, so you HAVE to farm them yourself. No AH supplementation.
---
People have been waiting to play a game like vanilla again since almost as long as you have been alive.
---
Imagine you really liked chocolate as a small kid and it wasnt available for 15 years.
---
Wouldnt you be excited its back after such a long time of waiting ?
---
Thanks! I'll be fury for guild, but I know tanking will help gear every one so the more I can do the better!
---
This logo style inspired by Path of Exile? Looks great!
---
Make clear rules. Stick to them.
---
&gt;98 hours
---
Woah, that sounds crazy already. How much lower do you think you can get it?
---
Yeah that's fair, I do think there are still a lot who misunderstand them but there are actual arguments to be made beyond that.
---
Assuming it has not been redeemed, and there isn’t an expiry date, I don’t see why not. Try it. You have nothing to lose. Any problems, contact Blizzard Customer Services.
---

That’s not always true people can get used to not drinking enough amounts of water lol
---
Best guild on ND who just cleared naxx server first literally consists of less than 5 humans.
---
hopefully you can make a chuck norris joke without getting banned cause you know blizzards balls dropped off.
---
Oh I don't need the 10 days.   Was hoping I'd find a friend tho 😔 haha
---
That’s a valid point, and a good way of putting it into perspective
---
Yeah it's bullshit that he can only be killed once.
---
I just was looking for my old game discs.
---
As a memory from Vanilla, there's nothing quite like facing Ragnaros for the very first time or even your very first 40 man Raid into Molten Core.
---
&gt;And it in this case Blizzard has enough money to buy it
---
Interesting, on what market exactly would they buy a country? Please point me to the offer of the Gouvernment of Tuvalu, where they name a price.
---
Just to make it completely clear to you how absurdly laughable that statement is: Tuvalus TLD is ".tv" If the country would be up for sale somehow, any number of companies much larger than activision would have already bought it just to get their hands on that TLD.
---
&gt;or at least completely ruin their economy.
---
Another interesting statement. How exactly do you propose they would do that? Half of Tuvalus economy is based on fishing. What exactly did you smoke to assume Activision, a company invested in Gaming-Enterntainment, could corner the global fish Market?
---
If he values being on the ground that much, you won't really have a guild for much longer. Rogues getting smacked in the face is always fun.
---
Once again you confirm you are completely out of touch with reality.
---
Tiny shit-tier county in the middle of nowhere is in no position to ignore US and their court rulings unless it has powerful protector which it has not. 
---
Besides that ping from the middle of Pacific must really be awesome.
---
Yeah, I want to do my last two levels in dungeons so I’m geared by the time I ding 60.
---
Haha, I had a nostalgia moment a while ago and pulled out my vanilla collectors edition to go through the box again, and found one of those. Wondered the same thing.
---
The legitimate reason for what he is doing is to goad horde level 60s to come beat them away. 
---
World PvP is fun.
---
Unfortunately, most players don’t come defend towns from gankers. On top of that, 90% of gankers are cowards and 99% are rogues, so they typically skulk off as soon as people come to defend, defeating the entire purpose and revealing that not only are they bad and 60 v 60 PvP but that they really just wanted to ruin lowbies days.
---
My Guild completely abandoned ship after Mythic Uldir and i'd say a good 70% will resub when Classic drops. The rest aren't really interested in retail.
---
"See back for details"
---
What does the details say?
---
Where's the "I've never played on private servers" option?
---
It's this kind of toxic behavior that really only benefits the troubled individual causing the problems.
---
“Don’t worry baby. You don’t need a condom.”
---
Next Day...
---
yes addons have were a part of classic back in the day and they have said they will allow them again. but it sounds like not all addons will be allowed to preserve classic.
---
Same here! And marauding obviously for that BiS 44-48ish ring aha.
---
Yeah that's kinda the joke, a Mage would be bottom of the totem pole on priority for a super rare drop, so basically I'll be playing Classic a very, very long time.
---
World.
---
RPG.
---
Social aspect.
---
Closed community.
---
You are adventurer, nothing is laid for you.
---
Depending on what you chose to do, you achieve things that set a mage apart from any other mage (for example)
---
LFG for BRD, im a Mage.
---
LFG for BRD, im a mage and got all the keys.

Pretty much sums up what i understand when someone says "MMORPG".

Got to thin out the weak early and it’s fair game. What is sad however is the ninja looting.

But hey, all the power to him. He’s going to be known quick enough and not in a positive way.

Whats up With the Random capitalization of Letters in the Title?
---
I see what you did there. /slowclap +1
---
Is there a comparison of initial vs 1.12 bis gear ? 
---
 [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)  is using progressive itemization right ? I see savage gladiator for prot warrior and not for dps/hunters
---
I see, I'm the bad guy for disagreeing with what I perceive to be a flawed philosophy, and your direct, albeit tame, insult to another is just fine. 
---
And more deflection. Obviously we can't find easy, workable fixes to flaws *in a 15 year old videogame* because global economic systems happen to be really complex.
---
I'm betting continuing this discussion will lead to *super* interesting semantics arguments and *intriguingly* more broad hypotheticals. No thanks
---
PvP with bwl/zg is the pinnacle of the game, imo. 
---
A high skill player in blues can still rip apart a lower skilled player in epics in PvP. 
---
Yet a fully geared arms warrior makes you shit your pants. 
---
I like that a good well geared player feels strong but not overpowered, ie I can shit on people of equal or lower skill with equal or less fear, but players better than me, regardless of gear can beat me. 
---
By the time aq and naxx are out, top geared players can delete characters even if they themselves aren’t that great. 
---
Additionally, bwl/zg gear is, IMO, the most iconic vanilla gear.
---
Ah, I misunderstood your intentions. I thought as we are waiting for the classic release we don’t have friends who don’t already play. ;-)
---
It's a different story if its level 45-55's doing this to level 25+, but being a geared level 60 doing this?
---
The only thing confirmed here, is a very american delusion of superiority.
---
&gt;Tiny shit-tier county in the middle of nowhere is in no position to ignore US and their court rulings unless it has powerful protector which it has not.
---
**A US court ruling has ZERO meaning outside the US.**
---
And unless you propose that the US go to war and invade a dwarf country, for no better reason than to allow some gaming company to come down from a copyright hissy-fit about a 14 year old videogame, that won't change.
---
And on the off-chance that this is what you think could happen, I seriously suggest you seek professional help.
---
I watched some sort of greater rift competition  on the wow twitch channel last night.     And chat was full of people saying classic is gonna be dead in 2 months.     It's funny to me the amount of people who honestly think this.
---
I have 7 of these if anyone wants
---
We did actually try to have the discussions in /raid instead, but we got a lot of negative feedback from players who did not get a chance to roll, basically because they wanted the reason for not rolling to stay between the player and the officer team, rather than being displayed to everyone. They probably found it quite embarrassing. I've had a few players asking me why they weren't allowed to roll and I can always explain to them why. Don't think I've ever had a warlock who didn't understand it. Usually they ask not because they think it's unfair, they just want to know and if they can improve. Definitely present the option to the guild though. 
---
It's definitely important for the class officers to have a clear reason behind their call, which I always have because I'm probably spending a bit too much time on it hehe.
---
[Ban'Ethil Barrow Den](https://i.imgur.com/LXJJ9km.jpg) is where boys became men
---
Your in game name wasn't Azmodan was it?
---
You can play for free till lvl 20
---
Yeah, I wish it was better. I even sharpened the old clips when compiling them and this was as good as it gets. I'm guessing you played on the same server as Bloodsworn and Vekor? Any idea where they are?
---
Ahh rip, I’m sorry to hear that. he’s just the top ret dps on the unnamed server we play on. Looking through legacy players one day, I noticed he’s got the rank 1 ret spot on about 80% of all raid boss fights. Absolute animal.
---
So you expect other people to prioritize your offspec over their mainspec? r/iamatotalpieceofshit says hello
---
Bit that doesn't let you visit an old toon tho no?
---
Do the two teleport gadgets from gnomish and goblin engineering share a CD? was thinking this time around i would level both.
---
lol it impacts the casuals way more than elitists. Go back to BFA if you want wow tokens and assorted pay2win.
---
the problem with pservers is their longevity. an initial hype followed by a slow and steady death. i just want classic servers to maintain a stable population.
---
there is still a craftable belt "belt of the archmage" which is decent if you are hitcapped tho
---
The weapons you get from Rank 14 rivals AQ, having the honor system in phase 2 will attract a crazy amount of competition.   
---
Getting Rank 14 as one of the only players on the entire realm nets you unrivaled gear. Until Phase 4 arrives you will be the top dog for 2 out of 6 phases in both PvE and PvP. The honor grind competition will be fiercer than it has ever been.
---
&gt; What are like 3 or 4 advantages each of going gnomish vs goblin engineering?
---
I think for PvP Goblin is the better choice, but I'm not that much into PvP, so here's what I consider relevant for my style of gameplay.
---
Gnome:
---
1. [World Enlarger](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23129/world-enlarger): Nice flavour item. Can potentially be useful to make it harder to be detected in PvP. Makes you tiny, what more do I have to say?
---
1. [Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18986/ultrasafe-transporter-gadgetzan):  In my opinion it's more useful than its Goblin counterpart because you can drastically reduce your traveling time to AQ.
---
1. [Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken): While it is useable for Goblin Engineers too, only Gnomish Engineers can craft it. Quite useful for melee DPS.
---
Goblin:
---
1. [Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12758/goblin-rocket-helmet): Quite useful for both PvP and PvE, IMO superior to its Gnomish counterpart.
---
Can anyone tell me what a token is? Is it just buying gold for IRL money?
---
Barrens Chat! :)
---
Private server
---
I agree 100% that more will buy, argument is that buying it has little to no impact on economy so the end result is negligible regardless of whether people use them.  I don’t know if anyone is truly pushing them, it’s more that if Blizz decides to add them then whatever.
---
You intend to sleep less than 6 to 4 hours a day? Jesus dude
---
its cute how naive you are about this. you should never take your privacy and your right to it so casually. There are a god awful amount of apps that even when they are "shut down" still take your info.. little clue.. they aren't shut off and unless you know programming and are going to adjust factory settings yourself you don't trust it.
---
-A strong dose of nostalgia
---
-Positive social interactions (guild/making friends questing)
---
-Greater sense of accomplishment/Time sinks unavoidable (gear is never made redundant/improvements are meaningful &amp; hard earned)
---
-Large investment of time require to achieve prestige ranks (PvP, level 60, raiding gear)
---
They are only usable if you have the required specialization. So you can only ever use one of them.
---
If it drops in September, specially early, I'm gonna try to get 2 weeks off for sure
---
Congratulations.
---
You're the problem.
---
After multiple Blizzard made expansion launches i can firmly say that it is a waste to specifically take vacations days off for it. Most of it was followed with hours of DCs(D3). Even days (WoD).
---
My understanding is that these will not change in classic and they will be released in their final 1.12 form. 
---
Some items will be kept off loot tables until the content release relevant to them. So I expect teir 2 in its final form to drop from Rags and Ony but the items that released with AQ and Naxx will be held back off the loot table like Lionheart helm was added for 1.11 so we won't see the recipe until Naxx.
---
Sure, but once I have cauterizing band I'd be doing Fordrings first
---
It will be great to be able to experience real Blizzlike pservers with progressive itemization since classic won't do it, I will probably play both.
---
 Would be even better if some try to use the older talents so we can have real un nerfed classic
---
I really doubt the US government is going to go after foreign country because of someone hosting a private WoW server. It's not worth their time.
---
Wow, bragging about the master looter thing in UBRS might be the most backwards, toxic thing I’ve heard someone say about this game in a while. Haha. That’s pretty messed up...
---
its already stated here but the answer to OP is a resounding NO.
---
the utility is all filled by a healer or unnecessary and not at all worth the DPS slot. 
---
secondly you have to recognize the fact that hybrids are just self serving specs.. and nobody wants to carry you. it's a social / group / multiplayer game. stop being so self centered. it's not that you can't respec outside of a raid, but wanting 39 people to carry you is a joke.
---
which brings me to.. not only are those 39 people carrying you.. but you're also competing for gear.. which is objectively 100% better off in their bags over yours. they will do more healing, more damage, be better tanks.. effectively you will and should always be last in terms of priority. can you handle this? take it a step further.. things like neltharian's tear, or drake fang talisman.. you should virtually never see unless you're rolling against alts... which then begs the question.. why not just contribute to the best of you and your classes ability via the best possible spec.. and wait until that moment anyway? 
---
don't play a class expecting to be a successful hybrid, play a class you'll enjoy PvEing or PvPing on that best works in tune with others... while you slowly work on obtaining the off-spec gear down the track. 
---
look at it this way, no matter what, you have to respec for PvP and PvE, so it doesnt matter what spec it is if you're pvp focused anyway.. and if you're doing it for PvE.. get out of here... you care about PvE but you're willing to be bottom of the barrel DPS and get carried, burdening your raid / guild ? 
---
\*this is the sound of me shaking my head\*
---
theres no argument. hybrids are just self centered specs played by people who either have no real exp / idea, or are try harding to be successful in a niche spec where your competition is full of the aforementioned people with no exp / idea. it's literally the special Olympics.
---
Hahaha glad it made you laugh brother
---
A perfect guild master is no guild master.   A ruling council (I don't mean a loot council) that shares power is better.  It's harder for a group of 5 people ruling by consensus to become corrupt than a single person ruling by fiat.
---
Obviously, someone needs to have the guild leader tag, but I think guilds work better when no one has an ultimate veto.
---
As for loot....there is no best.  DKP and Loot Council both have problems.  It's possible to carefully craft a hybrid system that will eliminate some of these problems, but no system is perfect.
---
Loot Council:
---
**\*\*Pros\*\***
---
* Loot can be settled faster if priority is known before items drop.
---
* Loot can be prioritized so that it goes where it will most help progression.
---
* Upgrades never rot.
---
* No DKP to track.
---
**\*\*Cons\*\***
---
* Favoritism and corruption are the rule, rather than the exception.
---
* To actually distribute loot fairly, player performance, attendance, and loot must be tracked with even more precision than other systems.
---
* Players have no control over what loot they get.
---
* People will leave over loot if they believe someone got an item over them for personal reasons.
---
DKP:
---
* Players have full agency over their loot choices.
---
* Infinitely less loot drama.  No one ever left a guild because they bid 100dkp and someone else bid 120dkp.
---
* Far less potential for favoritism than loot council.
---
* Quantifying player contribution is much easier.
---
* Loot takes longer to do when bosses die.
---
* People may pass on upgrades, letting them rot, in order to horde DKP in search of bigger fish.
---
* DKP must be tracked and updated.
---
* Items won't necessarily go where they will help the guild the most.
---
Are you implying that we should declare war, or place an embargo on a small island with less than 12k people? Surely not.
---
Then you have a medical condition :p  
---
The vast majority (don't wanna use made up percentages but I'd wager \~99%) is absolutely fine with drinking when their bodies tell them they need to.
---
I don't believe that's a very common misunderstanding at all.
---
I think EPGP with decay after every raid is way better than DKP imo.  GDKP is toxic for a guild.  
---
Loot Council better keep really good records because it's easy for people to feel cheated by loot councils.  i.e. if they get passed over for an upgrade for too long.  Loot council works better in a 20 man raid setting.
---
Do you have a portfolio?
---
And as I said, you could still bring 4 mages instead of 4 warlocks and run through Sunwell as a guild.
---
Because when you're trying to quest or farm yourself, and some fuckhead mage sweeps in and clears the entire zone, it's fucking obnoxious.
---
The two biggest problems with DKP are point hoarding and collusion.  Particularly if there are public records of how many points people have (which your raid leaders will have to keep).
---
So this is what passes for content
---
Lol these little horde getting shit on is great
---
Gnomish vs goblin engineering? Mainly wondering about the teleport trinkets. Which is which and I'll be playing a horde warlock. More utility is better
---
Ah alright, makes sense i guess.
---
Chilled my spine
---
I sometimes wonder if I am putting out too much info on screen, so thanks for letting me know I am getting it right. More coming soon.
---
Yea when i mention GDKP, its to sell runs to in raid group 2 for pugs. Guildies in the group split the gold evenly at the end of the night.
---
Yeah the problem is that the offensive stats increase a lot while the defensive stats remain the same. So by AQ and Naxx two equally geared players will just one-shot eachother, especially warriors who will just pop a rage potion and whack anyone into the ground.
---
It's all just one big loop
---
Many private servers continue to use OVH. The same you noted applies. C&amp;D's are essentially ignored. Nostalrius were simply abiding by the notice rather than ignoring it.
---
It is quite well known that they didn't *have* to shut down. They chose to. In this sense, they were martyrs and honestly brought about the reason why Classic even exists today.
---
Thank you for your thoughtful post. I have to go to work now but ill will focus on this when i get back.
---
https://barrens.chat/index.php?f=5 this is all the WoW Classic stuff I've made so far.
---
The heck is that 1.9 version? It reads as if it does an AoE the moment you equip it, but I'm gonna presume it's a chance on hit. That's a bizarrely high damage chance on hit for a level 23 item though.
---
Possibly, although it remained "methinks" when I wrote it.
---
I can hear you breathing through your mouth.
---
Thank you so much for posting this!
---
I had completely forgotten about this website but I used to spend hours studying this.
---
Since no one else has mentioned it, I think that EPGP is clearly the best loot system. 
---
We used a simplified EPGP system in the best guilds I was in.  What that meant was you get points for every boss killed, showing up on time, and staying for the whole raid.  You spent points by getting a gear piece.  And a % of both EP and GP decayed after every raid. 
---
It solves a lot of problems with DKP and Zero Sum systems, without having to reset the system when new players join.  
---
Loot councils are really hard to pull off in a 40 man unless everyone is really tight.
---
Honestly just hoping for an online game where people talk and interact. Tried playing retail recently and there was just no sense of interaction with others. It didn’t feel like I was being helpful or useful to anyone. Zones even right outside a faction capitol felt empty. Leveling was such a pointless grind I don’t know why they don’t just make every character start at 120.
---
Well i am a mouthbreather
---
I was going to genuinely digest and respond to your post until that run on sentence clotheslined me off the couch.
---
&gt; Which is which
---
Gnomish: Tanaris
---
Goblin: Winterspring
---
Personally I prefer the Gnomish one for quicker traveling to AQ, but as Horde it's not that bad of a way from Orgrimmar, so I guess it depends on your preference.
---
What's proper leave if not 3 full months paid?
---
Lmao, you literally linked some goof with a Thunderfury... oof.  
---
Memes aside, Vekor certainly wasn't the best player back then but he was way better than the average player. And no, the top .1% aren't always a savages because skill is highly relative, even among the same players. Compare Ksharp's 1st season in cal-i vs his last season, it literally looks like 2 different players. Anyway, the videos you linked are literally over a year older than some of the clips in Vekor's video. Comparing the beginning of Vanilla, when everyone had to learn everything, vs the end, after people had years of practice is silly.
---
Its better to have too much info then not enough. I'm sure your guild leader takes your advice and consideration very heavily.
---
Engineering is mostly just fun. People grossly overestimate vanilla raids. In reality 95% of the fights require 10-20 functioning adults and you can fill the raid with whoever else you want.
---
Do you plan to play classic with your paper thin skin?
---
games today are all instant gratification trash. wow classic is like this slow drip that's going to keep me high for years.
---
Hey Bird,  
---
I use a mix of programs. Mainly Pixelmator for general raster work, Photoshop just for rendering 3D text, and Inkscape for vector drawings. You can see my whole creative suite here if you're interested: [https://barrens.chat/credits.php](https://barrens.chat/credits.php)
---
Some of the elements are re-used graphics assets I found using the wayback machine from old Blizzard work and the rest is hand-drawn from scratch using screenshots I've taken of in-game textures/areas etc. You can see the rest of my work here: [https://barrens.chat/index.php?f=5](https://barrens.chat/index.php?f=5)  
---
Thanks for the kind words too :)
---
So you're not alone, don't watch his videos alongside them. He's catering to the people that enjoy the info and the lore, he said that himself because of the feedback he got
---
Why did you do Ret for pally instead of Reckoning?
---
Haha
---
What's the easiest way to deal with the imp packs in MC. I've seen guilds rotate tanks with AoE taunt, druids tank, having a tank suicide and the raid run past.
---
Diablo 1 I would be against mainly cause it is very basic and has no distinctive qualities to it other than "Original Source material".
---
Diablo 2 hell ya I wonna do a bloody run with top of the line graphics!
---
people will need to be called out. I will do it calmly and with good intentions I expect my decisions to be followed and the GM is just as accountable to the guilds rules. Its not to make anyone feel bad its to bring the guilds standards to everyone equally.
---
add in excersizes when flying back to capital cities etc. also is a good idea to make sure WoW Classic wont deteriate your health :)
---
I was one of these people and it couldn't be more true.
---
Wait. You can't reference a hope that belongs to light on a subreddit about classic? Haaaa
---
answer is gnomish as either horde or alliance. 
---
orgrimmar is closer to winterspring, although the farming there is good... tanaris is necessary for getting to dire maul and silithus quickly. 
---
anyone who tells you different is craaaazy bruh.
---
Getting gold is a VERY large chunk of the game in vanilla. its like 50% of the game at 60. 
---
Removing it will largely remove the game ifself. if someone proposes wow token to classic wow you literally don't know what you are talking about at slightlest in terms of how classic is played. 
---
Classic wow is not retail, its not just different games but a different genres of the game even, stop comparing them.
---
Also selling gold in a non free to play game, and with modern automatic protection systems, will be much harder than you think, its not private servers or other free to play games (like runescape) where you can create infinite free accounts.
---
Non freetoplay games suffer much less from it, and i believe in 2019 blizzard have MUCH better system to track everything and ban them than back in the day. 
---
99% of players will be completely non touched by it. its not like everyone will gets hacked yadada. gold ads gonna be reported and banned.
---
And incase of tokens everyone gets affected by it.
---
so the choice is really self obvious. whoever like actually proposes tokens to classic is literally retarded (really low iq), or have no idea what he/she is talking about.
---
Also most players dont have much gold and spend it on stuff, so hacking wont give much aswell, and you selling bop items. i honestly don't think its viable to bother.
---
Do you mind sharing your thoughts on how EPGP is better than SK?
---
Sounds like you’d be better off just doing dungeons. AoE farming effectively enough to beat 1/4 experience gain would likely clear the mobs in the area which means you’d have to sit and wait.
---
Doesn't matter where you ask to me. Anyway, I had the rank 10 gear: [https://i.imgur.com/Q0uYtai.png](https://i.imgur.com/Q0uYtai.png) but I certainly never wore it over Tier 1. Tier 1 is sick and I believe you are correct that it is better than Tier 2 as long as someone else is proccing the expose in PVE. In PVP, it's light on Stam so it's not the best for dueling but it's amazing for world pvp/BGs and ganking, but it's king of only amazing if your off pieces are amazing as well... aka the xbow, cloak/neck/rings and renatakis. I'm sure it's good without it though. I can't really compare Tier1 to rank 10 perfectly because I quit long before the rank 10 gear was updated but looking at the updated stats I think I would rather have the T1. Honestly, in a good guild, it's probably easier/less time to farm the Tier1 than to get rank 10.
---
There is no way in hell that you managed to objectively asses the current state of the game in 10 minutes. Something tells me that you have made up your mind even before logging in. But hey, I get it, you wanted some free karma.
---
Firemaw's Clutch is also better. And if you're a Warlock you also have the aforementioned Sash of Whispered Secrets and Nemesis Belt which are both also better.
---
So yeah, casters who either don't raid or have terrible luck with raid loot drops will be using a blue dungeon belt which.. is what would happen anyway? 
---
Again, I'm not sure what the issue is here.
---
Stay away from the cliques and the "in" crowd. Don't spend your out of raid time with the same group of people in a password protected voice channel.
---
If you make a rule make sure you're ready to follow through on the repurcussions when somebody breaks it, even if it's somebody you like. Guild members will sniff out favoritism and unfairness quick and it will foster a toxic environment.
---
If you gotta rage do it outside of text chat, outside of voice chat, outside of the game. People will not remember you as the fair guild leader that helped them gear up in preraid BiS, they will remember you as the manchild who hulked out one time on voice chat before disconnecting over something that will always be retarded in hindsight.

I guess I’m only surprised an idiot like this didn’t pick undead

Pretty gimp healing but a great versatile spec that lets you tank too
---
You sound like a school shooter
---
Had this on my hunter, sooooo many /w's from warriors saying things like "what a waste".
---
Just log in to BFA and knock out all the daily content while flying a FP in Classic /s
---
You can purchase a token with real money to sell for ingame gold on the auction house. The people purchasing the wow token with gold can redeem it for game time. This was invented to kill shady gold farmers because there is now a legitimate way to buy gold with real money.

This video explains it pretty well: https://youtu.be/BCWtkTWwpXM

The homogenization of classes and talent trees was a majority reason why WoW retail bled out subs and limps along today.  The destruction of community was another big blow because of LFR/LFG.  Finally, blizzard wasn't happy with their hardcore and casual community, and further diluted the substance of WoW to try and attract people who just don't like MMOs, rather than cultivate the hardcores and casuals they had, which in turn passively draw their friends and family into the game.
---
They didn't make the game "casual friendly," it already was that and they had a large number of that. They got greedy and tried to get those who just don't like MMO or games, went all in on that, at the destruction of their loyal fanbase.  To lose 80-90% of their monthly sub playerbase is all anyone needs to point at.  Ion and Brack killed retail.
---
Holy priest or holy paladin for PvP server leveling, BG grinding, and farming 5s healing and raid healing?
---
I would say no one can be this stupid, but given the current state of the world it sadly seems so mundane now.
---
Hardest part of WoW dungeons is remembering all the routes through some of the later ones.
---
You’ve been so helpful I appreciate it. How good is  T2.5 if you have the hit (3% scope and other shiz)
---
Theyre tied up trying to add spyware to people's mobile phones for blizzcon rn
---
That’s the point. It’s evident.
---
I doubt anyone genuinely expects raiding to be as hard as it was when we knew literally nothing about it.
---
no one has talked about inter social groups and locked discord channels yet, great insight.
---
Both my parents were pretty abusive so dealing with adultchild syndrom has made me immune to rage! my rage management is why i make such a good warrior ;)
---
I'm having a hard time understanding how people still grind to R14 on p-servers.
---
we used warlocks and ret paladins for the back two
---
current resto druid is literally what you'd imagine the class would play like reading the description in 2004.  throw hots on people, jump into cat form and do not meaningless dps, pop bear to soak a big hit or taunt off the tank.  but i get it's cool to just shit on retail and pretend vanilla classes are better than they actually are
---
Actually there was weather in the demo. There are several clips of players farming under the rain.
---
Edit: found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM
---
Could be, all perception.  Fact that it’s looked at as buying gold suggests otherwise to me.
---
Hydrocane? Wowhead said it gives +15 frost res and underwater breathing.. sounds really weak compared to warden staff.
---
We never had much issue with both tanks running in, demo shouting. then AOEing them down. They're not that bad. If they start to get too far into the raid challenging shout them back to you. Or frost novaing them in place. They die pretty darn fast.
---
Do you plan on ever moving out of moms basement?
---
I managed to grind out rank 13 back in the day and oh man what a chore.  Thankfully I was on a reasonably quiet server which made it possible to me.
---
Worst part was literally the week before I hit rank 13 Blizz drastically changed the honor system for AV and suddenly over night every noob in the game was afk farming AV all day.
---
It was super stressful and I pretty much had to roll premades 15+ hours a day that last week. 
---
Sadly the writing was on the wall at that point and I never even bothered trying for rank 14. 
---
Sadly ended up losing the account to a hacker.
---
R.I.P Warlord Lateralus.
---
Health &gt; WoW.
---
Of course, if you managed to get a few and just held on to them, the payout _would_ eventually be pretty nice and it's basically a way to farm endgame raid mats when you're far from 60.
---
Tokens are fine. People will buy gold with or without them, I'd prefer it be through blizzard and not support bot farms.
---
I would have given up 100% after the bug.
---
I'm truly sorry to hear that.
---
The fact that you're even asking these questions means you're on the right path to being a good guild leader.
---
I dont think that Blizz/Activision realizes their retail wow is shit and people cant wait for classic! Omg
---
this is a legitimate hard choice. both have advantages and disadvantages. both can top HPS / bring utility to raids, both are vital in BG's / PvP. both have huge bonuses in WPvP situations (bubble, offensive dispel and fear.. etc).
---
i would choose priest because mind control and the better DPS spec at end game.  
---
oh, and obviously dwarf, so if you can't stomach that race.. then 100% paladin..
---
Yeah just email blizz support they'll likely issue you the game time
---
Release date any hour now.
---
This argument is really weak though, honestly. People coped with it just fine in actual vanilla, and moreover people will already be prepared for stuff like "BWL is coming out at X", it's not really a much bigger deal. Secondly, they can just change it so that the existing items aren't updated, but just the new versions start dropping. If they want to avoid naming confusion, they can just make new names.
---
Now I still accept that maybe this is all still just too much for them, they don't want to put this on all the players, even though this was common back in the day anyway. But even then, they're already establishing that there is gonna be a point, namely Phase 5, in which all of a sudden a load of new items is added.
---
Given that, is it really so much to also do the 1.10+ updates in that same batch? Everyone will already know "Oh hey phase 5 will add new items", changing that to "Oh hey phase 5 will add/update items" is not really a big deal.
---
Honestly it's a weak argument from Blizzard. I think it's just their modern design philosophy shining through that tells them to not modify existing items. Even though they're rebuilding an old game, this is one area in which they just could not resist to let their modern design philosophy take over.
---
&gt;Have knowledge of the game. You don't need to be an ultra nerd with wowhead level encyclopedic  knowledge but if you don't know the raids, general loot, and have an idea of what each class should be doing then you're fucking up.
---
Thanks for the kind words! Yea i spend all my time watching you tubers and re learning. I didn't play a private server prior to classic so I had a lot of catching up to do.
---
Azzmodius.
---
You must be some kind of special retarded to think your 2-min math is the answer to pre-nerf encounter. But pserver players love to tell people what happened yrs ago.
---
Does it work in combat? Because I can just eat out of combat.
---
Why is that ? Was there a meeting where everyone decided the game is about "first" kills for the majority of people now ?
---
&gt; Only a small % purchased gold from Chinese farmers. Of those who did, many were suspended/banned. Other people heard about that and then didn't buy gold. 
---
Source on that.  I knew many, many, many people who bought gold with impunity throughout vanilla, TBC, and Wrath.
---
Only the top guilds on the server get to be so choosy. I'd rather gear up a feral druid that's going to stay for the long haul than gear up a rogue who leaves the minute they have a chance to climb up to a more progressed guild.
---
Blizzard won’t be able to end it all. But they will go after people who they have evidence broke the rules and ban them.
---
I'm not upset. :) I just like to clarify what Classic is so people can manage their expectations.
---
It's not me who decides things. Blizzard does and they agree: "This is an important game in videogame history and there’s not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important." - Brack
---
All the "changes" in Classic are either things which help Blizzard keep the costs down (sharding, loot sharing, one click reporting), are "freebies" because of the updated engine (optional improved shadows, water and ground clutter distance) or just *very* minor things where they decided that reimplementing the original limitations doesn't worth their time (instantaneous mail). There are no content, gameplay or graphical changes. It's a faithful recreation (as much as Blizzard can manage). Asking for changes, however minor, is pointless because Classic is Vanilla, "warts and all".
---
Because there is no difference. Gold bought through tokens or from third parties still need to be earned in game somehow. They bring the same issues, and legalizing it does not solve any of them.
---
Because without the gold farmers we dont get gems like this:
---
https://youtu.be/0dkkf5NEIo0
---
Seriously though I'd rather the token system than mass bots and not being able walk into a major city without trade chat being flooded with gold spammers.
---
Problem is it doesnt stop them. RWT'ers will still buy from gold selling sites because its cheaper than blizzard and those that buy tokens flood the market with more gold causing everything to rise massively in price because its not as valuable.
---
It's only "on par" with Mana Igniting Cord if you think that 1% crit is somehow worthless. And not only that, if you're a Warlock you have [Firemaw's Clutch](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19400) [Nemesis Belt](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16933) if BWL is out and if it isn't you have [Sash of Whispered Secrets](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18809). If you ever raided on a vanilla server you'd know these things rather than spreading disinformation.
---
And if you're a pug trying to get into a good raiding guild you'd be expected to have pre-raid bis regardless of the itemisation patch used. If they did progressive itemisation they'd expect you to have Clutch of Andros instead, nothing changes. In 2019 tryhards are going to expect people to religiously follow the BIS spreadsheet no matter what.
---
Yeah, run a litmus test on who can actually be trusted with dealing with loot distro, or who is most prone to throwing a man child temper tantrum b/c things don't go their way.
---
Then just make sure they never get an ounce of power.
---
before 40, with a 3.5 speed 2h you're going to proc overpower on avg once every 47 sec. With a 2.8 mh and 1.7 oh, you're going to proc overpower every 13 sec.  Something else to consider is an HS every 2.8 sec vs every 3.5 sec.  Unbridled wrath is better with dw, execute is arguably better. Also if you're using same leveled weapons, the white dps decrease from 2h going to dw is only around 10%.
---
You get 16% crit for free from just world buffs 1% hit is infinitely more valuable to a warlock especially in phase 1 before bloodvine is available
---
They are clearing transitioning into that highly profitable mobile shovelware.
---
They want this garbage on your phone so they can gauge what type of mobile devices you use on your phone, and what you use your phone for. Its basically just a spyware campaign to gauge their audience as much as possible.
---
So fuck them. Don't install this garbage on your phone, or use a burner pos phone like an apple iPhone 5.
---
I still stand by that this system should have been changed somehow during vanilla's time and hope they will change it somewhat in classic. Something as simple as no decay past each earned rank would be a good change (imo) so that you keep w/e rank you get - also makes you actually keep your grand marshal title instead of regressing down to 'knight' while wearing rank 14 gear
---
As he explains in the last paragraph, they increased the top end of the system to allow for more people to raise in the standings, meaning you wouldn't be competing as much with your own premade group.
---
So in classic it won't be as insane as he experienced pre 1.8. But don't be mistaken, it still involves no-lifeing with premade for weeks. It just won't punish your whole group if one person falls behind.
---
Yeah I think those getting punished were largely the sellers, who would just reroll/use the next hacked account.
---
Since we get honor system and rewards TWO PHASES before battlegrounds are released, will it be possible to get R14 from world pvp only? Will people be farming HKs constantly in the upper zones?
---
WoW definitely lost that magical feeling with Cataclysm, which is when I bailed out.  The Kung-Fu Panda expansion was a disgrace that should still be an embarrassment to Blizzard.  Came back briefly for WoD and garrisons were amusing for a while, but the game still didn't have the engrossing appeal that it had from Vanilla through WOTLK.  I quit retail again after playing WoD for 2-3 months.
---
The pre-cata years were when WoW was in its prime and it had an ineffable, magical feeling.  After that, it's just not worth playing.
---
That's not possible since those classes do not have a taunt. You are probably thinking of the WotLK version where aggro is based on proximity.
---
Sick burn bro.
---
They were more or less properly budgeted by ilvl but also rarity itself had some play in the budget. The biggest issue as you said was the weights were just kinda off so things looked all over the place in terms of usefulness vs actual stats on the thing. I mean +sta +spi +def plate helm could follow the budget but would still be stupidly poor vs later itemization that got the stats we actually wanted on the pieces. 
---
I think part of the problem is that while there was a proper budget, it's not like they needed to spend the entire budget on every item. That's why you'd have items of the same ilvl with +7 int vs +4 int.
---
No I say the most terrible part about p.servers is not the data but the leadership/server hosts and the skeevy greasy shit that goes on behind the scenes.
---
I know many people who didn't buy gold because it was risky and inconvenient.
---
Tokens are not fine what the fuck are you smokin
---
Uhhh, no. Disagree.
---
Whipvine Cord and Padre's Trousers would be powerful regardless - https://itemization.info/item/18327 &amp; https://itemization.info/item/18386
---
The token is BoA and cannot be traded to other characters or people. Buying one from the Auction House or Blizzard directly is the ONLY way to get one, and once purchased from the auction house you cannot *re-post* it back to the auction house to try to flip it or something.
---
Once it's purchased from Blizzard, it can only be sold on the AH. Once it's purchased from the AH, it can only be used.
---
Have a clear vision for the guild, communicate that vision clearly and avoid recruiting people that don't fit in to that vision.
---
Casual or not, all classes work. Play what you think is more fun, that is going to be what is most suited.
---
Honestly this is the one change i’m really hoping for. I will be very disappointed if classic launches with this honor system intact.
---
Love this mindset! Overall it'll be great, especially when you realize you're not using any of the subscription-based services that you normally would use otherwise and can cancel them entirely.
---
With that said.. I'd reckon those of us with girlfriends/wives will still be asked to go "do things" that we simply just CBA to do.
---
mouth breathing and killing people who cant even put up a fight. 1/10
---
Pet classes are usually good at soloing so hunter or warlock. Also, if it's not immune to slows and freezes mage will eventually kill it. Druid has some solo potential if you fight in the outside world thanks to roots cc and feral/travel form movement speed but's it's whatever compared to the classes I mentioned.
---
nope.
---
Honestly? I think im more excited just returning to a great game with no expire date than the actual game.
---
Our guild back then only started to touch grown on Naxx when TBC was announced and it put a stop to our raiding sadly.
---
There is a lot of content i will try again but i cant wait just taking my time with it, you feel me?
---
Exactly. It's a double edged sword between multiplayer gameplay and lore. It seems little silly that these mythical superoverlords of everything are running around with their welfare epics but canonically that of course doesn't happen. It'd be and was ridiculous that player characters that had bested biggest foes known to man would be put to do some grunt work. I don't remember what expansion they actually started to account for your past canonical achievements, maybe it was cataclysm or mop but from there on the player character basically has kept their fame. It makes sense lorewise.
---
Its because Alliance is the new edgy.
---
found the horde
---
He said he's doing to "get famous" in the video right before he bragged about ninja'ing.
---
He's just run of the mill autistic alliance. Nothing interesting to see here.
---
&gt;You get 16% crit for free from just world buffs 1% hit is infinitely more valuable to a warlock especially in phase 1 before bloodvine is available
---
Ony head is going to have a server cooldown on actual Classic WoW compared to private servers. And if you're the sort of guild who uses a full set of world buffs for MOLTEN CORE then you'll be in a tiny TINY minority of tryhards. 
---
Please try to step outside your super hardcore private server bubble for once and actually consider that 99.9% of people who play WoW Classic aren't going to be someone who factors their itemization choices around having world buffs up 24/7 for every single raid they do.
---
aren't you a real detective, its almost like you knew they would be in lowlevel questing zones. haha
---
Hi, /u/profHam
---
I'm in the same position as you - going to solo a lot because I won't have a lot of time to play. My first character is either going to be druid or warlock. I used to play with them a lot back in the day, and they were both amazing for solo play.
---
I'm not an expert AT ALL, but I'd say warlocks are better at soloing (faster and able to go after stronger mobs). BUT. I'd also say that druids are a lot more fun. I never had trouble getting into dungeons with either character, but I never did raiding in Vanilla, so I can't speak for that.
---
LFG and flying mounts are also fine and by fine I mean hot garbage. Blizzard should have looked for ways to stop gold sellers ( like get rid of free trials for christ fucking sakes it's been 15 years ) not join them!
---
&gt; RP servers got weird
---
PVP servers got toxic
---
and PVE servers were filled with beta cucks
---
Yeah hunter pets have such "shallow" depth. There are hundreds to choose from but even in 1.12 there are only 2-3 that are anywhere near optimal.
---
Either ZG bat, Brokentooth, thunderserpent, or rock some sub-optimal trash like Mazza that looks fly as fuck and gets you all the E-girls
---
Tokens are already in the game. You just have to trade classic gold for retail gold and get the token there.
---
There will be hundreds of people buying themselves into classic this way.
---
But at the same time you'll want to slap Onyxia, Ragnaros, Nefarian, C'thun and Kel'thuzad silly and take their epics, making your character not just a random troll or mage, but a really powerful champion.
---
Because $15 in your blizzard account is pretty damn useless compared to $10 that can be spent anywhere.
---
Exactly how is the gameplay experience harmed by 2hr loot trading and the ability to report player misconduct and gold spammers?  And why in the hell would we need progressive itemization when the game is based on patch 1.12?
---
You're just blindly clinging to a rigid #NOCHANGES philosophy and you can't lose your obsession with the original patch schedule and item progression from 2004-2006.  If you can't quit living in the past and if you're too cheap or poor to pay a measly $15 per month to play the genuine game instead of a free emulator, then stay on private servers and keep jerking off to your old gear &amp; patch progression.
---
theres no advantage to goblin for casters, it's agnostic. gnomish is better for melee due to chicken, but tanaris portal is better for everyone so...
---
optimally, if you didn't care about the transporter, you are best to level gnomish , then swap after you get / make all the patterns to goblin, so you can craft sapper charges. 
---
I do it backwards though and level goblin first, get it's stuff then stay gnomish for the better transporter.
---
Came here to give pretty much the same answe an u/Lanington
---
I saw my once favorite game decline, and was disappointed by every new iteration after TBC, and every other MMO that I tried during that period. Classic encompasses everything I expect in a good MMORPG, and no game has been able to deliver that experience to me, for over a decade now.
---
Spill some oil in the area and wait?
---
I'd have been all for something like this up until they announced that PVP gear will be available in its final form during/potentially before release of BWL. That gear is far too powerful and absolutely needs to remain behind the toughest gating system in the game.
---
When Naxx releases I could support some kind of catch up mechanic potentially, but no way should we be making that gear easier to get with the current progression schedule.
---
Incredible work dude. And to release it as freeware.. even better. You the real mvp
---
i feel you. 
---
got a 1 year old and just told my girlfriend about the idea of me taking vacations for wow. lets see how this will work out. 
---
at least i already had the experience of nerding through classic wow 1.0. lets see if i get to casually enjoy it once more.
---
If you get rank 11 in the PvP system when that stuff rolls out you can get the [Black Battlestrider](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Battlestrider). It takes a bit of PvP but not nearly as much as the rank 14 slog. I got it while doing normal progression content and PvP on the side.
---
I have a feeling these have been replaced with the "starter edition" that came long ago where you can play free up to lvl 20(?) or something.
---
The sub fee keeps a lot of the riff-raff out, and that's good enough for me.
---
Because there never were "mountains of Chinese gold sellers" to begin with.
---
Gold selling wasn't much of an issue in Classic, as income sources were pretty limited to begin with. It only became an issue due to the beginning gold-inflation in mid-late TBC.
---
The private server community is probably the most toxic I've experienced in any game. Hopefully they'll be a minority and flock to the same server that everyone else can actively avoid.
---
The general playerbase who haven't played since 2005 or kept playing retail is quite pleasant, they just don't frequent these forums much.
---
Avoid private server players like the plague and you should be fine.
---
Yeah but I told you why and you just "blame the game." The mechanics of the game making aoe grind possible doesn't mean it's not obnoxious.
---
Rams are the coolest alliance mounts, why would you not want that?
---
My partner and I are thinking about casual duo leveling on a PvE server. She's never played a MMORPG. I've told her about the game and she seems most interested in trying out a Hunter. I've only played a warrior in vanilla or during WotLK. 
---
**This time around I'm considering a Warlock or a Druid. What are your opinions which would be better, more fun, and/or effective when paired with a Hunter?** 
---
I know little about all three of these classes. My initial thoughts are to duo as a druid and then use the Warlock when my partner isn't online. 
---
The main focus will be in the casual leveling experience with some potential to grow into a raiding guild. Neither of us are interested in PvP, but will try it out. I definitely want to raid but I can't say if she'd be willing to invest in the raids.
---
Itemization.info :)
---
What are the best places as horde to put my hearthstone?
---
You are mistaken then. The warlock and paladin would die well before the dps were able to kill the front two bosses and get to the back two.
---
Yeah, I played on Shadowmoon but I was on Alliance and only knew a couple players in Bloodsworn and never kept in contact with any of them.
---
When you are thirsty then it's already too late. You need to drink before you are thirsty
---
Hi, /u/lifemetall
---
Looks dope dude!
---
Is buying gold from hacked or botted accounts better than tokens?
---
Yeah with the term "world pvp" it's kinda expected you're fighting people your own level and there's some skill involved. This is just a video if being a dong
---
Uuuugh, the cringe.
---
Do you have a source for calming that a significant amount of people gave up on the game and are no longer active on this subreddit because of sharding?
---
although i probably will play the same class again (mage) this time around i will play aoe icemage. back then i was arcane/fire, but it was the old skill tree, so i couldnt even play the same if i wanted.
---
It's going to be 95% bots and account sharers.
---
Blizzard is pretty notorious for this where they refuse to listen to the player base even the top .001% of the player base who can mathematically prove they are wrong. I think a lot of it comes down to ego which eventually leads to stuff like bus shock.
---
I never had the chance to play vanilla and was looking at getting into it. When Blizzard releases classic WoW do you think they will keep some of the QoL improvements as well or will it be straight up 1.12.1?
---
Yeah, for example spellweaver’s turban won’t be available, but these items will be as you see them on 1.12
---
Real quick one: Was Naxxramas in classic WoW and then like a version 2 showed up in WotLK or was that raid only in WotLK?
---
New Classic-based private servers are inevitable.  It'll take time but they'll appear.  And with live playable data to mine, they could easily be as accurate as accurate can get.  The question is - can Vanilla players say goodbye to the original Vanilla patch &amp; item progression or are they hopelessly attached to it?
---
&gt; People who want to buy gold are going to buy gold whether it's allowed in the ToS or not
---
There is a big difference between the risk. The majority that *want* to, wont for fear of losing their account. The token takes away all risk.
---
How did they come up with some of these stats initially? It's mind boggling how garbage some of these items were.
---
Yeah, okay.
---
Hakkar server, Alliance warrior by chance?
---
All three of those classes have an easy time leveling, if you wanted to do more 5 mans with your partner then maybe pairing the Druid with the Hunter might make it easier to find groups since you can tank or heal as feral spec'd while leveling.
---
But then how are you going to enjoy the new Diablo experience? :(((
---
A guild without nepotism. Your GUILD is your family. Your direct family members or IRL friends don’t get special privileges. Everyone is on an equal field in a guild. 
---
(Inspired from seeing that one post about the main tank guy who lost thunder fury bindings because GM gave it to his irl rogue buddy first)
---
&gt;You just have to trade classic gold for retail gold
---
That won't happen at any significant scale.
---
Reason being that classic gold is much harder to come by than retail gold, and is one of the two most valueable resources (the ither being Time). So if you are into Classic, you will not part with your gold just to get a token.
---
The problem wasn’t that it was too hard, it’s that the fight didn’t work properly and would wipe you on rng spawn locations that weren’t targetable. 
---
Rng in council fights is manageable, some orders make it harder some easier, but you can adapt. Tentacles you can’t target isnt manageable. 
---
They could put tentacles back into the weakened phases and it’d be killable with today’s game knowledge. But the tentacles spawning that weren’t targetable is impossible.
---
It was poorly worded. I meant that the general "no changes" diehard sentiment of flaming and brigading a post that even dares to suggest an iota of change from the exact down to the pixel and number state of 1.12 seems to have died away and people have become a bit more open to hypotheticals and holding actual discussions with actual arguments for their case as time went on, and I feel like it's because the extremely minor changes, such as temp sharding and loot trading, probably drove a lot of them away as they realized the "no changes" glass had been cracked, even if slightly. Just from my personal experience I've noticed a decline in "everything 100% the same down to the letter or we riot" posts and comments.
---
I presume he may be referring to MCP from the same instance (i.e. Gnomeregan).  The +50% attack speed for 30 sec (x3 per pummeler) is insane for raw tps.
---
It was in both. WotLK naxx was updated a bit, but it was mostly rehashed content. That tier of raiding is seen as one of the easiest, if not the easiest ever.
---
Very true, but if I recall there was actually a nuance to how the game more often than not portrayed your adventures in these situations. Certainly there are moments where it extols your individual efforts, but from my memory, I recall it often regarding you as part of the group of adventurers, not the grand commander.
---
This is really chalked up to it being the start of the story. I mean you *were* part of all the things that followed between expansions so it makes sense your character is considered so highly. I just don't like it how much I'm worshiped by every npc I walk within 100 feet of.
---
Personally I would have liked Blizzard to have kept the player out of commander roles in the stories. Make them a part of the conflict, sure, but not the leader. Once they got started it's like they couldn't stop since it would mean lessening the greatness they've already proclaimed you of. I kind of mark it the same way Blizzard marked giving out the corrupted Ashbringer -- a mistake. I mean in my raid, why is this pleb warrior raid leader telling me what to do? I'm basically the god of the horde if the story is any indication. :)
---
When your toon is over lvl 20 Nope
---
It'd be weird if someone rolled against the hunter for ammo.
---
I budgeted my newly acquired model 3 Tesla with the fact that classic wow will save me a 150 dollars a month dodging activities in order to nerd it up. Wife is not amused
---
People saying "druids aren't brought to raids" either don't remember vanilla or are going off private servers.
---
When a guild doesn't have enough healers for raid or people in general you'll get an invite real quick (as resto)
---
Using your imp to play with enemy agro so they never hit anything is something to try and work on while you're low level.
---
You see you say that
---
I think things will depend on whether battlegrounds are cross-realm. I'd imagine it would be easy to pick out a bot playing 24 hours a day if you were constantly queued with them which would lead to a lot of reports. If it turns out to be cross-realm, then it might work if the anti-bot system doesn't catch them.
---
it boils down to the conversion rate. obv no one will trade 1:1, but its pretty easy to calculate the average income per hour for both classic and retail, so players will grind the same amount of time for gametime. i already know 2 ppl that want to play for free and exchange money.
---
Yeah all (most) aesthetic changes with the game, I’m okay with being in if they are togglable and off by default.
---
Is swapping between tank/heal on the druid as simple as changing gear?
---
&gt;When exactly do you start to feel like a dot master?
---
not sure what you mean by this, but you get your final DoT with siphon life.
---
&gt; Low levels feel more like a wand course then anything. 
---
this is a good thing. wands are overtuned at lower level, doing more dps than you can cast and costing 0 mana. if you want more involved gameplay, you should be pulling at least two mobs at a time -- one voidwalker tanked with dots, the other feared with dots.
---
&gt;Also, was there ever an intended use for searing pain?
---
when the lead class design was asked about the threat, he gave some unsatisfactory answer about it being 'thematic' and also related to pulling off of your pet. it is indeed very important for destruction PvP, even replacing shadowbolt if you invest enough points.
---
come join us at the [Classic Warlock Discord](https://discord.gg/3fvUDqF) if you have any other questions
---
Exactly.  Already made plans with my friends on who we're going to grind up first and we'll round robin until everyone gets the rank they wanted 10-13.  Don't hate the player, hate the game suckas.
---
It's the inevitable outcome of a system that awards based on time spent and not the quality of that time.
---
people get kidney stones from not drinking enough water, plenty of people don't think enough water lol what are you on about
---
Gorblin
---
Didn’t they said it was going to be only $5 a month? I remember reading it was a different subscription a while back.
---
I think druid is a great class for solo play! If you level feral you aren't gear dependent and with all the utility spells like prowl, travel form and self healing I always felt more equipped to do hard solo quest. The reason I prefer over warlock or Hunter is that you can do endgame easier to if you're willing to heal raids to gain some gear but as a hybrid spec, you are still very versatile to do pvp/grinding/tanking dungeons as feral/resto at 60. The added bonus is their survivability in world pvp especially while leveling, you can always choose to disengage in almost any matchup.
---
&gt;feel like a dot master 
---
The moment you learn Immolate, CoA and Corruption and get Voidwalker and learn to multidot (lvl10+).
---
The direct purpose of searing pain is to pull aggro from about to die pet. It has a variety of other uses as well, even as direct damage spell in dungeons at certain levels. 
---
In PvP it is a good quick damage spell to squeeze in.
---
I didn't raid AQ but I think a warlock tank used Searing Pain on Twin Emps. I know in TBC I had to use it in Serpentshrine Cavern for Leotheras.
---
It's a pretty decent pvp filler spell though
---
That's completely untrue. Loads of people have bought gold with tokens but didn't buy illegal gold at all. Hence there's tons of people who don't buy illegal gold but would if given a chance legally.
---
Yeah, Searing Pain wasn't used properly until TBC with the demon phase of Illidan.
---
Because of the locations of horde cities in central Kalimdor and near the northern end of Eastern Kingdoms, Horde don't have easy access to Southern Kalimdor through Mage portals. Because Blackrock Mountain is between Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge, level 60 players intending to run BRD, UBRS, LBRS, MC, and BWL often set their hearthstone at Kargath in the Badlands for easy access to the region. Aside from that, do whatever fits your playstyle and your character's current level.
---
I know opinions cannot be wrong nor right, but this opinion is 100% wrong and bad
---
Didn't the nost staff comply to promote good relations with blizzard?
---
You start to feel like a dot master when you have a voidwalker and max imp corruption.
---
Then you have instant cast corruption and your voidwalker can tank 1-2 mobs and you can fear dot a third.
---
Probably the most fun leveling in the game imo
---
My vacation weeks had to be scheduled this year in February. Going to take 2 personal days though and try to get out of the starting zone asap.
---
It's not simple as that. More like gearing my offspec over someones experimental memespec. Also, my main spec will be elemental, but im willing to heal in raid to get some elemental loot.
---
nope
---
You'd need to AoE kite to take everything down, but any ranged mobs in the mix would likely insta-gib anything they looked at. Even doing something like this in a level 30 instance would likely wipe the group.
---
lol wtf...... people trade all the time. Mage trades water, if you want to picklock, enchant something, or just face or face sell.  There is so much more scenarios where you would trade people..
---
It's okay, OP doesn't have any calories left to burn.
---
Troll post. Do not feed
---
Kinda, healing gear doesn't really exist while you're leveling outside of pieces with a little more int on them for total mana.
---
My guild used a point system to bid on raid epics,the more raids you showed up to and completed the more points you accumulate, I hadn't spent any points so I had the most out of all the priest and there was a priest specific item I needed, I was in a bid war against another priest but i knew he didnt have as many points as me so the Loot master messaged me and said "your the highest bidder" I took that as I won the item and went and looted it off the boss, (Apparently the other person still had points to bid and he just meant I was the highest at that point), so I jumped the gun the whole raid lost their shit on me all the leaders and everything were super pissed goin off in chat at me and I simply said, I have the most most points no one could possible out bid me and that I was sorry since it was an honest mistake, So they reduced my points down to 0 even though I would have had some left over even if the other guy bid all his points, I learned my lesson though, the rest of MC was very aqward no one would chat with me for a couple days and I was suspended from a few raids,only person that had my back was the priest leader who knew Inhad the most points and he stuck up for me but still Felt like garbage but was told I was lucky to still be in the guild, so I'd have to say MC is least favorite raid since that happened  lol
---
Xenif, Troll Rogue was the first person to hit level 60. He was on the stormreaver sever.
---
It was used im AQ for Twins tanking
---
I think the alarmobots in gnomer pulled damn near the entire instance. I could never figure out if it actually did because the first 10 elite packs were impossible to run from.
---
The whole notion of "We can't stop something that is against the rules so we'll just make it legal if you buy it from us" is ridiculous to begin with. Maybe the state should start selling rights to murder? Maybe 100k dollars a pop?
---
Tokens make people buy gold that normally wouldn't have. It completely changes how the economy works. If you want to skip with gold then you'll have to risk losing your account. It's going to stop many and I hope Blizzard will be very strict on the matter.
---
Also something that hasn't been brought up in this thread yet. Tokens would allow you to grind Classic gold in retail. You can buy retail tokens with gold and turn them into blizzard balance which could be used to buy a token in classic that you can sell for classic gold.
---
Nobody's arguing that it's not a dps increase, the argument is how much of a difference it makes. In a big sample size, a simple 1% increase would still secure them their top 20 spots... even though 1% doesn't really change much
---
Screenshots?
---
&gt;but its pretty easy to calculate the average income per hour for both classic and retail, so players will grind the same amount of time for gametime. 
---
That calculation doesn't take into account that classic players are actually USING their gold, not just hoarding it.
---
there's hundreds of places all over the game to buy water.
---
if you want to picklock, roll a rogue.
---
if you want to enchant something, learn enchanting.
---
if you want to sell something, vendors will give you gold for it.
---
Oh you have no idea, there’s so, so much more. I unsubscribed at the very end of MoP and just logged in this week, and I am still reeling from some of these changes.
---
-World scales to you: If you look at most non-starter zones and hover over them on the map, you’ll notice the level range is massive, like 10-60. That’s because as you level mobs and quests will level with you. I really don’t like it because when you level up you don’t feel stronger because everything else levels too. Also does strange things like me going from 90-98 in just the starter zone of WoD, guess I won’t get the story for that xpac then...
---
-Heirloom gear: Everyone else is running around with account-bound gear that automatically matches your stats and levels up with you. It’s powerful gear too so leveling is a faceroll and gear drops are just gonna get vendored until you hit 120
---
-Portals, portals everywhere: Stormwind and Orgrimmar have portal rooms that take you anywhere in the world, or at least nearby. Doesn’t make for immersive gameplay.
---
Talent trees suck: basically this. You will go a ton of levels and never get any new abilities.
---
I googled it.. Jesus, I dont have screenshots of it.
---
1337
---
What a legend.
---
World chat basically replaces Barrens chat !
---
They weren't, but people didn't know it.
---
Blizzard being current blizz, this is a soothing thought.
---
Thanks OP!
---
I actually had a post automodded for it last night lol
---
I'd say before years end. Gonna be a hype e3
---
lol can you even read?
---
I don't play retail, and I see exactly 0 problem with starting zone sharing and raid loot swaps.
---
I get the sense most people did not bother listening to or comprehending the blizz panel.
---
&gt; "uh boss armor values"
---
Some people want an authentic experience not this garbage that they have now. Saying we don't care is moronic. The people that want a private server remake are the ones that don't care.
---
I dunno, I had several friends who spent $100 buying gold in vanilla. They figured a day or two of Taco Bell wages to get epic riding and a suite of BoE auction house loot was more efficient than weeks of farming mobs and dungeons to gear up for MC and BWL.
---
not true, some people were using them in naxx progression.
---
Gonna main, be big bear man, make lotsa friends tanking...
---
THEN HIT 'EM WITH THE MOONKIN, PROFIT!
---
But wow tokens don't fix hyperinflation in any way. They are not a gold sink. And giving new players a legal way of buying gold is not a fix to hyperinflation either.
---
Let me rephrase that:
---
There are no legal, safe and reliable sources to buy gold in Classic.
---
I work 3 weeks on, 3 weeks off - can dump a bunch of vacation time and get a full 9 weeks off straight.
---
There was that demon Hunter boss in the naga raid, too. That was my first time talking a raid boss, ever, and it was on my lock
---
I prefer dkp. Gives that nostalgia vibe and feels good to get a dkp paycheck at the end of a raid you got nothing in especially if there was progression wiping.
---
Can you redo the barrens chat one and just go all out with the design. I feel it deserves more.
---
Jealousy might be the biggest problem i agree. Im going to roll shaman and i love elemental shaman pvp. However im going to raid as a resto to get access for the best elemental gear there is. If guild would recuit elemental shaman for pve and give him loot prio on dps items, i would get mad. Not that im greedy, but that would make me question my self, why even bother to heal, if i can play ele and afk half of the raid while being oom and get all those sweet dps items.
---
Utility is hard to compare aside of damage-empowering group aura-likes or debuffs. The latters are mostly considered not worth it enough provided the lesser damage of the hybrid guy. Anything else is trickier. 
---
And the biggest issue is most of their utility is baseline, no talent requirements and such.  So even as healers they do have the same utility (or in some cases even more, like mana tide totem and resto shaman). 
---
So they're seen as people to carry (and slacking pures don't? Such biased PoV) and gear thieves even if they're given an upgrade once in a blue moon. Not to say the amount of jerks complaining about their selfishness (while not noticing their own).
---
The barrow dens are the hardest caves in the game. 
---
The fargodeep and jangolode layouts are easy enough. 
---
But the barrow dens and the big complex in Felwood are 1-3 person dungeons.
---
I'm convinced this is a troll post, so I've removed it as rule #7.
---
Troll shaman, Rimklove. Khaz'goroth - Oceanic. Moved to Dath Remar when that server opened. Played exclusively Resto during all of vanilla.
---
Sab and Bas. OMG, that's right.
---
Yes. very much Yes.
---
Your post is probably the most absurd suggestion I have read so far about Classic. And yes, that comparison includes the guy who wanted LFR and flying mounts.
---
That makes complete sense to me. 
---
If they ever do a "classic TBC" of some sort, I think Paladin is going to be my jam. But in 1.12 it seems like everything a Paladin can do, a priest is more suited for. 
---
Thanks for the comment. Between all of these I think I'm officially sold on priest.
---
Plus mind control sounds SUPER fun.
---
I’m rolling Druid and I highly recommend it as well for fun solo play as well as getting in groups
---
What pet had fire damage? I've never heard of that one before
---
So... MMO stands for "Single Player Game?"
---
This is the stupidest troll comment I've ever read on Reddit.
---
&gt;When exactly do you start to feel like a dot master? 
---
The moment I wake up on the morning Classic is released.
---
It's actually not *that* bad on private servers. I mean, it's still a horrendous grind, but it's like 25% of what it used to be. The brackets got made bigger at some point in vanilla, meaning more people could move through the ranks and thus do it faster, and private servers have a PvP community that agrees to an unofficial honor cap that nobody violates because you get shunned from the premade scene if you do. This means you can play like 8h/day, or maybe 12h/day with weekends off, and be among the top rankers.
---
it's really not but ok.
---
trading is p2w, sorry if that truth bothers everybody
---
I felt the shift to DoT's over wands around level 24 when I was drain tanking.  Maybe not as efficient as other builds but I liked how fluid it was.
---
The other AHs were added.at some point in Vanilla; you can check if you look back at patch notes to find the exact patch (I don't remember). I'm suspecting we'll have all of them available at launch, even if they technically were released with a later content patch.
---
As of patch 1.9, each capital city has its own Auction House and Auction Houses of the same faction are linked.
---
I liked it the first time, it seemed pretty weak though when I saw it a second time. Must have been the nostalgia bomb, but then the second watch, once you stripped the Warcraft away, it was a b movie.
---
It's basically just gonna be straight up 1.12, which is what most of us are hoping for
---
That is a mistake in the database. Boots of Darkness is an unobtainable item. The only versions of this item we have information about are:
---
1. The [pre-launch version](https://web.archive.org/web/20041112152539/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=7027) which must have been queried from the servers before Blizzard made it so you can't lookup items that have not dropped yet.
---
2. The 1.12.0 version of the item, data mined from the Blizzcon Classic Demo client. In the new versions of WoW since Cataclysm, they started including the full item database inside the client, and that was the case for the demo too.
---
Since we don't know when exactly the updated version was introduced, it was marked as patch 1.12. But it probably was 1.9 as that is when the original spell Id on it was re-used. In the end it doesn't really matter, as Blizzard never added the recipe to craft the item, so you couldn't get it.
---
imo, the biggest issue with pservers is the sorry state that pve servers are often in, im hoping that blizzard official will bring in those players that want pve but dont try to play o private servers.
---
According to the Blizzcon seminar I believe that AHs will not be linked. Not sure which will start in game though.
---
Ah we never made it past Huhu'ran before we decided to focus on getting more Grand Marshal ranks for the guild.
---
What's confusing me is that they're not releasing patches but they're having rollouts / phases. Or are they doing both?
---
I was planning on doing skinning and mining while leveling.  I'll just throw all the mining supplies on a bank alt, and then vendor the leather or AH it if the price is right and use this money to help save for my mounts.  Once I hit 60 I plan on dropping mining and skinning for Engineering and Tailoring. Use my banked mining supplies and saved up cloth to level them up.  Then I'll have the added utility of engineering along with the BoP tailoring gear.
---
Hmm cool, so I have follow up question too. What's the benefit of having Blizzard making ”Classic” when we can just play on private servers. (I’ve recently popped into one and am quite enjoying it)
---
My problem-- or fear, I should say, is that all my work could just be gone the next day 'cause it's technically illegal.
---
Orc is bis for Rogue and you said why. So what is not true here?
---
Well done! So cool!
---
being able to trade or not doesn't distinguish a game between single or multiplayer.  you still need 40 people to raid MC.
---
and for all the things like enchanting, trading does treat them like single player.  you really only need 1 enchanter on a server when you can trade for enchants
---
I played this game exclusively for 6 years in a row. I've spent the years since quiting replaying all the games I missed during that time haha. But yeah absolutely. Now that im older and not interested in playing every new AAA that comes out I can't wait to just have this one amazing adventure to keep me entertained for many more years just like it did before.
---
Suicide Kings is OK, but I think it has a couple issues. 
---
First is that it doesn't incentivize raiding once someone has everything that they want.  i.e. if I have everything from BWL, why would I even show up?  Other people might need stuff, but it requires pure altruism since I will still be at the top even if I don't play.  
---
The other thing is that it can feel a little unfair. For example, if you spend a lot of time raiding at the top without a lot of upgrades dropping for you, you will be reset after the first item you pick up.  While other people can get much more out of the system and be in roughly the same or better position.  With systems like EPGP you decay but you don't get screwed if nothing drops for your class because your ratio will still increase even if you don't get an item.  
---
There are modifications that can help, i.e. you need certain attendance numbers to be able to win against other people, but then it becomes less transparent and more complicated, AND on top of that you still don't have an incentive to do more than the absolute minimum.
---
Having some DPS warriors throw on shields certainly helped, but this fight was a guild breaker because of the 8 tank thing. Many guilds solved the problem by simply devouring the tank roster of another guild, leaving the other guild to flounder and die when all of a sudden tanks were incredibly scarce.
---
It was a rough time.
---
It's starting at 1.12, all major cities will have AH's and all of them will be linked
---
Can you? It's not the "elitists" as you say, who are/should be worried.
---
&gt; Gold isn't hard to farm, I want to pay for my sub with it.
---
You say something like this and don't understand why it'd negatively effect the economy. Ironic. 
---
The more gold is farmed into the economy, the more inflated it gets. Back in vanilla gold wasn't exactly hard to farm but it was tedious. Then again if you already had your enchants and stuff you didn't really need that much gold. There was little point in trying to hoard and accumulate tons of gold so most didn't. If you allowed people to pay their subs with gold suddenly you get tons of people grinding like mad -&gt; extra gold is introduced into circulation -&gt; inflation -&gt; people buy gold to afford more expensive items without having to farm like mad -&gt; token price increases. It's a self-feeding cycle that wouldn't exist if tokens didn't exist.
---
For pve it really doesn’t matter but for pvp gnome is very strong because of escape artist.
---
Yes. Both are bad, and I advocate for neither of them.
---
This is some legitimate professional work my dude.  Serious rush of nostalgia.  Got me hyped for classic to be released.
---
This might be controversial, but I’d like to see you test dual wield fury with a slow main hand, quick offhand weapon. It’s not good in PvP, but I think it might give better kill speed than arms and better sustain. Especially good if sit procs work. Has tons of rage. Might even be ok to keep executing because you get rage really fast.
---
I know everyone says that the higher miss chance is a deal breaker, but I really don’t think it is. I was lurking around some theory crafting discussions and there was some convincing math that showed better white dps as opposed to 2h, dual scales better with AP. Yellow hit chance is the same, but damage is lower because weapon damage is lower and blood thirst isn’t as good as mortal strike. Obviously doesn’t have sweeping strikes, but has enrage, flurry, death wish. Also procs overpower all the time. Might be weaker but is still good rage to damage.
---
When I was a teenager WoW replaced lives for a lot of people of my generation. Even for kids that had perfect households and school lives.
---
4-5 months per phase. The game should last about 2 years before we run out of content.
---
The thing to keep in mind is this will not be like vanilla's requirements back in the day. It may look and feel like vanilla but it's still being run in the modern engine and using Blizzards live cloud services running in the background so while yeah it won't require a liquid cooled i7 and a 1080ti it will need something more than a potato.
---
No. You're a troll, and you're not even trying very hard. It's an MMORPG. By your logic, Dark Souls is an MMO because you can fight bosses with other players.
---
I have no idea what your original post said, since it's deleted, but your comments are some of the dumbest I've ever seen.
---
Relevant flair since you'll be sitting to drink all the time :p
---
Well, some of the private servers don't run so well, for one. They can be beholden to GMs who don't care to moderate the community or who stack the deck in their own favor. The server can be shutdown at a moment's notice. More people will in all likelihood play Classic, too. It's just shaping up to be a more complete experience of the Classic game than any private server.
---
On Pservers pvp always dies after AQ comes out because of how unbalanced it becomes.
---
Because they don't drink despite being thirsty lol.
---
LFG/LFM Lbrs. Need tank and healer. Pst
---
Also gotta eat before you get hungry and sleep before you get tired. thinking.jpg
---
People gave me shit for paying a monthly fee for wow, but what my critics didn't realize is that if they bought only two full priced games per year, they actually spent more money per year in gaming than I did, seeing as I basically didn't play anything else at all for the duration.
---
&gt; for whatever reason private servers failed to include that skill for those Rocs.
---
a good number of mobs were changed with BC release to make them less annoying. Since private servers operate on a BC core there could be some very interesting surprises; stuff that nobody remembered or noticed so it never made it into private server
---
Awesome, thanks for the insight!
---
That's not how it works, you are spouting your uneducated opinion as if it's fact. Majority of people go through out the day being dehydrated and are use to it, drinking 4 litres of water a day is a lot to the average joe.
---
ctrl+r all the way
---
I'm curious why? I'm not making a value judgement on your statement, just purely curious
---
Being a good leader and having a group of people with you to help support the guild. It's a simple answer but in practice it's very complicated. A good GM and guild is super rare
---
Also gotta refill your tank before you have a breakdown
---
No thanks.
---
Ooo i am liking this!
---
Changing balance just changes who is bad and who does top dps, you end up in the same place. We will also know before a patch even goes live just based on numbers what will do what, math isn't unpredictable.
---
Private servers have a tendancy to be shut down at any notice be it financial, corruption, or other legal means. So all of that time you spent leveling to 60, then grinding your prebis or grinding pvp ranks all just goes poof. 
---
With an official Blizzard product there should be the support and benefits that come with a large company behind it as well as the confidence it wont be shit down over night because a corrupt GM stole some items and there was huge dev drama that just shit all over the work you spent on your toon/s.
---
I'm all ok with the meta changing and the class balance shifting. 
---
After Naxxramas.
---
I just wanna experience Vanilla in the purest form. Then, I think it's ok to start experimenting with custom themes. Both sides win.
---
I have noticed the same trend, however I assumed the people had changed their minds rather than abandoning ship
---
Listen it's like this in every game. I am playing final fantasy 14 right now. I play a dps class and a tank. I can stumble my way around while doing dps or just ask in the chat box what to do before boss fights but as a tank or a healer I think you should have some sort of knowledge 9fnrhe fights beforehand. The internet is literally at your finger tips and there is a YouTube video for literally everything in the world. To me, there's no reason you cant look up raid fights before hands. 5 man's you can ask the group or figure it out for most dungeons but for raids. Yes I there should be the requirement to at least have some level of knowledge beforehand.
---
from my understanding the fear with the right click report thing is in people potentially using it to get people autobanned? Though i really really doubt that to be a wide spread issue, its not something i ever experienced in live, unless people are expecting vanilla to be more toxic than live which is... odd to say the least. 
---
In the end its an issue that can literally be resolved by not allowing autobanning to happen. I do recall countless times in vanilla that i wished for an easy way to report people that were just generally being assholes, my 10 year old mind didnt really grasp the ticket system at the time.
---
Yea, it takes us into a new world of discovery for a whole week, before everything turns out the same anyway. 
---
Nope from me.
---
Are YOU xenif??
---
&gt; It's not the "elitists" as you say, who are/should be worried.
---
never said that.   
---
so, once again: lol can you read?
---
&gt;As someone who can not wait classic,
---
If you can't wait for classic, why are you then proposing that we don't get classic at all, but instead a butchered version with fake numbers?
---
I'm mostly excited because I haven't made any online internet friends since FFXI/Vanilla WoW came out. The people I've played with during those games are the people I still play with.
---
With Vanilla coming out, I have another opportunity to create more friendships and relations on my server due to how Vanilla is setup.
---
Druids are fantastic for solo and dungeoning. They have stealth, can heal, can solo elites outdoors due to Entangling Roots and almost never eat or drink while leveling. Also it's extremely easy to find a party as a feral tank.
---
they dont, they have other things to deal with the size of the pop, like ridiculously sped up respawn timers.
---
there is MANY human rogues because of sword specialization racial.
---
The Bonus 5 to sword skills is a big dps increase.
---
Nice video, thanks for sharing
---
Starting the journey
---
But you did. Do you need help or something? It sounds like you might need a professional.
---
I plan on leveling alts and PvPing a lot more, since those require less time commitment. I'm not sure I'll have as much time to raid as when I was younger
---
Please quote where I said that, thanks
---
I just barely missed getting my Rhok'delar 14 years ago, so that will be my goal to finish my hunter quest.
---
I do not want either in the game, but I would be the first to admit that I would buy tokens if they were in the game, but I would never buy from an illegal source.
---
That said, more likely that I would just not play at all if tokens were added.
---
In reading through this thread everyone is using acronyms for different loot systems. Could someone give a brief overview or even just write out the acronym? 
---
* DKP - Dragon Kill Points
---
* GDKP - Guild Dragon Kill Points?
---
* EPGP - Equip Priority Game Points?
---
* SK - No idea
---
Are you kidding? There will be some hardcore guys, but this is fucking retail wow at the end of the day. Sooo many casuals to play and goof around with. Private servers were pretty serious, but think about all the retards and casuals that retail will introduce to classic. You'll be able to play however you like
---
Inherently flawed reasoning. Every spec of every class can still do a little bit of what the others can just like in the past. I would even say class identity is stronger, starting in Legion, than it had ever been before.
---
ehhhh, thats largely debatable, i mean even in wod and bfa wow had a playerbase. thing is theres some people out there that want classic wow, but dont want to deal with currently private servers for what ever reason they might have. those people are likely to stick to classic regardless on how good it actually is.
---
As a mage should I drop tailoring after crafting the robes?  Or is it viable for making money at max level?
---
Or you could, you know, stop trolling, because we all know you're not interested in a discussion here, you're just bored and think you're funny?
---
You're _hilarious_, hun.
---
&gt; do they have to grind exalted  
---
...   
---
&gt; like every other race
---
it's an MMO because there's 1 world with everybody in it.  being able to trade with those people has almost nothing to do with it, it's not like it's a major part of the game that removing trading makes the game literally unplayable, people get by with or without it.
---
would removing dueling destroy WoW?  no.  but dueling is rather harmless, while trading is extremely harmful if you actually look at the effects of it objectively.
---
Not everyone irl is a good person. Want a real community? There has to be people you hate.
---
I preferred it with defense. It was his shaman tank chest.
---
Playing an awesome hybrid and finding out you only put down totem and use r1 chainheal already happened at 60, better for ppl to know it in advance then having to change the fantasy of there character.
---
So you cant quote me because you realized I actually said something different and now you pretend like you wont talk to me because I am trolling.   
---
Ok.
---
It doesn't have to solve them, that's the point. The OP's post is that tokens are no worse than gold sellers, instead complaints/arguments against are largely about gold selling as a whole.
---
edit: by GM I mean game master/dev. PS's are great for a fix but I dont invest too much time in them especially now that Classic is almost here.
---
Thought it would have been a hunter
---
Mind control gets even more fun in TBC in Eye of the Storm by suiciding people off the center bridge.
---
Okay, let's try again:
---
If they f\* up Classic, there will be no playerbase, on the Classic Servers, that will make for an enjoyable experience.
---
No you're just really not worth the clicks to get back to parent comment. We both know what you said. Troll all you want, if it makes you happy.
---
Maybe you could start picketing for a release date /s
---
I just watched some raids on twitch and they did Aq20 and ZG very easily with even a boomy and a ret in the raid. Seemed very casual and they did not even have a full group so I bet during classic anything will go.
---
Well go inside and tell them we sayd to hurry up with that demo
---
&gt; So you cant quote me because you realized I actually said something different and now you pretend like you wont talk to me because I am trolling.
---
&gt; Ok.
---
Most of these people I doubt even form their own opinions. I spent two months playing BFA solidly just to understand why I hate it and it's definitely a major step down from Legion because now everything IS a boring builder/spender. Thematically it cannot be beaten though as that didn't change at all from Legion to now.
---
just found this video created by 14 year old me :)  
---
can't wait for classic
---
Yes, because Blizzard will ban you for it, which deters the majority from doing it.
---
Are you saying you weren't there?  What kind of casual scum are you?
---
these guest passes largely dont work IIRC, you can try talking to a GM about it maybe they will give the time, but ever since the game went free up to level 20 these stopped being useable
---
This is how I used to play on PvE servers.  I'm definitely doing it again in Classic, but I think this time there will be more people playing flagged.
---
My main will still be on a PvP server, but I will have at least one PvE alt, probably on an RP server.
---
&gt; Where is a adventure for players like them?   
---
It's in retail.
---
1ft height vs. 6ft height:  
---
Gnomes are smaller than their hats.
---
Human wins.
---
:-)
---
I get 5 weeks **paid** vacation per year. (In Norway, everyone gets this by law).
---
I am beyond ready!
---
The big downside for me, and why I don't think tokens would work in Classic, is that gold functions in a completely different way between retail and vanilla.
---
In retail, there frankly isn't that much to spend gold on apart from cosmetics. Transmog, mounts, toys, collectibles, BMAH, are the main gold sinks of retail, and none of them have game changing implications. Maybe some slight quality of life, but that's it. Being able to buy gold through tokens only serves to pimp your toon out, and the game already hands out gold like candy for doing even mundane tasks.
---
Classic is another matter entirely, gold is a fairly scarce resource, that has large gameplay implications. Spell ranks, Epic Mount Riding, Talent Respeccing, extremely powerful PvP items like Free Action Potion and Living Action Potion, Epic BOE items off the AH. These are all large boosts to personal character power, that are purchased through gold or grinding. Epic Mount allows you to chase down or run away from other players with slower mounts in WPvP, or beat another player to a scarce gathering node. Epic Riding is one of the most expensive, and biggest achievements, you make in Vanilla WoW. Gold is inherently tied to your character power, so allowing you to buy that gold throws off the power dynamic, inherently changing the way the game is played.
---
&gt; No you're just really not worth the clicks to get back to parent comment. We both know what you said. Troll all you want, if it makes you happy.
---
Now if I could just get my tread mill interfaced into my game. I can run hundreds of miles as I run all over Azeroth without a mount.
---
Let me know when your melee, survival, and spell power hunter gets lvl 60.
---
The last few years i was never able to enjoy games for a long period of time. So like a year ago i tried classic wow on a private server and i have hooked on it for months. I have a fulltime job and a gf but every hour i could spare i would be playing classic wow. 
---
Classic wow just feels really rewarding and fun for me especially if you play on a pvp server. Also back in the day wow was my first ever mmorpg that i played so i also have that nostalgic rush. 
---
I will be taking 2-3 weeks off to play classic wow once it releases. I stopped playing on private servers like 5-6 months ago to not get burned out once classic eventually releases.
---
Content will be locked, but the game as a whole is as it was in 1.12. 
---
Certain raids and associated gear will release over time but we won't be getting patches.
---
&gt;Things like consumable mats or twink gear in particular.
---
Yes, things like consumable mats or twink gear.
---
It's ridiculous how they can get away with giving you that little time off, my mental health would be severely suffering if I was left with not even a week a year to book off. You should make a move to the UK, if you can put up with the trade off of shitty weather then you essentially get a week off of work every other month if you choose to spread them out like that.
---
No they won't this sub is filled with blizzard shills who will fight for blizzard until they die
---
I for one am having a blast leveling a Warrior to 60 while waiting.
---
It's a shame you're missing out on it, for whatever reason.
---
right?!
---
he said something about Euros on his personal video. So we're in the clear here. thank god cause dudes definitely Incel material
---
oh and OP when you read this because we know you will.. I'd recommend not stealing in WoW and real life. Because karma's a bitch and the Universe probably knows when you're being a bad person. so quit that shit
---
I don't think I can get invested in private servers anymore tough, I have played on 3 private servers since ~2006 and all of them have since closed, while I do know that even blizzard servers will close eventually I feel like it will have a longer survivability than private servers seem to have. So I sure hope they succeed with classic.
---
"fun is subjective" okay college kid taking a class on post modernism, this subreddit agrees on 10 million different things and the vast majority dont want to get shit on while leveling. But sure do a galaxy brain meme about how you can't objectively say leveling with rez sickness from 10-60 while naked isn't "fun". You might offend 1 in 25 million players.
---
I raided on a server for 1 year and we never saw it drop once, not even other guilds had. We were pretty sure the loot table was bugged and it was missing.
---
The vasy majority want to play the game with whatever weapon looks cool.
---
How impactful is the troll racial for dps ?
---
The tokens won't stop shit. It will just ruin the economy ten fold compared to what the chinese could ever do. Besides the chinamen would sell gold cheaper than blizzard anyways
---
I break tos because breaking tos gives me advantages. You sound like people who aimbot in shooters, it's scummy as fuck.
---
&gt;I think
---
Cool. No.
---
MoP was a pretty decent expansion actually in comparison to everything past WotLK, much better than WoD, and Pandas were in the Warcraft universe before WoW even launched.

Raids are 40 man, dungeons are 5-15 man, battlegrounds are PVP, world bosses are bosses that spawn out in the world non-instanced and any amount of people can fight them all at once.
---
Sprichst du deutsch? Ich lerne deutsch aber ich spreche es nicht so gut. Deutsch ist eine sehr schöne sprache! :D
---
dude the game runs on a bfa client hahahahahahah shut your mouth
---
Ok, this is really strange. You want to achieve R14 (presumably not by playing prot pally, as no pre-made ***EVER*** would take you), and then you want to use the R14 set for ... TANKING?
---
This truly is a spectacular time to be alive.
---
Glad to see you're back!
---
If it doesn't solve anything, all tokens achieve is making gold buying more widespread since blizzard officially endorse it. I hope you can understand why people have issues with that
---
and?
---
Thanks for this, this guide is amazing. Easily subbed.
---
Pardon? Mages get free food/water so it's spellpower all the way, and that should be mostly true of other classes as well.
---
It's great if you are mixing it with Grand Marshal gear but as a stand alone set it's probably the least impressive of them. It was never really sought after but it's still obviously better than any blue gear. It has decent agi/stam but it also has +spell dmg, like wtf? While tier 1 has that sick 8 piece multishot damage. Tier 2 has the great 8piece PVE debuff. And tier has really high stats.  
---
A famous hunter, Avatar/Serennia, tried to make it work for some time with the AQ sword Kalimdor's Revenge. I was never impressed by his itemization. Still, he was an amazing player who went on to take multiple rank1 titles and play in tournaments. Here is him dueling in his 2.5 setup: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvx1sJyXhBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvx1sJyXhBg)
---
No I wil not quit it id rather die then quit it
---
Holy shit haha. That sounds amazing. Thanks for sharing!
---
The effects of trading are "making the game an MMO." It lets people interact and use their professions for somebody other than themselves. You know. Like EVERY OTHER MMO IN EXISTENCE.
---
There is nothing harmful about it. You're either a terrible troll, or a complete moron. And since everybody here is saying the same thing, gonna say you should just stop talking.
---
Actually, whatever, talk more if you want - I don't know why I said anything to such an obvious troll in the first place. Talk if you like, but life is too short to waste on this idiocy.
---
I remember using a dedicated staff enchanted in + spirit to use during the innervate...
---
Starfire crit was pretty good in my memory (might be wrong or was it in 2.0?) but the crit ratio was too low

How to kill Classic 101
---
Same. Ive always loved the gameplay but never really been able to enjoy it 100% because of the CONSTANT feelings of:
---
1. ..it not feeling like my character or account. As in it doesnt feel legit.
---
2. ..fear of server selling out with P2W systems, server shutting down due to drama/corruption/whatever.
---
Nope, already proven to run even better than 1.12 on a potato, tested by Soupasouka.
---
Those early days of just going into the world and starting fights were the best - felt a big chunk of activity stopped once they introduced all this structured capture the flag playground stuff.  Just isn't my thing.
---
Looking forward to ignoring all BG's and just doing WPvP again.
---
/*the sound of bald eagles and the US Anthem can be heard in the distance*
---
I feel like this will be the most "no patience" game we will have ever played. This game is so heavily documented. Most people will not want to deal with noobs. I will make sure I keep a open mind to people that have never played.
---
Well this won't be vanilla in it's purest form. i'm afraid that time has passed long ago
---
Lmao what?  
---
The point of this set is to turn around and go Reck more faces, not tank.
---
Yeah but the more who know about them, the less money we will make.
---
Am I robbing someone of their hard earned spot they deserve from spending countless hours stomping randoms in WSG?  Couldn't care less.
---
Lets get real, account sharing is no changes.
---
Yeah that makes sense. Incidentally, warrior and rogue were the two classes I leveled to 60 in vanilla. Did warrior first and didn’t have a clue what I was somewhere in the 45-52 range. Once I stopped being completely stupid it wasn’t that much slower than rogue.
---
Then again I also did a lot more dungeons on my warrior compared to my rogue so my warrior definitely had better gear in that level range. Still, probably pretty similar.
---
Yeh cheaters are cheaters, thanks mate.
---
Ya I agree 100%. They have 90% of the solo potential of locks and hunters, with the benefit of being invited extremely easily to dungeons.
---
Turns out the modern wow changes alienated most of the playerbase since it went from 10 million subscribers to around 1m
---
There’ll be thousands of Blizzard apologists ready to argue against my point, I’m sure, but it’s pretty *pathetic* how Blizzard treats Classic enthusiasts. In their eyes, the game will only be used to artificially inflate sub numbers, and nothing else, no other source of revenue (we hope), so they don’t give a shit enough to announce a proper date, a month away from Summer. 
---
They could be doing so much to hype this game up. The industry is keeping an eye out; this has the potential to revolutionize gaming in 2019. We could have Vanilla-themed forums, a Vanilla-dedicated website with the aesthetics of old, quirky commercials with known celebrities, the works. Yet all we get is radio silence and a couple bread crumb blue posts about character count per account. Good grief.
---
This is unreal, amazing work!
---
That's exactly why I said purest POSSIBLE form. Just because changes have occurred doesn't mean we should say fuck it all and transform the game.
---
Nope fuck it all
---
Has anyone mentioned the pay to win mentality? Who wants another game where all you have to do is use real money to get in game currency and use that in game currency to have an advantage over other players... That has to be the biggest change from including tokens. I understand that tokens redistribute wealth, but why would classic players as a whole want wealth to be distributed based on how much USD you can afford to throw at the game? I understand gold sellers will be a thing, but both parties also accept the risk involved with that process instead of having an unlimited “legal” way to buy gold with tokens. Tokens for gold requires less interaction among players affecting the community many players long for. It takes away from senses of accomplishment from players who purchase rather than earn their gold causing. It requires no effort or time invested into the game or characters. The only positive I see is that it allows those who may not be able to afford to pay the subscription fee be able to immerse themselves in a game we all enjoy, but I can’t imagine that this scenario is relevant for many.
---
You sound free of guilt.
---
For the past 6 year , we had to play on unstable private server , lvling multiple time to 60 ,  Just to restart again , because its unstable...
---
This time its real .
---
Which is just weirld. Ban'thok Sash is just as strong as the turban.
---
He was talking to Dhoraks89, regarding his confusingly resentful post.  
---
I try my best to remember that "Hurt people hurt people", and that the people in this world who are the most aggressive are ironically the people who need love and patience the most.   
---
It's not always easy, but I try. Hopefully someone will pay it forward when the time comes that it's me.
---
If you are playing alone a lot, I'd say Warrior is the only class you should think about staying away from. They have very little sustain, and no real escapes besides maybe fear and run away. 
---
Druid is a great solo class. They have perhaps the most versatile tool kit. They can perform any of the three roles in groups while leveling, and at 60 they can solo farm very well and are great healers or tanks in pug dungeons.
---
Light Feather; resell on the AH for Mages.
---
I'll focus on my main. And have a ton of level 1's so I can reserve names.
---
Wow, that “gentlemen’s agreement” shows how great the classic community is.
---
Playing pservers isnt breaking tos, running a pserver is. Playing on a pserver is a grey area at best. There is a big difference when you ACTIVELY take away rewards from other players from cheating. You wanna have an account shared gbank that's not hurting other players, I'm not going to do this but I understand why people do. Account shared ranking actively hinders others.
---
Too many biased points.
---
&gt; why not just contribute to the best of you and your classes ability via the best possible spec.. to get to that moment anyway? 
---
Let me be clear about this one. I know it fisthand. That moment will happen either when nothing already matters anymore (i.e. most people are close-to-full decked and highly coveted pieces start to get disenchanted, usually a couple of tiers later at least...) or,  the most common one, NEVER.  Either by being burnt out (due to being forced to play in a way you dislike  or the game overall) or simply by changes in the roster, adding new blood (and as such more people coveting those items).
---
&gt; look at it this way, no matter what, you have to respec for PvP and PvE, so it doesnt matter what spec it is if you're pvp focused anyway.. and if you're doing it for PvE.. get out of here... you care about PvE but you're willing to be bottom of the barrel DPS and get carried, burdening your raid / guild ? 
---
Look it the other way. Let's take whichever "PvP" hybrid spec you might call. How the hell will you get *any* gear for it if the only gear you're allowed to grab is healing focused? The only real pieces you may get are either the ones overlapping these, the crap noone wants and maybe some tier pieces (depending on class, though...). 
---
On the other hand the whole concept of getting carried is actually the worst, since slacking pure DDs are rarely pointed out on it.  And if you take into account the damage (as in dps)  required for bosses most of them deal *enough* damage to beat them.  So the *getting carried* reasoning tears to pieces. 
---
There's a different approach you miss: fun. Certain people enjoy playing in a certain way. Performance doesn't matter that much for them.
---
&gt; hybrids are just self centered specs played by people who either have no real exp / idea, or are try harding to be successful in a niche spec where your competition is full of the aforementioned people with no exp / idea. it's literally the special Olympics. 
---
Selfishness of one vs selfishness of the "I wanna easy loot" bunch.  Let people play the way they enjoy. 
---
Enforcing a way on them is the worst you can do to them. Carefully coaxing may work but it is not failure proof.  There'll be people who just want their playstyle and won't change it since it's what they enjoy. They're the ones paying subscription so just let them be.
---
Ja genau. Ich komme aus Deutschland und bin daher Muttersprachler. Wieso möchtest du die Sprache lernen? Deine drei Sätze klingen ja schon so als seist du schon weit fortgeschritten :) Viel Erfolg weiterhin!
---
However you want to justify looking down on others man.
---
most profession interaction is as shallow as "craft an item, toss it on the AH" because of trading. truly what the MMO is all about.
---
meanwhile, because trading exists the world will be plagued with goldfarming bots, or blizzard will add wow tokens to combat that and the economy will shift to gold farming for bnet balance.  professions like enchanting and bagmaking are dead because you only need 1.  you see that guy decked out in full enchants like crusader?  yeah, they bought gold and paid the enchanter instead of doing the work to actually level a profession, great potential game system ruined because of trading.
---
though I repeatedly list the reasons trading is bad, all you reply with is "trading good! everybody does it, moron!".  who's the troll here?
---
I may have thought about this once or twice...
---
So I'm kind of in between a troll and an orc for my hunter. I'm leaning orc for stun resist + flavor. Trolls attack speed buff does also seem nice, but how good a 10% buff for 10 seconds? I know it's better at low health, but it's probably more reliable if macro'd with hunters mark or something.
---
Honestly the biggest thing for me is the animations. Does anyone have any preferences regarding this? I was always played Alliance so i never got to see the animations a lot.
---
Please don't hate me, I'm trying to give a constructive opinion to further improve these logos.
---
They are really good, no in fact they are awesome.
---
The thing I would have liked more if SOME font choice, colors, and background image would resemble the theme it represents. Call me picky, but something bothers me when I see onyxia fonts in purple, or DM Background image which doesn't represent the dungeon theme. There are a few more examples like this.
---
I hope you consider my point. Again, it's just my opinion.
---
Great work.
---
When my main hits 60, I'll have 45 other characters between levels 58-60. I'm an altoholic. Speaking of, it'll be the year 2618, and giant ants will rule the earth.
---
405!  I bet though, best of luck to you :)
---
i mained a destro lock during legion, with a warrior on the side. i had a lot of fun with the lock after i got all his traits and got the legendaries that let me be a freakin aoe monster, like a lot of fun, but i definitely feel like it was a step in the wrong direction and if i had to choose between mists lock and legion lock, well.... you know.
---
warrior was just... way way worse compared to mop (i took a break for all of wod) 4/10 i like odyn but would revert to mop or any other expansion in a heartbeat. also yeah i miss mana for casters
---
I have seen like 4-5 clearing Naxx.
---
I mean, worst comes to it you take a week off and say "if you need me, call me" and essentially just be "on call" for a week.
---
I mean you are openly advocating cheating. You deserve to be looked down on.
---
This is complete bullshit.
---
Dude...I am so sorry you live in California.
---
Looks sexy!
---
I want to have at least a 35 mage with tailoring/alchemy to assist in bags for my bank alt and my Druid main herbing/skinning until I pick up eng for pvp
---
Bring the player and not the class is not true for classic. And the majority of raid DPS will be rogue mage and warrior. If retail does anything well, it makes all classes at least decent for PVE.
---
Maybe I'm just hungry, but that looks unbelievably fucking good
---
These are awesome. The hype is real.
---
You know what, I agree.  I’m going to give them a piece of our mind!
---
No clue. It's all hypothetical tho, based on mob details at every level, my expected DPS, regen, stats.
---
My spreadsheet tracks my expected DPS, mana per rotation, rotations needed to kill a mob, thus time to kill, and time to regen, with an eventual 'time to OOM' and then time to recover, and gives an anticipated XPH rating based on all that.
---
Plain Ret leveling is 126:37 based on this math, and I've gotten one-teens on previous runs due to quests, etc that aren't factored in here.
---
I think I can manage sub 100 if I plan it out extensively. Sub 110 being more practical.
---
What an intellectual and well argued response.
---
We went for a trip to San Diego and attempted to see the orc statue but the security people don’t us no. No public access.
---
Which is bull because I pay their salaries, basically I own them. I didn’t argue but I was some frazzled
---
I linked that Hunter for the lolz because he legit had TF in Vanilla, which made me laugh :p But it's an old vid indeed, it's TBC prepatch.
---
&gt; And no, the top .1% aren't always a savages because skill is highly relative, even among the same players 
---
You do realize you just agreed with me there, right ? If everybody's shit at the game, the top 0.1%, in comparison to the average players are savages. If everybody is better at the game, the top 0.1% are still savages ; this is what "relative" skill is about - a relation to those around you.
---
&gt; Comparing the beginning of Vanilla, when everyone had to learn everything, vs the end, after people had years of practice is silly 
---
I'm not comparing anything to your vid, which I couldn't watch for more than 3 minutes because of the quality anyway. I just posted these links as a curiosity as an answer to that guy who posted Trig's movie, which is hardcore and rather unknown. I didn't even post under the main thread. No need to call it "silly" ; it's not what I was doing.
---
They do public tours that you can just sign up for. I think it's relatively small and it's only like once a month. But still, it's a thing.
---
But that's what I hated about it. You were a fire mage. Not just a mage who was better in one school than the other.
---
To each his own I guess... I love it!
---
Oops! That’s what I meant haha. 5 would be up north from there. But thank you!
---
Considering literally everybody here thinks you're a troll, to the point that your post was removed for that very reason? Gonna go with you.
---
Hey, sometimes people steal kills from others. Wanna change the server limit to 1 player each to combat that?
---
I'm officially done responding to you. But you go right on ahead thinking you're more intelligent than everybody else who has played and / or designed the game 🙄
---
I'm in the same boat dude. 30 with no kids and an awesome girlfriend I live with, but she works at a bank (regular hours) and I work at a busy downtown bar (very irregular hours) so I find myself lingering in the city spending money when I get off because, well, its 3am and my girlfriend is asleep at home with work in 4 hours, so what am I rushing home for?
---
World of Fucking Warcraft that's what
---
They fear Classic will be more successful and take resources away from retail.
---
They don't want to know that people have been playing vanilla pservers for over a decade and many more don't play on pservers because of their shadiness.
---
Classic will live very long and prosper.
---
Bullet dodged.  It isn’t often that thots patrol themselves.
---
Just remember, there’s nothing wrong with you, she is a whore.  She’s mad at her dad, not you.
---
Enjoy Azeroth!
---
Hey thanks for the CC.
---
Onyxia is purple hence the purple colour. The background of DM is directly taken from a DM wall texture, and the banner behind it also is a direct asset from that dungeon... so not sure what you mean by these two tbh? Maybe it's the arrangement of those things together that causes the discordance for you.
---
Fourth post with this exact question in 3 days.  Use the search feature bruh
---
And?
---
You could clear it with 10 empty spots,  but that doesnt make it optimal.
---
It's part of knowing people on your server by name alone.
---
It's kinda like how we know all the famous streamers names except that this was the case for popular players on your server.
---
Choosing a good name will actually be an important part of starting your character rather than 'xxrougexx'
---
I was Rank13 in Vanilla and I won't do it again. I'll go for Rank11 at best.
---
These are beautiful! You have such talent!
---
It wasn’t when they unlocked them all after a few patches but the legendary system was god awful. I didn’t get my bis items till like the last 3 remaining legendaries. While it wasn’t “difficult,” I’d still consider that a major flaw and annoyance—that my class felt incomplete for that long after hitting max level with heroic/mythic gear.
---
California state bad
---
I just want to have fun and play around on it. I probably won't be racing to end game content, when I get there I get there. Nothing is new to me (even though I started in BC) so I'm not ansty to see it anyway. It'll be nice to have to play something besides blood elf and seeing the old character models/no transmogs will be really neat.
---
Diablo is very basic but has the best atmosphere, crawling deeper and deeper into hell and it is very horriphic
---
Diablo 1 could be called an horror game, even D2 is doesn't have D1's atmosphere
---
No one knows yet.
---
Level 5 with DE so I can send greens I don’t sell to him for mats. Also use him as a bank alt.
---
I'm really happy about ST. It'll be so fun to go back through the old layout again. I remember spending a LOT of time down there when I was leveling in BC.
---
I quit playing games like two months ago because it all seems like a waste of time since Classic is coming out so soon.
---
Thanks for your reply. Ok What about Kazzak?
---
The theme is so green. Doesn't represent Kazzak nor Blasted land.
---
If anything it reminded me more of lord Kazzak from TBC.
---
I plan on very slowly playing other games side by side with WoW, but only after I've finished level 60, pre-raid BiS, initial gold grind, etc. When I'm comfortably just trading afks and raids, I'll play single player RPGs on my 2nd monitor.
---
I love this, BRD and ST were like this for me! Staying up to ungodly hours just to finish a 5-man.
---
I’ll be done playing pretty much all but the best 1 player experiences. 
---
New Pokémon game for switch.
---
Last of Us 2 
---
All of the games I can’t miss I’ll play. 
---
The rest have no hope. Since I quit wow over 10 years ago I’ve played a bit of everything. Those days are done lol.
---
Dude be the man we all need and walk up in that bitch demanding a release date! Take one for the team!
---
Ahh dkp the infamous system lol. We used to call it Molten Chore because it was so annoying after awhile lol.
---
That is absolute nonsense.
---
There is no law anywhere, that requires ISPs to enforce copyright protection regarding data stored on the hosts they are connecting their customers to.
---
I feel your pain :/ I’ve noticed it’s only for charity and journalists (I believe) that get access.  Also, if you know someone that helps :)
---
This information I'd very important to me and I made a thread about it. Mostly people just said it's not a big deal.   I guess most people dont have 50 people they are trying to put in the same place.
---
Lmfao.
---
This is one of the most juvenile and childish comments I have ever read.
---
Right. #nochanges means the raid content is probably going to be relatively easy. Private servers tune the content to be harder than it is estimated Vanilla was. I remember taking down Ony in Vanilla with a 37 person raid, including me healing with my Retnoob Paladin.
---
Try looking at www.vanillafriends.com
---
You'll have WoW on your primary monitor while playing another RPG on your second monitor?  
---
Jesus.
---
Im a min maxing try hard for not wanting to group with a rogue evasion tanking?
---
Unreal.
---
Not all private servers...
---
Some have blizz like pops.
---
I've always found the issue with private servers to be the lack of client support for modern hardware. I run into so many issues with refresh rate support, resolution, input etc. On top of a point that's been beaten to death but true nonetheless - the fact that armor values, miss chance, mana regen, etc are all 'guesses'. I don't particularly think they're too far off because the game still 'feels' normal. But I think there are going to be a lot of things we never noticed about private servers performing poorly that will come to light when we play on Classic.
---
On live vanilla I used to level alts from 1-15 over and over because I couldn't make up my mind for what class to play for an alt lol. And for whatever reason, I really don't recall shaman, druids, and warlocks going oom after 2 casts at lvl 2 on the live game. This happens on pservers as well as a decently high chance to miss when fighting mobs your own level. Just doesn't seem accurate and part of me thinks that the devs overcompensated the idea that missing, resisting, and parrying were all a part of the game back then. Yes, they were, but they're not THAT extreme if you're fighting your own level.
---
Just my take.
---
Druids are brought to raids in private servers. Those people are simply full of shit.
---
Quality control, server population issues, uncertainty as to whether the server will last or change through admin drama, too much spam, potential for admins to break rules/sell items, ease of cheating with impunity, etc.
---
Just need to avoid the servers where the streamers are gonna play
---
When I joined the sub there were 2 different subreddits and the discussion was between which one to use, lmao.
---
Retail servers and classic servers will also have good buying and selling.
---
Oh crap. Before reading all the comments, I was torn only between warlock and hunter. Now druids are on the table too 🙄
---
Well I only play some Auto Chess on Steam these days, so there is not so much to leave behind.
---
Same.
---
Take it you meant sick? Like VR sickness? If so nah, I've been at it before on private and retail servers and I got a vr treadmill to use with it. Its pretty fun.
---
Lol "intellectual conversation" yeah, because the people in here are doing equations to prove or disprove the Higgs boson, right? Get off your high horse, buddy.
---
You guys are slowly instilling confidence in me to do it ;)
---
No, while TBC was a worthy expansion in her own right it brought the "must have new 10 levels and a seperate continent" approact that Blizzard still hasn't moved away from. 
---
Keep the "World" in WoW, please
---
I have a small stable of games I cycle through and I'll probably continue to do that, the same way I did when I played WoW back in the day.
---
Yeah that seems to be what ill do. 
---
Im running with someone else as well whose playing a warlock not sure what she needs to go.
---
Lord Kazzak resides in a part of Blasted Lands that is grey/dark in colour in vanilla as opposed to the orange of the rest of the zone. The text colour I decided upon because he is a demon and one of his most famous attacks is a cleave which also has a green animation. 
---
Again not really sure what you mean here about making these more representative of the areas/instances - it's just my interpretation... if you want you can change the colours yourself by re-hueing them in any raster graphics program, no problems with that.
---
A Feral off-tank and a Resto or two is highly efficient for a raid. Go watch some "hardcore" raids and count the number of Druids.
---
1.  My alts will have their names saved and ran to SW to become bank alts untill I'm ready.   
---
Also random pro tip.    Bank alts have infinite storage space if u never accept your mail and the return time is instant if u just hit the return button.
---
10-20.  Basically a bank alt.
---
Fair enough.
---
Ditto. Legion to me, since TBC, was the first time WoW felt "right" after Vanilla.
---
It perfectly shows why the system was so bad. PvP is inherently competitive, but the ranking has nothing to do with skill, just a time commitment that almost required account-sharing with someone in China while you sleep (literally all the hwls on my server did this).
---
And in this case before it was changed it ended up removing actual PvP from the table. How prestigious is Rank 14 when you're just running a flag in an empty WSG 18 hrs a day like a level 10 delivery quest?
---
It just needs a better system, one that encourages world PvP (no dhks) and some form of xrealm ranked premade BGs and a daily cap that allows for 8 hours of sleep and 2 hours of hygiene/meals/dialysis
---
Keeping the old system will just continue to leave high ranks as unimpressive. Or not, I guess it'll be a little funny (though sad) to see people ruining their lives for R12+
---
I'm planning on three toons, too. After that I have all kind of ridiculous ideas like leveling a second hunter and a priest just for starshards, so I'm set for at least the next five years.
---
&gt; What's the biggest issue with PServers that has nothing to do with shops or corrupt admins?
---
* The lack of RP and PvE server options with decent populations
---
* The lack of North American hosted servers so I can have a half decent Ping
---
* Servers closing and vanishing erasing your characters at any given moment.
---
* Complete lack of professionalism across the board.
---
THEN comes stuff like cash shops, corrupt admins, bad and inaccurate scripting, pathing and parts of the pop speaking 3 different languages among other things.
---
Blizzard does need to get classic right, but it would have to be an **unmitigated catastrophic failure** to bring PServers back into the conversation.
---
Current simulation tools we have for private servers show a 7% DPS difference for humans and orcs, down to 4% with Edgies (if you have the gold for it). 7% is definitely noticeable and most players won't have Edgies.
---
I did a ton of casual solo druid stuff in vanilla to WoTLK and it was awesome! It's a great class for casual play since there's so much variety to what you can do.
---
Yeah, I hear you on all those. I'd rather still play pserv than not at all, but man, I'm pumped for just quality treatment as a customer from blizzard. They don't usually make the design decisions I love, but I feel valued as their player. And none of the cheating/widespread botting BS.
---
Pservers have a long host of issues:  
---
if they become too popular like Nost, it will be shut down due to defense of trademark.  
---
pay2win, shady donation models, admin abuse, economy messup is normal on many pservers  
---
The servers not being official means they could go down for a myriad of reasons, meaning all your work has a decent chance of vanishing at any time. And you've got nobody to hold accountable. Official servers will always be there, atleast untill blizzard as a whole goes down. (if you are attached to your characters, and the time invested, dont play pservers)
---
I live in Los Angeles it’s not that bad.
---
It actually makes a big difference in tanking, because you're less likely to be parried, which means not only do you make more threat and do more damage, but you take less damage because parries increase the speed of the next attack.
---
I like to remember it's only as much of a commitment as each of us wants it to be, we choose how much time we invest in it
---
Did you even read my original comment? 
---
That's exactly what I wrote....
---
Teeb you're the shit. Also :( that we get bgs in phase 3
---
Haha, love this!
---
There are tho. There is litteraly no reason for an orc warrior to use anything but axes before Naxx.
---
And once gold farmers and bots start spamming the server your opinion will change *real* quick
---
I plan on playing a lot more casual and friendly, I'm aiming to be the "Paladin bro" who's always chill and willing to help out everyone, where as before when I originally started in 2004 I was a super elitist edgy kid who hated anything that wasn't raiding
---
&gt; an unmitigated catastrophic failure
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ion_Hazzikostas
---
now with skinning and a mate for the harder quests. my focus is not the same anymore.
---
From someone outside of the States, how come?
---
I also skipped it on my Shaman and played 30/0/21, even in raids. Just spammed Chain Heal. But it's there if you really want to play full Resto.
---
Ive been twiddling my thumbs for the last 3 months because all I want to do is play classic
---
Beautiful
---
The earliest reference to your character's past deeds I'm aware of was in WotLK. You can overhear some guards gossiping about the scarab lord and the hand of adal joining the battle. Pretty cool ego boost if you had the titles at the time. 
---
It definitely became the norm in Cata though.
---
I quit playing my private server and just play cs go and pubg in the meanwhile
---
Paladin. Horde are the most tank hungry faction.
---
Druids would still be unkillable in 2's without pillars. They would just outrange you instead of running around a pillar. But their Warrior partners would die instantly without any LoS to hide from Mages, Hunters, Warlocks, etc. Healers would cease to exist in 2's. It would turn into double DPS zerg fest. That is way worse than what we actually had.
---
vanilla druid (feral) was great at soling badass stuff like elite devilsaurs in Ungoro.
---
however group content at level is 60 is kinda limited to resto. I used to play like that and I spent a lot of gold on respecs for farming mats to group/raiding.
---
Uh no you raise one obscure example without actually proving yourself correct all to simply throw a comment in and rake karma from autists who apparently have downvoted me about 20 times for my efforts. 
---
If the debuff scales with spell power this is a huge buff.
---
Explain why weapon speed matters when command is a proc per minute and higher spell power leads to higher damage seal of commands?
---
When i joined the sub people communicated via smoke signals.
---
There will be no mmo like wow ever again. If anything it'll be something like Rust or DayZ. Wow is too old fashioned for a new game to be based off of it and still be hugely successful
---
WoW has a lot of moments of down time. I used to play Diablo 2 single player during raids in ICC in Wrath because my guild was immune to doing things quickly.
---
Never said that there aren't any, but you only get like 1 axe per raid tier vs 2-3 swords.
---
When I joined the sub we hadn't yet harnessed the power of fire. Casual.
---
I agree on that point- every spec should have something it excels at. I think a lot of the difficulty with this is the "trash" specs all do have something they're good at, but that specialty is usually worthless in group content. In an MMO, if you specialize in something that doesn't bring anything to a group setting, you're playing the wrong game.
---
But you can't eat while running. Like running from quest mob to quest mob.
---
Because reckoning sucks levelling with no /sit.
---
I classic I had a bunch of level ones when my rogue hit 60. I didn't actually start trying alts until the end of 2005ish, and I never got any above level 35 until TBC lol
---
I figure in classic, I'll probably have some in the 10-20 range by the time I get someone to 60, I'm not planning on more than a few characters. It was end of TBC then Wrath where I became an altaholic.
---
Why would you not /sit?
---
And those ISPs can tell them to fuck right off. What next?
---
...you're saying you would be on your 2nd or 3rd day without hydration and wouldnt feel thirsty?
---
This feels like the straight edge version of "doesn't matter how much I drink I don't get drunk!"
---
What does the players have anything to do with it? In some countries, piracy is legal or the definition is different, so *hosting* a private wow server is completely legal. It matters where it's hosted, not where the players are from.
---
Why are there less hunters on Horde?
---
That looks like some scene out of the trailer or something when he resses him during the fight :D Can't wait
---
Goblin Zapper charge (aoe dmg) + battle chicken (5% attack speed buff for entire group group for 5 min).
---
It gets fun when you get Siphon Life.
---
Ich liebe alle sprachen, so ich will viele sprachen lernen. Ich habe nur ein Semester Deutsch gemacht. Ich übe gerne Deutsch wenn ich kann. Entschuldigung für den Fokus auf sprache statt WoW. Ich siah deutsch und wollte das Sprechen üben.
---
To be fair, even the nerfed version will last you the life of the game as a Druid. The items listed as "better" on Taladril's BiS list don't have armor and therefore don't actually reduce your incoming damage. 
---
I would only ever take off Ring of Protection if I was able to reach the armor cap without it.
---
Right.  Which I'd say is a design flaw if all specs don't bring something to group content.  It's fine to have like certain classes geared to certain roles (e.g. Warrior is primarily a tanking class) but not when you risk people liking a certain class fantasy and then not being able to realize it with the class they want.  That's a flaw IMHO.
---
Now granted Classic being Classic it doesn't matter if it's a flaw or not since that's what it will be, but from a strictly game design perspective, you shouldn't have things the way classic did where you can have for example two specs but one is meant for leveling and not grouping.  Both should bring something valuable to the table in a group setting, in potentially different ways but not to where one isn't accepted.
---
Orange state bad* FTFY
---
Unless you disapprove of technology, quality education, great state parks, great weather, etc., then I think you wouldn't be sorry living there.
---
My guild on a pserver now does loot council (or as we call it, CLC- "corrupt loot council"). Very successful system, obviously the "corrupt" is a joke.
---
The officers do keep track of who gets upgrades and hand them out to be fair, but also have discretion when it comes to rare or particularly niche items (mostly stuff like tank prio for certain items which are also good for dps). And a lot of "pvp" items are just rolled for.
---
This gets in front of issues like dkp hoarding or bid collusion, while still ensuring fair distribution. The guild as a whole increases in power by making sure everyone is getting some sort of useful upgrade when possible.
---
I will /join WorldDefence
---
Good work, I would perhaps change „BG“ for „Battleground“ just because it’s rare to use acronyms for things like this.
---
Making pandas a playable race and basing an entire expansion around them was beyond a joke.  Most likely a symptom of Activision's interference and their idea of soliciting an Asian playerbase.  The playerbase decline was well earned.
---
I personally sleep about 5 hours a night naturally, 3-8. Some people can just do that.
---
Classic won't be the same unless played on a 30lb CRT with a janky VGA port.
---
The best part of Vanilla servers is the beginning when PVP fights are scrappy and everybody is busy 24/7 progressing their characters. 
---
It's not as fun when Naxx is out and half the server is AFK is raidlogging or inactive
---
As someone who took 36 days /played to get to 60 in vanilla, I'm not sure you could possible level slower than me lol
---
Probably like level 6, just enough to get a few decent levels of Rested XP stored up.

Highly considering buying a second ... maybe only a 24" instead to have vertical as a side monitor for chat email and TV streaming.

That's why I never want to have a phone which I can't root. I know, I know: vote with your money and all that, but if I'd live in the States and Blizzcon was very important to me because of friends, then I'd still install the app, and block what can be blocked and feed it wrong information for what can't be blocked. Side note: f\*\*k you Google and phone OEMs for fighting the root community.
---
My company doesn't payout PTO but they also don't cap it. I earn it on an hourly basis. I work 50+ hour weeks ever week, and I'm at like 350 hours of PTO. I just like money more than vacation. I'll probably burn a bit for classic though.
---
Despite being a raider &amp; playing Vanilla, I've never actually done Maraudon before. One of the things I'm looking forward to. I've done the rest of that but somehow missed Maraudon.
---
Tough line to walk, but I wouldn't be upset to see some of the "meme" specs given something to make them worthwhile in groups. Good luck, though, convincing the no-changes crowd *and* having it implemented in a way that doesn't unbalance or homogenize the game.
---
This isn’t entirely true. Although the epic pvp gear will certainly help in your hearing process, every piece is outclassed by other options. Getting those better options over mages and warlocks will be hard though when a fair amount of them have crucial spell hit, but not as hard as you might think as there are better options for some slots for mages and warlocks that have crit which you don’t need as a shadow priest.
---
Can you please organize some kind of "Release Classic already!" demonstration?
---
19 undead rogue twink.
---
One thing to consider as well is the mentality behind those choices. Players who just have to be the top dps are always going to play an Orc or Human. It’s kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. But you are correct it does make an actual difference.
---
Well yeah. The #NoChanges crowd is pretty toxic Anyways.
---
There's not much about retail that's going to be similar to Classic. I can't think of a single zone that hasn't been corrupted by Blizzard's touch.
---
What about agility and wands? What interaction do they have?
---
I get blocking current private server names, but why are they blocking n0st? The server has been dead for years and is part of the history of Classics comeback.
---
Did they change Elwynn at all?
---
Recommended time is about 8 hours so that you can go through all stages of sleep, very, very rarely can people do less in a healthy manner, and we aren't sure if the ones that have that genetic differences actually suffer from it or not
---
Being used to less time is not the same as needing less time, just saying be careful because sleep is huge specially in the long term
---
Horde or alliance and realm time for if you want to raid are the only thing that really matters.
---
Won't work in Classic. It's purely a private server mechanic.
---
The thing is it's not really a big enough deal. Boss armor values are higher on private servers I think and it doesn't really matter.
---
That is true, but the "golden child" and its predecessors didn't and don't
---
Alliance / 8pm-12am PST
---
I just can't help seeing someone from the opposite faction and not wanting to kill them, that hatred between factions makes the game a lot more fun and you don't get the same feeling in PvE server. But i guess if you don't have much time or you're a streamer or something PvE makes more sense.
---
So look for a PST server with a majority alliance Population.
---
75hz...?
---
Hi, /u/Polonium-239
---
This time around I’ll only have several bank alfs and 1-2 35 hunters purely for profession cooldowns.
---
I simply won’t have the time for anything other than one main. 
---
Any time taken away from a main weakens the main in some respect in wow.
---
Proudmoore is a very heavy alliance pve server on PST timezone.
---
as soon as diremaul opens there will be more than enough gold around
---
I've never had the energy for more than 1 mmo at a time. Tried it with SW:G, Warhammer, Age of Conan (lol), and FF14, but they're all similar enough that I just end up picking the highest quality game, or they just turned out to be awful (AoC.) For Classic vs BFA, that's pretty easy. I don't enjoy BFA as it is... 8.2 adds enough that I may enjoy it for a week, but it doesn't fix the classes so outside of that, I don't care about it. They've already confirmed nothing will happen to the class issues until the next expansion...so as far as MMOs go, Classic is the only one on the table for at least the next year.
---
As for other games... for the first month or two, sure, I'll be playing too much classic to really care about other games. But even though I hope I'll become as addicted as I was almost 15 years ago, I know that is rather unlikely. Plus, the rate at which I consume the content will be even higher. So I doubt Classic will make me leave every other game behind for an extended period. I'll play The Outer Worlds, Pokemon, Biomutant, Ghost of Tsushima, etc.
---
Yeah, I feel I am in that small group. I actively feel worse after sleeping 8+ hours. I appreciate your response, but I've done a ton of research on it. It's crazy how the more you research it the more you realize we don't understand sleep at all.
---
My stomach dropped when they announced they were leaving artifact weapons behind.   
---
Easily the stupidest thing they've done.
---
Ironically, you'd have to get past the guards.
---
Looks like it might be EU-Eredar
---
You can see "Shadowsgirl of the Jungle" in the guild "Ey Mann wo is mein Mount"
---
This is the current state of that character: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/eredar/Shadowsgirl
---
You're going to need to cross your fingers and hope for the best.
---
Did you run Sunwell? It was the hardest tuned raid since vanilla Naxx. Saying you could bring 4 mages instead of 4 locks isn't quite as bad as saying 4 boomkins could replace 4 mages in naxx, but it's close. 
---
Mages were in really sad shape. They were the 26th character in the raid, used to buff AI then sit outside. Unless you had 3 sets of Glaives, you were not getting past Brutallus with tons of mages.
---
You can probably get a better "of the eagle" belt than that lol
---
Crank everyhting to ultra and go.
---
If you are looking for a higher refresh rate there are other options but you are looking to usually double the price of the monitor.
---
Pservers do have invisible walls where players phase in and out from, though. One that comes to mind is by the meeting stone for Uldaman. That isn't sharding, but it is some weird undesirable server load balancing.
---
I played on a pve server back in the days and i loved it. Will probably do it again on classic. My spare time is limited and i want to be able to do my thing with out anyone bothering me. Will maybe make an alt on a pvp server to check it out.
---
What is a private server mechanic? I’ve never played on a private server
---
great argument
---
Really depends on the card you have I suppose.
---
Fuckin' people these days. Don't even have an encyclopedia full of sources for every comment they make.. Tsk tsk
---
Casual or for glory?
---
All you need to do is spend 1 minute in Org to see the clown show it has become.
---
How can you get anything from something not released yet?
---
If I'm dueling someone and they use a pot or any cheese engineering items, they're a try-hard neckbeard, and they've brought great shame to their family.
---
If a natural red uses a pot, or any cheese engineering items, it's expected and encouraged. All is fair in love and war.
---
Weren't the blizzcon items and collector's edition items codes you had to enter into an NPC in the game? I remember the one in Ironforge.
---
If the code is already redeemed then it won't work, but if it's never been redeemed it might just work.
---
I don't have any of those (just missed the boat on the classic CE), but I'd be okay with blizzard allowing people to copy their CE/Blizzcon items from their live account to a classic account on their same battle.net account.
---
1 Main (Paladin), 4-5 Bank Alts at around level 10, and probably 1 Twink (Mage) between 25-35 for profession cool downs and/or pvp
---
To be fair, he is right with his oneliner though, but it depends on if you buy stupid shit for consumption, or you invest. 20 years ago some dude in my town had built and ran a small grocery shop. Fast forward to now, he owns a bunch of property in my town, has a steady reliable stream of income from it, and now can retire comfortably. Unlike most other pensioners that see their retirements slowly evaporate.
---
In duels, yes, in WPvP, meh, it's the other faction scum that you're killing so your friends won't care and the enemies' opinion of you doesn't matter.
---
It was not yet normalized in vanilla.
---
None.
---
One of the best parts of classic is the new friends you will make playing it.
---
Terrific choice of name there, I've got a mage knocking around level 20ish named Lateralus &amp; my once beloved main hunter Jambi. 
---
I'll be off to rock gently in a corner and mutter to myself until the next album release.
---
Also to quote OP
---
&gt;Any recommendations on one that won’t break the bank too much?
---
You won't get much better bang for the buck and you're right -- its entirely dependent on your situation.  Unless you have the cash to drop a 1080ti or beyond, why are you spending all that extra cash on the monitor when you should be spending it to upgrade core components to your build?  
---
And if you do have the cash for a high end GPU and CPU, you woulnd't be looking for a economical middle ground.
---
Oh snap, I had no idea, but it makes obvious sense. Lesson learned for trusting second hand info on this sub. 
---
I still think the main point stands though, it’s strange to assume we have to accept gold selling/buying in a form, sanctioned or not. It only serves to make the barrier for entry that much higher for new people and casual players
---
Trump sleeps like 4 and is able to troll twitter all day just fine.
---
Nothing to argue about. Cya
---
best loot system in my book is gold bid system. (everyone can bid any amount of gold on an item 
---
and the pot gets shared with the raid at the end) this way everyone participating has the chance to get an item (or get some amount of gold). so the more you raid the richer you become so you can finally buy something. 
---
its a self adjusting dkp like system that also rewards active players that can farm outside of raids. and it allows for flexible raidslots (with randoms for example)
---
Got a source for that?
---
Troll hunter is the best for PVE. Most of the good hunter weapons are bows, and the troll bonus helps a lot. Plus their animations are way better!
---
engineering is mostly for pvp
---
Cost of living is rough for alot; my personal reason is the traffic
---
Good at flag defense in AB too
---
as long as gold cant be transferred from a BfA character to  classic character, ther shouldnt be a problem.  no one is going to be able to build up the 120k+ gold needed to buy a token on a classic server.  and putting a token on the classic AH will be a waste, as no one will be able to pay what they can on a BfA character.
---
How do you level your shamans? Enhancement all the way, or respec to ele?
---
Ye - I hate those red traffic lights too :-/
---
Pretty much. I love me some PvP server action. Even if I am getting ganked and it sucks, I just look forward to the future when I'm 60 and gearing up - looking for Johnny Awesome that ganked me when I was 20 levels younger than him.
---
Then I will find him and kill him until he is DEAD.
---
Hehe dont hold your breath on that one. 
---
In the meantime you could try listening to the band "Soen" its probably the closest I've heard to Tool and an amazing band in it's own right.  Will take a few listens to appreciate them though just like a Tool album.
---
How do you paint them?  Oil and canvas?
---
I hope so. I want it to be when the kids go back to school.
---
Atlas Loot has a qjest list for each dungeon and where the quest giver is.
---
Nah most of the BiS are Crossbows which aren't effected by bow spec. There is only a span of time before AQ where you'll probably be using a bow for BiS.
---
Doesn't sp ret not use seal of command? Pretty sure you get more damage off of using the other one because it proccs shadow oil and shit
---
The salt is overflowing
---
I may (or may not have) just started on a Pserver a few days ago....
---
I’m wondering why I never tried it sooner...
---
no tailoring as warlock ? are you sure about that ?
---
Is affliction better for leveling than demonology?
---
So, is the chicken's usefulness split along the melee/ranged line, or along the physical/caster line? In other words, do hunters like chickeenz?
---
If I was to double dip, I might keep Gnomish as well. The transporter just seems so much more appealing. Maybe silly, but the exclusive thing I most want from Goblin Eng is the Goblin Mining Helmet (which you don't really need since the enchant can take you to Mining 305 anyway).
---
Yeah that's true. I really hope we get away from this mentality on Classic, I have a feeling we won't though =/
---
With no beta yet it would be odd to have a summer release.
---
Sk is Suicide Kings
---
Mage is the premier AOE farming class. They don't need their profs to make money, though bags and a few rare recopies can net a decent profit on the side.
---
Keep tailoring for the bloodvine set bonus even once you've crafted your Robes of the Archmage.
---
Surely by the time you have the gear to make this viable this sword is obsolete?
---
Even those who still plan on going, we can at least express our disappointment and concern over this!  :D
---
On one hand:
---
I like pvp, world pvp is fun, and I prefer pvp rule sets.
---
On the other hand: 
---
Ending up on a lopsided pvp server is one of the most frustrating things that can happen, and often ends in never having any fun doing world pvp and often having to spend a ton more time doing anything at all due to corpse camping.
---
So I haven't decided for sure yet, but I'm leaning toward pvp and just hoping that I strike gold with a balanced server.
---
We just have to have faith that blizzard is mindful of this and have it under consideration when classic starts.
---
I got my 24 1080p for 160$ so they're definetly good deals out there.
---
If you're going for 27inch+ then itll get a bit pricey.
---
Very differently. I didn't get past level 20 in vanilla haha.
---
If you say so.
---
there is no need for an XP toggle, since there is nothing stopping you from doing every quest in the game, whether they are 'grey' or not.
---
Imagining, nothing’s changed.
---
Hey Reiker0,
---
Thanks for listening to the chat. You make some great points and as far as not going deeper into EQ goes, I would have loved to if time had permitted! Sorry it didn’t scratch that EQ itch for you as much as you would have liked, hopefully you enjoyed the other parts of the chat too though :) - Josh
---
There's a benefit
---
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women! Augh!
---
I also forgot the whole "selling your info" thing.  I don't know what they can collect as far as personal info goes with their program and I feel much safer having Blizzard have that info than some random group of people in Russia (Even if I'm signed up via a "dummy" email account).
---
Also ping since none of the servers are in the US.
---
Why would ISPs tell Blizzard to fuck off to defend some shitty Russian private server?
---
I know it’s horrible but my grandma is gonna die the week of classic and I’m gonna have to use my sick and vacation hours to get over it , may god have mercy on me
---
im about 90% sure that i would literally go insane if i played how i played  when i was 10. A piss poor melee hunter with an obsession with running ZF and SM. there was a reason why i never hit level cap despite playing since launch.
---
started out on pvp back then (patch 1.9 or 1.10 I think).
---
All I noticed on the world pvp part was ganking and camping from higher levels and some messy fightings in front of dungeons or raids . So 100% just annoying and not enjoyable. 
---
The best encounters with the opposite faction were when they out of nowhere helped you out or returned the favor when I helped them.
---
I‘ll wait for bgs for my pvp fix and stick to pve realms, probably an rp pve one to see what they are like.
---
Since blizzard is planning on start zone sharding, I expect not too many servers at start anyway, this should result in a decent population on all of them.
---
And we don't know what version of these items we're getting yet, right?
---
About professions: So engineering is 100% needed for pvp, and since the only thing we will have is world pvp for several months and leveling will definitely involve a lot of pvp, should I start with engi right off the bat and craft items to use while leveling up?
---
I'm gonna be leveling up a mage and I want to end up with Engi/Tailoring, but I'm not sure if I should do engi+mining first, or if tailoring is important while leveling so tailoring + gathering profession, or even 2 gathering professions for gold and switch at 60?
---
There are no realm names or even a number announced. How do you propose a poll like that would work?
---
*Fortunate son
---
It's been this way since we hit, I'd say 30k subs.
---
Well that sounds fun haha
---
I know I’m late to this thread but as a 13 / 14 year old kid I used to stare at this in bed prior to sleep dreaming of becoming powerful to fight dragons. Damn that game really was the thing of dreams. 
---
Now kids have fortnight. Not even close to the feels you get of vanilla!
---
These look great! Although if I were being pedantic I’d tidy up on the kerning of some then, eg. Alterac
---
I don’t think so.
---
Time to move to Norway
---
Who gives a fuck
---
This idiot is just jumping on the DAE hate retail bandwagon, man. Probably got declined for a +3 dungeon and decided Vanilla was better cause there he'd be loved by everyone for some reason.  
---
It's also really funny seeing him throw out tons of misinformation and just claiming "This dude simply knows better than you". r/iamverysmart is just around the corner, my friend :)
---
Since you don't have much time. (more or less than 10 hours/week) pvp will be pretty hard to rank up. I'd say your maximum rank will be around 10 if you go for ranks. Since you lose 20%honor each week. In my opinion pvp needs more commitment if you want higher ranks than raiding. 😊
---
Raiding until AQ40 seems more possible with around 10 hours playtime a week.
---
It has the one lowest state rank for general education, unless you’re talking about universities.
---
Shut up David
---
I do say so.
---
You sound like a 3 year old.
---
yah  Ifeel like i have to finish a few stones before quitting rs completely for vanilla.
---
If someone lands an iron grenade on me to cancel a spell, +10% respect
---
I’m not sure, that’s why i asked.
---
I never really understood why it was looked down upon. Whats the point of being an engineer or alchemist if not to use your profession. If that's the case you better not have enchants on your gear or heaven forbid use any crafted gear. Screw that! When i come at you i'll be giving you everything i got without mercy and I expect that favor returned.
---
Just kite them whilst screaming at the bosses
---
/cry
---
The zone is pretty much the same I think, moves are moved around a bit. Northshire aby is changed though. That shit on fire
---
Blizzard forums of any type are usually like this.
---
Not sure where you read/heard that, but Blizzard has always been saying that it'll be a shared subscription. I.e.: the same price. Though I'd be really happy if the sub would only be 5$ when playing just Classic, as I've got no interest in retail, assuming if the quality of Classic won't suffer. But I bet the quality would suffer, because Blizzard has never increased the subscription to match inflation, and it was exactly attributed to all the cost saving measures they've taken over the years.
---
Let's say you're so hardcore that you do clear MC and Ony - is there ever a gearing reason to back-track into DM? Is it a dungeon that just gives levellers an extra gear boost towards max level?
---
Dueling sure.
---
BG's or World PvP use what you can to win.
---
All that matters to Activsion executives is if they make more money off tokens and cash shop pets/mounts than how many players will quit the game.
---
Expensive as all hell, wages are higher yes but not enough to account for the cost of living. At least near cities.
---
ok as someone who has played vanilla and spent a lot of time recently in private servers... I finally gonna ask: Whats up with the hit(etc) caps? Never knew what it was
---
The point is to make as much money as possible.
---
Wow tokens are in.
---
Buyable mounts will be in.
---
Get over it now so you can focus on nostalgia at launch.
---
its a concern for sure but we dont even have a release date yet. i doubt even blizzard knows at this point if they are gonna do anything with WoW shop/tokens. i mean, they would have to be beyond retarded to put in a cash shop. they have to know what kind of backlash that would have.
---
I'll still likely play other games like Path of Exile or Killing Floor 2, but just much much less.
---
Wait, it's got charges? I never got the item in vanilla, can you replenish those with repair or do you need to get a new pummeler?
---
Some people are starving themselves for a release date, so..
---
Completely disagree. I've mained a druid since BC and have never felt like I'm not a hybrid or a full-druid. As a resto, I can still CC and use bear/cat to my advantage. The only thing I don't like is that you actively lose spells I'd you don't specialise in your talents (e.g. If I'm resto I don't have iron fur unless I spec guardian) but that really doesn't bother me too much, your main spec is always stronger, you're never equally a hybrid in everything.
---
I could make this, but the problem is I don't have the classic game client to test it on. I don't want to make it in modern wow because I figure it won't be transferable. And a private server's classic client is gonna be different from blizzard's
---
Also 60.
---
I plan on doing anything solo and money grinding on my rogue, while my shaman will be played for PvP and PvE content.
---
WOW. Thats gorgeous.
---
I really love your paint style!
---
Twink Items (19,29 &amp; 39 bracket) and elemental earth/fire.
---
Maybe there’s a gear threshold before this is the case, I feel like my void cannot tank for very long when it gets 2+ 
---
Plus fear mechanics spook me when more mobs get aggro
---
http://www.wow-pro.com/dungeon_and_raid_guides/dungeon_guides
---
You have been reported to the society for equal heights
---
Can you elaborate more?
---
Shadowmeld mind control though....
---
These are god damn amazing!
---
I didn’t see the Blizzard sign at first and thought it had something to do with “Alt on” like... its time to level some alts!
---
You'll have to play the waiting game like everyone else, unfortunately.
---
Maybe it’s a gear issue, it just seems like damage is so slow, and dots expire long before the mob is close to dying.
---
That’s the spirit
---
What is better depends on your playstyle imo. I, for example, loved being able to bring back my pet almost instantly. Saved my ass even in dungeons sometimes. But was it better than go for affliction early on ? So, whatever you liked better, imo, is better.
---
Thank you for the insight, maybe I’ll check out the discord sometime.
---
"I've only fought back Sargeras, the literal Satan of WoW, felled gods, demi-gods, ultra powerful elemental lords and I'm a commander of my faction but JESUS CAN I JUST NOT BE SPECIAL!?!"
---
Do you realize how stupid you sound? It's almost like, by completing these herculean feats of strength, you aren't just a "Nobody" if you wanna remain a nobody? Stay at level 1
---
defamp and melderon have some incredibly in-depth videos regarding shaman leveling. They look at every spec and a variety of weapons. Would recommend you check it out
---
I didn’t do much AQ back in Vanilla, but that would make sense on SSC.
---
Classic wow is more addicting though
---
This sub pretty much serves as an example why small enclosed communities are much better than big anonymous ones
---
Take it up with Lord Vetinari if you must :)
---
So many sufficient talents help make the switch?  I’m only 20 on a classic server and I feel like my wand isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
---
&gt; I agree on that point- every spec should have something it excels at. 
---
Boy then you aren't gonna like classic because some specs are literal god damn trash that NO ONE will bring you to stuff.
---
I come on forums for information and rational discussion. Don’t get emotionally attached to an internet communication medium.
---
What is it that you consider worthy of being a 31 point talent?
---
Yeah, that’s what I’m waiting on.
---
I Will be playing on a PVP server because i enjoy killing and being killed by the enemy faction. I feel like it adds an extra layer to the game especially in a zone that is more aimed towards the other faction.   
---
It's definitely noticeable. On a PvE server you can go about your business and never be bothered by anyone. On a PvP server you have to always be on guard for the opposite faction. sometimes when going to a new zone you walking into a giant war and its chaos everywhere. To me, its alot of fun.   
---
There is a major downside to a PvP server tho and that's faction balance. Severs that are 80% horde/Alliance generally make it impossible for the other faction to lvl/quest/farm/raid. Battlegrounds become less frequent and it just ruins the gameplay entirely. If you can get like a good 50/50 or 60/40 ratios tho you will be golden.
---
That was my impression
---
It's something that only works on private servers. It did not work in actual vanilla 1.12. It won't work in classic.
---
In fact it's the opposite, the EU has data neutrality rules and enforce them. Blizzard could conceivably seize some domain names, though, or get them blocked in some places.
---
What happens if you have all your BiS that MC drop but still do MC runs? If you reach the top of the ladder and a piece for your class drops you wont need or want it. Do you just hover at the top till BWL?
---
I recommend a RP realm. There's minimal sharding with them, and I've really enjoyed it myself.
---
Hi, /u/Ultra-Supreme
---
As a spelladin you want a fast weapon and use seal of righteousness. You will use shadow oil which has a flat proc rate, so faster the weapon and more SP the better. 
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-phase-1-new-meta here is an example
---
&gt;data neutrality rules
---
I'm not sure if you understand what the EU data neutrality laws entail, so let me educate you: These laws state that Internet Service Providers cannot give connection precedence to certain services over others. For example, Netflix cannot buy better connectivity for their service by payng the ISPs.
---
These laws have absolutely NOTHING to do with copyright protection.
---
I’m leaving my long-time favorite WOTLK private server. I’m making a bunch of gold and giving it out to new players. Basically running my leveling route with the class I will use for Classic but 7x XP.
---
There were a few pug raids back in WotLK. I don't remember ninjalooting being a big problem there.
---
(Wiping was a big problem tho)
---
It doesn't need to be well argued and intellectual.  There were gold farmers in all the good farming spots in Vanilla.  You could watch them run into DM at all hours of the day.  You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
It was always like this.
---
I saw a video on YouTube by Kargoz, who theorycrafts leveling to a T and he suggested a hybrid of elemental talents up to clearcasting. "Fishing" for procs with rank one shocks and LBs, and using an enhancement type of gameplay with earthbind kiting. 
---
At 40 changing to ele is cool for the Elemental Mastery, or you might want a hybrid of Flurry and Elemental Devastation.
---
Hope this helps
---
It says it's his for prot until aq lol. This is my first time seeing this site I wonder how accurate it is.
---
You send your imp to fireball, cast dots and run away a little, then wand should be enough to get agro back and kill them without getting hit.
---
Let me start by saying I don’t mean ALL of the private server crowd, nor do I mean to imply the majority of them, but I’ve definitely noticed a certain population of elitists on the classic discord’s, subreddits, and streams (it’s really cringe on twitch sometimes as a returning vanilla player to see a streamer make a comment about how the community needs to be open to both returning and new players and then go out of there way 2 minutes later to shit on them.
---
But that’s a minority of the population. You’ll be totally fine because most people are going to be brand new to vanilla or won’t have played it since before BC launched :)
---
well, school does indeed start around the first week of september,  but  I won't mind too much if the game releases that late.  I am not 20 anymore and the days that I enjoyed playing a video game all day long are gone.
---
Netflix would have a word with you
---
Know that from the retail client you can directly buy tokens (from character screen if your sub has expired) and sub/game time from the shop.
---
Have you considered you could do the same from the Classic client? That would a very good reason for leaving those files.
---
I think trump is a good way to prove my point 😂
---
&gt; Also, was there ever an intended use for searing pain? 
---
I do not know about intended uses, but I have used it to pull aggro off of healer friends when the mob is fear immune before. One of the things I like about the old class design is that even seemingly useless spells had niche, edge-case uses that felt so good when you identified them in the moment.
---
Rose tinted glasses btw
---
Yeah sleep is very weird and easily influenciable. I'd check up on a doc just in case before classic hits, cutting sleep can take years of our life. I wish I was in that group 😂
---
Did some quick testing.  
---
*Fury Dual Wield - 20 kills (only 1 less than arms)*  
---
Fury is definitely ok at this level. You do get a lot more OP procs which make it fun to play, but your OP does a lot less damage (1h and no crit talent yet). Multiple mobs are annoying without sweeping strikes, cleave and WW aren't good enough to stop you taking lots of damage.  
---
*Arms 1h/Shield - 16 kills*  
---
I thought this might be ok but it's pretty bad. Shield is about 15% more damage reduction but clearly that doesn't cover the dps loss.  
---
*Shield Slam Prot 1h/shield - 13 kills*  
---
Lol thought I would test this out to see what likely the worst spec in the game is. You get no rage and your abilities do terrible damage for the rage you do spend. Would not recommend.
---
I live right next to a huge beautiful bike trail, about thirty miles along the river. I plan on hitting a hundred miles cumulative in my least seven days at all times. If I eve slip I have to get back up to hundred before I allow myself to play.
---
Bro I just lost a super expensive custom made gold necklace at the bar two nights ago I woke up thinking “please come quickly classic WoW and help me from destroying my life and wallet.”
---
Because people are sick of having to explain the same shit over and over.
---
Why not balance classes/specs?
---
Should blizz add WoW tokens?
---
What happens after Naxx?
---
etc etc.

Lmao I'm saving every bit of wow experience for the game dude. I want it to be magical
---
You shall have my sword.
---
I haven't considered that, that is good to know. I am optimistic that blizzard won't be adding this in Classic and that Ion has our backs, but the news gave me such a gut reaction that I felt obliged to make a post.
---
That makes sense, good insight.
---
When did they ever confirm they're even doing a beta? They didn't. 
---
They have also maintained that it will be a summer release, since they announced it. They also re-affirmed it as recently as around a month ago. So how would it be odd?
---
Technically yeah, it could be released in September because summer technically ends near the end of September. So OP of this thread could definitely be right.  
---
A beta is just hear-say though.
---
Lul. Activision is doing a shit job of making as much money as possible from Classic.
---
While I didn't like mop either , the whole panda thing def dates back to wc3 and I don't think has any basis on attracting an asian playerbase.   
---
IMO cata was the downfall of world of warcraft and every expansion after that was pretty bad except for legion which was so different from anything they ever created it was kind of fun but it wasn't wow to me.
---
I'm not the initial guy you responded to! I have no intention of altering sleep habits for a video game, lol. Maybe the first couple days but not beyond that.
---
Imagine the few other people who probably had to leave the raid group because the raid only had maybe 6, must be bad.
---
I lived in CA for the first 32 years of my life. Great weather, but that’s it. Most places have been run down, and infrastructure is terrible. I have been in Texas now ever since my tour in Korea, and I couldn’t be happier.

---
It will definitely be a summer release, but summer ends in the second half of September.
---
Says you.
---
Release will be popping and profitable. The difficulty in gold farming will make wow tokens go through the roof.
---
So many hardcore players will be coming as casuals with different and more demanding lives.
---
Crafting professions are a colossal waste of gold. It’s better to stick with gathering proffs while leveling so that you can afford your mount, skills, and maybe some nice items. And then at 60 you can always switch.
---
Honestly I'm wondering how many people here have actually played a Pserver lately, because 98% of the criticisms here simply don't apply to the one I play.  Not saying it's perfect, but it's pretty damn close.
---
Wait so you're going back to vanilla which is way slower than retail that you presumably play, and you want it to be even slower? Trust me man it's gonna take you a while to get to 60 and a long time to get geared for raids and ranked up in PVP. I wouldn't worry about it
---
&gt;It doesn't need to be well argued and intellectual.
---
No, you are quote right. Primitive and made up is enough for some people.
---
Me not among them, but I am sure you will do just fine.
---
Personally i prefer TN just because there's so little glare on them, and good for gaming, but it's really down to personal preference. 144hz is nice if you have a decent graphics card. 4k is not really worth it for gaming in my opinion if you're thinking about that too. Just my 2 cents
---
People have been wanting to play vanilla in a stable, official environment since the day TBC came out. During TBC people would bitch and moan that it wasn’t vanilla (which at the time was just called ‘pre-bc’) despite tbc being actually pretty close it it in hindsight. I just think it being the first time anyone will be able to play the World of Warcraft that they enjoyed (and have it be backed by Blizzard) in 13 years just makes people remember a time when things were different.
---
For Hunter, Race doesn’t matter much. So go with the animations you prefer. I think Orc Hunter looks really cool.
---
&gt; possibly get in trouble with their host country
---
Yeah cause the host country will care that you can't connect to some backwater Russian server
---
What the heck
---
Well, I'm pretty sure that one isn't going to work since you posted the key to the internet!
---
Similar but with a more direct route regarding PvE. I'll play a decent amount of PvP and aim for r12-13 while hoping for a solid raiding guild.
---
Was that res out of combat?
---
For me it is less that it is frowned upon in duels, but more that it seems entirely pointless. What even is the point of dueling outside of practice and sparring in a controlled environment? If someone duelled me and then used a bunch of consumables I would see it as more of a waste of time than anything else.
---
Hunters, They should get it first cause its needed.
---
The war-effort turn ins persisted into TBC? :O
---
95% bots and account sharers, and the other half will be premades setting up a ranking cartel. The latter is how I did it back then. If not, then good luck.
---
I sure as hell won't go through the grind again. 6 hours or less a day sleep, and that for 7 weeks? Never again. Unless you really enjoy the grind, I wouldn't recommend as R14 is very overrated. Both as a status symbol (I hope that by now people know better than to presume anyone R14 is a skilled player), and its loot, which will only be BIS up until Naxx. Though I hope that Blizzard will make an exception and itemizes them in phases in line with Vanilla, so that R14 won't be BIS for 3/4 of the game. Having AQ40 level gear and that even before BWL is released would be messed up.
---
Amazing, best zones in the game! And next would be tirisfal and silverpine, so you're doing God's work my man.
---
That's why you put priorities and put heavier stuff on mobs handled by pet than the targets you handle yourself.
---
This guy fucks
---
I’ve already abandoned current wow and have no interest in playing it once classic is out. The best thing BFA did for me was allow me to make enough gold to buy 3 months for of Blizzard balance to fund my first journey to 60 :D
---
For guild runs I always maintain a single SK list, so yes, when you have all your stuff you farm position. Given the large number of low percent drops from MC that are desirable I doubt too many will have everything they want before the end. 40 man raid, 10 bosses. Drop 2 or 3 pieces each. Everyone needs 10-17 pieces of raid tier gear. So 10 peices of gear each(low side). 30 pieces of gear per run (high side). 400 pieces of gear would take at min. 14 weeks assuming no duplication.  I think it'll be fine.
---
I wish. I will be burning the candle at both ends playing nights and weekends just like at launch. At least my current job doesn’t start until at 8am. Raids ending at 3am were a lot tougher when I had to by up by 5.
---
Na it doesn’t work. It’s way too slow because of the XP penalty.
---
Except I actually understand it. You wanna know what it says? It says that you sweat a lot when you exercise. 
---
If playing WoW gets the sweat going for a person it's an entirely different issue :p
---
They don't profit from the weapon skill which makes the humans mandatory.
---
The difference between an orc rogue and an UD is much smaller than between a human and an elf rogue.
---
I've stopped playing games entirely to build up as much energy and hype for the classic launch. And damn, hype has been built up let me tell you that. It's going to be glorious!
---
Renews on the warrior and tossing the occasional heal is usually all that is needed. The rest of the time you will be using shadow word pain and wanding stuff to death while trying to snipe some killing blows from the warrior for spirit tap. 
---
&gt; Am I more helpful leveling shadow or a healer spec?

Grab points in wand damage and spirit tap the rest is negligible because most of the healer talents are more aimed towards end game raiding as opposed to early game healing. Personally preference I go wands then into shadow but I find holy valid as well to an extent and this way you don't have to fight the warrior for killing blows.
---
&gt;Should I level tailoring? 
---
Speed leveling wise professions are a dirty trick because it is costly both time and money wise and you never have enough materials/cloth to make the stuff that would be relevant in your level range because by the time you gather enough you have out leveled that level range. End game wise though hell yeah go tailoring the bind on pickup healer robe is amazing. If you are playing at a slower more casual pace then you can pick up tailoring while leveling if you want.
---
Personally I always found enchanting to be frightfully expensive to level and you will always be broke while leveling because one of the biggest sources of gold while leveling is vendoring quest greens.
---
Depends on what metric you define "best" by.
---
Nah but there was a vendor you could turn in war effort signets in Silvermoon city.  I had already exalted the others and had enough left over in my bank to turn in.
---
No elves, no Legolas effect \^\^
---
Just want to be clear (I myself wanted clarification and thought other might too). All faction AH's will be linked. Horde and Alliance AH's are still separate from one another. In WoD horde and alliance AH's became one.
---
I’d spend it on good weapons. It will help tremendously with leveling speed and smoothness. Don’t save the gold. At level 60 you can easily make 50g an hour in all sorts of ways so why save the gold at lower levels.
---
Idk what [list] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSVcmgixKaP9LC-rrqS4D2rojIz48KwKA8QBmJloX1h7f8BkUloVuiw19eR2U5WvVT4InYgnPunUo49/pubhtml#) you're going off of but 3/4 listed as better have armor.
---
Level 20 Warlock for summoning as required by guild
---
Nah because it's only 1.12
---
If they were doing progressive itemization yes...But apparently they don't have all the builds
---
Not worth negative emotions. Online forums are like this. You're always going to have the old timers who have had every conversation and have seen every question many times interacting with people who just arrived. If I'm not interested in a certain topic I just don't click on it.
---
Same. I'm actually planning on getting that alt to lvl 5 and parking it in IF before starting on my main.
---
Rp servers for life
---
Isnt atiesh only usable by mages?
---
the dude makes great content idk wtf you're talking about
---
lol brah get on one
---
you can't even imagine what it's like to have 300+ dudes fighting over a world boss....
---
I looked at the client last night, there’s still a ton of BFA files present. I’ll confirm when I get home.
---
The truth doesn't care if it is articulate or not.
---
What's the stat priority for Balance druids (29/11/11) and where would I find good leather gear. I have been looking around for +spell power leather gear and I'm hard pressed to find stuff at the beginning of progression. As for stats, I'd imagine I'll prioritize Stam and Spell power, but I'm a little lost beyond that.
---
Nah there are several versions of the staff you get to pick. I believe there is a damage+healing one, a straight healing one, a Druid +shapeshift attack power one, and maybe one more
---
I’ve got a benq 27 inch 144hz.  I think it’s about 250.  I love it and also have a second older monitor that isn’t 144.
---
Sunken temple it gets a bit iffy and BRD is where I usually start hitting the wall of needing to respec to holy unless the tank overgears the place.
---
I think it’s better to get to 60 first so you get that out of the way.
---
I am same as OP.
---
I was leaning to 21:9 and also don't want to spend over $300
---
Who but third worlders can't afford 15 a month?
---
These look incredible. Sure you have many requests but Ashenvale Forest or Winterspring I would love to see :D Keep it up!
---
Entirely? No.
---
If your RL friend loots a purple BoE and you offer him $20 for it, how is Blizzard going to know if he just gave it to you or if he sold it to you?
---
Are channels global?
---
Since it could make sense to have a lvl60dungeons channel, or something if that was the case
---
Besides World PVP I can barely think of any occasion I'm even going to use Health potions, so of course I'm using them in World PVP. It's pretty common in world PVP fights on private servers for both people to use a potion. 
---
Duels are obviously no consumes unless you agree beforehand
---
As someone who does not really watch streamers, at least not WoW ones, do you have any recommendations on how to do this?
---
Yeah, the early levels on pretty much all classes are really basic/simple compared to what you have to work with in your 30's or 40's and onward, that's just the nature of classic (and is kind of awesome imo).
---
Going into Demonology in your teens/early 20's to get 3/3 in Improved Voidwalker is worth it to help him tank.  His taunts, self heals between pulls, and sacrifice in "oh shit" moments are all significantly improved with that talent.
---
As for your original post, yeah, Searing Pain is really nice in PvP for the shorter cast time, but it definitely has a place in PvE in finishing off mobs.  If you're running an instance and a mob gets to low health and begins to flee, you'll use Searing Pain to try to drop the mob before it can get to another pack and pull adds, since it's quicker to get the cast off than Shadow Bolt.  That applies less to leveling out in the world though, where you'll usually want to finish mobs off with Drain Soul to proc your Improved Drain Soul talent, but if a mob is going toward a group, you can definitely try to burst it down with Searing Pain before it pulls more adds.
---
Nb, Improved Drain Soul is much less useful in instances since *you* have to be the one to do the damage that kills the mob for it to proc, which usually doesn't happen so you can't really rely on it.
---
Do you want something stronger or funner and how do you feel about constantly having to redo buffs?
---
Stronger= Pal but boring as hell to play and have to constantly redo buffs.
---
Funner= priest.
---
You’re correct. It’s likely that Lupos won’t be doing shadow damage in Classic but Brokentooth will still have a crazy attack speed.
---
Quick testing  
---
**Combat Swords  - 21 kills (same as Arms)** 
---
Adren rush and BF feels great. Mobs running away is soooo annoying for a melee. My best run I ran crip/crip just because mobs running screws you so hard as melee, it very easily gets you killed or slows you down. Even with double crippling it doesn't have 100% uptime.  
---
**Hemo dirty deeds with Ruthlessness and Relentless - 19 kills**  
---
This felt a lot more fun. Cheap energy 3 point cheap shot is really nice, and getting energy and cp on finisher makes rogue feel much more fluid. I think it would be very close if not the same as combat swords just doing single target grinding. I just skipped the two-packs, you can kill them with hemo but it's not fast or pretty.
---
loot trading through tickets is exactly how retail worked...lol
---
the real problem is lack of info.
---
No one knows exactly how Ony worked. No one knows the backfire rate to either rocket boot. No one knows the history of progressive itemization that aren't mentioned. Like proc rates and spell power ratios
---
For the most part all the problems are just due to information not being available.
---
That's very true. Which is why I don't have to go to any length to tell you that you're wrong :D
---
What didn’t work in vanilla? Reckoning? 
---
/sit definitely worked, you would always crit a sitting target in retail vanilla.
---
Perhaps. But you'd think a company trying to squeeze as much money as possible would atleast market their game or have a release date by now to build hype.
---
Exactly. My WoW character is 12 years old. I can take a break for years and come back to him. I highly doubt any pserver would last more than a year or two.
---
Yeah I would play on pve server but all my friends will play pvp server
---
Whatever you do don't get 60hz, but sounds like you know that already
---
I wish i had your talent. These look awesome
---
Mage, warlock, priest, and a druid all get a class-specific version of it.
---
Best GL I ever remembered was a dude that ate drama and spit out encouraging words and good jokes. Having a guy with a level head that can take criticism and give it out in a very calm and cool headed manner is going to be the best dude you can have.
---
Having him be a large part of raid organization and/or an anchor character like the #1 guild tank is a plus as it gives his words more weight.
---
Having a good guild is a harder story, as it really depends on who you have as guild members. If you have a bunch of bad apples everything is going to smell really rotten. If you do manage to find a large group of good people it's good to just remember about positive attitudes. Call out toxicity when you see it but don't attack the person being who's an ass.
---
hax0rs
---
There's nothing wrong with revisiting old topics.
---
Doing it multiple times per day, every day is the issue here.
---
There are a few QOL improvements that have been confirmed:
---
\- Limited sharding in the early zones to alleviate launch crowds
---
\- Some UI improvements like being able to pick up all your mail at once
---
\- Trading BoP items for a limited time within the raid for cases of mislooted items. Raids only.
---
The approach to evaluating changes from Vanilla to Classic is to look at whether or not it changes the social dynamic of the game. For instance we will be able to pick up all of our mail with one click, but the 1 hour delay when mailing items will remain. So if a guild mate was going to craft something for you it's a 2 hour round trip for the mail, it's much faster to find out where they are and go to them. Maybe they're farming in Dire Maul, that takes a while to get to so you stay and chat for a bit or help them out with something. The design team is very wary of changes in general because of how unintended consequences can change the sense of the world and make it feel less permanent.
---
So basically you are agreeing with me, just you are blaming the ones who are not toxic because they are unknowingly "triggering" people?   
---
Is that a correct summary?
---
No progressive itemization is really bad dude
---
It shortens the game. No one disagrees with that
---
Blizzard claims they don't have the data to do progressive itemization tho. Which might be true. The argument is not it's not better. They changed those items to make more sense as the game went on.
---
There is no holy paladin tier set until tier 3 with no progressive itemization. Because the devs didn't release 1.12 thinking you'd be starting at MC
---
Pure nostalgia? What? Blizzard nor anyone else with sense maeks that argument. It would obviously be better to be closer to how the devs intended it. They did not intend for us to play on 1.12 starting at MC
---
Yep. People are impatient af
---
Very interesting what's going to happen at Classic launch.
---
&gt;bank alfs
---
Now in Pog form!
---
Same I feel like 21:9 for wow would be so sick but at the same time what about 1440p or 144hz. And isn't 21:9 weird for streaming.
---
Pretty rad. One of the things I want to do is merchant and play markets in game. How much gold did you make?
---
For me the the economic aspect of the game is so important I wont play if it has tokens.
---
Don't worry they're just sore they've wasted so much time on the shit show that retail has become, instead of patiently waiting for classic.
---
I’m definitely one of those people boosting these numbers up. I unsubbed from WoW about 3 months ago. Vanilla was the only time I didn’t get to fully experience what the game had to offer and I’m happy to have a 2nd chance at that. Between this and Borderlands 3, my year looks booked solid.
---
I will never log into league of legends again once classic is out, and damn does that make me insanely happy
---
&gt; retail bad
---
I think everyone's aware of that, but nobody expects the game to be perfect. Whether they fix it or not, it should still be enjoyable.
---
I dont know how it works exactly, but I would love it if these could be displates.
---
Before BWL you mean, because AFAIK, the progression is Rhok'Delar -&gt; BWL Crossbow -&gt; Nerubian Slavemaker
---
Maybe he's upset because you're taking up his precious meme space with actual discussion.
---
Put the mob between you and your imp, and ping pong it back and forth, trading aggro so the mob never actually attacks
---
You’re right, people definitely choose to work for a shit company and aren’t stuck there for all sorts of reasons
---
Fel concentration turned it around for me - can consistently drain life which does a fair amount of damage.  With improved lifetap you can balance your hp/mana pool well.  Probably not as efficient as void/dot/wand but I enjoyed it.
---
Reaching level 40 was another matter though, with +shadow damage gear it really starts rocking.  Dark Pact is also something I really enjoy since your imp can function as a battery and you can avoid lifetapping almost entirely.
---
It has nothing to do with affording one account, please read the argument. Any cost to play is a barrier-to-entry that will deter a lot of toxic behavior. 
---
For example it will stop every script-kiddie from running 10 bot accounts farming gold for them  24/7.
---
I think the most beneficial item buff is the mage's, but the druid has the best overall stats for the class.
---
Loot council, and then keep that shit on a public google docs excel sheet of who got what when so you can fairly distribute.
---
The standard recommendation is to ignore crafting professions until 60, because they take up a lot of time (and money, remember mounts are very expensive). If you don’t care that much about when you hit 60, go ahead and take whatever you want. Generally though the only profession that’s worth leveling as you level is first aid. You’ll level any profession faster at 60 anyway because you’ll have access to more areas, faster travel, and more gold.
---
Doh!
---
Cant wait to see that dungeon as I never ran it, was always horde and it went under my radar, heard it is a good one.
---
Hopefully the frustration doesn't bleed into how we reply to people, which is my point. Unless the moderation policy accompanied by aggressive enforcement seek to stem repeats you're going to see "what class", "what server", "release date?", "after naxx?", "DAE TBC?", "racials?" and all the rest tomorrow and Tuesday. 
---
I haven't clicked on a Naxx post in a long time.
---
[Mage](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22589#reward-of) [Warlock](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22589#reward-of) [Priest](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22631) [Druid](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22632)
---
It tends to end up being a guild politics thing, but my personal opinion is Mage &gt; Priest / Warlock &gt; Druid strictly from an "aura usefulness" perspective.
---
No you can only hit things with 100% chance at a lower level. THat's why gear is covered in hit and people have talents for it....
---
You remember hitting mobs slightly below you probably
---
For the most part you'll be wearing cloth.
---
Orc for PvP and Troll for PvE I think. The stun resist is big against rogues
---
Pretty sure you need to farm new ones
---
The global populations, language barriers, dynamic respawn and sheer max population, and drama is what makes them so garbage to play on.
---
The sheer server lag for those of us outside EU and piss poor scripting and optional wall LOS breaking is just icing on the shitty cake.
---
There are so many.
---
You get so many useful abilities in PvP and PvE. Parachute cloak is huge in AB PvP. Plus the transporters provide big savings in travel time.
---
The Grenades, Mortars, bombs and dynamite can't be underestimated for how much damage they do. These alone justify the profession.
---
The battle chicken gives you a 4 minute 5% AP buff for your entire party. Jumper cables give druids/ non-healers a chance a res, something that can be quite useful in 5 man runs and increasing the speed that raids get back up after a wipe. Cutting 10 minutes off of a spirit runback because the FD'd hunter or vanished rogue rezzed a healer is amazing.
---
Do I even need to mention repair bots? Mandatory for progression.
---
The Resistance trinkets are often BiS or near BiS and can be useful in PvP as well.
---
I'm so confused... That's literally describing what Druids have been able to do in literally every expansion including Vanilla. The only difference between every other expansion and retail is that on retail you only have your abilities for 2 of your forms?
---
&gt; I was sitting on a literal goldmine 
---
If you were sitting on a literal goldmine, I hope you were smart enough to go inside, take some gold, sell it or save it, and retire early.
---
Honestly no clue was definatly 5 figures. I'm sure it's not alot of gold by today's standards im sure. 
---
At one point me and a few other enchanter had the essence market pretry cornered though and it wasnt really that hard to pull off.
---
When your raid is in a position to get Atiesh, you've beaten the game already. There is no *need* to give it to any one class in particular because your raid doesn't need to become stronger any more.
---
If you nevertheless were to give it according to benefit to the raid, it should go to Mages over Warlocks. Again, when you've already beaten all bosses, more DPS is what makes all your runs go faster and smoother. You can't heal bosses to death faster with better gear on your healers. Mages &gt; Warlocks simply because at Naxx levels of gear, the SP aura from the Mage Atiesh provides more DPS than the 2% crit from the Warlock version.
---
Wut? lol
---
The client is gonna be crashing when two raids meet and you're gonna regret this
---
You have no idea how good you had it.
---
I pretty much did nothing with it lol. Ended up rerolling a new server and it largely went to waste
---
Yeah Atiesh is great for druids but given how many mages there will be in any given raid there's zero chance of getting it.
---
That's not true it wasn't true in retail not true now
---
1 a bank
---
Yeaaaah, I'm with you on this.  This would be a large negative for me.  I'm not even that purist, i'm good with graphics updates and other slight improvements/modernization options.  pay2win games are not my cup of tea.
---
Great summary.  
---
It's also worth noting that holy paladins can heal PvP and PvE with the same spec.
---
Correct, and in pvp it even procced talents. In PvE it didn't, you just get crit but get no talent proc from it. Hence why spamming /sit for reckoning or enrage wasn't a thing in vanilla and won't be a thing in Classic.
---
I thought World Defense required rank 11 or higher
---
Oh god, I forgot about innervate. Such a great tool!
---
There's very few options outside of AQ40 and pvp sets. Boomkin didn't even exist until the Druid rework (nearly a year after release), so yeah it wasn't really a consideration when all the items were done in all the original dungeons.
---
Out of all the reeeeeing on this server about tokens, low level sharding, and 2 hr trade window, and you think the most immature thing is saying I'd rather not play than play on a pserver?
---
Alright man.  You do you.
---
that's.....exactly what i was getting at, friend
---
I don't play any games at all. They were getting in the way of my other hobbies so I just quit them altogether, but classic WoW has too big of a place in my heart to ignore.
---
Warlock main duo level with friend 10h per week.
---
Hunter alt for gold. Will 100% ding 60 before my main
---
Some of those are valid complaints.
---
Your post was pure crybaby.
---
As a mage, is it worth keeping tailoring after crafting the robes?
---
You need some fresh air and a hobby
---
Are you sure? Source?
---
IIRC it requires the rank for writing in that chat, not accessing it to get attack information.
---
It’s too bad blizzard doesn’t provide Internet. I wouldn’t have a cable bill at all.
---
I noticed a lot of people will be swapping over to the opposite faction. :D
---
61
---
The Token and the Shop are still in the files because they want you to be able to purchase a subscription and use the already bought tokens without having to log out of Classic.
---
Imagine having to download the huge Retail client just to buy a WoW Token from the millions of Gold you have.
---
Get a new one.
---
BARRENS CHAT
---
That is why Kingdom Come is probably my favorite singleplayer game(Really liked Oblivion too). I have put in some serious hours into that game. 
---
Would recommend you checking it out if you haven't yet. Makes time go a bit faster while waiting for Classic!
---
By than argument every single player should level as a hunter and skip all dungeons because anything else is slower and therefore worse.
---
Alcoholic control freak with rage issues. Molten Core isn’t going to clear itself, bitch.
---
Looking at your post history you seem very toxic... Fitting with some of you in this community. Im hyped for classic and haven't played wow since wotlk but what's the point of forcing your opinion (retail bad, classic good) on people? Just let everyone enjoy what they want dude
---
Hybrid made the game special to me. I played druid in vanilla. I played variations of everything... No spec was the best for everything. 
---
Bc I played a mage, mostly pvp. Pom pyro mage was... A blast. Frost mage was my go to but even then. There were variations of frost that made everyone different. You could run into 10 mages and not one of them the same.
---
I will continue to play OSRS on my phone. Hell, ill grind agility on my second monitor while waiting for flight paths or group members at dungeons like I always have.
---
I’ll casually play halo MCC on steam. 
---
Mordhau might still see love from me.
---
Rest In Peace every other mmo or shitty private server that I’ve been surviving on for the last 5 years...
---
Did you actually draw this wtf it's great man. U should do elwynn and goldshire inn next thatd be fucking awesome!
---
Well ping and having their own servers will do most of that work lol
---
Probably Priest &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock (if it's the fixed version) &gt; Druid.
---
Or sometimes Lock &gt; Mage &gt; Priest &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Druid.
---
Or Sometimes Druid &gt; Mage &gt; Priest &gt; Lock, if the Druid is the Guild Master.
---
it vary quite a bit by your guild culture and how hardcore on min-maxing benefits you are. Though you'll usually get at least 1 of each for the class leaders, and maybe one each for each important caster group.
---
Yeah. I get that Blizzard is trying to combat scalpers, but surely there are less invasive ways. A while ago I've read of a startup that uses a blockchain in combination with a unique identifier that is hard to exchange (such as a SIM or any form of government issued card). If implemented well, then no tracking would be required. Blizzard going into bed with a spyware app is just cheap, lazy and dumb.
---
I don't thing that anyone is interested in my story, but still, i gonna tell it.
---
So my plan is top stop playing CSGO for the time i'm leveling. I will speed rush to 60 with my Druid either way, so it won't take that long to get to 60. I'm not the fastest leveler, so it might take me 4-5 days played until i hit 60. should be possible to do within 1-2 Weeks, depending on the time i commit to it every day. 14 hours per day is what i plan to do.
---
After that i start playing CSGO again, while doing stuff like professions, BiS Gear(Feral DPS) and farming consumables. As soon as i get to raiding, i will start farming my consumables each saturday &amp; sunday in the morning, as i don't play CSGO in the morning either way.
---
I'm not sure about playing an alt yet but if i choose to do so, i won't be following any quest guides, do dungeons, enjoy the zones and do a lot of world PvP(will definitely do this with my Feral too!)
---
Before people complain about rushing to level 60, i played on private Servers and therefore experienced every zone already. It's not like it's 13 years ago for me. I've never done speedrushing before though and might actually enjoy it. Not pushing for Server first though because i could never experience what world PvP was like back in the days and that is something, that i just have to experience finally and i'm REALLY excited about that already and i'm willing to sacrifice days for it if i have to, i'm specifically talking about STV here, but not only.
---
You can still your tailoring's [Mooncloth](http://classicdb.ch/?item=14526) cooldown (About 4 days). You can also make use of the [Bloodvine](http://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421) gear set effect once ZG comes out.
---
That's what it always was. Trolling the old insecure weirdos while leveling is a beautiful wow pass time

It seems at least possible that the token and cash shop features are coded into the client deeply enough that even if they aren't actually available there are assets that need to be present so that the client can function without weirdness. Either that, or they haven't been removed yet. Or they do have some plans to include a Classic only cash shop or token and just aren't talking about it yet. If it's the latter, the uproar will be epic, so it's a little hard to imagine that it would survive once it comes out officially that they have any plans to include it.
---
you need tailoring 300 to get the bloodvine set bonus of 2% increased spell crit. Otherwise you could have just bought bloodvine off the AH and not leveled tailoring at all
---
In duels yeah, but in wpvp against the other faction it's anything goes. You can be as salty as you want but at the end of the day he got his honor and you have to run back to your corpse and there is nothing you can do about it, there are no rules in world pvp so be prepared for everything.
---
&gt; If you gotta rage do it outside of text chat, outside of voice chat, outside of the game.
---
Come on a good GM meltdown is worth it weight in lulz.
---
Why are you trying to encourage someone to do something they find boring? People don't like doing boring things. 
---
There's never enough tanks in the game so the last thing you should be doing is telling a potential tank that they must play in a boring way leading to them quitting. 
---
Let the people have their fun so that people actually play the game.
---
I mean, when you go in there being a dick - what did you expect?
---
Who gives a fuck about retail players? Let them stay there so they don't fuck up what we have coming down the pipe.
---
It's still a repost. There's like 20 of these (of course that's a slight exaggeration) a day.
---
Do 50,000 xp/h with my gear on a lvl 45 pally on pirates and I'll gold your last 10 comments.    
---
Just download the repack someone else posted here and I'll dm you a script for all the gear I used, will take about 10 mins setup time after download. I'll even put a youtube video up of my gear/numbers. Looking forward to seeing yours.
---
Got downvoted to hell the other day when i said today was May and there was still no announcement of a release date and that i was hyped.
---
I then proceeded to insult everyone because they all got offended when i said the July 16th was a marketing ploy.
---
Yes, stop spamming this sub with same 10 topics every single day and you'll see a lot less "toxicity"
---
you talk way too in the extremes to have an actual debate, you should probably read more carefully before going off multiple replies as i stated multiple times the implementation of pillars was poorly done. This means that "X factor has uses but should have been more carefully examined" much like this conversation
---
If you're just worried about PvP, spell crit and spell damage are high priority for you. Spell hit isn't nearly as important in PvP. Stamina is important just due to the nature of PvP.
---
As I'm sure you know, Boomkin have mana problems, so whatever you feel like for that. Your build doesn't have Intensity to account for mana back while casting, so spirit won't help much. Mp5 is kinda nice, and the same goes with intellect. I believe the Int to 1% spell crit for Druids is roughly 60:1.
---
You haven't posted to /r/wow in 5 months... the posts you did make are mostly positive karma...the ones that aren't you were usually being an edgelord.
---
That aside, it's amazing you think this sub is any different, aside from having a totally positive view toward Classic. If you think /r/classicwow is anything other than mountains of reposts asking 'DO WE HAVE SERVER NAMES YET?!' and 'ARE DRUIDS ACTUALLY AMAZING?! I SAW THIS VIDEO SO I THINK THEY'RE AMAZING." and a bunch of shitposts and memes, then you're in for a bad time.

Ion seemed to be pretty upfront about certain things like sharding being “antithetical to the concept of a cohesive Classic community”. Tokens would also be antithetical to that concept as well, I can’t imagine they’d be that stupid to add them.
---
I'm not sure how asking the same questions day in and day out counts as "actual discussion"
---
Yea that’s understood. I’m more so referencing the behavior of miss chance / mana regen on a fresh lvl 1 character for example. Start a new Druid, and notice you’ll be out of mana after 2-3 casts as well as have a significant chance to miss against other lvl 1 mobs. 
---
Not to diminish the work done by the devs but it’s reasonable to believe that the percentages at that level are too high. The chances of a lvl 1 caster to have a resisted spell against a lvl 1 are lower in reality than a lvl 27 mob resisting a cast from a lvl 27 character. Although it’s difficult to say for certain, it’s just likely that the hit chance is consistent across all levels, assuming 0% hit in gear, where it should actually decrease chance to hit as levels increase and in turn emphasizing the need for hit even more.
---
I don't like the idea of making changes to any of the classes and would be against them.
---
However, the idea of extra content being added after a period of time has passed, is an idea I could get behind IF it was done in the spirit of Classic. I'm not sure how much trust I have in Blizzard to do this though. But, I do think it would be cool to add Kara in as a 20man and open up Hyjal as open world content. The only question is can and would Blizzard add these in in a way that still holds true to the Classic experience?

I'm aware. Previous poster just mentioned that they couldn't think of a more slot-efficient blue item than Banthok's and I'd argue Whipvine for priests is better.
---
Enhance with the option of respeccing to ele at like 40+.
---
I believe shield and dagger is the most efficient weapon combo but the beauty of Shaman is the ability to switch it up with a 2h whenever you want.
---
You wanna put down your searing totem/etc and pull mobs towards your totem pile as Enhance. When/if you go Ele you wanna fish for Elemental Focus procs with R1 shocks.
---
It's kinda hard to go wrong with Shaman, you can even go a hybrid of resto/ele or resto/enhance in some cases.
---
I'll go straight back to where I came from if classic has tokens. Not even going to look back for anything involving Blizzard if they allow that P2W feature.
---
The Westfall Defias Church could.
---
I'm counting on it

Pve...because i simply hate pvp

It sounds like you misinterpreted my question.  Nobody in their right mind would suggest trying to impose the original 2004-2006 Vanilla patch &amp; item progression on private servers based on the upcoming WoW Classic.
---
My question was whether or not private server players will be able to turn their backs on nostalgic 2004-2006 Vanilla servers and play on private Classic-based servers instead (once those servers actually exist).
---
Pretty sure improved drain soul procs as long as the mob is being affected by Drain Soul when it dies.  You don't have to get the kill.
---
It's limited usefulness because a life tap is probably more mana, but it should still work.
---
Very nice man
---
Worried? I'm hoping for it.
---
If I haven't completely ruined a relationship over this game then it failed to do what it was supposed to.
---
&gt; I was hell bent on raiding and logged 127 days on my DK before Ruby Sanctum was released
---
That's not too bad.
---
&gt;on my DK 
---
&gt; before Ruby Sanctum 
---
....Dear god, my son.
---
All of them...
---
You think it's bad now? Wait until after release and you're half a level away from getting your first mount but have to go to bed at a reasonable hour.
---
You wake up the next morning already looking forward to coming home and finishing the rest of 39. You start your morning routine and try and push wow out of your head as you know it'll only make the day go by slower if that's all you're thinking about. By the time you're headed out the door you've already started to plan your work day - no thought of wow in your head. You're driving along and you pass this. 
---
Oh shit. Man I can't wait to get my frostsaber! I'm going to finally be able to get around a decent speed! 
---
As you slowly start to slip back into wow mode time slows down. But it's too late now. You're almost out the the hell hole that is STV. No more getting ganked by xXNoobSlayr420Xx the undead rogue! No more god damn tigers and trolls! You're sitting at your desk and you glimpse at the clock. 8:45am. Wait. That can't be right, you've been there for at least 3 hours right? Wrong. You're doomed to work what feels like 3 shifts in a row before you can get home. 
---
But you finally do get home! You boot up wow, do several quests, ding 40 and head to darnasus to get your glorious shiny new mount! You've been saving gold for a while in anticipation for this moment. You finally purchase your mount, get on and jump around for a bit to show it off. Okay. Back to the grind. You get to your next zone and pick up a few quests.
---
Damn I'm thirsty time to grab a quick drink! You head over to the fridge to grab a mountain Dew. Wait a minute. Why is it dark out? What time is it? You look at the oven clock. 11:52pm. Fuck. You know it's time to log off, you have to be up early for work again. 
---
You log out and head to bed. The next morning the same thing happens. You really need an upgrade for your boots, you've been wearing the same pair since LVL 26. Maybe if you go to - no. This time you WONT think about wow. You put on your favorite podcast this time in the car to distract yourself. Oh shit! Chris D'Elia is doing a show close to me maybe I'll be able to - you pass Blizzard again. Fuck. I think I picked up a quest that gives me a big chest upgrade, I better do that one first.
---
You're stuck in this cycle until you can quit wow again or move. You're screwed dude.
---
If how other people spending their money on a game ruins a game you pay to escape your financial problems - you’re fucked kid
---
Post removed as low effort (Rule #7). Sorry bro! This is just too circle jerky.
---
Not true, there are multiple classes that can use several of those.
---
Retail is f2p, you're just capped to 20. But you can't play with 32bit anyway, support ended for that a while ago.
---
Get with the times my dude.
---
As a couple of people have stated; taking vacation for a BLIZZARD game in particular is stupid, but especially a Blizzard game called CLASSIC WOW! The servers are just gonna go into melt down andthe sharding (if they defo implement it - which tbh they probably definitely should) will still be relatively bad as just so many people will be killing the same mobs. It's better to wait a couple of weeks after launch because the starting zones will have calmed down, all the people who have taken vacation will be back at work, and you can just zip past everyone cause you've been building up your rested XP whilst playing casually for the first couple of weeks. /taps head with finger to signify he's a smarty wahrty.
---
If World PvP were somehow only possible with other players leveling in that zone, I'd 100% roll PvP
---
But it's not and 99% of your interactions with the other faction while leveling is going to be a level 60 Rogue spawn camping low level players or it's going to be a level 60 passing by who dismounts just to one shot you with frostbolt.
---
HUNTER AMMO
---
everyone knows they wont aggro unless you get close enough
---
The difference between human and nelf is also minute. But the point is that there is a difference so you saying that “Orc paired with melee is not true for rogues” is simply false because it does matter.
---
Melancholy and brooding.  I like it.  A fitting ambience for EP.
---
mind explaining how the whole premade gets fucked if one person falls behind? i read the post but that was not how i understood it.
---
Exactly, no changes! I'm already signing up for some community college classes so I can drop out all over again.
---
I’ll be giving up casually playing apex or fortnite. A lot of my old gaming buddies from the mid 2000’s till early 2010’s are getting it and plan on investing a lot
---
Of time in it.
---
Yeah worried about it too. I’ve been doing more and more cycling to keep fit, and go for an hour or two cycle before work.....which could easily change to an hour or two grinding!!😂😂👍
---
Please YEET yourself out the door, thank you
---
I've played on pvp servers in WoW since 2007. Good world pvp is \*really\* fun. Sadly 99% of world pvp isn't good, it's complete shit. Being ganked over and over is literally the opposite of enjoyable and it just isn't worth the 1% that's really good. I'll be rolling on a PvE server this time.
---
We had a demo
---
Wow, from a narrative stand-point that is really odd.
---
Given the Blood Elves join at the push through the Dark Portal - what lore reason would they have for honouring signets related to a war effort they were never involved in? And someone at Blizzard had to create the vendor too.
---
Oh well, maybe many blood elves participated off-screen.
---
Oh, well...Then I have to disagree.
---
Ah yes, the old hallowed Halls of World Defense. How I have missed the, old friends.
---
But while leveling, won't players with engineering have an advantage over the people who don't have it? Or won't it matter when you're being ganked in world pvp?
---
Really? I start to feel like one at lvl 4 when I can drop immolate and corruption and kill 3 mobs at a time while playing agro ping pong with the imp to kite them.
---
Sounds like warlock checks 2 or your 3 boxes
---
There's no way I'd ever sacrifice high response rate for high res.  Get 120hz+ even on a bad panel and it's already worth it.
---
&gt; since you are always low on gold at early levels
---
So how would you find a token seller in the start of classic? If you have low amount of gold, means everyone else also has it, which means that tokens either aren't purchasable by anyone or their value is at like 50 silver.
---
How much of a priority is crit considering DoTs can't crit and the spec is reliant of a hit and run playstyle? I'm aware of the mana problems, but I'm willing to find ways to work around them.
---
Or because the guy running it decides to shut it down.
---
its just a guess but I'm thinking they put it in incase they released new servers after TBC so you could turn in rep for the two new factions.  
---
Was pretty surprised to find out myself back on the day and was glad I didn't destroy my signets (almost did at one point)
---
This is actually fairly helpful, thanks. Makes me consider playing Druid as an alt and go for these things when the appropriate content is released.
---
Are you from the US? Hell most places don't give vacation time until you work there for xx amount of years.
---
Imagine the rogues who never got T3 after guilds started tossing all the tokens to warriors to gear up for this fight.
---
When you need to drop some direct damage fast? Searing Pain becomes nuts in destro spec. 10% to Crit, ruin, ember storm all buffing it, and it's the best way you have to trigger Aftermath, which is a seriously under appreciated talent.
---
Oh yes, this is quite a valid answer. Thank you.
---
What i found different here compared to r/wow is posts are pretty positive here whereas posts are either art, criticism to the game or some really blatant circlejerking of sylvanas and the horde
---
Hell, I still get lost in WC sometimes

---
But to save you some time. Expansion after expansion they continually pruned stuff, and the stuff they added was counterintuitive to say the least.
---
For example they added flying mounts, you'd think that'd be cool right, your own personal wind rider/gryphon to go where you want. What ended up happening is they completely removed you from the immersion of the world, you no longer had to be on foot, you could just plop down from the sky exactly to your quest and not have to face the dangers of running to that area (world pvp died).
---
Then you had the constant pruning of abilities, professions, pretty much anything, you name it.
---
Probably the biggest difference between modern WoW and Vanilla was the way you geared. They added so many catch up mechanics post-WotLK where it became so easy to gear up and get epics. Literally everyone is running around with 'Epic' gear. Looking for Raid, Looking for Dungeon, and the extremely low skill cap required to do those things resulted in welfare gear.
---
No kidding. "People should stop working for shit companies." What an ignorant comment.
---
No I am from UK and that sounds bleak as hell
---
Hunter good at first, garbage late raids.
---
Warlock garbage first, good late raids
---
Paladins only good as healers. 
---
Make your choice
---
What will we do if Diablo 4 is released in 2020?  I mean, how will we divide our attention??  Holding a job will become impossible.
---
Mental health is suffering pretty hard in the US for sure.
---
That should tell us a lot about 8.2  /barf
---
Upvote for leveling with dark pact. Underrated talent, only wish they would buff up how fast it transferred mana like they did in TBC.
---
Dope but the kerning is super rough.
---
I'll vouch for this.  I started listening to them when I found out Martin Lopez (one of my favorite drummers) joined a new band.  
---
Soen is one of the few new bands I really enjoy.   I can also say all 4 albums are very enjoyable from front to back.   No lack of talent and you definitely get a Tool vibe,  from more than just the vocalist.
---
Pandaren came before the kung-fu panda movie though.
---
Well someone's aspiring to be the Rex Hunt of WoW.
---
Had not seen your other art before, but both it's all great. Really atmospheric. The plaguelands is such a cool area too, had much more potential than what Blizzard did with them in game, which was not much.
---
oh yeah i want to die every day
---
PvE. Never liked wpvp in Wow, other mmorpgs did it better.
---
Wpvp is too casual. You just don't get punished hard enough, if you get killed. 
---
I want my heart to race in wpvp.
---
If you listen to the doomsayers everyone and their grandmother will be rank 14 and it'll trivialize MC because of the weapons.
---
I think you're forgetting one key factor... 
---
The literal microsecond Official Classic WoW is out in the wild, Blizzard is going to come after Pservers with a vengeance you've never seen before. 
---
Why?
---
Because those are now direct competitors for your time, and more importantly for Blizz - your wallet.
---
Regardless of how Classic is received by the community - once it is here, Pservers are dead.
---
Yeah, the OP post feels a bit like "So other than that, how was the play Mrs. Lincoln"
---
Sure, but you can't wear them all at once :p
---
I just wish they toured outside of Europe.
---
You know what? I actually believe what he is saying. That being said, they obviously never got to kill the 4 Horsemen as it just didn't work out.
---
Pretty much already covered this: Many people would be willing to spend money on buying gold legitimately and are rich enough to afford to do so (Think: WoW Classic target audience is adults with full time jobs). This is a problem because people are used to microtransactions these days and use them when they can't be bothered to spend hours or days or weeks or months farming and grinding for something which is in essence what a lot of WoW Classic entails. Gold farming is itself a big part of the game: Gear, enchants, mounts, consumables etc are expensive! Giving people the option to bypass this is destroying a large part of the game and the experience.
---
But what about the Chinese / Venezuelans etc? Most people wouldn't use these services because they fear being banned and losing the hundreds of hours they put in to the game. Those who take the risk? Well.. if they care that little are they a big loss if they are banned? People tend to use these services when A) they are bored with the game and want to buy some gear they can't otherwise afford. B) they lose their money due to gambling or dying (think sand casino in OSRS) or C) They think by being rich it will improve a game they already are bored with or dislike.
---
&gt;If blizzard isn't willing to deliver a quality product they will crash and burn to their competition.
---
You mean, they'll crash and burn their competition through legal avenues. 
---
As if Blizz would let Pservers run free once they've put their own paywalled offering out. Every Player on a Pserver is a lost Payer to blizzard.
---
I'll take one Atiesh to go please!
---
Ahem.. if you plan to raid you don't pick undead because of the extra dot. There are 16 debuff slots and almost all are taken by debuffs, dots are not allowed, especially not DP.
---
I love this. Let us know if you plan on selling prints.
---
Would you put them to sell ? Those are really beautiful!
---
If I end up going tailoring (trying to decide between it and Alchemy) I will be making by bag production services available. Just bring me cloth and I'll make it for you :)
---
Again they would
---
It's ideal
---
We just don't have the info
---
No progression is terrible and makes no sense
---
No joke, consider something smaller like a 20". For games where there's a finite amount of information on the screen, being able to flick your eyes around faster to see everything can be a net win vs having a giant 30" monitor. This gets even more relevant when you start clicking things like targeting enemies. Maybe a 24", but I don't like going higher than that for gaming. Ideally you'd be able try out a few and see how it feels.
---
Oh, I see what you mean. I thought you were going for the Big Starfire Crits playstyle. That was why I prioritized crit so heavily. Either way, you'll still be gearing pretty similarly to a Mage, Warlock, or Shadow Priest just due to the scarcity of leather spell damage gear.
---
Didn’t realize this was a fake news subreddit..
---
The trick is to have other fun things you enjoy.
---
I’m a gamer I played all day yesterday. Today I got up, cooked steak and eggs and went for a swim. Now I’m watching golf with my dog and, admittedly, reading about classic wow lol. 
---
During the week I try never to game more than two nights a row. If it’s Wednesday and I’ve been up until midnight Monday-Tuesday I do something different. I go out or work on a project around the house or something. I find that keeps my gaming fresh and makes games last longer.
---
If you jump into vanilla with a power gaming, mist play every spare moment mentality, you’ll be bored with it in a few months. But if you take it slow you’ll get a better experience out of the game and you’ll enjoy life outside of the game more as well.
---
Just my opinion.
---
Can you not just ask the security guard to ask them to announce a date?
---
I'm pretty sure hit chance on most of these things is very well known
---
As well as their mana cost because that's 1.12
---
It's a very very large state. K-12 scores have some pretty big swings on where the population is. If your living near blizzard then your k-12 education is going to be fine.
---
play alliance warlock if you are to pick *that* faction. In general there are a lot less because alliance are afraid of wotf.
---
Please yell "CLASSIC WHEN!" from your car when you you pass. Sincerely, everyone.
---
I think you missed the fact that I was agreeing with you? Net neutrality is related to Blizzard lawyers not being able to bully ISPs.
---
Damn...
---
And then you went on some "optimal" fucking tangent, moron. 
---
OP asked about "viable". You provided superfluous information, which is fine, but then you had a problem with me expanding on it.
---
Most people who want any of the legendaries are probably only going to be able to have the time and energy to get one. So in away you kinda of have to choose one.
---
You're not meant to say your wish out loud.
---
I think if you go looking for toxic posts in any internet community you won’t be disappointed.
---
Retail servers basically don't exist anymore except as a vestigial appendage of the way things used to be.
---
i loved leveling up as leatherworking. Crafted most of my gear and it was usually better than drops or quest rewards. At the end made the Devilsaur Set and felt great. Def levelling with Leatherworking again. :)
---
Doesn't have to be a set per se, with set bonus, just a collection of gear that can be used in such fashion.
---
I'm leveling a paladin and I wanted to check out this discord hoping to glean some various info, but this link expired in 24 hours and I clicked it exactly as it expired. :(
---
Two of these are not useable in most fights. One is completely useless in boss fights of these two.
---
Some of the BoP items like [these tailoring robes](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7054) feel worth it while leveling, but the vast majority of crafted items are BoE, so you can just get them at the auction house. It can still be fun and rewarding, but there's very little you can do pre-300 that isn't just BoE.
---
NE priest is terrible relative to dwarf
---
Who gets one of the most OP spells in the game...fear ward
---
Humans are technically bis for pve if you have enough dwarves for fearwards  because of teh spirit. But if you're going to be doing any fights with fear. Dwarf is better unless your raid can coat literally everyone with constant fear wards. 
---
PvP while shadowmeld isn't the worst, we'll see if you can shadowmeld spells depending on ping. But it's not nearly as good as stoneskin/fearward
---
Most people aren't going to get to choose a legendary though
---
I am.......mankriks wife
---
Yeah, he goes in and out of combat. You can tell by the level icon under the face plate.
---
Vanilla WoW does not have to be a big commitment. People who want to kill Ragnaros  in the first month have a big commitment. Others can take 2 years to reach that goal if they choose. The goals you set and how much of your free time you spend playing WoW is entirely up to you.
---
I've done all 3 and considered it worth it, yes even blacksmithing. You will need to go out of your way to farm mats and keep your skills topped off, but if you can focus your questing and grinding on areas that are rich in mats you need, it's not a huge slow down. The thing people have against trade skills is the gear isn't often as good as what you can get from dungeons or even some random drops at the same level. HOWEVER, trade skill gear is guaranteed. Tradeskills mean you don't need to grind the shit out of some instances or pray for lucky green drops or pay exhorberant prices on the AH. Tradeskills are also a great way to network with other players, it's an MMO after all. You can craft gear for guildies and friends. Often if you get known as a person who does this people will start sending you random materials and recipes they don't need.
---
PvP.
---
I tried playing on a PvE server and I can't do it.  
---
Plus I am all about phase 2, I wouldn't want to miss that bloodbath for the world.
---
Counter point: horrendous purchasing power, no seasons, out of control homelessness/literal shit on the streets, stifling taxes, overpopulated
---
Haha sorry, yeah, with the additional caveat of people with addiction issues or who use it as an emotional crutch being unable to regulate their time invested in it. Find that fun baby.
---
I'm real stuck between picking warlock or mage, I'd be doing primarily pvp, dungeons and _maybe_ raids later on.
---
I'm leaning more towards warlock because people say sm/ruin is good in both pve &amp; pvp so I wouldn't have to re-spec.
---
Is there a mage spec that can do both well?
---
We ran guilds by these rules on a few different P-Servers, for a few years somewhat succesful. Most of it is written by myself. This is by no means the gold standard or won't work for every guild. But feel free to use it as inspiration for your own endeavours.

Illegal?
---
For me, it fits the class fantasy. My Tauren Druid went Skinning/Leatherworking which fit with the idea of using all the parts of the animals I killed. I'd never consider going Mining/Engineering on a Shaman or Druid for instance because ripping the earth apart to make explosives and mechanical stuff just doesn't fit my class fantasy of either. Likewise, I'd never take Skinning on a Mage, since I can't see a practitioner of the arcane arts getting their hands dirty cutting up a bunch of animal carcasses. 
---
In terms of items, it gives you a nice sense of progression too. And there's something about wearing an item that has your name on it.
---
Well it's counted in the bis lists already for the most part
---
There is a darkmoon faire card that procs off your spirit
---
Paladin does not use it because it has no spirit talent. Both druids and priests do because they have a spirit talent. Pretty much the end of that
---
It should be factored in already
---
Is there a coherent thought somewhere in this? I can’t find it
---

Interesting, did the United Nations ratify an agreement about some kind of world-wide enforceable copyright-protection-law that I am not aware of?
---
And without the excersie we weon't need to save money for old age either! ;)
---
I'm excited to have class identity back in the game.
---
Man,  I would really welcome the challenge. 
---
Agreed, if I'm gonna die it's out out of a poly cs combo.... but if I make it through that... game on lol
---
Is little timmy going to have a white kitten and is it gonna be worth a shit ton of gold on AH?
---
Better than the 50 millionth photo of a game box/manual/guide. Or generic internet picture #377525 with class logo or classic stuck on it.
---
I'm in the "don't do it" camp. BfA is not a fun game.
---
PvP
---
Vanilla is all about the open world. You have to be able to fight the horde for control of world bosses, black lotus, devilsaur, rich thorium veins, and most obviously that sweet sweet honor. Ranking will be a pain in the butt on a pve server lol
---
If you're coming to play in an immersive world...Which is the obvious appeal I think PvP is better.
---
In 2004 I don't think that argument would be the same simply because there was no retail better tailored to people who don't want to be in an immersive word. They want a lobby game where they raid/craft/talk to their friends. 
---
In the first pvp phase on PvP servers the whole place will be a WARZONE. That feeling will not be replicated on PvE servers. Which is why they die in the private server scene. 
---
Now you might have some other ideas about why you want to play classic. Like pure nostalgia and don't want to be ganked cuz you know u work a lot and won't be 60 for months. But you'd be cheating yourself if you're going to put a lot of effort into the game especially early in servers lives.

Back in Classic days we used a hidden bid system. You would whisper your Bid to the lootmaster and the guy with the highest bid would get his item for his bid. Was fairley quick for DKP. But big downside is that you have to trust the guy doing the auction. If he's corrupt and tell's his buddy for example what the competition is bidding, that guy could save lots of DKP's.
---
Good question. With all the knowledge we have about classic now it's going to be hard to play the same- for me anyway.
---
Back on Vanilla I rolled a Ret paladin to 60 which was the most boring job ever I later found out- could not do That again. I think that now though, the specs considered not viable before will be treated a little more leniently as on psevers for example we see lots of warriors at endgame Not tanking.
---
I was the 13 year old kid who didn't take profession's because I didn't see the point/ it slowed me down. This time, if I roll a Rogue I'll take skinning and Herbalism and if I choose warrior, mining and engineering.
---
I'll be More casual this time round, making random conversations with people and worrying less about whether I'll be server first for anything.
---
A full time job, part time study and trying for a baby makes for a lot less free time.
---
I already had to lock in my vacation, so I'm pretty sure Classic will release on the last day of vacation :P
---
If you're leveling at leisurely pace, then you should be able to gather enough mats to get a few worthwhile pieces.
---
If you're trying to level fast, then crafting professions are not worth the time investment
---
I think Sept is highly likely, and yes technically summer.  100% chance of a beta. Server team would quit without be being allowed some proper stress testing.
---
Let me ask you first ... on what are you going to focus? ... 
---
- pvp
---
- questing 
---
- raiding 
---
... also about end game, what do you aim for? ...
---
- end game raids 
---
- end game pvp 
---
... answer these questions and we will try to help you more accurately:)
---
Sad to say i agree. I had hoped to one day attend a blizzcon, but that desire has very much died out over the last few years. I shall keep some hope alive for Classic, but will sadly hope to see blizzard crash and burn soon. Beats this current iteration of them.
---
I'll play some Diablo 3 (Season 17) while waiting for Classic!
---
How a guy with 0 political experience can win the hardest political race with 4 hours of sleep a night?
---
I enjoyed it. It added more flavor to leveling up and then when you did get to max level you didn't need to run around in a bunch of low level zones for no reason.
---
I didn't max it before I hit 60 though. I prefer mostly keeping up with it and then spending the last 75 points at 60 when you're best suited for finding those high level mats.
---
&gt;"...if the target is killed *by you* while you drain its soul."
---
I played Priest in vanilla so my experience with Warlock is from private servers and it's possible that they have it wrong, but based on the language of the talent it seems that you have to be the one to kill it.
---
I was a noob ret pally that befriended my servers best guild "raid bangers" and they let me join they took me along and we cleared nax and they geared me with good gear and weapons i contributed next to nothing i was 12 at the time but they told me what to do and i listened... i stopped playing because i could not afford the next expansion. I didnt realize how big of an accomplishment it was untill recent when i decided i wanted to try classic. My first epic was from the spider boss that 2hd mace that was made from bones lol.
---
Perfect guild is cooperates, communicates, solves problems together and has little drama.
---
The perfect GM is a good leader, makes toughs decisions, know who to rely on, how to recruit and most importantly delegate. GM does NOT have to be the raid leader.
---
Thunderfury on combat rogue with a lot of +hit and +weaponskill
---
I mean I'd die every other boss pull from pulling aggro but it would be worth it
---
Does the aura effect of Atiesh stack with another Atiesh of the same kind? Because in Classic a highend guild will likely get several Atiesh over the year.
---
chances are if you're leveling at an average pace, people who would have engineering won't have it leveled enough for it to really matter. those that do will probably be 60 and you'll be getting ganked so it won't matter :P Might be more important the longer from launch. as more people will have 60s and might be doing an alt with engineering as they're leveling.
---
When I leveled with crafting Tailoring and LW, I would only craft very specific pieces (and bags) to use as upgrades. The rest of crafting was just for points to 300. 
---
For example, as Tailor, the Dreamweave pieces are great for casters/healers and are surprisingly easy to craft. Those pieces will last until bis at 60.
---
For LW, I would target the Barbaric stuff for dps or the Turtle pieces if I was Shaman healing and focus the rest on points until bis crafts or random upgrades if quests didn't offer anything (like still using that +1 stamina boots at lvl 35).
---
Is this worth it? Kinda depends on your perspective. To me, it was just enough use to "justify" it, but also enough non-use to not interrupt the leveling process. For example, "Hey cool, just gotta focus on getting to level x then I get my upgrade for prebis."
---
Thats fair. I agree, they should definitely try to do a public beta, that way they know what to expect on launch day.
---
Make it public, and you also get an idea of how many people will be playing on launch day.
---
Negatory - drain soul always yields a shard but imp drain soul buff is only if you kill it - not some other source like your pet.
---
For the same reason, it is important to stand and walk around on long flights.
---
“95% bots and account sharers, and the other half will be premades setting up a ranking cartel”
---
The other half ? So 190% total
---
Not true. The (nerfed) Ring of Protection has the most armor in the game with 150. 
---
I shouldn't have said "none" of the better rings don't have bonus armor, because they do. The Twin Emps Ring + Naxx ring have bonus armor. But you won't get those until you're so decked out that it doesn't even matter. Ring of Protection lasts 95% of the game. You pair it with the Heavy Dark Iron Ring from MC.
---
Thunderfury for warrior tanks
---
Depends on your IRL situation. Druids can be very fun, but as others have said, pet classes are very strong for soloing content, and if you get interrupted frequently during gameplay, a cat pet + shadowmeld lets you go afk pretty much anywhere. As for groups, druids will be expected to heal for the most part in 5 mans, which is kinda counterintuitive to a solo mentality. Hunters are very good for dungeons, as they don't compete much for gear and have a strong toolkit for CC. Also kiting Drakkisath is fun.  
---
If you like the shapeshifting fun of druid though, a hunter won't do, otherwise I'd say nelf hunter being the ultimate mom class/race combo.
---
It's gonna be a NICCCCCEEEEEEE ride to work though.
---
Amazing work! Will you be adding "Approaching Tyr's Hand" to your Inprnt print shop?
---
You’re too hung up on the whole world pvp thing. It’s really not a big deal while leveling. You might get ganked a few times but there won’t be any epic battles where you see a bunch of lowbies with engeering items fighting it out.
---
Lol no need to get emotional buddy. I’m simply stating that a lvl 1 caster missing half their spells is not how it was. A “guessed” value on a privately ran server is incorrect, imagine that! :D
---
Holy shit you're deluded.
---
I think the idea is it speeds up wand casting
---
Found the hunter
---
My wife will be playing with me, gonna be a solid way to save $$ lol.
---
I believe you said the way that they were implemented made two classes in particular too strong, and I'm explaining to you why that is not a true statement. Those classes are strong in 2's no matter how you design arenas.
---
&gt;Will you be playing a PvP server or PvE server?
---
PvE, unless a lot of my friends go PvP, then I will join them. 
---
&gt;Why?
---
I don't like world PvP. 95% of the time it's unbalanced enough that the outcome of the fight is more or less already predetermined either in your favor, or your enemy's. It becomes a game of ganking and getting ganked, not fun and engaging PvP battles. 
---
I also generally hate griefing in PvP games. In for example battlegrounds or duels the whole point is to be killing each other, which is fine. But in world PvP most people are trying to do other things, and the only thing you add to their playing experience by trying to kill them is frustration. And I don't like making other people frustrated, feels pretty dickish. 
---
&gt;Are the differences really noticeable?
---
Very. Levelling on a PvE server is really chill, you can be half afk watching netflix or whatever and don't have to worry about anything. On PvP servers it's not uncommon having to skip entire quests, maybe even zones, just because of the constant ganking going on there. Also you don't get the 1337 kidz who think they are WoW gods and everyone else are noobs because they don't play undead rogue or whatever. There's not that many of them though, so it's fine, just thought I would point it out. 
---
&gt;Is one type better than the other?
---
No. 
---
&gt;Trying to decide. I'm not a PvPer, but it feels like PvP servers are more popular and "cooler"
---
There tend to be more people on PvP servers, yes. As for "cooler". Who cares about that?
---
&gt;Are there going to be high population PvE servers?
---
Yes. There will be more people playing on PvP servers, but assuming Blizzards does their realm distribution right, there will also be more PvP servers, so individual realm populations are not affected by that. 
---
&gt;Do I even want a high pop server?
---
As long as you don't have huge queues, yes. It's easier making groups, recruiting into guilds, and finding a guild on high population servers. Drawback is increased competition for world resources and bosses, and potentially higher prices on items affected by that. 
---
&gt;How are you picking your server?
---
1. Where my friends go. 
---
2. PvE
---
3. One with a name I like.
---
Sulfuron for my dwarf retribution paladin
---
You'd die on day 1 depending on how much you play lol.
---
This is one hell of a bad system glad it disappeard
---
I mean, and take it how you will...Classic can only go so long before I've done most of the things I want to do. Eventually I'll complete all of the things I want and there will only be rolling a new character or running the same dungeons and raids and PVP. Don't get me wrong, it's ALL going to be awesome and fun. But eventually I'll be done. So I'm not dropping everything to no life Classic for months to finish it as fast as possible. That would be fucking stupid and no lifeing things and crushing it out ASAP is one reason why WoW has ended up in the state it's in. 
---
So I'll keep playing League and Rainbow6. Halo 3 is coming to PC and that will absolutely take a big chunk of my time when it finally drops. There are tons of other games I'd like to play too. WoW will likely be my main game, but I want other games to help stretch out how long until I complete WoW as well as to help avoid burnout.
---
Why is it different story? Really no difference in 55 or 60 killing you
---
You are not gonna want to read this, just fair warning, but..
---
You're not a corporation m8. It is dangerous thinking for you, as an individual, to in any way presume that corporations are your friends. It is dangerous for all of us as consumers of an industry. They are not like to listen to your feedback, your desires or, evidently, respect your personal rights in any way (see their latest spyware requirement for one) in any meaningful way. Sure they will feed you a scrap here, a mock victory there, but always things of little import. What the majority of players want is not the incentive, nor is there any inherent desire to adhere to previous principles such as gameplay first. They will go where the money is, and that means mobile games, micro transactions and whale-gambling (if you are unfamiliar with those terms feel free to ask)
---
There was a time when trust and community between players and devs were an essential tool in marketing and development. The problem is that in todays industry, devs are not so much the ones making the games as the ones pressing the buttons to do whatever corporates latest algorithms have decided they do.
---
I know, it is not a pleasant thing to think about, but the blizzard we've known since we bought our first PC is very much dead and buried. Every last person of talent and integrity has fled the company over the years, and for good reason. At present we are at best being served up the corpse of their principles by activision. I would to romanticize the notion that we the players made Classic happen, but more likely it is coming about due to the current trend of reselling our childhood to us (the number of examples of this is staggering across all of pop culture, video games included)
---
And Priests!
---
Or it's for auction house purposes, or just to provide bags of all sizes to players. Or in the case of tailoring it is a way to have a standalone crafting profession in order to pair with enchanting. I know I'm going to do tailoring and enchanting and keep them that way at 60 in order to make some gold and help out players.
---
I’ve learned explaining logic is fruitless on Reddit. So let’s just skip to trading some “you’re retarded”s, maybe a “fuck you” for variety, downvote each other and move on.
---
Druids have the most tools of any class for soloplay and 5 man play. You can tank, dps, heal, cc, stealth and more as 1 spec in 1 class. You are completely self sufficient as a Druid. In 5 mans, you can save wipes in bad pulls and fill any gap.
---
In Vanilla, druids were primarily sought after as only healers until the perception started to fade (after patches hit) and people saw what druids could actually do. Since we will be starting post Vanilla, I believe druids will be in high demand (5 mans) for healing, tanking and even dps  because of their hybrid abilities.
---
Roflmao
---
From a vanilla perspective this is naively adorable because we all know exactly how much work from how many players, usually an entire field effort, goes into obtaining legendary weapons.
---
&gt; For example, as Tailor, the Dreamweave pieces are great for casters/healers and are surprisingly easy to craft. Those pieces will last until bis at 60.
---
These are the kind of hidden gems I was looking for. Those items are pretty cool!
---
Tailoring is. Backs for yourself, your alts, and to sell extras. Everyone needs bags. Also the gear is decent, but there are several good pieces for certain classes scattered across the leveling Space. Some lowbie fire/frost gears, Robe of Power in the early 30's, spell damage gear becoming more readily available 30+, the shadoweave suit of gear for a mid-game +shadow set, Dreamweave for a nice +damage/healing suit craftable options for late game Pre-raid sets to start building a damage suit. 
---
The BoP patterns are pretty solid (Truefaith Vestments and Robe of the Arch-Magi especially being competitive choices with some neat bonuses, Robe of the Void doesn't really offer much compared to Robe of Winter Night, aside for a pet heal and slightly more damage by a couple points, but stam instead of int.
---
LWing is kinda meh due to the huge material requirements and lacks in Pop till basically the end.
---
BSing in a lot of ways is even worse as most of the gear is just awful till the end, and even then it's hordenously expensive and a lot of the really good stuff won't be available for years. (since we're post-Normalization a lot of previously really strong stuff has become fairly meh compared to easier to acquire drops).
---
Nah, you will pretty much have to respecc as a Mage. Good thing is they are the best farmers in game and can make over 100g/hr when ZG comes out.
---

I actually had no idea this channel existed.

Az osszes bojleremet odaadnam egy kepert.

And my Axe.

Yes yes. But with a green ribbon, cos druid.
---
The same company that put diablo on mobile.
---
You can drop q and take it again for summon. Same with maws from scepter quest and other quest bosses
---
It’s referred to as the imp triangle. 
---
I’m quite sure Kargoz has a picture of it in his Warlock levelling guide
---
Do you reread the thing that you type? Is it physically painful for you to deal with an opinion that doesn't match your own? Are you a troll? It's hard to tell based on how you've acted in this thread
---
If you can clear it with 10 empty spots why is there a need to be optimal?
---
Oh you're right I forgot.  It's a pretty crap talent anyway.
---
The Mage's [Winter's Chill spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E00fZZVA0cRfzVo) is used by one Mage in the raid, and you could probably swap around some talents to find a build that fits your playstyle.
---
A build like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E00fZZVVGhobtho) sacrifices reduced mana cost, spell hit chance, Improved Blizzard, Winter's Chill, and Frost spell damage in favor of increased CC and burst. If you're just doing dungeons &amp; PvP but not raiding or organized BGs, you don't need Winter's Chill, +hit, or Improved Blizzard. Not having reduced mana cost on Frostbolt might be annoying in dungeons, but I feel like this is generally the style of build you're looking for.
---
&gt;Is there a mage spec that can do both well?
---
You have to take too many talents that don't jive well in Raiding. You'll be playing a bastardised version of an arcane/frost spec that won't be as optimal as a full PvE spec or full PvP spec.
---
Not that it won't work, you just won't be min/max.
---
imo it all boils down to the playstyle. Does the mage playstyle of control, frontloaded damage and high mobility appeal to you? Or does the facetank, pet control and DoT style damage appeal to you?
---
*Dr. Oz’s breakthrough science that suggests an Evocation every 8 minutes prevents blood clots!*
---
Winter’s Chill spec is great for pve and works decently in pvp. It’s a support spec so your own dps doesn’t matter and you can pick up many pvp talents.
---
What’s Azuregos and Dragons of Nightmare?
---
Did anyone even care about healing charts in vanilla? IIRC people didn't really give a shit about HPS until like WotLK. As long as no one was dying no one cared.
---
Me and my friends drove from San Diego down to Irvine just to explore and we ended up at Blizzard at around 2AM. Security was really cool about letting us take some pics especially that late. 
---
Also Irvine is fucking gorgeous.
---
Stay fury with tank gear for dungeons. So much better than prot
---
I don't have to worry about that when I already call myself an addict.
---
Your sky looks prettier, but it's also more distracting.
---
You'll notice that in the second picture, the sky has more contrast and detail than the castle, so it becomes the focal point, taking the viewer's attention away from what should actually matter: Stormwind's walls, statues, and gates.
---
This is why a shitty sky looks better than a detailed sky if the rest of the world is low on detail (like 2004 WoW)
---
I'm just playing on a tbc private server so I don't burnt out on classic content
---
Only one character and they're in Outland
---
I want it, me, so druid.  
---
That's a joke, not that druids shouldn't be eligible, but going by raid efficiency it should be mage or warlock, not sure which is the more powerful of the two group buffs, 33 Spd or 2% spell crit.
---
Is 'Ey Mann wo is mein Mount' the German translation for 'Dude Where's My Car'? That's kinda funny.
---
Yeah by the time you're in Naxx most hybrids will have a few sets
---
Good thing priests have a push-back solution in PW:S.
---
Definitely* communication is the only thing good leaders seem to accidentally fuck up in my experience.
---
I prefer the original, because a detailed sky takes attention away from the landscape.
---
Can it please just release already!?!?
---
Problem is you only have 1 mage in a raid running winter's chill.
---
Tailor/Skinning is pretty solid but you'd be doing it in a weird way. Since, rogues are squishier, weapon based, and have no limit on resource generation (like rage/mana), you'd want to grind out mobs that are lower level and easier to kill in 1 ambush, gouge, backstab, eviscerate, type of combo. Pickpocket humanoids and kill them in loops for tons of boxes and cloth when you are able to 1-3 shot them. 
---
For skinning, it's the same process. Kill stuff thats super easy to kill and in demand like deviates for belts and the like. I wouldn't expect a rogue to be farming same level mobs until further into gearing. Try to stick with yellow or even green mobs for maximum killage per bandage stop. As a stealthy, you can get into farming locations that would otherwise suck to get into/out of.
---
Wow that view distance
---
If my years of programming have taught me anything, it's that changing anything in a system can fuck up things in very unexpected ways.
---
I never said it was a realistic goal
---
Hey, thank you! :) I just added it now!
---
This is a great art style! Do you have any way to upload higher quality pictures of them so I could use them as a background?
---
Nice ! Thanks a lot :) I might want to go for it then since I almost won’t be raiding, going for pvp only ;)
---
Ive always wanted to see blizz hq and meet the devs and managers etc and i live in finland, now you telling me you fking live next to the place. damn... Life is cruel.
---
Ah cool cool, that's what I wanted to hear, thanks!
---
It's just a little RP fun man. If you had to pick one, which one would you take? But I see I brought out that inner Hunter inside you
---
Yeah and that can be OP. No Mage likes playing the WC spec. So to have some willingly do it is always nice.
---
I quit playing games couple of years ago. Looking forward to some old school wow
---
I mean, hand of rag doesn't really even belong in this picture.... Half the classes that would use it would prefer many other non legendary drops of rag or common drops off BWL bosses for weapons.
---
Thank you! I wanted to improve a bit more before I start doing these again (a real passion project for me), but I think I'm feeling more confident now :)
---
You need to get a new one, which is why Feral DPS is only an option for super tryhards
---
Hunter weapon.
---
The lesser of several evils for me
---
Every day you need to throw a brick tied with a threat that gets more and more severe as time goes on.
---
So I’m going Holy Pally main, Mage Alt, then some alts later for fun. I’m gonna try to have them hit 60 in the same week or two, maximizing the amount of rested XP I can get. But there’s a few things to consider... here’s my plan.
---
1. Level both my Pally and Mage to 6, park in Goldshire. Pool money to the mage to buy a lesser magic wand, level to 10-18 or so. Buy green weps from the AH for my Paladin to make leveling bearable, one for every 5 lvls at least. 
---
2. Get both toons around 20, and level one toon ahead of the other. The Pally will probably be a little higher and have more /played, so they can be the first to 40 for that free mount. I’ll let the mage lay behind 5-10 levels, so if I see a dungeon group forming, I have a much wider bracket to choose from. Like, if my mage is 21, and my Pally is 28, I can do Deadmines, SFK, BFD, Stockades, RFK, and SM:GY and still get decent xp. At launch, there will be lots of dungeon groups, but less than private server players like me will expect. The population will be 3x smaller than the 9-11k pops we saw on the latest big cheese server, so this should help find dungeons easily.
---
3. Get my Pally to the 55-57 range ASAP so I can swap to heal spec and start doing max level dungeons for that sweet gear. If I’m gonna run BRD, Scholo, Strath, and LBRS over and over I may as well get XP for it. And while I’m finishing up those last few levels, when there’s no groups formed, I’ll be stayin frosty on my mage, 5-10 levels behind still, but catching up at this phase when my Pally is just healing.
---
What do you do for money?
---
Woahhhh
---
I think I might lose my job. Especially when they catch me playing wow non stop. If not then I’ll be getting real sick. /cough
---
That's a great idea! :) I just want to avoid spamming people with this as much as I can, and I'm worried the same posts would appear for people who are subscribed to wow related threads in general
---
PVP servers make the game feel more alive to me. PVP servers essentially keep the spirit of Classic WoW baked into their rules. You get ganked and corpse camped? That sucks, you should probably log into another character or go play another game, right? 
---
WRONG! Fucking WRONG. You know what you do? You message friends on your FL and see if any of them are free to come over and help you kill the ganking Orc. Get in general and see if anyone else on the map can help. So you kill and corpse camp the orc. 
---
So HE messages his friends and they all come to kill the Ally scum up to their old tactics of being higher level and roaming in groups to kill innocent orc who is just adventuring and didn't do anything wrong. They show up and suddenly you have 20 or so real people gathering up and tensions rise. It's like the BFA cinematic where Sylvanas shouts for the horde and you get fucking chills because you remember grouping with other people you've never met or barely know but you're now good friends because they rallied to you when you called. So you /s FOR THE HORDE! as you charge the alliance line and kick off this fight. Or maybe you're the priest running from the crazy warrior who is focusing you and none of your allies are peeling him off you but it's all good because you have MC and you run him off before throwing out healing and protection for your allies. You guys were losing but you're putting everyone back on their feet and you know you gotta inspire them so of course you answer back with a /s FOR THE ALLIANCE! 
---
Eventually you end up back in Stormwind a few days later and you see Mjcleavage, the human female warrior who was tunnel vision, but dat DPS tho. So you give her a /wave and they wave back. You wont forget that time you got together and killed the Horde. Good times....good times. 
---
If you're playing on a PVE server, you're not a pussy. You're not a carebear. You're not playing wrong. Anyone who says any of that is just being an asshole and you shouldn't be made to feel bad for your choice. BUT, I think by choosing to play on a PVE server, you're missing out on a big part of what made Classic WoW so good. Just like dungeons and raids, you might not always get a group for world PVP instantly or no one might answer your call. Or maybe only 2-3 answer but there is a deathball of about 6 Alliance members rolling across killing you all. Maybe you lose the fight and have to retreat and level in another zone for a bit. But you made some friends and you'll remember that at least they tried. And there is no better feeling than seeing the general chat light up asking for help so you go to investigate since you were just here leveling fishing or something and you notice that the asshole giving your ally trouble is 10 levels under you and you smirk. 
---
Or hell, maybe you start to recognize someone from the enemy faction BECAUSE they're good at PVP. Maybe you build a sort of begrudging respect for someone you constantly see. There is also something GREATER about coming across someone from another factions and interacting with them. On PVE servers, you see another faction character and it's whatever. You can't talk to them, so you both just walk by each other no problem. 
---
Imagine you're walking down the road and you see the unmistakable shape of a Tauren. Too far away to click on to see their level, but close enough you know it's another player. And they're walking down the same road as you. What do you do? Are you a night elf or a rogue? Maybe you should stealth. Hunter? Use the animal sight spell or lay some traps while you run off trail to hide. Do you walk closer to them but keep a distance so you can get away? What if the road is surrounded by aggro enemies? If you try to run you might get dazed or just have to deal with a player and a mob (or 2). You have to make a decision, the Tauren is closer. You click him and see he's 8 levels above you. You recognize some of his gear peices and you doubt you could win the fight. You know he's seen you and you know you can't win the fight. You have to start thinking. Any guards nearby? Any towns you can duck into? Where is your hearth set? You turn to run the other way and you see another Tauren coming up behind you. Aw shit. This one is closer to your level. You can win this. You have to end it quickly before you're surrounded. You jump on the attack and go all out. You fight and are getting close to killing him when you see his HP dart back up. The Shaman Tauren who was further away is healing him. The weaker Tauren stops attacking and sheaths his weapon and emotes at you /no then the shaman /points at you then /no as well. They /wave and both walk down the path you were coming from. They...didn't want to fight, but just in case you wanted to, they had to stack the odds in their favor. You can't tell them thank you, but hey...maybe not ALL horde are bad right? MAAAYBE when you reach max level and are decked out, you'll only camp orc undead and troll lowbies and let all Tauren pass.

Thanks, I thought of it myself.
---
Druids can usually just face-tank stuff hunters and locks would usually use pets on. Throw up some Hots, bear form, rip it's face off (Or cat form if you know the damage won't be enough to kill you).
---
Doesn't always work, but neither does Hunter (needs room to kite/outrange) or Lock (MUCH weaker if it can't be feared), since their pets can't compare to what a Bear Druid can do in terms of tanking ability, and will usually get squashed almost instantly by anything really dangerous (especially Blueberry, a Turtle and Crab can be spec'd to make a pretty decent tank though still not on Bear Druid level (and no where near Dire Bear level).
---
So they're really about the same. they all have a weakness for their non-face-tanking method that depends on environment and circumstances.

If you get lucky or see the pattern on the AH, the [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10301/pattern-white-bandit-mask](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10301/pattern-white-bandit-mask) is AMAZING for enchanting. This would de into a nice amount of Vision Dust, the SUPER needed Nether Essence and sometimes even small radiant shard (fiery).
---
Goldshire - Elwynn forest may be.
---
I remember when I created my first char (nelf Hunter) and was making the trek through the wetlands, my friend who got me into wow told me about that channel so I could avoid any attacks on the way.
---
Moment I join it starts screaming about Wetlands under attack, right as I'm arriving on the boat.
---
You really capture the feeling in the monotone color. It reminds me of how EPL actually looks like on screen, so much so that I didn’t make the connection until I saw it in your art. From a lore perspective, EPL should be stagnant in the diseased aftermath of the culling. I think you captured it here. Very impressed!
---
Thank you! I upload all my stuff to this site if you are interested: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/)
---
Counterquestion for non vanilla players (trying to say in a way that isnt eletist is hard, i tried) 
---
which one do you think requires the most time to obtain?
---
Thank you! :) Yup, most of the art I make I also upload here for prints: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/)
---
I mentioned that, but if you are grinding mobs you really don't want to be using mana on shield. Just let them beat on you while wanding and you can toss a renew on yourself if needed at the start of the next mob, or while moving to the next area.
---
I would die if you painted Nagrand. You did the Tirisfal paintings too, right? I love your painting style, and as much as I love the style of the lordaeron zones, a painting of Nagrand would be in my prized possessions. 
---
Also, do you have a place to purchase these?
---
Ennél nagyobb kitüntetés már nem is kell szerintem :D (Köszi szépen!)
---
Yeah but having an actual properly speced prot Warrior is like butter. So much easier.
---
Can someone explain to me how wanding works for priests, and how it plays into the rotation while leveling?
---
I can’t think of a reason why it would or could. Agility doesn’t effect attack speed for any attack in the game as far as I know, it only gives crit and ap(for some classes).
---
They are all digital - I use Procreate and Photoshop with as many textured brushes as possible :)
---
He asked how many druids are usually brought to raids. Which what I answered to him.
---
Then you "expand" on it by saying that you saw someone bring 4-5 druids to naxx?! 
---
Ok, congratulations on watching a video...
---
I saw a video of 40 priests killing ony, now what?
---
Also, every fucking class and spec is viable and has been used to clear all raids. 
---
You can clear every raid with 30 people, does that mean that every guild should only bring 30 people?
---
Maybe you should chill the fuck out and learn how properly "expand" on someone's answer.
---
hmm that's true, thanks!
---
I would love to know what it is like to be wired this way.
---
On the other hand, the feeling of pure unadulterated joy I get from getting lost in something I am passionate about is one of the greatest feelings to me.  I can ride a wave like that for years.
---
Thunderfury for my dwarf protection warrior.
---
Like in game?
---
To be honest, it's BiS. Even though that proc spells murder, if you can stay alive, it's BiS. Hands down.
---
Would you prefer to be stuck in a raid for 2+ hours, or clear it in less than hour?
---
I was clinically depressed and alienated my friends and gf in that time period. It wasn’t a pretty picture.
---
That's exp waste bro. You ain't gunna max that way
---
My warrior had every legendary possible up until I quit. Even the Sunwell bow ^^. It was a fun time collecting. Took me 54 weeks for my first binding to drop.
---
Even then, there's going to be a ton of account sharing because it's almost 100% about who can be online the most rather than most efficient/best premade/etc
---
Shh don't give them any ideas
---
Hahahahahaha
---
I was an 8 year old noob huntard who only made it to 55. I don’t think more casual is an option this time. I also really want to clear Naxxramas with a guild, so badly. I only experienced Naxx in WotLk. The atmosphere and bosses were excellent, but it’s obvious that Naxx got neutered harder than Mr. Bigglesworth.
---
Hey, thanks man :) Yup, I also posted some Tirisfal stuff here a few months ago. Nagrand is in the plans for sure, but still far ahead in the future (I follow the original travelogue, and Outland has to come after Classic) - but I will def try to pick up the pace :)
---
(And yes I try to upload all my prints to Inprnt: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/ )
---
Dunno if im interested in maxing tbh. OSRS doesnt get any new skills, the only new content is PVM , PVP has been completely abandoned.
---
Ive lost all hope and faith, and really I just want to move forward with vanilla.
---
Okay. That's too far. Now get out.
---
Corrupted Ashbringer is the easiest. It's actually NOT that bad of a drop rate.
---
Sulfuras is the second easiest. It requires a semi bad drop rate drop off Ragnaros to do, basically.
---
Atiesh actually ISN'T that hard, it just requires several weeks of clearing.
---
Thunderfury is arguably the hardest, purely based off of the fact that the Bindings need to drop off ONE specific boss, two different bindings 1 per boss, and it's a horrendously low drop percentage change.
---
Based off those facts, I'd say hands down Thunderfury is the worst.
---
Leveling with a partner is extremely common, leveling up with 10 people killing shit for you is absurd, what a stupid comparison.
---
Welcome to reddit my man. So unforgiving :/
---
I'd suggest Warlock, for sure, in your case. That will give you a good amount of solo potential (voidwalker), group potential (summoning, hs, ss) and the tier sets look pretty good. I have never experienced a situation in all of wow when someone said, "Naw, don't bring the warlock". You will even have the option to go no micro, heavy micro or even petless if you don't like the pet ai (sacrifice).
---
I'll be paying for my classic playtime with wow tokens I've earned during this snoozefest of an expansion. At least the gold making has been good!
---
did a druid with leatherworking in vanilla -- and had the hide of the wild pattern -- that paid itself a few times over.
---
Well, these are my go-to resolutions for my online portfolio, but if you PM me your email, (and the one(s) you'd like in a higher res) I can send it to you that way :)
---
It’s always nice to see people claim nostalgia when people who are experiencing it for the first time also like it. I’ve gone back and have played games that I never got around to, that ended up being better then their more recent installments (Some FE and Pokémon games) and it’s always odd to still hear the ‘nostalgia’ card.
---
Casual is Define by the amount of time put into the game and nothing else. It's certainly not defined by what's gear you get. It's not defined by The Raid bosses you kill because plenty of people put 40 hours a week into raiding guilds and get nothing done.
---
It's about how much time you put into the game. The game is not casual, players can be casual. And again, so-called popular vanilla streamers would probably say just about anything to try to encourage battle for Azeroth players to not only try vanilla but also to give them their revenue clicks.
---
Would be nice if we get a date, bosses keep asking me about putting my vacation time in
---
Very cool!
---
Why do you want to remove fences, what did they ever do to you?
---
The guild I was in in vanilla used this a dkp system like this.
---
Items had a blanket minimum of 20 for current tier, 10 for off tier.  Off spec  and alts were always half price (but they could only bid if no mains wanted for main spec)
---
An officer would take silent bids.  If the highest bid was 20 or more than the next highest, they paid 2nd highest bid + 20.
---
If the next highest bid was less than 20 lower, both players did weighted rolls.  For example.
---
Person 1 bids 30 and rolls 1-100
---
Person 2 bids 40 and rolls 51-100
---
Items in tier often had class/spec restrictions as well to help with progression.  For example, an item like DFT was probably limited to rogues and fury warriors until AQ came out.
---
Legendaries were assigned by officers.  Everyone knew well ahead of time who was getting them too.
---
Using that system we were the top guild in progression when I quit in vanilla.
---
--
---
The important thing about a bid system, however, is to always, always use proxy bidding.  Even if you do straight "highest bid wins", the winner should never pay more than 2nd highest bid + X, that way there is absolutely no benefit gained if a corrupt officer tells someone how much others bid.
---
DoT Novice: immolate + corruption + agony + drain soul (level 10)
---
DoT Apprentice: above + siphon life (level 30), bonus points for drain life and nightfall procs
---
DoT Master: above + Dark Pact (level 40); you turn into a multi-DoTing, mob-juggling monster with virtually no downtime (imp = juicy mana battery)
---
JFC. Never doing that. Don't get why anyone will attempt to. Unless you're a full time wow streamer like Asmon or something.
---
when i used to play private servers i looked at it this way: 
---
on retail blizzard would basically wipe my characters every two years or so anyway. no, my stuff wouldn't be gone, but it would also not be useful; no better than a level 70 in new greens. my old level 70s for TBC on retail are useless compared to what they were in TBC.
---
so to me there is a "wipe" every two years or so anyway. if a private server makes it to two years it already took my character further than blizzard ever did.
---
Twink Glory day’s are coming back.
---
+15 agility or Crusader?
---
depends how long between phase2 and 3 but yes its possible
---
Still have to finish Dark Souls 3, BioShock Infinite, Farcry 5, Resident Evil 7 and XCOM 2. 
---
Got my work cut out for me until Classic drops.
---
I'm bone dry of games at the moment. Literally nothing can grab my interest atm. Started a new playthrough on a modded New Vegas but that's about it. After seeing Borderlands 3 along with the anticipation for WoW classic... got no games that can satisfy the empty void. So yeah, Classic and BL3 will prob be the 2 games I only play/buy this year.
---
There's no choice for cloth casters. Hunters can't get Atiesh (thank fuck) but cloth casters really only want Atiesh. Even resto Druids.
---
And \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\] is a tank weapon so prot warriors have their choice given to them.
---
Sulfuron and Corrupted Ashbringer are PvP weapons mostly I think unless 2H Fury.
---
The one that just released Naxx
---
I think the difference is playing for fun and feeling like you had "accomplished" something versus compulsory playing and constantly chasing an unreachable goal.
---
The idea that vanilla was more casual stems from the fact that a large portion of the game was about exploration and leveling... Which anyone can do. Where retail the experience is all about funneling players into "forced" progression systems that are designed more for keeping you subbed than for enjoyment.
---
I think one example of this that I have heard is that reputations (which are just world quest counters) and AP grinds make you feel bad for missing a few days... And your are"behind." Missing a week of playing in vanilla didn't feel as bad
---
First of all I have to congratulate you for your amazing comment, haha I was hooked for a bit reading it.
---
Now, it may sound super strange but I'm actually REALLY looking forward to all of that. While I try to maintain a "normal" life with going out with friends and what not, nothing brings me as much joy as being completely enthralled in a game like this. The feeling of always working towards your next goal, the next level, the next piece of gear, the next gold grind. Slowly playing your way through the world and planning outside of the game what you're gonna do next. Maybe you're almost 30-34 and you need to plan out a group to do Scarlet monastery. Fuck the gear there is so good, and the dungeons are super fun!
---
I'm really looking forward to sitting in office at work, looking away of my monitor while my work saves and uploads, and just thinking what I'm gonna do when I get out of there, what's the next step? Maybe a class quest (oh how I missed them), maybe I really need to get my professions in order that day. And then just going home, loading up the game and grabbing a drink and something to eat and go fucking nuts till I'm too tired to continue, going to bed thinking what next I'm gonna do while falling asleep.
---
Can't fucking wait for Classic
---
Mine was 2k, and worth every penny.
---
Yeah, I don't see myself being in a position where a guild deems me worthy of a legendary. Also, why is corrupted ashbringer on this list, it's just a normal drop.
---
How are tokens pay to win? Sure you can buy gold and buy crafted gear but even in BFA crafted gear is only worth it for fresh max toons. You easily upgrade crafted gear with a world quest or doing a couple mythic dungeons.
---
Account sharing will be a problem, but I'm not sure that botting will be a significant problem. There is a huge investment in a character up to that point, so if Blizzard shows a willingness to take action against bots, it will problem dissuade people from using them for this purpose.
---
I guess if you compare the top end of the game to each other that might hold true, but the leveling process is definitely more casual in modern wow. BFA also has things you can miss out on it if you don't log in and get your shit done for that week / day. Vanilla you could skip a week or two and other then a raid lock out you missed nothing.  
---
Vanilla has more meaning and feeling behind its accomplishments IMO even if they are easier.
---
I will be leaving behind my 4,000 hours of experience in r/playrust
---
Rust is such an amazing game, it saddens me to think that I won’t be touching it for a very long time when classic drops
---
But the call of classic is stronger than ever
---
People have different definitions depending on what suits them. The guy who spends 40 hours a week collecting old mogs considers himself more casual then the guy spending 6 hours a week raiding.
---
It's important to understand everyone has a voice. It's equally important to hear those voices out, validate their feelings, and make hard decisions.  Always lead by example.
---
Most importantly, be authentically you. If you plan to grow and make it large, you will get to know a lot of people. Be the person you'd want to hang out with.  Nothing worse than turning a game in to an awful chore.
---
Well if you always pay what you bid nobody could burn your DKP.
---
Dir example is a jfen and person A buds just the minimum bid of 20 DKP and person B bids 100. B then would get it for a 100. When B placed his bid he had decided that the value of the item would be 100 DKP for him.
---
If you have a system where the winner gets his item by second highest bid +X, there is the possibility of people burning other people's DKP by bidding high just for the sake of removing DKP from the other person.
---
I get what you're saying. The thing is, I'm not dead broke. I'm a social worker and although my job is extremely rewarding, it is not in a monetary sense. I can pay all my bills, and Wow is a very cheap source of entertainment.If wow tokens were available the feeling of farming gold would be completely soured. On private servers farming dire maul tributes gives me a sense of accomplishment. If the tokens were live it would be more efficient for me to pick up an extra shift on my day off and simply buy the for consumables gold instead of playing the game.
---
This might be a better way to put it:
---
In BFA there are way more catch up mechanics with every patch.
---
In vanilla, there were fewer reasons to care that you were behind.
---
That is comforting. Sad to say the future of blizzard looks bleak, as they have very much lost their ideals. Classic has some hope of being the last exception of this we will get. I suspect they will stay well away from bs for the first few years at the least, but could easily see them screwing it up later due to corporate forces that do not know any better having the pull.
---
He can't make his choice when people are telling him that paladins are only good heals while this is not true. But i'm not going to have this Discussion for the 100th time again, so i just agree with you to make it easy and tell him to play hunter or warlock.
---
I was like 9 when I first started playing WoW back in BC, and I knew a LOT of kids my age that played.
---
Can't think of any people whose opinion I value less, especially on Vanilla. 
---
Not saying Vanilla/Classic is so high and mighty, but these two especially are click-baity, contrarian, and claim to be some kind of arbiters of what Vanilla was like.
---
Id say the easiest is either thunderfury or hand of rag, now hear me out: 
---
Hand of rag just required a lot of gold due to the arcanite bars 10,000g~ which lets be honest thats a pretty daunting tasking but it dropped in MC which should be on farm by the time blizzard inteoduces the eye of sulfras drop plus 300 blacksmithing.
---
Iirc you needed arcanite bars, the garr and geddon drops the bindings then you need to do a fight qith the guild in silithus then 
---
Id say ashbringer is the next hardest simply cause you need to get a guild that can down 4 horsemen, a lot of guilds got time for MC but aint no buddy got time for that
---
Aetish is the hardest just because you need to farm naxx for months to get the 40 shards plus beat the 2 hardest fights in vanilla that being both cthun and KT also you may need broze dragon flight rep in order to start the quest to make it im not sure aboit the rep tho
---
I would love one. I haven't seen my toons I had from vanilla after I stopped playing in MoP. Would be awesome to check em out again.
---
Crit gear until full T2 and then go for spell DMG. You won't even do bad DMG then.
---
other than the servers shutting down, i had those same feelings on retail. my boosted characters never felt legit and more like pay2win. not that private servers aren't all corrupt either.
---
Sorry to get your hopes up.   Not working :(
---
Thunderfury for my spellpower Ret.
---
Here you go, one Thunderfury for take away.
---
Ah ok. Thanks anyway I appreciate it. Are they all telling you they have been used? That's what I got when I tried.
---
https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-27-led-qhd-g-sync-monitor-black/5293502.p?skuId=5293502
---
Pretty good price on it right now. I bought it last year and it's great. I haven't had a single issue with it. Adjust the colors out of the box and you're good to go. 
---
27 inch,  144hz. 1440p. G sync enabled.
---
I fully support wow tokens in classic for a few reasons. First I haven't paid for a sub since tokens launched. I've also paid for xpacs and subs for family members with tokens. I recently resubbed for 6 months to get me to classic, and have enough gold/blizz credit to pay for 2 years of classic, all thanks to turning gold to tokens. I like that it's an option for paying to play.
---
The flip side is that someone pays for tokens by buying gold. I played vanilla and I remember the nightmare of gold sellers. If you think there wasn't gold buying going on during vanilla you're mistaken. It was everywhere! It's going to be in classic too. I'd much rather there be a safer option through blizzard that is a win-win-win for the buyer, seller, and blizz. 
---
As for the cash shop.... Yeah I don't like it in current wow and I don't like it in classic, but that's the world we live in now. I just personally choose not to use it. As long as it is cosmetic only, I don't care. I'd be more open to a classic cash shop if they do more charity donation items.
---
Imagine if 10 years down the road they remake wow. With the world having the same scale and realism as the tyrs hand photo.
---
I insist on Thunderfury for my AWESOME Meele Hunter
---
Please take that with a little bit of fun, Ok?
---
Is that Ashbringer or Corrupted Ashbringer?  
---
If it's Ashbringer, I'll take the unobtainable weapon for 1000 Alex.
---
Can you just roll up to the gate and get in or do you have to be invited? Looks like a secure place.
---
My goal is to have a 60 resto shaman and a 60 hunter for farming.
---
It will be possible but unfortunately that is going to mean that rankers will have to find the most efficient way to gain honor, which is likely just camping flight paths.
---
The upside of this though, is that it will likely cause large scale world pvp battles to break out as lowbies call in their higher level friends, which is what everyone is hoping for I think.
---
😂 Ignorance is bliss.
---
PvP server is fun if it's balanced.  
---
Every server I've played on is 3:1 the one of the faction. Incredibly unbalanced. Either I feel bad, or I get angry due to share amount of enemies.
---
Enh shaman in r13 set with Sulfuras is iconic as fuck.
---
Yep, for sure.
---
Leaving behind a 2k hours osrs account for a little while when it comes out, I'll probably end up fishing or chopping magic trees while I level in classic.
---
I’m one of them! Happy to be here!
---
The easy solution is to be a Rogue tank!
---
Even though it's not really that much of a dealbreaker. It sucks if you want to PvP, until 60 where you have Death Coil and all your engineering toys, then it's totally workable.
---
I’m worried for sure. I have a wife and kid now.
---
Cannot be redeemed
---
I played wow since vanilla. I feel like vanilla felt harder but it was more up to you what to do with your time. Wow retail has become like a facebook game, you feel obligated to log in and do x content for y reward or you're behind. The time spent in game is dictated for you on essential grinds that is the only thing to do. In vanilla if I wanted to do whatever the hell or grind for whatever the hell. That was fine AND fun AND fulfilling. On retail the grind is required like work and isnt fun/engaging/challenging at all. The things I wanted in vanilla were also achievable and finite and meaningful. So while vanilla was harder it was more casual to enjoy.
---
Just know that Paladin, while probably the best PvE class imo, is incredibly boring to level, and are pretty slow to level. I'd personally rate them 7-8th in terms of leveling speed and dead last in terms of fun while leveling. 
---
If you want to be the prettiest girl at the PvE ball, rolling a Paladin is a great idea, you'll always be wanted in Raids. However, since you're not a Dwarf Priest, you'll be the second prettiest girl at the ball.
---
They're also frustratingly unkillable in PvP if thats what you're gonna be doing.
---
Warlock and Hunter are very fun to level, Hunter being #1 in speed and Warlock being third or fourth. They're useful in raids, every raid wants a few Hunters or Warlocks, but you don't want more than a small handful.
---
Hunters are also probably the best gold farming class.
---
Ain’t that the truth. I’ve put 4,000 hours into rocket league, about 3,000 into overwatch, probably around 1,500 for League of Legends and about 1,000 for CSGO. Without a doubt overwatch is the most insufferable community I’ve ever played in. I reached roughly 3800 SR in that game before I had to completely mute everyone for it to even feel playable. Nowadays I only play if a friend wants to and I stay in group chat, everything else gets muted. 
---
I really don’t know what’s in the water with that community but it’s ignorantly toxic. Also doesn’t help that some people feel the need to counteract that with extreme kindness, which is actually equally as annoying. 
---
I guess people just can’t chill out and play games any more without being super weird.
---
Im a guy who dident play classic in the day but i know that bfa is a joke of a mmo a shadow of its forrmer self theres no point to play it no grind no good rewards group finder ruined the community aspect of game and i feel with you guys who played classic back in the day to be upset at the modern day 
---
Wow and i cant wait to see you in classic
---
Ur doing good my man, keep it up (weiter so)!
---
Mages enjoy it.
---
I’ll keep working on my huge backlog about 50:50
---
Will new mods be made for classic?
---
I'm pretty sure once Classic comes out Blizzard will be alot more strict towards private servers and issue shutdowns / lawsuits.
---
you should exude douchbaggery (Be more confident!) this is solid artwork man
---
Im starting to think druids should be prio on first atiesh because AFAIK items that give attack power in animal forms can be counted on 1 hand, sure it isn't as powerful to the raid compared to the mage staff but by that time that staff isn't making or breaking the raid. Its just an another spell power staff to mages with a crit aura which is really cool and I want to see it stacked with a boomkin but a druid probably sees more personal growth.
---
Warlock. You'll have more fun. Holy warrior of light didn't come out til burning crusade. If you want to cast yellow HEALING spells in a dress with a shield then roll paladin. Otherwise you'd be disappointed with how they actually play.
---
4 blacksmiths, one for each specialization
---
Acquire a [Hard Hat], [Safety Vest] and [Clipboard] and you're good to go.
---
That takes a certain amount of... stubbornness?
---
I never said I wanted to rank up though
---
What a bunch of nonsense. That's like saying to your girlfriend that she should buzz her hair because her nice hair takes attention away from her face.
---
5 figures will ALWAYS be a lot in vanilla standards, BFA not so much, but vanilla damn that is a lot.
---
You also earn 75 cents on the dollar and pay higher taxes compared to Americans so mehhhh
---
Look at all of those things to collect in the Retail picture though.
---
If your only qualification for boring is that you cannot fire all your weapons at maximum power all the time while not watching threat at all, then yeah it might be boring.
---
Something something threat mitigation and balancing is not only the responsibility of a tank. But if you raid you can talk to your tanks about it personally and see how they feel about your threat.
---
That was 5 min
---
Thottbot on the other monitor ofc
---
Thanks for the insight :) Also, so much love for Mathilde.
---
I've got a few months to hit gold in League of Legends before taking an extended hiatus.  Thank GOD LOL came out when WoW started to take a downturn IMO, have spent less in skins in LOL than sub fees would have cost for WoW.
---
I was thinking agility gives ranged attack power. Wands are ranged. Does it increase wand damage?
---
Like in this video the guy uses agility gear and a quiver.
---
[https://youtu.be/vRmldX9Mc00](https://youtu.be/vRmldX9Mc00)
---
Does no one play priest? I was around a private server but I didn't see many. I'm curious and interested in priest for classic
---
I think I'll take the staff but keep in mind I dont remember any of their stats or special effects
---
Burn it
---
Horde have to worry about it much more than alliance, I believe, but yeah you have to limit yourself sometimes.
---
They were back then. The LFG channel was pretty much global trade chat. I really hope they keep that feature, but Im betting they wont.
---
I actually was in a raiding guild, unlike you who probably scraped through as a filthy casual. Downvoted
---
Yep I would.
---
I admitted I forgot ZG was 20 and AQ had a 20 option. 
---
I played from the start until cata and I smoke a lot of weed.
---
My bad
---
Wands are great, because they deal a pretty high set amount of damage but don't scale with higher stats. This allows you to have a relatively high "baseline" without having a low peak from being in green / white gear.
---
An early leveling build [like this](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhsZZx) gives you talents like +25% Wand Damage and 100% bonus spirit after you kill an enemy mob. With this setup in place, you can precast Power Word: Shield, cast Mind Blast into Shadow Word: Pain, and then shoot your wand until the mob dies. This is very safe. You don't lose much if any health. You get a ton of mana back after every kill. You're not spending very much mana per kill, so you will still have the mana pool to cast heals, fear, or more damaging spells if you get in over your head. The kill speeds aren't incredible compared to some other classes, but the lack of downtime is why Priests are considered to be pretty fast levelers. Many wands are available as early as level 5 from Enchanting or from quests just after level 10, so this is something you can do pretty much right from the beginning with new wands, with higher base damage, being available from quests over time.
---
I envy you lol clearing naxx was so god damn hard.  I got so close too... this time around I’m killing KT.
---
That's pretty freaking aids not gonna lie. I don't mind farming but that's next level. Can you equip the item, use the effect, and equip a better dps weapon?
---
Easy I'd disenchant the other 3 for CA no question. Too bad a warrior will get all 4 of them because reasons.
---
True, Shockadins are definitely a thing, but I like my chances as a frost mage. Challenge accepted!
---
Yeah my girl won't be keen with me staring at a screen for 6 to 10 hours at a time :b
---
This will absolutely, 100% be me.
---
Imagine just spouting shit like this without even grasping the very basics of the subject.
---
or a guild
---
