Yeah I’m not sure why he thought that was accurate
---
---
---
if you actually believe that you are mistaken
---
Is Naxx coming at launch? No. So why are we getting Crossrealm when battlegrounds launch? Wouldn't it make more sense to launch crossrealm after Naxx at the very least.
---
unga
---

---
us smart
---
other bad
---
Yeah I know you care more about mindlessly farming honor with a bunch of strangers like in BFA. Awesome.
---
Of course, I totally agree that a handful of those specs would be fine (and the locks would certainly appreciate at least one shadow priest!). But I'm more talking about the people arguing that the specs are perfectly fine, and that we should take whatever dps ask for invites. If a raid ends up with a comp like the one you described, I think clearing actually would be problematic.
---
No it isn't.
---
Main Character A is on Layer 1.
---
Alt Character B is on Layer 2.
---
If A wants to be on Layer 2, he just logs out, logs into B, then back onto A, which is now on Layer 2.
---
It should be:
---
At Character B is on no Layer (because it's offline).
---
Switching to B should force B onto Layer 1, giving A no access to Layer 2.
---
Trying to use grouping to abuse Layering is easy too. If you group with a character in a city, flightpath, or otherwise low-exploitable area, they get forced onto your Layer, not the other way around. Otherwise, make it completely random who gets to move Layers, which means you'll never be able to reliably choose your Layer.
---
Most people I see suggesting new raids aren't suggesting Tier 4 gear. They're suggesting alternate Tier 3 gear at best.
---
Hes not... you can watch the vod and see how he did it...
---
I miss old blizzard
---
Attack of the Clones is only appreciated by drooling Star Wars circlejerkers, "underappreciated" is a cold-ass take.
---
They brought down those servers so that the players would be more concentrated on the 2 remaining, as a better stress test.
---
You can still equip a tailoring bop after dropping the profession?
---
So I have this idea for a great movie
---
ZG/ZA rehash was good? Cata only had one good patch, and even then Firelands was a relatively small raid. It doesn't really matter since Dragon Soul is by far the worst raid they've ever made.
---
Then make blizzard aware of the issue and stop crying about it on every single reddit thread.
---
What kind of druid have you played with? MCP feral will always generate more TPS than a prot hands down, the dps can go way harder on pull because of that
---
There should not be any layering at all. Private servers can hold 10k players why cant a billion dollar company do the same...
---
I would take warlords over legion or bfa any day
---
This is slow time? I gave up after spending 20 minutes to get a single quest mob.
---
Launch is gonna be a disaster.
---
I doubt they make their employees work overnight while the stress test servers are up. They probably log what's going on with the servers the whole time but they likely only have people around to make adjustments and try different configurations during the scheduled test.
---
Im in an endless struggle choosing a mage or warlock &gt;.&lt;
---
...but it is only the beta, and layering is only a temporary measure to begin with. What you're saying makes no sense.
---
This is me.
---
WOTLK was the end of the Warcraft Story, TBH. Archimonde had been killed in WC3, the Legion was more or less thwarted further in Burning Crusade. 
---
Sure the Titans and Kiljaeden weren't exactly dead or anything but they were definitely defeated for the time being. Killing the Gods was never really what Warcraft was about.
---
Arthas was the culmination of all the story lines set up in WC3. Killing Arthas was really the "end" of Wow for me.
---
CATA had a significant drop in quality, many major changes to the series, and ultimately Death Wing was not as compelling of a villain as Illidan or Arthas.
---
But for me, finishing Death Wing had a lot to do with playing the RTS Warcraft games.
---
After that with Panda's on the way it looked like a joke content expac and I dipped.
---
MoP was very underrated  
---
WoD sucked complete dick.
---
Well this is the biggest community for classicwow so if it goes viral here it will reach blizzard for sure so i hope you upvoted!
---
To what I might ask?
---
False, leaving cross realm battlegounds out will cause problems. You might not care about those problems, but they exist. Leaving Naxx out until enough players are ready for it causes no problems.
---
What benefits are there to single server bgs? You get some drama from time to time?
---
nah they changed their mind. Decided to make it all of phase 1 (this could be months--no confirmed date range on how long each phase will last) and the entire continent is layered instead of only starting zones. The reason the community wasn't in an uproar is because they presented it as "new technology" by calling it layering instead of sharding. I've gotta commend blizzard's ability to manipulate the community tbh.
---
No problem man, I really hope you enjoy Classic WoW like the rest of us come August!
---
Only at blizzard HQ...
---
You are missing the core step. If one of his characters are assigned to a specific layer, they hold over that layers value when logging out. Seemingly your clients ALSO holds the tie to that layer. If you quit the client, your client loses the tie to that layer. So you relaunch, log in a character on whatever layer you want, log back out, and now your client is tied to that NEW layer. Then you log in on your main, and the main gets put in whatever layer the client is tied on, not the layer the character was previous on.
---
Basically:
---
Char 1: Layer 1
---
Char 3: Layer 5
---
Log out of Char 1 - WoWClient: Layer 1
---
Quit the Client - WowClient: No Layer (nul)
---
Relaunch client and log on char 3 - Char 3: Layer 5
---
Log out of char - WoWClient: Layer 5
---
Log in char 1: Game chooses the WoWClient: Layer 5 instead of Char 1: Layer 1 - thus, Char 1 becomes tied to Layer 5
---
Technically you lose your access to Layer 1 now, and can't get back on it except for someone on layer 1 inviting you, but you get the picture I hope
---
Ive got something like 500 days played across my characters. And I stopped playing with the end of MoP. Sooo 5 years ago. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I made so many decisions in my late teens early 20s to the benefit of my wow career and neglect of my real life and upcoming career.
---
Went to an easier less prestigious university, took an easier degree, stayed with a GF for WAY TOO LONG till she cheated on me (Protip: the misery of initiating a breakup is nothing compared to finding out your GF is cheating  on you), stayed at jobs for too long, got out of shape quicker after athletics cause all I did after finishing sports was play wow...
---
But yo, top 4 US tier clear, dog.
---
Yes go play classic man! OP needs you to make another screenshot when they reach level 60 again! :p
---
Then find me a record speedrun with a Feral tank: https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Speedrun/
---
I agree for dps and healers but for tanks there dont need to be 7% more tanks than there are currently.
---
There needs to be literally 50% more to have a true 3/1/1.  Massive shortage of tanks inc based on these numbers.
---
I'll reserve whatever of my listed names on the server I plan to roll on and that'll be it. Maybe try to reserve whatever name I pick for my main on all realms if I feel like being an ass, but I don't care that much. I managed to be the only Sly in all of Wildstar until duo names came about, so I don't need to go for that again.
---
It's what made it so interesting to me to begin with - 2 classes can be primarily  Holy and still be so very different.
---
You could have used the same title format as in #108. You made it clear that John Staats is only there for the first part of the podcast.
---
What you did in your latest title is simply either clickbait, or a poor title.
---
* Ex-Dev On A, B, C, &amp; D.
---
You simply can't argue that sentence structure doesn't imply that the Ex-Dev will talk about A, B, C, &amp; D. Because that's what you write. Literally.
---
The choice is whether you want to put the old glove on (mage), or try something scary and new (warrior). If you mostly play to relax, go with the mage. If you play for a challenge, go with the warrior. You have already described why priest is not an option.
---
Did you happen to find out the boomkin modifier?
---
Fantastic, I would be a bit bummed if they missed adding them back
---
It's lower than every other DPS class and brings little to no utility to make up for it.
---
Probably not on meme specs. Thats as simple as "Hello I'm a Boomkin may I please join your Hardcore guild?" responded with a "No".
---
However in vanilla blacklists for ninja looters was probably the most common blacklist. I imagine with all the present day out game communication tools we have, that will probably be the blacklist. 
---
I can't think of anything the majority of the playerbase would care about for actually enforcing a blacklist.
---
This sub has a selection bias. Players who are going to play more casually and just take their time are less likely to come to a sub to talk about it. People who are trying to min-max and optimize everything are the ones who are more likely to visit and post on this sub.
---
[removed]
---
Some people want the same experience. The problem is that change is a big part of that. Vanilla was always changing. New raids, new quests, new talents. Every update something new. For those people a WoW without change isn't the true experience.
---
I would be interested to see this!
---
Wow I felt this in my soul a little bit of jiz just left the tip of my pein and entered the realm of my pants
---
I'm going to have fun. I don't follow guides or whatever when levelling. But a lot of the fun from games like this for me is to get better at them, and learn new stuff. So especially now before we can play classic I am absorbing a lot of information about the game. Will continue to do that as we get to play too, and become a better player for it. 
---
If it was the first time I played the game, yeah I probably shouldn't be reading too much about it beforehand. But I've already played the game, this is just a replay, so trying to do it better than I did last time is part of the fun.
---
WoD wasn't that bad. The worst part about it was how little content and story it had, and how slow the content came out. The content that existed wasn't all that bad, nor was the story.
---
The whole bit about the Orcs inevitably falling to darker forces and mirroring the actions of the normal universe and the Draenei fighting against fate and changing things drastically was a nice dynamic.
---
I understand that relogging onto different characters gets you a different layer... but you understand how dumb you sound, right?
---
Let's assume that going from character A to character B sets character B's layer to character's A layer. So, log off A, log on B, log off B, log on A. So who's layer are we on? Well logging off character A and logging on character B should set B's layer to A's. But that's the exact opposite of what Monkeynews is claiming. He's saying that the whole process *exempts* character B's layer from changing. This would require the game to "know" which character your main is, which is ridiculous. 
---
tl;dr: Logging onto different characters obviously resets your layer, but Monkeynews' hypothesis here doesn't have logical cohesion because he's assuming for no reason that the "main" can't set other character's layers.
---
You didn't understand the video.
---
Whichever Layer the WoWClient gets first logged into takes precedence over whatever layer the character was last on. So if your WoWClient FIRST logs into a character on Layer 1, your WoWClient gets linked with Layer 1. But the important part, is you QUIT the entire wow client, and then log onto the alt on a different layer, say Layer 3, your WoWClient now ties to layer 3. So when you log out of the alt, then back onto the main, the main will be on Layer 3 because the WoWClient got tied to Layer 3 on the reboot.
---
They are supposedly experimenting with this in the current stress test according to some hints in the blue posts. This would indeed fix pretty much every single outstanding problem.
---
It’s not the word queue that’s foreign to Americans, it’s the action.
---
Wish I had your chad brain so I could complain about everything before it even happens.
---
You play with only players from your own server. It isn't just about farming honor like on Retail. It is about rivalries and community. Fighting players in battleground,  that you also encounter in the open world adds a lot to the immerson of the game. You don't realize how important and memorable that was in Classic. When most players think about Classic WoW PvP, it was largely because you encountered a lot of the same players. This was because Battlegrounds were single server. Crossrealm makes players anonymous essentially, just like retail.
---
  
---
You also have to consider the ramificaitons of players chain queueing. That is what retail WoW is. Chain queueing cross-realm arena, dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds. Players are only interested in the reward instead of the interaction with other players.
---
Yea nevermind.  I just tested some basic functionality within the Social Group and it wouldnt even let me directly whisper the player or invite them.  TRASH
---
The new models look like shit and don't even look like the same characters, so I want nothing to do with them. I wouldn't mind if they actually did a decent overhaul, but Blizz attempted that and now none of my old characters look like they should. Besides, everything will be old graphics so it's cohesive.
---
&gt;gotta play your role
---
This is what I see getting lost a lot in all the classic discussions. Every class has a limited number of roles it can fill in end-game content. Even if you are the best boomchicken and can too dps meters, a 50-man raid isn't about individual performance. The fact that the one part of the engine that doesn't fit in the machine is the best version of that part won't matter if the machine can't run. Certain abilities are essential or redundant.
---
So play as you like, but if you want to complete raids, don't be surprised when you get told you need to spec a certain way to get an invite.
---
I mean, theres nuance, right?  Player A does better DPS because he has better gear than player B, so do you give player A or B the the next upgrade that drops?  Well realistically assuming identical attendance and reasonably similar DPS (accounting for gear disparity), player B should get the upgrade to get them on par with player A, *unless* that upgrade is a tier piece that will give player A a good set bonus that player B isn't going to get.
---
For example player A has 7/8 T2, but player B only has 6/8, giving him 7/8 isn't going to give a set bonus, and giving player A his last piece means the next two pieces will likely go to player B anyhow, as A is now done with his set.  My end goal was always to maximize raid DPS, healing and tanking ability, boost overall performance.  Feelings never went into the equation and I made sure people knew that before they signed up to raid with me.
---
Some servers have different amounts of layering. There testing this to fine tune it for launch. Perhaps you found yourself on a realm with limited to no layering on it.
---
Although there are only two servers up right now, so that also is probably making it harder. 
---
Either way launch day has always been a clusterfuck.
---
Regular holy spec.
---
All specs were viable in vanilla. 
---
This notion that all specs need to have potential to be top-tier raiding specs is part of what killed WoW. It started in BC and got worse from there.
---
Uhhh it has nothing to do with the cost...... it has to do with making the 10,000 (made up number) people split amongst 10 realms all go on to 2 realms....
---
This is where ASMR was born
---
So the only reason people go into BGs is to farm honor?  Just because they don't want to wait an hour to get in *must* mean they don't enjoy PVPing in a BG?  GTFO.
---
Because it's not really about the technical capacity, they've made that pretty clear.
---
Monkeynews explicitly says you have to exit the client before logging on the character on the layer you'd like to move to. I don't have beta so I can't test it myself.
---
On beta I was killing some mobs in Dustwallow Marsh. I got invited to an RFD group and it phased me over to theirs. They were scattered all over the game, none in my same zone. It was incredibly jarring. I don’t understand why they’re doing this.
---
Based on a quick scan of your post history, she got the date wrong.
---
I assumed automation, otherwise even as a small guilds it becomes a pain in the ass. The issues with it aren't solved by that. As you increase the number of people the loot lists grow to a point where new members don't feel like they'll have a chance at desired items. It can create rifts where people avoid other members of the guild because they have priority. There is no loot based incentive guild leaders can provide for helping the guild. On the opposite end, you lose an option for disciplining bad behavior.
---
There are problems at scale once you get past a one raid team guild that a loot list isn't equipped to handle.
---
It's not about can. It's about the experience that would provide. Some players want to be in a zone fighting with 1k other players for spawns. Other players would simply quit the game when faced with that.
---
Just make sure to let them sit down for a second. Those chickens need a lot of water.
---
devils advocate here.. the initial population will be way higher than pop 1 year down the road so this system helps cut server costs. I do dream that they had 150 servers with no sharding (layering) but a lot of them you have to agree would be 500 active pop and some 5000+ after time. They say “we want it 100% authentic and won’t sacrifice anything” but it’s just marketing to get us diehards hooked imo
---
Vauuuuummmmshhhhhhh
---
&gt; MoP wasn't all that terrible (even though I hated the dumb-ass humor and wasn't too fond of the theme)
---
"Mop wasn't all that bad" *Lists a huge glaring reason why many people hated MOP*.
---
Like it or hate it, Kung-Fu Panda will probably always been remembered as WoW's "jumping the shark" moment.
---
People had been invested in Warcraft for years before WOW even came about. Nothing that comes after CATA feels like Warcraft anymore, Panda's included.
---
Yes, yes, I know, Pandas existed before WOW too. But hardly in any large capacity like they did in Mists. They were a very small population race that mostly was found in the wilds and used as a plot device for optional side content.
---
To base an entire XPAC around them? Foolish.
---
MOP improved the gameplay in many ways, but I could not for the life of me get over the Panda story line, the Panda characters, the Panda humor, or the introduction of Monks. The entire class IMO is not a lore friendly class. In fact, I'd name the entire Mists Xpac as a non-lore friendly story.
---
Look you could build a perfect Vanilla WoW Clone for modern day times with modern day graphics and it could be the best MMO ever created but if the theme/story was Hello Kitty Island Adventure MMO I would not enjoy playing it. 
---
Game mechanics of any quality couldn't overshadow the absolutely awful choice of theme.
---
Haha complaining about stream sniping. Back in my day you had a lvl 60 undead rogue camp your body for three hours while his buddy patrolled around the graveyard so there was no escape. Some of these people are in for a rude awakening if they choose a PvP server.
---
It will indeed come out the 26th for me.
---
At this point I’d rather not get in the beta so I can really be nice and fresh for launch.
---
Ah okay, so you just don't know what loot lists are. [Have a read](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/).
---
There’s no reason to think this is true given Blizzard’s history. They’ve done a lot of great things with Classic thus far but this a huge one and all we seem to get is an attitude similar to, “you think you do, but you don’t.”
---
They should've let EU people join if they don't have enough ppl.
---
It is 2019, the majority of people playing classic are going to spend awhile googling what class to play. They are going to see a bunch of "THERE ARE A MILLION ROGUES AND MAGES, JUST GO WARLOCK ITS ACTUALLY #1 DPS AND PVP ALL WITH ONE SPEC"
---
I can see that making rogues less popular than expected but you are right probably not as much as this survey
---
No they talk about wotlk period
---
...... dot dot dot ....... dot dot dot ...... dot dot dot dot........ dot dot dot dot dot ........
---
I think the discussion is on blacklisting leeches, not under performers
---
Fear ward is essential.
---
You're not understanding me. You should never be able to move Layers simply by swapping characters. They should all always be on the same Layer.
---
Crilgocraggins
---
Sp in top 5 means your guild's dps was awful...
---
Layering will be in the game until naxx cleared, not joking.
---
Yeah but then what? Are you going to check against that list every time you group with someone?
---
Do you wanna be cold or do you wanna be spooky
---
only you snowflake :)
---
Please link proof
---
The prequels are fucking garbage.
---
It sounds like you'd rather just play a mage.
---
So just like the prequels?

It's not impossible to believe they forgot to clear on logout. If that's the case, I do hope they fix it. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed explanation!
---
I had one for a short time but I was so worried about losing it I deactivated it and gave it to someone else. I was pretty happy when they added the mobile authenticator.
---
I was at work when it started, home now lol.
---
Hwat!?
---
But in the same patch they made it easier to get higher ranks. I'm not sure you've researched how the system works.
---
I never put it away.
---
IMO Vanilla up through Wrath is the true WOW experience.
---
If you didn't experience Vanilla through Wrath you basically played a different game.
---
All part of the classic experience
---
Ok, do you intend to play Rogue when Classic releases?
---
Hard to enjoy when 1000 orc+trolls are trying to kill 20 boars in the starting area. I don't consider not playing the game for 5m waiting for a respawn fun or interactive
---
Most of your time playing your character is going to be at 60. Obviously pick the thing you want to do at 60. 
---
If you really want melee combat while leveling, but you want to heal raids just roll a hybrid class. Paladins, Druids, and Shamans all level up through melee combat.
---
le epic trole google 😂
---
Actually, in terms of coding, this could actually be a pretty simple fix. If the WoWClients gets assigned a variable for which layer the first character logs onto, then you could pretty easily store that variable in the Client's files and just reassign that variable from that file when the game launches again. I don't specifically know C, but in Swift, it's a VERY easy problem to solve and leaves no room for user manipulation.
---
Yeah making this shit up is just free clocks
---
Stop trying to make Star Wars prequels anything but trash.
---
Wod is the only xpack worse than bfa
---
Im literally responding to a comment calling it fucking legendary. Believe me im not the one doing any hyping of this scene
---
Because most of us don’t care. Your voice isn’t going to be heard from the new section. This topic has been talked about to death.
---
This is just sharding with more steps. 
---
I'm off of layers and back on the #NoChanges wagon. This shit needs to go.
---
LOL yes, the sequels introduced bad acting to Star Wars.
---
\#NoChanges Cross Realm BGs were in Vanilla and they will be in Classic. It's your own fault if you didn't go out and PvP in the world, cause I sure as shit did even after Cross Realm BGs launched.
---
I'm going to no-life speedblast my Warrior to 40, and then stop and smell the roses from 40-60.
---
Then as soon as I ding 60, I'm either going to be running 5/10 man dungeons with my friends or leveling an alt.
---
Or people that work off shifts
---
Worth.
---
You didn't understand my fix.
---
Once you logon to one character, all your characters should be forced onto that Layer. Doesn't matter if you log out, doesn't matter if you quit the client, you can't change Layers.
---
The only way to switch Layers should be based on Blizzard's choice for realm balance (not able to be controlled by you) or by grouping with players, which I also provided a fix for that can't be abused.
---
It really does... so abusable
---
Tbf if this was old blizzard, they'd just be saying classic is coming "Soon"
---
They're fuckin awful.
---
Anyone else think it's weird that you can out run mobs so easily in the beta?
---
i listened to way too many episodes today. amazing work josh.
---
Do you get that people become ineffective when trying to work 24 hours a day? It's a simple rationalization that the other poster explained to you, so your cheekiness just makes it look like you're the one not getting it :/
---
RAID A NEW MMORPG WITH STUNNING GRAPHICS ALL IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND!!!! no. never.
---
I have no idea what [B.net](https://B.net) social groups are and I'm scared.
---
Go play alliance if you don't like trolls
---
This really would have been the way to go. It would really give your character the lore feeling.
---
Running around as a warrior or a paladin chopping your way to level 50 only to "die" and re-roll as a new class with a different look and skill set?
---
They really could have found a way to make characters remind you that you were once a living hero. Even if it was just a handful of specified comments by NPC's it would have really given you a deep connection to the character.

---
You get pretty cool minions :D
---
There are literally dozens of us.
---
I took a week of PTO for launch, and I expect to be one of the first level 60 Warriors on my server.  But I have literally no ambitions of raiding, beyond maybe off-tanking some pug Ony/MC runs.  I just like to play video games a lot.
---
You instantly went into aggressive copyright+piracy+lawyers attack mode. Against a friendly person that just wanted to provide a desired community service. A service you have no intention of providing. The backlash was predictable.
---
I did a shot every time you said non-Tauren. 
---
Good vid
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Level 59 with 4 backpacks? Damn either this guy was lucky af or is an alt. Either way I’m jealous
---
...that's not what I meant. Literally the first thing in General Chat on the PVP Server was "Where can I buy heirlooms?" and it just devolved from there.
---
Say what you will but I really liked MOP, there were mistakes with it but the goods outshone the bad.
---
Nope, In OG Star Was it didn't look like old ass Obi or Darth Vader practiced at all.
---
WoD drove me to quit
---
Its definitely a disadvantage to be sure, but not so big that I wouldn't play the class if its what you really want to do .
---
Its like saying you shouldn't play an Alliance Rogue because Orcs are super common in PvP, and you're at a disadvantage because they'll resist your stuns a lot of the time.
---
Its definitely frustrating sometimes, but you can totally play an Alliance Warlock.
---
Right now I'm wide open. For a new dad who is about to start a 12-month sabbatical, what is a fun leveling class with a relatively easier time getting in on endgame/PVP?   
---
Background: I started in BC. Initially I leveled a hunter, however I spent the most time on a rogue. This was my most involved experience in terms of professions/light raiding/pvp. After that, I've been casual with a resto druid and now my main, prot warrior. To me, warrior has been the most fun to play; however, I'm hoping to pick a new class which will be fun leveling and leave me the option to get in on PVP/raids in a few months if I end up with more time. Ideally not a saturated class, as I'll probably be somewhat busy and want to have a low(ish) barrier to be viable for raids. Would do prot warrior again, but I probably will not have the time to become a reliable MT.
---
I seriously agree. Part of the classic experience is interacting with people only on your own server but interacting with everyone on that server. Playing BFA, the world seems more empty than it ever did before WOTLK in large part because of the way they intentionally prevent too many players from encountering each other at a time.
---
There are still going to be 1k Spawns in the starting zones with layering, as far as I am aware.
---
No, that is not what he said.
---
Try watching again.
---
I recognize one of these things but two of them are foreign to me and seem almost entirely useless
---
To be fair. If thunderfury drops and one of my office mates ninja loots it, there will be some ass kicking the next day.
---
It's a cash grab and so is the resubbing 2 weeks ahead for name reservations, but don't tell the Blizz fanboys that. They'd give their first born and a kidney to play Classic.
---
We both have travelers backpacks they're really not as hard to come by as everyone thinks!
---
Exactly this.  The memer is essentially saying "everybody else carry me so I can get my personal enjoyment", and this is not conducive to a team attitude. Yes you still might clear the raid in a reasonable time, but you still did it some measure slower than if you had just replaced that boomkin with another mage, and so have wasted everyone's time.
---
Since you are to stupid to go load a vod and watch it yourself let me spoonfeed you.
---
Everytime you launch the game and log in it gives you a layer that is account bound, you can exist the client to make it forget this and create multiple characters that are on seperate layers, you can know they are on different layers by using a point of reference i.e a person afk in the world or kill a mob. 
---
Once you have your different layers setup you can "choose" a new layer every time you restart the client, you would restart, "log in" to layer 3, log out and switch to your main and you will be on layer 3, everytime you want to change layer you just restart your client and do it again.
---
Is that easy enough to understand for you? If you need proof that is easy to do and replicate go watch the vod yourself.
---
you're being trolled friend

That's the date of their wedding. *HE* isn't fully aware of what is coming.
---
They don’t want a bunch of twitch kids spamming that the game will fail.
---
There are emotions tied to it, as well.  It's hard to explain, but thoughts like
---
* Heyyyy new talent point  
---
* Maybe I can solo that orange quest now...  
---
* w00t level 20 new skills!  
---
* Oh snap time to go get my mount  
---
* Hey I'm high enough to go check out Ashenvale quests now
---
They should have let non-subscribers log in. If they want to stress the servers... It's just a beta stress test, come on.
---
Uhm. You forgot the exit client part.  That's how the game "knows" what to do.
---
Char A is on Layer 1. Char B is on Layer 2.
---
Scenario 1: You log off Char A, you log in Char B -&gt; Char B goes to  Layer 1.
---
Scenario 2: You log off Char A, **exit client**, log in char B -&gt; Char B is on Layer 2.
---
Get it now?
---
\&gt;Let's assume that going from character A to character B sets character B's layer to character's A layer. So, log off A, log on B, log off B, log on A. So who's layer are we on? 
---
Still on the same Layer you started with.  You never exited client so you never changed Layer.

I thought it meant lighter for awhile.  My friends were passing a lighter and they kept calling it karova so I called it that and they knew what I was talking about.  A few times later I asked for it again and they all laughed and asked what the fuck I was talking about.  The first lighter had a cow pattern.  This one did not.  I have forgotten lighter. I remember cow.

The west coast JUST got off work and will be home in 20m - 1h because traffic. The timing on this was (I think) done in stages in anticipation of heavy load coming online at (or around) 5:00pm on ET, MT/Central, and PT. But, it was also not well planned in that same regard, because if they really wanted a heavy all-at-once stress, they should have planned the opening at 9:00ET-- early enough that East Coasters could still log on, and late enough so that the rest of the NA time zones wouldn't still be at work. /shrug
---
Oh 100% the backlash was predictable, and I’m understanding of that, but I disagree with the categorisation of ‘aggressive’. I have a stance, I put it forward, some disagree. That’s pretty much the extent of it to me, if others view it your way, then so be it, it’s all good.

With layering you may as well just be on a different server which is the opposite of the major thing I'm wanting out of classic.
---

---
You quit the game....quit on A. Restart on B, log off on B, log on A. Now A is in B’s layer.
---
That's what you get for buying Apple, tbh.
---
Fix?
---
Yeah I dgaf about a stress test and no amount of internet words will make me.
---
I have alerts set up for the day classic actually launches, fuck it until then
---
26 in United States correct?
---
Lol crippling poison? PvP trinket. Rogue kill a hunter in 5 seconds? No. Hunters wear mail and have defensive cooldowns. Mage wants to try and cast a poly while you are kiting them? Feign death interrupt the cast. You’ve clearly never played a hunter or have any clue how they PvP.
---
The 3 loot cards which were available during vanilla (But not able to be redeemed until TBC) were all Bind on Pickup/soulbound.
---
Correct
---
Can't play the game as intended as long as layers exist. Turns it from an MMO into a matchmaking game.
---
Why don't they just have a PC app?
---
“Shaman suck ass” followed by “I want to play Shaman” kind of answers your own question. 😉
---
I just found I quit using q and e binds when I got mine.
---
I agree with you. For the record I love druids and I think HOTW is my favorite spec as it really helps them fill that Swiss army knife role that I think is useful in raids
---
I can't decide between druid or priest. I enjoy healing, but don't want to always be forced to do it. Mostly looking at a fun leveling experience and PVP. Since I don't really have time for raids these days. Shaman could be fun, but Horde cities besides Thunderbluff aren't all that great to look at.
---
Then again hunter or warlock are good solo levelers and also great in PVP.. 
---
mage is always fun, but I'm not quick enough in pvp :(
---
As far as I remember they said their goal was for each layer to contain ~3k players total. That’s split over 6 start zones. I don’t really care much if they have layering or not. If the zones are crammed with thousands of players I can just log off and wait for things to chill out.
---
Too bad you get 20x as much honor 5 capping Arathi basin in 5 minutes than killing players in world pvp.
---
My main will be power level till I'm raiding. I'll take my time with alts.
---
And are limited only to Horde, so it's not THAT popular of a choice.
---
Thanks for doing the math and explaining to me stealth point mechanics like the noob that I am, I can't wait for Classic!
---
Blizzard knows exactly what they are doing, they just know that nobody wants it. They wouldn't have tried to rename sharding if they thought they were doing the right thing.
---
Well your fix would have to be client side, not character side. If you just logged onto the client for the first time, all of your characters are offline thus none of them have a layer. If you did that you would always have a random layer, which would be horrible for the reason I stated in my edit. 
---
As for the grouping with players, that could probably work, but it would probably have a greater negative impact than a positive impact. I can imagine more players refusing to group at all because they are in a lucky shard with fewer players than I can imagine people spam joining different groups to try and land on a different layer.
---
I believe most of the classic playerbase is people who played actual vanilla. Which means we are older now and many of us have daytime jobs during the week. I'm unsurprised the servers were not stressed at 2. We will probably see real stress in a couple hours as the last of the west coast gets home
---
In theory, it rarely does in practice because you run outside the pulses range. Very frustrating as a Shaman.
---
More like duuuuumshhhhhhh
---
I love it.
---
Someone make a Playlist
---
And who doesn't love MOTW/GOTW?
---
&gt;  and how are they to differentiate between the two? [...]  where the person who kills the streamer legitimately doesn’t know who they are by name recognition? In those instances it will be a shame to have any negative repercussions come their way.
---
The answer is simply that there needs to be a hard line in the sand  --  innocent until proven guilty.  Unless the ganker's name is like "Asmondedlol" you have to assume they aren't sniping.  If you don't like that, tough shit, stop streaming.
---
When I was gathering the data I forgot boomkin existed lol. If I find someone running boomkin spec i'll post the results on here.
---
agreed, i am good w/ the ulduar way of hard modes 100%, especially if they can manage to still release enough other raids/dungeons. But i guess as they said it is time-consuming
---
Gaming is main stream.  Twitch is not.  CHildren who play fortnite know who ninja is.  I'm guessing thats your demographic too because no adult would claim that "Ninja" is a household name with a straight face.
---
No need to change your mind, for most people the free guides will be plenty fine. Ours gets picked up because it’s the fastest Alliance one available, it’s based on our speed running route.
---
When Joana and Brian Kopp originally released their guides it was a purchased guide and eventually became free. We’ll end up doing the same.
---
not to mention that EU people didn't get free access to the stresstest like NA &amp; oceania
---
&gt; Lol crippling poison? PvP trinket.
---
Trinketing crippling poison would be dumb as fuck. You trinket a stun.
---
&gt;Hunters wear mail and have defensive cooldowns. 
---
Which you can't use while kidney shot. Also he has Flurry and AR on.
---
&gt;Mage wants to try and cast a poly while you are kiting them? Feign death interrupt the cast. 
---
Lol, he'd just use it again. You feign to trap. And even if you trap the mage can block twice.
---
He should play alliance then
---
Have their devs/ support team gotten better? Last time I played it took 2 months to get my account unbanned from a hacker. I actually stopped playing and never went back since
---
don't know how this mindset got so popular when it's absolutely retarded even on surface level, cross-realm BGs address a small symptom of a much bigger problem and do little to actually address the shitty experience people have on imbalanced servers
---
i'm convinced it's just the flock of idiots who cling to their pve servers and advocate for cross-realm BGs when the reality is they're going to pvp for less than two hours a month, the only way you can legitimately want cross-realm is if your goal is to make pvp as shitty as possible for people who actually enjoy it
---
it's a shame there are so many people so interested in making the game experience worse and it's even more of a shame that blizzard is too lazy to implement a solution that doesn't pollute the game experience and actually addresses the crux of the problem, rather than the singular symptom that is queue times, we're going to give you this pill to make your stomach less upset but less this entirely treatable disease kill you anyway 
---
anyways, cross-realm existed for a few weeks longer than crusader strike hurrdurr it's a staple of muh authentic vanilla experience
---
Think this is the first time I've seen someone running WoW Classic on macOS.  Glad it's confirmed we're actually getting a client :P

Pretty sure that is one of those things that is up for debate. I preferred WoD to BfA. both are bad, but BfA is damned near unplayable.

---
The whole point of a beta is to map out bugs and issues to fix. Stop being such a dramaqueen. If the issues are still there at launch, complain all you want.
---
B-but then all the retail babies will cry about their first experience with vanilla!
---
Because they have 1 guy doing all of the work.
---
I hear the EQ and Daoc Ding more clearly.
---
Its also nice because you get a shield, which are really strong in classic.
---
This is incredible
---
So after 108 episodes of non-clickbait, I cracked and thought, ‘that’s it, I’m going for that sweet, sweet clickbait!’? I guess I’ll just do better next time.
---
That is a regular holy spec. You can raid heal without talents.
---
Agreed. Having a pet is fun they can honestly do most of the leveling even if you're not hitting abilities your pet/autoshot for the most part will kill most things
---
TFA was a good star wars movie by itself but it absolutely did not set up anything. The problem with the sequels in general is that it's decent execution ruined by a completely nonsensical overarching story. Basically the opposite of the prequels. 
---
In some ways TFA actually dug the story into a hole. The Luke arc from TLJ is pretty much directly a result of the situation JJ created. I realize the horde of prequel loving subnormal losers that populate this godforsaken website think the movie should have opened with Luke saying "let's do this" and then doing anime shit, but in the real world it had to be addressed and developed. 
---
I actually think it's one of the few redeeming storylines of TLJ...he did the best he could with a horseshit situation.
---
 ~~Level 30~~Level 5 zones. Actually, how about just no layering at all. I'm tired of Blizzard moving the goalposts to push for sharding in classic.
---
Thank you.
---
&gt; i never hit 60 during Vanilla on any characters
---
&gt; But i can assure you, the fun is in the process to 60.
---
No, you really have no frame of reference to assure anyone that Vanilla leveling is better than Vanilla end-game when you have no experience with Vanilla end-game.
---
​
---
You're probably right, they're both awful in their own ways. Wod had nothing to do and bfa has nothing that's fun
---
you're absolutely wasting your time, this subreddit is full of baby boomers who are going to roll on pve servers, they want pvp to be as shitty as possible so when they opt out of all of it they don't have to accept that they're terrible at the game
---
It doesn't matter, you can't play without the Battle.net launcher and Blizzard has the OG spyware, Warden.
---
WoW’s ignore list is capped at 50. You can extend it to infinity using an addon so yes it should be possible.
---
Looks like a guide to me, climb down off that high horse it looks like you've already banged your head more than once
---
I hate the term tryhard, they’re called winners.
---
It wouldn't be random, you'd be assigned a Layer that Blizzard wants/needs you on, which is the entire point of Layering.
---
How is fire mage in classic?
---
What makes me like the class is fire is almost always the coolest of the elements to watch. But what I loved about fire I dont think exists in vanilla. The dragons breath ability. Cast scorch while moving and the blazing speed thing.
---
Because other people talk about meme-specs like its an issue of not being min-maxed. When I think of min-maxing I think of minute changes that increase DPS by about 5-10% 
---
In my opinion I don’t hate meme-specs. I have problems with people not pulling their weight! This is why in Overwatch I pretty much only group up with Tanks and Healers - a DPS has to go above and beyond to stay competitive and most people can’t do that. So I leave them behind! 
---
Its hard to be ok with meme-specs unless your also OK with the damage charts varying wildly - to the point were a geared tank will out-DPS a few of your raiders. This creates a scenario in progression were your top-end players become frustrated at the lack of drive from the lower end. There is a good chance they will want to either A) Cut the slackers out to get the dungeon on farm quicker or B) move on to a guild where people try as hard as the others.
---
I think it will be very hard to maintain a guild that allows these specs while remaining competitive. They won’t be unable to complete the raids but they will be behind the curve because of these players. 
---
I personally don’t want to be in a guild were lil Timmy who plays Ret only and outputs maybe 40% the DPS of your DPS Warriors gets to compete with the top-DPS for gear.
---
Sure but that doesn't really apply to my comment at all. Usually guilds that allow memespecs aren't fussed about optimal dps, meaning the general level of dps is that low that it does not warrant a fury defiance main tank. No reason that the MT should have a massive threat lead and cost his raid more resources in dedicating healers if he could accomplish the same thing playing a more defensive build. That said I suppose even in some memespec raid there might be a couple of tryhards which would otherwise be threatcapped, but in my experience that's usually not the case.
---
While that certainly is an overly complicated version, it doesn't solve any of the problems I listed.
---
You understand private servers had to fix respawns for a 10k+ pop right? That one mob that respawned every 10 minutes was brought down to 2 mins. Need I mention Lupos on the previous big private server? No one wants that in classic.
---
&gt; There should be no sharding past the Level 30 zones.
---
There should be no sharding past the starting zone.
---
This was perfect
---
WoD had more redeeming qualities than RotS lol.
---
Reported for reporting the reporter.
---
Will herb really fund engineering to max?
---
Oh look the 50th post like this today
---
No it's supposedly for phase 1 now. They keep moving the goalpost. And I think you have to be incredibly gullible to think it'll be gone by then too. Sharding is here to stay.
---
You can do this early if you prefer Darkshore, the travel will slow you down and you won’t get the time back, but you need the flight path anyhow later on so it’s not too bad. 
---
If you go this way, I’d suggest you do Ashenvale as well later, and en route early 20’s make a trip up the Darkshore coast to get Gyromast quests for water breathing potions. They come in handy at Faldir’s Cove around Level 40.
---
Considering the amount of shittalk regarding layering I'd be astounded if they didn't fix it in some way before release.
---
Oh which part? Being able to manipulate which layer your character is on?
---
The immediate things I can think of are:  
---
A) Rare mob spawns. Some of them might have more desirable loot, thus making jumping multiple layers worth the time investment.
---
B) Along the same vein, rare spawn loot, such as chest or maybe quest objectives, and especially rare Herbs/Ores. You might find a Black Lotus spawn location and be able to loot it 8x over by switching to each different layer when it spawns.
---
C) Ability to dodge high pop layers.  Layer 1 will likely be PACKED. If you can at a will swap to layer 6 with only 200 total people on the layer, you have much less competition for quest items and mobs, and you can also avoid a TON of potential pvp/gank situations.
---
That's all I come up with right away. Probably someone more craftier than myself could find a more dubious way to manipulate the system.
---
absolutely unfathomable to think anyone likes the force awakens or WoD
---
Hans, get the gas
---
Be careful!
---
Just conjecture. They said they're thinking about it and they're aware a segment of the population wants it already.
---
I’d probably doxx him in the raid when he leaves “ Yeah this guys name is X X, he works at Y and lives at Z - everyone send him a bag of gummy dicks.
---
It'll still be in the game after that. By that point, why even bother removing it? Nobody is suddenly going to come back.
---
Wotlk is definitely not a part of the "Classic Era".  Wotlk was when Activision took over and started adding all the crap systems.
---
Why not just roll horde?
---
Very curious this player's age just because I had a similarly 'rebellious' name when I was an undergrad and I wonder if it's an age thing lol.
---
It was happening to me also. Specifically if I maxed out the graphics.
---
As enforcement said, wetlands skip. You can level to 5 in your start area to take advantage of packing quests, then wetlands skip.
---
WoD was the last expansion that had competent class + raid design.
---
First 3 ok .  The only underappreciated one is pandas.
---
Honestly, you come across as pretty insecure about this.
---
You know nothing about me.
---
I only play on PVP servers and I spend more time in premade BGs than I do in Raids.
---
I want cross-realm BGs because I don't like waiting. I don't give two shits about the names of the characters I'm killing or whether or not I'll ever see them again.
---
I had to leave I will test at various graphics settings I did have them maxed.
---
thanks pal, fixed my phrasing.
---
ooga
---
Late TBC started going downhill with tons of badge gear, dailies etc.  Early TBC was good.  You're right the dungeons were more linear, but they were still very challenging.
---
TBC class and raid design with Vanilla open world and style would be a phenomenal game.
---
It’s the best option because even if you dps you can tank 5 mans fine.
---
I think that's still the BAD way to solve the problem. Whenever you create your first character, your client should be tied to THAT layer, and that's basically the end of it. That way, the players you see at level 3, are the same players you see at level 30 and the same at level 60. If you randomly get assigned to a new layer every login, it is probably just as abusable as specifically picking your layer, but not at easy to accomplish. If your client gets tied to that FIRST layer you ever logged into the classic realm; you will have those same players, and you wouldn't be able to manipulate the system at all.
---
Ultimately, I think we both agree that this should be fixed, as easy manipulation of your layer will definitely lead to an overall negative outcome.
---
nice point sir.
---
Yeah, PBG and the rest of NormalBoots have been planning to play it for months.

I’m only getting this info secondhand from Druid runners and haven’t checked their spreadsheets. Blizzard hasn’t confirmed anything broken but we know it’s broken and they know it’s broken, if that makes sense. It’s the same with our hunter class with broken pets and warlock with pet issues. Mob tethering is also giving mages headaches. 
---
Blizzard is actively patching the beta but they have a long way to go still. 
---
Just expect the lower dps and hope along with us it gets fixed for launch.

---
It's not complicated at all.
---
You rank the gear you want and then can always see the rankings for every piece of gear. Attendance plays a very small part, meaning new recruits don't get shafted. Repeat for Year 2. There are no rifts between players, your place on the list for any piece of gear is entirely dependent on you. It's drama free and takes mere seconds to dish out loot.
---
&gt;Soul Link gives a warlock all the staying power they need for their sustain to take full effect
---
Lol you're literally talking about a single spec (SL/Nightfall) which isn't even the most popular SL build, let alone a build that compares to SM/Ruin or Nightfall/Conflag.
---
If you want to make a spec that has good defensives but shit damage, then great, but you're not going to be very effective in BGs.
---
Keep your arrogant, gate-keeping attitude and your mediocre takes to yourself.
---
Raids got nerfed at some point. IIRC my guild was casual and just progressing through normal, we'd average  a new boss down every 1.5 weeks or so. Then some patch came out during firelands and it just turned into a breeze. 
---
A bunch of us stopped playing after that and I've never really gotten hooked on the game since.
---
The whole do your chores/fill up your caps before the timers expire and checklist based gameplay is just not for me. Nor is the idea of the only content requiring a functioning brain being higher tiers of stuff I was already FORCED to go through that didn't require a functioning brain (ie: heroics, m0s, lfr/normal raids.
---
Even worse is when you finish a raid and still have the option of doing lower tiers on higher difficulties. No thanks. Raiding peaked in WoTLK, I was casual and only cleared like 5 bosses in Naxx and 3 or 4 in Ulda, but I had a blast because those raids were so epic, and I had envy of the players who completed the whole thing.
---
It’s already begun with...KOBOLDS

I might even just get out of the starting zone ASAP and grab as many FPs and Exploration experience I can.

Eh, I think if your character is ALWAYS on the same layer, you will always see the same people. If you met a "RoguesDoItFromBehind" rogue at level 10, you would see that same "RoguesDoItFromBehind" character at level 40. And honestly, I think majority if not all players wouldn't be able to notice the difference unless they were VERY specifically looking for that difference. And that point, it's the player sabotaging their own experience and, in my opinion, not Blizzard's fault. 
---
(Slight side note: I'm a major Blizzard hater, especially after the Diablo fiasco. So I don't take blame away from Blizzard, in this instance, lightly)

Those are all great things but none address the points I brought up and why it's not a good system for large guilds.
---
I don’t know enough about warlocks to be able to answer that. If you are on discord join Joana’s World because that’s where most of the runners chat, chances are you can get a decent answer there.
---
The AH becomes a mess, high-volume - low profit and good luck selling anything on the AH without a Bot designed to undercut and repost. 
---
I’d take a medium server any day.
---
I’m loving the humanization and involvement of the GM’s in classic so far, hopefully it continues through with the actual game modes.
---
I mean every xpac has been unbalanced, in cata almost every 2s team was ret/dk. MoP was pretty wack at the beginning but towards the end it was amazing, at least for me cause I was making rogue and mage.
---
That's a great point. Make it so the user can't just open a file and change a "1" to a "4".
---
No, it's not a new Layer every login. It's only a new Layer whenever Blizzard decides they need want you on a new Layer.
---
Permanently tying a character to a Layer won't work. The Layers are separate for each continent, for one. And every time you group, you might switch Layers. Third, the number of Layers required is dynamic. Sometimes a realm only needs 1 Layer per continent, sometimes it needs 6 or more.
---
That probably plays a part, but I think the biggest reason is the server is temporary and because its a new server a lot of "ironic" or "meme" names are available.
---
I was being heavily downvoted for saying exactly this just last week.. Ghost Mushroom / Black Lotus farming via layers, hiding from PvP. 
---
Everyone pretty much told me they’d rather that over non-layered servers.
---
No, I mostly care about playing with my friends.
---
I still use mine. Had it since they first came out. I've got 2 different blizzard accounts, so I use one with the device and the other account with the phone app.
---
how about some dragonforce?
---
From vanilla to cataclysm I never got hacked. Logged in one day and something didn’t look right. Aww shit..no gear on my toon..all disenchanted and gone. No gold. No mats. Damn.
---
Submit ticket to blizzard. 5 minutes later have all my stuff back. GM says it’s probably from an addon. Download malwarebytes. Sure enough..keylogger detected. 
---
Immediately ordered the authenticator and still use it to this day. Yes, I have phones...
---
For mage, this route becomes kind of a thing, you're going to want to set your hearth to Ironforge so you can get skills @ level 14, then deathwarp once back up thru menethil.
---
Bongos
---
That too. People act like the revamp was "the problem" with Cata... in reality there were many huge changes that came with it that get overlooked.
---
Oh god... why would anyone like that at all...
---
/r/happywowgifs 
---
I get it man. I do. But acting like this subreddit only thrives on negativity is false. There is a lot of happy content as well. That being said, there is a large chunk of this population that has a rather valid knee jerk reaction to parts of the new blizz system. They can't talk about it at /r/wow, so they formed this community.
---
ZG/ZA rehash was good. It was well rounded content, not super easy for average players and the rewards were perfectly situated being not trash but also not making T11 obsolete.
---
I tried to download it and i was working until i tried to type the commands like /bob show and for some reason wouldnt let me press enter with it...ill try again
---
I’m one of those people who played from vanilla (end of Vanilla when I joined) and quit years later in Cata (left at the dragon soul raid patch near the end). 
---
Maybe it was me?
---
someone should start a guild &lt;Island of Misfit Toys&gt;
---
Sorry bucko but for PvE progression, a hunter will use ashkandi a lot more effectively. Plus it’s also an insane pvp item for them as much as warriors
---
https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/
---
Here you go dude.
---
Why pressure people into it if they don't want to? Why shame clickers?
---
same... sub expired 3 months ago, i'm not renewing it just to test for a day... guess i'll have to wait :(
---
I stated plenty of times that perhaps you didn't intend for the title to be clickbait. But it is.
---
Honestly this whole passive aggressive douchebag thing you got going is not a good look. Especially when you're factually wrong. You're really bad at handling criticism tbh. Stick to making podcasts.
---
My current plan if its bad in the start zone is to just leave and farm xp and cloth to make a wand. If its terrible everywhere I’ll just come back later.
---
Also Tauren Warrior.  Going Herb/Skinning to level, then picking up Alch at 60.
---
Holy fuck I was not expecting that to be so God damn real 👻
---
I am not a priest expert but wands seem to be a big need from what priest levellers are saying. If you’re going to be in a guild someone should nominate to do enchanting levelling and have resources pooled to get it to 70 quickly. If you’re planning to level fast that should not be you. If you are no friends like me, I’d level and buy from the AH or spruik for one each time I went through a city. 
---
If you work out your wand progression has an item in a dungeon you can plan to get this done but it would be wise to work out beforehand who your group is to avoid casuals who don’t know how to do DM etc on Classic vs retail.
---
Why do people always bring up SL, its such a boring and bad spec. Yes it destroys in 1v1 duels. 
---
That's about it, until 2+ years into vanilla you do garbage damage, you have no mobility and its soooo boring.
---
What happens if you see an SL lock? You ignore them or turn around and walk away because they can never catch you. SL is such a bad spec for the vast majority of the game. 
---
The other lock specs offer so much more than just survivability that SL should realistically never be taken.
---
&gt;25% of your dps
---
Where'd you get that nonsense
---
This is true, but how much pain you will be put through leveling a tank is quite a great deal of pain with no help. Most MT's are going to be running with at least a healer for 1-60, or are going to have help in some form getting there.  (Hence the recommendation, get the mage first)
---
Time to level the mage to 60 is drastically shorter than leveling a warrior to 60, and if you have money/bag/MOUNT/gear being funneled to your alt/new main being the warrior, you'll be much MUUUCH better off.
---
You don't need to gear the mage to farm decently well, hit 60 and start farming. There's tons of AOE grinding locations, or just farming spots out there that mages excel at.
---
Have to agree, I don't remember getting to make any interesting choices in any version of WoW.
---
Ironman
---
I was literally going to say this exact same thing
---
364 days between ICC and Cata (I don't count Ruby Sanctum in there...)
---
Not saying you have, just saying group with your friends and do stuff. It feels like you can ignore it for the most part. It's like saying FF8 sucks because you can abuse the draw system. Just don't, problem solved.
---
88, yea boiiiiiiiiiiii.
---
I took the whole week off. Big brain strats
---
As a general rule of thumb regardless of class, if the class quest will help you level do it. If it’s enroute on your planned levelling route do it. If it’s important but sends you all over the place, try to work out a plan to give you more XP quests etc as you travel around to get it done. It may even be better to pace it out over a couple levels.
---
Ey Gratz mon!
---
That's something I hate about so many of the current mmo's out today. They all seem to be built around the endgame experience with the leveling portion feeling like an after thought. When I play a game though I want to enjoy the whole thing, not feel like the leveling part is an obligation I have to complete to get to the real game.
---
I was just playing in the open beta tonight 6/19 as a gnome warlock. There was a million people in starter zone so killing wolves was tough. Signed off. Came back and hour later and had to re accept the quest again after having half of the wolf meat.
---
That guild has 120 members across ~5 raid teams. They've never once had a player leave the guild over loot.
---
Your points:
---
* new members don't feel like they have a chance at desired items
---
* rifts form between members of the guild
---
* no loot based incentive for guild leaders
---
* no option for disciplining bad behavior
---
I addressed the first two, they never happen. The incentive for helping the guild is that it's expected. Only the best 40 of the 120 get into the World First team. And as for disciplining players, there are more effective methods.
---
You can get them at Level 1 in Teldrassil but you’ll be 2 or 3 by the time you get there. If you want to try this, look up wetlands skip for the fastest way to get there. Make sure you get a Classic Beta video.
---
I don’t do Maraudon so I couldn’t tell you. Maybe a mage could answer this one?
---
carrot before ^small word
---
    ^small
---
The you have a beta invite and get to play with your friends :D
---
As Celticmetal said, no BGs at launch.
---
Ya, it was being stressed hard earlier. The servers held up well and didn't break. That's a win and no reason for them to maintain the server being up. I was really surprised how well it ran this morning.
---
Did the irony go over your head?
---
ty man ill try again
---
The last stress test was the beta client. The current stress test is the client that will go live.  
---
They are not the same.  
---
Everyone with a US account has access to the current client, restart Battle.Net and check the drop-down again.
---
Crossrealm anything is a poor solution, especially for a game that is supposed to be an open world MMORPG. Classic WoW was never designed for mixing servers. This was a bandaid fix by Blizzard towards the end of Classic, which is no way representative of how how Classic was. Introducing Battlegrounds with Crossrealm right away has no semblance to Classic WoW.
---
Is there a r/wowclassiccirclejerk yet?
---
WoD had an amazing cinematic
---
So how do friends who want to play together on launch get on the same layer and play together? trial and error until they see each other in the starting zone? Say you want to group with someone who you've just connected with outside of WoW - Yes you guys are on the same server, but how is your solution addressing the issue of grouping up with those you want to play with if you both are locked onto a specific layer as you mentioned in another reply.
---
We get it, people enjoy games in different ways.  We don't need more of these posts every day telling us that.
---
&gt;No, it's not a new Layer every login. It's only a new Layer whenever Blizzard decides they need want you on a new Layer.
---
Honestly. I'm 99% sure those two things will be synonymous for the first few weeks. People will be logging in and out by the thousands every second. Layers will fluctuate so quickly that being logged out for 10 seconds, your layer could empty, fill, empty and fill all while you were gone for 10 seconds. Tho I do admit, this is 100% speculation. No solid evidence on that claim.  
---
&gt;Permanently tying a character to a Layer won't work. The Layers are separate for each continent, for one. And every time you group, you might switch Layers. Third, the number of Layers required is dynamic. Sometimes a realm only needs 1 Layer per continent, sometimes it needs 6 or more.
---
It definitely could. The player could be switched to Layer 7 when they join a group, and when they leave the group, the next time they transition from one zone to the next, it triggers them back to their "home" layer. 
---
And you are definitely right, they are going to need to be dynamic, but i'd rather have my "home" layer for times of peak population, and occasionally be placed on a seperate layer during low population moments. I made my friends while leveling. Always seeing the same priest, or the same hunter while leveling enriched my classic and BC leveling experience. Later, we all joined a raiding guild together because of how much we had already enjoyed playing with each other.  Having an as consistent as possible set of co-players per layer should be the ABSOLUTE priority imo.
---
Blizzard has every intention of figuring out a way to convert Classic players over to Retail. That's where the money is and that's why they're bundled.
---
Its still misleading because it is from a pserver.
---
Wow has been a joke since the TOC patch in wrath
---
You don't think instantly going the copyright+piracy+lawyers route is aggressive against a guy who probably thought he was doing something good?
---
Autism is 28
---
yeah they'd have more people if you weren't required to have a fuckin sub to stress test. lmao
---
Which faction and pvp or pve?
---
warlocks?
---
You are assuming SL warlock. SL is a meme spec that is garbage for everything other than dueling.
---
I had fattychode for all of wrath and cata. Really brings me back
---
I’m just pointing out the history here. That last line isn’t meant to be passive aggressive, I’m being genuine there. So here’s where we stand. I’m not your kind of guy, my show isn’t your kind of content. That’s fine. Not everything will please everyone. I can live with that.
---
But I’m not sure if there’s also the insinuation that criticism should not be defended by the creator. We disagree on something. Are you really upset by the manner in which I’m disagreeing with you merely the fact that I’m doing so? 
---
I haven’t called you a name. I haven’t turned belligerent. I’m fine with criticism. But if the suggestion is, and I’m not sure if it is your suggestion, but if it is that criticism should be readily accepted and consented to, then I would balk at that a bit. I don’t know if you’re taking it that far, but I still really feel that you’re upset with me merely because I am backing myself rather than acquiescing to your opinion? Let me know if I’m way off.
---
Imagine browsing the internet without a uBlock Origin lol.
---
Yeah, remember that private server are free. People will be paying for classic; quality. Having dynamic respawns like private servers would look bad and most tourists won't stay for that sort of gameplay. If you haven't seen a new server launch with dynamic respawns, just imagine not being able to see the ground and people standing directly on individual respawns competing for tags, and the mobs respawning instantly. SICK GAMEPLAY!!
---
This is here to hence unappreciated.
---
I think it's more than the sequels are so soulless and shitty, that the prequels look good in comparison. That being said a good chunk of episode 1 and 2 are unwatchable. I think 3 is a legitimately good star wars film.
---
Great work!
---
Just to clarify, the name reservations only apply to the stress test servers, correct? 
---
Like people aren’t reserving names for the full launch, are they?
---
It depends how close you are with the guild. People in hardcore mythic guilds value the guild’s progression over their personal character’s progression. They know that regardless of who gets the item it will benefit them in the long run. That said I am not sure if I am sold on doing a 40 man raid as a loot council but I guess in someways it is easier with BiS lists.
---
Smart move. Alot more people will buy expansions to try them out if they are already subbed. Especially if the expansion gets alot of good reviews.
---
Oh and you havent played an expansion in awhile? Weeeellll why not level boost to catch up?
---
You don't need to go full Holy in order to effectively heal dungeons. Most talents past Illumination are strictly raid-only talents. They won't help you healing much because you won't be hitting raid-like damage patterns. It sucks to see precious skill points wasted.
---
Another thing to clear up is that Holy is still a melee spec. Holy Shock is so useless to Paladins that in Vanilla guides many authors even suggest not taking it at all (super inefficient DPM/HPM).
---
Let me recommend a build that'll make you the most effective healer *and* be able to deal as much damage as necessary: I guess you can call it a [“Holy/Ret hybrid”](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzMwAAEMONzzQ) because healing dungeons is the most efficient way to farm the necessary 2H weapons to make leveling as Paladin the most satisfying experience. Thankfully, dipping 20 points into Holy does little to affect your damage because your DPS comes almost entirely from the top-end of your weapon.
---
The first 11 points in Ret are the “damage” package of Paladin builds and gives you the most bang for your buck: *Benediction -&gt; Deflection -&gt; SoC.* Because of a mechanic called [Parry-haste](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry), you should pick Deflection instead of Imp. Judgement (which is useless with SoC) and Imp. SotC (also worthless.)
---
This means healing with a 2H, or switching to a 1H + Healing Off-hand for dungeons. Wearing a shield is going to do very little for you. Unless you care about the aesthetic of running around with a shield.
---
#Talents:
---
**Imp. BoM**
---
This is a waste of talent points since [it doesn't scale well](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a93mk8/paladin_levelling_talents_benediction_or_imp_might/ecgiude/?context=0). Mana is always going to be an issue so Benediction is your best friend here—you'll be Sealing and Judging *a lot*.
---
**Seal of the Crusader:**
---
Seal of the Crusader is obsolete in patch 1.12 [because of a bug that they probably won't fix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak3qqw/should_all_bugs_be_fixed_even_if_they_were/) Don't even buy SotC from the trainer, it's pretty much always a DPS-loss. 
---
**Pursuit of Justice:**
---
After SoC I'd recommend PoJ since distance will be your biggest efficiency-killer while leveling. Can't stress the importance of +8% run speed.
---
**Sanctity Aura:**
---
Mathematically, Ret aura beats Sanc aura because of poor stat scaling while leveling.
---
**Imp. Judgement:**
---
You should be using rank 1 SoC to level, which means never Judging it because you actually lose DPS by doing so. Not Judging SoC makes this talent worthless.
---
**Healing Light**
---
You might as well get this to improve your dungeon healing (you should be building a healing set with +Healing cloth pieces and off-hands) and then two points into:
---
**Imp. Lay on Hands**
---
This is the most controversial choice but Lay on Hands is so much better on Tanks than BoP since BoP suspends threat and only causes another party member to get one-shot instead. Giving your tank +30% armor for 2 minutes in addition to the emergency heal is more effective than Consecration or two points in Divine Strength.
---
After this, get Illumination. I'm skipping Consecration since it's useless while leveling as a non-tank. It's insane how inefficient Consecration is. I think a lot of people are blinded by guides that glorify AoE grinding around level 50+. AoE grinding won't be a thing while leveling at launch because grinding spots will be contested by other players (especially Mages) who can AoE much more efficiently than you.
---
**Illumination**
---
This talent is all you need to heal effectively until 60. Get Divine Intellect and Spiritual Focus because this becomes your most powerful healing combo with Concentration Aura (spell pushback is huge in Classic.) Avoid Divine Strength because you won't be getting enough Strength rating on your gear for this to scale well and since you're not equipping a shield it won't help you mitigate damage either.
---
#Additional info:
---
Don't waste gold on the following spells / ranks: Seal of the Crusader, Exorcism, Divine Protection ranks, Redemption ranks, Turn Undead, Hammer of Justice ranks, Lay on Hands ranks, Seal of Justice, Holy Wrath, Divine Shield, Blessing of Sacrifice. You won't stick around undead areas long enough while leveling in the early levels to justify the Undead-only spells. Maybe once you start hitting EPL you can pick those up.
---
#Stat priority:
---
+Healing  &gt; +Spell Crit &gt; Mp5 &gt; Intellect. 
---
Keep in mind that at very early levels you'll be mostly aiming for Spirit &gt; Intellect &gt; Stamina. Don't worry about Strength because most of your damage will come from the top-end of your Weapon.
---
&gt;Fear ward saved one person per priest
---
Fear Ward lasts 10 minutes and is on a 30 second CD. Considering that everyone and their dog will be rolling dwarf priests, it's not unfeasible to have the entire raid warded before a fight.
---
Just to add to what people have said. Unless your super hardcore it will take a ton of time to get through all of the phases of content. Years!
---
Sorry when I say ‘consented to’ I mean ‘agreed with’
---
Thanks for the support :)
---
He started his Alliance guide long after we finished ours. I’ve read through it and watched him play through some of it. I think if you want a free guide it will be fine. 
---
The difference I think with ours is time. We’ve ploughed thousands of hours into play testing and been able to make some big changes to improve levelling speed. There has been a handful of times I have completely rearranged whole multilevel sections to tighten it up, and you can’t do that without knowing the whole route.
---
Just to play with friends, I actually really like the NE starting zone aside from the relics of awakening quest.  I've done it so many times though I don't really need to experience it again.
---
Mulgore is empty as fuck on the stress test server I'm on, and I purposely went for the highest pop realm when it came up.
---
&gt;w00t level 20 new skills!
---
&gt;Oh snap time to go get my mount
---
But not at the same time :^)
---
I sometimes get anxiety thinking of the day the battery runs out on this ancient device.
---
&gt;just play with your friends
---
Nah, see that's the problem. Layering hides you from other characters on the same server. Interacting with these other players organically and even getting on each other's way is part of it. A lot of those aspects have been removed in modern games, keeping people in more insular groups rather than providing a large (but not too large) community to exist in.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE 🦁
---
Blizzard is a company. Companies exist to make money. They sell products at a price that will net them the most amount of money. The believe that people will be willing to pay $15 a month to play Classic WoW.
---
Yes! I love getting any gear that give me a few more bumps in damage, so I can melee if I run out of mana “shaman”. I like my staff skill and my defense skills to go up as I take damage and attack. I like running out of mana and having to replenish.
---
I like going to the class trainer to hopefully have enough copper from selling junk to purchase my new spells. 
---
No sarcasm. These are things that didn’t know I would miss, until I had them again. It adds something to the game that pulls me in.
---
All it takes is one person to fuck that up though. Though most people are willing to group for the kill.
---
K, at this point I assume your trolling me...
---
Don't worry. In 6 months she won't remember your name and you won't remember any of this.
---
WoD underappreciated?
---
Lmao
---
&gt; why would someone with all the expansions choose to play where there are no expansions 
---
Cause the expansions made the game worse
---
&gt;and no ongoing support?
---
There will be a dedicated team for patching bugs in Classic, likely mostly the same team maintaining the beta. As for Classic+ it's still up in the air but I wouldn't rule it out.
---
&gt;4.99?
---
Tbh the $15 (Less with longer subs) is already significantly less than it was in 2006 due to inflation, the reason the price has stayed the same is because they've padded it with MTX that (hopefully) will never find a place in Classic. 
---
Looking at OSRS they've released a $5/mo game from 2007 that's now $11 (🦀) and people still come in droves cause they've expanded it while keeping the feel authentic.
---
😂
---
Yep, even BC was too polished.  After that it was fun on a rail.
---
I just think it's going to make the world seem more empty. I'm not planning to take advantage of it, but if you change layers on login, it does mean you might run into someone once but then never see them again
---
Grats on the cake!
---
Until you're out of mana.
---
&gt; added bad acting to the mix as well, and there's no real story to speak of, let alone a compelling one. 
---
Yeah cos it's totally not like Ewan Mcgregor is the only major cast member to play their character at a level that isn't absolutely god awful. 
---
&gt; TFA felt like a bad middle school fanfic complete with Mary Sue author-insert character 
---
As opposed to the wonderfully written romance between Anakin and Padme in Attack of the Clones, yes. And Anakin and Luke *definitely* aren't natural ability masters with less training than most jedis unlike Rey, who is also an author insert because (honestly this one is so baseless that I can't even think of a joke about it) 
---
&gt; TLJ was just a straight troll job - and not even a good or clever one. 
---
It's such a troll move to put themes into a Star Wars film... unless it's the prequels and George Lucas has more BS for people to overanalyse to justify their nostalgia. 
---
Jesus, dude just say "I watched the prequels when I was young and I learned from previous Star Wars fans to hate new stuff and parrot dumb criticisms I read on the internet and never gave a second of critical thought to. At least then you'd be honest and could have a shred of dignity.

---
If Layers can disappear in seconds, there's no argument to be made that players should return to their Layer after a group activity. It might be full, it might be empty, or it might simply not exist. There won't be such a thing as a "home" Layer. And if they're friends, join the same guild or add them to your Battle.NET, then you'll have Layering priority to stick together.
---
Only by abusing world buffs. Take all world buffs away from warriors and they aren't top dps.
---
Relax everybody they will have rppvp.
---
Yeah. It's been a problem tbh.
---
Ahh ok. I’ll have him try. Doesn’t really matter I guess in the long run since we are only signing up for classic. Just playing retail for kicks right now.
---
Didn't blizzard say they'll hopefully stop layering after two weeks, but definitely before phase 2? If it's out after 2 weeks, who fucking cares? The people smart enough to abuse it would be smart enough to successful without it. And for such a small time, it'll hardly mean a thing.
---
undecided. I've already experienced it as rogue, may want to try another class. But like I said, rogues are particularly hard to find let alone gank, and when you try you will not find many that will try to run 40 yards to you after eating an aimed shot. They hate hunters and live on being stealthy and only fighting when they have the drop on you. And if you are ganking a rogue half health with 2 mobs on him, or 5 levels below, or AFK... you don't need to worry about talents and abilities advice, you'll be fine no matter what you do.
---
Awesome news I was concerned it wouldn’t last long. I came to WoW during the panda phase so I’m so excited to experience the beginning
---
There is a brand new sentence subreddit!
---
Of course it’s not as hard now as it seemed. Back then it was new and prior to WoW there were only a handful of decent MMOs. An entire generation of people had to learn not to stand in the fire and there weren’t YouTube tutorials for everything.
---
Who said anything about lawyers? Did I mention anything about lawyers? I don’t think I did, but please point out where I did if it’s amongst my comments. Have you added that part on your own? Because perhaps, just perhaps, if you’re going to suggest it’s inferred from what I’ve actually said, then you’ve taken it a step further and landed at ‘aggressive’ all on your own it would seem? Do you read this as aggressive? Because I can assure you, it’s being typed passively.
---
Was never hard, just time consuming.
---
nnnnnnggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
---
You know it! I’m gonna smoke a fatty every night for a year till I make 60 and imma read all the quest text and lore and shit
---
I lost mine while moving last year...so I'll probably be making a brand new account
---
White key caps. Enjoy cleaning your keyboard after every session.
---
&gt;“Unviable specs” seem to be doing just fine with their damage
---
The viability of these specs is only in the context of raiding. In PvP most of those "meme" specs are actually good or even great. So while a Boomkin can get a giant Starfire crit, he can't sustain that damage for very long and runs out of mana and his sustained DPS in a raid encounter is bad.
---
Anyway, yeah the game isn't very hard. People remember it being harder because we were bad. Plus people have been optimizing the game for 10 years. I'm sure thats a big factor too.
---
Why when they know people will pay $15... makes no sense.
---
I believe you can talk to blizzard support to get it removed if you prove who you are
---
I like this alliance perspective: "we even did it without dwarf priests!"
---
Honestly they sent me a free copy of MoP in the mail and I was very tempted to fire it up.
---
You’re not missing a zone, there’s a lull Alliance side at that point. Do work out a couple of great grinding spots around your 30’s to push your level up between quest sections. You want to run out of quests around 41-42 then pick a grinding spot to grind a couple levels. It’s tedious but it lets you resume levelling in an efficient manner. 
---
Doing it this way gives you the luxury of questing through higher sections at a better personal level without running out of quests.
---
Okay, ya my first character was a dwarf then a NE, played through NE area once and from what I can remember it just wasn’t really my cup of tea, so from then on I would make the long haul over to elwynn. It’s been years tho so I feel like experiencing it today, I’ll have a different take on it. Can’t fuckin wait!
---
Depends what you mean by "hard"
---
The game was "harder" in the sense that everybody was significantly worse. Numerically and mechanically the game is quite a joke, logistically however it requires quite a bit of investment (as does the modern game in some aspects). 
---
As for 4-5k crits that is most certainly in very niche circumstances until much later gear. "Unviable specs" get out paced when people are actually in pre-bis and raid gear.
---
Streamers etc are remembering just fine, but you answered your own question, everything has changed, not about the game, about how people approach and play them.
---
For scores as low as 3.1 this has got to be user scores, probably from metacritic. And user scores are obviously the most trustworthy because its the people, who criticise with heavy thought and in good faith, realising their feelings independently /s.
---
Look forward to seeing what magic you can do
---
Well, you'd be wrong in that assumption.
---
Oh shit, really? 
---
By proving who I am do they just need like a picture of my driver's license?
---
I’ve been using Dominos for weeks. Works with Masque as well.

When you inspect a target, and you press on another target (within inspection range), the inspection window closes. It should instead inspect the new target without closing.
---
They're never going to make a subscription for Classic only.
---
It was **brilliant** for them to make the price point that they did and the combination of the two. When retail players get bored of retail, they'll play Classic. When Classic players get the urge, to see if things have changed enough with the main game, they can try to check it out again and see if they want to, if they don't, they can stick with Classic.
---
They get money to support production of both games in the process.
---
I hope you live in NA
---
Saffiron.
---
Thank you for the response!
---
Do you think the best play for mage is to do solo Mara aoe runs 46-50 ? It's nearly 25k exp/ hour at the rate I was doing it on a PS.
---
Curious on a person with true experience's opi ion on aoe farming vs questing
---
There's a delay when you chat in (/say) and loot mobs. Like a ~ 3 second delay. Should be instantaneous.
---
Release date is August 27th as far as I can tell, unless something changed.
---
This. The game was hard for 12 year old me back in the day. Am I having a bigger blast than I've ever had post TBC? Fuck yes.
---
Breakable.
---
Just to confirm - this works for Classic?  Is that what you're confirming.  If so, do I just need to install and use the newest version?  Or an older version of the addon?
---
LFR was what finally killed the game for me.
---
I facerolled Death Wing, thought "that was lame" and unsubbed.
---
Man druid is gonna be so lowly represented. Shame since they offer some great raid utility and are the kings of FC's
---
This works for Classic?   If so, do I just need to install and use the newest version?  Or an older version of the addon?
---
It matters the whole way. Maximise dps (with some thought to efficiency) and drink.  This starts to change as you outlevel your food and water since drinking takes longest right before an upgrade. 
---
In the start area you’ll find though you don’t need much drink. 
---
Spells are expensive, don’t buy what you don’t really use.
---
Undead hookers?
---
"And see"
---
1. unzip addon to your desktop
---
2. put your face 1 inch from your monitor and navigate to the Addons folder.
---
3. done!
---
It's kinda hard to decipher when you're being sarcastic or genuine when you switch between them mid paragraph...
---
I'm not sure where you get the idea that I don't like your content. I listened to the hitcap/warrior podcast recently, because that interested me. Just like it would have been interesting to hear an Ex-Dev talk about World Buffs... Which is what your title here on Reddit clickbaited.
---
Btw did you edit the title on your website, or was it always non-clickbait there?
---
There won't be a need to level boost (even though one comes free with every expansion).
---
Blizzard is planning to force all Retail players back to level 60 in a future expansion. That will be the expansion they "fix" with compromises and features Classic players want. 
---
They'll let you copy over your characters, which will essentially be a wiped fresh start for both playerbases, and you won't have any idea who played Retail and who played Classic. Then they shut down Classic.
---
Oh look, another one of these.
---
Im going horde, thinking orc warlock and undead mage. I was thinking of maining warlock then leveling mage further into the game for PoM pyro shenanigans
---
The new leveling experience was my favorite part of the expansion. I enjoyed the Alliance Vs Horde focused quests.
---
Spell damage rogue, spell damage hunter and priest agility wand build.
---
The real meme specs
---
ironman to 60 in classic? with cloth gear and a staff?
---
Rogue or mage for endgame alliance solo world PvP?
---
No way lmao
---
Quest completion sound. 
---
Also, I know this is a classic sub but that damn alert in DBM will play in my head until I die.
---
Originally realms held only 2,500. I believe the limit should be 3k.

---
After Arthas died I was genuinely a little depressed, and ended up quitting WoW toward the end of Cata as a result. 
---
I first started playing lightly as a little kid in late Vanilla, around 6 or 7 years old I think, and what really drew me into the game was playing Warcraft 3’s campaign story when I was 8.  That was what made me absolutely fall in love with the world and story behind the game, and pulled me way deeper into playing WoW for years. 
---
When the final cutscene was released for Icecrown I felt so devastated because the only main character from WC3 I liked besides Sylvanas was now dead for good. But I stayed around because in the final months of WotLK everything still *felt* normal and fun so I kept playing.
---
Then Cataclysm hit and everything became boring as fuck.
---
I would find myself, so much of the time, sitting down at the end of a day after school, excited to play WoW, and then realize about 30 minutes in everything felt bland, rehashed to death, and just... boring. There was no feeling of community left in the game after more than a year or so of LFG, but raiding in Wrath still felt fun after it was released mid-expansion - Cataclysm felt like you were pulling teeth trying to progress. Not because it was too hard or too easy, but because you had absolutely no excuse to do anything else since LFG was around to put you in a group every 5 minutes.
---
After that I was out until BFA. And here I am at 22, having quit BFA after spending maybe 3 months casually playing in my spare time. It still sucks.
---
Anyone not sold on PVE this time around? The constant grinding over and over, the wiping, and doing the same raids continuously... /s
---
Dude this game is doing stuff that has all already been done. If you’re lookin for new content, I’m not sure classic will be fun for you. 
---
For people looking to replay this magical version of wow, they’re sold on it.
---
I want cross realm BG's, but with realm homogenized teams. Meaning, only people from your realm and faction can be your teammates but the enemy team may be from a different, specific, realm. Could get some good realm rivalries going.
---
I think the issue there is that bag drops are moderately rare. There isn’t a huge number of greys just normal amounts. It does become useful for vendor money and if you aren’t going full speed then why not. 
---
I do recommend getting an add on to give you vendor value for greys. You’ll be surprised what sells for silver.
---
Both
---
Don't bother all, I'm reporting myself.
---
Speedrun and warrior in the same sentence 😬
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but joining a party by necessity puts all of you on 1 layer. Once in a party and which my dudes, I just kinda tune out everything else.
---
All fury warriors will have deep wounds, because all fury warriors need impale.... Why do so many people keep thinking this wont be the case?
---
Based on the surveys of potential classic players I’ve seen, shamans will be the second most represented class on the horde
---
Speak for yourself. TBC and WotLK were fantastic. Cata and MoP had some great improvements too. WoD had some of the best dungeons and raids to date and most people liked Legion. Every expansion has had its good and bad.
---
yo this is really good.  
---
The remaining significant question is how does warrior charge place you regarding player spheres vs melee range?
---
Killing mobs as you level won’t be hard, and dungeons should be much easier than people remember. Most of this is due to the increase I general knowledge about how the game works.
---
I remember vanilla being hard, but I also remember not having my hotkeys set up, being a clicker and a keyboard turner. Changing these things make the game a lot easier.
---
I remember finding some quests to be very hard - usually orange quests- but now I know to spread my levelling over multiple zones (rather than just the human zones) and now levelling is a lot easier.
---
I remember getting a full group of 40 people geared and in a raid was a challenge, I expect this will still be the case.
---
I remember things taking a long time, and this will still be the case.
---
I remember epic gear being rare, and this will still be the case.
---
I remember hunters rolling on every weapon that drops, and that’ll still be the case.
---
Hope that helps
---
That's just not true
---
MS does not have anywhere near high priority.  It is between lowest and middle, give or take.  Nothing important should be getting knocked off by a single MS; problem comes from having like 3+ arms warriors.
---
That's unfortunate cause the other alternative means you're an idiot.
---
really :(
---
Wotlk was the start of the downward spiral.
---
ahahaha ya mon g a n g s h i t
---
Yes. I'd rather pay for the sub of the one game I'm *actually* playing. I'm never going to touch retail, it has nothing to offer me. The lower cost means I'd have more friends play as most don't want to pay subs for MMOs anymore, B2P and F2P is what every other MMO save FF has anyway. Blizz won't do it, as they want to suck up as much money as possible.
---
On the stress test today, it was a slow, hellish task getting 8 wolves in the dwarf/gnome starting area. But that quest unlocks a chain of other quests, so skipping it means you miss out on a good bit of xp. 
---
Thoughts on ignoring it and replacing those few quests with a mob grind?
---
Oh if they sent me a free copy I would spend 15 bucks to try it for a month lol. I quit shortly after Cata and came into Legion about halfway through. Once I saw what they did to the Talent trees I was done. Cant stand being railroaded like it was. Which sucks because the raids were really fun and class balance is good (prefer TBC balance/spells/talents). I just cant stand all of the stuff they did to it. I didnt really make friends or anything like that on there. Admittedly because Im not very social but I used Dungeons and WPVP as a way to make friends and that was gone.
---
I would probably play retail again if they revamped the talent trees, LFD (or limited it to your server only). 
---
Though I hear they changed alot of spells aswell now too so not sure how my character (druid) would be affected.
---
I resubbed for a chance at the beta before I realized that they were severely limiting access. Finally got in tonight and my sub ended 12 minutes after I had a chance to play. Ain't no way I'm resubbing for 2 days of beta access, worst value ever.
---
How would you enforce the piracy+copyright you instantly talked about?
---
Dont quit your day job
---
Well it's not like they can cancel Classic. Worst thing they could probably do is not have the infrastructure and make the game unplayable for the first two weeks of the game, killing the hype and perhaps eliminating most of the player base to below even their own estimates. You know, like Warlords. Not that I am a pessimist or anything.
---
This. I don’t want vanilla because it was hard - Mythic raiding is hard - I want vanilla because it’s an enjoyable time sink, and my gear doesn’t become outdated with each patch.
---
Classic WoW will not need the expenses it had when it was the main game. It also isn't going to be getting any actual new content while Retail exists.
---
Probably. I'm talking about organic world interactions, not partying up with people you've friend listed.
---
I hear you pal. I'll be taking my time too.
---
No. Stop being cheap. $15/month is a fair price for Classic alone.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Please no more posts about no more posts
---
Lol “best hunter” but doesn’t think hunters have any mobility, and thinks they lose to the class (rogues) they hard counter the most. Your not convincing anyone.
---
This is so bad. Take my upvote
---
Actually, i just saw you stream as a lightbulb. Maybe quitting your day job is the answer.

---
You should actually skip some skills to save money for your 40 mount.
---
It really comes down to how many players are in each layer and the cap on a servers population. If a server is capped at 10k players and each layer is \~3k, then no, 3k players will almost never fluctuate that rapidly. But if the server is capped at 50k, to which I HIGHLY doubt it will be even nearly that high, it's more likely but probably still a stretch. Also, i'm also noticing as I type this, if there are only 3 layers per server, MOST of these issues seem to be a non factor. Many layers makes for the issues.
---
And you don't become friendly with another player on your first encounter. You might see a rogue once and he helped you kill something and then you go on with your life. If you see him 30 times while leveling because you both are keeping the same level pace, then you eventually start to talk to that person more casually and probably eventually become friends. Honestly, I shouldn't have to explain this concept. I'm sure you understand the logic behind it. And I hope you see the intrinsic value from this type of encounter.
---
Ya good to know, I’ve always traveled to elwynn as a NE or a gnome just cuz I liked the sunny and grassy environment. Westfall right after is so exciting I can never resist. As a dwarf though, for some reason I don’t mind lvling in their starting area as much.
---
Three names per server or per account?
---
They gave me Legion free and it didn't bring me back to retail. They'd ahve to overhaul the entire game to get a lot of Classic players back on Retail. I only have Retail installed now cause it auto-installed when I loaded up Bnet for Classic hype and friend adding.
---
&gt;Seeing ads in 2019

That would have been brilliant :D

Wow thank you for mentioning stealth.  I was just thinking about being tanky/having a pet to survive patrols and things when I afk for a minute or two so I don't come back to a corpse. Stealth didn't even cross my mind lol. Makes the choice way easier.
---
new star wars sucks
---
I think it is difficult to predict who and how people will play the game once it launches.   
---
I recently installed a speed running addon (not for speed running) to have personal transparency about  how long it takes me to level (the way I like to play). 
---
Fact, for me personally, is that leveling has significantly improved for me, time wise - even if I’m enjoying the game in a similar way during the beta.   Over a decade of playing the game (retail), improved internet connectivity, bigger PC, addons, guides, search engines, reddit, discord and a myriad of other resources have made me a more efficient WoW player.   
---
I’m enjoying the beta - like many others.  I’ll be playing the game the way I want to and for as long as I want to.
---
Ah, the ol' "you've exhausted and defeated all my points so I'm just going to insult you now" gambit. Let's see how the moderators feel about that one.

Is anyone ever really high enough to deal with ashenvale? Oh wait... nvm

It's not a hard game. Vanilla WoW was simply the first MMO for many, many people. I'd played EQ and the original FF mmo before I touched WoW and was flabbergasted by PvP. Why were these players attacking me?? What did I ever do to them!?  
---
Now I'm a slut for PvP and can't wait to hunt players down while lvling.
---
WoW! Now this is pod racing!
---
Early Draenor had an excellent leveling path but once you got through it you were good to log indefinitely.
---
I never understood why people kept saying Pandaren were a joke. They were in WC3. They had some backstory. It really isn't a stretch to think that between WC3 and [last expansion you enjoyed] that they were working on more lore and stuff for them.
---
I feel the same way about Pandaren as I do about every other non Vanilla playable race. I'm totally okay with them existing, but they should have never been playable.
---
Where is humans vs orcs?

---
If they shut down classic Pservers will pop up again. Maybe wont be as popular at first but Blizzard will sacrifice RPG for $$$ again eventually once they have a solid number of subs back. Thats my main issue with the game though is not alot of RPG for it (and I liked old talent trees)
---
I can see them losing alot of retail subs to because of the level squish and introducing more Classic elements. There was alot of backlash from reintroducing the GCD if I recall correctly. Or something of that sort. I could be wrong though I havent looked much into it.
---
Yup, check it out https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14153/robe-of-the-void
---
Finally a great video on this sub that tells it like it is! Nice.
---
So? Some of us like to PvP for *fun*. I know this is a hard concept for min/maxers, but many people play video games and engage in certain activities for the simple pleasure of it.
---
Thats actually probably a better idea. I’m particularly after any area that isn’t 100% crowded.
---
Grinding on Humanoids with a friend for Cloth and greens would honestly be the quickest way to flood the market with wands. Sell them for 20-40s each (the highest players can afford at the time) and you’ll be taking like 40% of the gold generated in Northshire on that day.
---
Get a life.
---
OWPvp - Druid or Rogue. So in your case Rogue.
---
I got goosebumps
---
You can build elemental up to 30% spell crit from talents and gear alone, plus whatever crit from intel you can get, in ZG and Bwl gear.  You’ll be able to get this gear too, because half of it comes from healing gear (5/8 t2) and the other half is primalist off pieces, a weapon and 2 rings. 
---
Shiiiiet you can get even higher if you can convince someone to give you a spell crit offhand to go with a mindfang OR a staff of shadow flame. 
---
A LB+CL+FS burst combo with at least one of them critting, combined with a natural alignment gem, is some nutty silly damage for a “healer” and you can do it reliably every six seconds. 
---
Windfury just sucks in comparison. 
---
I have a half mast just thinking about it.
---
The sequels are a lot closer to the OT than the prequels though...
---
Layering isn't perfect, but it's a whole lot better than the alternatives.
---
Dwarf priest is the best priest for any race hands down. Only good thing nelf has is shadowmeld which honestly is pretty useless. Dwarf hunter would work well because of stone skin, so it’s easier to kite while being immune to those effects for a few. All in all, Dwarf is the master race of WoW
---
sure
---
&gt; You're free to join my realm in Classic and I'll wipe the floor with you.
---
They will be monitoring how Classic goes and be open to the ideas of TBC servers and Wrath servers in the future. 
---
I could definitely imagine a future where a subscription to WoW gets you access to choose to play on a server of whatever expansion you choose.
---
I care because useless characters are not fun for me.  The most fun I have is being a DPS machine and topping the charts.

Please believe me when I say there’s nothing to decipher, I’m not going for sarcasm here. Where the sarcasm arises is mostly a genuine question, just a bit more animated than a flat response. It doesn’t really bother me whether you do or do not like my content, I’m always up for a discussion either way.
---
But what I’d honestly like to know, being genuine and not aggressive, is were you genuinely let down and felt fooled when you clicked on the episode and realised it wasn’t a wow dev in on those chats? Particularly when in the show notes underneath it clearly seems to indicate that they’re with other people? Because if so, then I apologise, I’ll do better. But if not, then what are we doing here? Honestly?
---
The difference in titles hasn’t been edited, and whilst that may strike you now as your ‘Aha!!’ moment, there is a reasoning behind that. Which is based in click attraction as opposed to click ‘bait’. The people who visit the website will listen to the episode regardless of who talks about what, that’s how regular listeners and fans take in the show, I don’t need to promote it in the same way as I do with people who don’t know the show.
---
On Reddit, where I’m likely to come across people every week who haven’t heard of the show, I tweaked it to include the mention of the ex dev, as this would be more attractive to people who may looking for the first time at the show. 
---
I read the title as “Ex Dev talks MC”. Then the comma indicates to me that there is a break in conversations and topics, and when I read the subject matter of those topics I don’t figure that the dev is talking about those. But I see how you can take it in that way. But again, I would come back to this, how egregious of a click bait sin is it? Because if I were going for click bait, wouldn’t I go for something far more malicious? Which would come back to the interpretation that perhaps, it’s not click bait at all?
---
&gt; is the server is temporary and because its a new server a lot of "ironic" or "meme" names are available.
---
What's wrong with using a disease/affliction name?
---
Would people be up in arms if I named my character Cold, Pneumonia, Obesity ?
---
Generally, the people who play meme-specs aren't stubborn expert players.
---
They are clueless and just never looked at a guide.
---
Any specific reason for that?
---
Ok
---
See how Classic goes and maybe we will get TBC as well in the future!
---
I mean, if it wasn't limited to being subbed to the current, garbage game, then they would have more than enough people.
---
I don’t know where you got the idea that everyone will be shaman but I’ve honestly struggled with the idea of everyone being the same class, too. I enjoy being a unique class and I’m starting to think I’ve gotten used to retail and all its classes; I rely on seeing different colors or something weird. But what I’ve been realizing on beta, (I didn’t play original vanilla btw), is that even though you have fewer classes and there are a number of repeats, the game is designed around needing each other. You ooo really fast, only hybrid classes can actually heal, druids don’t even have a normal res, etc. You need other people. As a Druid I enjoy other druids around me; maybe they specced differently, too. I dunno, it feels a lot different. As a monk on retail being with other monks annoys me. I haven’t felt like that in classic.
---
I’m with ya, decided to start a week or two after launch to miss the bottlenecks
---
I think the audience for bug testing a game is also not that large. I still loved vanilla wow, but there's no way I'm going to spend time playing a character that's going to be deleted in a few weeks.
---
On the Alliance faction you don’t have to play with Trolls. They are just in the Horde side.
---
Have you considered - by asking the mods if they would consider removing it? Jumping to legal solutions is on you, and was not on my mind at all. If you’ve painted me as the devil already, I’m not sure there’s much I can do to salvage that.
---
They need to not require a frickin sub to a horrid game to test their game for them (at least these stress tests).
---
I’ll have to improvise!
---
heyyy, good to see a fellow latin american in here, good luck against paraguay, saludos desde Chile
---
Maybe tHEY SHOULD INVITE ME TO PLAY
---
My bigger worry about the game would be not how hard it feels but how small it actually is or how it doesn’t hold the same mystique , like people have said when you have something that used to feel like a brand new world but now is just a small map that’s been optimized and broken down to viability. We are just not walking into a new world that was at its technical peak at the time.
---
OP but fairly dull to play
---
unless you really like those 4 buttons
---
Its much more common that the memespec player just never looked at a guide or DPS meter.
---
They legitimately don't know that ret paladins do terrible DPS and wouldn't even know what consumables to bring.

I'm taking one whole day off for Classic and working through the most meandering path to 60. Bf never played Classic and he plans to be a tank, another friend wants to be a healer so the plan is to level casually and hit every dungeon as we get in range for it. Might even slow done some more so my dad can keep in the same lvl range as us so we can all group up together.   
---
Those rushing to 60 will become burnt out and bored waiting for the next phase anyway.
---
Most of what he said was pretty absurd, but TLJ legit was a troll job. Not sure what else you can call it when you throw away the planned story and subvert not stop.
---
They are going to suck a few days of sub out of us to reserve names. I subbed to Retail in April and lost interest in the hour. They should have done it closer to release..
---
I mean you can't go wrong with either choice.  Mage is a way better money maker / pvper in early phases.  Lock will take off later.
---
I really like that status bar addon up top, the xp/hour and time to level would be incredibly useful for me while leveling. Hope something like that will exist in classic
---
thats gonna drop hard. 
---
i see so many guys that are looking forward to playing enh
---
i really hope some stick around but sadly most wont
---
WoD had fun PVP, and top notch PVE. I genuinely have no idea why WoD was so hated aside from Garrisons and the story being dumb (neither of which really matter).
---
Or it shows how many people have unsubbed since BFA launched, hah.
---
My free time to engage with something enjoyable is worth more than over-paying for Classic. No point in touching Retail when I already hate everything they've done to WoW through it.
---
I leveled entirely dagger/sword sub  (macro to switch from dual daggers to slow sword/dagger after ambush opener) on Nost to 60, and it was glorious. 60% chance to crit ambush before any mods from talents, near 100% with whatever the buff after you get after a kill makes the next fight much easier. I also picked fights with EVERYONE I saw, baring level 60s (although I did win a fight with a 60 ele shaman at 47 who was picking on newbs doing defias escort in westfall) and it was tons of fun

---
Wow that was a really petty response. 
---
Not everyone works in friendly work environments. And not everyone is the same at work as they are at home. 
---
You never know the kind of person someone is, and finding out their true colors through WoW puts you in a tough situation if they’re bad people. Pretending to be nice at work only to find out they’re actually kind of an asshole will change your entire perspective of someone. It could hinder your work with them and make day-to-days harder.
---
I’m glad you’re lucky enough to have friendly work mates, but it isn’t like that everywhere.
---
Yes, or if the code on the back (if your auth had one) you probably wont even need to talk to support, even easier if you have your phone number connected.
---
Bad acting, dialog, story, action, CG. I guess if you ignore every element of film they can be considered good though...
---
KEK
---
I mean I can see how this is abusable and it sucks but this is only going to be around for Phase 1 right?
---
Or worse, Redridge?
---
That doesn't make sense.  
---
That means that every single person who only plays on one character will be on the same layer.  
---
Let's assume a server of 200 people, 199 of which create only 1 character, and 1 player creates two characters.  
---
The logic implied here would put 199 people on Layer 1, and the single guy on his second character on Layer 2.
---
Dwarf has better racials and is a bit better than NE imo. Although, NE hunters with a stealthed pet and Shadowmeld can be pretty deadly...
---
And dwarf priests are great if you’ll be raiding as they are NEEDED - but if you want to do PvP, i.e. shadow priest, forsaken has you beat. So even though you said no UD, I’d strongly consider it if going the PvP route. 
---
Shadow priest can do good DPS in a raid but guild will only need one. So, it’s a tough spot to fit unless you were to create your own guild. 
---
A hunter is a great class to start with along with Druid. Druids are a good way to understand role mechanics and what you like/dislike about them so if you don’t end up liking the class you’ll at least know more about what you genuinely want.
---
PUISHIUMMMMMM
---
&gt; My free time to engage with something enjoyable is worth more than over-paying for Classic.
---
Not to Blizzard it isn't.
---
Wouldn't rogues be a fourth in that scenario?
---
Stop. Please just stop
---
If your players can avoid the damage 98% of the time, then in a 40 man raid you will lose some players as the fight goes on.
---
Its much harder to identify and recruit people who avoids damage every time than it is to replace your ret paladins and boomkins with mages and rogues.
---
$14.99 in 2004 is $20.19 today
---
I'd pay $20.19 in 2019 to play Classic.
---
You’d have to PvP first, something you’ve clearly never done with hunter.
---
I am not sure if the player sphere is even being taken into account or just the player's position, however their hitbox does seem some way related.
---
I did a test with a warrior friend with 4 charges.
---
2 Charges (Orc Warrior Charging Male Tauren)
---
4.258 Yards
---
4.22 Yards
---
2 Charges (Orc Warrior Charging Male Human \[Savory Deviate Delight\])
---
2.335
---
2.354
---
Same type as mine and still works with maybe a 1 second delay after clocking the button.
---
It's not just about the price. It's about giving Classic players access to Modern, and Modern players access to Classic (even if they don't think they want it). It's ecosystem building.
---
Nah, there are still trolls on the alliance side. They're just shorter and they call themselves "gnomes" or something like that.
---
&gt; Like does dwarf/human zone have better gear/xp rates or something?
---
Opposite. Nelf zone has about 2x the quests and xp as Gnorf zone doe.
---
that wasn't petty at all. stating pseudo conclusive statements isn't necessary.
---
There wasn’t bad acting the stupid dialogue made it seem like that. The story was awesome I have no clue why you don’t like the story of freaking Star Wars. The action was awesome and the cgi was up and down. Your just being dramatic.
---
Awesome man any chance you can share a talent tree?
---
Those servers said "Low" and "Full" before they opened up today. Perhaps it was a backwards effect and the 'fullest' was actually empty because nobody wanted competition
---
Hijacking your thread for my own question - will your rank deteriorate just from not doing much or does it only go down if you don't play at all. Example say one week I have 100k honor and the next 75k will my rank (or progress bar) go down?
---
On the other hand, wiping a raid is *much* more punishing. It takes much longer to get everyone back up, buffed and full on mana. Repair costs were harsher. Worst case, you might have to reclear trash or someone needs to take a trip for consumables(arrows, soulshards, etc).
---
No.  Once you get it, it's yours.
---
After further review, it looks like charge will place the warrior at approximately the MELEE range - 2.7 yards.
---
Dude literally everyone is going to play to have fun, wtf are these threads? woe is me, people want to rush and raid.
---
I loved Cata and MoP even at the time. WoD made me quit the game for 2 years...
---
Faster you kill the boss, the fewer times you have to deal with raid mechanics.
---
you are only able to show your current pvp rank
---
i think b/c scarab lord was added after vanilla there wasn't a title tab during vanilla
---
but yea its ur current rank. 
---
but no one gives a fuck about the rank, if you got the gear that's what matters lmao.
---
maintaining the rank mean's you're continuing to no life if ur at 14.
---
even if ur rank 11 , u can get ur mounts and stuff and who cares if u lose the title name

---
It wasn't "the story of freaking Star Wars", it was the story of Anakin's extremely abrupt turn to the dark side.  Also, saying there wasn't bad acting is just a completely absurd statement.  If there's one thing that's universally agreed upon for the prequels, it's that the acting is atrocious throughout.
---
Yep.
---
Thanks ;)
---
Dude you’re comparing the streamer experience to that of a casual player. Of *course* they’re doing what they’re doing... they have the best gear for their level. People are constantly flocking over them and giving them epics.
---
That's not pessimistic thinking that's conspiracy theory thinking.
---
I subbed the month before Beta started with the intention of getting into Beta. It worked.
---
What I did was
---
* Read the title.
---
* Go to your site for the World Buff timestamp.
---
* Noticed there were 2 nicknames talking about World Buffs. Odd, since the title only talked about 1 Ex-Dev.
---
* Skimmed the list and realised the only guest who appears with his real name is probably the Ex-Dev.
---
* Realised that there would be no Ex-Dev talking about World Buffs.
---
* Realised I had either been clickbaited, or just unintentionally fooled by a bad title.
---
* Since clickbait is so prevalent, I assumed it was intentional clickbait.
---
* Spent time explaining how the title is clickbait, at first assuming it was intentional, but after a while realising the clickbait probably wasn't intentional.
---
And here we are.
---
Cant wait to do this. Probably wont be with my main because I want to start farming gold/raiding asap but my alts I will. Rogue will do skinning with lw, Priest will be tailoring and enchanting. Lock probably Engineering and mining.
---
Which is perfect because while I level my main I will be skinning and mining. So save up all skin, ore, cloth, and greens pass them down to the alts so they can just coast through the first 30  or 40 levels .
---
Sure. Ion Hazzikostas took his Ion Cannon out and raw-dogged us just like he did to the retail players.
---
Only most of us haven’t realized it yet.
---
Blackrock is the best raid since Ulduar and I haven't enjoyed a raid as much as it since!
---
I want to see 10paladins vs Horde in WSG for the lolz.
---
Final Fantasy Victory Themes, too.
---
Ba ba ba da da dun da dunnnn.
---
I don’t agree with any of this.
---
Nope, that's how vanilla was.
---
Yea, ill send this off to blizzard Hq, thanks
---
It was the first half of Star Wars story and just as relevant. Universally agreed on by drama queens like you. Back away from Ewan McGregor you monster.
---
To save money on server costs.
---
While there are no BG’s Streamers will be seeing all the action. It would be quite cool to see a streamer form a group of players for open world PvP with an invitation to the opposite faction to try..
---
7-10 people in a guild could do it, with a bunch more people “on call” - it would create new and organic SouthShore 2.0s.
---
Engineering is almost a must for me on every character, it just adds too much flavor
---
I remember the first time doing ZG and hearing Bloodlord Mandokir level up and Jin'do yells "DING!" Next thing you know the tank is getting chunked!
---
It went from the best sound to the worst sound lol.
---
Glad you enjoyed! I'm new to videomaking so I'm just trying to make it as simple as possible
---
Unless you rush to 60 shouldn’t layering be minimal by the time you are farming those, let alone when you have a crowd?
---
PVP ONLY
---
Alliance
---
Dwarf whenever possible followed by gnome for mage and warlock
---
Horde
---
Tauren master race followed by orc for rogue and warlock with undead for the rest, priest and mage

You realize prequels memes is supposed to be a joke right? Most of the people in there are ironically posting that they love the prequels
---
Unless they retconned something kalimdor was untouched by the humans until w3
---
NE is the better Hunter choice due to higher base agility and Shadowmeld. SM has plenty of non-pvp uses but SM + aimed shot is king. I've rolled every Hunter combo in Vanilla and NE for Alliance, Orc for Horde are top tier. Dwarves are great if you want to be rare and/or smaller than your pet but I next to never used Stoneform on my Dwarf Huntress but sure as shit used SM all the time in PvP on my NE. Granted, Trolls are the best because- Trolls.  
---
Pick whichever faction you like best, then decide if you like DPSing or healing more if you pick Alliance. If you pick Priest, you **will** be healing.
---
Please be true. Sharding at high levels is disaster waiting to happen. It will 100% be abused, and there will be massive controversies surrounding it.
---
Dragon's breath is gone. Fire is really just a post-MC PvE spec for Mages. For PvP the three-minute-mage spec is the closest you get to a fire build.
---
I'm a busy man, can you find out for me?
---
The pets also just flop over  from a stiff breeze in vanilla. A raid geared warrior could just whirlwind/sweeping strikes a pet and warlock down. Then youre a demo lock without a pet.
---
Great photo.  I love the idea of being in remote locations in WoW.
---
For dungeon bosses my vote prob goes to Ras Froatwhisper  or Baron Rivendare
---
It’s a meme reddit lol.
---
Looks like he attacked first though, and actually managed to hit him, for 4 damage.
---
Having plenty of gold at 40 and 60 for your mph t because you budgeted wisely and looted every kill
---
^thanks
---
Nothing, I was just giving my two sense
---
Lurk moar
---
&gt; Hell, the hardest part of a raid is getting 40 people in the first place.
---
Problem is, the people who play meme specs generally aren't very invested in raiding. Maybe a few are stubbon trihards, but most just never read a guide and thought Ret Pally is cool.
---
Meanwhile, people who optimize for raids are demonstrating with their actions that they care about raids, and are more likely to show up.
---
Thought maybe the oogas got ya
---
It's not more steps.  It's just continent wide sharding, just like everyone that got downvoted at the time said...
---
My guild did this until we hit t5 content. Then they decided to do loot council without telling anyone. I would have won the first pair of t5 shoulders that dropped under the old system. They went to the brand new off tank that bounced the next week. Drama was had.
---
This is false. Lose the rank, lose the title. Before 1.6, you lost the ability to use the gear too.
---
This picture is horrible. The ratings are dumb, WoD sucked.
---
Are worgen not in sfk?
---
Looks really cool alliance scum!
---
Everyone that brought it up a month ago got downvoted to oblivion.
---
I've never played classic WoW (I'm only 16 and have yet to experience the joys of classic) and haven't gotten that far in modern. I'm willing to take my downvotes for the sake of asking...
---
What's that?
---
Either you're trolling or purposely trying to miss the point.
---
That's still not griefing. People PvPing on a PvP server no matter if it's one death or one thousand deaths is NOT griefing.
---
Seriously, go read the ToS, they specifically lay it out in a clause that Corpse Camping and Excessive Ganking is NOT griefing and is part of the game.
---
Don't like it? Play on a PvE server or make some friends to come help you kill the people Ganking you. Any Blizzard GM will tell you the same thing.
---
This is the best shit I've seen on this sub so far.
---
Yeah, I'm just saying that it seems like you've really bought into the whole Ewen McGregor is a god meme and that the prequels are somehow great films.
---
Oh look you rushed to level 20.. but I am level 16 and have 150 alchemy.  5Head Vanilla Brain
---
I tested out Rend and Battle Shout just now, neither of them were pushing back the swing timer.
---
Really like I said, melee abilities don't count as "spells", and thus should not be pushing back swing timer. Slam is the only one that does because it has a cast time.
---
Yea I guess people didn't get the joke
---
I was a fury warrior in vanilla, raided through BWL and a little AQ before quitting. I was always top 3 dps. Pulling aggro was 100% a problem, even though our MT was good. Warriors just have no threat mitigation skills. When the threat meter said I was too high, I just had to auto attack for a little while. Not much else you can do as a warrior.
---
For example, I once pulled aggro on rag in MC from execute spam. The raid leader did say to go 100% dps. Oops...lol.
---
Level as DPS, change around 55, at that point you can do some high lvl dungeons to start working on your preraid BiS and doing attunment quests, both easier as fulltank.
---
RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL RUN AWAY
---
Ive never liked frost and nobody seems to ever talk about arcane in vanilla. Like seriously, all the stuff ive read not once has someone mentioned arcane lol. So i think im gonna look into some other classes.
---
It is an authenticator . Makes it so your account is about 99.9% safe
---
Then just play a gnome frost mage, human combat rogue, or human fury warrior. Those are your options for topping the dps charts. No need to look out for any other classes or specs. That's the top three. If you are so worried about it just pick one of those and move on. From what I have heard human warrior is the top dps in Nax end game so just choose that and dont think about any of the others if you dont want to
---
Nice. Im part of a small service in a small town (20,000 pop) as long as I give a months heads up usually I can take off whatever I like.
---
Has anyone had a battery run out
---
WoD was utter garbage, and should just be removed from this graphic. Cata &amp; MoP both had their moments - and I was definitely riding that high all the way until level cap in WoD - and then the entire thing just fell apart.
---
Legion was great, and it felt like they had got their mojo back. And then BFA?
---
Well that was one ruined orgasm.
---
I didn't understand 95% of this video, but good work!
---
WoD is definitely TPM.
---
Wait, are you seriously calling Cata, WoD, Mists, Episode 1, and Episode 2 underrated? Fuck outta here with this revisionist BS. They are all garbage tier.
---
I found a new colour the other day. I call it ‘blurple’.
---
That's exactly what I plan on doing.
---
I tell you what though, the people in the beta stress test today (pve servers) are purely there to bitch and moan.  I'm definitely rolling PvP to stay away from that toxicity.  I shit you not, it was non-stop bitching about ammo, bitching about not having enough mobs, talking about how retail is better.  Fuck off already and let the rest of us enjoy it.
---
Ok fair enough. Since you're latching onto the lawyer part, I'll rephrase:
---
You don't think instantly going the copyright+piracy route is aggressive against a friendly guy who probably thought he was doing something good?
---
You don't think you were aggressive, but to some you were. It's a matter of opinion and bias is obvious. So the debate is kinda pointless.
---
You just seemed confused why you were getting so much backlash. I offered an explanation.
---
I have a character on retail named juicyclit and it’s never raised an eyebrow
---
One of many reasons to avoid their server.
---
I had plenty of friends who had no interest to get on and do anything that wasn't 'permanent'.  I encouraged them all to log in anyways so they can make sure they have the servers setup good on release date.  More than half of them chose not to and that's with someone getting on them and telling them why they should.  The stress test really was poorly advertised too.  I had a great time getting on.  
---
The game is sooooooooooo smooth and fluid compared to pservers.  I'm really excited.  I got to level 5 and won't be playing anymore on the stress test, I just wanted to see how the game was running and help them prepare for the 'initial wave' as best I could.
---
Great plan.  Open up like 15 servers at 2PM on a  Wednesday for a stress test that wasn't really well advertised.
---
Then 10 minutes later get mad that not enough people are playing and delete 13 of the servers.
---
Why would they deny their chance to get extra money off a duel sub for the same price, youre  asking for the price to be less then people pay for runescape.
---
Launch day is going to be a shit fight isnt it
---
I'm one of the people who generally thinks this forum is way too up in arms about layering for the first couple weeks.
---
However, if it really is as easy as monkeynews is saying to daisy-chain your character onto whatever layer you want (seems like it would only take a couple days to work out which alts are bound to which layer), then it's actually incredibly destructive.
---
The people who get to max in this period can acquire world resources at an increased rate (coefficient equal to the number of layers). That means the players who get enough gathering can literally mine months worth of thorium, or black lotuses, etc, in a single week.
---
That's definitely not acceptable.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah I'm not sure what they expected.  It wasn't advertised anywhere outside of the Blue Post on the classic forums as far as I know.
---
Basically my plan too! Loved the shockadin in BGs in Vanilla/tBC. Except I'll probably get the +5% melee crit from the Ret tree before heading to Holy. Been on a Pserver and I've felt more crit starved than I used to for sure.
---
Im talking about the excessive amounts of these supposedly rare resources that will be farmed before layering is gone - if it does continue above 30. 
---
It only takes a handful of people to abuse this and heavily deflate the value of the materials value which would have lasting effects on the in-game economy.
---
idk, druid tanking was *barely* considered viable in TBC and only got that far after a few dedicated doodads pushed the envelope.
---
It wasn't exactly the easiest getting groups as a druid tank then. Even when you were good and could prove it. Though I will admit that managing it was a source of pride since this was before they let `swipe` hit all targets and Druid tanks had almost no AoE (I got really good and tabbing through enemies lol)
---
For me BC was the best as a feral druid even though it wasn't the time when feral was most powerful. But it's all personal preference. For me Wrath was the start of the downhill slope because raiding turned into an AoE facesmash-fest that the challenge was gone. After that Cata raiding just felt like an extended flash game to me.
---
There’ll be an addon for that.
---
The Taurens meshed well with Thrall, that's how they got to be close allies in the first place. The problem is that Thrall is a hippy by Orc standard, and almost every other orc leaders are completely different from Thrall, so this alliance stopped making sense once Thrall stepped down from warchief.
---
Imagine in an alternate WoWiverse where Tyrande and Malfurion perished in the battle of mount hyjal, and Illidan got to lead the NE because he's the most powerful among them, and Illidan allied with Sylvanas because of their shared hatred of Arthas. NE would be Horde, or Forsaken would be Alliance, depending on how their other connections play out.
---
There are other reasons too, like avoiding server merges in the future.
---
Could someone post a link to the sound please?
---
Maybe with your guild and tank, I never had the issue holding threat 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
You lose 20% every week no matter what you do
---
This isn't 1.6.
---
It's not that simple and entirely depends on everyone else on your faction too.
---
One week, 100k Honor might get you 5000 RP. The next week, more people might have more Honor and 100k Honor only gets you 3000 RP.
---
You always lose 20% of your RP every week no matter what you do, so you at least need to make up for that to keep your current progress. If you're rank 6 (20,000 RP), that means you need to earn 4000 RP that week to keep Rank 6.
---
By the gods do I want a classic plus approach
---
Alot of people really need to understand that there is absolutely no rush to get to 60 unless your guilds pushing for server/world firsts.
---
The experience of Vanilla/Classic is the journey to 60 and the people you meet along the way.
---
I'll definitely be taking some breaks to focus on Proffesions, probably after I snag my mount at 40.
---
Pantone found it before you.
---
It's not just to reserve names.  That's what it is on our end character creation and name reservation.  For them it's determining realm sizes pre launch so they can prepare servers for the launch day fiasco without having to over appropriate hardware to less populated servers.
---
If you sacrifice about 50dps using downranked spells you can last long enough for any fight. Introduces an element of "burn phases" and knowing when to use the right ranked spells. Still terrible dps but higher than tanks
---
I think Mand’kir yells “DING!”
---
Jin’do yells “Gratz, mon!”
---
I am putting a list together for the most scenic fun 1-300 spots in WoW for leveling fishing. i love that you gotta go to specific spots but the leveling ranges can varry a lot. 
---
for instance, 1-70 i exclusively did at the lake in mulgore just outside of bloodhoof village
---
what makes fishing sptos for me great if im watching tv is also seeing a living world go by -- 
---
bloodhoof village part of the lake where you see several wyverns fly above, taurens taking their first steps over to complete their late quests on the northern part of the lake. 
---
there's a really cool mound that portrudes the lake that lets you see all of these players triclking by you every 20 mins or so on food and via flying above. super chill lake, amazing scenery night or day.
---
this particular body of water is 70-100 and i picked this part so i could see the boat come in and out with allianace players and horde. i also get to see warriors swim to their island trials quests. chill all around.
---
fishing is awesome cuz its safe to level and is the super most casual thing in the game.
---
OP includes wrath in classic.  
---
well at least we know you have shit taste and have no clue what classic is.
---
Really simplified, you gain Contribution Points from Honor Kills and doing battlegrounds. Once a week during maintenance the server performs science to figure out the standings of all players on the server depending on their contribution points and awards players with Rating Points accordingly. Basically, play more get more. 
---
You Rating Points is what dictates your rank. You start at private with 0 RP, but &gt;15 HKs.   
---
Rank 2 is 2000 RP
---
Rank 3 is 5000 RP and on it goes increasing by 5000 every rank until you get 60000 at rank 14.
---
Now every week when the server calculates how many RP you get, it also decays your rank by 20%. This is 20% of your current RP. So if you are at rank 2 with 3000 RP, you will lose 20% of that, which is 600. So if you did absolutely no PvP at all that week you'll lose 600 RP and be bumped down to 2400 RP, still rank 2 though.
---
This decay is subtracted from your RP gains. So if you PvP'd enough to get 6000 RP you would gain 6000-600 = 5400 RP and end up at 8400 RP which is rank 3. 
---
Now as your rank climbs, your RP climbs as well and so does the decay. Your decay alone at rank 12 (50000 RP) is 10000, so if you skip that week you will lose two entire ranks. This is why it becomes much much harder to gain ranks beyond 10 or 11.  Your decay is so strong that you need to be among the best honor grinders on the server to get enough RP to even avoid losing your rank again. Added to this is that there is a limit to how many RP you can get, about 13k I think. So even if you completely max out your RP, which is almost impossible btw at higher ranks, you will still only gain a few thousand RP each week.
---
Yes
---
It really is. Unfortunately this subreddit removed its rule about spreading misinformation, and now there's a large group of people going around defending the current implementation of layering based on straight up lies.

Sitting in a circle with a bunch of other men playing with our weiners.
---
You’re not at work at 12pm?
---
When people start talking about "alts" in Classic I always chuckle a little.
---
Sure having one alt will be beneficial if you have the time but I can't imagine having one alt let alone more than that when considering how much time you have to sink into one character just to raid or PvP.
---
Mine still works, I'm actually shocked it still does.
---
I am aware, I was just confused by this.
---
` Kings, another grabs Imp Ret Aura in their holy builds`
---
Lfg - roll straight through was good?
---
WoD was a dumpster fire. Cata was also pretty bad, though perhaps a bit better in mindset.
---
I agree Mists was underappreciated.
---
In fact playing world of Warcraft is his day job
---
Layering wont remove player interaction. If it gets to that point, they will just reduce the number of layers.
---
 
---
Also, there is a difference between 100 people fighting over kobolds in golddeep mine, and 15 people fighting over kobolds in the mine. With one, you literally cannot progress, the other its a struggle but you can do it. 
---
One would cause people to just log out, and maybe not come back. The other offers a challenge.
---
They are not needed. Warriors should be able to stance dance or they’re not worth their weight to the raid. 
---
No race / class combo is “needed” and there will be NE priests that can run circles around dwarves priests. It’s more about the player than the race.
---
Not sure why this isn’t upvoted more. I was making something like this for myself on my Hunter and Druid. You did my work for me! Thank you

I haven’t bought into anything. Ewen McGregor is one of my favorite actors. I like him in other stuff too. What about Liam neeson, sam l Jackson, Ian mcdermid common.
---
Oh god the “world first” bragging has already begun and it’s still just a stress test -_-
---
You only kept your rank in TBC. People could see your highest rank by inspecting you though.
---
I meant instance designs for people doing actual heroics with guilds and groups.

When he came up out of the lava for the first time back in the day, I was dumb founded.
---
I will never play alliance, I tried it once and all of the other players were immature.
---
Sometimes we'll just start a reference and we don't even know where it's going.  We just hope we find it along the way.
---
Was watching the whole testing live. Pretty strong evidence that this is the case, although the exact amount of layers might be different. Pretty sad how they just renamed sharding to layering and it still has the same issues which leave room for abuse. Not to forget that there will never be a "one server one world" feel if it goes beyond the starting zones.

2.01 let you display the highest title you'd received.  That's looks like what I was remembering.  I don't ever remember my title de-ranking, but it's been a long time.
---
No that's August 13th character creation.
---
This is just testing that system out.
---
Oyea? then why are 99% of level 60s queueing for BGs instead of doing World PvP?
---
Not so much that every priest has to be a dwarf.
---
Correct, which is why you'll be able to use your PVP gear even if you go back down to Private/Scout. But you do not get to keep your title, you do not keep the 10% discount, and you do not keep access to the Officer's Barracks.
---
Sounds like you're describing a warlock.
---
I don't believe they will ever shut down classic.  Many will be content to play classic forever.
---
I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with anyone but what I think he is saying is that with the release of classic and all of the new knowledge we have about maximizing dps there will be a greater struggle for tanks to hold aggro. 
---
We are staying classic at 1.12 so your early vanilla raiding will already be inherently different. I dont know much about stats or item changes but it seems that most people agree that we got stronger in the later patches.
---
Mostly I think the difference he is trying to point out is that back during vanilla we weren't very good and dps weren't pushing as high as people have learned to do on pservers of over the last 10 years. With the addition of new metals to gather world buffs and every consumable the dps going into mc and bwl should be much higher than you experienced during vanilla. 
---
Unless of course your guild used every buff/consumable back then or doesnt plan to use any of the new dps meta for classic.
---
I’m all about cold, regular iced tea and trail mix!
---
I'm probably going not to use a leveling guide but I want to find a casual leveling guide specifically geared towards the quests that's are the most fun or interesting lore wise.
---
I wouldn't say people don't care about it. I at least feel a sense of awe at the sight of a rank 12+ and especially rank 14. On Nost I used to find out each weekly Grand Marshal and screenshot them. They will probably be akin to celebrities. Reaching rank 14 imo is a much grander achievement than a server first raid clear.
---
I’ll be having a good time. Avoiding STV and Tanaris is the best thing you can do for your sanity.
---
It definitely had potential. Problem is that it only lived up to 10% of it
---
Just Dungeons? My vote has to go to the spirit of Hakkar (from Sunken Temple.)
---
Runner-up is Balnazzar.
---
The dude who wrote the rule says corpse camping is griefing dude. Go ask Kevin Jordan. He is on Twitch.
---
The ToS uses "griefing" as an enforcable rule. So only things they deem worth GM action are "griefing".
---
I noticed that you didn't list 2/3 of the main characters. Weird.
---
Great explanation thanks. Others I've seen and on the wiki are so confusing.
---
No.  Westfall, Barrens launch day will be horrible without layering.
---
It needs to extend at least to those levels.  Cut it at 20 and we'll be fine.
---
Because if 100k ppl sub that's 1.5 million.  200k ppl is 3 million.  You do the math.
---
Lets them recoup money spent on development and server costs.
---
Or just don't sub and stress test.  You already know what the game is...
---
They'll shut it down if they think that will be the final push to converting more Classic players over to Retail.
---
And they'll shut it down if there aren't enough players to make supporting it cost effective.
---
Yeah okay - i ran out of time and got to cap and dungeoned but had no chance to guild up properly and raid so maybe any end goal felt lost in me. Have gone back to solo the raids and loved a lot of the cat ones
---
1.12 #nochanges
---
Oh sorry Blizzard, didn’t realize I had to quit my job and stay at home to do the stress test....
---
Maybe wait until...oh I don’t know, after 5pm?  When most people are getting off work???!!!!!?!
---
There is so much to so while leveling. You have to buy spells, auction items, level proffesions etc. Idk how everyone else can just zone out and power through levels. Building up my character while leveling was always the most enjoyable part to me. Got to remember to take lots of screenshots this time around.
---
I can't blame you, it's been 15 years. I only know because of the private servers. I've suffered through grinding like hell to rank 12 and then go on a week's holiday and be bumped down to rank 10 again x.x 
---
Which begs the question, will the huge populations on private servers mean that it's harder or easier to rank there compared to Classic? We'll just have to see, I can't wait to get my warlock up to rank 12+, maybe even going for 14.
---
OP might be from Latin America but that is a quote from the Starship Troopers movie.
---
STOP STANDING IN THE GODDAMN FIRE. 
---
I agree
---
That would be considered a change, they won't do that
---
Seems right:
---
&gt; The Honor System is created so that players have to continue killing the enemy in order to keep their ranks. If a player does not fight or does not earn as many points from week to week, his or her standing will fluctuate. Over time Honor points will "decay". If a player goes down in ranks, any titles he has earned will be taken away until the rank is earned back. As of patch 1.6, any items earned will not be taken away if your rank decays. If you earn the Grand Marshal gear, then you will be able to wear it forever, even if you stop PvPing. Which means you do not have to maintain the Rank of Grand Marshall/High Warlord it order to continue wearing the GM/HW Gear. ANY rank you obtain will be listed as a Former Rank so if you make Sergeant Major(Alliance) and take a month off and get demoted, you can still wear the Sgt Major gear you bought before.
---
[Source.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_\(pre-2.0\))  I'm not sure if that's from an official Blizzard quote or not.  It doesn't seem to be part of the patch notes for when they introduced it.
---
[Three-minute-mage](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2150050312201531-5052020123) = Arcane. You blow all your arcane tree 3 minute cooldowns and delete someone with pyroblast. People don't call it arcane mage because there are hardly any arcane nukes besides magic missiles, which you almost never cast unless 1) you get a clearcast or 2) you need uninterruptible damage.
---
(Don't copy that build verbatim, I just ham-fisted it really quick)
---
Lol what? People “appreciate” the second trilogy now? Who are these retards?
---
Well you could just include your offset. E.g. right now for me it's 12pm (+10)
---
Girlfriend? You mean your fiancee!
---
I’m glad you had fun!
---
No one is saying both, everyone that is saying meme specs are *possible* are doing it with the understanding that the amount of work that player will have to do is enormous compared to just playing the dps class analogue.  Feral is probably the best example with both the rotation being an absolute shitshow and the huge amount of MCP and other farming required just to keep up with hunters in later raids.  Meanwhile rogues can just show up with resist pots and enough instant poison and they are fine in virtually all fights.
---
Again, no one is saying that classic raids will look like pug retail raids just full of people regardless of class, but at the same time it would be stupid to think that the raids will look like what they do on private servers.  Vanilla is the best indicator, and if you actually did that content you'd remember having people in meme specs *in virtually every raid, even sometimes progression.*  No guild is going to have room for any more and a handful of these people, so you're absolutely correct that only a small fraction of people that dream of playing Enh or Ret are going to be allowed, but what everyone is saying, what everyone understands, is that if you are willing to work harder than everyone else in the raid *you might be allowed to play your meme build for fun throughout content*.
---
Stop setting up a strawman like everyone wants the majority of the dps to be non-traditional builds.
---
Why would you take a photo of your screen to upload to a website?

You underestimate the power of the Neckbeard.

Just to cover all parts of your question: you can respec from lvl 10. You don't *have* to wait till lvl 60.

Maybe if they started inviting more people for actual beta, instead of just streamers and people on the F&amp;F list.
---
I'm not paying to play for 2 days a month.
---
Is there some secret tech to subbing 2 days before character creation on 13th?
---
You guys are going to be so busy fucking around with the layers that everyone else will level past you.
---
If that's the case pick rogue, fury warrior, mage or warlock. Keep in mind warlocks aren't really good until they can get more hit gear (ZG patch)
---
This was agony, but I appreciate the courage.
---
do you have a source for all of phase 1 layering?
---
Thats why hes doing it right now on beta so he know how it works on release
---
Nope, no one. You must be super unique and special or something.

Huge graphical issue (and was told by guildies they saw it as well in other parts of the world). Appears to be something going on with the shaders.

---
Those are bound to the pink keys.
---
Yeah it is confusing and I don't really understand the details myself with the standings and stuff. But essentially it gets progressively harder to get a high amount of RP the higher your rank is. It has something to do with higher ranked people PvPing more and the server compares your honor to everyone else's. On private servers it wasn't uncommon to get honor in the millions. One WSG win will net you 1782 honor (2772 on holidays), plus some HKs means you will have to grind the fuck out of the BGs.
---
William Shatner's Tekwar?!?!?!?!?
---
My grinding vs questing is mainly for hunter and not aoe grinding, but I can partly answer this. 
---
On Classic Beta grinding is slower thanks to mob AI working, resistances being present and some differences due to bugs. 
---
It’s enough of a difference that we actually changed sections of the route to quests instead of grinding. 
---
There are some tethering issues with mage AOE grinding at the moment as well, no idea if this will be resolved
---
Are you a fucking imbecile? The first xxxx people that log into the game are assigned layer 1. It's full, the next xxxx people that log into the game are assigned layer 2.

I wouldn’t say NE’s racial is “useless.”  It used to be a blast shadowmelding on horde zeppelins and MCing people overboard once it left the tower.
---
How? I have so many questions.
---
What do you do for work?
---
What are your priorities? Friends, family, work, school, curricular activities?
---
I'm having a hard time trying to form and balance a schedule for playtime factoring just focusing on ONE Main and zero alts.
---
How does someone plan on having more than one alt at 60 in Classic let alone 8+ alts!?
---
When do you expect to hit 60 on your first / last toon?
---
Not meaning to sound rude. Im genuinely curious, even when I was 15 years old playing 8 hours a day in Vanilla with no responsibilites I couldn't fathom having one alt let alone more.
---
On its own, pickpocketing is only contributing a small amount to your overall cache when you're actually doing things like running dungeons. It's not insignificant, but it's also not amazing, either. Like, I wouldn't really be stealthing around dungeons and pickpocketing mobs, not even BRD. There's *far* better things you could be doing to make gold. BRD is probably the best bet for rogues simply because there's other things that were there (dark iron ore, rare enchanting recipe, etc) 
---
I still remember this song and dance on my rogue in vanilla. It's not insignificant, but I wouldn't make a strategy out of focusing on pickpocketing.
---
In BGs your pet spawns with you every time.
---
That tabard of the protector. One of the coolest items in game
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me, bro.
---
Why can’t Horde boys just let the alliance have their moment? Can’t have a hint of alliance appreciation without some mongrel automatically screeching loktar.
---
I was in Durotar and it was completely packed, there wasn't a single mob that was alive for most of it. And when they spawned they were instantly tagged.
---
My girlfriend on the other hand was on the same server in Durotar and the vast majority of mobs were alive.
---
Did he come up twice? I heard that was an issue for a long time.
---
Tauren Warrior
---
I plan to play one in classic! My main will be a holy priest of course, but my alt is going to go full retard with a beast mastery/survival hybrid melee spec. I'm going to spec for avoidance and try to off tank dungeons (splitting threat between my pet and myself) for a challenge lol
---
&gt; As a side note, the same goes for min-maxing.

but min-maxing *is* my fun. :-(
---
Openoffice is the best add-on for all games!

Grats
---
But you're not going to wear as much hit gear while using the gear waiting for the xbow.
---
And if you're in a loot council wouldn't you want to funnel the hit gear to someone who already has the xbow?
---
There's no reason to not to casually level your bank alt up to a point where the professions it has have a cooldown (transmute/mooncloth/etc)
---
I really hate spreading this secret around but on rested EXP it shoudn't take long at all as long as you route a rested 1-40+ properly. 
---
Cashing in every couple days on rested exp 1-45 you're looking at a casual ride to getting to a point where your profession can do a variety of things and your bank alt is a certified moneymaker. 
---
having 2 additional solid professions to aid your gold reserves for your main is really fun to me and it allows me to eventually get another 60 geared up when phases get a little to long for my liking.
---
Please don't listen to all the low IQ ppl in this thread, forcing players to get retail in order to play classic wow and charging 15$/month for a 15 year old game is an utter scam and needs to be highlighted more.
---
Lol right? This guys either not playing wow, or not staying married - I just don’t see door number three. I’ve known a lot people who have said “ahh man she’s cool, nothing will change.” Whoops never saw those guys again!
---
I won’t deny that. I was pretty miffed.
---
No, literally just you who is going to have fun with leveling. Have fun.
---
Why runecloth??? To trade in for reputation???
---
Dwarf rogue.
---
I quite like the last boss of Strath Living. You're beating on this old dude and think the fight is pretty easy BUT THEN! WHOOOOOOSH!! he reveals his true form and proceeds to beat the everliving fuck out of your group! Still today I find it epic and it's my favourite part of an orb run.
---
So you didn’t even click on the podcast and listen to portions of it and waste your time on it, which is why I thought we were here in the first place?

Why are you so upset? And taking so much time to hammer this home?

disclaimer: I'm not going to totally grief my parties. I plan on using nightfall in raids and spamming wing clip for more procs. But outside of raids will be interesting

Gl doing that on launch day (not happening)

If you are logged in and your current layer fills up you can create a new character that is then placed in the new layer if I'm understanding correctly.  
---
Using your example of the guy with two characters, if the only guy that makes two characters logs in with the second character and the first layer is not full the second character is also on layer one.

I’m sure you won’t be golfing where to find the murloc tiderunners as opposed to the deep sea murlocs. That’s using a guide you know!

There is definitely things from Legion in Classic.  there are several reports on the beta forums of Legion numbers being used in Classic.  Its making things easier than they should be.
---
I'm too lazy to give the official time in Sweden or wherever that arbitrary mark was placed.
---
It's the 5% that counts!
---
I would derive the most enjoyment from this game if I could play a strictly dps warrior. 
---
How difficult will that be? Will the community even allow it?
---
Depends on what you’re buffing in a raid. You could be the kings/imp conc aura Paladin, the Might, the imp Wisdom, etc. And you tailor your spec based on your assigned buff
---
Fighting against T3 in blues, probably not going to go so well.
---
I have never seen a ping under 350ms in Vanilla. I don’t think anyone in Australia did because we connected to NA servers. Can’t wait to PvP properly for the first time in Vanilla
---
Yeah it has its uses but it’s very situational and Dwarfs racial reigns over nelfs. Sucks cause nelf was my first character in vanilla and I loved them but man are they gimped.
---
I just find it funny that private servers seem way harder than Classic. People have said for years that private servers are easy mode compared to vanilla. No they are not, if anything it's the reverse.
---
Quest XP is king in the start area especially for chains. I know it can be hard to be patient but that patience pays off. If you aren’t a good tagging class then group up to get the numbers, so you can get the quest XP and move on. 
---
There’s no reason why you can’t opportunistically mob kill as you work through it. Players tend to leave some mob sections alone if they aren’t part of the quest. Kill those as you go.
---
Interesting. Dungeons for sure not, but I guess if you have the faith in your healers that could work
---
I think this is offset by the amount of quality booze you can procure in Ironforge however
---
Yeah this. I am going to enjoy the leveling process, probably several times. The first one is going to be quick, though.
---
No he didn't. 
---
If he did then clearly it's just his opinion(a shitty one at that) and not a rule considering the rule hasn't changed in over a decade and a half.
---
I just don't understand how you can't differentiate between griefing and PvP.
---
Not ONCE in 15+ years of WoW has there ever been a ban or disciplinary action for corpse camping or excessive ganking. Not a single example.
---
Beyond that, the ToS has a specific clause dedicated for JUST THIS TOPIC.
---
"The following actions may be considered dishonorable but are considered legitimate PvP tactics and will not be addressed by our Game Master staff.
---
-Corpse camping.
---
-Tricking players into getting flagged for PvP (i.e. jumping in the middle of another player's area effect spell).
---
-Killing players well below your level"
---
Directly from the ToS. It is NOT Griefing no matter how much your emotional bias wants to think it is.
---
Yep that's where we got ours.  We keep them velcroed to the side of our monitors as mementos.
---
Me too... the starting zones were packed full so me and a couple guys decided to skip the starting zone and 3v1 the lvl 5-6s outside the starting area. It was fun making friends so fast. We are lvl 8 and still going at it. 
---
Level, spell, and gear upgrades all feel noticable. Got some useful pvp items from some quests I normally never do and we're all having a blast. 
---
I have had more fun a few hours into the stress test than I have had in the past month of BfA.
---
&gt; Do people now appreciate the prequels or something? Since when?
---
Younger generations who watched the prequels when they were kids. There was also a number of articles that un-ironically listed things the prequels did better better than the originals (e.g. "It showed us Yoda in a lightsaber battle! Coooool!").
---
WotLK was peak WoW for me, but I also feel dungeon finder was the second stake into the heart of the game after flying mounts. I'd love to play pre-dungeon finder Wrath, but I suspect that will never be a thing, so I'm pretty torn.
---
Tauren have an increased melee range which reduces your deadzone, they get increased hp, and an aoe stun.  Orc pet damage isn't really too good and racial is melee attack power bonus.  Nightelfs have more agility then dwarfs and they can set up invis ganks or defend very well.  Stoneform is amazing.
---
it becomes less of an awe-struck experience once you realize that most rank 14s you've seen on Nost all rotated for it within faction and account shared with multiple people to get it done
---
same thing happened on vanilla. Everyone here remembers logging in for that one buddy who was grinding to rank 11 and was so close or even rank 13
---
the entire system is broken but i dont think it should be discarded to be honest. i wish it would get reworked and if a 1.13 future is gonna happen i can't see myself playing once they just add an honor vendor. 
---
i dont want to go to TBC because the solution blizz came up with to 'fix' this ranking system was extremely overkill IMO.
---
You should have posed this yesterday ;)
---
I agree good things came, but the world and immersion ruining conveniences like dungeon finder outweighs any benefit.
---
One of my guildies during wrath kept "Negropotamus" as his alt's name all the way to max level...then got reported for a name change in under a week.  "Scarynig" stuck indefinitely for another guildie, though.  Seems like blizz just hasn't done much hard-banning of inappropriate words in names.
---
In hindsight, I think we were all probably a little too old for those names to still be funny.
---
Priests will definitely be more popular than druids. Paladins/shamans are less popular than priests, but more than druids.
---
Really, every class is more popular than druids.
---
You say that like they don’t have all the numbers and an interest in generating revenue. Gonna let the cat out of the bag here.. they do!
---
Yup! Mine ran out a few months ago, actually.
---
I think that is a solid point - another is imp fear resist versus 8% speed increase for end content...I have been torn about that for a while
---
It's what I played in vanilla - pure fire mage - just used for dungeons and world pvp. I never did any raiding as I was a noob :)
---
You really just need to do some research to come to the understanding that even as a Dwarf, there's no firearm in the game that is better than Ashjre'thul and Nerubian Slavemaker. No scenario, at all.
---
I know, that was more like alt text for the image
---
Druids are real fun though if you can master them. Everyone loves a wg flagging dudu
---
Druid are a jack of all trades and master of none. (Except flag carrying)
---
You will usually only see one or two Druid's in a raid and they usually will be healing. They have some great utility spells that help raids.
---
They also have the most efficient mana to healing spell in the game (certain rank of Healing Touch)
---
They are great PvP healers but above all else, a well played Druid is a gear sponge. If you manage to show up and get into raids on a consistent basis, you will end up getting A LOT of gear that's passed on by Clothies/Rogues.
---
Not a playable race
---
dam. what's the point of playing druids then at all? Just to fill in the gap and intervate other healers lol?
---
The community generally doesn’t accept aided runs as legitimate runs. Otherwise fastest to 60 could be a boosted toon or mobtagger. Nothing wrong with someone sharing an account but it casts question marks in regards to legitimacy.
---
I’d rather it be free but I live in the real world.
---
Mage is very easy to level and get money on.  Pallies will probably bore her and hunter pet management / abilities / taming for rank ups ect is a lot for a new player.
---
I’ll level my Druid as restoration with no regrets.
---
I would rate it as Originals &gt; TFA &gt; Prequels &gt;&gt;&gt; TLJ. 
---
TLJ was absolutely a troll job through-and-through. The director wasn't even trying to hide it. Literally every aspect of it was specifically *designed* to be a giant middle finger to the existing fanbase and established canon.
---
They'll likely be more spots in raids for priests than druids, but generally every raid will bring at least one resto druid.
---
Unless you're wanting to be part of a world first guild, play what you want play. All healers will be viable in endgame.
---
It's a quick quest in Dire Maul for lvl 55 water. So yeah going to have to wait till phase 2.
---
But you can buy lvl 55 water from Argent Dawn vendor in the meantime.
---
Let's be honest.  We all knew it was going to be abused to fuck and back.  The ONLY real hope there is, is that Blizzard limits it to the first 2 weeks or so.  Otherwise it's going to be a shitshow.
---
Man it’s wild how popular wow really is. I used to type the vaguest quest details into google and it’s bring me right to thottbot.  This is the next level. Pretty nuts
---
I'm actually a university student and don't really expect to hit 60 on really any other characters except my main but I really want to try out all the classes to a decent extent (since they're all so unique in classic). I hope I can keep playing long-term and reach 60 on all of them if I really like the game. I've played some private servers to test it out and have had a lot of fun though it did take me days to get to 18 on a hunter. I'm hoping to do atleast 2 classes per each race (not undead). My list is kinda conflicting since idk what Night Elves are good for and if Dwarves make good hunters
---
If this is true then I need to make my undead priest look like he's in permanent pain lol

26. August 3 PM PDT is the same as 27. August 00:00 Paris time (This means as the clock turns 00:00 it is a new day, which is 27. August for Europe Paris Time.
---
The date on the shirt is correct.
---
I am not necessarily talking shit, as I mained a Pally in Vanilla and tanked raids in TBC. The main problem you will face is terrible itemization. You can't get a well balanced set of gear that gives you a good mix of stam, int, spell power, and defence/avoidance. You also have no means of regenerating mana in any meaningful way besides potting; thus there is a hard upper limit to your threat generation. Initial aggro and aoe aggro is fine, but tank any pull longer than a minute and you will be hopelessly OOM unless you hold back on your abilities and get cooperation from the group to DPS more slowly. 
---
For what gear is available, stack defensive pieces in most slots, then go for Int and spell power on your neck and rings and whatever other slots you can squeeze in. Strength is not that great. You will be sacrificing tankiness for more threat generation, but it's the way it goes for a Vanilla Prot Pally.
---
As far as strategy, I judge Righteousness first for initial threat on the first target. Conc and thorn damage is enough to keep the first target, so I switch to the next and judge Wis and reseal SoR. Stun the first target if it leaves you. After some good autos you can repeat on the next kill target. Stop Conc at 1/4 mana (or pot if you need more Concs) so you can continue to seal and judge.
---
Talent build, if you are tanking dungeons 90% of your time, something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVzZVhdIjzxoV0L. If you want to be able to heal in dungeons, raids, and do PVP support while also being able to tank, then more like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVeu0goZVGzIczx. Ditching Holy Shield hurts a lot, but this is a more well-rounded spec you can do it all with; even stack spell power and chance-on-hit effects and reck bomb a rogue in PVP while keeping your team alive.
---
I am glad this guy is testing the beta, constantly finding more ways to abuse the system......
---
Its classic everyones a mage
---
He is also bis gear with double spell power trinkets
---
Yeah that's probably true. And if the character had 'xiao' in the name it was probably bought on a chinese site.
---
I have synesthesia, it's very much like this -- just for a lot of things.
---
Well dwarfs are badass in cloth, they cast like bosses, and they have op racials...  If you don't like to look at dwarfs you should play horde.
---
Fair enough, I feel like an ass now, I read this as in you're gonna max out all these toons. Lol
---
?? Because pretty much all i love to do is pvp, and now that i have a family and play 2 hours a night, it means that i like to mindlessly farm honor? No, id rather not spend my 2 hours sitting in fucking queue, while doing nothing.
---
Indeed both dates are correct. It release at the “same time” world wide.
---
I reply to you because you reply to me. That's how a debate works. And this debate has been going on for so long, because you initially didn't understand how your title is clickbait.
---
And now your latest comment is just a rewrite of the classic troll "u mad bro?" so this is going nowhere.
---
to fight as a enh you should never depend on windfury...didn't use totems, nothing, just random tries to proc wf...weird way to play.
---
None of us can see a pic of a murky without hearing mrglrglrgl.
---
Very True.
---
Isn't level 35 required to hit 300 on Proffesions?
---
I was hoping to do just this with my bank alt over a long period of time. Getting them transmuted for Alchemy.
---
Provide little benefit and try to take loot from the people carrying you...
---
Look your not getting pally tier set in my runs if you dont heal and do less dps than the tank.
---
I wanted  to play in tree form but I know that didn't come out in classic wow. Legit the only reason why I like healing as a druid.
---
Omen of clarity bb
---
&gt; Attack of the Clones was not underappreciated. It's even worse than you remember. All that potentially saves it is the retroactive humour applied by modern-day memes.
---
That applies to all the prequels. By far best thing to come out of them was the Plinkett reviews (some of the funniest entertainment that exists on youtube IMO) and r/prequelmemes.
---
Tanking RFC with a shaman is nothing like what your experience will be at 60. It doesn’t prove anything at all.
---
This is really bad advice.
---
Druids aren't useless. You just wont top the dps/heal charts or anything with them.
---
That being said if you like PvP, Druids are pretty good in the right hands.
---
The point of rolling druid is that it is very unpopular, but needed, and as such you will have no trouble finding groups or guilds. Also, while they may be jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none, that makes them a very handy class for PvPing, lvling and other world shenanigans. 
---
And do mind, they are good healers, not the best, but absolutely decent! Pretty much like playing a hunter is decent dps, not the best, but we bring a bunch of good stuff as wel..
---
If you utilize garrote / remorseless they are very solid.
---
I hope everyone frantically tries to whisper random people trying to get invited out while I kill them. Will be entertaining when they fail the majority of the time.
---
i did this during BC in prep for what i wanted to main in WOTLK, i also got all the bg achievements along the way twinking at 19, 29 etc.  
---
by the time wrath came out i knew my class in and out and was very familiar with fighting every other class and their abilities.
---
resto druids or feral?
---
Depends what you mean, tanks are likely to always be around but the question is do they even want to run the dungeons you want to run?
---
Fact is tanks get guild groups by simply asking in gchat in seconds and only go to real pugs when nobody is online and even then, who says they need your dungeon? Tanks aren't usually just out there running for charity unless they have all vendor loot on reserve or something.
---
The stairs in ZF
---
Yeah! I recently got a MacBook Air as a company device to my Gaming PC(didn't want a windows laptop because I been on windows for my whole life and wanted to try something new and different to me). It runs decent with classic settings! I decided to cap it at 30 fps so I wouldn't have crazy dips might try a 40 fps cap as I get 40-50 fps in non crazy areas.
---
"6" is such an underrated binding
---
Looks like you are trying to play RetroWoW wit pre-bis blues vs Rank14/T3 gear. Yea, this looks accurate for that kinda of fight.
---
Voidwalker is best 99% of the time, the shield is just too good.
---
Yeah most likely, but day one server days is a good memory.
---
Hunter dps scales poorly after AQ40 and they get 2 raid spots for tranq.  I know in retail vanilla my Hunter sat outside Naxx many raid nights while we were progressing.  Fury warriors eat all so many dps slots in raids now making it worse.  Plus shaman don't help hunters as much as paladins.
---
Bop + free cast.  Death coil the will of the forsaken or net / nade.  Ally locks do more raid damage because they get salvation so they feel better.  So many people will go orc now that they know how op racial is.
---
All they need to do is restrict layering to when you're in a rested zone or perhaps nearby other party members [with internal cd ~10min].  Doesn't fix everything, but fixes the most obvious problems.
---
Why do some people not realize this is MEANT to be cringe? This is absolutely great though! Is this meant, at least in part, to be a tribute to Swifty?
---
He can't do that! Shoot him... Or something.
---
When is Blizzard going to realise layering just CANNOT make it in Classic WoW?!
---
I'm starting to get that old RAWR.exe feeling again... and I like it!
---
Is the creator of that prog still updating or planing anything for WoW classic?
---
Alliance warlock is very easy to level up and very enjoyable for pve / pvp.
---
I conceded I overstepped - even if lawyers are related to the copyright and piracy that you instantly brought up. Yet you still latch on to it and ignore 90% of my reply. Great.
---
This really needs fixing before launch.
---
What the hell did I just read? 
---
This makes zero sense.
---
Wild assumptions. People started leveling faster and faster because they've done it all before and gaming is inherently a competition.
---
If I get bored of Naxx and alts and fucking with the economy and PVP, then I'll quit until Blizzard releases TBC or overhauls Retail. Rolling on another fresh server has no appeal to me.
---
Yeah count me off the Classic train. Shame but, this is sharding with an extra step and I'm no bueno about that. The writing is on the wall and I'm not letting myself be hurt again.
---
&gt; The story was awesome I have no clue why you don’t like the story of freaking Star Wars.
---
I like the story of the originals. It was a good homage to the classics. 
---
The story of the prequels was the dumbest shit I had ever seen at the time. Literally all the characters were idiots and nothing anyone said/did made any sense. The tone was also all over the place.
---
This is a tiring argument, and I'm surprised it still surfaces. The only model that makes sense for Blizzard and consumers is to have one sub, so that Blizz doesn't lose any players, even if everyone transfers to Classic. This is a good thing for the longevity of the project.
---
Jawless UD makes the hunching and bones make sense.
---
Any spec really.
---
Just curious, but proof it was a “thing” in vanilla? Anecdotal evidence has been proven incorrect multiple times.
---
I like getting a little higher because it allows you to grind some areas better. For instance you're higher in areas like STV / Desolace/ Tanaris / etc. What's another 10 level? 
---
It becomes a real slog post 40 since that's the halfway point but it's worth it in terms of what you can collect at most levels.
---
You can change this in the options.
---
Dammit! :)
---
grats
---
Going crazy! can't make up my mind. Narrowed it down to Horde rogue vs druid for wpvp focus and bgs with the occasional raid but ill be playing casually because Life. I do enjoy healing but Im not sure about resto. Another issue I have is that I like Big crits... Any ideas would be appreciated! open to all classes and suggestions
---
I've been playing wow muted for 12 years. Turned the audio off so I could hear the raid leader better on vent and just got used to it.
---
"Do whatever the fuck you wanna do as long as it's not cheating" master race reporting!
---
It's Sticky Targeting.  You can turn it off in the Interface Options menu under Controls.
---
Considering it's better than BfA and I was playing BfA anyway then why not? It's more for your money.
---
better lyrics than the original.
---
I'm not going to main shaman because I want to tank raids at 60... I'm going to main shaman because shamans are fun. Believe it or not, there's a lot of content that happens before level 60, and there is no such thing as a class that is useless in raids. Spec? Maybe. But how you spend your time outside of raids is none of your raid's business.
---
Just wanted to reiterate some advice that not everyone lives by but should:
---
*Do not roll a class simply because it's lesser played on surveys*
---
This is almost always going to be a disaster for you.
---
For one thing, these surveys don't even indicate what the class proportion is going to look like *in your actual guild* which is ultimately where it really matters.
---
For two, being a class you just generally see less of server wide is *NOT* an effective substitute for playing a class you don't enjoy.
---
Trust me and others when we say this: PICK THE CLAS YOU ENJOY MOST mechanically. Don't tell you "enjoy" playing a lesser played class. Don't do it. You will just quit at 30 because you think it's boring or worse after hitting 60, and then not bother to start over.
---
At 60, you do not notice these statistics in your actual play. What matters most is that you are invested and engaged with your classes gameplay and mechanics. Picking based off of what is lesser played is a sure fire way to completely ignore this very important element of what class will truly stick for you.
---
I'm confused you realize there would be a subscription cost for both retail and classic no matter what right? So how are they scamming us by charging us 15 a month for both? When plenty of people already pay the sub for just retail. Scamming us would be requiring a separate sub for classic forcing people to choose paying a double sub amount or only playing retail or classic.
---
I'm not too sure about Pservers because I have no experience with it but from my friends I've spoken to who are interested in returning to play Classic the general consensus I seem to get is that they are excited to play from a fresh server with all the knowledge they have now from their days playing Vanilla.
---
I'm sure Pservers bring a min/max attitude but I see a lot of returning players with more of a optimal mindset when planning out their character this time round.
---
Most players that played Vanilla just picked the race/class they liked from WC3 or what class fantasy called to them and then go shoehorned into being a Paladin Healer or something like that.
---
With all the knowledge we have no it's only natural to not make the same "mistakes" or choices we did our first play through Azeroth.
---
What is it you don't understand my friend
---
RFC is about the only thing you are tanking as a Shaman.
---
For people who are afraid of being locked into roles, there are classes that can spec for different roles or scenarios, but basing it off your experience of tanking RFC at level 15 as a non-tanking class isn't ideal.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the reply. Did you play on pservers at all?
---
Ah I still have fond memories of my warlock friend shit talking me playing an enhancement during BC while we were leveling around level 40. Was using the ravager from SM, Challenged him to a duel. Got a storm strike crit, and a wind fury proc, followed by a shock equaled an insta-gibbed warlock.
---
pog definitely hosses only in this guild
---
Hardiness is great *when it procs.* Keep in mind a lot of classes don't even have reliable stuns. The big "wow" moments with hardiness are from resisting rogues and warriors and there's still a 56% chance in these specific match-ups that it will do nothing. As a hunter you'll have lots of opportunities to outplay these classes before it comes to that.
---
When I played most recently, I loved healing -- but this was as a disc/holy priest and resto druid in Pandaria and WoD. What should I expect from Classic healing?
---
That's cool but unless you're Resto spec or have 39 really cool guildmates, you're probably not going to raid as a Shaman.
---
I recommend you both level in your start areas to 10, do your class quests and meet up. Nelf needs to do hunter quest in Teldrassil and there is no paladin trainer in Nelf area Darnassus etc.
---
I predict new metas will quickly arise once people start dinging 60. 
---
I know people have already been playing private servers but those are just private servers at the end of the day.
---

Sword of 1000 truths
---
I think I’m going to be kicking back and enjoying more then I’d like. Girlfriend has never been into wow and every stress test I’m just making the sale. I have a feeling I’m going to end up rediscovering all of Azeroth with her. As slow as it might be with a newbie.
---
Downvoted because what are you 12? and I'm a piece of shit cynical scumb bag
---
Oooo I like that. You could get to know the people on your realm a lot better as well
---
How on earth does it make sense for me as a classic wow only consumer?
---
It is a lot harder to play a decent hunter then a decent rogue.  Rogue is one of the easiest classes to pvp with.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XVtDMipgFw&amp;t=3m39s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XVtDMipgFw&amp;t=3m39s)
---
Currently using a 1440p ultrawide myself, and don't think I could ever go back to 16:9 as a main monitor. The exta real estate is a godsend, and in WoW specifically it lets you keep non-critical UI elements available at a glance but out out of focus. Not made by me, but this video is a fantastic example. [https://youtu.be/oH78XPhpPM0](https://youtu.be/oH78XPhpPM0)
---
16:9 is about cramped compared to 21:9 as 4:3 is to 16:9, especially after getting used to it.
---
Most other modern games support it without any issues whatsoever as well. And then honestly any old monitor can be used for the second screen, just for having things on the side as someone else has already explained better than me.
---
I honestly don’t see how this will be possible. There’s no magical class balance coming, or new itemization. 
---
What could possibly bring about a meta change that’s been established for the last 14 years?
---
They nerfed heroic dungeons almost immediately. I had SO much fun with them at the start though, got like 60% of the heroic achievements right away.
---
The dooku actor was good. Yoda was Yoda like. Padme and Anakin has the lamest lines so I don’t think they had much of a shot. Who is part of this 2/3 the cast you speak of?
---
Well glad I made you chuckle.
---
I have ideas for each character. The warlock is on the chopping block if I dont get to all 4. Priest for my pvp because MC. Rogue for wpvp. Main, Druid for raiding. Besides its Classic. Im hoping they wait an awful long time before adding new content/expansions. And if they dont then it will last as long as it lasts. Only one I plan to really focus on is my Druids. Others are for funsies.
---
It could be, but the vast majority of people on private servers level pretty slowly. Pretty much the entire Classic community is represented on this subreddit and they can't even fill one private servers, let alone the dozens of others that exist. So there are hundreds of thousands who play on private servers but never comment on Reddit or are even aware of Reddit's existence if you can believe that o.O 
---
So when someone with PS experience says he wants to push for week 1 or 2 rag then he's in the extreme minority. On ND we have people who ding 60 now and are looking to join raids. And they are full aware that the server shuts down in two months. 
---
What I really think is the cause that over the years these people have done the leveling grind sooo many times and they just want to get it over with so they can get into the end-game. Raiding/grinding ranks is what they find fun, not the leveling. Which is fine of course, I myself am not a massive fan of leveling. 
---
Another reason is that you really want to "finish" the raids asap. By "finishing" them I mean getting all the loot from there so you can skip those raids later on. In case you didn't know, MC and especially BWL drop items that are on par with or even better than Naxxramas items. So if you're raiding Naxx, which is a whopping 15 boss raid, you still want to collect upgrades in the other raids. By being "finished" with MC and BWL early you can just skip those raids and focus entirely on AQ and Naxxramas, therefore you don't have a 4-5 day raid schedule like many do on private servers and during vanilla.
---
[Something like this, give or take a few points](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-500240130322215-05510310501)
---
I can definetly understand that. I was really young and dumb when I played vanilla. I raided 
---
Mc as a druid when I was like 13 with a friends and family guild and I cant even tell you what I did during raids. I was terrible lol. I'm definetly returning to classic with a more optimal mindset as well but not too extreme.
---
Bro, 95% of the posts on here are people saying they have no intention of min maxing or rushing anything. There are some who enjoy raising and pushing content, but that’s not a negative mentality. It’s just different
---
Ty
---
I and very many others don't give a rats ass about BFA, so we are literally forced to pay for the big product in order to get the small 15 year old sidekick, in other words: scam.
---
Priest leveling is chill and easy. If you struggle then you must just look it up how to do it and generally how to play. =/
---
It was literally the same story lol just earlier. What didn’t make sense to you?
---
Either way nothing can kill you. Pick whatever you like better and if shit goes south just trinket, bear form, and travel form.
---
I dont think its negative I'm just wondering where it comes from
---
Yep. It's ~800g of Runecloth without doing Darnassus quests. ~400g if you do.
---
&gt; Easily the best film in terms of lightsaber combat.
---
It has such an insane amount of flashy green-screen action sequences which drag on for so damn long, that they lose all impact. The prequels were the first time I realized that action sequences could actually become so empty and boring. I didn't even know that was possible.
---
The only way your argument makes sense is if you're trying to say Classic should have a less than $15 sub cost. But you didn't say that anywhere in your post.
---
Otherwise you're better off just paying $15 and getting access to both games.
---
Walk through this with me.
---
Let’s say you have a very difficult and demanding full time job.
---
Then let’s say you put in shitloads of hours outside of that job, whilst also managing a relationship, on a podcast that you publish for free.
---
Then a faceless, nameless person online comments about that podcast, saying you clickbaited me, when you’d never been accused of that before in 109 episodes of that podcast. And you disagree with their assessment of it being clickbait. They go on to explain that you’re responsible for roughly 20 seconds of their lost time.
---
During the exchange that follows, you then get called a douchebag, and have things that you supposedly said fabricated and thrown at you in order for the other person to bolster their argument. All the while remaining civil in response.
---
This is why we’re done here. I’m sorry you were jebaited. I’ll do better next time.
---
Me and my flatmate had full traveller's by around 40 on our original toons.  We spent 2 evenings farming for our level 40 mounts by fishing though.
---
Okay fine. We’ll ask Blizzard to separate the subs, but it costs the same as it always did.
---
In America wouldn’t it be 08.27.2019
---
Lol.... just... lol
---
It comes from enjoying a different aspect of the game, from being competitive. My best experiences in vanilla were raiding.
---
It won't be that low. Rogues and hunters too are probably the most popular "casual" classes other than warrior, that is to say, a HUUUGE chunk of people just roll rogue or hunter as completely casual players like non-subreddit visiting level casual.
---
Yeah I didn't hear about the stress test tonight until my cousin told me about it and I've been watching classic videos nonstop. Blizzard kind of dropped the ball on this one and anyways you need a sub to play the stress test right now. I'm not paying $15 to beta test something for 48 hours.
---
I'm really excited for August though. :P
---
You're not forced to pay for anything.
---
If it's not worth the money then play a private server. Simple. 
---
There's no point in complaining online about it.

Are you saying it's not worth 15 a month?
---
WoD does not deserve to be in the same group as cata and MoP. Those xpacs were miles better than wod.
---
Balance won't work. There's no leather spell damage gear phase 1/2. You won't have damage to kill a healer and you be super squishy in cloth against any physical dps.  
---
    
---
I mean it kinda works if you just pick on solo warrior/rogues that you open up on from max range (this is a popular balance pvp video theme).    
---
That basically leaves you with HotW spec or Swiftmend spec and they both basically play the same way - mf/is attrition while you kite and heal yourself. Not much fun to play in wpvp usually because it takes 2-3 mins to kill someone so often someone else will come along or they will call for help.
---
Why do we even say ding? That sound of triumph is nothing like a ding
---
[I could see something like this too, provides more utility at the cost of feral dps](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/514005301-5002301-05510310501)
---
Yet, don't be surprised when the new druid in your guild doesn't know that balance doesn't quite work in raids and that they will probably be healing or maybe feral tank/dps if they are really good. I meet a lot of people on private servers and it's not uncommon at all. It's actually quite astounding how many people have no clue about how their class works at level 60. 
---
Some people fear that team private server will have a huge advantage because they've nerded the game for many years and know every single detail about the game. Only a tiny fraction will have that knowledge.
---
Look man, I'm not trying to say I plan on main tanking MC as a shaman. I'm just saying "hey internet I did a thing, and you can do things too"

Manage your time better
---
Wtf did I just read? You do know that a lot of people that will play classic, already plays the new version. Plus if it was split then the price would still be 15 bucks, but then people who play both such as myself would have to pay $30 per month. It’s a simple 2 for 1 deal, don’t be stupid.
---
The main characters across the 3 films are Obi-Wan, Padme, and Anakin.  Considering you just admitted that 2 of those were bad, that's a pretty rough ratio.
---
I just feel that actual Blizzlike scripting and coding will be truly accurate. Private servers will never be truly blizzlike. I could be wrong but it's what I think.
---
I understand that the "first week Rag kill" people are the 1% . I also didnt enjoy leveling very much and want to spend my time pvping at 60
---
I have heard a bias then from people on pservers who act like everyone logged in is a professional raider. I'm exaggerating but still.
---
Couldn't say. I just watched the threat meter and wished I had a fade or vanish.
---
&gt; TFA is nowhere near "well recieved"
---
People thought that TFA was *leading* to a really good movie. It set up a lot of things which made everyone anticipate TLJ.
---
 It's why TLJ made so much money despite being a complete troll-job.
---
Who said anything about launch
---
By all means, you do you. 
---
Just don’t expect to compete with the optimal talent builds or pretend you’re equal in that capacity. As long as you agree with that, I don’t care what you do.
---
Ok so I'll play resto for raids, and if I want to dps in a raid I'll play an alt. Like I said in my previous comment, I do not plan on tanking raids as a shaman. I was just having fun, sorry if that's hard to understand for you
---
Saw a dev talking about it in a video, it was over a week ago and ive watched a lot of wow videos since, so no link.
---
Dude you could play a paladin that later falls victim to corruption that turns him into a death Knight, you know, like playing your own origin story
---
Retailers win either way, if they dont care about classic then nothing changes. Classic ppl lose because they have to pay full price for something they dont care about. Don't tell me classic alone should be 15$/month, because it is a 15 year old game seriously
---
I don't know if the stress test is more or less than what is going to be in a layer, but right now it's stupid.  It's hard to find any mobs to even grind.  Certain dense mob areas it's almost impossible to finish the quest because it's overflowing with people.  If a basic quest is almost impossible because there are too many people there, there's too many people in that layer.
---
Considering the sheer number of people who had just 1-2 characters (which they liked), it would have dealt a huge blow to the popularity of DK's.
---
I NEED MY MURKY

Ofc classic alone should be less than 15$/month, it's a 15 year old game thats probably going to have tons of bugs still

That's all I've been trying to say from the beginning lol. Optimization doesn't necessarily mean fun, and different people can have fun in game in different ways. That's all I'm saying
---
At least we're spotting this shit 2 months out.
---
WAIT, the same Karova that was just dying with me repeatedly in the river in STV trying to do a stress test Org raid?
---
Stop trying to fix a system you don't understand
---
WHAT ABOUT MURKY????
---
Ok First question:  
---
 **Also on alliance is there a major benefit to playing a Night elf hunter over a dwarf?**   
---
No, there are not. Dwarf hunter are actually better in the case of pvp, nelfs are only if you want to cheese with BM and control your pet while shadowmeld to kill lowbies and you have the highest base agi +1% dodge, other than that, dwarfs are better overall for pvp.
---
 **And can shadow priests do good dps in dungeons or is that for PvP only?**   
---
No. Shadow priests do great BURST, they melt faces, you will spend a lot of you want to dps as a shadow priest and even then you will place in the bottom as a dps, so if you want to play a spriest play it, you won't be helping your guild tho, I would say that being shadow priest and healing would be a lot more beneficial to your guild than taking a dps spot, that said a disc priest spamming smites is more mana efficient (that means you can sustain longer fights), even better if you have a retri paladin with the 10% holy dmg aura.
---
You actually went there, wow
---
Yep I feel you man, Classic is about the journey anyways. It's a marathon, not a race.
---
I think so this time I have a group of friends that I'm leveling with. The first time around I did it solo. I think leveling with other people will make it faster and more enjoyable.
---
This is beautiful, thanks for sharing fam.
---
Classic should obviously be less than 15$/month
---
Yeah I think there's nothing to solve.
---
Hunter in Deadmines
---
Lavishly Jeweled Ring drops
---
Hey, it’s 2 agi
---
I'll agree with you there, it was definitely the most expensive piece of shit out of those 3 pieces of shit.
---
Kind of a dick move, considering you could’ve gotten the quest done faster.
---
Unless you’re AOE grinding, quest completion XP is superior.
---
Literally a top post today tackling the same thing. I'm not sure which circlejerk is worse.
---
I certainly understand the competitive aspect. My favorite part of wow is pvp. I also understand that min/maxing is important because most people wont have multiple chars and need to commit to one, so they can't pick a weaker class/race combo if they want to be highly competitive. 
---
I enjoy playing a underpowered char in games. Like in smash bros I would pick a low tier char and do my best to beat S tier chars. So like playing meme specs while undergeared. That way if I win a fight against you I know its because I had more skill
---
wrath pvp was absurdly unbalanced, like way more than any other expansion. do you remember early DKs and ret pallies?
---
Yes, it's a condishun, don't handicap-shame me, you discriminating bigot.
---
How can you guarantee you'll be assigned a new layer when you exit and reopen, you could be Person 1 and then Person 4 when attempting to jump layers.
---
Yes.
---
I'm a night owl. So Instead of actually participating in the test, I was dreaming of it. It was the least I could do.
---
This is why they are having a stress test, my good man.
---
The example provided explained that Character 1 goes in Layer 1, Character 2 goes in Layer 2, etc.
---
Nobody knows for sure how this works, I'm simply pointing out the hole in current theory, I highly doubt my example will ever occur in practice.
---
But again, before TBC the meta never changed. Why would it change now?
---
Private server players aren't leveling fast to "beat the take down." Post-Nost/Post-Ely, most projects have been stable for some years. It's just fun to go into a new project with all of the information you learned from the previous servers. 
---
"I tried for this quest on the last fresh and it was a big bottleneck - I'll skip this time." It's like that, but for *every* aspect of your game. 
---
And there's merit to hunkering down on a server post-Naxx and just maxing your characters out, but you can't fault anyone for looking forward to a fresh server at that point. You'll see on Aug. 27th how fun and vibrant a fresh server can be, a state your server is in for a *very* fleeting time once in your server's lifetime.
---
No one is downvoting you because they want to raid as a ret pally, people are downvoting you because maybe there are people out there who want to do things in this game besides raid
---
So it's a PvE thing. That sets my mind at ease a bit.
---
In other words you get classic for free as a retailer player, while I who don't give a rats ass about retail have to pay the full 15$, seems very fair!
---
So rather than just group with him and kill the mob and move on you decided this was your course of action?
---
It's people like you with this shitty attitude who should stay on retail. But wahhh my exp, I hope you have the same attitude while looking for dungeon groups
---
The issue is that your post is phrased in very particular way that’s probably going to draw ire, even if it’s not what you’re ultimately saying :)
---
[Congrats](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ClutteredWastefulCuscus-size_restricted.gif)
---
The pictures are upside down and backwards
---
Hey man, I completely understand. It's just the title of the post is about not being afraid to be "locked into a role".
---
Unfortunately some classes / roles are locked at the end-game and there's nothing that can be done about that at a community/social level.
---
 Even if some amazing Balance Druid comes in 6th on DPS or a great Prot Paladin manages to Tank Naxx on your server, they will still be Unicorns. People will still expect certain roles from certain classes.
---
Cool story op.
---
It's kinda cute that you are fine with people who want to play both games having to pay for two subs, because you are too cheap to pay 15$ per month for a game you enjoy and (as it is the case with most people here) was waiting for 15 years.
---
Sub is fine. It's literally the case of "two items of cola with a 50% discount!" - it doesn't mean that you can buy one item with a discount, you have to get both of then
---
There are certainly more of them compared to OG vanilla, but it's not as much as it seems. I mean we are running with a fully fledged prot paladin in our raids, there's also a ret, two ferals and a boomkin and we still do well in Naxxramas. It's not like everyone are elitist jerks, we just like vanilla and have nowhere else to play. Therefore it's extra annoying that you had to have a subscription to get Classic beta. Though maybe it's for our own best, I can't imagine how many guilds would suddenly lose half their members because they got beta access haha.
---
Priests and paladins for alli
---
Priests and shamans for horde
---
I expect a much larger number of druids than there were in vanilla due to the increased awareness and understanding of the class, but even with that I don't think it will be nearly as popular as other healing classes are.
---
Also, druids will still always have a slot in raids if you intend to play them.
---
I’ve just started sorting by new and downvoting them all
---
Yeah, maybe I'll re-make my post later and word it in a way that states that what I said is true for 95% of the content of the game that isn't raiding
---
Are you implying they run 24 hour shifts?
---
Good point, maybe I'll re-make my post later and make a point that raiding is a different ball game, and I'm talking about the other 95% of the game
---
A shiny blue downvote
---
Had this...my dog chewed it to hell and I freaked. Still worked though
---
Played a holy priest from WoW alpha to Cataclysm. I will likely roll that as my main this time around. 
---
However, I don't have a ton of time in life to be a try-hard this go around. I am looking for something to alt that will complement my priest. I expect to play an hour or two every few days outside of raid times on the priest. I would like something that can farm gold and PVP. 
---
Based on that I am leaning toward mage or hunter. I've played a hunter extensively but am thinking about the mage on another account that my wife can play since she's never played and actually expressed interest this go around or I can use for porting for easy gold. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Per ACCOUNT? Or is the limit 3/realm
---
So the group offered to invite you and you declined and basically say "Lol No git gud I out tagged you"
---
......they're the dicks....how?
---
Yep, and one piece of fun I have planned is going to moonbrook on a pvp server and troll players who are not flagged for pvp. Come on guuuuys, too afraid to get ganked at level 16?! Thought this was part of the pvp immersion. Go roll pve for your safety deadmines runs /chicken
---
Damn, I didn't realize Blizzard had enough dicks to fill this many mouths. Full price it is I guess.
---
Horde or Alliance? It makes a difference.
---
Quick go post on /r/aita
---
I remember him having an animation bug where he popped up twice, if that's what you mean.
---
You example is flawed, two items of cola are the same, BFA and Classic are not.
---
test
---
Thank you for the very detailed response!
---
I believe he is going to choose healer. Mage or warrior are both very tempting.
---
kek. I'm in Rampage as their Feral tank.
---
I myself don’t think they are bad but they got the worst dialogue and people will just point to that and say bad acting. Padme is important but her role really isn’t that big outside of Anakins gf. I would say Anakin/obi wan/palps and the council were the main characters.
---
no, no its not 😁
---
And my comment isnt directed at those players. They are free to do whatever they’d like and I will never speak badly of them.
---
Nope.
---
When you hear the term "margin of error" in polling, its just a polite way of saying stupid people.
---
I'm sure that is true in the context of the speedrunning community. However the first level 60 is going to be a shared account and there isn't anywhere too boost from as no one is 60 yet.
---
I've always enjoyed watching speedruns, and I'm sure there will be nice little community of people trying to out pace each other in the 1-60 /played time. 
---
I'm sure their time won't be recorded in the annals of speedrunning history, but regardless the server first 60 will still be a shared account. 
---
There /played time doesn't even need to be as pristine because they can make up for it by not having to rest. I'm sure someone on every server will beat their /played time
---
Satire has always been hard for people to understand. Even during Chaucer’s day
---
Per account. Like they said.
---
It should be cheaper.
---
Alliance, which obviously means salv was a thing. But I don’t think we had many people using it.
---
The only time threat was ever close was right off the pull. Once I had aggro people could go nuts, and later in a fight I was miles ahead of everyone.
---
Honestly, RPPVP makes more sense. In a dramatic voice: "There are two factions at war, but the gods have forbidden battle unless you yell out /pvp first"
---
Imagine missing out on a great possible social/community experience on purpose and feeling good/superior because of it.
---
It's like if Irony and Ignorance had a baby and named it "This exact comment"
---
I AM ONE WITH THE WARRIOR INSIDE
---
Then why did she get you a shirt with the wrong date AND the wrong faction?
---
“I suspect massive downvotes.”
---
(I was acting like a piece of shit but I’m hoping I get validated via Reddit because I really don’t think I was wrong because I’m a piece of shit.)
---
K.
---
I really don't know what'll happen. If all of my friends play like they say they will, I'll probably level up faster than intended. But overall I'm looking forward to chill leveling/exploring with my gf and running a bunch of dungeons for fun.
---
Try to level on the stress test and see how long it takes you to get to level 10.  That's why.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2nsfi/classic_wow_hitbox_and_deadzone_mechanics/
---
Happy?
---
This i feel is the most accurate.
---
No, because if they make it any faster it won't be long enough for a monotized youtube video!
---
Everyone is just much better at the game now in general. Say boss X needs a sustained 5000 dps to be taken down. People are good enough now that reaching that 5000 dps will be easier, even in the same gear (though gear will still have a limitation). Maybe your group can do a total of 6000 dps, and you want to try out a new spec... Sure it won't be optimal, and maybe it won't be a new meta, but it's definitely more possible now than it was back then.
---
Also I made that number up, but you get my point
---
I get your message, I understand what you're throwing down, but on Reddit. You can say the same thing in two posts and depending on how they're written, one can get upvoted to the top page and the other can get downvoted into oblivion.
---
Bye
---
Yep layering sucks. but the retailers who blizzard most cares about appealing to cant tolerate a couple hours of crowded questing, so we get to have the entire world ruined instead.
---
&gt; It was literally the same story lol just earlier.
---
Uhh...it's not. The originals were the classic hero's journey and we closely followed the protagonist all the way through.
---
The prequels were nothing like that whatsoever.
---
&gt; What didn’t make sense to you?

Literally everything. [Mr Plinkett does a good job of covering all of it, feel free to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI)

Ninja isn't making the nightly news, anyone can publish a book and the most popular game in the world is still a game.  The average adult on the street will likely tell you, "Oh yeah, I know that fortfite game.  My kids play it".  and thats the extend of their knowledge.
---
I didn't insinuate that you are a fortnite kid.  I assumed you were a part of that demographic i.e likely under 20.  
---
The reason I assume this is you are falling into the trap that most kids do.  That the things YOU know and YOU are interested in are the same as everyone else.
---
It's not a personal attack to say that WoW is niche.  It's just a reality.  The same as Twitch.  Facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube etc absolutely DWARF twitch in viewershipand public awareness.
---
The reason for this
---
 your so funny !!!! I'm sharing on Twitter, YouTube, all me friends, family, coworkers, my boss. Thank you. Greatest video ever, I can't wait till I can get over the laughing induced pain I'm in. My sides hurt. Go die

---
Actually, in russian it is kOrova, while u normally pronounce it is kArova
---
That's good to hear. I enjoy the "meme" specs because I think they are fun to play!
---
We were playing on server 3 when they seem to have added another layer. The server went from almost unplayable lag plus hundreds of people in the orc starting zone making it impossible to do any quests. To super smooth. No lag at all and still quite a few people to fight over mobs with but not a crazy amount. I'm for it for the first few zones for sure.
---
The big D dps had to really watch threat.  World 2nd nef kill on Medivh.  Fury warrs definitely wanted salv.  I remember certain fights the rogue group calling vanishes and the fury warriors joking.
---
Good shot man, that was more common in classic than people want to admit.
---
Because i suck
---
Damn ill try harder to get it under 10mins! I think it's possible.
---
I'm certainly not going to power level. I will likely do dungeons/pvp/class quests, even though they are like innefficient for levelling. That being said I probably want to hit level 60 within 2 or so months, so I might draw a line on my extracurricular activities.
---
I mean there were 2 servers. If you started before the others closed it wasn't crowded.
---
I thought this was it
---
Did they not have settings in vanilla either? Why wouldn’t you check there first?
---
Fair enough :)
---
I'm just here for the 2004-era insult N O S T A L G I A
---
Build is a bit of a stretch here haha
---
They should make a layered and a non layered server.  Would be great to see all the people stuck at level 4 on the non layered server.
---
That's the client for the stress test.
---
How old are you? Your argument is bad, and your refusing to see the companies logic because "it's old." 
---
They're putting actual work into this project. They Will have to pay people to maintain it. Fifteen dollars is actually cheaper now than it was back when classic was released (inflation).
---
Get over it. Or don't pay, and go to a private server. If you plan on replying, at least go copy and paste someone else's argument. It'll make more sense.
---
physical authentication device didnt exist until 2008.
---
I would love to walk with you.
---
Let's say you watch Classic videos. A lot of them are suspiciously juuuust over 10:00. A lot of them also are very clickbaity. Most recently you've watched a video about World Buffs Exploits where the conclusion was that a statement from the original devs is required to shed light on the matter. 
---
Then you see a reddit post about an Ex-Dev and World Buffs. You get excited. But it turns out it was clickbait. You post that it's rather clickbait. The creator flat out denies it's clickbait. You lay out the facts that's it's clickbait and that maybe he didn't intend it to be clickbait. The creator responds in a dismissive passive aggressive tone. You try again, breaking down the facts even further to make it abundantly clear that it's clickbait, and you're getting a bit more annoyed that this is necessary.
---
The creator is already riled up because of a different topic and he understandably can't keep track of who responded to what. The creator then writes a sob story that's irrelevant to the clickbait topic. But at least it makes you realise that he has put a lot of time into this. And that the clickbait, most likely unintentional, got blown out of proportions.
---
Don’t Die
---
Assembled* lol but nah, just no soldering.. which is nice
---
Yeah this survey is a pipe dream and people need to take off those Rosey glasses if anyone thinks this survey is accurate.
---
Hunter as second least played on horde? Get real.
---
most people on this sub are probably millenials, btw
---
It's an authenticator. It means that whoever is trying to access your account must have that one authenticator. Bnet will ask for a code and the authenticator gives you one to put in. It's nice because even if someone gets your account details, unless they have that authenticator in their phyiscal posession, they still can't get into your account.
---
For the first week, lol.
---
He also used layering to get multiply Node spawns. Blizzard come on!
---
Can this comment be the video instead?
---
Very true. I think what people read is different than what I tried to say. I'll sleep on it and give it another go because I really wanted to open a  bigger, more positive discussion
---
So, one thing I've still been wondering is this: let's say I play a Tauren Hunter. As expected, my minimum range is going to be larger than usual, but what about my maximum range? The video covered the opposite example (range of the player fighting the Tauren) but I'm curious about the Tauren's range.
---
For example, if the minimum range is 5 yards bigger, will the max range also be 5 yards bigger, or does it not change because the enemy's player sphere is still 3 yards (assuming I'm fighting a human) and so it's just 3 + range of spell.
---
I would say you should expect less homogenized healing. Not every class is good at every thing in classic. Expect to have fights where a healer may need to rotate out for a DPS or vice versa.
---
Cata pre-DS was easily my favorite time in WoW.  Hard heroic dungeons, fun dungeon achievements with a great reward, 10-man raiding with great raid tiers.  It was an absolutely blast.  My only issue was Heroic Firelands felt easy, except for heroic Rag who was about 10 notches above every other boss.
---
Then dragon soul.....it killed 10 man raids, and the two final fights were absolutely terrible.  It also lasted forever.
---
Yeah these surveys are gonna be way fucking wrong once the game drops and people realize how much leveling can suck.
---
It was less about dps, and more about what we called "drunk awareness."
---
Hi, /u/Banner248

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2qlgg/who_would_be_interested_in_starting_a_druid_ooga/). 
---
It's challenging to kill lvl 58s, and the death ray is hella fun
---
OK, I get you now. I disagree though.
---
Yes, I played a lot of K1, but still not more than I played Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK.
---
You realize you'll be able to use an authenticator on classic... right?
---
haha well honestly if someone finds something fun in Classic then by all means they should enjoy it.  There will be plenty of people trying for world first lvl 60 at launch and then speedrunning to 60 for a long time to come, which is a great min-maxy way to have fun in the game.
---
The only problem comes when min-maxers want to change Vanilla to make it easier for them to have that fun, such as speed-running raiders who think the Onyxia buff that you get from raiding should be changed to not work in raids.
---
Would love to see all the "no layering" people stuck on an unlayered server spending an hour trying to finish simple kill quests.
---
It was a duel wielding furry vs a pally. Both rolling for an off spec pvp weapon.
---
You can’t submit a ticket?  That’s a shame considering they’d be able to “fix” this really easily by telling you to check your settings and turn it off.
---
https://youtu.be/D-q5QIOtmBk
---
This Kalas video from the AV test. Its lvl 58 so gear isnt perfect or anything but neither are the people he fights. You can see that mana is a pretty decent concern but not class breaking. From what I understand you can kill almost anyone and maybe a second person but then you will need to drink. Or use mana pots constantly
---
I thought that they stopped giving out beta invites, guess I was wrong!
---
My first character was a human warlock. 
---
What a bad idea.
---
I have no issues with the subscription having more value, I do have a problem locking the testing behind a paywall. No other WoW beta has done this. But Blizzard knows there people with low convictions. I’ve played Classic when it was relevant so the wait till August doesn’t bother me but I can definitely say limiting the amount of available testers is dumb to me. Open it up wider so more people can test the game.
---
I had people doing this to me, I would cast on it and they would just barely tag it with a throwing weapon or something. I would end up with the aggro and they would run off and tag 2 more. I invited them to group and they responded "nah". I asked them to kill this thing as its their tag, they said "no thanks". They forced me to either leave the spot I was camping or kill it for them. Amazing, lol. I continued to talk to them and they acted just like you. I passed him in leveling about an hour later.
---
Frost was better against melee; fire was better against casters. That was how it was in classic. (Then TBC arrived, and frost was better against everything outside of raids.)
---
At lvl 20, Pyroblast is about the same as two frostbolts (125 mana vs 130), and does 40% more (220 vs 156).
---
If you open with a frostbolt against a caster or a polymorphed melee mob at close range, that's an extra \~4 seconds the mob has to attack you. By lvl 20, you could have a 41-range Pyroblast, vs just a 30-range Frostbolt. Not uncommon for a fire mage to kill things before the mob, running at full speed, could reach the mage; I say this from observation as I was a frost mage, and when I tested out Pyroblast it was without extra range for fire spells as I would follow it up with Frostbolt (36 yard range with talents).
---
Couldn't they just tell their employees to come in a few hours late that day and stay a few hours over? No overtime and you can still have staff after work hours.
---
Congrats, you have an active sub.
---
Only about 40 hours left to get your game time in.
---
Streamer server.  Cringe.
---
Why is it always so fuckin' windy in the spirit plane?
---
Maybe because WoD was the beginning of awful class design. Honestly the content was okay but there wasn't enough of it.
---
Ain’t nobody wants to see my half mast
---
Have you realized yet that you only got into the stress test?
---
Oh, that's so cool!
---
I don’t think you understand what the word scam means.
---
When does balance PvP become more viable? When BWL comes out?
---
There’s a lot of talk about leeway. Hitbox size (ie Tauren) isn’t really controversial at all though no.
---
“Are you a child or surrounded by other children?” Sounds petty to me.  
---
Not sure why you were so hateful about it haha. Could have just mentioned that you have a good time with your work mates and that it isn’t always bad. But you added the children part to try undermine the op. Not cool imo.
---
i dont understand
---
I'm just playing relatively casually with a couple of friends. One will be Druid and the other will be Shaman. The druid hasn't played before and he'll probably be feral and just focus on DPS (mostly in cat form, I don't think he'll try and tank at all). The Shammy will probably go resto, so we should be fine for healing.
---
I wanted to play Rogue, but I feel like it won't be too viable, considering the Druid will already be basically a Rogue. Should I just go Warrior to keep roles simple? Does it really matter since we're going to be pretty casual anyway?
---
Alright settle down folks, come on. If you let people get to you they'll bring you down to there level and beat you with experience.
---
So I've thought about this and had a chat with a few friends and we discussed how it would be nice if blizzard offered a small % discount for players who opt for a Classic WoW Only option (or something similar).
---
So maybe it would work something like;
---
Classic WoW ONLY access - $12 per month.
---
World of Warcraft full subscription access (including Classic WoW) - $15 per month.
---
This way it gives players like myself the option of opting for classic only, as I honestly feel like I shouldn't have to pay more as a customer for a service I will never use (Blizzard absolutely know this and it's why they are tying both game together into a single subscription). 
---
Has anyone else brainstormed similar ideas or have suggestions? It would be cool to hear them.
---
I've never played horde before. How much AP does an orc get from blood fury racial? I believe the skill says 25% of base AP. So it wouldn't factor in gear correct? At level 60 how much AP does an orc have baseline?
---
Will blizzard even listen?
---
Hunter is, in my opinion, far more fun than any of the other classes. I could have a ton of fun on any class with a group of friends constantly online to play with. Without that tho, Hunter is the only one I find enjoyable to just play by myself. I debated a long time on what to play, even thought about playing two classes (one with people and one for solo) but at the end of the day just decided to go with what is fun, the hunter
---
System of a Down, Slipknot and Korn were my big 3 in vanilla.
---
I still remember listening to See You on the Other Side by Korn while in Tirisfal glades leveling an undead warlock. I ended up ditching that warlock after only like 30 levels but I still remember that glimpse into the past for whatever reason.
---
That is an awesome observation. Thank you for posting that.
---
Unless it's a quest that requires loot. Those are best solo.
---
I always interpreted it as beginning with a 'buh' sound. So like:
---
BOEESHIUMMMMMM
---
You're delivery with the post makes you sound like a dink but other then that your point is completely valid.
---
No boars on any server.  Hopefully wont be that bad at launch with more servers on the list

Honestly wow sub is cheaper than it's ever been think of inflation over 15 years and wow is still 15 a month im getting rid of 3 different streaming services and that is freeing up 2 subs me and the wife's
---
I wish I could be a fly on the wall when the realization hits...
---
Around 5:23 during the in depth section I cover how to calculate the player sphere. Ranged abilities are based off distance to the outside boundary of the player sphere.
---
Non tauren vs non tauren = 3 yd player sphere (35 yd auto shot will be able to hit from 38 yards)
---
Tauren vs Tauren = 8.1 yard player sphere (35 yd auto shot will be able to hit from 43.1 yards)
---
This happened for about 30 seconds only a handful of times, if this is the experience on launch we will all be very very lucky!
---
Man it's so sad. We were so close to having an authentic recreation, but nope, they had the add the #1 worst feature to classic anyway. So much for the community.
---
How does someone like ProZD make his money then if majority of his videos are under 2 mins?

Ya, I am not sure what this post is about, LOL

Yeah me neither—the US is the only country in the world

Yep. Just realized it now, after doing some googling. Slightly disappointing, but... Eh.
---
Hopefully before 2 weeks, definetly before phase 2. That could be a long time though. If the population doesn’t dip off as fast as Blizzard predicts (I think they’re off the mark there) then they may need to extend it until Phase 2, which is why they’re not giving any certain terms. They’ve also said there’s no certain terms about when phases are coming in, it will be based on community response.
---
Which, what is phase 2 anyways? It’s Dire Maul and Honor, two systems that weren’t even in the game for some time, DM being 3 months in, 
---
So Blizzard could have layering for 3 months, without lying. They’ve kept their verbiage very open and vague on purpose, so they have a wide margin of error without being openly dishonest.
---
Warrior is probably your best bet, less competition for the druid, it would also round you guys out.
---
I am crashing when I change to windowed mode no matter graphics settings or monitor used. A bit of an issue but it’s beta.
---
She probobly got it from the superior EU store.
---
Kelthuzad has entered chat.
---
Spot on my friend. Cheaper option for only classic and normal price for retail and classic in one package. And as you said, Blizzard absolutely know many players will only play classic, so they have to scam these players by forcing them to pay full price if classic is their only desire.
---
A lot of raid mechanics can be ignored if your dps is good enough.
---
278% slower Onyxia time.
---
22% slower MC time.
---
30% slower BWL time.
---
Disbanded before ZG.
---
Yep, should have gone with a Fury tank.
---
Or just make it so you have to be in a major city and there is a cool down on switching layers. You should only be switching layers to play with friends or guildmates. When you switch, you are stickied to that new realm. There doesn't need to be a very short cool down on that. I would say treat it like a character transfer and war mode. Have to be in a major city and 3 day cool down. PROBLEM SOLVED!
---
Big crits, caster.
---
Lots of medium sized crits often, rogue.
---
Flexibility and be a nightmare to kill in OWPvP, druid.
---
It's not a private server specific trait. Actually every single game invented has a meta game. Go and play hearts with your grandma and you can min max it. Your theory ignores the fact that this practice is present in all games.
---
&gt; Will the community even allow it?
---
Yes DPS warriors are very strong with gear.
---
There's just going to be a ton of them because of this.
---
Oh shit idk. I'm not sure if he's in the stress test or not. His username is in the post though!
---
What do you mean “nope”? In America it’s MM/DD lol
---
welcome to classic. can't quest complete when you have 347234379 in the same zone off the bat. So grinding anything that moves is the best option.
---
i never said they were the dicks...
---
The person who writes the guides and has done it multiple times took just shy of 117 hours with the best leveling class in the game to set the record. Unless all 306 are all rolling hunter and plan to destroy the record, I’d say it’s impossible. Neckbeard’s aren’t that powerful 😉
---
I know what you're saying.
---
Just be careful with your wording, calling them scammers and other things just brings out people to be defensive in there comments (take a look)
---
If you want to have a discussion, word it as such.
---
I love it makes the cows more interesting. hell gnomes can fit in places other races can't it's the quirks of vanilla that makes it great balancing everything made wow lame
---
I’m American and I promise that the date on that shirt is not the correct format..
---
Its all lost mate, why would they let you keep it?
---
Seems fine
---
whatcha mean, I just had a great social experience and gave them one too!....
---
Why would they let you keep them?
---
Once all the beta / stress tests are done those characters are gone.
---
\&gt;The meme specs will die out  
---
In vanilla, I had a feral druid decked out in BWL/AQ40/Naxx epics. None of it actually tier, obviously. But there were a decent number of good feral items even in Naxx. (Like Ghoul Skin Tunic)
---
Now, admittedly, it's moronic. And it takes a very dedicated asshole with a very tolerant guild for it to be possible.
---
I think the melee leeway was a lot higher than anything in WoD or BFA.
---
what's wrong with being an asshole? Dog eat dog world.
---
Everything will be wiped before launch. Couldn't say about during that window though.
---
No, you don't keep them.
---
No, I don't believe they were but its a change I actually like so I'm not complaining
---
nah he kept crying, I kept getting XP and more kills in my circuits.
---
Sit in moonglade sometime. (Bonus points if you're a druid) 95% of moonglade is never SEEN.
---
I misunderstood, you are right. I thought you were saying it comes out on the 27th in America not the 26th.
---
There's absolutely no valid argument against them not being a toggleable option.
---
Yeah, I'll have to play with it but I'll probably skip SoC and the +Strength for LoH and the Resists. Not quite sure either. But props for having the same annoying never dying playstyle as me.
---
Hunters have more rpg elements than any other class. Hell the pets will leave you if you neglect them mage on the other hand seem boring in pve as spamming frostbolt will get old real quick
---
because no matter how I spin it - those who disagree with the point will still be pissy and calling me a dick anyways - so might as well just play the part.
---
You lost me at anything related to arenas and Mythic content. 
---
I hope to god you’re trolling, because you just caused a shitstorm.
---
Actually crashes when I choose my card as well.
---
i was on board with layering, thought it was a decent idea for the launch. i was wrong.  sadly its just as you said, its getting exploited out the ass (these sort of things have been going on since beta started) and blizzard doesnt seem able to fix it.   
---
and we dont even know how long phases are going to last.
---
People like you are the lifeforce to big business, stupid and naive
---
Healers are always in need. Anyone who says otherwise is out of their mind. Every mmo for the history of forever has always had a shortage of tanks and healers. Regardless of how many people claim they are going to go priest or druid, there will be many who don't stick with it or don't make it. Just play whatever you want. There will definitely be more priests than druids, though.
---
What about hunter dead zones need to be looked at?
---
nah he's def quoting the metallica album name
---
Yeah I just don't know if the player sphere is relevant or not for this example. You covered the opposite example of a mage pyroblasting a Tauren, but not the other way around. And it's honestly the only thing I've been wanting to know for the past few weeks.
---
Here, I'll reword it to be more exact about my question:
---
For any ranged spell of any race fighting any other race, is the difference between their max ranged distance and their minimum ranged distance a constant, or does the difference depend on the player sphere of your opponent, you, or both?
---
Hahaha, I’ve been deciding between rogue, warrior, priest and hunter for so long. Also paladin for a bit because I love protection but realized everyone would  ant me to heal at 60. 
---
For priest I really want to be shadow cause I mostly PvP but I would hate ya o always have to respec holy disc and heal for pve. ( i healed from vanilla - wotlk so I’d rather not do it again. 
---
Rogue seems like a blast but not the best battleground class
---
Warrior seems fun and I could handle the struggle for leveling but people say it can be expensive and a pain to pvp when solo without a pocket healer 
---
So hahaha, hunter it is. And I know I’ll make a warrior alt someday, just can’t decide if I wanna make a orc Tauren or gnome warrior. But atleast I know I’ll be starting on an orc hunter to start it out
---
Thanks mate
---
Hey, folks. I'm the author of AutoLootPlus. I haven't checked to see if I have access to the beta but I'll try to look into updating the addon for Classic.
---
I had a female Gnome prot warrior named Gnomosexual that never got reported. She had the pink pigtails look and everything. I always kind of expected her to get flagged but it just never happened. 
---
I'm also a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, so I had a lot of those names (Tyrion, etc.) taken back in vanilla and BC. After Game of Thrones came out everyone suddenly started losing their shit when I said anything in trade. I thought that was funny.
---
This is wow reddit, I don't have to be politically correct with every word I use, everyone here knows what I mean by using that word and you are only trying to be cute with your definitions. HEHE YOU DONT REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS WORD DO YOU HEHEHE
---
Who?
---
oh they'll listen. they'll say they are working on it but i bet launch and phase one will come and go with no fix lol.
---
Two each there own i guess taste is subjective I love classic for the social elements alone when I played legion I felt so alone but back in the day my friends list was full
---
I suppose you could always add an intro!
---
It wasn't not part of Classic until right before TBC. Why do players on this subreddit pretend that is how Classic BGs worked? Did you play pre 1.12? It is obvious most posters here never did. Real shame to see the same "QoL" changes that destroyed servers on Retail also destroy Classic. Nobody cares about your scheduled playtime. Go play a different game.
---
yeah.... guilty of doing this too. but sometimes this can backfire if they get greedy and continue pulling fresh spawns and you disengage and now they have 3-4 mobs on them. 
---
Dont bother trying to grief them back in this format if they are a Paladin or Priest. They can survive it AFIAK.
---
How do they know what layer they're in to begin with?
---
I get how they can confirm if they're in a given layer by other things, such as a given player being present in a given area, but how do you know "Oh this is layer one, this is layer two" etc?
---
I think you have some severe problems man.
---
I lost interest in beta and started on a private server. Plus I only resubbed for a month which expired Sunday.
---
The only thing I'd like to see for classic would be Transmog.
---
There's a lot of cool cosmetic armor sets while you level like the steel plate or the Scarlet Crusade outfit.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing people make classic transmog sets. Beats seeing a mix match of the same gear on every class. 
---
I for one would love to be able to wear just pants boots/belt and a large 2h axe. No shoulders/helm/chest.
---
Gotta go to redridge that elite orc drops those sick shoulders.
---
&gt; hell gnomes can ~~fit~~drown in places other races can't
---
"Didn't we have a gnome in our party a bit ago?"
---
I have tried that before in this reddit, it wouldn't work even if I were the worlds best lawyer. Just stating some facts and complaining about it in my own way :)
---
So you're 14. You think you know something and the rest of the world is oblivious and they just won't see the truth.
---
I'm sorry. You'll get over this phase in a few years. It'll be ok.
---
Man wtf are blizzard bucks and wow tokens. Sounds made up although I'm sure its not lol
---
Yeah I just was scoping out Durotar and Deathknell, and holy fuck its impossible to quest.

**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Progression**
---
**&lt;About Us&gt;**
---
&lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again. Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing different expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW.
---
**&lt;What we provide&gt;** 
---
We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** 
---
We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** 
---
Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate Raid Times: Our current raid times are tentative, but we’re looking at raiding Sundays and 1-2 times during the work week. Most of our members are located in PDT and CDT time zones. - Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT - Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** 
---
We’re actively recruiting all classes and specs. Our current roster is available here. docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing

---
If you have further questions, please message me or join our Discord.
---
After seeing the ooga gang I kinda wanna roll rogue now..
---
Nothing, it's just a leeway interaction and leeway shouldn't be there.
---
So I can finally roleplay as legendary Dwarf hunter, Pewpewpew?  
---
Awesome. I look forward to every single person I meet yelling at me for not RPing right.
---
Someone told me to stop yelling in vent during Wrath Onyxia. it was DBM playing the moar dots sounds.
---
I mean, if we go back to the original reason this silly comment chain happened it was about South Park. And I'd say, yeah, most people who will be watching the new SP season will be well aware of what streaming is.
---
comedy.
---
The min-max difference is always the same since it is the distance FROM the player sphere's edge.
---
Sorry about that was a bit confused.
---
The 8 yard minimum will always be 8 yards from player sphere edge.
---
The 35 yard maximum will always be 35 yards from player sphere edge.
---
The difference is constant.
---
Try 14*2 instead
---
Watching Venruki layer his way to the gurabashi arena chest was interesting I wonder what other people will find in the future
---
leeway interaction? what?
---
Phew I had a nightsaber with my human mage but I didn't remember it taking that long!!
---
AQ40 set is a full balance set for druid. It's doesn't make the spec amazing but if you want to play balance pvp that's what you're aiming for. Without that you really rely on pvp pieces that are poorly statted for balance.
---
No. Being able to quickly establish what gear someone is wearing is important in Vanilla/Classic. I hate transmog and I hate how it drove up prices of things because of how it looked. 
---
No changes.
---
I played a lot of Druid and people always asked me to come resto to raids cause there weren’t enough Druid’s. Also hybrid Druid in PvP that heals, dispells curses and poisons, moon fire, insect swarm, and fraire fires people is extremely useful. And then if you get attacked you can always be a tanky bear, and you can sneak with cat form. I think Druid’s are fantastic supports but full feral definitely struggles. 
---
For the most part though healers are welcomed more so than dps, even if you don’t have the best gear people will ask you to come along and heal
---
You need a sub to access the stress test.
---
That...Kinda sucks.  I'm not gonna have enough vacation time to take the rest of the week off.  I wasn't going to anyhow, but I was gonna feel less bad about taking Wed-Fri off unpaid.
---
/dance
---
So is it letting everyone in right now? I don't quite understand
---
Zug Zug
---
So it's from the edge of your player sphere to the edge of your opponents player sphere?
---
https://youtu.be/aJX4ytfqw6k
---
Yup, if you are dogshit, cant use totems, and are fighting t3/R14 players with blues you are going to get stomped every time.
---
Gnome warrior would have to be on a different server if you’re going orc hunter, just a reminder :)
---
Does it not work on PvE servers?
---
But in the early days?
---
Your better off waiting a bit anyway.
---
I thought you could have alliance and horde characters on a PvE server
---
I doubt you actually need someone to explain the nuances between the common cold and a permanent mental disorder.
---
Dude this is exactly what I want to do take my friggin time fishing cooking and making friends
---
This is only for the stress test, a lot of people have access to it. Classic does not release until August. The stress test is available for a few days.
---
Hi Kmaho, check out our guild. Here's our 'About Us' and a link to our discord. Feel free to message me there or on Reddit if you're interested in more details.
---
*&lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again.  Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing different expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW.*
---
PM'd you.
---
Yeah but we're talking about a 15 year WoW nerd, I need to play right away, its worse than heroin at this point.
---
It really depends on your class. Priests are the most powerful healers, but pallys druids and shamans bring more utility.
---
The biggest difference you will probably notice is spell ranks. Lower ranks have better efficiency. ie you generally heal more per mana spent with lower rank heals. If you spam max rank heals you will be OOM before the boss is a 95%. Raid/group damage in vanilla and TBC was much lower than in the expansions after this, but you can't heal anywhere near as hard. A pro healer in vanilla/TBC knows how efficient their different ranks are and how much each rank heals. They also know who takes how much damage when. You need to know can I use a slow lower rank heal, very mana efficient, Without anyone dying or do it need to use a fast high-rank heal, very mana inefficient, to keep them alive. Do so lets you use just the right amount of healing to not let people die without overhealing and wasting your mana.
---
You're perfectly entitled to your opinion but ...
---
&gt; I really, really hope they'll add mythic+ difficulty to classic dungeons.
---
Mythic+ was almost as bad a change as the LFG tool for sucking all the joy out of dungeons. Because the Go Go Go attitude takes away what makes Vanilla/Classic dungeons great - the cooperation and coordination. All that leaves you is the lootz. 
---
Furthermore, Mythic+ has the very unfortunate side effect of splitting the playerbase. You're either pushing Mythic+ or you are not doing dungeons other than one run-through for quests. Currently people are pushing Mythic 10 keys. If by now your gear is not at or close to that level you have essentially no chance of progressing up the chain.
---
I laughed
---
Here's a video on the most popular and well known/respected druid tanks in vanilla that should answer your questions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyWQlXtkuJ0
---
TL;DW Bear tanks are stupid good and underrated. Community opinion is largely uninformed, understandably since people just started figuring out how good bears are recently in private servers.
---
With the way I was doing the calculations, it's from the center of your character model to the opponent's player sphere. For all of my calculations, the player sphere is only calculated and applied to 1 character. The other character is assumed to use the center point of their model.
---
Tired of seeing this stupid question. Use your brain.
---
I just made the same thing asyou did... judging by a few sentences...
---
I don‘t think we‘ll get along with each other, and this conversation just gets more degenerated with each post. So if you want to further discuss this topic, you can answer again. (Excluding insults would be nice)
---
If not, have a nice release experience and goodbye!
---
Handicapped.
---
Well yeah, they pretty much suck for questing compared to Feral, but the context of the post is raiding.
---
&gt; It wasn't not part of Classic until right before TBC.
---
Oh so you mean it **was** a part of Vanilla?  Great, glad we cleared that up.  I had half a dozen sixties before BC hit.  Go fuck yourself.
---
Very true.
---
Slap it on RP PvE realms only then.
---
It's literally the only change I could get behind, but as a PvPer I see where you are coming from.
---
They introduced group finder, and it was well received when it came out. I really liked it. Nobody knew what it would become in the later expansions. I think at the time, the basic function of it, it was a pretty cool idea. As expansions went on, they kept adding on to it and making it worse and worse.
---
I would say just because it was introduced does not mean that was what brought down the quality or likability of the game. I think Wrath is one of the best Warcraft games. TBC and Wrath are for sure better than Classic. It wasn't until after the expansion where they made the function that much worse.
---
Den we kill da whole race
---
Got a link to your video? I'd like to watch you show us all how it's done on your private server where everone is T3/R14.
---
Well that was cringy
---
Thank you so much, I am at the movies but I will read this all soon. I really appreciate this.
---
I completely agree that there needs to be one, but historically way more people play on rp servers than rppvp ones.  Just sayin.
---
I think this works except for Revenge of the Sith (which was very good IMO, the 3rd best Star Wars movie) being compared to WoD.
---
So what you are saying is that its not as easy and therefor should be fixed? Lol.... I feel pretty damn certain this was always in the game and people are just so used to private servers that they are getting their panties in a wad
---
Quite frankly I'd pay $20 a month if it kept whiners like you out.
---
Omg does anyone remember the crazy theory that she was saying some satantic things or it was some hidden message.
---
it was good during then cos it was brand new experience for all of us and we were blown. but now it may be like watching a movie 2nd time so the novelty can wear off to certain extent depending on person to person.
---
I’m not advocating for mythic + in vanilla at all, but I completely disagree with your assessment here. I actually love mythic + in retail.
---
1. Mythic plus keeps dungeons relevant far longer than they were in classic, and it provides gear alternatives to raising and pvp. At some point in classic dungeons will never be of much benefit to your character and you will have no need to run them again.
---
2. Mythic + requires an extreme amount of coordination and cooperation to deal with affixes, cooldowns, CC, timers and pulls, much more so than classic dungeons.
---
3. There are always people doing lower keys that provide opportunities to gear up for higher keys.
---
Once again, I’m not saying add them to classic, but they are one of the more positive things blizzard has done in later expansions.
---
Only fix I found was editing my config.
---
Lol, dem stairs. That used to be my favorite part of my gavorite dungeon back in the day
---
On the other hand, +hit was less useful, or even useless against lower-level mobs. The [XP bonus](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP) for higher-level mobs was not sufficient to convince anyone (except maybe a hunter) to fight them regularly.
---
I'm unsure about [this claim](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Magical_resistance):
---
&gt;Level-based resistance (not to be confused with level-based miss) can  play a factor in total resists. For every level that a mob has over the  player, there is 8 resist (believed; the exact number may be higher)  added. . . . However, **this resistance has been shown to not apply to binary spells at all**.
---
If you wanted reputation with different cities, or just a more interesting leveling experience, you hopped around between as many zones as possible to finish quests before they went gray. (Not sure when quests were changed to give reputation when gray.) If an optimized leveling guide didn't suggest this, it may not have been the most efficient, but it's more fun.
---
And as a mage, you might have more mobility to quickly travel other places to do quests there; the reagent isn't that expensive.
---
\+6% hit would rarely be the difference in being able to complete a quest; it would just make it faster. A +4 mob resists 28% of your spells before the level-based resistance comes into play; +6% hit just brings that down to 22%. If it would take you 40 seconds to kill the mob without the talent, it takes 37 seconds with the talent. The +6% from Elemental Resist would not, for example, make it easier to polymorph a +4 add while doing that +4 quest since that's arcane school.
---
R u mad? Or just big mad?
---
Inb4 people defend this with "It's just beta!" Even though this will 95% likely be in at launch just by the nature of how layering works. "
---
You are being purposefully obtuse. Change it to cola + dishwasher fluid or whatever you like,it doesn't change my argument, you get two items for one cost. Separately they'll still cost you a double.
---
you're a really good dude and I appreciate this
---
We could have died! He was trying to interfere with glory
---
Historically yes, because RPPVP servers didn't exist at launch. Every survey I've seen shows that about 2-3 times as many players are interested in RPPVP.
---
If you think that then there is nothing I can do to dissuade you otherwise.  I've demonstrated how twitch is niche and how more people likely know what South Park is than know what twitch is.  South parks audience is much older than that of twitch's.  There is very little intersection. I can't really say anymore.
---
/thread
---
I resubbed because I’m excited to play classic again, but I’m not going to be doing any stress testing. I’m leveling a mage, just having fun until classic comes out. But I’m not going to waste time on a character with a life span of two days.
---
Yeah quoting starship troopers. Woosh
---
I strongly believe current wow is simply a bad game. If you have been playing for over 10 years you may not think so because you know it. Think of it from a brand new players perspective. It's a fucking nightmare.
---
If memory serves me right, your rank may decrease over time but your earned rank title does not.
---
Furreal dawg. I see posts about this all the time but no one knows. For me I’d either like them to restart and just wipe the game when cata came out or put out WoW 2. All I know is I was more triggered than ever when 10 man raids and 25 man raids shared the same drops. Venting here but fuck retail. As long as classic doesn’t become that I’m happy.
---
Did you get any caps when the line was longer? I was in it. It was funny
---
Here, let’s use some simple math.
---
If classic was its own sub at $8 a month.....
---
Say right now retail has 100 people subbed.
---
When classic comes out, 30 people switch to classic and 50 unsubbed people join.
---
That’s 70 people on retail at $15 = $1050month and 80 people at $8= $640month. Total $1690month
---
If classic and retail are combined....
---
That’s 100 retail subs + 50 unsubbed people, 150 subbed total.
---
150 at $15=$2250month.
---
Blizz will make more money combining the subs, and if they didn’t make any money they wouldn’t make classic. So shut up and pay your $15 and stop complaining, we finally get the game we want.
---
You'll still make money early on but not as much as when the server average is lv 60ish.
---
You’re literally choosing not to read words, what I’m saying is that even if you had classic it would still cost 15 per month, the number of servers and staff for classic is is just way too expensive, to accommodate people who think it’s would be too expensive to have both classic and retail, they made it free for retail people.
---
How about I pay $15/month for classic WoW and then Good Guy Blizzard throws in the option to play retail for free. So even if I don’t want to I still have the option and I don’t pay extra.  That sounds pretty good lol
---
so its ok to state inaccuracies and not get called out ok
---
maybe he has a real job and makes videos as a hobby like a respectable human being
---
I don't understand why they cant just layer the zones up to level 20 or something
---
Yes to an extent. In a 40 man, there were typically 5 warriors. Normally 2-3 of them were actually DPS spec. That being said There are some Raid fights where you will be expected to tank. Sulfuron and Majordomo both MUST have 5 tanks and Garr needs 5 or a shit ton of warlocks, 6 for 4 tanks 7 for 3, etc. Other than thoughts 3 bosses you can be dps for everything in MC. Same goes for the other raids. There will be a boss or 2 where you will need to tank. Vael for example but otherwise you will actually be expected to dps
---
Also for 5 mans, you MUST explicitly tell people you are dps. It will be assumed you are willing to tank unless you tell them otherwise.
---
You can
---
Someone should pass on that message to blizzard Re: unarmoured epic mounts and how we can't have them because we'd level too quickly.
---
All they need to do is remove it :)
---
The entire thread you are posting in is about a streamer literally testing the exact method you describe(forcing a new layer assignment when reopening the game and logging in)? How fucking stupid are you that you're like 20 comments deep and still haven't figured that out?
---
This worked thanks!
---
This is a short-term "stress test" which is intended to get tons of people into the starting areas.
---
You'll only be able to level up to level 15, and the stress test is only 48 hours total.  And of course the characters get deleted afterward.
---
Some people are in the full Beta which goes up to level 40, but this is something entirely different.
---
&gt; Attempting to balance all classes and all specs so everyone was 100% equal? Sucked. 
---
What's the point of playing a class like Paladin that has options to DPS, Heal and Tank if you can only do one of the three exceptionally well. In Vanilla, they had a protection tree with protection abilities to tank, but tanking was not viable. Shamans, Priests and Druids did not typically DPS (or tank for Druid) in raids or dungeons typically because they were more fit to be healers. So why do they have trees that offer the abilities to do these things if they never get to utilize them in the end game?
---
&gt; Condensing the world into a tiny new continent? Sucked. 
---
What did you want them to do, make an expansion, release no new zones to the game and just make new content on Kalimdor / Azeroth? The story was based around the Outlands which was a whole new world through the Dark Portal, of course they had to make a whole new continent.
---
&gt; Flying? Sucked. 
---
Flying did not suck. I think when people look at it in hindsight and how they allowed flying in almost every expansion and added flying to everything, that is what sucked. But flying in TBC was actually pretty decent when limited only to Outlands. World PvP around that time did not die, it died later on in other expansions. I wouldn't say flying sucked because they introduced a mechanic they would add to other expansions and it ruined the game even further. Nobody knew what it would become in later expansions.
---
&gt; Balancing classes around arena performance mostly? Sucked. 
---
Balancing classes around arena performance, specifically PvP, is how every game makes updates to classes. They focus more on PvP balancing than they do PvE balancing, since PvE is just mostly mechanics you need to master to kill a boss, where PvP is an ability one player or class uses against all other players and classes can be extremely powerful and needs to be tuned down.
---
Don't know what you're talking about exactly, but this was one of, if not, the best WoW we've seen.
---
Blood and Thunder!

Just eat cup of noodles for a week. If your already doing that just dont eat.

Self proclaimed boyfriend of the girlfriend that won the speed leveling contest. Congratulations on getting a girlfriend that plays wow more then anything.
---
I think it is worthwhile to discuss possible content Post-Naxx which diverts from the TBC route. I think any content which might be added to Classic WoW should exist to give players more gameplay options, not erase ones that already exist in Classic. Several years ago, Runescape relaunched the Classic version of the game. It was very popular at launch, but eventually the content dried up and so did the population. The developers were able to successfully add new content which enabled the population to grow higher than at launch. I believe the same thing can happen with Classic WoW, as long as Blizzard keeps the spirit of Classic WoW aglow. Below is an outline for expanding Classic WoW using horizontal progression.
---
**Horizontal Progression through Set Bonuses**
---
If there was new content added to Classic WoW, it could be in the form of new set bonuses. They could be an incentive to complete new dungeon/raid content. Players would have the option to look and play differently through new tier sets.
---
If there were new dungeons and T1, T2, T3 raids that dropped gear with new set bonuses, would that allow for enough customization? If there was a new Tier 2 raid similar to Blackwing Lair, it could drop new set bonuses that changed the way certain talents worked. ex. T2 mage set Spellweave Regalia (5) Set Bonus 5%chance Pyroblast hits multiple targets. Tier 2 rogue set with a 5 piece set bonus that gives bonus % to a talent. Like 20% increased Master of Deception talent so you have better stealth. Gear set bonuses could we a way for players to enhance their talents and create new talent specs. Imagine if ret paladins could boost the effectiveness of the Retribution tree through raid gear set bonuses. If you change the talent trees, you risk homogenizing the classes and the issues with the vertical raid progression is that if attribute increases are all that matter, then higher tier drop gear is clearly better.
---
Naxxramas gear should remain top end. Adding new raids that increase the tier level beyond 3 creates problematic power creep. The solution is perhaps to add special set bonuses to gear from new raids, as well as bonuses that aren't just attribute differences. You have to create itemization that makes doing all the raid content worth it, but at the same time doesn't invalidate the other raids. What if the itemization is good enough that real character customization exists from collecting different raid tiers? New on-use trinkets, ring set bonuses, etc.. as well
---
TLDR:
---
The idea is that you would be able to make new specs by collecting the new raid gear set bonuses. The set bonuses would change the way your talents work, so you could build your character in many new ways.
---
For example. a new T2 mage raid set called Hypnotic Regalia.
---
3 piece set bonus: increases duration of polymorph by 10%.
---
5 piece set bonus: Improved counterspell disarms the target
---
8 piece set bonus: Arcane Power spells now do splash damage in a 50 yard radius.
---
**New Quests, Collectables, and Leveling Zones**
---
Improving the leveling, questing, and farming experience in Classic WoW is something that new content patches could focus on. Have new questlines and storymodes for leveling zones and add new zones to old world. Fill im gaps on the map. For every raid patch, there could be a patch that enhances other aspects of the game. Never underestimate how popular cosmetic/collectables are. There should be new mounts, recipes, etc.. that you can farm in new through faction rep/raids/dungeons/questlines. Have long quest chains, riddles, and puzzles that players can investigate.
---
**Player Housing**
---
This isn't a priority really, but Blizzard originally intended to make player housing. I think having players or guild housing in certain parts of the world could work.
---
**World PvP System**
---
Instead of adding Arena to Classic WoW, add a new system where players can viably rank up through World PvP. A huge flaw with Classic WoW is how battlegrounds become the main focus of PvP. You can't really rank up doing World PvP once battlegrounds are released. They need to either create a separate honor system where you only rank up doing world PvP with a leaderboard or increase the honor gains from World PvP in the current honor system. Add more objectives and resources to collect. Add unique chests and rewards hidden across zones so players leave the capital cities to find them. Have PvP campaigns/scenarios in world zones that last a certain amount of time.
---
**Event System**
---
There was a Hero's Call Board in Cataclysm. There could be something similar in Classic where players could create and signup for serverwide events. Player-run PvP/PvE events such as speed runs, ironman runs, dueling tournaments, Roleplaying games etc..
---
**New Classic Races**
---
There will always be a demand from some players for more races/classes etc.. The classes Blizzard introduced in the expansions don't belong in Classic WoW. From a gameplay and lore perspective. However, Worgen and Goblin were prominent in Classic WoW, and adding these two races and their zones would fit in perfectly.
---
**Boats**
---
Having a new tradeskill profession that allowed players to build. Being able to sail from Booty Bay to the Lost Isles across the ocean could add for a lot of immerson. Being able to fish, pvp, treasure hunt, and just hang out on the open seas might be fun.
---
Yeah, I think I'll go warrior, and if I have withdrawals from rogue, I'll just make an alt or something and play on the side to get my fix.
---
Thanks for the help!

And we both are massive WoW nerds.
---
&gt;How about you make the ads classy, plain and non-intrusive? And ideally not overloaded with malware. From chosen partners that sell products that are not a total scam.
---
No? Then fuck you.
---
Exactly
---
You want to think about speed mostly. You dont want one character out pacing the other character when running to the next quest. Priest/Warrior should be a fine combo.
---
Thanks.
---
God I hate what this subreddit has become.
---
I have those too.  I clicked one video about League's new auto chess TFT with Kripp playing the alpha.
---
Got bored partway through, I was just there because it was league related.
---
Now every damn ad on my phone is autochess.  Gonna have to switch to firefox for the adblocker I guess.  I never cared about a few adds on my phone, block them all on desktop uBlocker.
---
The problem is, all those people clog up the starting zone, LOL. Can we have an open stress test and anyone that doesnt make it to level level 15 in under 10 hours has to start one day late?
---
I am kidding of course but still :)
---
They will evolve, or they will leave. There are many games for them.
---
This one is ours.
---
&gt; getting mindlessly stoned and killing trolls all night in The Hinterlands
---
weed + grinding is a great combo. WoW is so fucking immersive while stoned
---
This takes me back.  Got to max level back in the day and enjoyed healing raids but eventually saw Unbreakable's video and decided to farm AV for the TUF.  Played a bunch (got R12 before I decided it was too much grind) and vividly remember standing around waiting for procs.  The big blasts made it all worth it and 2-hitting clothies was always fun, but if you ran into anyone with a shield/evasion you were going to have a bad time if you wanted to pretend to be Unbreakable.  That said 0/20/31 absolutely dumped on rogues when swapping to shield.  Pretty much no one could roll up and 1v1 an enh shaman consistently, though I'd say hunters were probably the most dangerous if played well.

---
Give-me-access! I'm heavy enough to stress test it. :'D
---
can we just have a stress test with zero layers to see how players handle being in a clustered zone trying to quest. rather then assuming everyones going to hate it (i personally would enjoy it)
---
Too many variables my friend. I would say you will be 100+ ping constantly. Probably like 120ish.
---
I mean it depends where you live in N.A. If you live on the west Coast you'll probably have some input lag. If you play on the east coast and you connect to a UK server you'll probably be fine. Also depends on how good your internet access is.
---
The main complaint of the person above you is that the time factor forces everything to be rushed.
---
How about Mythic+ that has no time element (besides possibly boss enrage timers), but just gets to be insanely hard even when taking your time?
---
Seems like a solid compromise that harkens back to the days of Magister's Terrace  \^_^
---
It comes from a subset of the communities way of playing the game being more visible to other players.
---
Guess I'm naming mine Martha.
---
&gt; Because of this, I hope that players are much more receptive to the idea of classic WoW not remaining 'pure' and instead progressing into a 'best of' WoW sort of situation.
---
On new servers that are completely independent of "Classic Vanilla", hell yes.  But it would be silly to start forcing changes back onto the original game, when half the point of this was to preserve it as it was as best as they can (the same way you can play classic games like Super Mario Bros or Zelda or whatever at any time).
---
But at 3:50 in the video you used the player sphere around the attacker, not the opponent.
---
Anyway, since the Tauren melee range from boundary is 1.4 instead of 2.0 like for a human, would this not mean that a human can hit a Tauren from 0.6 yards further than the Tauren can hit the human in melee?, considering the player sphere calculation (at 5:15) is symmetrical for both opponents. Something seems off about this...
---
Oh boy this thread.
---
Did you not play the stress test yet? Even with layering the areas are plenty crowded.
---
Yes he was half wrong and you were half right.
---
It would be 8/26/2019
---
Idk what those '.' are for.
---
Well if I dig deep in to my mind I guess that's possible but I do believe that the sole intent was to shit on Disturbed as a band.
---
'The war is reborn'.. maybe means something different than what you thinnk. :D
---
Cauthon? Jesus christ. What a beast
---
While i agree that modern gamers have it easy, lets hope those of us who played back in the day dont become a bunch of rude, arrogant elitists, that would sooner talk down to the modern herd rather than offer help and encouragement.
---
Must not have been playing games for the past couple years. Modern gaming baby - 1-3 months then jump on the next train.
---
Don't forget to talk to the non quest giving NPC's bro lol
---
You can reserve your name a couple of weeks ahead of actual release date. But shhh
---
Same here. It was a terrible idea; leveling anything else after that felt like eternal torment
---
Layering is blizzards cheap solution.
---
Ahh thought you were going pvp server, my bad!
---
Shamans make for one of the best highlight videos. The double procs with crits instakills anyone.
---
Basically a priest and rogue or warrior. You want 0 downtime which you get as a priest so you want another class that doesn't use mana to dps. You can heal a paladin to infinity but they still rely on mana heavily to dps.
---
Y'all really discussing youtube video lengths on a post about running from durotar to mulgore?
---
Min-maxers should not be asking for any changes at all, imo. 
---
That goes against the purpose of min-maxing within the environment you are given. If you try to alter the game then you might as well just write yourself into the best stats automagically.
---
So I agree with you there.
---
I’m talking about throughout the whole history of wow census players have proven to prefer just rp servers
---
Hmm okay thnx
---
Me and my wife are going druid shaman duo probably won't get level 40 mounts right away
---
Some of them are. Feral druid dps is very involved with power shifting and using many abilities and also keeping an eye on your pummeler timer. 
---
Ret dps on the other hand is pretty much just auto-attacking.
---
Yo that’s dope. I want to help people as much as possible this time around. Even my friends that didn’t experience vanilla before, I’m excited for them and want to foster the epic journey and sense of community this game has the potential to bring back. Thanks dude.
---
Good news is when phase one goes so will layering, so problem solved I guessss?
---
&gt; but raids aren't going to fail to clear content because they have one or two of these specs around.
---
If you are the raid leaders girlfriend or a long time contributing member, you might be able to get away with the guild carrying your ret paladin. However, if you are just some random guy applying to a guild with 25 legit DPS, they aren't going to accept you.
---
As a result, the raids that do accept ret paladins are going to be loaded with them.
---
What's a newb friendly class for Horde? I'm trying to recruit a friend to join me in Classic whose only MMORPG experience is leveling a druid to 25 in retail. I'll be playing a Warlock and another friend will be Priest. Maybe Hunter so we can easily solo mobs when I'm not there to help?
---
Why are there so many paladins? I was hoping to go holy and be one of the few... I guess that won’t be the case.
---
I love to call out on comms when an opposing faction target me. Saying "he's got a gun, he made a move, put him down!"
---
I'm going to essientially twink up my Hunter while leveling him. BOE blues, dungeon gear, enchants, engineering. Then go out into the world and pwn the fuck out of alliance all the way to 60.
---
The ones i can think of are  
---
[Truefaith vestments ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14154/truefaith-vestments)for Priest  
---
[Robe of the Archmage ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14152/robe-of-the-archmage) for mage  
---
Both of these are pre raid BIS from memory.
---
Just run skin leather sell all mats and have your wife run tailer and make 10 slot bags with wool. Simple money maker in any new server
---
WOD WAS FUCKING GARBAGE.
---
That's better than I had in actual vanilla on an East coast server from Illinois (only 1 hr behind). Doesn't seem too bad for being so much farther.
---
No worries mate. I know most people roll pvp servers but I’ve played private servers and PvP back in the day and I’m ready for a gank free pve environment so I can enjoy the open world in peace and do battlegrounds when people actually wanna fight
---
TAKE HIM DOWN. POM PYRO
---
why do people keep asking this? obviously you wouldn’t keep the characters...
---
I just meant warriors not wanting to tank lowbie dungeons, as I've encountered quite a few times. But what you said I agree with.
---
Let everyone test then? Blizzards greed knows no bounds.
---
Thanks a lot, yea I saw some mountainwalk the other day with wetlands GY ress.
---
The sphere can be considered around the attacker or opponent. It does not matter.
---
The only thing that matters is the race/genders of the two players.
---
If neither player is a tauren, the melee range from boundary is 2 yards, BUT the player sphere is only 3 yards in radius.
---
If one player is a tauren, the melee range from boundary is 1.4 yards and that equation will need to be used in the video for calculating the player sphere. (It will always be much bigger than the non-tauren-vs-non-tauren player sphere)
---
&gt;Edit1: Classic should be a single sub cheaper than retail.
---
If you knew I'd pay $10 for burgers why would you charge me $8?
---
Bs its All abot wand damage
---
More than that in classic. It was changed in TBC specifically to break more frequently on high damage events like crits.
---
You could easily get two Frostbolt crits from a Frostbite proc, possibly followed by a Fire Blast crit. Even if the first frostbolt following a proc didn't crit, the second one could, which would basically be 15% crit chance from the proc.
---
The expected benefit is reduced because procs at or just before death don't count, but it could also proc from Ice/Frost Armor, for both dps and survival increases.
---
Then there was that time that a bunch of frost mages killed Ragnaros, because he wasn't immune to Frostbite.
---
It probably does make AoE farming harder; I tried doing what was shown in a video of farming SM Cath at lvl 60, where the author says not to have Frostbite. I couldn't do it with Frostbite but not sure if I could have done it without it either. In [Frost Mage: Solo 30+ mobs in one pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unusjpGt8bY), I'm not convinced that Frostbite would have ruined this, and in general I doubt there are any situations where any problems caused by having Frostbite can't be solved simply by having another player to help you, whether they're a tank or a healer or another class with AoE.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOCzmSPbf2E
---
I hope Swifty gets to see this so he can appreciate the callbacks/tribute.
---
Also DEing the greens you do get reduces what you would make from just vendoring them.
---
Way too much armor dropping off of mobs. I had a full gray set at level 5.
---
You should be able to heal dungeons just fine in a shadow spec if you think about what you are doing ahead of time and play correctly.
---
Level squish might do that
---
All of the stress tests have been during business hours pretty much. Its stupid. You want to really stress test? Do that shit at 8PM EST in the U.S. on a Saturday. Should be a truck load of people available then.
---
I don't see the issue with world buffs. If you want to spend 30-45 mins before a raid getting your buffs ready, by all means go for it. As a tryhard rogue that's what ill be doing.
---
Just make it so you can only swap layers in rested zones (cities/inns)
---
Ohh yeah Korn was a huge one for me too. Whenever my friends and I reminisce about classic I always think of my orc warlock treading through barrens ready to wipe out a dwarf mine while giving myself permanent ear damage listening to Toxicity lol
---
Depends on where you are, this is assuming East Coast to the western most EU server node.
---
Rogue and shaman have a lot too but yeah mage has less , other than abilities like conjuring food and creating portals.
---
Shits pretty dope, and they're fun to play imo
---
Sponsors.
---
Guess that’s true.... idk shadow seems fun but I don’t want to be in a situation where people just want me healing all the time.
---
If you don't play classic while on fire, you're clearly doing it wrong.
---
I dont think they should be removed either. Did you read the post?
---
I guess that’s true, but idk I don’t wanna be stuck in a situation where people just want me healing all the time
---
You clever bastard. Have a silver.
---
Interested in the series of thoughts that led you to post this question. Or even have this thought in your head.
---
I'm on the east coast in NC. I have pretty good internet with fiber
---
Conparing Cata to Phantom Menace? Wut
---
This is definitely a post I'd see in 2004.
---
The upside to being gear dependant:
---
You can twink a warrior and he'll level up decently fast. I plan to play a warlock first to grind gold, then use the gold to twink my warrior. It's so much easier when he's always geared with up to date greens.
---
Ten years ago on retail I spent a few months leading a mid-range raiding guild on the Thrall server that I somehow managed to claim control of after initiating a coup against the founder when he tried rewriting our DKP system for his own benefit.  That guild lost me my job AND a wife.  And I'd do it all again.  
---
Long live The Aggro League.
---
I’m just being a smartass :)
---
So cute when kids learn new phrases
---
Never understood this one.
---
Well it was 2pm PST so anyone that's not on the east coast was working and even they were just barely getting out of work. I got on 15min late and managed to play 45min before I had to leave because my guild raids 7pm EST (4 PST) and had to do some IRL stuff beforehand. Also, that's not counting the fact that it's a Wednesday so some people will have raid when they finally do get off work. 
---
Awful time to do the test.
---
Thanks!
---
I never said that you said that they should've removed. Did you read my post?
---
Yup, everyone who disagrees with you just a liar. That's the ticket. This subreddit is quality, that's for sure.
---
Cool thanks
---
Priest absorb takes away from rage gen.
---
Could just avoid using it though when possible save for emergencies
---
I watched it all.
---
Was waiting for your parents to bust in and correct thier mistake.
---
&gt; It's like saying FF8
---
this is your brain on retail wow
---
Do you realize how much coordination this takes? The only reason it works like it did is because he has his twitch chat all on the same page. Your going to have to set up a network of people not in your group or guild ( guild will be on same layer) to make split second invites. all for fucking what? To avoid a 30 second gank...maybe? To get one extra lotus..... maybe? Assuming no one is in the layer you switch to? In addition, there's literally no one in beta so the layer he goes to is empty. You all are honestly just looking for reasons to piss blood. If you don't like it, don't play. Then everyone who isnt 12 years old will enjoy the game. Who knows maybe if enough of you whinging children don't play, we won't even have more than one layer. Grow. The. fuck. Up.
---
lol my bad
---
Proud to not know as apparently these didn’t exist in Vanilla.
---
You are assuming a great deal and spreading a lot of misinformation in the process.
---
I hope you are happy though.
---
https://youtu.be/NgLbGsUS-ls
---
This wasn’t a setting in vanilla it was just how the game worked...
---
Recently Blizzard hasn't exactly had the best track record with WoW when it comes to solving problems brought up by the players. And this is a fundamental problem with the system as a whole. If they try to fix it while keeping it in it'll limit the game too much. Id prefer it to be limited to the 1-10 zones if possible. Anything after level 20 and you start getting widespread abuses that have carry on effects for the server.
---
Most guilds will have 1-3 Druids in a raid group, with more competitive guilds having less. Guilds doing speed runs may not use any at all other than buffing their raid outside. Priests will be more popular, but they’ll also be in higher demand.
---
Are you 2 14 year old kids sharing account?!
---
Assuming you live in Charlotte, your average ping will be:
---
* 19ms to realms hosted in Boston
---
* 29ms to realms hosted in Chicago
---
* 55ms to realms hosted in LA
---
* 77ms to realms hosted in Seattle
---
* 93ms to realms hosted in Paris
---
* 104ms to realms hosted in Frankfurt
---
So it shouldn't be a problem there.
---
But unless your life schedule permits you to play mostly between 11AM and 6PM, I wouldn't do it.
---
Thank you!
---
hmm thats funny because without layering there would still be high/low pop servers, imagine if all those people who complained they cant get herbs or keep getting ganked just played on idk, a lower pop server? Instead of fucking the game up for everybody with their entitlement.
---
Thanks, didn‘t know that but makes sense!
---
Travel time
---
If your group is that good, then you could 30 man it with good builds and start selling raid spots.
---
Or just clear easy raids quickly, which will become valuable once we enter phase 3 and people are running 3-4 raids a week.
---
Premeditate is bad?!
---
No, it's just they either are or aren't a mage.
---
This is either bait or you are just dumb lol
---
It doesn't have to happen 100% of the time for it to be a problem. Even if it only 50% of the time it can still be majorly abused.
---
And it's really working out great for you!
---
/s
---
Where can I get one? That’s my birthday
---
Respect for doing what you gotta do
---
It's not a standalone game. It's part of your World of Warcraft subscription.
---
Go shaman! 30/0/21 build for big lightning crits and you can heal too.
---
What program did you use for this? Been trying to find a program that lets me use different colour outlines around text, just as you have done with the numbers.
---
MMmno. Healers clever enough to try to out-sustain the SL warlock were harder than rogues. Notably druids, since insta-cast HoTs could keep them healing while feared. They had to know to put a stop to drain life, but if they did, the lock will eventually have to put himself in the red with lifetap. 
---
A good frost/arcane mage was much worse than a rogue, as they encouraged using the Felhunter, which sacrificed a LOT of utility/dps/surviveability for resists and a counterspell. Getting locked out of the shadow tree at the wrong moment was devastating, and kiting isn't really an option.
---
A shaman who was well comfortable with his whole kit was probably the hardest of the bunch, though. Frost shock, grounding totem, frost shock, intermittent heals, frost shock, windfury, frost shock...
---
Rogue isn't even top 3 for a (halfway decent) SL warlock. Intense damage mitigation (SL), capacity to interact while stunned (DoTs, pets), and powerful sustain whilst free to act (Drain life, healthstone) are pretty much all decisive, direct counters to any rogue, almost regardless of skill.
---
That was my main concern, I work the typical 9-5. Is there any PvP benefit to having higher ping?
---
Lol politically correct. Sometimes I'm glad I scroll through the middle Haha.
---
Okay then explain why else layering would be used buddy i'm very interested to hear what other purpose layering could possibly server
---
&gt;complaining mob locations and quest turn ins aren't marked
---
you are making this up
---
The video we all just watched, was this guy fighting people in t3/r14. Its right fucking there. He doesn't drop a single totem and is wearing shit gear in comparison. If you are a shit player, with shit gear, against good players with awesome gear, and to add on top of it all you are out numbered, you are going to get stomped, even in a good spec/class. This is basically the opposite of the pvp highlight videos. No one is saying that enhancement is the best spec, but if you put the work in for the gear and know your class well you can pvp just fine and have a great time. Any one who plays a sub optimal spec knows that it takes work to do just okay, but it can be super fucking fun too, which is the whole damn point of the game. People need to be realistic, sure enhance can suck real hard. Its not like retail. You are gonna need to heal a lot of raids to get the gear to make it good. But it can be done and it can be fun. We shouldn't tell people that it is impossible when it isn't. Hard sure, dick head elitists talking shit constantly because they think there is only one way to play the game, yup. Do able and fun, yup. Its a good litmus test to find a group that isn't toxic tbh.
---
I re-subbed just to try the stress test (yeah I'm a loser) and I was surprised at how well it runs.  60 FPS with my Mac Mini's cruddy Intel GPU with shadows/water on fair.  I kept seeing the system requirements would be the same as retail, but seems like people will able to run this on almost any computer.
---
Hunter is super mindless and easy for leveling and very self-reliant but the skill ceiling is incredibly high.  For max-level group content hunters are going to be expected to trap and kite, sometimes both at the same time.  Obviously not every hunter back in the day was able to do this but those guys *always* got groups because it was so powerful.  Additionally, the pet skill collection and management part of the class is a lot to handle and I think I lot of people overlook how big of a deal it is *especially since most people recommend leveling BM*.
---
Warlock would be my vote, but mage it's pretty great too.  Super simple rotations, make your own resources, control for days, sheep, no pet to manage (and pull extra mobs with).  The very early part of mage leveling can be pretty brutal with a lot of downtime but if you guys are playing together that'll really help.  Then your friend will be AoE farming and basically hand-holding your group to big xp.
---
Rogue and Warrior would work too, depending on how much you guys are planning to play solo/together.  Warrior obviously benefits from group play more and rogue is a bit more solo capable and self-reliant.  Both are straightforward where you don't have to worry about mana or the 5 second rule, and you don't need to worry about maintaining separation.  Just get close and beat stuff up, and neither is all that complex from a skill floor or ceiling perspective.
---
Yes, you are totally right! You should totally rebel and opt out of classic all together! That'll show 'em! Actually, if you really wanna hit them where it hurts, just stay off the internet all together!
---
That would also be a win for the rest of us.
---
Yup. Do as little of the expansion as you can.
---
Don't forget that Blink costs 35% of base mana in classic, which if [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Base\_mana#World\_of\_Warcraft](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Base_mana#World_of_Warcraft) is accurate is 424 mana, or about 10% of a mage's total mana pool, which takes about 5 seconds of drinking water to restore.

The key device is more secure than the phone app. You could get malware on your phone. Someone can socially engineer the phone company to add a new phone onto your same number. If you had malware once before, they likely know your email address and other personal info.
---
I'm not saying it's likely. But there are definitely cases out there where phone authenticators have been beaten.
---
&gt; They were in WC3.
---
So were Murlocs, maybe they should be a playable race? Seems like something blizzard would do in the XPAC after BFA.
---
&gt;They had some backstory.
---
So did Murlocs.
---
&gt;It really isn't a stretch to think that between WC3 and [last expansion you enjoyed] that they were working on more lore and stuff for them.
---
Nah, Blizzard was running out of stuff to keep their players interested. Cause we all know after CATA WOW was floundering and losing subs hard. Had to come up with a new race and a new class to keep people hooked.
---
So they introduced Kung-Fu Panda and split the player base pretty strongly on whether or not you loved or hated the Pandas.
---
&gt;I feel the same way about Pandaren as I do about every other non Vanilla playable race. I'm totally okay with them existing, but they should have never been playable.
---
I also mostly agree here.
---
The only races I've found to make any sense lore wise were the BE and Draenai and even they were a bit of a stretch.
---
Worgen, Goblins, Pandas, all the void elves which are basically BE for Alliance and so on, all of that shit was utter crap.
---
Its the only rational response.
---
No, cause I would be trying to guess about a complex technology without sufficient knowledge of the subject. Like everyone else that isn't on the wow dev team.
---
Thanks, I will try to find it and post link when I get home.
---
I'm sure this is a fringe thing and doesn't represent layering as a whole.
---
WoW Classic, just like vanilla, only different.
---
Hunter or Rogue?   
---
I love PvP, complexity, viability in raids, being valued by my group, and playing a class I can comfortably main throughout classic WoW.   
---
How do hunters and rogues both perform in all of these things - what are some other things I should consider?
---
Link: https://github.com/shoestare/eCastingBarClassic
---
Well I do have two friends who will *hopefully* be leveling with me, so i may have a healer running along with me.
---
Gratz! Great song choice
---
Thats because blizzard deliberately does keeps mis informing people, at first it was only gonna be starting zones, then it would only be for the first few weeks and the latest is it wont last any longer than phase1, which is an indefinite amount of time because we don't know how long phases will be.
---
found the single guy with no family
---
Upvoted
---
Because they didn't want a neutral third player faction. Which would have made a lot of sense for several of the races (basically all the expansion races and tauren. Maybe not goblins).
---
How poor do you have to be to be unable to pay $15/mo?
---
I don't know about this. MoP is the best expansion IMO. And who the fuck thinks WoD was underappreciated? Literally everybody hates it.
---
Difference is there is no reward for doing well in amateur softball or bowling leagues. 
---
A lot of those guys who don't care would feel very differently if winning gave a valuable reward.
---
That's not vanilla!!!!! How dare you
---
Wtf level 15 in a few hours? Classic is ruined lmao literally took 12 hours back in the day
---
That's the most ignorant thing i've ever heard. You said stop trying to fix something as if i'm giving coding and design input. Then assuming it is technology that is being discussed here rather then it's feature. That's like, what even is the point of reddit if people can't openly discuss their opinion about something what.
---
You guys will be happy to know I just cut my run time down to 9:55, now no content creators can make a livable income :)
---
I dont understand what you do for a living I'd you are not a lawyer. What are you?
---
What class/race do you plan on playing on classic? I’m kinda curious what a cop rolls... paladin?
---
You will be downvoted, but I'll have to agree. It's bullshit that you can't post in the forums without a subscription despite having paid for both game and subscriptions in the past. 
---
I played official WoW for a very short period in Cataclysm and I was having an issue with my account and stopped playing because of it, and whenever I emailed customer support they kept telling me to seek help in the forums, which I made it very clear I did not have access to because my I no longer had game time.
---
&gt; I work the typical 9-5.
---
Yeah, the entire realm will be going to bed by the time you login. You might have a couple hours with the super late night players. You might also find a guild raiding to your schedule, but there's no promise of that. In any case, you won't really be playing with your friends.
---
&gt; Is there any PvP benefit to having higher ping?
---
No, not really, at least not until you get into crazy high pings and start warping over the place as a melee class, but it's a double-edged sword. For every time it helps you, it hurts you at least once too. Missed interrupts, potentially more outright disconnects, it's just not worth considering for any perceived advantage.
---
Def considering it! But don't they require a lot of gear? Wont be able to raid much
---
As a counterpoint druid makes a great tank while leveling because they are the opposite of warriors and very gear independent.  The cat build is pretty much the same as the bear build so he'll be able to solo just fine or dps when you've got someone else tanking.  Having two guys rolling on leather all the time is going to be annoying maybe, but it's not that big of a deal and early on the stuff drops constantly.
---
An early level tauren in Mulgore is such a beautiful scene. 
---
You have helped me decide. Tauren Druid it shall be!
---
average lvl time is about 9 days played (active). If you play 11 mins each day for a year you will hit your goal.
---
All the good PServers are shutting down before Classic launches and the rest will be empty.
---
Grats to her! That excited giggle got me hype. 
---
How ever, just to keep shitting on blizz, it looks pretty empty for a “stress test”. Maybe they should’ve allowed us unfaithfuls who have unsubbed until August to join the stress test.
---
Do you go to every game your not playing a rage about them making monetizing their work?
---
He does have a point, 15$ just for vanilla is a lot, i mesn for 10-15$ a month i can get ubisoft game pass or xbox game pass or even psnow and play hundreds of games. 
---
Also, blizz lets you play retail wow up untill bfa with those 15$ but lets face it, most returning players want the vanilla experience so they should offer it as a standalone sub for less
---
The first time I played wow I spent about 6 months in my level 30's pvping with my friend on our hunters in STV. Leaving that zone to level up higher was so boring.
---
Outstanding move.
---
No, but it does have to happen 100% of the time for the hypothesis to be correct.
---
If not, you keep testing.
---
Blizzard should absolutely consider altering world buffs. Insodoing, they wouldn’t be #changing Classic WoW, but rather Private Server WoW. Just like Blizzard should fix it if there were any other hidden game-breaking mechanic that became discovered this go around.
---
This is how I level. I like my professions to be maxed out as I level. It's really expensive but it's fun.
---
While I don't agree with this person's post you shouldn't make fun of other people's potential financial problems
---
So if I understand how you did the mage fireblast then, it’s your model to their sphere.
---
So a 20 yd range fire blast can be a maximum of 23 yds (20+3 from sphere) against a non Tauren. But against a Tauren it’s increased due to the increased sphere (2.2 for female and 2.55 for male, which is 25.2 yards and 25.55 yards respectively)
---
Yet if Taurens could fireblast (let’s say they can here). It wouldn’t matter since it’s 20 yds +3 for the enemy sphere (non Tauren) = 23 yards
---
So being a Tauren is a huge disadvantage when it comes to casts.
---
There’s nothing new to possibly say about classic and hasn’t been for a while so people are just going to rehash the same things over and over until it’s out. Then it’s just gonna be mundane screenshots of things like “got journeyman fishing today, felt really proud. Classic feels so rewarding.” Or a similar variant of ‘the simple things that made vanilla memorable’ or just straight nostalgia posts “here I am entering ashenvale for the first time in 15 years”
---
Everything has already been done millions of times and nothing matters because we’re all going to die in a relatively short amount of time anyway. Just do your shit and let other people do their shit even if it’s annoying.
---
Once windfury got its dmg cut in half the enhance spec pretty much became non viable for pvp.
---
&gt; so there might be room in raids for carries and filler because it probably wont be as much a wipefest as it was back in the day.
---
The problem is deciding who gets to be carried. A lot of healers would prefer to go ret/enhancement/boomkin. They start asking why the other guy gets to do it and they don't?
---
95% of those are trolls
---
Lok'tar friend.
---
Is playing current day wow a good idea to experiment to figure out what class I like or is it so different it’s not worth I have no experience with MMO’s
---
Horde Rogue. Question is: Female Orc or Male Undead. And is hardiness that noticeable for pvp?
---
Engineering grenades.
---
You want a discussion fine, don't title your post "obvious fix" like you have any idea what you're talking about.
---
It is certainly not the best in terms of levelling speed and efficiency, but it would be a fine enough combo. As pointed out already priest/pally lacks synergy because of the pally having a free mount and the priest having no movement. Pally/Warlock is a great combo. The pally can heal the lock while the lock sacks health to have almost infinate sustain. Locks can down mobs very fast and with a pocket pally to keep you downing mob after mob. They also both get free mounts.  Of course you should always play the class you WANT to play unless you are really in to min maxing.
---
I went to whip mine out as well, then realized I never used one after finding [this.](https://imgur.com/a/ajoB6x6)
---
Who knows. They said it was starting areas a few months ago.
---
We have no idea how long phase 1 is going to last, even that said, most guilds already have their MT's picked, or will early on. With that said, you don't NEED to be the first warrior 60 on the server, getting raid prebis can take you a few days of intense grind. It's the long term time investment and personality of the MT that matters most.
---
There's a lot of other things that go into being a tank, besides just getting that dungeon gear. Getting consumables, resist gear materials and whatnot are time consuming and expensive.
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
Hunter farming is soloing dungeons or killing tougher monsters (eg skinning Devilsaurs) out in the world.
---
Mage farming is AoE farming huge packs of mobs.
---
You might also considering Rogue for pickpocket farming.  It's fairly lucrative, chill, and if it's an alt you want to pvp on a pvp build is what you want for farming anyway.  It's not as strong of an earner as hunter and mage, generally speaking, but since you aren't killing mobs your efficiency isn't tied to your gear, a distinct advantage for an alt.
---
Also consider just picking up fishing on your priest because that shit earns money hand over fist if you know what you are doing.  Don't feel like you can't farm and instead need to level an alt to earn gold.
---
If you're not playing at launch and you see a person 4 levels above you, how do you know they are rushing? 120Head Tapioca Brain
---
They are charging 15$ just to get into a stress test for 48 hours. They have been charging that for a chance at getting into the damn beta. 
---
I don't even want to know how much money they have made from just the beta already.
---
I originally wanted to roll Human Rogue since Human has the + sword for over, but after reading a lot of these posts it seems like raiding will be too time intensive. 
---
As a casual player, I will likely just be logging on for an hour or two most nights at level 60. So probably just play a few battleground sessions. I also want to level a Shaman alt...sounds like I should just go horde?
---
I do want to PvE as well but probably won’t have the dedication/availability for raiding
---
Good guilds had no issue filling raids. We were always flooded with applications from players in bad guilds who were taking anyone they could find.
---
No no you're right, only average 1 hit a minute will do double damage so that single digit increase in damage becomes barely double digit. Game changer.
---
There's just no avoiding it though. You are at a big disadvantage against them. You have to blow all your cooldowns. Even with evasion you still are taking a guaranteed overpower crit to the face every 5 sec and the accompanying deep wounds bleed. 
---
Pretty sure if the dude is swinging an ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOO!! then you have 3 overpower crits before you are dead or in execute range.
---
Gotta lock him down and pray that the cheap shot doesn't get resisted. If it does just vanish and run away.
---
If it is an orc such as I and you're afraid of getting the cheap shot whiffed, try to tick them down with bleeds first before blowing your first vanish. Especially if you have the element of surprise. Garrote + rupture can take a decent chunk out of their health pool so long as you don't let them sit down and eat.
---
People who unironically say "retail babies" are insufferable.
---
Most of the people are still like level 8-10ish, the starting areas were pretty brutally crowded. There were more than 50 of every class in the night elf starting zone on the server I chose. More players than there were mobs to accommodate. I imagine once you get a bit ahead of the pack you start to get even further ahead because you have less competition.
---
Can't believe people are asking this lol
---
Most of the time, its a mix. Some people failed at raid mechanics, but that could have been overcome if the dps was better.
---
Ya, I posted this before the servers were live in order to give people the heads up.
---
Because it would still be an issue at 20
---
man, here let me give back an obvious comment. You're completely missing the point and it is obvious. The same way that the way people would abuse layering already was obvious. Which is currently being abused as it was said it would be. Oh no did i trigger the obvious SJW police
---
You can post in the classic discussion for WoW without a sub.
---
For world PvP it's great. My man Drifting used to play 31 fire 20 frost. You can still find his PvP videos on Youtube.
---
I can't believe we're all getting back into this.
---
There is literally only one guy in my old 40 man who refuses to get involved again. &gt; . &gt;
---
You're not gonna have the gold for your mount at 40 just by looting kills and budgeting. You need to be selling stuff on the AH or farming.
---
I mean... Why do you have to pay a sub for a 48 hour stress test. A full month of sub for 2 days? That's just silly
---
This. You need to put a ring on that BEFORE WoW opens and she changes her mind. &gt; . &gt;
---
We can do it, we just lack the Old World's proficiency.
---
Kicking a bad player and filling his spot can take 30 minutes to an hour.
---
You want every edge you can get at the start.
---
&gt; This one is ours.
---
No, it's Blizzard's.
---
If too few people keep playing the game, they'll shut it down.
---
If they think they have a solid method to convert Classic players over to Retail, they'll shut it down.
---
If you look at them funny, they'll shut it down.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2rfxd/leveling_is_a_lot_easier_than_p_servers_thats/).

Also still using mine.

Yeah Im mostly just playing with addons and stuff, don't wanna put all that effort into a 2 day character. Will be going hard on launch
---
Wrong, KarOva
---
It's not smart at all for Blizzard to have a separate subscription for Classic. They absolutely want to convert Classic players over to Retail.
---
A smarter man than us.
---
Nope, its double O, kOrOva
---
&gt;  It's still not that big of a deal though and no reason to deny them for the most part.
---
The issue is if you bring the meme spec and it doesn't work out... it is going to take 30 minutes to an hour to bring someone else in.
---
Seriously? A 4 disc game from before dlc existed is like retail? Try again. It's a valid metaphor. You don't steal all the napkins every time you leave a fast food restaurant either. Abusing in game systems and mechanics is a choice.
---
I apologize for bad info. It seems their current official stance is "a few weeks, and definitely no layering in phase 2" - ion (wow dev)
---
https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=114 - this is Ion saying in november '18 that SHARDING (not layering) would last a "few weeks"
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layering-good-or-bad/172056/12 - scroll down and go to 48:30 on staysafe's VoD, watch 2-3 mins to get into it. he says layering will last a few weeks or months however he is not a wow dev so, grain of salt - may '19
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=229 - this is omar saying the whole continent will be layered, not just starting zones - may '19
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=317 - this is Ion saying it will be the first few weeks - may '19
---
The real issue is whether you think they'll only keep it for around 3-4 weeks or 24 weeks. Define "a few" and why they would need to clarify that it wouldn't be in phase 2 (speculating phase 1 will last 3-6 months, they stated the timeline for phases is still unknown because they want it to be community-driven https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=639)
---
Why do U have to pay for a sub without interruption to get the statue. Blizzards games, their rules. I missed the statue cos I unsubbed for three months. I didn't bitch. That's the decision they made. They rewarded loyalty as part of their business model.
---
Don't feel like an ass; his first paragraph specifically mentions maxing all of 'em. 🖖

Ruined ? Lol

What purpose would fabricating that serve.

It's great that they replaced the flagged song with a cover instead of some random other song, but if you want the original music it's here: [https://archive.org/details/Maydie\_-\_Rank\_14\_Warrior\_-\_Outdoor\_and\_BG\_pvp\_Warrior\_2005-11-20\_4.81](https://archive.org/details/Maydie_-_Rank_14_Warrior_-_Outdoor_and_BG_pvp_Warrior_2005-11-20_4.81)
---
He was claiming a lot more than that.  
---
He was very specifically claiming that Character 1 is assigned Layer 1, Character 2 is assigned Layer 2, etc.  
---
How fucking stupid are you that you can't comprehend how ridiculously unlikely this is and absolutely needs further testing.  
---
He advises "when you have some spare time, create a new character on a new layer" and explains that he has 7 characters all on different layers.  
---
How can he know that?
---
It's laughably unlikely that a character is assigned a static layer at creation.
---
It's ok, logic isn't for everyone, you'll find you're niche.
---
fwooooooooosh *windchimes*
---
That's natural though. Play through a game for the first time and you'll take substantially longee
---
Big if true
---
Reddit points.
---
The priest needs to use healing spells only. Bubble only to save the party member if they will die. It is also advantageous to use only renew when healing during combat and use either type of heal while out of combat. This will reduce your burst threat. This important not because you dont want the priest to die (the priest can be pretty tanky) it is because the more the warrior is hit the harder it hits back and the faster overall enemies die.
---
Congrats, that's a nice little fun MMO moment.
---
I am honestly surprised it was a Shaman, but I guess in this case circumstance and mob luck had more to do with it than class? Congrats, that's a nice little fun MMO moment.
---
Ew.
---
Nope. The same setting existed in vanilla.
---
Great Video man. Have you ever thought about making a video teaching us how to world pvp against rogues? or against warriors? what about mages? which talents, which rotations, which professions etc..?
---
Reckoning Human Paladin here.

I have to say from personal experience, Thunderbrew is the best drink available from the Dwarves of Ironforge. Lights fire when you exhale it into a world enlarged by a Gnomish World Enlarger. Great party trick.

ohh u did a no no  lol

Re: raid healing
---
It's kind of the one part of the game that actually not changed all that much, or is actually even more involved in vanilla than it is now in retail.  Obviously in the higher raids there's more an emphasis on stacking "while casting" mana regen but especially early on you'll be watching the 5-second-rule like a hawk.  If you are looking for interesting or challenging DPS content, vanilla didn't really have that and classic won't either. 
---
Actually tanking is pretty similar to what it is now too, less spammy (like healing) and more focus on coming prepared than hitting buttons.  If you want to hit buttons and clear content maybe stick with mage, though.  DPS is kind of a "what are you doing" role in classic, while Tank and Healer are "how are you doing it" roles, if that makes sense.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2M23tkKobU)
---
Ah ok I understand now. So the 1.4 applies to both sides, as long as at least one of them is a Tauren.
---
You're*
---
Nah I just got my asbestos fire resist gear
---
&gt; Was LFG available during Vanilla?
---
No. I don't believe it was, but it's a change I actually like so I'm not complaining.
---
For launch maybe. 12 months after launch though TBC/Wrath servers will be hugely popular. Classic is basically advertising those servers to a million players.
---
If U glance up you will see the post lost me Reddit points
---
Well I can understand in later expansions why that would be the case since wpvp was dead. Also, classic will likely have a very different audience.
---
Hi, you've said 'titles' which suggests more than this one.  Do you mind pointing out the others you felt were click bait, I'm honestly genuinely interested to know where you felt I was being misleading.
---
Don’t you think Resto Druid could solo really well too, though? It might be slower but I figured you’d likely outlive almost anything?
---
🚴
---
Do you just prefer the TB leveling experience, or do you have min/max reasons for playing through the Tauren newb zone?
---
Bye and don't come back :)
---
Do you mean others titled like this, or different?
---
I just dont want to pay for a sub to play until classic is out, or I would be helping with the stress. If they did an OPEN stress they would feel private server issues.
---
No, it really isn't. And besides, the new copyright protections planned for Europe next year is going to leave PServers without a feasible place to host.
---
I just popped my Mini-Diablo in game. Safe to say they're in!
---
The whole reason they shut down 8/10 servers was because there wasn't enough players... so people got to lvl 6 very easily, and then the people on those two servers got to keep playing ahead of the pack while everyone else got jammed onto 400 player starting zones and was stuck at level 2 for 2 hours.
---
Come on dude. Loyalty programs have to be the most obvious marketing schemes out there. Like seriously nobody should be buying into that crap. 
---
They are out to make money. I don't blame them. I just don't try and fool myself into thinking there's some other thing driving their business now. A sub for a chance at a beta is pretty bad. Subs for a few hours of access to a stress test is not rewarding loyalty. Anybody could get a sub right now and log on for the last few hours.
---
Enhance shaman doesn't get into raids for T3 gear.
---
Female orc as hardiness IS noticeable.
---
Yea on Server 15, it was not this way...
---
That's literally the experience that we're asking for. You're not even making a point. That's exactly what we've said we want this whole time.
---
Instead of just ranting about how it will destroy wow. Why not give some actual evidence or points or something intelligent and thought out u can read. You are just ranting expecting me to understand what you are talking about.
---
Cata gameplay and the first tier of raids was fun, but adding transmog and lfr will forever sour people’s view of it. MoP has really fast paced gameplay and decent raids it is definitely under appreciated. WoD onwards was when they started their manipulative bullshit to keep people playing forever.
---
In terms of classes how they feel no, but as for the feel of the game itself, gives you a decent idea. You can play on a private server that is patch 1.12 (classic) if you really want the classic feel before it launches.
---
I believe it was some kind of ding sound in EverQuest and it simply carried over from there.
---
Goblins utter crap? They easily have the best developed culture, architectural style and even hero/leader characters of the non-playable vanilla races.
---
Aren’t enough players to stress 15 servers that have layers of 3000 people each at 5pm est (most people aren’t even home from work) and 2pm cst (almost everyone is still at work)
---
So surprised
---
You do realize that when WoW released, it was THE most casual MMORPG on the market by far?
---
You do realize that the main reason why WoW because so successful was BECAUSE of how casual it was?
---
You do realize that it basically created the themepark genre of MMORPGs?
---

Covers it fairly well.
---
Amusing names. If they're allowed, hey, I don't judge.
---
Going Warlock, unsure of race. Primarily playing PvP, a bit of PvE. 
---
I’m not all that interested in Humans, so it’s between Orc, UD, and Gnome. I’ll probably play a female orc, male UD, or male gnome.
---
Even if this was a good idea (which I firmly believe it is not) blizz will not do it. The formula of changes and patch release schedule made them immense amounts of money. They will stick as close to that schedule as there is not a huge player exodus.
---
I was a crazy sumbitch in vanilla and was often something like 0/30/21 when I would pvp as a shaman (duels and world pvp primarily). I was meleeing with windfury while wearing t2 / 2.5 caster gear and a natural alignment crystal. Of course I would make plenty use of chain lightning and shocks as well. I was a hybrid through and through and I almost never lost a 1v1 and would often win 1v2s and 3s thanks to snap heals and huge burst deeps.
---
It helped I was geared of course. Fun times.
---
As opposed to not having fun playing the game we are playing?

What is even the point of this.  Some people have fun theorycrafting and others have fun going in blind.  That doesn't mean one or the other isn't going to enjoy the lvling experience though.

Cata had some great shit though. Leveling zones were mostly fantastic, dungeons/heroics were fantastic, first raid tier was fantastic.
---
Its main issues were taking too long to release new content and class homogenization.
---
Nice!
---
I would say it's a little bit of min/max mixed with being bored waiting for classic. Ive been seeing how fast I can get running from every horde starter to the others. 
---
I've made each run a couple of times on pservers and then I finally get to test on beta just to find out half the death skips dont work properly lmao.

9:55 is by far my best time as the death skips worked out in this routes favour.

It was every 2 weeks *and* you couldn't get tier or weapons from the box, not exactly a downpour of items.
---
 Totally agree, but thankfully layering is temporary anyway, once populations stabilize the layers will get merged.
---
no. I have the same and I do not have beta access. that is there for you to use for the stress test and also for the actual game once Classic launches.
---
It means you have access to a 48 hour stress test thats open to anyone with a current NA sub.
---
Only for the stress test I think

I will probably do this, I dont have time to go all in at once, so I better spread it out and just take a chill pill to be honest; You know, enjoy the game.

Cant wait
---
So why would I get phased as a level 40, in a zone with no one else in sight, when I join a group with people whose aren’t in my same zone?
---
I understand the fundamental reason they’re doing it. I just don’t trust their implementation of it.
---
You're an idiot.
---
I don't agree with it. I just see what they are doing and don't begrudge them for staying profitable. Anyone who had an active sub can play. Anyone who pays $15 to play a beta stress test probably deserves to be parted from their money.
---
why?
---
*sad paladin noises*
---
Is that nice?
---
NO LAYERING MEANS YOU WILL SIT FOR HOUR(S) IN A QUEUE ON THE LOADING SCREEN, then DC and return to the end of the queue.
---
Tauren have a hidden melee range bonus that is actually fairly strong in pvp and stomp is gives you an 'extra scatter'. 
---
Berserking is a lot stronger than people think pvp, don't feel like you are getting "nothing".
---
Elves... meh, but at least you'll start near an owl, no other race does.  I'm actually one of those people that thinks carrion birds are superior but you can't go wrong with an owl.  Also they just look cooler, let's be honest.

I was meleeing with windfury on my Fang of Mystics (once upon a time it had 50dps) while wearing t2 / 2.5 caster gear and a natural alignment crystal. Between the chain lightning openers, shocks, and windfury bursts I would just delete people in my "healer" gear. I pretty much never, ever lost a duel or even 1v2s etc in world pvp.
---
The pair ought to be able to afford one level 40 mount between them just fine.
---
Maybe WoW culture was clustured. I only know of a few videos with Nightwish, like one of a [Korean reckoning bomb paladin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxW5v-_rOP8) who model-changed to Blood Elf with game file edits.
---
He's not making it up. I saw many complaints of this very thing on the stress test.
---
There are other issues attached with layering. 
---
Such as how it affects World PVP, See attached clip:
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/TallSaltyPonyDxAbomb](https://clips.twitch.tv/TallSaltyPonyDxAbomb) 
---
Oh you don't play on a PvP server? So why does layering matter to you? Well consider this:
---
Additionally, your also going to be affected in a way that you may not be initially able to perceive. If all it takes is some "coordination" to abuse layering for the farming of high level valuable resources like Black Lotus, Thorium Ores, or Devilsaurs, you have to assume Gold Farmers are already paying attention on how best to exploit this for monetary gain. They can simply exploit this for the said period of 4-12 Weeks and stockpile resources to the point at which layering is phased out and then destroy the natural growth of a WoW sever's economy by simply having "coordinated" a method in which they amassed resources to the point in which none of your shit will sell on the AH because they control the supply and can undercut you. Suddenly, you might just start "whinging". Maybe not though, perhaps the way you play the game is not affected by these factors. But others have concerns that you aren't really taking into account
---
Good insight. Can you elaborate on any other ways a priest can farm gold?
---
Ah, why didn't you say so earlier? That explains a lot.
---
I would gladly pay even more only for Classic. Obviously Classic is better game than current retail and better products usually costs more. Lets put it 30 a month.
---
Legion is more Revenge of the Sith imo.
---
Yeah I see people getting frustrated at leveling speed, mana cost, and mob difficulty. I'm trying to keep people encouraged by explaining that classic is slower paced and more methodical.
---
You mean Glub-Glub?
---
LAYERING WILL BE COMPLETELY DISABLED **FOREVER** A FEW WEEKS AFTER LAUNCH, NEVER TO RETURN
---
the hell is wrong with you people
---
Warrior and Priest is a classic combo, but the Priest is just a healslut in this setup. Sure they can spam Smite/Pain from the back, but the Priest cannot increase Warrior's damage output or vice versa. And casting a lot causes mana issues, the Priest has to drink which slows everything down.
---
This is why Warrior/Paladin is so popular, because both classes can buff each other(Blessing of Might/Battle Shout) and amplify the damage output. Faster killing = faster leveling. And even in a full Ret gear a Paladin can easily heal themselves and one other player. Paladins aren't mana intensive when leveling and they have a lot of good utilities like bubble when things go wrong, Blessing of Freedom, res, Purify. The only downside is that they compete for gear since both use mail/ plate.
---
I honestly can't think of any better combo than Warrior/Paladin. Or rather, Paladin is the ultimate wingman class, and Warriors at least have Battleshout to buff them back.
---
Game. Set. Match. Game over. Opps, Blizz did it again.
---
Crul'shorukh.
---
Not really.
---
Like the other guy said, shaman... or druid.  Obviously you are going to be healing raids but you can absolutely tank without much time investment outside of raids.  If you want to spend (an admittedly large) time farming you can tank virtually every fight in the game.  HotW is super flexible and you'll be able to heal everything basically, even most raids, though you'll probably be more on decurse duty due to higher mana pool.  And when you aren't healing HotW is an absolute monster of wpvp and flagrunning.
---
Yeah, that's why you go as a healer and respec after the raid is over like I did.
---
RIP my gold.
---
No just use this time to learn for your first playthrough when Classic releases.
---
I can't wait for the second coming of private servers. So much more accurate data.
---
Shaman any day. Im even betraying the Alliance to play my Shaman.
---
Sorry guys, lok tar.
---
I'm 29 years old IRL and have obviously trained in the art of Warcraft. My boomer parents would stand no chance. Plus I have the only keys to their garage.
---
Beta testers pointed out literally every problem with BfA during the beta and basically fuckall happened. I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
And they specifically told people not to sub just to get into the beta. If people did anyways, they have no room to complain.
---
Jesus they really have conditioned you to just lap up every shit blizzard pushes out, didnt they? You're saying we're not allowed to discuss layering because we dont understand every tiny function of it? 
---
We as players can and SHOULD talk about how it effects us as that is the most important interaction.
---
Inb4 you reply to the PvP clip that this takes too much coordination or whatever; unless you have no friends and intend to play by yourself all throughout Classic, it seems very likely for individuals to be on Discord or TS together (BUT NOT IN THE SAME GUILD), to simply be ready to invite one another to avoid World PvP during their leveling by dodging ganks this way. This isn't something exclusive to streamers, and a split-second invite isn't an unrealistic practice. Put yourself in the shoes of the ganker as well, suddenly mid-gank your target just phases before your eyes and you're left there with a sense of disbelief as you've just popped cooldowns to gank this guy and he just duped you with a simple layering trick. Suddenly, you might just start "whinging". That is assuming you play on PvP of course. If not, then there's the other concern of gold farmers maximizing the exploits to their fullest potential and stockpiling resources for the inevitable drought of post-layering economy.
---
Wait why did you immediately try to message Nizar?
---
You can easily dps tank all the levelling dungeons if you just do them when you're 2-3 levels higher than necessary, like Cath at lv 44, ZF at lvl 48. You get a little bit less exp but it makes for fast easy runs and you never have to use a shield or go def stance (except maybe the last boss). You also top all the damage meters. :)

Where would you get all the mats for tailoring?
---
Tailoring it's better to do as you level. You get tailoring supplies just from killing humanoids. Mining for example is much harder to do while leveling because you'll generally out level your mining skill.
---
Yea, sorry bud. Everyone else is going to powerlevel to 60 and then grind one raid over and over.

They made the zone, the original hellfire peninsula was in the game files you can see it on youtube it looks like it did in wc3, from what I understand it was a single zone where players would go to the black temple and fight Illidan.

---
Yes to tailoring, if you level by grinding a lot of humanoids. 
---
Heck no to enchanting. That'll take some time and moneys
---
You're not a mod though
---
Enchanting is extraordinarily expensive and annoying to max out and you really need those shards and essences from high level instances as well as somewhat rare recipes. I'll highly advise against even bothering with enchanting as it gives you nothing that a guildie won't provide for free except in a few situations where disenchanting can be useful. Better have engineering in that slot as it's remarkably useful both while leveling, raiding and especially PvPing.
---
I'm talking the real old school stuff. Like 1-2 months after WoW's release old. Most of it was gold farming vids but old school twink videos had them too.

Because when you launch your game and log into your character he goes back to the layer he was first created in :)

I love fighting Arugal. Dungeon is pretty vanilla (heh) to that point - some cool environment stuff, enemies that are mostly elite versions of the stuff you fought already - and these big beefy dudes called Son of Arugal. So I'm expecting a real badass mage.
---
Start the fight, he's up on a platform just waiting for you. He casts shadowbolt a bit. That's it?
---
BAM, teleports across the room up onto a little ledge. Melee? Fuck you, run for it just for him to poof away as you get there. Now your pitiful half Mana frostbolt casting ass is basically 1v1 against this dude. Such a memorable early dungeon.

I have access to normal beta and enjoy leveling. While it took me hours, the avg player won't be as fortunate to hit that so quickly.
---
Are you seriously, not trolling? Unironically comparing a multiplayer game with thousands of other concurrent players to a single player game cause that just makes you look stupid and invalids any argument you were trying to make.
---
One of the biggest appeals of classic especially for people who missed out on the pre-sharding era is the idea of everyone being on one server together, just because your brain has been subject to sharding and lobby based gameplay doesn't mean other people don't see the problems with this system (that no one asked for)
---
Shaman mob-tagging is really OP :)

I just spent like 2 hours leveling to 3.5 trying to snipe boars and tigers before other players in teldrassil or whatever the NE starting zone is.  It sucks.  You had to not only camp the spawns but also be lucky enough to be far away from a hunter or rogue with throwing knives.  I have no idea how a class without a ranged attack would be able to progress.

Question about leveling as a Pally. I’m planning on doing a Ret/Holy hybrid so I can fill both roles with relative ease. I’m ok with keeping up with 2 sets of gear as needed while leveling to be able to run quests and such easily while also being able to heal dungeons along the way. Planning on playing with friends of all kinds of classes though I know right know I’ll run with a Hunter and Warrior for sure. Can I heal leveling dungeons without needing to run full Holy? Again I’m willing to keep up gear as needed but idk if that requires more respecing then not. Some insight on this would be appreciated. 
---
Also wondering what the best profession would be to run for this. I’ll be doing a good amount of PvE and PvP (though still fairly casual overall nothing too hardcore I don’t think) so considering getting Engineering/Mining but I’ve heard during leveling to go Skinning/Herbalism. Again insight here would be nice.
---

I lived in Russia for a couple years

Says I wasn’t able to play. It gave me the option for beta stress test.  Was everyone who has a sub able to test?
---
Awesome board, I love the dice

I.. I don't get the confusion either
---
What people don't understand is that you aren't paying $15/mo for Classic. You are paying $15/mo for WoW in general. It actually gives you access to Classic as well as the Modern game. 
---
No one says you have to Sub to get into the Stress Test, that's on you. If you don't think 2 days of enjoying the stress test is worth $15, then you have different priorities and your time is worth less than others. 
---
I've payed $20 for indie games that were less than 10 hours long and have no replayability, and have been happy about it.

This splits the community, and in 6 months they'll have to do a bunch on merges. And Blizzard is slow on merges, they promised more for retail a year and a half ago in a Q&amp;A, and nothing came of it.
---
It's better to have as many people as possible on a few servers. The big problems though are people hopping layers any time they want, and layers being everywhere.
---
If they solve these two problems, everything is fine.
---
Its in your post, cross realm BGs were in 1.12. LFG and LFR were not. 
---
That simple.
---
I cannot wait for OP to smash this keyboard like my axe has smashed his toon's face.
---
 When any private server is more blizzlike than official classic wow xD.
---
Yeah I know, just being hyperbolic. In any case, horde would have less competition for it since shamans can't use swords.
---
I don't really see what this would fix? The reason why we have layering is that we don't want to sit in queues for hours and hours on launch and also we can't really do anything in a starter zone with thousands of players. I've experienced this before and it's not pretty. 
---
The bad part is that it splits up the realm a bit, but from what I can understand, layering makes it less likely you will phase in and out which is very immersion breaking. 
---
I don't really understand what you're trying to fix. Instead of layer hopping by joining parties you want us to travel all the way to a city, enter another layer, travel back to where you were questing and if it didn't improve you'll have yo redo it again. I don't really see the point.
---
Would be easier leveling to 60 then focusing on maxing the professions.
---
I still associate Pain of Salvation's "BE" with leveling in Vanilla even today. Will be playing all that on repeat 100%
---
I don't know about 1k in starting zones, but the first day is still going to be a mess. There's no mob sharing, and range instant taggers will rule the quest mobs.
---
L oh fucking L
---
Correct. Due to the strange way it works it was kind of hard to explain it all without making the video really long.
---
Thanks buddy.
---
No, a fully functional, moderated, curated and cared for game isn't worth less than it originally was (not taking into account fifteen years' inflation). If the $15 price tag that's been with retail WoW for a decade and a half is too steep, go play on a skeezy pirate server that'll either end up a ghost town once Classic launches or end up full of cheapskates like you that really really really want to play Classic, but don't actually want to pay what it's worth to do it.
---
It's more convenient for Blizzard to just put the two subs together in one. It's more convenient for the players to just have one sub instead of two. Sure, there's lots of people who will only play one or the other, but at the same time, someone who started in WoD or Legion might pick up Classic on a lark since it's included in their sub anyway and end up liking it. Players get the freedom to go back and forth, Blizzard gets the $15/month they always wanted, everybody wins and it's simple.
---
The point is that currently active players were supposed to join the test, not people resubbing for the test
---
No, I'm not trolling... look, I don't like it either, but good lord it's not THAT big a deal. You can not abuse it if you don't want to. If it doesn't end with phase 1, then I'll get concerned. Until then, I just think people are freaking out for the sake of it.
---
I was paying $15 14 years ago and was more than happy to. $15 now is nothing after 14 years of inflation. If $15 is too much for you, then you can't afford it. Do you also complain that you can't afford a Ferrari? No, you just accept that you can't have one.
---
You do not need holy talents at all to level a paladin, but like you I intend to play with a warrior so I will be funneled all the int gear and expect to heal at least some the entire time I level.  
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=paladin&amp;talents=GwGxGyGzGAINIOF-GaGbHUISITHGHHHIHJHKHcHdHeHgHfIUHtHuHvHBHwHxGcGdGpGqGEGFGGGBGCGDGHGIGeGfGgGhGiGopsIQIR
---
Early on it is best to bounce aggro between you and the warrior, because your ability to heal is garbage.  You can start holy, but once again I think getting efficiency, soc, and runspeed helps more in ret.  You will be the slowest moving, imp might buffs the warrior and the pet so gets double value.  After that I go holy so that I get the core healing talents by the mid 30s, that is when warrior gets his main aoe and I think you are better off using your mana healing him then doing damage.  Of course there is a lot of single target stuff, so I do fill out the rest of ret.  
---
Engr is a near requirement for any pvp serious paladin.  Mining pairs best with it, but is quite difficult to level.  Particularly from 20-30 when you are looking for tin veins, there are just frankly no where near enough.  Often to keep up mining with your level it costs several hours of slowly running around.  I would go skinning only, or not at all.  Even skinning when you add it all up is quite a lot of time, and in your case you would be making your friends wait for you all the time.  I would only do it if your friends were equally committed to level professions.
---
That’s a Spicy Meatball

 Dad gamer spotted, you probably like retail dont you.
---
Well, did you finish the questline?
---
I tell the same things to all my friends who never played. 60 raiding and pvping is a blast, but the journey to get there that's the real game for me.
---
Orc is best on horde, and gnome best on alliance based purely on racials.  UD is not a bad 2nd pick, but it helps primarily in matchups you do outstanding well in to begin with.
---
I will! I plan on reading every quest and fully getting involved with every zone I level in and I can not wait to be level 30 while most of my friends are in their 50s
---
What you don't realize is that having only 1 sub is a good thing. Activision only sees it as a WoW subscription, not a Classic WoW subscription. If they notice that 2x people are Subbed to Classic than Retail, they will have more desires to monetize the game with MTX and ruin it.
---
That'd be great except the copyright protections hitting Europe next year will completely eliminate that continent as a viable hosting location, which is the only viable hosting location today.
---
You certainly can have enough if you do it properly. By also not buying every spell and not repairing your gear when ever.
---
Edgyyyyyyyy

Tanking raid set earned in raids makes it completely moot. Tanking paladins do exist but only in a guild that has raids on farm more as a novelty than a need. The whole purpose is to make pre raid pre-bis blue kinds of items that budding tank paladins can get in say quests and 5 mans to start off as a tank for a guild starting raids and making tanking paladins a close viable choice to start off with on progression towards raids.
---
Why doesn’t blizzard just add layering to the starting zones and the starting zones only?
---
This is probably the first or a few to ease into it. I imagine future full access stress tests will be starting around prime time.
---
Yes &amp; No.
---
If taurens could fireblast, a tauren vs a non tauren would still use the tauren calculation since one of the players is a tauren. The player-sphere would be (for male) 3 + 2.55 + 0 = 5.55 so the fire blast would have a 25.55 yard range.
---
If somehow taurens could fire blast, then a tauren vs tauren would have a player-sphere of 3+2.55+2.55 = 8.1. The fire blast range for this case would be 20 + 8.1 = 28.1 yards.
---
While the tauren hitbox could be seen as a disadvantage in some cases, I see it as purely an advantage (for nondruids). The reason I say this is because taurens can strategically use/cancel savory deviate delight to decrease/increase their hitbox when it suits them. 
---
When running out deadzone from a mage for example, it would be beneficial for me to use deviate delight. 
---
When a mage is in my deadzone, and i'm trying to get a wing clip, it would be beneficial to be in tauren form.

It isn't just that you resist stuns, you cause enemy players to think, nah i'd rather not get resisted ill stun that undead rogue instead.  I guess the same could be said for undead, but in pvp if your group is well organized you should have tremor available.  Getting stunned as a rogue is typically a death sentence.
---
Cool, cool
---
Just remember, like 56% of the time hardiness does nothing. It's a fantastic racial, just another side of the coin
---
I noticed the same thing during the last stress test and reported it, it's a LoS thing. Though it's one of those things where I might be remembering wrong.
---
Yeah made the mistake putting this here than classicwowplus reddit which I did put one up there now.
---
 I don't blame anybody or their guilds for exploiting this to all hell and back. Just farm up everything 100 x with layering exploits and be set up to dominate for the entire lifespan of the game. It's just basically going to be a layering simulation, who can out exploit and out layer the rest. That will be the meta going forward. Instead of worrying about faction, class, race, etc.. Don't worry about actually playing the game. Learn how to master layering. Even if they take it out months down the line in phase 2 (I don't believe them), the game is already donezo. The damage and the advantage is irreversible. "Layer me, baby!" :)
---
It's a necessary evil, no? What's your solution to handling 4-5k people in one zone?
---
Cataclysm was actually dope but people love to bandwagon that it sucked.
---
Did you do any testing with min shoot range and the melee leeway mechanic? It appears when both players are moving, melee range is extended an additional 2 yards. Does this leeway impact the min shoot range at all? Or is the min shoot range the same distance regardless if both players are moving? Thanks for your work!
---
Is this just for cosmetics, or does it make it easier to pay attention to what you're doing when you missclick or if there's a lot on the screen?
---
Speak for yourself mate, I still love the game enough spend an incredible amount of hours on private servers because there were no alternative. I'm definitely looking forwards to not having my characters suddenly deleted for the 10th time.
---

I used to sit in AV and target enemies through the ground for hours from behind a hill never seeing any of them.
---
That’s part of the fun
---
blizzard dropped the ball on layering
---
Fuck off if you're comparing TLJ with BFA. I enjoyed TLJ a lot, and even if I was the only one, that's infinity% more than enjoyed BFA
---
Any time I have brought up layering I literally received 100 downvotes. Layering won't be going anywhere, the normies all want it.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if its an issue. When I was raiding on a Fury Warrior in Cataclysm before they reworked threat to make it a joke I still had to constantly worry about pulling threat.
---
Yeah that’s true but I also do believe 2handed fury is not too bad on horde with windfury so it could make it better for warriors. So I don’t know honestly
---
Yeah man, sounds great dude. Fantastic idea. Perfect execution. Never heard better. Indubitably.
---
I did not. Melee leeway is very difficult to test due to latency/coordination/finding players willing to test with me on beta (it is kind of dead atm and a lot of the players are a bit hard to work with.).
---
I feel like the min shoot range is not effected by melee leeway just from my time playing on beta, but I have not done actual tests to verify this.
---
If i'm able to get any solid data i'll update you.
---
Don’t underestimate a gnome lock with a holy paladin friend who can BoP and freedom you.
---
You just cannot compare WoD with Revenge of the Sith
---
And here comes the abuse of mechanic
---
Can't we just have a vanilla server for once? We've been begging Blizzard for a decade.. let us have the server we've wanted for so long and then in a few years we can explore other options.
---
I’d happily take 5 chew and spew burgers for the price of an ice cream cone.... 
---
Blizzard is maximising profits while providing extra value to an existing product. Makes sense to me.
---
You don't stay in the starting areas. You go out and explore and gain experience that way. Then when you're maybe lvl 5 up in Winterspring, you Hearth back and just run straight to Sen Jin village :)
---
Exactly. Holy hell where those heroic dungeons tough and exciting. I still remember getting my volcanic drake. Raids were overall really fun too I think my guild was the first to down heroic nefarian but it was a small pop.
---
He's in Charlotte, so it's likely AT&amp;T fiber.
---
Troll regenerates 5hp per second until he wakes back up. Kills all of them 2 at a time.
---
I'm willing to guess 50 ish
---
Why is WoD under appreciated? It's easily the worst expansion. I'd rather have BFA over WoD any day. That said, BFA is still complete dog shit.
---
No, can you please share it?
---
Y’all are falling for this bait
---
Why the would you go to reddit to figure this out. You could've literally asked ingame and figured it out within seconds. Don't be shy, ask general chat next time.
---
If you don't see a problem with 1000 tidal charms on each realm by P2 due to layering I seriously can't even talk to you. I couldn't agree with you more.
---
&gt;/u/nightfyr is not eligible for that quest.

No, sorry, you probably didn't do the preq.
---

Do you want to wait 3 hours for an AV queue because you decided to not play on a populated server? Because that’s going to happen without cross realm BGs. People are clinging onto cross realm like it single handedly destroyed WoW, when cross realm BGs was a positive change so that people could actually get into a BG game within a reasonable amount of time, and that’s worth sacrificing the offchance that you meet a friend in a WSG game because that guy made a sick play and clutched the game out or somethin.
---
All these quality of life things to hold the normies hands and make it easier are what ruined the game in the first place. Just add more servers. Problem solved. If the normies say it's too tough to level and it's taking too long, oh well. They have BFA. Blizz isn't about what's best for the game, it's about what will make them the most money. (I know, it's a business.) Layering kills the game, but it makes the normies happy, so layering it is.
---
No. Crossrealm is not sharding.
---
Sharding is a term that means to split up player in to seperate shards. Thst is it. Crossrealm is another system blizzard has, which is just a system for allowing player on different servers to play with each other.
---
There is also phasing, which puts players in different states depending on various triggers.
---
So, in short, cross realm and sharding is not the same but can work together.
---
\&gt; Delete Alt2 \&gt; Create NewAlt.
---
Does NewAlt take Alt2's spot or is it assigned a new layer?
---
If it's assigned a new layer, do the assigned layers for all Alts shift up 1, surely it's not tied to position in the character screen?  
---
If we have a maximum of 10 characters per server, are there 10 layers per server?  
---
Does deleting alts reduce the population of a layer or just the server?
---
You don't work with computers do you?  
---
Seriously, the logic of what you are fervently defending is ludicrous once you start scaling it.

Subliminal messages to get more ppl to sub to WoW way back in the day.

If you watch the vid/listen to her now, you can't deny that she's saying "play world of warcraft" "give us your money."

As a vanilla NElf Priest I'm still butthurt over raid leaders treating even bad Dwarf Priests like Fabergé eggs because they relied so much on FW. I know Horde did fine without FW, tell that to Alliance raid leaders
---
best duo team for what? PvE leveling while questing? i'd go double hunter. PvP ganking/fighting? tossup but if one of you can be pally or another healer (if you're horde) while one of you is a warrior, you're golden.
---
"Play world of warcraft."
---
"Give us your money."
---
If only Mn had been testing this stuff on stream for weeks right?
---
He knows what he's talking about.
---
If you have to knowledge and a raspberry pi avaliable, look into pi-hole.
---
Yet they've managed to change it several times in the 30(?) days of the beta?
---
I know what the tooltip says, but on private servers it does in fact scale better then the base AP.  Nude at 60 on warrior it is 101 AP, but with a full set of blues it is 157 AP.  It appears to scale base AP + AP gained from strength, but not AP gained from +attack power gear.  
---
I cannot confirm if that is the case on beta.
---
Goblins are great.
---
Goblins are playable characters are crap.
---
Goblins are saving the entire world and universe from Gods/Titans? Kay. Almost as fucking dumb as Pandas using Kung-Fu to save Azeroth.
---
I'm well aware of how to save gold while leveling. Still doesn't mean you're going to have 100g by level 40 if you're just looting kills without an actual plan to make money. 
---
I've leveled tons of characters to 60. Looting kills and not budgeting spells doesn't cut it.
---
Thanks. It all started with the wetlands run. Then I went under stormwind, went westfall, then decided to go to booty Bay, I was the only one there. Decided I wanted to see mulgore, so I hopped the boat to rachet. Went to mulgore, then decided that I miss old thousand needles, so I went there. After that, I decided I wanted to see the unopened gates, something I've never seen.
---
I don't know, but I see no reason it wouldn't. Or can't be made to work.
---
I mean if you compare it to the life of a night elf then no. I mean they are kinda immortal so what is a year for them anyway?
---
I thought it's a known fact that pservers intentionally buff everything to make game less boring. It was even openly stated in nost manifesto.
---
It seems pretty obvious that we all want one so I agree. I will also be rolling there :)
---
All I need is to have friends sitting on 3 different layers with macros set up specifically to invite me to hop between them at the drop of a hat so I can avoid a gank!
---
In seriousness, though, I think they just need to add a 30 minute cooldown to being able to change layers or something. There's no legitimate reason you should need to layer hop more often than that, and it would fix 99% of abuse cases.
---
if a tauren could hit you in melee, you could hit him back.
---
I think she was in purge. Long time ago my memory is a little foggy
---
This was the plan a few months ago, they have since officially updated the policy to have layering in for all of phase 1.
---
That's what "wrong" with people
---
Dude, you cant just not have anything on the screen for 4 minutes. Make content.
---
You don't speak for everyone.

**WARNING**
---
This user is likely a scammer trying to get people to purchase stolen designs from their fake store. Reddit has a problem currently with scammers posting random t-shirt/coffee mug/poster designs, followed by a post from someone asking where to get it. Someone (usually the OP but not always) then links in various ways to some random t-shirt site, occasionally one that has a "limited time purchase" in attempt to get people to buy from their fake store. The links are occasionally direct links to their store, but I have seen them also post links to Reddit comments of theirs, Imgur albums, and Twitter pages linking to another store. They often target franchise subs, usually ones that have some major title being released soon. Occasionally they will also take an image from the OP that is legit and display it up on their store to sell without their permission.  
---
I highly encourage people to downvote and report these posts as spam to have mods delete the comment and ban the user. They often use multiple accounts to upvote themselves, or post fake comments asking where to obtain it. A good way to determine if one of these people is a spammer us to check their post history and see if they are a relatively new account with little or no other posts. Occasionally they also reuse accounts to spam other subreddits with links which makes it very obvious it's an alt account. Be careful and feel free to spread this word to any subreddits you might see this happening on.
---
Yeah, I recall quivers being visible
---
Hey man, happy cakeday! And yeah, this has me pretty bummed.
---
But did you do it? I mean that's kinda of a romantic roadtrip I guess ..
---
I 100% agree with you - and there are still people every day on this sub - and these people probably drive cars...with other human beings on the road with them - that post some of the dumbest, asinine, and just abhorrent shit I’ve ever heard. 
---
We legit have people complaining that they don’t get to keep their stress test server characters. 
---
We have people that make posts admonishing min/maxers in favor of meme specs arguing that no one can tell them how to play, while simultaneously declaring that min/max guilds HAVE to accept them for raiding - and not seeing the irony. 
---
We have people that argue against basic math - so much so that they will SWEAR to you that the square peg is actually better for the round hole because it’s orange. 
---
We have people that like the female dwarf model. 
---
So, listen, I agree - but do not underestimate the sheer stupidity you’ll encounter which can make even the easiest of games difficult.  It’s going to be an absolute blast!
---
And?
---
Nothing is wrong with it. You only think there is because you've been brain washed into believing that someone being offended is a valid reason to stop some one doing a thing.
---
I disagree.
---
Where did he say that?
---
The Burning Crusade was the best expansion
---
Jesus christ man. The whole point of layering was to avoid the problem of sharding where players pop in and out of existence randomly. Blizzard understand that seeing random new players all the time was bad, so they specifically designed the system to attempt to keep players on the same layer as much as possible so you will keep running into the same people. 
---
Thats why this works and why characters are locked to a layer. To give that sense of the world being persistent. 
---
Layer hopping works under this system because obviously preventing players from grouping up with someone on a different layer would be VERY bad. Imagine a group needing tank for a dungeon, but all the tanks are on another layer. Clearly you must be allowed to layer hop  to solve this.
---
&gt; You don't work with computers do you? 
---
Well you know what they say. When you dont have good arguments, question someones competence instead heh
---
Getting there felt like a year, to be honest.
---
lol. Is this sarcasm? Layering isn't going anywhere, baby.
---
Arcane spec does not have a viable damage rotation/spell.  Arcane missles is too slow of a spell, and scales inefficiently from spell power to function.  So instead arcane is a talent tree that buffs the other two trees.  So Function every mage is some bit arcane, and some bit one of the other two trees.  exception: elemental mage
---
Look at this desperate BfA baby so eager to defend layering lol

I would agree that early TBC was much better than late TBC.

---
No one on this subreddit takes screenshots.
---
Never understood sarcasm where one acts stupid and takes posts literally just in order to make an obvious statement. *shrugs*
---
There are more factors then a dick in the mouth.
---
You charge less means more accounts. There's more room now for botting, Farmers, multiple accounts and spys on realms. Multiboxing shenanigans. Account sell and probabaly some other.
---
By having a decent pay wall you keep most children who cant afford it out, and handi cap people from playing. People will take thier account more serious as the investment they put in was more.
---
What is the benefit of it being dirt fuckin cheap?
---
&gt;If I told you a new game as coming out that took 3500 hours to beat, why would it make sense to focus the majority of your attention on hours 200-3500? There is so much more to the game than raiding.
---
I noticed a couple little typos in your post. Hope you don't mind me correcting them.
---
I'm going troll shaman
---
Ultimate normie experience
---
Lmao. Honestly man - I’m happy as shit it has a $15 a month price. Not only does it keep botting down, but I also get to enjoy the fact that out there somewhere is some internet troll named reapershere that is really mad they didn’t get the support they hoped for on their reddit post and will have to pay $15 to play.
---
If you can heal any kind of reasonably hard content on a holy paladin post wrath, you’ll be able to handle playing any of the vanilla healers, just remember that you won’t really have AOE healing. If I were to play a healer, I’d play a priest for both the benediction questline and the free raid spot but that’s me.
---
lol . Seriously.
---
We are a mixed Balkan +nordic guild with a Hawaiian guy who never had abysmal ping.
---
&gt;Layering wont remove player interaction. If it gets to that point, they will just reduce the number of layers.
---
Are you stupid or something?
---
Oh look. Im getting ganked by this rogue over and over. I finally get away and hide long enough in some bushes for my mate to come over and help me.
---
I invite my friend and BEHOLD. I switched layers and cannot find the rogue again.
---
How is that not removing player interactions? Layering is TERRIBLE for the community.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Class_lore
---
There are likely better lore rundowns in videos.  
---
Most of the class themes were ripped out of warcraft 3.  If you have any interest in RTS games, you can go play that and get a feel for where the classes got their start from a game mechanic perspective.
---
You all are chimping out at this shit, it's the first day of the first fucking time the game has been live.  This stress test is *specifically to test this kind of shit*.  Fucking chill yall.
---
Druids tend to not be very popular due to the low healing they do in raids. Although niche they do very useful healing. Just not the big numbers. And they do offer greats buffs battle rez and a unique playstyle. I mained druid heal during classic and it is honnestly enoyable. Just don't worry about the healing meter. Give that innervate to the priest do your job and your raids will love you so no stress. Also you'll never be blamed if someone dies. That's pretty neat if you ask me
---
Yes I have but do you live bun eu?
---
I wish people here would chill the fuck out.
---
So far the people responsible for Classic have done a great job and they know that layering has it's issues, but they still have TWO months ahead including many tests on the Beta / Stress-test.
---
The people that work on this project want the best possible experience for the players, the layering system is not finished either, they still have time to work on it.
---
If you want to be a negative nancy then go ahead.
---
There are 300 players in the UD starting zone.  Layering doesnt help dont say it ruins anything
---
Has hunter deadzone always been 5-11 yards? I was under the impression it was 5-8 yards
---
Like mining, you out-level herbing pretty early on. There's this taunting Bruiseweed node next to Saldeen's farm in Westfall that requires 100 skill when you have like 25 at best. However, if you stick at herbing for a bit up to like level 30, as levelling slows down you can keep it going if you make sure you go out of your way to get every node you see.
---
I found Tailoring is pretty good, but even that you do have to focus on it as well, unless you specifically levelled yourself on humanoids more than other types of mobs. 
---
I think the real answer is no.. unless your professions are First Aid and Cooking, and even then you can't just ignore them.
---
If it's a choice between layering and congestion, I choose congestion.
---
If it's a choice between sharding the sub-20/30 zones or congestion, I choose sharding.
---
It becomes a non issue after a week when everyone isn't trying to play at the same time and in the exact same level range.
---
Holy fuck
---
There'll be that shammy too so they'll want some leather initially as well. I'm just worried because the Druid is first time player, we're going to be relatively casual, and knowing this guy, I think he's not going to go into bear form regardless of how similar the builds are. I think I'll go with warrior, and he's got the flexibility to do whatever he wants, and I'll just tank or DPS based on whatever he chooses.
---
I love leveling my professions at or slightly above of my actual level curve. It's the feeling of each new thing I make being something potentially useful and exciting. As opposed to leveling them at 60 and feeling like I'm just grinding through a backlog of useless shit.
---
I have already had this experience on 4 different private servers. Trust me. It's two days of chaos after which point you just recall it as a fun and chaotic experience only to never have that problem again.
---
Also nobody force you to play on day 1. If you cant handle the blob of players all killing kobolds at the same time then just start the day after. Or go explore. Or team up and kill higher level mobs.
---

test it yourself
---
I'm from EU and my delay to NC is avg. **168 ms**
---
Yes, but they won't do that unfortunately.
---
Because layering isn't designed or intended to relieve the stress of the starting area. 
---
Layering is to prevent dead/low population servers months down the line. The population will bloom massively at the start, and whither to a more sustainable number over the first few weeks of launch.
---
By having one realm with 3 servers layer on top of each other, it allows Blizzard to merge these 3 servers later when their populations die down. Without layering its possible and inevitable that some servers will just be ghost towns.

Blunty is an aussie YouTuber and is playing wow for the first time ever - https://www.youtube.com/user/Blunty3000.

If they don't fix sharding or do this a lot of people will be quite mad.
---
Guess their thinking is "who cares they will play anyway"
---
This is exacly how I played my paladin from MC to Naxx while I pvpd a lot reaching R10. You gonna have to farm 2 gear sets tho. For raiding all you need is +healing and spellcrit, you will never go oom and will top the healing meters with nonstop flash of light spam easily. Rets the best. Good Luck.
---
Sinep
---
We all agree layering is a necessary evil in order for everyone to play on day one and not to have dead servers afterwards.
---
I agree wit OP, but I also agree with ppl who replied. Seeing how much Blizz is struggling with regular layering I am not sure what you are suggesting (this pocket layering) is even doable. Spending some time in FinTech I witnessed that the reality of technology is much more behind than ppl think. 
---
Watch https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432126733 he was one of the original Leads on the project. They made one whole persistent world. I am no programmer but the whole pocket layering thing on top of what they have sounds complicated.
---
I don't mind layering for the first week or two, but after that they should remove it. I know Ion wants it until the end of phase 1 but that might be pushing it. I think 2 weeks is probably the max that layering should be pushed.
---
The profession Chosen matters. Mining and serving and skinning is made easier with access to mount
---
Layering does not exist to alleviate the stress of the starting areas. It exists to prevent low population realms later down the line. If they wanted to smooth the experience of new players in the starting area they would use sharding for that.
---
I can attest to this whenever I was the offtank in Vanilla I did it with a fury build.
---
Yeah past Darkshire/Ashenvale/Wetlands/Hillsbrad, there probably shouldn’t be layering, but having experienced the stress test, I want as much as possible before then.
---
Ready. Steady. Nope!
---
Screen Captured
---
Merging servers has tons of issues as well they are going to make some people mad anyway.
---
You can't make everyone happy at the same time, they tried and that lead us to BFA.
---
I dont think they can just apply layering to a specific zone or bracket though?
---
Dots no, pets yes
---
I can't commit to two 4-hour sessions a week. I'll just play more than that on my own.
---
Why wouldnt his main be on its own layer tho?
---
The big difference is that lfd changed the dungeons difficulty level. When they were introduced it was the first dungeons where it was possible to aoe everything down even when you had appropriate gear levels.
---
They tried to switch up the difficulty in the next patch (cataclysm) but then they realised that hard content doesnt work with dungeon finder as it promotes people queing up for content that they cant complete. This created frustration and calls for easier heroics.
---
PvP content difficulty is dependent on the other players and has always mostly been random teams formed by queues. That didnt change with cross realm PvP.
---
Layering is a game design solution, not a server capacity solution.
---
There's a difference between what *should* be cheaper and what you personally *want* to be cheaper.
---
It *should* be whatever price the marketing team deems to be maximally efficient.
---
God that is so satisfying.
---
Why would you not just have a friend or guildie invite you? We're gonna see some sick levelong times abusing this
---
It looks pretty but I think there is some dirt on your escape key
---
First aid is great. You’ll appreciate the healing and anytime you just wanna grind mobs humanoids drop more cloth than others
---
Dot DMG does, but the application of a dot does not (until it does DMG)
---
DoT DAMAGE.... YES!,
---
DoT AGGRO.... NO!.
---
aka damage nets the tag but aggro does not.
---
I plan on leveling the same two characters and has the same profs picked out for mage.
---
Warrior was going to have Engineering and Alchemy with Fishing and Cooking as well(first aid a given)
---
When I level I'll just used skinning and mining and just vendor everything for quick $$.
---
Now I'm heavily considering dual boxing the Warrior and Mage
---
After reading the reasons why some people want to power level, I can understand it more. A 50 / 50 split is probably the best ratio. I play casual, and I'm happy that a bunch of people will get ahead of me fast. Makes it easier for me to quest. And likewise, they are happy to leave me behind.
---
The faster the community spreads out, the better. So it's good that we aren't all the same playstyle or same hours.
---
This kid saw her "you cant" and raised her a "bullshit i cant!".
---
Like the loss of player names. Imho that's a big time no no. My characters name is their identity, having to change that would suck royal ass
---
No they are not. Your basing your facts off private servers where they drop too few items.
---
Well, it was just one conversation really. The tech part goes beyond my understanding so i'm not going to pretend like I know anything about its limitations.
---
However if layering can't really be implemented in such a way where its just all over the place instead i'm not really certain of the point of using it. It really wouldn't improve the game if you can't control it. That just sounds like putting something incomplete in. Ill look at that video in a bit
---
That's an insult to TLJ lmao.
---
Cheers! Becoming dad in August and can't decide on class either ;)
---
&gt;You can not abuse it if you don't want to.
---
Were you dropped on your head as a baby?
---
You cannot just CHOOSE not to use layering and that will solve your problem. You have no control over what other players do, and the guy you tried to gank might just shard away before your eyes no matter how fair you play..
---
Your argument is like saying if you want to engage in world pvp in retail, just dont use flying mounts. Meanwhile everyone else is still flying past you above your head.
---
You're obviously new, you'll come around. It might take until phase 2 when they announce layering isn't going anywhere, or maybe some personal gameplay experience ruined by layering, but it will happen. It's a pointless battle, but you have to put what's best for the game first.

Nice. I play on 2 accounts, second one for farming and was thinking of doing a hunter there. I play the second account while im flying, wairing for other group memebers for dungeons and stuff like that. If this works i will level my hunter on my second account a lot faster, i just go to a high mob density area where the mobs are no problem for my pet, put him on agressive and level up like thst even wheb im actively playing on my main account
---
Stop you're hurting me with your words over the internet. :(
---
I don't understand the layering thing, I've never heard of it until the beta.  Is it not just another form of sharding?  What's the effective difference between a layer and a shard?
---
Can’t wait honestly. The RP part is also so fun while baked As Fuck
---
Well, heres the reasoning of the solution. Though apparently the tech part might not be able to support it being used it in this way. A part of what makes classic wow so big is its travel, if you could go to a location then rapidly shift through different "layers" at that location it would go against a huge playing part of the game itself. Abuse of this would take away a part of the MMO, limited access via travel would balance that idea. 
---
Responding to overcrowdnedness shouldn't be easy access as it is right now as the damage caused would be the same as the LFG dungeon finder. In fact, it is a LFG dungeon finder of its own unique problems
---
If it was Rag1,2,3 it would have same name database so you wouldn't lose names/ guild names
---
You don't need to spec holy to heal dungeons. You can heal dungeons specced anyway you like, it is good to have healing gear though.
---
As for professions it depends on whther or not you're on a PvP server or if you care about PvP in general. If you do, Engineering is probably the best profession in the game.
---
What this dude said about hunter, also the pet shit for hunter is a lot of work to do well so even leveling you kind of need to know what you are doing.
---
Lore wise it gets a bit hazy and depends on when exactly the lore was written.  Early wow the "shadow" was particularly illdefined and the light being the opposite of the shadow naturally they countered each other, with the light burning and destroying things like the undead.  
---
Since then wow has kinda of differentiated several forms of shadow magic into void and death magic.  Light is directly opposed to the void, so the two elements naturally harm/corrupt each other, but death/undeath is now more directly opposed to life/natural magic.  
---

---
In BFA there is a now a light-risen undead lore character, so it is now clearly the case that being undead and bearing the light are not out of bounds.  
---

---
In general, Orc is the best PvP race in the game. Hardiness is very very good.
---
.. The character slot has nothing to do with what layer you're assigned to. I'm not defending anything, its just whats been shown to be happening via testing
---
I'd like you to make some arguments about why it's so terrible.
---
&gt;permanent mental disorder
---
Autism isnt real
---
Raid no, dungeon yes.  Sapping, stunning, kicking, blinding, evasion tanking, etc are all important non-dps things that a rogue can do to help save his group.
---
Mob tagging occurs after the first damage or crowd control effect occurs. Pet is treated as the player that owns that pet.
---
By this logic the first version of the first beta we ever saw would be what we're playing now.  If you're determined to just hate it and want to find a reason then you do you, but stop acting like Blizzard is not going to fix anything or change how anything works or that they don't care at all.
---
I'm turning off replies to this so go ahead and downvote/post a witty retort if you must.  Subscribing to this place was a mistake.
---
Rated arena or arena awards weren't so I wouldn't give a flying fuck if they put that in classic it would impact absolutely nothing.
---
Cool down or maybe if you're in a resting area the cool down can be avoided
---
Whats wrong with scarynig?
---
For this toon I'm pretty set on raid healing, I'll be using a warlock for pvp/environment fun stuff.
---
My conundrum is what to play as a healer atm...utility sounds good but after reading these comment's I'm still leaning towards a shaman to be honest
---
Warlock + Pala
---
For some people it's all about speed to 60. Not me. I like to level. I enjoy leveling my professions while leveling. It brings me joy to cap my gathering profession in the level appropriate zones and it hurts me to pass a node and not gather it. Like, my OCD literally kicks my ass if I try to run by it and not grab it. 
---
Lots of posts talk about doing your profs post 60 and I just don't get it. It feels far more efficient to me to do it while leveling.
---
I think you’re thinking too much in to this..
---
When I see them in game I just think ‘oh that’s pretty cool’, and move on with my life haha.
---
Shadow priest or warlock? I’ll be mostly PvPing end game. Won’t have much time for raids (maybe occasionally)
---
Engineering
---
Any other proffession than engineering would indicate that youre a half assed tank/dps.
---
Having leveled a warrior on a fresh server in vanilla I picked herbing/alchemy for my warrior.  It was 100% worth it.
---
I had an endless amount of healing pots where I worked into my grind rotation to reduce downtime, popped when I got an add that might have killed me , or hit when a rogue tried to gank me.
---
I just realised that Obi-wan did not die in the New Hope, he just got layered...
---
What if you are that guildie with enchanting?
---
Oh TipsOut. Yep! Was getting told to hit him up like while I was pulling ahead because I saw that competition thing later on in my leveling destruction
---
People like you are why we have retail. Please stay there
---
What was the purpose of this?
---
&gt;most people who see it hear a “thudding” in their head each time the bouncing structure hits the ground.
---
But... I hear a big and loud cartoonish BOUCNE BOUNCE sound...
---
Amma crazy?
---
Launch was going to be a no win sitaution. I still think think server health is probbaly the most important thing early on but we will see
---
Of all the options (single-instance realms, sharding, starter zone sharding, and layering), layering is the most expensive resource-wise.  
---
The least expensive option is vanilla-style single-instance realms.
---
No, server merges are in effect a **en-masse name change**. It disrupts the guild and friends groups and is often a multi-realm split (i.e. you do not just merger server A and B, rather you close server A and offer people to move to server B, C or D. The number of options depend on the spaces available in each destination server.
---
Server merges are damaging to realm identity. I’d rather they added server queues than had a server merge.
---
Layering is by far the best solution proposed. I am concerned about possible exploits, and the potential for some servers to maintain a very high population, but I believe it’s a better solution than anything anyone has come up with.
---
Apparently, he is not aware that people can be vastly different even if they happen to have the same job or that there are people (Quite many of them actually) that just do not want to mix friendship and work.
---
Unbelievable.
---
I wish my wife would support my desire to buy a computer just to play wow. I even went and got a second job to save the money up so I didn’t interfere with our joint finances. I’m still getting mean looks when I talk about buying a computer.
---
A guild appointed enchanter will have the most lucrative profession in the game. But that's usually one person per guild and it's hardly a recruit role.
---
I think I do not need to. 
---
Looks like I will be lay of from my current job within next  2 -3 months.      But not planning to play WoW all day/weeks/month only. Will be looking actively fro some new job... 
---
Anyway I think this is a bid too much to quit job bcs of some video game ?   I would never do that.
---
Thats all good and well until you are waiting hours to join a bg on a low pop server.
---
Hey, just wanted to say thanks for taking the time for such a detailed response!    
---
I'm excited to play warrior in my group but i was growing concerned after seeing a lot of "you'll spend all your money on re-specs and repairs". I don't plan on being MT in raids anyway and being able to support my friends by tanking dungeons without having to sacrifice what i really want to focus on (PvP) is great!
---
Here’s a few cool screenshots and the vent of our first 4horsemen kill. I remember when DnT finally killed them, and knew it was the pinnacle of vanilla raiding to beat them. No FAIR tuned boss EVER took that long to beat: I have the “sapphiron teaser” that shows that MS paint of their strat. Honestly they got fucked and the fact that they killed 4h first means they won in my eyes.

No armorless epic mounts because they didn’t wanna rush anyone to 60. Sharding through level 60. Merged BGs. 
---
And the game is still 70 days out
---
History always repeats itself
---
Didn't it work the other 2 stresstests though? They started at the same time iirc and were packed from what i heard up to the point where ppl got pissed they couldn't login because of queue's (i wasn't there since i'm from the EU and nighttime for us).
---
I have no clue of what it was back in Vanilla just because I didn't have knowledge of lua/any way to test this back then and wasn't actively testing things like this.
---
I know the consensus was that for nontauren vs nontauren deadzone was 5-8 yards, but I think people thought this incorrectly since the distance for nontauren-to-nontauren melee is technically 5 yards (from player to player ignoring player sphere), and the auto shot tooltip shows that the minimum distance is 8 yards, but they didn't take player spheres into account.
---
this is so fucking stupid, that it might just make it to live
---
If people can hop between layers so easily then yeah it's a problem. I don't know how you could do that though because you don't know which layer you are on. I'm sure the hardcore farmer guys will figure it out and I'm sure that Blizzard will then fix it.
---
Did they ever listen post cata?  They went a good 10~ years without listening.
---
While MoP has a special place in my heart it does bother me that is when they did the whole "fish anywhere at any level and btw if you don't have a pole heres a stick and string that you pulled out of your ass."
---
I farmed the tuskarr fishing pole in cata so im a wee bit upset than i would be otherwise
---
Good old Vasco Digipass Go 6
---
Yeah, well that's like....just your opinion man.
---
I used gold to resub and I'm gonna try an Ironman toon on retail after the stress test.
---
Ideally first you introduce the learning plan to learn to play the game with you. if she passes the test, proposal ensues!
---
Exactly this. These people are getting louder and louder too.
---
I'll be completely honest and say I don't have really any experience on a priest but just be aware that it can be done, even if it's just reserving unneeded blues from bosses for enchanting with your group.
---
your original argument was about warlocks losing head-on to warriors, rogues and hunters. now you're talking about group pvp viability? just stick to a point.

Yeah I wish everyone would stop making those fucking posts already.

WoW is Work. Work.O.Work
---
The sulfuron hammer is one of, probably even the, most expensive craft in vanilla wow. You need 50 arcanite bars and 8 sulfuron ingots (which only drop of Golemagg with around a 10% drop rate).
---
The only comparable thing owuld be the thunderfury quest, which requires 10 elementium bars, which need a total of 100 arcanite bars.
---
fuck google
---
Ha! Jokes on you, my raids were always too busy cross talking after wipes for me to remember that sound! 😢
---
Yep
---
*friends*
---
Every beta deletes ~~character's~~ characters. Standard practice.
---
They won't shut it down...at least anytime soon. They put too much money into it.
---
Alts are Just fun twinks up to 30. U can't have 2 lifes in this world!
---
[I do, sometimes.](https://imgur.com/k4qGtN1)
---
Realistically, how can layering work without it being just like this?
---
The only thing I can see them doing is to force people to go to certain hubs (lets say main cities for example) to switch layers to their friends or at all.  
---
Sadly, that would mean a huge annoyance to the group factor of the game.  Imagine logging out with your buddy the night before in desolace, only to come back the next day, but one of you now has to hearth back to city to get in the same layer and fly all the way back to desolace... like 20~ min wasted time along with silver.
---
Ping times to AWS are useless. Blizzard uses AT&amp;T in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Paris, and Frankfurt.
---
Layering is a global form of sharding. So the entire server is split into different channels. If you're on channel 1 and I'm on channel 2, we can't see eachother, regardless of where we go.
---
dreanor was fulliest bulshit-World
---
That's why it's Rag 1,2,3 so it shares a name database. If you plan on merging servers before you do so a lot of the issues can be fixed.
---
Have you come to serve the Horde?
---
People don't want to accept this is a corporate move and it is for the sake of cost cutting.  It has no real positives to speak of (zones were still unplayable when the stress servers were capped post restart), but only a massive amount of negatives.  
---
It accomplishes one thing, and that is to reduce the server count they need.
---
Dude thats my name aswell..
---
Post history, which is why I used Charlotte when giving him ping times to various AT&amp;T data centers that Blizzard uses.
---
I still can't choose between pala, priest, mage and rogue

If it was older Blizzard, then classic would have been out a long time ago without adding all of these moronic bells and whistles.
---
Gnomes... i like Ironforge. Dwarfes. Even cool Devias Humans. NE. But Gnomes. Gnomes kill the Alliance. Gnomes killed this Picture.
---
What a wholesome addition to the story +1
---
Moon Guard was PvE before the culling.
---
Amazing work man, thank you for taking the time to make this. Much appreciated
---
They don't care.  This is about running fewer servers and saving money.  Loot trading and right click reporting+automatic punishment?  Less GMs.  
---
Welcome to corporate life.  Short term bursts of profit from shareholders means more to them than a long term customer that is seen as a risk.
---
honestly just put layering on in elwynn, teldrassil etc and leave it off everywhere else.
---
Wut? It’s a feral/resto hybrid spec that’s widely accepted for tanking dungeons and healing raids. Not sure who these “people” are that you’re referring to.
---
Wow was the easy MMO when it came out. It's not a hard game.
---
Yeah, should be called something more reasonable. Like Blackplague.
---
Played a hunter way back when in that guild.
---
&gt; Hunter is, in my opinion, far more fun than any of the other classes. 
---
This is true.  I level 3 60s before my hunter: Mage, Druid, Warrior.  My hunter blew them all away in terms of enjoyment.
---
a stresstest is designed to break the system and collect data when it is happening.
---
reducing the cpu power (realms, servers) is a obviouse and normal procedure.
---
everyone flaming about how blizzard cant do shit right is just a complete idiot with no idea about software/hardware testing or salty cause they didnt get beta invites or us accounts
---
This is such an obvious, easy solution...add a cool down to changing layers. Any downsides?
---
They’ve put very little money into it. Maybe a few million. With 100,000 players, they could shut down Classic in January and still have turned a profit.
---
~~see~~
---
&gt;Sight
---
You have no idea if they plan to fix Layering or not.
---
Is WoW classic worth £10/mo?
---
If yes, pay and enjoy.
---
If no, don't.
---
Easy
---
the one u think looks better.
---
What I've read from Blizzard posts, first couple weeks is ideally all they want.  After the in rush of fresh playes fades off, they'll slowly decrease the layers until we eventually have zero layers and everyone on the same server.
---
So if my friend rolls on Rag 1, then I’m a week later and Rag 2 is open but Ray 1 is closed, I’d need to make a character on Rag 2 and wait/hope they merge the servers? In the mean time I can’t play on my friends server.
---
Yea, we don't know what the final count to layers might be. 
---
We do know that more layers will mean less servers, and I think it is safe to say layering being in the game isn't for the players' sake at this point.  They want to run as few servers as possible despite the consequences it will have on the gameplay. 
---
5 weeks ago people were saying they still had over 3 months to fix this crap.  We are now under 2 months leftfor the actual testing phase and it only keeps getting worse every stress test they do.  Now we will have to wait till the end of next month for the final stress test to see what new system they may or may not have in place?
---
Yea, people need to wake up on this crap.
---
I'm in America, idk if it's different
---
Not by itself. We'd just be in cata 1-20, BC/Wrath 20-30, Mop/WoD 30-40, legion/bfa 40-50 and then next expac to 60 or something.
---
It would fix the "deadzone" of leveling now where you don't really see anything meaningful progress with your character for many levels..which admittingly by itself is pretty bad..
---
But it doesn't fix all that by itself.
---
Not enough people are going to quit in the first two weeks to make removing Layering viable.
---
With 100k players, they're making $1.5 million a month... Why would they shut it down?
---
Why is engineering good for dps? Thought it was only good for PVP not PVE endgame
---
I know you didn't ask, but the female backflip animation is awesome
---
That would make a lot of sense actually.

---
I noticed this, too. Did you report it?
---
this saturday a new lights hope private server opens. while im not a fan of private servers at all this could be a good opportunity for what u are looking for. cause not only will u get a feeling for the classes but also how it feels like on opening day with starting zones being flooded by players.
---
BFA is not gud... Retail will get gud in 2020 next expac
---
For as bad and unknowledgeable as he is, Summit1G might as well be a WoW virgin.
---
Honestly, it will depend heavily on how contested the starting zone's herbs are. Herbalism STRONGLY incentivizes you to get up to at least 50, and ideally, more like 65 skill before you leave the starting zones, and if you do so, it can be quite easy to keep leveled (because herbalism node types are spread across zones, so if you have 100 herbalism in a level 15 zone, you can skill up to even higher quite realistically. 
---
If you do have herbalism well leveled, alchemy is VERY powerful at low levels and remains very relevant as you level up. Even out of date elixirs are real power, and as you are filling empty slots, there is no punishment for using them. 
---
In addition, if you are herbalism/alchemy, you can brew elixirs with the herbs you are farming in the zone as you need them, meaning the only bag space it requires is a stack of vials (or two, when you are bridging the gap between tiers). 
---
At level 10, alchemy can easily mean 50 armor, 4 strength, 2.7 stamina, 2 health per 5 seconds, and a ton of minor health potions. That would be like a VERY powerful extra minor armor slot (like a blue set of bracers). 
---
At 30, it can easily mean 150 armor, 12 stamina, 8 strength, 8 agility, 6 health per 5 seconds, and that is a solid amount of stats.
---
I will warn you though, a lot of the valuable potions for leveling are world drops, not trainer. You cannot make, for example, the +8 strength or +120 health elixirs without world drop  (or auction house) recipes, and these are a LARGE part of the value of alchemy for warrior. If you are alchemizing without elixir of fortitude and elixir of ogre strength, you are going to be very gimped for a good 20 levels, because these potions become obsolete MUCH later and you will have to carry around either finished potions or obsolete herbs to actually craft the weaker versions of potions. 
---
Also, to be clear, your buff stacks can get expensive, so pvp servers might be a bit rough. you are still a warrior, so if a competent gank comes along, you can easily lose 4 elixirs at a time, which is not the end of the world, but could make it impractical to maintain your buff stack in heavily contested pvp zones.
---
Seems like you have reconsidered your stance on tauren hunters then, not for the theoretical reason I discribed but because you found a tactical advantage in your tests. Just to see if I understand this correctly, if you run out of deadzone as a tauren male Hunter, and use a deviate delight, you teleport 2.2 yards forwards by decreasing your player sphere by that amount?
---
That's how layers work except you can jump between them so you can play with friends / guildies
---
If we took everyone’s two cents on this subject, I could buy the 15th anniversary collectors edition by now.
---
Also, I think you're underestimating the player base. Even after the rush, I bet at least 500k stay.
---
Wrath in the classic era? Hell no. Fuck LFG-Tool
---
&gt;You legitimately win an item in a premade group and they go around town saying it was reserved and you stole it or some shit.
---
This does occasionally happen. At least on private servers.
---
Usually the people claiming the item got stolen gets laughed out of the chat when they fail to provide any screenshots of the item being ninjaed.
---
Don’t talk shit about my boy 1G.
---
I have had a 60 mage, lock, warrior, pally... Non as fun as the hunter
---
I gave my reasons above. And isn’t not that simple. Upkeep has pretty hefty costs. Probably closer to $1 mil a month.
---
The thing is, if this just clears up in a couple days, isn't that the intent where Blizzard is going to scale back layers once the large rush of players is gone?
---
Starting zones on release weekend (also being a US holiday weekend) are going to be just as much of a shit show.
---
I'll probably be more pissed at this if they keep it going past the first couple weeks after people start hitting 60.
---
Mammothian if accurate
---
No way. Prequel trilogy was a dumpster fire. Watch the Red Letter Media reviews.
---
The biggest test that was done was the STV chest PvP event.  
---
Before it started, a guild did their testing to try and get as many people in what they thought were unique layers as possible before the event took place.  Then when it did take place, 6 of them saw completely different chests with different people fighting for them.  
---
The other is simply by starting an escort quest at different intervals as a basic confirmation.  
---
It isn't that they know exactly which layer is which, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter.
---
Crazy. That's so intrusive and you got treated like a child.
---
He’d probably have a better spec than the ones he chooses if he just closed his eyes and randomly clicked on the screen.
---
Wouldn’t want to play with you anyways as you are obviously a bad warrior ;) 
---
There are situations even while leveling preshielding is perfectly fine and even the proper way of playing. One example is if you are duo-ing with a priest, and the priest is low on mana. If the mobs you are killing are hard hitting, he can preshield. Drink and join the fight when you need a heal or when you move to next mob. This will overall increase the speed you are clearing the mobs.
---
There are a bunch of streamers showcasing how it's done, and they are avoiding pvp/collecting multiple ores/appearing in other side events on a whim. If you can shift in layer at any location with no restrictions, then this will be a option. Notice that I say "shift in layer at any location with no restrictions".
---
Layering if implemented needs to be thought of as a game mechanic if it is put in, and thus limitations on it and how it's used in relation to the rest of the world need to also be seriously considered. If we could just conjure a flight point wherever we are, would kind of destroy the purpose of certain things.
---
Server merges weren't widespread back then though.   Talking less than 5% of total servers with 12 mil people at the end of TBC ended up needing to be merged. 
---
There is no way they can stop dead servers from happening completely... they should just merge them if needed like all mmorpg's do, like the old dev team did for WoW.
---
His hooves will look like cherries, so he is hidden when in the tree.
---
The funny part is that, of course, that wouldn't work. The Tauren is too big and did too little to hide himself.
---
Jumping between then is the main problem. You can abuse it for farming materials.
---
I doubt Classic will hit that number after the first month, let alone the first couple phases. By January, I’d say 200,000 would be a great success.
---
i just think of those boxes to collect in coldridge valley besides the troll huts, or the quest in loch modan where u have to collect parts from the troggs for the gnome
---
Heavens forbid people might want to maximize their characters potential in an RPG!
---
Hey I've read everywhere about this. What exactly is "sharding"
---
No they would all be open at the start and have a set date when to merge.
---
That's how I'll plan to level an alt.  Just level up using only rested XP in my down time on my main.
---
You realize layering ups the total server crap, but simply spreads it across however many layers it needs right?
---
When they reformed the stress test earlier and reduced server count, the game became unplayable again because the servers reached their "layer cap" due to each one being maxed.  It was unplayable WITH layering anyway.
---
I have an idea.  How about suck it up and not care about day 1 or 2 of launch, and then problem solved?  Why are so many people so obsessed with the idea that launch day needs to be as perfect as possible?
---
Sure it does! It explains how layering is supposed to combat the drop of players, not the crowded starting zones.
---
Teldrassil is the level 1-5 starting zone. That's why the initial thing i said was for that specifically. Level 1-5 can be 40 minutes to 2 hours depending on player experience and area density. So it would be logical to make that the most open location for this solution. If (ignoring tech limitations i may not understand) those zones and cities specifically could allow layer shift. There would actually be a time sink cost to shifting layers. This would take away a substantial amount of it's cheesyness that is getting people so upset.
---
But anyway yeah I know a lot of people want to rush to 60 but I really want to try and keep on top of my professions the whole way, even if it means going way out of my way to farm stuff for them, including secondary professions. The little things can make the game way more fun, cool post.
---
Also is your title the wrong way around? "so you can hit 300 with everything at 60"
---
Exactly, which is why the system's negatives far outweigh their claimed positives.
---
Why would anyone choose Rag 2?. They’ll all choose Rag 1 until it’s full.
---
Mages have many elements that involve other people, they're rather fun to play.
---
Making water or portals, having the best CC for dungeons.
---
They are also extremely fun to play outside of raids, tons of abilities to use in pvp, resources and cooldowns to manage while leveling, builds fitting completely different playstyles (aoe frost, single target, fire, or even pom-pyro later on).
---
In raids yeah, they'll get old, especially if you're the 5th mage with no responsibility beyond spamming frostbolt.
---
 Dont worry if blizzard really keeps up with these mechanics there soon will be new nostalriuses, because despite all the paid content creators shilling of how great this will be people will realise its trash game if they keep layering as is.
---
Have people forgotten that layering is only for the first couple of weeks?
---
Layering is a tool to combat crowded starting zones (among other things): https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=288
---
I think you are way over analyzing this. Modern day servers are like 10x better at handling loads compared to 14 years ago. I think west coast is getting 4 or 3 servers? There isnt enough data to show how many of us will maintain playing. 
---
Has what you are talking about actually effected you during this stress test?  3/4 of these dumb posts are about people who haven't even experienced problems with this in beta or stress tests. Let the actual game come out first. I guarentee blizzard has more knowledge and resources than 99% of us out there. So far they are doing their job well in my opinion.
---
It does reduce and sometimes remove immersion, which is kind of something vanilla had going for it compared to every other iteration of the game.  
---
Needing to be in the same group as your friend just to see them is stupid.  You are also a moron for making such an idiotic claim.  Of course it will also hinder player interaction.
---
It explains the first point, agree. It does not make an argument for the second point and they are not mutually exclusive points. Put simply, layering solves two problems.
---
I can hear OP and this. But this triggers my PSTD so much! I'm really looking forward to get corpse camped in STV :)
---
How are they doing this? I know Ian voiced his concerns on people abusing it and said that they were working on solutions.
---
Here's the thing, he never was. Swifty was always considered a "god" by people who didn't (and still don't) know better. Everyone sucked in Vanilla, you just had to make some highlight videos to take off. Once he made a name for himself he started riding the coattails of other good players for arena ratings and even they couldn't carry him because he was such a burden. For such a PvP "legend" it's pretty interesting that he doesn't even have 1 Glad title yet.
---
You’re a bad priest if you run out of mana wanding shit and tossing a few heals every couple minutes.
---
Reddit is so great
---
No kidding.. becoming sad at this point.  Starting to make me wonder if we can even trust Blizzard on these "numbers" they claim they have 100% correct on their end... wouldn't be surprised if they are fudging things all around a bit.
---
It worked for me addicted since vanilla xD
---
No.
---
Warlock has one too iirc
---
He plays Alliance. Targeting a Horde member from extreme distance using a camera bug is the only way he’d survive long enough to spell their names.
---
 imagine having faith in blizzard.
---
Warlocks outperform Spriests both in pve and in pvp, but if you get bored of Spriest you can always reroll a healing spec
---
I would also love to know this. Mines about 8 years old so would be nice to check!
---
Why does it matter?  You are talking 2~ days of unplayable starting zones.  It didn't kill vanilla and it didn't kill TBC (which I would easily argue was far worse).  
---
I know it is hard for some people to understand in this age of instant gratification, but with a little patience you can reap much greater benefits for the future.  
---
Seriously... 2 days and things at least move while in groups.  I don't get how this can ever be viewed as a real problem.
---
If you are like me and like killing invading hordes, redridge is the perfect spot to farm 60's in phase 1. There is always a bunch of shitters trying to kill low levels :)   
---
Also you get a lot of free stuff from low lvls that are so thankfull
---
Fuck me if I don't gz every single guildie in every single level :D
---
It won't be there forever. By the time you make your first alt everything will be as it should.
---
No. They have less mechanics but more micromanaging of specific things.
---
Could you elaborate on how it will combat crowded starting zones? Considering a layer is - supposedly - realmsized I don't see how it will.
---
&gt; A lot of healers would prefer to go ret/enhancement/boomkin. They start asking why the other guy gets to do it and they don't?
---
Would they though? Is this still a thing? Where 'doing damage' is considered more 'fun' than healing? 
---
If my choice were between 'doing damage' but being decidedly sub-par at it and healing and being the best class in the game at it, I know what I'd be doing.
---
The thing you and so many others fail to understand is that once you get out of the starting area, things start moving a lot faster.  
---
And even if they didn't, we are talking like 2 days of launch hell.  Are you telling me people can't wait 2 frickin days if it means the long term health of the game is secured?  Unbelievable man.
---
That is how he is abusing this in the first place lol
---
I'm rolling a Ret paladin, gonna take my time and gonna enjoy it!
---
That's in comparison to mega-servers though, not in comparison to additional separate servers, which is what is being discussed here.
---
If realm capacity is set at an idealised 3k, then the options are either 5 servers with 3k players, or one server with 15k players spread across 5 layers. In this context, layering does nothing to combat in-game quest/mob congestion.
---
However, if you compare 15k players across 5 layers, to a 15k server with no layering, then obviously it's going to help streamline gameplay. I don't think anybody wants to deal with literally several thousand people in each starting zone. A few hundred is fine and fun, but a few thousand is literally an order of magnitude apart.
---
Phantom Menace wasn't terrible though. Merely mediocre. It suffers from carrying the Star Wars branding, carrying a name that demands you compare it to titles it has no business pretending it can hold a candle to.
---
If it were released without the connections to Star Wars, if it was a generic film about Space Wizards, it would have just been a mediocre and forgettable adventure film with some decent special effects for its time.
---
It has very few redeeming qualities but only truly damns itself by trying to rely on a name and brand that it doesn't have any right to.
---
Sorry bro. Cant come tank your dungeon for another 40 min. But gl tho
---
I mean, they explicitly stated it's primary role is to combat crowded starting zones. But yes, it does have this benefit too.
---
Also, according to Mark Kern, the original ideal CCU count was \~1000 per realm.
---
Yes, most of the bosses in classic are just tank and spank. But there are still some more interesting bosses with a little bit more than just tank and spank in the game too. But they start to really appear in AQ and Naxx.
---
Oh, and the first boss in BWL is quite unique
---
Beat me to it. This guy sounds like he wants to monopolise the enchanting trade lol
---
Moron detected.
---
Players will spread out. Not everyone will even play past level 10.
---
Most of MC could be boiled down to “Tank and Spank”.  There are a couple fights with mechanics you can’t ignore, but nothing that a few people can’t take care of for the rest of the raid.
---
BWL is definitely more complex and requires everyone to actually know what’s going on and their specific role.
---
From there, it gets more complicated, but there are a couple fights I guess you could consider “Tabk and Spank”, or at least several phases of various bosses.
---
both are perfect in all ur wishes. 
---
if i have to decide concerning complexity and complexity only, i would say hunter is a bit harder to master.
---
in general there are more raid slots for rogues but there are also more rogue players who want to raid. so it doesn't really matter.
---
both benefit a lot from engineering if u want to pick it up.
---
it really comes down to what playstyle u prefer. stunning someone 5000 times from the shadows or shooting someone from 5000m away and having a pet to annoy healers.
---
They said it could last up to the full phase 1 of content, even saying that it would supposedly have to be gone by phase 2 due to world boss issues.
---
If they deem it necessary, then we might have layering for months, not weeks.
---
It has been like that for people for weeks, that just means you can download the game but you aren't in any of the tests.
---
you're not gonna need a superbeast, keep it in mind.
---
I'd rather have queue times than layering as it is in it's current state. And I have 0 faith that the issues will be fixed come launch because the issues are just a product of how layering works.
---
I use a Logitech G13. Can't play without it now. Only problem is I've had it for almost ten years and they don't make it anymore, so if it breaks I'm screwed! The razer ones don't look as comfortable.
---
I’d recommend hunter based on the criteria you value.
---
I never found out.  I did transmutes for 5-10g but mostly funded my game play by gathering herbs and selling them.
---
I actually prefer layering because I can, and I will abuse it to farm materials.
---
It's a great thing for people who will no-life to 60 in the first week tbh.
---
I try my best not to be stubborn, but be open to new ideas, but after listening to this a couple of times it only seems to prove my point, does it not? Listen from the 4 minute mark, he says he expects a lot of drop off after the first few days, and while they would theoretically have much larger realms than they did back in the day, they won't. Hence the layering.
---
I logged in at 2PM PDT and the Dwarf starting zone was fucked.
---
about 200 people camping wolves, impossible to kill them. All instantly being tagged. Fuck it lets go kill some tro.. nope they're all dead too. 
---
Into the cave, all of them dead, constant streams of people running in and out of the cave trying to murder anything on site.
---
Eventually we just logged off, no point in playing when you can't finish any quest, kill any mob, need split second cast times etc.
---
Like, i'll enjoy playing when it comes out, but fuck trying to level with 200 people in the same zone.
---
If blizzard was smart they would release fresh servers a year or so after Naxx has been out.  Then when those fresh servers have had Naxx our for six months, they release new classic wow content.
---

Dungeons are their own instance, which is unaffected by layering.
---
Why didn't vanilla die without these tools?  Why didn't TBC die despite being a worse launch than vanilla? 
---
I think people are ignoring history and the capacity for a standard person's patience, especially if they already have 15 bucks down for the month.  Of course not being able to play 'properly' for 2 days isn't going to cause people to quit the game.  
---
Server health is such a crap concept the way it is being talked about right now.  So few servers had to be merged back then, and the ones that did (not all, but most) did get merged and life went on.  They can't stop dead servers, even with layering.
---
I can’t tell if you’re serious.
---
Please read the title of the post. He’s asking for advice on paladin specs that can be efficient at dungeon healing and questing, and you’re suggesting battlegrounds and talking about your hunter.
---
SMH.
---
gz
---
This is cool but there's a huge subset of the player population that doesn't go on reddit and is fairly uneducated. Could they skew this data a lot?
---
So apparently on the latest one i saw it being done where people on different layers would invite someone and it would ask if "you want to complete the data transfer" or something like that, then the toon would shift to a different layer even if in mid battle.
---
The two forms of layer transfering i saw was that, and people with multiple toons on different layers, and somehow switching to different toons by logging off then back on and somehow transfering their layer by doing that
---
An old saying: you can carry 20 shitters through MC, 10 through BWL, 5 in AQ (up to twin emp trash) and one in Naxx
---
All you triggered tryhard pserver kids trashtalking about the skill of the player. This is probably going to be the average skill level of a 'filthy casual'. I'd say this is a nice vid for anyone who's thinking of going enh shaman coz it's OMG INSTADELETING PPL EVERYTIME. This is more of a harsh reality.
---
Well then you can be the smart person and chose rag 3 because in a month it would be the same serve anyway...
---
I'd say there are relatively few mechanics but also few abilities to contend with the mechanics that actually exist. 
---
Threat is a mechanic in itself that is very important and difficult to deal with.
---
&gt;Also due to there being a cooldown on the Drangonslayer buff it incentives guild scouts to see when they can get the buff. Then everybody logs on gets the buff then logs of that character til raid night.
---
Removing the CD so people can world buff minutes before the raid fixes this, it's almost like private servers has thought of this like 4 years ago.
---
You do realize most dungeons have a bunch of elites outside that your group need to clear through?
---
I swear all you layering fanboys are braindead at times.
---
Oh yea.
---
I think people are drastically underestimating just how fierce many guilds are going to be with this stuff.  
---
You will have people who want to exploit for dominance, and you will also have people who feel they need to exploit to keep up with those who just want to dominate. 
---
Oh well, if I even still decide to give it a go, I am going to research the crap out of the loopholes and do it myself with my friends.  Even if it helps kill the game, at least I'd get satisfaction over proving a point that so few wanted to listen to during these testing periods.
---
Not exactly 2.55 yards, but approximately 2-2.5 yards yeah depending on the matchup.
---
I didn't realize before that deviate delight had an effect on hitbox. After finding that out, I think tauren hunter might be the best in the scenario that you're properly micromanaging and utilizing this to the fullest extent.
---
That being said, if TBC is ever relaunched, I am not sure if I would be willing to roll tauren hunter if the pre-2.3.0 deadzones are being used as it is brutal in arena since you are not able to use the savory deviate delights in there.
---
You know what I like the most about what I read and see about classic?
---
The leveling will take a loooooong time. The leveling is actually an experience. We will run around without mount feeling like noobs. I will keep that feeling for atleast 200-300 hours which will be amazin.
---
&gt;I am putting a list together for the most scenic fun 1-300 spots in WoW for leveling fishing. i love that you gotta go to specific spots to level fishing as opposed to modern 'skill up anywhere' gameplay of fishing.
---
Waaait .. Are you saying that you won't get skill at some point for fishing in a lower level zone? I seem to remember differently. Sure, you were limited to where you could catch fish effectively, but I think the skillup was just based off of your successful catches (not fishing skill requirements for the body of water you were fishing in). Like I remember just spending hours in Wailing Caverns as an Alliance toon, leveling fishing and catching Deviate fish (to sell Deviate Delight on the AH) ... This was not on launch, but rather after BWL was already in game, but I thought that you could skill fishing to 300 pretty much fishing anywhere (where you could catch consistently).
---
This! This is a major part of my non-plan
---
I think the "take your time and enjoy it" posts are a response to all the "what's the best dps in naxx" and "what's the best dps in pvp" posts from people who haven't played classic before, trying to get people to understand that there's way more to it than endgame. Perhaps indirectly, but I think those posts trigger these ones.
---
They implied it could be the entire phase 1 of content now.  So it is more like months, not just weeks.
---
And here I am, a guy who's been playing since vanilla beta, who's never been banned/muted, and I don't get shit.
---
Random is random, *unless you're a streamer*.
---
I couldn't care less about not getting into the classic beta, but it does sting a little that streamers who were 5 years old when vanilla first came out get instant access just because they stream.  RNG for us, privilege for them.
---
Name them after random mobs / dungeon bosses found in classic...
---
* Devilsaur
---
* Core Hound
---
* Landslide
---
* Patchwerk
---
I fully intend to bore myself to death and level a paladin.  I played one in vanilla and I loved him at 60, as I’ve always healed primarily from vanilla and even today, but my god leveling them is such a slug.
---
Ideal realm CCU is around 1000, the cap was around 3k. Either way, that assumes roughly equal distribution in the world. There's going to be potentially hundreds of layers on launch since all players will be concentrated to few zones.
---
You'd need to create hundreds of subrealms to compare functionality.
---
Hey there! I'm in the same boat as you - I applaud Blizzard for doing a good job. This was meant as a post explaining how and why they're doing layering the way they are, from my perspective anyway.
---
Exactly.  If the game/servers don't lose more people than they gain in the first year, then layering CANNOT be removed in that year.  
---
People don't seem to get that Blizzard's system being removed depends on the game already being on a dying path.
---
Honestly though if Blizz made as much content as they had in Legion it would've been such a great expansion. Classes were really fun, beautiful zones, challenging raids and interesting mechanics. I enjoyed playing WoD, but there was nothing to do unless you were a hardcore raider. And even then it still felt like shit most of the time
---
gz on the ding bud
---
You know there is this system that private servers have found to be the best way to manage high pop, dynamic spawning. Somehow most people on this subreddit think its worse than layering (:
---
You make it sound like it even matters if people level past them.  If they can dominate a market, then gold kind of runs the early-mid game pretty heavily (some might argue the entire game with consumables).  
---
And what if they simply rush to max and then abuse this stuff instead?
---
Suicide run though it, takes some time, but isn't impossible. 
---
Also there's no need to be rude.
---
Shadowglen is the small area for lvl 1-5, teldrassil is the zone
---
They have literally 2 months to fix it. If they keep it in for longer than a couple weeks the entire economy is ruined on every server.
---
Having faith brought BfA, I left during Cata but I hear it's bad.
---
you are basing that on the current player capacity of the closed beta, not exactly a good starting point for your argument.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2sqo0/best_pvp_duo_with_a_mage_world_pvp/). 
---
Queue times will either be several hours or completely dead realms after a month. Pick your poison, I can live with layering at launch if it means the servers will be stable in the long run. 
---
Also I would like to actually play the game during launch not just sitting in queues all night.
---
I remember in Vanilla/BC using an addon called LHCP (LeeroyHillCatsPower I think) and it added on audio emotes for yourself and other folk using it. Our guild used to use it and it'd play that when we'd down a boss.
---
No? You’ve asserted that it won’t but you haven’t made any points as to why it won’t.
---
Serious question (haven't played on the stress): isn't the purpose of the stresstest to have it crowded to see serverloads? Also Will not most people be more spread out once classic launches since people level at different rates?
---
Okay,  but I’m not friends with anyone from work on Facebook. If you’re both playing WoW then you both have to be online and hopefully you know them a little already.
---
The work environment in my company is also far more flexible than in the US in general. If you call in sick then people will believe you and not ask too many questions unless you take multiple days off in a row. 
---
I’m just saying that not every work culture is so strict. I’m even taking the morning off right now to get a haircut and make up the hours later. (Once again, nobody tracks or asks questions unless it becomes a consistent issue.)
---
I'm not sure what your point really is.  Layering is being used to remedy several issues.  One of those is the massive drop in players after a few days/weeks/whatever.  Another is the limited physical space, mobs, and resources in the world (i.e. zone overcrowding).  
---
Saying it's not intended to solve one or the other is just inaccurate.
---
why does everyone say that? im mean yhea, they are easy to level. but both of them have about three times the hotkeys a f.e. frostmage has and need way more skill and knowledge to get even close to the same results in pvp. 
---
hunters have the most complicated dps rotation in classic out of all classes as u have to not clip autoshots and there are two different ways to do that depending on what weapon u are currently wearing. on top of that u have to micro a pet that dies super easily which is a great dps loss and u have to hit ur tranq shots. and u need to pull and kite. and u need to trap in dungeons. 
---
on top of that its not easy to understand hunter pets overall. what pets do u pick? where do u get ur max ranks and how do u work that in ur leveling route? remember u only have 3 pet slots in classic and u have to bring them to a stable.
---
while wls have a easy pve rotation playing one in pvp is not easy at all. being limited on mobility u really need to know about ur positioning. having the right pet out etc.
---
Kansas...
---
But my friends on rag 1?
---
The only "issue" if that world buff timer don't continue to expire while being disconnected 
---
It would be REALLY rewarding if you were getting them all just before raiding.
---
But it's all about -&gt; getting X buff -&gt; disconnect to keep it -&gt; getting Y buff -&gt; disconnect to keep it .... -&gt; go to raid.
---
I keep getting hearthstone ads with the chicken song thing. To be fair to them, it's worked. I haven't played Hearthstone in years and have played a bit the past few days :)
---
I think it was called Titan Panel if I remember right. Was a really cool add-on. Had different modules you could load or leave off depending on what you wanted to track. Gold or xp/hour, cpu performance, inventory monitor, all kinds of useful stuff. Also you could move it to either the top or the bottom of your screen, change the background texture, and adjust the opacity as well.
---
Who cares? Jesus, we get the legacy servers we wanted for year, no changes, just a small function to enable a clean start, that won't effect 99% of Classic Wows lifetime! Yet done people act like the game will be unplayable...
---
How does this take any real coordination? 
---
You don't need to have 6+ layers worth of characters.. you can easily abuse things with just access to 2, and are you telling me you don't think a 12 year old can make a single friend?  
---
Man, pretty sure most hardcore raiders back then were 12-15 year olds, and they are the types who would easily want to abuse this crap lol... I think you are the one that needs to grow up a bit if you think a 12 year old cannot do basic research.
---
A large part of Molten Core is, but anything after that is more difficult/ interesting
---
Any intelligent company will charge the absolute maximum most people are willing to pay. 15 dollars is that number
---
Where have I ever defended layering?
---
I have always loved levelling. I love it slightly less than Vanilla now, but that journey is fantastic. A bit of me is kind of sad when I ding max level cause I know I can't level again on the character.
---
What would be your solution to dead servers a couple of weeks after launch? This is probably one of blizzards main-concerns I reckon.
---
Why should I not be rude? Your proposed solutions are all terrible.
---
You are literally suggesting suicide running through a bunch of elites and having your gear start at 70-60% durability before you even do the first dungeon pull instead of Blizzard just removing that stupid fucking system in the first place.
---
Entitled retail babies already ruin the game before it even release.
---
The mid-combat thing is pretty clear evidence that this will be fixed. I'm sure Blizzard are well aware of it and they are trying their best to come up with a solution.
---
Have a look at this minimalistic MC raid guide: [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-raid-molten-core](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-raid-molten-core)
---
It's not like G'huun difficulty, but still a bit challenging. I think Blizz wanted to have all classes use most of their spells in this raid.
---
BWL, AQ, Naxx, etc. are far more difficult than MC. (in relation ;))
---
I'm talking about how it's not realistic to gauge how warlocks fare against Warriors using a niche spec spec specifically dedicated to beating Warriors. Most warlocks aren't going to be playing that spec because it's not effective in nearly every other scenario.
---
Only phase 1...
---
Shit man I still remember a high warlord spriest on Boulderfist that was able to heal 5 man content with his vampiric embrace alone. He’s the reason I’m going to roll shadow this time around. 
---
Being able to replace a healer with another dps is a huge time saver on things like baron mount runs
---
In terms of coding, you don't even know what they are doing. How they set stuff up. What their codebase is like. Making assumptions like this without knowing anything about the codebase  makes no sense.
---
Tbh we can't know for certain until Classic hits.
---
This has nothing to do with the devs of classic I am sure.
---
This has more to do with Activision Blizzard, the corporation that doesn't want to spend more money to make money.  The corporate move would be to spend less on GMs and less on server costs, so that the quarterly report after classic looks a lot better to their shareholders who they value a lot more than you and me as players.
---
I would be willing to bet my entire lively hood that the devs themselves probably never wanted to do layering to begin with.
---
Do you have any source on this? I've been looking everywhere, but can't seem to find them saying this, yet a lot of people believe this to be the case because they replaced sharding with layering. 
---
Also, during the ClassiCast episode with Mark Kern and John Staats I'm pretty sure they stated the CCU count was ~2500? I'd have to rewatch it.
---
Maximize away, I don't need to hear about it.
---
Yes, I'm not worried! I'll have a good time no matter what they end up doing :)
---
I see, that definitely seems interesting then.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45zz2xzSvaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45zz2xzSvaY) shamans can make gold with the better pvp spec.
---
Honestly, even if it's kinda poopoo, it really captures that wow classic video vibe. Like i legit thought this was someone posting an old video from classic times for a second. I don't know if that's what you were going for but it's definitely coming off like that, a so bad it's good typa thing
---
Add the requirement of needing to be in view distance of the group leader before the layer change takes effect!
---
This would help tackle the issue of people abusing the system every x minutes for things like black lotus farming.
---
It doesn't address the method of restarting the client and using a layer-locked low character, but that method should just be removed entirely.
---
Where'd you get that information from? Everything I've found stated that each layer holds a full realm's worth of players. Nothing to indicate that the number of layers is dependent on the players' locations in any way.
---
Well just arrange with them which one you would take. 
---
If you don't plan on leveling together you won't even interact with them in the first month really.
---
Limp bizkit for me
---
It has nothing to do with being afraid of the servers shutting down. None really thinks of this at all, like the last server that was "shut down" was nost, and it eventually "came back" 6 months later but hosted by a different project. 
---
There are lots of players on pserver that aren't tryhards or speedrunners or anything. When I made my first char on nostalrius it took me 13 days /played to hit 60, we took an entire raid night to clear MC at best, and BWL progression took 3 months. But a lot of the pservers players have stayed around for a couple of years now, and you learn a lot more and start becoming good, things become competitive with other players/guilds, and the best way to have fun in a game you have already completed, is to race for the best timers.
---
There are plenty of things that were added at the end of vanilla that should be there at the beginning. Blizzard knows this, and is putting BGs in the game at release as a result.
---
RP PvP servers where a hidden gem I discovered with way less toxic player bases than pvp.
---
Twisting Nether was great when I finally made the move
---
Didn’t know that, thanks!!
---
You are being told layering is a real actual problem. You were shown a video of layer being a real and actual problem. You go on to dispute that layerhopping is possible despite being given clear and hard evidence of this being the case.
---
So yes, you are defending layering. It's funny you actually try to deny it.
---
You might be joking but there's really plenty of bullshit skills for every class that you should skip and won't need honestly before you're 60. 
---
For instance, as a Priest, 13yo me had no idea, but when I replayed on a private server last year (didn't have the patience to get to 60 on something non-permanent tho), I skipped a lot of skills and saved on gold to have enough for my mount at 40:
---
- Mind vision ranks (lul)
---
- Mind Soothe ranks (even more lul)
---
- Smite ranks
---
- Renew ranks
---
- Dispel ranks
---
- Holy Fire ranks
---
- Mana Burn ranks
---
- Shackle Undead ranks
---
- Lesser Heal ranks 
---
- IF not doing dungeons: Heal ranks too
---
- Prayer of Healing 
---
- Holy Nova
---
- Fade ranks
---
- Resurrection ranks (Rank 1 is enough, eat up munchkins.) 
---
- If you're feeling really fancy you can take Mind Blast ranks and open up with a MB cast before you start wanding, otherwise, forget it.
---
Just shield yourself, dot a mob, press the wand hotkey, and after that you can look away from the screen. I had gold to spare at 40.
---
This is how I too want to go about leveling this time around. Makes for a different experience than pushing for max level as soon as possible (which is fun in its own way, too), and you got me at this:
---
Hope you'll share your list once it is finished :)

@ u/Krgrrr I also have the same feeling that you should be able to level up to max fishing wherever, but that none (or few) chose to do so as it can take tremendously long. I don't quite see the charm in staring at a puddle in OG rather than throwing out a few lines for 5-10 minutes here and there while leveling.

Doing anything like this helps you learn a lot about the game so congratz. Just on first glance I'm pretty sure you can't accept [Washed Ashore](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3524) on blizz-like until level 11. Feel free to compare any steps to my [1-60 leveling guide](https://sage-guide.netlify.com/) and good luck on any other zones you work on as well.
---
We’ve achieved the post complaining about people complaining. Truly productive and meta.
---
Or people could just develop their own imagination and incorporate whatever name they find in game to whatever story they want instead of smelling their own farts thinking generic fantasy names makes them more mature and entitled to their own servers where they can live in their own safe space. 
---
Like Li'lcun't, explorer of the southern seas, born of some Pandaren sailor and a Tauren waitress. So hard.
---
The other 1% is only having it for the first week, *maybe* two.
---
Unfortunately I don't think Blizzard sees it that way. John Staats, former Level Designer on vanilla wow, once said: "it's the casual playerbase that pays for the game, not the hardcore." And the casual playerbase won't tolerate long queue times as much.
---
ur last sentence says it perfectly. it doesnt matter, play what u enjoy the most! 
---
plus for the warrior is ofc that u can tank all the dungeons and u already a 3/5 team needing only 2 more dps. but ur feral can tank aswell even if he is a new player. he will figure it out ;)
---
btw. if u are casual ur shaman friend could look at the elemental/resto hybrid specc. more than enough healing for dungeons and pvp and super fun with all the burst.
---
Because the Alliance exist in WoW to get their asses beat. This comes from someone that started TBC to the first month of Cata as Alliance, and ended up going Horde due to friends. Reluctantly going Alliance in Classic due to my now friend group being limp-wristed ninnies. 
---
The Horde scream, "For the Horde" and the Alliance, in turn, answer in their warcry, "Have Mercy."
---
Red is dead. Lok'tar Ogar. Zug Zug.
---
Ok.. but the entire point of a PvP server is that you can corpse camp people which leads to much greater conflicts as people show up to help both sides. 
---
If you can just ask a friend in guild chat to invite you to switch layers, then that is a clear issue.  Not even sure how this is up for debate really. 
---
And if there is a cooldown to switching layers, that would mean in the instances where you switched layers to play with someone (or grouped with someone random in chat) then it dropped and you wanted to join a dungeon group (or anything really) then you are now arbitrarily locked out because "reasons".  
---
So it fixes your example, but it causes other problems that could easily be perceived as worse.
---
Thank you for this. Easy post to combat all the crying about world buffs.
---
POWER INFUSION!!1!
---
That's inevitable.  I'll repeat what I told a lot of people applying to my guild back in vanilla:
---
The one thing you can bring to a group that dps can't is heals and there's always going to be enough people to play dps for groups.  That said, I was a shaman in vanilla and ended up friends with a couple priests.  They healed and I dps'd just due to that being the most efficient group we could put together with one of them in the group with me.  Eventually I even did bad dps in raids with a 2h because we had more than enough people healing.  Shadow is considerable more useful to groups and raids *as* shadow than Enh is, but you are still going to need to heal/dispel/etc as the fight or dungeon dictates.  
---
Priest is a hybrid class so even if you are shadow you are going to need to be flexible to what the group needs.  Sometimes that means putting on a spirit set and healing a 5man, others that means you'll be spamming dispel for a boss and not doing damage.  Even in PvP you are going to want to tactically pop out of shadowform to support your group.  
---
If the hybrid lifestyle does not appeal to you do not play a hybrid class.
---
Cheers to that! I'm happy the community is so alive and engaging no matter the topic.
---
&gt; why does everyone say that? i mean yhea, they are easy to level.
---
When you have a pet taking the damage for you, less pressure on you to kite is the idea.
---
At highest level of DPS, yes you can split hairs over which ones are hardest, but those are fractions of a percent, and only the highest tier guilds really care if you are clipping your autos or not.
---
For casual players, having a pet is a massive crutch to be able to do things in small groups, or solo.
---
So again, the most newbie friendly, is going to be a warlock, or a hunter.
---
Hunter pets are very versatile, in terms of their abilities, and the types you can get. For a more casual set of players, having the quest of hunting down a rare look to a pet would be fun/exciting, while not caring about the most optimal.
---
As for freezing trap in dungeons, yes it can happen, most people prefer having a more reliable form of CC like a mage. Hunter traps aren't the most reliable, as they also go off of spell hit, instead of melee/range hit. So resists happen, as well they get broken, and have a very long cooldown before they can be reapplied.
---
Gold farmers also massively prefer hunter, why is that? Because they are batshit simple to play and have 75-90% effectiveness out of, even while botting it.
---
Come on. You have no idea what the implementation looks like.
---
I'm surprised you didn't find the early stuff bad; IMO the hardest, most frustrating level band for warriors is 10-20. Mob and quest difficulty spikes, you don't get your DPS abilities or rage management talents until much later, and you lack gear. Good or persistent players can overcome this hump, but I think a lot of people trying warrior won't be good or persistent. 
---
But yeah, your experience speaks to a second issue for warriors: you're going to have a bad time if you don't go out of your way to make sure your gear stays up to date. If you do, IMO the leveling experience becomes buttery smooth after level 20 or so.
---
I switched from the Razer Naga, original and the redesign, to the Corsair Scimitar and love it, definitely an improvement for me.

They talk about the population concentration problem and why they're using layers
---
Altering is changing. Why the mental gymnastics here?
---
It is your opinion that people will spread out, and that most wont play past level 10. Because of your incorrect opinion you’ll call anyone a moron for having a different view. And all because your incapable of understanding the underlying problem that layering is there to fix. Is it a flawed system, yes it is. But the alternative is so much worse and you are unbelievably naive if you think otherwise.
---
The ladies call me Alphavirgin
---
And what if more people join a server than leave for the first year?  
---
OSRS has shown that this is very possible for an old game, and we know that vanilla and TBC gained immense amounts of people every month despite both having rocky launches.  
---
History contradicts a lot of the reasoning in favor of layering, but somehow we are suppose to ignore the possibility that people may just not leave.
---
Exactly. Instanced PvP killed this game. Xrealm just killed it further.
---
How is that quest addon called? Looks very nice with the colors and all!
---
As stated in the post I merely used it as an example. However, I'd need to rewatch the ClassiCast episode with Mark Kern and John Staats to be certain, but I believe they mentioned that it was somewhere around the ~2500 mark.
---
Moronic comments like these are how I know most people in favor of layering never played vanilla, and at the very least never played TBC launch.  
---
If you make it to 20, there would be no problem, even if you were in the middle of the pack.  Just join a group of 5 and you seamlessly quest with no problem.

---
In case you still care, here is a vanilla wow dev stating that world buffs were intended to be used together - making them **not** an exploit by definition.
---
Afaik layering does not exist within dungeons, so this would not be an issue.
---
Grouping in the open world would be though...you couldn't see people you quest with if you're on layering CD...
---
Blew out my speakers when I hit 30 in vanilla. If I have to explain how, I'm in the wrong sub
---
Not having layering in the starter zones is going to be cancer. They said it's going to go away as time goes on and people spread out. 
---
As for the #NoChanges purists, the starting zones will be flooded with more people than ever before without layering. When WoW originally launched, it was plagued with server issues for the more populated realms which acted as a great filter of sorts; there weren't as many people. Remember, WoW was not as popular then as it is now. Private servers had the starting creatures instantly respawn to combat this.
---
WoW's current server infrastructure is so good at the moment that it creates the landscape for potentially the worst possible experience a person can have: Tons of people with limited, trivial resources to compete for. Mitigating this does not detract from the "Vanilla" experience because this is a whole new experience. (Of cancer) Tagging creatures becomes less of an issue when the monsters take more effort to kill, but Boars and Wolves are so trivial that the only thing slowing players down there is their kill rate.
---
They're mice right? The G13 is an extra keypad with a thumb stick. So I use my thumb to move and have my fingers available for comfy keybinds.
---
&gt; Phantom Menace wasn't terrible though. Merely mediocre.
---
Just purely judged on their own merits as a movie, I'm not sure how any of the prequels was mediocre. They fall into pretty much every pitfall that bad movies tend to fall into. Story/writing, acting, tone, cinematography, etc etc. 
---
I think the *only* thing that stood out for me was the music. The sound was good.

This happens to me on retail BFA, 2080GTX.
---
&gt;I don't quite see the charm in staring at a puddle in OG rather than throwing out a few lines for 5-10 minutes here and there while leveling.
---
For sure! I just like to get a healthy start on my fishing skill in the beginning and then spend some time in a few more lucrative spots (like WC as an Alliance toon). This way I can have it high enough to fish any interesting pools/flotsam with the appropriate lure.
---
It wasn't needed for vanilla or TBC launch.  Both launches sucked for the first couple days.  Both games gained immense amounts of players despite rocky launches. 
---
Just deal with the bad launch for a few days, and wow.. look at that.. problem solved.  No layering needed, just patience.  Man, what a hard concept for this generation to comprehend.. patience.
---
Your information for hunters is better than any other channel! Keep it up, the video editing and content will only get better. The information &amp; teaching component is all there man. Just keep at it, you’re doing good
---
What about that sense of urgency when the XP bar is about 4 from the end?
---
In EU we had to pay to join the stress test?
---
5 weeks ago people were saying it would likely be adjusted properly  before July.. yet here we are, we are going to have to wait till next month to see the next build of layering, and then after that no more stress tests and no major testing left.  
---
In reality, they likely have around 6~ weeks before they can't do much more leading up to release.
---
That's ... literally what we want. Why would you want to see that?
---
He should definitely play what he wants to play but you should try to make it clear to him that if he wants to do anything more than be a desperation pick for 5mans as cat he's going to have to farm consumables and MCPs like a madman.  Feral can do decent (hunter level) damage in raids but it's absolutely hardmode.  If he's not ready for that kind of commitment he needs to be okay with offtanking if he absolutely will not heal or he just won't get groups.  Obviously you can form them yourself but people *will* leave your group or you'll get a rep for carrying a cat that isn't putting in the work and it'll be harder for everyone.
---
But again, he should play what he wants, cat can absolutely dps all fights in the game if you do the work to get there.
---
That's not quite true. A lot of bugs I reported in the BFA beta never made it to live.
---
I like it.
---
It works but I think you end up in kharanos instead of the starting area when you die in the water. I think I saw a youtube video from the beta of someone testing this.
---
But something we do know for certain is that layering wasn't needed for vanilla or TBC.  
---
But nah, throw history and logic out the window.  Patience?  Who has that?
---
What is that icon above the chat bubble?
---
It won't do anything towards crowded starting zones because each layer will be the same size as a normal realm was back in the day. Meaning if it can hold 3000 players, and every single player chose to roll a human, the layer would have 3000 human characters in Elwynn Forest. Does that explain my point better to you?
---
High quality shitpost.
---
Man, I remember hearing that post cata... they never did turn things around. 
---
Don't even get me started on D3....
---
Dirty secret, everyone's parents dropped them at some point, usually on their head. I'm sure yours did too. This isn't a post about layering.  It's a post about abusing it. Just don't. Don't support this kinda shit, instead report it as a bug. Ya know... like everyone that's in the beta IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. As opposed to actively trying to make layering as bad as possible by telling everyone on Earth how to abuse it, then endlessly bitching about how broken that same layering is. I'm go a have fun regardless come August 27th, I suggest everyone else try to do so. Or don't, whatever.
---
Layering is not designed to deal with overcrowded zones. It's to deal with overcrowded servers.
---
During 10-20 I was just grinding quests out in Barrens and Silverpine. I grouped up with a priest for a few quests, which was very nice. I did RFC once and WC a few times which helped with gear and XP.
---
I think that's the biggest thing with warriors. It helps so much to group up. Even if it's just with other warrior and not something that complements. It still helps a ton.
---
&gt; Paladins have no tools for tanking at level 10.
---
&gt; Not only do you have to spec 11pts just to get it, it means that you can't really tank properly until level 20. 
---
What does it matter, that they don't have those tools at lvl 10? Yeah, it's a design problem, but one, which falls off later. Deadmnies isn't hard to tank, just wear a shield and go. You do have righteous fury at that point, so you can generate decent enough threat and if you lose aggro it isn't that big of a deal.
---
Because being a great tank at lvl 20 is so very important? The only real effect here is, is that an arms warrior or any druid can tank levelling dungeons, while ret paladins will have a harder time to do so starting at the 30s, where a real tank becomes more necessary.
---
&gt; If you are a new player, and want to tank because you have experience playing WoW in MoP, or Legion, 
---
If you are a new player with WoW experience and didn't read up on the class you want to play, that's your fault. If you are a completely new player, a friendly person, who knows about paladins will likely be in one of your first dungeons to give you some pointers.
---
&gt; To which I said, "That was the goal with Vanilla, but the game literally was not designed to make that feasible."
---
And why isn't it feasible? Becuase paladins have a harder time tanking at low levels? Yes, the lack of taunt means, they are compeltely unable to tank bosses, where tank switches are required and also makes it quite risky to maintank any boss. But prot paladins have their niche in aoe tanking many mobs and that's because consecration is miles better than the druids and warriors aoe abilities. a geared prot paladins consecration will tick for ~60 and generate 90% extra threat, so 114 TPS against every single mob just from this one spell. Thunderclap only hits 4 targets and demoralize barely generates any threat. 
---
&gt; This doesn't even make sense. I mean if your argument is that "We can't give that 8th mage gear because we don't have enough to go around!" then how does that help when you bring a different class, like a boomkin? You've defeated your own argument.
---
Because a different class needs different gear? Boomkins can use leather items with spelldmg, which will get disenchanted otherwise. Elemental shamans can use mail gear with spelldmg, which will otherwise get disenchanted. Ret and prot paladins can use plate gear with spelldmg, which would otherwise get disenchanted. Another fury or mage needs exactly the same gear as the others already in the raid. A hybrid can use different gear, which otherwise nobody would use to great effect. A prime example is the paladin T2. A holy paladin is only interested in max three pieces for the aura bonus. Rets and prots can use the whole set effectively. And a ret with full tier 2 will outdamage your 8th fury, who still carries mostly prebis. It also motivates the main dps classes more as fewer people compete for the gear they want and thus they get items more often.
---
&gt; It's not really too much of a hassle to be honest. 
---
Walking up to the boss and judging the boss every ~35 sec, especially when you are busy healing the raid is quite the hassle. 
---
&gt; If the raid is "full" on Ferals (1-2 in the raid), taking that third will be a dps loss. 
---
Did I ever contest that? Yes, it's a dps loss. So? does it matter? 99% of the time it doesn't. You just need 5-10sec longer to kill the boss. Instead you get less gear competition and you get neat little bonuses. Yeah, you can make arguments, that another battlerezz or another blessing isn't really necessary (you missed salvation for your most important blessings by the way), but it sure doesn't hurt to have that. You don't have to brutally optimize in vanilla and even though the class balance is much worse in vanilla, it's not like you shoot yourself in the foot by taking along a couple hybrid dps classes.
---
Respeccing is cheap at first, but increases exponentially every time you do it. At least it is so on private servers.
---
I hear you but if there's no discussion and people just accept it for what it is, nothing will be done. They need to be aware of the issues in order to fix them.
---
Less Mechanics, more difficulty, in my opinion anyway. You may not need to circle the boss 3 times to put out some sort of fire or something, but tanks in classic actually now need to worry about threat again. Whereas threat hasn't been an issue in about 4 expansions.
---
Aaah I see, that makes a lot of sense actually since max hunter range has always been talked  about as "41 yards" which also wouldn't take into account the sphere
---
I met someone on the wow stress test today who said they were from there... what was your name on the stress test today?
---
It's so beautiful
---
This guy is playing a server where most people are BIS geared because its disgustingly easy to obtain, terrible experience for new players when in full blues :D
---
Destiny has been streaming classic beta and he has never played retail to my knowledge.
---
Raiding isn't too intensive at all for most involved. You can kill most bosses in MC with 15 decent players and 25 others wearing Bloodsail pirate hats. 
---
Even for stuff like MC/BWL the raid hardly need to be decked out in full pre-BiS with the best consumables. 
---
People will want that early on because elitism finds it's way in early on, but once the dust settles you will most certainly be able to find a place to raid given your server doesn't die after the numbers normalize after launch.
---
They know people will quit their jobs or go on long vacations for classic.
---
I will go for something like this while leveling

This assumes layers are filled sequentially, rather than simultaneously, which is unlikely.

I'm going warrior shaman dualbox. 
---
Skinning + mining on the warrior, herb and blacksmithing on the shaman. My idea was to gather while levelling - to get as much gold before 40 as possible so i can get two mounts.

Warrior levelling is slow, but if you dont get the magical 100g before level 40, itll be alot slower

---

---
As for the clip with Ion, if you start at the 4:15 mark instead, my takeaway is that he refers to the inevitable drop off in players, then that they could theoretically add larger realms to combat this, but don't want to do that, hence the layering.
---
Yes and that is good because they are required to make raids succeed.
---
That is getting added to my addon list for sure!
---
Some of us actually spend time just getting more gold because it's fun, even if it is inefficient at lower levels, and even though it hampers leveling progress
---
Dwarf hunter master race represent
---
That's comparing to megaservers though, not comparing to original realm population numbers. The context is specifically in regards to servers with "many more players than... 15 years ago."
---
On the other hand, they've stated that explicitly stated that each layer will have similar capacity to the original servers. (5:39, same video you just linked me).
---
Tanks are often the kind of person that enjoy the RP fantasy of being that knight in shining armor defeating the big evil dragon.
---

Healer matchups? Really? If you're loosing to those you are not wanding enough. Although I could be wrong.
---
A good frost mage is very tough. But if you're careful with lockouts you guys out sustain their damage. Don't let them setup on you with poly, use your dispel.
---
Shamans are not that difficult as a warlock. If you properly totem stomp, in a 1v1 fight there's not much a shaman can do. CoT pretty much nullifies their ele damage and you can survive their melee damage with void out.
---

---
Sometimes people need to remember that WoW is a game about community first and foremost. Without a community, most things at the upper level of endgame play become nigh impossible.
---
Does the player wanting or is playing a unusal spec give other things to the guild such as real life time to help with guild management, loot control etc. If so this person you have to remember is always working in a sense, so is it not right to let them have some enjoyment by pursuing a class they want.
---
A few off-spec's aren't going to wipe a raid, what will wipe the raid are the dps that decide that its a dps race and forget its actual a threat target not a dps race.
---
The reason's supports have fallen out of fashion is they were and still are hard to play and later games completely scrapped the existence of support classes.
---
Any content at endgame is really about having reliable members and if that player understands their off-spec then they should be able to pitch a role that works for them within the raid.
---
For example, I spent a long time in discussion with the core leadership of my guild and community. Explaining how you make ret's work and they aren't a pure dps class - rather they are the support that carries a lot of spellpower and supports where needed, there job is to upkeep JoW/JoL depending on the raid comp. Are off-healers that can step in to support healers or fill gaps.
---
Off-spec's aren't perfect but if you just look at boss damage and dps on a few specific mobs you aren't gonna get anywhere. Raid's, PvP and everything has a larger picture and if you loose that picture your community will shatter when you can't succeed with your min/maxed boi's.
---
It's the superior lock choice for Alliance... Unless you need that rep gain. Sure WotF is OP as fuck, but I can still spank majority of rogues, all I need to do is roll an SL lock. Hell even mages are doableish.
---
Or maybe to pump some positivity into the toxic environments that are gaming subreddits.
---
The second the stun lock was over I could Nature Swiftness + Healing Wave myself to full and start the fight as if he never got the opening.
---
How they are going to disable layering after couple weeks if server has 10k or more players? Pretty sure if they do that it makes server really overpopulated, laggy or other problems?
---
No constant jumping? Is jumping banned on rp servers? I don't think I could play like that, I need to jump at least every 2 seconds

---
Probably because Pandaren were literally introduced as a joke? Google it. Blizzard has confirmed several times that one dev came up with the idea, and it was implemented into wc3 as a joke. I liked MoP, but the pandaren race was literally a joke.
---
They could solve all those problems by removing layering, ez job done.

---
Farming DM East solo was not on my radar back in vanilla. Wish it was. I'd just farm for righteous orbs of mobs in in WPL near the Scarlet area to the north. 
---
Then on my rogue I'd farm fadeleaf and ghost mushrooms or something like that. 
---
I was not all knowledgeable when it came to gold but I could duel the fuck out of someone.
---
I mean, I expect it to be used for multiple things. But it's very obvious they are using it for population control. I mean the current stress test is specifically testing that very thing.

&gt; Modern day servers are like 10x better at handling loads compared to 14 years ago. I think west coast is getting 4 or 3 servers? There isnt enough data to show how many of us will maintain playing.
---
Modern day servers are nothing like servers when WoW came out though. We all played on a single server, today every WoW realm is connected servers that hops between different layers located on different servers. In retail WoW, you literally cannot be 100 people in the same zone or your game has the worst performance in history of video games. That was entirely possible in Vanilla WoW without more than a 2 sec delay.

Phase 1 is pretty damn long. That's the entire leveling experience for lots of people.

At the end of the day you are still just making excuses for not wanting to put in the effort to particpate in the raid, and the 39 other players have to make up for your slack.

Thats absolute fact.

That's really sad
---
Pretty variable in world pvp. Any of those could be good combos with good players.

That’s exactly why we should be worried
---
In WoW you can buy a WoW token then sell it for gold on the auction house. Legitimised gold selling basically, though gold is largely worthless these days. Except for buying these tokens and then exchanging them for either sub time or battle.net balance. One token gets you 30 days or about ten dollars I think. Many people who can farm gold super efficiently basically play WoW for free. It's similar to the system EVE or Wildstar used.
---
I misunderstood then.
---
It's because it was new and sort of revolutionary. Not ideal.

as far as I know, only some get access but only with a active subscription.

Which is odd because that was always the benefit on regular boring sharding.
---
We were all diehard Hordies back in the day so my friends are all going alliance for the fresh leveling experience. I’m for sure going rogue, focuasing in world pvp and running tons of BGs at each x9 bracket. I can’t for the life of me pick a race though. I don’t like humans, and night elves shadowmeld redundancy is maybe something I don’t understand (is it just a default boost to being detected AND you can shadow meld? Or just a boost?)  
---
I’m mostly leaning gnome and dwarf, but dwarf combat animations (eviscerate anyway) look like shit, but stoneskin seems better than escape artist so I’m hella torn.  
---
TL:DR; I’m for sure not doing human, what is the best alliance race for pvp rogue?
---
You make it sound like tens of millions try every mmo and then choose based on difficulty and stay in the easiest one.
---
To get a person to subscribe the person first of all has to know your game exists.
---
Have you ever seen an everquest commercial with Coca-Cola, Toyota, William Shatner, Ozzy Osbourne .....
---
This is why I want to go lock. I love PVP but won't go out of my way to engage in open world unless I have a solid reason to.
---
Then Blizzard needs to explain it to the community in terms they understand. How are you okay with a system being implemented that could potentially have disastrous implications?
---
Last I heard it was Phase 1.
---
IMO, that's reaching hard. They are talking about shortage of resources from overpopulation, to think that only occurs because of megaservers is false.
---
They literally testing population controls in the latest stress test
---
Last time i went for an X-ray, the doctor had me lay on the table and put this thick ass vest over most my body. said "Don't worry its not harmful." as he puts on special goggles and proceeds to go into what looks like a protective bunker with a glass window to watch me as my body gets cancer.
---
Don’t lie. We all know you don’t have a girlfriend.
---
Server costs
---
Gwugnug
---
Same is said about every major beta revelation prior to a new Blizzard expansion.
---
It doesn’t change its spots overnight.
---
Blizzard has already changed the game, and is justified to do so again on this issue. Static patch, loot trading, layering... up next: world buffs. No one can honestly say Blizzard endorses a meta that encourages the opposite of playing the game (how much longer will you have to log out if head turn-ins have an even longer cooldown?).
---
Anyway, all I said was they should consider the issue. And they will.
---
Some felweed in his pipe
---
legion was shit, it's close to BFA in terms of shit.
---
Blizzard have always listened, but they have listened to the vocal minority who weren't enjoying the game, instead of understanding the silent majority who played and enjoyed the game without whining on forums.
---
Remind Me! 69 days
---
No, they don't. They just need to make sure it doesn't have an adverse impact on the game.
---
&gt; Lots of posts talk about doing your profs post 60 and I just don't get it. It feels far more efficient to me to do it while leveling.
---
In most cases it's not though if you're trying to be efficient with your time.
---
Taking smithing/mining for example. You have to actively go out of your way to farm mining materials. You will quickly out-level the zone your profession level is set in, meaning you'll spend time running around maxing out your profession to the next zone you're headed to. This is time you could have spent leveling.
---
You also have the struggle of dealing with mobs around your level while looking for mining nodes. As a max level you will not get attacked or plow right through low level mobs without much concern.
---
That doesn't include that most professions require some level of money sink. You need to spend some money on other materials that aren't dropped and the return on your investment may not be immediate.
---
That money is money that could be saved and used to purchase a lvl 40 and lvl 60 mount respectively, which reduces travel time which reduces over-all play time.
---
Over-all, most professions will take less time to level if you farm them on a level 60 with an epic mount than if you level up in each zone you go through as you level.
---
But that's why I'm looking for other professions that actually aid leveling, not hinder it.
---
Actually it was they are called meeting stones...
---
Can you elaborate on this further?
---
I'm looking mainly to tank PVE. I don't really intend to PVP too much which I know grenades are useful for.
---
Why the hell would you like that change?
---
Beam me up Scotty!
---
N o o n e. G I v e s. A. F u  c. K
---
No!
---
dudes talking out his ass lol. Acting like wod garrisons were equivalent to titanforging garbage in retail right now where u don't even have to do mythic raids to have the same ilvl as a mythic raider.
---
Yeah, this is a made up problem. Server merges are not worse than this. This can permanently cripple every singe server that launches. Server merges are for a fraction of servers that got crippled.
---
Right, that's on me. I've just assumed layers will be filled Sequentially, especially after listening to this person explaining it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK7ezZyeVcI
---
If you listen at the 1:17:08 mark, an IT Engineer gives this analogy: "Think of an 8 ounce water glass inside a 16 ounce glass which again is inside a 32 ounce glass. You start pouring water(players) into the center glass, when it fills up (3000players) it will start to overflow in to the second glass, which in our case will be the birth of a second layer."
---
I have an active subscription, but no access. :(
---
I think you, along with many others I’ve seen in the sub, grossly overestimate the cost of upkeep for Classic. They already have all the expensive server infrastructure to house and run the Classic environment, an environment for a *complete* game. It’s literally as simple as partitioning the space for each specific environment instance (servers we see) and creating the backend structure to handle the load (e.g. layering). 
---
So while there will be up front labor costs to create, orient, and solidify the virtual spaces (including the early debugging processes) the long-term upkeep is essentially nonexistent. Things like ticket handling and the like can be diffused through current overhead costs (the employees currently handling tickets will more than likely just handle Classic tickets as well). It will only become a real meaningful expense after the initial launch phases if they make the conscious decision for it to be: by creating new content for Classic. If they don’t choose to expand on the finished Classic IP, as long as Blizzard maintains the retail servers then maintaining Classic would not have any meaningful negative impact on their bottom line. Even an extremely low estimate of 20k long-term players in the population would easily constitute a revenue stream for them.
---
Yeah it ruined fishing for me when I could just fish whoever I wanted. I worked in the early days on moving up through the ranks in the right areas. Now all you have to do is spend time in one spot.
---
T2 was mostly good, T3 was godly (they finally did itemization right by then). And between bwl and aq40 you could build an extremely potent bear tank set
---
Pretty sure the kids hating on cata are just following a bandwagon. The only shit part of cata was the last raid. Classes were perfect, pvp was perfect, raids before DS were good (firelands was perfect).
---
I want to play a class that can consistently counter mages and warriors (rogues not mandatory but would be a nice bonus) in every pvp setting. I’m between spriest and warlock, any recommendations?
---
Raiding in WOD was pretty good imo
---
Lets assume shards/layers make the early game reasonable enough to level out to 100 by level 15.
---
Is it worth the added time to level along with it? Would you also level first aid along with it?
---
Or is it more sensible to just do first aid and ignore herbalism/alchemy?
---
 ithink you have the beta , because mine is under LIVE  wow classic.
---
"You are NOT prepared!"
---
don't forget being forced to play only 1 spec the first year of legion before they changed artifact gaining after half the population quit.
---
So you don’t want Vanilla, you want your next #fresh server.
---
Dunno why you differentiate them being crap for being playable my dude, they have as much history in Warcraft universe as every other race that's not human/orc. As for the Goblins saving the universe, I never  played past WoD (mobile-game garrison mechanics were the nail in the coffin for me) so I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
What your proposing is as much chaos as the starting zones will be, what happens when 8000 people hit 20 in a week, what happens when that number doubles in two weeks. Your belief that everything will be fine once you hit 20 is flawed because you fail to account for how popular classic might be. 
---
What are the people who can’t play because they don’t have time to wait for an 8 hour queue after hitting 20. Do they move to a new realm. Rinse and repeat till blizzard opens up new servers or do they quit for a year till server population stabilises or do they just fuck off and play call of duty because they don’t have the dedication you expect.
---
Why engineering? I hear everyone saying it's a must for a warrior. But I'm mostly intending to PVE/Raid not PVP.
---
How do you intend to level alchemy without materials?
---
This is not a no changes, this is a very major change that affects some of the most important aspects of Vanilla.
---
A server with broken social interaction is not a Vanilla server.
---
Ah The Force Awakens. Ripped strait from A New Hope 2.0 with a character who goes from not knowing the force is real to mind tricking Stormtroopers and besting a Trained force user in a Lightsaber duel all in the span of an hour. Quality storytelling.
---
No worries, easy to make leaps in your arguments without validating the assumptions you’ve made - good on ya for owning that.
---
They had one of the best raids tbf
---
!
---
I hate you so much
---
&gt;so either Us or OCE
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but NA includes Canada and Mexico and a bunch of other countries? So it's not just US?
---
Pretty much every race that came after B.C. was complete and utter crap for a main-character for the Player Characters.
---
The "chosen one" of the Warcraft Universe is a goblin or a panda? Lol, kay.
---
Yeah that sums it up lmao.
---
every expansion is better than classic raidwise
---
I think you're underestimating multi boxers
---
Sweet, now I can roll a PvP server. All of my problems with getting ganked can be resolved by swapping layers.
---
Here we go. The reason why Cata and all following expansion sucked, mindset community got infected with too. GAMEBREAKING stuff is OK, even NECESSARY, because OTHERWISE it would be ANNOYING for SOME players. 
---
Oh no, I need to spend 20 minutes to group with my friend again? Better fuck the gameplay and immersion for the other 5000000 players.
---
It already does, see monkeynews video
---
legion fun for the first month then complete shit lol. BFA wasn't even fucking fun to level 110-120 because u literally decreased in power as you leveled, what a shit expansion.
---
Its possible and almost assured for streamer servers. However its still preferable to me to deal with that than to wind up on a ghost town server.
---
Also: stress testing in the middle of the week.
---
Mom rouy dekcuf I
---
train boss was hype
---
Back in the day, I played on a German server and had a 'high level' Druid of Level 18 or so. 
---
There was this other Night Elf running past me, and he was called Oceanus, or Loranus or something like that, and I felt like I was handed the golden ticket.
---
I immediately made a new hunter, called him Anusmeister (Anusmaster) and called my cat Anu. So whenever someone gave me shit, I told them 'I don't get it, my pet is called Anu, I'm her master, I'm Anu's maste. What's wrong with that?'
---
Nearly made it to 60 before a GM made me change it.
---
Absolutely, servers instead of shards is a much better solution.
---
Name issues can easily be avoided by using common login servers.
---
unless it's two gathers. No.
---
Some production profs are easier than others though. Tailoring you can get pretty high without going out of your way for it, though it starts to slow down a lot once you get to mageweave as the crafting times start to balloon to around 1 minute per item and it takes a lot of bolts (cloth to make bolts as well) to make stuff in the 226+ range. Also a lot of the best skilling patterns are world drops.
---
And if you took tailoring, enchanting is also pretty easy, since you can level them both at about the same speed, though enchanting slows down sooner than tailoring does as the material requirement jump a lot around, though you also get occasional breather sections where you just need 1 essence to get like 15 points. 
---
I suppose it mostly depends on your tolerance for long spans of grinding. Leveling them as you level feels pretty nice and you can take a break and talk shit in trade while you're bumping up the next 25-50 points once you've collected a bunch of materials.
---
Hitting 60 first and then trying to go from 1-300 feels pretty awful as you're keenly aware of just how slow it is. It doesn't feel as bad when it's broken by leveling.
---
Do you really want to play both horde and alliance? Does this not ruin immersion/faction loyalty for you? Also you'd have to pick a different server if you are planning to play on a PVP server.. For me personally it feels like a bad idea. I'd stick to alliance if you are going to play it with your friends.
---
I completely and absolutely disagree. Raiding was the absolute best part of the game after I hit 60 and found a good raiding guild. Played since late 2004. Raided vanilla all of 2005 until TBC. You’re allowed your opinion, of course, but I disagree. Being in tier 3 and strutting around IF swinging your massive raiding dong is peak mmo flexing.
---
it's beta...
---
I doubt there is millions of players in EU without a subscription waiting to join a stress test, i know we are all hyped for classic but lets not ride the hype train all the way to crazy town.
---
Self inflicted disease.
---
Rested XP, my dude.
---
wpvp isn't a thing that really exists.  What you are asking is what's a good partner for you to 3v1 someone farming.   
---
First off, isn't 2v1 good enough odds?   How bad are you at this pvp thing?
---
Secondly, are you expecting to create moments like on the pvp videos you saw on youtube?  Do you know how many countless hours of dribble they played to get those few interesting shots or how many are set up?
---
Third, rogue.
---
Seriously, for OP and anyone else in this thread with the mobile authenticator, replace it ASAP.  My buddie used his for years and just this summer it finally died.  The process of having it taken off his account, including sending in his photo ID was a complete pain in the ass.  He couldn't play anything for weeks.  Don't want this happening when you're in the middle of classic progression.
---
EU Player here.
---
I downloaded this, could see the servers and the server status, but i couldnt jion, because i dont have active game time.
---
Ironic that you are the one talking about blind guesses.
---
I like to call him Uncle bad touch biden.
---
But the sound isn't even "ding"...
---
lol lfr came at the end of the expansion though with the shitty DS raid, the expansion was golden besides the last part.
---
From my understanding ( which very well might be wrong) this is false. The classic servers that are being put up will only have sharding for the first week or two according to blizzard. 
---
The servers will maintain their player base and will be individual. This is what classic was and what is the ideal goal for blizzard after the first week or two.
---
If you think that the servers that are made currently compared to 15 years ago are the same then idk what to tell ya. Technology has multiplied multiple times since then. 
---
Layering is the overlapping over servers. I don't think that is even a question of currently happing right now with classic.
---
I do find UI mods hilarious. This changes classic.
---
He doesn't want it until the end of Phase 1. He ideally expects to end layering within the first few weeks. 
---
What he said was that the end of Phase 1 is the absolute deadline where layering would have to be removed because Phase 2 introduces world bosses.
---
Hunter, druid or priest for me.
---
Vanilla's population continued growing throughout it's lifetime, the opposite will be true of Classic.
---
That's the big problem.
---
Layering isn't to fix starting zone problems, it's for 2 things:
---
1. To avoid needing massive amounts of servers to handle capacity at launch, that quickly become ghost towns as the tourists move on to other games or back to retail.
---
2. To avoid massive queues if they limit the number of servers to a reasonable amount.
---
Whether or not you think it's worth it to fix these problems is another thing, but if you're going to argue against it, at least address the real reasons it's being implemented.
---
He said "Ideally be gone by the end of phase 1" that's a very broad timeline.
---
Mine work as in if I press the button hard enough the numbers will appear but I recently changed to phone authenticator, I got the original black and blue one too.
---
It’s the same story even if it’s a diff part of the story with a different format. It set the stage for the originals. I’m not interested in watching some clips if you don’t understand something just tell me.
---
shitters is disrespectful.  We called them warm bodies.
---
Play world of Warcraft. Give us all your money.
---
( the spirit healer actually says this if you listen close enough)
---
I want to experience quest lines for both sides. And I think I like the horde better, but the alliance is what my friends will be on. And yeah, being on a different server and not being able to trade items would suck. So I’m pretty torn on the decision rn.
---
nice try to get some karma with your comment
---
How does he know what layer his alts are in? Afaik there is nothing that tells you.
---
Larger castbar is easier to see
---
Interesting blue post about layer population management. Still not really convinced by that argument, because that could very well just be about tweaking their layer population target, and how players are selected for those various layers, possibly based on location. (Trying to make sure that each layer has a similar overall player distribution to the server as a whole.)
---
However, thinking about your claim of 1000 per layer early on, that sounds fairly believable based on what I saw in the stress test. So you might be on to something. Assuming an even distribution of players across all races, that would mean around 250 people each in Dun Morough and Durotar, and that seems about right to me from what I saw. Hard to really tell though, gets hard to estimate numbers once you get past more than a hundred or so.
---
100%, a big fat NO.
---
maga bitches
---
Yeah, not really sure what else they were expecting with this move xD
---
tank and spank means the boss literally does nothing the raid, minus the tanks, has to deal with.
---
We said it for you a number of times - layering is a shitshow, but who cares, Blizzard cummies, am I right?
---
Believe it or not, no, your average player probably isn't particular concerned with whether or not huge queues and impossible to complete quests are good for the longevity of the game, despite that being and opinion anyway.
---
Most people just want to log in and be able to play, especially in 2019.
---
Why can't they just allow you to pick which layer you're on, and give you 1 layer switch with a week's cooldown?
---
If the layers actually gave clear names, it should be easy for guilds/friends to just co-ordinate which layer they're going to play on together. Give the extra switch in case if a mistake, but most people shouldn't even need that.
---
That makes too much sense for them.
---
I would definitely go for first aid. It's very important because the cooldown is half the time of first aid, and because it is no longer practical to make a billion potions of higher level (in fact, you want to make as few lesser health potions as possible, as they use the same (scarce) ingredients as the next tier of health potions, and you can use mageroyal to level through the skill of lesser health potions.
---
but yeah, you definitely want first aid. Vendor finished bandages if you have to to keep your skill at the correct level during play. 
---
And yeah, I think alchemy is actually worth it. Don't think of it as healing, think of it as buffing. After about level 15, that's where most of it's power comes from (and in fact, you cannot really use it as primary health regen because healing once every 2 minutes is not rapid enough, and it also means in any emergency situation your potion is on cooldown. 
---
I just don't know if it will save time for you, as I don't know your skill level (the more skilled you are, the fewer deaths alchemy will save you, as you wouldn't have died anyways, and so it's purely the reduced downtime/faster killtime from your elixir spam, which is tough to quantify. 
---
End of the day, I feel like it's very much worth it for me. I don't know if it's worth it for you, as you could probably easily take 3 times as long as me to level alchemy by just buying the wrong recipes, making the wrong things, and wasting inventory space by carrying the wrong ingredients.
---
The reserve name option is due in August 13th.
---
THIS reserve name is for testing only.
---
&gt; It wasn't needed for vanilla or TBC launch. Both launches sucked for the first couple days. Both games gained immense amounts of players despite rocky launches.
---
Neither of these launches had as large server caps and pressure on starting zones. And yet still, for TBC it was split between people aiming to hit 70 and the players who wanted to play new races.
---
&gt;Man, what a hard concept for this generation to comprehend.. patience.
---
Oh Christ..
---
It's phase 1. Couple of weeks meaning a month or two.
---
They INVITED people for the othet stress tests, now EVERYONE with a sub gets in, and suddenly THIS is a bad idea? Fuck me this sub sometimes.
---
Glad I got to experience real vanilla WoW back in the day.
---
heyyy, good to see a fellow starship trooper in here, good luck against bugs, saludos desde Earth
---
It's way harder to play warlock optimally in pvp than sp.
---
You've shot yourself in the foot with the one thing I've been thining about.
---
"What if there is no dip in players? or at least only a small one." 
---
What if classic is popular and just climbs like original wow? Then how do Blizzard get rid of this without having overpopulated servers?
---
 I sill think it would be better to resrict layering to level 20. By that point the spreadout is enough.
---
legion started shit if you cared about your raid performance and you rolled an unlucky legendary. absolute trash expansion.
---
Last in line for loot and dumped when it’s time for BWL and a serious raid group.
---
The issue with that is that now blizzard is directly competing with those private servers and are going to be shutting them down a lot more vigorously than before, so there probably won't be a lot of new big servers.
---
&gt;I logged in at 2PM PDT and the Dwarf starting zone was fucked. about 200 people camping wolves, impossible to kill them. All instantly being tagged. Fuck it lets go kill some tro.. nope they're all dead too. Into the cave, all of them dead, constant streams of people running in and out of the cave trying to murder anything on site.
---
&gt;Eventually we just logged off, no point in playing when you can't finish any quest, kill any mob, need split second cast times etc.
---
&gt;Like, i'll enjoy playing when it comes out, but fuck trying to level with 200 people in the same zone.
---
How do you fix this then?
---
Just make dynamic mob spawns like on private servers where always a certain amount of mobs has to be present at all times (even if it means instant respawns) -&gt; problem solved. Screw nodes, that's gonna be man against man how it should be. There's np layering or other shit on pservers with even higher player populations than on an official server.
---
I know that?
---
Plus all that karma farming on your alts.
---
Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya!
---
Not true as dots dont tag mobs.
---
Did he just take his shirt off to beat up Donald Trump on the school yard?
---
&gt;Raiding isn't too intensive at all for most involved.
---
Problem is guilds. Look at recruitement post here, people need 3h 3 days a week to clean MC.
---
I think what made me hate the shithole expansion the most was you being forced to play 1 spec because artifact power was a bunch of horseshit.
---
this wouldn't change a thing. These level 1 alts can just stand in stormwind.
---
I think you misunderstood me. What I said was that servers upon Classic launch was made to handle large amount of players. Retail servers are not. They are made to function with layering/sharding/phasing to reduce the stress on the servers, which minimizes costs for Blizzard.
---
The Classic servers could handle 3000 concurrent players on a single server, while Retail servers cannot. They are not built for such load. There is no doubt that Blizzard could create such servers, but it would be very costly and they don't want to do that.
---
What about the post about having 10+ alts so that whenever you play a character it's at max rested bonus? I feel like that one had the approach that is the most alien to me. I like alts, kinda, to a point and I like rested bonus xp, but man making 10 characters to just maximize the xp bonus seems like a bad idea. Youll have a lower /played at 60 but it's gonna take a long time to get 10 characters there.
---
This isn't an opinion.  This is what's happening and why.
---
wod was the best expansion to be a lazy raider. All I had to do was log in and I had everything I needed for raiding. Now in legion/bfa I'm incentivized to play all day every day to raid properly.
---
&gt; This warrior then tops the meters. Now when the loot starts to drop which warrior is going to get that gear first? It will be the warrior who topped the meters  
---
If they use loot council then yes. For most forms of DKP, not necessarily.
---
&gt; Then everybody logs on gets the buff then logs of that character til raid night. So in this scenario there will be people who cant play there character and have to either make an alt or do something else. 
---
What the hell? Where is this coming from? Never knew the buff to be such a big deal in Vanilla. If you got it, great, if not, meh - life/raid goes on. I think you're confusing the majority of WoW players here with the minor super-hardcore-push-for-world-server-first players/guilds.
---
&gt; You can institute a DKP system, which if you look at the guild requirement discord is not the most common type of loot distribution system. Most are loot council. 
---
For the majority of the guilds Loot Council will probably suck. This has been covered previously, but due to there being 40 players and loot being more scarce, this will not really fit any but the most dedicated/hardcore guilds. I bet a lot of the guilds who start out with this will learn that lesson soon enough.
---
&gt; The stated YT videos solution was to remove all world buffs upon entering a raid. 
---
This would make the dragonslayer buff pretty pointless. Well sure, it's nice to get it as level 5 in Stormwind and then pawn EVERYTHING in Elwyn for 2 hours, but seriously - this cant be the intended function for it.
---
TLDR: World buffs are fine! People find too much to QQ about these days.
---
You kept in touch with everybody from your vanilla 40 man? That’s pretty impressive.
---
I understand that its a broad timeline. I'm just point out that at no point did Ion ever say he would prefer layering to last the entirety of Phase 1. He in fact said the opposite, saying that there going to reduce layering over the first few weeks until its one cohesive server. He then says that this has to happen before world bosses are introduced, which would be Phase 2.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;t=401s
---
Going to switch to the phone app,, then. But just out of curiosity, do you know how long he had his physical authenticator before it died?
---
Lol, I reported that exact node last stress test.
---
blizz has no fucking clue how many people will make an account or how many will stick around.  It's complete guesswork.   The character creation 2 weeks early is an attempt to try to gauge this.
---
This sub is hardly indicative of the majority of people that will be playing. This place is literally the last place you should be looking if your goal isn't to see what the best player in your classic guild did when he dropped out of college and moved back in with his parents. 
---
I kid, but only a little.
---
Gods I was authorised then.
---
Think he had it since the Wrath era, or maybe cata? It was a long time but one day the button simply stopped working.  No reason to risk it on your end, better off just getting the phone app
---
They never said two weeks, they said a few weeks and that it would be gone by the time of phase 2 for sure.
---
are you EU? If yes, we are not allowed to participate in this stress test.
---
I mean the error window says it all doesn’t it?
---
He said Classic...
---
Yes, so Blizzard is discriminating? I hope we get a shot next time.
---
This is the current stress test. You need to have an active sub on a **US account** in order to participate.
---
Well I do have a active wow sub.
---
Dude I would happily wipe my ass with $15 a month.
---
Whats the problem, Mommy wont pay for your sub? Get a job. $15 a month is nothing.
---
damnit I do have a sub but it is EU
---
uuuhhhhh... i love it
---
If my goal is heavy progression, do you think it's normal for me to blacklist noobs?
---
Get a load of this shazbot playing for fun.
---
Well yeah technically it does because your server doesn't have enough people to start the second layer, but the technology is still there and switched on and if anyone joins the server past those 3000 you have layering again.
---
Still, Layering is better than dead servers.
---
EU stress test isnt until next month.
---
same as mine and still working
---
Have you selected the account with time on it?
---
$15 does two things.
---
1. Pays staff, meaning development, updates, bug fixes, support, future content and the potential for B.C expansions and so on.
---
2. Keeps free to play assholes out of the game. It also keeps children out of the game. People spending $15 a month to play the game will take it a bit more seriously.
---
Oke thank you for the info
---
crowded servers on release doesn't even compare to the graveyard servers, if they didn't implement layering.  It could very well kill the game.
---
Already found the problem!  The stress test is Us only, I got an EU sub
---
Heh, I meant shut. I have glasses now, so yeah.
---
I never realized before listening to it again like this... it’s a gong being rung.
---
You're out of touch, I'm out of time, But I'm out of my head when you're not around
---
And when they are only half way up
---
Full price would require you to buy the expansions for Retail and also pay the $15 a month.
---
You don't have to buy Classic Wow for $60, you don't have to buy the WoW expansions for $60+.
---
You only need the $15 sub.
---
Your logic is flawed. Get a job you hippy.
---
I'm hoping starter zones wont be that rough if half of the US players think the game drops the 27th
---
I need 40 asses in 40 seats.
---
Look guy, I'm sure in sum storge closet they have a couple of vanilla server from back then stored for shits and giggles.  Are you honestly trying to tell me that the technology of 15 years ago is to expensive and too hard to make now a days?  
---
They only reason that they shard and layer on current wow is because of diminished pops. Not because the server can't handle it. 
---
Better servers wholesale can and are bought by blizzard that are better and cheap than what they had 15 years ago.
---
Is Priest good choice if I want to play mainly PvP healer ? I want to play something usefull and litlle offensive also. I also want occaisonaly raid, but dont want to respec often. Isnt priest playstyle boring ? I played only Wotlk expansion,  I was a druid, but liked priests for their damage and utillity as healers. Dont know about vanilla.
---
Blizzard did the exact same thing in bfa beta and legion beta but you gonna sit here and blindly defend them. People need to put up a fuss so this DOESN'T go live otherwise blizz will just shrug and apologize for it later.
---
Look at Ion this week, they knew classes were broken and bad in bfa beta, yet he come out and apologize for too much pruning in 8.3 a year after launch. Stop blindly trusting blizzard.
---
Your idea gave me another idea regarding the build.
---
Since MS is really a nono in raids Improved Heroic strike and Charge might be really better. I do not know if dropping Deflections is dangerous though.
---
And instead of off-hand damage I could opt for Enrage anyway.
---

---
It saddens me but my next PP farm test will be in first days of July, till then! =)
---
You never came back and in the meantime i tried classes out and decided on sticking to my O.G Huntard!
---
So if you have space for a seasoned Hunter veteran let me know
---
I have a more stale journey to lvl 60, it goes more like “Still not 60.”
---
Back when Vanilla wow was still out this was on the table for blizzard to do till they got bought out by activision.
---
True, but still there will be situations like what I described sometimes. Thus “no rules without exceptions”.
---
That's cool man! keep it up :D i loved the video
---
 There are privates that are P2W, well populated and running for years without any issues. Pserver scene is a shitshow, but people will still play there if blizz fail to replicate their own game.
---
Wanna know what's even worse for the community? 
---
Dead servers.
---
I would try retail wow if I were you! It seems like you might like it more (more your style)
---
Yes, if you compare the servers used at WoW launch, to the ones they use today, their current ones are much cheaper to run and operate, in addition to being built to handle far less load per server, than back then.
---
You can have layering or dead servers.  Pick one.
---
it's nothing to do with fewer servers. Or at least it is, in that if they create 500 servers to distribute the load at launch, and half the people stop playing 3 months in because they cant handle the grind in classic, they don't want you complaining about your empty server and whinging "why didn't blizzard anticipate this"
---
ok
---
And then he blinds you and resets lol
---
You have been disowned by the Horde. Alliance, do with him what you will.
---
More tank and spank than retail, however don’t be fooled, it’s significantly more difficult due to the damage output, coordinating 40 people and concentrating for up to 20-30 mins on a fight in some cases. 
---
Mechanics that are included are simpler, but challenging in their own right for the reasons above.
---
I kinda get it, though. I regretted rolling nelf for my rogue main all of vanilla/tbc. I wished I was almost any other race, even horde. Now that I have a lot more solid understanding of the racials, I’m not really worried but I get the cause for concern.
---
You get in line and wait.
---
If only there was another playerbase that they could invite &lt;.&lt;
---
I think it's dangerous to tell new players to play meme specs. They'll receive so much rejection and if they're below average, they'll struggle even in 5mans.
---
There are levels of cringe, this one has just gone too far and we can't let it slide. It is what it is.
---
Do you guys not have two computers?
---
Yer but I want to dick around and like explore shit too maybe
---
The difference is that blizzard didn't have their own alternative until now. Classic is partly an excuse to squash the vanilla private servers once and for all, now they have a reason to go after these servers and there is no grayzone any longer. They'll most likely shut down any server that is competition with cease and desist claims or win an easy victory in court.
---
Eu stress test is next month
---
This is so pure, I love it. Yes, if you're around level 11 you can make the trek to Loch Modan and quest there. You'll complete about half of the zone and then go to Westfall if you don't hit level 15 before finishing. Savor all of these moments. Sounds like you're having a blast. Throw me a pm if you have more questions.
---
I remember this was actually my first screenshot ever in vanilla wow. I was pretty frustrated I couldn't reach it.
---
our server was small so we just has to drag them along the whole way.  
---
Our first few kills of razorgore we used shamans kiting elites with frost shock and earth bind totems.   Sometimes I'd have a dozen of them running behind me.  Eventually we got to where our dps was just good enough to kill them, but it took awhile.
---
Some rogues were skilled enough and had all their cooldowns ready to beat me...the first go around. 
---
I didn't win them all but I usually won them all in the end.
---
will they actually show the layer at release or is just a beta thing?
---
What mobs did you farm for your linen in Tristfall? I'll be pushing a priest on launch day and rushing a wand at 7 or 8 is going to allow me to farm mobs efficently. I can't otherwise.
---
While I don't agree with the suggestion of a cooldown, you are also forgetting that people do suicide runs naked. Just takes time, not durability.
---
Can't say I'm *enjoying* it...
---
Correct.
---
But then what about flasks, you cant go to the alchemy station on a lv 35
---
I'm just trying to play classic again. From my experience  I have seen the same names of people though out  doing quests from lvl 1 to 10 as of right now.
---
Sounds like classic to me. That's all I care about.
---
[Screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html)
---
I have over 500 days played in WoW and have never once played with sound on. Is that weird?
---
You did MoP dirty
---
/ponder
---
No but compared to Everquest and other MMO's of it's time, WOW was definitely streamlined, user friendly, and far more casual with leveling to max level.
---
Hitting max level in EQ took almost five to six times as long as it does in WOW.
---
EQ was also much less forgiving. If you didn't complete a corpse run your corpse could decay and lose literally everything you had on you when you died. That includes expensive end-game gear.
---
MMO's prior to WOW were fucking brutal, which is probably one big reason why MMO's at that time were not touting millions of subscribers. This was also the early days of the internet where there isn't a video and a guide for everything.
---
WOW was definitely the most casual RPG on the market when it launched.
---
Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean it was bad. WOW took dozens of things that EQ and other MMO's did poorly and made them good. It took things that were needlessly tedious and removed them or improved them. Some of these things were quality of life decisions that made MMOs more enjoyable, but some of it also made them *easier* and more accessible.
---
It also made some great leaps in many areas and revolutionized certain aspects of the MMO industry.
---
But at the end of the day, WOW was a much more casual MMO than MMO's that were big when WOW was being developed/launched.
---
Thanks a bunch! I'm uploading tomorrow at noon. :P
---
It's typical internet hyperbole. BFA is better than Cata in pretty much every way related to PvE content at least (I don't PvP so no clue), especially if you enjoy 5 man content. 
---
BFA had a number of issues at launch (some legit, some blown WAY out of proportion) and outrage culture has only been on the rise since Cata, so it got a lot more flack than it would have in 2010.
---
They gonna quarantine this sub and hide it on google search results now, lol.
---
True but it would be like 1-3 in the morning for most EUs, crappy time selected all around.
---
I feel more like a hunter when I can see my quiver?
---
&gt;The music is EPIC whenever it plays in the background. I really love it.
---
You can enable music loop in options.
---
&gt;I want to go on dungeon raids. Where do I do that?
---
Lowest level Alliance dungeon is in Westfall, the next area after Elwynn, though you'll likely group against Hogger in Elwynn.
---
Speaking of which, it seems you missed the entire western area of Elwynn. The guy in Goldshire sends you there once your level is high enough(I think 8?)
---
Source?
---
I am, but at the same time I'm afraid to be too far behind to find a raiding spot...
---
We've been telling this Blizz for 3 months now, but they don't seem to care.  Blizz better give us one at launch. Releasing them later is nonsense.
---
Maybe don't put the testing behind a paywall? No? Ok
---
The blue portal looks so much better than the green version
---
He says the quiver is only visible to him, not others. Why is that better than the quiver just being visible to everyone?
---
Biden is more buff than I expected.
---
Donald Trump is president. This is a weak avenue of attack against Joe Biden. Maybe make a meme of him as Medivh and him telling the Kirin Tor that nothing will fundamentally change and how no member of the Sons of Lothar called him 'greenskin.'
---
At least it's not Rogue in the top spot now. More Rogue loot for me!
---
So, obviously a lot of people aren’t aware that Blizzard already said layering will only be used in Phase 1.
---
What leads you to believe it would be off?
---
Level 20 is my favorite level, it opens up a whole new bracket of quests and for mage a whole new playstyle with blizzard, blink, better conjure water etc becoming available. You get so much new shit at 20.
---
not a good sign?
---
I hate how pservers implemented dynamic respawns tbh. I really fucking hate it. And on the last two big launches, it could be exploited as well.
---
Me mining and finding a node, it is going to be a lot of relogging back and fort to milk out every single layer version of that ore.  
---
Ore/herbs might be super cheap at the start, so that's a good thing right?
---
It's funny some people take this seriously. To me this is obviously an Easter egg
---
He's curing her cancer guys, relax.
---
Gretta Ganter (https://classicdb.ch/?npc=8508) in Dun Morogh is supposed to sell the Strong Fishing Pole (https://classicdb.ch/?item=6365) but she doesn't.
---
Proof: https://imgur.com/a/kWP60dZ
---
Please fix this.
---
The only way it was exploited was mages group aoe farming i think, rather have that then mages aoe leveling in dungeons lol.
---
To see what kind of load the NA/OC region would be under at launch. Which will not include european players. They'll likely have a EU only stress test too, to make sure the EU server clusters can handle the load from that region.
---
?  How do you get an advantage via grinding?
---
He has it installed most likely. Blizzard added it for anyone with the game installed so they could easily uninstall it
---
I understand this is a joke thread but they do this because they have to perform this procedure many times so the radiation adds up for them.
---
That was because RpPvP servers were released only one year into Vanilla.  The Rp communities were already established on the regular Rp servers and thus RpPvP servers struggled from the very beginning. If they actually don't have RpPvP servers at launch the exact same thing is going to happen again.
---
I've heard you can AoE farm quite well (not as well as with a mage) with Holy Nova spec.
---
Check it out
---
People have said that for every horrible mechanic in previous betas
---
Legion and BFA aren't different in any significant way, it's frankly mind boggling that you put them on literally the opposite ends of the spectrum. 
---
Like you can say Legion is better (and thats probably true) but literally everything Legion has BFA does too. You fell for the outrage memes.
---
You're not paying extra! You get both products for the price of one. They could separate it, but why would they? Not like the subscription would be cheaper because of it ...

---
I tend to lose all sense of proprioception when that stealth noise plays as a rogue approaches, as I flail to escape.
---
They said they'll have multiple regions (incl. EU) stress tests in July !
---
This is great, but it will trigger al the liberal douches' here.
---
Girlfriends come and go.
---
The Horde is forever!
---
WoD was really good, there was just a severe lack of content. Especially, class design was still really good, if a downgrade from MoP for certain classes. But I actually had every class at max level and was playing them all regularly and having fun. Now in BfA, I have one class at max level, I don't like it, there's nothing else that seems enjoyable, and leveling is a huge chore anyway cause there are literally 3 zones.
---
If WoD had M+ and just more content overall, it would have been one of the best expansions to date. It's not fundamentally flawed like Cataclysm or BfA were, so I really don't get all the hate it gets.
---
Also garrisons were actually pretty fun, people just came to hate them cause there was literally nothing else to do. If they were treated like class halls in Legion and the game had actual content outside of them, they would have been a great addition.
---
Rogue is one of the best matchups for shaman. Especially orc shaman. Between Poison Cleansing, Stoneclaw, Lightning Shield, Fire Nova Totems and mashing shocks with self-healing, rogues will have a very hard time though.
---
This is with the 30/0/21 PvP spec.
---
I said layering was garbage since it was first brought up here, got downvoted to hell and back everytime without fail. :)
---
No, this is a dumb idea, just no. Plain no. Full stop no. I'd never join your guild with this idea, ever. Not even as a joke.
---
I'm in the same boat man. My friends want to play Horde but Ive always been Alliance at heart. Considering playing both but I feel like it's just going to force me into picking one of both sooner or later. Esp with stuff like server community and such and being split between two communities just sucks i think.
---
lol that's ridiculous and what I feared
---
With sharding you can for example get 3 black lotus instead of one (pick one switch shard and it's like a different server with another black lotus)
---
I see realms etc. and while trying to conenect it tells me i need an active subscription to play (EU here)
---
looks more like caius cosades
---
They are looking for feedback on how crowded or empty each realm feels. This would imply that they trying to determine the proper population levels for the starting areas. I don't think it's a far reach to put two and two together with the video.
---
Layers are the obvious answer to this, you generate as many as you need to ensure that desired population is matched. Merge as the population spreads out.
---
you need a US subscription
---
Amazing, I can't wait to experience this in August or maybe in an EU Stress test next week? Who knows...
---
I can't have fun if I'm not playing melee warlock. Can I come too?
---
I never understood why most of these start early afternoon PST. I Live on the west coast and work till 6...its like they assume most people work from home
---
Good thing it's been the primary thing that's been in testing for every major test then.
---
I think you underestimate the pressure being put on starting zones the first many weeks if that was the design philosophy. It would be a terrible first experience with the game for most players.
---
I get that the system isn't perfect by a far stretch, but without layering (at least in the starting zones) Classic would be unplayable at launch for the vast majority of players.
---
when there's too many people in one area, the game creates another instance of that area.   The mobs, resources, everything is separate.  At any given time there could be several shards of a given area, and you can only see the ones in your shard.
---
Think of it like multiple groups doing dire maul at the same time.
---
I am still on board with good layering. Easy solution: Don‘t allow layer hops past level 25 or so.
---
Funnel friends lists and guilds to a layer and keep them there.
---
I would never want to group with someone from another layer because I don‘t know, never see or interact with people from other layers to begin with.
---
Essentially turn layers into separate servers with a roadmap for future merging.
---
Wait, subbing now gets you beta? When did this happen? As far as I know they were only inviting randomly people who are subbed, you weren't guaranteed to be in if you subbed.
---
MoP over Cata
---
I'm now stuck between Warlock, fun leveling and Tailoring stuffs, and Warrior, tanking and BS stuffs. I will be making both regardless, but who to main?
---
I had a habit when bored of pushing the button, turning on the screen... I think I may have killed it a bit prematurely from overuse over the years. Haha. Well, it did at least last the seven years they estimated.
---
holy f.. just looked up his age, he will be 77 next year if he becomes president!
---
... Why does legion have such a high score? I guess, I will never understand what made legion so good to many players. It's the addon that made me quit, because nothing felt meaningful anymore. It was the official end to WoW to me. I played BfA for a few months, too and I couldn't recognize how bfa should be so much worse. Seemingly I want other things from wow than most people... I mean the score is nearly as high as the one from Classic. This is awful. MoP was much better to me than Legion. Even WoD was more fun to me. I will never understand why so many people love legion so much.
---
\#nochanges
---
I doubt part of the work contract at Blizzard states that they can be called in for work at dinner time on a Saturday. Remember Blizzard is a workplace like any other.
---
Lmao no they don't. RP-pvp is the nichiest type of server of all
---
You are assuming the exploit will still be around by then.  
---
You can have layering or a dead server.  Pick.
---
Adblocker is your friend
---
Phase 1 will be over a month. The damage will be done at that time.
---
Humans are insanely OP as warrior.  idk why you would pick anything else.
---
how cute lmao
---
How about this variation?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/303250213020105031-05050131005
---
Imp HS for main use instead of MS in raids (dunno if dropping Deflection is a bad idea).
---
And dropping offhand damage for Enrage since I am guessing the uptime would be good and I'd get 25% extra damage overall.
---
Seeing as one layer = one server, it's not a cost saving measure. In fact, industry dimensioned load balancing is really expensive so having two separate servers is a lot cheaper than implementing layering between them and a lot less technically complex.
---
It would've been like 8 to 11 pm, stress test time on first 2 tests was much worse for eu
---
“small”
---
WOW was never really a hard MMO. It's actually fairly forgiving compared to other MMO's that were out during it's launch.
---
Everquest was a hard MMO and was brutal as fuck.
---
WOW is definitely a time commitment though. Most people wont reach end game. The ones who do will be split between good players and dumb-ass keyboard facerollers.
---
Putting together a successful 40 man raid, especially with the later raids, is still going to be a challenge.
---
Much of WOW's challenge comes at very specific intervals. Certain level ranges are far more challenging than others. End game PVE content can be fairly challenging especially if you haven't spent hours studying a guide/how-to video.
---
PVP content is always going to be a challenge due to the human element.
---
&gt;I can’t get over how big everything is. I looked at the world map and I’m in this TINY portion of a continent. I can’t imagine what else is ahead for me. 
---
This hits home. I remember when I first played Vanilla the first thing that crossed my mind is how big the world is :)
---
&gt;The music is EPIC whenever it plays in the background
---
Wait until you get into MC, the music there still gives me goosebumps!
---
The truth is that the Imp's only asset is damage, but Warlocks don't really need that in a PvP encounter, regardless of spec. They need damage *mitigation*. In the form of a CC or interrupt.
---
Think broadly for a moment about how Warlocks stay alive in a PvP encounter. Vanilla is not balanced around long fights, it typically boils down to who can burst down their opponent first while simultaneously waiting for opportune moments to interrupt/throw off an opponent with a CC or spellock. Hence why juking an interrupt is so important.
---
So what CC's do Warlocks have? A 2 minute cooldown Deathcoil that "fears" for 3 measily seconds and Fear, which almost every class can spellock/interrupt or break out of once. In other words, they dont have much.
---
On their own, those two are terrible, until you factor in either a 3rd CC of Seduce or a Silence(spellock).
---
So the tl;dr is that Imp is way less useful relative to a Succubus or Felhunter unless, for some reason, you value the damage over CC.
---
Ui mods was a thing back then in 2005, so no, it's still classic.
---
I only read these comments because it is just so funny to see how sassy or even angry people are towards Blizzard, yet they don't know what they are talking about. Blizzard is an almost 30 years old company - despite the hate they get I'm sure they at least know how to plan a stress test better than random redditors. At least they know what they are actually testing, unlike people here that somehow don't know the difference between a beta and a pre-launch.
---
Good guide but your theorycrafting is wrong at some points.
---
Judgement is not useless and you SHOULD specc into it. It doesn´t "make you lose dps". It does that if you judge a mob as you tag it, as then you´ll need to rebuff seal and auto without the seal on, and most likely lose the double swing from SOC. But you can auto a mob, judge in between auto attack swing timer, and rebuff the seal before the next auto.
---
About 10% strength being useless because it doesn't stack that well: I do not agree. At lvl 25 on a paladin I have 100 strength. 10% extra would be 10 more. 10 is the equivalent of an entire item and intelect isn't nearly as desired at all for leveling: as you said, spirit is even better to regenerate in between the 5 sec windows. Furthermore, the time you'll be in dungeons compared to the time you'll be killing and questing is like 90-10 or 95-5. Going for 10% intelect there seems quite terrible.
---
I agree about POJ being one of the best talents because of all the traveling you´ll be doing.
---
Source: I played paladins in pservers for years.
---
Read some news on the actual blizzard site, it will tell you EU testign is next month.
---
I know they were there. I never challenged their existence. It's a mod the the original UI though, which in itself is a change.
---
If you have alot of vanila knowledge, its very possible to get into a raiding grp. If you have no vanila experience, just forget about it. Its very very hard to play a ret paladin to such a level that people will accept you....  Its cool to have 1 ret paladin in raids, but 2 or more makes no sence, that means you will compete very hard against other ret paladins (all other dps's aswell), if you can be in the top 5% ret paladins on your server; you will have a chance, if you are among the other 95% tardadins; roll alother class :D
---
If you wanna try another alternavite dps, go for feral druid, its way easier to be liked by other players.
---
Holy paladin is not to bad, youre gonna be healing in raids, but you can do alot by yourself in the open world
---
Ooooh hahaha I hadn't been watching his vids. I thought they were classic because of his news video talking about wow classic.
---
Eh, it's pretty universally agreed that everything after Wrath was significantly worse than Vanilla/B.C/Wrath.
---
Cata and the following expansions had massive drops in player populations and received much, much harsher reviews both in professional critic scores and audience scores.
---
Cata barely came close to the pro and audience critic numbers of Vanilla through Wrath.
---
Everything after Cata was even worse.
---
This is ridiculous, really. That comparison is bonkers as well. More apt would be if your wife was a journalist and someone decided to make a voice over for the interview for people to listen to while doing something else
---
Also who said anything about a monetized transcription
---
People all level at different speeds. The bottle neck is at 1-10 when everybody starts fresh. Beyond level 10 people will slow down, some will go much faster than others.
---
As time progresses, 1 week into 2 etc, people will all be over the place in terms of level. Some people who played 16 hours a day will be way further than people who played 2 hours per day. You get the picture. The bottle neck widens over time.
---
Thank god I diverted to part time, quit my second job, broke up with my boyfriend, and yeeted out all my other things so I can enjoy this nostalgia.
---
Maybe he should grab her by the pussy; I heard that gets you elected these days.
---
Yeah I remember how unbalanced was. It was amazing.
---
At least he could still /whisper Luke across the layers.
---
Maybe I misread it. Quivers were never visible in vanilla. I don't think at least
---
Nothing wrong with STV and Tanaris.
---
... If you're not on a PvP server.
---
Oh lawd... Imagine Barrens Chat
---
Humanoids I can think of are the scarlet crusade mobs, they will drop reliable cloth
---
That’s retarded, moving RP server from the “maybe” column to “fuck no”.
---
And you people want RP PvP servers lol. Imagine the griefing shitshow on those servers.
---
&gt; I invite my friend and BEHOLD. 
---
With the way layering works now, wouldn't you only switch layers in your scenario if your mate invited you and not the other way around?
---
With a spriest, lock dps is very competitive. On horde side, if you're not slacking, you'll be threat capped
---
oh god no plz no
---
And if you played from WoD or worse, Legion, you experienced a WHOOOLE other game.
---
the whole topic feels like a bunch of moneys running around a fire trying to understand how it started.
---
just stop all layering beyond 1st zone. full stop. no "we'll see how much stress", "we'll see how many people are there", "depending on performance", or any other crap. 
---
its only 2 rules that must be golden:
---
1- No layering beyond the 1st 2 weeks.
---
and
---
2- No layering outside of elwynn forest, tirisfal glades, durotar, mulgor, teldrassil and dun morogh. 
---
Whichever comes 1st.
---
Ive played on several server launches with more than 5000 people in a starting area. By level 10, maybe 15 people are already spread out enough for it to be fine.
---
"Do you guys can't game at work?" is the message I got lmao
---
Srsly tho, my wrok computer could handle it and I often have nothing to do. Problem is I can't install anything freely...
---
I'd sign up for a year long sub at $29.99 a month for Classic WOW and for you to be permanently banned from all Blizzard games this second if it was offered to me.

WoD was awful, MoP was amazing
---
Get a job loser.
---
Suicide running through elites would work, just unequip your gear and it won't take durability damage. I am proposing a realistic solution to the problem, Blizzard seem pretty dead set on layering and I don't think there are enough people complaining about it to change their minds, no matter how vitriolic your comments are.
---
how do do you know what layer you're in?
---
I have one somewhere. one of the original red/black/yellow ones.
---
Cap servers at 2k for the first weeks. Make an abundance of servers. Merge later if needed.
---
Then there’s no change between vanilla and beta so I’m confused as to why you said you like this change
---
Well if I don't download this I won't be seeing any emotes so that's fine with me. People can spam Pog all they want, got an ignore list waiting for them.
---
Hopefully next stress test will include Europe:/
---
I totaly agree with you! I played alot of druid tanking, raids and dungeons... NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A (skilled) RET PALA IN A 5-MAN!!! xD
---
Lots of good items from engr that a tank wants.  Sapper chargers, grenades, reflect dmg shield, fire resist trinket.
---
cancer weeb shit but was good
---
I see this kind of post a lot and I always find it fascinating. 
---
Some people find the exact same fun and enjoyment in being quick and efficient that others find in chilling and taking it slow. 
---
I don't know why OP and many others think that because that kind of play is stressful to them, it's the same for everyone and those people stress themselves out in order to "be first" or something. No. They just enjoy that. 
---
I give OP the benefit of the doubt and assume he's not like that but ironically there's a very strong underlying current of elitism among the "non elitist" crowd. 
---
*"Oowh, you guys are going to no-life it and rush? Yeaah, I'm going to take it slow and appreciate the content, u-huh"  - Yeah buddy OK, everyone enjoys video games differently, one way isn't more "correct" than the other.
---
No worry, it only gonna hurt 20% of the time.
---
For pve, grenades can still be useful (although not as much as for PVP cc). Also if you plan to tank, the Force-Reactive Disc is a great AOE tanking shield.
---
just mute /ignore all those twitch millenial kiddo's
---
I'm not planning on trying to be a world first. I do want to clear all the content though.
---
I will likely not change my gaming habits at all in regards to how often I'm playing games in general. I will however likely be dropping several competitive games I play (Apex Legends, Overwatch, CSGO) in favor of WOW.
---
I wont be quitting my job or taking time out of my career. But I am going to take a bit of vacation time during the first week just to really dig in and enjoy the game.
---
I'm basically going to eat, sleep, and drink WOW for a few days to really remember what it was like to be a kid with all the time in the world. But then I'll go back to work and continue living life with WOW taking up a big chunk of my gaming time.
---
Nice work man.
---
I sure hope Blizzard is planning for that scenario, even if some players have decided it somehow can't happen.
---
Login queue and free transfers would get people to move, at least.
---
Your still not taking into account the removal of layering at an arbitrary level vs the actual max population of the realm, layering allows an artificial population cap to exist over its actual limit, after a week nobody would be able to log in because the server is full. Why?? Because layering was removed before a stable population was reached
---
The irony....
---
Pls dont let this work blizz
---
first thing that poped into my head when i head the vocals, "(a scene in South Park) Asian penis, so small"
---
Well, to be completely honest, people already don't pay much attention to ads, if they are plain and classy looking most people would hardly even notice them. The whole point of the "over the top" full of colours and stuff is to be visible in the short amount of time they have before you scroll past them. 
---
Not saying I like it, but honestly if they have to make ads that don't intrude they could just as well not make them.
---
Remember guildies saying "up" in the /g for every level up
---
Is it really worth it to level during 1-60 though? I've heard it's pretty expensive and might hinder you getting your mount early on.
---
does anyone except uber rich white people like Biden? i haven't met one person at my college that likes him or Kamala Harris
---
So what? Just have people wait in queue, there, fixed the issue.
---
After this run-in I wonder if she's 
---
still well.
---
10/10 shitposr hahaha
---
They can still fill with the extra buff
---
Aura (improved ret aura, very undervalued for aoe tank suporting) 
---
Lay on hands
---
BoF
---
BoP
---
Off healing
---
Off tanking
---
Bubble (can prevent a death, warriors cant)
---
Cleanse 
---
AoE (not the highest, but still) 
---
This is all reasons to take 1 ret paladin and 5 fury warriors, insted of 6 warriors
---
After 1 second all the memories came, I immediately recognized and remembers the whole video from back in the days.. Great find! thank you. :)
---
Yes I'd prefer that. I think it would offer the best experience for the player since we'd be amongst a static group of players until the merge (which might come within a week). It's more difficult for Blizzard, requiring active management during the first few months, which is why they prefer layering.
---
Don't change your resolution or graphics settings #nochanges
---
it definitely aint a good time for oce. middle of my damn day every time
---
It's not gonna be the same situation. They are expecting a huge drop off in the population, and it's definitely a possibility. That's the opposite of the vanilla/BC population problem.
---
&gt; Humans are insanely OP as warrior. idk why you would pick anything else.
---
I quite frankly can't stand humans sword and shield combat animation. NE's two handed is awful. Human sword and board is awful.
---
I don't think being a NE instead of a Human is going to keep me from tanking Onyxia or MC or Naxx when it comes out.
---
If I was planning on going DPS warrior I'd run a human, but since I'm all intent on tanking I don't feel that the racial difference is going to be huge.
---
Plus I want that tiger mount without having to grind darnassus rep for a week.
---
&gt;fishing takes forever to level. Best to do it alongside cooking after you get to 60.
---
So I know fishing is slow. But cooking is something you wouldn't recommend for the leveling process?
---
&gt;first aid you need for leveling. almost mandatory.
---
Good to know.
---
Probably not as you level, no.
---
"...rarely have proper ad blockers built in from the start" FTFY. Which is pretty much exactly like on a computer, isn't it? I mean come on, the probably biggest ad blocker out there, AdBlock, is available for both iOS and Android.
---
Old pets were the best. You really did bond with pet you played from liw levels to max. It felt great when pet leveled with you and loyalty grew. Now days you just tame pet and it's on max level. I will make huntet alt for sure as they have so much depth RPG wise in Classic
---
There should be no sharding past fucking level 10 zones this is pathetic
---
Was at 5am for western Australia and 7am for eastern states.. very weird times
---
In all fairness, Trump will be 74 himself next year.
---
&gt; I loved the start of Cata. But the endless grind of soon obsolete gear bored me into quitting.
---
I played nonstop from vanilla to Cataclysm and that's what sealed the deal for me. The gear I worked so hard to earn became **obsolete** every content patch. Bad enough when quest gear in a new expansion replaces your hard earned raiding gear, but here's Firelands in 4.2 with quests that replace your hard-earned previous tier!
---
Not sure if this is a dumb question but is a balance druid a better pick for a healer than feral? If you HAD to pick one as a dungeon healer
---
But you'd take it as an endgame profession, instead of something like smithing or alchemy?
---
I’m so glad he’s bringing attention to this. Every one else is keeping is very quiet and it’s shameful.
---
Yes.  If your pet kills something without you doing dmg, then you don't get loot though.
---
Well, actually there is a special sign for this sound in Russian phonetic transcription: [ʌ]. It's neither O nor A, it's something in between. You can google positional allophones in Russian, if you want to know more.
---
From my own experience, there are never enough healers. So any healer you choose will always have a lot to do. Paladin is concidered by many as a top class PVP healer aswell.
---
No they couldn't. Because then they would have to keep opening more and more servers for the demand and in 2 months or whatever they will have to do mass merges.
---
You anti layering people are legit braindead.

A lovely read! Gave me chills all the way, and I can only tip you, the way you‘re playing is absolutely right! You did the things by your own and the way you liked it. In later Levels you‘ll get better and get a good overview on what to do next. But enjoy this „hm, is this right? Let‘s try!“ even if it takes time.

Try retail WoW, you‘ll notice the difference and I can imagine you like it too. It leads you a lot more, then you can compare what fits better for you!

As a tank, 100%.

I'm not going to run a guild again.

Too much work and it might implode, because of guild drama. 
---
Going to enjoy being just a member.
---
I am pretty sure they did but only when bow was not seathed. When bow was seathed quiver was hidden as well.
---
you're welcome! seems like there arent many people interested in pvp
---
I've loved Fishing since TBC, and I think MoP's Fishing changes were great. You still needed to go to different zones for different fish, the non-inventory fishing pole didn't break my immersion (I'm an expert fishergnome, so of course I can craft a makeshift fishing pole), there were special Fishing events, the Anglers' reputation rewards were great, and they added hidden items like the Ancient Pandaren Fishing Charm and four Battle Pets obtained via Fishing. Legion added even more with the Artifact, Drowned Mana, and Fishing Masters. And then BfA made Fishing irrelevant.
---
You idiots, if you don't have it installed, all you see is the codes.
---
U dont know what youre talking about
---
And that's great. Customization is great. The original UI is not some sacred cow that is blasphemous to change. 
---
Modding is a cornerstone of PC gaming, stop trying to pretend it's a bad thing.
---
Thanks for this - one of the better guides out there. 
---
Really appreciate the comments (and discussion) around AOE grind. As a noob/scrub (joined WOW in Legion) I'd already chosen mage for Classic RP/fantasy but was torn with the grind approach. For me, a mage should be about blowing stuff up long before it gets to you. Even if that not the min/max optimal farming method, it's the most fun for me. :-)
---
On a related note - a lot of guides are trashing fire talents before MC &amp; BWL because mobs &amp; bosses are immune / resistant to fire damage. Fair enough, but it's going to be a loooong time before I'm raiding those (if I ever do), so are many other mobs in open world / dungeons immune or resistant to fire?
---
Problem with having say 3 of the same server even if you have shared names, is also population. Say the servers caps out at 3k for blizzlike pop, 9k total on launch. The drop-off of people is going to be gradual so 3k next day 2.8, 2.7, 2.5, 2.3, etc. and when is the merge? If you do it early then suddenly you have a 5k server or something, if you do it late then before the merge you end up with a 1k dead as fuck server before the merge. If they fix layering exploits and fix random fuck ups of you changing layer for no reason, then honestly layering doesn't really seem that bad.
---
my favourite sound is the 'picking up a quest' sound.  It's implanted very firmly in my brain from the first couple of days of playing vanilla when i was 15.  After a while I always had music on and game sound off, until recently when i played again and had the sounds on.  Hearing that noise was like being slapped in the face with a big wet nostalgia fish
---
I was searching for this one since 2017... finally found :). Glad you appreciate this
---
Reee. Reee. Be happy. 
---
We have classic now!!!!
---
Are you straight up retarded? How is merging layers in 3 months any different you absolute mongoloid.
---
And the gnolls but there are a lot of different scarlet mobs so knowing which or if they were gnolls would be helpful.
---
It's really not that strong in bgs if the enemy support has magic dispel bound. They have poor burst and efficiency, so they can't do much vs good enemy healers but mana burn - which is cute but won't win you bgs compared to good damage + support.
---
Not me. I had my fun leveling in Vanilla to the point that I never hit lvl 60, and did not get to experience the epic WSG, AB or AV fights. None of the dungeons or raids.   
---
For me the goal is pretty clear this time. Hit 60 and then start having fun!! xD
---
Cata was a total failiure and utter garbage.
---
The world is also secretly flat, the scientist are just lying to everyone for their own greed and profit! - this guy probably
---
That might satisfy you, it will not satisfy the majority of the player base
---
even with layering it is inevitable that certain servers will become ghost towns, while other servers will remain popular destination servers for new players... layering is just pushing the design problems a game like classic wow brings to the table to back to phase 2 while compounding the issue with the brand new problem that abusing layers brings to the table.
---
Jesus you guys are sensitive. Just look.
---
 Every private server that is somewhat relevant got that letter, Nostalrius reacted to it and shut down, many others didnt. There are wow privates that make tons of money and being ran for years with open cash shops, blizzard wont be able to do shit to servers hosted in russia.
---
I think neither the streamer culture nor the majority of those players will stick around, to be honest. Maybe just wishful thinking.
---
You can abuse that guys dumb idea too...  Just play on rag3 and no one will be there.   Farm up like a mad man, and then when the servers merge, u r rich.
---
Yeah looks good my man.
---
They will be widespread this time around because of tourists. When 60 percent of the player base is going to log on for less than a month, and half the servers die or need to be merged, you might finally regret not thinking.
---
Seems stupid. Good thing I don't PvP.
---
" I would never want to group with someone from another layer because I don‘t know, never see or interact with people from other layers to begin with. "  
---
So you want to play a MMORPG game where you don't see the majority of the players on your server? If a private server can handle 14k concurrent players online without a problem, I cannot see why blizzards servers couldn't do the same.
---
Liberal douche here: I found OP's shitpost amusing.
---
Toggle autoloot with this.
---
/click InterfaceOptionsControlsPanelAutoLootCorpse
---
Seems like every man and their dog is chopping up streamers vods and poorly photoshopping thumbnails, then passing it off as “content”.
---
Think of the legacy you’re leaving, imagine civilisation as we know it ends tomorrow, what would future archeologists think unearthing YouTube’s servers and finding the supposed “repository of human knowledge” is actually just millions of hours of this garbage. 
---
I can see the headlines now “Ancient Repository of human knowledge found - turns out they were all retarded”.
---
Personally, I think this was their original plan. First, have people slam multiple servers all at once at 5 pm, making characters and logging in. After a bit, send this message and force people to ALL AT ONCE recreate their characters .... purposefully creating a much greater bottleneck than just opening with fewer servers at 5 (where people are more likely to just trickle in with it being during work hours).
---
Yes, I do. You can't even spell so I'm really confident your knowledge of industry sized server load balancing isn't really up to snuff either.
---
&gt; If you think that the servers that are made currently compared to 15 years ago are the same then idk what to tell ya. Technology has multiplied multiple times since then.
---
You're right about technology but [Blizzard's implementation seems to be flawed](https://youtu.be/h5wRRBPWYG4?t=322) and that is probably what LookAFlyingCrane is referring to.
---
I'd say an Ele Shammy or a Shadow Priest. Someone who can do good damage too, but can also pop some heals if need be!
---
It's literally a keybind option to mark target.
---
Turned off, cant stand The music
---
I don't get how people can give so much praise to legion yet in the same breathe call BFA legion 2.0
---
Neither. 
---
Plan ahead. Make a cluster of server segments that all share a name pool. Each segment has 3k active cap. Merge the segments together as needed.
---
Iv been using a sheep macro that marks the target with a star since TBC. Not being near my computer I can’t give you the code but it should be possible.
---
Yeah, the music is special, but the whole trailer show the epic adventure that await us :)
---
Vanilla didn’t launch on day one with 10 million people jumping into the staring zones, it was a slow build. 
---
I’m not sure where you are getting the ‘shit for 2 days idea’ but as a rogue it was literally impossible to tag a mob in elwyn forest, gonna be more like 2 months if you have to level like that.
---
I got to find me that realm hosted in Boston wonder how I will know lol
---
&gt; WoD was really good, there was just a severe lack of content. Especially, class design was still really good, if a downgrade from MoP for certain classes. But I actually had every class at max level and was playing them all regularly and having fun. Now in BfA, I have one class at max level, I don't like it, there's nothing else that seems enjoyable, and leveling is a huge chore anyway cause there are literally 3 zones.
---
If WoD had M+ and just more content overall, it would have been one of the best expansions to date. It wasn't fundamentally flawed like Cataclysm or BfA were, so I really don't get all the hate it gets.
---
I agree with you! The raids were awesome quality too. If only we had two more raids or so plus M+, and PvP coulda been a bit better but hey. WoD coulda been so GOOD
---
MC is defo a tank and spank  raid, with a few quirky fights.   But BWL / AQ40 are defo not tank and spank, the fights all have different mechanic and need players to know what they are doing. Some of the trash in AQ40, especially this damn meteor guys, so a raid can carry less average players.
---
Anyone else glad they don't have enough players since they shafted EU and others?
---
You expect entire systems to get overhauled in 2 months right? You have no idea how game-development and developmental cycles work, do you now?
---
Man, I sat on 50MB/s HDDs for like 10 years and just last year took the leap to M2 NVME. Holy shit I felt loadscreens zoom.
---
&gt; Then there are some concerns with what happens after the layering is removed should literally none quit the game early on. 
---
This scenario will 100% NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
---
Your ignorance on the subject is astounding. Let me enlighten you, and all those like you, who are absolutely out of touch with how a Classic realm will actually work.
---
First, you have to understand the difference between concurrent players and total players, per realm. This subject, somehow, eludes A LOT of people. Everyone KNOWS the difference...but because they are ignorant (ignorance means lack of information - calling someone ignorant is not a an offense) , they don't understand how thing work.
---
The layering purpose is EXACTLY what Blizzard is saying : to combat the initial overcrowding AND to ensure a healthy realm population after the tourist wave leaves. Every single ignorant, like you, is missing the SECOND part, and always comes up with the first part.
---
Now, a Vanilla realm, back in the day had a medium number of total ACTIVE players of 11,000. There were almost 700 realms , worldwide, for 7.5-7.6 million total ACTIVE players. The concurrent players number was between 20% and 30% of the total active players population, so between 2,000-ish to 3,000-ish.
---
With Classic, during the first 24 hours, the concurrent players will be pretty much equal to the total players. Everyone and their cat will log in the first 48 hours. Keep this in mind, for later.
---
Nostalrius data is (almost) irrelevant. There won't be a 80% drop in Classic. It will be much less than 80%. Why? Well, simply because a lot of people that played on Nostalrius were driven away by the MASSIVE amount of concurrent players. During the first days, Nostalrius concurrent player number was around 20,000 people, and in the first few weeks, over 15,000. That is enough, for a Vanilla realm, to discourage every single casual player. The casual player image would be that they will need TOO MUCH TIME to do anything relevant, when the competition is simply too big for them.
---
The second reason is that the casual player on Nostalrius was aware that he will fall behind, A LOT, because not only his time was limited...but whenever he was logged on, EVERYONE ELSE was, and his leveling speed was slower than a snail's.
---
No wonder 80% of Nost players at launch quit before lvl 20.
---
Now, I am not saying that Classic won't have a big dropout, because it will, but not as big as most people think. It will probably be less than 50% for the first few weeks, and around 60% for the first few months. It will stabilize after 2-3 months. And this is based on multiple MMORPGs, that are subscription based, and existed for years. A 60% dropout rate is NORMAL, from day one to day 90.
---
Blizzard will also work with this numbers, but because we will have 2 WoWs running, there will be some overlap that will soften the dropout rate, long term.
---
Anyway, when you take into consideration a normal dropout rate of 60%, the fact that during launch day (first 24 hours) concurrent players is basically equal to total players, the fact that around 25% of the total players are concurrent players AFTER launch period (couple weeks) AND layering, Blizzard will have to start the Classic realms with a population that will be equal to 11k (Vanilla realms median pop) x 1.6 (to account for a 60% dropout rate), and that population will have to be spread on layers that will host around 3k players.
---
Which means that in order to have a total population of 11-12k players per realm, with around 2.5k-3k concurrent players, Blizzard will start the Classic realms with around 18-20k people, on 7-8 layers, for the first 24 hours.
---
Now, the above numbers are based on Vanilla realms. But all those numbers are FLEXIBLE. Some realms will have more concurrent players than other realms. Some will have less. Also, a Vanilla realm population with anything between 2k and 4k concurrent players is more than fine, for grouping, raiding, economy, community, etc.
---
Which means that the size of a layer, depending on how many concurrent players are, will be different, from realm to realm. It's not like the second a layer have 3,001 players, automatically there will be 2 layers.
---
You cannot assume the extremes here, either 0% or 99% dropout rate.The extremes never happen.
---
We clearly DON'T KNOW what the dropout rate will be, but it will be around the normal dropout rate of 60% anyway, be it a bit less or a bit more.
---
But because of layering, and especially because a layer can host a FLEXIBLE number of players, Classic realms population, long term will be very, very balanced. This is not Vanilla, when they fired up realm and realm, ending up with so many low pop realms after first 6 months.
---
Classic realms will be so much better, in terms of population. Most will be high pop, with few medium and very high pop, and probably no low pop realms ever.
---
I can give you 2 scenarios, for a single realm, that will have either a 40% dropout rate (which is very low) , either a 80% dropout rate (which is very high), to see that no matter which, that realm population will be FINE.
---
That realm will start with 18k people, spread on 6 layers, at launch, when concurrent players = total players. When 40% of the players will quit, that realm will have a TOTAL of 10,800 players, with 25% of them being concurrent, which is 2,700. That is a nice number, and it's a high pop realm.
---
Now, if 80% of those players will quit, the realm will end up with 3,600 total players, with 25% of the concurrent players, which is 900 concurrent players. Which is basically a very low pop realm.
---
HOWEVER, Blizzard will not randomly add layers, they will have the data that will show certain realms as having a higher dropout rate than other realms, during the first 24 hours, and they will either add additional layers OR increase the size of the layers on those particular realms.
---
This WILL HAPPEN, because some realms will have a higher dropout rate (for various reasons), and Blizzard will instantly react, by adding additional layers, or increase layer size, to combat a higher than normal dropout rate.
---
The dropout rate, using flexible layers, will be normalized, across all realms. There won't be 5k concurrent players realms, nor 1k concurrent players realms. The most populated ones will have less than 4k concurrent players, and the least populated ones around 2.5k concurrent players.
---
Another important fact : plenty of people will NOT login in the first 24 hours, but will login in Day 2,  which allows Blizzard to increase layers or layer size on certain realms, having enough leeway to ensure that most realms are having a balanced dropout rate.
---
And if by some miracle, the dropout rate will be unnaturally low...Blizzard will just add additional realms.
---
The layering is for balancing the dropout rates among all realms, to combat the first 48 hours of massive player logins and to ensure a healthy population long term.
---
If there will be more players than expected, Blizzard will add additional realms. That is NOT THE PROBLEM.
---
The problem is how many people will quit, and layering is to make sure that whatever the dropout rate is, all realms should end up with a healthy population long term.
---
Can Trump be the leader of the Bilgewater Cartel?
---
Nah mate this guy is a legit doctor of computer science, like every second person on this subreddit apparently.
---
In reality every one of those servers would be full or players spread out evenly. Not everyone is dumb enough to just hop one 1. and not even consider 2. or 3.
---
yes i'm explain
---
[How can bugs be in a game if it's beta!?](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DependentInformalIberianmole-size_restricted.gif)
---
He clearly says that the aim is to have a max capacity of 3k.  But it's not limited to that.  They can make the layer capacity 100 ppl on launch day.
---
Yeah I can clearly see how much the playerbase has grown since the introduction of sharding and less queues lmao  
---
but I guess theres no need for queues when nobody is playing your game.. so it actually fixes itself :thinking:
---
Because they don't even have a fraction the players that official servers will have.
---
How incredible is that!!!!
---
what we need is 6k pop capped realms with no layering. 
---
I mean no one is FORCING you to play on launch to combat the masses, you could easily wait a week or two and start then. This is what people did on 10k pop private realms aswel.
---
Yet somehow everyone is under the impression that they should play a week straight from launch and STILL expect an uncontested experience, and at the cost of an actual GOOD vanilla experience.
---
Alot of people will agree with me that a blizzlike pop cap of 3kish will be nothing compared to 10-12k pop launches on private servers, even 6k is significantly more doable and doesn't halt progression whatsoever. 
---
it should atleast limited to 1-10 zones.
---
That's not a bug. That is layering technology working as intended. The game is 15 years old btw and 3 years into development (there should be minimal bugs)
---
&gt; All these quality of life things to hold the normies hands and make it easier are what ruined the game in the first place. 
---
&gt; too tough to level 
---
This is all bullshit. I was 12 years old when I played and I had zero issues going all the way to doing about 50%~ of Naxxramas. Was I good at the game? No. Was I good enough? Apparently so. 
---
The game was never hard. Ever. If 12 year old me could play it then literally anyone without a diagnosed disability could too. 
---
You guys always confuse tediousness with difficulty. There's nothing "tough" about competing with 200 other people over 10 boars, there is no skill involved. It's just boring and makes me want to log off and do something else.
---
And when I said layering is going to suck big donkey d for classic and I Got shat on for it. unlucky!
---
How does rppvp servers work ? You cant gank people if you dont have a reason ir?
---
thats not a bug at all. its the mechanic of layering.
---
Ah yeh, got a source for that data besides that you pulled it outta your asshole?
---
Vanilla launch didn’t have 1/10th the amount of fucking people that are going to be in Classic, and TBC launch had players split between rolling blood elf and going to Hellfire Peninsula (and it was still a fucking shitshow). 
---
I think you’re the moron.
---
How long did it take you?   I'm defo making a shammy my main this time round (hunter was my main from Release to Cata), but I loved raiding &amp; PvPing in vanilla and tBC with my resto shammy.
---
No, they specifically said in the lastest stress test post that anyone on america &amp; oceania region will get in if they have an active sub.
---
Damn bro you're cool!
---
But the sharded servers will have a lot bigger population than the classic servers had 15years ago. 
---
Let's say they are considering 3 layers with 2k on each layer. Instead of layers you can do the servers and have 2k cap on each.
---
You're right I put items on AH too to help
---
I agree and I understand that. But why do randomly some places not give you the vest for your nards or chest piece?
---
Layering tech is the main piece of new tech...the age of the game is irrelevant. It's also the main component being tested currently so it's likely to be buggy.
---
&gt; cant tolerate a couple hours of crowded questing,
---
Oh yeah, I too remember famous private server launches, where 2 weeks after launch the starting zones were still chock full of people and it was impossible to complete quests :)
---
But no, it's those stupid retailers &gt;.&lt;
---
Because the people on the other layers on the same server aren't going to be total strangers. Are you fucking 12 years old?
---
&gt;You need to be selling stuff on the AH
---
Not buying stuff on the AH is more important
---
It's going to be for a few weeks. It's a necessary evil. This is going to be a game for 2+ years. A few weeks won't matter too much.

---
to mark a target with a skull, add this to a macro. change the 8 to other numbers if you want different icons
---
    /script SetRaidTarget("target", 8);
---
Phasing out during combat is almost assuredly on their bug list
---
&gt; I’m not interested in watching some clips
---
Have you seriously not seen the Plinkett reviews?? They aren't just "some clips", they are literally the best thing that came out of the prequels.
---
I dont even think they coint as milenials as they were still in their dads ballsack around the time of wow launch
---
I wasn't quite so bad but I was using garbage tier SSDs and yeah it's crazy how much faster my boot time alone is.
---
Which means you see POG and PogChamp yelled out 24/7? That is no better, that's what I already see in Twitch.
---
Worked at company like that once.
---
I just used an old 128gb ssd with a external sata to usb 3.0 adapter and reboot into linux using the external drive it should work with windows as well. Then i was running openvpn at home to get passed the company firewall restrictions.
---
Took over a year before one of the admins came by and asked me what i was doing, and i just told him i needed the linux system because of something i was working on, and he was just like "ok i'll mark you pc as developer" and i never heard from them again.
---
That is indeed correct. [This is the EQ level up sound.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P1SQYWChIM)
---
This. Or at least as a temporary measure Blizzard should make it so you can't more than 1 or 2 groups every few minutes?
---
I feel you, for me it was the same in the late stages of BC. When they nerfed every raid so that you could run through them with a PUG I just quit raiding for good.
---
 Remind Me! 69 days
---
Fortnite / POG spammers are Gen Z.
---
Better than nothing to kill for over a week, 10 hour queues, or no population after 2 months.
---
I think changing it to only be able to do it in an inn/capital might be a nice change
---
mine only had to last to cata which is probably why it survived
---
How do I know Where the Europe servers will be located? I live in SF and gonna play without friends in Sweden, so we’d prob want to start on a UK server.
---
&gt; No its not a good video, he is fighting in full blue gear against people in BIS gear im talking Tier 3 here, i know exactly what server this is.
---
Good for you, doesn't matter the gear difference. This is literally the reality of enhancement shaman in Vanilla regardless. Mostly shocking and autoattacking waiting for windfury to proc. It's not hard to use your brain for once
---
Keybind isn’t exactly what I’m looking for but thanks for the info
---
Can someone counter this BS by making an addon that ignores this shit in chat.
---
I'd be immensely grateful.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/EU_English_realms_info
---
Any info on how far out they were?
---
&gt; We all agree layering is a necessary evil in order for everyone to play on day one and not to have dead servers afterwards.
---
Strong disagree from plenty of us. Layering is not the best solution from the player's perspective. It's a money-saving, convenient offshoot of sharding devised by Blizzard so that they do not have to deal with dynamic merging of segments within clusters with shared name pools, which would offer the most Vanilla-like experience to players.
---
priest is the healer with the most utility, paladin the defensive healer and shaman the offensive healer in classic wow. priest should be ok for you, but if it has to be a little more offensive i would advise you to try shaman.
---
(dont play druids, they are neither offensive nor good healers, they suck at everything except mobility)
---
Awesome!! Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for
---
They should transition to phase 2 within 2 weeks.
---
I should've said Flurry instead of Enrage. Flurry, together with BT, is the main reason why fury is good. Enrage isn't the main one, even if /sit proc works (I heard it does but difficult to time).
---
I think that unfortunately this new build is just as bad.
---
If you need to get MS, just be arms. It's actually decent DPSer on trash due to Sweeping Strikes. Even better on Horde. Not as good as 2h fury (which is usually not as good as 1hs fury), but I'd say better than ret/enh.
---
Sjeezj, perhaps you should not have excluded EU from your stresstest hmmmmmm...
---
So strange the stress test takes place durimg the time when the devs are at work
---
Reddit did not like my screenshot. I will update a link to imgur in a second.
---
&gt; Neither of those options work out well for players. 
---
Well, a dead realm is PERMANENT.
---
Layering is TEMPORARY.
---
I don't know what are you smoking, but ONE of the above options have MUCH LESS negative impact. I rather have layering, and deal with it for a few weeks (and it will be gone in a few weeks) instead investing for 4-5 months in a realm that is dead.
---
Neither of this options work out well? Well, ONE CLEARLY DOES work much better than the other.
---
EU accounts could not join the stresstest this time. IT was only for US/OC accounts with an active sub.
---
Millennials are in their 30s now.
---
I know and you are right.
---
My point was just that wow didnt become popular because it was more casual then the others.
---
For many many people wow was the first mmo they tried, they didnt know everquest and others so they had no reference point how casual wow is and they didnt care at all.
---
The casualness just allowed wow to have a much bigger audience -after- it already was a success with the standard gaming crowd.
---
I thought it was because the player base back then played for the enjoyment of playing and now it crush skulls in raid and epeens.
---
Too old for Biden.
---
Looks like all the servers that have known locations aren't in the UK.
---
That inspect macro though lol
---
How about not paying for sub for 15 min of joy?
---
It rewards hardcore gaming twice by double and tripple dipping into valuable resources.
---
It's literally sharding tweaked.....
---
what you guys don't like twitch speak?!
---
Potentially the vest is not really considered necessary at this point so whether or not a given location provides it is a bit arbitraty/historical.
---
enchanting mats used to cost nothing to put in the ah.  if that's still true you could disenchant everything you get and store it in your mailbox.  come back to it at 60 to try to level it.
---
Afaik the next stresstest this June will be [Eu based](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292381/july-classic-stress-test-will-include-players-from-eu-realms)
---
OK
---
Your refusal to read anything I've said is mind boggling, truly. If you and 39 other people wanna get together and slave away for consumables just so you can speedrun raids, nobody is stopping you. I'll be in the other camp not stressing and still gearing up and clearing content.
---
So...you are saying that ALL alliance players will ONLY play Human?
---
I mean...are you dumb on purpose or trolling?
---
I think you shouldnt be able to switch layers at all except for group invites.
---
That and in many cases practically instant respawns.
---
IMO dynamic respawns are an ugly solution to fit more people in a world than the world was designed for.
---
Of course it can be implemented better. But there will probably always be edge cases.
---
I‘d prefer layering with no cross hopping or even cross interaction. Keeping layers pseudo permanent (barring few exceptions).
---
I don‘t trust Blizzard understands the issue with layering, though. They seem to believe that phasing is the only problem with it.
---
That's what she said !
---
Or when you ‘hid’ your cloak? Think that showed it too
---
I doubt that everyone and their mom will roll dwarf. They're aesthetically not for everyone and the majority of players aren't tryhard minmaxers.
---
Yea it has a 30 seco d CD and it is dispellable. You can prep how many people before the bg starts? If you do it before you zone in and have a fill raid, thats only for the first fight then. Still dispellable. Afterwards 1 person per 30 seconds. If you have a dwarf priest.
---
UD are widely popular
---
It somehow always made me feel happy to see a few gratz in gchat. Even after years of playing.
---
Yeah in molten core and zg
---
After that no.
---
The instant powershifting with macroes is a feature of the modern client. In vanilla and for some time after, you would be in caster form for a moment before you could shift back; This is most likely due to server needing the time to aknowledge that you have exited the form and are able to use potions and use shapeshifting abilites. 
---
Barkskin is on the GCD and triggers GCD in vanilla, so you can't use it in a powershifting macro.
---
between 19 and 39 to be verry specific
---
He didn't say "ideally", he said it "has to happen" before they enable world bosses.
---
I really wanna play two-hander enhancement shaman but I’m afraid I won’t be invited to raids or dungeons? Or won’t history repeat itself you think?
---
an x-ray?
---
not great, not terrible
---
Because Vanilla servers were never ment to hold 14k players and they don't have dynamic respawn ? It was a nightmare to quest back in the last stress test, and this is cool since that's the very purpose of these test but in the real game ? Guess most of us would just lvl to 60 farming mobs then.
---
There has to be a limit at some point. and btw :
---
&gt; I would never want to group with someone from another layer because I  don‘t know, never see or interact with people from other layers to begin  with. 
---
You didn't play with these players back in vanilla either as they were on different servers. This would make a much genuine vanilla experience to not be able to swap, but people wouldn't be able to meet their friends in game.
---

---
Thank you for sharing, it will be interesting to see the limits of feral dps and bear tanking in classic .
---
&gt;tbh, just find a IT guy @ work that plays WOW... we are not that rare either \^\^ I've installed countless games on sales's laptops... those guys/gals need to be relaxed before they go into their sales meeting... it is for the benifit of the company!
---
Why is it so hard to limit layer hoppping? Internal cd? Request layer transfer on battlenet that locks you for several hours until service is carried out? something like that.
---
&gt;Theorycrafting videos, namely Melderon’s in depth shaman leveling guide, have shown that there’s virtually no DPS difference between the weapon enchants
---
This is the opposite of what he showed in fact.
---
He has done multiple testing, and while the screenshots I pasted are more about builds than weapon enchants, it is also included (look for wind or rock). For dagger+shield, he always went for flametongue as a personal preference, and tried wf after people told him it's great. It even came out as a better option.
---
Probably gonna be rolling a feral tank druid, against most peoples beliefs, since i think a little variety in the tank space is needed, and i don't want to be part of the 20% warrior pack fighting for gear. 
---
Anyone else joining me and going the druid route? &lt;3
---
Yea, but there were login issues, most players only got online 3-5 hours after the official start of the stress test.
---
Find a guild of nice dudes, be a nice dude and put more work into the class and you're good to go.
---
That's layering, except you are cut off from the other people in the server....  Layering also deals with the too many people in the starting zones at release.   On release there will be a hundred or more layers to split up the population.
---
No I don‘t want 14k pop nonsense. I respect that you do. But to me that is what hell looks like.
---
I prefer 3k-4k caps. I can see appeal in 6k. 8k would already be a big compromise on my part. Anything beyond that is literally hell for me and I hope you can respect that we have different preferences.
---
I would be totally happy with 3k capped servers. However, that would inevitably lead to ghost towns and many servers could die pre Naxx. So we need a better solution.
---
Like it or not. The world was meticulously designed around a certain number of people. Respawns, mob density, all that. It does not matter if a server *can* handle 20k people. The question is whether they *should*.
---
Valuable resources are time gated because of competition. All layer jumping does is increase opportunities to acquire them. A person that layer jumps will get a slight advantage vs someone who doesn't. I suspect the impact will be minimal overall. Doing content that isn't time gated, such as grinding 5 mans, will probably end up producing more gold for time spent vs a group of 5 layer jumping around.
---
The impact laying will have over those "couple weeks"(blizzard never explained why they think they can remove layering after a couple weeks) will impact the whole cycle of the sever.
---
Smart people will abuse it to farm mats that will get more expensive as the game progresses. Farm lotuses on different layers. farm devilsaurs on all layers etc. 
---
I will be able to generate enough gold in those weeks that will last me through the whole cycle.
---
Fuuuuck nooo
---
This may shock you, but when you change code bugs get introduced.
---
It's not something your average raider would spec bit outside of that... Memespec is such a retarded fashion word by minmaxing twats who think that everyone who doesn't play by optimal raiding setup is a troll. Sorry but this is a full blown retarded attitude. Not everyone's a raiding minmaxing megatryhard. It'll likely be the minority. Sl/Sl locks were EVERYWHERE in vanilla
---
I dont get this, Is it good or bad ?
---
CRRUUUUSSHHHIIIIMMMM
---
I think that must be it. I participated in a stress test a little while ago, so the client is on my PC. My heart dropped when I saw this this morning.
---
Interesting, I wonder how far off they are at 60. Threat gen could be a lot lower than expect for bears :(
---
I wont be treating classic wow economy like IRL economy so its fine to me all i know is for the 1 hour a day i get to play i dont want to be fighting for mobs with 200 other players
---
&gt; guilds will bring enhancement shamans guilds will bring feral dps, especially casual guilds. and there will be tons of pug raids. classic isnt that hard, especially with all our knowledge and experience we have today.
---
&gt; hell we had a frostmage in naxx. half of our priests pretended to be holy while they were shadow during bwl. we had 1-2 enhancements, 1 feral dps/tank, 1 shadow and a trillion of hunters. and we downed several bosses in naxx.
---
&gt; dont listen to those elitists that say if u want to dps u go orc warrior/rogue or troll mage and ofc u need engi and 700 consumables and 300 worldbuffs and bis gear.
---
This.
---
Don't fall into the forum/reddit circlejerk of pseudo elite players.
---
That's not how humans think.
---
And what code was changed in the transition between sharding and layering? because they operate exactly the same!
---
It means druids are nerfed in Classic compared to private servers
---
They want to launch with as few servers a possible to avoid dead servers.
---
Except for when they don't
---
&gt; No hybrid class in vanilla performs a role better than a non-hybrid version of that role. Full stop.
---
Except lot of people gonna be trash so yes if you are a good hybrid you will have a spot.
---
You won't change my mind, mmo champion is full of post HELP MY DPS PLS of people playing the fotm class with bis gear.
---
Or the game is literally almost unplayable the first weeks.
---
Pick your poison.
---
Don't be discouraged. What you are experiencing is actually pretty close to what all those people who made you curious about the game experienced as well. There are millions of how I started WoW stories that are almost word for word like yours. Some of these people ended up on Blizzcon stages playing for championships. Every story has a humble beginning. The site classic.wowhead.com will be your friend when it comes to searching for quest information. Looking up info on websites is also part of the experience. 
---
All in all, I think you did pretty good. You joined groups, had a stranger show you some of the ropes, learned about one of the gotchas with questing and explored seeing Stormwind. Not bad at all. The rest comes in time, just keep doing what you are doing, trying to engage people around you. It will take some patience. Also know that a lot of people are coming from retail where that is their only experience with WoW. Never talking to random people out in the world is common. They will either come around or drop off when they get bored.
---
The worst part of your story is that you are currently lost and want to know how to get back on the right track when it comes to questing. This is where you may want to engage classic.wowhead.com. my guess is that you need to head back to Goldshire
---
Bad if you want to do more damage as a feral druid. Neutral otherwise. It's another thing on the long list of stuff private servers have gotten wrong
---
Pet damage does tag the mob to you, but you have to deal dmg to it to be able to loot it. Thats how it used to work in vanilla. If a pet 100% killed a mob, you could not loot it.
---
Maybe someone can test it on the beta?
---
I love it. For all the haters out there add those twitch chat codes into a spam throttle add on.
---
Won't they turn off layering soon after launch?
---
Want to join a group with your friends? Little did you know that by joining that group to do that world quest jumped you into a different layer, and now you have to wait 30 mins to do that dungeon
---
Ah thanks for the info and bringing it up now, i will not play druid.
---
That‘s the best way *but only to do once or twice*.
---
Once you did it once or twice, you probably no longer want to read quest texts.
---
The people you are referring to probably leveled characters many times. They are here for level 60 content and to be VIPs in a virtual world.
---
Warrior + Shaman. Windfury. Never oom. Heals. Constant attack go go go. Never die, self res etc.
---
Too bad they're capping all zones, and for the first year.
---
&gt; what we need is 6k pop capped realms with no layering. 
---
And what will happen when 5k of those players are bored waiting in queues (and people are NOT PATIENT beings), roll on another realms that have no queue...and your bright idea leads to a realm with 1k people?
---
Do you have an answer?
---
I dun wahnt et
---
This server they'll use for layering is a mega server. So when you say 'people' you mean 'strangers'. 
---
&gt; cutting people off from the other people in the server..
---
...but precluding the possibility of the many different exploitative methods of layer swapping.  
---
...and offering a consistent player base with whom you'll log in every day. 
---
I'd take Clusters every time. Aggressively merge the Segments as soon as the active player populations of any two Segments within a Cluster have active populations that can be smoothly merged.
---
she's a little old for him
---
Or getting to 40 as fast as possible and using your mount to do all of those things faster...
---
Apparently they already said it will be all zones for the first year
---
I decided on dwarf paladin :D t2 here i come!
---
okay see you on release
---
Sl/Sl was not in Vanilla, that's tbc.
---
I'm not saying its a bad raid spec. I'm saying SL is a bad pvp spec. Its not good in bg's, its not that great in world pvp, and its terrible in any group/premade pvp. The reason is you can't kill anyone that does not want to fight you. Because you are slow as shit, and do hardly any damage. 
---
People see you in world pvp and they ignore you because it's just a waste of time. In bg's you are ignored and your allies are killed first. If you are alone, they just wait till they have 3 players and then kill you. You have no escape and tankiness is great but you just don't have the damage to take someone out quickly.
---
Piercing howl and blood craze is better than imp battle shout though.
---
Thanks. What do you think would be best for us to play on then, a Stockholm server?
---
tbh, if you play any race other then a dorf, you'r not worth my time to begin with.... we are the bestest at every class... Only reason to not play dorf, is to play a female NE drood and dance for us in IronForge!
---
yea both are old, but i can see already from the downvotes ppl i shouldnt have commented that, my mistake to comment on political stuff on reddit lol
---
Sadly we have a company policy that forbids plugging in anything from the outside including personal pendrives and stuff.
---
I agree with the first proposition but strongly disagree with the second one. 
---
Imagine questing in Barrens and not being able to find a single Zhevra for 12 hours and finally after you find it, you kill it and it doesn't drop anything.
---
"Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.
---
Bush: Whatever you want.
---
Trump: Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything."
---
MVP right here!
---
Moving the goalposts and insults really support your reasonable argument nicely autismo joe, keep it up.
---
Oh yeah how so bucko? you can abuse sharding the exact same way as layering! it's the same fucking thing. except it's not cross realm. That is the only difference.
---
Also the global chat and guild chat will be a spamfest of players asking for invites only for this crap. It will kill social interaction.
---
Yeah that's actually kinda shit. =/
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday! :'(
---
NOCHANGES
---
Dont worry I got a Ben Shapiro one on deck /silly
---
No you’re missing the point. What you don’t realize is that classic is a game that will most likely be played by the OG players, players who actually played vanilla. Most players that play vanilla are now over 25 and don’t sit at home watching streamer play video games all day. We got jobs and shit to do. I personally haven’t seen a single stream on classic, because it simply doesn’t interest me to see someone else play the game I already have played before. Is not new content that’s being revealed. Is old content that’s being brought back. The fact that you are worried about the “hype” just shows that you aren’t one of us, old school players. Because we aren’t here for the hype, we are here for the content, content that’s not new to us.
---
They're all digital megaservers now...  Your plan is literally just layering with fixed server populations and without cross communication.
---
Why would you "decide to not play on a populated server" and then complain that the population is too small?
---
It's idiocy like this that makes the majority suffer, why would you introduce a system that affects everyone, when a small group of people, that have made the concious decision not to play with alot of people, complains?
---
When your say normies so much any valid point you have is thrown out the window.
---
Depends on the parameters they use. With good tuning you would possibly only have 1-3 of those and can allow transfers.
---
I hate layering as much as anyone else and it could actually burn the game if it makes it in without major revisions.
---
Every single “layering bad” thread has the same sense of arrogance to it. Honestly I just think the majority of the population doesn’t give a shit if someone nolifes there way to 60 and then proceeds to stockpile some random valuable mat for a short period of time. The hardcores care, but the casuals just don’t have that kind of shit on their radar. The phrase “Devilsaur Mafia” is lost on most of the players,
---
I don't think it's particularly different from the other garbage people post into trade chat.
---
I think the escape artist racial is bis for pvp, although stone form could stack nicely if you need to expel dots and vanish. Personally, I don't mind the dwarf skin, but can't remember how bad the melee animations were. Good luck!
---
I'm surprised to see you defending layering man. You've been one of the strongest advocates on this sureddit for getting Classic right. Maybe you're not aware of what I mean by Clusters:
---
Cluster (21,000 active players) consists of various segments (3,000 active) which all share a name pool for ease of future merges. Segments would be called something like Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 
---
As any two Segments see population drops they can be merged together. Players on each segment log in every day to the same player base. So strangers become acquaintances become friends. Same experience as it was in Vanilla and TBC, just with a painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline.
---
&gt; My point was just that wow didnt become popular because it was more casual then the others.
---
That is not the *only* reason. But that is definitely *one* of the reasons.
---
If EQ had been as populated and well marketed as WOW was you'd have a lot more people, especially casual players, quitting the game a lot faster due to the unforgiveable nature of the game. People who stuck with WOW despite the slog would likely been filtered out in a game that was less forgiving like EQ. 
---
From a business perspective that means a more casual game is actually a better business model because more players = more money. In fact Blizzard's over-reliance on this style of business model is one big reason why recent retail WOW has been shitty. 
---
They made the game so easy and accessible that they replaced core audience members with casual players. Giving your players instant gratification created instantly larger market shares for Blizzard. But it was a short term pay-off that sacrificed long-term longevity.
---
Vanilla WOW struck a very good balance between brutal gameplay mechanics and accessibility. But if it was a few degrees more difficult you likely would have seen a lot more casual fans washing out a lot sooner.
---
&gt;For many many people wow was the first mmo they tried, they didnt know everquest and others so they had no reference point how casual wow is and they didnt care at all.
---
I never said they did. But take a look at Classic Beta. There are tons of people bitching about the difficulties of the game, such as travel and other things that require some time and consideration. You can't just pay some silver and zip from Darnassus to Stormwind in an instant. You have to take a nearly 30 minute run, maybe longer if you die a lot along the way, to make that run.
---
In Everquest if you died you would lose your body. Your body could decay with everything it had on it if you didn't retrieve it in time. That includes high level gear, money, items, etc. it would all just disappear if you didn't retrieve your body in time. You always had a long ass time, but casual players who may log out for a week at a time could have lost all their stuff.
---
The average player who lost 20+ levels worth of armor, gold and bags and so on to a failed corpse run would likely rage quit the game entirely. The point isn't that people flocked to WOW cause they *knew* it was easier.
---
But WOW kept casual fans around who would have otherwise bolted if the game was a lot harder.
---
PvE players are the Vegan Crossfitters of WoW

That's not how anyone with a brain with a brain rates art, though.
---
There are tons of factors to an expansion and giving it a 1/10 just because you didn't like the theme just makes you one of those morons who rate a product on amazon 0/5 because the colour of the product doesn't quite match the colour of your cat, while it functionally does exactly what someone who buy it wants from it at a hogh quality.
---
People like you make community voting sites like imdb so fucking trash and unreliable. Incapable of taking an objective look at something while trying to not let your personal shit get in the way of a reviw6 that will be read by anyone, not just people who also hate pandas l and a chinese theme.
---
I'm with you on the theme, as you know, but the raids were pretty good, the pacing of the progression (patch releases) was the best of any expansion, CMs were the foundation for M+ - one of the best things added to WoW. To say the expansion was as bad as WoD just because the theme sucked is massively disingenious.
---
Imagine you're Blizzard and trying to figure out what stuff was good and what was bad and then you get slapped with such a bad rating. Toss EVERYTHING because the theme was bad?
---
This is not how reviews work, friend.
---
Vanilla:  
---
Quivers visible to player? No  
---
Quivers visible to other players? No  
---
Classic:  
---
Quivers visible to player? Yes  
---
Quivers visible to other players? No
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!!
---
Then don't play at launch? You obviously are of a more casual type player if the idea of competition, fighting for mobs puts you off then taking a couple of weeks before playing instead of launch isn't going to be the end of the world to you.
---
They dont have a clue and its so weird. Its all people that have never played the game seriously.
---
For veterans the issues are very clear but when brought up you get a massive downvote because their favorite streamer said is gonna be ok :')
---
Its those people that dont care about layering that will be ones that will leave anyway before they even reach 60 lol.
---
So you wont be playing then?
---
&gt;  This is about running fewer servers 
---
*fewer realms. They need the same amount of hardware. This is to battle realms completely dying off.
---
IS NOT NEW CONTENT! That’s what you don’t get. There is NOTHING new about wow classic. It’s the opposite of new.
---
Honestly these are my ratings
---
Episode IV &gt; Episode V &gt; Episode VI &gt; Episode III and all others were shit imo.
---
One sec, let me just e-mail blizzard. Surely they'll send me their internal changelist...
---
Sure, PvP servers will be better for content but then you take your life in your own hands. 
---
You know full well that 100 people will be trying to gank you, all day, every day for the rest of time. Entire guilds will probably spring up just to kill you. Especially if streamers blacklist. All the blacklisted people will end up in a guild together. 
---
Do agree that community solutions are best but it has the potential to become extremely toxic (and also awesome - I'm thinking constant mass PvP), which I for one am looking forward to (since it won't affect me in any way).
---
Strong connections, bonds, allies, enemies and acquaintances are being made during the leveling phase. I wouldn’t want to merge servers, as I experienced it in the past and it can be very problematic for the community’s health.
---
No matter how much hate wod gets it will always not be hated enough.
---
Any idea why there is more armor in bear form on classic? Is the armor wrong on LH, too?
---
Robe of the Void. I doubt I will go through all the effort to make another one. The pet healing ability is also not that great. The amount of felcloth and bop demonic runes are not worth it.

Pop quiz time!  
---
If you encounter a player in world pvp and they switch layers to avoid you, would you:
---
A ) Uninstall the game, then take to reddit and the forums. "This is unacceptable! This offense must have answer!"
---
B ) Weigh up the pros and cons of layering. Then get over it like a sane, rational thinking human being and continue to enjoy the experience.
---
If you answered A )
---
Congratulations, you have just been clinically diagnosed as melodramatic.  
---
Maybe skip the launch of classic and go spend a few weeks outside whilst you wait for phasing to be removed becoming a better adjusted person. Whilst you're out and about, maybe go for a nice walk to the library and look up 'overreacting' in the dictionary.  
---
If you answered B )  
---
Why are you even reading this, you don't care at all and you shouldn't. It's not a big deal. You know this. You don't need it confirmed by popular opinion. Go and find a higher quality discussion to participate in with people who aren't in a state of constant rage.
---
Ion pulled a fast one on all of you. Just remember me when layering is still in on naxx patch. lmao
---
omg I've never thought about that
---
I noticed that too and reported it in the beta a while ago. Hopefully it makes the fix list

Going a SIMILAR route. Resto Shaman to have a bigger chance at gear too!
---
I can see it now, all the BFA players who want classic to get away from things like LFG , quest helper etc will enjoy classic for a week, maybe two till the majority of players start using the mods that give these features to classic.
---
I honestly hope that blizzard ban's or blocks these addons.
---
Nah

Thinking of it too. Go Alchemy. Nobody gonna turn down both WF totem AND potentially free potions :D
---
Pretty much. A significantly better experience for the players, who are the group we should be advocating for.
---
i believe the radiology departments for different hospitals can set their own procedures depending on law suit risk factors and funding available
---
Mate I do tons of roleplay but you bet your buttcheeks I'll be jumping every moment I'm not RPing.
---
Sure I'm not arguing that a blacklist will actually work, I'm just defending their right to make a blacklist. The thing Soda seems to disliked is people that are desperate to get on stream. On a PVE server you are very limited in what you can do about people always following you around.
---
What content stream was there for non raiders?
---
Launch -....??? - Tanaan Jungle -...???? Selfie cam? Am I missing something?
---
Mind you raiding, even with LFidiots, is still a niche in WoW so if all you focus on os raids, no matter how good they are, the majority of the community will be unhappy.
---
Not only was it only raids, but Garrisons and the harbour were an absolute shitfest and I hope the moron who came up with this shit gets regularly kicked in the balls when wow players see him in the streets. Mission tables were like the worst shit that happened to WoW (more like the cherry on the shitmountain maybe) and blizz still keeps them in...
---
Is there a difference?
---
Yeah and he was the first warlock and taught his fellow shamans how to be warlocks too before the orcs invaded azeroth. Im not entirely shure though if there werent any other mages on azeroth who used fel magic before the orcs invaded.
---
Needs sub, no EU and even with EU testers test times are bad.
---
You write `корова`, you pronounce `kɐˈrovə`.
---
But why do you need a macro when the keybind is already in the game?!
---
Classic but maybe will play retail every so often like once a fortnight as I’ll be subscribed anyway.
---
And people like me? No friends initially going in to abuse this shit? We suffer the most. I just want a fair, and competitive classic environment. But that clearly wont happen.
---
Blizzard said all items will have 1.12 itemization https://www.wowhead.com/news=291443/itemization-in-wow-classic-items-to-use-1-12-versions
---
Yea that doesn't sound like intended functionality.
---
your small... what?
---
WotlK killed WoW by catering to noobs with super easy heroics and dungeonfinder. WotlK was Blizz' greed overtaking their judgement for good game design. 'see how many players we can rake in if we make everything super accessible'.
---
No raid attunements anymore, either. Don't let the awesome atmosphere of the expansion cloud your judgement, WotlK is where the foundatioms for wows demise were laid
---
Both ways?! Is there somewhere I can die close to IF to get to Wetlands?
---
It's breakfast time! remember to drink your soy milk
---
Sure, but i wont play more because of an ad that tells me to install lol because its so great and fun. In the times i played it a lot i alrdy spent more than i want to know.
---
Yea, and most of them are located in russia.
---
We can do all this with a combination of setting CVars and toggling Interface options.
---
This will enable auto loot, set camera distance to max (further than the GUI allows), disable smart-pivot camera and turn on all action bars.
---
It's too long to fit into one macro, so I would split it between CVars and Interface Options.
---
These option are static, however many times you click this macro, the settings won't change.
---
    /console autoLootDefault 1
---
    /console DistanceMaxZoomFactor 4
---
    /console cameraSmoothStyle 0
---
These options are a toggle so clicking over and over will turn bars off and then back on.
---
    /click InterfaceOptionsActionBarsPanelRight
---
    /click InterfaceOptionsActionBarsPanelRightTwo
---
    /click InterfaceOptionsActionBarsPanelBottomLeft
---
    /click InterfaceOptionsActionBarsPanelBottomRight
---
I mean, I'll just play at launch with layering and still having to fight for mobs, but in a playable way, that seems cool :)
---
while that was worse, i still hate bfa for also having AP. wish they just ditched the concept
---
horde players know they would win 100% of the time of they went full tryhard, which is why we allow for some memespecs here and there to make it a modicum of difficult for the rest of us (coolshades)
---
I think they should restrict movement between layers and merge them when the time comes. 90% of what makes leveling cool in vanilla is doing hogger with some randoms, and then finding them in your deadmines group the next day, and bang, they're on your friend list.
---
I keep seeing people say this is gonna ruin server economies but I'm not sure I see it? If there are 5 layers with 5 sets of resource spawns doesn't that also mean there are 5 servers worth of players? So then shouldn't the available supply and demand remain relatively in balance compared to what would happen if each layer was it's own server? Am I misunderstanding how layering works?
---
There's a difference in damage output for Druid feral forms. Druids deal more damage on private servers than they do in Classic. It is speculated that Fury Warriors will deal more threat than Feral Druids when going all out. this is important for min/maxers.
---
A good choice, but a personal favorite of mine is 
---
&gt;	but fill my bars with huge, colorful icons,
---
Even at 60+?
---
Just make a free starter account on retail and test it
---
&gt; Supreme Power, 150 spell damage/healing 
---
Supreme power doesn't affect healing, only damage : [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13512](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13512)
---
Wow this shit needs some limitations. Like you can't change layers if you are in combat or smth.
---
there was always dynamic respawns the lead dev from the original game confirmed this on stream
---
Nice find.
---
Have to sub to reserve your name 2 weeks early I'm pretty sure. That'll be the first day I sub
---
Then you could always just go on a lower population server then everyone gets what they want.
---
Macro I can input a spell into therefor, press one button and do two things. It’s a neat feature eh?
---
The stats don't add up in either comparison.
---
Left side: Power is green, so something gives it a bonus.
---
Right side, Cat: Power again green.
---
Right side, Bear: "no extra str, no extra AP" uh sure dude just look at the stats...
---
Not saying pservers got it right, but this is a poor proof they didn't.
---
This went faster and I'm a busy person, so from an efficiency standpoint it was worth
---
&gt; Is the ~~Classic~~ reddit community so fucking toxic
---
Fixed for you.
---
C) Make a stupid reply to a serious issue
---
The issue is not even the PVP. are u braindead? Have a think for yourself and what could the impact be of layering on a server if its not the PVP?
---
Right, the fucking economy. People will be able to grind mats on different layers, farm lotuses, farm devilsaur and so much other things that will get expensive as the cycle progresses.
---
People will make so much money that they will be able to OWN the AH and control everything.
---
I will be able to generate 10-20K gold in "those couple weeks"
---
I'm sure blizzard employees work 9-5 weekday jobs for the most part.
---
"Sorry bro can't come BRD i'm layer locked for the next 2 hours"
---
They are neither up or down!
---
What would be there incentive to keep it? 
---
Genuinely asking.
---
I got this for the rogues' stealth ability too...
---
I wasn't trying to change your mind. I was trying to properly educate you on the subject.
---
There is absolutely no denying the facts. Take a single player and give them 100% knowledge/skill of the game. They are the perfect player with all the knowledge in the world about the game mechanics. That player will always do more DPS as a main-role DPS over a hybrid. Every single time.
---
&gt;Except lot of people gonna be trash
---
There are going to be tons of hunters and mages who are trash. And because DPS is the most played role by far (nearly 60%+ of the player base mains a DPS) there are going to be tons of main-role DPS who are good or great at their roles too.
---
&gt;if you are a good hybrid you will have a spot.
---
Of course you are. But if you are competing with another good hybrid DPS and a good main-role DPS you may find the good main-role DPS gets picked over you both.
---
Paladins especially are consistently forced into healing. Does that mean you personally will be? Of course not. Skill, personality, and the make-up of your guild raiders will be a major determining factor in your experience.
---
But on average? On average as a paladin you wont be getting picked often in DPS roles and a lot of people will openly make fun of your decision to run a ret paladin.
---
&gt;You won't change my mind
---
Again, not trying to change your mind but you said this:
---
&gt;Basically I want to play a hybrid dps class but I dont want to be handicapped that it's not a full dps class.
---
And my point here is that this will never be the case. As a hybrid class you will *always* be handicapped for not being a full DPS class. Always.
---
Hybrid classes are jack of all trades, master of none type of characters. This isn't up for debate, it's a fact. If you do not enjoy that, then don't fool yourself into thinking your experience will be different. You don't want to get to level 60 thinking you wish you'd picked another class.
---
*You will never be a master of any role the hybrids fill, over the main role version of that class.* Never ever.
---
You might be better than the mage/rogue who has less skill over-all than you. But you will never outpace someone of equal skill playing a main role class. If that concern is big enough to change your mind, then so be it. If not, then so be it. Just be *aware* of that fact. Because it's not a debate.
---
That doesn't mean you shouldn't role a hyrbid, by any means. I personally love the hybrid classes. My main since B.C was a Paladin. I also played a druid for a long time and loved that too.
---
Just because a class is not 100% the best, doesn't mean they are not viable or don't have a place.
---
But you yourself said you do not want to be handicapped next to a main-role DPS. But you will be, whether you like it or not.
---
That doesn't have to be a deal breaker for you though, you can definitely clear all content in the right guild as almost any role. Paladins are useful for their buffs and other raid abilities, even if they are mediocre DPS. You will have a harder time finding a place than other DPS, but you can definitely find one. You will never out-dps other main role DPS, but you can do enough to be viable.
---
There is a big difference between viability, and min/maxing.
---
You can definitely be viable. But you wont ever be the best or most wanted by a raid/guild.
---
Do whatever you want with that information.
---
The level 15 bear probably has rank 1 Mark of the Wild (+25 armor). The armor value in stats is green indicating that something is buffing it.
---
Can someone do hunter pets next? I'm almost certain they are overtuned on pservers aswell
---
Karova means cow in russian. Great name.

Gonna feel real good to roll a Night Elf, though. Much less populated zone.
---
If it's in the starter zones then it's not dynamic respawn, iirc it was about making sure there were at least X number of each mobs in the starter zones. He said it was called overspawn iirc.
---
Afaik there was no Dynamic respawn tech in vanilla reducing the respawn timer by taking into account he number of players in the area.
---
Well obviously I'm late to the party.
---
I'll need a quote for that, my dude.
---
I still remember that addon where you could search for groups in other "shards" *(was that it?)* and instantly swap into a full raid group.  
---
Remember when you just flew to a open world boss and used that addon to find a raid and join it in seconds with the boss at 5%.
---
Help me out here... I thought this was supposed to be limited to JUST start zones?  Now we have it happening in STV?
---
I am convinced they will just leave this crap in and continue ruining what made WoW work.
---
If people are going to be able to dodge wPvP... then there will be NO wPVP.  And, Classic will fail.
---
Out of context clip lol... watch the vod for another 30 seconds after the clip ends.
---
Oh man what joy this was to read! Keep figuring out the game, by playing the game. You will have so many fun stories to tell, and that's the heartbeat of the game.
---
I felt like Vanilla/TBC you had one alt. So you had your main who you played 90% of the time, and then when you just wanted to bullshit around you had your alt.
---
And your alt would always be in the same guild so you could stay in guild chat.
---
Can someone please post this on the official forum? Maybe we can still get them to do something about it.
---
My main was a hunter from 2005 to 2012, and I was a hardcore raider &amp; got to rank 12 in PvP. However I loved playing my resto shammy, especially in Vanilla and tBC PvP. 
---
This time I want to make a shammy my main, but I'll also level a hunter as they are so easy to farm gold with.
---
same feeling
---
Lmao, bro

No kidding

it's absolutely necessary that people find every possible way to abuse this shitty system.

I'm just trying to think about what your teachers taught you. You seem to be exhibiting socialistic symptoms here with this notion that value can be centrally determined and with anger that demand from the market is what determines value.

LPT: the value of things available in vast supply is determined by demand for it, not by supply. In other words: perceived value by the consumer determines what the consumer will pay.

quest helper has been in WoW since the beginning, dunno what you're on about.
---
and this addon does nothing other than add icons to a chat window if you type them in right, so WAY far off the lit of damning addons so no it won't be blocked/banned/disabled.
---
&gt;Every time I read about ppl planning on having a main and alts feels like they somehow going against this vanilla vibe.
---
&gt;I find that having alt(s) is not really vanilla at all.
---
People had alts in vanilla. I'm not sure why you would think its some how antithetical to the principles of vanilla WoW. Even people who actually roleplay tend to have alts. People like to step into the shoes of other characters.
---
So they are an Undead Mage right now, but later they'll be an Orc Shaman. Maybe tomorrow I'll be a Tauren Hunter. Its like playing D&amp;D but being confused why someone would make a new character. 
---
I think most people are going to have alts. I know I'm planning on having at least two alts. I'm gonna main a healer, but I need an alt for farming and I want a Rogue because stealth and wPvP is very fun to me.
---
We're working on it. We tend to remove most under Rule 7 now, and filter a lot out.

No thanks ill just take the cancer in the chat. much less effort.

Use a tunneling service. Shouldn't be an issue.  Got sub 100 ping from China to NA. Always funny when Aussies had no clue how not to lag like a bitch.

I'd rather play a dead server than a game set in a totally uncohesive world that makes no fucking sense, which is exactly what layering will bring us. People **will** abuse this system.
---
... and the feeling was good!  Forgot how good this game felt to play.
---
Didnt get it....
---
"Go suicide and listen for yourself"
---
Good point, thanks. I'll go edit. I can't believe how uppity people get over a fucking game. I love it, don't get me wrong but suck it up.
---
I used to use Quartz at the time
---
Graveyard servers aren't theoretical, they're pretty much inevitable without some kind of interference. Sharding is different from layering by a couple degrees of magnitude. Layering is far preferable to sharding, which was the original plan that no one wanted.
---
Thanks a lot
---
If you have lets say 10 times more tidal charms than usual. That should only really be happening by there being 10 times more players on the realm than usual as well. Otherwise enough new layers should not be created. Same thing with any world resources. 
---
But if it works like MN is saying, that's just a terrible implementation. They could easily assign you a new layer every time you log on to consolidate them. They might even still do that, it's just on a timer after you log out or something until you are unassigned from your layer. 
---
I just don't want the fucking mess of merging dying realms after a couple of months, and if they do layering in a good way it should not really upset any balance in the economy or whatever. It's only slightly "bad" for the community, being split into several layers, but much less bad than merging with an entire different realm.
---
You're a change
---
Yes, one of the druids on level 15 has a rank 1 motw
---
Gold sellers wont have that gold on day 2 or 4. You'd have to even give them a week or two.
---
How is the fact that the balance was shit: 'the best part of pvp'?
---
Shamans make up maybe 20% of the horde you towel

Use the "Lock ActionBars" option right underneath where you turn the bars on. Or, run this:

    /click InterfaceOptionsActionBarsPanelLockActionBars

I know right

Another great episode Josh. Listened while out for my run - good times.
---
I thought layering was going to be just over launch and restricted to start areas?
---
Where dis they say that. Last i rest was idially 2 weeks, worst case scenario phase 1. And ian said that anything beyond phase 1 was out of the question.

do you realize that we played wow before sharding technologies existed?
---
Im not unaware of the ability to lock the buttons. I want to know if you can move locked items by shift clicking on the button. Or do you need to go in and unlock the bars move the icon to its new home then go back in and lock them again. 1.12 client shift clicking didnt work if private server clients are to be believed. Its a small thing but a big qol improvement imo.
---
Not by a freaking longshot. Not even close. You are making it too big of a deal. A handful of people will farm a couple of thousand gold each. Has no bearing to you whatsoever and this money will just go poof within 2-3 weeks in Naxx consumables alone.
---
Its not about getting stuck in their ways when some specs simply dont work.  Sure you can leech some raids doing 1/10 the dps others do, but its just not fair for others. Also leeching isnt fun for the leecher either.
---
Ultra neat keyboard! Love it.
---
&gt; Why didn't vanilla die without these tools? 
---
Because the player population was continually growing. It's not until Cata and MoP that the population started shrinking, and that's also when they started merging servers, and eventually implemented cross realm sharding and stuff. 
---
In classic the population will be shrinking after launch. So the question is if we want to deal with that by initially having massive realms (which require some sort of layering to be balanced). Or if we want to merge realms later on. There are pros and cons to both. 
---
That said, if it actually works like MN is saying, that's a terrible way to do the layering, they could just assign you a new layer every time you log on and that wouldn't really be a problem.
---
Where did they say that layering would not work during combat?
---
I'll explain it a bit differently:
---
Some assumptions or simplifications for this explanation:
---
- Whenever a character is created, it is assigned a main layer. 
---
- Whenever you exit client, all of your characters are returned to their main layer
---
- For simplicity of this example, I will disregard the possible character creation on August 13th and we will assume that characters can be created August 27th 12am.
---
That means, if you're one of the first people to create a character (A) you'll end up on layer 1. Let's assume you play for 2-3 hours now and a lot of players log in. Now, when you create a new character (B), it will most probably (but not guaranteed!) end up on layer 2, because layer 1 will be full by then. Now, whenever you exit client, A returns to layer 1 and B returns to layer 2. 
---
If you exit client, and log into B, log out and log into A, A will be transferred to layer 2 until you exit the client. 
---
That is basically how it works. Obviously there is no way to know which layer your character is on, and you can't guarantee on character creation that you end up on a different layer than your other character, but it is still an issue. 
---
However, it is not at all tied to the amount of your characters on the server, to the position on the character screen or any other nonsense. It's just plain and simple "if there's a slot on the layer then it will be your main layer". Layers are basically a way for Blizzard to implement "mini-servers" on a server.
---
Do it Blizzard! We definitely want it!
---
I wouldnt say its antithetical, I just wanted to find out how many ppl associate vanilla by playing only one character most of the time (90%+), thats it.

---
&gt; Do you realize how much coordination this takes?
---
Speak for yourself, if killing a mob or reading a persons name for a point of reference requires a highly coordinated effort on your part then I don't really know what to say to you.
---
Fishing in floating ponds in nagrand was one of my favorites
---
I've decided to play a warrior as my main. It's my first time and I never played warrior during retail vanilla. 
---
I know I will level as arms and dump the rest of my talents in fury after getting MS. 
---
But I can't decide what professions I should go for. I always try to level my professions so they are up to pair with my chars level.
---
Herb/alch seems to be a solid choice to help the leveling process with HP potions and other buffs and I'm also going to level cooking (never did that either in vanilla, thought it was shit lol). There is also a demand for potions so you can sell a lot on AH.
---
Another part of me want to level mining/BS but if I remember correctly it's extremely hard to level crafting prof and most of the times when you can craft a nice blue you're 5 levels to high to make if worth wearing.
---
Or just go mining/engi for dmg to help me in WPVP. But it won't make me a lot of money and I really want my mount at lvl 40.
---
Help me decide what professions and race (Alliance)  I should pick!
---
Is that any different from having people spam "Bur", "Kek", "lol", "pwned" back in the day? It's same same but different.
---
People are delusional if they think that players back in ~2006 were some beacon of class and respect. We were the "twitchkids " of that time.
---
&gt; That's not how anyone with a brain with a brain rates art, though.
---
Look, I get you liked the Pandas. But they have been getting hate since the XPAC announced. That is a fact. Pandas have been shit on as a race far more than just about any singular addition to the game. The Kung-Fu Panda jokes started the day it got announced and are still happening nearly a decade later.
---
&gt;There are tons of factors to an expansion and giving it a 1/10 just because you didn't like the theme just makes you one of those morons who rate a product on amazon 0/5 because the colour of the product doesn't quite match the colour of your cat, while it functionally does exactly what someone who buy it wants from it at a hogh quality.
---
The numbers don't lie. Review critics and audiences alike did not receive MOP well compared to Vanilla through CATA.
---
According to review critics MOP was only better than BFA and was equally bad as WOD. According to review critics MOP was not better than Vanilla, B.C, Wrath, CATA, and Legion. Reception seems to be pretty similar in the player base.
---
&gt;I'm with you on the theme, as you know, but the raids were pretty good, the pacing of the progression (patch releases) was the best of any expansion, CMs were the foundation for M+ - one of the best things added to WoW.
---
And it was all utterly meaningless because no matter how good it is, if you slap a Hello Kitty Island Adventure theme over it I'm not going to fucking play it. I don't care if it was a modern day version of WOW that was as revolutionary as the original WOW was.
---
Tomorrow they could release Hello Kitty: Friends Forever with 2040 graphics. It could be the best game ever made. I still would not play it because it's Hello Kitty. I'm sorry, I do not *care* how good the raids are or how nice the progression is. I have absolutely no emotional investment in Hello Kitty or her friendship meow palace.
---
Yes, I view Panda's and the entire XPAC revolving around them to be as frivolous and stupid as Hello Kitty. And if you take a look at how many people left the game after CATA ended you'll realize I'm not the only one.
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it. But many people did not, and quite frankly MOP was the beginning of the end for the series. Every XPAC with the exception of Legion has been just as bad or worse. Blizzard has lost so many subs they are quite literally rebooting the game from Vanilla to bring players back.
---
Well you will still suffer from that with sharding arguably even more. With a closed server that merges you still keep your strong community and add others to it. With sharding you might miss a lot of the people you have seen in a dungeon or while leveling because they are in a different shard.
---
We had this exact same discussion when sharding was introduced into retail, it looked seemingly great on paper but no one understood the actual effects it had in game. Ironically, the people who preach layering because it's better than sharding are using the exact same arguments that were used to support sharding when it was introduced.
---
yes. fresh server has no cooldown on ony head for instance
---
Holy shock is a tanking thing anyway. You either use it as a ranged pull or to get back aggro on a job running for your healer.
---
except when the game launches and you have 1000 people per starting zone.
---
This. It's like a year's dose of radiation all at once, so if they were getting that every day or so then wew cancer.
---
&gt; Server merges are for a fraction of servers that got crippled.
---
If you have a server cap of ~4000 players, most servers can turn out "crippled", and those that don't would probably have huge queues for the first month or two.
---
I pick literally almost unplayable

---
The "entire point of a pvp server" is to corpse camp people? I don't like layering either but exaggerating really doesn't help your argument
---
Try being less retarded next time.
---
if you have the OG one with the corehound on it, you're legally obligated to financial compensation.
---
I don't really wanna see kek and pwned either lol, but you definitely have a point. I do feel that stuff like lol, rofl and such are infinitely better because they convey a very specific reaction, whereas Twitch emojis focus on *themselves* rather than the reaction. Like, Kappa. Kappa is amusing to these people *because* Kappa is amusing to these people. It's not a reaction of laughter, impression, or whatever. It's just memeing about memes.
---
The reason we are repeatedly told we need layering is so there wont be any dead servers, implying that once population dwindles after the first phase it wont be so bad when the layers are removed. 
---
If that holds true, you are going to end up with 5x as many resources and half as many players to use them, not to mention the players and guilds who do keep playing will probably all have enough of everything to last the rest of the game, nevermind things like tidals etc. everyone will be fat and fed with epic mounts because the smart, experienced players will abuse the layering system to get ahead and stay ahead.
---
Let me rephrase. Everyone had a role. It was more rock, paper, scissors where classes had strengths and weaknesses against different classes. It forced you to figure out your strengths and weaknesses instead of being able to rely on a stat that that was only useful in PvP.
---
A better solution would be 15$ for both and another option to only get classic for less than 15$, lets say 10$.
---
I see what youre saying, and I know what the person above you said, but it affects a lot of people that didn't choose a less populated server as well.
---
When the servers open, no one will know which ones will be populated or the faction balance of each server until people level up for a while. A lot of people won't even know that faction balance is important until they decide to start taking PvP seriously, which could be after phase 3. Also, faction balance is ever changing. What could have once been a balanced server could see a shift if a guild decides to swap servers or if one faction isn't as skilled as the other and we see a mass exodus. 
---
So while yes, some people may choose to play on a less populated server and then complain about it, most people will be affected by things that are out of their control that X-realm bgs will fix.
---
Good god man you are really leaning hard into the melodramatic diagnosis aren't you.
---
Calm yourself I'm just having fun with you, no need to be so bleak and angry lol.
---
You're right that some people will abuse it, but it's really not as big of an issue as you are making out. If you want to be one of those guys and make a tonne of gold that's your perogative, but you'll hardly "control the AH"
---
I will, but I know others who won't
---
If that’s the case, why not use traditional sharding on starter areas and forget about layering
---
Sure if you're not so in to min maxing and want a bit of RP feel on your char you should definely go dwarf and bear. For me it is just the fact that bear (sadly) is not so great pet compared to cats and wolfs.
---
Nelf shadowmeld is so much fun in world pvp. My very best memory of vanilla is once in Un'Goro with my nelf Hunter. I got in a fight with two horde on delvilsaurs and was able to kill one and just barely got away from another. I ran behind a tree and ordered my pet to stay and left a freeze trap next to it while myself taking few steps back and going shadowmeld. The horde thought I was eating shadowmelded next to my pet and rushed into my trap. I was able to kill them both and got the delvilsaur leather. That was one of most accomplished feelings I've ever got to experience playing video games.
---
Except this time, the whole nochanges crowd seems to defend layering because Blizz can do no wrong
---
Can you find "an empty layer" by remaking characters? I am thinking about the day 1 rush...
---
Currently, its everywhere and is suppose to end in 1-months at phase 2.
---
I'm only talking about the subscription price, not any product prices. If you are gonna answer then atleast talk about the correct stuff instead of bringing up things no one is talking about
---
I dont get why they dont put it on a saturday at like 13:00, just pay the dudes a lil bit as there is literally no point in having a stress test when the majority arent even able to play it.
---
Then again they probably (hopefully) have thought about these things and have reasons for doing what they are doing, but knowing how they reason gear progression and player behavior, its flawed as heck and is crazy how they cant just do whats obvious to so many others like give me a job how the frick do these people have such highpaying cool jobs and yet suck rasberrys at?!?!
---
TLDR: no point in having a stress test when majority cant attend
---
Even private servers, with everyone knowing the farm routes, never had fucked up economies or guilds amassing 8x lotuses to flask a whole damn guild during those first few MC runs.
---
People who support layering have no clue about the nuances of Classic and how big a lead it will give the top guilds that farm it within a week
---
NO GOD! PLEASE GOD NO! NNNNNNOOOOOOOOO
---
oh shit boi you got me hands up!
---
It's not just quitting, it's the initial surge transitioning into more 'reasonable' hours played, and players spreading out on the map.
---
dungeons will be 0 problem, especially groups with with resto druid healers will love that rezz u provide. also raids shouldnt be that big of a problem. i simply dont see why u wouldnt bring at least one enhancer. he can be the nightfall guy and has improved totems for melee. so why not.
---
&gt;Rewards are rare lvls are harder to get, less new abilities.
---
Then classic is not for you. The reason people enjoy classic (well, one of reasons) is that its challenging, and you have to work for your rewards. 
---
If you prefer it to be a bit more casual (which is fine), then retail would be more suited for you.
---
No way.
---
For leveling a warrior either arms or fury is great until L40 then I would go arms for Mortal Strike as it is an extra attack independent of weapons swings, as well as the perfect combo for your WWA or similar 2h. Even when I go fury dps warrior I still go arms at 40 and stay with that until I have some +hit gear for dual-weilding so it isn't a woeful string of misses.
---
For priest absolutely level as shadow!
---
Wait, how does it make someone not a respectful human being because they want to make money from creating content?
---
That's like saying that artists shouldn't be paid for their work because it's "just a hobby." Just because some people do it as a hobby doesn't mean they all have to.
---
I have one from the original release. Just the 'BLIZZARD' logo in blue. I believe it was from the initial wrath release. Prepatch perhaps?
---
I still works, I actually got a pixel 3a last week and *finally* went to the mobile version. Though I will say it has not had extreme use. I've played every blizzard title and WoW expac but certainly didn't play a ton past the initial expansion launches.

---
Thank you for putting in the time to test things.
---
Hopefully. Acct sharing isn't allowed.
---
&gt; Lets actually go through the numbers real quick. Starting with a no  layered 3k pop cap server.  In this case, we are going to say there are  1000 nodes of a given resource This is 0.33 for each person or 3:1. This  is the ratio of available resources to each person. Now lets make this a  layered server at 9k pop, with three 3k pop layers. In this case, there  are now 3000 nodes of that resource but that is still 0.33 for each  person or 3:1. The amount of competitors for each node doesn't change.  Even if you look at those who level really fast, with triple the  population you can expect roughly triple the number of really fast  levelers. Nothing changes! 
---
Right, and what happens when a new layer opens up after 3k pop is passed? You have one layer filled and one layer with a couple of hundred player but with the same "1000" nodes. This is how the system works on beta and by all logic is how it will work on live; when a new layer is formed there is no population redistribution, it is instead a seemingly empty layer with full nodes. 
---
The more major problem is that some people will in fact have access to multiple layers' resources, since entire continents are layered and not just zones there can be 3 layers with different Un'Goro all of which are seemingly empty shortly after release, thus giving a person who knows how to layer hop 3x more spawns, nodes or w/e, even if there is only 1 player spread across 3 different Un'Goro zones
---
SO MUCH of our game time is going to be spent logging in/out to change layers.
---
It’s simply the optimal solution to farming, or when you’re ganked, or when competing for mobs.
---
Logging in/out every 10 mins is NOT classic
---
1. Blizzard can do this easily even if classic was free to play, they are just greedy.
---
2. Keeps children out of the game? Seems like a good way to let classic die in 2 years
---
Dwarves are objectively the class with the strongest big dick energy. 
---
*keep yer feet on th’ ground!*
---
This is looking like they are prepared to shard.... sorry "layer" the entire world.  I thought they were just going to have layering in the start zones?
---
If Blizzard keeps this in the game... they will have proven themselves to be absolutely incompetent.  I cannot imagine a company ignoring their customers this much.   So, I am hopeful this is just testing.
---
I'm sorry but are inexperienced with the game and it sounds like MMO's in general if you think this is only a minor issue. You can play a game of counter-strike in a lobby where everyone is scripting cheats and choose not to, if you have no competitive spirit and you don't mind getting railed off cheaters over and over then I guess you could have fun, personally I wouldn't play.
---
So Blizzard it will only be in the beginning, but how do they stop layering if the servers are still full months after release ?
---
I believe the correct term is 'herd'.
---
How to restrict is the question. It CANNOT be a 100% restriction, this means you couldn't even play with your friends. 
---
5 minutes out of combat? What, lots of options to be sure.

nice idea, made into 0 sense meme....
---
Yep. Layering has turned this thing into a different game. So much time will be spent logging in and out to game layering, instead of, you know, actually playing.
---
Why don't we all guild up and really never raid because we are all playing in weird hours like I will do?
---
There are *still* loads of people on this sub defending layering, or deflecting saying “it’s only a week” even tho it will likely be for a month

I have active sub and also had access to every stress test so far, but not this one.

---
That depends on the player... If a bottle of pepsi costed 7.5$ and a bottle of coke costed 7.5$, and you detested pepsi but had to buy it whenever you bought a coke, would that make a coke only cost 7.5$ when you bought it?

It ain’t gonna change. Release is 2 months out and loads of bugs still exist for classes, Hunter for example is riddled with bugs.
---
They don’t have the time to remove layering at this point.
---
We WILL be getting an inferior product and it will include exploitable layering.
---
Exactly!

And the music was some of my favorite. [Talador](https://youtu.be/fXyH27S_y24), [Spires of Arak](https://youtu.be/GdskCxOYk_I), [Frostfire Ridge](https://youtu.be/LUwoNUN2yFo), and the [remixed WC3 music](https://youtu.be/J0xu9lIwwLA) were just so good. I have good memories of WoD, but I do admit it's because it was the first time I'd played since the start of Cata, on a fresh new account with my friends, and that I only came in right at the end of it, so I didn't really have a lot of time to let all of the problems sink in. Now like none of my friends play anymore.
---
Dude stop trying to undermine this legitimate criticism of a shitty technology, that has no place in classic
---
Big brain blizzard never makes mistakes! :^)
---
&gt; Blizzard can do this easily even if classic was free to play, they are just greedy.
---
They don't have to make classic at all, actually. And since they are a business, they'd be fucking stupid as hell not to charge for it.
---
&gt;Keeps children out of the game? Seems like a good way to let classic die in 2 years
---
I mostly meant you. I'm hoping they keep you out of the game.
---
LOL
---
Global ignore list to the rescue!
---
Every realm had an official forum
---
&gt; I wouldn’t want to merge servers, as I experienced it in the past and it can be very problematic for the community’s health. 
---
Yeah, you're not going to have any community to speak of on a 15k layered server. Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Why not go for mining/BS so you can make that sweet and juicy fire resistant gear for MC?
---
the main issue will be the starting zones. once the playerbase has spread across the levels and zones, they can turn it off. even if they have to leave it on for one or two months, as soon as phase 2 hits (world bosses) they must turn it off, no way around it.
---
15k a server and players STILL prefer dynamic respawn to this layering garbage 
---
Isn’t it funny pservers got it right and Blizz didn’t
---
Not in vanilla wow.
---
Did you read my post, friend? We're basically saying the same thing, I'm defending layering here.
---
But to add some additional analytics to your suggested 60% drop out, https://www.vg247.com/2010/02/11/only-30-of-new-wow-players-continue-after-level-10-says-blizzard/ here Blizzard themselves say how 70% of players don't continue after level 10. Layering will help tremendously regarding this.
---
But dynamic spawning isn't Classic.
---
Of course it makes sense for Blizzard dude, no one is arguing that it doesn't.
---
It's also really weird from a lore perspective when you make a new character. You start off hearing about all this cool shit that happened in the past and... hey wait, why am I now doing all this cool shit that happened in the past?
---
I mean... how do you even think about this stuff LUL
---
They went back on that a long time ago.
---
Character login opened at 11pm in Germany so not quite that early.
---
$15 today is worth less than $15 in 2004.
---
There is your price cut. Now go whine to somebody else.
---
Anyone who plans to play this game to level 60 or raid definitely do not give a fuck about the $15 a month. I can make that much money in about 20 minutes of work.
---
20 minutes of work for a months worth of play time? It's an easy decision.
---
That is exactly what is going to happen with layering anyway since it is continent-wide. If you're concerned about the first two days then you'd probably want to advocate for zone-based sharding, though in my opinion a busy couple of days isn't a big deal in the long term. Avoiding layering is a big deal.
---
If they are that stupid then there is no hope no matter what you do.
---
Not even remotely what I say, I just said random redditors that knows nothing about making a game shouldn't be talking as loud as they do about how to "properly" do Blizzards job. Either you are a prime example of my point or you are just another "Blizzard sucks, amirite???" karmagrabber.
---
Joana/Mancow is pretty pro... Have a look at his page and/or twitch channel.  It's mostly horde but really impressive. He did it in 11hrs 14min. So I think your time is good then
---
r/murderbywords
---
It was in every zone and it was about the X number of mobs in the zone and he specifically called it "Dynamic spawns"
---
&gt;by taking into account he number of players in the area.
---
It works by taking into account the number of mobs being killed, and lowers the respawns to account for it, i cba to find the clip right now but it was on this sub about a month ago.
---
That's just stupid, why didn't they tell us before that, why not let the EU people in? I guess we'll just have to wait for launch in August then
---
[You see, japanese penis so small..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTboGG7DMwU)
---
When you go into a store, do you want to pay more just because you can afford it? You seem like a very poor manager of economy.
---
It was a completely over-exaggerated statement to explain my thoughts on how layering will function. Please don't take what I say out of context like that.
---
nono, its all zones now :)
---
There were people saying Classic would have sharding since day 1, but were scoffed at as pessimists.
---
Now sharding is given another name and everyone takes it for granted.
---
No, everyone see's that, you need an us account with paid gametime (before they rolled out the stress test) to play it. There's dozens of posts about it already.
---
&gt;"It's just beta!"
---
'got some BFA PTSD from that sentence.
---
They probably rolled out the client for all people with wow and limiting the logins by region so no eu rollout.
---
Whatever blizzard decides has a place in classic, does.
---
Honestly I haven't heard any better alternatives, if there are some by all means share.
---
In one sentence you are saying that some people will only play one or the other, so by definition that says that both in one sub is a bad thing. I am arguing on the behalf of those people. Thank you for understanding.
---
Ah I see, thanks for clarifying
---
So much anger from such a small boy. Is your anime body pillow withholding sex from you?
---
So that means servers will have up to 9k people ? Assuming the layers each have a capacity of 3k and that layers will be turned off later, while the population remains full.
---
Oh really? It was so very long ago!
---
Bummer but seeing it pop up did give me more hype
---
Consider yourself part of the reason why Blizzard can get away with these prices.
---
Looks like anime intro
---
&gt;B ) Weigh up the pros and cons of layering. Then get over it like a sane, rational thinking human being and continue to enjoy the experience.
---
A rational thinking person realizes that the cons of layering heavily outweigh the pros.
---
Servers getting underpopulated is a *chance*, and I'm not sure why everyone is assuming it will happen to every server.
---
Layering fucking up community and economy is a guarantee unless it's turned off really quickly.
---
I will happily be part of that reason.
---
People: Never play on release/patch day.
---
Me: plays at first second.
---
The story was horrible though.
---
Not in premade v premade
---
&gt; That is exactly what is going to happen with layering anyway since it is continent-wide. 
---
No, because there's going to be like a 100 layers per server to start with.
---
Very funny, classical joke dude clap clap
---
It's perennially bis.
---
Yes, everything willl be deleted and we go back to the countdown
---
yikes, thanks for informing me, I had no idea
---
i played classic long time ago and i just dont like retail style ( i dont even know about retail mechanics)
---
and i love that rewards require hard working but im not sure is it worth? at first lvls you get huge rewards, new spells, at lvl 20 for example you get a lot of new and strong spells but then what? you need to spend a lot of time for a little reward.
---
this is why im asking. What next, what would happen later on lvl 40-60? what is the reward? i know about mount on lvl 40, and its a great reward .
---
Hi from r/2007scape
---
Can confirm. This "it'll just work out" attitude is a very human thing and easy to fall into. Layering will not just work out though. 
---
 Sometimes I think our species enjoys creating problems that don't need to exist, whether because we want more drama or because we want an obstacle to struggle with.
---
dude do you realize that when WoW launched the launch experience was completely different to how it will be right now? When launch happened it wasn't on server with 10 people it was 2,5k and not everyone crowded the starting zones, which will be the case now. Comparing launch back in 2004 to now is ridiculous and a stupid argument.  
---
Today there HAS TO BE layering in the first zones, or it will be practically impossible to level (conventionally) at launch. 
---
Man people who hate layering have a point but at the same time they are such  drama queens. Yes layering can and will be abused, but it won't ''permanently ruin'' the complete classic experience or even make someone filthy rich. 
---
Monkeynews has said himself that he hopes the servers are ''fucking massive, like 10k people at least''. Everyone wants that, so how the fuck are you supposed to have an enjoyable launch experience without some form of layering?
---
You got it
---
I'd say think about what you want to do at 60. There are several options, one could be double gatherer at 60, in which case just take two gathering professions of your choice.
---
Another way is to think of a crafting profession you want at 60, for example if you want BS then make sure you at least take mining for leveling. You can then either take a secondary gathering profession while leveling and switch it for BS at 60 or you can pick BS and at least get some skill in it before 60. With something like BS or engi you actually get some benefits early on, like gear or gadgets from engi. While it becomes a bit hard to keep up a crafting profession as you get to higher skill it can at least help you early on and will cut down the time needed at 60.
---
It all depends on what you want to do, some want to get max level and grind gear and some just want to take it easy and have fun leveling
---
That's how it works on retail after they changed it a while back I believe.
---
Limit to one week xD
---
I feel that, despite all the issues that can occur, the hype is always real, and the atmosphere on discord will be awesome!
---
H
---
jesus christ that is really bad thanks for taking the time to type it out for retards like me and the guy you replied to.
---
Nah, ud is fine and even better in premades. Orc racial only shines in pugs or wpvp
---
&gt; Back then not every server had a place outside of the game to communicate. Nowadays there'll probably be a semi-official forum for each. Not looking forward to witchhunts.
---
Blizzard realm forums were a thing in Vanilla.
---
They changed their mind about how loot-sharing worked, so it’s possible they’ll realize that this is a terrible solution as well. If we’re getting queues no matter what, then let’s get them straight away instead of two weeks later. Why cater to the tourists?
---
Im thinking about making an addon that will just put everyone who spams that on ignore tbh.
---
You go into a x-ray like once every few years when you are sick. Some people never need it. A doctor does this every day multiple times. That‘s why they need to protect themselves. It‘s a quantity thing. But yeah your joke is still not bad :P
---
thats the one me and my other half have, a friend got the for us as he is super paranoid about account security, and it come with a mount or pet cant remember which.
---
retail players have been on the sub for a while now, ever since they realized they couldn't get the project cancelled.
---
Concurrent player numbers on Nostalrius grew from 4k at launch to 12k over time.
---
You can activate Windows while you wait
---
The real reason: Blizzard took many inspirations from Lord of the Rings obviously, and they said they were brainstorming what would happen when you died. Someone brought up how it looks whenever Frodo tosses the ring on. A creepy, windy, and ominous spirit plane. Everyone agreed.
---
He's delusional
---
I wouldnt charge you 10$ for the burgers aswell, just like Blizzard would do. But if the consumers actually thought that was unreasonable, I would have to go lower. Why do you think I'm talking about the subject? Trying to make people informed here dude, I can't do it on my own so please support my case!
---
Holy shit its like you purposefully only look at sharding / layering from your perspective and because its ''practically the same thing it must mean there were no changes to the code''. How ignorant can you come across? I don't even work with code and I realise that when you try to make you code do something slightly different and whole list of new bugs / errors will occur.
---
I had an alliance Rogue and horde Druid that made it to 60 in retail vanilla.  And then a bunch of random alts that never made it out of the 30’s.  Every time a new batch of servers would get released and I’d get excited and roll a new char.  I’d get to 19, do some WSG and then fizzle our by the low 20’s typically. 
---
The Rogue was my first character made on launch day and what my main was for the first half of Vanilla.  I rolled the Druid right around the time ZG launched and pretty much played that character exclusively for the rest of Vanilla right on through the first tier of raiding in Cata. 
---
For Classic, I’ll likely get 3 characters to 60 - Mage, Druid, Warrior or Rogue and just play whatever I feel like playing when I log in.
---
90% is more likely. 
---
I think it was around the same in retail wow. most players don't make it to level 10.
---
I could see enhancement being decent if you play your raids heavy on the supporting side; totem-twisting in a warrior/rogue group (casting Windfury totem for the weapon buff, then casting Grace of Air for ~7 seconds for the agi buff so they overlap), and using a Nightfall to boost caster DPS.
---
Exploit early, exploit often.
---
Your arms tree looks solid, I personally prefer to max 2h specialization just to have added versatility in swapping weapons as I level. It's fine to level axe spec (especially so with WW axe being good for a while), but just a personal choice.
---
Assuming MS at 40, your fury tree looks alright, Booming voice is more useful for BGs than world-PvP or leveling due to duration not really mattering while leveling (As uptime on Battle Shout should always be 100% anyways). Unbridled Wrath isn't particularly great (honestly, none of the early fury choices really are) for 5 points for a 40% chance to generate an extra rage point, but that small amount of extra generated rage would likely equate to faster leveling than increased duration on demo / battle shouts (even with a 2H and not dual wielding).
---
I personally like 5/5 in imp battle shout while leveling, assuming those are your 50-55 points, if you want you can drop a point into piercing howl as it is useful to daze enemies that are running and aren't hamstrung, just added utility.
---
Blood Craze is decent, but between it and imp battle shout, it comes down to just what do you want, more damage or more "sustain". It's not terrible, but assuming you'll be bandaging and eating between mobs anyways, I prefer battle shout.
---
Again though, it is just your last 20 points after getting Mortal Strike, arms is good enough regardless of where you dump the remaining points 20
---
I came here for this
---
The funny thing is, I look back at the first couple of weeks of WoD more fondly than any other expansion after TBC. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that was the first expansion where flying wasn't immediately available after dinging max level, so I really enjoyed the sense of being in a world again. The dungeons were fun, the Garrison was fairly interesting (at first) and Ashran had its moments. I got bored fairly quickly, but I enjoyed the first few weeks immensely.
---
I really loved how challenging cata was at the beginning. Dungeons you had to sap/sheep in and pay attention. Sadly they nerfed them pretty quickly :/ still the golden Era of demo locks. Or maybe just the mop patch I can't recall.
---
Monkeynews is doing god's work. Abuse this shit like no tomorrow.
---
You actually think that switching layers is a bug?
---
Because the tourists are still paying a sub, same as you, and blizz needs them to stick around - which they won't if they can't even log in for weeks.
---
&gt;Or won’t history repeat itself you think?
---
Quite the opposite - players are much more aware of what is meta and way more min/max minded that they used to. Playing a "unviable" spec is going to be harder this time around, but as always you can make it work simply form the social aspect. Make friends, be helpful in a guild and you can get a spot in most casual raids. If you are helping people and are nice in general people will enjoy playing with you and who cares if a few out of 40 players in a raid are sub-optimal.
---
It will probably also help a lot if you are flexible in your playstyle, so don't just go "I want to stormstrike the shit out of the boss!", but at least learn what playstyle as a 2H enh will benefit the raid the most. If 39 other people are inviting you to raid with them despite not being that strong of a spec, at least try to get the best out of what you play. Not too well known with vanilla enh, but I think a totem weaving playstyle is the best use for the raid, so maybe "bite the bullet" and play that even if it isn't the most fun (or maybe you will enjoy it, who knows).
---
and layering is?
---
;0
---
Can’t go back on something that was never promised.
---
They said that they would *like* to have it that way, but they were going to look into it.
---
It was never, *ever* explicitly stated or promised that that was the way they were going to do it.
---
Don’t be disingenuous.
---
That’s the in-game voice chat control, most still use Discord or Teamspeak.
---
Is this video actually from 2005? I mean at some point in the last 15 years he’s adapted to using key bindings right??
---
He's looking for community, Retail is not the place to go
---
Which is exactly how I intend to play it!
---
They would both be green in cat form at least because of the buff that gives AP + agility in cat form
---
It’s kinda sad that the music in Deathknell is the same as this
---
Spot on. I tried a 3rd, maxed it out but invariably found i could only play 2.
---
You face two major problems in my opinion. First your spec was never designed to be raid DPS in vanilla. Back then the developers were satisfied when each class had at least one viable spec. For shamans that was restro. That leads us to the second problem; shaman tier sets are made for healers and later on for elemental too. 
---
In practice you will have to fight both rogues and warriors over leather dps gear because there are only a limited amount of mail physical dps items(you can not wear hunter tier pieces).
---
While windfury totem is amazing no dps warrior or rogue will want 'their' BiS gear 'stolen' by a shaman =&gt; they will not invite you to their 5mans. 
---
Your best bet is to find a group of friends to play with. In a casual 40 man raiding guild social engineering is often more important than just dps numbers. 
---
However, if you HATE ever playing restro you are making your gearing process difficult. It common for paladins and shamans to go healer while collecting off set pieces dps pieces.
---
I'm all for layering too, tbh. But I'm under the impression that layering is Blizzard's version of clusters, only slightly more hidden? Instead of Dragontooth 1,2 and 3 etc. We have Dragontooth - Layer 1, 2 and 3, which will eventually merge when the playercount drops.
---
I refuse to believe it!
---
Lower player cap on servers and add more servers?
---
You are aware that if a layer exists, it has similar populations in it. You won’t just find an empty layer with unspoiled resources in it.
---
God.. I feel.. I feel like I’ve said this many, many times before. It’s like dejavu
---
I dislike you for it
---
Difference being they’ve stated and reinforced that layer is temporary and will be removed as soon as possible.  End of phase 1 being the absolute latest.  That’s a pretty massive difference and why I’m not against layering, her despise sharding.
---
WoD and Legion were god awful expansions.
---
You sure about that? My understanding is that layers are continent-wide and that there is no zone-based distribution below that level.
---
At first there was about 10 servers, after a few minutes they put out that message and shut down all but 2 of them.
---
What? Fuck off
---
I never compared it to the vanilla launch, only you did.
---
You're right, blizzard statements are never promises and can change wildly over time. They also like to make it a little vague so that they can pretend they never said it at all, like how they say a few weeks but mean months or a year, like with legion flying.
---
Excellent use of percentages instead of using acutual times to show the difference, you must work marketing. Ony kill times is measured in seconds or any of the others are just minutes. I enjoy the fact we're at the top even considering we never speed killed Ony. We stopped raiding 4th week of AQ never disbanded.
---
Loved reading this, thanks for sharing. Made me want to relieve my first time even more. Wish we could forget stuff.
---
Regarding the empty cities : it's a stress test, limited in level. You bet people are low levels, trying to rush to the max available levels to decide which class to play. If you do that, there's no real point to visit the capital cities. It's going to be VERY different when the game actually releases, especially in the areas with the banks and auction houses
---
To add on to your comment. Layering *must* be removed by the end of phase 1 because it disrupts the world boss spawns for the bosses being added. 
---
So it’s temporary. The handwringing is getting ridiculous, and we have a whole new round of armchair experts coming in after experiencing the stress test.
---
That is awesome. We tried to implement the line on that exact quest but nobody listened. I want to play with those peeps!
---
I'm afraid of something with layering. Even if the 15k people are separated into 3k layers, we'll still have 3k people sharing the starting zones. The launch will be an absolute hell if we have 500 people / starting area.
---
Imagine bitching about something you'd only see if you download an addon... If you think those are worse than the kinda random shit that gets spewed in trade and world you're delusional. You honestly see more people bitching about this kinda shit and talking about it than people actually doing it.
---
right they would need to seperate chat too
---
I'd add Paladins to the list as well. Most paladins level as Ret and the ret tree has an 8% speed boost as well, which let's you enchant your boots with something else.
---
You earn 45$/hour? Impressive.
---
well first off you gotta download an addon to see them... and secondly you can right click and ignore people in game... wooo weee
---
And you have right to do that. Nonetheless i hope you have a nice day.
---
Did you even read what I said? You said that layering and sharding is practically the same thing so barely any code was changed. Even if barely any code was changed (I'm pretty sure a lot of code was changed) you could still have a shit ton of bugs and errors. It's not as simply as saying simply tweaking it and everything will be fine. Even if the code runs fine, real world testing can also reveal unintended consequences (e.g: check the video)
---
Where do I say that switching layers is a bug? Just because layering is works the way it does right now, does not mean it is ''intended'' for the final release?
---
Go horde in that case so you do no fight undead with wotf. Both spreists and warlock are great at duels when played well.
---
Lol wow. 
---
If you’re this jaded, why bother playing?
---
Whataboutism? If they had it then, why not now?
---
If you look at the screenshots, the Classic values are about 75% of the private server values for bear form, and 87% for dire bear form and cat form.
---
Though it could also be a level difference, because the cat form and dire bear form screenshots are at level 40 while the bear form screenshot is at level 15. And since the difference is smaller at level 40 than it is at level 15, there's a possibility that at level 60 they deal the correct amount of damage and it's just the level scaling that is wrong.
---
Fair enough, you didn't.
---
No, it means private servers got something wrong.... again. Not that its nerfed in the real version of the game
---
A balance druid is geared for having int and probably spirit on to of spell power (or whatever it used to be called, I always mix the terms), so it's better to have a balance druid heal, theoretically.   
---
However if a druid is feral/resto (0/31/20), and also has a healing set (which they likely will with that spec), then their healing performance should be mostly the same, as they likely take the same path in the resto tree after their main tree anyway.
---
This has a “show me what you got” sort of vibe
---
I never even got around to maxing my second alt out. Hunter as my main. Came to Vanilla late, so only got my priest to 30 by the time TBC came about. Rolled a Draenei Paladin but it took ages to get him to 62 because I raided with my main.
---
And then life got the better of me and I stopped playing at the very end of TBC.
---
Jesus Christ...
---
The reward is the journey, the reward is getting better (just because you're not learning new skills youi're still getting talent points and getting new gear), the reward is doing challenging dungeons to gear up for raiding, the reward is doing gathering or crafting, the reward is competing with other players in PVP, etc.
---
Honestly, there's plenty of fun to be had. If you're not enjoying what i listed above, then it could really be that WOW (or MMORPGs in general) are not for you.
---
What do you enjoy about wow? What do you enjoy about other MMORPGS? What is missing for you that you're trying to find?
---
Was just asking you to clarify on that before I commented further. it's working as intended until the community complains and they do something about it. The beta has been out for over a month if they were going to do something about it they would have came out and said so. But here we are getting closer and closer to release.
---
Is it an "unfair" advantage if they grinded for it though? I mean, you too could blitz to 60 and do the same thing.
---
Why does it matter if something was overtuned on a fake version of the game?
---
If you are so lucky to end up in the same guild as me, then I think you would take that back.
---
so you wait a day and try again? 
---
is it worth it to you to kill the economy of the game so you can level comfortably day 1?
---
Starting a Stress-Test at EU primetime but not letting EU players participate... seems logical!
---
I am not sure what you mean. In classic shadowmeld can not be used in combat. It can be used to drink while melded through. Which isn't possible for rogue stealth in classic.
---
I found something in the WoWWiki about a faster spawn rate (5min =&gt; \~1min) but outside of it i didn't really find any evidence of it. Still, it seems i was wrong, mb.
---
I have this reddit post / youtube video from Tips about dynamic spawn but according to him it only started in BC ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7siyd7/dynamic\_spawning\_lets\_talk\_about\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7siyd7/dynamic_spawning_lets_talk_about_it/) )
---
If you manage to find your source i'd greatly appreciate it.
---
and separate whispers from separate friends on separate real- i mean layers?
---
Filthy traitor!
---
This is completely false. 
---
Layers are *created* as needed and removed as populations fluctuate. *You will not see empty layers*. If you are layered, there will be similar populations in them.
---
VaNiLlA iS hArD
---
I put this up before the screenshot was placed, but it's not loading in a good resolution on my phone so thanks for writing the differences out, hopefully you're right about the level scaling.
---
&gt;dont play druids, they are neither offensive nor good healers, they suck at everything except mobility
---
Mobility as a healer in PvP is arguably the strongest aspect you can possibly have, depending on *which kind of PvP.*
---
For world PvP, either solo or in a small group I'd say druid is extremely strong. You can force enemies to either try and catch you, which they won't be able to, or they can focus on your teammates and you can freecast. For solo wPvP they are also strong enough, especially as a resto/bala hybrid spec.
---
They are also almost mandatory in WSG due to being the best flag carriers and they are used quite well as a node defender in AB, probably among the best aside from a hunter and rogue. Their mobility, reju and bear makes them ideal for keeping the node safe until backup arrives.
---
It is different playstyles, more "niche" roles and less "simply a healer", but if you play them in their right element they are way stronger than any other healer.
---
I cant tell if this is a troll post that goes even further beyond, or if its real
---
Considered it. However i also tried to play Alliance (im always horde) on P servers etc, and it always just felt... wrong.
---
I get the whole "see other side" thing, but it just doesnt sit well. Its like that little itch at the back of your head that you just cant reach. Everything is fine but something's just not quite right.
---
In the end i said "fuck it, lok'tar ogar!".
---
The difference is in who you'll be playing with. With Clusters, you're on Dragontooth 2 and so are the other people on Dragontooth 2. You'll never be on anything other than Dragontooth 2 (until the merge) and so you can develop meaningful relationships with your community since they are the only people you'll see. To me this is a remarkable advantage over layering and the best way to deal with unpredictable population.
---
Yeah someone else pointed out it's different in vanilla. I thought it functioned that way in tbc so assumed close enough.
---
Alliance racials really weren't as good back in vanilla (humans too) but I wasn't a serious player then, that all started in tbc.
---
the average player can play retail, then.
---
A large downside to clusters are how little flexible they are compared to layers. Many concurrent players today? Automatically add more layers. Or maybe there are few people playing today? Automatically reduce the number of layers. With clusters it seems like this would be hard to do. Let's say you start on cluster #7 a saturday because the others are full, then after the weekend cluster #7 only has a few hundred players. Will you then merge #6 and #7? What if a lot of people log on during the next weekend, will you unmerge them again, or have queue times? 
---
Not trying to be an ass here, just playing the devil's advocate.
---
This. Been playing some on Northdale to see what class I want to level. Any early human zone is nearly unplayable and this is with private servers turning up dynamic respawns. Dwarf areas are a bit better. I hear Night Elf areas are pretty good, but then people start going there to escape the craziness. 
---
Layering early will be a good thing. If the demand for Classic WoW tapers off a lot in the first month or so, they can scale that back.
---
I'll take queues over layering any day of the week
---
Great reply. If you think I'm wrong riddle me this, why does the same game cost less in China than it does in France?
---
That kind of treachury can't be tolerated. Once a Horde, always a Horde. For the Hordeance!!! Wait what....
---
I wasn’t arguing that either, I said that I would be happy to get 5 maccas burgers for the price of an ice cream cone. 
---
I also said what blizzard has done makes sense to me, as in I think the product offered has good value, you get a sub to both modern and classic wow for the price of just a modern wow sub. 
---
It’s hard to argue that the product doesn’t have a high value for money. 
---
The thing is mate in 2004 you paid 15 bucks to play classic wow, in 2019 you’ll pay 15 bucks to play classic wow, however this time you’ll get modern wow for free! 
---
Think of it this way, you’re getting a free stubby cooler with your carton of piss, you were buying the beer anyway, just a bonus you get the free stubby cooler to put that beer in. You’re not going to ask the person working at the liquor store to give you a discount because you don’t want the cooler, that’s not how this works. 
---
While you drink your beer think about how ridiculous your proposal is.
---
A perhaps helpful question to ask yourself would be - what do you like about the Horde?
---
No experience in MMO, no idea of game mechanics, no access to guide or else and english was not my native language.
---
What about actually inviting EU then?
---
Same. I lost mine while moving.
---
This^ nothing is ever nerfed from private servers, they should never be used as a measuring stick for what classic should be, because they got half of the stuff wrong
---
It is for the stress test,  not trolling
---
Where do I donate
---
Haha
---
yes, but even though the beta has been out for a month does not mean they were able to test everything related to layering with the current beta population. These stress tests exist to get closer and closer to fixing these problems. Just because it hasn't been fixed yet doesn't mean they aren't working on it. 
---
If by phase 2 or even by the middle of phase 1 layering is still around, I will be pissed. However, until that happens all we can do is show the problems with layering and let blizzard work on it. Unlike the OP this post who is going around ''tHe EcOnOmy WiLl Be RuInEd I wIlL FaRm 20K GoLd''. That's never going to happen, and anybody who has studied a tiny bit of economics realise that that's not how markets work.
---
Or it saves you those points in the ret tree for other talents :D
---
Nostalgia. Always played it
---
Without the addon you'll see whatever slashed or bracketed shortcodes are being replaced by the icons.
---
Youre right!!
---
This may have just made me decide!
---
People may base their decisions for Classic based off of their experiences with a private server. This post might alleviate some frustration in those people.
---
I used questie during the stress tests, worked great.
---
Just go into the interface/adding folder like you do in retail and place the add ones in the folder.
---
Collecting is what you do with your main anyway, so why bother past 35?
---
Doesn’t mean that can’t it shouldn’t work to improve the system so that it isn’t so easily a usable during the time that it’s in the game tho.
---
Just make it so players are auto assigned their layer upon logging in and have to manually switch layers (right click portrait —&gt; layer —&gt; choose layer), but can only do so in a rest area on a 5 minute CD.  Combat, and gathering trigger the 5 min CD as well.  
---
This change alone solves the majority of abusable issues with the system.  Will it be 100% fool proof?  No, but it would definitely be less abusable than what’s currently in place.
---
pretty sure.  It might not be a 100.  They'll duplicate an entire continent, instead of just a zone.  It might not be very resource efficient at first, but I wouldn't see why they couldn't do it.
---
Exactly,  to many people use it as a measure of what classic is "getting wrong"
---
Only a sign that no one who's still subscribed on retail is interested in Classic, which is fine. Yet stupid of Blizz to not make this stress test publicly available.
---
I had a 60 pally and a 60 rogue in vanilla. Played them both, made the entire experience that much better.
---
Our species also has a brain capable of critical thinking and solving problems before they arise.   
---
In the case of launch there is no 1 right way to go about it. There is no "solution". Just trade offs. There are downsides to layering just as there are downsides to having a conventional launch with no safeguards in place to help ease que times and server habitability. Pick your poison.
---
What is your reasoning that people will leave? As you said, a private server with no layering had top guilds amassing a lot of flask materials. Maybe I don't get it, but I laugh at these guilds posting about Classic WoW groups to be Top 50 MC on 14-year-old content and talking about taking 3 weeks vacation during launch to join the guild.
---
Why would I end up in the same guild as you if you're not going to agree to pay the sub fee? I wont even see you.
---
You're not planning to *waste* your money on that $15 monthly sub are you? Cause you just so clearly stated why it's overpriced and not worth it. I can't see why you'd take that stance but also shell out the money. 
---
What happened to the principle of the matter?
---
Considering you'll be against 7 other Shaman for tier pieces and rolling against all the healers for cloth gear, maybe not the best choice.
---
But that's not the escape key...
---
Main (Undead Mage) that I'll only really play when my friend (Undead Priest) will be on - we'll be levelling all the way together like back in the old days.  
---
1 alt (probably Rogue or Hunter, still undecided) for when he's not online/busy.
---
Vanilla wow was 15$ in 2004 and still is in 2019 would be an argument I would use to show the unreasonable price, but you somehow think it's an argument that supports how reasonable it is.
---
Next time you reply, don't write a wall of text about information everyone already knows.
---
I joined the RP server first, was sad they took it down. The two they left up were packed with people.
---
Yesterday I was questing a little bit through Barrens on my mage and somebody has asked me through a whisper whether I want to join a WC run. I've said hell yea and accepted the invite after I've killed a pack of three Kul Tiran marines in those towers south of Ratchet. As soon as I've accepted the invite I got into apparently their layer with three enemies standing there and immediately killing me.
---
This moment alone was so crushing for me. My hopes into a cool Vanilla experience fell down just as fast as my HP while being beaten by three NPCs.
---
But I'm outraged and offended
---
VVS
---
5 man grp for elite Q.
---
grp leadet still far away, others waiting in front of elite Q.
---
 One persong gets ganked, others can't help because they are not in the same layer, becaus grp leader is still on is way.
---
so instead of people avoiding ganks, you would make it harder to counter gank.
---
Not surprising it was poorly advertised I only found out through friends yesterday. It’s also the third stress test and people are probably tired of spending their night on something that’s not permanent. I logged in and did my 1-10 but have no real desire to log back in before it wipes
---
TRUE LULW
---
No it doesn't, it is only usable outside of combat like stealth. It isn't until WotLK you can use it to leave combat.
---
no it doesn't, there is no pop redistribution when a new layer is created. There can be differences in layer population
---
Tough to counter it. But then, what *made* you play Horde back then?
---
Also, I'd guess you're playing blood elves mostly? Saying that you don't like Classic Horde models.
---
I much prefer dynamic spawns over layers, sure.
---
awesome, thanks for the reply
---
Imagine being this guy 😂👌 👌
---
POG
---
Closer to $35 an hour but I also make commission which varies.
---
But, I mean, I paid for my own WOW sub at $15 a month when I was making $7.50 an hour working minimum wage and I didn't worry about it then.
---
Yeah I don’t know if he could have possibly put that worse lol
---
I feel attacked
---
This seems like an abuse of game mechanics to me. I would be careful about doing something like this (assuming it isn't fixed by launch). I wouldn't be surprised if they issued out temporary bans to anyone who hardcore abused layer hopping.
---
IIRC Blizzard said one reason there are problems with many players in the same zone on modern servers is their ability system is much more intensive than it was in Vanilla.
---
It’s a game. Have fun and don’t overthink it. ;-)
---
Assuming the addon will be popular (Hopefully not in EU), I'd prefer to not see OMEGALUL or Pepegas at the end of sentences as well.
---
I completely agree with you.    
---
I hate it in Retail it's all about your account now, not about the character you make.     
---
It's not different from playing Destiny or The Division. To others you are someone playing a video game, not a character in a virtual world.    
---
To answer your question, I'm most definitely gonna have a bank alt but I might have one lowbie when I get close to max lvl just to chill.
---
If it were bereft of any meaning it wouldn't be used to convey any meaning in the first place.
---
True vanilla experience for many people on populated servers. Things will even out eventually with time.
---
Same. The RP is pretty cool and welcoming, even if you aren’t an RPer. I’ve decided to roll on an RP server. The RP server will probably also have less people. I do hope they decide on an RP PVP option though.
---

---
Here are some I could find, he calls it overspawn in both clips so maybe I was wrong about him specifically calling dynamic respawns or I just can't find it right now, either way the way he describes it is essentially the same thing; the more mobs being killed the shorter the respawns.
---
I've had some difficulty deciding between Orc Hunter that I always play, and Night Elf hunter that I like but never really played, nor have I ever played the alliance side fully.
---
So I'll be playing both, on two different servers, until I pick one or the other. I'm in no hurry anywhere, I let the fun factor decide.
---
&gt;And you do basically the same as you did in the beggining
---
Indeed, you still stare at the screen while pressing buttons and moving your mouse.
---
I mean idk, it's difficult to answer such questions.
---
Are you from anywhere other than NA/OCE?
---
If so, that's why. EU / Asia aren't included in this stress test.
---
That's 100% wrong. Single-instance realms are the most expensive cause you have to maintain the instances even at low pop while the others can just be merged seamlessly and free up those resources.
---
This must get fixed
---
That's great but they've wasted an opportunity this time round because they really didn't think through going live at 2pm for US, when it would be around 10-11pm (aka prime gamer time) for EU.
---
There's only so many stress tests between now and August, so as much real time data as possible should be gathered, and they/we don't get that by not thinking timezones etc. through.
---
It pissed off a lot of EU players in the first instance (excuse the pun), and to then not have the expected levels of players logging on felt like a bit of a kick in the teeth imo.
---
Just needed a little more upfront planning to make the most
---
(Yes I'm also throwing my toys out as I'm EU based (for now, Brexit n all that..))
---
&lt;Whisper&gt; You are the bomb! &lt;/Whisper&gt;
---
Humans the worst choice if you literally have zero interest in raiding. 
---
Dwarf is the best Rogue race for PvP. Stoneform changes your match up potential against Warriors enough to matter a lot. Let's you use vanish when you otherwise wouldn't be able to.
---
Gnomes are fine too. Escape Artist is good but stoneform is better.
---
This will be authentic vanilla for me. We had a Chinese foreign student guild on our realm, so general chat often had people apparently saying nothing. Actually made other messages stand out.
---
DoT dmg also tags the mob but only until the initial tick. So if SW:Pain ticks ever 3 secs the dmg would start on the 3 sec tick rather than instantly when the mob is afflicted by SW:Pain.
---
I think using this add-on would actually make the chat more readable, because otherwise you'd be seeing rapidly scrolling walls of text. It could use an opacity slider though, to make them blend in with background (or make them invisible).
---
hi slob. try washing your hands once in a while. bye slob.
---
I wonder if what’s in this image means maybe we are getting one?
---
Two ways that has been common on private servers has been to reserve the ace of beast from UBRS or reserving orbs in strat, but usually it's the tanks that get to reserve the orbs.
---
How big is the ignore list with classic?
---
I appreciate the skepticism.
---
Flexibility: My priority is a sense of truth. I want to be on a server with the same people. It worked fine in Vanilla. At noon population levels were normal, it was busy in the evening, and at 3 AM I'd have a zone mostly to myself. The hours reflected the activity of the players on the server and it felt natural. 
---
Merges: you'd be using line graphs to chart activity over a span of time. When you see consistently low-ish (perhaps 2,000 peak simultaneous logins within 24 hours) populations on two Segments within the cluster you merge them.
---
Did you remove the option to display addons in a list?  
---
I'm sure that used to be available on your website but I cannot for the life of me figure out how I did it. Now, I can only view them in a Grid layout.
---
This sub seems heavily biased towards the more hardcore (and try hard) part of the community. Furthermore, remember that guilds that are planning their roaster months before the game even released might also generally be more serious than many guilds that will form once the game is actually out.
---
You can even just go to the Discord channels for guilds and you'll see many guilds just doing stuff like 2h 2 days a week and even 1 day per week raiding guilds.
---
It will be easy enough to find a guild that suits people with less time because a large amount of players have full time jobs, a wife, maybe even kids - there are so many players that won't have time to dedicate themselves fully, so they will naturally band together and raid at their own pace.
---
Not really. You need to play 40m a day to get to 60 in /9 days played  ;-)
---
I dont even care for stresstest anymore. No Beta inv, no Support from my side.
---
On the contrary, what other Boot enchant is worth sacrificing 2 talents points for?
---
I'd argue 2% parry, or perhaps Vindication, are both superior to getting a flat +70 health for 2 talent points.
---
I want to play horde so I can play shaman. Not sure if my friends will be up for rolling horde though.
---
Also I care more about racials now and the only race that looks good in the game has the worst racials. I've always been more NE than Alliance so if I am not NE it doesn't matter as much.
---
&gt; Vanilla wow was 15$ in 2004 and still is in 2019 would be an argument I would use to show the unreasonable price, but you somehow think it's an argument that supports how reasonable it is.
---
Because $15 today is more like $10 back then. So if we adjust for inflation:
---
Vanilla Wow: $15 monthly sub by 2004 inflation.
---
Classic Wow: $10 monthly sub by 2004 inflation.
---
Ergo: Classic Wow, due to inflation, is effectively $5 cheaper a month than Vanilla WOW.
---
In conclusion: Classic WOW is a price cut, from original Vanilla WOW, in regards to subs.
---
Look at all the people agreeing with you lol
---
I can get behind that. Thanks for the explanation
---
Just skip layering blizzard, you can afford more hardware, no reason to cheap out.
---
I can related to everything you have said, killing Arthas off also killed a lot of the spirit of the game. He was such an iconic figure and the world was quite literally developed around him in Vanilla. Also, I got the exact same feeling when I used LFG it PUG Deathwing.....It felt totally unrewarding to be fighting this bigass dragon, when all I had to be do be eligible was click a singular button. Then in the raid there were several people AFK for the whole raid. Had I actually worked up to the raid boss with a build, then I expect it would have been fun and a sense of achievement. But just being given it on a plate......na, that was a horrible experience.
---
&gt; To others you are someone playing a video game, not a character in a virtual world.
---
Yep, thats what Im talking about mostly. This feeling of not being someone in Azeroth, but rather being an IRl player with an assortment of characters at his disposal. Chilling alt is something im also definately gonna do
---
if only they weren't trying to find a way to boost sub numbers for BFA .....
---
we don't know that yet. server population has been not just a game design decision but a technological limitation in the past. I'm gonna assume that they will let way more than 9000 players roll on a server since a good chunk will quit early on.
---
in regards to layer capacity, that's exactly what they are trying to figure out with the stress tests.

Not true. Kappa for example is a great word by itself cause it indicates sarcasm so you wont have to say "i aM jUsT bEiNg sArCAstiC" like an idiot. Its much shorter and better.

MoP is the most underrated xpac out there IMO, I enjoyed it a lot.
---
Many guides are based on the private server values. Should be important if you consider rolling a cat druid.
---
Because sharding will only be available for the first content patch.
---
Well it's weird to reply to me asking what they say about mc with 2 sniplets period. Maybe they talked about other stuff more  mc is not the only stuff in the title so it's not entirely unthinkable that this is the only stuff in the 1.5 hour podcast about MC.
---
you also have to cobsider viable leveling areas. 3 startzones per faction into , etc. Horde has the "issue" that barrens is a megazone for 3 races .  But after 20 you can always do dungeons if the overworld is overcrowded
---
The highest I've played an alt was to nearly 30 or 30 to park that alt in Desolace so I could gather Grave Moss. I've been raiding a lot in Vanilla and I had no time to level anything. The first time I had a second max level character was deep into TBC for me.
---
NO
---
I'm gonna play a hunter, i dont care one bit about other peoples opinions, its about me enjoying myself while playing the game.
---
I think a disc priest or a rogue would be best

Thanks! I’ll check that and report back.

I mean, when it comes down to any spell-rotation in a PVE enviroment... they all are pretty stale.
---
The thing is, it actually made the game feel like a joke....
---
A large number of people are basing their class choices off the data available.. and the only data we have available is from private servers.
---
This news matters because many people considering rolling a feral Druid (based on available data) now have a reason to reconsider.
---
I mean I'll watch a 10 minute video or 20 and even just listen to it in the background while playing but 1.5hours is quite a commitment
---
Back then, we had our "lol", "kek" and "bur" and we liked it!

all the more reason for me and many others to skip classic altogether!
---
Only US have access to stress test
---
I wouldn't think either of those are against TOS, the only thing I've ever run into is sharing one account with two people. Even then they didn't really do anything about it.
---
I bought the dongle day 1 when it had the blizzard logo on it. Worked great for 2 years until it died. It was absolute hell getting blizzard to remove it.
---
Bought another one that featured a corehound and it must be 6-7 years? Still works like a champ.
---
U can bind the symbols in the keybindings tab can you not?
---
I feel like this has become a meme, more than actual reality. I enjoyed WoD and raiding Highmaul etc. and I liked the areas.
---
Nightelves get starshards as a counter point to devouring plague
---
I wouldn't say so, modern wow is so extremely far from vanilla. The classes plays nothing alike and honestly, many specs in modern WoW don't even have the same class fantasy (theme) as in vanilla. For example, combat rogue have been made into outlaw, a pirate themed spec in modern wow, survival hunter is a melee spec in modern wow, feral druids had their spec split into feral (cat) and guardian (bear). Aside from these which are complete overhauls of specs, even those that share somewhat of a theme are not great indicators. In modern wow they really refined the themes and it might actually make you think they are cooler than they are in vanilla. For example, assassination rogue in modern wow makes you think you are this cool assassin using a ton of poison and bleeds to wear down the enemy, but in classic it's nothing like that.
---
The only thing that it can help with is the very general idea of most specs. Normally I'd not recommend it, but since you don't have experience with MMO's you might at least get some feeling of core things you like, for example if you like melee or ranged the best, or what role (tank, healer, dps) you prefer.
---
Where you were not allowed to name and shame, so not relevant to the topic of blacklisting. Thanks for being the x'd person to bring this irrelevant reply up.
---
Considering the 8% speedboost applies to your mount speed as well, it's just better.
---
Indeed.
---
Blizzard knows what they are doing.
---
They have been running servers for a long time.
---
Where you were not allowed to name and shame, so not relevant to the topic of blacklisting. Thanks for being the x'th person to bring this irrelevant reply up.
---
we get it dude, you're a carefree butterfly
---
yes I know but it's written beta so I thought maybe I got beta access now ? last time it was written stresstest on it
---
But is that in the raiding rotation? Only if there is a debuff spot I'd guess?
---
It was literally handed on a plate to anyone who just signed up to LFG. It was a total disappointment. Had you needed to advance to that point as a guild and fight through a raid instance like MC, and the fight be harder, it might have been o.k.....As it stands, it was more like a lobby game you would play while waiting for a real game.
---
My first dongle died in 2 years. Replaced it immediately (after waiting a week for blizzard to remove the first one) and it's been 6-7 years at least and it still turns on with no problems.
---
No I didnt like the Pandas and if thats wuat youre maliciously taking from my post I don't think there's a point in having this conversation
---
I want to play Paladin so I gotta roll alliance. That being said I haven’t played retail since 2011
---
Most of the bosses are slightly more involved than just tank and spark, but they aren’t nearly as intricate as what you find in modern WoW raiding.
---
I am willing to raid and play after lvl 60 so I wont be totally casual. But I dont want to have a super hard time getting items from raids. I also want to have a good pvp class. what would your recommendation be ? (playing on horde)
---
I would love to play rogue but I thought its hard to get items in raids, same with mage and warrior.
---
I raid naxx on a pserver with 4 hunters an enhancement (nightfall)  shaman and a druid off tank. 
---
Were over halfway through now after a few weeks. Not all pserver people are 'hardcore min maxers', whatever you interpret that to be.
---
I suspect they got the level 60 value right (the level 60 values got way more attention, documentation, videos, etc, than anything else) and sort of guessed about the lower level values.
---
Reddit is a really dumb place, you can post identical comments on 2 different posts and get downvoted in one and upvoted in the other. People tend to sheep in the direction they’re led.
---
That's good to hear. The overwhelming voice in some of these threads paints a much more bleak picture of the player population
---
We are not Devs and we have zero tech knowledge to know why they make the decisions they do. We can wish for whatever we want, doesn't mean it is feasible.
---
***bUt wE dOnT nEeD lAyeRiNg, ItS tOtaLly FiNe***
---
Blizz have got to have considered that. How does that help when all the tourists leave? Then you just have a bunch of dead servers, and have to merge them, which people would be even more frustrated with.
---
Yeah I don't know why they have it ste like that its the same for me also but  no one will be getting beta access anymore the invites ended a while ago
---
Man you will love classic full release then. It solves all your issues (as there will be a bigger pop than in stress test).
---
I hope you enjoy the game , it will be around for ages as levelling takes time ! It's a proper long journey but because of the people and the world it feels way more about fun than just 'quickly hit cap and get epics' which is what details about now.
---
I seriously cannot wait, I played vanilla but I was very much still in the noob stage then, wasn't until tbc I went into hardcore raiding. Still can't decide on a tank war or PI priest!
---
No. It's just a name change.
---
I agree, going to add a caveat to my post stating this exactly as I meant to, but forgot to add it apparently.
---
He's saying nurfed with a direct comparison to his subject, which is pserver.  
---
Stop being pedantic. Pservers are really the only time people have had to theorycraft druid tanking, so using it as the baseline here is reasonable.
---
&gt; Our species also has a brain capable of critical thinking and solving problems before they arise.
---
That part of the brain seems to seek out problems to solve and invents them when needed. I think that people who support layering must recognize, at some level, that is is a long term detriment to the experience and will provide more hardship than it will alleviate. And I think, if they closed their eyes and meditated on it, they'd find that they want that hardship. 
---
The player-centric way to do this is Clusters (21,000 active players) consisting of various segments (3,000 active) which all share a name pool for ease of future merges. Segments would be called something like Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
---
Any two Segments see population drops can be merged together. In the mean time players on each segment log in every day to the same player base. Strangers become acquaintances become friends. Same as it was in Vanilla and TBC, just with a painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline. If population does not decline it has the advantage over layering that it allows for tsome Segments never need to be merged.
---
Layering will feel like sharding when the person you quested with yesterday is  logged into a different layer today. Plus it's exploitable, as we've seen in myriad videos. Plus if the expected population decline doesn't happen on some servers then Layering will be around forever or they'll have to find a way of separating the population. Layering, in most ways, offers an inferior experience to Clusters. 
---
With Clusters they can just leave the Segments with healthy populations alone and we'd happily have an authentic experience.
---
Its most likely because your being obtuse and treating others like an asshole, but to each their own...
---
[This survey](https://forms.gle/jCJwwU54Gua8uGvQA) was done a while ago, but should give an indication, I suppose.
---
Back to the shed, shill.
---
tourists willl leave once they see the queues and play retail or roll on another server. problem fixed
---
My main is going to be a holy pally with double crafting professions, enchanting and smithing probably. My main is going to be something for farming with double gathering professions
---
This is litrally the problem with Min/Maxing in MMO's. Nothing wrong with working to be the best, but fighting over a few minor % is not fun. What was fun was interacting in an immersive world and preparing for raids by stocking up on consumables etc.
---
Only takes a week of layering to permanently destroy the economy.
---
Well said!
---
I worry slightly comparing the launch of Classic to the original vanilla launch though. This time it will probably be millions playing from day 1. Whilst back then it was a couple hundred thousand that had pre-purchased it and then had to spend 5-40 hours downloading the damn thing, haha! 
---
I too believe layering will diminish the "Oh! A familiar face!" factor early on, so hopefully it will only last a few weeks. You will face some problems with clusters too, I suppose. After each merge you will see new players, maybe you were the only blacksmith with the Lionheart Helm pattern, but then the next day you're merged and suddenly there's 3 of you! If layering share General Chat and Trade Chat you won't face that problem. Would you like to see the same for clusters, or would that ruin the "illusion" of being on a single realm.
---
&gt; Doesn’t mean that can’t it shouldn’t work to improve the system so that it isn’t so easily a usable during the time that it’s in the game tho
---
for the majority of players, it will be new.
---
uhm.... Joana did 1-20 in 11hours? Is this some recent testing on a super populated server?
---
Else these numbers feel off af.
---
I remember doing 1-20 in aprox. 8-9h with a troll hunter in vanilla, not a pserver, but without any contest for any quest mobs.
---
&gt; Please be true
---
Nah mate, they're just blowing money on server infrastructure today for funsies. No actual work on layering is being done.
---
Ofc
---
Stingy bastard
---
People today are trained to be easily offended and afraid of an original thought.
---
I'm talking about Activision the publisher, not Blizzard the developer. Activision makes the financial decisions.
---
Best reddit comment ever
---
Both can work just fine.
---
For BG's hunter is generally better, because rogues relies on CD's in PvP, so they have too much downtime in a BG. However, in world PvP a rogue is arguably stronger since you can just wait for your CD's. Still, hunter is also strong in wPvP.
---
For PvE rogues are better dps and hunters are not super viable, except for a bit of utility. You will still be able to get a spot as a hunter, but there will only be 1-3 hunter spots and a lot more rogue spots in a raid. In early raids it should be noted that hunters are actually pretty good dps, it is only later on they fall far behind. The good thing about this is you can "secure" your standing in a guild in MC where you are actually a good dps and they might keep raiding with you even as you progress raids and your dps starts to fall behind.
---
Both classes have uses throughout all of Classic with a slight edge to rogues since their dps scales well. Do note that hunters don't lack dmg in PvP, it is their sustained dps in a raid environment that is lacking.
---
No, but I'm not naive and expect stuff for free.
---
Bullshit, siphon life is 11 points affliction and soul link is 31 points demonology. With 50 talent points that was easily reachable and tons of people did it.
---
&gt; Destroying the game is not worth saving some coin on server merge costs.
---
Because that wouldn't fuck up the economy as well  🤗🤗🤗
---
This is fine. Experienced it on private servers. People still play.
---
Oh none of that in the slightest was original, thinking one is superior than others has always been around
---
&gt; blizzard never explained why they think they can remove layering after a couple weeks
---
So you're making posts about things you're totally ignorant about?
---
This has been explained many times. They can remove it after a couple weeks because then not EVERY SINGLE PLAYER will be in the starting zones.
---
Goddamn, you anti-layer people are dense.
---
Probably room temperature IQ as well at this point.
---
Oh No!! Instead of people using Chuck Norris jokes and memes from 2004, they'll be using memes from 2019 and now very popular twitch emotes instead of "zomg" and "1337 speak"!!
---
The horror.
---
No its not really,  we ran a druid tank back in vanilla
---
How is this retarded comment upvoted? Bandwagoners gtfo.
---
The change to mana etc to ensure that people didn't run out of mana so frequently was a terrible decision. Managing your resources was a core concept of the game.
---
I suppose we don't know what they're going to do yet. Prior point redacted. 
---
I was never very opposed to zone-based sharding to alleviate early growing pains. That made enough sense and I figured that, at least, the world would then become consistent and static after level 20. 
---
I'm adamantly, fundamentally, aggressively, desperately opposed to layering. If that system goes live it is 60% of the experience it could be.
---
Maybe not original but definitely not the mainstream answer. Everyone has to downvote the one that’s different it’s too scary! Considering I never downvote people, I’d say on reddit I am superior.
---
my guess would be disc priest or resto druid
---
Not sure if you were quoting me to point out all of the typos or not, but thanks!  I’ve corrected them so the statement reads what I was actually trying to say.

I was looking for a group for Deadmines on my paladin and advertised as a DPS pally so I wouldn't get invited as heals (just didn't think I had the mana pool to do it) and this guy was ragging on me in chat. I mean, OK, whatever, it is Deadmines and at that level I am neck-and-neck with most classes on average with how quick things die. Talk about optimal builds all you want, but 5-mans aren't raiding. More deaths happen because people don't know how to play the game rather than being a run with a Prot War tank, Holy priest, 2 rogues, and a mage.
---
Hell, I've been playing a feral druid and easily healing, tanking, or DPSing any run I've been a part of and been effective in all three.
---
Eh, I'd go with the talent. Pursuit of Justice also increases mounted speed, which the boots enchant doesn't. So, immediately upon 40, you can enjoy that mounted boost as well. Normally, you'd need to get the carrot on a stick from the ZF quest and another pair of botos with mithril spurs and then you only have +6% mounted speed.
---
Come lategame, you can put +7 agi on boots, which is ~1/3% crit chance, which is better for pve than any other possible talent. For pvp, you might consider 2 extra points in deflection, but then you basically consider 0.33% crit vs 2% parry, which only helps against melee classes. Vindication is mostly useless in both pve and pvp.
---
That's not vanilla experience it's a design flaw. WoW wasn't meant to be played by so many people at once in so few zones.
---
Dead servers existed originally and the subscriber count kept growing.
---
Maybe. But sharding isn’t in the game so moot point.
---
I’ll take the layering system as it will exist over both tho.  Still hoping they can find tune it to be less abusable before launch however.
---
It's like everyone is playing the game to have fun, crazy how that works
---
Never
---
Where do I apply?
---
"Right, and what happens when a new layer opens up after 3k pop is passed? You have one layer filled and one layer with a couple of hundred player but with the same "1000" nodes."
---
Its almost like you didn't read the OP.
---
Here ill just quote it: 
---
&gt;"If a 4.5k pop server has a layer with 3k pop and another layer with 1.5k pop, we clearly have an issue with resource distribution. The second layer is far more advantageous to be in (imagine the second layer being only 500 population, YIKES)."
---
But how long would a server sit at 3500 people instead of 5500?  As stated before,
---
&gt; A bunch of people move over to the lower population layer via invites or w/e because its just SO MUCH Better. Say 600 move. well now you have 2.4k verses 2.1k and its really not that imbalanced.
---
And finally: 
---
&gt; As long as Blizzard designs Layering so that its roughly balancing layers populations this will hardly provide resource benefits.
---
From you -
---
&gt; This is how the system works on beta and by all logic is how it will work on live 
---
So this may be correct at times but its clearly wrong at other times. There are plenty of videos proving this out there the 105 https://countdowntoclassic.com/ podcast even provides an example of this. A person fighting a mob all the sudden shifts to a new layer. Not on group join or anything. This is some Blizzard code balancing the population of the layers to some degree. Maybe it was making a new one or maybe it was combining two into one. However, this function was exhibiting that layering doesn't just hit 3k pop then opening a new layer with 1 person on it.  We DO NOT know how this works on beta. It might shift 1k of those 3k people to the new layer then fill that new layer to 2k, we simply don't know. And they have clearly changed what is occurring more than once also. So maybe it did work 3k pop and 1 person pop on two layers at one time. And at another time it split or combined populations between layers.  That is why i recognized that we don't know exactly what will occur here. 
---
From you-
---
&gt;The more major problem is that some people will in fact have access to multiple layers' resources, since entire continents are layered and not just zones there can be 3 layers with different Un'Goro all of which are seemingly empty shortly after release, thus giving a person who knows how to layer hop 3x more spawns, nodes or w/e, even if there is only 1 player spread across 3 different Un'Goro zones
---
Again, maybe stats or math is hard, but in the case of 3k pop there is just 1 player then at 9k pop you should expect 3 players. This is how numbers work. Sure at one point there will only be 1 level 55, but expect 3 times as many to appear in the next 2 hours with 9k pop compared to 3k pop. It is possible that a few super levelers (who stop leveling to start gathering.. unlikely) will get like 10 or so more mines... Oh no. This just isn't a specific issue worth any serious consideration. Statistical you gain nothing.
---
Did you just post to repeat all thew doomsday talking points others gave you? Please actually respond to the points made. And i recognize that if your server has a pop of 3.5k and one layer is at 500 people i mean my goodness that is an issue. But i am not going to rest my entire assessment on that assumption. Blizzard shouldn't do that for sure, a population balancing feature (even if it does has minor hiccups) is preferable. However, even if they do do it this is also preferable to 9k on one non layered server or 3k max pop with massive queue (people will move around).
---
My apologies. I meant to say it is bereft of any **inherent** meaning. Shorthands like lol are not memes. Kappa is a meme, and is indistinguishable in its purpose from saying 'That's my secret captain'.
---
We have vanilla data. Don't try to say private is the only data
---
Isn't that just how YouTube comments works? Did you play any sports a child?
---
You're an idiot who needs reading comprehension
---
How exactly do you think what I said is different?
---
On privates we corpse camped the main tank of an enemy guild for a few days so they cannot progress, that's normal. If your guild or group is worse in pvp then you are worthless and are at the mercy of the stronger. Simple rule.
---
Layering defeats any sort of hierarchy.
---
No you didn't. If you think any private server had anything near the numbers classic wow will have on release you're just being delusional.
---
I grew up in the 90s. People weren’t babies in those days.
---
That's the problem though.  They could have easily done a guide based on vanilla data, not like it isn't there
---
Well at cap you run dungeons, raids and PvP as well as farm gold. So the gameplay changes a lot.
---
My point is the other things you liked about the XPAC were nullified by the theme.
---
Like I said, and I'll say it again, you can make a perfect MMO, but the second you skin it with Hello Kitty I'm not going to care how perfect the MMO aspects are, it's still Hello Kitty and I have no interest in it.
---
My point is that many people like me did not get far enough into MOP to experience all these great MMO mechanics and progression you're talking about, because the theme was *so bad* that it made me stop playing.
---
I literally started my CATA level 80 character in that first MOP zone and even rolled a Panda Monk just to check it out.
---
I had unsubbed within a week. I had no interest in doing quests, doing raids, or experiencing any story the game had to offer. I later went back and read the synopsis and don't feel like I missed anything.
---
Theme may not matter as much to some people, but if a theme is off-putting *enough* it wont matter how good the game mechanics are.
---
That's my point.
---
Would Assassins Creed in a Hello Kitty setting be a fun game? Probably fun, but I wouldn't want to play it. How about a Hello Kitty game with the Spiderman PS4 mechanics? Loved Spider-man PS4, but Hello Kitty PS4 with the same game mechanics but a Hello Kitty skin? Nope.
---
CSGO: Kitties? Nah. Probably one of the most balanced shooters on the planet but the second it's got that kitty skin I DGAF.
---
My point is that if the theme is *reasonable* then the positive gameplay aspects will shine through the mediocrity of the theme.
---
But a *bad* theme can make it so no level of improved gameplay mechanics will make the game more enjoyable.
---
I know what you mean! I love the Tauren starting zone and Shaman as a class, but for me it just doesn't feel right to be a Horde player, no matter how I try to justify it. This is a situation where you need to go with your gut.
---
Ronnoc getting some action
---
Deep wounds is fine. It gets overwritten by everything.
---
Let me casually reach the entrance of an instance, filled with elites in front, on my own. Genius comment.
---
That isn’t true, I grew up then too lol. Also going to answer the question?
---
Here's my 2 cents:
---
&gt; I want to go on dungeon raids. Where do I do that?
---
* For Alliance the earliest Dungeon is Wailing Caverns - found in The Barrens in the middle of the other continent - and can be cleared at level 15.
---
&gt; How the heck to I get cool shoulder pads? I have checked every shop so far, and I can’t find them. I know it’s silly, but the giant should pad armor I’ve seen in WoW videos looks SO cool and I want it badly!
---
* Your 1st piece of Shoulderpads are going to be from a random drop from a level 12+ monster. Quests don't generally give Shoulderpads.
---
&gt; Did I pick the right class? I don’t know if I’ll ever know.
---
* Paladins are definitely a good class but I'll let actual Paladins come up with arguments.
---
&gt; I know I only have a day left for the stress test, and that my character will probably be deleted forever, but what should I do next? Stormwind seems to be a dead end.
---
* Stormwind seems like a dead end because people are all trying to level up and Goldshire has decent counterparts for some classes and professions meaning those people don't quite yet need to to Stormwind - up to level 10 if I recall correctly. Most people spend time in Stormwind for the following reasons: Looking for a Dungeon Run, selling on the Auction House, buying class spells, improving profession skills, buying profession recipes, fishing. None of these are very relevant at this stage in the game - it's day 1.
---
&gt; Should I play the regular modern version of WoW? Or should I complete a Classic before moving onto the new version?
---
* Personally I think you're going to be distraught with WoW Retail butyou should give it a try and see why people raise WoW Classic - myself included - to Jesus status. WoW Classic is THE GAME that forces you to make parties to complete certain quests, it's slow enough that you can take 5 minutes to talk to a stranger without feeling like you will no longer be able to catch up to the masses.
---
I can't imagine the ppl playing bfa don't make a classic character.  At least the majority anyways.  It's "free" for them after all.
---
We don't know if its 3k on one and 1 on another or how this works for sure. 
---
However, even in this case people can clearly hop to other shards with invites so they will often balance themselves out .... just like what occurred in MoP.
---
Nice keybinds bro.
---
Do you currently subscribe?
---
Auto dismount is probably the only thing I'd add into the game. Not including it just means I have to macro it in to every relevant ability.
---
Even watching 10 minute clips I tend to skip over most of it because it's bullshit fluff.  I get it, I'm not the target audience.
---
I used RAIS Autoshot timer but either way there will be people making an autoshot timer and threat meters as mods, whatever they end up being called.
---
I just set mine to alt movement keys.
---
Everyone needs on that
---
I remember a few years ago (before Twitch was a thing) being in General chat in Stormwind a few minutes before server shutdown for weekly reset.  My god, it made Twitch chat look civilised.  I stayed out of morbid fascination but never again.
---
topkek
---
&gt; crappy time selected all around.
---
No, best time selected all around.
---
They picked a time during their working hours when it was most likely to have the most people available.  If they aimed for when more people in the US were off work, they'd be stuck at the office late.  Earlier time for people in Europe, they miss the people in the US.  There's no time that'd work across the globe, and they don't need global people coming in because people around the world play at different times.  They just needed to do stress tests while they had people on hand to actually watch the servers and adjust things accordingly.
---
People act like they should be doing all kinds of stuff off-hours.  So yeah, "crunch" and unpaid overtime when it suits the gamers?  No.  But that's what they'd need to do this "ideal" testing people think of.  When the reality is they only need to open it up for a certain region and limit the number of servers, and that'd be enough to test how much the servers can handle overall when launch day hits.
---
It's important to remember that these times aren't just for customers' convenience, they're also tied to real people on the other end who'd like to go home to their family and not spend all night letting people do a short demo, which is what people are complaining about not being able to get in on.
---
God damn... Memories. I think the first version I saw was a little bit after this but not hugely so 😭🥺
---
But all you had to do is grind a few unrelated mobs, explore for some xp or level fishing in the meantime and get skills going (and some money). Or just make a group to farm lvl 5mobs where people do not quest.
---
Use your brain?
---
O dont get it. Why do you need a macro for this? In the keybind section you can set keybinds to every mark
---
Take him to the infirmary
---
Bfa kiddo
---
I got mine in WotLK. I'm pretty sure it still works, I just don't use it since I only log on one PC and since Cata or MoP they don't require you to authenticate every time.
---
This 100%. Retail is VERY solo orientated, and group play is very anti-social.  
---
Honestly from reading this post, I'd tell the dude to go North and then i'd watch as he see's the next insane thing and possibly even discovers Ironforge.
---
Whatever he does, I'd tell him to ignore retail based on his post.
---
ur dense, layering is in ALL zones not in starter zone only. so by ur logic the end game zones will be packed, all cities will be packed, BRS Will be camped by thousands and there will be long queues anyway after a couple weeks? 
---
Most people will be like lvl 30-40 by the time they remove layering so all those zones will be packed with people. (leveling for new players will take 10-15 days /played)
---
Who's ignorant now?
---
I'd implement Karazhan seeing as Atiesh hints at it, but I'd make it on par with naxx difficulty and with rewards that are only on par with naxx gear at best, with some cutesy hybrid spec items.
---
&gt; but both of them have about three times the hotkeys a f.e. frostmage has and need way more skill and knowledge to get even close to the same results in pvp.
---
You can literally use pet attack and auto attack keys for hunters and get to level 60. Just because they have many keys does not make them harder to play, they are not just strong at leveling they are extremely easy to play while leveling as well.
---
For PvP I do agree, though - hunters require some skill and knowledge.
---
&gt;hunters have the most complicated dps rotation in classic out of all classes as u have to not clip autoshots and there are two different ways to do that depending on what weapon u are currently wearing.
---
While of course it requires more than spamming frost bolt it isn't *really* the hardest. I mean, putting aside the fact that literally no rotation in Classic is actually hard and it is a question of easy or super easy, hunter isn't the "hardest". You just google which of the two rotation for a given weapon (and you won't upgrade your weapon that often, so it isn't often you need to change rotation). Then have a swing timer and it is extremely easy. You got two abilities and just need to time them. Sure it is a fun little "mini game" during raids that takes more brainpower than literally spamming frostbolt, but I'd argue rogue is "harder". Learning to realize when you can get away with another eviscerate without dropping SnD at least takes more than the hunter rotation.
---
&gt;on top of that its not easy to understand hunter pets overall.
---
Let's be completely honest here, people will just google it.
---
As for warlocks, again PvP takes some skill but PvE is super easy and so is leveling.
---
Why would you think that?, like it or not many of the big streamers are the people who have been fighting for classic
---
I do not own BFA, I quit in legion.  How are you gonna tell me that running on foot while farming for professions is at all as efficient as having 60% increased speed on a mount?  Use your head.
---
I think you don't understand that everything a hunter does costs mana.
---
I also can use the 2 agi, while you cannot.
---
So in truth, mages behave.

You sure dedicated a long section of your post telling us how you didnt care about superstition. I assume that 99,9% of us dont so why even bring it up? The fact that you do just tells me that you do care a lot more about it then the rest of us. Almost sounds like you do believe in it but are so edgy that you just dont care about bad luck.
---
What’s funnier you thinking the answer to that question is relevant or me attempting to give you a pass while you push so hard for nothing?
---
Why are the melee attack values different? Isn't it supposed to be the same because ferals don't use weapon damage?
---
&gt;disease/affliction
---
&gt;Obesity is a medical condition
---
???
---
I believed it too, till I was killing naxx bosses with an imperfect raid composition.
---
Hell yeah dude, brother of light!
---
the reason you have that option is because you previously participated in the stress test and didn't remove the client. it's not beta.
---
No, it's the children who are wrong!
---
&gt; making fun of a permanent mental disorder
---
Does it trigger the snowflakes or what? We can't even use disease names now? Jesus.
---
I mean the whole conversation is regarding their ingame complaint that not enough people were present for proper stress testing.
---
And when you work as a game dev for a multi billion dollar company some overtime is needed to test things properly.
---
Quality life/work balance shouldnt be an argument, because this is not a regular occurance and happens like once a month at most.
---
literally nothing points to there being a pop redistribution, and there certainly is none on the beta
---
Seeing as private server have a raised server cap and still had queues on fresh servers. Then  yes, we have already experienced it.
---
Server transfers were offered from actual dead servers.
---
 /leave trade
---
 /leave general
---
Get the two points in imp heroic rather than parry. You'll be using heroic as a dump but 13 beats 15 any day.
---
It’s very relevant to the development of your team building and group social skills.
---
Yeah the merge issue is the bugaboo. There's really no way around the unpredictability of the population with this thing so it becomes a question of how you want your pain delivered. 
---
I'd rather get punched in the gut and go through a crappy two minutes in an otherwise healthy life than have a chronic condition that makes me feel constantly ill for three months (and very possibly perpetually). 
---
In addition to what you said, the merges would also shake up guilds. Why stay through the struggle against the first bosses of AQ40 when a guild working through Naxx appears out of thin air and wants you? And why keep trying to work your way into Naxx when your top few dudes just left for a new Naxx guild? 
---
*That* is how bad I think layering will be. I'd rather go through a few big shakeups interspersed with an otherwise consistent and true experience than to play amongst 20,000 strangers, see things phasing in and out, know that people are exploiting, feel anxious that I should learn to exploit too or I'll be left behind, and be taken out of the experience wondering if this cursed system will, in fact, beturned off in Phase 2.
---
Not sure what happened on your realmforums, but we most certainly named players and had whole threads about ninjalooters. 
---
Also, what does that have to do with the fact you literally said "not every server had a place outside of the game to communicate"? 
---
I merely pointed out that you were wrong, there was an official place for every server to communicate outside of the game.
---
Idk, when I was playing last night it took me 2 hours to tag enough mobs for the third quest in a zone, so I guess it was decently stressed. 
---
This morning was a relative ghost town though.
---
The fact that you pointed out an "if" means that it does require at least some extra attention.
---
Do you genuinely believe that Blizzard will believe or accept that argument? Nobody is seriously that naive.
---
If you can't provide a rational alternative why do you expect them to just cave in and say "You know what, who cares that the servers will be full and unstable. I bet our primary returning audience of middle aged men who now have families and careers have much more time to sit in queues for hours now they're older!"
---
This is a business venture: they want as many subs as possible for as long as possible and for that the servers need to be easily accessible by everyone.
---
&gt; Who's ignorant now?
---
Still you.
---
&gt;Most people will be like lvl 30-40 by the time they remove layering so all those zones will be packed with people
---
The fact you don't understand the difference between people being spread out over the entire world and literally every player being crammed in the same 6 starting zones are the exact same time means your opinion isn't worth much, bud.
---
So they should have it be a shitshow for the first two weeks because "it worked okay before". It didn't work okay, people just waited or forced through it. Why would they emulate that experience again?
---
Shaman. Easy to get raidspots, really good in PvP, not terribly hard to itemize.
---
anything new on this topic? on stress test client seems to be delayed still
---
Is that a human druid?
---
Some servers I'm not allowed to name had 10-14k concurrent users for several weeks at launch. That's way more than any single retail vanilla server ever had.
---
They used dynamic respawn to keep the bottleneck in check which is a much more elegant way of dealing with the population than sharding.
---
Lmao I'm holding that one right now, I got it complimentary due to being hacked 3 times in a day. Still works, been using it since. Still works! But since my bnet account just auto logs I dont use it much anymore. Lmao my buddies still shit talk me about how I still use it.
---
Blizzard can enjoy their dead classic servers then. With the data they provide we can create a true authentic vanilla private server. No need to ever pay for the shitty layered classic.
---
Because people like you want to gatekeep the community that built WoW. Stop being a gatekeeper and let people have fun.
---
Kinda hard to make a guide on a game that you aren't able to play, don't you think?
---
I have the OG Authenticator. Still works. It’s on my 11 year olds account since he doesn’t have a phone.
---
You don't do it for the damage you do it on hard hitting bosses for the attack speed slow. And 5 set 2.5 is bad.
---
This entire comment was an extremely intersting look into how the human memory works. No, this isnt a meme dude. This is exactly how people specifically enjoyed something and think that anyone who bashes it was wrong. Want proof?
---
&gt;Warlords of Draenor sold over 3.3 million copies within the first 24 hours, and subscription numbers increased from 7.4 million to over 10.5 million in November 2014. However, by the end of the first quarter of 2015, the number of subscribers had fallen to 7.1 million; 300,000 subscribers fewer than before the release of Warlords of Draenor. By the end of the second quarter, the number of subscribers dropped to 5.6 million, the lowest number of subscribers seen in the game since 2005. By the third quarter, subscribers held at 5.5 million. In November 2015, Blizzard said it will no longer report on the number of World of Warcraft subscribers.
---
The subscribers dropped so low that Blizzard straight up stopped repoprting them. It was by far the shortest expansion and the content released was minimal. They quickly backtracked and acted like it never happened. 
---
Its ok for you to enjoy it, no one is saying you cant, but it isnt even an arguement that it was a bad expansion. Is BFA worse? Idk, they are both shit. And if you like it, good for you dude, but from a business standpoint and a player standpoint no its not a fucking meme that it sucked. You can even hit up your friendly neighborhood Google to back up everyones point.
---
I'll refrain from the discussion cause clearly I'm mixing things up here. I'm looking forward to how it all pans out when it comes back, apparently I'm just very wrong on certain Warlock aspects. I just vividly remember it being a very frustrating matchup for me but my memory is apparebtly too hazy to figure out why.
---
Sorry for giving so much flak, thanks for discussion
---
imagine being so shite at the game you need a castbar to know your casting times.
---
Im not one of the no changes guys and i like some stuff about retail. I disagree on your examples. Arena turned wow in to espaorts and is a major reason why classes all do the same niw, and mythic dungeons just turn the game in to a speed running contest, i liked it in legion when it was new but i see a lot more downsides to it than upsides now  not saying it couldnt be done and be great but as they are right now i would have to disagree.
---
!RemindMe 28 August 2019
---
Lich king was ok. Beyond that the game started to decline.
---
Playing in a top end guild we are required to level 2 characters to 60 in ~10days of time so we can raid twice a week of 20mains +20alts raid compositions, helps you gear out the characters faster for when BWL hits and you merge the raid and split it into 2 20man raids for MC clears and ony clears.
---
This is kind of how I'm leveling, getting max fishing and cooking by the time I hit lvl 30/40, have enough for mount.
---
Emulator with half the values guessed on random, yeah best thing ever
---
I don’t wanna sound clueless but what is layering ??
---
If you have actual beta access you would be able to log in and play
---
I know right? Account security will RUIN the Vanilla experience. #nochanges
---
Retail babies trying to keep their data safe, SMH.
---
&gt;Layering fucking up community and economy is a guarantee unless it's turned off really quickly.
---
Community, yes, but so would server merges or login queues. Economy, not really. It will change the economy "meta" a bit, but some resources costing 20% less than they might have done in vanilla is not "fucking it up". 
---
If they do layering in a sensible way (not like what is shown by MN), there will be roughly as many resources per player as there would be on a single non-layered realm. If the non-layered realm is at population cap 100% of the time it would have slightly less resources per player than the layered realm, accounting for the ~20% price change I said earlier. But if a non-layered realm isn't always population capped, then resources per player would be very similar to a layered realm, if not even higher.

The answer was both! Reddit never fails to disappoint. This is the part where you go “I got him! He never played sports!” Then I laugh and die inside from how dumb this was.. Reddit fights like a girl
---
I said this before in another thread. That would be mythic+ done right. Make them hard so that you need to use CC and shit but dont put a timer on it. Either you complete it or not, also no infinite scaling.
---
It means druids, who were seen as the worst class, are even worse.
---
CtC would be bearable if the episode weren't like 20 hours long.
---
If there was sufficient data on feral froms in vanilla private servers wouldn't have it wrong.
---
I see where you're coming from, but ultimately it was meant in the context of blacklisting. Can't speak for your experience on your server forums but I know that naming and shaming was officially against the rules so if anyone shamed someone for ninjalooting, that person could've reported the shamer and get him punished
---
Currently in NA the Classic Stress Test is down and does not appear in the launcher. Opening the .exe and logging in results in "No servers are up". I woke up early to get on :(
---
Looks good to me.
---
Before the stress test was live, there were like 20 servers. I logged in after work around 9:30PM ET, and there were only 2 PVP servers, both flagged as high pops, and 2 PVE, flagged as low pop. So either they overestimated demand, or they lunched at the wrong time. Probably both. 
---
The game played smooth, though, and I spent an 45 mins trying to get 8 wolves to kill due to the respawn rates and limited mobs. Definitely a change of pace from retail WoW, and not sure how I feel about it yet.
---
Damn I came here to say this
---
People on private launches with 5k+ people seemed to manage, just group up explore xp and kill higher level mobs.
---
"You don't do things the way I do? KIDDO!"
---
I am 100% glad he does. That’s how you get them fixed for release?
---
lol you have no idea how vanilla leveling works or how vanilla works in general, right?
---
 Horde and alliance level in the same zones from about 20+. and there are no 6 zones where u can level in at any level but the starter zones. Everyone in a level bracked will be cramped into 2-3 zones.
---
Leveling 55-60 will take u 5 -7 days played in zones where the ganking will be non stop. if you fall a little behind the level 60's will make leveling impossble because they will be grinding world pvp.
---
The fact that you ignore that every endgame zone will be packed, BRS will be camped non stop, and when they remove the layering they will be forced to put queues into place anyway to avoid all this just shows to me that u have no idea what ur talking about. and tbh its really sad. you must be quite a sad person.
---
&gt; ingame complaint
---
Joke.  Ingame joke.  If it was an actual problem, they wouldn't have straight up said it.
---
&gt; some overtime is needed
---
So yeah, crunch and all is fine if the players want it, but not if the company wants it?  Nah.
---
Overtime isn't needed here.  They could test properly, and likely were, while having fun with it.
---
But you take their comments literally, so I'm sure you also believe that Omar has an Infinity Gauntlet.  I mean, it has to be 100% the truth with no joke to it and nothing behind it, because it was a server message!
---
Feels like people just want to find hilariously silly reasons to complain.  (Fair enough to the people just joking about the message, though.)
---
It's more like as a druid you'll be expected to carry flags in wsg as you are the best at it.
---
You keep getting new spells and talents up to level 60.
---
I think the main thing after that is doing group activities with friends - dungeons, pvp, raids.
---
If you have some friends to play with, it will be fun regardless of what you're doing. If not, you could make friends in game?
---
In the big picture, it's certainly better if you spend that time getting ahead at work, or working out, or focusing on school, or teaching yourself new skills, or whatever -- instead of playing video games. If that's what you're asking.
---
Original WoW is awesome. I dislike actiblizz so much 😢 - this is just a hugeeeee cash grab. This classic rehash is just a slick marketing move. Make a new mmo like classic WoW- no no no that’s too risky and cost too much. I’m disgusted with myself as I will be giving them the 15$ to play. My two shit centz.
---
Woosh
---
And the private servers just decided to change the values only to fuck with their players for no reason, right?
---
Obviously the data was not there at the time, else they would have gotten it right.
---
This is actually great! just download the addon and replace all the .tga files with blank ones
---
I dont get all this dress up thing. You only feel like you look like shit because everyone else looks like a god. Playing on a private server right now i just looked at my level 55 druid and thought damn i start to look awesome. Do i really look awesome? Hell no but since the reference here is what i previously had then yeah i look fucking awesome and it feels great, way better than transmogging some tier set in retail.
---
Explain how this technique saves money?
---
But it will only be a thing during the first few weeks, its not like it will affect how you farm endgame mats or how there are server wide known personalities and famous people or all that stuff that makes vanilla so great.
---
As an X-Ray Tech student, sometimes it depends on the anatomy we are trying to look at! Generally we shield every time we can, but on things like abdomen x-rays, pelvis x-rays, etc. - we cant shield because it would cover up what we are trying to look at. This makes the whole procedure pointless if we shield. 
---
However as the patient you’re (usually) still in control of your health, so always feel free to ask about shielding if you’re unsure!  :)
---
I'm going to focus on professions over leveling tbh but that wont be super hardcore either, just dont have time for that anymore.
---
Ganking the opposing faction.
---
Helping the opposing faction grind.
---
Creating PuGs for ZG/UBRS
---
Attempting to down city bosses 
---
Helping lowbies by running dungeons or helping them with difficult group quests.
---
Maxing professions
---
Grinding for that mount you want
---
Get full tier 0
---
Rep grind for gear/bragging rights 
---
Be a GOD duellist outside org/IF
---
Be a business man, find a niche market in the auction house and exploit it.
---
And many more! Just don’t always expect a marker to tell you what to do, sometimes creating your own fun is the real fun.
---
Arcane crystal farm galore.
---
They should bring this back
---
We do this because even tho its not harmful sometimes its still better to protect the rest of the body
---
and we get behind the window because we do this stuff like 50-100 times a day. so even tho getting an x-ray doesnt hurt. being near 100 xrays a day is gonna fuck you up
---
With insta respawns, group quest item loot, ectera they manage.
---
How the fuck am I a shill for not freaking out about bugs and issues in a closed beta over two months away from launch?
---
I've learned from past expansions that actions speak louder than words and blizzard's word holds no more weight.
---
This is what is written on his website. I don‘t know how fast he is in the Classic Beta
---
Exactly. I get the healer needs it...but at the same time...so do I. Most likely, I don’t have a ring and both the Agi and Int are useful for me.
---
I probably need to rework how I tell funny stories. I explained my feelings about superstition so that I could build to the punchline that I actually did end up getting unlucky by choosing realm 13. It’s like an “I don’t know what I expected” joke. It’s not supposed to be deeper than that. Lol
---
Lavishly Jeweled Ring is one of the first rings you can get, so every class will roll need.
---
You literally could not be more wrong, the largest realm on that private server had like 12k concurrent players which is more than double what each realm will be capped at in classic.
---
*"You strike fear into the hearts of the horde, simply using your hammer and bubble-hearth"*
---
Finally someone said it. I’ll be rushing to 60 but if people want to take their time more that’s great if it’ll give them more enjoyment out of the game
---
This is pretty natural human behaviour
---
Yes but how many is too many? 100 people in one kolbold mine? Or is having 15 people more reasonable.
---
Paladin.
---
I look 2 weeks off for relaunch, considered rushing to end game with a buddy but after seeing this and thinking about the fun i had in vanilla... I may just take my time and do whatever the heck I want haha.
---
&gt;remote locations
---
Right outside one of the busiest low level towns in the game.
---
They should instance everyone under 20 for the first few weeks if it what it takes. When you hit 20 you’re phased into the real server and don’t move from there. Something like that would maybe work. Some would farm copper ore and shit but yea...
---
except that dynamic spawn isnt a feature you can turn of later. layering is
---
EU stress test is in July
---
That's the beta.  
---
Relaunch Battle.Net and download the proper Classic client.
---
Yes, everyone quests at the exact same rate with the exact same route.
---
You clearly don't think about things.
---
For example:
---
&gt;Smart people will abuse it to farm mats that will get more expensive as the game progresses. Farm lotuses on different layers. farm devilsaurs on all layers etc.
---
This clearly has not been though through. How would this possibly work if there's more than one or two people doing it? 
---
&gt;ou have no idea how vanilla leveling works or how vanilla works in general, right?
---
One of us clearly doesn't. HINT: It's you.
---
&gt;A bunch of people move over to the lower population layer via invites or w/e because its just SO MUCH Better. Say 600 move. well now you have 2.4k verses 2.1k and its really not that imbalanced.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;And finally:  
---
&gt;As long as Blizzard designs Layering so that its roughly balancing layers populations this will hardly provide resource benefits.
---
I didn't bother to respond to these because it's just a strawman, realistically 20% of the server will never layer hop but you make it out like that would the "normal" scenario in order push your point. Furthermore, there is no equilization of layer populations in the layering system, that's what their entire goal is. You're not supposed change layer without party invite or similar, the examples you give were even confirmed by blizzard to be bugs. 
---
&gt; Again, maybe stats or math is hard, but in the case of 3k pop there is  just 1 player then at 9k pop you should expect 3 players. This is how  numbers work. Sure at one point there will only be 1 level 55, but  expect 3 times as many to appear in the next 2 hours with 9k pop  compared to 3k pop. It is possible that a few super levelers (who stop  leveling to start gathering.. unlikely) will get like 10 or so more  mines... Oh no. This just isn't a specific issue worth any serious  consideration. Statistical you gain nothing. 
---
Again, the whole point is that the high fractiles of the population distribution are often very uneven, and the problem comes in when the entire CONTINENT is layered, not just a single zone. One person on a 3k server does not automatically translate to 3 people on a 9k pop server, and that's where the opportunity to abuse it comes in. No one is saying that you will be able to abuse it if you're smack in the middle of the leveling pack, but again you make it out like that is what is happening and base your entire argument on it. 
---
Your entire post assumes some form of pop redistribution which has never been even hinted at by blizzard, the examples you give of this system have been confirmed by blizzard to be bugs, and it goes against everything they've said about your layer placement being consistent during a play session.
---
Not even close to what the issue is at 1. Not even worth explaining why.... just think for 2s.
---
The nochange community demanded no dynamic respawn. So we cant use that.
---
Nothing, leave it as is. If your server is dead then it will grow when new players join later down the line. No layering no nothing.
---
How are you all stressing about layering while leveling? Theres barely any abuseable content pre level 60, maybe if ur a try hard twink on day one of release but after that, layering is gone poof not there. I see posts about a full bag of black lotuses, the plan is to remove layering for the leveling phase, meaning 3 to 4 weeks or when the population goes down. So basically 1 month of a 1.5 years of an expansion, and the layering will go down one by one, not from 9 layers to 1, but as it is needed, it will be removed
---
Better than flooding the market with arcane crystals etc.
---
I don't have and possibly can't have 39 friends who play WoW. There will be loot drama, guild drama, ninjalooting, guilds disbanding etc. But you just deal with it and move on, find another guild, join another group(but never forget the ninjalooter's name), communicate your problems with the officers. Even if they are assholes you will probably given loot next time just to shut you up. Work around the system not against the system. If you have what it takes form your own guild or parties and be just about loot distribution.
---
OK, this is really good to know. I'll take your advice and head North to complete whatever is up there. 
---
My only dilemma is what to do until the next Classic stress test. 
---
#DEAR BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT DEVELOPERS
---
#SERVER
---
#MERGING
---
Definitely works with backstab.
---
Dude i linked you a podcast where the dude was phasing in the middle of a camp in barrens without grouping. This means he was switching layers for some reason, why do layers open up and or close? Because of population.  This means there IS something that could point to pop redistribution. Its not known if its true or not, but its a possibility.
---
There are videos of this occurring to people on youtube. Now maybe its just a layering bug and people randomly switch for no reason at times. But to say there is nothing what-so-ever that could point to this is inaccurate.
---
Warriors and rogues won't.
---
How was it a joke, when they started with like 15 servers but closed all but two to properly test the hardware and layering.
---
Its the exact reason they do stress tests and why they opened beta access to all current subscribers to retail WoW in the Us and Oce.
---
Hahahah wait hold up are you trying to label my opinion as uninformed when everybody and their mom can see clearly that layering will damage the game in much more ways than ghost town servers???!!! Are you really that dense now? 
---
Can someone give me insightful comments here?
---
Just have Hellscream 1, Hellscream 2 , Hellscream 3 so people know its going to be merged in a few months. Offer free transfers in the first few weeks if your friends are in a "full" server. That's it, that's all! Anything else than that will kill WoW for the real Vanilla crowd faster than any ghost town servers.
---
And by the way layering is clearly made to appease the casual carebears, the tourists so to say. They dont give a shit if it kills World PvP, but for the real vanilla crowd that is already a big minus. They dont give a shit about the community, if they log in tomorrow and find none of the people they played with out in the world, it's fine. Where the vanilla crowd will feel something's off...
---
Layering makes Classic WoW dead before it's even released. And it's infuriating as fuck that Blizs even considered this abberation as their go to plan.
---
lol I remember this, loved it so much when I was younger, still pretty cool imo.
---
So did you?
---
"Mostly shocking and autoattacking waiting for windfury to proc." 
---
Who claimed otherwise? Some of you are acting like if an enhancement shaman doesnt get WF procs he automatically loose a duel
---
In retail, way more so than in Classic, you have to play both factions to get the whole story. So I played both. In vanilla there’s less of a cohesive story, and a lot of quests are shared or similar in objective, so it doesn’t matter as much. 
---
That said, I’d like to make a Horde alt in Classic somewhere down the line, just to get that Barrens questing experience. I’m playing normal server so none of that exclusively one faction bullshit.
---
Yup! Never say the word "wedding" and shoot for week nights to save a shitload. Also makes it harder for people to attend if you want a smaller crowd.
---
I made a couple of threads about layering, to try to chat with people and come up with a better solution to the current implementation, and the end result was [this \(summary picture\)](https://i.imgur.com/hMLUD4U.png).
---
I think they need to consider changing the system to something more along these lines, and the fundamental code to do this should already be largely in place.
---
Wod lacked content more than anything since they pretty much scraped a years worth of dev time.
---
But as a current wow type game it wasn't bad.
---
It also had gladiator stance and that rises it above most other recent exp packs.
---
Really? So entire 40 man roster is required to level 2 toons to 60 within The first two weeks?
---
Madseason is a youtube guy who does classic videos for the same lines of thinking check out that boi
---
If they have no rings they 100% will. 2 agility is better than no agility.
---
what other class can better use the agi/int combination?
---
You  can have just classic
---
Separate installations. Don't need the giant BFA client to download the relatively small (~5GB) Classic client.
---
It hardly requires a stretch of the imagination to think that teenagers who played 6-8 hours a day every day from 2005 to 2007 managed to get several characters to max level and possibly even decently geared.
---
That's how its going to end up as when layering ends though, 20k population servers, with cross-ream BG's enabled, hardly a community will be built.
---
2 agility for the warrior is literally 4 armor and that's it.
---
Lol, they just had to summ him... How can u camp a few....days? Lol
---
4 armor is better than no armor.
---
50 seems about right.
---
As long as my post was, there are some details I didn't include. I made a very short trek to Westfall, but there was nobody there and I didn't want to go there on my own, so I finally headed to Stormwind. Good to know I'll eventually head back to Westfall again. lol 
---
Thanks for the encouragement. From what I gather, I'm "playing the right way" by getting lost and asking people for help. So at least I have that going for me. I will say that as much as I don't want to play solo, it's cool how I'll end up exploring so deep in an area and discover cool looking places on accident. Reminds me of Breath of the Wild!
---
I was going to play ally but I'm going rogue so I don't want to for that reason
---
&gt; the only race that looks good in the game has the worst racials
---
ok you've piqued my curiosity. which one?
---
yea and a rogue can re-stealth 4 times and therefor sap and eat to full 4 times, while u will never have a chance to regain mana. I played shaman as main in vanilla.
---
You present the idea of server clusters as if there are no downsides. There are. 
---
&gt; Any two Segments see population drops can be merged together
---
True, they can. But to act like there's no negative implications to mergers or any sort, is incorrect. Whether it's a guild merger, server merger, or a cluster merger, there's a chance it'll go smooth, there's a chance it won't.  
---
I'm not here to support the Nochanges team or the people who want layering, I just want people to understand whether it's those two, or server clusters, none are perfect and without flaw.   
---
worst issues?  
---
Conventional release: potentially unplayable on populated servers for the first few days  
---
Layers: economic and other potential exploits  
---
Clusters: drama, community issues  
---
I personally don't know which is the better option, it'll be easier to judge once launch actually hits and we can see how much attention it gets. Clusters just seem to be overkill imo for what will likely only be a week long issue.
---
Maybe just put a delay of "player level times X" minutes on layer hopping seems a better solution to me, and have it increase to times Y if you hopped in the very recent time.
---
Otherwise this layering is gonna be exploited for farming mats, mobs, pvp, etc.
---
Alright you have fun in special snowflake land then whilst the rest of us enjoy classic
---
Mate, we nerds need that porn. Star Wars is floundering and the odd glimpse of things like this is like crack.
---
The prequels sucked then, they suck now.
---
I got even , started bro ing the boss while doing less work and just took a promotion because “I’ve shown real team spirit and leadership “ went from number 1 in production in company (70) in my position to about number 25. 
---
Got a nicer office and can play WoW during the day now.
---
False, damage only. If you sap or sheep a mob it’s still untagged.
---
Thank you . Bfa started a 9gb update and I was worried .
---
Probably not worth losing leveling partners over.
---
You do know that layering is just reverse engineered from the sharding system right? It's the same reason people have seen crossrealm in the beta, because it's based on that system. Both this form of cross realm and layering without grouping have been confirmed to be bugs. Using it as an indication of a feature in the live game is just ridiculous. Are you going to say that this behavior also points to classic having cross realm grouping?
---
Or blizzard is looking ahead and making sure we wont have to deal with sharding in 2 years. That sounds like a huge plus for me
---
Just remember there won't be any BGs to run, unless you're a really slow leveller...
---
Me and my friends played Alliance at the beginning of vanilla. We've pretty much been horde since then. We're going for pure nostalgia, here.
---
Yea all the people getting on their high horse about twitch emotes is like the epitome of [this meme](https://imgur.com/skSkMdc).
---
Yep, I feared the same. Combined with +7 weapon damage enchant working on PS and correspondingly not working on Classic servers, I'm afraid that Classic druid might be weaker than their PS counterpart.
---
I'm gonna play Alliance because I'm rolling a Paladin. I don't want to do it but there's no other way.
---
Still don't know why I'm having such a hard time thinking about it considering I spent a lot of time on Alliance when I had three level 90s in MOP but the itch to play Horde is really strong. Probably because my second choice is Shaman.
---
you’re just being wilfully obtuse now
---
Keep thinking that it will be minimal , ill just say that ill have my money for normal  mount and half the money for epix one at lvl 30.
---
You dont know what u talking about. Stoneclaw does nothing in PVP lol, its a taunt totem.
---
&gt; dynamic spawning
---
Dynamic respawns are absolutely horrible. Want to go into a cave? You can't, mobs are literally spawning ontop of you as you clear. The amount of resources being dumped into the economy is nuts. Mining &amp; herbalism nodes spawning quicker, mobs spawning and dying getting farmed by full groups of five, etc. That is not the way to solve it.
---
Here's the way to do it.
---
Pick a server like Darkspear.
---
Create two servers instead of Darkspear, called Darkspear-1 and Darkspear-2. Both of those servers share a naming database (if a name is taken on Darkspear-1, you can't use it on Darkspear-2). Whatever the population cap of Darkspear was going to be, Darkspear-1 and Darkspear-2 have a population cap half of it. So if Darkspear was intended to have 2000 players maximum, Darkspear-1 and Darkspear-2 each have a maximum of 1000.
---
At some point in the future, whenever Blizzard wants, Darkspear-1 and Darkspear-2 are merged back into Darkspear. No dynamic respawns, no phasing, no layering, no exploitation.
---
Well your point is highly subjective, though. I hated the theme and still enjoyed the gameplay. You don't knock an awesome product because you don't like the colour. Think South Park where Garrison invented the dildo bike. Everyone used it even though everyone hated the (entirely unnecessary) sexual components.
---
The overall product and what it offered was great, even through the huge downside of literally fucking you in the ass all the way. And that's way worse than kung fu panda jokes.
---
It's fine that you think the way you think. It's fine that it ruined your overall enjoyment. But reviews are supposed to be objective and an overall score cannot consist of the weakest link. Especially not if it's art direction. The hello kitty comparison is obviously also absurd hyperbole as the game largely still looked like WoW. And then if I had to weigh certain game elements against each other, art direction would not have such an overwhelming impact over gameplay.
---
Gameplay &gt; Art &gt; Music
---
Where each of those get further subdivisions (like leveling, endgame, raids, dungeons, reasons to regularly log in)
---
Taking one aspect of the game and saying the game is shit because that one aspect subjectively doesn't appeal to you is not how to write a fair review.
---
Dynamic respawn is, as the name says, *dynamic*. The spawn rates go back to normal as soon as there aren't 500 people in Durotar. It's flexible, gradual and it doesn't require any monitoring.
---
While that would be great. No one thinks that the servers will be bigger (in active players) one year after release.
---
I can't even log in to [battle.net](https://battle.net) so something is up.
---
There’s plenty of people playing, one or two pissed off healers or dps won’t come back to bite you. And everyone levels at a different pace anyway, so the chance of running into them again all the time is slim.
---
Back in my day, I fought in both gamer world wars, ate nails without milk for breakfast, and 360 no scoped noobs off the top of rust. Now we got these care bear SJW special snowflake gamers trying to ruin MY GAME!
---
Because it’s better than layering.
---
battle.net is down for a lot of people so it might have something to do with that.

Oooh, good to know! Thanks! 
---
I barely hung out in Westfall before heading for Stormwind. Someone else mentioned that after some time spent North of the city that I'll eventually head back to Westfall. Good to know there's a raid back there. I'll need to explore that area and find it. 
---
PS. My long post didn't include every detail of my journey. I was so tired when I wrote it, so I just blurted out the big parts that I remembered. But I DID fight Hogger because a nice guy shared a quest for him. We fought other knoll pigs around the area, and they kept ganging up on us. He was, unfortunately, one of the casualties, but he came back and we kept at it. That quest was really hard. I couldn't have completed it without him.
---
It breaks rogues out of stealth on a larger range than the Magma Totem does. :)
---
From my limited understanding, that isn't how layering works. Your thinking of sharding which is even easier to abuse.
---
Gonna be easy to reach 60 when you can escape every gank and get every quest item without a problem.
---
I hope I never see that guy in classic lol.
---
Sigh. Must there always be a carrot? At endgame you start gearing up. That's a whole new journey.
---
Its authentic vanilla experience to have 2 hour waits to log in. 
---
Its authentic vanilla experience to have 200 people fighting over 20 boar spawns.
---
I got this great zinger, Joe! What do you mean most people play sports?? Well there has to be a few who haven’t, right?? He dodged the question.. that means I got him for sure! He did it again? Maybe this wasn’t the zinger I hoped for... Better ask again to be sure!
---
&gt; Which isn't possible for rogue stealth in classic.
---
Fairly sure it is if you drink -&gt; stealth instead of stealth -&gt; drink.
---
I've always been Ally because friends wanted to. This time around I'm going Horde for sure.
---
It came up with an update and the options back
---
Night Elf. It's really only bis for druid on alliance side because it's the only choice.
---
Druid tank was a victim of circumstance in BC. People came from vanilla, where warrior was the universal tank and the changes to prot pala made them incredibly good tanks. So, you have people trying out the hot new prot paladain and traidtionalists, who swear by their warrior tanks and druids are left on the wayside.
---
It’s Back up
---
My only genuine hope is that all the people mindlessly defending layering as a necessary evil watch these videos and start criticizing Blizzard.
---
This is going to be a disaster. We're creeping on 2 months out, and layering is INCREASINGLY receiving more discoveries with abuse. I hope they abandon it for server mergers
---
In serious raiding guilds, there will be one enhancement shaman in the entire raid, and your main job is to have the ‘nightfall’ axe equipped and auto attack. 
---
In casual guilds, who cares lol play what is gonna be fun.
---
Any idea when the weapon damage enchant started working for ferals? I vividly remember it working for ferals at some point during TBC before they specifically removed it, and I always just expected it to have been in the game since vanilla.
---
The itch wont go away...
---
Yes and it had mobs spawning instantly instead of every 5 minutes. You people's delusions are amazing
---
Prevents dead servers in the long run.
---
So wear cloth spell damage gear?
---
If you plan to have fun and enjoy the leveling experience, I advise you to wait two to three weeks before playing.  Until then it will be 50 other assholes doing loops in a cave spamming tab and 1.
---
But we did play it, the data is out there still
---
It's very strange. I resubbed to BfA, levelled from 1-120. Did a bunch of dungeons along the way.
---
I don't think I spoke to anyone once, the entire time.
---
However 5 minutes into Classic and I got into a conversation with a guy that lasted a few hours, grouping up with people, chatting in general.
---
Why is there a difference between journalist and authors? They both write for a living, and need people to actually read their work for it to be sustainable.
---
This is disgusting
---
Keep fighting the fight Azzmo, and explaining it better than most of us can. The cluster idea sounds much better.
---
If you think that company the size of Activision-Blizzard is breaking their balls over server costs then you're absolutely fucking delusional.

of course it'll get downvoted into oblivion, this subreddit doesn't tolerate disliking layering.

You can sit here dejectedly with the rest of us, watching the clock count down haha!

Nope. Horde for life. ZUG ZUG.
---
Oh then I don't know why that guy linked the article then - it's got nothing to do with Classic.
---
So all comments where people claim  they could tank everything with insane threat on pservers are false. Druids  will still heal in classic.

I’m of the opinion that maybe we should just let Blizzard do their stress testing and beta testing and believe that the people that do this for a living and have been doing this have a plan. Just because they don’t discuss ever single aspect of it work you doesn’t mean they don’t have one.
---
omg I envy you so much 
---
&gt;How the heck to I get cool shoulder pads?
---
this is literally me. gotta wait till level 15 bro before you can get shoulders (if your lucky)
---
sounds like you would enjoy retail but love classic. no rd in playing retail until classic.
---
enjoy bro
---
The plan is already to not have layering in zones above level 30 and/or later phases...
---
I for sure feel like I'm way behind. I want to see everything! It feels like it'll take forever though. 
---
I don't know what MC is, but maybe I'll know when I see/hear it. 
---
One moment in particular that stuck out to me was entering Stormwind with the giant statues - the HUGE music swelled up and it felt epic. Only thing missing was other players. lol 
---
Oh, and this small moment where I went downstairs to some random building and found warlock NPC people. It was in a basement area, and the music suddenly changed to this ominous sound, but ONLY for that one tiny room. It went away once I went back up the stairs. It was a small detail, but I thought that was awesome.
---
Warlock. If you're unsure what to play, roll a Warlock.
---
Search around Stormwind explore, also talk to guards in the city pick different things from their menu and it will highlight things on the map. Go find them and just familiarize yourself with the systems. Then when you are ready to go on adventure goto part of city where you got the quest from the Dwarf to goto Loch Modan. There is a building in the most North part of that area. It will have a strange looking warp portal looking thing. That is the Deeprun Tram, it is the safe, quick (free) travel to Iron Forge. Outside of IF(iron forge) you will find Dun Morogh, you can quest here if your 9-10 there will still be some quests worth doing especially for a new player. Then take the road EAST to Loch Modan.  
---
Find a casual guild with like minded players and you will find the community you desire. This game is so much fun.
---
MMOs are products of their time.  Even if we kicked out every streamer fan, and if you use any of those emotes in my group you will be removed immediately, the game will never be like it was in Vanilla.  Even if it was created patch for patch in perfect it will never be like Vanilla.  Vanilla was something special, and for all who were lucky enough to experience it, it will remain as memory.
---
I sure hope you don’t get into my raid with those talents.
---
Woah woah slow down. I know BFA is awful but LAST JEDI AWFUL? Let's not get too far here.
---
At least BFA didn't retroactively ruin the franchise.
---
Still got mine and still using it to this day, cant be arsed unlinking it and moving over to the phone app, plus i like the nostalgia element.
---
Almost at the two months mark for LIVE LAUNCH, we're pretty much fucked unless they make a core philosophy change that there's a hard stop at week 1 or 2.
---
Two months is not enough time to fix something like this.
---
why wouldnt a hunter roll need on this? There is +2 Agi, and int too, boosting a Hunters attack power and mana pool for leveling. There are no other good rings at this level, so this is a major upgrade for a hunter.
---
The sub doesnt like people saying the same thing a million times without even understanding what's going on. There's already not going to be layering where it matters, this thread is pointless.
---
Stupid question but didn't this start at like, 11pm or later in EU? How is that prime time?
---
yeah that's what happens when you think i am going to resubscribe for a stress test. glad it didn't work out for them. should have not required active game time.
---
Yup had mine since they first came out (corehound).
---
Check out [Barrens.chat](https://Barrens.chat) \- it's a forum with its very own speedleveling thread with lists over the best times in every level-range and so on.

---
I don't think I ever went to the dark portal in vanilla, where is it?
---
&gt;I didn't bother to respond to these because it's just a strawman,
---
You don't know what a strawman is...
---
Maybe you could argue it was a Red Herring, but it certainly wasn't a strawman. 
---
&gt;realistically 20% of the server will never layer hop 
---
So 80% will?  See you don't understand maths well. If 80% of the pop hopes it will always balance itself. 
---
Also I played during MoP a bit and MOST people used invites and addons to hop servers and they weren't even overcrowded as they will be on classic. You are just 100% wrong on this.
---
&gt; You're not supposed change layer without party invite or similar, the examples you give were even confirmed by blizzard to be bugs.
---
This maybe, i grant the possibility that it will go 3k on one layer and 1 person on the the next. As i have stated like 3 times now. But you are too 'Correct' to read or consider this. 
---
&gt;One person on a 3k server does not automatically translate to 3 people on a 9k pop server
---
I have made the mathematical argument that it does. You are just asserting this without even saying why. Unless you think leading the pack is an argument which i have already mathematically established why that is just bad understanding of how numbers and reality works.  
---
Again. If you are in the top 1% of levels/profession skills on a 3k server there are 29 others along side you.  On a 9k server there are 89 others along side you. However, there is also 3 times the number of resources.  This equals out the the same amount of resources. There is no advantage save possibly so many non-contested nodes that having someone repeatedly invite you to all other layers allows you to loot that node multiple times.  This is an issue but its fixable with layer switching CDs or fixing you and any group you are in to a single layer after you switch say 2-3 times within an hour or something. Like you are doomsdaying something that is easily fixable. And even if they don't fix this at all. After a day or two when there are tons of people your level and profession skill this tactic will no longer be that useful (might be useful to go to a lower pop layer, but not to hot swap layers for the same node over and over). 
---
So all this complaining about a minimal benefit ... WHY? Verses server health, longevity, and lower queues. Come on its not even a close trade off; Layering's benefits vastly outweigh your stated issues so far.
---
And do you realize that when more than 1000 players start in elwynn forest at the same time on each server, you're gonna have a bad time?
---
False information.
---
Says the other stuff they got wrong
---
How much do you enjoy tanking?
---
For me I'll be maining a Warrior with a Warlock alt, but tanking is by far my favourite thing in the game.
---
post it then
---
&gt; My only dilemma is what to do until the next Classic stress test. 
---
Try Retail, you paid for the subscription anyway, so why not? 
---
Keep in mind that many of the people here are very bitter about the way the game has changed, but you have a fresh perspective, you might like Retail as well. There's nothing wrong with liking both, despite what people here might tell you. 
---
It's true that the leveling experience is much more solo-oriented, but the game is NOT anti-social like the other guy said, UNLESS you want to play it that way. You can get yourself in a guild and there are plenty of friendly people - and at max level it's all about group content. 
---
Remember, most of the people here are very, very biased. Hating on the current WoW is part of the group think, you can make up your own mind while you wait for release/next stress test.
---
Your limited understanding.
---
As opposed to leveling a char to get your dopamine fix
---
This guy is breaking the game like a tester should be
---
Just drop layering all together. Don't fucking bother.
---
You lose them. The only reason to rank up is to get the gear.
---
This is encouraging to know, so thank you! 
---
Someone else mentioned that I should start a character in a different location for the regular game and then compare once Classic fully releases. I think I'll follow that advice because I don't know how to be patient for 2 more months! Playing WoW for the first time during testing probably wasn't the wisest choice, but this was my first real opportunity so I jumped in!
---
Link it then and get all the karma, people have been looking for it.
---
Yup I always play the beta. On bfa, tbc and Wrath it’s horde, but in Classic Alliance is the meta so I’m going Alliance.
---
This is the one I have.
---
How come the vanilla purists are not advocating for having to sit 6 hours in queue to log in, and when they do server crashes and becomes unavailable for weeks at a time? 
---
That's real vanilla experience.
---
The battery died in mine and had to scan my ID to get it removed.
---
&gt; at launch
---
Unless they're planning on launching at 2PM on a weekday, I'm not entirely sure this is representative. Shit, even if they did launch at that time, it'd likely be under a much heavier load.
---
Update: He eventually died, maybe it was a visual bug, rather than giving underwater breathing?
---
Oh, I guess that justifies layering!
---
Is this for MOBA?  
---
Me and others operate off of 48 keybinds.. you highlighted like 1/4 of that lol :P  
---
Seriously tho nice looking keyboard
---
Amen
---
Great but why tell us. It is a beta after all, specifically so these things can be reported to blizzard.
---
If you have a funny bug do share, but this isn't a funny one.
---
lol ok
---
&gt; But it will only be a thing during the first few weeks
---
I mean if that was the case I'd be fine with it but I heard phase one which is LONG.
---
I have the same thing this morning. Looks like it's just residual unfortunately. I was really excited when I opened the launcher and saw it changed to Beta instead of stress test. Oh well.
---
The fighting over kills got real old real fast.  I logged rather quickly yesterday.  I'm going to suffer through that nonsense on launch day and only launch day.
---
I have relaunched it and downloaded some patches. However since yesterday evening the button just says You cant play classic yet, as in the picture. Maybe it has something to do with the stresstest currently running.
---
Not sure what server you played on, but dynamic respawns are dogshit and are incapable of recognizing zone playercount vs total playercount, you have mobs spawn in 3 seconds in Teldrassil 3 years after server release, making a lot of quests undoable.
---
Still in Blasted Lands.
---
Not at all. In fact it'll be super easy - barely an inconvenience! 
---
Every time you run out of quests you just grind a level appropriate humanoid mob - tons of those all over ^^
---
It was most likely client sided, yea.
---
Whats going on then?
---
Warlock on alliance side
---
Lmao based
---
I mean, just look at the other posts.
---
No one wants to play a mutated Classic where people can vanish from pvp in an instant, or escape a ganker in STV by changing layers, or having people constantly join your dungeon group only to bail because they wanted a layer swap.
---
Most importantly, people don’t want to feel like they’re playing sub-optimally by *not* attempting to game layering exploits.
---
It will suck for your average player who’s going to be at a disadvantage if they *dont* pull shit like this because they’ll be worrying about it instead of simply enjoying the game.
---
Classic is meant to be one big world. A world where you recognize your friends and enemies. A world where people don’t just vanish away all over the place.
---
Just keep trying, you can log on August 27th
---
So much this ^++.
---
I wish blizzard would've gone with separate subscription from retail. The fact is that WoW Vanilla was not a game for casuals. At least not if you want to clear content and see every aspect of the game. Now we will have players that used to play WoW but don't anymore, private server vanilla players, retail players and completely new players. Blizzard should cater to the former two instead of the latter two.
---
whats the difference between horde and alliance warlock ?
---
&gt;12k concurrent players which is more than double what each realm will be capped at in classic.
---
What? Hello? Even if we assume the lowest numbers possible per layer(3.5k), at just 3 layers we are already looking at 10.5k people.
---
And I personally think it will be around 5 layers per "realm" when that whole mechanic goes away, so you're gonna have about 16k people per server.
---
&gt;I'm "playing the right way" by getting lost and asking people for help.
---
simply put, you're a noob.
---
Just like everyone of us were, at some point in the past.
---
Enjoy it, the fresh sense of exploring is the best part of the game.
---
If you are doing heavy progression, do you really need a blacklist to get a guild full of people anyway?
---
Glad i saw this, i've played the same druid in all capacities (tank, dps, healer) since 2004 when it came out right up to BFA and whilst i remember how druids were back in Vanilla i wanted to be sure before committing. So as a refresher for Classic (which i cant wait for as i cannot stand most modern day players and how the game has turned out), i rolled a druid to help make up my mind if i was going down the druid route again, so far i've been having a ball smashing anything in my path from lvl10-35 in either bear or feral, now i know why.
---
I did put links in the post for a better understanding.
---
I would hardly say the 10k pop servers were representative of good economies
---
That is a really crisp Surprised Pikachu
---
Pretty sure most people here are using those terms interchangably. You know, how people will say a group of average performers who can complete a raid are getting carried if someone overperforms?
---
After trying out the stress test last night, I wish anyone the best of luck trying to break the record. The competition for mobs was insane.
---
&gt;Are you going to say that this behavior also points to classic having cross realm grouping?
---
Yeah i do because their will be cross realm BGs right? Bam, i can play shitty games and be less than honest too. 
---
Oh ps this would be a strawman :P
---
I don't know man i can keep saying i am not sure what they will end up doing i can only comment on what i KNOW is currently occurring.
---
Not here lol. I'd 100% go Shadow Priest and be done with it if I could honestly know for sure I'll be able to raid. The only classes I enjoy are Shadow priest, Rogue (i was a rogue originally in Vanilla so don't wanna do it twice), Feral, and somewhat Lock. 
---
Shadow priest I enjoy the most but it just goes oom soooooo fricken fast.
---
Rogue already played, but honestly I'm not crossing it off completely
---
Feral I like the DPS and tanking, but I feel like I'd be in the same position as Shadow Priest. I'm also not sitting in Gnomer 15 hours a week just to be an off tank
---
Lock was going to be my go to, but the more I tried it on pservers the more it just felt stale. Immobile, extremely boring pve rotation, etc.
---
Funny thing is I was obsessed with hunters in Vanilla. Now I can't even play them. Incredibly awkward and boring to me.
---
Thank you for the info!!
---
They could manage this problem very well with simple server mergers as long as they stay on top of their game. Merging a month old communities will not cause permanent damage.
---
They weren't talking about ninja looters though. That kind of blacklist IS completely warranted. 
---
They are talking about what seemed clear to me, blacklisting players they deemed inferior simply due to the spec not being meta.
---
so after that happens you have 2 characters on the same layer, is the idea to create new alts everytime you want to do this?
---
How about waiting a few days until you play if this bothers you so much.
---
I strongly disagree with tip 8.  I try to sell whenever I pass a vendor because it all saves towards buying training or mounts later on.
---
They lost immortality after mount hyjal, no?
---
aight, looks like we just misunderstood each other. Have a good day and enjoy classic, man!
---
all Europeans are vampires
---
30 minute cooldown to interact with people? Moreso with friends? :thinking:
---
Some older dev that worked on original vanilla WoW recently came out and said they had dynamic respawns in the original game.
---
Right, and you’d know because you played pserver?
---
If you did, you’d know that measures were put in to stabilize the economy and counter things like farm routes, DM, BRD runs, and they worked. 
---
Not only is Classic not going to have these farm tweaks, meaning they’ll be insanely profitable instead of nerfed on pserver, but Classic will *also* have 8x layers to hop between to farm lotus.
---
Economy will be a fucking joke. 
---
If they keep layering the first MC runs will have half the players flasked and 100% mounts will be the norm, destroying the true economy grind of vanilla
---
I gotta admit, it does take a lot of skill looking at the default castbar. Hopefully this addon will help others who aren’t as proficient.
---
The tank was probably chinese.
---
It's also quite strictly enforced here in Germany. I changed my doctor recently due to moving to another city. First thing they asked before the procedure was when my last X-ray was then he insisted on using the old pictures instead of making new ones. So yes they take the patients radiation dosage seriously. Of course if I where to need emergency help radiation dosage takes a back seat.
---
Fucking idiots dude, there's no arguing with those people.
---
I still don't buy that logic. If it's a stress test you want to invite as many as possible.  Plenty of night owls in EU who would still have happily helped pad server capacity.
---
Playing against lots of undeads and tremor totems makes fearing very difficult.
---
What is that logic? "Obviously if you don't think standing in one spot for well over an hour trying to kill 1 mob type for 1 quest is an enjoyable experience you must be a casual player." I get that you'd rather have no layering but please don't pretend like a large number of players would enjoy that experience. Would you be equally unhappy if there were simply a large numbers of separate servers with 3k caps?
---
Ur doing it wrong, grinding mobs is way more efficient than trying to wait for quest mobs
---
what about my small?
---
Did anyone else "play" the alpha version where you could host your own server and walk around the world without any mobs or really any interaction in it?
---
We spent a whole weekend setting that up and couldn't even see one another, let alone fight or even see mobs, but we knew something awesome was waiting for us.
---
modern X-ray machines don't radiate in all directions equally 
---
when your head is getting x-rayed at the dentist then your nads shouldn't need additional protection
---
How about you don't play classic if layering bothers you so much?
---
That's the problem though. It's the people that have been doing this for years. We had various occasions where there was something alarming in early beta stages of the respective WoW version which had its reports ignored only to be addressed, apologized for and changed way after releasing it in the broken state that *surprisingly* turned out to be a bad thing for the game.
---
It doesn’t have to be
---
Layering is still not the solution
---
Don't mind personally them being anal about things; it's good to keep Blizz's ass to the fire even if it's for stupid unreasonable things.
---
I am myself concerned that community will be dead on arrival because of logical conclusion to Layering and cross-realm battlegrounds - but nobody seems to be thinking about that just yet.
---
Expecting unprecedented player growth for half a decade after launch of classic is naive.
---
Some basic limitations in layering will solve 90% of the problems, but avoiding dead servers and login queues. 
---
Layering is a problem for a few weeks at launch at most.
---
I'm currently subscribed and will be mostly switching to classic when it's officially released, but I never play beta versions of games (especially rpgs) because it's just wasted time.
---
I love these comments. We played classic like that back in the day yes. Yes you waited in line for quests and it was glorious when you pulled ahead
---
im hearing the loud and distorted DING!!!! on teamspeak. Congrats mate you are now lvl 14
---
This feels accurate.
---
EU: Am I a joke to you?
---
There are solutions to that. And in any case, layering is still much worse than dead servers.
---
Meh anyone with brain knows ench shaman sucks hard as u are literally a melee warrior with no gapclosers and just gonna get kited.
---
Altough this is pretty biased in retro wow vs t3 gears
---
your merger plan isn't better imo.
---
If your main concern is the community, how is merging 2 or more that never interacted better?
---
Who cares its launch day, you're acting like that's the only day you can play. 
---
#nochanges, it shouldn't be in at all
---
&gt;My only dilemma is what to do until the next Classic stress test.
---
don't bother with the stress tests.
---
Try to setup things in RL so that you have free days when Classic gets released.
---
Okaay duude
---
Your guild will fail...
---
You my friend, are my new hero. I remember the sheer wonder of experiencing WoW back at launch and how incredible the experience was. Being able to see someone experience the game as it should be for the first time is very refreshing. 
---
Don't jump into retail. Wait until Classic releases. Experience the game in one of its better forms, not the disjointed mess it is now.
---
It doesn't help that there's a very loud contingent of people that are super pro-layering on this subreddit and will downvote and valid discussion and lash out at anyone that's critical of the system.
---
If Blizzard has to choose between who to listen to, of course they're going to side with the group of people who support their idea, even if it's tremendously damaging to the game.
---
Look at this no friends loser.
---
For example here. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/everything-we-definitively-know-about-classic/25299
---
&gt;Blizzard has stated that - at the latest- the layering will be removed by the beginning of content bucket #2
---
This is on a stickied by blizzard post. If you read all the blue post mentioning layering they always say it is meant to be on only at the start - either only in the first weeks (at most until phase 2 probably earlier), probably zone-only which they havent confirmed. Either way, we wont really be  layer-farming at 60.
---
Honestly the best thing about classic is blizz is getting all the data back so private servers can be more accurate without being ran by modern blizzard
---
The thing about blizzard is, they do not care about world pvp. Pre Activision purchase they did, but now a days retail player's have no idea what it even means.
---
They'll will only realize when they have to pay 70 g for one devilsaur leather or 1000 g for the whole ser. Or basically any high end gear/consumable they want to get. When it's to expensive they'll farm it themselves they think...hu I'm getting camped? Whelp there is no node or herb up in this area, wierd?
---
You know, as someone who's played on every major private server. I find it fascinating people tell me we NEED layering. Somehow homemade garage brewed swill managed to get 5k+ people to stick around through ques and downtime, and guess what, no layering.
---
People don't realize how much work and effort went into these Private Servers. Hate them all you want, but a lot were made out of love for the game (Nost). They have a superior product to Classic right now, IMO. Maybe they're too challenging compared to the original, but I like that. Biggest thing is, they don't have layering, it's a single living breathing world. It's the most important aspect of an MMORPG, and Classic doesn't have it.
---
wait a minute are you saying pservers arent blizzlike?
---
=o
---
Sure, but I really, really, just do not want to bother with any layer hopping because I am trying to play efficiently which I absolutely will have to bother with. It adds another layer of complexity to the game which I do not find that engaging.
---
This is exactly what they're trying to avoid with layering.
---
They don't want to spin up 20 servers and have 18 of them be graveyards and require free character transfers or mergers.
---
They'd rather have 5 servers with 3 layers each that consolidate over time.  In other words, they expect an initial rush and a dropoff of interest.
---
After doing some testing and finding out that 5man dungeon leveling is indeed the fastest way to hit 60 in Classic, decided to give an outline overview of how to accomplish it for people who've been asking about using leveling guides in groups!
---
You'll need an ignore list add-on if classic has the same player limit as vanilla did.
---
But what spec will your hunter be?
---
Druid
---
No, people aren't doing this.  They are comparing it to classic wow, but not saying classic is getting these things wrong.
---
It's the only thing we've had for 15 years to compare the new game to.  It needs to be compared so we can re-theorycraft how the game is actually going to work in August.
---
Why even respond when you're too lazy to put up another point for me to destroy 😈😈😈
---
Oh right, that's because you don't have any 😂😂😂
---
Good point.
---
2 hrs would be better
---
Start a petition, I'll sign it.
---
Without the addon you'll just see the emote names eg. PogChamp, LUL etc. The addon just replaces those words in chat with an image
---
It's a perfect excuse for Blizzard too. Ion can keep saying it's so important to remove layering, but when the population is still too high, they are just going to say "Well we totally *want* to remove layering, but we can't because there are too many people. Sorry!"
---
The infuriating part is that people will fall for it. Sharding isn't going away. They do not, nor have they ever, had the intention of removing it. They know it's wrong, otherwise they wouldn't have tried to deceive the dans by renaming it to layering.
---
They are testing it in the beta so they turn it up and change it. That's what beta is for.
---
They've announced multiple times that there'll be no layering later in the game (very lastest by phase2) and possibly (unconfirmed but considered) layering in higher zones in the actual game.
---
I feel it's worth having until everyone has weapon chains on or you are raiding. Then it's 6 wasted talent points.
---
The spec is pretty useless for end game raiding
---
If you genuinely believe that the explanation to this is something as asinine as "server frugality" from **Activision-Blizzard**, then I have a tinfoil hat for you.
---
Phase 2 is going to most likely be measured in months, not weeks. What kind of cherry picking are you trying to pull off here?
---
That my friend is incredible stupid. How can you say something like that while posting information which literally contradicts what you just said? Phase 2 is **months** away. You should know how people talk. Months is technicially also "a few weeks". Everyone who plays more than 1hour a day will be 60 at that point, raids will be on farm for weeks at that point. Not to mention that of course everything above 30 is affected by layering aswell and people will layer farm the fuck out of it at 60. I mean holy, you just said everything possible thing wrong.
---
Thats the mindset that will get them to never shut down layering.
---
I never used the defaults either, always hid the castbar just because I hated having a bunch of stuff on my screen. Hopefully I will be able to do the same in Classic.
---
This wasn't actually a think back in legit vanilla, was it?
---
At least I never knew about it back then.
---
I thought this was introduced as a result of the system that was later implemented in Cataclysm (?) that allowed you to encounter people from other realms. (sharding?)
---
That's what everyone talks about at Max level. Get used to it
---
Feral tanks are not a meme spec
---
Reading posts on the other sub, seeing people rage about bubble hearth. 
---
I never understood it because when I would be running somewhere on my mount say to BlackRock mt.
---
Dismounting and destroying a paladin and seeing him bubble, wave and hearth, always felt like a win to me.
---
I really like it, but I'm also not very good at it. So it's a bit of a matter of "others are more worthy".
---
Half the complainers won't even be max level by then.
---
&gt;So 80% will?  See you don't understand maths well. If 80% of the pop hopes it will always balance itself
---
No, I was referring to the 20% being too high, which I think you fully understood but decided to inentionally misinterpret me...
---
&gt; I have made the mathematical argument that it does. You are just  asserting this without even saying why. Unless you think leading the  pack is an argument which i have already mathematically established why  that is just bad understanding of how numbers and reality works. 
---
Lets say you have 2 3k layers, overall they're going to follow the same distribution roughly but the top 1% or top 0.5% have a high risk of being distinctly different. It does not follow in practice that 1 person on a 3k server equals 3 players on 9k server(unless you're looking across the board of servers, but that's hardly what we're doing here). There is an issue, blizzard has not even adressed this yet let alone proposed a solution yet I'm branded as a doomsayer by you for bringing it up. 
---
&gt; So all this complaining about a minimal benefit ... WHY? 
---
You want to know why? Because I had this exact same discussion(okay, a few terms were different) on the wow forums when sharding was introduced. Just like now, the entire forum was an echo chamber where everyone loved the idea on paper, but failed to see the consequences it had in game. The mentality "don't worry, blizzard will fix it" was also present and look where that got us.
---
So excuse me if I'm keen on joining your brigade, but I have my reasons for it.
---
You are way ahead of the curve by thinking about this my friend. When layering ends, we gonna end up with 15-20k population realms that also have cross-realm BG's enabled as default - no close knit community where people know each other will exist.
---
Yikes
---
Cool, this is already the high quality content under which flag my shitpost was deleted?
---
I ain't even mad, have an upvote!
---
Or literally any other MMO
---
They've also said AT THE VERY LATEST by phase 2, and are considering it for zones without a petition. Do you really want them to lock themselves by saying it will only be on for the first 97 hrs or something? They are testing how it pans out so they know when to stop it and where to disable it...
---
But sure, worst case scenarios there'll be a month where those ahead of the pack will be able to farm more. Most likely a lot less time, they just havent given the exact details because they are currently tuning it.
---
Of course it wasn't. Simply put it is a mechanic to avoid putting up more Servers to distribute the population which will have to be merged at a later state of Classic WoW. It's a shitty money saving feature.
---
It matters in every stage of the game
---
I agree. I'm probably just going to play normally, and I think most people will. 
---
I'm way more worried about realms "dying" after a month or two than I am about layering though. Which is why I am defending it somewhat. I would be ok with having lots of servers at launch and merging them later, but that has a lot of problems as well, and I honestly think using layering to avoid that as much as possible is a good idea. They just have to work out a version of layering that has as little impact on gameplay as possible.
---
Wouldn't it be possible to make a comparison at level 58?
---
Easy? Tell me how, because I've been playing there for like a month and don't have shit
---
It's alright, Battle for Azeroth Beta Feedback was well received and acted upon the concerns of the community by developers - and we are well on our way year into the expansion that it starts to look somewhat playable.
---
Yeah it’s great in pvp. Tears up other melee classes. In pve it’s alright, I think naxx weapons scale better with gear. It’s just too fast as a mainhand.
---
Or you could just invite fuckload amount of yet uninvited EU people and you can bet the servers will be flooded at 11pm and even further. Fuck sleep, I am a real Vanilla player, I can get by 3 hours of sleeping for important occasions!
---
Yet sadly, they did some things better than the sequels.
---
Nah you can still adjust resources, it's not like anyone has stand alone physical servers anymore.
---
Yea aside from the part where he promoted JoshOG's scam site and stole thousands of dollars from his viewers, he's a pretty good guy.
---
I make new friends all the time in Retail. Have you ever even played Retail or are you just judging it based off what some Youtubers and Redditors say?
---
Thanks for letting me know. This is all very helpful. 
---
Someone else mentioned that I should follow that quest to the North of stormwind because there's supposed to be more for me to do there. So I'll for sure try to accomplish all that with the 24 hours left to play. 
---
Thanks again!
---
Yeah I would have actually hopped on for that.

No layering at all please.

Yes you are right. Even less reason to use shadowmeld as a rogue. It only makes sense then if your stealth is still on CD.
---
1. 1.12.
---
2. No.
---
No. No changes. No changes. No layering. We don’t want server stability we want server community and to avoid layering exploitation. No changes. Fuck layering
---
there has been daily threads about layering
---
Aaand this comment about it being "free" is why I just hear a rumor about some guy who just bought a domain registered and hosted in a country that doesn't recognize international copyright law with dozens of hours of free time committed to transcribing every podcast available and publishing publicly.
---
Or maybe that was just a rumor, at any rate, this is a standard bearing example of how to NOT handle issues of "unsavory" content distribution. You absolutely do stand to profit from content like this either immediately or with the goal of future monetary compensation via exposure gleaned from content such as this. Nothing is free.
---
And let's be clear, there's nothing wrong with an expectation of compensation, monetarily or otherwise. The reason people take issue with your free statement is that anyone with a true lack of interest in benefit of content they create wouldn't give two shits about a transcript. You're making two very contradictory statements and people in this day and age now understand their intrinsic value as a content consumer and have rightly called bullshit.

1. Not to sure what you mean by question 1 but it will be patch 1.12

Above level 20 even
---
It's better to sit for 6 hours in queue, just to finally log in and have the server crash on you, then the server goes down for 3 days for maintenance and "improvements", and that happens regularly for, let's say, 6 months after launch.
---
And you might say that modern server's are way better equipped to deal with that, and you'd be right, but you'd also be blind to believe Vanilla had anywhere near the amount of people that will be logging in for Classic, at least for first month.
---
Sure bro.
---
Yes, I played pservers: those things those servers did to stabilize it are significant changes to classes. They worked to minimize the effect of it while changing how the game works, permanently. Also don't forget these servers added dynamic respawns to a game that already has some of it, these servers had increased green drops in chests. Pservers are great, but their economies aren't a good representation of the original game.
---
I'm off this week, so daytime in US would have been great. But it started at 4pm my time, and I often don't have free time in the evenings. So I logged in, walked around for 5 minutes and logged out. No point in bothering with it if I can't actually play the game more than the starter zones and more than a day or so.
---
I'm still confused at how you know what layer each character is in to begin with???
---
Trying to figure out what I should play based on play style.  I know I want to heal and PVE has always been my preferred way to play. I don’t mind if leveling is slow or not I just want to be able to offer the best heals possible for raids. I’m also horde all the way.
---
Which class, race and professions do any of you recommend?
---
You know when it started, tryhard never meant people who put effort in. It meant you. It meant people who put effort in to playing other people's character. It meant people who saw some pro player's weird spec and then switched to it without knowing what made it work.
---
Can't wait to avoid world bosses being camped with layers. And avoiding PvP by changing to a less populated layer.
---
Going to be fighting for kills all the way up
---
It is. At least on naughty servers.
---
I feel kind of bad how much time you wasted... But I guess that's what unintelligent people do.
---
The "ratio" you speak of maintaining a 3:1 as population increases in itself is an increase in resources. These layers can be traversed through in various ways, therefore there's more net resources on the total server. The worst part is its not smoothly balanced, it will be focused by the people that know how to work the system. 
---
This was a sad attempt...
---
It seems the casters feel entitled to this ring because of the +6 int but they conveniently forget about the +2 agi that has virtually no benefit to them. This is more of a hunter/ Druid ring IMO.
---
I agree, could be a big Private Server boom very soon after Blizz ruins this game. Private servers have a better product already (no layering ), and a more challenging game. There's a couple things they can probably learn from &amp; take from Classic WoW to improve on also. Plus it's all free. Blizz will probably never remove layering &amp; add a cash shop, and whatever else Blizz does nowadays. Private Servers aren't going anywhere, they will just get better.
---
It is known
---
Phase 1 this will definitely work... you need to know what is worth your time killing and what is better to avoid or CC and run...  
---

---
It seems all over the place but let me provide some info...
---
Balance
---
Natures Grasp, great against melee and pets 
---
Imp wrath, take this cuz Imp Natures grasp is a waste
---
Moonfire does great spammable (watch your mana) Damage for finishing - so boost it with damage and crit chance
---
shapeshifting and natures reach, mana efficiency and keeping things max distance 
---
vegenance gives your spell crits more dmg  
---
Feral  
---
Cat for avoiding and opening 
---
Bear for self defense, stun, charge, and very important damage debuff to physical opponents...
---
Restoration 
---
Tools to assist your feral because you need quick activations for your abilities since you shouldn't be spending alot of time in those forms...
---
insect swarm more dots and reduce their chance to hit you
---
healing talents for pvp and natures swiftness to save your ass  
---
\+ again more mana regen   
---
in phase 1 there is going to be alot of under geared players.... dotting them up and keeping yourself alive is all you need to kill other players...
---
Well I mean every zone from 30 onwards. That includes Vietnam.
---
shitty dynamic respawn does that...
---
you mentioned the fix needed to make it work yourself...have it look at players in zone instead of total players. I doubt that is technically impossible, probably not even a huge thing to change
---
For a tank fuck yeah but for a rogue meh.  Rogues get access to some crazy dps weapons including +wep skill ones for at least daggers and maces. A rogue with AW and MSA will beat someone with TF and say Mala.
---
I first saw the word tryhard in wow. It was referencing the people who liked telling everyone else how to play their characters (not talking constructive criticism here) or those who jumped on strange specs pro players made work in specific circumstances without knowing why and when those specs worked and insisted they were the only way to play X class.
---
Like... 2 60s in a 2 week period, sleep and MC clears included?
---
Good luck!
---
FYI, this technology has basically been replaced by a phone app that works the same way: someone needs to have both your phone and your password in order to login as you. Back in when these were popular, most people didn't have smartphones.
---
You are the one fucking up the game by asking for 10k+ people per server. That's not how it was back then, so...No. Changes. Don't fuck up our game with your selfish bullshit.
---
Female Orcs. Don't be another UD rogue. Way too many of those.
---
You describe Balance as being not recommended unless the player really knows what they're doing, and also that it improves a lot with raid gear.
---
I don't know much about max level Druid PvP, **would you mind expanding on why it's not recommended?** Also, does it become a more reasonable option if you can pick up raid pieces, or does it remain a bad choice?
---
Thanks, Malfurion.
---
Yeah the "accessibility friendliness" is wild, but my guess is that blizzard just wants to get through launch with as few people as possible complaining. 
---
Then after a  couple months people will stop complaining about how layering rocked the economy and wpvp for the first few weeks.
---
Oh look, insider "information" that phase 2 is 1 month even though the average player won't even be in the position of doing MC to its full extent at that point totally invalidating the DM dynamics they're trying to do with these 2 phases. 
---
Average player, don't comment on that people will clear MC far quicker... average player.
---
A P2 transition in 1 month literally makes close to zero sense.
---
In the image, you have the Beta version selected.  
---
Click the drop down and change it to Classic.
---
&gt; their economies aren’t a good representation of the original game
---
When the original game was out, BRD runs, diremaul farming, aoe farming, none of this was known and widespread.
---
By nerfing those farming methods pservers stayed truer to the actual gold supply earned by players, than if they did nothing.
---
So they actually did have a fairly good representation of gold economy in true vanilla.
---
Nelf Drood here, man. Going to tame the wilds of Kalimdor. Hope to see you in Moonglade!
---
As a leveling rogue I'd go combat anyway for that sweet +hit. Riposte is just icing on the cake.
---
Layering should only exist in non-contested zones ... so pretty much what you are asking for with the exception of some earlier zones like hillsbrad, thousand needles, wetlands, redridge, duskwood, ashenvale...
---
&gt; Both launches sucked for the first couple days
---
Days, sure.
---
What part of the OPs post makes you think he doesn’t understand layering?
---
Except for the fact that sharding isn't in the game and layering will only be active for the first phase. Suck it up.
---
Easy to fix dead servers, not so much having 20k pop realms.
---
You have to look at the big picture. WoD was very heavily marketed. They had a huge ad on freaking Times Square. So they got a lot of people coming back and probably even new people to try out. People that had already quit during the "better" expansions. Alas they still didn't like WoW anymore.
---
How does it matter, when it's not going to be ON in every stage of the game.
---
Yes I would appreciate a fixed window of time like 2 weeks, aswell as a "every zone starting at level 30 won't be affected by layering.
---
Not even close.
---
Ya that’s not how it is here. 
---
Here it only matters if it’s happening to your boss. I’m in Houston we flood , we have tornados , we have traffic that can add an hour to your commute and unless your boss was in that flood or that traffic or had that flu.
---
So what, seems the fix would be to somehow make the client remember your layer even after the game is exited. Is that even possible?
---
This is a paladin performing the [Bubble Hearth](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bubble_Hearth).
---
Yeah layering is definitely going to kill the game. I don't understand it, there are so many layering-defenders that just just want to solo quests without any competition, and I think they are missing the point of classic. There's so many fun things to do other than grinding quests by yourself.
---
It’s definitely bis till Naxx. But some have done sims and claim it’s bis forever because of the proc damage. It’s an ongoing debate.
---
It feels a lot like Breath of the Wild in terms of exploring content on my own and feeling kind of lost. I don't like backtracking very much though. lol
---
You have not played on pirate server releases, have you?
---
Well, thats how it pretty much is tho.
---
I played for the official "stress test" hours and it was pretty interesting.
---
I had created a new character on Test Realm 3 right at 5PM (EST) but found it to be literally IMPOSSIBLE to kill anything - infinitely more players than available mobs. However over the next hour or so, somehow without me really even noticing, they layered the server several times and really cranked up the spawn rates. While the first hour or so was more or less unplayable, by about 6:45 (EST) I felt they had really struck an excellent balance of letting the server feel alive while also letting it be playable.
---
IDK, i was pretty impressed. There were very serious lag spikes, which were probably new layers being made and players being shifted around on them, but otherwise the experience felt pretty great and made me feel good about launch. It seemed like players I'd actually interacted with in any way (whispers, duels, even taggin the same mobs) stayed on our shard, no idea what happened to everyone else but I continued to recognize names through the experience even as it was getting noticeably de-populated by shards / layers.
---
He doesn't understand what blizzard have said a bunch of times - they are tuning layering so it's only on at the start of the game - be it only the first X amount of time or the first X amount of zones or both. He is starting a petition for them to do what they are doing.
---
Oh right! Because it’s not like they’ve came straight out and said they don’t have nearly as many GMs hence the loot issues, and they can’t afford to look at loot on a event by event basis.
---
And! It’s not like in recent years Blizz has changed and become very cost focused, like that time they basically killed HotS out of the blue?
---
Enough about my ideas - if you think this truly has nothing to do with cost, tell us your opinion.
---
In your mind, why are they electing to choose a method that destroys immersion and economy and sacrifice player experience?
---
I got off work and got home soon as I could, I got off at 5pm and it started at 5pm.  Was at character creation screen and it disconnected.   I tried to find something online about what was going on but figured they were working on it.  I did see there were 2 pvp servers but couldn't make a character.   Waited an hour and connected again, finally found on the forums where other players were discussing them shutting down to less servers, no posts from blizz....    Finally made a character but couldn't quest because so many people in the starting zone.    I tried for a while but I wasn't spending that much time trying to get a quest done on a character that will be wiped.
---
Agreed - just interesting to see the lead up show servers numbered to 21, then to 16 (but only 10 avtive) then they allowed character creation 30 minutes prior, then shut off 8 of the servers because the servers weren't getting stressed enough. 
---
Think they shut them off for a solid 4 hours then only brought back a couple servers.
---
I'm hoping that means they really got a chance to test their layering thoroughly for those starter zones :)
---
You can tell it's an Alliance keyboard because the PvP key is Escape
---
Yeah man, you’re destroying points! Coolest guy in your homeroom!
---
It talks about the fact that only 30% of the players (free account included) go past lvl 10. Since it's pre-cataclysme, lvl 10 is vanilla content. So it is linked to the discussion.
---
I ALWAYS protect the nads.
---
A quick skim through this subreddit paints a very different picture. Dare I say the majority of people voicing their opinion are delusionally defending layering and that "it's beta, this is what beta is for"
---
Not OP but I can try to explain as I am a software developer. Preface: I don't work at blizzard so this is taking an educated guess on how I believe layering works.
---
There are two types of scaling, vertical and horizontal.
---
Vertical -&gt; think of it as 1 computer that you constantly throw more hardware into as you need it.
---
Horizontal -&gt; more similar to a bunch of computers working together.
---
Layering is most likely horizontal so they can turn "computers" on and off as they need them. Scaling this way means that each individual computer (1 layer) has much less hardware than a single "mega computer" (vertical).
---
Pricing wise, vertical scaling costs are exponential where as horizontal costs are linear. Both can be scaled up and down on demand but obvious linear costs will win out.
---
This, theoretically, could save an absolute ton of money at blizzard scale
---
No, I mean to keep layering past when they need it.
---
I believe classic uses the newer macro system so it can use the more modern versions
---
Tanking on K**nos as a feral was a joke, even at 60. Like swipe and thorns was all you needed... I'd have been nice to actually need to do something to hold threat.
---
Was never even in ghost wolf. Not a real enh shaman.
---
Wait are you saying there will be more resources because of layering? You know the big pservers cores have like really fast resource respawn rates right? (I don't think you did know this.) Black lotus is super fast (~20mins before being decreased even more by dynamic respawn rates.) All other nodes etc have 3 times the respawn rate as vanilla and are effected by dynamic rates.
---
Come on. This is what i am talking about. People are complaining about maybe someone getting a few more items for a day or two with layering. And then they say stuff like: 'Oh no, the game will be over. You know those pservers did it much better.' All the while pservers provide FAR more resources than layering ever will (not back to Nos+ and i think old ely5 might also keep original rates).
---
If you're a neckbeard it will. Everyone else will play the game for fun, not to be as efficient and l33t as possible.
---
How difficult is it to get the black war mounts? And if I get it, do I have to maintain my rank to be able to use it, or can I use it no matter my rank as long as it's obtained?
---
do you have any idea how the newer macro system can do this?
---
They are currently testing exactly when the cutoff to be, as they've said and they've given you a worst case scenario - by phase 2. There's literally a stress test today so they can get more info on layering to help them decide how to tune it. A petition is beyond pointless.
---
No, they didnt. They nerfed classes to try to keep some gold making methods in check, they literally changed how classes approach money making while having an absurdly high pop and skewed class diversity when compared to vanilla. Futhermore, the knowledge gathered by the pserver community made certain items/mats become much more prevalent, the devilsaur situation is a perfect example of that.
---
I share your concerns with abusing layers, but the pserver economies are not a good representation of vanilla.
---
Don't let them move the goalposts like this. They originally said starter zones before they decided to layer the whole world. Stick to your guns and petition for absolutely no layering whatsoever as it should be.
---
Not like Blizzard will listen though. Sharding is here to stay and they have no intention of ever removing it.
---
Classic uses modern macro syntax, you'd have to find something that works on retail.
---
People forget there was some overlap in WoD.  So the Mythic gear you were getting in High Maul was still good for Mythic progression in BRF.  I was literally only getting upgrades from my Garrison for like a month on my DK.  Tanks and pally healers had prio on most of the BRF mythic gear so yeah, it happened.
---
&gt; just go to the Discord channels for guilds and you'll see many guilds just doing stuff like 2h 2 days 
---
On the classicwow discord ? Sweet, didn't know. 2h 2 days a week is perfect for me
---
if people layer farm won't their be competition anyway in the layers as there is competition on realms. So for example person X joins layer 2 to farm and there will be person Y on the same layer already farming. If x changes layer to layer 3 he will see player z farming etc. It just comes down to competition agian.
---
Must not be in NA? The account I mean.
---
Oh wow would you look at that u/BridgemanBridgeman. There's a "Yes" in Classic where there was a "No" for Vanilla. I guess it would be confusing unless a side by side comparison like this were made. Things get out of hand quickly.
---
&gt; Wish we could forget stuff.
---
This is why I wrote my first impressions. I feel this way about a lot of games/movies/tv shows that I've experienced over the years. (Especially Lord of the Rings) At least I have this post to look back on if I keep playing WoW. I barely have old screenshots or any thoughts from my old experiences in other games. 
---
I do have one question though - have you experienced all of WoW? Like is nothing new to you anymore unless they release a new expansion? It's hard for me to comprehend seeing all of this game. 
---
That's good to know! I heard a lot of people talk up Stormwind so I think I might have overhyped it in my brain by envisioning a giant city that's alive with other players.
---
&gt; For Alliance the earliest Dungeon is Wailing Caverns
---
Why in the world would anybody but a lvl 19 twink ever go WC as alliance?
---
I love both play styles. Warr I enjoy more in pve. Mage I enjoy more in solo pvp. Warr I enjoy more in group pvp
---
Honestly, I wouldn't build it into your plans as standard, just an added bonus if you do get it, as it's just so damn rare.
---
How did this guy fight another orc shaman as a Tauren?
---
Something something NO LAYERS something something
---
Meh. It should go to tanks, I think.
---
It's way too fast to be a "meta" mainhand for rogues or fury warriors.
---
And you actually believe that?
---
A lot of people really need to understand that some of us have played 1-60 plenty of times to enjoy every quest/zone and just want to get cap so we can do the other fun stuff this game has to offer.
---
Casuals complaining about elitists are accidentally the most elitist people I've ever met.

Sorry it was suppose to be 1-2 months. That is what suppose to end. Maybe i should have stated the current theory is 1-2 months? Clearly, I didn't make a unqualified claim here.
---
It's been a few weeks since I really looked much there, but I see no reason as to why similar guilds wouldn't still show up, just keep an eye out.
---
Really awesome video as far as the technical explanation and breakdown of everything goes! I'd be interested to know your thoughts on the dead zone however. Even though as you said the dead zone is 5-11 yds for non-tauren players, I've always felt like this was off. It wasn't mentioned until WoD or Legion from blue posts that the range calculation at the time took into consideration the target's hitbox. As noted in those posts from the WoD or Legion beta, the melee range had a condition in it in that it was MAX(playercombatreach+targetcombatreach+4/3, 5) where if the combat reach of both targets were 1.5, the max melee range would be set to 5. If the hitboxes were bigger than 1.5 yds of combat reach, then it would be dynamically adjusted. In that same post, range was also stated to be: playercombatreach+targetcombatreach+rangeofspell.   
---
I can't seem to find the link.. if I do I'll edit.  
---
This was WELL after the dead zone was completely removed from the game. If you look up any information about the dead zone from back then, literally everything said it was 5-8 yds. The tooltip states 8 yds, etc etc. Even in some videos, it's discernibly closer than 11 yds.   
---
A little bit more about what I discovered recently:  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/rF1wxtw](https://imgur.com/a/rF1wxtw) PTR pserver, just inside auto range   
---
[https://imgur.com/a/HFlgzpE](https://imgur.com/a/HFlgzpE) snapshot from vanilla vid at the exact moment he is in range to shoot   
---
[https://imgur.com/a/0NMkxyK](https://imgur.com/a/0NMkxyK) snapshot of him actually looking at the target, still in range, and still closer than in the pserver shot. Marks for estimated ranges based on knowledge from [http://www.watchframebyframe.com/watch/yt/v5bIKjadBfw](http://www.watchframebyframe.com/watch/yt/v5bIKjadBfw) timestamp 1:17-1:19\~   
---
I went through several more locations/clips, and you can see often times the range is much closer than 11 yds. However in the same vid you can also see that the range indicators look/feel like 11 yds. It's differing clips however, so no telling when they were taken or if they were the same patch (for the most part). The vid linked is dated Nov. 2006 on warcraftmovies though.  
---
I say all this, basically, to ask what your thoughts on it are. If the dead zone was really 5-11 yds back then, why was that never pointed out? Why does everything all the way until it was removed reference 5-8 yds? Surely a hunter or warrior would notice that it's literally twice as bad as stated?   
---
Anyways, thanks again for this insightful video and I love how you came up with it. I was trying to figure something out like this myself to verify ranges and how it currently was on the beta. Too bad it only works with party members, could be a very strong addon for pvp kiting!
---
Don't have to be my opinion, because I am not interested in wearing a tinfoil hat - They have openly stated that their hope for Layering is to be ideal system that will allow for smooth launch for enjoyment of all while preserving the community in the long term by it's deactivation sometime during phase 1.
---
&gt; Oh right! Because it’s not like they’ve came straight out and said they don’t have nearly as many GMs hence the loot issues, and they can’t afford to look at loot on a event by event basis.
---
What loot issues? That they cut out the middleman and allowed you to trade items for 2 hours between people involved in the raid?
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2376
---
Yep hunters arent allowed to roll on anything even if the two primary stats are exactly what they need. How dare they roll on anything right?
---
Nah, rogue can't restealth on shaman unless you're playing it wrong.

That’s simply not true. Layering is one of the most widely discussed topics on this sub from the start... with both pro and anti-layering posts reaching the high upvotes. In fact, lately most posts about layering are more negative than positive (with good reason as is shown with the exploits). 
---
With regards to blizzard selectively listening to only the pro-layering people: we aren’t even sure if blizzard officials browse this sub.  There is the official forum and bug report feature in the beta. So please don’t make shit up in an already heated discussion. It’s bad practice...
---
Some people just can't stand the inconvenience of not being able to speedrun solo quests from 1-5. Fuck that, I'd rather have an overpopulated world than this.
---
Oh look another post bitching about layering with no idea how it will actually look. Weewoo look at these streamers with this tiny sample size player base I bet that's what everyone's experience is going to be like.
---
I mean, if you dont believe them why would you start a petition? They'll say they'll do it and there wont be any reason to believe that either.
---
But yes, I believe them to do what they say they'll do, or at least I believe it's more likely that blizzard knows more about what they'll do than random paranoid redditors.
---
Good to know I remembered, I miss stance dancing
---
Edgy
---
Lead-lined underwear. Dont know when you'll be ambushed by a portable DX-D100. Things are silent shooters...
---
ye it's pointless they now it has flaws and they are working on it.  The clips can help them no point to raise panic. It's getting fixed lads
---
Where was the person who invited / unininvited him to cause the server shift?
---
I don't really think this video is a fair criticism of the layering system. Blizz was pretty obviously actively testing layering for specifically starting zones last night. As the evening went on, you could literally feel them changing dynamic spawn rates and #'s of players on shards (as best as I could tell, those huge lag spikes were your character being shifted to a new layer being created or something.) 
---
What impressed me was that despite the fact that they were obviously creating new layers, besides the lag spikes it felt like a very seemless playing experience for me and my friends. it was WAY too crowded the first hour but as the devs cranked up the spawn rates and made a few more layers it started to feel great.
---
Plus this is a very, very specific abuse of the layering. If players are getting layered off of each other in the middle of a fight or while farming a particular mob spawn or something, thats a problem. Intentionally creating and destroying groups to force layer shifts in specific situations is obviously going to show some wonky stuff. I'm not even trying to be a layering apologist - I just really don't think this video shows anything seriously wrong, given the context of the stress test last night.
---
This is a hunter/druid ring is should go to other classes after them.
---
server mergers were done in the past and they worked poorly, we already know those went badly and they're not a good solution, why insist on it? it's disruptive and it didn't work in the past
---
It's for tanks period.
---
Rogues should be very low priority to get a thunderfury period, I know it blows because I’ve always wanted one myself but it’s true.
---
It’s far more useful in even a fury warrior’s hands as they could slap a shield on to emergency tank.
---
Jokes like this end up on a faceb feed with groups supporting it xD
---
But, theoretically, for a limited time period.  If this shit's lasts more than a week or two, it is gonna be hellish.
---
Psst: they won't. Sharding is never going away, Blizzard is just setting themselves up for a perfect excuse to not remove it.
---
Its so far from the actual vanilla experience. Maybe its similar to a pserv on launch but not retail vanilla where no one had any idea what they were doing.
---
I know that weightstones and sharpening stones started to work with feral druid beast forms in 2.4 patch. I assume weapon damage enchants became useful for druids with 3.0.8 patch, when weapon damage begin to convert into feral attack power to druids.
---
If you want to be desired in raids, don't go Druid. A 40 man raid probably only wants like 2 druids. Druids are also less desired in 5 man content.
---
If you can get a guild though, Druid is very fun to play and in no means should be dismissed.
---
Both Priest and Shaman is great healers on Horde.
---
Both Undead and Troll are strong in PvP for Priest.
---
Orc and Tauren are strong in PvP for Shaman.
---
If you wanna PvP at all, you want Engineering, and that fits with Mining probably.
---
If you don't want to PvP, I suggest Tailoring/Enchanting as Priest. Shaman can go whatever you want, maybe Herb/Alch?
---
Ask yourself if you want to be a more complex healer that is the "go to healer" in dungeons. Then go Priest.
---
Or if you want to just be constantly putting down totems and spamming chain heals, chilling in raids. Then go Shaman.
---
I personally prefer playing a Shaman due to the 2 other specs and the way they play in PvP, but I know many don't like putting down totems constantly.
---
# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
Right now, our core raid spots are covered, and we're seeking to expand our numbers - as well as potentially build a second raid to strengthen our progression. In particular, we're looking for **Holy Priests and Resto Shamans**, though other applications may be considered depending on their quality. Recruit prios may change from week to week so stay tuned!
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to apply on our site:  [https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/](https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/)
---
I have to admit that I'm surprised the devs had to dwindle all the realms into 4. (last I checked) I figured there would be an absolutely massive amount of players since this is now available for subbed players to try. But good to know there will be more when it launches. 
---
Does Classic WoW feel like it did when you first played? Like does it feel like you're reliving the glory days again? I've played other MMOs, but none of them have done this. (except RuneScape, but I barely that game)
---
Imagine being so pro at the game you calculate casting pushbacks in your head.
---
Imagine thinking of an original way to say things instead of using this shitty "imagine..." template, too.
---
hoes mad, dabbin' on ya pall
---
Im not saying its hard, but everything you're saying is still extra attention by the very definition of it.
---
there will probably be other people camping world bosses on layers so it will have competition. Though you can  avoid ganks by layer hopping world bosses will still be camped on different layers.
---
Never realized that was a pretty progressive design style for the time.
---
Or maybe I didn't notice how web site styles have basically gone back to old school with improvements. 
---
Most sites i remember in early 2000 were ugly and just threw up all the info without any regards to screen or navigation.
---
And there never was a forest like this in the later released game.
---
Undead Priest is the only answer here. Priests are THE quintessential healer in Classic and Will of the Forsaken is busted good. Leveling also isn't that bad as Shadow and it's even decent at max if you ever look to switch it up for a bit.
---
You’re actually wrong about the one spec being viable. The lead designer for classes Kevin Jordan was on the Classic Podcast several times and he’s reiterated that the goal was to have every spec viable,  obviously not equal, but viable.
---
Can't wait to see your grand scheme on your new layering transport device. Have fun getting people setup in different layers just so you can prove a point. The rest of us will be progressing and coming back to farm you while you whinge at a peacebloom that you can't get two copies of.  "Uh BuT AsOmGoldE sAiD I coUlD LaYEr and AbUSe tHe SySTeM".
---
U 2 mate. See you on the battlefield!
---
&gt; Even if we assume the lowest numbers possible per layer(3.5k), at just 3 layers we are already looking at 10.5k people.
---
What makes 3.5 the "lowest possible per layer?" Didn't Blizz already say they were aiming for servers to be aprox the same size as they were in 2005? That would be 3.5ish per server, not per layer.
---
Just like BFA, right?  They ignored scads of Beta feedback about how Azurite sucked, the classes felt depleted, and how unfun it was to exist.  
---
That turned out fine, didn't it? /s
---
... AND you're out of combat, which I don't think happens super often.
---
If I were to play alliance rogue, I'd go dwarf - Stoneform wins a lot of 1v1s.
---
What, they absolutly can
---
I don't pretend to know or understand their architecture.
---
Well yeah I agree the petition is pointless. Blizzard knows that nobody wants it, and they know it's wrong, otherwise they would just be honest and tell us that sharding is permanent and it's nonnegotiable.
---
Of course Blizzard knows exactly what they are doing, that doesn't mean it's good.
---
And just like that with the snap of a finger you subject us to 30 more days of layering. Nice innocent miss.
---
And how do you plan on locating layers? You can't be in a group or guild with the person. So you have to ask people to go to the same spot and hope youre on different layers....then you have to hope you stay that way. Layers aren't discrete numbers that you can see chud bud.
---
Sure, most people also won't be level 40 (or 60) within a week or two either though. There is an insane amount of hype surrounding classic and it would be silly to imagine gold farmers won't be out in full force.
---
It won't even be hard for them to make gold; an army of people farming low level materials like Copper/Tin will make a fortune from the number of people leveling engineering.
---
Mobility as a healer is super important. Unless youre a paladin lol, youre just a fucking boulder at that point letting waves crash on you.
---
O O G A
---
As a software engineer I can tell you that you are 100% wrong, in a very pure form of wrong that transcends time and space into every possible dimension of wrongness:  it’s called crunch time before a product releases and we do beta testing during customer hours which is 24/7 for real-time systems. They could easily do this and plenty of devs would be happy to get better QA working weekends, and we even get comped extra PTO days for doing it so don’t perpetuate this nonsense please, it’s insulting.
---
That's what you get when political correctness gets out of hand. People who chant in favor of certain postmodern values are incidentally the ones who will act absolutely illiberal towards different opinions.
---
&gt; There is a big difference between viability, and min/maxing.
---
&gt; You can definitely be viable. But you wont ever be the best or most wanted by a raid/guild.
---
I fully agree with you. And everything on your post :)
---
Just wanted to be sure we were on the same boat
---
You never know. I actually did remember a guy who ninja looted the big chest at the end of the uldaman up until he joined my guild in tbc(4 years later). He didn’t had a good time with my loot council.
---
People who say layering is only going to be in "for a few weeks" don't know Blizzard very well. Layering is a hammer. They're going to enable it every time they see a nail.
---
&gt; Starting a Stress-Test at EU primetime but not letting EU players participate... seems logical!
---
They already explained why it didn't include EU. The one in July will.
---
Most of us do want it how they say they'll implement it. What we dont want and what you are complaining about is not the plan anyway.
---
I also have a hard time justifying taking riposte before hit rating while leveling. Someone described it to me that you’ll have higher chances at survival in most situations with riposte, effectively reducing your downtime ghost running back. On the other hand, hit rating should reduce fight times, but as you’ve said, so does riposte. I’ve decided to go riposte before hit.
---
No it's not necessary at all.
---
Good, they shouldn’t shut down layering. It’s clearly needed for many positive reasons already explained. And it’s only temporary, but dynamic while being utilized.
---
Not on launch it didn't.
---
That makes more sense. I leveled a druid in classic and cat form did not kill things fast at all.
---
moon2A
---
Release your rage!
---
Thanks although it was probably not the best idea for me to listen to this right before going to bed.
---
That makes sense for them taking no other variables into consideration than their own working hours, but it is not great for actually having a stress test.
---
They may have looked back at actual Classic playtime, when everyone was still in HS/College/Uni and many had whole days to f around in WoW, but by now most of those people have daytime jobs and don’t really take days off for a stress test.
---
It makes more sense for a couple of devs to start the day at 3 PM and work till 11PM, than expecting thousands of people with jobs to clear their schedule for their stress test.
---
I’m 100% sure quivers were visible in vanilla, at least for yourself
---
Why? That's a silly solution. As long as the virtual servers are part of the same "server", this is a nonissue.
---
The actual “stress test” was only two hours long. The extended access beyond that is just to build the hype
---
I’ve never seen this before. Thanks for sharing! Been playing since 04 but I didn’t really follow the game until it launched.
---
I acknowledged that the merges will be painful:
---
&gt;Same as it was in Vanilla and TBC, just with a painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline. 
---
I see it as as choice between being being punched in the gut and having a miserable two minutes in an otherwise healthy life vs. life with a chronic illness.
---
&gt; I personally don't know which is the better option, it'll be easier to judge once launch actually hits and we can see how much attention it gets. Clusters just seem to be overkill imo for what will likely only be a week long issue. 
---
I'd love to be wrong and, if we can't convince them not to use this awful system, for it to turn out this way. At this point it is, as you say, unknowable. All I know is that I've played with sharding in retail, layering in SWTOR and ESO, and it is fucked. Just absolutely fucked that it's being planned for use in Classic.
---
Layering is not going away. They have clearly shown they don't want to triple (or more) the amount of servers and merge them, so there are not many other options left. People think that after level 20 it will "no longer be needed", but if Blizzard actually plans to raise the server pop to 3+ times of a normal server this will still be necessary.
---
Either they go the "no layering and merging route", or they have full layering for the start and fix the issues by e.g. only allowing to layer hop in cities, and especially not by relogging.
---
I was mostly horde during tbc/wrath but going back to alliance which is what I mostly played in vanilla
---
Troll.
---
Someone else mentioned I can play some dungeon/raid in Westfall after I'm done North of Stormwind. I need to do some research. They also mentioned that you can sometimes get shoulder pads from those, so I need to figure out the best one to go to. LOL. But thanks for the tip about finding them as drops from higher level monsters. 
---
I learned that I should take up a profession that allows me to create bags so that I have more room for items and can craft them for people. This seems extremely important after playing yesterday. I was constantly running out of space. I read online that you can find people to train your profession in cities. I didn't find that in Stormwind, but maybe I need to research some more. 
---
Do you feel like Classic will have appeal to other people like myself once it's officially available alongside the modern version? I want to play WoW while I wait for Classic, but I'm a little concerned that it might ruin Classic for me, especially because I don't have the nostalgia that most of y'all are experiencing. Although everyone seems to say that friends are community are better in Classic than the normal one. That's what I think I'm missing the most so far.
---
That mount is still 20 levels away.
---
This was definitely a stress test. I was stressed the fuck out trying to get leveled out of the starting zones.
---
Merge 'em. Boom, that was simple.
---
Im saying that they had to guess on half the stuff in the game. Like how resistance scales, attack power, all mobs on pservers throw spells off cooldowns and so on
---
I'm amazed no one responded with the image of high tension towers jump roping with power lines.
---
You can \*literally\* hear that gif.
---
Seriously, all you people bitching. How do you plan on keeping track of layers. I will you coordinate layer switches? You are in the same layer as you guild and groups. How will you coordinate having multiple people in the same spot to confirm you are in different layers? There's no way to know you are in a separate layer other than standing in the same spot with a other person. And you have no guarantee that you won't be switched out at some point. This is all a bunch of people who literally have never played beyond a boosted character whinging about layering.
---
layering isn't zone wide, so...
---
I'm not sure why they left the first beta servers up with everyones 40 to play while trying to do a stress test. 
---
They should have shut that server off for 2 days and then opened this one to stress it. They basically gave a ton of people reason to simply not log into stress. 
---
Then again I would also say it would be in their interest to turn off the level 40 server completely or limit it a lot more until release.
---
That is the meta PvE combat daggers build.  You have to go Imp SS because the only other option is Imp Gouge which is useless in PvE.  In very rare situations you might still use SS once or twice even in a dagger spec.
---
For any rogue PvE rotation you usually start with a 1 point SnD so that you can maximize its up-time.  After that, it totally depends on the boss you are fighting, the relative fight length, and mechanics, to determine optimal play.
---
Optimal rogue play is all about maintaining maximum up-time on SnD and utilizing energy efficiently.
---
* Item/gold drops in PVP. There's a lack of investment in whether you die or not, and losing something upon PVP death would up the stakes significantly.
---
* A more intricate faction system. I'd love it if you could choose a hometown, and what factions to side with. Perhaps a few sanctuary cities would be necessary, but e.g. require reputation with Orgrimmar to enable their services, setting your HS there, and their guards defending you. Or perhaps you'd live in Gadgetzan or Booty Bay as a neutral trader or thief, and ignore the grander conflict entirely.
---
* Single-player class challenges. Difficult, instanced solo quests or dungeons, tailored after your class, where using your arsenal of abilities is necessary to complete - ultimately yielding cool rewards. I heard they added something like this on retail though but haven't tried.
---
* Also, another ranged class. Crossbows, Bows and Guns are all pretty insignificant to everyone but Hunters, and a more agile, stealthy, WC3-ranger-like class that uses maybe Leather and Bows, would be neat. Bowmaking/Fletching as a profession as icing on the cake.
---
Could go on forever, but many of these fantasies create ripples that completely mess up the meta, and eventually it wouldn't resemble WOW anymore.
---
Jesus christ dude you can’t be serious. One of the very reasons people wanted classic was to experience wow again without sharding/layering/CRZ. How can you support this technology in classic?
---
This is exactly why they should have done the test at prime time instead of middle of a workday. To get a more realistic number. :P
---
So making money off youtube videos is not respectable? Why?
---
It's really not as simple as that. The reason layering is there is to have a stable server with (hopefully) no queue. If you stop layering beyond the starting zone, the servers will quickly become unstable as soon as everyone gets to westfall, which means everyone from all the layers converging into one, causing the server to become really unstable and potentially crash.
---
Let our Pally Powers Combine!
---
Rogues can't restealth against classes that can keep them in combat, which shamans can with totems. They can only vanish once or twice to reset which isn't enough to beat a shaman
---
20 is a great one, but for me nothing 1-59 is going to top the excitement of a 31-point talent and a mount at 40 (gold permitting).
---
Hi - I've been doing a lot of planning for this as a Drawf. On the stress test I ran my level one over to the starting zone. The rep amounts listed from classicdb are very inflated. The most I received from a quest last night was 100.    
---
JUST FYI
---
Good point good point - but, an edge case that would happen way less often than the abuse would happen as it stands, and only until phase 2!
---
And what exactly is the point of this addon? The normal UI also tells you about your casts
---
That’s exactly what they did.
---
Even at 5pm, before they started closing the other servers, test realm 3 was literally impossible to tag mobs on. As far as I could tell, after they forced everyone onto 3 and 13, they started adding layers until it felt playable.
---
It was pretty cool, at 5pm there were literally hundreds in the starting zones and it was IMPOSSIBLE to get a tag, but it improved a lot as the night went on.
---
/r I just need to finish that Frostbolt/shadowbolt/heal
---
Yes but a disappointing amount of people on this sub seem to think a stress test is supposed to be a sample of what launch will be.
---
Launch is the most important day for getting players who aren't invested interested.
---
I did, it becomes fine after a week.
---
Also many private servers has like at least ~12k concurrent players at all times during launch which is way more than classic servers will have.
---
Maybe it was cause I was ahead of the pack that I didn't notice much crowding, but even when I went back to lower lvl zones it didn't seem that bad.
---
I can definitely understand that. There are some good suggestions in this thread already, follow them, but mainly just have fun. Hope you will have a blast!
---
Layering should just be enabled for 1 week imo, just to filter the first wave of rush levelers.
---
You have no idea how the wow economy works. You won't be missed.
---
Your a dumbass lmao. Stop trying to justify this. It’s a broken game mechanics and needs to be fixed or removed. Yes I’d be fucking pissed If the player I was about to kill just vanishes.
---
Looking for a pvp heavy class for BGs while still having a place in dungeons and raids
---
This was my experience as well for the most part. Few hours in, there were a ton of people around all the time, and there was still stuff to kill.
---
wtb grounding and earth shock wtf haha
---
Most private servers are a shitshow day 1 but that's all. As the first wave of players breaks level 10 and people spread out it becomes fine.
---
Isnt Nelf good for rogue for the extra vanish in the form of shadowmeld?
---
Dude once they have assured that it is running as close to the original as possible, they need one maybe two good admins to manage issues and that's it.
---
No one is developing, bug testing, updating etc. That is VERY likely why they adopted the As Is mentality of Classic. 
---
Most of the work involved is planning, very little actual programming or game design so you can pay a few people a decent yearly wage and it would not even den that monthly income.
---
I think the bars switch when you change stances, too. So you don't need to macro that specific thing -- you can put the charge button in that spot on the battle stance bar, and the battle stance button there in the other stance bars.
---
But in general, yes, i think it's like: /cast \[stance:1\] Charge; Battle Stance
---
Keep in mind, respeccing gets very expensive.
---
Healers wish they were DPS not just for raids, but so they can farm gold and solo PvP like everyone else during downtime.
---
Wish I could go horde in classic since I've been horde since cata - I just can't bring myself to level a horde character in classic. Now I absolutely despise gnomes and won't make one - but I still prefer the same old zones that alliance has to offer.
---
Unlike alliance I like all races on horde but ironforge is too engrained as my home base.
---
Good luck deciding.
---
If my wife is in "segment 2"  and my son ins in "Segment 3" how do I join them on dragon tooth?
---
Hahaha, not sure if troll?
---
You being unhygienic somehow translates into me being butthurt?
---
Reddit at its finest.
---
I haven't gotten in as I cancelled my sub 5 months odd ago sadly. But honestly I don't think I want to ruin the "return" , I want that amazing feeling of booting it up at launch.
---
Everything I have seen so far, warts and all,look like it really will be what I remember.
---
The game has so many issues but the fact everyone's in the same boat and just having *fun* makes it so much better.
---
We won't get level 55 water until phase 2 for example so drinking might take a bit of time lol. But then you just chat shit whilst on a mana break etc. 
---
God I seriously can't wait.
---
Thanks gillatron. It's nice to get an encouraging reply.
---
I already experienced Horde side and Alliance supposedly has better quests, so I don't really have any problems justifying it. It's just the rational choice.
---
Paladins are much stronger solo healers, thats inarguable. They’re also arguably better to have in PvP
---
&gt; Started a Human Paladin in Realm 3. I don’t want to play PVP, but only 2 PVP servers were up and running at the time, so I’m stuck with it. 
---
Cute, that you thought, rolling on a pvp server would make any difference on a stresstest. The starting zones, as well as the lvl 10-20 zones and capital cities are sanctuaries for the respective faction. So until you go to lvl 20+ zone, a pvp server is identical to a pve server for you. Usually you get your first pvp experiences on a pvp server around lvl 30.
---
&gt; I want to go on dungeon raids. Where do I do that? 
---
The first alliance dungeon are the deadmines in westfall, you'll do them at around lvl 17-18. Raids are lvl 60 only.
---
&gt; How the heck to I get cool shoulder pads?
---
Shoulder items start dropping around lvl 18 as well.
---
&gt; Did I pick the right class?
---
Depends on what you want. Paladin is a very versatile class, but in vanilla wow has al ot of stigma attached to them. You can fulfill all three roles, but the class design in vanilla isn't optimal, which means, tanking is very hard unless you dedicate yourself to it and retribution also starts to fall off in damage potential, when you go raiding. If you enjoy healing (which it seems you do very much from your description), paladin is a very good choice for all content, but if you'd rather tank or deal dmg, you have an uphill battle to fight against the class design and the stigma some players associate with that.
---
&gt; Stormwind City... so off I went. But... where IS everybody? 
---
Probably in Westfall, questing there. The capital cities are mainly trade hubs and places to gather groups for dungeons. Neither is particularly important in a stress test. The cities will fill up more after release and when people reach higher levels. It's completely normal, nobody is in Stormwind on a stress test. Also, while each faction has three capital cities, usually one of them is the main city, where everybody is. That's Ironforge for the alliance.
---
&gt; Someone eventually invited me to a guild, and I don’t really understand what they’re for. But my chat box seems far busier now. I just wish I could see where all my guild mates hang out. 
---
Mostly to organize people. The guild chat is a tool to gather groups and just talk with your guildies, you can also see where your guildies are on the guild tab and invite them directly to groups and so on.
---
&gt; I know I only have a day left for the stress test, and that my character will probably be deleted forever, but what should I do next?
---
Westfall, that's the 2nd questing zone for humans. You can also go to Loch Modan, if you want to experience the dwarf/gnome area or Darkshore, if you want to see the night elf area.
---
&gt; Should I play the regular modern version of WoW?
---
As it seems, you really enjoy the social aspect of an MMORPG, I'd advise you to stay away from modern WoW, classic will be much more interesting to you.
---
CRZ is obviously not a thing, not sure why you’d even mention it.  And they will get the Vanilla experience, except for layering at launch. For all the obvious reasons you clearly don’t see.
---
This is fucking insane and needs to be fixed. Anyone arguing in favor of this saying it’s not a problem is missing many brain cells. Like honestly how could anyone think this is ok. Layering needs to be removed by level 20 or else more and more problems will arise when way more people are playing after release. 
---
This needs way more attention.
---
Honestly, I'd rather see the most vile and depraved nonsense put into actual words than have something like monkaScheme or peepoFoil pop up randomly in my chat. (And yes, I had to google for these emote shortcuts...)
---
He can literally just spirit ress or get summoned lol.
---
I love how everyone makes fun of hunters for this but at level 60 they have to compete with warriors for a fucking crossbow because it's bis for both.
---
Welcome to Classic.
---
I can’t remember playing past 40 on a pve server.
---
I enjoy world PvP. But not when I’m trying to grind through levels.
---
Likely the most positive outlook for things IMO towards a TBC and WOTLK server is for keeping people with jobs.
---
There might have been a lot of intern or temp types on the Vanilla team that would be let go when its done. If you let them move on to the next oldschool server, you make players happy and keep some good people employed.
---
I might be missing something there, but this sounds good to me -_-
---
How is it a troll when they've confirmed it in a blue post..
---
Its the least i could do when we are both swimming in a sea of downvotes. Lol
---
I listened to the very same podcast. In my memory he said: 'We aimed to have every spec be viable but we prioritized to have every class have at lease one viable spec. Due to limited development resources,in practice, this meant after a class had one viable spec we had to prioritized other aspect of the game.'
---
Progressive itemization != progressive loot tables.
---
Oh my bad, misread your comment
---
I rolled realm 3 around 6p est, and it was difficult to catch a mob.  The NE starting area had a lot of people for the spawns.  But a few hours later, people were few and mobs were plentiful... essentially zero wait for anything.  It felt a bit empty of players.  I then went over to another realm (13?) and the place was packed w players in the newbie zone, mobs were dying quickly but one could reasonably catch one.  Whatever buttons they were pushing made the experience seem better on the second realm than the first.  Both were flagged as high pop in the server list.
---
This, people that constantly play Classic will have an advantage either way.
---
&gt; world buff exploits
---
Learn what the world exploit means. Using a buff to buff your character and do content is not an explot, even if you don't like it.
---
Good bot.
---
Under 9-11 hours will be what most guide users get. Right now the fastest speed levelers in beta are trying to break 7 hours. One is at 7:34 and the other is at 7:07. They both think they can break. Your pace is ahead of the non-guide using pack, but pretty on par with the guide-using pack, which could potentially slow you even more
---
I hope its a simple version that just adds enemy cast bars without going through 10 tabs of settings
---
Fury Warrior isn't
---
Because raiding was sooooooooooooooooooo booooooooooooooooooooooooooring after TBC, that's my reason at least. 
---
I didn't come back until pretty recently either.
---
They aren’t, but you’d be surprised how many people buy into the “only warriors can tank in classic” myth.
---
This is a hunter ring.
---
They *said* that yes, but how is it going to work out in reality? If you create layers with 3.5k people each on same server, what happens when they go away?
---
If you and your friends rolled on the same server but ended up in different layers, and when phase 1 ends together with layering, will Blizzard separate those layers into distinct servers? What about your friends being yoinked to different server then?
---
Or am I misunderstanding this? Because on Classic beta there are definitely more than 3.5k people playing per server, Layers are not  3.5k divided by 5. But 3.5k multiplied per Layer.
---
I'm only an IT student, but my small mind definitely thinks that the server cost + this layer tech built upon sharding tech costs much more than just keeping it as it was back in the day. 
---
It still comes down to money, but I guess they know how many casuals are going to give classic a try, and with layering they can still give them a sort of decent, less chaotic, and more playable, starting experience. They want as many players as possible to stick around, and the majority of the players will not give a flying fuck about layering.
---
For lots of reasons, all theories of course.
---
1) Many of the big streamers weren't really ever THAT big until Classic beta. Why? Because there's a lot of hype right now and about 99% of the people interested in Classic aren't able to play Classic. What's the next best thing? Watch it! ... I mean, we've seen a lot of Classic naysayers completely flip-flop because they want to cash in on the current popularity. I doubt the viewership will remain that high when people can actually be playing the game.
---
2) Classic isn't really that great of a game to stream, to be honest. One of the reasons Pserver streamers had a following because the game wasn't easily accessible. Another reason it's big right now is because BFA is SO SO BAD. We'll see what the next patch does and then the next expansion (which will release next year).
---
3) No arenas. People are watching now because it's "new" ... but without this "esport" aspect, a lot of that viewership will die out and more competitive streamers will go to more competitive games.
---
4) Classic is such an anomaly. A 15-year-old game ... the more hype it gets, the more hype it gets. It is snowballing because it's such an oddity. People are curious. That will wear off.
---
5) Streamers go where the audience is. You'll see a lot of the biggest streamers move on pretty quickly once audiences start to dip.
---
6) The streamer audience can be broken into two sections: those who are watching for the "personality" (younger audience who will follow the streamer to any game) and those who are watching for Classic content (older audience who likely never watch twitch and couldn't care less about the person streaming). This second half is why we've seen such an uptick in viewers. They are new to twitch, but they won't last. I bet most the streamer haters here have watched streams in the last month since beta started ... or they've watched youtube highlights.
---
7) The inevitable rage-quit. We'll see at least one huge streamer delete all his things and his character in a bout of rage. It always happens lol.
---
Anyways. I guess we'll see. It won't go away completely, but I think it will not sustain itself for long.
---
Stopped reading after your first paragraph not gonna lie. The fact that you are backing up Blizzard here is pretty pathetic. They can't have their support team work past office hours on the day of a stress test? Is that what you are saying? I have to be interpreting your post wrong. For those with careers, you understand that it's not a 9-5 thing. Sometimes (often depending on industry) you have to work past office hours to complete a project. Giving Blizzard the excuse of running stress tests at low pop times only because that is when Blizzard had people in their offices is a statement about their lack luster effort. God I hope this isn't why they picked the stress times.
---
Lol noticed that one too. Turning around, scouting the floor for that herb that shows on my map. For some stupid reason I looked to the sky and there it was, floating in the air :p
---
Good to hear your perspective. And good thinking to wait until launch. 
---
&gt;We won't get level 55 water until phase 2 for example so drinking might take a bit of time lol. But then you just chat shit whilst on a mana break etc. 
---
This reminds me. I keep picking up all these random consumable healing items, but they're all unique and take up my precious inventory space. Is it pointless to have them since I can heal myself? /facepalm.
---
no
---
The first 6 levels are like an hour. The next 4 can be around 1 hour. I am not remember much after that clearly, but the leveling speed doesn't get rough until close to 30. At 30 the time to level skyrockets and I think around 40 it got even worse.
---
I'm genuinely confused about what you don't get.
---
There is no sharding at all.
---
Yeah, posted from mobile and my phone likes to correct it to your when I forget the apostrophe
---
So a warrior?
---
It will never go to a rogue, if a guild runs 3 prot warriors and 7 fury warriors, they actually have 10 tanks.
---
The worst part is, it makes perfect sense for Hunters to compete for +Int items. This ring is actually better for a Hunter than a caster, since it has +Agi.
---
Some changes in retail are definitely upgrades - specifically changing Hunters from mana-users to whatever it is they have now (Focus?). Hunters having mana never made sense, and their biggest source of DPS doesn't cost even cost mana. Vanilla hunters are a very strangely designed class and should have Energy instead IMO.
---
Azerite is an iteration of a gameplay and gearing system. 
---
Layering is a temporary balancing solution for server populations. Completely different.
---
yesssssss
---
They had way too many servers.
---
Also keep in mind a lot of people just don't want to waste time on Classic, and non permanent characters are a waste of time.
---
This is a straight hunter/shaman ring.  If you can't use agility, then you are the one that shouldn't roll.
---
I believe deep wounds is low priority so it won't knock off more important debuffs. I could be wrong tho.

Wouldnt call that exciting, but each to their own.
---
Servers crashed. Too much death.
---
The only thing they’ve specified is that it won’t be active come p2, which definitely doesn’t exclude the post 30 scenario that OP was detailing.
---
Well yea obviously
---
Yeah, honestly mobility is the strongest way to survive as a healer. Of course you can just make a healer OP by making them too tanky, but if we assume balanced classes mobility is just the superior defense because it restrict the enemy's control. That is why druids have such a long history of being strong in arena in most expansions - you can't lock them down to focus them, but the alternative is letting them freecast. Coupled with a lot of instant cast (which is part of the nature of mobility) it is almost made for PvP. A tanky healer might be hard to take down, but at least you can decide how to go about it and lock him down if you want to.
---
Now in vanilla this is not exactly how it is of course, paladins are simply stronger healers than druids in terms of output, mana and the fact that they have cleanse, but the fact that druids still have several roles they do better despite all of that proves how strong mobility is.
---
This game still looks so good. IT's just insane how the Art just holds up
---
difference with layering, 4 black lotus every 2 hours per server or 4 black lotus every 2 hourse per layer, this will make it so everyone can get a flask for raid, and that will truely ruin the raid more then any amount of gold,thorium or dreamfoil.
---
They are trying to implement that idea from the get-go, rather than have to try to shoe-horn it later. The entire idea behind layering is that it will let you pick your name, play with your guild, etc., on the "high pop" realms without insane queue times and without forcing a bunch of name changes and broken economies when they start merging servers.
---
No veterans are tired of people who've never played beyond a boosted character complaining about layers. You have no good way to identify and manage layers like you all complain about. This streamer can do it because his entire twitch chat followed him to the arena and was able to see when they were not in the same layer. How are YOU going to manage that. The only way to identify a layer is for two people not in a group or guild to be at the exact same spot and not see each other. How are YOU going to coordinate that and manage that?  What makes you think that there is some empty layer with a fresh devilsaur waiting for you somewhere. Layers only exist when there are too many people. They are dynamic. So if there is more than one layer.....it means there's a fuck ton of people on both....except on beta because there aren't enough people so they have to test layers regardless.
---
What's the DS patch?
---
I've played warrior since vanilla and have been into heavy theorycrafting ever since TBC.
---
If you look up some guides and practice, you can become a better tank than 90% of people in two weeks, assuming you learn kind of slow. 
---
As a human being your capacity to learning even if you are incredibly stupid, so far outperforms anything you could ever need to do in classic World of Warcraft that it isn't even funny.
---
I am finding choosing a race is more difficult in classic. I am leaning towards human rogue for the PvE DPS advantage but it will hurt to lose either stoneform or escape artist in PvP.
---
Except there is no problem here “way after releasing”. They’ve already explained its temporary during the very early stages.
---
Because having layering and sharding in classic is as stupid as if they'd have used CRZ. These technologies ruins so many social aspects of the game, and I can't comprehend why anyone would defend the use of these.
---
Why do you suck up to Blizzard so much? If we dont complain loud enough layering will stay in the shit state that it is in right now and outright ruin classic.
---

Maybe you need to look it up?  There's a reason blizz disabled them in TBC.
---
Using 1 isn't an exploit.  Using them all is.
---
Yes but they've also said that's the worst case scenario. Clearly they are tuning it right now - there's even a stress test about it. They've also alluded to the possibility of only having it on in zones but havent confirmed - it wont be needed if for example they end up only having layering for the first say 2 days only.
---
You're 100% gonna be able to raid as a shadowpriest if you're OK with casual guilds who will take all the meme specs.
---
On the AH or vendor?
---
The one specifically about Paladin and Druid
---
Yeah, the start would have been 11 PM for the vast majority of Europe. It would have been 10 PM for the UK and midnight for eastern Europe. The stress test period would have run until midnight to 2 AM depending on time zone.
---
Engineering is a must have for literally anyone that want to play the game optimally. So realistically you have 1 more proffesion to choose. I'd recommend mining or herbing so can run around the world pvping and grabbing some materials on the way.
---
Low IQ?
---
Do you have an active NA or oceanic sub?
---
Its not bad for hunters and he propebly didnt had a ring yet.
---
Even when its a bigger upgrade for other classes its still an upgrade for the hunter.
---
Find a mage to give you a bunch of water (it's actually quite expensive to have to buy it all if you are healing dungeons) then just vendor the random biscuits n stuff you pick up.
---
Bagspace is pretty limited early so for sure check vendor prices and delete those random items worth 1c

Well, not the crossfitter part. More like that fat vegan girl you know who mostly eats chips because well, *technically* they're vegan.

So you#re not interested in classic, but you spent time making a meme about you not being interested and going on a classic subreddit and letting us know?
---
Okay
---
It is the vanCleft fight that might be a problem depending on group composition you only have mana for 6 or so heals if you don't have any int gear and maby one more from regen. Whit the 2 adds the fight might be somewhat long and trubbelsome but I might be wrong
---
Yawn at the IQ jabs.
---
&gt; These layers can be traversed through in various ways, therefore there's more net resources on the total server.
---
While there are more resources there are equally more people. That does not result in more net resources. Do the Math. There are more 'gross' resources not 'net' resources. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(economics)
---
A server with 5k pop with 3k max layers will have more net resources than say a server with 3k max pop. But that is because that server has an 2.5:1 ratio of population to nodes (see Maths). However, you cannot ARGUE this isn't blizzlike, as many vanilla servers did have 2.5k and lower snapshot populations. This wasn't even part of the discussion originally and i take no issue with this. 
---
We can look at this in more depth. Every node someone loots on more than one layer is a node that another person cannot loot. There is a fixed amount resources (gross) and its times 3 with three layers. (If almost no one is collecting them, then you could run into saving on travel time looting say one node on three layers by layer hopping and then come up with more net resources as your net resources would be limited not by their respawn timers but if anyone was collecting them at all. But having no competition for nodes isn't going to happen, save a minor amount for like a day or two; and the gains are entire based on saving on travel time as you need to be one of the only people looting those nodes on any layer. Which we all know will not last long.) 
---
Thanks Dunning say hi to Kruger for me.
---
so whens the next private fresh?
---
Vanilla devs have confirmed that’s WB are not an exploit and were intended to stack.
---
I mean that's probably me anyways. I play 2-3 hours a night anyways, so maybe that will actually work?
---
Lmfao. I watched him level in the 20’s and it wasn’t that bad, has he really gone downhill? 
---
Ps I’m psyched he’s playing because his stream is one of the only ones I can actually tolerate. Could you imagine actually enjoying watching Asmon? My god
---
The only difference is who is collecting them.  There's still roughly the same number per server.  A Layer would otherwise be a server.  It's the same # of bl per server/layer.
---
It doesn't really change much for tanking if this trend of weapon range difference would continue to level 60.
---
That is definitely it. I chose to take the opposite approach. Since I did the go go go must get everything now mentality in Vanilla, I would rather take this second chance to try to experiment.
---
"Moronic". How can you say something like that and spout so much crap afterwards.
---
Layering is not only for questing. It has nothing to do with fucking groups.
---
Blizzard wants to create servers with a pop of e.g. 15k people, separated on 5 3k layers like classical servers. This avoids server merges later on because the tourist players will quit the game, and blizzard hopes that this will have servers end at e.g. 3k-5k players.
---
If you have 15k people on a server and only layer the first 20 levels, how is everything else going to work? People complain that layering allows to farm nodes multiple times, but without it you have the nodes that are intended for 3k people, but 15k people try to get them. Congratulations, you just reduced materials by 80% for the average player.
---
Level based layering makes NO SENSE. Either it's fully there until the population drops down/phase 1 is over, or there's no layering at all and servers get merged. But there's no other solution.
---
They are testing and tweaking it while in beta. You don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes. You don’t have their numbers and metrics. You’re seriously just foaming at the mouth.
---
your version of the mob tagging 'issue' is exaggerated, and you're presenting a false dichotomy of waiting for the mobs or not playing.

I don't think you know what you are talking about. There will always be more instances when layering tech is used. Sure you can merge different layers, but the total # of layers will still be much higher than the actual # of servers, not even speaking about the development cost of the layering tech built on their sharding system.
---
I was there, they were that bad without mangle.
---
There is a reason I didn't want to roll one again. I'd rather be able to actually kill shit and have a revive.
---
EU
---
I’m gonna be using it in raids, so its main use is for me is freeing up screen real estate to see other more important things. So once your UI is filled up with the 40-man raid unitframes, this addon will allow you to put the castbar where you want/where it’s needed, resize the bar, make the text bigger and more readable if need be, etc. It just allows for more visual customization to your UI. If you look at old world first videos from Vanilla, guilds used this addon pretty frequently.
---
You'd be more pissed if you couldn't even log in.

Why do people like you find that difficult to grasp? Do you have a better idea?

---
This made me feel all warm inside.. Until the end :c /cry
---
World bosses come out when?  Layering is getting dropped when?
---
I think I read somewhere that at launch on some pirate servers they had 1.1 pet mechanics with 1.12 hunter mechanics, which was the most powerful version of each, so hunters were just absurd.
---
So my prediction will be that hunter damage is about right, but pirate server pet damage is frequently too high.
---
LOL well at least I'm not screwed with this realm. Thanks! 
---
Oof... max level cap is 15, I believe. Probably not worth it to play dungeon while on the stress test, though, right? (Also, I'm guessing raids are higher level dungeons?) 
---
Thanks for the tip on paladin class. I do like healing, but its kind of chaotic at times. I'll try a new character in normal WoW and see if I like a different class. 
---
I'm supposed to head up North for this dwarf quest in Loch Nodan, and then apparently had back toward Westfall (according to other posts on here) so I'll do that. I did briefly enter Westfall, but nobody was there so I went to Stormwind to turn in my quest. I probably need to explore some more. 
---
Several folks have suggested playing modern WoW while I wait for Classic to officially launch. Everyone says the community is better in Classic (which I think is probably best for me) but I really want to keep playing. And someone else mentioned I could just start a new character/class in modern WoW. Do you think that may ruin Classic at all?
---
You're almost as out of touch with this sub's opinion as the guy yesterday who made a new layering topic covering the dumb points because he CTRL + F'd the first page and didn't see anything.
---
Yeah it was better, phasing ruins the game.   
---
It sucks that you have to queue for 6 hour sometimes but it’s a tiny price to pay to not have things phase in and out of your world.
---
Ok thanks. if you find another another player, the easiest way to test melee leeway is to have one play auto running into a solid object so they aren’t going anywhere, and then have the other player behind them strafing back and forth to test the melee and min shoot range
---
J bob is actually my brother IRL, his name is Justin Robert and it was my moms nickname for him and he hated it so of course myself being the classic older brother started calling him it to piss him off, now we work for the same place and if I go out and ask for "Justin" in the shop everyone looks at me like I am stupid until I say "J bob?"
---
So how do people take minimal upgrades when they’re hoarding their points for big boy weapons or trinkets? 
---
I’m wear shit blue shoulders and even though I’ve farmed UBRS a million times, I’ve never gotten truestrike. Giant stalkers drops and I want it, but I have to hold off until the bow. And all the other hunters feel the same way. It’s not like we’re getting kicked for not having gear. 
---
Instead of taking the upgrade I’m forced to hoard my points for the absolute most beneficial piece. This is an absolutely nightmare for any raid leader that wants the unit to improve collectively and gradually. 
---
To say bidding is “retarded” is ignorant. Just because your system worked (apparently flawlessly) doesn’t mean it’s perfect. There are different benefits to different systems
---
I really think the "Looking For Group" system was the best during that one patch(?) briefly when you could look people up and also post yourself with a note but didn't really have much autofill.
---
Just like montana. And just as many cow-boys.
---
You can easily pug MC and reserve the bindings. Some streamer rogues are planning on doing this.
---
You genuinely don't understand what he was saying?
---
A tiny price of 6 hour queue time. I guess you're not employed.
---
The difference he is commenting on though, is how every time you mention NOT doing meta you are bombarded with people telling you that no one will want to play with you, you will fail, and that you will change your mind instantly.
---
MOST game communities don't do that unless they are 100% PVP oriented. Even then not always. 
---
It is the forcing it down our throats part that people really question. This dude just wanted to know where it came from.
---
thanks for the downvote but im not wrong, as you can see here there sould only be 1 chest per server, but with layring there are more, same will happen with black lotus.
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentFastSageMoreCowbell](https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentFastSageMoreCowbell)
---
That's how you get a playerbase too small to justify keeping the servers up.
---
Especially since a bunch of the pserver kiddies will just run off to play for free, once they realize it's a ghost town made up of pserver people.
---
I wouldn’t use this addon for that, this is mainly for the player’s castingbar. I’d check out ClassicCastbars for target castbars.

This test is not available for EU.  The search tool is your friend, there are dozens of threads on this topic.

Completely opposite for me.  I started on 15 and it was absolutely packed.  Took me about 20 minutes just to tag one wolf.  I tried out the other server and it was a way better experience.  There were plenty of mobs to tag as well as a nice density of players.   
---
I would have stopped playing and waited for later if both servers were as unbearable as 15.

What a new, refreshing, and insightful take on the topic of layering.  Completely different from the last 10+ pages on this topic. /s
---
Nobody uses weapon chain in vanilla.
---
Yeah i planned all of this it out beforehand... 
---
No, i am just going by what others have stated and it was up some time before phase 2 , not necessarily at phase 2. 
---
Sorry, if i went with the typically projection (which maybe entirely incorrect) of when phase 2 will happen.
---
But we can at least agree that by phase 2 layering will be removed right? So at least that part was accurate.

I reported this as a bug on day one. Good to see they fixed it...

I wouldn't use Beta as the standard for population distribution. My understanding is that they are aiming for 3.5 per server once layering goes away. In that case, they wouldn't create 3.5k layers in the first place.

Stancedancing to Overpower when beneficial and back again. Bloodrage, Bloodthirst, Whirlwind, Slam with your swing timer if you're 2H, deciding between Cleave / Heroic strike depending on your rage and target situation. They are also off the GCD so you'll have to press two buttons at a time in certain circumstances.
---
In terms of how many bottons you use in the rotation, having a proc to react to, and having two skills of the GCD to use, I'm pretty sure they have far more to do than any other PvE rotation in vanilla.

on the upside, Perception basically insta-wins you rogue vs rogue duels and is handy against druids too.
---
I think you should take a look into shaman, warlock and druid. They all have a raidspot (especially shamans), and not too much loot competition. They all have a different role to play in PvP though so you have to decide what you want to do.

no not to 'corpse camp' but to be a persistent threat.
---
if bob the shaman is farming the trolls in STV you shouldnt just be able to layer away from him.
---
simplest solution? probably limit layering to starting zones only - that would solve ALL downsides of layering in one move
---
You are wrong.   
---
There should be 1 chest per layer, not server.
---
15000 ppl get split into 5 layers on one server, rather than on 5 servers.  5 servers 5 chests.  5 layers 5 chests.
---
World buffs are deffo stupid and I don't like them, but it is NOT an exploit to stack them just because they changed their mind later.
---
It could be possible that the private servers only had level 60 data to work with and guessed the rest. This could mean that there is no difference at level 60 but at this point this is pure sepculation.
---
Actually useful information.  Thanks!
---
Also can indicate the delay due to latency so you can start your next cast at the right time.
---
The system is awesome. I talked to the guild leader and creator of the system a few weeks ago and he gave me a bunch of info and tools to set it up. I’ve tailored it to our preferences and phases. We’re going to be trying it in classic and as a raid/guild leader I’m super stoked to not have to ever deal with loot drama again
---
Some of the food will give you buffs to your stats. When I play paladin, I only really keep food that provides buffs, and get rid of the ones that just heal. Drinks are important though. Drinks recharge your mana, so it's nice to be able to heal yourself with your spells and then drink to get your mana back.
---
pity it doesn't work on iPhone
---
No one likes layering, but we like queue's, overpopulated starting area's and dead realm less.
---
Not at all
---
&gt; until everyone has weapon chains
---
No one will do that, other enchant are way better than having an anti disarm for the one combat rogue you fight every month
---
Why not try it yourself on an instant 60 server?
---
Please leave us alone
---
The neckbeard stress test.  Testing how many neckbeards one server can fit during the middle of a work day.
---
I think they forgot that they didn't add Europeans, and forgot to adjust the time-table accordingly.
---
September 2001, the month the wow website launched. Did much else happen back then?
---
It's up now :D
---
ikr? id take this layering till phase 2 (even tho they realistically will end it much sooner)
---
than not be able to play for a week or 2
---
Definitely. Gonna lvl as (full) feral, do some 5man dungeons tanking and then later switch to HotW feral/NS hybrid for PvP, raidhealing, dungeontanking, solo play, etc. Only thing I won't be doing much is dps (I plan on focussing on healing and tanking talents in the hybrid spec so I can do both quite well without respeccing).
---
But ignoring Beta testers is eternal.   You can compare apples and oranges if you point out they are both rotten.
---
If only they weren't fishing for 15 bucks from those of us waiting until release to resub.
---
Really well written. 
---
Your voice is fine, btw.
---
Was the armor the same in dire bear forms at 40?
---
It is an exploit.  Unintended use of game mechanics.
---
Well yeah but I thought we were talking about what /u/blacklion594 was talking about with the 2/4 day numbers, even though realistically it'll be like 4/7 days
---
Or how about you do it the old fashioned way and group or or compete?
---
If you want dynamic respawns, go to retail.
---
There should be NO SHARDING PERIOD.
---
It didn't exist during Vanilla, it shouldn't exist on Classic. Period.
---
MC is [Molten Core](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Molten_Core), the entry level raid of WoW.
---
It is recommended to be level 60 for it, and you will require 39 allies to help you out (it's a 40man raid).
---
It is below Blackrock Mountain, and has lots of elemental enemies for you to fight (fire and earth primarily).
---
Once classic releases you can look forward to going here after you have been level 60 for a while (how long will vary depending on a number of factors), and geared your character up enough in normal lvl60 dungeons! But the journey to 60 is a long one, so be prepared for it to take quite a while... Most average players who aren't rushing to max level could expect to take 1-2months at least to reach 60, with many fun adventures to be had across the two continents in all sorts of varied zones and lower level dungeons.
---
no they didn't.
---
how? i easily got to level 8 in only a couple hours... dynamic respawns are a joke
---
&gt;  Seriously let me know your step by step guide on how you can abuse layers.
---
There are two right there in the OP.
---
Not 100% sure but I think Alpha was around then?
---
You don’t have to sit at your computer the whole 6 hours, you also don’t have to play the days the server are obviously overloaded... I guess YOU have nothing else to do.
---
Dude your memory is really flawed if you think shamans are one shotting people with lightning spells &gt;&lt; theyre alright, but not even close to god tier status before AQ spellpower
---
Don't worry. I've already been accepted into a raid as a warlock. I wouldn't join a shit tier guild that doesn't let the community have fun anyway.
---
I got 2 weeks off work. Dont want to wait 1 week in queues and the other week on respawns.
---
But it should end as soon as possible.
---
"Possible: enough tourists quit or playerbase is spread out enough"
---
Dynamic respawn, was in vanilla wow, it has been confirmed by prior wow developers. Not the same way it is in retail but it was there.
---
That's not hard it's tedious. There's a difference between difficulty and what's essentially a line you have to wait in.
---
Seriously not going to read all the comments below this, but about the content ceiling...
---
The community wants servers to play on a single expansion, not progression. I really don't care if min/maxers want to reach the content ceiling as fast as possible, they can be unhappy later on or possibly pay to upgrade their character to a new expansion. If that's not the case, and it's a forced expansion progression, many of us will just reroll to a new classic server or pserver
---
Mine showed only the Beta and Retail as options. I had to make sure my Blizzard Launcher was up to date and was then able to see the WoW Classic option.
---
LOL.  i saw that very peacebloom in that very place.  I reported the bug.  But it did crack us up a bit.
---
You’ll have both by level 25 so I don’t think it matters much which route you take first. It’s just for 5 levels because you get riposte or 5% hit at level 20.
---
It's not the running, or the flying, or the flight paths, or the portals that make the world feel big or small.
---
It's being weak vs strong.  When you are weak, the world looms large.  When you are strong, you squash whatever mob is unlucky enough to dismount you.
---
WAAHHHHHHH MAKE IT STOP WAHHHHHHHHHH MY CHAT EXPERIENCE WAHHHHHHHH
---
well its hakurai so...
---
I would say Dynamic spawns in the 1-5 zones only, but keep the same low gear drops and quest item drops. You still want to force people to group up, that's the golden rule for Classic.
---
This so easy to abuse its sad :(. Scuffed wow here we come.
---
I never said they did.
---
Oh sweet ty
---
Good thing I'm gonna play on a PvE server, don't have to deal with stuff like this at all, no streamers, no ganks, no nothing, just me and the world, of warcraft.
---
Also EU so its even better.
---
Not as far as i remember. I remember having to wait quite a bit for quest respawns, and leaving zones when there were others in the same area.
---
And no, i wasnt playing on p servers, this was on official.
---
Do consider that the game largely involved grinding to begin with. There will be moments when you will run out of quests naturally and will thus have to grind - at those moments, if you are leveling tailoring, might as well grind humanoids. The implication being that the leveling will require your extra attention to begin with, not the tailoring.
---
Yeah I guess that would make sense. It's not looking good for hunters so far with countless bugs and lower damage than what we're used to.
---
i feel ion or whoever said it would be over by phase 2 was talking worst case scenario.
---
Unfortunately when it is actually gone much sooner people here will take credit saying blizzard finally listened and got rid of layering...
---
But can a shaman pull off plays like rogue or mage ? (Never played classic)
---
PREACH. People can hate on the layering tech all they want, but when they blame COST-CUTTING, of all reasons, I can get so riled up. People don't know about the work and money that Blizzard has put into this shit tech, knowing it will be good for the long term health of the population of this game. 
---
They know how many casuals are going to be playing Classic, and they know how many people will get turned away by the game if the starting zones are filled with hundreds of people. Not even speaking about how empty servers will become after the hype dies down. 
---
I would like the haters of this system to come up with a better concept to ensure a healthy launch, to keep as many (new &amp; casual) players hooked as possible, and to ensure that server's populations won't die and have to be merged 6 months in.
---
Dude are you serious
---
This. The issues with BFA are the fundamental systems that the entire expansion is based around (WQs, HoA, etc). I never really encountered any major bugs in BFA.
---
Azerite was a system that had been planned for and BfA was built around it. Once it was in the beta, making changes to it would have delayed the launch considerably. Everything revolved around it. You can’t compare layering to Azerite at all.
---
By not having layers. And i'm a veteran player this is my toon from vanilla-&gt; cata  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/darksorrow/clarise](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/darksorrow/clarise)
---
Same with shamans ”OH THEY TAKE 8 SHAMANS TO RAIDS AND WINDFURY IS TEH BEST, GO SHAMANS THEYRE ALWAYS IN DEMAND” and there we go shamans tied with warriors
---
If they are healing potions, its usually best practice to hold onto a few of the best ones you have even if you are a class that can heal. If you run out of mana and don't have a mana pot, then a health pot might be the difference between surviving a bad pull, or doing a graveyard run.
---
we were running five man groups all night.  Sitting in the same place waiting for mobs to pop.  
---
Dynamic respawns would benefit the game greatly.
---
&gt;Most average players who aren't rushing to max level could expect to take 1-2months at least to reach 60, with many fun adventures to be had across the two continents in all sorts of varied zones and lower level dungeons. 
---
Dang, I can't even imagine playing all the different races and classes. Oh man, there's too much. LOL 
---
Thanks for your help!
---
There should be no layering, PERIOD.
---
Not in the starting zone. Not ever. PERIOD.
---
There was no layering during Vanilla, so it shouldn't exist now. Period.
---
Relieved sigh in pally tank. Oh did you mean the other tanks?
---
Legion was my favorite expansion
---
After phase 2 is an irrelevant metric. Phase 2 could be 6-10 months after launch for all we know. The damage will have already been done.
---
Or just use lunaframes when it gets ported, it has built in casting bars, druid bars, energy bars, mana 5 second rule ticks, energy tick and all the good stuff.
---
I genuinely do.
---
No, they're blizz*like* it's right there in the name. Not accurate but we're trying.
---
I’ve seen DPS lists from most private servers at all stages of the raiding. Yes hybrids can bring other things but even trying to max out their damage they will never pass middle of the pack. All I am saying is set expectations and play to your strengths as a hybrid. 
---
Play your whole tool kit. Don’t just tunnel trying to get top DPS because unless the rest of you team is either built around you doing more damage or they are all really bad you will never be top dog DPS wise.
---
I've noticed it when I've had the sub style on, gets much better when I turn it off.
---
Funny enough there are no melee dps flasks in vanilla.
---
no.
---
They’re not hurting anyone. It’s ok for things to be repeated
---
It won’t happen. They seem pretty firm on their choice of doing this. It won’t be around forever and you really don’t want the alternative of server crashes and lag fest for the first week after launch.
---
Perhaps
---
PvP
---
Maybe some instances depending of your comp
---
Leave us alone
---
Yes i agree with this.  
---
Once we got to the level 5-10ish areas things eased up substantially.  
---
However, the way it is now, you may as well just completely bypass the starter 1-5 zones.  Literally just get a few friends and book it out of there ASAP.
---
Oh look another topic on layering covering the same lame ideas.
---
I really don't care if people claim it as there victory after whining. I just want to play the game.
---
Full phase 1 is indeed worce case scenario.
---
Yeah forcing people to level on a different server than their friend is going to go over REAL well
---
Server slot is a resource that has value? What about your own time? You don’t value that?
---
In retail you can :p
---
No point having a stress test outside of office hours either
---
Want to buy a TL;DR version. THANKS.
---
Is there a way to consume healing items without sitting down? Every item so far wants me to chill and sit on the ground. That's not super helpful when giant hordes of enemies are chasing me. (ranged ones are the worst. I'll get a bunch of distance from them but they still kill me. wah-wah)
---
If you want it you should be asking for it with the rest of us that want it. They say they are listening. Be heard. It’s like not voting. If you don’t vote them you can’t say shit when things don’t go your way.
---
You need assist for that.
---
it has been years since we've had any loot drama on retail.. the last one was...  fireland/dragon soul? where we invited a mage who was halfway done with his leggo staff?
---
thinking about guild drama'ing over thunderfury / leather DPS piece when the content is super trivial make me chuckle.
---
i love that you literally describe layering as your solution
---
Lol a warlock! You’re gonna have a blast!
---
It was not a thing until WOTLK when they introduced the concept of phasing
---
Hold your knockers, it's just for the first 2 weeks to alleviate inevitable server issues. Yes it's not perfect, but at least we get to play the game than sitting in queues.
---
It wasnt unintended. They were intended to be used wherever you want. They just didnt realize how much impact they'll have when they are used.
---
Lol @ all the shamans thinking they would be special snowflakes, when theyre actually the most played class
---
There should be no layering. Period. There wasn't during Vanilla, there doesn't need to be now. Period.
---
They did.
---
its also gonna be gone before honor points too
---
Gonna need a TLDR on this chief
---
&gt; How are YOU going to coordinate that and manage that
---
We have some 70 people currently in our guild, are you serious with the "how are YOU going to manage that" ?
---
So far i the videos I've seen like 1 person and his friend invited in a group, its not like I've seen stacked amounts of people in these videos, they ususally just switch group and logout to trick the system.
---
During the stress test last night I don’t think I was able to report any bugs.
---
So you’d rather stand around waiting for wolves to spawn for hours instead of actually being able to play the game? I agree it isn’t ideal, but it’s one of the better solutions I’ve seen honestly. If it’s temporary, then I think it’s okay.  If they have it go on too long, then it’s a problem.
---
It also depends on how aggressive it is. On the beta right now, westfall feels like a ghost town even though there are 30+ people in the zone. I hope they scale that back some.
---
Also don't get attached to your name, because you're going to compete with 4 other people for it when these mergers happen.  May the odds be in your favor.
---
&gt;Yeah I've said three times why I believe the beta isn't a good standard for this
---
you've said why you don't want to use the beta as a standard for it. you didn't say why it's a bad example.
---
if anything there's gonna be more people on classic and a even bigger rush to lvl up, so you can bet people won't stop to socialize if it doesn't help them lvl up.
---
they'll make friend at 60.
---
I mean, if you mean "Only 2 players, with no outsiders" then just the open world - world pvp, quests, farming/grinding, reputations/professions etc.
---
You cant do high level 5mans with just 2 (not unless you're really well geared, and you cant get that gear without raiding/doing dungeons, so...), same for raids.
---
If you're willing to join a team of other 3 players, you can easily do dungeons, which will give you a lot more stuff to do. But you already said you cant so...
---
As for class combos - for overworld, anything will work. Most traditional will probably be either a tank/healer combo or a 2x hybrids combo. So something like warrior/priest, warrior/druid, 2x druids, hunter/druid etc.
---
It was gonna be like that, but now they're saying it could last for **phase 1 in its entirety**! We're talking weeks at least, probably months.
---
I love how you have like a 70iq.
---
It's up to guild leadership but it would be prone to drama as you're struggling against human nature.  Players who collect world buffs and do more damage in raid will feel like they're contributing more and will resent not being rewarded in kind.  They'll complain to the rest of their clique in the guild and that resentment will fester.  One misallocated hightly contested drop later and the drama erupts.  It's a tale as old as ~~plane of~~ time.
---
I don't actually care about some turbo nerd using layering to farm black lotus. What I care about is people using layers to dodge WPvP. 
---
P.S. using buffs that are available in the game isn't an exploit just because you don't like it.
---
Or people can make their own choices on what addons they want to use
---
Kappa is the same as typing "/s"  you have no idea what it means until you learn what it means. people will just learn what these things mean if they are popular, if they are not popular they will just go under and it doesnt matter.
---
Enlighten me, please.
---
The stress test is not gonna be indicative of live. They are purposely trying to stress the system to the max. So that when live comes they dont reach the max, you wont have as many people come live
---
also you are supposed to group up
---
If people can have a free transfer how is it forcing people to play on different servers? Are you dumb?
---
I've said there's no incentive to make friends on a beta where you wont be leveling with these people on your actual server at launch.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing that this is needed...
---
I never played in Vanilla or before late Warlords (2015). Resubbed for a month to check out the stress test because I've been following it. Rolled a Human Warrior, fortunately after the excess servers had been shut down, so I did not have to restart.
---
I guess the overall feeling I have is that it's a lot more like much older games of the same era that I played lots and lots of hours in back in the day. On the surface you can look at two screenshots of the same area in Classic and modern WoW and maybe have a hard time telling them apart. But a whole lot of little things add up to make it feel like a much more epic experience as you play it. I guess, to put it in the simplest terms, I really felt like a level 1 character at level 1, and even just getting to level 6 as I did I felt like I had gained a lot, with new abilities. Even just getting more armor from random white drops with no stats felt significant.
---
I also didn't really feel like it was all that arduous just to quest and level up. I died once, but with the high passive health regen (apparently a Warrior thing) I didn't really feel much downtime, at least at starting levels. And the leveling speed felt fine. I guess overall getting to 60 is in the 120 to 200 hour range depending how smart you are about it, and I don't see that pace as all that grueling. Compared to other games today it may feel a bit slow (although not compared with something like FFXIV, which is a very contemporary game today). Certainly compared with other stuff of the same (2004) era, the leveling feels quite easy and almost express lane speed; something I believe WoW was widely panned for at its initial release.
---
More to the point, regardless of how long it takes, it feels like you get something new and interesting at almost every level up, or a whole bunch of new things at certain milestones, so it feels like the time is nicely rewarded.
---
It also was nice that randomly grouping up in the open world quickly becomes a thing that everyone does and that has real benefits. People even talked in groups for a change, which was very nice.
---
The biggest surprise for me actually was that, even though there only were two PvE realms up when I started, the player load felt really low compared with what I was expecting for the first open access beta period, particularly after seeing earlier streams with gigantic throngs of people in the earlier stress test. I was on Classic 12 and started in Northshire, and there were people running around all over, and it was tough to get quest mobs. But my impression was that it was "only" dozens of folks, I don't even think as many as 100 when I was on, during evening prime time.
---
I went wandering for a while to Stormwind and rode the tram to Ironforge, and there were less than 10 people I saw in that whole journey anywhere in the cities. There also were only a handful, like less than 10, hanging around Goldshire all the time I was there.
---
I reckon some of this is timing, starting a "stress test" on the evening that traditionally is the low water mark for any online game. But especially with only two servers up I was really surprised that the game world was not totally overrun with people, and I never saw any really gigantic crowds gathered even where people were. There were lots of people in the first zone for sure, but I expected to see a lot more.
---
Maybe tonight and Friday will be more packed, or maybe the towns and cities will start to come alive as people level up a bit. Or maybe this is just an artifact of how they have the layer caps set vs. the earlier test where it seemed much more packed overall.
---
That's worse case scenario. They are currently tuning when and where exactly to stop it because it's beta.
---
I believe she got it on Amazon.
---
Ehh, all polls suggest that hunters wont be played that much. Shamans and paladins will be super popular
---
“That way if your friend has to roll on a different server than you....”
---
Can you read your own post?
---
From someone who has played on multiple Pserver launches with 10k+ people racing through the starting zones, it's actually not THAT bad.
---
outside of starter zones
---
Warrior
---
I love how people think the wow engineers haven't considered their "solution" already
---
No, but they are arguing that it doesn’t need to be fixed and that is just plain wrong.
---
So pick a server not entirely overrun by streamers and their fanboys... Then you will not have to fight anyone for anything. You don't need layering to get around fighting over mobs, you just need a brain.
---
so easy... no one will mind
---
You can’t know that. Nobody can. Not even Blizzard can predict this with certainty and they have much much more data available than we do.
---
And even if you are correct **and** even if Blizzard will just let 20k pop servers happen, then it is almost impossible that this will be the case for every server.
---
I do agree there will be at the very least one server that will just have more than 10k concurrent players when Blizzard is hoping to turn off sharding. Players that want big servers have a big incentive to converge into the same 3-4 servers (across continents).
---
Dude, Blizzard has clearly stated that layering may be in the game for all of phase 1. This is not some short term things. We're talking weeks or months.
---
I disagree, I think it's interesting to see what kind of bugs are out there.
---
Was being facetious for people crying it's the death of the game.
---
Wow, how did stupid Blizzard not think of this?
---
On a different instance of the server..lets say you big guy hardcore classic fan, dropped his wife and job and 2 kids for classic and you get to roll on Hellscream 1, and your friend is a little late to the party and has to roll on Hellscream 4 cause all the others are full, you get ONE free transfer to go to your friends Hellscream 4 and STICK TO IT. NO LAYER HOPPING NONSENSE.
---
Are you sure it wasn't just that after a few hours people had gotten their mobs and moved on, making it easier to get to them as they spawned?
---
&gt;Threat gen could be a lot lower than expect for bears
---
That would be the Vanilla/TBC experience, if we're being honest. Being a Bear Tank was a bit of a challenge then and you were *required* to learn to manage the agro manually using tab-targeting and your agrometer. There wasn't even an agro illustration on the enemy health bars then, iirc.
---
I've been seeing you all over this thread and I agree with most of your points in theory, but I think the fundamental roadblock your argument hits is simply that this community doesn't trust Blizzard. We have burned by them so many times over the past decade that when they say "its just for now guys we promise" we just aren't inclined to believe them.
---
You can count my signature towards that petition.  
---
I think dynamic respawns are the answer.  Not layering.  And i think last night is proof of that.  Having experienced dynamic layering on steroids when N-dale released, i and many others can state with confidence that it works.
---
That is rough.  Thousands of players are going to have this same thing happen to them doing the one thing so fundamental to Classic - *accepting invites for group content.* :(
---
 This, and people furiously layer hopping to get to, or avoid, world PvP, is going to tarnish the Classic experience so badly.
---
I could. But again I think I wont be able to keep it up to lvl with my characters lvl. I found alchemy to be much easier to lvl.
---
Hunter BM spec
---
wpvp my ass...  You mean, kill some random 3v1 while he is farming.
---
It is an exploit. Unintended use of game mechanics.
---
logging out to save buffs to stack.
---
songflower is just a straight exploit,on top of an exploit, because you exploit the server latency to buff an entire raid. This one isn't even remotely arguable.
---
50% more raid dps and 30% more raid health allows you to completely ignore game mecha
---
&gt; If you look at the screenshots, the Classic values are about 75% of the private server values for bear form, and 87% for dire bear form and cat form.
---
Maybe it takes away the insane threat they had in private servers but I tanked 5/10 mans on my druid in retail vanilla. Idc what private server values are, in retail vanilla we could tank then too. Just never raids.
---
It either needs to be this, or just the original fucking sharding in starting zones only (but at higher player cap than retail, obviously).
---
Level 1-3/4 who really gives a toss whether they see 200 or 2000 players?
---
Original sharding at least would not have the potential level 60 rush farming problem, because if the first 10 people to 60 is only enough for one phase, no matter what, they can't abuse swapping, because there is only one shard! This whole "2 servers virtualized on one" is a hamfisted kneejerk reaction to the kneejerk reaction we had over sharding. It's all so stupid...
---
&gt; of course it'll get downvoted into oblivion, this subreddit doesn't tolerate disliking layering
---
&gt; Enlighten me, please.
---
Okay, I'll bite.  The search tool is your friend.  There are 10+ pages on the topic of layering, including several post made today.  I'd wager most of the down votes are because nearly every thread covers the same 3-4 topics and presents the same terrible solutions.
---
You have a beta invite?
---
With 2 people you can level to 60 and do some pvp.  But that’s about it. As for dungeons I doubt you can even 2 man level 50 dungeons.
---
no idea what you're referring to.
---
Nice.
---
Kinky band camp then...
---
...just like in the movie ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
They didn’t say starter zones only. They said for a limited amount of time. Layering is continent wide. There’s no way they could just do starter zones with that technology.
---
i gotchu (edited the main post too)
---
**TL;DR** Game size is beyond comprehension. Wish I could find more players wanting to party it up. Paladin is hard. Stormwind was a dead end for me. Love the quests. The story/lore is really cool. Love the atmosphere of the game overall. 
---
(Even my TL;DR needs a TL;DR) 
---
**8/10. Would stress test again.**
---
How about accepting they cant see into the future and dont really know how many people will stick around making it just as huge a risk to have layering and add 9k+ people on different layers as there are with server mergers that still might have to happen because not enough people left enough servers. 
---
Or you can fix some of the classic quests that are the worst bottlenecks, I mean some of the quests can be done by 1 person per some 5-10minutes, combine that with dropping people of in waves and you wont have the same overpacked zones. 
---
While you cant stack some 9k people (3 whole vanilla servers) and say "well most will just visit then quit" you can for sure give people a more regular classic release that does not have any immersive breaking layering.
---
Ehh, shamans and paladins are one of the most played classes. Priests are nowhere near them. you can check any of the biggest polls
---
I think it's very beneficial for a guild to have one bear tank.  Your warrior tanks have one less person to divide the warrior tank gear
---
He wants you to be stuck on a server rather than being able to hop it
---
I'm pretty sure you didnt even bother to try to interpret my post
---
It would skew the data because EU players wouldn't play on US servers when the game launches, relatively speaking.
---
See you soon ✌🏽
---
It’s usually the horny freshman who don’t know what they’re doing.
---
You literally said “in case the server is full.” If it is full, how exactly do you plan to transfer to it? And how quick do you think a transfer is going to happen when a few hundred thousand other players are trying to do the same thing?
---
Can’t wait for launch week! This is a horrible idea.
---
I played from Vanilla to MoP.  I played MoP for the 1st week it was out, but I was just starting a move to Hawaii and was 1 bar from max lv.  Took me about 3 months before I got internet and my computer back. I logged in and got my updates... and just stared at the screen for about 10 mins before realizing the drive was gone.  Immediately uninstalled and never got back in.  While I'm very tempted to give Classic a try, not I think I would need a solid group of people to play with to be able to stick with it.
---
i won't play at all! 
---
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ 
---
NYEH!
---
"Exploit", yet no bans or fixes have been made.
---
You want to sit in login queues, then when you can login lag the entire time, you want to fight 60 other people all camping one mob for a quest. The first week after launch would be unplayable.
---
Except you know, any melee class that knows what they are doing in PvP...
---
&gt; We have people that make posts admonishing min/maxers in favor of meme specs arguing that no one can tell them how to play, while simultaneously declaring that min/max guilds HAVE to accept them for raiding
---
Oh its you again making this shit up.
---
No one EVERY said top end guilds have to accept their offspecs. Top end guild people keep telling them NO guilds will accept them. Even when they claim to have groups of like minded people, the min/maxers tell them NO their friends won't accept them either and insist they stay out of their min/max guild even those these people will literally tell them flat out "I don't want to be in your guilds". They then continue to follow up with "good luck finding a guild then LOLOLMEMESPECLOL"
---
So yeah, fuck off with that.
---
That's literally the worst solution.  Xxlegolas being reserved across ALL servers?
---
Yeah they're great for 5mans. Marginal for raiding. I tanked 4H and Kel Thuzad adds. Warriors are just better cause of +wep skill.
---
Ret paladin ring imo
---
you think you are a warrior, but you will always be the guy that never heals
---
Maybe they should work when I'm not at work.
---
Pass this message along to banks as well.
---
I don't remember which server I played on but I got on about an hour later than that. Literally everywhere in Durotar was packed except the shipwrecks. It took my group of 4 around 45 minutes just to do the quest to kill Zalazane because there were almost always 3 or 4 other groups also waiting for him. We didn't even try to do the beginning quests in Valley of Trials because it would have taken forever just trying to kill 10 boars with literally 100 other players also trying to kill them so we left and leveled by killing level 5-7 mobs instead.
---
All that said, it was still a lot of fun and pretty much in line with what I expect for launch. Everything ran smoothly, that's the most important thing.
---
Sounds awesome, Ill spec mostly for tanking and maybe a little into dps. But I'm not much of a healer, that's what my brother is for :)
---
&gt; wpvp my ass... You mean, kill some random 3v1 while he is farming.
---
"I don't like this thing so its clearly an exploit."  Grow up.
---
I trust Activision completely... No ruin everything they touch.
---
It's a Policy. Don't blame the people.
---
Congrats on outing yourself and telling everybody how clueless you are at PvP lol. Stoneclaw totem's taunt effect pops Rogues out of stealth.
---
Just stop talking and get good at the game please.
---
who the fuck they gonna ban?  Pirated servers?  lol  What a stupid argument.   World buff stacking wasn't done in vanilla.  It was an overseen exploit. 
---
Hell, even the shit pirated servers blocked them for 1 month....  That should tell you something.
---
Go to TipsOut's YouTube channel, he just had a really good interview with Skarm who talked about feel tanking in vanilla in depth
---
I remember the AQ event. What I remembered is five second stutter lag. It was so bad we couldn't kill the bosses in the zone so we made chains of our raid to kite the bosses in the city in Silithus to get the guards to kill them for us so we could get the loot.
---
It wasn't fun.  It was a mess.
---
Yeah that would be a better solution. But it’s harder to pull off. The whole free transfer thing wouldn’t play out so well. Layering is just simpler and it’s a temporary bandaid.
---
I GOT it now, it means dont roll trashids
---
Hunters are the easiest to gear at 60. No competition
---
Sounds sick! I firmly believe you should play what you want regardless of what others feel :) who knows where classic will go... (I'm hoping for a 2007scape kinda vibe, but we'll see)
---
Ahahaha
---
so you're telling me the freshmen usually shove their flutes up their asses?
---
Its going to be downvoted because its a dumb topic.
---
Layering will be gone in 2 weeks or less.
---
I don't know that people in classic are going to be down for private server looting rules.
---
If you put in the time, you get to roll on drops.
---
"Overtuned" doesn't mean anything here.  
---
You should say private server melee range for druids was larger on private servers than in Classic.
---
That's just layering... With extra steps.
---
What do you what then to do if you are going to play regardless?
---
"Hey Jimmy let's play wow together! I'm gonna make my character on Hellscream 1. You make your character on Hellscream 2. We aren't going to be in the same world so we aren't really going to play together at all. But it's the right thing to do because it will help server stability. But one day we will be able to switch realms and play together."
---
In your brain is this what you are thinking would actually happen?
---
Why do people keep mentioning grouping up?  As if everyone wasn't doing it already?
---
I was playing with three friends and inviting two randoms all night.  we had a five man group for most of the night.  We were still sitting there around an enemy troll campfire waiting for more trolls to pop.
---
A warrior without a weapon chain will lose to a warrior with a weapon chain every time.
---
Weapon skill is negated in pvp, including unarmed.
---
It is purely a pve game mechanic
---
So no, it will not lead to more parries against unarmed players
---
I am definitely going to main a Resto Shaman, however I can't decide on Race. I am stuck between Tauren and Troll. I prefer Tauren for class fantasy and for the Herbalism Racial as I will be going Herb/Alch. That being said, I don't care for Kodos, and prefer Trolls for their mounts and the Berserking Racial. As I understand it, Tauren can't use other mounts in Classic. Are there any other mounts besides Kodos or super rare mounts that Tauren can use? You spend a lot of time mounted in WoW and I would like a cooler mount than a Kodo. Help me!
---
Apparently you played Shaman by bashing your face into the keyboard repeatedly because Rogue vs. Shaman heavily favors Shaman as long as you're not an absolute troglodyte.
---
As someone who has played since the very beginning, do not start with retail.  It will water down every bit of the feeling you have right now while leveling and exploring.  They made the earlier content that you are experiencing right now trivial, and only a short stepping stone to get you to the highest level, and the current content.
---
It's understandable that they made it this way in order to be more accessible to new players, but I promise you it will not feel the same.  Take the longer journey and learn about the world of azeroth organically rather than jumping into a story that has 15 years of backstory for you to catch up on.  Like a movie you can only see for the first time once, you owe it to yourself to watch it instead of seeing a recap at the beginning of the 8th movie in the series.
---
&gt; For me, they’re on thin ice already with the promises they’re extending about layering being a temporary thing. We’ve heard that one before...
---
They've always said layering was a temporary thing?  Ion is a lawyer by profession/education, so I understand that he lies for a living but c'mon.
---
Somehow it feels appropriate...
---
It wouldn't be good for the health in the game. The game is comprised of mostly casual players, and those casual players and retail tourists will abandon the game after the first 5 minutes if it's a private server launch shit show. This may sound good to some of us, but we need those population numbers so Blizzard will find Classic to be a success and put resources into either expanding classic or making TBC.
---
Also, layering solves the problem of keeping servers populated after the drop in population that will inevitably happen after launch. Server merges are not as good of an answer as at least partial layering as you wont be able to interact with those other people on the servers that you will eventually merge with until after the merge, which is much more unhealthy for a server than letting everyone at least have the chance of interacting with everyone before the layer merge.
---
You leave the part where theres NO layer hopping nonsense. Sure it wouldnt be perfect but at least there would be no layer abuse. 
---
Look I know most of you guys are too dumb to understand that layering will kill classic wow in more ways than dead ghost town servers ever will, and I don't expect you to understand.
---
When servers merge and every hunter and their mom has lupos, or brokentooth, when every hardcore pvper is equipped with a tidal charm. When every big hardcore guild has stockpiled years worth of black lotuses, you'll realise how layering was a mistake and at that point it would be too late. There is still time to revert this travesty.
---
You are right, its not griefing but it makes you asshole. I wouldnt go gank lowbies.
---
Thats why having 60 main ganking that asshole is best thing. Its karma back to that moron. 
---
3 people in party killed my lvling toon. I killed all of them and corpsecamped one over and over. He just couldnt continue with his quests.
---
It 100% will. MC is pugable very early on and raid leaders will always reserve the bindings because they have such a low drop chance.
---
I knew private server elitists with their Bear obsession would get a rude awakening once classic goes live.
---
yes but keeping an instance alive for a few players is more resource intensive than not doing so. for example having an instance with 1000 players and one with 100 players is more resource intensive than one single instance with 1200 players.
---
I love how you bring nothing of substance to the table
---
Myself(mage) and a pally friend could handle a number of 5-man dungeons back in vanilla.  However we were decked out in T2+ gear which you wouldn’t have access too without doing 40-man content.
---
You could probably still do reasonably well with pre-raid BiS gear, but that would require you still set aside an hour or two for 5/10 man content.
---
Other than that, your only other good option is PvP.
---
Classic really is tailored towards community and group play.  It’s one of the major reasons there was such a demand for its return.  I don’t want to say, “Just play retail.”  But retail is more catered towards “the busy adult” these days.
---
It's simple really:
---
You can roll on your main spec gear even if it's paladins rolling on cloth dresses or furry warriors rolling on leather.
---
Hunters pass on melee weapons, rogues/warriors pass on ranged weapons if there is someone that needs them.
---
Council determining who benefits the most is good for the guild's progress. 
---
Eventually everyone will get geared but wasting good items on a very small upgrade is not good. 
---
Learn to compromise.
---
I've offered a $50 bet so many times to people who say blizzard are lying. Specificly to those sure layering is never getting turned off.
---
Nobody has taken the bet, and even if you are a bit distrustful it is stil more likely that Blizzard will just do what they've said recently rather than something different.
---
I suspect if those people believed their case it at least one would've taken a bet for the easy money.
---
Do whay they did before sharding and layering. Increase  spawn rates l the first week/based off population in the area
---
Yes I want the servers to fucking explode on launch day, at least you know you're playing a game with other real people
---
They're covered both ways too. If enough people actually do quit, then they can remove it and be the good guys. If layering is removed, players will return to the game. If the population stays high even with layering, what's the point of removing it? "Yeah, everybody hates it and it ruins the game, but they're still playing it, so why take it out? Let's add a cash shop while we're at it!" Either way, they're covered. Plus changing the name was genius. Pull the old Enron move, and change the name with the bad stigma to something new and fresh.
---
Because?
---
Oh trust me they’ll be down.
---
The + damage weapon enchants haven't worked for feral forms on reputable private servers for like 3-4 years now.
---
yeahh personally i dont see a strong arguement for that ya know? layering will be in the game what, max a couple months? if i have friends i want to be able to do deadmines with them or something and if we would be stuck on these seperate servers thats just not going to happen, layering is fine as a very temporary solution imo
---
Flame shock and searing totem means they can only vanish at specific times, but never restealth.
---
Weren't there some quests in TBC that had phasing or no?  I'm pretty sure the Netherwing and Ogrilla quests had phasing.
---
that's a really bad way of thinking towards blizzard.
---
Yes because clearly what we want is... (by the time people get into contested zones things will thin out on their own.)  
---
\- Had a boar disappear on me mid fight as it rushed towards me, and had 2  random players phase in. I assume this is the layering bit but I  reported it nontheless because I assume we don't want mobs dropping mid  fight. - some other redditor

---
If I'm getting it right, the first character you load after logging in sets the "global" layer all characters go to based on it's original layer at creation.
---
So if you first load a char on layer 4, all subesequent characters default to 4 until you close WoW, where a new layer is stickied based off that next character you load.
---
Idk man its called a stress test idk what you expect
---
Lol you’re so out of the loop it’s just funny. No skilled melee will ever use weapon chain because it’s hot garbage.
---
Having double or triple the amount of devilsaur leather, thorium, and black lotus for a few weeks is not going to break the economy, not even close.
---
The legit vanilla launch is not nearly as anticipated as Classic is. There will be many more people on launch this time around.
---
Also, vanilla launch was a huge shit show. They had to award multiple days gametime over and over to accommodate for everything being so shitty. I don't think anyone wants that launch again.
---
Thanks ! Glad you’re enjoying. Partying mainly happens on harder quests and I often have to /s and ask simply “hey wanna group” most the time they shoot an invite. We share human like greetings . If they played well or were funny I’ll compliment them and ask if I can friend them. Usually I get a response like “Hell Yah” or “I already friended ya”
---
Then I make it a point to check my friends list next log on and decide where to quest based on their location. Shoot a message “hey want some company “ if they say yes I hope a gryph and go quest with them.
---
&gt; Oof... max level cap is 15, I believe. Probably not worth it to play dungeon while on the stress test, though, right? 
---
Hm, 15 is pretty low, but if you really want to see it and find a group, give it a shot. It'll likely be very hard though, as most enemies are around lvl 20.
---
&gt; (Also, I'm guessing raids are higher level dungeons?) 
---
More or less. The main difference is the size. Dungeons are made for parties of 5 people. Raids are made for 40 (and later on, we'll get a couple of 20 raids). You can also do dungeons as often as you want, but raids only reset every couple of days or even week.
---
&gt;  I did briefly enter Westfall, but nobody was there
---
There is nothing going on at the border region between elwynn and westfall, you have to go in deeper.
---
&gt; Thanks for the tip on paladin class. I do like healing, but its kind of chaotic at times.
---
One more thing, any class, which can heal in classic wow is primarily a healer, the other specs all carry a stigma of being unviable.
---
&gt; I'll try a new character in normal WoW and see if I like a different class. 
---
Don't know, whether that will help you. The classes are very different in modern wow, even down to the basic mechanics on some of them.
---
&gt;  I could just start a new character/class in modern WoW. Do you think that may ruin Classic at all?
---
One thing, you have to look at, is that modern WoW is a completely different game. You'll barely recognize the classes, the design philosophy is entirely different. Personally, I wouldn't touch modern WoW, but in the end, it's up to you. Probably doesn't hurt to try and probably won't ruin classic for you.
---
It changes nearly nothing for Bears.
---
Not if that's the only similarity between the two.
---
People not being able to call themselves XGetXRektX is the absolute least concern when we have a pile of shit like layering blocking out the way
---
After reaching a certain percentage of spell crit especially with buffs there traditionally is more of an emphasis on spell damage or perhaps this gear list's stat weights take this into account?
---
I am referring to a very niche scenario so I understand if not.
---
&gt; It does not follow in practice that 1 person on a 3k server equals 3 players on 9k server(unless you're looking across the board of servers, but that's hardly what we're doing here). 
---
No, this is exactly what we are doing. when you are talking about 9k people you are talking averages. Not individuals.
---
Otherwise, you would be arguing just one guy might do this, instead of it being a possible issue on every server. And if just one or two guys do this its not really an issue you have to design an entire system around.  
---
&gt;There is an issue, blizzard has not even adressed this yet let alone proposed a solution yet I'm branded as a doomsayer by you for bringing it up. 
---
False. I ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE IN THE OP. You are a doomsayer because instead of recognizing this you went on to retort all the same negative talking points as if i hadn't already addressed them. Granted, after reading you comments i agree with you that its unlikely that they will be balancing layer population (at least poor evidence for it). But that is because i actually READ your comments and processed their contents rationally and without bigotry.
---
&gt; Just like now, the entire forum was an echo chamber where everyone loved the idea on paper, but failed to see the consequences it had in game.
---
See imo sharding was no big deal. Anything that people complained about it hurting was already dead to me by the time it came around.  So i have no lower standard than you when it comes to this.  The only issue being what does it hurt? Honestly, you keep saying stuff but what does it hurt? Please don't say resources because you don't have the argument to support this. 
---
I can say look at my OP. Actually read it just once. It mentions nothing about if Layering is good or bad. Just that that common economically inept argument about resources is WRONG and why (also some hope on how Blizz might avoid all issues related to it). 
---
I personally think the current form of Layering is awful for pvp. Its doesn't help leveling as much as if it did balance the layers populations.  At the same time i never stated that i think its really useful for long term server populations and avoiding queues. None of this was part of the discussion ONLY that economic fallacy. And you replied entirely ignoring the mathematical argument i made. 
---
If you still disagree show me the math. How you generate more than three times the resources with three layers so that somehow you get a, technically, lower ratio (more resources) than 3:1 with 9k server population and three layers.  How do you turn that into 3:1.1 when you only have 1000 nodes per layer?
---
I too have a 144hz monitor, does the 1fps really make a difference? lol
---
I'm pretty sure from their own data and their talks with nostalrius staff they have a good idea of how many will stick around. This isn't their first major release you know... 
---
I agree with you about bottleneck quests but that's just as likely to piss a different bunch of people off for changing vanilla content.
---
Which can potentially fuck the economy, even later on down the road. People can and will abuse layering to farm all kinds of mats and will be trickling them into the auction house for months to come, even after layering stops.
---
&gt; It's going to be for a few weeks.
---
This went from people baselessly claiming that it will last 1 week, to "a few weeks." You have no idea how long it will last.
---
&gt; It's a necessary evil.
---
It really isn't. They should just spin up more servers.
---
Without layering it's either sitting in a queue or running around looking for the only places people aren't so you have something to kill.  It's like, do I want to stare at the login screen or park my character at the Southwestern corner of Durotar where there's no quests and grind the same 3 mobs until level 10.
---
Layering could end up staying for the entirety of phase 1. We have no idea how long phases will be.
---
the issue is that you seem to think layering will be around long enough for any of that to happen
---
&gt;I guess the overall feeling I have is that it's a lot more like much older games of the same era that I played lots and lots of hours in back in the day.  
---
This exactly. I can feel the grind for sure. But it's fun exploring, so it's not so bad. 
---
&gt;I really felt like a level 1 character at level 1, and even just getting to level 6 as I did I felt like I had gained a lot, with new abilities, and even just getting more armor from random white drops with no stats felt significant. 
---
Exact same feeling. 
---
&gt;More to the point, regardless of how long it takes, it feels like you get something new and interesting at almost every level up, or a whole bunch of new things at certain milestones, so it feels like the time is nicely rewarded. 
---
Yes, the time investment, while significant, is rewarded well. 
---
&gt;I never saw any really gigantic crowds gathered even where people were. There were lots of people in the first zone for sure, but I expected to see a lot more. 
---
After the realm purge, the starter zone for me was completely overrun for a long time. But once I ventured out of the starter area, it dwindled substantially as you referred to.
---
It's not like there's anything to do on cap except for 1 week of getting prebis and then raidlog. Ranking or even an aimless ganking are for special types.

 Remind Me! 65 days
---
No you don't.
---
He is of course saying layering matters wherever it is applied. As in layering is a concern from level 1 onwards, in phase 1.
---
This convinces me that you're either not sincere, or you're a troll, alternatively possibly you just want to kill dissent of the subject because you benefit from this somehow.
---
Also what concerns me is someone seriously stating that such huge immersion breaking mechanics don't matter in the most socially interactive intensive leveling phase of the game. It makes me think, because of your zealous conviction and so numerious posts on the subject, that you're again heavily invested in this somehow.
---
Curious.
---
Given the alternative? Absolutely.
---
Same
---
The mobs start hitting harder around level 15.
---
Saw deadmines was called VC and stopped reading.
---
So basically because you'll be playing the bare minimum you don't really care about the quality of the game that everyone is going to experience?
---
Big one being WotF from UD dismantles ally lock pvp.
---
The guy at the end basically does this to him. 1500 shock crit and a 2k LB crit it looks like with a 400 something inbetween.
---
People forget that we had Vanilla &amp; TBC without layering, and WoTLK had only just started using these technologies, and everything was fine. Sure, when the new expac came out the zones were all crazy packed, but it was manageable.  
---
One thing we've always had are queues, and I think that's all we need now. I've played during new expac launches several times and new server launches (12k+ in queue), and my buddies and I had to fight over mobs for a couple of hours - but we still managed to progress.  
---
I'm not completely against layering or phasing technologies that help the first couple days of madness, but we don't "need" it the way everyone seems to be thinking we do. WoW was fine without it for many years.
---
It IS trolling because the renamed it to BETA again when it's just the stress test. It was called Beta &amp; Stress Test previously. Big difference.
---
You can try retail. It's free to play until level 20 and I think that you already subscribed, so you can try it for month. It's not a bad game. It changed a lot from old WoW, so a lot of players don't like it, because they liked another game or just bored from all those years, but there are plenty of people who enjoy playing it, rather than complaining on forums. You should try it and decide for yourself.
---
I'm in a similar boat. I started playing in WotLK almost missing all those hardcore old things (well, actually I started playing in 2.4.3, but I was a total noob at that time never even reaching level cap). I played WoW since then with some interruptions, and honestly the main thing that matters is community.
---
A lot of people don't like Cataclysm. You know what? That was my best time probably in my life, when I was raid leader of our small 10-man guild killing a lot of heroic bosses. That was truly a blast. I did a break and returned in Legion and looked for a guild. Legion might be a good expansion, but I switched 3 guilds so far and it just did not click for me, I did not have that much fun, just because social part was not satisfactory. So the overall game experience was just meh. People are too focused on performance, they are eager for those purple logs, they don't want to progress. Just not my kind of game.
---
Sometimes I think that I should return to be RL. I never considered myself a good RL, I did it because noone else wanted. But after some experience in other guilds I could see that I was good RL. Though a lot of time passed, I changed, so probably won't happen.
---
Yeah dude I know. I don’t have any trouble picking undead or orc because they’re both superior.
---
That ship has already sailed, shipwrecked, found, recovered, and put in a museum.
---
It isn't even about our individual experiences. We need this game to be as successful as possible, which means we need the casual players and retail tourists. They won't stay if it's a private server launch shit show. If we can't keep the casual and at least some of the retail crowd, we can kiss classic+ and/or tbc goodbye.

You missed Deadmines.
---
I don't think willingness to bet money with a stranger on the internet is a good metric for belief, but that might just be me.
---
I actually do think that layering will be out by phase 2, and I don't think it will ruin or torpedo Classic.
---
However I also believe that phase 2 is too late, and layering causes more harm than good.
---
A rogue using 2x vanish, 2x blind, 2x sprint etc. will kill any class except a fel domination SL lock and cold snapping mage.
---
I like it as it is. 
---
You can always start 1-2 weeks after launch.
---
BRM/Felwood pvp, bg, and that is it. I have done some 5 mans with 3 ppl. Mostly stratholme + scholo but we had t2.5/t3 gear. You can not get that point if you plan to stick with 2 for the whole game.

I've been running on the Stress test and let me tell you ... if I hadn't just bypassed  the entire starting area, joined a group of 3 orcs and just killed scorpions that were 3-5 levels higher than us, and grinded out the first 4 hours to get to lvl 5 I'd have been sitting there waiting on boars to spawn.  I'd wait till it dies down a little, the "optimal" leveling guides do not work if it takes half a day to level to 7... Although I will say it all gave me a sense of "who cares about speed" when it came to leveling.
---
&gt; It's going to be for a few weeks. It's a necessary evil.
---
Neither of these are true statements. Phase 1 is going to be 2 weeks? Are you crazy?
---
Ion said that it could last all the way up until the launch of phase 2, which could be potentially months.
---
Pirated servers define nothing.
---
If this is an exploit there will be bans, fixes or both for using WB like that when the game is alive. If there are no bans and no fixes, then it isn't an exploit. You don't get to define what is an exploit.
---
Those are both higher skill ceiling classes at max level specially hunter.
---
Mage before hunter. At the very least you'll be able to get in groups and you can make gold off selling portals
---
Yes, but at the same time I feel they're hitting far to weak 1-5. Again, when you see a lvl 1 tag and down 3-4 lvl 4's at the same time basically standing in the same spot, it's kinda wrong?
---
Idk, wish I would have nabbed a screenshot, I was having a good time cracking jokes with the boys tho
---
Please stick to Fortnite.
---
You needed the etiqiette guide? Lol
---
5 MINUTE REMINDER LAYERING IS BAD
---
I feel like this is the main issue we’re running into. We’ve let Blizzard walk all over us for years with all the broken promises and changes. 
---
It’s hard for us to take a stand against blizzard by unsubbing and saying “No. this is an abusive relationship. You can not treat me this way. You aren’t allowed to do whatever you want and expect me to continue paying you” because we love the game and still want to play it for whatever positive aspects remain.
---
I don't distinctly remember any sort of phasing, although I could definitely be wrong. The first time I personally encountered phasing was Northrend.
---
It does not make a difference, especially if you set it to 1 higher. I just thought it was strange that the slider does not allow 144 when it’s likely the second most used refresh rate behind 60.
---
Oh don’t worry I’ll be using Luna too. Their healing prediction is the best out of all the other unitframe addons.
---
That’s the point of my post. I’m hopeful that I can trust Blizzard on this layering thing but only time will tell.
---
For your viewing pleasure every dungeon is now spelled out with its full name.
---
That was poor presentation in my part, from 18-40, dungeon xp/hour was faster than optimized quest routes. obviously we cannot test above 40, but given how much better abilities/talents/gear gets post 40, as do the available dungeons (zf, brd), it's a fairly safe conclusion - most quest routes involve a lot of travel time or grinding post 40.
---
Interesting the average gets higher as level increases. Scholo, UD strat, ubrs and brd all are great and all could have been #1 (in my opinion)
---
You need game time in an NA account to play the test.
---
I'd rather see thunderfury or anal [whatever] than pepe at this point.
---
You all fucked that up for the rest of us. It's good that not downloading this means you won't see that stuff if you don't want to. 
---
Hopefully we won't need an 'auto-ignore' add-on to counter it.
---
Good luck competing with ~2000 people in your starting zone, get a clue
---
The highlighted pieces are actually rubberized keycaps from tai-hao, mainly for show/fps games/league/eso
---
Thanks man!
---
Yup, compared to abusing layering for chests, herbs, minerals, quest items, dodging pvp and generally see people randomly drop once in a while. This will be a problem at an early stage, and we've seen some example of that. Atleast we know what the consequences are without layering, we don't *really* know what problems it could entail for classic. For the 1-5 zones, it doesn't really matter ofcourse.
---
It might be that they already have some tricks up their sleaves, but it seems like they have no clue have to tackle this as of yet, and untill then, my opinion stands.
---
It might take a week or two before it settles down, and things become more playable in the starting zones, but untill then I'd say Suck it up, buttercup.
---
Too bad that modern players are not accustomed to helping and might bash those people sending them to "Google LoL". I really hope that it won't happen much. My hide is thick and I won't care about that, but many people would be destroyed.
---
I just googled it. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Phasing
---
Phasing was mostly used during stealth mechanics, and was a thing before WOTLK, although mostly as bug fixes.
---
No game is meant for that long-term, but WoW was like this, many times before we had phasing. I believe that a decent server cap and queues are all we need, everything else will work itself out.
---
Nope, they made an entire class that absolutely can’t be used in raiding. You just sit in a major city while everyone else kills bosses.
---
I expected it to teach us something.  And i think it did.
---
&gt;Do consider that the game largely involved grinding to begin with. There will be moments when you will run out of quests naturally and will thus have to grind.
---
Doesn't really happen in 1.12
---
hey guys, is layering bad?
---
Breaks my heart that Blizzard ever went public... I feel like that was the majoring turning point. It was no longer about what game the creators wanted to make but instead became what game can be the most profitable.
---
Above level 30? Fuck no. It needs to be stopping right outside the starting zones. MAYBE level 10-15 max. Fuck sharding man for real just put it in starting zones if you have to and take it out after that. Sharding should only be in the game for like 2-3 days max
---
cause 3 months isn't long enough to warrant a friendship?
---
cause you can't form bond with player on the beta and play on the same server as them on release?
---
lemme try this another way:
---
there's no incentive to make friends with people you won't be raiding/grinding honor with! so there's no reason to socialize before BRD at earliest
---
The old servers were literal physical systems. They even put them out on auction at the end. This does not happen these days. They are not going to go back to 15 year old hardware solutions in 2019 no matter how strong people scream. And that's a good thing.
---
Also, Blizzard's official statement is "a few weeks", and that is what I am using. I don't care what people say.
---
Right now I don't have the time to learn classic Priest sufficiently for the results to be representive.
---
Dynamic respawns are really not needed. Why waste time competing for mobs for a quest? There are other things you could be doing while waiting for a spawn. Level your professions, explore and gather flight paths, duel people while you wait, grind other mobs in a non crowded/questing area.
---
meh, as someone who had the overpopulated starter zone woes last night, I really agree with him.  I and a random person I met grouped up and ventured outward, just killing everything we could.  We gained a couple levels this way and found a new quest hub away from the swarm, and it was smooth sailing after that.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that apparently
---
I've also been afraid of that. 
---
"well, not enough people quit in phase 1 and we cant delay it any longer, we are sticking with layering". 
---
I really cant understand why fixing some of the starter quests for bottlenecks and release people i waves is not a better idea, you can even increase the number of max players some 500-1000 and you'll still get some of the advantage that layering provides without breaking immersion, game economy and server population too hard.
---
&gt; If you put in the time, you get to roll on drops.
---
And that’s why I’ll be rolling on dalrends and HoJ as a hunter
---
Haven't noticed that issue on Chrome.
---
Blizzard will not be purposely messing with the layers and the servers on live
---
Thread is called
---
&gt;Can we finally start a petition to stop Layering for every zone above Level 30?
---
You are saying
---
&gt;He is of course saying layering matters wherever it is applied. As in layering is a concern from level 1 onwards, in phase 1.
---
Are you sure you are not the one who doesnt get what he is saying?
---
They did work on Nost, I haven't played on a PS since it was closed. But I know this bug was fixed on a notorious PS with the Nost core only a half a year ago (and yes, it can be considered "reputable").
---
People are worried because there's a strong level of distrust geared towards Ion. Blizzard says it will be a few weeks, but until that happens, weeks could be months who knows.
---
People are just nervous.
---
Not 100% sure but I believe tauren can ride any horde race mount as long as you are exalted with that race
---
I never said 2 weeks, and nobody said it will last for the whole phase 1.
---
I knew lvl 60 content was right out. A ceiling of 50 seemed more reasonable.
---
Well, it's Activision so all you can really do is hope for the best and plan for the worst.
---
Just be ready to bail if the game stops being fun for you. I think that was the biggest problem for a lot of players back in the day. We played much longer than we needed to because we felt an obligation due to the time we spent on our toons.
---
Don't do this with Activision. If the game turns to shit, stop playing. The drop is subs is the only thing that will 100% get their attention.
---
That's kind of how we got classic...
---
We were about due for a “stop complaint about layering” posts after the last 5 “layering will kill the game” posts.
---
Layering being removed by phase 2 is entirely based on how far the population drops. If it doesn't plummet as far as Blizzard anticipates, then of course layering will stick around.
---
And you know why I don't trust them? Because they already tried to deceive us, they continue to move the goalposts, and Blizzard ain't that trustworthy to begin with. This decision likely came from upper management for the sake of keeping costs low.
---
Just a few months ago there were people like you calling me crazy for thinking they would shard the whole world. Look what happened. I'm not a gambling man, but I'm confident I'll be right yet again.
---
But hey, if you end up being right, I'll be glad. I'd rather be wrong.
---
I'll agree to disagree, have a nice day.
---
I repeat, Kappa is bereft of any inherent meaning. Kappa does not mean anything. It is a made up expression with meaning, yes, but the word itself is as arbitrary as if I were to say Yfal. Utterly without any recognizable meaning. 
---
Made up words is what makes me cringe. Yeet, Kappa, leet, etcetera.
---
Yup! Most seem to agree with you as those are all ranked pretty highly. If I took a little bit more time on this I'd be interested to see the actual trend as level increases and fit a line to it, you have to wonder if the trend is based on the dungeons actually being better or if it's just that people prefer/have more memories with endgame content and thus rank it higher.
---
I'd lean towards the dungeons being better because each Dire Maul wing is ranked (slightly) below average, so it does not seem that people are necessarily biased towards the end game dungeons.
---
Pepe is not a meme from 2019
---
It's a meme that was taken from like 10 years ago and repurposed for stupid shit in a very "fellowkids" type of way. Using that meme nowadays basically screams your desperation for non-e;ectronic social interaction. 
---
Not saying you can't use it, go for it. It is what it is, though.
---
Yeah you have one hybrid holy grab Concentration Aura and Kings. Then one grab Imp Ret Aura with his 5 extra points. Setting up your paladins for buffs/auras is like voltron. 
---
So if you are taking a Ret he would not be able to get Concentration Aura with out completely gimping his DPS. It’s to far down the tree. You will want a hybrid Holy/Prot to pick up King’s and Concentration Aura. 
---
So if you are bringing a Ret he is better off not dipping down for Kings and letting a holy bite the bullet for Kings and Conc Aura. 
---
Yes yes “you don’t need to min max. It’s easy mode blah blah” especially for casual guilds min maxing will be better because if you are only raiding 1 to 2 nights a week you will want to get the most out of that time.  
---
I’m not saying don’t bring Rets/other hybrids ever. I’m saying raid comp matters especially for paladins if you want to get the most out of what they bring to the table which is a lot.
---
&gt;There's a reason blizz disabled them in TBC.
---
Because they wanted to be able to design the content without having to worry about making it  too easy with WB and too hard without. It's more or less the reason why they gave paladins to horde and shamans to alliance. So they could design encounters assuming both factions had both classes.
---
They confirmed WB were working as intended in Vanilla. That's just not what they intended for TBC.
---
Found the guy who didn't actually play Vanilla
---
Bweeeeezzhhhhh
---
Have been done in the past, not particularily appreciated by the community either. Screw with guildnames, player-names, economy, etc.
---
Yeah we don't want them to take their time and do things right. That would be absurd. It's not like their company meme used to be "soon"^^tm
---
Crazy how the wow logo still doesnt seem outdated even after all those years. Timeless classic
---
Just find another layer dude.
---
From my understanding: pallys will be perhaps the best singletarget healer. So yeah, you can and will be in as healing spec. Also the buffs are great so.. Even if you do have to be the wrong faction.
---
&gt; They are not going to go back to 15 year old hardware solutions in 2019 no matter how strong people scream. And that's a good thing.
---
I understand that - I am talking about virtual servers. Really I meant "spin up more realms" and I think you know that.
---
&gt; Blizzard's official statement is "a few weeks"
---
Source? I know Ion said it would for sure be gone before Phase 2, but I haven't seen any other statements or guaruntees beyond that.
---
I mean, you could just not be a bitch. 
---
I was talking more about pve situations. Not pvp. 
---
Also these pvp issue you are whining about can easily be solved by the half dozen solutions people on this thread are proposing. Things like only being able to switch once a day(or some amount of time), not being able to switch if in combat, or only able to switch when in a safe zone, etc. 
---
But instead of thinking of solutions, you just want to complain.
---
Its a nostalgia trip more than anything. We’re not min/maxy power gamers but we like to be as effective as possible when we can. And the community is a big part of what makes me want to go back, helping people on quests, chatting about where to find gear and objectives. The little things like that that make the world feel alive that was already on its way put when I left in Wrath.
---
But thats only half of why it sucks imho. Yes its abusable and clearly bad, but it also fundamentally goes against the idea of playing a server in classic. You shouldn't be able to phase out and avoid people in an area, and everything happening on your server at a given location should be the same for all players
---
There are 2 different Interviews in which he confirms that layering is ONLY for a few weeks and he admits that they know, once World Bosses are out, there is only supposed to be ONE version of the World Boss available on the server.
---
Going back from that word would be a huge PR mistake.
---
And the no lifers that hit 60 in 5 days get 7 days to exploit the end game content with layering?
---
What about now?
---
It was fixed two and a half years ago prior to the launch of the server that starts with an E before they split off to become LH.
---
PvP is on the table for us for sure, but we have a soft spot for dungeons.
---
There is a normal category? I thought pvp was normal?
---
you gotta hit up the repair NPC.
---
They should make changing layers once every 30 min or and hour for example.  
---
Making it even higher will probably fix herbing/mining issue as well.
---
also need an active subscription to play on the stress test servers which is kinda upsetting, they let you download and install the client but it gives you an error when you choose the realm..
---
I'm thinking about a leveling build that looks something like this. Sacrifices burst and cold blood for riposte and improved sprint. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/2053001-302050012-500253110330121
---
That's a quick ignore.
---
&gt; after your tanks got theirs 
---
Well, 3 tanks = 6 bindings. With RNG in play, to get 3 of each bindings...there probably have to be like 10+ bindings dropped.
---
GOOD LUCK waiting like 3 years for your turn...
---
Your guild will be in Naxxramas, getting bored of killing KT, before the 3rd tank have Thunderfury, and you will either have MUCH BETTER weapons, either new content is announced.
---
You chances to get Thunderfury are basically negative.
---
Just out of curiosity, where are people getting these numbers from? I’ve seen people say 2 weeks, and some up to 3 months. Are people just pulling numbers out of their ass or was there a blue post?
---
Try playing a warrior lol 
---
Lvl 1-5 no problem but as soon as I left for bloodhoof village the mobs started kicking my ass.
---
I gathered that from your post saying layering is fine. My point is this happens nonstop in this sub. The same posts over and over again. It’s unnecessary
---
TBH, I've been burned or disappointed by a lot of game companies at this point, and I don't trust any of them anymore. I'm in the "wait and see" boat for life. I'll make my decision when August gets here - and worst case scenario I wasted $15(possibly 0 if I score a refund). 
---
You know what I'm not disappointed with? Indie Games. I'd also like to point out that Bloodstained is absolutely stellar. It does have some hilarious visual bugs on rare occasion, but GD this game DELIVERS.
---
Ok? 
---
Not sure what that has to do with my comment.
---
What a resemblance.
---
Played late vanilla through BC and little into LK only on horde. Never raided or even got to lvl cap. Very casual.
---
Going Alliance only because I have never experienced it. Never been to SW or IF.
---
Hoping for a new game feel. Even if it's been almost 10 years or whatever it's been.
---
Do you think more people will play classic on day 1 than they did on vanilla? I think it's an interesting question honestly, since they player group grew a lot from the 1st day. 
---
You can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/BX6S7h9.png) that during the 1st quarter, wow only had 1.5 million subscriptions. Do you think more than that will be trying to play on Day 1 in classic? 
---
Then there is the other issue where classic will differ from vanilla. Vanilla subscribers only went up over the years up until wrath. Classic is theorized to actually decline in players over the 1st few weeks/months as tourist leave and the current pop normalizes(Excluding tourist, this means everyone is online playing day 1/hour 1, but will end up being players only online during different times/days that fit their schedule)
---
SO when comparing Vanilla to Classic release, what are you opinions on these 2 situations. Do you think more players will be online in classic or vanilla? And do you think the players base will grow like vanilla over the months(solution to this is adding servers) or will it decline as the devs think it will(solution to this is server mergers or the layering that they're currently trying)?
---
To simple say "no layering" without discussing at least these 2 factors is rather naive.
---
Yes, 100%.
---
Make a post to let everyone know in case they've forgotten.
---
What player interaction is lost? No one has ever actually addressed my point on how it is wrong. Just people saying 'u dum'. 
---
For  given area, starter zones for example, i dont want to have to deal with 100 people going for 15 mobs. You still get plenty of player interaction with 15 peopke fighting over the same 15 mob spawns.
---
It was a stress test, not regular beta.
---
PWNED ROFLMAO GIT GUD NUB KEK
---
They are going to have to merge realms at some point anyway, even with the layering. So why have layering at all??
---
The reason why I believe layers are more cost efficient than single instance servers is because layered servers are easier to upscale/downscale so you always use the exact amount of resources you need. In the long run it's more cost efficient than single instance servers which have to be manually created or merged and decommissioned when upscale/downscale is needed.
---
Also on weekly maintenance lower number of actual servers could potentially mean less downtime and less time/resources invested in maintenance.
---
The game is like 15 years old. I didn't want to goof things up by breaking some unspoken rule. lol
---
&gt; Anyone arguing in favor of this saying it’s not a problem is missing many brain cells.
---
Nah, thats a bit rude tbh. They aren't dumb they just don't care at all.
---
Look at a few responses in this thread, you can see people literally saying "I won't be playing much so I don't care at all, I don't want to waste time waiting for mobs therefor layering is best for me".
---
If you want to label that with a negative word you could call it selfish.
---
Yes, you are uninformed since the reasons you have are completely wrong. I explained why.
---
Your suggested solution would be a scope increase for no actual benefit but actually less benefit. Realm 1-2-3 is the same thing as Realm1 with layer1-2-3 logically. Layering is also needed in today's Cloud climate. Service elasticity is key, with their current solution they can dynamically increase or shrink realms instead of buying static resources. They don't know if they need 25 Hellscream realms or 3. This way they don't need to know, every realm will scale by itself based on player number.
---
Offering free transfers mean they need to develop that function for classic, for their website and offer 24/7 customer support for it.
---
Your solution is more hardware heavy, more human heavy without any added functionality. You would be a great manager!
---
Well, shit geared enh shaman with shitty weapon doesn't 1 shot players either, we just naturally assumed they're geared didn't we?
---
But I'm aware that ele's power spike comes with AQ gear, it's still a strong spec even before then, I remember grabbing some +nature damage here and there early on, you don't get as much crit/spellpower for sure and your stamina/int is dogshit but you can still pump some decent crits, wouldn't call it 1 shot obviously, but maybe 3 shots.
---
I was there when WoW launched, when AQ opened, when ships were sailing in STM, when the queue was 16K long. I think I can manage overflowing starting zones. What *the game* cannot manage is any technology that fractures server communities. There have been numerous videos showing how layering is ripe for abuse, and every single one of those shows how the technology undermines the core principle of Vanilla: One world for everyone. 
---
If you can't understand why this principle is important for Vanilla, I would ask you to do what you told me: Get a clue.
---
I wouldn't bother with the Zhevra quest if that's the case, just move on. If an area is too crowded, go somewhere else. Maybe do an instance.
---
And how do you know which layer you are on or what layer an alt would get created on?  He's switching layers now, but he can't aim for a specific layer on a server.  You just have to create new characters and hope.
---
Also, I don't see why all of an account's character aren't on the same layer.  A user with a single account can only log into one of their chars at a time.  Layers should be assigned by account and not character.
---
Dungeons wouldn't be layered.... they are already separate instances.
---
I dont think its likely if it came from Blizzard. 
---
"We are fixing the largest bottle necks, you know the quests that respawn once every 5-10minutes and always have a que on new releases?", with the explanation these quests where never intended to be this bottlenecky. 
---
I really hope you are right about the numbers, I really dont think they will help enough tho as they can hardly cross check with their players how many retail players are playing vanilla classic. They are guessing in the dark as this is a completely new occurance. ([well they did release it once and we all know what happened then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyPzTywUBsQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1717))
---
They listened to ~~their shareholders~~ their community when ~~they saw their number plummeting~~ we all rallied behind the idea of an official vanilla server.
---
I had no problem leveling. 
---
I actually enjoyed the fact that I had to fight with other people for mobs. 
---
I got lvl 1-10 in 4 hours last night playing a warrior and I grouped 4 times for quests and enjoyed every minute of it.
---
That line of thinking got us real far with BFA. Blizz has showed time and time again that they underestimate classic hype at every turn. I doubt that trend will end here. The more likely scenario is that classic will be longer lived and popular than they anticipated and they let the server caps be too high expecting people to quit and HAVE to keep layering because it was mismanaged.
---
It existed but it was on a unit type system. Once you killed every mob in an area of the same type, say fire elementals in western arathi, the first mob to die would force respawn and so on.
---
That’s just an example of the things they do
---
You are aware that replying to someone else does not mean replying to OP right?
---
I mean how far will you take this nonsense? It's rather pathetic that you have no idea of who or what you are replying to.
---
Never played a hunter, but aren't the preraid BiS weapons two other swords? I thought Dalrends was only good for rogue and war?
---
Sweet. So when there are 100 people in that spot, it would be cool to have 2 layers of 50 each?
---
I figured Asmongold would already have people willing to carry him.
---
They've also been making games for a long time but doesn't mean BFA is good.
---
The recent one yes. I'm talking about the classic beta in general. You still need a sub to play that. You don't need a sub to test the current patches of retail. 
---
It takes a pretty weird argument to get that to make sense.
---
People saying it will be gone in two weeks are misguided I think. Blizzard already backtracked and said it might last all of Phase 1. The population will still be too high then and this will probably be left in even longer.
---
I was there too bud, and I can say waiting in a 16k que in the first week just won’t work these days, do you agree? What would your solution to this be?
---
If the ignore list is a problem then make it auto send spam messages (but with a 'natural looking' time interval) to whoever tosses that shit up more than once in public chat.
---
They're cool with spam so they should be okay with you doing this to them.
---
I booked some vacation before the release date was known. My fly back home is august 29...   
---
I was so pissed off when they said classic was coming august 27 !  
---
But after thinking about it and having tried the 3 stress tests, I think it's okay to not be able to play on day 1. It's gonna be so crowded at the starting zone anyway. So I'll be there 2 or 3 days max after official release.
---
is the stress test open to everyone?
---
looks exactly like parts of duskwood to me
---
Vanilla was flawed, and is now 15 years old. You're stuck in the past. Not being able to play the game due to so many people is BAD.
---
The reward is playing the game. It's like a good book you don't want to end.
---
Not in the slightest
---
Yes. I would gladly pay double the $ too to sit in that Q. At least the world would be a single breathing, living world... like Classic was intended to be. I don't matter though. What matter are the casual normies, and they all want layering. It's too hard without it, they need it to be easy or they'll cry. Blizz wants that normie $, so here comes the layering baby.
---
There is value in all classes, for raiding. Albeit, you will see a higher Need for Mages, Rogues, Hunters(early tiers anyways), and Fury Warriors for pure DPS compared to the need for hybrid DPS; as an example. Regardless of the class ratio in Raids, absolutely Every class has something important to offer. You might be requested specific builds though, and you should always do your best to work with your team for the best outcome.
---
Layering = Sharding
---
Good point. I thought those were incapacitates but it seems you're right.
---
m'ladies
---
yawn
---
you are blind then lol
---
Yes, however, no matter the amount of promises you hear from a Company doesn't change that they're still a company. If at the end of the day on August 25th the CEO and board said "Nah shut it down" regardless of the investment, that is what would happen.
---
You should never take a product/company at face value until it is in your hands, and met your standards. Until then, it's up in the air.
---
You can level tailoring sort of, but you will need to choose humonoid mobs as your default target mobs.
---
Your tailoring output will fall far short of being able to make something useful for your level.
---
E.g. in your 20's you'll be making level 9 gear.
---
The problem is money,  If you learn "all" the recipes and not just the ones you need to power skill your tailoring, it's a chunk of change. If you make "green" gear to feed your enchanting, your going to blow a ton of cash, on threads, dyes, bleach.
---
You can make bags, to try and offset your costs, however there are going to be a ton of tailors making bags, and tons of people selling drop bags, and then those bag makers buy up the cloth on the auciton house until the price raises,  so your going to end up vending bags instead selling them because the Auction house margins are so low, that by the time you pay the deposit, you'll make more money per bag just vendoring it..
---
Leveling 3 tailoring + Enchanters, making nothing but greens to disenchant and then using those mats to level enchanting was just enough materials to get 125 enchanting. All in costs about 7 gold.
---
Maybe down the line we can get into a 5 man group but it would be a rare day indeed. I had considered a dual hybrid combo most but wasn’t sure if we would get more mileage out of a dedicated dps and a tanky/healy backup of sorts like a Paladin, druid, or shaman
---
Idk. The problem is what defines 'need it'. Some people are ok with having 100 people fighting over 15 mob spawns for quest. Others want 20 fighting over 15 mob spawns. 
---
Outside of that, say in like swamp of sorrows. If there are 50 people in the entire zone across all layers, they will merge the layers into one for that zone.
---
The true bloods leave Activision and create a new studio, and hire on metzen.
---
A lot of people here are recommending shaman, however I disagree.  Here is why:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
First thing is respeccing.  In order for you to get gear you will need to use a combination of dungeon/world drops/quests/raid gear.  Unless you can find a guild that will be willing to take an elemental shaman you will have to constantly respec between resto and ele.  This gets expensive.
---
Second thing is that this class isn't for everyone.  In my opinion it has one of the highest skill ceilings so I rarely recommend it to new players.  Its amazingly strong in group pvp, but not as much in world pvp.  You will end up healing and purging, over doing dps a lot of the time, and some people don't enjoy that.
---
Final thing is gear.  You will most likely need 2 sets of gear for both ele and resto.  Gear is hard to come by early on.  A lot of the gear you desire is also bis for casters and therefore groups might not give it to you till the casters already have it.
---
I know.
---
No they closed servers that were not needed. They trimmed 10 servers down to 2. The stress test itself is 48 hours.
---
So how is this different from sharding?
---
Think the joke kinda misfired, considering just how good this ring is for hunters. Arguably the best class for it.   
---
The staff that drops in DM might be a somewhat better example, where hunters could likely get more dps-oriented weapons than say a mage at that level.
---
Yeah with classic I never remember the servers going down, the login server is what got beat to a pulp every week.
---
Just for the record, as much as I want to spec into riposte, I just can't do it.  I was hoping this post would change my mind, it doesn't...
---
Nah man the neutral faction is the worst faction
---
How sad is it that someone downvoted u for that
---
Appropriate game for an appropriate reddit name
---
So we triple the population but someone avoid tripling those 1% players who aggressively profession. Do tell me how does this work?  Where else in any situation would this be the case? 
---
Say, we get rid of layering. 3k max population per server. And per your current argument say 30% (0.5% whatever) of that population have regular "engagement of professions" (it loot mines and herbs).  Now say merge three of those together what is the rate of those people? 90%, no it stays the same at 30%. Sure on one of these random 3k max pop server you might get 45%, but then on another you might have 20% of the population fit this criteria. 
---
If anything layering just makes this far less random (less variation between servers; same power that makes larger sample size less susceptible to random variations) and averages out the rate of gathering engagement more.
---
&gt;This system will be exploited by the few..
---
How so. Its a possibility i listed a few ways i could think of that would have an impact. If so few are gathering to that the nodes are always up and Hopping between servers would allow a few to get far more than they normally would. But HONESTLY what are the chances of this occurring. Everyone i know is like i am going skinning and mining/herbalism. There is going to be no shortage of gathers.  Tell me, what EXACTLY can they do to get more net resources?
---
You can tempo, still prefer to have my crusader enchant.
---
Thats what layering is. Each layer is a virtual server. Or a subserver.
---
Without stronghold gauntlets you would just be fine with losing to every warrior?
---
 You're a sharp one aren't ya?
---
Ah... Good to see the Huntard bashing mentality is starting up early. &gt;\_&gt; Based on history though, this isn't entirely inaccurate.
---
&gt;it becomes easy and there is no point in doing it.
---
Define this. In retail you don't get better rewards after a certain point, and at some point it will be easy anyway. So what's the point? If the point is not some reward but rather just the challenge then i don't see an argument there too because no one is stopping anyone from speed running whatever you want anyway, a challenge that doesn't give some sort of reward, achievement, leaderboard entry in the game isn't in any way more meaningful than a challenge you yourself made up. If at some point dungeons become easy than just try to do them faster. Its pretty much the same thing. 
---
The purpose of M+ believe it or not was never this anyway, the purpose was to make them relevant throughout the expansion.
---
Totally agree. 
---
I'd rather sit there and stare at the login screen for 2 hours a day than actually play the game.
---
Lol thank you. I’ve gotten more confident with every new video.
---
&gt;The difference he is commenting on though, is how every time you mention NOT doing meta you are bombarded with people telling you that no one will want to play with you, you will fail, and that you will change your mind instantly.
---
I have been playing WoW since vanilla and I've never seen a statement even resembling this. I read this forum most every day and have literally never seen a statement that extreme.
---
Just ask yourself, when you drive home do you take a direct route or double the trip just to see the world? Is it private servers that make you meta game the drive to get home or is it just human nature to take an efficient path? Also min/maxing existed long before private servers in WoW the only difference is that information is much more available since then.
---
Sounds like way too much work. Personally a loot council voting based on a combination of performance and % upgrade is infinitely easier from my experience.
---
These are the same people who Said "You think you do, but you don't".
---
They've been proven wrong once. Why is it hard to belive it can't happen again?
---
Name collisions are trivially easy to avoid. Just create realm groups with shared name pools in preparation for possible future merges.
---
Going for the BM Hunter again, been forever. People used to talk trash back when Molten Core was new, and I told them that it was only because the DPS charts didn't combine beast and hunter. BM was always really good in Raids, CMV.
---
Basically you could split your aggro per dps between pet and hunter better, so you could go all out somewhat earlier on bosses, also mana use/dps was more efficient. There were benefits to it that were great. Plus Eye of the Beast pulling was boss.
---
i am actually eyeing a warlock....but why would you say it like this? :)
---
Ha, good luck finding a group.
---
There should never have been more than 1 chest in the first place
---
I think the test was probably an overwhelming success.  So successful that they decided to really test things and squish everyone down to two realms.  Mob spawns were a definite problem, but the servers held up wonderfully.  
---
Without having the luxury of referencing whatever data they have at Blizzard, i think its safe to assume that this test has been everything they were hoping for.
---
OR you just use EPGP which is essentially same system but a lot less messy
---
No way. At launch barrens/Westfall is gonna be a nightmare.
---
If you have an active sub.  I joined back up 2 days ago to get the chance.  It was worth the $15.  I had soooo much fun.  It was cheaper than going to an amusement park!
---
You really think this idea never crossed their minds?

Dude that us thousand needles.
---
If you decide to play retail, the world is a bit different than Classic and you will level too fast to finish the full story of each zone. It is a bit jarring here and there because of that. For the retail game, the leveling process is much shorter per level than Classic and really is just a chore to hit current content and there probably won't be a lot of people to play with until max level. 
---
I came back to retail for the first time in seven years after the classic announcement and it was fun, but it is more single player with dungeons being the exception. People rush through those as fast as possible though and don't communicate much either. 
---
I give this warnings in case you decide to try retail and it turns you off the whole thing. Classic I expect to be different, the world is harder to play through alone. The journey to 60 is longer than the chore to retail 120, but much more fulfilling because you are likely to group a lot more in Classic.
---
Yeee, that’s why I don’t really wanna play one

&gt; There should be NO SHARDING PERIOD.
---
The first week would be absolute hell.
---
I can't comment on private servers, but threat wasn't really an issue as a bear. I tanked Vael first frequently specifically because I could out-threat everyone. Also tanked all the tunnels on Fankriss off just thorns and well targeted swipes. It could be different between absolutely min-maxed dps or warriors, but I don't recall ever having threat problems. I mostly felt like the limited itemization, especially going into Naxx, was pretty rough.
---
Explain what you mean by tempo?
---
I don’t get what the issue is why am I supposed to be mad
---
So you want sharding is what you're saying.
---
Example: people in "Mactheridos" realm are 90-10 alliance to horde. As a result, alliance can make raids and get their tier 1 quickly. Horde cannot. In order to address this, Mactheridos is getting merged with Kazzak server, which is 10-90 towards horde. Here the opposite has happened. Horde are up and running while alliance are getting slaughtered in BlackRock mountain and are unable to form serious 40 ppl raids.
---
After merging, in the new "Kazzaktheridos" realm, suddenly fully blown guilds appear out of nowhere. The unlucky 10% of every previous server are now outclassed in their own faction and have no hope to join a prestigious guild or ever kill a world boss. Then phase 2 kicks in and nobody invites them to premades, because look at them.
---
With layering, they can manage a 50-50 pop distribution in every layer, and keep changing it dynamically as people abandon the game. When the server stabilizes, people never experienced mismatch or did not get their chance for greatness.
---
Yup that's pretty dumb. Which is why it's dumb he is in the movies.
---
Just when i thought i was unhyped for pala and going towards wlock again, you pulled me back in! Still two months to go and switch from class every 2 days...

If they can’t then it shouldn’t be implemented.

I don't see anyone at all here saying that those terms like ROFLCOPTER were the height of any discourse. Are you sure you aren't arguing against yourself or an imagined opposition?

Having played the stress test today with a bunch of people: No, I don't mind having to wait for mobs. It actually makes you socialise with people. Group up for common problems etc. But having people phase out is so un-immersive it almost breaks the game for me. I had people in my group at points phase out (it even had a marker on the UI indicating this) while we were still in the same zone. It was terrible and echoes one of the main problems with retail currently: it's a single player game masquerading as an MMO until you get to end game.
---
Holy is the best HPS in the game by BWL. They are THE tank healers. They are the best PvP healers when you factor in all of their kit. Warriors with freedom and cleanse behind them Destroy folks. 
---
Prot as a Tank is hot garbage outside of 5 mans and even in 5 mans a warrior or a bear will always be a better option as you don’t have taunt and go OOM within 1 minute of combat. 
---
Ret brings nothing to the table but lower end DPS in raids. In PVP though they can be very valuable when they play their whole tool kit. Freedom, cleanse, BoP, Stun, spot heal. If you play them as a support DPS you will be a much bigger help to your team rather than trying to be a “DPSadin! I only heal myself. Phat DEeeEPS! I really like Esfand!” Even Captain Retprio knows when to stop tunneling DPS and use his tool kit to help the team.
---
You're in for a surprise come launch my friend.

I've only ever played melee classes so want to get that sweet caster experience. I was going to role a mage but am finding myself getting pulled toward priest. I won't have masses of time to play so I'm looking for a fun class to play (hence mage), but I know priests will be in higher demand at 60 so I can utilise my time better instead of walking around IF looking for groups. Thoughts?
---
I would say ZF and Maraudon is the ceiling dungeon wise.
---
&gt; The Monkeynews one makes no sense. He doesn't show anything besides a log in screen and says, "This is in layer 1, 2, 3, 4, etc." He doesn't show proof of that or how he determined that. 
---
He doesn't need to know which exact layer they are on, only that they are on a different layer which is simply as fuck to do just go look at an afk dude and see if he is there on a different alt, its fucking trivial.
---
&gt; Also, his explanation makes literally no sense. He says to move a character across layers you need to logout and login to a different character on a different layer then logout and back into your other character and that'll switch that character to the other layer. That directly contradicts itself.
---
No he doesn't you literal retard, he says to log out of main -&gt; close client -&gt; log in on alt on different layer -&gt; log out -&gt; log into main.
---
Layering choice is not kept when client is restarted but it is kept between logouts allowing you to choose a layer by setting up alts on different layers. You dont need to know alt1 is on layer1 just that alt1-N is on different layers.
---
If youre too dumb to understand a video showcasing exactly how to abuse a system just shut the fuck up.
---
You have to guess.  There is nothing telling you what layer you or your other characters are in.  You just have to log in, see if you see the same people and then if not, you're in another layer.
---
The servers could easily be preplanned. Ironically, they could probably leverage their sharding tech to do it. The only issue would be the economy, but that's still much better than layering.
---
Sorry. I was just discovering the internet at this time, so I only looked at porn.
---
the best reason to bring a druid somewhere was to pick up the loot that the other raid or party member's couldn't use :)  
---
"We have a warrior, mage, paladin and hunter,  so I guess we should get a druid to heal so the retardadin can dps."
---
Gonna have to disagree on that front. Over a month in on a relatively popular server, and quests still take about twice as long as they should to complete, and that's with faster spawn times. It's better than it was the first week, for sure. But it's still not where it should be.
---
If players on different layers can share a name pool in preparation for the coming merge why couldn't these server groups do the same?
---
Just because it wasn’t the purpose doesn’t mean it wasn’t a positive outcome. 
---
Let’s say mythic plus stopped scaling up at +5. Eventually you’d outgear it, there is no challenge, no reward, no point. It wouldn’t even be fun to speedrun, eventually you’d just pull everything up to a boss and aoe.
---
As it stands, you can always strive to complete higher and higher keys, pushing your character to the limit and accomplishing an increasingly difficult task. You have to cooperate and strategize in order to do something other people can’t do.
---
There may not be a gear reward for that, but the personal accomplishment is definitely rewarding. As I said, I know a ton of people who love to do this, and this is basically what has turned into competitive mythic +.
---
Not sure if that's a serious question or your just venting or trolling?
---
Imagine getting dumped on by a gnome rogue, or imagine a gnome warrior tanking Kel'Thuzad. How can you hate them? They also have Escape Artist which is my favorite racial in the game, even with its vanilla cast time
---
No. They aren't collecting data in how many will play. They just want to test how servers handle high loads. Where players are from or if they will actually play on release doesn't matter.
---
The first dungeon you can run on the alliance side is in Westfall, in the 18-21 level range. I won't say too much about it but when you are questing there make sure you do the quest line to investigate the defias brotherhood, it will eventually lead you to the dungeon and the final quest gives some dope loot.
---
Guessing game.

I hate BFA design and it was unfinished garbage but the launch day of BFA was butter smooth.

Orb of deception? Or private server special rules.
---
So basically the original meme represents a doctor saying something along the lines of “hey this X-ray is totally harmless. No need for you to worry!” Then the doctor is like decked out in lead aprons or behind some safety glass, etc, implying that the X-ray may be a bit more dangerous than the doc led on.
---
In wow paladins have a spell called divine shield which essentially renders them immune for a pretty decent chunk of time (10sec in vanilla I think). This allows them to use a hearthstone to teleport to a safe area without interruption. 
---
Now if we look at the original meme, the doctor is protected from the “harmless” X-rays by like a glass box or a hazmat suit or something. If you look at OP’s spin on the meme, the Paladin using bubble-hearth is meant to represent that same idea. Hope the joke makes more sense!
---
If people who hated pandas are retarded, does that mean people who hated Jar Jar are retarded too?
---
How do you start another cast before one is done?
---
Yes, but they aren't independent. If they locked the layers down so that they looked and acted like independentservers from the player's perspective, I'd be happy with that.
---
(P.S. If anyone has a level 10 char and wants to post this picture on the beta forums, go for it)
---
Not really paladins. DKs were introduced in Warcraft 2. They were the spirits of necromancers from the Shadow Council placed in Stormwind knights. So not just paladins being corrupted and turned.
---
You might be right... if streaming didnt exist...
---
I think picking the middle of the week helps them determine a baseline load. If they picked a weekend period I almost guarantee the servers would be overloaded.
---
And actually when I started this test, over half of the servers were showing a high population. No clue why they shut it down to 2 servers. It became a pain in my ass to complete my quests having to search everywhere for things to kill.
---
Excellent to hear! ZF was one i was hoping we could handle. I’ll never forget how proud i was to get Sul’thraze back in the day.
---
The damage difference is less at 40 than 15 so at 60 it might be right but private scaling could be off?
---
Wow, this is one of the most helpful things I had read so far. Thank you so much!
---
wat
---
Don’t worry, it was pure cancer. I quit after an hour and a half nearly at level 3
---
Ha, you start your own group.
---
Okay, in an equally geared, equally skilled fight. Explain how you would defeat a warrior 1v1 when he has a weapon chain and you don't.
---
I still have my one that had the wotlk art on it.  I didn't know they had a cata art one.  Cool.
---
there are no casuals looking to play classic wow.. just us.
---
What are you talking about? Layering is sharding. They built the tech about 10 years ago. Layering is by far the cheapest option. Not only is it cheap to develop, it's cheap to host dynamic servers on AWS.
---
I think it depends on your leveling speed. I tend to take my time so I think I fall a bit behind the main curve and probably see fewer bottlenecks than someone who is riding the population wave all the way to 60.
---
Nobody said Blizzard was very smart.
---
anal [For the Children]
---
Those are completely different scenarios. It was the start of an expansion for a game that was still going to receive development, new content and could be something to stick around for. In addition there was a 50$ entrance fee to begin with. And even with all that, we were still left with dead servers. This isn't a solution to to being able to quest as much as it's a solution for not ending up with dead servers that will need mass merging later which also isn't a good solution.
---
A BFA player caught by the hype (and if we look at twitch, there is a lot of hype) and trying it out, does not need to pay anything except for the 5gb he needs to download. That wasn't the case with past launches. This will attract a lot more tourists than expansion launches in the start.
---
I do however agree that we don't need it for entirety of phase 1, a few days or a week should be fine.
---
&gt; Oh man, there's too much.
---
That's exactly what Classic has that modern WoW lost somewhere along the way: In Classic/Vanilla, there was always this sense of having areas left to explore, of having things to strive for.
---
(Also: If you travel to Loch Modan, take the Deeprun Tram - if you try to go by foot, you'll have to traverse three high-level zones before you get there)
---
Two different terms here. Ferals don't use their actual weapons damage range, they use a base range for cat form and a base range for bear form. Their range moves up +1 for every 14 attack power, so if your range was 1-10, and you gained 14 attack power, your range would now be 2-11. Ferals do use the number shown on your character sheet when you are in form.
---
But also these are screenshots from two different servers, one classic and one private.
---
Dont forget warriors too.

"Leather dps gloves? Warrior wants"
---
"Mail dps shoulders? Warrior wants"

"One handed weapon? Warrior wants"

"Two-handed weapon? Warrior wants"

"Shield? Warrior wants for offspec"
---
"Ranged? Warrior wants"

Enjoy BFA 2. You got Blizzed. Pull out your smartphone, baby, and get layered. :) \*Poof\* Love that melee leeway too. They've been working on this for 3 + years and it will all be magically fixed in a couple weeks before launch. 
---
One dude in a basement in Russia can make a better version of Vanilla WoW then this billion dollar company after 3 years of work. What does that tell you? Charging people subs for possible access to the beta, making people pay $50 for a demo, charging people $ for early access to names, having layering to cut cost and appeal to the normies.. What does it all tell you? 
---
This doesn't feel like a labor of love to me, it feels like a cheap cash grab. I can sense a scam when I see one. "Authentic, Classic Experience." - Blizz. Now here's your layering because we care about the game and we love you. Because layering is an authentic, classic experience. Very honest, Blizz.
---
Gonna need some sauce for that claim. I remember the layering announcement and it specifically talked about layering in "Phase 1" only.
---
These guys are all bashing you, but you're right.  This takes a decent amount of coordination and logging out, exiting the game, logging in, logging out, exiting because your new char isn't on a different layer, then "oh shit" all my chars are on the same layer.  Now I need to ask someone I haven't played with before in general chat if they can help me layer hop.
---
It's a lot of effort for extremely minimal gain.
---
&gt;zero lag in the night on server 3
---
What race did you make? I made a human and was playing around prime time (7pm) and the lag was AWFUL I just turned it off for the night. But my buddy made a dwarf and said there was no lag over there
---
Grow up you sensitive little muffin.
---
If your latency is 150ms, then by pressing the button while your current cast has roughly that amount of time left on the bar will allow you to inform the server of your next cast as close as possible to the end of the current cast. If you're a frost mage chain casting frostbolts, you do this almost by feel, but having a cast at add-on helps.
---
just uncheck it so it isn't capped
---
I suppose that is true; I was going from my own experience with the people I played with and wasn’t based on any actual statistic. However, I’d still say in young/student player numbers comparing the peak of 2006 with the guestimate numbers of active subs now, there were at least twice as many active youngsters back than, than right now.
---
Especially considering only subbed players can participate and definitely not all of them are interested. So after looking at these variables I still stand by my assertion that if any comparison was made from #of active players playing at x time of the day will be inaccurate, especially when you compare it to back then due to sheer number of active youngsters.
---
But also comparing it to retail activity, since I suspect the largest part of the interested group for Classic, will be thise upping the age statistic.
---
But I guess I shouldn’t assert assumptions without checking facts like I did in my previous post :P
---
Haha, my vanilla guild was using Druid tanks up till AQ40, and probably would have done the same in Naxx had we done it.
---
A Feral Druid spec'd for damage can tank better than a Fury Warrior wearing +def gear and a sword/board. And as adds die he can shift back into damage, allowing whatever Warrior would have off-tanked an add for 30-60 seconds to just do full damage the whole time.
---
And this is while still bringing 3% crit to the group he's in, still performing both roles.
---
Most Druids will go healers for a lot of reasons, but it won't be because they *can't* tank. Main reason will be that their set gear will have low competition and is designed for healing.
---
Oh man. Are you trying to create a dilemma? Because it’s working! 
---
It kind of sucks to wait 2 months for Classic’s launch. :/
---
I think it was a success for sure - looking forward to launch even more now that it seems like layering and respawns will be tolerable in the starter zones.
---
Yep same, only happens on old.
---
Or just make your account always on the same layer.  Move everyone in the same guild and friends list to the same layer.  Then your only options for changing are finding randoms in general chat that can identify that they're on another layer.
---
Did you now? \**tsk**
---
It's disgraceful, really. To spread disinformation at a time like this.
---
Thanks for the tip! I’ll have to wait for launch because of the level cap at 15.
---
i don't ever remember the 1-5 mobs being that hard, to the point i used to say to people i played with if i have a character die before level 5 i would remake it as it was clearly cursed, but the moment you get out of the starting areas it was fight for your life, although saying that i think a rogue taking on 3-4 mobs at once isn't right
---
I love this fucking podcast.
---
Lol you don’t need to stick with one. I plan on making a few lvl 60s. Infact a Paladin won’t be my first character. I’m going to wait for all the launch players to die down so I can have a normal/chill leveling experience without too much layering.
---
Your comment chain reminds me of that guy in Kung Pow they trained wrong as a joke.
---
Would get punched in the face, start bleeding on his opponent, and declare victory.
---
You're like that.
---
What was cancer? The chat? I mean, yeah... people were just being silly and saying random and stupid shit.
---
I partied, got some quests done. Left the starting area at level 4, found a lot less competition, quit around level 9.
---
10/10 will do it again.
---
well its not the world bosses that are the issue, devilsaur and essences would be what layering makes broken
---
This is what is tempting me to roll priest

Posting that it's the end of the world 20 times a day achieves fuck all though

My guy do you not drink at all or pick anything up while you're at the keyboard? Do you scratch your head at things that other people do?

It's definitely less frustrating than it was, but I think it's already been confirmed there won't be dynamic respawn in classic, so it's going to be worse than current private server iterations. And I think the majority of players will be more casual levelers, while maybe 10% are going to speed level to 60. I think layering is a simple solution to a complex problem, which means there will be some trade offs, but hopefully the reduce or restrict the worst of those
---
Great tips! Thanks a ton!!
---
Mind Control was such a silly and useful spell.
---
Hunter would be my go to for switching from melee &gt; caster as they are the most similar to any melee, very time efficient in leveling and gold farming, great in solo, world and premade PVP. Only really lacking in damage from AQ+ but if you're on limited time then AQ might not be possible till much later on
---
I feel for your buddy, the process must have been awful.  I had to swap broken phones recently and lost my mobile authenticator.  I contacted support and it was handled within an hour.
---
I was always a fan of the Suicide Kings loot system.  Your idea is similar but it's a bit too confusing with too many variables.
---
Until they remove layering.  Then you just might not see someone else because they quit the game.
---
You bitch about it on Reddit then continue playing the game
---
I agree.  Riposte is a fantastic talent to level with.  
---
That said, i think i definitely take precision first.  They're both great though and i have no idea which is the mathematically superior choice to take first.
---
WoD was better than MoP
---
Just disable fps locking &amp; vertical sync, you dont get screen tearing on a 144hz monitor and the game is way smoother at 300-400 fps
---
I did a lot of vanilla - wotlk, but none of the newer expansions. Three months ago I resubbed and tried the Worgen - cool race! It was something completely new compared to back in the days, I can definitely say follow that advice! Get yourself a good picture of retail, it is fun and lots to do!
---
The wait is hard for everyone :) I play a lot of singleplayer games that I won’t have time for after 08/27
---
Everyone says that, but nobody is ever prepared to deal with consequences. Every single time I've seen a game implement one of these "I'll rather wait than have X" features, it ended up backfiring spectacularly because (surprise, surprise) people don't actually like wasting their time doing nothing while playing a video game.
---
It's funny how people twist stuff here isn't it? Like maybe people are asking about specs and raiding because they're excited? Well said.
---
beyond hope
---
Thanks for the post, we get so meganerd in this sub arguing over 1% here and 5% there for endgame raid balance and shit that it's good to be reminded about what actually matters.
---
I agree. It is also a temporary thing that will be switched off indefinitely, so it's not like we're going to be stuck with it.
---
Hmm, ~2 days of not being able to play or ~2 days of layering?  I think I know what I'll choose.
---
No, if I typed "Pog dude this twitch emote addon is monkaS as fuck" you would just see that sentence, whereas if someone had the addon they would see emotes in the place of Pog and monkaS. Just puts some pretty pictures in their chat window that's all, nothing fancy
---
No probs, I've been relearning a lot of these techniques over the last month in the beta... So much stuff had been forgotten, but it all is slowly coming back. The current game looks very similar on the surface level, but plays very differently once you get into it, so traveling back in time to late 2004-2006 during this beta had been a real trip let me tell you lol.
---
If you have a bit of silver spare, might I recommend learning cooking and first aid, as both can come in handy during the leveling process. Fishing can be useful as well, but can take quite a while to skill up on, so might not be the best use of your time left in the stress test.
---
I mean if you want me to dig out bear tanking AQ40 vids from 2005 then I can do.
---
I was more referring to the centrallized, but downscrolling fill for info with sections, and a background image.
---
That kind of wasn't a major standard back then. Shit used to be made to fit resolutions or stuck to the left side. Background images did not flow naturally like that and often either repeated obviously at higher resolutions or even on the expected resolution.
---
Not in Mulgore that's for sure
---
Its certainly something I am looking in to for future videos.
---
Clip it and run to Reddit and run to this sub to finally, once and for all prove how layering is bad for the game then add my new, refreshing, and insightful opinions on the topic and present the obvious solutions no one else has thought of.
---
This is going to be a problem the first couple of days.
---
Try to move out of the starting zones as quickly as possible. Maybe join a group or play with a friend or two. Simply not having competition for mobs will make you level so much faster, even if those mobs take twice as long to kill.
---
You’re at the club and a lvl 60 slaps your gfs ass and then moves to another layer. What do you do?
---
I do see your point, but I was unlucky with bag drops from mobs only picked up one extra bag. My priority became linen and quest items especially when I couldn’t make it back into town.
---
Beta testers are there to give feedback on systems already designed and implemented.
---
Their feedback on game design and architecture is not welcome.
---
lol k.
---
&gt; As a rogue (or any class really), you're ideally levelling on yellow mobs your level, or green mobs slightly below you. Because of how hit/defense relates to level, this means: the lower a mob is, the probability of an attack missing decreases. In other words, the relative value of Riposte over Precision, is increased the lower level a mob is, and you can double the proc-rate by pulling an additional mob.
---
The thing is, you aren't always in the ideal situation. In fact many times you are going to be forced to fight things that are higher level than you.
---
You don't really *need* the additional power when fighting equal or slightly lower level mobs, but that sweet +hit is going to make a fucking world of difference when fighting things that are higher than you.
---
Isnt that basically how layering works? Each subserver is a layer. You are just using terminology of one level up. 
---
You are calling a server group what i call a server. You are calling a server what i call a layer. 
---
The concept we are using is the same, just the terminology is different.
---
Appreciated!
---
I totally love the devout set. #1 best!
---
Spent an hour crafting that response :) thanks
---
Then quest somewhere else. It's not exactly rocket science.
---
This was way before that announcement, back in November last year. The word layering probably didn't even exist then. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w) is a panel from Blizzcon. I can't watch it right now, so hopefully it contains the info you're looking for.
---
Good suggestion. This is what I plan on doing. I’m just surprised that setting to 144 isn’t even an option!
---
It’s up for another 30 hours or so
---
You know the mount the Lich king drops? Going for TF is like trying to get that to drop twice, then you spend multiple epic mounts worth of gold crafting it.
---
If you or a friend leads an MC clear weekly it's possible, with luck, but waiting for the guild to craft 2-3 then being insane enough to still run a weekly MC clear that late into the game.. nah
---
Unironically yes.
---
I think a big reason it only works with party members is to prevent people from using it for automation.
---
Back to the topic at hand though - I did a couple tests on different deadzones presented at BRM in that video and I feel like it is working correctly or at least very close after doing the tests. It is very hard to stand on the exact spot as the video since it is all pixelated and 4:3 resolution so it looks a lot different.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho3Xb8T4Da4
---
One sword offers 1% crit and the set bonus is 50 AP. Neither say “melee”, so they affect hunters ranged stats.
---
&gt; I heard a lot of people talk up Stormwind so I think I might have overhyped it in my brain by envisioning a giant city that's alive with other players.
---
All of the cities operate roughly the same way. There will be a bunch of people in the "town square" by the auction house of the city and much fewer everywhere else, but as long as you are not on a dead server, there will for sure be people coming and going in those areas as well. You just were going against the stream in a way by rushing into the city. There was no reason for the majority of the stress test population to go there.
---
Once the classic realms go live and people have had a chance to level for a little bit, they will filter into Stormwind and it will have that feel.
---
And it forces you to play with the other people. Almost like it’s a multiplayer game, but on a massive scale...
---
Sure we can both solo these mobs but we’re going to end up fighting over respawns, or we could just making a group and team up and finish it together.
---
Zombies and gnolls outside of brill is good for farming, but I acquired all my linen while leveling this time around.
---
The only other way is server merge after the rush. I believe it is much worse as it will definitely ruin the economy and character names is another problem, even server name is an issue as some ppl care about that.
---
Bottom line there is no silver bullet.
---
How? I've been out of the game for a long time, so don't know what they promised and didn't keep?
---
Thanks for the perspective-- For the 3 hours they wanted concentration on the servers, I could only see things from the forums. So it's good to know that the servers were showing high pop. 
---
I heard that they concentrated them down further because they weren't "full enough" for the stress, so I guess it could be a win for them to know what their peak ramp-up hours may look like.
---
Exactly.  Without layering, starter zone quests, like the very first ones you get, would take over 5 hours to complete alone.  You would be funneling in atleast 5k players per zone into killing a dozen mobs. and they have to kill one of those mobs 8 times.  
---
That's not a grind, that is sitting and waiting for that long.
---
If you have a bunch of ladies in your guild. loot council is the best.
---
It's a fucking company. If you like the product but it. You're not friends.
---
Oh fuck what up dude, you playing in classic or current?
---
No what I am saying is.. do whatever  technology they want in non-contested zones.. but when it comes to non-contested zones don't do anything just let it play out ... this technology will be in place of all of phase 1... that i understand, but basically if you advocate this technology for all of phase 1... you are cool with abuse that will lead to essentially item duping...
---
swapping layers to farm high level materials is a crazy advantage it is absurd to be ok with that...
---
Can someone please explain layering to me? I read it a few times but I don't know what it is
---
\#NoChanges even applies to keybinds! who knew!!!
---
Lmfao
---
Yes, this is that authentic classic wow experience Blizz promised us.
---
Username checks out.
---
How do you stop someone showing up for 1 raid and getting a TF binding by just rolling on it?
---
&gt; And then I rolled on beta server 3 alliance. And the server is clearly layered, and completely dead.
---
Well different servers have different levels of layering since that's what they're testing with this stress test - and they even said they were at one point changing the layers throughout the 2 hours to test things further. So different servers may have different amounts of layers, or different numbers of layers per server, so I wouldn't use this stress test as a good barometer for launch. They're gathering data to determine what a good layer will feel like to the players so they can make sure that's what we get on launch.
---
That being said during prime time last night on Alliance server 3 in Elwynn, it *definitely* felt populated to me.
---
Honestly, you're right.
---
What? Weapon chain is absolutely standard for any melee pvp'er.
---
(you think you do... but you don't)[https://lmgtfy.com/?q=error+37]
---
You are correct.  If I have 2 layers that means the population has increased 2x which means the rate of consumption will increase the same. 
---
Also, all of those materials they are "abusing" get consumed.  The people using layering to gather black lotus are going to make flasks for their guild to progress.
---
It depends on what your primary tree will be
---
Shadow and Disc are the best for pvp in 1.2 but you rarely see tri spec building because you end up missing key ability’s for each build. 
---
You can check out this site for more information. https://rankedboost.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-pvp-priest-build/
---
Classic wow tends to have somewhat restrictive builds for priests, it would be extremely uncommon to see someone venturing outside of the standard pvp builds.
---
I was in a guild that used EPGP and I liked it a lot. It'll be interesting to see how guilds distribute loot now that we all know how the game works inside and out.
---
It's having been disappointed by the lack of "it will be ready when it's ready" lately.
---
Nice change from my hospital. The surgeons literally roll into the trauma bay with mini c-arms to do their reduction manipulations and won't even wear lead themselves unless we yell at them.
---
Your comment makes it seems like sharding removes player interaction, which it doesn't. With sharding you will still be surrounded by A LOT of players, the problem is that you can easily switch between shards.
---
Sharding inherently isn't a bad thing. You REALLY don't want to compete with hundreds-thousands of players for quests in classic, even having above 10 competing for the same quest is painful.
---
It's frustrating seeing people complain about sharding without understanding the actual situation. Not saying specifically you, but some people.
---
Friends don't let friends listen to papa roach.
---
There's no guarantee it'll be gone in 2 weeks, they've also just said "it'll be gone by phase 2".
---
And also 2 weeks is long enough for hardcore players to get some abuse out of it.
---
Arcane Bombs, when you're willing to drop a good sum of gold to fuck someone good
---
Fire ion
---
Same experience on 3. Logged in at 6 PM EST, in Northshire, impossible to kill anything. Wandered over to IF through the tram and the dwarven starting area, saw some players, than nothing. Like maybe 5 in the whole starting zone. Pretty aggressive layering I imagine.
---
That's great! Is he a druid too? You could do some great runs as feral + resto druids ;)  
---
Also, be careful of the mark of tyranny / blackhands breadth quest rewards. Both are great for feral but you can only choose one (mark is BiS for tanks throughout all of vanilla and breadth is near BiS for dps)
---
I'm a little torn now on whether I want to try and play on opening day. On one hand I want to be part of the experience, but on the other hand: whoaaaaa nellie that was a lot of people fighting for mobs!
---
Wrong, fucko. The reason WoW had meteoric growth during vanilla was because it was a good casual game.
---
Who ever said anything about disagreeing with me? Nice try at projection. I'm talking about all the people going around "oh they promised it'd only be 2 weeks" or "you can't switch layers on demand". Both of which are just factually false and goes against Blizzard's own words.
---
I understand how the stats work. Just thought the BiS pre raid for hunters were different weapons.
---
Windows are meant to be opened or closed, not activated!
---
if someone hasn't gotten an item, then their ratio is indeterminate?
---
So sharding.
---
I appreciate the effort anyway &lt;3
---
I agree that there will undoubtedly be more players than past launches - I'm even willing to bet that Blizzard will break all past sub numbers. So you're absolutely right. The hype is there too, like you said, just look at twitch.  
---
I'm not on either side, though I do feel like something needs to be done to stem the populations we'll see as well as the drop-off of people who are no longer interested. I don't think there's a right answer, I just dislike all the exploits and segregation that come from layering.  
---
Though Ion has said that laying will only last a few weeks, I wish I had more trust in Blizzard. I feel like if players stick around and the populations are still high, they'll use that as an excuse to keep it around.  
---
What do you think?
---
Do it.
---
If anything to spread the word.
---
mind controlling a guy off of a cliff is always hilarious. lumber mill flag for example lol
---
My body is ready.
---
😲
---
Thanks for the sauce and the downvote for asking!
---
Lol this is such a pretentious comment. You literally just said “The way you enjoy the game is wrong, my way way is better and makes people happier. You’re going to need to learn to enjoy the game my way before it comes out.”
---
Yep, when you get jumped by a rogue in WPvP. Fear - SW:P - cast mind control - pull mobs. 
---
Watch and laugh.
---
Yes, but taking a company for face value and never questioning isn't solid advice either.
---
Balance really.
---
hydra was also in the team, but don't downplay athene, he was actually a top player himself too
---
I have a theory that suggests WoD's reception was so negative because the stain MoP left.
---
Class design, at least for the classes I play (Prot Warrior, Prot Paladin, Frost DK) were the best they had been since the end of WotLK and were way better than their design for even Legion, given Legion's insistence on removing player choice and ability pruning.
---
Can't speak for the other classes, though.
---
Yeah WoD had issues with a lack of content but frankly every expac has since 2010.
---
Would you care to elaborate on the differences that I pointed out? What if classic is just unplayable similar to how the open stress test showed yesterday, and even that included layering.
---
I hope you're not just being stubborn about "no changes" or actually have something interesting to share that supports why you feel that way.
---
*blue
---
Go all out earlier, diminishing the over-time numbers reduction of things like weapon chain.
---
Was there no Diminishing Returns in classic? Are we just going to get sheeped for 60 seconds over and over? :D
---
layering is an acceptable downside to be able to login, loot items, fight monsters, and basically play the game while you are paying for the wow classic service.  Otherwise, you would be paying for a chat service avatar because of how highly anticipated launch week is going to be.  Even after all the layering Friday-Monday night at ~8pm eastern the servers are going to be doing rolling restarts because of the overload of players on labor day weekend.
---
Kite / fear / stun
---
Blizzard has fucked up everything they've touched for the past five years, WoW especially.  They have to regain our trust, we don't just give it to them.
---
One of my favourite wow memories was day 1 of Burning Crusade with the *entire fucking server* in Hellfire.
---
My experience is basically:
---
* DKP - the "meta" option, everyone uses it, because everyone remembers guilds using DKP in vanilla. Easy to use, easy to abuse.
---
* Loot council - the "We can pretend to be pro" option, great in hands of serious guilds, terrible (and prone to abuse, drama and death of guilds) for others. "Yes guys, the council has decided that this upgrade, just like the 10 before it, will go to one of the officers".
---
* EPGP - harder to explain, harder to maintain, which deters a lot of people initially. Also harder to abuse. Can result in sub-optimal gearing (where a newer recruit has higher prio than veteran raider), which can however be fixed with rank prio (Nontrial &gt; trial). Can result in people passing on small upgrades or offspec due to fixed GP cost (can be fixed with reducing GP cost if nobody pays full cost at initial announcement).
---
* Suicide kings - seems difficult for people to understand (even though its not), ensures equal distribution, makes it extremely likely for people to pass on small or offspec upgrades so as not to "suicide". 
---
All variants have their pros and cons. To me personally EPGP has proven time and time again to be least unreliable.
---
I agree-- it's gonna be super crazy. But is that actually a bad thing? You get to participate in the fray with lots of other people, have some laughs, and *group up* to get tags and objectives done.
---
Reminds me of this : [https://imgur.com/a/ItPb3Mm](https://imgur.com/a/ItPb3Mm)
---
Dwarfs. Solid experience, no lag. Got disconnected a few times, but that was either from announcements or my provider messing with the connection lately.
---
Wouldn't this all be fixed by just making your layer stick to your account rather than your character? That would fix literally every exploit and its crazy that blizzard didn't implement it this way in the first place.
---
Parry/riposte &gt;&gt; 50% offhand damage for leveling/low pvp. At 60 you should spec out of riposte.
---
I tanked as feral, up to 4 horsemen.  Threat was fine, so long as DPS followed the three sunder type of rule. 
---
Air tanking was tricky for more than say 5 mobs, because swipe only hit 3.  So in Mc, my pack of dogs was second to be killed, while I spammed tab swipe.
---
Demo roar or w/e you call the bear version, helped
---
Exactly. They mentioned started zones by name when mentioning phase one as something that was guanteed to be layered. They also said they would extend that to other zones to fit the needs of server stability. Im not happy about it, but they didnt fucking trick us.
---
Did you really have to remove your comment just to repost it as a thread? Yeah layering is controversial, but that a new level of karma farming :/
---
Assuming we have GF's awful generous of you.
---
I'm not defending layering, but the way it works is continent based, not zone based like sharing is. You can't have layering in starting zones, and not have it in Tanaris, for example. 
---
Using it on only uncontested zones or starting zones isn't really an option with how they've designed layering.
---
If someone has a bad experience for a single day and never returns, I would not want to play with that person. I want nothing to do with that awful mentality.
---
You're saying no layers would be bad for the health of the game - my response is that what you're saying is bad for the health of the community.
---
Cata killed all the old zones the talent system and lfg was introduced past ICC so it was used mainly in cata for the first time during progression. Whilst WotlK introduced bullshit like vehicle combat cata did introduce your mandatory bombing quest every zone now had to have. While I agree with your points I truly believe that cata killed wow but WotlK layed the groundwork for that.
---
If you're gonna play right at launch the best leveling strat is not to bash your head on the same quests as dozens of other people.
---
For dwarf/rogue, your best bet is to head straight to the frostmane cave and grind there till 3. Then you should be able to farm the pass to dun morogh till 5. These mobs are not very contested, especially if you are ahead of the quest chain. I used this strat at got alli first 10 on rogue last night.
---
Found the guy who doesn't understand layering so tries to switch topic instead. Go troll somewhere else.
---
You can always set it directly on the console/wtf file
---
You use caps lock like a boomer. Get off the internet dad.
---
Blizzard knows this is wrong, even Ion admitted it. They just don't care. It's a cheap and easy way to run their servers.
---
I just thought it’d get more conversation here, jeez bro
---
You can duel him...
---
This subreddit and quite possibly the Classic community are absolutely wretched. Y’all talk about “community” when opposing ideas of layering, while acting like complete assholes. 
---
I sincerely hope Blizzard does exactly what THEY know they need to do instead of listening to these driveling idiots.
---
You're forgetting that without layering there will be servers that lag so much you literally can't play at all. The alternative to layering is smaller servers, which will result in big queues.
---
I don't know if many of you just forgot how horrendous launch day+3-7 days after was, or if you didn't play back then. It was a laggy, queue-y mess for everyone. Experiencing that once was fun, but never again.
---
 "oh, just play a week later" or "oh, just don't go on that high pop server" or "just don't level in &lt;popular area&gt;" aren't good arguments. They limit player choice and freedom much more than layering.
---
By default everyone jsut gets 1 GP so as to avoid dividing by 0. First raid is usually a roll (or friendly discussion) to get things rolling, yes.
---
New people have higher prio but there's usually a raider &gt; trial prio. This does result in trialers having a bit more prio than usual when they "graduate", however that is both fair (they went without loot, so they can get some) and not as big of a deal (because of the weekly 20% decay).
---
I used to do that all the time on my twinks, make a second account with a dk, log in to random servers with a new dk and group invite my twinks. Some nights I could get 3/12 in one go.
---
This was in cata +
---
Exactly this. " Layers only exist when there are too many people. They are dynamic. So if there is more than one layer.....it means there's a fuck ton of people on both....except on beta because there aren't enough people so they have to test layers regardless. "
---
When classic goes live, there will only be a handful of layers and they'll all be full of people. The idea that you'll be able to bunnyhop about into safe, empty zones full of unpicked resources seems fanciful to me.
---
Has this been brought up on the beta feedback forum?
---
Bye Felicia
---
Man I played on a pserver the other day with 12k ppl. It took HOURS to get out of Northshire, it was awful
---
Or honestly "best case" scenario because of how immensely popular classic is going to be
---
It's extremely false to think they don't have time to fix it before release. It's basically a matter of setting the rules/conditions under which a player changes shards and tuning. All the code is already there.
---
Every. Time. 
---
That or in BRD or BRS, tossing them into that wonderful Lava pit :)
---
It's probably BiS before high end Naxx weapons, I used it with Maladath in OH and raided with it. It's very strong. I would say if the Main Tank has it then Rogues should be able to bid/roll on it.
---
Priests are obviously king of heals. But druids were usually up there above shaman when it wasn’t raid healing at least in naxx
---
I agree fuck leveling never liked it
---
If the data was out there, pservers wouldn't have these discrepancies.
---
I don't think the solution is an option since they allow players to freely group with one another.  This would have to prevent interactions between 30+ and 30=&lt; players.
---
I was on 15, and after about an hour it got much better.  Whatever tweaks they were making definitely improved the experience.  There were still plenty of people around, and I recognized a good chunk of the other player names over the next couple of hours.
---
So why even be hyped for the game? There's no way to know if it even gets released. Or if you can't buy WoW tokens. "What if they lied" is the worst way to go about it. It's just a stupid idea that ruins absolutely every argument someone could possibly make.
---
Classic is there because people asked for it. Layering is a lesser of two evils for Blizzard to deal with overpopulated areas and potentially dead servers later one.  It has enough issues. but allowing world bosses to duplicate would bring a new level of hate against Blizzard. They know that.
---
pure.. pure pwnage?? you think he got his skill from pure pwnage? he was a level 70 troll priest... then he checked the rating.  
---
1500 rating.  
---
athene had 2500 rating bitchessss  
---
you guys are just jealous
---
I know a great little place to fish stranglekelp at level 10 but I have no use for it
---
You know, revenge is a dish, served cold. I'm going slap his ass at phase 2, when we all will be at one layer.
---
H u n t e r W e a p o n
---
To be fair, it depends on whether +15 agi enchant is there at launch or not. If it isn’t then dalrends are worth less than Barbarous Blade/Peacemaker as they have slightly less AP and the same crit. 
---
If it is though, dalrends are the realistic bis until ZG opens, which is a real long time.
---
Even those of us who have had the experience feel that way partner.  Hang out in this subreddit, chat with people and the like.  Or, and this I cannot recommend enough, try out a private server.  
---
Just google "Warcraft Private Server" and read up on it ( I think there is a stigma on here to linking people to it ).   You will be able to explore the same world though you wont have the same level of interaction, and it will give you a chance to try out different classes and zones for a little while before classic is released.  Those realms are set to shut down when classic releases, so you won't want to invest much of your soul there, but it can really make up your mind on what you enjoy playing the most, and give you a leg up on knowing where to go and what to do once Classic releases.
---
YES! Because Mobs in vanilla/classic were actually a threat! A nice way to get reinforcements haha
---
Then fuck them. People who are spoiled and used to having every slight inconvenience catered to like pampered children should just stick with the current game.
---
dw its in the 1st phase only
---
Well, layering is definitely happening for a limited time, so if that is a deal breaker I think you have your decision.
---
It’s the only way the servers are going to launch and people will actually be able to get in. And, I can assure you, it is still going to be packed in the starting zones. Stress testing has shown huge groups of players all in one area.
---
&gt; Essentially turn layers into separate servers with a roadmap for future merging.
---
Yes exactly. When layering was announced, I thought this is exactly what they were doing but I was very disappointed to find out that layering is just sharding with a hat on.
---
twinks need equip too, and selling items to randoms is also a possibility. some other items in mc are still longlifed and usefull. its not like mc gets completely replaced with the next tier.
---
trust me, mc will be your weekly fixpoint for the next 1-2years
---
This is an interesting argument I haven't heard yet. Gives me something to think about.
---
Lag is not the same issue that it was 15 years ago. I'm not saying it's a non-issue, but it's *not* the same issue it was. I don't think that login lag is going to happen. Further, people's computers have been upgraded too, so the video processing lag from having 60 people on your screen will be much less impactful as well.
---
Played on server 3, Tauran starting zone was not packed at all. It actually felt really good before they started layering.
---
After layering it felt dead. I leveled really quick and maybe only intrracted with 6 - 8 people lvl 6-15.
---
It sure is nice for professions though....
---
Except all my friends who played classic to wrath and then never touched pc games again said that they'll try classic 100%

One of the questions Blizzard asks is:
---
&gt;Did it feel too empty or too crowded after you moved to the second zone?
---
&gt;Plus you'll be rehashing the same content for a week and a half on those characters. It's going to magnify any tedium you get from doing the same quests/areas.
---
This is why I hate leveling alts.  Some of the quests are just chores and I don't feel like running back and forth from the crossroads to the furthest north east corner of the barrens 3 times just for harpy quests on one character, let alone two or more.
---
"Wow finally I'm finished with the Barrens, you know what I really would like to do?  I'd like to do it all over again 4 times."
---
So because it has one geological feature that is similar, you ignore the everything else?
---
What aspect do you believe can be exploited besides escaping ganking in pvp?
---
Thank you for all of this. Seriously, I appreciate it!

skarm is private server player not vanilla
---
&gt; cata did introduce your mandatory bombing quest every zone now had to have.
---
That was TBC, tbh. One of the first quests in Hellfire Peninsula was a bombing run and I remember at least 2 more (one in Nagrand at the PvP zone and one in ... was it Blade's Edge?). Tbh it was fun for a change. Blizzard kinda messed up in assuming that these things were fundamentally fun and not just fun because they were new and fresh.
---
Look man, before your beard gets in a knot, I'm just saying, there's rhyme and reason for people questioning, and or defending.
---
Thanks. The more I level with a wand the earlier I wish I had it so trying to find a sweet spot for it.
---
Yes, you have to have the training. You have to be exalted to buy the mounts from a race different from your own.
---
They dont have to be invested in that outcome, they could just be really dumb, too.
---
\&gt;  They aren't collecting data in how many will play. They just want to test how servers handle high loads.  
---
Do you have inside knowledge of exact parameters Blizzard is looking at?
---
Don't worry, they'll ruin the game with layering. It'll be in there bud, just for you.
---
Barrens should be the absolute limit
---
it's basically a spell queue, deals very well with latency
---
AFTER they smashed 10 servers into 2 it was pretty much hell in the starter zones
---
You're right Blizzard has never dropped the ball on anything and can do no wrong. 
---
*Glances nervously at BfA, WoD, and Diablo Immortal.*
---
Is there any video footage from their runs ? Twitch/youtube etc. ?
---
It’s my last resort.
---
There is literally no one ever saying any of that.  The only people acting negatively in this and other threads are just complaining about how this is the same thread that's been posted by 200 other people.  It's trying to refute an opinion that doesn't exist.
---
I suggest you roll on the high pop lights hope private server. You'll change your tune immediately I guarantee it. Gl getting to lvl 20 out there when you cant even tag a mob over the other 20 people camping a small area.
---
&gt;The stress test was awful with layering, and it was just a stress test.
---
Which part was awful? It did take about an hour, maybe 1.5 to get out of the starting zone. But once my group was out, we saw maybe 4 other people for the next 2 hours. It went from very dense population to ghost town instantly. And that's also not realistic.
---
Legion's too. WoD and everything before that was a shit show though
---
I feel that Ion is passionate about classic, this was an important part of his era, and he will let nothing happen to his baby (classic). That's what have given me hope everytime, and if you attention to his mannerisms you will see that this project is important to him. I have trust that he will be trying to do the right thing at all times, but anyone can make a wrong judgement. That's why it's good that the classic fans keeps it real. I trust that when it comes to classic, Blizzard definitely tries to do the right thing. I think they might at time need help from the community to know what is the right thing, like they did with their 4 phases becoming 6 phases, and we can't let them keep layering for all of phase 1.
---
I believe the concern is that even with layering it may still be like that. Classic is generating a lot of hype.
---
I don't see how this is proof?  He doesn't even log in to any characters to prove anything.  He says they just 'tested it' so why isn't that clip posted instead of him just clicking around characters at the login screen?
---
I could literally just make 6 characters and say "These characters are all on the same layer" and it would be just as much proof.
---
Need a better clip of 'proof' if you want to make a case.
---
Instance drops don’t require any mount skill (how would you ever ride a tiger as horde or raptor as horde otherwise?). 
---
I’m pretty sure the pvp mounts have the same limitations as the regular mounts, so it would be weird if they didn’t require the specific riding skill.
---
If temporary Layering bothers you THAT much, then don't play. I don't see the issue here. In the long-run, it likely won't matter.
---
Humor
---
I still have a nightelf priest at Max level named pinktacobang on retail. Just skirting by
---
Ugh casuals, go back to retail
---
absolutely. quick heals, blessings, auras.
---
Yeah, it sounds like we value the same thing - community. 
---
Thanks for insight! I’m excited to play more!
---
ye sure they will quit the project after the time and work they put in the money etc ye sure it's how companies work
---
IIRC there's only two riding skills:  Apprentice(60%) and Journeyman(100%).  All mounts fall under these two categories, so there's no Tiger Riding.  You do need Exalted to purchase them from a race not your own however.
---
You people care way too much about loot.  DKP is fine, rolling need before greed with your drunk homies is better.
---
HUNTER!!
---
there's no such thing as horde riding or tiger riding. if you were a human, for example, when you training riding you were only able to buy your races horse mounts. if you were to get exalted with, let's say darnassus, you could then buy and ride their mounts. i'm 99% sure you don't need to be exalted with darnassus to ride the zulian tiger
---
meanwhile on that day everybody was QQ'ing non-stop for 48 hours due to crash, queues, flaling through the world, huge delay and not being able to do any quest, getting booted to zangarmarsh..
---
It's basically 2 or more servers in 1 which you are assigned to according to population of a layer and you can change layers by joining/leaving groups. Layers don't change automatically other than that and each continent (kalimdor/EK) are on a separate layer.
---
If you are a middle aged man with a family and career and not a lot of free time there's a great game out there that caters to your every whim and removes every inconvenience you can think of. You don't have to physically travel anywhere in the game to play dungeons and raids, you can get groups automatically, you don't even have to TALK to people! It's actually available right now, the latest expansion is "Battle for Azeroth". You should check it out.
---
No, it's really as simple as I said. You can freely criticize what Blizzard does, but if you argue that whatever they said might be a lie, then there's no point in arguing. Because no matter what they say, it's wrong anyway. It's okay that people are mad about layering because the current implementation has many issues and Blizzard didn't talk about how, or even if, they want to fix it.
---
But if you don't believe them they'd ever remove layering, what's even the point of the discussion? You can't ever reach a goal, because even if Blizzard admits their mistake and guarantees you a fix, they could still be lying. If this is your premise, arguing is pointless.
---
Argue as much as you want, but not with the "they might just be lying" attitude. At least if you want to achieve something.
---
hahaha he had some classic lines
---
All these delusional people in here advocating to drop sharding need to roll on Northdale and try to get to level 20 before they can have an opinion on this thread. 
---
Maybe sharding isn't the best method to combat overpopulation...but something needs to be done. I guarantee all of you will be tearing your hair out because from northshire until south STV you will be struggling to even tag mobs over the other 30 people camping your area trying to do the same. From 0-30 was the single worst experience I've ever had with WoW. I rerolled onto the lower pop alternative and I loved it.
---
100% confirmed it works. He tested it on stream multiple times. Better get your layering practice in if you want to compete come launch.
---
I'm a casual. I'll have maybe 10-20 hours a week to put into the game depending on the week and I'm excited to play it.
---
Thanks, but i had been refenecing his orginal poat announcing the stress test, not the follow up post, i had known the post for launch day said the correct time. Ill just search for the OG post im thinking of. Thanks for your kind response!
---
I think a paladin pairs well with any class because of how many supporting spells they have. Imagine having a pally pull an entire a area and healing you for aoe grinding. 
---
However I'm really skeptical that popular grind spots will not be contested
---
&gt; Can someone do hunter pets next? I'm almost certain they are overtuned on pservers aswell
---
Ill see what I can do for some low level testing since I have beta, but yea this entire time pets have felt way weaker on beta compared to private servers. Seemingly less durable in some cases too.
---
Yes. It keeps adding up, but so does EP. The ratio is whats important.
---
500/1000 is same as 50/100. 
---
20% decay per week is enough to keep things sane, and some guilds also do a 70% decay the week before new raid tier releases (i.e. post-mc pre-bwl, or post-bwl pre-aq40).
---
Are zonewide chats cross layer? I thought they weren’t, but I could be wrong.  
---
But in my opinion, the only reason anybody should be switching layers is strictly for grouping purposes.  While the specific scenario you’ve laid out would be a shortcoming if the solution, I think all of the abuse it would prevent outweighs the negative aspect of being inconvenienced.  
---
Layers should be treated as mini-servers in that people shouldn’t be flying between them at will.  Allowing them to do so is also what opens be system up for wide spread abuse in the forms we’ve all seen by now.  Making it inconvenient to switch layers should be the goal.  Again, this is all my opinion.
---
&gt;  server crashes with the opening of the gates 
---
this is like phase 4 you're getting angry over nothing go breathe and count to 10
---
How can you be so ignorant! Worldwide tragedy happened - Nintendo Gamecube was released in Japan.
---
You also have double or triple the amount of gathers and players during this time... IE the same amount. You don't really get more resources from layering.
---
**CLASSIC EXPERIENCE**
---
New layer who dis?
---
have to say I had too many mobs today... no one in my zone and all mobs attack me....
---
They really should work on respawn and player population. (Mulgore...)
---

---

---
The worst part is when player allowed layer changes fuck the server up and cause all of the realm servers to crash because one layer is overloaded with asmongoloids.  "Hey subscribers, come to layer 1 so we can do a level 14.25 transmog competition."  aaaand the world server is down.  OH have them randomly assigned to layers?  Makes it even worse because they will keep jumping layers and causing the tech that moves you to be taxed, because people will keep hitting it to transfer layers until they find their streamer overlord.  
---
Also, player assisted layering just allows more economy manipulation.  If it is hidden in systems, there will be people that abuse it like logging into a character in eastern kingdoms, then switch back to a kalimdor player to farm RTV in winterspring, but most players won't know the exploit exists and limit the exposure.
---
I know exactly what server you're referring to and it shouldn't be taking hours to get out of Northshire. I've been testing routes to get to 1-15. At max it should take 30 minutes to an hour even without trying to speed run. I'm not entirely sure how you managed to get stuck there more than 1 hour.
---
You know if there's too much competition for a quest you can just...skip it, right? Leave and go grind mobs for a level, it's quicker than standing there waiting for competition to leave.
---
I found that too playing in my first stress test last night, I assume you played on a private server too.  Because its much more difficult to out run mobs in private server.  I guess I forgot how vanilla was after all these years.
---
So we should cap day 1 players to 100,000 people then? That'd be the most authentic.
---
Both of the sequels were well received by both critics and fans.
---
I don't get it...what is layering and why would you want to do it?
---
I think maybe the alternative would be turning off layering after what, level 15? Once people spread out a little?
---
I’ve derped around on a private server a little bit with a population of 10k and hadn’t seen issues. However, the server was already going strong and it wasn’t the mad dash of people on a launch day, so grain of salt acknowledged.
---
I just want to play with actual people and not the empty void that is retail wow right now.
---
Couldn't decide on what type of character I wanted to play. I'm now almost certain I will play druid to play everything in 1 character. Change my mind.
---
This is all very helpful. Thank you. 
---
But man am I torn on what to do until Classic’s release. I feel like I should watch some videos on the lore of Warcraft or something to bide my time.
---
I would love to see some!
---
Never heard of DKP, can somebody elaborate?
---
After reading the post I conclude it has something to do with raid/dungeon loot
---
I still get how people think that's going to reliably work.  You get jumped, are you going to frantically message your friends list for a group inv in hopes of getting out of the layer?
---
Anal Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
We know what happens when Blizzard "knows exactly" what they have to do to a game.
---
Interesting, I saw people try to get MC pugs together in vanilla, but never saw any kind of reserve.
---
Not sure how the pugs went. I was fortunate enough to be in a guild that had enough people to farm for alts.
---
Where do I sign? Layering is likely to have a dramatic effect on the experience, and mostly in the negative. 
---
Any two Segments see population drops can be merged together. In the mean time players on each segment log in every day to the same player base. Strangers become acquaintances become friends. Same as it was in Vanilla and TBC, just with a painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline. If population does not decline it has the advantage over layering that it allows for Segments never needing a merge.
---
Layering will feel like sharding when the person you quested with yesterday is logged into a different layer today. When mobs, nodes, and people disappear upon group invite. When people are exploiting it and you wonder if you should learn the exploit or just accept that the economy is getting more scuffed every minute. It's exploitable, as we've seen in myriad videos. Plus if the expected population decline doesn't happen on some servers then Layering will be around forever or they'll have to find a way of separating the population. Layering, in most ways, offers an inferior experience to Clusters.
---
I’ve found the scarlet crusade at the tower southwest of brill have a good drop rate on linen and 6 slot bags.
---
Im not playing with layering either. I will patiently wait until layering is phased out, like a good number of other people, I am sure. It is not a bog deal.
---
&gt; I still fondly remember server crashes with the opening of the gates.
---
I very much doubt that you were sitting at your computer going, "Yes!  Server crash!  This is so much fun, what a great time I'm having!"
---
Slightly changing dynamic respawns (which was vanilla, confirmed) is worlds better than layering.
---
Blizzard will save their precious streamers from ganks with this
---
I think you read way to much into that, I mean you do you though my man.
---
AV server isnt online anymore. Cant.
---
Thanks! 
---
And yeah, I’ve been plowing through my gaming backlog this year. Then Classic stress test became available for anyone and now I wanna play WoW. /facepalm. Maybe I should just finish more of my gaming backlog until Classic launches. But I really love this world already, so it’ll kind of suck. Lol
---
The internet is for porn. Good song, also a WoW video.
---
You basically summed it up.
---
As someone who wanted to play a druid, this makes me a little sad.
---
I know, right.
---
It's an entitlement issue. People demand everything always be catered to them and their personal convenience 100% of the time even in a multiplayer environment.
---
still better than ont being able to play due to a clusterF of people.
---
Blizzard knows that no one likes it and they're are doing it anyway. It's not like they are unaware of the downsides. Sharding is almost certainly going to be permanent.
---
so, are you for layering to make AQ event playable and viewable?  or are you against layering to get the classic feel of, world servers are crashing and or completely down when the gates are open?
---
There's plenty of possible abuse even during Phase 1
---
At level 60, and ok geared, the best you could hope to do as a duo would be the sunken temple, and even then it'd be tough.
---
So you're thinking the Zulian Tiger and Deathcharger do not require the specific riding, but the black war tiger does? That would make the most sense to me.
---
I won ZG tiger in my first ZG raid. I had just hit level 60 recently. I was undead and just had the 100% training. Was able to ride it immediately.
---
I've played from AQ to MoP and currently play on a private server. Layering is acceptable to me because it will not have a negative impact on my enjoyment of the game in any way. Someone uses their network of friends to escape from me in PVP by switching layer? That's fine, I'll take it as a win and it's not like I would have got any honour from the kill anyway.
---
&gt;  its about me enjoying myself while playing the game.
---
You sir understand why people play video games.
---
I'm down for the idea, but it's not aggressive enough.  
---
Layering should be limited to starter zones + the next zone(Elwynn Forest + Westfall) with a clearly defined end date. Make it end 2-4 weeks after launch to give some flexibility based on initial player interest.
---
Not to mention most of the Middle East and South Asia play on EU too, so you cover way more time zones by inviting EU accounts.
---
At the end of the day, what I'm getting at is that they as a Company are free to do as they please, they can tell you one thing and do another, it's totally up to them. I'm not arguing that they remove it, add it whatever, I'm saying they have final say in all things. If they feel like it they can change it up last minute. 
---
Sheesh.
---
I get beyond confused about a lot of posts on here. Lots of terminology I need to learn. People keep talking about layering, and despite my efforts to read about it and research it, I still don’t know what it is. Lol 
---
All I know is that I like the quests and stories and atmosphere of WoW so far.
---
This is not only about performance. It's about the entire economy. WoW is BALANCED around a certain player count. Mob spawn timers, node spawn timers, questing area sizes and more. Are you seriously proposing to quadruple the player count but keep everything else the same? That's as "unvanilla" as it gets. People are scared about too many resources because players layer hop. What you propose is the opposite: everyone being resource starved because the numbers don't add up.
---
Same boat, same feelings! My go-to thought is that afterwards I won’t play any singeplayer for a looong time, so the best time for it is now :)
---
people that are going to layer hop will meet competition regardless. The use of layering will not end in making tons of gold. People will use it and meet competition anyways like on normal realms. If you decide to layer hop from 1-5 you will meet people killing devilsaurs. The possibility of being alone in a layer is really small to the point almost impossible.
---
It is only broken if there is not enough players per layer. The more people on a server the more consumables are needed. If the only issue that comes from it is that a few select players are a bit more rich then that is a success in blizzard's eye. They need to make it way harder to swap layers either way.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2ws4m/anyone_just_get_disconnected_from_bnet/).

Thwy need to have some mobility between them to ensure that people can mert with friends. But there shouldnt be alot of mobikity. Like once a week change type of thing. That could prevent 90% of all abuse cases. But still lets people meet up with their frienda if they dont start on the same layer.
---
I'm sorry, but this is just overly complicated. It's such an unnecessary bandage over the wound that is layering. Let's just not have layering in any form.
---
There's a difference between having time to sit in a queue doing nothing, and having time to enjoy playing a game.
---
Honestly retail WoW is about as enjoyable as sitting in a server queue though.
---
What everybody said here. Especially considering that the sizes of layers are said to be 2k-3k people, spanning the entire continent. This will additionally be disabled after Phase 1. This is honestly the best case scenario we could hope for, which avoids the various issues that Blizzard (and some of the community are afraid of). Namely, people dropping out after the launch a few months in. Imagine they don't do layering, but instead of just make X amounts of Servers in order to handle the massive surge of players in the first months. Now imagine a few months into the expansion, and the people that didn't like it start leaving, no suddenly, you have the real chance of being stuck on dying server, just because you happened to pick one where the majority might've preferred retail and gone back there. This is them saving you from having to pay for a server transfer or them having to make a server merger (which would've been 10 times for all the servers involved).
---
You and your boys are questing in the barrens still because 150 people competing for the same quilboars, reddit is flooded with people asking for layering and threatening to quit
---
haha I had to google it to see what people were talking about, thought I'd share to save everyone else the clicks. No problem though!
---
Thanks, you just saved my tail! Tram ride it is!
---
I agree that some people are blowing things out of proportion, but how could you honestly say it's not a big deal?
---
Look at all the arm chair brogrammers complain about storing something client side instead of server side. 
---
What you proposed is already in place on the beta, or at least from everything I have seen.
---
Depends on the server though?
---
 I want the best classic wow experience, and sitting logged out waiting for onyxia CD isn't that.
---
I will admit, on my first MC I was the only other druid.
---
The other druid already had nearly fully Cenarion, and I got 4 peices on my first run.  I was there to do one thing, spot heal and spec resto to get innervate for healers.
---
Have a character on blackrock but don't play a whole lot these days. Addicvss.
---
I don't need to "trust" Blizzard on whether I play the game. I take their content at face value, how it is now. If it's good then I play. If it's shit then I leave it. That's all that needs to happen.
---
if you have an active guild it can work but ye in the end it all depends and the possibilty is really small
---
&gt; why people are so worried
---
Ok so. Let's assume a perfectly even race distribution. It's a little over 300 people per race, at the designed 2500 cap. Now consider that orc/troll and dwarf/gnome start in the same spot. That's over 600 people trying to tag the same quest mobs. Now consider that we dont have layering, so its 2500 x 3. That's up to 1800 people in ONE AREA.
---
My problem with black morass was, although the lore was cool, that "dungeon" set up the idea that a dungeon could be designed that was essentially one room. I suspect this influenced the design of the trial of crusader in wrath.
---
Cool. Go play something else then
---
Make female troll less hideous.
---
Sorry but for me Mop&gt;Classic, best expansion PvP wise. (Yeah im here for best expansion ever TbC)
---
I'd go with a dps class with a tanking pet = hunter / warlock + a healer or an hybrid. That way you have a tank à dps and a heal 👍 good luck have fun :)
---
I feel like layering will only work as intended on popular servers. Big youtubers and streamers who broadcast their server will see a massive influx of players, but other servers will likely have reasonable populations. 
---
I want a blue post stating that "Layering will be in effect until server pops have spread out across the zones". I figure most servers will see it get shut off within 1-2 weeks (if they can shut it off on a server by server basis, I don't know a lot about sharding that's after my time) because it won't be necessary anymore for mob spawns etc. 
---
Private server populations are too high, Blizzard is smart to try and ease the issues of high population. But there needs to be some communication to make sure long time integrity of the game is preserved. Layering as it stands now can be abused, and with the influx of gold and materials that come into the game because of it there will be long term ramifications. 
---
OSRS has the same discussion every time a boss is instanced. There's no risk of competition and theoretically no limit on the number of people doing it, you can flood the market and make things worthless with that strategy.
---
Yep, I agree. Layering is awesome.
---
Then you shouldn't really consider warrior either because you are *going to be tanking*.  You might not do it every dungeon but expect to do it more often than not.  Even in raids, even as a dps warrior, you'll offtank a significant number of fights.  
---
As a general rule in classic, if you *can* do something someone is going to ask you to do it.  For example, hunters are going to have to suck it up and be okay with not dps'ing a fight because they need to kite something.  They are the best, if not only, kiters and *will be expected to do so if the fight demands it*.
---
i was on server 15 tauren zone it was full of cows but once i left the starting zone the next zone was so  much better it was easier to find mobs
---
Whats funny is that if all the idiots making a big deal out of layering follow through on not playing we might not even need layering.
---
Even those thinking it'll only be a month are delusional. The only way layering goes away is if the population plummets far enough for each server to only require one layer. Ironically, even in that case they'll probably just keep layering since people would rarely notice it. Sharding is here to stay!
---
Everyone here will say they're fine with an unplayable experience for the first few days, but for many new potential players those early days can be crucial. Blizzard worries about those players sticking around.
---
**Whisper from the only other guy online at 4AM on a week day:** gz.

Hey man those gummy dicks are tasty as af.
---
That's the 1.12 version which for some god forbid reason classic isn't going with. On classic there's a skill for each kind of mount, but you don't need the skill for dungeon mounts.
---
How long will layering last?  I think for the first few weeks it isn’t a big deal, but if it’s lasting months that’s kind of a bummer...
---
I agree, who cares. Let's layer this baby into oblivion.
---
I recently tried leveling on very high population pserver and it's a fucking drag having to compete with other people for mobs.  
---
I'd definitely take some minor wpvp issues over that
---
I can see why you would think that Ion said it would ONLY be the starter zones, but I disagree. This is the only quote from that video which mentions the starter zones specifically:
---
&gt;The first few weeks, when everybody is packed in to Valley of Trials, when everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited way, to solve the initial launch day load problems, while making sure that in the long run...
---
My interpretation is that he is only specifying that sharding will be used when people are more concentrated in the lower level zones and less spread out around the rest of the world, but he's not saying that it will be exclusively limited to a specific zone. I can see that the word "there" might lead someone to think that he's referring to those zones, but given that he specifies it as "time limited" I think the "there" refers to the time immediately following launch (that he already specified as "the first few weeks". I think that interpretation is also bolstered by him using "when" rather than "where".
---
Thanks so more mobs to kill for questing? Less other players and randome worldpvp or random meeting people you could play with ... Yes that sucks
---
It's already confirmed that we will have pre 1.12 mount system.
---
I personally do not understand the worries about layering effecting the in game economy. I believe the original wow servers had max around 3000 players which is equal to one layer. If a classic wow server had 9k players split into 3 layers that means there is one azeroth full of nodes per 3000 players. According to supply and demand economics both the supply and demand would triple resulting in no change in price. I understand that in reality it will not work out quite as nicely. 
---
Now sure, some hardcore players are going to abuse layering to farm some more ore per hour then they should be able to. However, on the whole there are a lot of casual players who really don't care that for a month after launch some hardcore player i farming some more ore per hour if it means they can get a better less crowded game play experience at launch. I believe botters and gold farmers are significantly more damaging to the economy than layering.
---
My bigger worry is how layering will negatively effect the game play experience. One of the great things about OG WoW is how the world was a complete and persistent world without any loading screens. This will be lost due to layering.
---
You can tell based on the other people around you if you're on a different layer.
---
I agree at 18:00 on friday it sure will be packed. Since its dynamic it will be kind of easier to abuse because of it. You make sure to login before the extra 2 layers are created because of the huge influx of people that arrive home from work.
---
Yes this has been posted many times and the price isn't changing so please stop.
---
&gt;One dude in a basement in Russia can make a better version of Vanilla WoW 
---
Except they can't. They have high latency, estimated numbers and values, and run the risk of being shut down at any given moment. 
---
Private server purists are the worst part of this community. Enjoy your 100 pop servers after August 27th.
---
1.12...so you mean the patch classic is launching on?
---
My dude, I understand how the speccing works, I raided then and now.  You said "ret aura" in regards to 1.x speccing and it was confusing.  I just wanted you to make it clear that you were talking about conq aura, if you actually were, because otherwise I didn't know what you are talking about.
---
Please be aware that words mean things.
---
For sure they need to limit the layering to a few weeks but we need layering for all zones within that time. People are going to go hard as fuck when it launches and it'll be a shit show without layering to get through the initial rush.
---
How about no layering at all? If it's difficult to level for the first 2 days, who fucking cares?
---
I don't need help clearing raids that's easy. Clearing it quickly for a sense of competition is not.
---
The layering is awful. It breaks quests, ruins escorts and like you said can be abused for numerous things.
---
I'm not gonna pay them 15 bucks to test their game.
---
Thankyou :)
---
Deal with it you pussy.
---
I love this quote! It shows have truly deceptive Blizzard is and how the entire community is divided on what layering even is.
---
You have Ion simeotaneously talking about layering being over in a few weeks even though world bosses are phase 2. You're telling me Blizzard made a phase 1 and 2 to smooth out Dire Maul from outpacing MC itemization for "a few weeks?" I mean this literally doesn't make sense. The fastest people in the world are clearing MC in week 1 or 2 and you're trying to tell me phase 2 starts in a "few weeks"? What was the point of phase 2 if the MAJORITY of the player base won't even be level 60 by phase 2....This is a logic bomb in itself.
---
You have the community arguing about what phase 1 is anywhere from weeks to months and it truly shows a disconnect. The bottom line is, you can't trust Ion because he's not trustworthy through the journey of wow.
---
This entire layering debacle will be the one item that sours the game for many. I assure you que times and hordes of people in the first few weeks would never do that, but layering and its abuses will. Anyone who openly concedes to layering didn't even play vanilla, it's just wolves in sheep's clothing wanting to play wow at any cost.
---
I love tanking
---
One can dream.
---
Crap, did I just accidentally kink shame? :(
---
And it was kinda the prime time for that player base too.
---
Personally I believe every layer "hack" or exploit seen so far is not going to be possible in launch. This is just testing.
---
For example, people complain that you can join a friend and go to his layer to get a 2nd rare herb you just picked. Well who says *they wont get transferred to your layer*? Additionally, now that you're in the same layer you'll need to find *someone else* to transfer to another layer. People that know each other and play together are eventually going to find themselves on the same layer and moving layer exploits (even if they dont had cooldowns or something to mitigate them) are going to be very difficult to co-ordinate.
---
Yes, but blizzard is going with the pre 1.12 version for whatever reason.
---
Playing on a private server, Barrens is worse than the starting zones. Maybe because UD at level 10 go there, idk. But I'd like it to extend to level 20 to include Westfall/Redridge/Barrens/Silverpine.
---
And if you have your sound cranked up its really loud and I love it.
---
That’s a great tip. Thanks!
---
Because people gonna human.
---
k?
---
Yep, it's a total bummer having to wait or try to kill a mob. I want layering too!
---
Honestly, I always liked the garrison campaign, the garrison itself and the zones. For a at that time solo player it was a very good installment that at least for me was money well spent.
---
When did he say that? From what I recall it's 2-4 weeks at most.
---
I remember getting hacked once. I talked to blizz and they restored my account. The theft used my acc for farming because I lost all my professions BUT I got herbalism maxed out and a shit load of herbs in my pockets. Didn‘t know what to do and I was so pissed. Never touched this account again..
---
WSG, lure an enemy to near wsg exit portal, have friend priest mind control them into the gates, they get removed from WSG.
---
black lotus, devilsaurs do not vendor for high gold, so good luck getting enough liquid gold.  
---
If you were in a good grey and green farming area to generate gold you would be good to layer if you somehow killed enough to need some more respawns.  And if you could force the layer quicker than just waiting for the first kill to spawn again.  If you hold onto your end game raid mats like lotus and leather until other people start farming up more liquid gold, you will see some higher return than just selling it week 1 or 2.  But everyone will be broke for the first phase of the game until the majority of the player base hits cap and starts generating gold in dungeons and completing max level quests.
---
all the best "end game content" is in dungeons and raids anyway, even goldmaking is just farming dungeons as mage/hunter/rogue
---
I can tell you're not a bowler.
---
Blizzard is a company and not my legaly married wife.
---
for gods sake buy a product if you like it or dont but stop this dumb ass "cultist" behaviour.
---
i demand trust from my partner and my friends and not a fucking Software company
---
it was 11PM CET when the stress test started. Move it 2HRs earlier and it will be a pretty good stress test... but blizzard logic 101
---
Kinda surprised Stockades is lowest. I think it's the first dungeon you gotta be super careful with pulls, and there's also 5 really easy to get quests for it (+another from wetlands) so it's amazing exp. Maybe because it's not worth running more than once
---
Never said anything about him being a good guy 
---
Your ability to fabricate words and place them into my mouth is impressive , though
---
I think also for the barrens and west fall, there’s really not too many levelling options around then and competing for the same mobs and spawns will be exhausting
---
If they were intelligent they would know that people actually like the shit show and if it's a massive hype feat it will contribute to the success of the game. No one wants their hand held
---
Source on the not 1.12 riding skill stuff?  I haven't seen anything related to that.
---
Sounds fine to me. Actually, it sounds even better! I have no interest in sticking my head in the sand and solo grinding quests on launch, I want to play with other people.
---
I mean they almost did with druids. They rolled their 31 point talents into the baseline abilities and buffed the living shit out of them during their rework.
---
They probably were useless in a raid at one point in time. You would have brought 1 for the buff and anymore than that would have been hurting you.
---
Yeah US is better than OCE and EU is like 350ms. Not ideal!
---
I found a Taiwanese streamer, SSQRush, that has some English speaking mods. I'll try and keep track of what her community is doing.
---
It’s more like they are offering to carry people through MC on the condition they get the bindings. It’s not usually a randomly formed pug with equal contributors.
---
Are all the servers interlinked? I thought layering was applied directly to servers so instead of it breaking up millions of players, it just shuffles people around within their own server.
---
I agree, I do t think layering is inherently bad, it’s allows the servers to operate efficiently. But I don’t want it to take away player interaction. 
---
Getting ganked in a lowbie zone? No problem, just swap layers and hopefully the mean level 60 will be gone. As mean as it sounds, I’d rather you be stuck in that layer with the asshole ganker and you call for some help from your faction. Those player interactions make for way more significant experiences than magically jumping your character to another layer, even accidentally. 
---
*I miss the pvp wars in STV. Some jerk ganks your alt and it sparks a guild vs guild brawl. Those were some fun times
---
Lol how can you get so worked up over this?
---
First two zones tops.  
---
E.g. 
---
Elwynn and Westfall. 
---
Durotar and Barrens.
---
But maybe not even the second zones.  If you’re worried about pop in those zones then go elsewhere.  Be a NElf.
---
The compassion falls short in this sub :D
---
Do we know in what app or on what webpage we will reserve names? Will Blizzard be so cruel that they let us launch WoW Classic 2 weeks before release?! :D
---
There were problems yesterday on the stress test in most of the starter zones, huge server lag in Coldridge Valley in particular. There were complaints in /world of similar issues in other lower-level zones. Extrapolating forward, I can see where the initial surge of interested players levels through the first 2 or 3 zones, then it will start to diverge when people either quit, press forward at their own speed or simply meander around discovering things. Beyond the first couple weeks, I can't really see where layering will be necessary.  
---
I think most of the abuse can be avoided if they simply force all characters on an account onto the same layer, and have a mechanism where when a player changes layers, the state of a nearby Node of Interest is reset to not be present for a period of time.
---
If you think they'll have that event without layering I have a bridge to sell you
---
&gt; Stop crying
---
Downvoted, even though what you're saying is correct.
---
also an EU boy, actually thought that the stresstest yesterday was the EU based one since I saw the classic option pop up. Well, wouldn't be the first time Blizz didn't think everything through, but I do understand why they prefer to have majority of their stresstests in NA.
---
I smell tide-pods
---
I don't think anyone is worried about layering impacting world bosses. It's about those 2-8 weeks of phase 1 with layering that worries.
---
More like ~2 months of layer at least.
---
Then go somewhere else for a while and don't bother with zebras.
---
WHAT A FUCKING CONCEPT.
---
&gt; will make leveling impossble because they will be grinding world pvp.
---
there is no reward for world pvp.  they will be grinding raids, dungeons and crafting materials.  at least until there are rewards comparable to the time spent killing you, they are generally not going to waste resources on PKing.
---
It was just a couple weeks ago that people were claiming it was crazy to think people would go to the effort of trying to layer hop.
---
It's all about instant gratification now. People can't tolerate even the slightest inconveniences anymore.
---
That doesn’t matter because if I was alliance I’d just switch to another layer.
---
You don't know if those people left or changed layer and thus are gone.
---
Could be a good thing. It's gonna be chaos in the first 2-3 days so you probably won't miss too much. Also it will just cause you to get even more hyped whilst you wait to go home and play!
---
The truth is that even if it went live as-is, most players wouldn't be bothered by it nor would they bother trying to exploit it. They'd just be happy they weren't waiting in a long queue to get on their server and play with their friends, and that they could group with those friends easily to do quests and dungeons.
---
I'm not saying it should go live as-is, I'm just telling you the reality of the situation. The number of players who would refuse to play or would quit over this is likely quite small compared to the number who would lose interest in the game when faced with long queues or server crashes, or, in the distant future, completely barren severs due to Blizzard opening too many to meet early demand, or the disruption of server mergers and character transfers. Most people just want to play the game and either don't think about sharding or exploiting it, or they're already accustomed to it from it being a part of live for the majority of the games life at this point.
---
I definitely think they need to do more work to make it feel more invisible/seamless to players. The reason people are seeing a lot of this stuff now is specifically because the tuning *has* been changing. That proves that they're working on it. If they don't fix it by release I'll be disappointed but it won't affect whether or not I play.
---
MC was the main reason for me considering a priest, but wouldn't wanna be a healbot in raids. 
---
High chance for it to be an alt tho later on.
---
Easy there guy. Don’t get too upset lol
---
Sounds like that would be a better fit instead of something like priest or a pure class like rogue or hunter.
---
&gt; They should just spin up more servers.
---
I meant realms, and you know that. I understand that server technology is different from 15 years ago. Please don't patronize me.
---
&gt; During? Certainly not with world bosses. 
---
I agree layering with world bosses will be really bad. That does not mean layering will be gone in phase 2.
---
Alright
---
... where's the petition?
---
MOP was the best MODERN wow expansion ever. Without question.
---
10AM PST is 8PM CET. i think that works pretty well
---
Ili couldn't agree more but you wouldn't think they are a company the way people talk on this Reddit. "They reward loyalty" etc. Guess their marketing schemes are slowly sinking in.
---
I think it has to do with the lack of loot and inaccessibility to Horde
---
Have you not played an expansion in the past 4 years? They have 0 launch day lag, no queue's, and nearing 100% up-time the first week of an expansion. Wake up bro, this is 2019.
---
If you don't mind it taking forever, you could do most of the 5 man content if one of you is a hunter/warlock and the other is a healer. I used to regularly two-man a lot of content with a friend of mine's priest alt (so it didn't have raid gear) and my Warlock. And Warlock BIS with and without MC is nearly identical. The pet can tank 1 or 2 things, you can fear/trap a different thing. If your healer is a priest he can MC humanoids and have them be killed off or shackle UD and fear others. A Paladin can just be a Paladin and take a beating. A Druid can have a blast actually using all of his forms. There are definitely some boss fights that have mechanics that can't really be overcome, but those are few and far between.
---
I used to think it was someone trolling in vent/mumble with a sound byte. I got quite a few laughs when we kept wiping and I raged "whoever keeps playing that stupid sound-byte that yells to run, quit that shit and focus".
---
It actually broke down a lot of the stress and we downed the boss on the next attempt.
---
Good work.
---
The background image trick was known, but it meant being creative with the BG you used, using an oversized image (to cover different monitor sizes), and had other issues, such as readability because either you have a transparent background behind text, or you're hiding the BG image.  Really tricky to pull off.
---
I remember so many issues with old background images...  I'm glad they aren't much of a thing anymore.  They were a serious PITA.
---
I think my biggest issue with this is that I can't see it from how you're judging it, where it might well look ahead of its time, but to me I just keep thinking of ways to improve it vastly.  Not really a knock on their designers, it was 18 years ago and my stuff from back then is kind of "eh" too.  I do remember using some of the same ideas back then, though.  Just there's better ways to do them now... especially if you can fully unleash HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery.
---
I agree. Layering goes against everything Classic stands for and is very detrimental to the spirit of the game.
---
Its all about saving money. We're asking them to spend the money to give us a proper experience. Bootlicking scum.
---
They've been so good about PR disasters lately too... oh wait
---
Some people like the shit show, but you have to remember that new pserver launches only see like around 15k people at launch, and even then, people still complain. I feel like the majority if people will just quit if the launch doesnt go well, and even though that might be good for some of us, its bad for the health and success of the game which helps us all long term.
---
I agree. On private servers, with even larger population caps, the first day was unplayable, but day 2 was doable, and at day 3 it was ok.   
---
STV was the final zone that felt uncomfortably crowded to me, where at that point several zones previous had been fine. I'd maybe be fine with 40 being the cutoff. I also don't like the idea of people gaming this system to get resources.
---
We are getting pre-1.12 riding skills.
---
Kodo are such a sweet mount!  I do prefer raptors myself but Kodo is #2!
---
Tauren can ride any mount, but you'll have to grind out the rep to get one or the pvp rank once the honor system rolls out.
---
Yup.
---
Actually, he did both, and even talked about feral tanking right before tbc came out. He had a guildie that raided as bear with him.
---
No ones forcing you to play the current version of the game? Also no one knows about longevity because the game isn't even fucking out yet. These posts should come up when we get closer to the last phases of classic not while it's in beta.
---
For me I lost interest in late Wrath and quit completely in Cata. #1 issue was LFG of course. But also, Trial of the Crusader was boring, SO many badges and grinds, guilds falling apart because everyone just PUGed everything, Shadowmourne and certain ICC items broke Arena, etc. Almost all my friends and guildies quit in this timeframe.
---
It was the beginning of the end, Cataclysm needed to be incredible for WoW to recover, and it wasn't. I don't blame it for the decline though.
---
I, too, will be healing.
---
I know! I wish I kept my gaming magazines from back then, I remember reading it.
---
Wasn’t aware of this, seems confusing that they would revert to pre-1.12 skills.
---
Felt pretty accurate to me. Some classes do better during the starter zones with multiple mobs. Rogue especially since they can’t run out of energy. Stepping out of the starter zone though. Umph. Getting even further just gets tougher. Starter zone is supposed to be pretty chill since it was built for new players in mind. New players won’t think to tag multiple mobs so am experienced player can face roll through but the damage only accelerates from there. Three enemies at once in the starter zone? Easy. Outside the starter zone? Certain death.
---
Your proof is quoting someone that has lied to the players multiple times? Layering is bugged. Even if it is removed later into the release, it can't go live in its current state.
---
Every word is made up and Kappa got meaning now thanks to twitchchat. If you say Yfal nobody gets anything out of it, if you say Kappa people (even if just a small portion of people) will understand its gained meaning: sarcasm.
---
Probably because the old riding was there for the vast majority of Vanilla, and it was only changed prior to TBC.
---
Yeah it is pretty bad when the excitement of seeing huge crowds in WoW wears thin and you realize you are essentially playing an exploration game; when it's not only impossible to do quests, but to even just find a mob to hit or herb/mine to gather.
---
Grouping up with 5 people doesn't matter when there's 90 other people and mobs aren't shareable outside your group. Those chuckles and laughs wear thin after being stuck at level 3 for an hour, despite skipping quests and roaming to find mobs, only to find everyone else is doing the same. It's fine and dandy when it's beta or a test server, but when it comes to actual live servers and it takes a couple days just to get to 10 people won't be happy.
---
Engineering gives this power to other classes. Sometimes.
---
A marathon is a race......................................  
---
I'm sorry, I love you.
---
Thought I read on here somewhere that nodes like this are to detect/mess with gathering bots.
---
I absolutely agree at this point with the tired part of the community. It‘s really like nobody is reading the threads that are already there, or as if there is just not enough of threads about it and blizzard maybe oversees the issue (that isn’t an issue). 
---
Overall the layering/spellbatching/hitboxes threads are really enough like, 2 months ago enough.
---
Guard the WSG flag together. Can be a lot of fun.
---
A knight in heavy armor that bashes you with a big 2 hand weapon. That’s what sold me. You also can find a lot of hybrid talent builds that are useful while leveling and easily switch between a healer and DPS. But a priest can straight up heal as shadow while leveling. It mostly comes down to preference I guess.
---
It's a weird thing classic did to us. I don't remember the max level of any of my toons, but I remember vividly the 60 ding on a scorpion in Silitus.
---
lol never seen that one but that's some next level trolling.
---
I'm all for layering but it definitely needs to be removed quickly after launch. 2 weeks or less seems appropriate, and maybe leave it in the starting zones (elwynn, dun morogh, tirisfal glades, etc) for maybe another 2-4 weeks?
---
I've seen it abused with the gurubashi arena chest and getting out of PvP. I am sure there are many other abuses to it like many have mentioned and not only will it give an advantage if left on for a while, but it also means less populated areas that were actually fun when populated IMO (Goldshire/Main Cities)
---
The best thing, is this actually shows how few Retail people are actually paying for wow right now.     
---
I have about 5 friends we all played wow, none of us do now.     
---
We all would love to be in classic beta, but we aren't paying 15 dollars for nothing.
---
Druid is subpar at every role. You are not free to choose your role as much as you are playing every role simultaneously. They are almost only needed as healers at 60. That being said I'm totally rolling druid.
---
Except all the people who played vanilla as kids, and now have work, families and other responsibilities. Maybe I didn't pick up on your sarcasm.
---
We’ve always been the type to rely on each other, beating as many dungeons as we can as a pair is right up our alley.
---
I mentioned that "there's lots of people who will only play one or the other," but also mentioned that, given the fact the sub covers both games, some may try the other that they effectively get for "free."
---
In the same sentence, I said that. By definition, I would say that's a good thing, but obviously you don't bother reading dissenting opinions or presented ideas that don't just parrot your ridiculous demand. You're arguing out of your ass on your own behalf, don't pretend it's for any kind of selfless crusade. You want Classic, but you want it "cheaper" because you don't want the retail sub bundled in with it. That's not how that works. Try going to a steakhouse and asking for a discount on your steak because you don't want the free bread they serve at the beginning of the meal, see where that gets you.
---
Blizzard decided that the Classic sub will be included with the normal retail sub, so it's $15/month. Technically, Classic *is already free*. You just have to maintain an active sub to the live game in order to get it. You can swing that any way you like to make it more palatable, like you're paying for a Classic sub and getting retail free even though you're never going to use it, but that's just semantics. Blizzard decided that they'd offer a real, official Vanilla experience, but instead of trying to roll that into its own game or sub fee or anything else, since it already uses retail WoW's infrastructure, they just include it. It's easier for Blizzard, it's easier for the consumer, everyone is on board with this **except for you**. If you don't think $15/month is worth it for Classic, don't pay it. They're not going to change the price point because some entitled fool is going off about it on Reddit. :P
---
When blizzard stated that layering will last at the most until end of phase 1, that means nothing to you?
---
You're right that a lot of people may not quit directly because of this, but they will quit indirectly.
---
What happens when they get to level 30 and start thinking "Wait hang on, this 'community' part of the game isn't as good as all my friends said." They'll end up quitting not directly because of layering, but because there is no community, whether or not they realize the reason for it.
---
layer me, daddy.
---
Same here, its gonna be such a clusterfuck at the start... im gonna go really easy at the begenning and catch up. There is no reason to rush unless you plan on raiding hardcore ASAP...  Casual guild will take a couple months to get in MC anyways.
---
Gonna create 2 caracther lvl 5 asap tho, Ill try and do that the first two day ,park them in org/razor hill.  Get some rested XP and go into a harder mode the first weekend to get to 10+ on my main.
---
We've not be told but I assume it will be via the game after you log in (you just wont be able to enter the world).
---
I know layering can be abused, but the "literal proof" you supplied is just someone talking about his theory and provides absolutely no proof what so ever.
---
I'm not denying it's true as it's very possible, but again, that is not really isn't "literal proof" as you claim it to be
---
I'm not a shill. I say myself it is a system I don't like and don't want to have ingame, however there is an actual reason why they do such a system in the first place. Would you prefer having this system or would you prefer having long queues on every server and a huge chance to actually not play during the first few days or even the first week?
---
Given your "dumb shill" comment I assume you're trying to be an elitist, yet have nothing of value achieved in the game back then, just on your broken Privateservers.
---
Clearly a serious question
---
Nice to have as an offtank or to gather adds
---
It's even cheaper to host non-dynamic servers.
---
You’ll just see the plaintext bullshit like pepeGaga instead of the face, just like in twitch chat without the addon.
---
I played the stress test last night and had a great time, tons of people online everyone getting along having a good time. The world felt alive. I didnt even notice layering. 
---
Also keep in mind they will only use layering for the first couple weeks so that people can level. They will remove layering when things settle down. 
---
I'm hyped for classic and cant wait for launch.
---
they could, but then you have a chat service with no monsters or loot to be collected.  Do you seriously think that kind of overpopulation is ideal for the majority of the players logging in to play wow will want?
---
Inb4  "As long as I don't have to fight for quest mobs".
---
I'm gonna disagree, if you plan your leveling and question around the fact that you are going to buy your mount at 40 you can absolutely grind that gold by 40.  You just gotta know where to grind.  And you should be leveling with skinning.  You can quest/grind/skin and vendor your leather and have more than 100g at 40.
---
Mmm, that's encouraging!
---
I don't plan to get ahead of the pack on leveling, though, so I was thinking Warlock first may give me a better head start on the economy (Tailoring) and I could make things more pleasant for my Warrior.
---
stoneform gang who up
---
I dont think thats possible as layering is continent wide not zone based
---
Listening to that one decent song they have
---
wow, that is gonna suck
---
Other tanks. 
---
This is mainly 40man raiding, im refering too.
---
Alot of meme specs perform well enough in 5 mans for there to be no loot issues.
---
It's not even the best sword in phase 1 (Vis'Kag and Brutality Blade have higher AEP) and it's no better than a Ravenholdt Slicer. Though saying that in my eyes it's the best offhand weapon for premade vs pug PVP, mine saw service right up until MOP.
---
hm...
---
solo, with a mostly bis warrior (and consumables), i could handle marauadon/zf and SOME brd (lol @ the idea of soloing the lyceum) without having to do some sort of overboard preparation/meme item trickery
---
if you have something capable of kiting, applying some form of reliable cc, and just generally mitigating damage, you could feasibly clear some of brd. things will likely go horribly wrong as soon as you get a resist/miss on cc though
---
As long as we can toggle the run animations I’ll be happy. The new ones are trash
---
&gt; [They] need to have some mobility between them to ensure that people can [meet]with friends.
---
No they really don't. Just allow players to choose the layer they want to start on just like how you would choose a server and this problem goes away. If you and you're friend want to level together, you can both pick "Darkspear - Layer 3" for example.
---
People saying it will be gone in two weeks are misguided I think. Blizzard already backtracked and said it might last all of Phase 1 or 2. The population will still be too high then and this will probably be left in even longer.
---
The cost of Small Radiants are going to be the bottleneck, you don't want to spend gold to enchant boots that will be replaced as you level, unless you are gonna have them for a while. That's gold you could be saving towards your level 49 mount, or even training skills that will help you reach 40 faster...
---
It's a necessary evil which is why vanilla had layering and every other new hyped mmo does this now right
---
*Laughs in mage*
---
Pally and Lock were at the top of our lists, seemed like the best utility. This is solid info and advice, thank you!
---
I hope all the people hating on layering DONT PLAY, which with then alleviate the problem of layering in the first place. The problem will work itself out.
---
Lmao all these crying Boomers
---
Lol that’s pretty messed up - charging people more as soon as they mention it’s a wedding. Never knew that was a thing. Oh church, you guys!
---
I really enjoyed this, as I've been toying with playing paladin as well. I think I just may have to try it! 
---
Your voice is cool and relaxing, btw.
---
Yea and his boi Furious was a crazy character too
---
So if you play wow and level do you see/hear/feel the gold colour or is it blended with what you perceive it as?
---
sure, but let's say you wanted to get your ratio to 0.6.
---
500/1000 requires 100 ep while 50/100 requires 10.  That means recently promoted raiders come into the raid at a huge advantage over veterans.  
---
I guess the decay might fix this problem.
---
Fun is the name of the game, thank you!
---
It’s primarily because rogues don’t run out of energy nor do they have to build up rage. So during those early portions they have a better chance at taking on multiple mobs. I ran a rogue last night and did completely fine in the starter zones pulling more an one but once I left it became a nightmare. Pulling more than one was an actual fight for survival and getting pulled out of stealth was wayyy easier than I remember.
---
Firstly, about the ressources layers still offer competition but it's competition you can't see without understanding it. An example you're in layer 3 waiting for a quest item to loot. You decide to hop to layer 5 you see someone else also waiting for the item to spawn, layer 6 idem, layer 3-2-1 idem. So resources are going to be competed over every single layer like on the realm. Difference is there will be more copies of that ressource but people will still camp. That is why getting into a layer where you are the only one camping is really rare or impossible. 
---
Secondly the economy will change there will be more possible items on a realm that is for sure because of the amount of copies there are. The auction house will thus auction more rare items but it won't be sold by a couple of players  more players will have access to these farmable items. Making the prices of these items fluctuate more depending on how many have obtained the materials for example.
---
The economy will be affected but it's still going to work and not being exploitable by a certain group. It will still be fair in a sense that there will be healthy competition and there will be less ways to monopolize.
---
&gt;People are just nervous
---
But the seemingly constant reacting as if the sky is falling is absurd.
---
Don't think it's animations, just stuff like foliage.  There was a thread on this sub a couple weeks ago doing a graphics comparison.
---
i mean, i guess if i have to view bullshit in chat i'd rather the bullshit be in english than in unintelligible shortcodes for pictographs and I wouldn't recognize even if I saw them
---
if that makes me 'old man yells at cloud' then so be it
---
There's a classic version of the graphics but because the game is run on a modern engine there are things that won't be authentic, it's a really annoying compromise.
---
What is "Journey of Brann"
---
Going to weird locations and dueling is definitely on the list of things to do.
---
You mean the expansions with Sharding?
---
DKP with a monthly tax decay and loot council/vote for Legendarys. Keep the DKP on a google doc that everyone can see and can update in real time. EZPZ.
---
Rolling for loot will always create drama when one vet loses the big ticket item he has been waiting for for months to a trial/newby. 
---
Do what you want though. If your guild is all there just for the fun of raiding and not the purps it won’t really matter. 
---
Rewarding loyal members for time invested matters though. This is why I think Decaying DKP/Legendary Loot Council is still the best option and the option I will be going with.
---
Yes! I'm hoping it gets updated for classic.
---
yes and sometimes.... not so much
---
&gt; It's also selfish to demand Blizzard remove layering so you have a more consistent and less exploitable PvP 
---
I disagree for two reasons, firstly because we will all be experiencing that wait and competition so it doesn't directly benefit me to keep that aspect of vanilla wow in the game.
---
secondly because the interaction between players, their community, and the games environment are a huge part of why people pushed for classic to come back. They've all done it on private servers repeatedly and yes its a competition for mobs and leveling but that is part of the experience
---
I hope you are referring to 30 mins to get lvl 6 an leave the starting area and not 30 mins to get 15 otherwise I've been playing this game wrong for the last 15 years
---
i care, i think twitch chat and twitch emotes in particular are stupid and cringey and I dislike them so Im not looking forward to chat being filled with pog pog pog kappa kappa kappa
---
I like the sort of attempts that are glorious even in failure.
---
I said it because almost every Thread I see in the wow forums and here on this subreddit are about the Layering and the bad sides of it.
---
It's not a system that should be in game and I agree with that. I agree it's a bad system as well with dozens of possibilities to be exploited. However there is a reason for this system and it is REQUIRED, otherwise people would have a huge chance to not even being able to play in the first days or even weeks.
---
Remember they only plan 8 Servers per Language/Region (thats the update we got ages ago), that is not a lot at all. So I get tired of the people that only complain about it, but forget that it's required so even they have a better chance to play and level.
---
You sound like an angry closet case. Come out, friend, no one cares if you’re gay!
---
Why you are mostly wrong about the resource/economics of layering. You are correct about post layering resource cost inflation. Layering is actually the more blizzlike situation for net resource production (a server wide dynamic scaling option is probably the best solution).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2tqvs/layering_and_statistical_examination/
---
On PvP being able to just leave PvP is bad. However, again your argument about needing your buddies is just as applicable in Layers. If you need your buddies in layer one then you have about the same chance of needed them in layer 2.
---
Now there will be more names to remember for sure as the total population (on at a time) is 6-9k instead of 2-3k. But with 2-3k layers you'll see more world pvp while leveling than you did in vanilla. Its going to be insane.
---
Great data on levels and density.
---
Can't, the newest stress test has no reporting feature.
---
When do you not want to do more damage..?
---
You will every weapon in the entire freakin' game
---
So anywhere with mesas = mulgore?
---
Wait layering is only active for a few days isnt it??
---
That’s actually a pretty interesting experience you had. I’d recommend posting your experience in the feedback thread on the official forums. Only 5 in the whole starting zone sounds totally wack - I was on that server during that time and there were probably at least 50 others.
---
Wonder if your travel left you stuck on a layer that had only really been created for Northshire. Blizz May need to know if their layers are concentrating too much of their density in particular zones
---
The classic launch being smooth is more important to the success of classic than stopping a handful of people from abusing layering.
---
You can also address these abuse issues without removing layering from zones, so your thinly veiled anti-layering bias is obvious.
---
Sounds like bullshit.  MC Pugs were incredibly rare on illidan horde.
---
To prevent servers from having ~300 players after a majority of character log out because they are going to play another flavor of the month game.
---
classic druid discord is doing number crunching and from the 58 level av test they think its only off by 3% at 58 so it might only be off ~1% or less by 60
---
I remember when they released some previews of the soundtrack. It was Stranglethorne Vale and either Duskwood or Elwynn Forest. There is a particular part of the STV soundtrack that I will always take me back to when I was about 13, listening to it in Quicktime.
---
To be fair. A lot of that was due to sharding. Layering is a little different.
---
Hopefully the beta and stress testing helps iron things out.
---
This may come across as harsh but if you're not playing classic for the classic experience then why are you playing? If you want a game where you dont have to worry about there being competition on the mobs you want there's BFA for that.
---
I know what they said, but if you think they won't make a special exception for that event you weren't there in Vanilla and have no idea why they use layering in the first place.
---
You're missing the point. I'm talking about the first couple of days vs. opening day. That's all. Nothing else implied there.
---
Oh fuck yeah, layer it.
---
Ya sure but their infrastructure is so much better now. If a private server is capable of have 12k players all on one realm with minimal lag then Blizz can do x5 that.
---
Yeah people are instantly assuming that if something is different on pserver and classic that it's pserver that are wrong. Obviously private servers got a lot of stuff wrong, but it's still a BETA. Report it so blizzard can check with their own proper 1.12 game.
---
Because there's a fuckton of sharding... The entire point of the post.
---
Shoot thanks,  I was hoping it would spit me out in cold ridge valley like it does .. elsewhere.. Looks like I'll have to adjust my route, thanks!
---
Does taking a screenshot of the photo, I took from my computer screen, on my phone count?
---
You haven't read it properly at all.
---
Ion said the Sharding/Layering will be for a few weeks only. And they will reduce the amount of copies the world will have over the passing weeks. For example, lets say the most populated Server has 6 Copies of the world with each 3000 Players, thats 18000 on a single server.
---
Now over the first few weeks that will decline massively, as some of the players that play it at the beginning, won't stick until the end. They will see what Classic is all about and then go back to other games or to the current Expansion of WoW. So lets say it decreases to 9000 Players on that server, they'll reduce the world copies to 3. And they keep decreasing that as the player amount decreases as well.
---
Eventually, but 100% before World Bosses are out, Layering &amp; Sharding will be removed entirely. It will never be in the game ever again for the whole duration of Classic.
---
Phase 2 isn't released based on the removing of Layering or Sharding. It will be released, as will every other Phase, when the PLAYERS are ready for it. That means Phase 1 will definitely last at least 3 Months.
---
Nobody is rolling tauren on stress test.
---
You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
---
I've often wondered -- if blizzard were to "rewrite" all expansions for Classic, what things should be kept and what should be thrown out?  I don't mind the new races or classes, but consider Worgen and Goblins -- how do you introduce those two races if we practically skip the Cataclysm that defaces old Azeroth (since I think most people didn't like the map changes)?  How does completely removing flying mounts affect expansions that were designed with the assumption that flying mounts existed?  Does removing LFG/LFR affect the actual gameplay?  etc.
---
You don't need to replace DKP with this. We always did this where if you got contested loot you didn't roll again until the people you were competing against also got stuff.
---
lol?
---
Text is a shitty medium for conversation my dude.
---
there was no problem with dynamic spawns for herbs in wrath, I never had a single problem the people who abused it were the gold farmers using maphacks to fly under the world and teleport
---
Why does that seem so unlikely to you? It can be pulled off quite easily with friends. Or just ask your guild for an invite. You could make a macro to spam in guild chat asking for a quick invite.
---
I'm saying log on. Play the game. Experience the mayhem and the frustration that comes with it. That is the entire point of Classic. If you cant do that then you're going to be the person constantly asking and pushing for changes to classic to make it more like retail.
---
Is this stress test available also for players from Europe?
---
Not having one is worse.
---
&gt;  It felt like the invasion it was supposed to be.
---
Did it though? There were an insane number of bodies milling about doing nothing because nobody could find a hellboar to kill.  I get the want of bodies for the feeling of a populated world.  I love it too, but on the stress test I spend an hour running around and couldn't tag a single farstrider.
---
On my hand, its not about the screen tearing and more about the heat production of my graphics card since summer is here. Limiting how hard it works has had significant impact on how comfortable the room is.
---
ZF is actaully pretty easy, I did it as a 60 lock with a lvl 40ish mage fine, never had anything close to an oh shit moment.
---
Had a hernia operation in 7th grade.... never thought I would want one again until this post
---
Sad to see wow turn into such a big ol thing of bitches you asked for classic now take it fucking no layering play like other people did at launch it’s apart of the leaving experience get tanked and if you have a problem with it fuck right off with you’re tight ass wow classic is about the struggle the ganks forcing players to group
---
black lotus farming is a big one.
---
Then play a few months after launch. Problem solved.
---
I relogged multiple times to lock in keybinds and other settings, and never had my adjusted UI scale change at all.
---
Why can't they collapse realms later if pop drops?  
---
Layering is trash. It ruins immersion constantly. I don't want to bother clearing camps just to have them repop/wipe my instantly because too many people logged off. I don't want to run into an empty orgrimmar and have to ask for an invite to the 'busy layer' to see anyone. I don't want cheaters who abuse layers to have an edge over everyone else
---
I’ve been a flipper to stay with friends.  I’m going alliance because I spent less time in vanilla on that side.  Going Dwarf Priest. 
---
Vanilla - started as nelf hunter, ended as Tauren shaman
---
BC - Tauren shaman
---
WOTLK - human DK
---
CATA - off 
---
MOP - human Pally
---
WOD - human pally (barely.  Quit quickly)
---
Legion - human pally then switched to troll shaman
---
BFA - troll shaman (barely.  Quit quickly)
---
Yeah I loved every moment playing MoP, it probably had my most playtime besides WotLK
---
That's the border going from Feralas to Thousand Needles not Mulgore.
---
Took me 3.5 hours to hit 10 from around 9pm est. It was empty in deathknel, empty in brill, empty in all of Tirisfal. I saw maybe a handful of people, but I literally had spawns for myself almost there while way. The only quest I grouped for was bleeding hallows. I don't know, it felt wrong.
---
I thought it would get better in barrens, I would run into people, fight for mobs, have to group for kill quests... But it was the same, it was like having spawns for myself. Cross roads had 8 people... 8! It didn't feel good at all.
---
Now your putting words in my mouth. I've said nothing about changes. Just stop.
---
Slow ass bear.
---
You wait for the next private server to come out and ditch this classic unauthentic bullshit.
---
Yeah I’ve looked at hamstring kiting and I’m planning on playing a PvE server so I won’t have to worry about world PvP. 
---
I think you might be convincing me to play a warrior and then I’ll level a hunter alt when I get bored.
---
I was going to play Warrior come Classic for the same reason, it's the master class.
---
Had my whole plan laid out before realising that Paladin is fun for different reasons in a community driven game.
---
On my first couple hours of playing Paladin I already had new names on my friends list because of all of the people I saved from a corpse run, or just buffed.
---
Lol thanks! With the open beta going on and a level cap of 15, it’s the best time to try every class out. As long as Omar allows it.
---
Now that's just downright evil Lol
---
By the time BFA hit beta, they were already working on 8.1, 8.2 and probably 8.3. So at that point, all they could do was tweak.
---
Not to mention, Azerite and the Heart of Azeroth are pretty much foundational to BFA. It's instrumental to the story, gearing, top-end rewards, reputations, mission table, everything. Acting like it should have been taken out based on Beta feedback would be like playing the Legion beta and saying, "we are tired of demons. Get rid of them!"
---
that was mists bro
---
YES. YES I WOULD RATHER WAIT.  
---
This is the difference between old players and kids coming from BFA
---
Even then, each Layer is planned to be around 3000 Players. There won't be empty Zones like on Retail with the CRZ Phasing of empty servers.
---
I think it is more likely they are using Layering to improve user experience than to prevent server crashes. Server technology has come a long way. Layering won't be brought back for the event because 50+% of the launch day population will be gone by then.
---
I’ve never seen a sentence like that used outside of twitch chat.
---
Sounds good to me
---
Thanks! I think i might do Priest as my main and Paladin as an alt. I really like the idea of a plate wearer with a big 2h sword or shield.  Priest just seems like possibly a more diverse playstyle for me.
---
Because the vast majority of people probably won't have fun waiting 30 minutes to tag a mob in starting zones.
---
There was phasing related to quest progress. So you might see a different version of things than someone who hadn't completed the quest.   
---
That's totally different than layering/sharding for population reasons
---
No. Stress test. Ends tonight I believe.
---
Believe it not not, they made money on every one. Dude I bet somewhere, right now, a hundred thousand Indian children are playing Diablo immortal. In fact I just looked it up. The game is a raging success in Asia. Surprise surprise, the people whose job it is to be smarter than you were smarter than you again. Shocker!!
---
The entire reason I am going back to Classic is because I miss the community aspect that evolved on communities due to no cross realm sharind bullshit.
---
If layering sticks around it will absolutely destroy the biggest reason I have for playing classic.
---
They weren't wide spread because they didn't want to forcefully disrupt communities. But there were free server transfers for population reasons throughout Vanilla.
---
Not every detail and addition to the game after WotLK was a negative.
---
Yep, thats what decay is for (well, one of reasons).
---
Lets say you earn 100 ep per week, and spend 50gp per week (for sake of example).
---
Without decay after 10 weeks you will have 100/50 first week, 200/100 second week, 300/150 third week etc.
---
WIth decay you will have 100/50 first week, 180/90 second week, 244/72 third week etc. 
---
Dont forget that majority of your raiders will have had priority over trials for a while, and gotten some loot, and so giving a few items to a newly promoted person is probably a good idea anyway.
---
The fact that both EP and GP decay at 20% means that the higher your GP is, the more you "lose". Meaning its more beneficial to get more items than to hoard EP.
---
Yeah no, don’t compare the prequels to cata/mop/wod please, those expacs are nowhere near as good.
---
The one thing I would note about Pally is they do lack CC. They probably make up for it more times than not with bubble/freedom/that bubble they put on other people/loh/kicking ass against ud and demons.
---
lol thanks for the laugh. Sweet summer child
---
i used EPGP in wotlk and it was highly satisfactory.
---
Good thing we have two more months of beta
---
Sir, our Classic players aren’t kids at home anymore! They seem to be adults... with jobs?!
---
I'm not putting any words in your mouth. I'm making inferences on your character based on your unwillingness to out up with slight frustration in the earliest part of your leveling experience, and I'm being proven correct by your irrational replies that are quite simply projecting. lol.
---
What the fuck does fort nighters and memers even mean
---
Well if it's the opposite faction you have a good reason
---
100% agree, but I believe Ion was quoted as saying Layering is gone a few weeks after launch, not *after* phase 1, when phase 2 begins.
---
There aren't going to be layers for each individual person like you make it sound. There will still be plenty of people around.
---
I would say a month after that no layering as for zones it should be the 3 first zones so durotar, barrens and ashenvale for example. After that time to put up a server que.
---
Not if both parties can read.  I'm not trying to be a dick I just wanted you to clarify what you were saying, not post some shit we both already know that isn't even what I was asking.
---
But you just said you wouldn't be able to play for 2 days with such a high population.  Layering is only there because of high population.  If the game is playable then there is no layering.
---
Those scenarios operate under the assumption that players know what layer they are on.  Considering the supposed size of each is 2k-3k, I believe the probability to be pretty low that a random player in gchat/friends list will be on a different layer.
---
&gt;I always find myself playing solo because it seems like most folks don’t really want to join a team  
---
No, most people do not want to start a team.  You will be happy to find if you are the first one to send a message or invite, most people will gladly join up.  Unless they already have a team and have to disband theirs to join yours.
---
I see we are on the third attempt of the ass slapping joke. None of these were funny.
---
&gt; Good, they shouldn’t shut down layering. It’s clearly needed for many positive reasons already explained. And it’s only temporary, but dynamic while being utilized.
---
u baddie
---
https://youtu.be/vvrzZgZ2ZDw?t=365
---
Sounds like you fabricating stories to fit your perspective, to be honest. And what Ion describes above will be orders of magnitude worse; as amount of people that will at least try out Classic will be far greater than 2004.
---
 At the very least, the upgrades to hardware combined with the tsunami of players will even out to became more or less same severity as 2004, but your ridiculous claim that 
---
&gt;hardly ever more than an hour even on the most populated servers during peak play times.
---
is straight up lie or misinformation.
---
Even end of Phase 1 would be unacceptable, each phase is months. Everyone is quoting two weeks...
---
One good thing is I didn't even remember how slow it was to grind even when level 10 hits.  A lot of the people that will eventually quit will probably quit before level 20, then they can remove layering.
---
I was playing on Stress Test Realm 12 last night, and everyone was bottlenecked like crazy on the very first quest. I mean like 50+ people waiting around for Wolves with a lot drop-rate item to respawn in the Dwarf/Gnome starting area.     
---
So if you want to see what the game looks like without layering go play on Realm 12 and you'll see why it is needed for the first few days/weeks in busy areas. It would be neat if they could enable it per-zone though.
---
&gt;I never remember the servers going down
---
wut?
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
Guys come back to private servers stop supporting out of touch devs
---
Ah the days of when Devilsaur Tooth was bugged on Feenix.
---
Surprised more people didn’t call in to stress test with how thirsty this sub is
---
There is not much to worry though. World PvP doesn't get you anything anyways during Phase 1. The honor and honorable Kills start with Phase 2. 
---
And even if you jump from Layer to Layer to Layer to Layer and try to avoid World PvP, that just won't be possible. Each Layer is planned to have 3000 Players. There won't be dead zones like with CRZ phasing from empty Servers on Retail.
---
Everyone also forgets this Beta is relatively small so OF COURSE the effects Layering has on there are maken bigger than they'd be in the actual finished product.
---
You won't just be able to hop to another Layer and farm all the Nodes on the same location. On a Beta, of course it will happen with way less Players than the Servers will have during the first few Weeks, which will be the first weeks only with Layering system as well.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills starts at what? 19?
---
Cant gimp Hillsbrad / Southshore.
---
IMO even 20 is too high.
---
I dont know what they will do because I dont work for blizzard and neither do you.  All we have to go off is what theyve said so far.  Direct quote from Ion is  "There will never be layering after phase 1, period.  Quote me on that".  Forgive me for choosing to believe the words of the game director and not reddit.
---
If i remember correctly theres a command prompt code to remove the watermark. Throw it in your start up as a .bat and forget about it.
---
Lol I love how you threw in " I really like Esfand!”
---
Wouldn't it make sense to just turn layering off for contested zones? Everything else is normally a very early zone and will be where a lot of players end up bulked up in.
---
Do you know if Leeway is going to stay the way it is currently? I heard that the weirdness revolving around it was a Cata change and that Blizz was going to need to undo it, but some people are really worried it's going to stick around into launch.
---
&gt; They don't even have to merge and have an assload of servers.
---
blizz has never been one to merge server like Square-Enix did for FF14
---
I don't care about the extra arena trinkets, I care about the immersion being totally fucked. I wonder if any of you kids have played a real MMORPG
---
All WoW servers are VMs. They're spun up on demand. The cost is the same whether that VM is a layer with the same realm name or whether that VM has its own realm name.
---
2dndimension is right. Blizzard is phony/a bunch of liars. If the population is high and it's more popular than they expected, watch them end up leaving it on indefinitely.
---
Cool then don’t play I could care less about sharding and hopefully it makes the 1-10 area more bearable.
---
I didn't say anything. But in any case, I'd actually be excited for those first two "unplayable" days. I want to play an MMO, not solo grind quests without any competition. I'd probably spend those days just doing silly shit like raiding Orgrimmar with 40 gnomes or something.
---
they keep walking it back. you have too much faith in blizz
---
Heal Paladin, Heal Priest, Mage, Warlock, Warrior (you gotta respec often)
---
It's clear you're not doing this on purpose, but you're frustrating me because you are clearly misunderstanding me. I'm talking about the **word** itself having a **linguistic meaning**. lol -&gt; laughing out loud -&gt; it is a real life phrase. woot, leet, kappa and whatever operate as 'inside jokes', terminology which is inherently bereft of meaning. they have meaning because they've been assigned meaning, but the words, themselves, as a word, have no linguistic meaning. Twitch chat is Gen Z's version of leet speak.
---
I love that we’ve reached the point where “launch was a shitfest back then and it has to be a shitfest now or a I won’t play” is the argument being used.
---
Fucking idiot
---
Anything prior to 1.12 is irrelevant to Classic.
---
Come up with an alternative that is better for players AND for Blizzard.
---
Once you do, ask Blizzard to hire you.
---
Balance druid goes oom fast, low mobility next to no CC. The only thing they are good at is big boy nukes (assuming you are well geared). It takes alot of knowing when to go in and finish what your team has started and when to stay back to not just get slaughtered.
---
Lol relatable
---
Yea. We could just come up with a list of zones. That would be best, but more work than I am willing to do on my phone atm.
---
Going to have some really salty hunters if they’re passed up on crossbow of smiting for a melee lol
---
Time makes the memory grow fonder.......
---
Layering is temporary. If you're so vehemently opposed to it you could wait until it's stripped away
---
&gt; That is not true.  The main reason they added Crossrealm was for shorter queue times 
---
can you give me an argument please. why is this statement true. I gave you several
---
 If you played on a Horde dominant server, the game encouraged the Alliance to form premades and use teamwork to win bgs. That is what server community is about.  
---
ideally yes, but this wasn't the case. what happened was a small small small portion of servers did as you described, while the the VAST majority of other servers would just end up becoming non-competitive. the people who were mostly interested in PvP would migrate from one server to another, leaving the server with mostly casual-PvP players, which then made the matches one-sided. I described this to you before
---
&gt; Besides, you were never ranked against the enemy faction. Players would climb honor ranks regardless because od this. 
---
sure, but most people aren't going to care about PvP AND accept losing most games because the meta between the two factions is imbalanced. the people who care will migrate to another server, the rest will just stay away PvP = longer queues.   
---
you keep saying that the reason for crossrealm bgs is shorter queues. that's like saying you stop for red light because it's red. while yes, you stop for red light because it's red, but the much better explanation is that you probably don't want to die in traffic.
---
Ill do the name thing on ago 13 
---
Will casually go into launch , if unplayable I’ll just wait for the Zerg to calm down
---
Not like wow it’s the only thing to do
---
That’s bizarre! There were crowds in literally every part of the gnome/dwarf 1-10 areas. Blizz did say they would be blind testing different layering methods. You had the absolute opposite experience that we did. I had fun, but I would have been more fun if it was more of a competition, and less of a massive cluster-. I like fighting over mobs with people, it’s fun. Last night was less fun.
---
Had no issue, leveled 4 druids to 10 so far.
---
Huh that's really odd.
---
You're never going to get invited to a Naxx raid playing like this. You're doing it wrong.
---
Second tip, if you find a friend you like make sure to check in often, make time for them, occasionally I mail them drops I know they can use. Enchanting recipes and the like. I receive things all the time from my friends. I’m only level 25 on private server and I’m full of health potions. Being a warrior this is nice. If I’m soloing and I get an extra mob I’ll now likely live and save the death and run back time so it’s a big deal.

You realize the AQ event is basically a server event that is as much of a stress test as can be right? People will resub and tourists will return for the event all to have the entire server stand in the same exact zone. No way in Hell blizz would allow the servers to crash to let Ion have his quote, especially considering that's the exact reason they stopped doing events like the AQ gate in the first place. Like I said if you think they won't you weren't there and have no idea why layering even exists.
---
I will not rest until The Horde is defeated!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Although.... I do like Tauren &amp; Orcs. Undead &amp; Trolls can burn in hell though! Especially undead!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I use my jump keep for everything in WoW.
---
Cast spells, attack, auction house.... All whilst jumping everttime I press it.
---
QQ more about MMO's bro. I think you want a single player game
---
It shouldn't be a problem if the layering works correctly.
---
Not really, if twitch chat existed 15 years ago it wouldve been chuck norris jokes, leet hax0rz and all that jazz associated with vanilla barrens chat. Times change and so does what people find amusing
---
Great point.
---
Bigger win than if ya killed him even! Dudes probably not even gonna play again til his hearth is back up. Took him out for a whole hour basically.
---
You dont need anything but you pet, send em in scatter shot and then feign death.
---
Your healer is more skilled.
---
Thanks for the heads up, cc isnt where my mind goes when i think of pally.
---
I cant tell if your serious or being a troll.
---
Hey man get off Reddit and go polish your fedora and comb your neckbeard
---
Forget waiting for a certain zone, after a week there should be no layering
---
Priest won't be high demand unless you plan on healing, which doesn't sound like it reading your message.
---
A musician might release some bad experimental music, and generally their first albums are their best but that doesn’t mean that they forgot how to tune their instruments.
---
I don't think that works?
---
I mained feral from BC on, but your weapon skill in form was always a "paw" type and was maxxed to your level (300 @ 60) regardless of your actual equipped weapon skill.
---
It sounds like you were having fun with the company of people you were with, not the situation you were in.  Thought experiment:  Imagine running into Silithus at 2 fps, crashing, rebooting, and everything but now subtract your friends.  Do you think you'd still be having fun?
---
Keep playing because this won’t be a permanent problem and at least he’s not taking my precious mob spawns.
---
You mad bro?
---
I’ve had my max camera distance go back to default every time I log in.
---
I am going to spam the hell out of raw rainbow fin albacore now I know his name and what he looks like.  also, even though I don't know your name I do know what your characters face looks like so watch out now! /s
---
Exactly. I would much rather have the game be borderline unplayable, as opposed to having those copper bars and peace bloom AH prices be out of whack. AMIRITE?!?!?
---
The human starting quests should eventually direct you to Westfall, which you mentioned finding in another comment you made.  You probably missed a quest that is meant to naturally direct you there, hence why you didn't feel confident going there.  There will almost always be quests directing you to the "next" zone when your level is appropriate.  Sometimes your class trainer will also direct you to a new zone.  If you absolutely missed something and can't figure out where to go even after wandering around, just ask in general chat or google something like "level &lt;x&gt; wow zone".  Some people might troll you, but someone will almost certainly answer helpfully.
---
All that said, as far as natural progression is concerned, Loch Modan is actually the dwarf/gnome 2nd zone.  You can go to Loch Modan and level just fine, but it is a much further journey than you need to make in order to continue leveling.  The game does, for better and sometimes for worse, often direct you to multiple level-appropriate zones so that you know your options.  Generally speaking though, at low levels if it feels like the game is sending you unusually far away, you probably are being sent to another race's level-appropriate questing zone.  While you can literally go to any of them, every race has 3 or 4 nearby zones that they naturally progress through until roughly level 30.
---
Great rant, try reading what you're responding to before taking the time to write something that makes no sense. I specifically said it can't go Live in its current state, meaning it needs to be fixed in beta.  Bug reports and complaints are how things get fixed. Blizzard won't fix anything if there isn't a benefit to doing it.
---
As much as you want.
---
Streamers realms EXCLUDED.
---
Yet he is still one of the most passionate about Classic in the interviews. He is way more relaxed and confident in interviews about Classic. He played Classic back then and did the grind to Scarab Lord. I doubt he sincerely likes everything and every decision about modern WoW either. 
---
But he is the person that officially announces and defends them, on behalf of Blizzard. That is his job. And it's his job because he was previously a Lawyer and exactly knows how to speak and phrase what he is about to say, in order to not say something he shouldn't say.
---
You don't have to like him, I don't specifically like him either, but I know that it's not entirely him or his fault, that made modern WoW shit.
---
Example, in Wrath it was Ghostcrawler. Starting with WoD it was Holinka, now it's Ion. See the trend? Players always look for someone to blame it on, but it's not actually them, but the management in the background.
---
How are you going to access the PC app authenticator when you can't log on to your PC to access it?
---
or Ugly?
---
Yeah, tag-teaming bgs together is something we planned on doing. We’ll get wrecked by premades but 2 working together stands a better chance in a group of randos.
---
Yeah, that's the point. This addon will allow those people to import their twitch emotes into wow chat, which they will cause to appear on each other's screens by typing the shortcuts for them, e.g. "kappa," so your /2 will be an incomprehensible mess of shortcuts as these cretins communicate with each other
---
give me Anal [Corruption] any day. At least I understand what that means.
---
And yeah, I've seen people in the wild type "kappa." I've even heard one poor fuck *say it out loud*.
---
Nah but you're a humorless idiot virgin
---
Phasing was introduced in WOTLK and the first use of the tech that I am aware of was area phasing based on quest completion. They used this in several quest hubs for WOTLK. The idea for realm phasing of players in every zone was an extension of the tech that came about in Cata I believe.
---
also the layers are dynamic, so they do change automatically all the time. not sure what the other poster is talking about. I was on stress test and experienced it. Afterwards I unsubbed from WoW. If they put layering in classic I will play the alternative.   
---
Here are some things that will happen with layering:  
---
\- you clear a camp to get a chest, suddenly everything repops because a new layer was created or a layer was collapsed. Congrats, you have to reclear and hope you didn;t just die from suddenly loading into a fully popped camp  
---
\- same thing with clearing into any cave. hope layers don't reshuffle!  
---
\- you run towards a herb or mine node on the map. RESHUFFLE! it's gone  
---
\- you enter a main city and see no one. You ask in trade for someone to invite you to the 'busy layer'.  
---
\- you talk to someone in general about world pvp but when you arrive nothing is there. Oops you're not on the right layer.
---
To be fair the lvl5-10 mobs in durotar were also being camped hard. Not sure what the best way to get ahead of the curve would be, maybe tons of exploration until you're sufficiently ahead enough to quest again.
---
&gt;the entire point of a PvP server is that you can corpse camp people
---
Lol what. This shitty take is a perfect example of how this sub will believe anything just to vilify blizzard.
---
I played retail on an EU server up to like level 60 or so. I didn't notice significant enough lag during that, including dungeons.
---
They just renamed it, it's a troll, it's stress test only...
---
That just goes to show that launch day being smooth is fucking irrelevant to the quality of the product overall.
---
Thank you for your input, I appreciate it!
---
I truly hope Blizzard is paying attention.
---
Kinesthesis is also another sense (the sense of where you body is within space without looking)
---
and "journey of brann" is the largest thing, and it's in the middle. Wouldn't have thought that
---
&gt; e hardcore players are going to abuse layering to farm some more ore per hour then they should be able to. However, on the whole there are a lot of casual players who really don't care that for a month after launch some hardcore player i farming some more ore per hour if it means they can g
---
its things like black lotus's wich are one per flask and have static spawn points and spawn on the hour or so.
---
May be another bug, but may not be?   
---
I think the stress tests are all going to be done on the actual classic client now. So the beta is still the Beta, but stress tests are just on World of Warcraft Classic servers.
---
heheheh
---
sum it up pretty well. I'm 36, being playing since launch and yeah I don't get that Twitch emote thingy but made me laugh when I saw an addon for that.
---
People are too butt-hurt nowadays
---

full tier 0.. oh boy... the pain

The only thing holding me back from playing a priest is that if I’m on the alliance, I can’t justify playing a human or night elf priest when dwarfs have fear ward. And since I don’t like the looks of dwarf priests or can’t handle the criticism of guild mates when they ask “Why did you waste all that time leveling to 60 and not make a dwarf?” I have just stayed away from the class in Vanilla servers lol.
---
never thought about that, early levels resource regen is a lot better, never played rogue until wrath i think and only because i needed something to do between raids
---
No way. You need the follow-up zone too. Teldrassil, Darkshore, Barrens, Mulgore, Durotar, Westfall, Elwynn, Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, Tirisfal Glades, Silverpine Forest and Redridge Mountains all *must* have layering IMO.
---
Because from then on the path leads to significant splits and questing becomes more sporadic / the population at this point are at all 4 corners of Azeroth that's when it's a great time to disable layering. Ashenvale, Thousand Needles, Stranglethorn, etc that's when layering is no longer needed.
---
How do you even know sharding is what "fixed" launch day crashes.
---
I know this is always a problem with any version of WoW when you don't log out "properly", like a disconnect. It will only use your last properly saved UI. Perhaps there's an issue with your relogging?
---
Then dont play
---
The auto attack bound to 1 is what really did it for me. Oh how far we’ve come.
---
I agree.  As much as we can question some of the game design decisions made at Blizzard in the past 5 or so years, they definitely know how to run a game.
---
Yeah you’re mad. Hate to spoil it friend, but if you thought these were funny you have a low bar for humor.
---
“Idiot virgin” 😂
---
I think pally/lock combo would legit be amazing
---
Yes. Kappa is a funny word, as is poggers and WeirdChamp. But nobody uses it in the way you just said except in chat. People won’t use the add on as much as you think because it doesn’t really make sense outside of a stream chat to be spammed. They’re mainly reaction emotes to a streamer because that moves so fast nobody bothers to write a sentence - hence why there not used in smaller streams as much. 
---
A lot of you are over thinking this. It’s an extension to legit just make a word an emote. The same way :) turns to a face on Skype or Discord (unless disabled). Fuck me.
---
I don't agree with the assessment of the person you're replying to, but in modern WoW server architecture all subzones are virtualized. There is no single continent server like in Vanilla, where if someone is in Westfall then Eastern Plaguelands has to be instantiated. Zones can shut down and spin up as needed. Dead realms might be less efficient, generally, but the degree of that inefficiency is minor, and unlikely to be a significant cost savings.
---
The main purpose of sharding/layering is to let people play with their friends at launch without having queues, and then in the future avoid having free server transfers or empty dead realms. It's primarily about keeping communities together.
---
Sometimes man there are no more bosses to kill in the game and you just play your alt because the goose is not loose.
---
Sever merging or dynamic spawning
---
A lot of people dont bind their HS and you have a .5 sec window to use it to be perfectly immune, and when a Paladin misses that and you stop it, that is the best feeling ever.
---
Man, this hits so close to home. Thanks for posting this man! You said it well.
---
No because that would make them have to delay launch. Like it or not we are getting this version of layering. It will be nice to have less pressure for tags at launch and eventually the servers won’t need layering and we can put this all behind us.
---
you didn't respond to me before I wrote the message above to you. you had already been responding everyone else for 2 hours but whatever.   
---
we don't have much to talk about if this is the extend of your analytical abilities, Idk man. sounds like you made this threat to parrot "crossrealms = dungeon finder" and you're not actually interested in discussion
---
Wtf kinda attitude is that? Each side has immature players
---
Man it's not a 20 min difference
---
I also want to bet you that layering isnt gone in 2 weeks and that you have too much faith in blizz. You realize the guys in charge now aren't the dude who made classic right? They're the dudes so bad at game design they created a chore list out of an MMORPG
---
We really need to see at 60, because I doubt someone would have been willing to dig through a thousand different vanilla videos to get accurate values for level 15 bear form.
---
Sure, I have an idea. Fix the bugs in the layering system before launch. It doesn't need an alternative. They should fix the system they spent time developing.
---
This, they know players who complain about layering will still play after its removed (hopefully sooner than later), but [new] players who cannot play at launch (assuming no layering) may not make it to the same potential time/date mark. 
---
I still think Blizz should some how make it so only the first starting zones are layerd. I know barrens and westfall may not be ideal but at that point I am pretty sure players know if they're gonna stick with the game or not. Remember, for a newb it takes hours to get out of elwyn/durotar/tirisfal/mulgore/Dunmurogh.
---
So why bring up the recent expansions?
---
Also, the private servers don't just suddenly have 12k players trying to log in for a hard launch, and have all those players in starting zones at the same time.
---
Copying from another thread: People saying it will be removed early are misguided I think. Blizzard already backtracked and said it might last all of Phase 1 or 2 which are each weeks to months long. The population will still be too high then and this will probably be left in even longer.
---
Feels bad :(
---
34 here, i feel ya though
---
The entire fucking server in Hellfire? The entire fucking server was in the login screen.
---
Layering needs some strict rules otherwise it will ruin the entire game.
---
- You should not be able to chance layer while in combat.
---
- A players entire ACCOUNT has to be asigned to a single layer.
---
- Places like stv arena, world bosses and capital cities should only have one layer.
---
- If you are in a guild, everyone in that guild should be asigned to the same layer.
---
- Everyone on your friendslist should be asigned to the same layer within reason.
---
- People that you have played with in the past should be asigned to the same layer as you.
---
Obviously these types of rules wont be 100% enforcable because they clash with each other. Maybe one of your best friends plays in a guild that is asigned to a different layer and as such his guild should take precedence over being in layer with you. But we NEED these types of rules and especially the first 4 I listed should be super important because it will fucking ruin the game if we dont get them.
---
Go to skull rock and prepare to have your crap pushed in if you aggro more than one mob.  Even the casters with the voidwalkers can be tough.
---
Yeah, I almost got baited into resubbing... I don't know why they troll the hell out of us with the naming.
---
Yep :)
---
Yes you can, in theory, add an extra clause in the layer picking code that says if level &gt; 30 then shard = 1, no matter what other shard the character or global setting currently is. Problem solved.
---
It does not save money on server costs.  They still need the hardware to run all the layers.  What it does is it prevents having to do server mergers in a month or two when there will be a big player dropoff.
---
Obviously I can not predict the future but, my experience having played wow on private servers for many moons. Shamans are always in high demand and, theres never enough Shamans.
---
Therein lies the problem. They’re guessing at how much the activity will die down. Even if it drops 50% from 10k to 5k after 2 weeks to 2 months, that’s still a 5k population of people wanting to play the game.
---
Is that when they open up RPPvP servers and say, “here you go, everybody who wants it, say goodbye to this bloated server and start a new community”? Or do they just put a hard cap of 3.5K and have people wait in queues? Neither are ideal solutions, but I’d prefer waiting in a queue over playing in a layered game.
---
RemindME! August 15, 2019
---
&gt; I would rather everyone have a shitty experience than risk someone getting an extra peacebloom spawn over me!
---
FTFY
---
Yes. I needed to group up with the people I was dueling because of this. For retrieving their position, I had to reference them as a party member instead of as my target, because there is a unit ID that can be referenced for each party member.
---
Yup was in durotar pretty much every group had a single mob or two they were camping just to complete quests.
---
Sharding/layering has as much to do with WotLK phasing as WotLK phasing has to do with dungeon instances. 'Phasing' as a general concept was introduced in the game launch with the fact that you've got a ton of people in the same map, eg Wailing Caverns, fighting different instances of the same mob.
---
Sharding, the idea of dynamic instancing of the open world for load balancing purposes, was introduced in Mists of Pandaria.
---
Disarm is usually the first thing I do after the initial charge. I guess you could try and tidal charm/nade from the start and try to get some damage out before the inevitable disarm. I never like blowing cooldowns like that really early.
---
Gonna be a good old fashioned gold rush for those of us who go way too hard in the first couple of weeks and ding 60 early. The world bosses shall be reaped for all their plunder!!
---
thanks for the tip i might play just that
---
Phasing was a thing in vanilla as well, it's called dungeons.
---
I don’t know what that is or what I’m doing incorrectly.
---

---
If the layering is still in effect a couple of weeks after release, then please start complaining at that time. Shit talking Blizzard about it now is absolutely meaningless.  
---
I too have very little trust for Activision Blizzard at this point, but all the effort that has gone into this amazing release is enough for me.
---
Seriously...layering seems all kind of messed up this time around. I hop onto the stress test and there are a ton of people talking in Stormwind...Yet after running around for about 10 minutes I see a total of 3 people. It feels really bad when you log on and you know people are there but you don't see them.
---
The best way to get the right answer on the internet is to post the wrong answer.
---
So if you don't want to deal with it then just wait a few days or a week and level then. Having a smooth level experience on launch is just stupid. I literally leveled 1-15 last night on stress basically completely solo and saw no one after like like 7. It was horseshit.
---
I spend at least an hour reading this thread every week even though I’ve mained Warlock since 2007 and will continue to do so in Classic
---
you could always give BRD a right good go, if you are a mage and a healer! AOE everything down :D
---
Are you saying thousands of thousands of private server players over the past 15 years just didnt bother to google the stats?
---
You have to be an idiot if you think people havent tried. There's just not a lot of data from back then.
---
Prot paladins are a design flaw too, may as well change them if that is your mindset.
---
Thanks! That really means a lot!
---
I brought up the recent expac's because the fellow I was replying to was comparing Classic launch to what Vanilla/TBC launches were like. The biggest pservers do have 10k-15k all logging in at launch. Watch what happens this Saturday on Silver Hand launch. 12k+ all logging in the same time into the starting zones. Dynamic spawns help everyone finish their quests and your out of the starting zone in an hour.
---
Yeah we are gonna go alliance for once. I was gonna do NE priest but dwarves just seem like they got it all. I made a female dwarf as a test and i got used to get so I'm gonna stick with dwarf I guess.
---
All this tech is the exact same tech as phasing. It's nothing new.
---
You know that a company realizes something is horrible and poisonous when they have to keep giving it new names to try to avoid pissing people off.
---
First it was phasing, then it was sharding, and now it's layering.
---
Yup, keep changing that name, assholes! I'm sure you can trick a lot of ignorant people.
---
I completely agree that leveling through dungeons has the potential to be the fastest way to level. I’ve spent a considerable amount of time planning a leveling route primarily through dungeons with triple fire mage+prot pally+resto Druid. With a heavily optimized group like this  I’m almost certain dungeons are the way to go all the way to 60.
---
then maybe,  just maybe  they shouldnt be fucking playing classic
---
I used both, I think ecb came out sooner
---
Personally, I think more realms is a bad idea. After the hype dies down I don't want to be rolling the dice on having a dead server and I really doubt Blizzard wants "Blizzard Already Shutting Down Classic Servers" headlines everywhere a few weeks after launch. I don't know if layering is the best answer, but just throwing up more realms is a horrible alternative (in my opinion.)
---
Imagine intentionally lying about shit because you hate private servers :D
---
IF it lasts for 2 weeks. They haven’t said that it *absoltely will*, and they’ve floated the idea of having Phase 2 as a deadline. Which means they’re keeping their promises loose and vague, since Phase 2, Dire Maul and Honor, could easily come 3 months after launch.
---
If the hype doesn’t die as fast as they think it will, it’s not absurd to think they’ll extend it past two weeks.
---
How can you fix something that is working as intended ? 
---
It’s the feature itself that is stupid
---
They aren't going to do that- because that would restrict playing with friends (which is their only concern at launch)
---
You set your graphics to classic it looks like it does on the private servers the closest thing to the 2004 graphics.
---
its not that bad honestly
---
The game won't be an empty void with layering like retail. The whole point of them doing layering instead of sharding is to prevent that. If they turn off layering outside of the starter zones you'll have people fading in and out of existence when moving from zone to zone, which would be like sharding.
---
If they were to scrap layering altogether there would be multiple hour-long queues to login, massive server instability, performance degradation, and it would take forever to complete quests and kill mobs with thousands of people trying at the same time. I'm all for struggling a little bit and having to work with people to complete goals but this goes far beyond that.
---
Layering should stay active continent-wide for the first 2-4 weeks.
---
I may be a non purist, so sue me, but it doeant bother me as long as it's gone within a week or two.
---
If you want a game with a cap higher than what the game was designed for, go play a pserver. No changes mate.
---
 I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
---
Looking at either Shaman or Priest, primarily as healer. I will be playing solo most of the time, likely joining random groups for PVP and PVE unless I find a good guild. Main focus will be on PVP healing. Both have a good off spec for PVP DPS, so not too worried on that side. Who would be a better fit based on that criteria?
---
Ah yeah that's it I think... I wasn't paying attention to this stress test because I'm in EU, so I figured why would they invite me? But they did invite me because I have an NA account that I barely ever used and forgot about, so they flagged that one for the stress test I guess. Oh well, back to waiting...
---
Thanks. I definitely feel pulled in different directions. I think I’ll dabble in modern WoW and see how I like it. 
---
Did I make you upset?
---
if one person abused it, then surely a second, third and fourth person would see value to abuse it in the same way.  soon tens of people would compete with each other and realistically they couldn't access more server shards than there are players online in their server.  
---
logically if there are enough shards to support the player population, the materials needed to supply a higher population would also have to grow, or else there would be a scarcity.
---
Expect 75+ Ms latency. Maybe even 100
---
You think you want it but you don't.
---
I keep thinking that I want to roll pally but then remember that I don't want to be staring at heal bars while raiding. It's a shame ret/prot aren't viable or I would roll one in an instant.
---
No, this is not a good solution. Nor are the hundred other posts like this.
---
Windfurry only gets good once you do. Get some damage first, then try and do.... damage.
---
You know that layering isn't meant to solve the issue of quests in starter zones, it is meant to smooth out population decline over a period of time. It's disappointing how many people like you keep saying the wrong thing tbh
---
I have not seen a damage comparison between the two games at level 60. Have you?
---
Forms scale as you level up, just like a bunch of other skills do in Classic. Private servers are likely to have put more care and effort into how skills behave at level 60. Not at level 15 and level 40.
---
Is it possible the numbers are still off at 60? Ofcourse. But dont make assumptions ahead of time.
---
this topic has been discussed to death
---
You mean like 400 people don't want to play on a server like that. It's a self-selecting non-representative sample. You can't extrapolate anything from it.
---
This is a worse hell than the walk to the logging town East of GoldShire.
---
Yes, but my thoughts were more along the initial zones 1-5
---
&gt; That’s a pretty massive difference and why I’m not against layering, but despise sharding.
---
I'd much rather they did the starter zone sharding than world-wide layering. Even then, I don't want that either, but it's significantly better.
---
imagine trying to double down on being dumb, oof.
---
Intent: test stress on the servers.  
---
Execution: run stress test during window of time when *there would be a high likelihood of few people being on*  
---
Result: servers weren't stressed  
---
People aren't complaining that it was a sucky time to stress test the servers because they personally wouldn't be able to play, they are complaining because **timing it during work hours does not benefit the activity of testing the servers**.  
---
This isn't an issue of " me me me," it's an issue of scheduling an activity to fit the intent of the test.  
---
As a tester, you schedule your day around when you need to complete specific activities, you don't work a normal day and then say "oh look, I'm supposed to **also** test this evening." No overtime involved, it involves shifting hours.
---
You can change the water, that's what really matters
---
It's not about speed, I'm a pretty slow leveler, I level up professions at the same time as my toon.
---
The point is I don't want to be waiting for shit to spawn the entire time. I want to actually play the game and not camp spawns because there are too many ppl
---
I was specifically asked by my guild to join their MC runs to soak gear because they only had 1 other druid. They wanted warlocks too.
---
Kink shaming *IS* my kink.
---
The Rend set is a slight upgrade/sidegrade to Dawn's Edge.
---
10hours Queue was part of the experience. No changes :)
---
Usually bleeds or dots won't break fear. But yeah I think your fear is really the only tool to wait out the disarm duration, or somehow getting gap and sitting in intercept dead zone.
---
Gotta be careful to not get caught out of berserker stance.
---
Because in a game where pulling two mobs means trouble and pulling three mobs means death, having faster mob respawns is a really bad idea.
---
First and foremost, I don't think it's best to "trust" or care about company. No business needs your "trust", not even CD project red, whom I see put on a pedestal by a lot of gamers. Or whomever other game developer is really liked.
---
Second, they should start making good games again. BfA is not my cup of tea. Where is another Diablo? Another Starcraft? Another anything? A new IP? Hello? What full game have they put out in the last couple of years? I can't remember.
---
Granted, I think it's just the industry at the moment. It's far more profitable to just make DLC than an actual game, isn't it? Or better yet, why not slide some of that DLC out of the way for a moment.. then polish it off later, and charge more?
---
Good.
---
Dude, you're coming at this guy really hard for him just not wanting to completely waste his time getting to level 3 in 2 hours...
---
Quit TELLING others what the "vanilla experience" should be for them. Everyone will experience it in their own way likely completely different than yours, and that's okay. That doesn't mean they're going to scream for changes, I have no idea how you make that connection. Calm down.
---
All right Mr. L337 speaking gamer dad we’ll get off your lawn
---
Or why not wait 2 weeks, since you won’t be playing much anyways, if you’re time is too valuable to have a less than perfect grinding simulator to play?
---
Great tip! I’ve been adding some people as battle net friends so I can hopefully find them again when the game launches.
---
A unique stance that the community is why you’re wanting to come back but you don’t intend to ever play with said community o.O
---
Yea he’s sure you freak!! Who wants to see a half erect penis? Fully erect or get the fuck out.
---
That would explain it, I was just confused because I'm in EU so I wasn't expecting an invite to the stress test, but I forgot I had an old NA account I never used that must've been flagged for it, so that's why it appeared on my client.
---
Druid+rogue is a great combo for 2manning stuff.
---
Dynamic respawns was introduced into future private servers, didn't have em with Nostalrius's 10k launch. No vanilla private server ever had group quest loot, the only one that implemented it was Gummy's TBC server which was shut down the same day it was released and re-released later.
---
I hope you guys have fun but I don’t think you should neglect 5 mans if you have time I know a couple of hours for deadlines or WC sucks but you can make some friends for those rare times you both have time to play.
---
&gt; No way in Hell blizz would allow the servers to crash 
---
I think the difference here is that I think they WOULD allow servers to crash.  Just like adding back spell batching and bugs they removed after classic.  I think that they will say "AQ gates are coming next phase, servers will crash, tough shit this is how it was in 2006".  Layering and server crashes are both bad.  At launch server crashes is the greater of the two evils, and on AQ gates event, it will be layering so they'll allow server crashes.
---
Ok so if they post it enough the game *really will die*
---
Good one.
---
you think 1337 meant something to people not familiar with internet speak? You just don't know the memes anymore
---
Please elaborate there chief instead of just shitting on someone without any facts.
---
I can launch it (EU) but I get the "need active subscription" error after I pick a realm.
---
"Just wait until the game is ruined before complaining"
---
I don't know for you, but for me, I discovered Twitch like ...2 months ago. I seriously don't have any idea what all those word mean and I just find it irritating to try to read chat and seing hundred of PoggerPoggerPogger.
---
And yeah, I don't see emote on my twitch but the constant spamming irritate me none the less.
---
I think the reason Stormwind was empty is due to fresh realm &amp; level 15 cap.  As you realized, you get sent there for a quest which people seem to complete about level 8-10; and once more at level 10.  Those are the only reasons you'd ever need to go Stormwind on this stress test.
---
When it's live of course, you'll have people using the bank, the auction house, focusing on their professions a bit more so there's more "reasons to be there" and of course it really gets busy when people start hitting level cap and are socializing instead of XPing.
---
Back on my Vanilla server, Stormwind wasn't actually the busiest town.  Still, that's something else for you to discover another time :)
---
It was a pleasure reading your experiences, I'm jealous you get to experience this with fresh eyes!
---
How? How would you know how much people would be on each server? Without that information I can't see how you would plan that.
---
The cost of developing this technology was borne a decade ago when they introduced CRZ. The current development is just modifying it slightly.
---
Sorry, I was referring to the big nerf that came in just before BC and I think I got the version number wrong. Maybe it was 1.12.2?
---
It's a lesser effect though isn't it? I think you just get a pet bar.
---
&gt;That makes sense for them taking no other variables into consideration than their own working hours, but it is not great for actually having a stress test.
---
The stress test start time is literally 1 hr before the game will actually launch on august 27/26.  Seems like a great time to start a test for their server tech to prepare for launch conditions to me!
---
Damn bro, that’s super wrong
---
Just deal with it until it passes. It is literally a first week only problem. Layering is a game ruining problem.
---
and what happens when there is 3200 people online? You are going to have a capped layer and a layer of 200 people. It is going to feel pretty bad for those 200 people. I ran across this on the current beta. Was in a layer that was a literal ghost town.  It would be better if the layer was a little bit more scalable to balance out the population into equal layers.
---
You can 2man BRD with druid+rogue, hell a good rogue can solo about half of it.
---
As long as I can kill my 50 bears from level 1-5, I don’t care if the entire 1-60 experience, with PvP, rares, community interactions, and gathering is changed. So long as my 1-5 is optimally Grindy.
---
I know it was magical
---
I got a grey two hand sword, I was so excited to go train swords on my pally lol
---
The guy was suggesting you have enough separate severs so that over population isn't an issue. Then consolidate servers if their pop becomes too low. They did this in mop and I think it worked well. Although a lot of people disliked that characters had the server name included in their character name.
---
Not a bug but I know the naming filter is not working.
---
I got the name, "Wrinklyballs." By all means if this is allowed, awesome. Someone else got the name, "Lilclit."
---
Swing and a miss. More like if they (Blizz) think if it will affect their bottom line they'll remove it
---
20 players to tag one mob defines Classic? Because I honestly don't remember having to compete that much for a mob back when Vanilla was released (at least in EU).
---
At least I have some sort of written account of my first experiences. If I ever forget what it was like, I’ll check this thread again. 
---
I always miss that in other games I’ve played.
---
Barrens is also barrens so it's always gunna be extremely busy there. 
---
Also , PS arent accurate as they are global, regional servers will have a daily cycle of population trends, sometimes 4 AM server time on a PS is 7-10 pm in the US, there's never any downtime on popular PS
---
Not a legit comparison imo, outside starting zone would be fine imo
---
I'd say it's closer to 4 months for your average player to hit 60. There is a lot of content. Even in 4 months, you might only run each dungeon once and see half of the levelling zones.
---
Getting multiple classes/races to 60 turns into a multi-year commitment pretty quickly.
---
For what it's worth, paladin is considered to be the slowest class to level (hunter and mage are the quickest). Paladin is really built for group play and struggles with solo play.
---
As I said,
---
"Basically it's like a language I can't read being posted on my /2 all day."
---
And no one typed in fucking leetspeak in /2. They might throw out one or two words, but I'd argue there's still a difference because one you know that l337 means elite, you get it. You can tell me that pog refers to an image of some guy, and I still don't get the context of how it's used. you have to be more steeped in that culture to understand the images themselves, than you do to understand a smattering of leetspeak--and we're taking it one step further, where you dont even see the images, you see the shortcodes for the images.
---
so you have a point, but I don't think it's a 1:1 correlation here
---
Nah I'd definitely prefer queues. I'm willing to wait a couple of extra days if I can at least feel the confident the game won't be bad. I don't require instant gratification.
---
Overpopulated starting areas? Not only do I not care, I'd actually be looking *forward* to it. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not interesting in solo grinding quests and whining about competition. I'd probably spend the first few days doing silly MMO stuff like exploring the world or raiding an enemy town.
---
Dead realms? Yeah that sucks, but there's a pretty obvious solution to this: Server merging. And before you chirp up about the complications of renaming character and guilds, that's already been discussed to death. The servers could just be pre-planned similar to how layers *should* work.
---
Out of all options, layering is absolutely the worst.
---
Better yet, by default have layered servers and then mark some 'non-layered' for those of us who want the authentic experience.
---
I’m not tech savvy, but they could likely very easily make it work so that there are large shards that work like layering, for the starting 1-25 zones. As it is now, it’s continent based, but I doubt that solution is beyond Blizzards capabilities.
---
this is basically what majority of wow players will experience on launch, except a portion of players will be reluctant to spend time on a character that is not their main in BFA.
---
1-15 in 30 smashes any speed leveling records.
---
Hey you enjoy westfall lmao I will be 17 before you finish the mech reaper quest OMEGAlul
---
Having already been 60 by the time the feral patch was out, I haven't been able to really comment on leveling with a 1.12 build, but I keep seeing all these videos from private server gaming personalities talk about how great feral is (gotta say the "you can clear MC in blues" has given me pause*), and it really makes look sideways at the commentary.
---
*Or the response to raid boss hit/defense tables. "What? 14% parry? That's wrong! On private servers it's 5%! Oh well, that won't change anything." The fuck it won't.
---
So I've never played vanilla before so I've been trying out different classes on private servers to get a feel for them. 
---
I've brought myself down from warlock, mage,priest and rogue to just mage and priest. 
---
I think shadow priests are really cool and fun. I always enjoyed being a hybrid for pvp and I always loved it in pve as well. 
---
I plan on doing both pvp and pve.
---
What is the main difference between priest and mage in pvp and pve? 
---
I would be willing to priest heal in pve. I think that would be a fun break from spriest pvp all the time. The mage control seems so fun in pvp though. However, I've heard mage in pve hits 1 button. 
---
I'm trying to play both pve and pvp heavily. I am going to be faily committed with 5hrs of play on weekdays and 6 hours or more on weekends so I dont know if the 10g respec will be a problem for raiding on my priest. 
---
What do you guys think about priest and mage playstyle in both pve and pvp? And gameplay mechanics that I'm missing that someone could shed some light on? Let me know!!
---
Can someone explain to me what this does? I don’t understand what’s even happening besides having multiple characters.
---
&gt; I think the difference here is that I think they WOULD allow servers to crash
---
Well there is no need to discuss this further. You clearly don't know why layering/sharding tech was put to use in the first place.
---
There's two hidden Goblin vendors that well limited quantity engineering plans. One in STV and one in Hinterlands. The STV one requires wall jumping to reach.   
---
They aren't the only limited quantity vendors, but they are two that were obscure/hidden.
---
Yes, blizzard have thought about it that's why they want to use layering.
---
&gt; servers will just crash over and over. 
---
So it will be the authentic classic experience.  This would be preferable to everyone over layering.
---
Oooh. That’s a good tip. I hope I can level each class quick enough. I wish there was more time! 
---
If the server is populated enough (aka more than 3000 people) to require more than one layer then it's populated enough for demand to keep up with the increased supply.
---
Same here, i dont know why ppl are thrashtalking MoP, it has really great raids, awesome scenery, great PVP balance, and have a lot of content overall.
---
Almost every single word in the English language is derived from another word, sometimes from another language.
---
Interactions with 'Kappa' has less meaning that onomatopoeia. Loan words, or existing words that have had their very meaning completely upended, which have not been accepted into traditional linguistic use, are called slang. For example, see https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dude -- it very much has origins, but there are slang uses for it.
---
I don't like slang, but it still isn't all that bad. But there is an entire tier of language that's even lower than slang, and it's called *-speak. 
---

Leetspeak/Twitch-speak etc are memetic languages that work as cultural 'inside jokes'. They are used because they are meant to be inherently amusing, despite the fact that they, inherently, have no meaning. They are amusing because its users have arbitrarily *decided* that it is amusing.
---
I think you need to pull more arbitrary numbers out of your ass
---
Not quite true, some classes can solo a fair few lvl 60 dungeon bosses (+ the trash leading up to them). Hunter is the easiest one. It takes some effort though.
---
I has this and I turned down anti aliasing
---
/camp
---
There you go blizzard! Layering is digital rBGH!
---
Rogues over your main offtank? Ehhh, idk about that. Not to mention if you plan on killing 4 horsemen you need 8 well geared tanks. Each thunderfury on a tank= more threat persecond = DPS can push and kill boss faster. If the boss dies faster than healers are less stressed/less time for a wipe from mistakes. 
---
Each thunderfury on a rogue is..... Slightly better DPS than other bis weps until Naxx. 
---
Kinda doesn't seem worth it really.
---
Ah yes. If only they were as intelligent as you. The enlightened redditor.
---
Replay WC3 :)
---
It’s saying pretty much 1-10, and 1-20 zones. That is where the largest bottleneck will be.
---
it is literally 1hr before the actual launch of the actual game on august 26/27.  To me, that is accurate to people that can and can't attend.
---
It's not working as intended. They didn't intend for it to be abused for griefing or to break active quests.
---
I played last night and I couldn’t tag a mob in Northshire Abby to save my life so I just farmed mobs in Goldshire. It took a while but once I got to level 3 it wasn’t hard. 
---
You don’t *have* to do the intro quests. It doesn’t have to be so linear.  Life finds a way.
---
Think you need to learn some manners, cunt.
---
Did they get mad?  Honestly they were extremely prepared.  It is way better for them to be over-prepared at this point.
---
Thanks for contributing to the discussion...
---
If you mine a node, you can just hop to all the other layers to mine it 10 times. That's definitely a problem.
---
The quests in Westfall will lead you to the dungeon in Westfall. There's quite a bit of travel involved, but there's some good lore as well.
---
Be careful in Moonbrook!
---
Cataclysm was the last expansion I "enjoyed". I had some huge problems with it, but it still retained enough things from the "holy trilogy" for me to stick around most of the time. The class changes and the overhaul of the world and questing were the lasting things which I reflect on negatively. 
---
MoP is the expansion where I started spending more time unsubscribed than subscribed. The talent changes and class homogenization really didn't work for me. While the graphics and art were great as always, I didn't enjoy the theme, story, pandas or the sillier aspects (beer elementals, goofy looking rabbit mouse things, jokey nonsense like the hozen thinking he was in love with an undead, etc.). WoD tried to dial back on some of this, but the gameplay changes and lack of content meant that it was a disaster. 
---
I also haven't enjoyed Legion or BfA due to their continuing use of or reiteration on systems introduced in MoP and WoD, namely the excessive number of raid/dungeon difficulties, class homogenization, lack of true specialization customizing, the mission table and world quests (a Legion feature). Artifacts felt absolutely stupid to me. While the Heart of Azeroth isn't quite as dumb, since you're not the one millionth person wielding the same Ashbringer, there is no customization, as you'll end up unlocking everything anyway. I don't like the removal or tier sets or titan forging. I don't know what was wrong with the gearing models from the first four expansions.
---
Yeah I don't get it.  It's just spam. Spam emotes or spam stupid shit like POG or poggers over and over.
---
I'm an enterprise software engineer. No such thing as modifying 10 year old technology slightly. Back then everything was running on dedicated native hardware, today everything is about virtualization and putting your application into linux containers so they can run on IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and scale properly, and more importantly allocate hardware resources dynamically.
---
It has always been all zones, its a full world copy.  
---
The issue is people can change layers at will with group invites.
---
Hopefully they will limit how you can change layers, or the game shrinks fast enough to remove it. 
---
Or split the layers when it gets to the deadline, and you are stuck on that layer in a new server called Illidan-Layer2 or whatever.
---
Thanks! I ran through all of Stormwind but didn’t interactive the NPC’s. So much to do!
---
Squishy cloth but also no, they need peels eventually, or against a gangbang but they are not ultra squish due to shield, armour buffs and procs.
---
I'll be proving that come classic as I run around bgs :) I won't have a perfect PvP spec though since I plan on doing pve tho and running a spec for both (pve spec with like 2 or 3 changes works wonders it just lacks a few passive procs)
---
Dude. If you want to be the top DPS, follow the established guides. Your own conjecture won't get you anywhere without months of research.
---
\*Laughs in Aspect of the Cheetah\*
---
&gt;"Completely waste his time getting to level 3 in 2 hours..." 
---
This right here is exactly how I'm making the connection. You both seem to subscribe to the idea that the only thing to do in the game from the start is level until you're 60, and if your time isnt spent leveling in the most efficient way possible then its wasted. It is exactly that mentality in a growing number of the playerbase that caused blizzard to make the initial changes to the game that have culminated in BFA, where the game before level 120 is literally meaningless in every way. 
---
By the way, calm down.
---
The word shill has lost all meaning. Now it means 'person who disagrees with me on why company is bad".
---
This is definitely a better solution for low level zones.
---
Yes but you can still dunk on PvE players using disarm. They are not going to replace their DPS enchant for a weapon chain.
---
T
---
The truth is more insidious than that. They never had any intention of removing it and are simply liars who've come to the cynical realization that it's more convenient to lie to your customers than admit the truth. And they're right. It's easier to LIE and sucker people and then move the goal post down the road than it is to be honest from the beginning.
---
Phasing was ALWAYS a fucking cop out. The entire POINT of MMOs is persistence. I remember when a lot of actual MMO players criticized WOW when it first came out because they didn't like the fact that it even had instances for dungeons/raids/PVP, and it's a solid criticism, really. WOW's level of persistence was already on shaky ground given that every dungeon/raid/battleground is instanced, but once you throw in phasing/sharding/"layering," there is absolutely no integrity left. The bottom line is that Blizzzard never really solved any of the difficult technical problems involved in actually making a massive persistent world work. All they've done is partition players into increasingly smaller boxes.
---
Let's reduce the size of raids. Let's phase the shit out of everything. Let's put more shit on the GCD so that we can gate network traffic more. Let's pull back from flying because the increased player speed puts more strain on server resources. 
---
Every major decision they'd made has been based around penny pinching on server resources and not actually making the game fun.
---
There hasn't been anything "massive" about this supposed MMO in over a decade. Even your average Quake clone supports 64 player multiplayer over the internet. How fucking laughable is it that an MMO is smaller than some random first person shooter?
---
Activision (and I say Activision because Blizzard ceased to exist in 2008) is a joke and should not be patronized.
---
I died four times. And had two groups form to complete random world quests.   
---
That's more deaths and more random world PUG groups in two hours of Classic play than I've had leveling in the last three expansions combined. Nuff' said.
---
Im sorry everyone, but what is layering? Is it when players go into different phases for quests?
---
Thanks, man! Gotta get them shoulder pads.
---
yes, both were severely under represented during that era.  I think around TBC more people started going druid lock, because they were gods in arena.
---
Don't judge the game too much on stress test. You'll be in and out of the capital cities frequently and with layering you won't see too many people but after release you'll be complaining about the swarms of people blocking mailboxes and the AH in no time
---
I was trying to decide between Mage and Hunter. I played Mage in vanilla so I’m leaning towards Hunter to try something new(and they have the Hunter quest for the bow which I’d like to do). But then I see Shaman and really like the whole communing with the elements background and think I might go for that. Still not decided lol.
---
Server merges are way worse than anything from layering. People should be asking for fixes to stop OP's examples from happening, not saying "well a couple problems were found, scrap the whole thing!"
---
I’m 90% sure that the warrior fear breaks from any damage, but I might be wrong.
---
Bye Felicia, don't play Classic. :)
---
Layering *is* sharding.
---
Upvoted so people stop FREAKING OUTTTTTTTTT AHHHHHY LAYERINGGGG
---
Made me lol ty
---
What is layering exactly?
---
You got some sauce for that bruh? We don't really have any idea how either sharding OR layering works.
---
Thanks! I’m loving it so far,
---
how is a realm different from a server?  it is a different server that will die of under population as soon as the next AAA game releases.
---
Only a handful of people will use the first few weeks exploiting the layers, the rest of us normal people will be leveling.
---
Let them waste their time, we can go back and gank the shit out of them when we're 60 and they're not.
---
So I’ve decided my main will be a Warlock, but I’m trying to min-max slightly with the racials. 
---
From what I understand, the best Warlock bonuses come from:
---
- Undead with the shadow damage bonus
---
- Orc with the pet damage bonus 
---
- Gnomes with some kind of stat bonus 
---
Which race would be best for early-tier raiding as a lock once I ding 60? Which would be best if I decided to focus on PvP?
---
If they removed layering, I'd gain an enormous of trust because it shows they are willing to listen to the community on big issues.
---
I really disliked the talent system overhaul, ability pruning and class homogenization. As I also didn't like the theme, setting or the story, MoP is the expansion where the game really started to decline for me.

Are you serious? Have you tried doing the starting quests on the stress server? 20 players to tag one mob is a conservative estimate, and that's taking into consideration that the stress test only has people who are subbed to the game, on launch the number of players will be much greater.
---
&gt;(lol @ the idea of soloing the lyceum) 
---
Doable as hunter :)
---
Probably rogue too? I haven't tried that one.
---
I hit level two (lol) and logged off.  I've been playing since vanilla myself and have never done pservers.  I didn't want to "ruin" my experience in August/September anymore.  I may look at some leveling guides for general direction which zones to go to where but i'm trying to go into it completely clean like it was for me when I was 13. 
---
My two most favorite takeaways:
---
\- music / sounds were amazing 
---
\- Non instant quest text.  Somewhere along the way I must have put on instant quest text.  It was cool to see the text slowly typed out.  I'm gonna keep this for launch and read quests like I never have before
---
&gt;You clearly don't know why layering/sharding tech was put to use in the first place.
---
Youve said this three times, why not just explain it.  The first time I noticed sharding was in wotlk when it was used for zones that changed as you quested through them.  How does this relate to AQ gates.
---
Why are does my “blatant trolling” anger you so much?  Just ignore me then lol 
---
Struck a nerve with you or something.
---
Layering is the whole world. Sharding is different areas of the world.
---
Paladin is noob friendly class, because it's very simple. Paladin learns some useful buffs and utility for the allies, but personally I don't recommend play that class EVER. If you feel like support is your preferred role then try a priest.
---
Except people are more likely to take time off for actual launch, than for the stress test ;)
---
You’d have my signature 100%. We understand *why* Blizzard wants Layering, and how it can be beneficial to the health of the server in the long term. However, layering the entire 1-60 experience is antithetical to Vanilla, *AND IS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THEIR INITIAL PLAN* of just using sharding for starting zones.
---
Play a different game man. Not even being an ass here. If you just want to play with your brother there are way better options... that being said, your other option is to just play WoW right and group up with people. What are you up to where you don’t have an hour to sit down and do something the entire time??  You will compete 0 content as a two man at 60, that’s just not a thing. They were designed for three more people.
---
The day they announced layering they said it might stay active until phase 2. How is that backtracking?
---
Put down the koolaid
---
In shadowglen for the first hour it took up to 5 mins standing by an npc to turn in a completed quest or to vend things. (Classic 3)

There is literally *zero* chance of abusing layering in the way he describes. *At best* all you can do is log in and out in hopes of being place into a new layer.
---
Thank you. I am glad. These anti-layering people are trying to gatekeep the game at this point. I spent an hour trying to kill wolves and kobolds. I only got it done as group and was able to leave the Abbie. However if you go the questing route in Goldshire as a group you then hit a wall.  It's not longer kill quests but rather gathering quests and there is only one place to go. The alternative is to go solo and kill mobs to level. Idk. It seems to me that layering is necessary for the social experience. Otherwise you are off to resort on your own to get ahead.
---
Well, when the sky keeps falling, it's not that strange to think it'll keep happening.
---
Esfand and Asmon will find a way to defend this.
---
Why would anyone down vote this lol. I'm guessing those people didn't watch the clips that were posted.
---
you could decurse too right? pretty important for 2-3 bosses.  plus root and bear taunt can be key for garr depending on raid comp.

I cant tell you, its a secret
---
Servers crashed HARD during the vanilla AQ event and the shrieks were heard across the world, it's not going to be any better this time around without layering. Which even Blizz has stated that's why they don't do AQ like events anymore. The only reason you noticed it in wrath is because that's when they started using the tech. Absolutely no way in Hell they would let the servers crash now after seeing what happens without it, especially considering realm pops are 5x what they were in Vanilla.
---
Bruh I got an X-ray on my foot like every month when I was sick and had bone surgery like every 6 months
---
Literally a breed of cat. People ruin everything.
---
I knew I wanted to try it out when it released but I was shocked at how much fun I had playing with my buds. We played for 8 hours straight and got to level 10 and it was an absolute blast. Albeit the amount of people in the starting zones was a little frustrating but after I got out it really thinned out
---
&gt; I’m not tech savvy, but
---
You shouldn't make assumptions about whats possible given your admitted lack of expertise. I've literally never worked on a software project in my 24 years of experience where someone outside the project made a bunch of assumptions about what's possible then started demanding those possibilities be made real where said person was anything more than a nuisance.
---
You have literally no idea whats possible.
---
One problem is if everyone is smart about their GP they will save for a weapon drop (for example) to guarantee it. This sometimes means upgrades will get disenchanted since no one will roll on a neck or something since it's not a big upgrade compared to a weapon or trinket(or set bonus) and they rather save it. 
---
But the thing is probably some people won't know how the system works and will roll need on very minor upgrades wasting their GP(by wasting i mean increasing it a lot). So it won't be a problem for most guilds using it.
---
The other problem is if someone has a shit ton of EP(a hunter for example) can easily get a melee weapon that can be a huge upgrade for someone else in raid. System gives them the power to grieve or just fuck with people if they are a consistent raider. At that case I think they deserve to be an asshole if they want to but it's sure to cause guild drama.

---
After this last stress test I bet they don't even use it.
---
Undead don’t have a shadow damage bonus just a +10 shadow resistance. If you’re Horde play Orc and if Alliance then pick gnome for PvE.
---
So far nothing involving Classic has been any less than clear. They have spelled out in detail EXACTLY how they plan on doing many things, and never once went against that.
---
Ion was reporting this, but it seems Classic is being handled more loosely than live. There is almost zero reason to believe they will keep doing layering even though they said they wouldn't. I mean shit, he even gives an example of why they can't.
---
I saw an Asmongold clip where this exact thing was happening too, it's obviously something that has to be addressed somehow, though I don't have any idea how they are going to achieve it since their server tech is clearly here to stay.. But yeah it's very easy to exploit the system in a way that is exactly what people feared as a worse case scenario, it's very disruptive to gameplay and to the overall "single world" experience.
---
If you don't want to heal and only do damage then do not go Priest. Unless you want to PVP only then go Shadow.
---
Layering will be gone before honor exists.
---
Lmao.  The last one.  Pay someone to shit talk.  Hahaha.  Love it.  Thanks for this!
---
It can take 1-2 minutes for something to respawn, so your solution is completely leave the area and do something else? And then what? Go back a few hours later, kill 1 or 2 more things, then leave again?
---
we of the fel arts, prefer to get the most power from our minions by sacrificing them to the twisting nether.  in return we are granted a boon of power, which allows us to recruit another willing supplicant into the fold.
---
I would say any contested zone should not have it.
---
Just another nay-sayer telling people what they did or did not experience. Grow up.
---
Shut up and make me some water!
---
;)
---
There is definetly a level of projection going in with these layering posts. Who is sitting around trying to figure out any way possible to exploit a game so they can get ahead? I'm not concerned with these things at all and want to play and enjoy the game. If you think layering is bad because a few people might exploit it then dont be one of those people. If you think that small percentage of players who try and the even fewer who succeed will have such a huge advantage over you then just dont play cause it's unfair. 
---
Otherwise quit complaining and enjoy the game. The pros definetly out way the cons
---
That’s sharding, what about layering?
---
"but I don't want to fight more mobs...........WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
---
Because ‘sharding’ is a massive trigger word for alot of people on this sub. Launching with no answer to overcrowding is dumb.
---
No 88x31 pixel button announcing it works best with Netscape Navigator??
---
Layering should exist no where and having it on classic servers means blizzard has completely and totally failed to create classic.
---
Have already ran into moments on the beta where irl friends tried to find each other in the starting zone on the same server and it was impossible because they were on different "layers". Absolute failure of a system when put into an mmo.
---
Imo this is one of the absolutely most important things that should not be in classic. And I don't believe a word blizzard says when they say its temporary. 
---
Because we all know its going to be "Oh its only for two weeks" "Oh its only for the first phase" "Oh well its been in the game this long I don't see why we would remove it now". 
---
I would enjoy to experience the classic world of warcraft and not the classic example of a big gaming company lying to my face.
---
&gt;So, am I an asshole here? Am I a ninja Looter? Do I deserve a reputation smear? Do I deserve to be blacklisted?
---
Yes. 
---
If you joined the group on the terms laid out (hammer is his), benefitted from him forming the group and tanking the dungeon for you (he's probably a DPS warri as well who just tanks dungeons) and then broke the agreed upon terms by rolling (don't even need to win) on the item, you deserve to be called out on it. 
---
You openly displayed [in the hypothetical scenario] that your word cannot be trusted and I would not want you in my group. There is really no excuse for what you [hypothetically] did other than greed.
---
If you think the terms laid out by the party are unfair or stupid, don't joing the party. Easy as that. Their group, their effort in creating a group, their rules. 
---
There is really not much of a difference between stealing loot that you agreed on not taking or stealing enchanting mats after agreeing to use them to enchant the provider's gear with it. Nobody forces you to agree to rules - however stupid you may think they are - so if you do, adhere to them or live with the consequences of being labeled an untrustworthy liar.
---
On the plus side, such a system will ensure that when YOU make a group you can minimize the chances of inviting someone who has in the past shown that they cannot be trusted, by checking a well curated (evidence required) blacklist for their names.
---
Ideally you make a copy paste for your groups where you ask everyone (randoms) for written consent on the rules (only need on your armor type, these items are reserved) and make a screenshot of their consent so you can use that together with a screenshot of the rulebreaking to ensure a fair blacklisting.
---
There is really no reason to ever break agreed upon rules in WoW. This isn't a job where your employer can abuse you with unlawful rules out of your need for money. You don't die without a dungeon group so there is no pressure to ever accept rules you don't wanna agree to.
---
I loved the launch. The new zones were really cool and I liked the difficult dungeons. In retrospect, I hated the Azeroth world and quest redesign, but it's ancient history at this point. Cataclysm was far from perfect, but I think the endgame was pretty decent, despite the final patch content drought (haven't most expansions had one?). MoP through the present have been pretty un-enjoyable for me.
---
I kind of agree with this but to be fair that had much more aggressive dynamic respawns.
---
Cooking is definitely good. You won't care about most of the food, but some of it will increase your spirit and stamina. At later levels, good can also give you other benefits.
---
First aid can also be useful, especially when you have a 3-6 second break where you are not being attacked and you want to heal yourself without mana.
---
While of course it's not expected that they crunch, a 2 day stress period should be the exception. If anything it shouldn't be that they need to stay late it should be that they need to shift their schedule so they come in later and stay later to match the peak time. 
---
It sucks but they're working on something that is outside normal hours. Overall, the stress test doesnt seem like it stressed much at all.
---
They are going with the original better version which I'm really happy about. You pay a small amount for the training, and a large amount for the mount. The only reason it changed in 1.12 was in preparation for TBC.
---
But that’s kind of the point, is it? People choose to either compete with a lot of people, go elsewhere and quest in a ‘worse’ area or go grind mobs somewhere. It’s this sort of accommodate the player so they’re comfortable mentality that, 15 years later, got us this boring, casino-like game we call retail. Some layering, sure. Maybe first couple days of launch. But honestly let the consequences just be.
---
This post legitimately made me smile. I love this game.
---
I have never purposefully tried to exploit a game to get ahead. I would rather win with skill and dedication. The people trying so hard to convince everyone that every player will attempt to exploit the game are projecting their own shitty gaming habits onto the community. The majority of people wont be spending their little time they have to play a fun game trying to exploit resources to get a gold lead on anybody
---
Then don’t play classic.

So they can't join the WoW community? Because they like stupid little emotes? That is gatekeeping.
---
Or one healing priest goes shadow weave PI build. And uses rank 1 mind flat once every like, 30 seconds or something?( Forgot the duration).
---
No sharding/layering!!!!! It's a terrible idea, increase respawn rates based off of zone population is the best solution.
---
Every single type of loot system has potential to cause drama.
---
DKP? Hoarding and collusion.
---
Loot council? Favouritism
---
Blind rolling? Rng over helping raid
---
etc etc.
---
EPGP is just the lesser of evils.
---
Also EPGP often uses a discounted bidding, where you first offer item for 100% GP (so people who really want it can get it right away), then if nobody wants it it's offered at 50%, and if nobody wants it still it's offered one last time for 20%. If people still dont want it at 20% then there's zero problems with disenchanting it.
---
I'm going to play a melee priest, and there is nothing you can do to stop me.
---
Here you have a graphical explanation of it: https://i.redd.it/xpz3z1ly1dy21.png
---
This is a scenario where "you think you do but you don't" is actually true. There's only 3 real options for Classic's launch:
---
* Launch with many extra servers and do server merges after the launch rush
---
* Launch enough servers to handle the expected permanent population while not using layering at release
---
* Launch enough servers to handle the expected permanent population without the use of layering but use layering to handle the massive initial population
---
Option 1 sucks, server merges cause tons of economic and community damage. Server merges also weren't at all part of the vanilla experience for most players.
---
Option 2 dumps likely 10k+ people into a world designed for a cap of ~2500. There would be insane overcrowding no matter what, if the game could even handle it. We're talking an average of over 1,250 people per race, which means places like the orc/troll or dwarf/gnome starting areas would likely reach close to 2500 people. An actual vanilla server with it's cap of ~2500 people all logging on for the first time at once would only have around 300 people per starting zone. You'd literally have the population of an entire vanilla server one starting zone, and there'd be *two* of them like that. This would be utterly, completely unplayable.
---
Option 3 handles both of these problems and actually provides the most accurate vanilla experience. The issues that OP pointed out are completely fixable and that should be the focus, not calls for layering to be scrapped completely.
---
TBF I don’t think it will be TOO bad on launch. They should have plenty of servers and as long as you aren’t making a human there shouldn’t be very bad traffic

&gt; and release people i waves is not a better idea
---
You mean not everyone can start at launch?  People can start in batches?  There are people that are going to be competing for world firsts, and this would crush that competition.
---
I, personally, want them to keep layering the entire Classic Wow experience.
---
Worse than that, mobs cause durability loss.  So if you can get monsters to get the killing blow in PVP, it starts to add up in repair costs.  
---
At 60, getting plate wearers killed by mobs was always salt in the wounds.
---
Woah there, but didn't you see his newest video, wherein he admitted that he was just a little wrong about class pruning after five consecutive years of negative feedback about class pruning? Faith in Ion restored!

It's exactly a 1:1 correlation, you just aren't young anymore, don't know the young people's jokes and are now acting like your parents did when they heard your slang.

I got to 60 on a private server with a 10k population just fine without any layering or sharding and so did thousands of other players, it is not necessary.

Cooking and First Aid aren't needed, but they are a nice bonus. Levelling up Cooking skill takes some effort, and is done slowly over time, all the way up to level 60. If you don't enjoy cooking, you can use that time for levelling your character, or levelling another profession like Mining or Blacksmithing.
---
Basically, any time that you spend in the game will progress your character in some way. There is no wrong way to do it (just some are a little slower and some are faster).
---
Still better for the healers to bring shadow weaving over a spriest.
---
It just never occurs to you people fun can be had in this game leveling many different ways. You taking your time leveling is not the optimal level of fun for *everyone*. It's *your* version of fun.
---
If you enjoy it, good for you. This whole logic that you can't have fun if you are speed leveling is just idiotic.

Not liking him isn't the point. I actually DO like Ion. What I don't do is *trust* him, because it's not up to him.       
---
        
---
I don't think he's lying, but I also think he's constrained by higher forces and at the end of the day  there is no way to enforce/confirm there will only be layering for a few weeks until they actually remove it...and even then there is no evidence to suggest they couldn't put it back any time they felt they needed to.          
---
            
---
But more simply, just because Ion says they have no intention of keeping layering in doesn't guarantee it won't stay in. A statement's not a contract.
---
The game places professions into primary and secondary. You can only learn two primary professions but you can learn all the secondary professions. Secondary professions include first aid, cooking and fishing. You certainly do not need to learn any of the secondary professions but they provide minor to moderate bonuses for every class in the game with no down side.
---
First aid allows you to turn cloth scraps you loot into bandages which you can use to heal yourself or others. As a paladin you can heal but that costs mana and at higher levels mana regenerates more slowly.  
---
Cooking allows you to cook the meat you find from looting beasts. This does two things. Cooked meat sells for more to a vendor than raw meat. You can also eat the cooked food. Some of which grant you stat buffs.
---
Fishing is more tedious so I wouldn't recommend it at low level. However it is one of the best ways of making gold when you are still at a low level.

“You wanna get rid of the Kobolds? Go do it yourself, bitch!”
---
There will be competition by other players that are knowledgeable of the game and have committed to quickly leveling to access those high level resources.  It surely won't be one person abusing phasing for a very long time.  It probably won't even be five people, but a lot more people, some even under leveled, but risking their deaths by gaining access to the rare materials, will be attempting to compete for them.
---
Having mained a lock in vanilla I'm a little salty about everyone now knowing the secrets
---
Because in literally ever case where pserver vs classic was challenged classic has been correct when compared to the actual original version they have set up.
---
Right there with you dude. All I want to do is tank, but warriors are just way too popular!
---
This really should have more upvotes instead of the memes posted that nobody cares about.
---
What happened to "No Changes" in this subreddit?
---
"Keep Classic, Classic" ? Or no?
---
The people advocating for layering need a history lesson from Coca-Cola and "New Coke"
---
Easy to check - just make her jump and see if she flips or twirls

IIRC it should, yes. There's been some other noticed issues with Warlocks pets, like having the Imp on Defensive, hitting Attack, and it only throwing out a single fireball before going back to idle.

The crypts under Mor’ladim in duskwood.  I forget if anything actually sends you specifically down there, but it was a unique outdoor dungeon with 2 entrances and just looks cool.

Pro tip, dont google a quest location. Ask in general chat \1. Best way in my opinion to keep the experience fresh. It might take a bit longer but the exploration and rewards are better when you discover them yourself

Great insight.

What. You can play 1minute a day and still get to 60 in 9 days /played. It doesnt matter how much you play a day, /played only counts time... Well, played. So online.

Turn on that auto self cast. That way you don’t have to target yourself to cast a self heal.

Lol yeah episode 1 sucked in retrospec. You get to see a good guy get cut in half and a racist caricature

They have after 40 with mortal strike.

Welcome to the new gamer culture where being edgy shocking and trying to provoke others is the new norm.  That being said, I doubt Blizzard had their GM team monitoring the stress/beta tests like they would be live servers.
---
What the hell is character progression in wow? You had tier sets and the legendary ring in WoD, that's more than you get in most expacs.
---
Them’s the breaks. My work schedule and personal life are such that when I sit down to play I may have 1 hour, 3 hours, or less than 30 minutes to do anything. I could be interrupted any number of ways. No one should have to group with a guy that’s going to duck out halfway through an instance. I would love to be part of the community and I will be, but I’m not going to make my scheduling conflicts someone else's problem. Light questing and friendly interaction are fine by me but time intensive group play isn’t in the cards for me right now. My brother understands and shares a lot of my limitations, thats why we’re in it together.
---
Release will be a shit show for sure but thats why i love it
---
If temporary overcrowding in the starter zones bothers you THAT much, then don't play. I don't see the issue here. In the long-run, it *definitely* won't matter.
---
Layering will last longer and it will likely affect the long term health of the game.
---
I played Alliance until Wrath where I faction changed to play with friends. I never leveled a Horde character past a starting zone until well after the Cataclysm. So for me, playing Horde in Classic will actually be a fresh experience. I won't have memories of where to go and what to do. And I'm excited for it.
---
If you and 3 or 4 other people are all struggling to farm lemur testicles or whatever, instead of competing against each other try working together.
---
 It'll streamline the process and you might accidentally make a friend.
---
 THAT is the vanilla experience.
---
I don't think anyone ever claimed a single person would be responsible for all abuse on all realms. The point is that a small portion of players are going to get access to five times more resources than they normally would've.
---
I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT!
---
As  we get closer to WoW Classic’s release, we thought now would be a good  time to talk about our plans for Classic realms here in Europe.
---
We’ve prepared several realms, which will include Player vs Player, Player vs Environment, and Role-playing realms.
---
For Classic, we’re planning on not splitting up realms by language.  This has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall, we think that  it’s the best starting point for WoW Classic. An exception will be made  for the Russian language, which will have separate realms due to its  reliance on the Cyrillic Alphabet. For technical reasons this will also  mean Russian is going to have its own separate game client, similar to  what happened in The Burning Crusade.
---
We think this approach will give players more freedom to move around  to where they want, and find guilds and friends that best match their  interests.
---
I actually had that on a pirated CD's as a kid. So in my country piracy was a huge thing back then. I bought wow because I had no idea it required online connection and stuff. I ended up having that. Creating my own host or server. Ended up all alone in the world. There were no mobs. Funny thing is there was Spirit Healer walking around on the ressurection places. I had no idea what was I suppose to do. All I did was exploring around.
---
I love druid gameplay and mained one in MOP (last time I played). I never got one past level 10 in vanilla, so I have no direct experience from that era, but from what I've read they're pretty... bad. 
---
Are they really the worst healer? Will groups drop me for not having a basic Rez (wtf blizzard)?
---
Is feral good for anything other than flag carrying? It looks like they are ret/enh levels of desirability.
---
Bear looks decent for 5 man's but not beyond that.
---
And balance looks terrible in every facet of the game.
---
Is it really this dire? Should I just avoid this class?
---
Most people really don't have any concept of just how awful it would be to not use a system like layering. The only other options are to either do server merges, which really suck, or to just dump the same number of people on a server without layering and end up with the entire population of an original vanilla server in a single starting zone. And the economic damage in such a scenario would be insane. The world is designed to handle a maximum population of about 2500 people at a time. That goes for the number of mobs, the number of resources, everything. People complain that layering as it is on the beta allows some people to jump between layers and farm extra resources but no layering would have the complete opposite effect. Resources meant to cover a much smaller population would be spread among multiple times more players. Prices would be through the fucking roof on everything. People think gold was rare in vanilla? This scenario would make that look like a fucking post-scarcity society.
---
I know you're talking about IF, but if you're even considering going Horde, you might think about a Shaman. Ele/Resto is a lot of fun and has some decent synergy. Your totems will be needed in raids, your heals are not amazing, but they will be needed in raids, and your wipe cleanup (self-rez) will also be good utility for raids.
---
This was a great video!  Way to make me want to play a paladin... xD  If any of my friends join and go warrior I would for sure roll a pally with them (assuming alliance).  I think about priest at times but always hearing that pally is the most mana efficient healer makes them sounds appealing (along with blessing of freedom for pvp, amongst their other pros).  I've not healed in mmo's a ton but when I do running out of mana is super stressful.
---
I don‘t know why they didn‘t let us EU players prticipate at the stress test honestly. That‘s racist af
---
It's 2019, the servers can absolutely handle it. Even private servers can do it and they don't have the resources Blizzard does.
---
Depsite that, yeah you're probably right that they will layer it. If Blizzard thinks layering is necessary to prevent overpopulation, of-fucking-course they'll use it at the AQ event.

Shit along those lines.

It's disingenuous to silence the people who say, "Um, that's no guarantee" just because you feel like the argument is empty. There is plenty of reason to be dubious, and having those that are concerned only able to see the positive "Blizzard said it, trust them" because all the others have to "shut up" skews things. Someone on the fence should be able to see that not everyone thinks Blizzard saying something makes it gospel, so they can feel free to decide whether they feel that way themselves as well.
---
Or just skip it. Do you all just run from spawn to spawn waiting in line? If something is being camped by a shit ton of people, then go where the people aren't. Once people spread out it doesn't matter anymore. My point is that there is so much to do in the game that waiting for a mob to spawn is pretty pointless, especially in the starting areas.
---
When you can speak english french german and spanish feelsgoodman
---
That's part of the game IMO - grouping up with others to share kills so it was more likely you'd get to tag quest mobs before others - sticking together and questing in a group since you were already on the same part of the chain - chatting during downtime or while auto running.
---
The time sink - the grind - and the need for help from other players contributed to the sense of and need for the in-game community. This is one of the differentiating factors of an MMO compared to just a multiplayer game. Removing that competition and grind dilutes the need to interact in that space and taken to its logical conclusion results in what we have in retail now - there is rarely any need to directly interact with other players even when you're running around in the same zone on the same quest chains. There is no challenge or frustration in managing to tag that last mob you need for a quest. No interesting stories arise out of an easy-mode world.
---
That's actually pretty dumb. Hope they change their mind absolut Thais.

Those are good choices, I’m going hunter first when classic rolls. I’ll save my pally for when the population isn’t so crowded
---
Got tons of information on how to level faster and was able to figure out UI issues before launch.  Well worth 15 bucks.
---
I’d personally prefer it to be earlier. Either after starting zones or after level 10. I know it’s going to be a traffic jam, but traffic jams were part of the original experience. I hate to wait, but I haven’t waited all this time, nor have most of you, for Vanilla to come back, just to be altered for convenience. Convenience is why retail has become a failure. I am here and ready to embrace the suck!
---
This is why so many people left modern wow. People like you just went in with the "If you don't like it, leave" attitude and look at the game now! People have been wanting an authentic vanilla wow for over a decade at this point. Please don't encourage them to fuck it up so early.
---
Humans invented the cheeseburger, a crime the tauren will never be able to forgive.
---
After the first month there will be no need for it and will most likely will be removed.  Just hold out until then.
---
It’s about server identity and seeing the same people over and over again from level 1 to endgame raiding/pvp. Sharing people deteriorates that. It tears at the feeling that your in a world. Getting phased out of a fight because you joined a group really does ruin what Classic is about.
---
Most certainly not, and even if that is the case, checking should still be done just in case.
---
Man, this is not going to end up well. I remember back in Vanilla we didn't have a Spanish server (the game wasn't in Spanish either) so we had to unofficially choose Spinnebreaker as the Spanish realm. 
---
English people weren't happy about that and kept reporting us for speaking Spanish. A lot of arguing and insults between both parties constantly.
---
well RIP RP servers
---
Ideally I would love that. I’m trying to be realistic next to my personal obligations. But classic is the game i’ve been waiting for, I just have to play it on my terms.
---
It's a great idea on paper.  The only concern I'd personally have is how they have it designed.  I'm not sure they have it designed modular in the way you are talking.  By that I mean that they can turn it on and off based on zones and not a blanket server wide switch.
---
I could be wrong since I also don't know the code involved in it.  However I could see that system being a server wide attribute and not a zone attribute.  
---
Managing layering on a zone level instead of server level would be a daunting task.  It would also lead into human error of someone missing a single zone somewhere when they take out layering completely as opposed to a server checklist type deal.
---
Oh, it'll take forever. The journey is great, though, and there will always be new things to learn and explore.
---
The absolute fastest people, who ignore professions, memorize quest routes, and optimize everything for leveling speed are going to be taking at least 120 hours (the current record, I believe, is 116 hours) to get to level 60.
---
This game isn't just fun at level 60, though. You can have a great time throughout the entire process. It really picks up for me at level 15-20, when I can start going through dungeons with other players. If you get some pointers from people, telling you where to go for quests, you can probably get there in just a few hours.
---
I see a lot of people talking about how WoW Classic is all just nostalgia, and then we see a lot of people (including some very high profile retail wow personalities) affirming that no, it is not just nostalgia, it's something much more. I think those of us who have played beta or spent signficiant time on private servers can also agree with and attest to this. The wider world will realize this on Aug 27th, and it's going to be something special (again).   
---
And then, we have threads like this. Fueled by a lack of basic understanding of the technical limitations of making this tech work at this scale, misplaced and insolent anger, and an insistence on forcing destructive restrictions on the developers roll the game out to players. There's always an insistence that "I'll take a shitty experience for the first 24-72 hours to preserve an authentic experience". Frankly, these opinions are shortsighted and selfish, and are fueled by the worst type of myopic, elitist Nostalgia. You are insisting that this experience is yours and yours alone, and should only be experienced on your terms. Sure you remember waiting to tag mobs and you remember hitting login queues, but your actual memories are so abstracted at this point that you don't remember how poor WoW was as a "service" in the first 3-6 months of its release, and the rippling impact that simply throwing more servers up had on individual player communities 1-2 years down the line when inevitable server merges came.  
---
It would be equally irresponsible and shortsighted of the developers to not have a plan to mitigate this impact in some way. And rest assured, without layering, it wouldn't "just" be making it difficult to tag mobs, or having some lag, or lopsided population after a few weeks. It will be all of those things, dialed to 11. It would be rushing to tag a mob and getting the first hit in, but not actually getting the tap because of the 5+ second server delay translating to your client and telling you that rogue next to you actually got the tap. It's 4+ hour login queues because your realm pop's functional cap is 1/4th what it would be without layering, it's having your carefully curated server community immediately upended after forced realm merges 3 months after launch.  
---
An sure "you" might be willing to put up with this, or at least you are telling yourself you are willing, but as a service provider, Blizzard can't cater to just you. They have to think of the big picture, and from what I've seen of the developers (Omar Gonzales, first of his name, lord of Azeroth and the Alliance Kingdoms, long may he reign), they genuinely care about this project and want to make it as good as they can. As such, no, they won't budge on this no matter how much you gnash your teeth at this point, because doing that would just be objectively wrong. Get over it, play the game, and within a month of launch you won't even remember this was a thing at all.
---
If only they had a feature where you could block people you dont want to listen to. A GM will not help you when it's something you can easily take care of yourself
---
What you're doing is making the false equivalency that my indecision on starting day one or waiting a couple days is advocating for changes.
---
Stating that my indecision is projecting makes no sense.
---
What you're trying to do is gaslighting. You might get away with talking to your wife's son like that but not me. 
---
Ignored.
---
Pet on aggro in dungeons...if you're a real man
---
That was the real nail in the coffin for WoW to me.  When they made the content so easy you don't need to interact with anyone, just killed the game and especially the leveling process.  Leveling is a lot more fun in classic where you actually have to interact with people instant of just press a button to go into an instance and aoe everything down.
---
This shit needs to go. I'm sick of the fanboys saying that it's necessary. 
---
No changes. Let the first week be a shit show. Don't like it? Come back later.
---
Oh shit i saw jbob myself. Its so cool seeing other people ive seen before. I still have a brown shirt made by “icecoffee” and its nice seeing him around from time to time.
---
Thanks for the explanation, that does clear a lot up for me. Layering will still be more expensive because there will be way more layers than there would ever be servers/realms right? If people truly want the 'real vanilla experience', there will be a limited amount of realms with insane queue times, and thus way less VM's?  
---
And sure the tweaking of the tech they did to make it fit in Classic is pretty noticeable and should be a decent amount of work, right?
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. I agree with every single point your making. I'm talking about 4  different 5 man groups waiting for hogger to spawn 30+ ppl in the janglode mine. Stuff like that. It's too much.
---
Weird flex by okay.
---
Eeeuuurr Le'Baguette DM run fwar fwar fawr?
---
Literally just using exit / logout like normal. If I alt-f4'd, every setting would reset, not just one.
---
Also I said that it happens when I /reloadui too.
---
I'm excited to meet all these pvp heroes out in the open world. So worried about layering because they're going to be the next Vurtne. Settle down guys, you aren't as good as you think you are. I feel like most of the people complaining will be the ones trying to layer to get out of dodge.
---
I don’t think live servers will be that busy, and the chat trolling won’t be as bad when it’s a permanent character on the line.  Last night was a stress test where they intentionally shoved everyone on to 2 servers to see what they could push in to breaking or at least get data on working.
---
For the majority of vanilla there wasn't a lot of things, but for some reason blizzard decided to go with the OG version of mounts. I'm not complaining, but it's a double standard.
---
Prank ? This seems to be silly AF
---
Listen up you hacking panda, we don’t got time for your pick a side malarky

untill u need to buy pots or w/e on the AH and u notice the price is x10
---
What are the major bugs that are currently affecting each class?  I'm not talking about things like specific items that are buggy, but common gameplay bugs or major class issues that (if unresolved by launch) will make it very annoying to play a class?
---
For example, melee leeway affecting Hunter Deadzone and affecting Warrior Hamstring Kiting, or Pet AI bugs causing trouble for Hunters and/or Warlocks.
---
Please reply if you know of:
---
* Fixes to these bugs that have rendered my information obsolete
---
* More information on these bugs as it pertains to various classes
---
* More bugs that will have a massive impact on a class's gameplay
---
That could easily end up as one of our combos! Cat durid is for fight after all.
---
Right over my head.
---
Do you honestly think that would make enjoyable gameplay for the vast majority of players? You don't tune a game for the 10% hardcore audience.
---
Bubble + HS. Name a more iconic duo.
---
You don't have to do it frantically, and most people will likely have some friends. If you are getting ganked over and over again, you can just hop to a different layer to avoid pvp.
---
&gt; I put at least six individuals on ignore in just those few hours, which discounting bots is more than I think I had ever had in all my previous playtime combined.
---
&gt;It really isn't. They should just spin up more servers.
---
I get what you're saying but the math just won't check out in this modern era. Old school WoW realms had a cap of what, like 3k people?
---
No one knows how many people are going to be here for launch, but if we use 1 mil as an example (which is maybe too conservative, who knows) you're already looking at 300+ realms. That's more than what exists today. Not only is that way too overwhelming as a starting point, but it guarantees that probably more than half of them will be completely dead a few months in...which would probably harm the overall experience more than layering would.
---
Idk, I don't envy Blizzard in this situation. There's no easy solution and they're damned if they do damned if they don't.
---
100% so many things i forgot about the dwarf starting quests and now i know exactly where everything is so i can hopefully gain a bit of an edge come launch
---
Nah, totally on your side. I was a little flabbergasted by the question (who'd think that was okay?)
---
I get the "the servers end soon anyways" attitude to a degree (no reason to lose sleep over it), but generally that guy was a fucking prick and deserves to be avoided by parties like the plague.
---
Excuse me your forgetting about boomkins
---
How do you know this? I just looked into all blue posts on layering with nothing explaining this.
---
Keep in mind a quest flag is all that is needed to have some one layre or phase as is demonstrated with current wow. All they really need to do is zone not contested = No hidden quest flag. Zone that is has quest flag. Quest = flagged? = no layering. 
---
I'm aware phasing and layering are not the same. The point here is the tech is there to do this
---
You whiny shits need to try leveling on a private server if you think a month of layers is that bad
---
Lol, yeah. Some people never get to 60, or never spend much time at 60, because they're too busy leveling up more characters.
---
At least they are nice enough to split of the Russians from the rest of Europe, wish they did that for their other games. 
---
What's obviously going to happen is some servers will be unofficial language servers just like you had in vanilla. Russian Warsong, Greek Genjuros, Swedish Stormscale, Hungarian Ragnaros and so on.
---
Damn, Blizzard really thinks Classic is going to die so hard that France and Germany can't even sustain their own realms. Bad news for Australia.
---
* US Pacific &amp; US East get 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
* US Central &amp; US Mountain get 1 PVP and 1 PVE.
---
* Europe gets 3 PVP, 3 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
* Russia gets 1 PVP and 1 PVE.
---
* China gets 4 PVP and 4 PVE.
---
* Korea and Taiwan get 1 PVP and 1 PVE.
---
31 realms.
---
As i suppose, an english speaking player, how do you feel about that? Being not concerned at all by something that's gonna piss off a large amount of different language speaking players? Even if a lot these people already played on pserver and used to talk long ago in english to keep playing the vanilla version, it's damn unfair for everyone else.
---
I don't think you'll avoid this problem by choosing a different race.
---
The concept of phasing is s little different and adds the ability for the same area to show progression. It has some good qualities but makes interaction in an MMO a little funky. I remember a phased zone in WotLK that really required some extra players in order to complete quests in. The problem I had was that by the time I got to it, most people had completed it. Since they couldn't join me in my "phase" even people who were willing to help couldn't. It was very frustrating.
---
how do you think barrens chat got so famous. this isn't new
---
Even if it's just for a few weeks they should limit it a lot more. Being able to farm endgame mats with multiple layers is not good and it really ruins pvp when you can just phase into a different layer, like if someone ganks you.
---
I love how kenny gets to be a human hunter
---
You can tell it’s very old internet if they spell it “on-line”.
---
Much how very old newspaper articles may reference the game of “base ball”.
---
Warlock pets don't do that much of their damage.  Pick a faction, then pick between the utility abilities or theme.
---
IMO, Undead warlocks have a lot of unnecessary overlap (i.e. undead breathing and warlock breathing underwater), but they also fit thematically the best for me.
---
You know why. For the fun of it. If you are not min-maxing a fun goal to have is to do every dungeon atleast once on the way to max level.
---
Some people like seeing all of the dungeons, and WC is a fun one. It's not the most efficient, but running through Barrens as level 18 alliance scum can be kind of fun.
---
There are four WC quests for Alliance. The ones in Ratchet are available for both factions.
---
Stunning and brave
---
This seems easy to fix, if you join a group thats in another zone just keep you in your own layer until you get to the same zone.
---
Dynamic does not mean instant. No one is arguing for instant respawns or respawns so short that this would happen. Ideally, instead of 5 min respawns, maybe mobs respawn at the very fastest in 45 seconds if A) The layer is full and B) there are hundreds of players in close proximity.  After the initial 1-10 zones you could lower it to a 90 second - 5 minute dynamic respawn and then eventually get rid of it after 3 weeks or so.
---
Hunter is one class neither of us are super keen on. Its not even the old huntard prejudice, but the friends we used to play with all played hunters and we got sick of seeing them lol.
---
Why can't *you* just wait a couple days or week after launch if you can't handle it being overpopulated without layering? Why must we damage the entire game just to cater to people who need instant gratification?
---
&gt; "you're missing the point" "you might get away with talking to your wife's son like that but not me"
---
Yeah sounds like projecting to me.
---
While I definitely agree that classic gameplay leads to more interaction and socializing compared to retail, this behavior will be further intensified by this very belief. People here that this game is more social, they join in and socialize even more than they already would. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy really.
---
There's an ability gap at 27 - 29 where nothing really benefits much, need to dump points somewhere. PoJ is usually gotten somewhere 21-26 for that.
---
PLUS, PoJ is 8% mounted speed too.
---
FYI - a thread has been started cataloging the layering exploits and problems over on the Blizzard Classic forums:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/examples-of-layering-exploits-and-problems/198240
---
Yea Moarweight is correct.  It wasn’t a pug in the general sense that me or you would start a random group.  It was normally a core group of 10 or so from a top guild that would create the groups every week with a few items reserved.  But they ran them every week successfully.  It was a lot of fun.
---
I’m fairly certain tunic of the crescent moon shouldn’t be available in phase 1, which you have listed for balance druid and shaman. Pretty sure it was added to boss tables (alongside most of the other blue caster dps leather) around AQ release
---
It's one of those classes that I feel you should avoid if you're not ready to put in a serious shift in terms of studying the class.   
---
It has an awkward gearing experience because like you said, no one wants a resto druid for 5 mans because of the lack of res. So your best bet is to tank them, which also requires some gearing up to be able to do.   
---
Once you're in BIS resto aint that hard and you'll swim in gear since there's very little competition. But it's a class that takes some getting used to, and if you're used to post-tbc skills in feral, you'll have a very hard time pvp'ing too I'd imagine.
---
Fuck life at 60. How do I survive STV as a warrior (and wpvp in general)?
---
I'm just assuming you dudes have no idea what you are doing. I guess I should have said "instead of waiting for a spawn" instead of "while waiting for a spawn." Just skip the wait and do something else to get experience. If it is a quest you just really want to do, then you can level fishing/cooking and your other professions for awhile and then come back to the quest once the area is less dense.
---
Blizzard: No Brexit for you!
---
Private servers do their best to research vanilla and get it right. P Server is based on all the vanilla data, and they have researched much more than your dumb ass
---
What server
---
Aaahh! Of course!
---
I find it weird that people would be upset about overcrowding..its literally the first M in MMO
---
we don't really give a shit about the technicality involved in layering, we just want the game to work without disrupting the experience
---
What server?
---
There is a comparison with cat form only (since I can't find any AV test footage with the character sheet in bear form). It shows the cat form damage on the char sheet is approx 91% of the private server values. Because of the way cat abilities work this should be a less than 9% dps nerf.
---
PvE:  Priest doesn't have the mana to sustain DPS for a whole fight, so most likely you will be a healer.  That's a completely different playstyle.
---
PvP:  Mage is going to be more slippery with so many frost spells and blink.  Priest is going to be a bit tankier with PW:S, heals, and fear.
---
3.6
---
Put pet in passive.
---
Hit hotkey for pet attack. (doesn't matter if a mob attacks you first or not)
---
pet attacks, when mob dies pets stops and returns to your side.
---
Was working fine for me...
---
I feel like I pretty easily explained why it's not a 1:1 correlation.
---
It takes far more effort and research to translate shortcodes into a meaning that it does to translate old memes created using the english language into a meaning. 
---
like if the meme is to talk about chuck norris, i intrinsically understand that. If the meme is to see which spells look funny next to Anal, I intrinsically understand that.  If a meme is joking about where mankrik's wife is, as long as I know who mankrik is, I get it. 
---
When someone punctuates a sentence with "pog," how exactly can I figure out what that means? I *could,* with enough research and study and immersion...but it's wayyy harder than translating leetspeak or 'getting' an in-joke made in english or a slang word.
---
It's the difference between Marty McFly saying, "Whoa, heavy," and the jive dudes on Airplane! going  "Hey... knock a self a pro, Slick! That gray matter backlot perform us DOWN, I take TCB-in', man!"
---
&gt; I'm just assuming you dudes have no idea what you are doing. I guess I should have said "instead of waiting for a spawn" instead of "while waiting for a spawn." Just skip the wait and do something else to get experience. If it is a quest you just really want to do, then you can level fishing/cooking and your other professions for awhile and then come back to the quest once the area is less dense.
---
I mean, if you can manually move people into different directions to do different things, or quickly split/move them (for Thaddius, for example), while managing active mitigation, threat, tank healing, raid healing and sufficient dps to avoid enrage - mate, you deserve nax. You also deserve a nobel prize for discovering a way to become a god.
---
MC/ZG/AQ20 MIGHT be multiboxxable if you are very high geared (im talking aq40/nax gear levels), super experienced and just skip mechanics to burn stuff down, but even then i doubt it would be realistic for a lot of encounters.
---
Good luck multiboxing Heigan.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Confirmed. I still need to report it, but was going to try to reproduce today. So far how I have been able to do it with hunter is  
---
Have pet on defensive  
---
Attack 
---
Switch pet to passive 
---
Have pet attack
---
It will hit once then disengage, so switch to defensive  
---
It will not attack more than once until the mob dies
---
i had a guy steal a bear tag from me, i /cried on his shoulder, a white one handed mace dropped off the bear and he gave it to me, what a time
---
the biggest thing thing for me was that shamans were horde exclusive and paladins were alliance exclusive. this helped differentiate the factions even more. especially there was much tears shed on both sides about those two specific classes being OP, unfair etc. space goats ruined that for me lol

imagine saying WoD is underappreciated
---
Seriously, I wonder how host are able to read through that.
---
You had to have an active sub. So you saw people willing to pay 15$ for 48h of play, or people who are actively aging BfA...
---
I dont mind healing, I love it in fact, I just wish I didnt have to *re-spec* for it.
---
Both of those 2h are phase 2 items anyway.
---
Still not trolling, errors aren't trolling

For anyone who doesn't want to read the whole OP -
---
TL;DR - sensitive player can't ignore dumb shit people say and cries about crowding. Stay hyped boys.
---
Interesting. I got on at about 10pm est and it was pretty packed, not a lot of mobs to go around. No lag or anything though, just a lot of standing and tagging fights
---
I think  the first 90% of Wrath was Amazing and in many ways the best WoW has ever been. But the implementation of LFG among some other things set WoW up for failure.
---
Yikes. Talk about a reality check. But thanks for letting me know.
---
Yeah, that’s the point. Go grind mobs elsewhere. Find a new zone to quest in. Go work on professions. Take a break. Vanilla’s inconveniences are critical to its success. Player accommodation got us into the mess we’re currently in.
---
Could be my rose-tinted glasses, I dislike the kiddos who play these days.
---
Depends how much you can cheat with software rly.
---
Because we don't need to wait a couple of days. Blizzard have enough sense to cater to the majority of non-autistic people who aren't shitting their pants over layering. Great isn't it!
---
The problem will be reduced a tiny bit when people who aren't willing to shill out a sub for a few hours if a stress test, if BFA players, are online.
---
I think I’ll probably fall into the latter. Lol
---
Uhhh it's not world of warcraft unless I literally don't speak to anybody until I'm forced to do so in order to raid. Don't you play BfA?
---
I don't know man. Trying to tag board in the valley of trials seemed pretty much on-point from what I recall
---
So far, I'm planning on leveling 3 characters somewhat concurrently, depending on which of my friends are available to play.
---
* I will be leveling a Priest with a trio of Warrior and Mage, when all 3 of us are on
---
* I will be leveling a Warrior with a Priest when me and my best friend are on
---
* I will be solo leveling a **druid or a hunter**
---
I will be agonizing over which of these to solo level until Classic launches.
---
I don’t mind either way, this is the way they’ve chosen. Vanilla isn’t a mount collecting game anyway.
---
The point stands that we ran one. 
---
No one min maxed in vanilla the way they do now
---
I think the LH core does some weird stuff when the toon is unarmed. You should do this again with the same weapon equipped for each and see if it's different.
---
His question was in regards to what could be reasonably tackle.d. You already made restrictions on the classes and soloing half is not completing the dungeon. Furthermore, they won’t have good gear since they won’t be doing full groups nor raids. They will be in questing greens and blues.
---
As fuck as can be !!! fuck blizz really, this is a really big fucking mistake !!
---
That I can agree with but a lot of comments I read said that they hope they fix it by Phase 2 ( I should’ve replied to that instead but *shrugs* )

Thanks for the tip!

&gt;  five times more resources than they normally would've.

makes the resources five times less valuable.

And in fact, August 26 is a Monday and the game launches at 3:00 pm PDT. So they are launching during a work afternoon on a weekday in NA.

"What I want for myself isn't selfish, but what you want for yourself is."

No sharing outside of starting zones.

Obviously this isn’t ideal but why not just ignore it?? I don’t get how this stuff gets to people so much. Just don’t even look at your chat unless you have to if that stuff bothers you. I’m sure a lot of the toxicity will be weeded out in the coming weeks after release as people stop playing and the pop spread out

Kiddies aren't the ones going to get taken into the best guilds though. And iirc Race/Faction change didn't exist before Cata pre-patch or Cata itself, while the unbalance in favor of the horde started in BC. The really big thing were blood elves, which were just a good looking super RP race many, many people jumped on.
---
God damn, you sound exactly like the kind of people who killed the modern game. I wouldn't be surprised if you're quoting some Blizzard shill from 2010.
---
Why don't you just shut up and let the developers deal with it. That's why it's called beta. They know 10,000 times more than you about the subject.
---
Exexecutive: we only have x budget for running the game.
---
Ion: ok, we must keep layering longer.
---
WoD raids were great. The encounters were varied and interesting.  
---
There was unfortunately only 3 of them, only two tiers of content, and you never saw anyone due to garrisons.
---
English is the world's language. You want to interact with the world, learn it.
---
Bad news. Whenever I've seen communities built up of players who only speak one language on the same server on other MMOs, it's always ended in hostility.
---
Glad you now understand why this is a problem!
---
I mentioned this earlier - I keep seeing the word “layering” everywhere. I’ve researched it and read posts and watched a couple clips, and I still don’t understand what it is. Is there a simple explainer?
---
I am more concerned with people being able to jump layers than blizzard using layering so the server don’t catch fire.
---
Doesn’t this post/vid sort of prove that layers can be manipulated by an individual? In a weird way you can almost make layering apply to you on an individual basis. Fudging around with logins to jump layers until you get to a condition that you like.
---
I’d prefer blizzard to place you in a layer and you’re stuck there for awhile, or you can’t manipulate the layers. I have no idea how the programming of that would work, but I’d rather be stuck with the same people which (sort of) forces me to interact with them. Instead of being able to jump around till I get to a more acceptable game state on another layer.
---
You're idea is fine but it doesn't take into consideration the things guild members do to contribute to Raids other than showing up and knowing the fights. The same could be said for DKP systems and such. The reason most high end guilds have loot councils is to look out for the people that do the things like farming mats for consumables and also to make sure that key Raid members like main tanks get priority upgrades to improve Raid progression/farm. If I go out and farm 100 Black Lotus or fish 200 stoneskin eels so that we have Titan flasks - I would hope that goes into consideration for what loot I get in a raid.
---
I play to quad box or dual box, it’ll either be warrior shaman hunter priest as one unit of 4, or warrior / shaman and then hunter / priest.
---
It shouldn't be, and it definitely didn't have to be.
---
They probably didn't want to design a complex layering system knowing they will disable it quickly after launch, which I hope is their plan.
---
Zones used to be their own little worlds in vanilla, though 
---
Idk if you played vanilla or recall running from gadgetzan to Shimmering flats, but if you were with someone someone they would fade off your screen during the "in between" where the zones swap, then reappear after you see "Shimmering Flats" , so it feels like they wanted to a blanket system rather than have a bunch of little layering systems within each continent.
---
Only makes sense if they shut it down after first day or two imo. Otherwise, they should've took the time to make the layering zone specific because if I'm in duskwood I probably won't need layering as opposed to people in coldridge valley
---
Gurubashi Arena should not have layers.  
---
This kind of manipulation should be reserved for sharingan wielding ninja's and not dwarf warriors.
---
If this doesn't get changed, then the next best thing is to coordinate with the people of your own region to choose the server where everyone will go to, so we can have unofficial "French" and "German" servers etc.

---
Damn right dude, imagine realizing the realm you choose, after 1 month of play, is the unofficial Italian one, which you don't speak.
---
And that's the point where people can speak the language they want. Imagine if we all have to speak english, the people joining vanilla for the first time or not, not liking to be force, or even don't speaking english at all?
---
That's a damn shot in the fucking knee from blizzard imo
---
This is my take on the issue to. Someone in another thread pasted something like "what will you do when it takes 12 hours to find one Zhevra and it doesn't even drop a hoof?" like the obvious answer isn't just abandon the quest and kill some stupid shit. Every zone has mobs that aren't for quests and those are usually alive. Quests aren't actually that rewarding anyway, you'll level just as fast or faster by just farming everything.
---
&gt; A few weeks won't matter too much.  
---
So remove layering then
---
This is an old bug. 
---
I remember certain graphic/UI settings did not save at the menu close and instead would save upon logout. They'd stay in place for your session but if the game crashed or was force closed, they wouldn't be retained on the next log in. 
---
But if you just quit instead of logging out to the main screen, you could end up wiping your settings. I got into the habit of immediately logging out to menu, closing the game via the in-game options, then logging back in to make sure my settings saved any time I had to alter them.

---
With respect to the overcrowded areas and bottlenecked quests, you might look back on them fondly, even if you found them annoying in the moment, I remember wod release not because of the quests and zones, I remember it because me and the boys took several hours to get to our garrison, and I remember it as a funny memory.  
---
In regards to general chat, it is a stress test, people will be trolling just for the sake of it, because there's no stakes involved. In this current social climate, there's always going to be someone who tries to inject politics where it's not welcome. Best to move on and try and enjoy time with strangers you meet while adventuring.  
---
I myself didn't pay attention to general chat most of the day, my time was taken up questing with a warlock I helped kill Garrick with, and eventually reunited in fargodeep mine, we quested all the way until we killed hogger together, and had a decent chat for most of the time too.
---
It wasnt unplayable...it was just slow lol
---
&gt; Also if you're trying to avoid PvP, why are you on a PvP server?
---
I don't know. I've been asking this for years whenever people whine about ganking. But to think people won't abuse layering to avoid pvp is a bit naive. It just hurts the game so much.
---
It does but item drops aren't shared so quests that require drops are still individual
---
Gate keeping is exactly how I would describe it. I had HOURS to play vanilla when I was a kid, now I’m a grown ass adult. I only have a couples hours a night to play, and spending the first couple of weeks unable to progress because “the game’s not for casuals” is ridiculous. Vanilla was for everyone, and classic should be too.    That said, if layering isn’t taken out of the game after an appropriate amount of time, I would be disappointed.
---
Fuck.  Fellowship released *3 years* before WoW...
---
I suspect alot of people who try to rush 60 are going to burn themselves out pretty quickly.  Vanilla leveling was a marathon, not a sprint.
---
Ill repeat. Do you still have this theorycrafting? Was it ever shared with anyone outside your guild?
---
If the answer to this is no, then it's correct to say the current theorycrafting on Druid is all based on private server. If you re-invent the wheel without prior knowledge that some ape in a cave already invented it long ago, you are still the inventor of the wheel.
---
Until you find out all of Europe is getting 2 maybe 3 servers of each type.
---
Like?
---
OP there is already a game for you, it’s called retail. You wouldn’t make it in classic anyway. 
---
Let me join your guild. I am a warrior but man i like your mindset
---
Being a condescending fuck doesn't make you more correct. My point was never that those were unprofitable. And retail has been hemorrhaging players since Wotlk; the fact that they made money does not make them a success. 
---
My point is precisely that Blizzard doesn't care about you or I, which is exactly why I don't trust them with RP-PvP servers. How is this such a hard concept?
---
How is it a 0 sense meme?
---
Might be, but they can also be used that way.
---
Usually things like this deter me but I feel like I'll see more Warriors and Rogues. Plus I would never main another class. Shaman for life.
---
Do you know how hard it is getting the threads not to mention finding runs that will stop my edge in zg run. Not many. Also fighting with others over it
---
&gt; In the big picture, it's certainly better if you spend that time getting ahead at work, or working out, or focusing on school, or teaching yourself new skills, or whatever -- instead of playing video games.
---
Wouldn’t they just Vanish, sending all the mobs after you?
---
Looking forward to the RP servers I see :)
---
You are mistaken, friend. World of Warcraft isn't about doing things just for the fun of doing them, it's about getting a good score on a third party website.
---
Good. I very much look forward to that
---
Lol using fake slang to show hard to understand, pog literally means excitement and thats it.
---
It wouldn’t be impossible to share zones. That’s entirely within their realm.
---
HFC was good, it just outstayed its welcome by being endgame for 13+ months.  
---
There is also the complaint that the item levels invalidated previous raids, but that is the modus operandi of blizzard now.
---
I actually mentioned in a different reply that I hated the slow quest text, and then the person replying blew my mind by telling me I can make it instant somewhere in the settings. I read faster than the text loads, so I need it to be instant. Lol 
---
I love reading the storyline in the quest text. I’m all about the lore.
---
This isn't layering. This is sharding. Either they'll fix it or they'll commit brand suicide, it's up to Blizzard how this plays out.
---
Again, let me reiterate,  we didn't theorycraft back in the day
---
The AV bridge was also a great spot for that
---
Where did you see them talking starter zones only? You don't seem to understand how layering works even, just as the OP - it's world-based instance, that's the whole point of it.
---
What they did say is that layering should be in effect temporarily, probably just first few weeks and confirmed it will be disabled altogether with Phase 2 and World Bosses coming in.
---
Then we'd have complaints about how people can't run dungeons, because they were on layer 1, grouped up with someone on layer 2, but that person just did a quest with a guy from layer 3, so he can't get put on layer 1 until his 30 minute timer is up.
---
Dynamic spawning is the name I think
---
The other thing that helped a lot is kiting and at times running out of the instance. You burn down 1 mob in a group while running/fearing and then run out of the instance, re-group, and prepare for the next kill.
---
So for solo queue damage healer, probably a mage?
---
Where is this information from?
---
Except that, back in 06 you had french servers, why would they change it all of a sudden it doesn't make sense
---
&gt;When the original game was out, BRD runs, diremaul farming, aoe farming, none of this was known and widespread.
---
BRD runs were totally known and widespread. Same with aoe farming. I don't remember much about DM runs(except for some hunter videos) however I do remember Mara princess runs which I did with a Warrior friend.
---
Reminds me of my early MMO days in other games, there were like no resources online or guides. Had to ask in-game. Good tip to probably meet friends as well. Thanks!
---
"who cares if it feels like I am just playing a lobby game and the people around me are faceless automatons? I don't want to fight for spawns and can only play 9 minutes at a time!"
---
That’s the thing, they’ve made a firm decision. There is not another viable solution. Trying to limit layering to specific areas creates more problems than it solves
---
Quest greens and blues and whatever nice stuff we can craft. Since we know our end game is limited crafting is high on our list of things to work on.
---
I like this, because the TPM had some guilty pleasures thrown in. The pod racing and the jedi fight were pretty good. Same with WoD raiding.
---
How do you spirit rezz when people camp gy's?
---
You can do it just fine without good gear, since it's based on kiting. 
---
Obviously the risk goes up the worse damage output you have, as there will be more chances of feight death resists screwing you over.
---
Layering is just a way to split the players up into separate instances of the same continent. They're doing it so that the servers won't be overwhelmed (and so that the early zones won't be overwhelmed). You probably won't notice it.
---
The issue most people have with the idea is that it can be exploited. Some things are rare in the world, and if you can jump from layer to layer you will be able to gather more of these rare items.
---
It's a big deal, you won't notice it, and it should be going away after a few months.
---
Even if that’s true (which isn’t how I’ve seen “tryhard” used, but whatever), that doesn’t apply to someone saying that ret is a bad spec.
---
It’s not that I’m telling everyone to copy a very specific holy build or they’re bad. I’m saying that paladins, without regard to spec, gear, or consumables, just aren’t capable, mathematically, of dealing damage even remotely comparable to viable dps specs.
---
It’s just a bad spec. I’m sorry that so many people seem so personally offended by that, to the point where they feel the need to hurl insults at a stranger, but it’s just true. Stay mad about it, I guess :/
---
The system puts unsustainable amounts of players onto one server. Unless 80% or more players quit the game within the first weeks, you gonna have this stuff happening for months and if player numbers rise or stagnate, you will have this for as long as until enough players quit.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if layering will be one of the main reasons for people to quit.
---
Thanks! It’s really a blast so far! I can’t wait to see it all!
---
So bran does have a good story?
---
&gt; What a shitty way to think. Why not urge Blizzard to just make the game good instead? 
---
*What a shitty way to think.* That's literally what the temporary layering is supposed to be for, making the game good 'instead'. The launch will overall be far smoother and less crowded. As long as Blizz sticks to their word and removing layering within a week of or on the planned date, it will be perfectly fine.
---
No worries,
---
Me and the wife are debating waiting out the first week or so of go live and then starting.
---
Won't really make much difference, just means more crap available on the auctionhouse and a whole lot less competition in the starting zones.
---
It would be different if we had something to prove and actually wanted to be server first 60, but after giving up on that idea..  Stating a character a week late that you intend to play for 2 years, doesn't really make any difference all.
---
you shouldnt hit women
---
I have the gold for my epic mount by level 45-50 because I AH a lot, I know a lot about wow economy and how easily you can exploit people for money. Just one week of farming more crystals or leather will have catastrophic repercussions.
---
It's completely made up.
---
This takes me back, I also remember someone that worked with Blizzard coming to my high school to discuss graphic design back in 2000/2001 He showed us the Wow intro video then. Had no release date or any information. He just said this is a game we are working on and will be out in the next couple years. 
---
I was one of only about 15 kids at my high school that got to see that trailer then.
---
I think they said the 27th cus that’s when it’ll be out everywhere. The release times are shown on [this map](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/ui/UI5GHS0013QD1557845843113.jpg). I’m not sure if name reservation will work similarly
---
It's a balance. Classic is not designed nor defined by having too many players for too few mobs. That's more an artifact of the time it was made, when server technology couldn't adjust nor handle the stress.  
---
Even if I want to live like its 1940 I still want access to the polio vaccine, you know.
---
Leeway is intentional tho.
---
Thank god, no Russians. nothing worse than Russian players.
---
PvP is still there.  It's a large effort to coordinate changing layers in the middle of a fight.  There's really no difference between that guy logging off after you killed him and him jumping to a different layer.
---
Rares are still going to be rare.  If there are 3k players on one layer and 3k on another you're pretty much going to have the same chance of that rare being up on either layer.  It's not like you hop a layer and a rare is there waiting for you.  
---
There will still be community interactions.  I don't know why you think there woudln't be.
---
People taking the effort of hopping layers to maybe get an additional node are wasting their time.  Again, if two layers are FULL, the likelihood of a rare node being on one and not the other is extremely low.
---
Great! I really look forward to some higher levels. Can’t wait to see more.
---
Why don't they just do dynamic respawns like private servers do? I really just don't understand. How are private servers more Blizzlike than Blizzard?? Why is Blizzard trying to apply this cheap fix which will compromise their entire project?
---
That Blizzard doesn't think they'll be enough of a playerbase to sustain separate language servers for Europe...
---
You can pull off plays, just different ones than you would with Mage or Rogue. Their plays are based on long lasting CCs, which you don't have. But with the help of totems, you can pull some pretty clutch stuff - poison cleansing and tremor totem alone can swing the tides of a massive battle in a BG, a clutch grounding totem can nullify important spells like PoM Pyro or Death Coil. With some RNG, Chain Lightning -&gt; NS Lightning Bolt -&gt; Earthshock evaporates people and you can kill EFCs before they can announce they're under pressure. Purging important buffs like PoM or NS is also very rewarding.
---
Seems about right
---
Yeah, gonna need to know which realms all the French, Spanish, Italian, and Germans choose.
---
Imp firebolt doesnt autocast be default...that and pet attack cast corruption macro fixed it for me
---
Where do you see this coming out on the 26th for NA? Never heard this before
---
I understand what you're saying.  I've had web design/development as a hobby since the mid-90s and turned it into a career, so it changes how I look at things.  Might be why I also remember more designs that looked clean from back then, rather than just the nightmares you'd see on Geocities, Tripod, and the websites of companies that didn't care or didn't know better.
---
I love that this WoW site has no marquee, big animated GIFs, or any of that cheesy stuff.
---
Pservers have to make up for a larger cap on the server, or none at that. Classic uses layering to save money and they think it'll solve it, spawnm rates are meant for a 2500 cap after all.
---
That's the base assumption, going for "blizzlike" server caps and spawn rates.
---
Layering is not per zone (it's per continent far as we know) so I'm not sure I understand the request.  
---
Do you mean put all the players on the mega-server that are 30 and below into however many Azeroth-LayerN, Kalimdor-LayerN but cram all the 31-60 players on your mega-server into a specific single Azeroth-Layer10, Kalimdor-Layer10?
---
Big true
---
I'm guilty of this.
---
I don't know how often, I am just speculating. I just know how it is working now because I am in the beta. Also from past experience from other games that had similar systems. Archage myself and others would often use their technology to gain advantage over the system. I didn't like but as they say "everyone is doing it" ( large majority were).
---
My experience was that everyone was super friendly in Teldrassil, and we ended up talking about our experiences with classic back in the day. To each their own obviously but shitty players will weed themselves out in Classic, especially as they get tired of chasing their favorite streamers around.
---
It was common for rogues to do solo bar runs in greens for the barmans shanker, I did it myself in greens and lower level blues. Soloing the torch event also requires no gear, just practice. BRD has a ton of bosses, most of which are actually very easy. It's not a level 60 dungeon either so they will out level most of the mobs there.
---
The answer is simple. Blizzard doesn't think enough people are going to be playing Classic in France to warrant their own server.
---
&gt;rewards are more rare
---
That's the model and what made the game so addictive, effective. Rewards come fast at first but gradually require more and more time to work. The game functions as a "Skinner Box." For most people the psychological effect of reducing the frequency of reward is that they perform more and more of the activity that gets them rewards.
---
If you want a constant ratio of upgrade to time spent, vanilla may not be your game. Retail evens this out quite a bit though. You almost always have an upgrade you can achieve in a reasonable amount of time with the "forging" mechanic, at least if you enjoy dungeons.
---
Possible to do, no rewards.
---
Wasn't layering introduced in wotlk? The whole concept was originally to enable seamless questing without waiting for certain mobs to respawn etc, but that's the same thing which is making mmo into a single player game.
---
could you link that discord?
---
&gt; There is not much to worry though. 
---
respectfully mate, it sounds like you don't have much experience with vanilla or pservers.
---
In 1 week top guilds to hit 60 and farm.
---
That leaves 1-7 weeks *uncontested* farming of devilsaur, black lotus, AOE spots, etc. 
---
Now this normally impacts economy by inflating supply of gold but now multiply that by each layer between 5-10x and suddenly you've got an *insane* number of lotuses, herbs, devilsaur, rarespawns, etc.
---
- Imagine entire BG groups running around with Tidal Charm in the first month
---
- Imagine the first raid to run MC has half their raiders flasked because of how plentiful lotus it is
---
- Imagine the entire top guild gets 100% mount within a month.... not only farming MC with flask, but full mounts too
---
Whichever faction has that guild will *dominate* the world and their lead will extend thereafter.
---
If you've ever played pserver you'd have seen the snowball effect, and layering makes that snowball 10x worse
---
&gt; I don't require instant gratification.
---
You keep saying this, the solution is simple. Don't play until they remove it.
---
The rest of us will be having fun and you can continue to rage against the machine.
---
People have told me they're going to get lvl 60 in a week. Like that's not even healthy bro.
---
I'm with you dude. Stuff like this is absolutely stupid in a vacuum but opportunities to do exactly what he did here will be few and far between. It's a necessary evil for longevity of the servers and there's been a ton of fear-mongering related to it.
---
Since when is name repeats a problem.. seriously I hear this all the time. Just allow multiple people to have the same name, but when messaging/inviting you have to add their battletag, or even better, just force one of them to change their name.  
---
Id much rather have to change the name of one toon than ruin the whole game lmao  
---
Theres an even better solution though. Let ghost town servers be ghost towns, but drastically reduce price of server transfers/give 1 free transfer a year per account. There, now people who enjoy low pop servers can enjoy low pop servers, and the others can transfer for free. I fail to see how this is bad for anyone.
---
Yes. Settlement raiding in general was a big thing in Vanilla, and Biggish in TBC.
---
It was for fun for the most part.
---
Not sure about Hunters, as there are some discussions about fixing the /camp command, and as we do not know if Tribute run will be up. If that's the case they won't be of any use to farm gold anymore at 60, contrary to mages, who would still have solid AoE options.
---
Where did you put your effort? the raiding was good.
---
That's true, although mounts are seriously very expensive. If you have enough money to not have to sell your herbs, go for it, but most people will not have such a luxury.
---
If they only would allow layer switching in resting zones it wouldn’t be a big problem.
---
Uhh, Classic WoW? The petition really got Blizzard's, and the world's, attention.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/nostalrius-petition-passes-200k-signatures-mark-kern-to-deliver-it/
---
This works for me when I'm attacking first. But when a mob attacks me first, my pet won't respond when I hit the keybind for attack.
---
Hi, /u/cdman2004

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2xz3p/cabal_horde_pve_us_is_recruiting_for_classic_tt/).
---
Why do people think questing will be easier if they put in layering instead of server queues ??? its exactly the same. FULL SERVER
---
&gt;I'm not giving up on it yet, but I'm probably not going to roll another human in Classic. It's sad since that's where my roots are, but I think it's best for my own sanity.
---
Can't play for nostalgia - only new experiences. 
---
If you expect any type of "what I remember" you will be disappointed 10/10 times.
---
gross.
---
No, layering is very different from having separate servers. For starters, you cannot jump between servers. Nor can you group with people from other servers.
---
I suspect that post was sarcastic, implying that if you're not ultra-tuning and min-maxing everything constantly then you won't be in the top-tier bleeding edge raiding bits.
---
Don't worry about that, at all, whatsoever. Have fun and enjoy things - raids and hardcore content will still be there later, when you're ready for such a challenge. I started much the same way you did, semi-cluelessly stumbling through finding my way around stuff and being amazed at it all. None of that stopped me from eventually go on to become a skilled raider.
---
As long as it eventually turns off then I’ll be happy.
---
I want people to experience the horror of me kiting Lord Kazzak to Stormwind instead of just jumping to another layer. I want people to fully appreciate my work lol
---
Blizzard: “Let’s Split the Russians into their own realm because of the language issues with the game client.”
---
“Real” Blizzard: “Let’s get all hackers and cancer into one sever so we can monitor is easier.”
---
"bugs"
---
Honestly, with a 2-man group, I would recommend a Rogue/Druid combo. Feral and rogue debuffs on mobs synergize for improved damage for the both of you. Rogues bring a great punch, Druid can tank and heal in a pinch, and you can both stealth. 
---
This leads to a lot of fun, and getting into weird situations (deep dungeon dives, infiltrating enemy territory, avoiding that corpse camper in STV) that you might not be able to do otherwise.
---
Except you can jump layers at all will to farm quicker/dodge ganks. You cant do that with servers.
---
No, cause most people wont sub and log on and take a day off work or school for a 2 day stress test.
---
Layering is in place because Blizzard obviously doesn't want to open 600 realms to accommodate the initial rush of players. 
---
So what are the options you have?
---
Layering, multiple "realms" in one realm.
---
Less realms but insanely long queues.
---
More realms and the subsequent flood of dead realms, which can only be fixed by merging, merging is absolute dog shit btw.
---
No one seems to understand that the starting zone density being lower is a by-product that layering brings and not what it tries to fix.
---
Personally I hate layering, but I'd also hate to level to 60 and two months later I realize that I picked the wrong  realm because it had a lot more tourists than dedicated players. The logistics have to be an absolute nightmare for Blizzard because there is no way to determine how many players will play at launch, will stay or leave after the initial hype dies down. 
---
"Just merge realms LOOOOOOOOOL" is such a dumb statement that gets thrown around all the time, that shit is like layering but even worse and people don't realize it, losing your name, guild, guild name are just a few dumb things merging would do. At least layering has an expiration date (end of Phase 1).
---
Yes, it was definitely a thing. However there were no rewards for doing so - purely for fun and adding to the community of the server.
---
I played on Warsong and late into the game discovered that it was for whatever reason dedicated as the Brazillian server.  People called it BRsong.  At least I learned Brazillians type laugh with "jajaja" instead of "hahaha".
---
People tended not to raid cities that much because there was something called Dishonorable Kills.     
---
Killing NPCs caused you to lose PvP Honor and rank so hardcore PvPers will lose a lot of rank just by raiding a town alone.    
---
Not to say it didn't happen... but it was pretty rare compared to BC where they got rid of Dishornable Kills and got popular in Wraith when they introduced Achievements that rewarded that bear mount for killing the opposing faction.    
---
To put it simple, people did raid cities but not that much and it was purely for fun since it didn't offer any rewards.
---
I don't know how this was handled when WoW first released in Europe. Was it the same back then with no language segregation by servers?
---
Seems like if they're going to do this, it would be essential to have at least language specific instances of global channels available. I'm not sure if that has been done, but it seems like it should be doable and you could be assigned by default to a channel based on what national language setting you have chosen in the game client. So basically just sort of auto-macro'ing "/join general" to be "/join general-fr" or "/join general-de" and so on depending on your language setting.
---
huurrr.... can I join the circle jerk?  please?

lemme try:

"no.  it's just you.  you are special, and everyone else is going to level as quick as possible."

can I sit at the kewl kids table now?

well, unfortunately we have to use trade chat back on wyrmrest accord on august 13 to pick a PVP server, because there is a statement of no RP PVP server.  playing a PVE server is like playing d3 in softcore, the experience just puts you to sleep.  being constantly on the look out for enemies and making sure you have health to pull a mob and live through a rogue opener is important as putting all resist gems in your gear.
---
It seems like an easy fix would be to create a 'unique' layer within all the layers..  and upon hitting a certain level you are forced to that "permanent unique layer" basically preventing layer hopping after that level, if you invite people they would have to come to your layer if they were under X level.
---
Congratz. First on Horde is a great achievement.
---
May i ask a question?
---
How did you get through the early rush in the 1-6 zone?
---
No world bosses in phase 1, yeah?
---
Agreed. This also makes the paladin near invincible, and never really needs to stop DPS to heal.
---
- Curse of Weakness + mail / plate = no damage taken
---
- Blood Pact = bigger HP if you -do- take damage
---
You're just nonstop murder machines.

"*I* want queues because it's better for *me* because I'm willing to wait in queues. And other people are not willing"
---
Sounds like that
---
Were DK's a thing in Vanilla? I'm pretty sure that came after but if not it's something to consider if raiding major cities/killing NPCs
---
Laying shouldn’t be a thing. Everyone wanted the “vanilla” experience.. so if you have to wait to tag a mob, that’s what you asked for.
---
They should make french servers tbh, half of them refuse to talk english.
---
not sure if anyone has recommended him yet, but nobbel87 on youtube is great for pretty much any lore subject you can think of, and hayvengames is really cool for showing alpha content and how some dungeons have changed from vanilla alpha to now, is good material to watch
---
There is always a counter for everything.  Blessing of freedom when talented lasts 16 seconds on a 20 second cd.  Deathcoil has the same cd as wotf and the fear it has isn't effected by DR.  Shamans aren't everywhere like paladins.  Salvation doesn't effect getting gear but it greatly increases your pve enjoyment not having to wait for threat and being able to chain cast.
---
I think they were actively shifting layering around, population sizes and respawn rates all in an attempt to work towards a good solution come launch day.
---
I think they next stress test in July will be interesting to see how it's progressed at that point.
---
As I've said in other posts, I don't think layering should go live as is. It needs some tweaks to prevent exploitation. However, let's exam a worst case scenario based on how it actually works.
---
First, let's think about its purpose, which is to manage server population. What does this mean? It means the number of extant layers is based on the current active server population. They are not spun up arbitrarily and individual players or even guilds have little control over how many layers exist on a realm. So there will always be a cap on the number of layers, and that cap is directly tied to overall concurrent server population. So even in the worst case scenario, it won't be "farming x100", it'll likely be more like "farming x3". Still undesirable for sure. But it also means that in this realm, once it's reached a relative level of maturity, most of these farming areas will also have 3x the expected population. Meaning that in aggregate, these exploiters will still be facing some level of collection competition in each of those layers. They'll likely also be competing with other exploiters.
---
To expand on that point, this also means the server pop is high enough that there will be increased competition for these increased resources. The economy will reach an equilibrium. It's also kind of hilarious to me to see people talking about the Vanilla economy as if it were some perfect ideal. It was different on literally every server. There is no platonic Vanilla economy that everyone saw the same thing. It was massively affected by just whoever decided to play the AH on a given realm, as well as how many players were on the server, how many raided, what level they raided at, how many took PvP seriously, etc.
---
Anyway, yeah, layering as it is on beta has a lot of problems. Most of those can be greatly diminished by restricting what can trigger a layer change and what can't. But people are greatly exaggerating what a worst case scenario would look like.
---
Absolutely not.
---
You'd like like a 400 APM lol.
---
Same happened for Italians, we basically occupied two servers (Crushridge and Hakkar) and forced to all the others out, until the Italian client came out slightly before the release of Pandaria
---
What, thats all? What is the current max. player count on servers with sharding?
---
I remember servers having somewhat around 3k players? before entering a queue...
---
So 6 realms for europe = 18k slots in the long run?
---
Or am I missing something...
---
The servers are fully virtualized and scaled. The number of layers do not matter
---
Warsong was Brazilian
---
Most of the dumb shit happens in low level areas. Gotta fight your way out
---
This is only for the absolute nolife status, you can get by easily without. It's for optimal gearing.
---
Just common sense, 40people want items but bosses only drop a few plus some drops can be useless so they get disenchanted for shards. You want to double the loot you get each week, so you try to level a 2nd raid (dont need preraid BiS etc to clear MC anyway) and then have 20mains in each raid so you get double the ony/MC loot for a long time. Later on you merge the 20man mains together for the big 40man and those 40man can then split into 2 20man raids to finish MC and Ony once you have BWL gear.
---
The alts will come in handy to fill up the raid for ZG as well, or use friends from other guilds.
---
At that point you can use the alts for other things as well, maybe gear em a bit in casual raids when you need nothing from the raid and your guild gives the green light for it.
---
This is something a guild like method is likely to do, don't expect to be required to do this for progression raiding.
---
I played for 4-6 hours a day for years and didn't complete all of the content. I saw probably 70% of it, though, and the other 30% was the stuff I was less interested in (quests for the opposing faction, some professions, classes I wasn't interested in). There was some content I never got to (the most difficult raiding dungeon).
---
Great! Come back and play after a few weeks when they remove it.
---
Blizzard is so afraid of a dynamic respawn system. I don't really know why though. They already have a very small dynamic respawn system that moves mobs from 5 minute respawns to 3 minute respawns. This was already tested by Monkeynews on the both the stress test and beta client.
---
I think you misunderstood the point of my original post, then. It wasn't "WAAH SOMEBODY MAKE THESE BADDIES GO AWAY BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING!!!1!!1!" It was a commentary on my experience with the game. People will do and say whatever they want, and if I don't like it I'm free to not play.
---
I'm not going to fall in line and fawn over every aspect of the game. I see no problem with bringing up criticisms.
---
Killing one side boss in BRD is not tackling BRD ;) you wont kill the emperor as a rogue solo. The torch event you mean the Lyseum thing? Yes, you can open the gate but then what? Dungeon bosses in vanilla are not difficult. The trash packs are the hardest.
---
yes it is
---
yes! good catch! their employees caught that too! which is why you have read already about the 10 servers being consolidated into only two choices!  it is almost like the server techs have a job to test the servers under high stress loads! holy shit those server techs are so smart! they should get jobs as server techs!
---
&gt; I put at least six individuals on ignore in just those few hours
---
The problem is you
---
What's your magical answer to the problem then? I'd rather deal with this than not be able to play at all because I'm sitting in a server queue
---
It releases at the same instant for the entire world. Due to time zones, it will be the 26th in the US while the 27th in Europe.
---
&gt;3. Dynamic spawns, before I played I was fervent that this shouldn't be a thing, and I still don't think it should be a thing for 99% of the zones. That being said, I wouldn't mind Dynamic spawns within the 1-5 zones for atleast the first month of actual release
---
This is what makes your opinions invalid... respawns should not be different at any part of the game. It wasn't for vanilla and shouldn't be for classic.
---
Their respawns this stress test are perfect- much better than the first 2 stress tests.
---
Hopefully this is how it will be in 67 days.
---
women pog
---
its the player numbers and potential for revenue that got their attention not an online web form lol
---
Well not exactly the same thing. Private servers don't attract nearly the crowd the classic launch will. Regardless, there are far better ways to handle this than sharding with the nickname layering.
---
I was on 15 also, in the human starting zone; it was absolutely awful. Left at level 3ish because the bandana and laborers quests were legitimately impossible to get done and everything outside was dead, too. There were no boars, no wolves, no defias. Every now and then I killed something.
---
I noticed the layering happening, though; everyone around me despawned and mobs spawned on top of me. Some people died due to this in the mine(s). I was finally able to get a tag (but then other players layered in so it was back to fierce competition).
---
You would probably find hanging out with high schoolers not very fun, but when you were a high schooler I bet it was a blast.
---
You  grew up. Young people are almost always dumb and annoying when you grow up. lol
---
Blizzard doesn't think France or Germany can sustain even 1 server and you think all of Europe can sustain 10?
---
One of my guildies had a Gratz macro that was all fancy looking. They were my fave.
---
If I remember correctly, a guy in my Vanilla guild got a talking to from a GM about doing that repeatedly.
---
how will layering help with that ? your layer will be full anyway its no difference than a full server with queue time
---
Still lots of assumptions. They could just keep layering up past phase 1. They could also add queues. They could also split the server.
---
I am not saying they will do any of that. But you seem to assume they *couldn’t*.
---
Keep in mind they will have queues as well to make the scenario you are describing less likely. I agree *it will happen* on one of the servers. But Blizzard might decide against turning those into 15k pop super servers.
---
It was, but it was usually a clusterfuck of lag and the only reward was bragging rights so it happened very infrequently.
---
Oh, and the shoulder pads will come. I think they start showing up around 15-20th level, and get bigger and more ornate as you go - and paladins have some of the coolest ones. Take a look at one of the iconic sets of Paladin class armor from the endgame raids here:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=217/judgement-armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=217/judgement-armor)
---
That's not how the market works. Supply vs demand. Economy 101? People are going out in the world and find lotuses while doing other activities, the materials aren't going to stop coming in just because they're worth less. Layering also isn't forever, and the smart players (and those abusing this know this already) will be thinking long term. Once layering is gone, you're back down to 1x resources, but they still farmed at 5x rates for weeks or even months.
---
The entire guild goes on the same layer...
---
The AP from buffs scale correctly on pets in Classic (and incorrectly on pservers), which is why pets end up doing more damage in Classic. 
---
Thanks for your sarcastic comment that adds nothing to the discussion though.
---
ALWAYS
---
I want to give you an award because that's exactly right.  
---
The only way to have layering "disabled" for some level range would be to have all the levelN+ players on the mega-server crammed into a single layer (so you login and are level 31-60? You are stickied to Layer1) and all lower levels spread around however many other layers exist on the server.
---
Power word pain prevented that. If i remember correctly dots couldn't be removed until BC when they got cloak of shadows. It would dump agro but they be pulled out next tick and be read for another pain and mind control.
---
The real new thing is the other people trying to be 'woke' while calling everyone toxic and attempting to control speech.
---
If you're node farming exploiting do you give a fuck what layer you're on as long as it's different? Imagine being a Blizzard bootlicker. Yikes
---
They essentially did this during the stress test too. Had 12 servers and whittled away the low pop ones until there were 1 or 2 left
---
It was a thing, but it was purely for fun.
---
However people were reluctant as you would always have people in raids killing NPC's that gave DK's. No hardcore PVPer wanted to get DK's.
---
So you'd have a main raid of YOLO's and if geared players wanted to go they'd generally form their own 5-10 mans of people they trusted not to screw them on DK's.
---
Was for fun and this brings a good point up - would I rather raid an enemy city for the 4th time? Or log off and play something else? I'm inclined to believe it's the second choice, especially considering how many quality games there are to play nowadays.
---
Disagree.  You people are more  worried about a streamer getting 2 black lotuses than 100,000 people being unable to log in or find mobs to kill.  Have some perspective
---
First days will make or break the experience for some but not all. If they cant play on release. They'll play bfa and then come back later.
---
I’ll bring it up to him, he had mentioned wanting to try a night elf rogue and druid is near the top of my list alongside shaman and paladin.
---
Well, there's never been a dedicated Polish server and we somehow live. 
---
[Time to step up](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/987/overcome.jpg)
---
Yea this is one of those things that NEEDS to be fixed BEFORE launch, not after a bunch of people have abused it.
---
You could just leave the channel. You're not going to change it, people like to bs and joke around in those channels and it's never going to stop.
---
nope, im still eating the member berries
---
I don't see why everyone think DKP is going to be such a huge thing, it was a dumbfuck thing the community carried over from EverQuest and barely survived TBC before everyone realized it was stupid. Realistically every guild worth a damn is just going to use a loot council like on live.
---
You don't wear headphones?
---
Yea mulgore is too spread out to do much in a short window.
---
"Hey, let's do the stress test only for US people who are subbed to the game and at a time when most people are working."
---
What a nice idea.
---
basically there are only 3 hit box sizes.
---
Male Tuaren, Femail Tauren, and Everyone else.
---
Gnomes, humans, dwarves, nigh elfs, both genders all have the same size hit box.
---
I’m still excited. Maybe it’s just nostalgia but I’m going to give it a shot.
---
When enough people are on the same continent at once, the world clones itself and splits the player base in 2, this continues u til there aren't too many players in any given layer. Guilds and parties will remain on the same layer, however.
---
Nothing has changed, they just want a reason to bitch. If 20 out of 1000 players are talking to each other about Trump or some political shit, and that makes you not want to play the game... You probably just aren't enjoying the game.
---
“Killing NPCs caused you to lose PvP Honor and rank so hardcore PvPers will lose a lot of rank just by raiding a town alone.”
---
Dishonorable kills are very easy to avoid in groups that have good leadership, hardcore PvPers will do this with each other but not with non-hardcore players due to the risk, from what I’ve seen on pservers
---
I really don't want sharding or layering, I am happy with lag and disconnects, it makes it more true to every patch/expansion release I experienced when I was younger. 
---
Sharding is easily one of the worst aspects of Retail and one of the worst ideas they ever had, makes the game feel less like a world and more single player.
---
It was not fun to have my server crashing, laggy, unplayable, down for days, huge queues to log in. I have over a month of free days on my account because Vanilla was so unstable. That was the experience of the majority of players. Everyone else ended up on a dead/empty server and couldn't raid or do BGs most of the time.
---
So no, that's not an experience I'd want to relive.
---
I hope I’m wrong and you’re right, but I think Blizzards closer to releasing 5-6 servers *with the would-be population of 10 servers*.
---
Why the constant hurry to go fast and be productive? Are we not doing that enough in our jobs?
---
There's so much enjoyment in organizing and finding solutions with our peers, to be victor and yell it out loud! 
---
"Do not ask what the game can do for you, but ask yourself what you can do about it." ;)
---
*that never buffs
---
I see an enemy and I contemplate will I just run away and do another quest, or try to run to the opposite side of the camp to kill quest mobs from the enemy player?  Those kind of decisions make it feel more complete.  Are they saving their cooldowns for PVP and will end the fight will low HP?  Or are they going to use them to clean up the over pull they have committed to?
---
Thanks.  Very cool.
---
[Classic Druid Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/uscwdeP)
---
They are talking about it in the feral section and are still number crunching so the things may change but it sounds like cats lost 7-9 dps but that doesn't change that much.
---
C'est de la merde de tout mélanger. Vive la FRANCE et la BAGUETTE !
---
The only thing I find bad about the kiddos nowadays is the twitch emotes they like to use, which really isn't any different than 1337sp34k.
---
I remember refusing to mount while heading somewhere for a quest. I’d just kill everything on the way to the quest. It took a long time to get to the quest area but i was leveling pretty quick
---
Its extremely exploitable, I've watched a few clips of people farming the same node by logging out, then into another toon, then back into the first one and the node was back because they were put on a different layer. 
---
Then we also have the clips of people farming multiple Arena Master charms by group hopping or logging out and back in to get to a different layer.
---
It needs to be removed, or only in for the starting zones and when you leave the initial 1-5/10 area its no longer in effect. Sort of like the phasing they have in current wow when you reach a certain point in the story ( except its tied to the specific area and when you leave it you are in the open native server )
---
well the horde needs to stick together 
---
lest the alliance overwhelm us
---
As always, For the Horde
---
I think this is great! The more people who don't play an otherwise awesome game for reasons as dumb as this will actually mean layering goes away even faster!
---
Never happened to me once. My friend and I tried to do it as often as we did WSG together - so at least a few times a week. Maybe lucky?
---
I did get a suspension (not a silence, a full on 3day ban) for calling someone an asshole in trade chat though. Literally that - i said "you're an asshole", i got reported, and GM confirmed this was the reason. Rules were different back then.
---
Undead female are the smallest
---
&gt; Europe is probably looking at 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP at launch.
---
Man I've seen some real dumb posts today but this one takes the cake.
---
he said starting zones, though. There aren't any dungeons in the starting zones
---
I played horde and someone gave me 100g. I played Alliance and somebody pickpocketed me
---
:(
---
I genuinely can't fathom the outrage about it on this sub, use your fucking brains ffs. Layering, while it's not good for the game it's still a counter measure in place to prevent a much more harmful problem which is realms dying when the inevitable population drop off happens when all of the tourists and retail players who were just popping in to see what the fuss is about decide to quit. 
---
Nothing will kill the game quicker than having a load of dead ass realms with low player count considering that vanilla's main selling point is that it does the community side of things really well which will be greatly diminished on a low/med pop realm. I'll happily take some small bullshit like this happening throughout phase 1 if it guarentee's me the safety of having a strong and stable server population made up of dedicated long term classic advocates.
---
They wouldn't split servers.
---
EXACTLY THIS.  If a layer exists, that means that BOTH are filled with people.  Why would a resource magically exist in one layer when it's being farmed by 100 people in the other?  You're seeing fringe effects of streamers with a ton of people to take their time and work out who's on what layer.  If everyone in your guild and on your friendslist is on one layer, how are you going to get random people in /1 to figure out which you're on and who is on the other to swap with.
---
This has nothing to do with wow or the race you  chose this is a side effect of modern society old man, enjoy playing checkers or whatever it is you find socially isolating enough to play without getting upset
---
There is no maximum player count with Layering. They can make as many Layers as they want. We've seen up to 8 per continent now, so that's 56,000 per server. That can server ~300,000 in Europe (not counting RP).
---
But yeah, Blizzard must think a majority of them will quit. Because after Layering is removed, that drops to 21,000.
---
Slightly out-level the zone, making mobs easier to kill and enemy players will be slightly lower level on average. You'll still get killed by skilled players of lower level though. Friends are good.
---
Warsong EU was Russian. Also Sovietmaul after the free migration.
---
It really is sharding yeah. They seem to think the whole issue for us with sharding is that npcs and players can disappear. But that’s almost a non-issue for me. All the other problems with it (especially room for exploitation and the effect on the community) far outweigh that.
---
If they release the game like this, the economies will be irreparably fucked within two weeks. A few parties will have so much wealth that they can control so many markets.
---
If you learn how to make your own, you can also give/sell them to other players. This will be especially nice when you're able to make 10+ slot bags.
---
Tauren or troll pve tank what do you guy think is better ?
---
I've been enjoying it.
---
One thing I did not expect is seeing certain terrains and having flashbacks. Mostly seeing a certain area and going "there's a rare mob here" and remembering camping it for whatever reason.
---
I expect I'll have a lot of those. It's wild to me how quickly just having my camera in a certain spot can trigger memories from so long ago.
---
Pretty much.  I've had people here essentially tell me I'm too casual and don't deserve to play if I'm not able to dedicate some variable length of time to sitting in hours-long queues.
---
You’re right, but he is saying there will need to be a variety of realms (PVP, PVE, RP, maybe RP-PVP). They won’t make one realm of each for each language because that’s just looking for low server population problems. Then different language servers get merged and it starts with the original problem.
---
I only really member the times I spent with friends and rivals. The world itself doesn't interest me that much, just the community.
---
Well u can say that about every meme,netflix show ,game coming post 2004 tldr: times change
---
I mean if you even get two Thunderfurys. 
---
My guild got lucky though, our first clear of MC as a guild both bindings dropped.
---
Then like a year later on a weekly farm raid another binding dropped and we gave it to a rogue that left the guild like 2 months later, we never saw the other binding drop before BC came though anyway.
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
You can tell this guy is alliance through and through.
---
Its not being a blizzard boot licker honestly, people just want proof. I've saw the click of Venruki exploiting to get the 2nd Gurubashi Arena trinket in one spawn but he didn't follow the method above. If the method MonkeyNews is saying exists he could have taken the extra 30 seconds to show the exploit.
---
People aren't defending blizzard they are holding out until they SEE evidence of the exploit, rather than some streamer talking about it.
---
Westfall chicken
---
I'm sure they'll open it up in July before it goes down before release.
---
It is new. People like you either didn't play back then and want to act like you did, or can't remember. Toxic back then was "you suck alt F4". Toxic now is "omegalul poggers go kill yourself autism piece of garbage, your family hates you and you should get cancer and die".

Are there any addons that display the enemy’s cast bar above their unit frame?
---
Wishful thinking.
---
You’re missing the point; this entire video is predicated on *THAT VERY THING* - being able to choose your layer. 
---
Of course if you’re node farming you don’t care, and why would you? You can’t affect the outcome in the first place - which is *exactly my point*. 
---
The lack of critical thinking you keyboard warriors can muster is truly astounding...
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
You are expecting something that cannot be experienced again, you already know a lot about the game and those memories prevent you from acquiring new ones. It's not the game's fault, the game is offering a nearly similar experience but what we enjoyed the first time it's difficult to replicate, focus on the experiences or things that can be replicated like meeting new friends or obtaining pieces of gear, not so much in finding unknown quests to you since you already did that.
---
tldr: focus on the experiences that can be new and don't waste too much time into what cannot be replaced in your brain

Weird, I didn't know "Overcrowding" started with the letter "M". The game clearly isn't designed to have hundreds of people in the starters zones at the same time.

Would you happen to know if a spreadsheet like that already exists? I.E. important items to collect or specific pathing for quest routes? Or were you just stating something that he would make himself?

If you give up on a game because some very sad individuals spam Political views; You may be a very sad and weak individual yourself. Until Classic comes out, there isn't much you can do, and it is a bummer to see. I'm imagining they spewed more than just simple mentions and probably involved very ugly wording. You can or should be able to report them right? Not sure if they have logs, but it'd be weird if they didn't. It would not be surprising if they just didn't want to act on it 'because beta' though. Otherwise yeah I guess your only answer is to ignore them. 
---
Once Classic  is out, Report. Ignore. Move on. Make NOTE of the issue too, in case you run into them later in the game and forget. For instance, if they try to join your guild way way down the road. Server reputation is a thing, and they'll be haunted for it. Especially since there are associated [Battle.](https://Battle.NET)net IDs and it's no longer just a Character Name only situation. I'm sure they're a mixture of Retail snobs who have to let everyone know "bliz classic bad guys", Trolls that just stir the pot, and people who just love to hate things and get a following. I agree that politics has poisoned a lot of things we love, but just because some squeebs won't stfu in general chat, doesn't mean you should discount the entire game. If that's the case, you should just get off of the internet using that same logic. My roots are also in Vanilla/Classic, but I've always just used the tools provided by Blizz to clean up messy situations like that and otherwise never look back.
---
Nothing in the game tells you what layer you're on.
---
It's almost like they did the stress test during business hours for their dev team.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
They should have layering go after 1 week
---
You're the one who replied to him. He said he wasn't sure if he wanted that starting experience and you said "if you're not playing for the classic experience why play?" I was simply saying in his mind classic experience isn't the same as the starting/launch experience.
---
Oh friend me.   I'll tell you exactly were I am.   I have no worries.
---
&gt;Why do you believe that, all of these things are possible on retail wow too... If they were gonna change or fix it it would already be fixed.
---
Best news since a long time !
---
Okay, I'll take the next fresh pserver, sorry Blizz. I have an active subscription and wanted to have it active much longer into Classic, but this decision simply triggers me.
---
I would definitely not wait
---
huehuehue
---
Always thought officer-assigned loot worked the best assuming your officers weren't fuckwits who took more than they should've.
---
It's the opposite, people want to fight more mobs.
---
Ah, right. I forgot about that restriction.
---
Mage, Warlock or healer. Shadow priest is also extremely strong but finding pve groups as a sp will be more difficult
---
&gt; doubt he sincerely likes everything and every decision about modern WoW either
---
the guy is literally the game director?
---
The entire guild is on one layer, more proof you have no idea how it works. You just want to complain. The videos you see are from beta where blizzard is FORCING layers to test the functionality. Again.....read...research...anything....stop watching fucking streamer clips.
---
They are 100% identical to vanilla...
---
I don't know a single person in real life who knows the meaning of Twitch emotes. The only people who know the meaning behind Twitch emotes are Twitch chat users, who number in the hundreds of thousands, and World of Warcraft has millions of users.
---
Also, what do boomers have to do with this? Most millennials I'd say have no idea what Twitch-speak words mean. Leetspeak was our thing.
---
Dunno why the downvotes, I chuckled.
---
Which is fine as long as you're not on DKP.
---
I remember doing an MC farm run as an audition for a progression guild. 4 Cenarion drops that night. They didn't *really* want to give 'em to me, but they knew how rude it'd be to DE them. So they charged me DKP. At the end of the run, I was informed I was 210 DKP in the hole. "So if I join you guys, I owe you a month of full-time work? ...Thanks for the gear, good luck with your auditions."
---
Whatever it takes.
---
If the entire 1-60 is layered, then no. I get why we need layering to an extent, but 1-60 is overkill. I wish we had the original plan Blizz presented to us in Blizzcon ‘18, with sharding starting zones, and not putting a non-Vanilla server mechanic over the entire leveling experience. Also, it could be two weeks, but they’ve certainly been smart enough to leave the wording open, to the point where it could last the entirety of phase one if it must.
---
I hope I remember it, once Classic starts. ;x
---
Yeah dude. It's gonna be a total clusterfuck, and that's how it should be. None of this "well, we want players to be able to quest" shit. If I have to stand there and shoot the breeze in general chat while waiting for boars to spawn I say the game is all the better for it.
---
Thanks alot bud
---
how would that work? no one above 30 can group or see people below 30? 
---
you cant have someone transcend layers tech doesnt work that way
---
It certainly seemed like a quick money grab. I'm wondering if they'll extend it into the weekend to collect more subs
---
Yes, absolutely. That's how every data center works today. They might get a nice rate to prevent them shopping around for a competitor's quote, but they'll still be paying for Classic servers.
---
Definitely not "essentially nonexistent" as you put it with your I-want-you-to-think-I-know-what-I'm-talking-about-language-but-I-really-don't "big" words.
---
Doesnt have to be crunch. It means shifting the schedule this week. This is reasonable. They still work their 40 hours just this week they get two weekdays off and work a weekend.
---
Yeah, fortunately it doesn’t take much to run wow. I remember the toaster I used to play on, but I want to ability to do other things in the future such as streaming, podcasting, and video editing. I’m trying to get into the personal trainer career space. Plus, I spent a lot of hours working a second job to earn the money, I want to get something at least middle of the line for my efforts.
---
&gt; I'm not giving up on it yet, but I'm probably not going to roll another human in Classic.
---
The human are is typically the worst. If you want to play a human paladin create one and then take the tram to Ironforge and do the dwarf starting zone. Dwarves can be paladins also so you'll have the right trainer there.
---
There's always morons in chat. My main retail char character must have a thousand characters on her ignore list. Politics in chat -&gt; ignore. Racism in chat -&gt; report, ignore. Anal jokes in chat -&gt; ignore.
---
Even so, the inconvenience in this very specific circumstance is still far outweighed by the benefits realized in limiting the abuse of the system in my opinion.
---
Gear lifetime is barely a stones throw away from the current azerite armor system and is a major fail point of bfa
---
Thats a horrible change imo and only gives disadvantages, would very much hope too see them change their mind regarding this.
---
I cannot imagine how sad it must be for some new player to realize they are on a unofficial "X" server after playing for a long time and maybe even quitting because of it
---
Just because *you'd* take 30 minute queues doesn't mean everyone else would and Blizzard clearly favors quality of life in this instance. Queues were never a vanilla experience beyond the first month and when servers went down. Certainly not in 1.12
---
I completely agree, but I can't see it happening.  
---
The people who want to peacefully discuss the big issues are outnumbered by the people who want to let their emotions take over the topic.
---
Perhaps the configuration file is set as read only by your system for some reason?
---
Don't try logic. It doesn't work on his kind.
---
Same as 2004-2006. Word.
---
Not offended, just got tired of playing Ignore Whack-A-Mole.
---
And like I said, we'll see what happens after release.
---
I think this would be the best approach but it mist likely won't happen
---
How is layering going to affect world buffs? I remember things like nef’s head only being able to be turned once every 2 hours for the entire server.
---
Could an entire raid group manipulate layering so they can work around that lockout timer and get their world buffs whenever they want?
---
After 14% parry on raid bosses, more REALITY CHECK for Druids that wanna be Main Tanks.
---
Just understand people...it's not going to happen. The most you can hope for is a 3rd OT spot. 
---
If that.
---
Of course.
---
From what I've seen, they're not. The graphics engine looks updated. If that's tree only difference, though, I don't mind.
---
This is the same in any other field as well. What makes people think they have the answers without the knowledge is beyond me
---
They have a reference 1.12.1 client so they have confirmed that the current damage/hp/armor values are correct. It’s just super ez mode in the starting zones
---
This, and your vanish needs to be off cooldown and you need to time it correctly
---
It can be hard, yeah. The trouble is finding 40 *competent* people who can all show up at the same time regularly. 
---
If you have too many, you'll end up having to bench people and/or form "A team" and "B team", but nobody wants to be on the B team, regardless, because they clear less stuff and get less loot.
---
It isn't
---
So go somewhere else to grind mobs? I didn't do half of the starting zone quests because the place was overpopulated, so I just went and did something else. The first 5-10 levels go super fast whether you do the quests or just kill a few mobs.
---
I haven't seen a single person argue the exploits shouldn't be fixed, or at least limited in some way.
---
Correct. Scaling I mentioned is specifically involving VM's. And what you described "shutting down and spinning up VM's" is called horizontal scaling.
---
That is how modern wow works (and basically everything on the web these days) specifically because of layering/sharding tech. To have everyone on the same "world" without any sharding or layering would require vertical scaling of each individual VM. That is why it's more costly.
---
I might have explained myself poorly but current wow does indeed use horizontal scaling.
---
"Each VM is the same cost" is why horizontal scaling is linear
---
People expected servers for their own language, they don't get anything close.
---
So they're expectation for an abundance of servers to pick from is out the window too.
---
2 PVP, 2 PVE, 1 RP. That's what Europe will get.
---
People make the same argument over and over and over and over....
---
Seeing as putting thought into it is beyond their means they go with PASSION!
---
Well yea, it's on the new engine.
---
&gt; Mate, it's a Beta
---
hahahahaha
---
its like youre unironically copying the famous DUDE ITS JUST BETA meme
---
this sub jesus christ
---
Send me a message, tell me what realm you roll on, I'll come remind you.
---
Yeah I was just trying to point out EPGP has its own problems just like DKP. Never saw a guild using discounted bidding tho, seems to solve lots of problems. I agree for a casual or semihardcore guild EPGP is still the best option. But for a hardcore guild i guess there's no way to go other than council. A good council has loot planned down before even going into a tier so you know what you will get and when you will get it(kinda, depends on rng). But everyone needs to be on board and trust the council, also the council shouldn't abuse their power and show favoritism.
---
UD? Everyone goes there. Even on a dead ps I had to wait to even kill plainstriders, not to mention other quests. Now, I imagine on a classic server I probably won't get to kill anything for 5-10 mins per mob.
---
What’s wrong with the description?
---
When I did this as a warrior on private servers I just bought good boots off the AH and kept them.  +1 extra strength or stam isn't really a good trade for the utility provided by +8% move speed.
---
So just move general chat to another tab or leave the channel...
---
There were large Danish pops on Stormscale and Ravencrest
---
Nope, we're just getting older, not a bad thing. I'd still rather play WoW on weekends than go out golfing or whatever else it is middle-aged people are supposed to do for fun these days.
---
As others said in this thread, they probably only had data for level 60 druids and had to guess a bit through the levels. But your claim that "We have Vanilla data" is false and you are too lazy to go do research to realise that.
---
Go through some of the comments on this thread. Some people said they don’t care if it’s fixed or not
---
Not really interested in typing it out for the hundredth time. You can look it up for yourself if you're interested.
---
&gt; Sorry brother, I have no clue what good times are for alliance because I’m a man and not a high school girl. =) 
---
oof!
---
I don't know yet, I don't even have an account yet. 🤔
---
I would pick orc for the stun resist. Also the pvp trinket for warlock removes fear/charm/polymorph I believe, and not stun. So as undead you'd have 2 options for charm/fear removal with pvp trinket and WotF but no stun removal. So I'd value the orc stun resist higher.
---
of course lol, who in this world would play alliance.. gotta be an absolute retard
---
Been a few years since Europe's had a "general war" Too long for Blizzards tastes apparently. lol
---
&gt; Allowing everyone from retail to come sightseeing in for no extra money a month seems like an open invitation to tourists. 
---
How does it affect you if someone plays the game more casually or only plays for a little bit. This would also happen with a separate sub. It just seems like gate-keeping at this point honestly.
---
Layering made the stress test feel lonely. I'd rather have the "massive" in my MMORPG than a watered down single player experience. Yeah it's hectic and fucked up, and it can be frustrating if you want to go solo, but that's what I'm willing to pay for.
---
They suggested sharding the starting zones back in November, loooong before layering was even a term.
---
It's great during the commute to work.  I don't listen any other time.  By the time I finish one episode the next one is usually out or coming out the next day or 2.
---
Private servers with populations of 300k active players and 12k online still have a lot of casual players, and Im pretty sure they are the same kind of people. Casual players are the ones that dont mind if something takes a bit longer, its the hardcore ones that want to hit 60 in a week, they are the ones that would be affected the most if layering would be removed.
---
What is making you think that Classic Wows casual players are so wimpy they cant handle small setbacks. Its only TOO crowded untill lvl 20 after that its not so bad.
---
I loved it back in Vanilla, but it was my first MMO, and my first RPG and I kinda feel like I sucked pretty hard back then.  I'm very, very much looking forward to exploring the game knowing what I know now, and being massively more competent.
---
Also, the world alone isn't the only draw for me.  The gameplay, mechanics, models, questing, dungeons and raids and exceptional.  I have played retail for all but about half of MoP since Vanilla release, and I haven't had as much fun in current WoW as I've had in the last two stress tests in years.
---
&gt; The old servers were literal physical systems. 
---
What do you think the new servers are, magic?
---
Actually, every single popular MMO released in the past 5+ years does something similar to this. Just look at Destiny.
---
I wouldn't say it's awesome, but I'm definitely indifferent. Don't really care about the game economy. Don't really care about interacting with random people (other than guild). I guess ignoring a few less random people along the leveling path ruins the game for some people.
---
Oh a private server hero?
---
Yea I think merging servers is much better than the alternatives.
---
I believe the main reason blizzard stopped it was because it causes a drop in revenue from server transfers.
---
What's the point of posting this ? A lot of spoken languages in the   US but about 80% speak a common language, english. That's not the case for the [entirety of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population).
---
What? Where do you think the idea of "revenue potential" or "player numbers" came from?
---
When it comes to realm mergers you're at the mercy of Blizz if they decide that you're realm is low enough for it. What usually happens is that they just open up free realm transfers from higher pop realms which barely helps. 
---
They're not going to merge 2 medium pop realms for example, and when it comes to Vanilla I and many others do not want to be stuck playing on a med pop server, we want to play on High pop servers where the world PvP is rampant, community is alive &amp; kicking and there's always people to play with even outside of peak hours which is almost never obtainable on low/med pop realms.
---
 /who on one side and knowing the general faction balance, eg if its 50% horde 50% alliance and its 700 alliance players online its 1400 total, if we for some reason know the layer size it would be quite possible and easy enough if they dont do anything specific about it when layers are created as more players come home from work
---
It will still be packed on each layer
---
It also boils down to “these noobs will be able to escape me ganking them for hours in STV! REEEEEEE” 
---
Newsflash: no one cares that you feel your lvl 46 rogue is devalued because he can’t tanked all day in STV.
---
They are never going to have 100k people on one server. That’s insane.
---
Ah voilà mes français, j'espère que vous allez vous faire entendre par blizzard et les flame à mort parce que ils demandent qu'une chose aux français : "parlez anglais mdr" alors qu'on sait tous que la moitié sera toxique de fou
---
Thanks, I was really starting to get concerned.
---
Tauren Rogue for me
---
I've hated kids since I was one of them.
---
Name repeats is why blizzard just doesnt merge all current servers right now. 
---
Having battlwtag at the end of the name is annoying af and totally immersion breaking. And forcing people to change name is a dick move  
---
Having a bit of layering isnt going to ruin the game, its going to save it in long term. If you want a ghost town im sure there will still be some private servers still going. 
---
They arent going to screw over 80% of the fanbase to cater to 5% of the people who are totally fine with dead servers.
---
Found The kid
---
^ so much this. They've proven numerous times that they don't deserve trust anymore and rising hell on twitter+forums+reddit is the only way to get them to acknowledge problems exist(and even then they're likely to say "just deal with it" just like they did with legendary droprates)
---
I stopped going to Facebook when trump won. I feel that was a solid mental health choice
---
Lol fair enough
---
LMAO...what data they have for lvl 58 Druids????????????????
---
Beta is capped at 40.
---
It's all BS, to keep the Druid tank "flame" alive.
---
Sorry, but we are getting Vanilla. And in Vanilla, Druids don't tank.
---
I got a three day ban for telling someone "I will scoop out your eyes with a spoon and use the jelly inside as lube to fuck your mother" after he stole a chest I had cleared out a camp of elites to get to.
---
I think yours was worse though.
---
A huge amount of the experience you get from quests is from killing the mobs for the quest. Also, as a tip for anyone starting with Human, the wolves in Elewynn also drop that quest item.
---
What a kind and wholesome comment
---
Well now I'm reconsidering Orc Warrior for Tauren Warrior.
---
I think I turned it off immediately. I found all the sound effects annoying. That was 14 years ago though so hard to say. I just know I'm not familiar with these noises people are referencing.
---
Well first of all retail uses *sharding* and actually has seperate servers interacting. Secondly the implementation of simple rules such as not being able to choose who switches layers or layer switching restrictions (time or occurance based) pretty much negate most benefits especially with layers going away by phase two. Blizzard will have those things in place and I fully expect a blue post about these concerns sometime in the coming days.
---
Layering is the entire continent, not individual zones.
---
That's how you date yourself with a reference.
---
Merging servers is the worst thing you can do and anyone should highly oppose it.
---
I learned from leveling to 60 recently on a PS and realized after a few months of 60, leveling was tons more fun than the end game :P not rushing at all this time
---
This has been addressed a million times
---
Hardware and network resources are significantly more capable today than they were back then.
---
You could absolutely do the AQ event without lag today if you wanted to throw the resources at it.
---
People really don't appreciate how cheaply Activision runs WOW. They give it as few resources as possible because it's all about the bottom line for them.
---
If you weren't an idiot you would understand that Blizzard made a decision based on the data they have and tools they have at their disposal. Since you admitted you don't know, your opinion on the matter is useless.
---
&gt; a lot of people disliked that characters had the server name included in their character name.
---
Well that is already happening in whispers for Classic.
---
So, World of Warcraft?
---
Everyone whines about their language left w/o personal server, meanwhile Russians on many forums and in chats whine about that reservation they are put in
---
Stun resist not OP at all
---
I said this to a friend a while back. People find ways of doing stuff like this always.. I'd rather have a shitty launch with no layering than a launch that sets a precedence with layering.
---
AV server? Are you going to compare a lvl 58 druid damage in DUELS?
---
We cant make everyone happy and I'd rather have a functional launch without layers then making sure that a competition about who is first to 60 gets to do it.   
---
But that can perhaps still be incorporated, I'm not planning on playing on on exact minute on launch and will start playing at 04:00, It might be possible to signup to be released with the first wave for the ones that care about absolutely first, then 10 minutes later or 20 those that dont care for the competition but want to get on it as quickly as possible.   
---
Its far from impossible to ask players that already have planned what the will do and perhaps get a solution by having the players organise themselves along a que system, while open to abuse its hardly a bigger problem then everyone wants to go at launch if some are ok to wait 20 min - 6 hours.   
---
I dont need access at 12:00, perhaps blizzard can communicate and let those of us that already knows who we'll be playing with, when and how.
---
yeah but russians are cancer and no one likes them in their community, they are almost as bad as the french only excluding themselves.
---
Well, Classic isn’t for everyone.  Retail is a great option for people who need their hand held.
---
Is this an out of Season April Fools Joke?
---
That defeats the point of [nappies](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jJB2TdpUL._SY355_.jpg). :)
---
The unofficial server didn't happen overnight, it took a long time to build up the population and a lot of people was forced to reroll to join the servers.
---
Most people who played in vanilla knows what server to join, but it's going to suck for new players who don't know they need to ask on the forums before joining a server. Many people just pick a random server only to find out a month later they are playing on the wrong server.
---
I don’t quite understand. What is layering and what is the point?
---
To this day I can’t understand why faction leaders wouldn’t drop badass loot. Seems like such a massive missed opportunity
---
Thats actually gamer prime time in most of eu...
---
&gt;  I didn't do half of the starting zone quests because the place was overpopulated, so I just went and did something else.
---
That the solution is to not do the content is a bit telling of the problem in general yea?
---
I'm starting to lose hope in how blizz will handle classic at this point. :(
---
I'm OK with compromising 4 hour queues and disconnecting every 15 minutes in the first 32 hours of release if it means I don't get the complete authentic experience
---
I always liked the savage misfits aspect of horde since wc3, but starting wow seeing it overrun by elves bothers me more than it should. I play horde in retail(almost all my alts are goblin or tauren, never touched a dh only because they are elves), and I really want to experience the og Horde and og Org. So alliance was never an option for me, and old horde is exactly what I wanted. Only problem is my retail guild wants to go ally and I really wanna play a shaman... Guess I got a find a new home in my new home.
---
I dont believe it. I am 99% certain blizzard doesnt merge servers because they think of it as a waste of time and it would cost them money.  
---
Saving the game just like its saving retail? You know the game with less than 2m total subs? Yeah sure dude
---
Its like they could pay them for their troubles and get a better result which you can have better feedback with, maybe take a second and think about how ridiculous it is that they have stress test at times where probably a majority cant even test?
---
NO CHANGES = CHAOS
---
As you know, fun is quite subjective. You may not have fun doing what you described but I feel that I will tbh.
---
8.0.5 Should've been the vendor then. It's really wasn't that hard to temp fix BfA and make it less shit until later patches address problems instead of leaving it shit for half of the expansion.
---
Oh really? I mean lets say the hype is insane and 5 million jump on opening week that's 50 servers of 100k caps do you think blizz is going to have 50 servers at launch? They would need 500 to get it down to 10k per you think they will have 500? It has the potential to be this insane...
---
&gt; Now I know a lot of that is nastolgia goggles
---
Honestly after playing the Classic stress test, it just isn't. I had more fun chatting with randoms in General chat while waiting for kobolds to spawn than I have in all of BfA *BY FAR*.
---
This gets posted all the time
---
It's the new Coca-Cola logo
---
It's easier to cut-off layering than it is to consolidate servers, and IMO it would be far less disruptive. If I have the option of playing with all the people on my server, yet might not see them in my layer every time I log in during the initial launch, that seems a bit better than a bunch of new people being smooshed together into what will now be a completely new server community (killing whatever one was popping up initially).
---
Another issue I have with solving the problem with more Realms is that you'll likely run into the same problem as launch, in that people will pretty much consolidate themselves onto the high-pop servers as best they can. No one wants to risk ending up on a dead server, so whatever servers benefit most from the initial rush, will likely be the ones to continue seeing growth. Then the ones left to be consolidated will be merged, but that doesn't actually guarantee a healthy and thriving server will come out of those merges. My server was connected to 2 other realms on Live, we went from 3 low-pop servers to 1-medium pop server, then back down to low. Because if you aren't high or full on the realm list, not enough people want to join your realm to keep it healthy long-term.
---
You realize that is what societies are founded upon, right?
---
The game isn't even out yet.  At worst, the sky looks ominous and a bit wobbly.  It very well might fall, but it isn't actually falling yet.
---
Its like a mini server that you can just between. Where there is alot more flexibility. 
---
Someone else had an idea that i really liked. When you create your character you choose "realm name, layer number" so those who want to play with their friends still can. Those who want to abuse layering system cant. And those who dont want to deal with a dead realm in 2 years wont have to. As layers merge when players start being less active.
---
I’m saying there’s gonna be at least 5million Subscribers to classic WoW
---
This is a terrible news. It will be a giant mess, everyone spamming world chat in their own language. As a French player, I'm so disapointed that Blizzard think there won't be enough French players to make a dedicated French realm. I can't believe it. I'm sure it killed the hype for a huge amount of French players, not everyone is proficient in English or willing to play in an English environment. Personally I'm used to it, as you can see I'm on Reddit but I'm a minority, most of French players don't even know what Reddit is for example, we use our own media.
---
this sucks but tbh spanish people and italian people etc can all speak english just speak fucking english online
---
Yeah, thats probably it.
---
WoD was silky smooth when I loaded it up 4h after launch. I saw the dumpster fire on r/wow, but fixing the problem within a few hours is pretty impressive.
---
Maybe you had a bad experience with it. I think it was really good for Darksorrow when it merged with neptulon. I met a lot more people and there were a few more options for raiding for a couple of years.
---
Eventually the server died at the end of Legion and I had to transfer to keep raiding but I would have preferred if the server merged again so the dieing guilds could keep going.
---
Confirmed. Just did ut and have a level 4 orc as an EUpeon.
---
You do realize alot of people have taken vacation for the release right? 
---
Alot of people most likely a majority dont have the possibility to just skip school as it appears to be what you have in mind.
---
Two man warrior/healer dm tribute farming will be quite lucrative for you.
---
Ah my bad, for the American audience, I meant diapers!
---
But that's not how layering works. layering is the entire world. You don't phase between zones.
---
Well I speak German Swedish and English so bring it on :D
---
2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP. That's what I think Europe gets at launch.
---
We've already seen that number can support ~300,000 concurrent players thanks to Layering, potentially even more.
---
Fuck this, I'm going to play on US realms again. This is what drove me away from EU in the 1st place. Realms advertised as English speaking only to find few or no one that speaks English.
---
&gt; The fuck it won't. 
---
I don't know why people don't get it. Anything but a Prot Warrior tanking bosses will get OBLITERATED in raids.
---
That 14% parry changes EVERYTHING. Fury Warrior tanks? Druids tanks?
---
Private server raid bosses are HEAVILY UNDERTUNNED, this is why Fury and Druid tanking somehow works. With 14% parry, if you don't have a shield...you are fucked, as a tank.
---
If there aren't even enough French or German players to fill one server each then the game is DOA anyway and indicative that it will be dead by last year on every server except the one PvP NA server where all streamers congregate.
---
French people will still pretend they don't understand you even if you learn French.
---
I have no idea what layering is and am not afraid to ask...what the fuck are we talking about here?
---
Except early on when there are 3 layers but only like 12 dudes in ungoro because everyone has leveled that fast. There won’t be empty layers but there will be empty zones in those layers.
---
From memory, of way back when.   You are bear till you can get improved shred.
---
I wouldn't mind if they did sharding in the starter zones and then phased it out once you left honestly. Just to get people a bit more spread out in the following zones. That being said, overpopulation isn't really an issue outside of the starting zones...
---
Yep. That's where I started my first character up. All the way to level 55. Then someone older told me to start a new character because there was 90% Spanish people in Spainbreaker :D
---
My ROFLCOPTER goes soi soi soi soi soi soi.
---
Well, then get used to people, places, and things phasing in and out of existence.
---
Is it really good the first few weeks? Hoe many weeks? That will take away world pvp and immersion, we know this already to be 100% true. So question is, what level will people be when it comes out? I will be pretty pissed if i cant world pvp say in southshore.
---
frends
---
Layering is shit in the first place, seems like a fancy way to say sharding to me, I don’t like it. I’d so much prefer seeing everyone in a big fuckin lagfest zerg than be shuffled away to some lAyEr designed by some twat at blizzard HQ who thinks I need to be protected from seeing lag or the swarm of players
---
it can fuck off imo, launch day is gonna suck in terms of progressing through the game but who cares? it’ll get better. and if they need to divide players up, why not just make more servers? how many people are even realistically expected to play this, anyways?
---
Someone else came up with what i think is a great idea.
---
When you create a new character, you choose the realm and layer number. You cant switch off that layer until blizzard starts merging the layers(whenever that is). 
---
That will stop people from abusing the layering system.
---
So if you're talking about PvE gnomes are better. They get a 5% boost to intellect and pets are not used as a warlock because you play the sacrifice build. Warlocks can stack insane amounts of shadow damage together with a shadow priest (or a priest healer specced into the shadow debuff) and if they crit it's a barcode-sized number. 
---
It's very lucrative. Both for herb and for alch. Depending on your auctioneering skills, you can make the big gl0ds through alch (old trick is to put things JUST before raid prime time). There are guides all over the web on this. Herbs sell a lot as it is, as well.
---
To everyone downvoting this post for bringing Layering up:
---
We got what we wanted with the Loot issue *precisely* because we kicked up a fuss and kept the spotlight on it.
---
We’re doing the right thing bringing it up and keeping it in the community’s vision. This is how we get Blizz to realize Layering is a massive fuck up before it’s too late, and we’re doing a great job at it.
---
Were not talking about fights were talking about spawning at the GY...
---
stfu
---
As you get into less populated zones there should be less layering, no? I thought they'd have that tech drippin the way they said, despite not implementing, X-zones with layering?
---
Can we finally start a petition to stop layering.
---
I've played games long enough to know y'all are idiots that can't play nor communicate, so there's that.
---
Upvote!
---
Here's a vid of my old guild doing it - May 31 2005  
---
[Retributionforge: The Renaming of Orgrimmar](https://youtu.be/DgSNXzULimA)  
---
was all just for fun(and showing dominance)
---
its like 50
---
Np! My apologies if anything came off offensive. I won't lie, there's definitely a weird Classic vs Retail syndrome going on pre Classic-release, and I don't even understand why considering it shares the same Sub and you don't have to play it if you don't like it. There has been and are still dozens of asinine posts comparing the two, and otherwise trash talking one another. It certainly brings out the worst in people, and encourages more hate to/from/on both. The shitposting, paranoia, and negativity is real high.
---
I think this is actually a good guess based on this news. I would guess something similar too.
---
thanks i was planning on rolling druid so i thought it'd be nice to join the conversation.
---
I honestly don't think I ever saw someone say "for the alliance", and I spent about 90% of my time from vanilla to wotlk on alliance. There's a lot of faction pride on the horde side for whatever reason, but I've never felt alliance players had much. If anything I think it was more tied to race (gnomes or dwarves) than the faction.
---
You basically do both as you go. Some of the talents benefit both. If you want, at 40 you can respec into a more tanky build if you plan on doing that, and start adding additional cat/bear points from there.
---
The nice part is that, because people invest so much in their character, people really identify you as that character. Most people have one character who is their "main". To your guildmates, you *are* a human paladin. Everyone knows you as a human paladin.
---
You'll be sitting in town and recognize a lot of the characters around you. You'll run into the same characters for months or years, and you'll notice when they level up or get new gear. And people will notice your progress, too, "Hey, you're that paladin healer who helped us with that quest a month ago! Wow, you are way higher level than us now."
---
Most people have alts, but usually your main character is who you are known as and what your reputation is built around. A lot of people will level multiple characters to level 20-30 before picking one to be their main, though.
---
I recommend finding a friendly guild for Classic, too. That's a great way to find people to group with.
---
Same!  I get annoyed when I'm not a high enough level to raise my profession caps, though.
---
The reserve system solves the "waiting for months" thing, but I didn't consider decaying DKP; I think that solves a lot of the problems w DKP I mentioned in the post.
---
More that I think about it - that would represent the number of players after the initial launch craze.
---
Think that's why they had 10 servers ready but then quickly closed 8 to funnel everyone to 2.
---
Who has said that exactly?
---
haha what have they done for anyone ever? If you pay for something, it wasn't a favor.
---
I do understand that Blizzard made the decision.  
---
That does not mean there was a logical reason for region locking it.  
---
&gt; Since you admitted you don't know, your opinion on the matter is useless.  
---
And so was your original comment. Admitting or not admitting not knowing does not change the validity of the statement.  
---
We have some very basic flaws in logic on display, but sure, keep pretending yesterday's numbers have validity on the launch.
---
In that case, I’m cool with it for a few weeks
---
I can already envision it.
---
/1 LFM UBRS - no baguettes
---
Leeeeeewayyyyyyyyyyyy Jenkinsssss!
---
Pservers err on the side of easy mode, and pserver players are used to feeling op. There will be an adjustment period of bad feelings. We can anticipate this without needing to romanticize the nobility of a playerbase that once collectively lost its shit over the semantics of rested xp.
---
That’s something I could get behind.
---
That’s why you gotta no life harder than everyone else.
---
I let my sub expire 2 months into BFA. But before I did, I leveled another toon. I got to level 70 something before dying my first time. Then I think I went another 15 or so before the second time.
---
Couldn't put it better myself. Personally I'm scared of my guild disbanding before I can get enough loot for next tier, that's why I'm so concerned about what loot system to use. I know it's too early to think about that but i would hate to be stuck in that situation. I am kinda comforted by hearing about guilds willing to run previous tier one day a week to gear new recruits. Since I'm a retail player(started raiding in MoP) I never had to run old content for newcomers thanks to catch up gear. So don't know what's expected for new recruits in the middle of a tier.
---
Blizzard is just one fucked up company. For years they get criticized by their customers. Then they finally seem to get something right with WoW Classic. The game looks great the people are satisfied with the beta and looking forward to the launch. Yet Blizzard somehow still manages to fuck everything up. For 3 months people have been begging for RpPvP servers to no avail. Blizzard doesn't seem to care about a significant part of their player base. No matter how many threads are opened, they won't listen. Then they start telling us that we won't even get different language servers for europe. How many fucking servers are there supposed to be at launch? 15? How is that supposed to be enough? Fuck layering. Give us more servers. Servers for all the major languages and all 4 server types. I've never seen a company having so little faith in their own product. It's going to be fun to see how Blizzard will be forced to open server after server when Classic releases because they simply didn't believe in the games success.
---
Really at this point I can't say more than F\*\*k you Blizzard.
---
It feels good to be going back to the golden days of mind control.
---
&gt;Look at the numbers for diablo immortal in Asia. 
---
What numbers? It's not even released yet.
---
They're networked together with clustering technology and can shift demand between each other.
---
What do you mean you disagree with the poll? Have never been? That was 15 years ago man. What does it matter what were popular back then. People have new mindsets
---
I realize i am waaay too late to join this arguement, but MMO's need to be more creative in their login/queue scenarios. How about you let people create a character and join the zone, but you are gated to start moving or talking until your timer is up (queue). During this time, the server whispers you and says, Hi, you are being gated due to high population in your area, please use this time to set up your options, key bindings, macros, so that your transition to the world of questing is enhanced and helps move you out of the congested area faster. You may also be gated when you move to the next zone, also please use this time, perhaps for a bio break, get up and streeeetch!
---
It's called focusing on the job to perform. In this case, they are trying to stress test servers for capacity. 
---
If you want to test how good an apple tastes, you don't care about the fact that a banana peels more easily than the apple. You just want to test the apple. 
---
They are right about the fact that EU open would have helped on performing capacity stress testing
---
Omg, I was rolling with 2k ms never had this issue before didnt know wtf to do.  Randomly clicked ivp6 (or w/e) and had 32ms the rest of the night.  Would have sucked to deal with that at launch.
---
Ion even says in the quoted interview above that they want to “be accommodating to new players” with layering in the first few weeks; if layering is being put in to deal with declining server populations then doesn’t that mean most of those newer players will have stopped playing by then anyways? Why are we implementing an abusable system for new player accommodation when even Blizz expects them to bail?
---
This just feels like retail logic. Retail is accommodation overload and it’s spoiled the game for most of us. When was Vanilla ever accommodating??? Vanilla release was a madhouse 15 years ago and it only made WoW the most successful game / series they’ve ever had, and addicts out of all of us.
---
Personally I'd rather it be gone after level 10. No need for it past starting areas. But as others are saying, apparently it's continent wide. So at that point I'd rather it not exist at all and just deal with the lagfest that will happen on launch. Fuck layering/sharding or whatever Blizz wants to call it. It's being abused already just like sharding on retail and it completely ruins the experience for me personally. I already had a mob despawn multiple times while I was killing it because it decided to kick me to different layers.
---
I'd rather have queue for a few days, don't exaggerate this.
---
Nobody actually wants this system. There's people like you who are "OK" with it, and people who know how damaging it is to the overall game.
---
&gt; As are most other reasonable people.
---
Ah yes, the "reasonable" people. The same people who turned modern wow into the convenience store it is today. No thanks, I'd rather have an authentic classic experience, not something changed to cater to retail fans.
---
Just pull out a pillow when you start to nod off and rest for an hour
---
For sure. I plan on playing ANY game because I don't want to have fun, and I want to do boring grinds. I have too much fun IRL so I gotta tone it down somehow ya know?
---
&gt; so fondly was because it was almost like a job 
---
Joking aside; It was indeed a Job once I was well integrated with a Guild and volunteered as an Officer and needed to gather extra materials before each raid in order to get everyone having good buffs and ready to go full-ham. Same for grinding for that sweet sweet PvP gear. Outside of that, it's not a job at all and everything was pretty casual.
---
Anyone who says yes to this is actually 10 IQ. I play WoW to play the game. All this other shit like the sense of community and all are great, but don’t fucking matter if I’m spending an hour in queue to log in and then when I finally do get to log in the starting zones are unplayable due to overpopulation. 
---
Realistically layering won’t change anything. Yes it can be abused by people but in phase 1 who the fuck cares? Phase 1 is questing and pre-bis. Nothing actually impactful to abuse. 
---
Anyone saying “I want the game to be unplayable for everyone because I care way to much about a few very specific very small issues that I personally don’t like” needs to fuck off.
---
I don't think it's that much more work than a DKP system, it's just confusing because I haven't thought of a good way to write it up clearly. 
---
Implicit in my proposal is that this system trades off equity of loot distribution with progression. You just hate to be the 4th ranked DPS who always gets passed up on upgrades, it happened a lot in vanilla. I haven't played since TBC so maybe the community has changed significantly.
---
Warsonger here as well. Server xfered because of it
---
For Gnomeregan!
---
Well we don't really know what unacceptable is. I'm sure Blizzard will be monitoring the server populations in specific level groups and zones and will do away with layering as soon as they feel it's ready to be. They've acknowledged that layering is not part of the authentic Classic experience and that it will only be around for as long as it needs to be.
---
What? I dont understand what you mean theyre nonsense. Always? Do you mean in current retail? Or do you mean that they were most popular 15 years ago?
---
1. Do not pack crisps/energy drinks/sugary or fat fast foods / etc. They will give you a short burst, and then bring you down HARD. Your best bet for food is healthy food like salads, fruit (dont eat too much sugar), veggies etc. Yes, it sounds boring, but trust me, if you plan on staying up for longer than a few hours, this is the way to go.
---
2. Plenty of water. Its very easy to get dehydrated if you're focusing too much on the game. Keep a few bottles of either still or sparkling water (not sodas!) and sip whenever you feel like it. 
---
3. Visit bathroom often. There will always be some kind of downtime - flight paths, waiting for group members etc. Take that opportunity to visit the bathroom.
---
4. If you really, really, really want to stay up without sleep for a long time (which i dont recommend unless you absolutely have to), i recommend Caffeine Naps. The way CN works is: You drink a cup or two of very strong coffee, and immediately (literally immediately) go lie down on a sofa/bed and set an alarm clock for ~20-30minutes. Then close your eyes. When you wake up, you will feel refreshed and can go on longer. I will not explain how/why this works, just google "Caffeine naps".
---
5. If you have a leveling route planned, be prepared to adjust. What if your quest is overcamped by other people? What if a quest drop is bugged? What if you are on PVP server and there's LOTS of other faction there? Prepare alternatives - grind spots etc.
---
6. Keep your room lit. The darker it is, the more strain on your eyes / the more tired you will get. Natural sunlight is almost always preferable.
---
The thing is though, you dont need to know what layer it is, it just has to be a different one than the one you're on for you to exploit this. OH NO THERE ARE PEOPLE DOING MY QUEST ON THIS LAYER, swap to any other layer
---
OH NO IM GETTING GANKED, INVITE ME SO I CAN LAYER SWAP!
---
Oh no there is no ore at one of the spawns, just swap layer.
---
Because it's 2019 and everyone is equal so we have to have accessibility on 100% of the things we do... even though BFA is a thing.
---
maybe blizzard should set a limit of 2500 character created accounts for each realm. just for the first weeks.
---
Lol was there a post from blizzard with a number of players??? Is there people that want to play but didn't bother paying $15 for a 48 hour beta?  Making an assumption that classic won't be big because people didn't log on to rando test some servers is kinda silly.
---
Again, do you think its magic? Even "the cloud" is a bunch of physical servers...
---
I mean, we did, but we didn't have "go farm Manual Crowd Pummelers for hours every week" levels of theorycraft. Back in the day, we were stuck just trying to get the community to embrace effective health.
---
You do realize they dont do layering in retail right? 
---
How can a system be ruining retail if the concept only was thought up for classic?
---
Aye same. But shaman will be really popular this time. Its a weird trend
---
I'm having a total blast, I don't remember the specifics since the questing I did happened so long ago so it feels like new to me
---
I do not want layering.  I do not want sharding
---
Yes I meant the lyceum, and you can 2man emperor even without stellar gear. It would be a later goal for them, and a good one imo, after they are in all blues.
---
Most full groups dont do full clears of BRD, just because they won't go in and stomp the whole place doesn't mean there isn't any fun to be had for them there.
---
on my side, im not  resubbing for just a 6 hours stress test (6hrs is the time i would be able to play during this stress test).   
---
so meybe next time.
---
This seems like the perfect solution imo and makes it easy to distinguish where it would and wouldn't happen
---
Goddamn. They really underestimate the size of the german community. Not having german servers (which we had since the launch of vanilla) is going to be terrible for us. I'm sure most other non-english communities feel the same way.
---
You can know, however, based on yellow mobs
---
&gt; respawns should not be different at any part of the game. It wasn't for vanilla and shouldn't be for classic.
---
You know dynamic spawning in vanilla was confirmed as a feature by Mark Kern in one of his streams, right?
---
The other thing people seem to be forgetting about: Layering goes away in phase 2.
---
They had a AV test weekend and they gave beta testers level 58's with gear sets to test high level PVP.
---
Layering is exactly that but dynamic and better.
---
I'm very anti-LC for these reasons. Creates a lot of friction, even if things are done fairly. 
---
I like the EGP or w/e model, I hadn't heard about it before but I'll consider it. Thanks for sharing.
---
It added just the right spice to the game, IMO.
---
Thats funny
---
Lol yea if they toss layering and don't host enough servers this is what we will be stuck doing
---
Or just put up with it in phase 1 like the rest of us? As it fundamentally changes nothing in the long run.
---
If people said "I don't trust Blizzard, but I'll wait and see," that would be one thing.
---
Right now the it's going more like this:
---
Community - "Layering sucks.  Don't layer ever/after level 30/after two weeks (pick your favorite request/demand)."
---
Blizzard - "We hear you, we promise we won't do it for long."
---
Community - "Layering sucks, don't do it too long!"
---
Blizzard - "We will only do it for a few weeks."
---
Community - "Layering sucks!"
---
Blizzard - "Yeah, we hear you and covered this already."
---
Blizzard - "..."
---
Community - "Blizzard isn't responding to our concerns about layering!"
---
Seriously, what else can Blizzard even do at this point?  The anti-layering community is beating a dead horse.
---
Are Blizzard even acknowledging this silliness they've introduced and are they exploring work arounds?
---
Have you seen the things that the community was concerned about regarding things that will affect gameplay? Spell batching, phases for each content release. There were others I can't think of right now. They have been communicating with us and trying to make it as authentic as possible. That is what I am talking about.
---
He makes a really good point about layering naturally splitting up the factions. I never even thought about that, but yeah, if you can switch layers, people are just going to go on the layer where their faction is the strongest, and this will cause a positive feedback loop that completely kills world PVP.
---
because sharding is literally the exact same system with another name? lmao
---
"Yeet King". Fixed.
---
Stress test and its US only
---
And making the assumption it will be big because it used to be is just as silly.
---
&gt;Some heat and eat stuff(pizza rolls, taquitos etc) and stuff to make quick and easy burritos and nachos(grilled chicken, beef and pork, onions and peppers refried beans and cheese).
---
If you plan on staying up for a long time, i really recommend NOT doing this. Fat foods will make your body feel tired (as it needs energy to process them). Stick with easier foods like veggies, nuts, simple (non-fat) pieces of chicken/meat etc.
---
That’s what I mean though - it’s not just performance. If you are the 4th ranked dps because your class isn’t top tier dps, or maybe you are just behind on gear and the item is a 20% upgrade you would get it before someone who it’s a 5% upgrade for.
---
DKP is too much work too, imo.
---
You just want to be a bear for survivability.
---
You're playing the wrong faction bud, lol.
---
Come on over. Grass greener on the other side.
---
This is not me judging and I respect anyone's enjoyment but I do not understand why players that wanted classic for all these years would powerlevel and rush through the content.
---
I know some people will hate this but it really is best for the size of the player base, we just don't get the English speaking numbers and variety that US servers do and it starts feeling a little incestuous when everyone on the server lives within 30 minutes of you (UK).  
---
Dungeon runs and things are still fun because you find ways to communicate with people and everyone recognises the common LFG terminology, it also creates rivalry's on the same faction between people you genuinely can't speak with, I think overall it's a positive and I'm sure (eventually) they'll have server transfers if people in 6 months end up on servers where they really can't find enough people speaking language, after all Vanilla WoW did.
---
You mean Activision...
---
Problem was thinking that BFA was anything other than a single player game that you happen to sometimes play with strangers. 
---
Whixh is why we are all so excited for classic. As it will actually be a game to play with friends
---
[*citation needed*]
---
I see you plan on going pvp server... the thing is about rushing - everything has been seen (not by others, but by me) so no I don't plan on straining my eyes more than I need to. Will I put in dozens of hours for the first few days? 100% but I won't sacrifice sleep just to be able to say I hit 60 in x amount of days.
---
Please change your stance to no layering after the first week or so because this thread might make blizzard internal meetings go “see this thread? They’re slowly accepting crossrealm!”
---
No, OP is assuming 60k people per server because they assume every continent in every layer is going to be maxed out on every server and that Blizzard would rather have 15 layers across 2 servers instead of something more realistic like having those 15 layers spread across 5 servers despite that idea being completely retarded.
---
That's a mistake in my opinion. You'll have all those fragmented communities on European servers, who would rather be among themselves for whatever reason (language barriers obviously being the most common one). 
---
Usually European servers have that unspoken agreement, that everyone speaks English and that people on it are okay with that. Now I am aware, that that's not always what happens and you often have ethnocentric guilds or whatever on European servers who only speak their own language, but now with everyone being forced onto those servers, it'll be a lot more worse than the rare Polish or Czech guild looking for some members.
---
A lot of people already reacted with a "Wow, fuck you - I'll make sure to only speak \[Insert Language Here\] the whole time, just to spite you for that."
---
I also can't imagine how a SINGLE European realm would ever do without layering in P2. There's way too many people who are interested in Classic for that to be feasible.
---
I rather deal with that a small handful of times for the first 3 months than a dead server for the rest of the games lifespan.
---
Do they tho?
---
This is pretty close to my plan as well, prepared meals, wife, healthy activities. And a whole bunch of no life
---
You are right, just tested this
---
I havent played wow for a long time. I tryed it out recently and got irritated that you can talk german in the game (from austria so I play on german servers). I think it wont be a problem for many people to just communicate in english. Its a common thing.
---
No, but to level up 2 toons within 2 weeks is impossible. 10 days even more impossible, and for a fresh launch? You can forget it.
---
Well thanks for including proof and a detailed analysis to back those claims
---
And what was that?
---
My goal was to play on an English server since I really don't like to play with other germans... but this gonna be interesting how it will work
---
Lol, the raids and dungeons in WoD were fucking on point, best in the game by a large margin (except maybe Legion or BFA, I never played them).
---
As far as the "you think you do, but you don't". It seems Blizzard is still on that path. They think Classic is going to be a bust. Or at most a pet project that hopefully converts some people over to Retail.
---
First off, this entire process is so convoluted and time consuming that it wouldn’t be worth it. 
---
Second, the premise on which this is build i.e. that logging and re-logging is all it takes to switch layers means that you have no permanent “control group”
---
Once each friend from each layer logs out you are right back to square one because you can no longer guarantee that when friend 2 logs back in on his alt that is supposed to be on layer 2 that he is indeed still on layer 2. So again I repeat; to abuse it the way he says *IS. SIMPLY. NOT. POSSIBLE*.
---
This is a great explanation, thanks.
---
then why doesn't it say stress test? my bf's launcher specified it (see pic)
---
more like less and less people needing servers in their own language because everyone speeks at least basic english, and even if you speak only basic english its ok to play on an 'english' server if said server still has german/French/italian/etc guilds on it.
---
\*bounce\*  
---
\*bounce\*
---
Well, griefing. lol.
---
Let's be honest here, if quest givers and other important NPCs weren't there, those places wouldn't get raided.
---
I used capitals to show the letter difference.
---
This is completely game breaking.
---
Thinking about going this too. How are you going to place your talent points?
---
&gt; How often do you think this is going to happen? 
---
Why should layering be a part of the meta? You can do so much stupid shit with it, people will create scripts or addons for searching for players in different layers. They will have to enforce it heavily.
---
the thing is you die only once as nelf with my route when u jump off the boat, arriving to Menethil. u die in some small bay north of ironforge and resurrect at gnome\`s GY, so basically u explore a lot at teldrassil, some darkshore, menethil a bit, and then head for delivery quests+exploring at gnomes-&gt;if-&gt;sw-&gt;elwinn. so in the end u r almost lvl 6 with FP at menethil+if+sw wich gonna save u lot of time later, HS to Dolanaar and ready to go
---
I understand that but I never purchased the current expansion either.
---
I dont want the argument to be based off looks or personal preference. Where do you think troll outshines tauren and by how much? Does beserking  tps make a massive difference?
---
I've been had!
---
I have seen every video and read every post. I know how it works. The only saving grace is that its not crossrealm.
---
Again.. [*citation needed*]
---
Interacting with french people that dont understand english at all isnt fun either since classic has really strong social play
---
Even if it only applies to starter zones, this is also very frustrating. I loved going to Durotar to duel people, but now if Durotar is being layered and I can't find a duel it takes a lot of the fun out of the game for me. We shouldn't have to coordinate groups to merge layers for dueling.
---
why do you think you can't wpvp?  each layer has as many players as a server, they can pvp among each other.   95% of the players will just stay on their layer and act like its a normal server.  I see no problem here.
---
If you are a raider who is specced fire for AQ40 then you certainly can farm DME lasher as fire spec. Your raid gear will have sufficient int and stam.
---
Round em up, untalented nova, untalented CoC or flamestrike (preference), AE until dead. Eat, drink, move on. It's not as fast as it would be if you had shatter, imp CoC, and permafrost but it's still one of the fastest and safest money grinds.
---
Torn between hunter and shaman atm
---
Stay away from the vooodooo!
---
Um stun resist is amazing. Axe spec is pretty good. Blood fury is great for the classes it helps. Also they look great In almost every armor set. 
---
Yes they are the humans of the horde but Human is one of the strongest races for alliance. 
---
Rep gain if you don’t have it good luck getting scarab lord on Alliance side. Sword and mace spec is OP. They both tend to be better as melee classes but that’s fine. They don’t have to be the best for all classes. 
---
Gnomes are better casters. Dwarves have Priest on lock down. NE have... druids. Heh damn knife ears. Lol 
---
Big thing is though racials really don’t impact you at end game much at all unless you are a priest and even then it’s not that big a deal in 40 mans where someone will be playing the meta so you don’t have to. 
---
Unless you are in some upper tier split running Uber guild it really won’t matter. And let’s face it, 99% of us won’t play that way.
---
I'm really happy that people finally see that even Classic won't fix the game because the company behind the game is Activision-Blizzard and anyone who followed recent developments with Destiny and Bungie will see that everything bad about that franchise was due to Activision, and I bet Respawn Entertainment will be able to tell some tales from how shitty their work with Activision was back when they used to work for them.
---
Fuck Activision and their Blizzard lackeys.
---
Why are you mad at layering? I know they said layering would be in the game but I mean, that could just be a lie? Layering won't be in classic obviously.
---
to mess with people
---
Warlock because they're mushrooms.
---
Honestly this is an extreme bad decision. I am very upset about not splitting between languages. It was the main complainment that people had on big private servers that there were so many different languages in general chat. It gets more and more common/mainstream that it is expected from gamers that they should be fluent in english but not everyone is!!!!! 
---
- It destroys immersion and gameplay feeling. 
---
- Groups don‘t function as they would on language specific servers
---
- It encourages toxic behaviour due too language barriers
---
- Back than everyone could communicate with each other and now they destroy community building with not splitting up between languages. 
---
What a genuinely dumb decision. It is the worst decision that Blizzard could even make!!! Even sharding wouldn‘t have that negative impact on community building.....
---
It always was clear that Blizzard goes the classic way and splits languages now I am very very very disappointed
---
Hell yes. Got trolled hard by the overly mature ally side. It was marvelous, between ninjas, jerks and people just being nobcheese in general I had a much better time horde.
---
In the graphics menu there is actually a button on the bottom called “Classic”.
---
You're looking at the wrong fucking numbers.
---
https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-first-quarter-2019-financial
---
This is a problem, but it can be fixed.
---
I don’t but you do you man
---
Just /leave 1. I did that within 5 minutes of being there. Anything social you want to say to the people around you can be said in /say or /party.
---
If they had separate servers for each language this would suck for hundreds of private server guilds with most members from different countries. Sure the guild can all go to the same server but almost everyone is going to have a negative experience when chat channels are flooded with a different official realm language to their own and they cannot understand a word.
---
That's the positive side to this news.
---
Lol classic is just keep getting worse and worse...
---
In 2005 they were standalone. They are not anymore. You used to be able to purchase the old hardware of each original server at BlizzCons for $3200 each.
---
The economy will fix itself. So will the community.  
---
If you wont none of that, how about just offering free server transfers? easy fix. Let low pop realms be low pop.
---
You're absolutely right, no one should have to skip content because the game is practically unplayable. These comments saying to skip quests and grind mobs are pretty lame.
---
Casual raiding guilds will have a (longer) time clearing raids because of the non committed raiding group. 
---
Usually you'll see tanks and healers pretty reliable but DPS will be stingy as far as casual goes - they lose an item or two after an hour of playing and they'll just go level an alt instead of sticking though the group.
---
Having a reliable 20-25ish people is much more likely for a casual guild.
---
Keep in mind at the start and the first few months plenty of "tourists" will still want to raid for their first time and there will be a big pool of people to choose from - after a couple weeks of raiding MC people will fall off.
---
So I just resubbed with a 6 monther and don’t have BFA, currently creating my character now in Classic
---
Honestly I don't think this is going to be THAT big of a problem. What is likely going to happen is certain nationalities opting to roll on the same servers as their own. This happened in retail too.
---
Why you complain so much it's a challenge if they do it other people will complain
---
Don't quote me but i believe it was Bear form from 10-26, cat form 27-31 unless you are doing instances or pulling large groups then bear form, 32-60 cat form as you get faerie fire and ferocious bite. The reason why you hold off till 27 is that furor won't be 5/5 till until now so it is a waste of energy.
---
Now you just have to find 4 other people (including 1 tank and 1 healer if you aren’t either of those) who are online exactly the same amount of time as you.. good luck 😬
---
Every guild I’ve been in leadership in we recruited ensuring people know that the team &gt; the individual. Everyone will get the gear eventually. It’s just a matter of having a firm foundation and dealing with any issues that come up when they come up.
---
I honestly believe they should just get rid of Layering and let us deal with the clusterfuck that will erupt.
---
I'm sorry you can't do simple arithmetic.
---
Yeah,  and I’m sure it will be too. Just if it isn’t I’d be very disappointed
---
Also: in addition; too
---
I took those numbers directly from the Form 10Q they reported to their shareholders...
---
No - it's going to happen at launch, nobody will complain because they are either leveling or exploiting layering - then 2 months in nobody will care because layering is gone.
---
This is cute, I love your story :D Standing around 1.5 hours to just heal random people doing quests at lvl 3 is probably what I would do if it was my first time.
---
To answer some of your questions (some might've been answered already):  
---
\- The reason Stormwind was empty, was probably because you're on a completely new server, people are out leveling and testing things. Not a lot of people will go to Stormwind, but later on the cities are gonna be the places people hang out usually.
---
\- Giant dungeons/raids arent until 60. Or well, it depends how you define "giant", there are some big dungeons before 60 as well. Maraudon comes to mind, but it's still closer to level 50. Before that you'll go to places like Wailern Caverns (if your horde) or Deadmines (if you're alliance) which is around lvl 18+. There's also RFC in Orgrimmar for horde which is lvl 13+ or something. I wouldn't call them giant, but they're relatively big and a cool experience the first time you go there.
---
\- Shoulder pads are usually something you'll find a bit later, around lvl 16+, and they don't look cool to begin with, not even on orcs, but it still feels good to get your first shoulders!
---
\- "Did I pick the right class?". People have been playing this game for 15 years and still don't know if they've picked the right class. So just choose one you think is fun and enjoy. Plays alts too and try different things!
---
\- I think classic will be perfect for you as a newcomer (it's much more social than retail, even if you'll run into speed levelers who's leveling to 60 for the 15th time, there are a lot of people out there like you who just wants to enjoy the ride and probably a lot of noobs like you too. Retail is in some ways more convenient, but at higher levels it's also more complicated because there are so many added abilities and the world is almost too big if you have to plow through 6 expansions or whatever it is by now.
---
Anyway, I'm sure you're in for the ride of your life when Classic releases. Just remember to take everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft!
---
I don't care one bit either, it's essentially the same system, just thought I'd point out the double standard.
---
Youre correct. I dont really liked the original horde models, and started playing right before TBC launched and have been a blood elf ever since. No specific reason. The alliance always struck me as “the brave noble all good” faction, and i like the hordes “badass” theme more
---
&gt; Should also be removed from Retail
---
Imagine forcing interaction in the world in BFA lmao
---
Because that ruins server specific community's people lose their names and possibly their guild name. PvP ranks would be all fucky etc. Layering us the only viable option. There will still be the proper nodes per person. Way less game breaking then dynamic respawns. A "guild" exploitng layers to get all the nodes is no different then them getting all the nodes if there was just one layer minus some extra gold if they sell it. You guys are acting like they're launching with only a handful of servers. And those servers will be so populated that there will be 4 or 5 layers a server. Let's think about this with our heads on our shoulders. The most recent stress test will give them a decent idea of who's interested in classic. And before you say EU wasn't there they just double the numbers they got we all know the interest is a 50/50 split. From there they can aim to put a number of servers up that will aline with the population spread evenly with 2-3 layers per server. Prompts would be displayed if you were creating a character on a over populated realm and you would be advised to move. If you didn't want to or can't because a pre joined guild etc well your SoL and wanted classic. 
---
TLDR: Be glad were getting classic and layering will be gone by the time it matters. Deal with what blizzard gives up like we always have.
---
Reddit search function is broken af so its understandable. There is an ongoing stress test in the US which caused some EU accounts to get access to the stress test client but without giving them access to it. Also if you were in the last stress test you wouldbe able to see that tab as well, with it being renamed to just Beta (if you dont have actual beta access it will remain grayed out)
---
Merging servers have some serious issues. Such as people losing their guild name, player name, their guild being disbanded, not being on the same server seeing the same people you lvled with among many other issues. Honestly I think they should just cut layering off at like lvl 25-30 at that point everyone should be spread out in their lvling that it should be fine.
---
Gearing up new recruits is an absolutely essential part of a functioning guild. Those new recruits become loyal and you foster a team-based attitude versus an everyone for themselves approach. 
---
The mentality of the guild is it's #1 contributor to success or failure IMO. Supporting your mates is the best way to build the right culture.
---
I can see now...
---
Would you say tauren is better in pve and pvp the troll?
---
Dude, he responded to you.  You said, literally
---
&gt; it can't go live in its current state.
---
He's saying that this is a beta, not a finished product.  Yes, report bugs.  Then give Blizzard time to actually fix them.  
---
If you can't figure out how that is specifically responding to your concern...
---
(Also, 3 lines is a rant?  Come on man...)
---
Blizzard servers are unstable trash. Blizzard can only dream of having servers as stable as private servers.
---
Ahh, the good ol' ignore function will be alive and well used for me.
---
Yeah.. itd be awful for people to have to think for themselves and play the game.. the horror.
---
Fuck no dude, lvl 10 and thats it. Layering sucks
---
It's not caring about loot, it's caring about how 40 plus people feel and building the right team-based culture.
---
&gt;The economy will fix itself. So will the community.
---
The same can be said for any issues layering might cause while its active in the first few months. The difference is that the issues that have been pointed out with the current version of layering can be fixed so we just don't have to deal with it at all, if those issues are even abusable in a live environment.
---
If you consider the "content" of the game the first 3 level 1-2 quests then sure I guess? If you consider the content of the game the community and the world then no I don't think missing out on 2-3 quests is that big of a deal.
---
It's funny how cartoon esthetics draw different crowds.
---
Night elf is also my only alliance choice
---
&gt; I had no idea that any subs could get in now.
---
That is just for the stress test.
---
Im not super worried about layering in the beginning. Im worried about it staying. I honestly think blizzard will keep layering permanently.
---
[Approved](https://i.gifer.com/77wB.gif)
---
Just so you know, there were still ques even with layering in the previous stress tests. It's not going to eliminate that.
---
Layering only in starting zones will not work. I played in vanilla launch and went hard as fuck and it was still a lot of fucking people in places like hillsbrad.
---
I actually remember before they patched corpses decay timers. Hillsbrad had so many corpses you literally lagged the fuck out as soon as you loaded in. If was corpses every foot for like 1/4 the entire zone. The entire area between the 2 towns was thousands of corpses. This was pre honor system of course.
---
Tbh 100ms isn’t bad for a game like WoW
---
Last time I checked arithmetic didn't mean "pulling random numbers of out your ass". So unless you're going to post something backing your numbers up I'm going to put you in the same camp as I do flat earthers.
---
Once the servers stabilize and people spread out across different continents they wont have to keep layering.
---
Remember in the first few weeks theres going to be a huge influx of players. Many of them wont stay. They're just trying it out cause it's free for them as bfa players so why not. In addition, everyones going to be squeezed into the first few zones. All this adds up to a lot of stress right away.
---
Months later, even if servers are still full the players will be much more spread out. Either in instances running dungeons or raids or out in different continents looking for resources and quests. At which point theres much less stress overall.
---
And realistically blizz servers are huge, they wont stay full after launch. Even if they say full they're not nearly at capacity.
---
It's called spell batching. The server holds actions before processing them. I think it has something to do with latency. It was much longer in vanilla than retail, they put the vanilla delay in classic.
---
&gt;In America you have fucking three languages at most. Spanish. Portuguese and English
---
That's just incorrect, was enlightening OP.
---
I disagree
---
Grow some braincells pls
---
Orcs ARE the humans of the horde.   The original warcraft game was warcraft orcs and humans.
---
wtf is wrong with you? I'm Russian and on live I play on EU server on English server with English language. If they force ban me from playing on EU server, I lose all my WoW friends and I have no one to play with. I hope it's like on live and if you have english client you can play on EU and can't on RU and vice versa
---
I know a Warmonger is considered decent if you can get your hands on it. It’s a solid 3% hit, but it’s a random boe.
---
I laughed my ass off reading your comment.
---
I just resubbed with the 6 monther, I don’t have BFA and I just downloaded classic and created a character. Currently playing a undead mage in Classic.
---
Yeah, especially streamers. They were all talking about how fun questing was and the community, but now all they talk about is being guild leaders, reserving legendaries for themselves, reaching 60 in one week, world firsts, etc...
---
Yeah, at 4PM EST on a Wednesday... not exactly peak times
---
So-- you were stuck in the queue for the stress test?
---
I remember queueing for 15-30 minutes or more on occasion. Yeah, that was not amazing when you wanted to be playing, or had someone else in-game who wanted to group up for a quest, or had a limited amount of time to play. 
---
But it was not the end of the world, and that kind of queue only lasted for the first year as they got more servers online and worked on stability. I still played. I still play. I wasn't driven away then or now. And maybe you will be. That sucks if you like the game. But it isn't what you are making it out to be.
---
I’m hoping Twitch adds functionality for Classic as well.
---
No, I mean layering should only be active in those zones.
---
Yeah I don't doubt that it's totally possible to execute effectively. I've had poor experiences both in MMOs and in fantasy football (lol) so I'm perhaps too preemptively cautious.
---
I also think it takes time to build trust in the institution and we won't have a lot of time with the post-launch rush.
---
I'd sign a petition to remove it complete. It should not exist at all.
---
Everyone should be jammed.
---
Ideally Blizzard would sort out their scaling issues, and have only 4 realms:
---
- PvE
---
- PvP
---
- RP-PvE
---
I have the same with orgrimmar.. thanks mate
---
having a cooldown on layering stops friends potentially playing with each other which is awful and will never happen - "hey sorry bro i just helped jimmy out with a quest, i'll be able to help you in 10 minutes when i can get on your layer again :D".
---
and setting arbitrary restrictions on where you can layer makes it complicated to people as to how it works.
---
There is NO way layering can exist without it severely harming the health of the game OR being exploited.
---
I agree completely. I don't want merged realms. Everyone wants 'no changes' because they have an effect on player immersion and identity and all that, but they'd be fine with merging realms, which wipes all of that away? I wonder if they'd still feel that way if they end up on a realm that would need merged later.
---
Ayy! I'm playing Hunter myself :) Was torn between Hunter or Warlock for a time but Warlock just seems too complicated for me, plus the soul shard farming turned me off completely 😂
---
That's what sucks, I ran MC on my lock about 2 times and got bindings to drop and now have TF on a caster, same for shaman with hand of rag, eye dropped on literally the first run. Even got the ZF tiger to drop the last month before they removed it, after doing a years worth of running every 3 days, never saw the raptor sadly.  But did almost 5 years of Yogg 0 lights and H LK runs with literally no luck, RNG is brutal sometimes.
---
If you are interesting in classic for the exploration and things being new you are in for a surprise, but most people stick around because it's just legitimately a great fucking game.
---
People acting like the first 2-3 quests of the game a "required content!"
---
Loch modan, redridge, westfall, tarnaris.
---
Slow answer to your quick question: The difficulty lies in the somewhat exponential nature of the scheduling and how you compensate for it. I am available 100% of the time that I am available, but if I need to group with someone, I need to find a time that matches. If we need two more people, we need to find time that all 4 of us are available. Finding that time that works for everyone is difficult, but that's just the start.
---
So you find 40 people and they can all make a time. Most of the time. But with 40 people you're twice as likely to have someone have something come up as you are with 20 people. So you need more than 40 people. But how many more? You can get 100, then you'll probably always have 40 people, but you'll also have a lot of people not raiding and getting gear, which slows down progression. It also makes people bored and prone to leaving. So now you're back to your original problem.
---
Melee are gonna have a blast in Classic pvp.
---
That's a tough one. Both pally and shaman are great healers for their faction. 
---
Paladins will be a bit more boring because it's mostly just flash of light spam but the buffs they bring are amazing. 
---
Shaman are great because of chain heal and their totems but are less mana efficient than paladins. 
---
Honestly you cant go wrong with either.
---
&gt; Disagree. You people are more worried about a streamer getting 2 black lotuses than 100,000 people being unable to log in or find mobs to kill. Have some perspective
---
I'm concerned that there might not be thousands of people in Elwynn Forest at the same time.
---
DKP = dragon kill points
---
You get points for showing up and per boss (plus other ways if your guild decides to reward consumable farming etc). When loot drops you bid against your peers using your earned DKP points.
---
You quad lingual gets all the panties wet man, dont you know anything!?
---
I had a blast as well.
---
Can someone confirm the difference between layering, sharding and phasing please?
---
I thought I had them straight in my head, but have seen people giving differing definitions lately so not sure now.
---
&gt;Crossrealm bgs were the beginning of being able to actually enjoy doing mostly PvP. 
---
Sounds like maybe you shouldnt have been on the most populated side of the server?
---
I played Alliance on Shadowmoon and we outnumbered Horde 3:1, our queue times were extremly long at the time for Alliance players.
---
Know what I did? I switched sides.
---
I went from 40 minute WSG queues to instanteous ones because thats how the system works, it only goes as fast as both teams can fill.
---
So you liked playing on an overpopulated side of a server and this was the tradeoff, you dominated the world presence, you had more people to raid with/dungeon/ect with but the Horde get instant queues.
---
Want to play Alliance and and have low queues? Play on a Horde dominated server simple as that, the reality is though you want your faction imbalance to be heavily in your favor and rather than take the good with the bad you also want the one advantage the opposite faction has (lower queue times) and circumvent that as well.
---
I believe that’s correct
---
I just want a definitive stance from Blizzard before the game releases. I would be pretty pissed off if I chose Tauren for the extra melee range only to get nerfed a month in.
---
You played Alliance, 100%.
---
It’s open for 48 hours.
---
Imagine being this stupid as to think adding something to vanilla that never was originally in it, something that will shatter the entire community into many small pieces, won't have an effect on the whole realm community. This is some next level braindamage.
---
You can't really farm in raid spec either unless if you are the guilds deep frost mage, so yeah respeccing it is. What I'd recommend is respec once and farm the ever living shit out of something, then don't respec for a couple of weeks until you have to it again.
---
You want to do it so
---
 a) servers don't get overwhelmed at launch by everyone coming to check out classic
---
b) those same servers don't turn into ghost towns once all the tourists stop playing
---
Imagine 10k people on a single server at launch. It would be impossible to do anything in game. Then if only 10-20% stick around until lvl 60 (which could take months for most players) there's almost no one left.
---
Why so bigoted?
---
Huh?
---
Maybe they could use layering for the first month of the game and then remove it? People would get to exploit it for the first month though
---
They're not random. They're the maximum number of players on a server at one time and the minimum number of layers we saw during Stress Test #2. Everything else is simply math.
---
I don't care to go find a Twitch clip where someone is saying "invite me to Layer 8 please!", but all of those that played that day remember.
---
Are you one of those Holocaust deniers too?
---
From all the advice I've digested hybrids in Classic and especially druids shouldn't be viewed as a class with lots of exclusive choices for roles (strictly), but more of a Swiss army knife. Compare any individual tool (fps, tank, heals) directly and in isolation and you'll find it lacking, and you might have a bad time if you commit to just one. But if you embrace the fact ALL roles are available to you at all times, and you get a very powerful utility that pure classes can't offer. Your choice is then not "which role do I want to play?" but "which aspect of my play do I want to emphasise?"
---
Smite priest with a ret paladin for the sanctity aura. Balance druid so their spells crit more. Beast master hunter for the pet to tank. Gorilla of course. Shadow priest heals with Vampirc embrace.
---
Its bl
---
&gt;The more I play on the stress test servers the more I feel disappointed that Classic isn't what Vanilla was back in the day.
---
What got me into WoW at the start was this huge massive world for me to explore... but since I've already done that 15 years ago (and even seen the future) I've kind of lost interest in Classic. 
---
This is you starting to readjust your expectations... I've been telling all of my friends that ask "why would I pay $15 for a game I already played, I can't get the same experience as back then"
---
I always respond with - classic is not about reliving those moments of our friend kiting on the ubrs bridge or the first time we went into MC - classic is meant to be enjoyed in a 2019 gaming world - I want to play classic because of the SYSTEMS and just that... I want to have to level unarmed, I want to have to manage my gold so I can afford a level 40 mount, I want to get 5 people together for a dungeon and actually play together to complete it in a reasonable amount of time.
---
For some it's about r14 or full tier 3 - that's all well and good, but I just want to get back to the systems that wow put in place (no matter how annoying they can be)
---
The closer we get to launch, the more I think about picking up borderlands 3 near the end of September - when classic release date was announced I pretty much wrote off any other games for the rest of the year - now I'm thinking classic will get played a ton, just not the only game.
---
I know this wont help much but both classes are great. Shaman will probably help you survive more in pvp though because they are more tanky than priests.
---
They are great and fun for pvp.
---
If you have high ambitions regarding pve, you will find that hardcore-leaning guilds will probably only bring a very few hunters once they are settled in or past BWL. That was my experience in the past and also what I read on this subreddit
---
Yup, noticed the same thing at Tiragarde Keep last night. Was gonna post it but forgot to take a screenshot.
---
Seriously, I don't know why no one is talking about how we're all adults now lmao. Some people have shit to do, and I honestly can't waste the few hours I can play at a time with the servers packed like anchovies. Layering is for the casuals.
---
They said it is going to be for the first few weeks only though. I don't think it is much of a problem if they keep their word and shut it off after 3-4 weeks.
---
This is pretty much exactly what a big company does when they need off-nominal hours worked.
---
nice one, probably the dumbest comment in the entire post!
---
Side note, my pet will attack, but will not cast any abilities under these circumstances
---
Welcome to the internet. Sorry it took you 20 years to notice.
---
Same, I've had my choice for a while but it's fun to read this thread.
---
Then this is their way out.  They never really wanted to play that bad if $15 vs $8 or $10 really mattered. 
---
This entire thread has been nothing but support of players showing their willingness to play the game at the advertised price.  That should mean something to you.  It’s literally a BOGO model.  Use it or don’t.  The price is the price.  You want wow?  That’ll be $15.  You want classic?  That’ll be $15.  You want both?  Boy have I got a deal for you!
---
Hello! I’m recruiting for a new horde pve guild for classic! We plan to be a semi-serious guild, but we also welcome casual players who just want to hang out while we squash bugs and even dragons! We plan on pushing raid content to the best of our abilities without the stress found in the hardcore guilds.
---
Name: &lt;Cabal&gt;
---
Server: Horde PVE
---
Raid Times: Tuesday, Thursday, and sometimes Sunday 7-11pm CST.
---
Loot System: TBD
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/RqbXYnc
---
We are currently recruiting all classes and roles, so feel free to jump in our discord and say hi!
---
'for those at work' (&lt;for the people ctrl+f'ing)
---
That looks like a Crow Wing Reaper on your back ;o  
---
It's a shame they used recolored D1/t1/t2 but didn't make the items spec specific for hybrids, couldnt build a full set without the stats being all over the place :&lt;
---
I presume that kind of language would only be predominant on servers with big streamers.
---
This is true. I picked up a good amount of Russian from my time playing eve online. I also enjoy my dungeon queues with Latin American servers because it gives me an opportunity to work on my  Spanish speaking abilities.
---
Yes I think it has something with the game orginally being on old tech.
---
nah, aside from getting us classic wow
---
That's fine, because it means whatever I'll be selling is x10 as well. Otherwise if nobody can afford the price of pots, people won't buy the pots until they drop. The economy will balance out.
---
I played on Gurubashi, the other unofficial BR server. I can imagine how it was for you, since I know how people from my country is.
---
&gt; At least I learned Brazillians type laugh with "jajaja" instead of "hahaha". 
---
Actually we don't. Spanish speaking people do. It sounds odd to us (type "ja ha" in google translator). "huahuahua" and "huehuehe" were more common, but they are nonsensical laughs, just for fun. Today "kkkkk" is common (sounds like cacacaca, and I don't like it), another nonsensical laugh.
---
Not the way OP is talking about it - DR in BFA and private servers is not the same as DR in classic.
---
Yikes. Giving Tips out the scammer more views 😂
---
It wouldn't just be UK
---
Scandinavians and Dutch play on English realms and speak extremely good English
---
Anyone thats basically not French, German or Italian would roll on English.
---
I couldnt care less about seeing other players, I just dont want mobs/nodes to phase out infront of me.
---
What I actually said is that *removing* layering has no impact on the community or economy. The personal insult wasn't necessary.
---
That just doesn't work with how the Classic launch is expected to go. Also, sharding isn't in it. Yes, I know, you're just going to say "but sharding and layering are the same thing" but they just aren't. Layering is what sharding should have been, it's a vastly better system.
---
But anyways, I'll repost my explanation of why layering is definitely the best way to go for launch.
---
There's only 3 real options for Classic's launch:
---
Option 2 dumps likely 10k+ people into a world designed for a cap of ~2500. There would be insane overcrowding no matter what, if the game could even handle it. We're talking an average of over 1,250 people per race, which means places like the orc/troll or dwarf/gnome starting areas would likely reach close to 2500 people. An actual vanilla server with it's cap of ~2500 people all logging on for the first time at once would only have around 300 people per starting zone. You'd literally have the population of an entire vanilla server one starting zone, and there'd be two of them like that. This would be utterly, completely unplayable.
---
Some exploits would be for rare spawns or resources like herbs or ore. Better to have it limited to low value zones.
---
Nope. I enjoyed getting a taste in the stress test. It had its issues with not enough mobs to go around, and I see all the layering whining going on.. and I just don’t care about any of it. I enjoyed the group and social aspects most. Tbh, I was more a Star Wars Galaxies player/refugee, and don’t care all that much about Warcraft or its lore. But it was a damn fun game to play, and I really loved the group mechanics/dynamics. Can’t wait to get back to that. To each their own though, people like things for different reasons.

You can actually expand that out a lot to be more useful.
---
/cast \[harm, nocombat, stance:1\] Charge; \[harm, nocombat, stance:2\] Battle Stance; \[harm, nocombat, stance:3\] Battle Stance; \[harm, combat, stance:2\] Berserker Stance; \[harm, combat, stance:1\] Berserker Stance; \[harm, combat, stance:3\] Intercept
---
/cast \[harm, nocombat, mod:shift, stance:2\] Battle Stance; \[harm, nocombat, mod:shift\] Charge; \[harm, mod:shift\] Defensive Stance 
---
One button that will switch to Battle Stance and Charge when out of combat, or switch to Berserker Stance and Intercept when in combat. The "harm" clause will only let you switch if your current target is an enemy, so you won't switch accidentally just by pressing it.
---
The second "/cast" is part of the same macro and is for stance dancing when tanking. While holding shift and pressing the same button, you will switch out of Defensive to Battle, Charge, then switch back to Defensive. You can include this "/cast" as part of the same sequence as the Charge/Intercept.
---
Even more, if you can have it change the tooltip and icon it displays based on conditions. If you leave the icon as the question mark in the macro menu, it'll use the icon of whichever ability it would currently cast. This can be useful to see which stage of the macro you're in, but I find it less elegant.
---
If I was going to use this macro, this is how I'd do it:
---
\#show \[nocombat\] Charge; Intercept
---
\#showtooltip \[nocombat\] Charge; Intercept
---
/cast \[harm, nocombat, mod:shift, stance:2\] Battle Stance; \[harm, nocombat, mod:shift\] Charge; \[harm, mod:shift\] Defensive Stance; \[harm, nocombat, stance:1\] Charge; \[harm, nocombat, stance:2\] Battle Stance; \[harm, nocombat, stance:3\] Battle Stance; \[harm, combat, stance:2\] Berserker Stance; \[harm, combat, stance:1\] Berserker Stance; \[harm, combat, stance:3\] Intercept
---
Great news!! Diversity is strength!!
---
yeah it ruins the immersion. Vanilla wow had pretty complete immersion. Stripping A LOT of it out right off the bat.
---
Makes sense, thank you!
---
I read about the totem switching for resto shamans that helps the melee group a lot(having the ability to reduce threat, boost the damage of others or both at the same time seems super valuable to me). I wanna master it and be the best friend of every melee. Too bad i can't play with my guild but I wanna play what I wanna play.
---
In October nobody will be care about layering and come August 26/27, anyone complaining about layering will be playing so it won't matter.
---
Blizzard has it down :)
---
It wouldn't just be the first few days. That Zerg will be there for like 10 days because a lot of people won't play the first 3-4 days thinking it'll be too crowded, but then another Zerg just begins. Even on some private servers with like 7k population the starting areas for the popular races are STILL a clusterfuck, and those servers have been out for years
---
Phase 6 Xrealm BGs or riot.
---
People are going to downvote because this has been posted a thousand times
---
After August 13th, when the name reserve opens, Blizzard will change their mind.
---
They aren't expecting too many players for Classic (which is stupid), and the name reserve option will prove how many people are interested in Classic WoW.
---
For raiding, you'll most likely be asked to heal. Ele isnt great because they are very mana inefficient. Enhance is just okay (from what I understand). 
---
That being said, you should stick with what you want to play, you'll find a guild and friends who will still run stuff with you
---
He isnn't saying Human and Orc racials are bad, he's saying they're irrelevant to a lot of classes or passive, which is true except for Perception.
---
So how long until LFR is added to ClassicWoW?
---
i'd rather my immersion be broke on the couple of low level zones bordering level 20 ones than the entire economy and world pvp ruined for the other 99% of the game.
---
Deservedly so.
---
Do you understand how scaling works? The whole premise of layers is that there could be a billion layers hiding behind one "realm". There's no way and no how to encounter some problem scaling above 4, 7, 10 layers per realm. If you have written your software for the concept of layers, and you can have 3 layers running, you can have 1 thousand running. It's all virtualised, containerised and on demand on a whim. There's no need for a citation for a specific number, because you're working with modern virtual cloud and containers.
---
Who has a better story then Brann the Broken?
---
Are you suggesting one person is directly responsible for every decision made by Blizzard regarding WoW?
---
This is going to result in insane amount of anti-*insert nation here.* 
---
And for a good reason. It's incredibly toxic and infuriating to play social mmorpg with people who aren't able or willing to  communicate.
---
Worst. Decision. Ever.
---
I don't get why there wouldn't be Spanish speaking servers. The gamer population in South America is getting bigger every year.
---
As a product of the sub-standard American education system, I only speak one language so the best I can do is play "Is that Spanish or Portuguese?"
---
The problem is that with the massive amount of people that are going to be logging on at the same time, there will be Thousands of people trying to do all of those other quests too. Now I'm not saying layering is the best solution, but there needs to be some sort of way to limit the amount of people in an areas competing for limited resources.

Try casting the subsequent spell before the initial spell releases from your toon.
---
I hope they publish statistics on # of active accounts, and maybe the distribution of max player levels across active accounts.
---
&gt;Fat foods 
---
&gt; Stick with nuts
---
:thinking:
---
Overall it seems like a pretty good idea, so long as they make sure it's temporary and a short 1-2 weeks at that.
---
I just hope the transition out/away of layering goes well.
---
Dumb.
---
Oh I'm fully aware of the zone playing on a pserver, but seems like the leeway will take this to a whole new level.
---
I'd say, Level20+ Zones should not have layering. After Level15 leveling slows down and the Tourists will quit or be way behind anyways. Also after Level20 the Zones split up and you have lots of options to pick from. Before Level20 it makes sense because every Human has to level in Northshire=&gt;Elwynn and a little bit of Westfall before you can go to Darkshore.
---
These days? Probably not because games these days hold your hand through fucking everything.  
---
Back then? I would go kill shit for fun constantly idk what you're talkin bout
---
Did you ever actually play through those expansions or are you just spewing bullshit? 
---
* Vanilla was a mediocre game with some amazing ideas but terrible design. Nothing was like it so people started playing.
---
* Burning Crusade was on the right track adding some QoL stuff and giving Horde a Paladin/Alliance a Shaman. But it introduced shitty flying.
---
* Wrath had an amazing story but it was the beginning of the end.
---
* Cata fucked everything the first three build.
---
* MoP had an amazing world and music. Everything else was crap.
---
* WoD was garbage.
---
* Legion was a *ok it's not terrible but I'd rather play BC* expansion. 
---
* BfA isn't controversial, BfA is just plain bad game design.
---
They are saying from the math in BIS gear you'll lose 1-2% total dps and if your in pre BIS its a lose of ~4%.
---
The way the math works the better your gear is the less this will effect you because its from base damage of the class.
---
BAD IDEA
---
Technically correct, the honor system was revised earlier, in 1.8, and stayed up to and including 1.12.
---
He never said sharding would not exist outside of starter zones.  It was the topic of discussion because everyone made an assumption based off of what Ion actually said.  It's been repeated so much since then that people started believing that he stated what they assumed and taking it as gospel, without looking at the original source.
---
Well, retail drones are still dreaming that Classic will have like 50k player worldwide.
---
So, they keep coming with dumb numbers.

Italian is tough since the classic models have terrible or nonexistent hand animations.

Dying (on purpose) is great 1-10. It's a free mini fast travel.

- Rez 10 seconds away from quest turnin

This is the real problem :( - I planned on rolling on an ENG server so I DON'T have to play with my fellow germans and now I  can't.

Yup. Best second monitor option possible. And always extended.
---
Are you seriously telling me to invest another 300 hours so I can reduce my queue time? I'll have to play soooo many bgs for that to be a time-saver.

propose a solution to fixing layering being exploited and i'll tell you why it will significantly harm the health of the game.

^^^ this guy wants classic that isn't quite classic and is modified to make leveling easier , nice

WotLK was bad too, we were just still in love with the game and hyped about Arthas.
---
* LFD
---
* horrible PvP balance and insta-gibs
---
* the single most EZ mode Heroics and raiding introduction in the game's history...literally every single raid was cleared on day 3 of WotLK with many players not even level capped
---
* the dawn of the WoW age where the endgame content == clear this exact same raid zone 3-4 times on different difficulties
---
That's good to hear. Thank you.
---
I don’t really disagree, Blizzard is put in a tough situation here and they made a decision. Some people like it, some don’t, but the overwhelming majority probably aren’t even paying any attention to the concept/prospect of layering. That’s all I’m saying. The OP asked “how this is acceptable” and my answer is that not many people really care. This sub is a small portion of the actual playerbase, what seems like a hotly contested issue here may fly under the radar of the rest of the players.
---
Dude, people are already extremely reluctant to bring on druid healers to their raid due to their reputation of being literally the worst healer class in vanilla. Why would a raid leader bring a druid who has half of his talent points in feral? You lose out quite a few useful resto talents.
---
Is it passable? Sure, but you're going to be quite literally be at the bottom of the priority list.
---
what morons like you fail to grasp is what happens when a servers layers are still full when p2 happens. In the rule of large numbers SOME servers WONT lose massive amount of population simply through RNG. You okay with 15000 people fighting over 6 ghost mushroom spawns and 1 lotus?
---
Anyone else watching asmongold's dumb ass defending layering cause he's running around with 50 spergs following him? Fucking Cata baby streamer is completely detached from a normal WoW experience and pretends like he knows anything about classic. This guy is such a  moron it's impressive really.
---
As others already mentioned, layering is content wide. You can't disable it "above level 30". It's either on for whole of Kalimdor, or off.
---
So I'd rather petition to disable layering as soon as 1st boss of MC is defeated. So server can enjoy endgame without abusing jumping between layers to gather resources.
---
Fair point.  So what you're saying is... we get older, and high schoolers stay the same age.
---
I didn't have this experience at all. Outside of the starting zone everything was being camped, too.
---
I played \~9pm PST onwards and it was still a gongshow, 50-80 people camping lvl1 mobs, 1 would respawn and 10-15 closest players all run towards it.
---
I actually didnt mind it, was nostalgic, and meant lots of chatting with people and grouping up while waiting. Got to level 6 in \~2 hours.
---
Think you replied to the wrong post buddy.
---
It really has. Blizzard has said most of this stuff almost word for word, and it gets posted daily on this sub.
---
I've still got this conspiracy theory in the back of my mind that they are purposefully going to sabotage Classic so they can say "you thought you did, but you didn't."
---
I was similar, started about 6 moths before BC but didn’t get to 60 before it came out due to deployments. But once classic goes live would like to be part of organized guild that has really all aspects of the game in mind. Cata was also my last expansion that I played reg on, then was away until legion, but only played a couple months. Not tried BFA yet.
---
Yep, that's what I was expecting. Feral white damage was always incredibly consistent in retail. Wouldn't expect a slightly higher range to do much. Plus 96% of middle of the road is still middle of the road.
---
Yeah so vanilla racials like stun resist, axe spec and literally a AP buff that makes you TAKE HALF HEALING.
---
Yeah the concept of an orc is a pretty common villain one, it's almost like warcraft was based on human vs orcs, but that does not make orcs boring one bit.
---
Lmfao. You made sense then got really stupid at the end there.
---
But almost all of the United states operates on EST aaaaaand more than 45% of the population lives in EST with another 29% in CST. Sorry dude not the middle of the work day.   Even if we're talking PST, that's late end of the work day by all standards
---
Can confirm, Arches National park in Utah looks like Mulgore in some cases. So beautiful
---
And if everyone is alone it's back to camping spawns like in the starting zones.
---
I was on the stress test layering didn't do shit to help with mobs in starting areas. So why would they make it in only low cap areas?
---
Can't see the video on the computer I'm on.  Can someone describe it to me?
---
No thanks. I want to play the game on release, not sit in a queue for 15h. Thank god someone like you isn't in charge of a hyped MMO release, "just let the players deal with the clusterfuck", what a fucking nightmare.
---
I remember Burning Legion being the unofficial Polish server in TBC and Wrath. Most people spoke english but polish was defiantly the second most popular language.
---
Then don’t do it
---
2 weeks is too late. Damn 1000 upvotes already
---
The omnipresence of world PVP in contested areas is a good thing about Vanilla. I don't think the doom and gloom is necessarily warranted surrounding layering, but your comment here is a GREAT argument against layering. You should not be able to escape the opposing faction by switching layers - period.
---
I've already sort of considered US servers since the raid time seem better for me. Haven't really decided yet, but this news makes it a bit more likely for me to roll on US.
---
In my area people werent being silly, it was genuinely fun chat, talking about what we'd play once live etc
---
Could you cite the video for me and maybe lightly explain what "leeway" you're talking about?
---
Night elf hunter was the most popular class in original. They will be again probably in Classic once the mobs reach it.. Warriors and mages might be the best dps etc, but they arent easy to level like a hunter is.
---
where he says "you won't see people appearing and disappearing around you" is a lie
---
I can confirm you do on stress test.
---
Just in time to ruin my leveling experience and fuck up the economy
---
Interesting yes. but every time they loose subs to attrition, it snowballs as more people see the sky falling, and look for some other atrium to hang under.
---
Layering is lazy, pathetic, and completely antithetical to the Classic experience. Only acceptable in starting zones.
---
Do you count the support of making sure new patches work, checking for and fixing bugs, and other somesuch?
---
Classic is going to be a finished game being held on a server. They only need people to keep the servers running (so server and DB knowledge) and some spillover of GM service from retail. 
---
There is no way you can compare the numbers from a live, changing and current game to a finished, not changing, leave bugs as is version. Its not a comparable scenario.
---
I'm thinking mage, rogue of warrior. I will be both PvPing and PvEing. Just so hard to choose.... 
---
I'd like to outplay in PvP, be competitive in PvE , have different specs to choose from etc...
---
Id be doing enhance. Does it have aoe or cleave? And how far is it behind in terms of damage?
---
How does the introduction of layering change anything about the queue? It's still the same realm, you just don't see the people. Nothing is different, other than a second instance of objects and mobs that you don't have to compete for with person B. You sure you know what layering does?
---
It only shows how terrible layering is, that people rather pick sharding
---
NO LAYERING!  NO SHARDING! NO CHANGES!
---
This \^
---
On N-dale, yes, caves were a bloody nightmare but the net result was still a positive.  When an area isn't heavily camped, the spawn rate drops back down.  I don't for a second think blizz is aiming for what we had last night after the servers were crunched down to two.  I think that was part of their test.  But it did suck enough sitting there waiting for mobs.  Having experienced dynamic on pservers, i'd say its a definite net positive with much room for tweaking and improvement in cases like caves where it really just turns them into places where you die instantly.
---
Rng is definitely brutal haha.
---
That's called sharding.
---
Yes, you get all these benefits from playing on the overpopulated side why is it controversial you have some kind of negative effect along with all the massive benefits?
---
If you dont want the queue issue perhaps pick a less one sides server? We definitely have the data today to show you how servers are largely going to look very early on.
---
a guy is in an empty gurabasi arena, he gets an invite -&gt; get layerd in an arena with people -&gt; kills someone -&gt; runs away and gets invited in another layer and everyone that was going to atack him was gone.
---
I 'member!
---
Trust but verify.
---
I trust, but we'll have to wait a few weeks in to verify.
---
Those are some fantastic well thought out arguments you presented to support your stance.
---
All the old players went to bed at 8pm as is custom. :P Nah, but I did log off around 8:30C to go to bed, and I suspect a lot of people were leaving around 8-9pmEST for dinner or bedtime/family time.
---
Well that sounds like stupidity on their part, if true. When your beta tester tells you "the fundamental design of this expansion is broken and will piss everyone off", you really ought to investigate, because if true, you'll lose a lot of *paying customers*.
---
Yep, one more night!
---
Yep I happily accept it because I know that it's the lesser of two evils and will greatly increase my enjoyment of the game for the remainder of its life cycle after pahse 1.
---
No you can’t.
---
That is almost my exact experience. I played a dwarf priest to 7 last night and left with a new battle net friend. It was great.
---
Everyday we stray further from God.
---
I think and hope it will be that way as well. I also hope French, German and Spanish people get their own server because most of them really don't even want to try speaking English.
---
Yes, you are.
---
No we dont.
---
To be fair when I was playing vanilla I would see an exploit abuse at least 4 or 5 times a week.
---
This is my general rule of thumb: If its exploitable it will be exploited.
---
Nobody has mentioned aoe farming for bijous in zg yet. For that I think you will need to Respec to a proper aoe farming build, but it will likely be well worth it as long as you can devote a few hours to it. It's a very profitable method of farming if you can pull it off.
---
For normal mobs or maybe 5-man elites with good gear maybe you can do it in fire spec.
---
That’s not the point. I don’t want to be picked into a zone with anonymous people. If the starting zone is super packed and someone is super nice and chill, or that person is an asshole, down the road we’ll run into each other and there will be a good or bad social consequence. 
---
Current retail can ‘pack’ people in an AV but I literally don’t care about a single one of them.
---
I can see we're done here, thanks for the enlightening discussion.
---
No, that $200 million number had nothing to do with further development. It was strictly infrastructure and personnel costs.
---
Well my attempt at being rude backfired because I typed incorrectly. Shows me for being a dick.
---
Yep. So seeing 205 other people instead of 400 other people in a starting zone is _literally ruining the whole game_? Mmk. If a whole sub makes you sad you might need to check yourself.
---
World bosses is phase 2 though, so it's entirely in line with the criticism of layering.
---
I thought layering was just in starting zones?
---
How can you tell if you got accepted to the beta or just the stress test?
---
You dont realized layering hurts economy since week 1? If they keep layering as it is, I already have a tactic to abuse it very early on to make quite a money
---
I think it's worth mentioning both games share some files(at least for ptr or betas). You absolutely don't have to download BfA but if you do, classic will take like 2 GBs of space. So if you ever considered playing both it doesn't take much space as you'd expect.
---
As annoying and imperfect as layering is, any petition to stop it will need to come with an alternative that you're willing to accept. If Classic goes live with nothing to alleviate overpopulation, the game may be borderline unplayable. If you let several thousand players into a server and don't do anything at all, it's a total shitshow even after level 30 or whatever limit you come up with. Can you imagine eight hundred players trying to quest in Tanaris? Each level will take a whole day.
---
Overpopulation doesn't just magically go away at level 30, or 40. Not even at 50, if the servers are 5-10k population. If there are no mechanics in place to alleviate the problem, the entire game will be crippled by overcrowding. It will be next to impossible to get anything done in non-instanced content, even in the later levels. If not layering, what's the solution?
---
So now we're looking at alternatives. We can already surmise that Blizzard don't want to open hundreds of servers, which is why we've got layering in the first place, so smaller servers are out. We also don't want phasing or cross-realm zones or whatever, it's even worse than layering. So that leaves us with instant respawns on mobs and quest objects, aka dynamic respawning. 
---
And it will most certainly have to be almost instant in order to fix the problem that we create by removing layering. There could easily be 20+ players competing for every mob, every ground spawn, everything. Merely cutting respawns in half doesn't do a whole lot if there's ten times as many players as was originally intended, so we're looking at instant respawns.
---
Now we've got instant respawns! Hurray! Except now the market is absolutely flooded with resources, mages AoE-farm everywhere, some quests become impossible because you get overrun by respawns, it becomes almost impossible to level classes that can't consistently take on two mobs at a time, and the game doesn't even really resemble vanilla WoW anymore.
---
Or we can quit being irrational crybabies who demand a perfect, flawless vanilla experience while hysterically rejecting the methods by which a playable game is possible. Layering is the least problematic solution. It's the one that doesn't change actual mechanics and the one that least interferes with gameplay. If you think Classic can launch with no solutions at all and be fine, you're out of your mind and will cry even harder when you're still level 7 after three days.

Basically what I'm looking at is it being even harder to get melee out of your deadzone now with leeway.
---
It doesn't feel like a win when you have a 4 minute 1v1 only for them to bubble hearth at the last second.
---
Leveling, spells, professions, gear going from quest items to dungeon and to raid items in a slow but steady progression and so on. Try playing other RPGs then retail wow and you'll find out.
---
Looks so much more clean than all the other ones out there. I would love to see a download link even if its nowhere near done so I can try putting in my own route (for personal use of course) I am pretty clueless about writing addons but I have at least figured out how to edit quests in ones like this.

Looking for Guild:
---
**REQUIREMENTS**
---
* Alliance
---
* PvP Server
---
* Raiding Days:  Monday, Wednesday and/or Thursday.  At least two of those three days.
---
* Raid Times:  Must be scheduled to conclude no later than 11 PM EST, and must start no sooner than 6 PM EST.
---
**ABOUT ME**
---
I plan to play a Gnome Mage.  I was a hardcore raider in the vanilla days.  Cleared everything except Sapphiron and KT.  I was the MT for my raiding guild.  I plan to take the first 8 days after release to race to 60 as quickly as possible (I'm taking off work the entire first week).
---
THANK YOU.   
---
These fools arguing for layering are going to be the first ones to drop off the server after they've leveled to 10 or whatever.  It's hordes of BFA kids wanting the "classic experience" everyone talks about, but they want it tailored for them. Ironic.
---
Definitely trying that. I had hellish lungs for the first hour or two
---
Monkeynews has a history of finding abusable bugs and is a S+ player. Im glad they let him into the beta.
---
Do you ever notice that when the topic of layering with regards to PvP comes up, it's never "Layering is great cause I got out of a gank" it's always "Layering sucks because I couldn't gank that guy!"  But I digress.
---
It may be naive, sure, but I still don't think layering is ultimately going to matter that much once we get 6mo-1yr down the road.  People are just freaking out about the short term ramifications of the potential abuse.
---
If you're wondering why you never get second dates or invites to things from your "friends". This is why.
---
And thats what happens if you wear a dress to PvP
---
And honestly if anyone asked people would probably party up and go kill shit too.   
---
can't do the starter area because its too populated? cool go grab like 3-4 other dudes and go do a different area TOGETHER.
---
I'm so sick of hitting max level at this point that I am rushing to 60. This is also how you get rich. Being the first in the market for herbs or devilsaur leather for a lot of things can secure your cash flow indefinitely. That's what I view as my fun in the game. I've already experienced leveling multiple times on Nost/Elys/LH, where I really lost out on was AQ and Naxx.  
---
People have their preferences. This whole argument of rushing vs. no rushing is straight up the dumbest thing. You're going to experience leveling regardless. It's the same fucking process, you're going to meet people even if you are rushing and still have just as much fun.

I recently purchased a Razer blade. Since I travel a lot. I have the 9th gen i7 9750H? I think it is with a rtx2070. I ran around a lot in different areas like org and stuff. It wasn’t as crowded as usual but still got a decent idea from what I can do now.. 
---
On their recommended settings I was running around 380-400 FPS with a dip to 350-360 in major and semi populated zones. On all maxed settings I was closer to 280-290 FPS and in major and semi populated zones it dipped to about 240-260. 
---
In BFA I cap my frames at 100 and stay there unless I’m in Org it drops to about 80 FPS. The other cities are still closer to the 100 mark . I believe if I unlock my frames I’m closer to 120-140 on the areas that are capped .
---
Again though, I haven’t played beta. Only stress tests so these numbers could be higher since it’s not full pop and such. But a good reference I think
---
im just too lazy to check for proper spots to die to save some time except that IF bay place :(
---
I wonder if theyre trying to be conservative, as I can imagine it's hard to gauge how many actual players they will get. I imagine things will improve when they get real numbers/actual players/launch day
---
I grouped with a fellow traveler I’ve never met when questing in Mulgore and we came across a chest. We both decided to roll on the chest and shared the loot if the other person could have used it. We both laughed and said “that’s the first time in a long time losing a roll really felt okay.” 
---
Just the teamwork and the overall thought that it’s better to quest together and everyone benefit makes me so excited to really get back into Classic. Thanks fellow traveler for the great experience!
---
So many people talking that don't seem to have any idea of why they are even including layering in the release. They FULLY understand what vanilla WoW was, they've never even once said that layering was part of vanilla WoW or even implied as much. They KNOW it's detrimental to the vanilla experience and have said as much, but think it's a necessary evil to handle the launch. And I dont understand how you can think layering will magically make the zones NOT crowded. They will be just as crowded as they were back in vanilla. You'll be just as "blasted" by the amount of people now as you were back then. Lastly, sorry, but what *you* want to do does not matter in the slightest.
---
"For the alliance" is a fairly new thing. Ive had a number of posts back in the day about how the alliance needs to update their PR department. Horde symbol &gt; alliance symbol, loktar, for the horde &gt; we didnt have anything before we stole the horde's " for the _____"
---
yeah I get ya, I've been subbed for a long time myself, not doing anything for free.
---
dynamic spawn times. They figured that shit out on private servers and it works like a charm.
---
Like paid server transfers lol
---
Check out this video, I think it would be a very smart start from people who tested. 
---

---
T'en fais pas ils sont pas mieux en face xD
---
Same here. Played for thirty minutes this morning and got another group to kill wendigos. It was just like playing back in the day.
---
Projecting much are we now? :^)
---
Exactly. It doesn't work to break apart the layers because that's basically just sharding at that point. Have you noticed any significant issues from layering on the beta?
---
Npc!!
---
&gt;you know that l337 means elite, you get it
---
Great argument, let me present my argument to you:
---
&gt;you know that pog means to be excited about something, you get it
---
Just because you're out of the loop doesn't change the situation.
---
Aaaaaaaand the retort starts with an insult. Shocking.
---
So riddle me this. It says they don't shard and layering is continent based. Are they sharding and lying about it? I saw multiple orcs and tauren in starting zones fade in and out of my vision suddenly. Then at some point later, the population seemed to die down. This seems like sharding???! It was the stress test. 
---
Idk seems like corporate just doesn't want to fund the servers that heavily because I feel like there's an easier but not as cheap way to have multiple healthy runs. I also think they underestimate how many people wanna leave retail. This game will get people hooked in not scare them off imo.
---
Exactly. It's really not a big deal at all... people just need something to be triggered about at all times. I'm all for it. The people who aren't for it clearly haven't played the stress tests where hundreds of people are standing around trying to get mob tags. Spoiler: it's not fun. Once leveling spaces around to normal concentrations it will be fine and at that point layering will be gone.
---
Not too controversial there.  I wasn't there for the launch of vanilla wow but there weren't 10k people on a server.  If they don't want people quitting before they hit level 10, they need some layering at the start.  I don't know how patient people will be grinding mobs because they can't find any quest mobs for 5 hours just to hit level 10.
---
On the discussion of "stream sniping", I think it's absolutely ridiculous that a streamer known for their "pvp" is complaining about getting wrecked. There are so many things that a streamer can do to avoid getting sniped; roll a pve server, add a delay to the stream, or call for help like the rest of us (except these fucks have a lil army of mindless drones that can answer even faster than general chat), or how about turn the fucking stream off for 5 minutes? This whole discussion has convinced my group of friends to actually stream snipe. Welcome to classic, don't advertise your position.
---
Human for alliance, Troll for horde. 
---
Really though just play whatever you want. Being able to show up on time every night with consumables is far more important than race choice.
---
Well id say udead are the humans of the horde since im a basic human / udead bitch.
---
Dont know everyone playing certain races give me an  impression based on the races. 
---
Gnome.

Little annoying guy

Only  normal guy beside human

I just wanna play a game

Wannabe badass being a small and thin guy irl

A cow.. Like chill but i always stop myself on asking why youd roll them
---
Dingo maan, im stoned all the time so excuse me if i brainafk during dungeons
---
Udead
---
I honestly just chose them because the others are worse
---
I'd personally rather have layering than aby length queue to play. I'm booking time off work to play on release. I don't want and cannot afford 120+ minute waits to get into a server. I say 120+ mins as that's how long it was for me sometimes during vanilla. 
---
I understand the problems with layering and I'd prefer guaranteed play with the problems it temporarily brings.
---
I sense a lot of people either did not experience or have forgotten how bad the queues were and re-queuing if you disconnected. Every day there were posts on the Blizzard forums complaining at massive length - thousands of posts.
---
so it is Classic = DoA
---
Beta only has 2 servers.
---
I started playing when the server opened. How the hell am I to know which side will be overpopulated? 
---
How am I supposed to know in August??
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Test. Bobby b do you hear me?
---
Says the one whining like a bitch.
---
Just had to shoot yourself in the foot that close before launch, eh Blizz?
---
Ah, I see now. I'm glad I've decided to level up a Hunter second time around this time. Good god. I didn't realize how fucked I was as a Tauren Hunter back in the day. I had no idea of this leeway mechanic even existing.
---
Ok bub.
---
Enhance is not a contender at all when it comes to dps.  If you want to be a Nightfall slave then you'll be contributing, otherwise you will be carried or brought just for windfury totem.
---
I'm sure it's been brought up in the comments but what you are referring to is "sharding".
---
Layering is continent wide, it doesn't matter what zone you are in, you are in a specific layer wherever you go on that continent.
---
You skip quests here that I don't think you would skip if you intended to level beyond 15.
---
Cons outweigh the pros.
---
There's others in this thread describe the reasons I'll leave it to them.
---
did they say there would be EU stress tests?
---
I was sort of keeping track of you and a hunter with /who. Cool to see how you did it.
---
Starting out with an insult is not a way to ingratiate me into reading the rest of the response. It's a quick way for me to dismiss out of hand what is being stated.
---
This makes it seem somewhat bearable tbh

Good to know these are the people that defend layering.
---
I was assuming the chain was talking about dps feral cats.
---
As per feral tanks, probably still higher tps than prot warriors. People are obviously overreacting as always.
---
That’s something i could get behind. We love a good challenge.
---
Taunt me one more time and I swear I'll go on strike wearing my yellow vest.
---
BR
---
Sheep, go play retail please.
---
Wouldn't hunters have the smallest deadzone. As they have extra melee reach?
---
OH MAN I PLAY POKEMON GO GUYS MY ARGUMENT IS INVALID
---
I feel like if you ask the top healers from the private server scene what they think the best healing class is, you would get equal parts shaman, paladin, and priest as the answer.  The only one that lags behind (and admittedly my favorite) is druid.
---
Not true. Invites are just rare now.
---
That looks fantastic. Thanks for the link!
---
Did you even read what I wrote? Layering is not the primary fix for overpopulation which dynamic respawns tries to address (which it does poorly and is easily exploitable btw).
---
I wish I had room for a second monitor but my pc station only has enough room for my single ultra wide
---
I'm talking about getting first kills on bosses at minimum item level. Not farm run speed kills.
---
Anyone else tired of the constant layer=bad, gib karma plz posts? Seriously, at this point it's not even constructive criticism, it's just people being mad about layering existing period and acting like they've discovered the streamer clip that will change everyone's minds about it. 
---
Well we're not. We like what layering is trying to achieve. 
---
Yes, there are absolutely problems that NEED to be fixed before launch. Yes, Blizzard has a track record of not fixing bugs like that before launch. No, you gatekeeping, whining, and being a child about layering isn't going to change the fact it will be present in Classic for at least the first few weeks and likely all of phase 1.
---
So make a choice: Put on your big boy/ girl pants, accept layering will exist, and provide meaningful feedback on the problems that are being found and exposing them to blizzard and the testers. The other option is not to play classic and not engage with the community anymore. Posts like this have only served to divide the community over something none of us can change anyways. It's literally pointless to go back and forth over it. If layering ruins this game for you that badly, don't play, and while you're at it, don't ruin it for everyone who still enjoys it despite the 'problems '. 
---
I want to enjoy having conversations with people on here about talent choices and theory crafting, how to enjoy the game more, etc. But the longer this plague of hatred for layering exists, the worse off this subreddit will be for it.
---
TLDR: Be constructive or be quiet
---
Really?  We used to call each other faggots all the time in general/region chat and nothing was done.
---
/who
---
At least I don't beat around the bush like a beta trying desperately to sound smart.

Oh look, it's the guy who will build an optimal raid comp then struggle to clear MC.

So it turns out the Boston data center moved to New York in July 2010, which ruins my tea joke but is actually even better for you. Average ping between London and NY is 76ms.

Cookie-cutter fire spec doesn't include PoM. He almost certainly won't have it.
---
What? You seemed to have replied to one of my comments but the contents of your comment is out of context to my reply.
---
Someone please talk me through it. I’m very excited about the population, I’m very excited about “being there” around launch, I’m excited for a fresh game.
---
However I’m DREADING 80 other level 3s trying to kill the boars that I’m trying to kill or pick up the linens I’m trying to collect etc. it sounds like a nightmare
---
Did you just forgot about the continent of America?
---
so does pepperidge farms.
---
Yes, it was amazing. Great memories of the excitement for the game.
---
All caps, still no point about layering being good, and definitely upset.
---
Summer break special.
---
True. Druid TPS was never their issue anyway, but rather their lack of comparative survivability
---
&gt; I haven't seen any posts regarding it, only comments here and there. 
---
Either you didn't look or you're a dirty liar
---
Right now on it's current implementation the cons outweighs the pros
---
I was referring more to the hole software and video games as a service aspect that EA makes more from than a finished actual product. The product quality was there until the merger. Why do you think wow has a cash shop and offers paid for boosting service when it goes against the whole original mantra of world of warcraft?
---
&gt; also literally never once was I concerned about dying. just run in rick roll everything for a kill quest, collect some shit in the same area, and do one quest that either saved someone or progressed the story of that area.
---
This started in WotLK far as I recall and yes it fucking sucks. It's not engaging whatsoever when you balance the questing so that I basically can't ever die and never have to worry about my HP.
---
Try a TBC private server and a WotLK private server. As a level 60 in Hellfire Penninsula you will usually die if you pull an extra mob by accident. Meantime as a level 70 in Borean Tundra you're just yoloing through mobs easily, and the only thing you're ever worried about while running through packs on your mount is that if you get dazed you'll have to waste time killing them all.
---
whooshed like a filthy, sniveling millennial.
---
Never go full Pepega my dude.
---
Blizzard said they are done with invites awhile ago
---
I play with 150ms currently on the stress test and its not noticeable at all
---
Who is owned by?
---
A good raiding guild will want to run the fewest number of hunters possible.  That is either 2 or 3.  That means that those few slots will be very competitive so keep that in mind.
---
Feral is for both cat and bear.
---
Communicating with people in a random dungeon in english is fine. But if I want to make any friends in classic WoW I'd prefer to do that in my mothers tongue.
---
3.6 rotegen not great, not terrible either.
---
A bit off topic, but I agree. Maybe I am just old, but I find it difficult to navigate some of these "modern" sites.
---
Couldn't agree more with this. Like compared to layering this is fucking HUGE. Layering will only be a problem for a few weeks - nothing over the time span we will play Classic - but THIS will shape our whole experience. Blizzard, please, think about this again!!
---
Yeah honestly I am planning to level a priest as an alt with my friends but was having doubts about shadow after seeing so many people talk about their mana problems. Watching this video reassured me that it will be fine. Yeah you wont be able to fight forever like a warlock or druid but it's really not that bad
---
I agree that it's going to be tough for everyone else.
---
And I fell sad for those that do not get a server in their native language. It was an awesome sense of community when you knew that everyone you played with and encountered in the world speaks your native language.
---
It's not even a matter of not being able to speak english, but that many people feel more comfortable in their own native language.
---
Also imaging joining a server and finding out a month (and probably 40-60 levels) later that one server is the "unofficial" server of your language. Must be awful.
---
I worry that they think that there will not be enough german/english/french people to fill a server of each type per language. IMO they underestimate the size of these communities.
---
I wouldn't say "pro" shaman. He got 3 crits on a swing which is very hard to do. He just happened to do it to a streamer.
---
He is good however. You can tell he didn't expect to get the 1 shot and stomped to go for another hit.
---
I agree on pretty much everything you said but expiration date is a "promise" waiting to be broken.  
---
They have described absolutely no sensible mechanism by which all mega-servers will have settled down to 2006-like concurrency numbers (\~3k) so they can collapse to 1 layer by Phase 2.  
---
They're just kicking the problem down the road and we'll be back here discussing mergers or spinning up more mega-servers when P2 is about to roll around.  
---
Because you only get to pick 
---
* 2006-like layer caps
---
* 1 layer per server (= 1 Kazzak, 1 Azu, x1 of Emerald Dragons per server)
---
Not both.  
---
What is most likely to happen if the implementation details remain as they are currently is
---
* layer caps increasing to whatever the infrastructure can hold so each megaserver can be 1 layer that is \*\*not\*\* 3k strong (ie kicking the problem again further down the road)
---
* layer caps staying in place but world bosses bound to a random layer (and having to scout across layers and form raid on the layer where Kazzak is at, similar to how you fish for Rend in UBRS)
---
In any case if any blue has explained \_\_how mega-servers will collapse to 1 layer by P2\_\_ and not just described why that not happening is problematic, I'd like to know.
---
Because they wanted classic for the post-leveling part of the game.
---
Ah. Never got to AQ So never was allowed to dabble in fire :P
---
Why would you spend that long on a time gated quest when you could just grind 12 mobs for the same 600 exp from that quest lmfao
---
Sounds like a pretty good experience.
---
I think mine started that way, but quickly turned into Chuck Norris jokes, comments about giving Omar sexual favors for a beta invite, and some very (and I mean brutally) vulgar language.
---
Disappeared pretty quickly when I left the starter area, though.
---
I completely agree with you. Insulting people while trying to illustrate a point is counter intuitive but layering is an imperfect system that will still have people needing to change realms just most likely less then if they launched with 500 realms and no layering
---
No layering period. Implement sister servers that share name and guild reservations like Blackrock-1, Blackrock-2.  Once population drops these servers merge together.
---
I agree, on horde side all Races are good for warrior and have different good boni, so just play what you think looks good to you.
---
Orc with axes, and hardiness. Undead with fear resist and tauren with the AoE stun for normal mobs all great.
---
I don't know to much about Alli sorry
---
Just a tip: with a group of 2-3 players you don't even need to do the starting zone at launch. Just leave and go grind level 5-6 mobs until you are a high enough level for the next zone (level 4-5).
---
Just remove layering, if you can't handle questing with a lot of people, just don't play on launch.
---
No Canadians are allowed in too
---
&gt; US Pacific &amp; US East get 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
&gt; US Central &amp; US Mountain get 1 PVP and 1 PVE.
---
&gt; Europe gets 3 PVP, 3 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
&gt; Russia gets 1 PVP and 1 PVE.
---
&gt; China gets 4 PVP and 4 PVE.
---
&gt; Korea and Taiwan get 1 PVP and 1 PVE.
---
&gt; **31 realms.**
---
wat, how the hell does that add up to 31?
---
Going by your numbers that's 24 (5 US, 7 EU, 2 RUS, 8 CN, 2 Korea+Taiwan).
---
Lol lots more people will join the English speaking servers than only the UK. I wouldn't be able to stand people talking to me in Dutch or French in tradechat. Even though I speak both.
---
Yeah being warlock is similar, you just fear all day until youre happy with the amount of trash he pulled.
---
Tbh. Is there a class that cannoutplay spriest or warlock in wpvp? I only loose if i roll alliance warlock because of undead but rolling horde is overkill
---
Orc is BiS race for tanking until you get Thunderfury, then it's tauren.  Unless of course the parry haste meta becomes a thing then maybe troll is a closer contender after all.
---
Randoms and pugs should pay up, guildies should get it free
---
Jesus. The bad news just keep coming.
---
Why would they think the community wasn't as good? Based on the current state of beta, the vast majority of players will not even see the effects of layering. By the time most players would notice it, bored at 60 looking to do world PvP, it'll likely either already be disabled or the population will calm down to the point that most realms have one layer even when it's enabled.
---
I'm purposefully avoiding streams and private servers. I am in agony waiting but it sure beats being burned out already
---
When people couldn't get the mobs in the level 1-5 area, they started ruining the fex-ex quests, then running to the capital, dinged level 2, then starting grinding the mobs in the 5-9 range.
---
Didn't take long so that even when you made it out of the stating area, you were still fighting for mobs from level 2's..
---
Ended up logging out going to dinner and coming back, it was much better then.
---
I'll take layering over not having Classic WoW.
---
EU is better than US when you can Brexit your way onto an English-only realm. That won't be possible in Classic.
---
And do you really think enough of our non-English speakers play WoW for you to ever notice them? There's more Chinese farmers than that on every single realm.
---
In world pvp everyone is undead.
---
If you DC someone in a bg you'll get ganked again by someone with the CD up.
---
Says the guy so upset that I am indifferent about layering that you had to go dig through my profile to find a post about me playing Pokemon go? 
---
Ok.
---
That's what happens when you let an enhancement shaman purge you then casually walk into melee range.  Sucks to suck
---
&gt;“be accommodating to new players” 
---
This means they want the new players to actually be able to play the game.......
---
How much?
---
you are so full of shit it's mind boggling
---
Using beta as an insult in 2019. 
---
So edgy. 
---
&gt;  It seems Blizzard doesn't trust Classic to be popular enough.
---
long term.  You know what comes out after nax?  more naxxramas.
---
Well they decided on a retail WoW client so pretty dumb a billion dollar company doesn't have backs.
---
I like how they're passing it off as giving us more choice. How are we supposed to avoid or find the players we're looking for if we don't know where they are?
---
blizzard literally destroys the tower of babel
---
Good mushrooms tho 😂👌
---
Please stop posting the same thing lol
---
Hows it gonna ruin the economy? More ore/herbs on the AH? All that means is that they'll be cheaper than they would have been otherwise
---
Yep, I'd prefer your mother's tongue too.
---
Seriously - its more likely to lead to fun times in game with everyone joking - dueling - going on unplanned adventures like ..... Do people forget how much there is to do for fun?   
---
Just GO ON AN ADVENTURE FOR A BIT -- starter zones aren't going anywhere
---
Activision-Blizzard is not owned by EA. Maybe you’re thinking of BioWare.
---
I would much rather they go with a dynamic respawn and less or no layering as the solution.  I understand though that isn't the perfect solution either.  In the end, i know they care about doing their best to replicate the classic experience and i view layering as a sort of necessary evil. 
---
I truly do hope that it's only for the first few weeks.  At the same time, i don't know how they can possibly know what the player base will look like after the initial pop on August 27th.  I am of the mind that anyone who gets to level 10 will have a pretty strong chance of sticking around.  Once you see your three talent trees for the first time and get to spend your first point, the addiction of building your character really starts to take off.  
---
If the game performs spectacularly, like beyond anyones most optimistic dreams then i don't know how they can get rid of layers.  I want the game to do well, but not THAT well.
---
I wasn't trying to bring any points, just stating facts. You're the one who got all up in arms and started skimming my profile in response to me pointing out facts. 
---
I think it's a good thing because I'd rather have layering than not have classic WoW at all. :)
---
I hope not.
---
You are joking but this is exactly how I learned English back in vanilla. I landed on pure English (Burning blade EU) realm not knowing there was a so-called Russian realm (Warsong EU). So I had no other choice but to begin improving my vocabulary. I ended up leading the weirdest guild that consisted of 50% Russians and 50% Europeans that were able to communicate almost exclusively through me and my friend. And somehow we were pretty successful raiding guild all the way through TBC. We even had 2 separate Teamspeak servers. Good old times...
---
Hey how does PvP work on a French server? Like is the winner the first person to /surrender or something?
---
I have yet to see anyone with any credence in large scale application infrastructure design suggest a better alternative to layering.
---
That's probably why layering was chosen as the best of the bad options.
---
30?!? It was supposed to be starting zones only!!
---
FYI for anyone wondering. The default loot scheme is "group loot". If you're with a group that you trust, you should set it to "free for all" so that everyone can loot corpses for quest items. Like if you finish first for some reason, now your party has a chance for quest items on all the mobs that would've been assigned to you.
---
This is about the EU servers though, NA servers might still have a Spanish one I guess?
---
I remember that the German client back then had alot of names still in English. There was some discussion about it, because some people felt that direct translated German names sound silly. By now though, everything as far as I know is translated.
---
So there weren't any German abbreviations for dungeons.
---
God, imagine finding out you're on a server where the majority of the population only speak English as a second language?
---
It'd be like playing on a US server....
---
Most people are for the layering but, then again most people have jobs. Just ignore the beardlings. They are little more then a loud angry minority.
---
I was actually assuming the opposite, it would grow but maybe they will have some code in there for this.  Also, if they are able to keep the deadzone the same, just think about barely outzoning a Tauren warrior and still have him meleeing you.
---
Oh geez my condolences. No spot to mount above or anything?
---
They not ZERO say because they are not affiliated.
---
In an interview, the lead of the classic project straight up said the server technology could easily support 1000 players in goldshire, but the player interaction and mob limitations would be the issue. So I get the idea of layering, Im fine with it as long as it goes away after a few weeks/month.
---
what im suggesting is that everyone in charge is incompetent and/or dumb.
---
I like how you leveled up to level 4 just by walking and dying a lot. :D
---
Is appealing for language reasons as someone from the UK. But, also hope to make some irl friends and may be nice to meet them some day who knows. America doesn't work for me for that reason. But thanks for the invitation!
---
I just got into beta and I cannot kill a kobold vermin in northshire even with layering. Trust me it's a neccessary evil.
---
*sees enemy preist on boat
---
/g: Someone invite me to their layer please.
---
WRONG
---
I mean, I would like to try this logically here. I loved multibox playing 2 characters fully in dungeons doing RAF leveling. So I can think of how this MIGHT be possible (though the high APM comments aren't wrong).
---
If you could come up with some way to easily individually toggle on and off inputs for each of the 40 raid members, and find some way to logically use click to move that accounted for different camera orientations or something, you could conceivably start working on strats to pull it off. The actual mechanics of most Vanilla raids don't come quite as often as more recent ones, so its just a matter of memorizing a series of inputs a few times in a fight and getting through that.
---
They could probably smell the horde stench clinging to your account.
---
No. Hell even the anime sword art online sorta covers this right away. Main character is like "Well fuck the starter zones are going to get farmed out ILL GO AHEAD AND START FARMING ELSE WHERE"  
---
Its not rocket science man.
---
Not true at all, people still did city raids in legion my guy.
---
This needs to get more attention.
---
EvE lends itself to segregating by language due to how corps / alliances work along with the fact that there is no real need to ever ‘group’ with people outside large scale pvp.
---
That being said, outside the large Russian blocs, generally everything was run in English with people translating at a Corp level if necessary.
---
See this is where you realize this guy has no tact and is just a Blizzard shill with no actual points worth discussing.

Because people love scaremongering, it’s that simple. People want a reason to be pissed. If it wasn’t phasing it would be the Addon API, or that the client says patch 1.13, or lack of progressive patches. People just want to be mad. It’s fucking stupid, but that’s just people. Stupid fucking pack animals addicted to outrage.
---
This is exactly like vanilla, perfect recreation.
---
August 27th is soooo far away :(  
---
Fall is my favorite season, but i never thought i'd be actively wishing for a summer to pass by.
---
A droit! 
---
Finally my highschool french will pay off. Ask where the public pool is!
---
I only played Horde in vanilla. I plan to play Alliance this time through and explore the zones and quests I'm unfamiliar with.
---
I don't understand. If you're talking about BoE gear, tell them to level their bank alt to 5 and pick up enchanting.  If it happens in a dungeon, I assume they roll for it and you DE on the spot and trade. At least that is how people approach lockpicking.  If you don't want to, tell them you can't DE then just greed roll, they can vendor if they win.
---
no its really not - its not like you do 100% of the quests in the game anyway the whole things is supposed to be an adventure. Its not really supposed to be linear do X then go to X then do X then the next spot ---- youre SUPPOSED to vary it up. Not everyone will have the same adventures and there is 0 wrong with going somewhere else to farm a bit.
---
Honestly after playing the Beta. Tauren Warrior might be better then Orc. Dude I felt close to a damn archer with how long my range is. The orc being way better is from private servers where they didn't bring in the increased melee range. Because holy fuck is it increased. It's honestly kind of annoying while grinding because I frequently kill mobs I can't loot after death because they are too far away.
---
I only mained alliance back then because I love drawfs
---
I work until 18 GMT, so my concern would be finding a guild that raids in the afternoon in the US.
---
&gt; I think it's a good thing because I'd rather have layering than not have classic WoW at all. :)
---
&gt;I’d rather eat my food raw then have no food at all.
---
I really hope you don’t have kids.
---
After I logged into the stress yesterday I’m fine with layiering for the first 20 lvls cause god damn 3 hours for 3 lvls my god
---
aaaand I still do not know what layering is!
---
So lets get this straight, 495 dead realms is your solution?
---
Ok that's why nobody is knocking on your door with a paycheck to fix it.
---
Being russian it sucks to hear news like that, we got our community split now :(
---
I'm crying!
---
Is it called beta in the launcher?
---
I like the idea of porting you back to a major city when joining a party with someone on another layer and having your character be assigned to a layer rather than account.  
---
As far as the porting back to a major city, you could easily have a countdown like the instance hearth countdown allowing a person to cancel the port and leave the group.  This would solve most of the problems where you know someone is on another layer that has the arena chest or untapped herbs etc because the character would still have to travel all the way back to what they are intending to abuse with sharding.  The biggest downside would be what, people having an additional hearth?
---
Having a character assigned to a layer, rather than an account would prevent a lot of the relogging to another character to get a different shard.
---
Go warrior. Mage competes with priest for gear and you can share loot better. Warrior with a duo healer is loads better than solo. 
---
Also even if you’re going to be super casual, having the tank/healer means any dungeon is easy to group for since most classes are DPS and easiest to fill. You’ll be able to do dungeons more often because of this since you never have to wait for a tank or healer.
---
I’m not playing because of layering.
---
Meeting familiar faces throughout your leveling journey is critical; and it just won’t be there.
---
What happens when you find out there are more UK players on a US server than there are on the EU servers with their 24 languages in one chat channel?
---
What the fuck? 84?
---
Im more offended by people that dont take screenshots.
---
As someone who maintained a very strong feral set on the live classic servers, druids actually had very, very strong threat.  Maul had an insane threat modifier on it.  Unless you got a massive string of parries, you weren't losing agro.
---
I was on an unofficial language server during the original WoW, it was horrible, like 50% of people you couldn't even speak to
---
This is by far the worst decision they made yet - seems like they don't understand what this means for a lot of people in EU.
---
so do it on the weekend
---
The horde's marketing department was S tier.
---
Makes no sense. Not every person knows english. Many people can't even write down a phrase that makes sense.
---
Assuming every european player knows how to communicat in english is just wrong.
---
To be fair, Retail has come a long way since WoD too. I used to get below 30fps in the Ashran cities with like 5 people there in that expansion, now it runs in smooth 60-90 in Orgrimar with literally ~70 players on screen. No changes made to my setup whatsoever.
---
Makes me feel like it's something they are going to have to deal with because it isn't Vanilla like.  I know there is a lot of pushback out there already on this.
---
This is horrendous news.
---
I second the private server thing. Retail isn't terrible but it is a different experience. I just recently couldn't stand the hype anymore and joined one for the first time. I plan on making a dwarf hunter (like I did in the old days) so for the private server I made an orc shaman. I've never played one of them before so I get to see a new area and try a new to me class, and I won't be sad when it shuts down since I want to play alliance "officially." So I'd say it might be a good idea for you to use the next couple months on a private server to test out different classes and races and see what you like best, then you'll be good to go with your favorite and have a decent handle on early leveling when classic drops!
---
Still need a cap on it or youll break it - but not a bad ingredient in the overall solution.   
---
There's no silver bullet for this one.
---
Even more reason you may as well just roll them in together
---
This joke has already been made.  
---
For it to make more sense though, there should be lots of Keanu Reeveses all over the screen, complaining the peon is actually already awake.
---
And it's temporary so we can actually play the game on launch.  So get over it.
---
Guildies should supply mats
---
WoD had some of the best raids and class design the game has seen.
---
WoD sub rogue was basically a masterwork of class design.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Jajajajajajaja.
---
Fuck me.
---
You have more leeway with 40 than 25.  For 40 you can really have like 50 people show up and some sit out.  25 it is much harder to have people sitting on the sidelines to justify waiting to raid.  Most guilds thought that because they usually have 50 raiders on that two 25 man groups would be a cinch.  It wasn't.  Many guilds broke up because of the new 25 numbered raiding.
---
An ideal casual guild will have people that don't mind sitting out some raids.  I expect a lot of guild hosted PUGs to be present in the beginning.
---
My point is that layering is not about cost. It's unlikely that it's a major gain or loss cost-wise. It's primarily about building something they don't have to interfere with over the long term. Where everyone can play with who they want to play with at launch without sitting in queues, and they don't have to do disruptive free server transfers and server mergers later on.
---
That's the irony here. Blizzard chose this path because they saw it as least disruptive, long term and short term, to server communities. Not due to costs.
---
How can you be sure tho, blizzard have sucked for the last 10 years.
---
Yep. Still think Blizzard has any strong hopes of success for Classic? It’s a pet project for them to convert people over to Retail. That’s it.
---
Tell that to the typical ruski and stop faking being offended, people keep to themselves and russian always stood out because no one can remotely understand wtf they are saying.
---
That makes sense that we would have different experiences; they were toying around with different layering levels, shutting down some layers (and servers) and adding others. I guess the takeaway is that the stress test may be nothing like release.
---
US Illidan is near impossible to play on without the BlockChinese addon
---
Mage rogue priest
---
It's what's annoyed me about this whole thread, and discussion. Why won't the parties involved just speak English? Have language-specific guilds, and learn the fucking language?
---
I'm Danish, and I speak English, I don't want my game in Danish, or a Danish server - but I have been a part of a Danish guild, all of whom spoke English in public chats and groups. Why can't France, Italy, Spain, whatever, do the same? I see that it's a problem, but is it because of a *refusal* to speak the language, or because they refuse to learn it?
---
Thats one of the two reason I did quit, horde getting a paly? are you kidding me.
---
The other one was the BG... the only real BG that ever existed was tauren mill vs southsore in the original vanilla
---
Oh really? Like the quests don’t matter?
---
Layering is proof blizzard doesn’t care about classic; and layering will kill the game.
---
On the bright side, this is a whole bunch of new info for pservers.
---
Signed. Happy for this to run for a few week, it'll be long forgotten by autumn.
---
~~in games~~
---
in life
---
Did you file a bug report? Things don’t get fixed if you don’t.
---
Not their services... their gameplay decisions have sucked.
---
Yeah if they don't fix obvious stuff like this and the layering exploits, then my excitement for classic goes WAY down to the point where I might even wait until phase 2.
---
Getting stuck in BGs with Pastaridge players was the bane of my battlegroup.
---
Getting to endgame first is fun for me.  Slowly leveling a second Warrior to tank and raid lead casual drunken weekend MC runs will be the different kind of fun one.
---
Nah there was political shit there too.
---
There just wasn't as volatile a political landscape back then, I think. I dunno I tune out politics heavily and just do not care at all.
---
Depends on how full the server is, and when you're in Org.  According to Blizz, layers are created and destroyed based on population... supposed to be around 2-3k players.  All layering is supposed to be gone before the start of Phase 2(release of the world bosses).
---
If it's like that in vanilla I hope not.
---
Yes you will. They explained this in the summit the content creators went to a while back. The goal is to have a layer be "your" layer so that you'll encounter the same people all your way to 60.
---
If it stays then no one will continue playing it and they won't have a customer base. Doesn't seem in their best interest to do that.
---
He moved on to more lucrative games, opened a gaming house in an old mental asylum in East Germany, allegedly started a cult.
---
I don't understand people who make this argument. 
---
If layering is being removed in phase 1 then the "community" is barely even there yet. 1 month into a brand new game the community is barely going to exist, a lot of the casuals will barely be dinging max level at that point.
---
Aside from that how do people fail to see that a server with 3 layers is akin to that of a 12k population battlegroup (or whatever you want to call it) with 3, 4k population sub-realms that you can hop between (cross-realm). It is literally the same thing.
---
No layering past lvl 10 and the only other concessions i will make is force respawns of mobs for 1 hr after launch
---
No one should have to deal with French people online except other French.
---
Watch the video, Perplexity talks about the Tauren's hit now being around 10 yds because of leeway just by strafing side to side.  You can tell this because War Stomp I believe he said was 8yds and it didn't hit the target but he could melee it by strafing.
---
Only for a few weeks... remember layering is NOT cross realm.
---
&gt;What kind of weather effects will there be in the game?
---
Players will experience numerous changes in weather throughout the world. The game features dynamic skies and clouds giving players the ability to actually see clouds begin to form and coalesce into stormy weather. Snow, rain, and fog are just some of many additional weather effects players can expect to find in the game.
---
Mhmm...
---
Does it make cross-realm battlegrounds between russian and european regions available?
---
I’d be interested to see evidence of that. 
---
Regardless, it would be hardly worth subbing and buying expansions for that chance when they have publicly said “we’re done.”
---
I'm getting pissed. Seeing all the video evidence of how layering will be exploited just further divides the player base. Layering will kill Classic before it can even get its legs under it. Use sharding for low level zones early on. There will be some exploiting of the economy, chests, and rare spawns, but it won't kill the game.
---
Is it easy to set up an American account from the EU?
---
There will be so many PUGs for endgame dungeons and MC/Ony/ZG that you practically don't need to be in a guild, and if you play well in those PUGs you are guaranteed to get picked up.  Joining a guild before hand will always be a risk.
---
You’re welcome
---
Except I only know that because I'm on here talking to you people about it. there's no way to pick that up through context when all you see is 'pog.' you dont see the guy's face which explains the meaning. that's my whole fucking point. 
---
It's like if instead of putting "pog" they were putting 
---
兴奋. Like, okay, I have no possible way to understand that through context, just like I have no possible way to understand "pog," "kappa," etc through context.
---
Supply mats or large raiding guilds might have the expensive items on tab.
---
Ahh that’s right. Balance is the other one
---
yeah thats the line developers always use - until the deadline has passed and then it changes to 'you just didn't understand what I was telling you'.  
---
I've also worked on software. I know better than to believe what the dev SAYS a product will do
---
I was 12 minutes too late
---
Yup. Then we'll have people going "hey where's the albino raptor?" once the game launches and it'll be too late.
---
"Hey Ion, how come there is still layering in Phase 2?"
---
"Oh... that was unintended and we're working to fix it."
---
You mean like that?
---
So we still got phasing? ROFL
---
THIS ❤️
---
Found the shill
---
MC isn't where you're gonna see that issue cause MC is piss easy. If anything it will start in BWL
---
Eh, new layer who dis is clever enough. I upvoted OP and downvoted you.
---
WTF Blizzard!
---
I'm 30 and doing the same. It's slow I work and I essentially am being paid to F5 /new on this sub
---
It is crazy to me to see how heavily the level of appreciation for BRD has increased over time.
---
The hatred for that place back then was intense. I will never forget how skipping SO much of it was the norm. I think it was years before I ever actually saw the end of that place. And it may have only been once or twice cause I never remembered it till much later when it became a short LFG dungeon to see the ending.
---
I mean hell, only the absolute bravest would go into the torch room and even less ever made it past.
---
Or, you're just not interested in all that other stuff? It's not a competition.
---
Where it seems sad to you it probably seems like a humblebrag to a lot of people. Most of us would love to not have responsibilities and commit tons of time to classic.
---
Which is exactly why all of mine will be neglected.
---
Can only speak for german servers but the english abreviations were always used. Way back in vanilla too. The only exception i can think of on top of my head was wailing caverns
---
So is this really you, or did you just take bits and pieces from various personalities and activities on Reddit to form and impersonate a persona?
---
Either way, as long as you're having fun, happy, and not being a jerk to anyone, it's all good.
---
Motherfucker talk like a chain email from your grandma.
---
Thanks for the update. I couldn’t care less.
---
Woah woah woah this is NOT acceptable!
---
It's pathetic that you think live is just about furthering lifestyles propped up by society, so I guess I agree.
---
Damn... seriously considering playing on an US server now. Not because I mind speaking english but rather because I'm afraid that a lot of others won't speak english. 
---
Not sure though because I'd mostly play when most of the US people are at work. And raid times is another problem. And high ping, though that would make it feel a bit more vanilla like I guess lol.
---
Na I want to play vanilla #nochanges
---
Never go FULL Sjw
---
So you say you are disappointed that Classic is not "what Vanilla was"
---
Then you elaborate by saying that you have lost interest in Classic because you have already explored the entire game 15 years ago.
---
It seems to me that the reason you lost interest is because Classic is exactly "what Vanilla was".
---
You’re welcome. 👍🏻
---
Yes. Just log out of Battle.Net, use the dropdown to select “Americas”, and then login again.
---
Layering sucks for both parties. Sometimes getting ganked is part of the experience. I would know, I've only ever been on the receiving side of ganking and I fully support it.
---
&gt; I still don't think layering is ultimately going to matter
---
I think the main side effects are going to be the mess of a community, and the messed up economy. The people who get to 60 fast and start layer-hop farming are going to be absolutely loaded. A year down the road, they will still be loaded.
---
Pardon my ignorance but what is HOTW?
---
You're gonna be using the cast bar baked into your unit frames, no one will use a separate one.
---
I mean, not really. If your goal is to do every quest, then by all means go for it. But the early ones don't chain into anything important later.
---
I'm on the PVE server so it hasn't impacted my game play so far, but it's a very blunt instrument that I hope they intend to disable as soon as possible. I'm afraid that they'll jam tens of thousands on each "logical" server, with the result that they will have no choice but to layer for the foreseeable future.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting "one month" from. The only thing we know for certain is that layering will be removed before Phase 2 goes live. This could easily be 3 or 4 months into release. That's more than enough time for the community to develop.
---
&gt; Queue times and hordes of players = literally unplayable game. That will turn off a hell of a lot more people
---
That's BS. Wanna know how I know? Because they had queue times in Vanilla and it was one of the most popular games ever created.
---
Death to layering beyond lvl 19. Best Solution.
---
Because he used the same formula that makes 7 + 8 + 8 = 6
---
It doesnt matter what client people use. If you post an item with the french client the name appears in french but if someone with an english client clicks on it it appears in english
---
&gt; **We’ve prepared several realms,** which will include Player vs Player, Player vs Environment, and Role-playing realms.
---
Several realms. You know, even if we avoid reading too much into that one word, everything Blizzard announces suggests that we won't have very many realms. If we're not getting regional ones (except Russian), and they use a word like 'several' to describe the number of EU realms, surely we can surmise that it's not going to be in the dozens.
---
I could see Classic launching with as little as ten realms each in EU and NA. Honestly, it has always felt to me like Blizzard wants to run a compact selection of megaservers instead of the possibly hundreds of normal-sized realms that it would take to properly accomodate a large playerbase.
---
That's probably why they chose layering as their crowd control mechanic. I bet they hoped to make it permanent so that one realm could sustain peaks of maybe 20+ in the long term. As awful as that sounds, for a company like Blizzard, that would be a way better solution than trying to accomodate millions of players spread out across servers of 3-5k each or whatever.
---
Whatever the case, I think the realm lists will be released pretty soon.
---
Unpopular opinion: People in beta are burning out.
---
o0 I got you. I didn't realize it was up to 10 yards. Also can't watch video at work. So thanks for the info.
---
Gotcha. This is pretty helpful actually, thanks!
---
"it is working in Classic beta."
---
I have been trying for a while and cannot seem to get it to work on the stress test going on right now. The window just stays empty no matter which guide I choose. 
---
Is there a different download link than the 8.1.5B for classic somewhere or am I just derping it up somehow in game?
---
You didn’t read OP. They’re saying there should be no layering after 30. So Starting zones, and potentially the zones that come after, and maybe after that, would be layered. But 30+ zones would not be.
---
People advocating for it either have not experienced launch days or they did so long ago all they see is pink.
---
You mean the places where people congregate that have many valuable NPCs and services...?
---
Most people will be in a guild with 50+ players. That alone will be enough to hop between any layer you wish.
---
Even if you somehow only have 1 friend in the entire world it is still exploitable.
---
If it exists the way it does now the most hardcore players will exploit it and get even further ahead than normal/casual players which will only result in the normal players complaining further down the line. If layering exists as it does now i'll be exploiting it heavily for the first week too. 
---
Just from being able to get 60 within the 5 days and exploit layering to farm far more devilsaur leather than normally possible will make me significantly richer (or ruin the economy).
---
Selective memory.
---
This is a deal breaker for me. I don't have any problem speaking english but the community and culture is way more different on french server and I also enjoy speaking 10 times more with fellow french than with english people.
---
I don't expect more than half the french people to even try speaking english and I can't blame them.
---
Get that stick out of your butt, mate. I will be a proud bear, and you cannot stop me.   
---
I remember bears being in Vanilla, and yes they tanked some content. 
---
I want the Vanilla I remember, not your upstuck version :-)
---
We d
---
The same way 7/10 + 9/10 + 8/10 = 7/10.
---
And 7/10 + 8/10 +8/10 = 6/10.
---
I just stopped reading after that as it was worthless.
---
He lost way more time hearthing and returning to that location then if he did a corpse run. Forcing a pally to bubble heart is an absolute win.
---
I don’t think you see the point my man, we all know how sharding works that’s not the problem, we don’t want it because it’ll ruin the game.
---
I’ll do some traceroutes when I get home, but I never trust gamepedia, even that page says it’s own information is way out-of-date.
---
Do those activities sound fun to you?
---
Layering just for the starting zones would be better
---
He also points out that if he stands still with his character, there will be no melee swing.  The second he starts to strafe back and forth, melee starts.
---
I played DURING vanilla and new a few rogues on my server with it. They were also absolute DPS beasts.
---
I am almost certain this is private server experience talking here.
---
don't forget competition, if 1:500 players want to get devilsaur leather, and have reached that gear to solo it, that means given a random distribution of players the number of people doing the layer hopping will stay consistent with the number of layers they can hop over to.
---
^ truth
---
A layer is just a copy of the game world. Layering is the technique of having multiple layers for a single server so the players are spread out to reduce congestion.
---
... /r/woosh
---
 He also points out that if he stands still with his character, there will be no melee swing. The second he starts to strafe back and forth, melee starts.
---
Europe's playerbase is equal to NA. NA is clearly getting 15 servers if this stress test was any indication.
---
yeah what is with the fear over server merges. I do no understand why so much of the aspects of the game which build COMMUNITY and being sacrificed. Does blizz just not wanna pony up enough servers for launch?
---
Still artificial segmenting and an artificial experience
---
Yes, the people coming from private servers.
---
The other 90% of the players, maybe not.
---
If I had a full day off, I'd try to hit 15 by just exploring
---
Go play Private Servers.
---
Mann to hell with social expectations. You're not hurting anyone, have fun
---
I didnt see a bug catcher or whatever it's called while I was playing the stress test. Wasn't sure if bug or just weird shit but I couldn't turn vsync on without crashing on stress test and didnt know where to report without going to the forums.
---
Yes it will, we lose a bit of damage but druids still have that retarded thing called max rank healing touch which is the most efficient leveling healing spell. You pop out of bear or cat and heal your whole health pool then go right back into form.
---
This will slow druids down a little but not really going to be terribly noticeable.
---
it's better they start with low numbers and increase, rather than have too many and have to shrink the servers. new servers can be spun up very quickly
---
Yea so many valuable npcs and services near the king. Not sure what achievements have to do with griefing but ok.
---
I'm not mad at layering, never in this conversation did I say that I was. OP complained that people were complaining I told him why. That is all
---
How's it work with side step, I never run straight away from any one I keep them in my front.
---
I was wondering the same: are they really have that low expectations? So little servers, no rp-pvp.
---
What if your friend gets layer 2 and your brother layer 6? What then?
---
Its not up for debate. Layering is a neccessary evil. Having an awful launch experience will make potential players give up and possibly never pick it up again. This would be the biggest disaster. Look at other games with awful launches. Layering will also reduce the amount of dead servers after initial tourism. You avoid two disasters with one stone. End of discussion.
---
Here's the problem with that, so you make tons of 1-12 layers...now what happens when those people move on to the next zone, they either are packed in like sardines, or you layer the heck out of the next zones. Rinse, repeat, see the problem.
---
Yes please, even from lvl 20+ 
---
Or the first two starter zones would be enough
---
Like: Durotar / Barrens.
---
And after the two zones, no layering.
---
&gt; have different specs to choose from etc... 
---
This is vanilla we're talking about.
---
Mage pros: great utility pve/pvp, lots to do in pvp. Teleports are god. AOE farming great for leveling/cash farming. Pro/con: raiding as frost means sitting in one spot and spamming frostbolt, which you will either find meditative or boring as hell.
---
Rogue: decent pve utility with sap, sneak lets you go places others can't. Lots to do in pvp, especially 1v1 ganks. More to do in raid pve thanks to movement/rotation. Leveling prepare to stunlock or bandage.
---
Warrior: able to tank/offtank, good damage. Not as capable solo in pve/pvp. Solo grinding through the 50s was one of my worst experiences in gaming. Warrior god mode is unlocked by making friends with healers (but also whirlwind axe).
---
OPs post is constructive. It’s offering *a compromise* between two potential outcomes. They may have their opinions about layering, but they themselves admit that it may be needed at launch, at least for the first few zones. 
---
What isn’t constructive is saying “deal with it, put on your big boy pants”.
---
&gt;I can’t for the life of me see why the French won’t just learn English
---
Why don’t you learn French ... I can speak english, it does not mean I want to speak in english in leisure activity, there’s a way more interesting language and culture that come with it, it’s not « just » a language
---
&gt;The EU population is 512 million...and the US population is 330 million
---
Im not disagreeing with the whole thread but this is just stupid. NA servers are not US exclusive. And EU servers are also not just for countries that are part of the european union. Yes europe has more people than NA still but if you're gonna make a thread with a bunch of numbers then at least do it with the right numbers.
---
It was sarcasm, the French and English don’t get along and aren’t included to learn each other’s languages. 
---
Hence the “historically speaking” comment.
---
May the r/woosh be with you.
---
They don't.
---
It's not meant to be a final score.  I'm rating them on 4 different scales.  The 3 main types of content, and the overall experience of the game.  Overall experience is not just based on content, but also how fun the game is in terms of mechanics, playing your character, and the community.  Obviously these are my subjective opinions, but they've been confirmed by very many others on other servers and factions that the same things were also true for them.
---
 Here's the biggest problem people don't realize. Ion said it will be gone by phase 2 or possibly earlier BUT Blizzard is EXPECTING a massive player dropoff after the first few weeks. We have ZERO idea about the max size a layer can be. If the servers are packed and STAY packed Blizzard will be UNABLE to remove layering.
---
Layering is worse than ANY cahnge suggested to the game. It's even worse than adding gear/specs for hybrid classes. It will ruin the true classic experience.
---
It will be new for vanilla/classic. The system is exploitable to gain economic and pvp advantages and is bad for community development. One of the many scourges that ruined retail.

Liking classic doesn't make you pathetic so I don't have enough information to tell you how pathetic you are.
---
As a french don't expect me to speak english, everyone will go to the unofficial server and speak french. Why the fuck would I be forced to not speak my own language???
---
A lot of the people who complain about overcrowding are the same kinda people who refuse to group up for quests or leveling. Layering is dumb, outside 1-5 it shouldn't exist.
---
Why wait for STV? My blade will welcome you as early as Stonetalon and Redridge! :)
---
Kay 10/10 post.
---
We need to stand up against those pesky warriors! &lt;3
---
&gt;I started playing when the server opened. How the hell am I to know which side will be overpopulated?
---
Easily, it was pretty fucking easy to notice which side had more people than the other. When you roll into STV and its 80% alliance its a pretty good indication of which way the server was leaning.
---
Not to mention the fact that the vast majority of players were all Alliance, people knew before the game even launched that it would be heavily Alliance leaning so stacking on that side was an obvious thing to notice.
---
&gt;How am I supposed to know in August on launch day??
---
As I said we have the tools now, addons are going to have a pretty good number of active players on a realm and what faction they are and it will be incredibly easy to see which servers are leaning which way.
---
If you want low queue times take some responsibility and dont stack on one side, simple as that.
---
Make 3 versions of every server. Illidan A, Illidan B and Illidan C. Restrict names across all 3, then merge to a single Illidan once the population stabilizes.
---
You can't make an authenticated vanilla WOW with the legion+ client.
---
The ability queue just doesn't work the same way. They shifted so many things from being client to server side from 2006 to 2019 it can't possibly be the same.
---
The whole thing was an exercise in futility from the second they decided to not use the original client.
---
Thanks for reposting the proof/admission that [layering is just sharding by a different name!](https://imgur.com/a/Xy2L3zZ)

---
It's not refusal, it's just that we are used to having everything dubbed or translated. French, as Spanish, is still a powerful language. In return we are bad in English, because we don't practice (or need) it in our daily life. 
---
I know that in Scandinavia it seems weird because you have integrated that your language is too weak to be enough, so you keep everything in English with subtitles and put more effort in learning it. 
---
Also, the fact that it's so much easier for, say, a Swede to have a good English accent might encourage you more to speak it, even if you don't master the language.
---
Okay name one mmo that had a layering system just for launch day/month
---
What does it mean to layer?
---
A clusterfuck sounds fun, but sadly it will just be a few weeks of running around an area hoping to be the first one to tag a mob as it respawns. It isn't nearly as fun as you would think based on my experience on private servers recently. It sounds like Blizzard made layering continent wide though so they really made this a tough call unless they can just deactivate it entirely once the initial rush dies down. My fear is many people just getting bored and quitting early on when they can't do anything due to every square inch of the map being a zoo and having quests take an hour to complete with 50 minutes of that just waiting.
---
Pathetic
---
Called sarcasm mon ami.
---
At 60 yeah, it's a joke. But in your 40s you'll top dps meters in dungeons just by looking in mobs' direction, so there's that. 
---
That said, ele burst is high enough to be fun in PvP. There's a reason Frost Shock was the original wow meme.
---
But layering is continent wide not zone wide
---
They already floated the idea of sharding for starting zones. Layering is pretty much sharding with people being tied moreso to one shard
---
They could easily make zone-wide sharding for the lower level ones.

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Now this might ruin whole damn game well atleast wpvp
---
I played for 2, and saw one drop 4 times and the other twice.
---
The one I saw twice one drop was me running as an alt with another guild. They had seen that one drop so many times they gave it to a hunter (forced it on him even) because he was a main. He didn't even know hunters could use it. Then back in my main guild the one they had too many of dropped and I could have easily had it if I had gotten that other one no one wanted.
---
Nah, you're not a sad individual. You are one of us now!  
---
I'm 40+ and been obsessing over the release of Classic since I first heard the news.   
---
Me and many others have prepared our life, family and vacations for the release.  
---
I wouldnt trade this pre-release addiction for anything ;)  
---
Enjoy it mate!
---
Thats interesting. I was planning on playing on a German Realm, I guess thats not happening now. At least the Russians are gone.
---
Melee leeway affects all races equally and has nothing to do with Tauren in particular. Taurens will keep their inscreased melee reach (6.95yd instead of 5yd) not matter if leeway goes or not.
---
The reward is satisfaction that you purged that maleficent banshee queen from Azeroth.
---
Also that you minorly inconvenienced some people turning in quests till respaen.
---
So that explains all the downvotes lol.  I didn't know about anything like that, I just stumbled on his YouTube videos trying to get more info about classic
---
I was just trolling to start with, but let’s compare yours and Asmongold account and see who has more accomplishments.
---
Just remember, the game has been out for 15 years and some people will expect every one to already know whats going on.  If you prefence your questions with "Im new to WoW.. " you should avoid most of the toxicity. ALso, AVOID the Barrens (its like westfall for the horde) people go to Barrens simply to make trolling comments in chat.
---
That is exactly what I wrote 🤔
---
I don't really have an opinion on layering in or out for classic, but can we not pretend that we need lag and dc's for classic? That's not what classic is intended to bring back. Also sharding is awful but much different from layering they're using. Also, layering is intended to smooth leveling, not prevent lag. The stress tests are making sure servers stress &amp; layering don't create unintended lag/dc.
---
I logged on at about 8:30 eastern time last night, about 3.5 hours after the realms went live I believe, and has no problem at all completing my quests as both a troll and a Tauren. There was more competition than what you would see normally in retail, but it wasn’t enough to dissuade me from playing the game. In fact I kind of enjoyed it.
---
How about we just dont care? Stop playing this boring 15 years old game ffs
---
I think they have a good reason for their player expectations.
---
1. Many of the people that no lifed vanilla have families and kids now and simply can’t devote that amount of time again, or they have moved on to other games.
---
2. A healthy percentage of players from retail will find classic too slow, too inconvenient, or both, and will likely bail.
---
3. Compared to many modern MMO’s, classic is not as streamlined or accessible, so the number of new players coming in will probably not be as substantial as some people may think.
---
All in all it’s better to prepare for decreasing populations than to overestimate the response.
---
Layering is continent wide not zone wide
---
I manage a classic wow raiding guild that is growing quite quickly! Come by our discord and see if you are a good fit! https://discord.gg/vqUTWqk
---
Damn, this whole post is based upon your speculation based on the language used , particularly the word "several".
---
With the information gained in beta/stress tests paired with their prior experience in releases, I'm sure the they are well prepared.
---
Fuuuuuuuck sake.  Someone needs to keep tabs on what communities are going where. 
---
Before you know it you've rolled on the "unofficial French server" and the "Unofficial German server" etc...
---
Like the dark ages.
---
Yup. Didn't need the pic or the sound. Just the word and I'm backpedaling.
---
Honestly, I think I'd rather have people occasionally tele to another layer than have to deal with every quest mob being spawn camped the whole time during leveling
---
Russians and Chinese should have their own servers and be unable to play on US servers.
---
Well, at this point it’s either option a: layer the entire world, and option b: layer the starting handful of zones, maybe up to 30. I’d rather go with option b.
---
This is fucked up. If I end up on a server where it's not english in the chat. I quit.
---
i really enjoy casually playing the market on a couple niche items. 
---
I cant wait to join a completely blank economy.
---
Influencers/streamers are the modern raid leaders.
---
They will have the largest audiences and coordinated groups.
---
Coinciding, any raid leader who streams will instantly be popular because who doesn't want to watch a person lead 40 people into the hardest content?
---
I think down the road I might make a priest tailoring and enchanting alt just to have for the near passive income and in case some guildies want to run some 5 mans and need a healer. Probably won't ever be geared really well but not really needed just for dungeons.
---
OMG STREAMERSSSSS
---
:O :O :O :O
---
"Are french easy to trigger"? Well, as soon as we go on internet, we read thoses kind of overused jokes. So...
---
Was stuck trying to tag boars in durotar. Got into a group. Me and this shaman leveled together until 5 until I got off. Made a friend day 1. Can't wait for launch
---
They have already said they want as few servers as possible since they "know " people are going to dropoff.
---
What about the auctioneer?
---
JE SUIS MONTE
---
I don't get what this is supposed to be.
---
Because english is the universal language and french is not.
---
You have to make sure it's properly calibrated
---
Okay, now look at the comments section and tell me how constructive it is to say I hate layering till level 60, lets do 30? It's nothing but either layering sux lets get rid of it or layering is fine be quiet. If this was the first time, sure, I would agree. But these threads happen DAILY and no one can ever agree anyways. 
---
When I say constructive, I mean helping to limit the exploits of the system, not completely change the system because you don't like it. This thread is the latter. It's not compromise, it's a hijacking of the concept to make it into something it is not. Layering is not just about limiting competition, although it definitely helps that too; it's about preserving the community of a server long term, and ultimately, about making people stay subbed because more subs equals more revenue. 
---
And telling people to grow up is not constructive, you're right about that. I was not saying it was, I'm simply saying if you can't enjoy this game with layering, get out of the way so those of us who can are able to enjoy it.
---
Was a video of a guy doing exactly that on YouTube. Sure you can find it. Didn't go well.
---
It was definitely tricky but once you start getting ahead and tagging mobs fast as possible before people rushed in, it was gtg. People spend a lot of time setting up macros, addons, ect and I just booked it for the hills
---
The issue that sticks out  to me is how this will affect the economies of servers. 
---
As we've already seen layering can also be exploited in other, more obvious ways such as rare farming and Gurubashi chest farming, but being able to jump layers to farm materials in a way that could greatly affect the economy is a valid concern. I think while this system is temporary, its effects will probably still be seen and felt past its removal unless they address some of the layering issues.
---
Underrated comment
---
Don’t find a US guild on a US realm with an off schedule.
---
Find a UK guild on a US realm with a normal schedule.
---
I’d be more worried about the Black Lotus mafias.
---
You're completely right. On Runetotem EU there was a huge Italian population (before they got their own realm); I had absolutely no issue with that at all, made some good Italian friends there over the years, but as soon as one person spoke Italian in trade/general it just became a toxic shitstorm.
---
A bunch of us have only been saying that p servers get nothing right outside of the look and feel of WoW. Turns out we were all correct.
---
How does the influx of more resources into the economy via layering result in a price increase?
---
Classic wow won't be as big as you think.  Most people will get bored very quickly.
---
Did you even read OP? This *is* a solution, a compromise. Nobody’s saying you should compete with 10k people In north shire Abbey without any form of sharding or layering.
---
Yeah you're right it's just frustrating having to even deal with it at all.
---
I think Portuguese realms too but not sure.
---
That does kind of make sense. Russians do....Russian things.
---
Why can't they just have Server Groups? A Group, being individual worlds that eventually merge into one. Blizzard must have some idea about how many people who join, will play long term.
---
Player names and guild names will be unique to each server group. Maybe each Group has a Section of five populations (or sub-servers) with... 3k people each? 
---
Or whatever the ideal server population is. That would be the target. And then figuring, roughly, the expected quitters, that would be the number to start with in the initial Server Group total.
---
You have my sword
---
Or literally what Op is saying themselves, *smh*
---
Nobody is objecting to layering in starting zones.
---
Most are objecting to layering in contested zones.
---
Thanks for pointing this out. It really needs to be in the discussion about layering way more than it is.   
---
Yes, there are problems with layering, I fully admit that, however, it is not something that will be around for ALL of Classic (Blizz plans on cutting it by end of P1 at the latest), but it is necessary for the health of the launch of Classic.
---
You cannot reason with these people.  They all seem to think that there is going to be 11+ million players like the height of WotLK.
---
Yeah I was going to say, this is only a few steps away from intentionally lagging the server to simulate average 2005 internet.
---
Playing on the most recent big private server, which happened to have a large chinese playerbase, I was unfortunate enough to group with some of them. Trying to tell them to use sheep or entangling roots or whatever of the sort is impossible. After a particularly bad SM: Armory run I swore off ever playing with a chinese player again, and made a point to gank every single chinese player I could, just out of spite. I was definititely not alone in this, either.
---
If Blizzard goes through with this and doesn't separate by language, particularly those who are demonstrably worse at english (italians), I can see a lot of unneccessary venemosity within the playerbase.
---
Neck yourself, please.
---
man.. think before u post something.
---
Meh. I'm of no actual opinion as long as it eventually does disappear at some point like they have claimed.
---
I actually think sharding would be better, at least then it would be by zone so the people in front of the leveling pack couldn't exploit the bottom heavy nature of layering and jump around layers to exploit nodes and mobs.
---
It's not continent based, it's realm wide. 
---
it's designed so that you're playing on a full server just like Vanilla. But instead doing free transfers and merging later, it's dynamic
---
You're talking about people owning the vast majority of supply like theres a limited amount of resources or that they control the respawning resources which obviously is not the case.
---
Secondly, the economy isn't ruined just because you're not making as much gold as you otherwise would on certain items.  In fact a lot of people would say that's a good economy because it helps the buyer save gold.
---
Finally, the economy is the economy man. The same item could cost 5g one week and 20g the next. It's the same thing on different servers. One server could have a stack of ore for 5g while another has it for 20g.  You wouldn't say one economy is better than the other. It just is what it is. If you're so concerned about your herbs being too cheap then hoard them until layering is over and you could see the prices go up
---
&gt; I think the main side effects are going to be the mess of a community, and the messed up economy. The people who get to 60 fast and start layer-hop farming are going to be absolutely loaded. A year down the road, they will still be loaded.
---
I can agree with your concerns regarding the potential economy abuse, although I do think that the extra resources will run out and scarcity will set back in sooner than people think.
---
The community aspect of things, though, I disagree there.  I don't think layering is going to have that much of an impact on community long-term because gamer culture and our access to resources is different now then it was then.
---
Ultimately I think layering is the better of the alternative solutions Blizzard could have come with.  Is it perfect?  No, not by a long shot, but it's the lesser of two evils.  I'm fine with it being part of P1 and only P1.  I do wish they would give us a more concrete time frame, however.
---
Can't all be winners. Most of us can enjoy ourselves though. After this hot Thursday shift I'll be having a beer, doing some work on my car then spending a few hours leveling a character bound to disappear in a few weeks.
---
Hate how true this is... I've been in France and for some weird reasons French people always answer you in French even if you asked them something in English. Like ... The fuck man.
---
Absolutely. Granted the stress test was specifically trying to cram people into zones (before they shit down a bunch of servers it wasn't too bad on Server 4) but yeah, depending on things it absolutely needs to be there for the starter areas. Otherwise it'll be a total shitshow
---
Do away with layering; and do away with Xserver bgs while you’re at it.
---
And why are you here then?
---
Yeah bro. You did right. Cheers.
---
Terrible news, worst decision they've made yet.
---
At least we won't have Russians, but still :(
---
Of course, all France refuse to speak english.
---
Come on dude, what the hell? Good for you if you don't mind speaking english for a lot of things.
---
I'm belgian and i speak french natively, nevertheless i'm pretty sure my english is good enough to speak it everywhere, but that doesn't mean i will automatically be enjoyed by that news.
---
Which is perfectly fine. It makes 5-8 kiting a lot harder but at least it's possible. With the current leeway, plus the 6.95yd range, it's literally impossible to sit in a Tauren warrior's deadzone.
---
I should really upload the video a guildie made once upon a time when we raided Ogrimmar...
---
No rewards to City raiding, but it was damn fun.
---
Same for me in those respects. I think I got power run through strath, maybe made it through a couple bosses in BRD. Looking forward to some 10 man UBRS. That one was the 10 man right?
---
I could see a million classic players
---
I like to MC people on boats and make them jump off right before you zone.
---
That’s because it will be for most of them....
---
&gt;It's fine that you think the way you think. It's fine that it ruined your overall enjoyment.
---
&gt;But reviews are supposed to be objective and an overall score cannot consist of the weakest link
---
If the weakest link is so bad it literally caused me to quit the game and never return? Then yeah I can definitely rate it based on that.
---
Reviews are personal opinions, there is no such thing as objectivity even from professional paid reviewers.
---
Literally no review in the history of mankind has been 100% objective. There is always bias.
---
In this case, the main issue with the game was so bad it made me quit, other aspects very damned. And it made other people quit too.
---
It's great that you personally were able to overlook the glaring issues and enjoy it still. But you're not the norm. And it's disingenuous to suggest that people who quit because the theme dont have valid opinions.
---
For me: Story&gt;Art&gt;Gameplay&gt;Music.
---
Story and art were shit, so I didnt give the gameplay a chance. And I'm not the only one, meaning Pandas were bad enough to drive people away before getting into the gameplay, it was *just that bad.*
---
I can appreciate that you liked Kung-Fu Pandas, but youd be a fool to suggest it didnt seriously fracture the base and polarize people on the future or WOW.
---
Problem then is what happens when your level 31 wants to party with your friend at level 16 and help him through some quest?
---
It was an example dude relax
---
$$$$$$$
---
I’m honestly hoping they don’t either , I’m just curious I know that shit is game ruining
---
No ChAnGeS muh vanilla experience. If nothing changes it will definitely be exactly like the original vanilla launch experience! /s
---
No I don't think it is. His is using numbers from a previous release and backed up by the large amount of interest. Is it 100% accurate? No, but it's definitely not as silly as what you are claiming.
---
Yours is by far the sillier assumption. I'm a diehard WoW fan and even I didn't resub just for the 48 hour stress test. Same goes for a lot of my other diehard friends.
---
The fact you’ve already decided any possible solution I can provide is going to harm the game is reason enough for me to not bother. No point discussing it with someone who’s that closed minded.
---
Bobby B is here!
---
TAKE ME TO YOUR CRYPT, I WANT TO PAY MY RESPECTS!
---
&gt; It's almost like whoever makes these decisions wants this project to fail.
---
this..
---
On one hand. I hate you and, am going to kill you repeatedly. On the other hand. I love you because you complete me. "The hunter is nothing without the hunt."
---
It is good that they split off the russians. Some were a bit "special" on pservers
---
As good as us druids had it in TBC, I genuinely hated that expansion. It set the table for so many bad things.
---
I would drop the game the instant Blizzard accounces TBC Classic.  For those who only cared about PvE raids, I'll admit it was good. Everything else about the "expansion" was total garbage.
---
Classic + on the other hand assuming they don't add powercreep or raise the level cap I'd be all for.
---
Brilliant response, a great indicator of the intelligence and maturity level we can expect from the classic community.
---
At this point there is an extremely limited chance, if any chance at all, that the game releases in the summer. My guess is after Blizzcon
---
I was already considering playing on a US server, this now just made the choice easier.
---
I agree, speaking about what they should do then what they will do. The sad fact is they would make more money releasing it before then after, because once classic is out less people will switch up games. It's not like they have a lot to do for the game, just update graphics and release it.
---
Yeah probably requires more thought
---
Competition in an mmorpg is healthy I agree but having 100 players per quest mob is broken design.
---
Love this
---
In my experience on the stress test yesterday, people in /1 were generally super willing to help people out. 1-2 trolls for sure, but most people were helping with people finding stuff and with questions.
---
That's literally what Layering is doing, just with software-side "servers", AKA layers.
---
\&gt; You're talking about people owning the vast majority of supply like  theres a limited amount of resources or that they control the respawning  resources which obviously is not the case.   
---
???? My friend, did you play vanilla? This is 100% the case. People will 100% control the supply of thorium and black lotus, with or without layering. Layering only makes it worse. There is a limited amount of resources, thats like the whole point of MMOs and Vanilla WoW.  
---
Tell me, how do I farm ore when every single node gets insta mined 24/7? That will happen.  
---
\&gt;  In fact a lot of people would say that's a good economy because it helps the buyer save gold.   
---
Its all fun and games until they manipulate the prices the other way.. have fun buying crafted gear for 10x the price when theres no way to make it yourself. Its not fun.
---
/who shows everyone in every layer.
---
I love this. International community without Russians!
---
The stress test is intended to stress servers to the max, to simulate the tourist state. It is why layering is only temporary. Classic servers aren't supposed to a few months after launch to be anywhere near in population their launch size. Which is why 15 servers to distribute everyone equally, and then have healthy populations that don't need layering seems like a good idea.
---
You do know that there are only English and Russian servers for EU?
---
http://onslaught-wow.com/
---
But don't be discouraged if they're too hardcore for you. I had absolutely no problems finding a UK guild on a US server when I started working nights.
---
M stands for massive. Not overcrowded.
---
Yes it’s lame and hopefully fixed, at least layering goes away after a month or sooner. You know full well you’ll be too excited to not play that first
---
Month though!
---
I think you MISSED the point. If Blizzard doesn't see the point of a German speaking realm, when those players represent 18% ... this means that Blizzard believes that 1/5th of the EU Classic players ARE NOT ENOUGH TO POPULATE A SINGLE REALM !
---
And if 1/5th cannot do that...obviously the expectations for EU are 5, maybe 6 realms.
---
Which is totally in line with "SEVERAL".
---
Blizzard will not be able to remove layering if the servers stay packed and we enter phase 2. Their network infrastructure was redesgned around sharding and cannot be altered easily.
---
Any contested zone.
---
I think someone who would say something as stupid as "You think you do, but you do not" would make such a stupid decision. Some of us already said they won't play if there are no german server. :(
---
First of all still ghosting RP-PvP Servers.
---
Then while promoting the idea of 2.5k - 3k servers which would be blizz-like wanting mixed language servers. Are they mad ?
---
What a massive PR blunder than only further pisses of the EU after the WoW anniversary statue edition being US only etc.
---
I disagree for a simple reason. A LOT of people playing on german realms use the english client, this was the case even back in vanilla, no one ever complained.
---
It's not all that weird, Jar Jar was an annoying character that is unnecessary. Pandas are annoying characters that are unnecessary. This is an opinion, not a fact which you are free to disagree with. It doesn't have to be more complicated than that. I stopped playing before MoP so it didn't really make any difference to me. 
---
It seems like you really take players disliking pandas really personal or something. I'm not sure why. Either way, just because someone doesn't like an art style or direction that you do doesn't make them "retarded", it just makes you an asshole for saying that.
---
did you read the interview? Ion literally says this is a way to deal with declining server pops.
---
The mods pulled some strings and got Bobby B to check us out.
---
I don't get it. This thread should be upvoted to oblivon and there should be more violent comments about how outrageous this is. Like it's 100% a bad move from Blizzard. Having at least 1 server per language at launch seems like a mandatory thing to me. And those won't be dead servers.
---
I guess very few EU players follow this sub.
---
So he doesnt path back? Just stands there like "welp this is my life now I guess."
---
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
---
???? I'm acting as someone who is intending to exploit layering upon release which is the problem. My entire point is that whatever your "solution" is, I'll be able to easily circumvent it.
---
&gt; The only thing we know for certain is that layering will be removed before Phase 2 goes live.
---
It was said that Layering would be removed after a few weeks in the best case scenario.
---
Id love it too but im making due with the OG version
---
Sub daggers feels a lot different than wotlk mostly because energy costs. Backstab costs 60 energy in vanilla (compared to 40 talentedin wotlk) and your energy regen is clunky in vanilla and isn't a smooth generation, it comes in chunks/ticks. So you won't be spamming multiple backstage into people willynilly like on wrath, unless you use thistle tea, which has a cooldown, and even then you get like 2 extra backstabs at most. Its slower. 
---
Hemo plays more similar to tbc hemo swords, except you don't have ShS or shiv, so less mobility.
---
Blizzard doesn't. They "know" better.
---
And how precisely will it ruin the game in a way that would be worse than server merges or massive overpopulation?
---
I never said I would mind if they made broken classes more viable. I would fix prot palas, boomkins and arcane mages. Now cry me a river.
---
Agreed. I want to get in and get out ASAP. I understand some folks wanting their "genuine" experience, but I've done this 4 times already.
---
Not a new ip though, those that are going to play it on day one have already given blizzard their money.
---
It is so wild to think that they believe we won't even be able to fill one server... like what the fuck? Looking back at the cap of 3k people in vanilla, we will easily fill a couple of those!
---
What is layering
---
Im surprised no changes babies arnt asking for this honestly. Muh rough edges.
---
Bobby B memes will always have a place in r/classicwow
---
&gt; And aggro isn't a problem for hunters anyway
---
I played in the 2nd best guild on our server, behind Vicious Cycle during BWL. I don't know where you are getting your information. I was highest DPS hunter in most raids, 2nd only to our Hunter leader, who was a legendary PVP player that made that famous post about him quitting due to WotLK changes.
---
EASY, BOY! YOU MIGHT BE MY BROTHER BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE KING!
---
I ran the Solid Stone market on Nostalrius for a long time. I would buy out the stones, mark them up at insane prices and sold portals/level 55 food &amp; water. I was one of the few that when the server was hitting 60 that had the level 55 water spell drop for me in Stratholme.

Tell Ion I'm still waiting for my Dance Studio

LMFAO. You think there will be 3-4 servers for the US.... LMFAO LMFAO LMFAO. There are currently 4 for the stress test which is easily less than 50% of the actual player base on launch. I suspect to see somewhere in the region of 20 servers on launch for the US. Still low but your guess of 3-4 is laughable
---
No. There are only European and Russian servers. The EU servers aren't English only, they'll have all 24 languages represented.
---
Min/max goes to pallies, but it comes down to alliance/horde preference and what you want to do in a raid/group. Totems offer flexibility, which can be fun, but also take up a certain amount of your time/awareness. Pally's the god of single target healing and Oh Shit buttons, but coordinating raid buffs are a chore. Biggest consideration is whether you prefer horde/alliance, tbh.
---
Speaking as a masochist who mained druid through all of vanilla, I would not recommend druid for group/raid healing, as there's always someone else who does it better (priest &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; druid), but warrior/feral duo is probably one of the greatest duo combinations you can have.
---
Layering is not per-zone basis. It creates a separate layer of the WHOLE world.
---
Yep, fuck it, I'll jusy roll priest and do some weird healer shadow thing
---
Are you familiar with the term 'example'. Same can be said for any quest in game that requires item collection.
---
It's not a big deal. There's no Polish servers for retail yet every pole knows EU-Burning Legion is the Polish server. Same will happen for Classic. 
---
Only unfortunate for people that happen to roll on these randomly.
---
Awww thats disheartening. I like the theme behind shamans.
---
Seriously. Maybe years of runescape has made me jaded, but I don't really care about the economy. The only "community" I need, is my guild.
---
I mean, people talk about immersion being broken, but at the same time these raid bosses are touted as supreme beings yet 90% of the world's population has the capacity to kill them. Waiting to kill 10 wolves that have been a major problem for goldshire and theres 60 other people there next to the pile of 1000 dead wolves.
---
Share them spreadsheets?
---
I didn't vote for brexit to have to play with these plebs! British realms for British people!
---
/s I don't really mind but language gaps do suck if you are on the wrong side. Presumably it won't be against the rules to have x language only guilds, it is technically exclusionary which they've had tussles with before.
---
This comment should be at the top
---
So, there will be less than 200k Classic players, and most of them will be BfA players?
---
This is basically what you are saying.
---
Edited for clarity.  It's not a final score.
---
Yeah I can't wait to get kicked from groups because I don't speak French or German. Everything is always so nice on the normal English realms and it goes immediately to shit when I have played on betas or PTR where everyone is in the same realm. General is filled with people speaking French or German.
---
I mean, WC runs would still happen.
---
You have to buy the game, and you don't have to maintain a subscription to play. So they do generate revenue from Reforged.
---
Post removed in 3... 2...
---
You obviously don't know a representative portion of French people.
---
We, as a population, SUCKS at English.
---
Troll is better than Undead/Gnome/Nightelf/Dwarf for tanking and all those plus Tauren for Fury.  Orc is better than Troll but troll is comparable in a few situations for Fury.  Dagger warriors and 2h fury without an axe Troll is about the same as Orcs.  Everything else Orcs are better.
---
I haven't suggested any cooldown on swapping layers - besides some amount of time after being engaged in PvP - only restictions that happen afterwards you hop.
---
As a German I like the idea of all European players under one roof.
---
And fuck all those one nationality only guilds aswell, the Scandinavian ones in particular.
---
I thought forced interaction with Germans was more of a last century thing. Hopefully Blizzard reconsiders this.
---
You're actually the first person to not be a dick about the reply. Congrats! Let's agree to disagree
---
I want to see that screenshot gallery.
---
not even good for pvp , you can do some random crazy damage on cloth...you get oom and have to auto attack and you will die fast in bgs or vs melee .
---
November earliest is my bet.
---
Yeah don't have tolerance for idiocy anymore. Release is soon. Use your brain before spewing rubbish pls.
---
It's about time EU starts to see itself as one nation. I welcome this decision, though i would prefer some other language in the long distant future, Esperanto or other.
---
A better question here is what does several means to you? Because AFAIK several what I just said prior.
---
Also hilarious that you find the need to insult me cause I’m pointing out a ridiculous post based on an assumption, suck my dick lmao.
---
Don't watch streaming much, do people really give them free items and stuff?
---
Finally a post adressing layering that is not downvoted.
---
I mean, they aren't exactly wrong.
---
But it is a known fact that the French are up their own arses regarding a lot of things, and people accustom themselves to it.
---
Grow up and stop telling people what to enjoy. Do what you like to do and let other people do the same. No one cares about your opinion.
---
Right, so if you take the concept behind layering, and make it zone specific, you have arrived back at sharding. Sharding could be as small as a region, but that is in rare cases related to say the launch of Legion, where we all flew over to Dalaran floating above Karazhan. Yet the typical application of sharding is to shard an entire zone.
---
Also the original idea behind sharding was not move us dynamically either, but that hasn't exactly been the case, and it has not 100% been the case for layering in the closed beta so far either.  
---
TL;DR: Layering is just sharding scaled up. If you scale it down it is sharding again. The only real reason to name it differently is because Blizzard wants to emphasize the differences between the two applications' intents. Layering they hope to be a temporary measure that will be less visible to players. Sharding is the cross-server over-active tech that players who want Classic (looking for a cohesive and stable server-based community) dread. It's pretty much just rebranding of a tech that has been altered and will (hopefully) be applied differently and temporarily.
---
Had a 60 NE Rogue and 60 Tauren Druid.  Played far more PvP on the Druid tho, and it’s really not even close.
---
&gt;Server with no layering = 3k people on the server.  
---
&gt;Server WITH layering = 12k people
---
That is not how this works. With layering the server is still the same. The capacity doesn't suddenly rise. Layering was introduced to reduce the amount of people you have to compete with shortly after release, not to avoid queue times as those will not change.
---
Gonna be a rude awakening for you when you realize Classic WoW is the new WoW and will always be more popular than modern WoW.
---
Yea keep posting about streamers. That will really help. 
---
You guys advertise streamers here so much it almost looks like the twitch reddit.
---
Hahahahhahahahahahahhaha all those posts bragging about how their servers aren’t gonna be shitholes because of streamers now they’ll be shitholes because they won’t even speak the same language
---
An additional caveat - the current leeway doesn't work if you backpedal or use the walk key. It's movement speed based. 
---
So, right now to kite mobs you actually *need* to backpedal or you get smacked. Think of a mage aoeing getting thrashed by 10 mobs from 8 yards away at the same time *because* they're strafing away from them instead of backpedaling. 
---
It's actually broken.
---
Who said it was acceptable?
---
How does it work on retail? Are there suggested servers by language? They should just add little flag icons to the server selection window to suggest which ones people should use, but let them choose freely
---
I mean I'm Russian, but I'm playing in English with people who speak English. And I don't want to be gated from them simply because I'm from Russia. I genuinely don't care about RU server, it's normal that they get their own server, RU player base is biggest in EU and no one understands wtf they saying so yeah.
---
Fair enough. Hey they are providing entertainment, if thats your bag o chips... you do you.
---
Buy those players could still join English servers if they wanted to.
---
Yeah, so what you do is turn off the load balancer so it doesn't spool up more clusters.
---
Interesting. Do you know at what AS is the threshold for the troll vs orc pve argument?
---
I would prefer layering without the continent wide restriction. You are confined to your one shard and when you move to the next zone you see the same people and then shards merge as the zones get higher level.
---
Leave your house, everyone speaks German. I for one enjoy playing games with an international community.
---
He's Multiboxing like a pro though!
---
Please: create support tickets every day. We need to be as loud as we can.
---
Imagine TALKING like THIS, its really HILARIOUS. Now discussion the point at hand; 
---
I think you are completely off with your estimations, millions is so far off I can't even think where did you get his numbers from (im guessing you made them up because you are hyped). Classic is not a new game, its not a revolutionary game (as it was back in the day) and certainly the gaming industry is different. 
---
200-500k concurrent players for classic after the tourist wave? Where do I sign? Hope this doesn't come as an offensive answer or an attack, its is not. I just think you are not being realistic. Cheers!
---
WhY dO wE eVeN nEeD a BeTa AnYwAy
---
cant speak for the French personally, but how much english do you need to speak to play 5 man dungeons and stuff like that? and for everything else there will be guilds that speak your language. English is the default language in retail wow, pretty sure even for French people and i don't think people are complaining about that. What do you speak in dungeons while leveling? english, mythic and mythic+ dungeons? english. BGs? English. Lfr/normal/heroic pugs? english.
---
Nonsense!!! Everyone has different hobbies.
---
I take my kids to gymnastics, got cycling with them, take them swimming and for days out at the weekends.....but come 8pm when they are in bed....it’s wow time, and i can’t wait.
---
I’m getting a gaming laptop this time, so I can play on the sofa....and still be sociable with the wife! But I can’t wait for wow to be released.
---
Aside from the hundreds of times blizzard have promised something and gone back on it. World bosses aren't the only problem. Being able to layer to avoid any PVP combat (killing world pvp), using layering to abuse resource farming (devilsaur leather, black lotus, etc...) it's awful
---
Cool. Report the bugs.
---
Ooh, the green skin of the glad 2h axe ye? Don't think I ever picked that on a character :o
---
That isn't how layering works  - Layering is a Region as in the whole of Kalimdor or EK - if they set it by zone then if someone runs into a lvl 30 zone to avoid pvp you might get zoned away from them and also you can't see what is waiting on the zone border because the game can't load it because your not on that server.
---
Layering is not phasing.
---
So if you're departing with someone on the same boat, you'll arrive on different layers? Weird...
---
Arms warrior, holy paladin, frost mage. Mage slows and CC so paladin can pillar and warrior crushes face with freedom and cleanses from paladin. BoP for mage if he gets stuck. Warrior and mage can peel for paladin. Warrior has freedom of movement while mage keeps everything slowed so warrior can easily gain ground and murderlize folks.
---
If Blizzard wanted to do a real stress test they would open the stress test to anyone with a bnet account, active or not. This is all just one big free advertising campaign, nothing more.
---
Yes you will still be able to have a French client, but then there might be  incomprehensions when you will want to link a quest or an item since it will be in French... 
---
I'm afraid there won't be a whole lot of servers anyway if they expect French or German community to not be enough to fill a server, so it might be impossible to "colonize" a server.
---
Layering was developed from phasing/sharding technology. I'm assuming they could make a hybrid version of the two.
---
If not though, then I'd say layering should be removed within maybe 5 days. I'm all for smoothening out the first two zones, I'm not all for layer-abusing zones like STV or (worse) powerlevelers being able to abuse it by getting to black lotus spawns and ruining the early market.
---
Classic horde propaganda.
---
Playing FFXIV and it's hella frustrating in the LFG-tool equivalent (Duty Finder.)
---
In FFXIV, you can see what language setting people have (or prefer speaking) in their tooltip, basically.
---
I'm going to throw baseless % around, but I swear 90% of everyone who fails mechanics, never answers to anything you write, and keeps on letting the group down, *always* has French as their language setting.
---
You try to be nice, you try to teach them mechanics.
---
No answer, dead silence, and they repeat the same mistake over and over and over again without improvement.
---
kek
---
He said french, not french speaking person.
---
Lmao. I’m relaxed. Your example is a terrible strawman. Only an idiot would spend hours on collection quests when 10-15 mobs yield the same exp. Layering is god awful outside of the starter zones
---
I'm looking to go UD warrior and my brother wants to play healer. We can't decide weather or not he should roll a priest for the dispels or shaman for the windfury. Help!
---
" back in classic i play healer, one day raid leader/tank needs healing but he pulls too many and dies and i get kicked from group but do you want to know secret? I let raid leader die on purpose. I excellent healer. The best."
---
I will say - we are currently in the process of creating something to this extent utilizing Google Forms and Sheets.
---
&gt; It was the main complainment that people had on big private servers that there were so many different languages in general chat.
---
Hmmm, I agree with your post save for this. I don’t think the main problem was that some people spoke different languages on pservers; the problem was when those different languages were using the Russian or Asian alphabets, so you would just get a blank text box when someone replied to you. At least of a Spanish speaker replies in the same alphabet that I can see is Spanish, we have a chance to at least *attempt* rudimentary communication. The differen alphabets are the problem, *not necessarily* the language itself.
---
Imagine wanting to start a discussion and then insulting those who disagree with you. 
---
That’s not how you talk to people dude.
---
Now that you say that, I actually remember reading some stuff about AoE grinding from mages being broken and extremely hard to do now.  I can't see them not fixing this somehow.
---
It really is, can't believe this news honestly. 
---
Anyone having experienced non split language servers know how bad this can be.
---
Also, fuck the classic feel, this is more intrusive than some QOL changes, much much more.
---
Is there any way to convince them otherwise? There'll still be one server where most of one language gathers, with the difference that you won't know which one...
---
Haha thank you
---
Well TBH, you said MILLIONS, following you logic here, how much is millions? 2 millions? 5? 100?
---
Please don't involve your political stance in wow classic it's really cancer
---
The fact that you think sharding and layering will have the same problems shows you dont know how it works. 
---
Layering is like sharding, but for the entire continent. Just lock people into a layer, and suddenly you wont have 99% of all the problems people are having with layering.
---
Just coordinate and take over some server. I don't really see any problems. Sucks for the rest of players on your server, but it's their fault for not doing a research before rolling.
---
Wtf are you even talking about? I’m quite literally suggesting they make changes to it before launch (because they still have two months to do it), and providing some ideas that I’ve brainstormed in my own head as far as what might be effective.
---
Why are they so against Dynamic Respawns? It's a much much better option than layering and has been implemented on so many private servers. Why Blizz?
---
But people arent locked into a layer so..? xD
---
The pet bugs were discovered on the first day of beta. 1 month has passed and there has been no improvement. There is still time but 1/3 of the beta is over already with no improvement.
---
he is talking about names having a foreign name in trade chat. Im saying that always happend. I don't see how your comment is in any way relevant to what we are discussing.
---
Oh damn, this raise a few question to me.
---
Is Apes an EU guild? Now I'm scared to be on their server, fuck.
---
And is there big EU streamer to avoid ?
---
It depends entirely on what your personal goals are. In terms of raiding the very concept of a "hybrid" simply doesn't exist. They are always a subpar pick for dps and so they are healers, nothing else. 
---
Even for 5 man instances, you're lucky if you get a dps spot as feral, shadow, enhancement or retribution. 
---
So I don't know if "all roles being available to you" really applies unless you're a very casual player.
---
If you're resto-spec, farming will suck. If you're feral, you won't be able to heal, if you're balance you're oom. 
---
I don't really understand the last part of your post tbh, what's the difference?
---
The beta testers (not stress testes) are a very small community. On the actual launch the population will be MASSIVELY bigger with multiple populated layers. It’s not as easy as “just switching layers” to exploit because those layers will be populated as well. People are blowing everything out of proportion.
---
How about just stop layering altogether?
---
That‘s great that you enjoy it. Nothing is stopping you from joining an english server. Shouldn‘t there also be the option for people who would rather play on a server of their native language if there is a large enough community for it?
---
Underrated.
---
I had a blast playing my mage with a warlock buddy, it worked really well because of the chain cc we could dish out.
---
**This is why blizzard is doing several layers per server** and each layer holds what 3k players or something like that (cant remember). Im not saying I agree with their layers, just pointing out what they are doing.
---
Shit , that means when a german links an item is gonna be like "Detchemindergenstormingoseuch" ? BLIZZ PLEASE
---
The whole point of layering is that you make a new realm when you reach X player, so it's really like the old servers. Then when the initial launch and the tourists from retail (aka people that never reach level 60) you just collapse it to one server.
---
Allowing for "layering in only the low level zones" is a step towards sharding. I don't think you want to open that can of worms as it could potentially make sub level 30 permanently layered...
---
Why do you caps random words that don’t mean anything? 
---
You ARE really taking THIS too seriously.
---
Well my weekend would be shot lol
---
&gt; hat's a damn shot in the fucking knee from blizzard imo
---
It's "arrow in the knee".     
---
I know you don't speak English, so I forgive you for the mistake.
---
This is so wholesome. I'd be happy to babysit you in-game to be honest. You seem willing to learn about new things and that's the most important aspect!!
---
Unfortunately being an asshole is against the rules. Same in real life
---
I never said 2 weeks. I said a few weeks and definitely before phase 2, which is what is the official statement so far.
---
Am i the only one who doesnt know what layering is?
---
The biggest problem I saw is that most players refused to group and instead fought over every single tag.
---
I'm fine with layering at launch but it needs to be turned off ASAP.
---
Praise the Seven, king Bobby B!
---
Hi, /u/ClassicAzeroth
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2zliu/i_made_a_pet_guide_for_anyone_considering_a_hunter/). 
---
Thinking of the server cap back then, which was around 3k ... like how in the world could they think that we wont even fill one server each (let alone a few more)? It boggles my mind how out of touch they are.
---
That flossing zoomer gets me every time.
---
YOU GOT FAT!
---
I think it has to do with who initiates combat. If you are the one who initiates combat, the pet seems to work fine albeit still a bit wonky (ie the pet seems to move positions in odd manners). If I do not initiate combat (like face pulling), the pet seems to completely bug out and wont do anything but auto attack and even then only sometimes does that properly
---
Exactly. Why are they against doing this is?
---
My friend is going ud holy priest and I will go ud warrior. Best combo for anything.
---
classic wow was where grey items actually were used!
---
I'd say yeah but lots of people ignore this or just tell you to google it and stop being lazy. :( So it might not be the best advice to a new player. If you get in a party you could ask them if they know; that might be a lot better of an experience than in general chat.
---
So accurate.
---
I must have misunderstood, sorry.
---
Can someone explain layering
---
Vanilla was 15 years ago with different server technology, and no other MMO has continuously millions of players online.
---
My stress test realm general chat wouldn't shut up and they were trolling 99% of the time.
---
Hmm well for some who are using Joanna's guides to level I think it will be a problem... 
---
And I know there will be some ppl who will get stuck bcs they skipped some quests in the guide.... It will be like what do now :D 
---
And for sure a lot of guys will use some leveling guide...
---
I´ll just do the starting zone till I´m lvl 5, get fishing &amp; herbalism or mining and fish close to some herb/copper spawnpoints and start leveling once the whole zerg passed by.
---
I have no intention of racing through everything like I did many years ago, and probably not go into raiding till more casual guilds have mc/bwl on farm.
---
So take my opinion with a grain of salt, since it doesnt apply to me.
---
Layering should be used to the minimum, just the starting zones 1-10/15.
---
After that the zerg should be spread out enough to quest relatively normally.
---
I would advice everyone to group up for killing quests and boss quests, I can already see 50 people trying to collect the bandit lords head in the human starting area for example and everybody who doesnt have an instant attack to tag the boss being screwed. Or walking through an empty jangerlode mine filled with players. A lot of people will probably just grind mobs and skip quests (caster mainly), melee classes kinda need the gear from quests so will probably do more quests.
---
Layering is just too much of an abusive mechanic for gathering/rare spawns etc. and people will abuse it to be more efficient with the help of a guild with people in different layers. It should not be part of progression race. And I like the events people organize, raids to other factions towns, mass open world fights like we had in tarren mill/south shore, etc. layering would screw that all up.
---
Can´t wait for STV tho, hope they dont layer it, it will be a blood bath :-)
---
no problem :)
---
Mind controlling enemy fraction players off a ship right as it was leaving port was the absolute best!
---
No one will tip you for disenchant mats in pugs. The loot is rolled. Disenchants are rolled. Nobody did this in vanilla and I don’t see folks doing it now.
---
Why the hell would someone try to do a low-level quest for 12 hours anyway, at level 12 you're probably better off just grinding non-quest mobs anyway.
---
Lol, gotta love how classic is for the hardcore with its cookie cutter builds, brain dead dungeons and raids. 
---
Get off your high horse dude
---
Easy: Rogue, Rogue, Rogue
---
Stealth up to someone, murder them so hard their entire ancestry feels it, and then move on to the next guy.
---
I do agree with you on some points but I personally don't find vanilla that great. It's certainly an improvement over retail but I don't believe it's better overall than BC or early wotlk. I guess it all comes down to personal taste
---
I’ll pass. Retweeting a nobody’s tweet isn’t going to do anything and in no way gives them any kind of constructive feedback.
---
There's no horde racial that makes a huge difference to tanking. You'll get a small tps boost if you start fights with berserking, but nothing that really qualitatively changes fights -- it won't save you from early misses on pulls, and 3 sunders &gt; any racial. 25% stun resist on orc plus bloodfury (for pvp/dps only, do not mortal strike yourself while tanking) makes them the pvp gods. Warstomp is hella fun for dungeons/trash/pvp tbh, and +5% health -- while difficult to value accurately -- will at some point save your bacon...I mean brisket. Undead WotF is nice for Onyxia and pvp; eating corpses helps when leveling solo.
---
Ask the real question man: which race dances best?
---
just optimized questing! followed the route I have posted on my youtube channel
---
🦀 *Layering is powerless against nostalgia* 🦀
---
Or maybe the fanatics on this sub have an over-inflated opinion of how popular this will ultimately end up being once the initial rush is over.
---
And theres no limit on the amount of oil you can harvest, after all new fossil fuel is made every 100 million years.. just wait lol
---
That’s much less significant than people picking up the game and it being functionally unplayable for the first 2-3 days
---
I feel like Blizz was batting 1.000 on Classic until about a week ago, now they have a few strikeouts to their record.
---
Theres a difference between 100 people going after hogger compitition and 20 people going after hogger compitition. 
---
One is likely to make people want to just quit, the other is player interation that people say wont happen
---
Are you there, bobby b?
---
Useful, too.
---
Kinda wish I was doing that but I am not simply because I have not time for that.  
---
It isn't pathetic. People do what they like. If they have kids it seems logical that it's spending time in family.  
---
Everyone finds happiness where one can. And happiness can be as simple as nerding on a 15 year old game. Whatever your age. Have fun !
---
Sooo . . . no RP-PvP. Almost no dedicated language servers. Blithe insistence that layering is fine and they won't need it for long.
---
I wonder what data Blizz has to be so sure that there will be so few players . . . I mean they're assuming we won't have 3000 each of French/Germans/Spanish who stick around and want a dedicated server? I'd have thought there'd have been more than that of those nationalities among the 120k active on they-who-must-nost-be-named.
---
Do you wish you were doing those activities? I actually enjoy thinking about wow so fuck these societal expectations that don't cause you any enjoyment, do what you feel it's right for you!
---
I'll just buy the materials. Herbs become oversaturated and stabilize quickly on servers.
---
I MAY keep the herbs from when I level but I rather had a mount right at 40.
---
How soon we have memory holed BFA beta where everyone posted about the numerous bugs in well detailed reports and yet they still went live with them. But keep telling yourself, "ItS JuSt bETa dURr huRR". 
---
If I come off as sounding like an asshole, I am, because people were saying exactly what you are.
---
Oh no doubt, it was super chaotic, but when I asked a question about where exactly the rogue trainer was I got 3-4 PMs with the answer.
---
General chat was scrolling by pretty quick though.
---
My hype is turning up. 
---
My priorities and intentions with classic have evolved, but it’s making me more excited.
---
0 desire to raid every week, but instead just level up, work on my professions, gear up in 5 mans, some random BGs, and have a relaxing, leisurely time.  
---
This isn’t a grind for me, it’s going to be a journey.  A trip of nostalgia that I’m going to savor.
---
Ideally you'll see it at the next LFG Monday post
---
Sacrebleu!
---
I mean, those two aren’t mutually exclusive. Calling this not a beta doesn’t really make sense, there are numerous bugs that have been found and fixed prior to the games full release.
---
Of course they will continue to identify and fix bugs as the game is released, that is always an ongoing process after betas.
---
So you are saying a permanently damaged market is less significant than having to wait about a week? Something most non-dedicated people will do anyway?
---
I’ll wreck you with my alliance shaman
---
It's been tested, it doesn't work.
---
Hell even wetlands/duskwood could be abused for the grave moss.
---
You're welcome. I'm not in the beta, so I can't check how the GCD interacts with this. If stance switching is off the GCD, you should switch and charge in one press. Otherwise, you will need to have this macro in the same place on each stance's bar, because it will require multiple presses.
---
Of course you can fit more stuff in there with additional conditions or key modifiers. I love to cram as much functionality into my buttons as I can. 
---
I'm planning to play a druid, and I got every ability, plus downranked spells, specific sequences (totem stomping, warstop+heal, etc.), potions, buffs, gearswaps, and mounts into 10 total keys (1-6, q, e, f, r). I can access literally every thing I can think of, regardless of form, without moving my left hand. Plus it makes the ui really clean, with no extraneous bars hanging on the side of the screen.
---
I think warrior stance dancing is a close second for macro complexity, but every class becomes literally more powerful with macros. You can just keep folding more functionality into the same button with new conditions and key modifiers. As a warrior, you can do things like weapon swap to a shield and bash, then back to your weapon almost instantly. Imagine putting that in a button that stance dances to use pummel/bash. With macros, you should always be able to access Overpower/Revenge from any stance. The list goes on and on.
---
It's not that we refuse. The fact is that only a few French people speak english in their everyday lifes, so they are not used to speaking it. Some of them have only taken courses during high school and college, so 7 years of learning not very intense, and then never speak it again.  
---
Even me, I am often on reddit, but I do not speak English fluently, my accent is terrible (stereotypical), I'm just used to read it and write it thanks to the internet.  
---
No one can blame people for wanting to be comfortable when they communicate in general, especially in a game.
---
Okay bobby b, I summon you. What do you think of this sub?
---
How the hell are you supposed to do research before launch day?
---
Please explain to me what qualifies you to "know better".
---
It's been a long time for Blizzard to do anything new(not that Classic is) but everytime they did it has been a colossal failure, or actively killed the product with their management.
---
It's not the dudes who made D2/SC/WC/WoW anymore.
---
Lol no man... if you think blizzard will haul the game over to. BFA point you are ridiculous. 
---
It’s simple if a bug is happening fix it. Fuck that stupid argument of #NoChanges lol
---
I ASK YOU, NED, WHAT GOOD IS IT TO WEAR A CROWN?
---
Well if you want to have a solid amount of players once the population stabilizes then you may well have a max population of +50k players at launch. Then after a few months the vast majority of them will have left.
---
Haha. True! But, that's all the better for me. I can get ahead of the pack while people are trying to do the first quest very slowly.
---
&gt;I play to quad box 4 shamans
---
The pet AI has been really wacky.  I'll be pounding the pet attack button and my voidwalker will just sit next to me.
---
Layering doesnt work like that, if I'm not mistaken. It's on the whole server. Sharding would work that way but a layer is a certain amount of people on a whole instance of the server. Like one big shard. I think they just need to reduce the layering time frame to just like the first week and not the whole phase.
---
It’s not like I’m going to have a choice.  I’m not compiling a list of streamers I’m going to avoid, and I’m more interested in getting on a high pop server this time around so I don’t end up with no raiding guilds like the last time I did Vanilla. 
---
Worst case some jackass streamer ends up on the same server and I ignore them.
---
**Leveling** you'll do really well on the DPS front :-D
---
**Raiding and instances** you'll be a **healer**.  Embrace it and get offspec gear &lt;3
---
**PvP** you can have fun with **ele** or go **enh** with the offspec gear you get from raiding.
---
The pvp videos around enh are heavily edited to highlight WF crits / one shots etc.  The reality is you'll be super vulnerable outside of WF procs and there will be a lot of time between WF.  It's kinda like high risk high reward play.  IIRC pvp is usually best served in a hybrid role as well.
---
I'm kinda hoping for classic+ content after naxx where there are horizontal sets that enable more build diversity (without power creep), but honestly its a fun class even with the pigeonholing into healing.
---
If you Duo or Trio with anyone, you're fine no matter what you do. You'll have to get twice or thrice as many quest items though :P Just focus fire, cc extra, gg. Plus you're always already 2 out of 5 for joining/finding any dungeon, too.
---
Username checks out. I’ll always wonder why jealousy turns to hate. Just be chill
---
Good shit right here. Keep fighting the good fight 🤜🏼🤛🏼
---
He does make one fair point though, queue times.
---
Queue times doesn't care about zone congestion. Just server congestion. 
---
So if layering saves us from having 10k people in the starting zones and no queue times. And then we remove layering because the 10k people will be spread out over all the zones, wont removing layering cause all 10k people to be put on one server and thus cause queue times?
---
Downvote more...it doesn't matter.
---
What matter is that I will be a Prot Warrior in Classic and LAUGH my ass off at idiots that will waste weeks to lvl a Druid to 60, go in a raid, and getting roflstomped by bosses.
---
By the time they reroll a TRUE TANK class, I will be miles ahead them, and solidify my spot.
---
The more idiots roll Druids for tanking, the better for the players that are smart enough to roll Protection Warriors.
---
Less competition, and lot of laughter.
---
I absolutely agree with you. In a German streamer community that I joined (to avoid playing on the same server) I have read many people saying that they will not play on international servers because they are uncomfortable speaking English, especially during a leisure time activity.
---
I am really confused as to why Blizzard thinks that Germans and French won't even fill one measly server each. Generally, everything I have seen so far seems to indicated that Blizzard does not believe classic to be a success ... layering is a major sign to that belief.
---
In such case, simply come back to the nearest outpost with guards to avoid PvP, wait there five minutes and play with whoever you want.
---
Look, obviously there is some degree of inconvenience, no meal is free. But truly, wouldn't a friend wait five minutes? It's a simple solution for a simple issue.
---
You are right. And literally nobody took them because nobody was stupid enough to voluntarily move to a dead server.
---
this is why they should just keep layering past the first phase
---
Shaman is my favorite class. Alliance is my favorite faction. See the problem here? I'd like to level a warrior too at some point but can't decide if i want it to be horde to pool their gold and synergize professions or if it should be alliance. Should I give up my dream and just be an alliance warrior main? I really do hate the horde but shaman is seriously the best class in the game I'd be giving up a lot if I rolled Alliance.... anyone help me make a decision?
---
Look at this bobby b, we summoned you here!
---
IT'S A GREAT CRIME TO LIE TO A KING!
---
i noticed this as well. i played with my graphics settings numerous times but couldn't get it 'back' to the brighter, more luminescent view of the original client.
---
Lol EU
---
So granted "a more casual leaning [guild]" has a lot of subjectivity depending on your definition of casual. But for my perspective: for most non-progression raids it seemed like you almost always had 5-10 subs/alternates. Of your 30 "regulars", a few are likely to be problem afkers, IE they will afk either at bad moments, or too often in between trash packs. A few will be "deadweight" IE people with memespecs, bad specs, or who just for some reason only do 1/2- 1/3 of the DPS their class and gear should be pulling. So youre only going to have 20-25 "consistent" Raiders (consistent in attendance and quality), and about 20-25 "inconsistent" Raiders.
---
Self deprecating humor has really been cranked way the fuck up this last decade. So many people make the “don’t I suck? Isn’t it funny how worthless I am lol?” joke, often with some suicidal stuff thrown in there for good measure. 
---
Everyone plays games. Being hype for one is insanely normal. Don’t worry OP.
---
Oprawindfury, our lord and saviour
---
This kind of crap goes back to MoP on the live servers.  I remember my first time this happened- I was on a balance druid alt, and I was fighting a bear druid on Island Of Whatever Troll Raid Plus Dailies.  After a long fight, I finally had him out of escapes.  
---
Then he just disappeared off to some other place.  
---
He still listed as being in the same zone on /who.  But he sure was gone.  
---
Now, on live, this is usually triggered with other servers.  
---
Either way, it's a real shame to see something like this in "classic".
---
Fuck off. I want to play classic as much as everyone else. But i dont want to wait 2 hours to snag a hogger while 150 other people go after hogger. Thats not playing the game, thats not the kind of player interaction that i want. 
---
I want the kind that i run into 3-10 people who are also in the same quest, buff each other party up and do the objective.
---
Watching how damaging this could be to the feel of classic, particularly on PvP servers, I agree.  Watching people on discord coordinating layers to avoid opposing faction, loot gathering nodes or STV arena, etc, is incredibly bad for the game.
---
I know layering is continent wide, which makes most suggestions about only low-level zones being layered is unrealistic, but it is the only real idea that maintains the integrity of levelling and end game, while making starting out less of a shit-show.
---
Solutions seem to be one-sided in whom benefits.
---
Wow classic is about the community. 
---
One server, One community. This decision will suck.

Why UD warrior? My fiancé is going UD priest and I want a warrior but I really want to be Tauren lol
---
&gt;I will be a proud bear, and you cannot stop me.
---
Sure you will be.
---
Just make sure you have healing gear, because you ain't going to tank raids.
---
You will be a PROUD BEAR in 5 man dungs and UBRS...and that will be it.
---
This is stupid and Blizz is stupid if this stays in the game. Between this and the layering nonsense, I'm looking forward to launch a lot less
---
They're just jealous most of the world currently uses English as second language.
---
I mean, this is the nation that renamed "custard" just so they didn't have to use an English word.
---
With reasonable gear (Blue PvP or Dungeon 1 sets) you can easily duo the level 50 content (Mara princess, ST, etc) provided you have some good dps and healing between the two. My friend and I duo'd Warlock and Paladin(holy) and he would use the VW to tank
---
Totally depending on the hunters and their skill to dps.
---
In BWL we had 4 to 6 hunters because they were so valuable and ours were good. 
---
If you know how to dps you can  contribute within top 10.
---
I was raiding as a mage and hunter and was alwasy in top 5 dps myself.
---
But it comes at some costs due to good ammunition is expensive. Thats why you will see a lot of low dps hunters. Dps as a hunter is expensive
---
Hearthstone brings in more money than WoW ever will again.
---
[deleted]
---
Several usually means less than 5, normally 3-4.
---
People think layering is going to go away too. If the servers stay packed Blizz will be unable to remove layering.
---
Blizzard made a massive underestimation of WoW when it first released. Looks like they are going to do the same again.
---
Since I will be playing with 180ms ping, both leeway and spell batching are welcome to me, sorry. =x
---
This is true. I would say laying would have to turned off in the first 12 hrs to prevent any significant abuse.
---
As a French I hurt a bit when our reputation is mentioned.Even if it's fucking true though. I have proper manners and I'm fluent in English - mind if I barge in ? Kinda don't want to play with my countrymen ...  
---
Though won't that require an extra sub for someone playing on Retail EU ?
---
All hail our king bobby b!
---
It’s a neat idea. 
---
Just feel like to make it work will be way to complicated and scare away new recruits. 
---
Like the difference of “here is our simple spread sheet for DKP and how it decays over time and legendary loot is council decided” and “Welcome to my Ted talk on our casino loot system and how it works. May the odds be ever in your favor” will be a hard sell for most people. 
---
Awarding loot on merit and dedication will always be better than rolling. IMO
---
You won't even know about people from the other layers, so that's not a problem. You can only join groups with your friends and you probably won't do that often.
---
Really cool tip. Even if you upgrade your boots you could just re-equip the old enchanted boots while running from point A to point B then switch back to better boots when fighting.
---
That is layering but worse.
---
IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY!
---
Yeah, it’s a hard decision haha. Good luck with yours, and hope you’re happy about it in the end!
---
the twitch client currently supports it but it's not easy to differentiate the bfa only addons from the ones that work on classic since in the client you can't search for it.. but on curseforge you \*can\* search and hit "install with client\* button.
---
also wowinterface has an option for classic addons but it's not automatically updated / managed.

While I have been dismissing peoples crack theories claiming Layering exists because Blizz is skimping on servers as stupid - because it is stupid - I think they just had an epiphany that Classic will actually require to hire all language specific staff, essentially doubling the expenditure of those departments.
---
Either that or they are really insecure about Classics success.
---
We gotta divide ourselves then. All French people go to realms that start with an F, all Portuguese people go to realms that start with a P, and so on.
---
Absolutely. What do you think of this crossover, bobby b?
---
Nothing stops Blizz from making your character "soft attached" to the layer you start in. And if you keep grouping with your IRL friend Johnny you can both be "soft attached" to the same layer. So every time you log in you will by default get that layer.
---
It could basically be like multiple classes in a school that get grouped in one class once the vast majority has dies due to not being vaccinated... :P
---
OUT! OUT, DAMN YOU! I'M DONE WITH YOU! GO, RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE!
---
For the same reason you wrote that post in English. So that others will understand it too. I'd never even want to speak my mother's language in WoW. Doesn't it ruin the immersion too? Then again you guys dub all movies too, completely destroying their acting performance.
---
I see the edit you made, and it makes more sense now - don't worry about your language skills, I still got your point.
---
I still disagree however. I will say, it seems as if all the old Colonial power houses (France, Italy, Spain, Germany) seem to be stuck in their ways of their language being the most important one, and it shows in that those countries choose to full-audio dub everything, and have translations across the board. Children here are exposed to English at an increasingly younger and younger age, and it shows in the later years of language development.
---
As for accents, I firmly believe you are right that accents may play a part in the willingness to speak it - but I still think the Danish accent when speaking English is fucking horrid, lol. I just think in our case, we have a larger grasp on the language so we have more confidence speaking it any way.
---
I've just never seen the point of a specific-language server or service, and even Danish people having CS:GO or WoW in Danish (Even though this doesn't exist) seems foreign to me, and whenever I've seen it, I just haven't understood it. I guess you can compare me to the folks clamoring about needing to watch Anime in Japanese to really get it? It seems like I just prefer things as they were designed, not translated.
---
Why is the human race full of idiots?
---
Hello, It’s a bit a of 💩 idea ! One server = one community and not one for each language.
---
--
---
Bonjour, C’est un peu une idée  💩 ! Un serveur = une communauté et pas une pour chaque langue.
---
Hallo, Es ist eine 💩 Idee ! Ein Server = eine Community und nicht eine für jede Sprache.
---
Hola, Es un 💩 idea: ! Un server = una comunidad y no 1 para cada idioma.
---
Salve, E’ un po’ un’idea 💩 ! Un server = una comunità e non 1 per ogni lingua.
---
Have you played horde before? If not you might have a new experience with lots of new quests, so basically a new game.
---
But human warrior is seriously a great choice and lots of fun
---
I understand what they were talking about. It's why the first thing g I said was " this wont happen" and then provided reasons for why it wont happen.  Dont be such a smooth brain.
---
What happened to then?
---
Oh wow. I‘m sure you‘ll get used to this sub bobby b :)
---
Go watch a video of the BC launch and tell me you want that. I dont want 2500 people killing 10 wolves on a 5 min respawn timer
---
Sorry, but where have you pulled these numbers from exactly?
---
What I want is sharding that behaves like layering (never shifts unless specific actions are taken, such as relogging or joining a different group), which is **only** active in a list of specific zones. So yes, in retail, sharding isn't enabled in Stormwind for example at all--I want basically the inverse of this. Sharding **only** enabled in a list of specific zones, where each different shard/layer is permanent just like layering. More of a hybrid solution.
---
THANK THE GODS FOR BESSIE AND HER TITS
---
We already know Russia is getting it's own servers.
---
And we already know German, Spanish, French, and the other ~20 official languages of the EU will all be stuck together on the same servers.
---
If Blizzard planned on releasing enough realms for every language to have its own realm, they wouldn't have made this announcement.
---
He said, remonstrating dramatically.
---
Why do you assume there will be no central or mountain time realm? That’s a pretty silly thing to assume.
---
I kinda feel like warlock has to be in here. Especially if you can soulstone your the healer. Agree Paladin is probably the one so that leaves a warrior.
---
~~queue's~~ queues
---
~~area's~~ areas
---
Sorry
---
I didn't understand a word you said there partner.
---
Right, but it may take longer - nobody knows how long the population will take to come down to manageable numbers. I think it's fair to imagine that population behavior on official Classic servers may differ significantly from Private servers. Blizzard has given itself the flexibility to use layering beyond the first month if necessary, but has drawn the line at phase 2.
---
Slow kills, zero downtime. The druid way.
---
Honestly, if I were to level a druid again, at least 40+ my goal would be to test grinding bear with a group of mobs + thorns. With warstomp to squeeze off HT + renew, you can survive some oh shit overpulls surprisingly well.
---
I don‘t wholeheartedly agree with you but I can understand where you are coming from. It is just extremely exhausting to see so many different languages in chat. In case of kyrillian/asian alphabet it is just more extreme I still don’t understand none of them. It makes building a great server community just impossible.
---
Didn't say they were exclusive, but Blizzard has explicitly given the reason for layering and it is not to alleviate starter zone crowding.
---
To each their own. I don't really care either. Just saying I wouldn't bitch and moan if they did change that one thing because I care that little about it.
---
Lass HdW gehen, am Anfang bufft der Dudu MdW.
---
The people that don't want layering are the people that have a speed leveling stray and they want everyone else to get caught in the frenzy.
---
Any chance your doing past 1-10? I just practiced on the stress test got 1-10 in about 1 hour and 47 mins thanks to your guide. Getting to level 12 was an issue though with the level 3 axe. Wasnt sure if i should do the warrior quest before finishing up in durotar?
---
I think the more people they can get to test things, the better. With that said, I likely wouldnt play over the beta. I tested my class and all the quests from 1-15 and I am essentially done at this point. Was happy with my experience and glad I did it but more time wouldnt matter for me personally. I do think other people would benefit from it going over the weekend tho so I am down for it
---
It's not really about us having fun right now, unfortunately. 
---
I think they got the majority of the data they wanted yesterday, they'll probably push for more data tomorrow when it gets time to close them. 
---
The people where they're getting the other information or "letting" people have fun, are the people who got official Beta invites unfortunately.
---
It's just a couple months away, we'll be in soon enough!
---
Lolololol
---
I saw that same post, this shit drives me crazy. People always bring out these crazy wait times and quest times out of their ass like, "OMG! It's going to take me literally 15 hours to farm Ram assholes in Dun Morough for this level 8 quest! The login queue will be literally 18 hours!". 
---
There's no fucking way either of those times will be accurate and even if it does take 15 hours to farm your, that's whe someone who isn't a fucking retard realizes the quests aren't mandatory and they can do literally anything else and still level fast.
---
Want to theory craft a bit with me. I have been ranting about priests and hyrid shadow specs for days now. 
---
I think this build is awesome https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMGsVboZfZVMgz0to
---
I have no idea if it viable. My bro is gonna be a warlock so I wanted to shadowweave for him but didnt want to be stuck as full shadow and not be able to support. I kind of see this build as a counter support build. You can dps when it's necessary but otherwise you just sheild and renew your allies while mana burning and silencing enemy healers.
---
Sheep’s duration will break earlier vs players
---
Sorry but English is the universal language. If you are in US/EU you should know a bit of it. It's probably the easiest to learn.
---
It also depends on timing. Once Phase 2 is out and guilds are progressing through BWL, attendance will naturally slip on MC raids as more and more guild members don’t need items in MC and choose not to go. That’s when, as a guild, you really rely on your alternates. But honestly a guild that can’t regularly get 40 for progression raids won’t be doing much progression in the first place.
---
I'm 38 next month and delighted to see there is so many saddos like me looking forward 😂
---
Ooga ooga ooga
---
I was in a raid that killed Hogger while we were all lvl 1-2 and shouting about making a worthy sacrifice for Omar. It was absolutely amazing. I then grouped up with a priest and mage (all of us lvl 2-3 at the time) and famed lvl 7-8 mobs 1 at a time since that's all we could find. It was hard and we wiped a few times accidentally pulling more than 1 mob, but we stuck together until lvl 6 and it was so fun
---
the worst thing about playing with people who has client in another language is when they link items we see the german/french/spanish name of said item, its a bit annoying
---
Hi sorry I'm reading up on layering and I'm confused as to why you say there will be uncontested farming of all those mats/areas?
---
Won't there be guilds and players in every layer farming these things? If someone switches layers, there's no guarantee that a node will be there, or a specific mob, because a player in that layer may have already gotten it?
---
Or am I misunderstanding something?
---
So I'll just wait til August then
---
Tauren warrior with Earthshaker 2h mace = AV zerg dead.
---
True, having played with all kinds of europeans, I can say that french people are the most obnoxious in online gaming.
---
Purple rain?
---
This. Layer it for the first couple of days (through the first weekend maybe) then shut it off. Everyone will be spread out enough by then it wont matter any longer.
---
Yeah people tend to forget WoW was one of the most casual MMO RPGS on the market when it first came out.
---
Posts like these are a fucking joke. It should be titled "Thoughts about VANILLA WOW", but it won't be, because OP will never admit he doesn't like this about Vanilla.
---
This just hints that each region will only have a few servers, which hints that layering will probably last far longer than we expect/hope.
---
Thank you for demonstrating exactly what I was talking about.
---
Estimates based on what?
---
How many times a day do we have to rehash these arguments. Or maybe we need a /r/classicwowlayering sub.
---
I was intending to play a pure dps class with a focus on PvE (solo play and pug groups/raids when available), but no one else in my small group of friends is planning to tank. I want us to be able to play together, at least at launch for the first 20/30/40 levels until they get bored and give up. Historically I have always been the group's tank on retail, and I do enjoy it.
---
My question is primarily about Paladins at level 60. Are prot paladins viable for 5/10/15-man content, or would I end up wishing I had just rolled a Warrior instead? In addition, do Paladins have reliable methods of farming gold to respec frequently? I am thinking of being a prot paladin for 5-mans and AoE farming, but switching to holy when needed (whenever a raid spot is available). I've learned about DM lashers but what about before that?
---
It's mainly between Paladin (tanking and being able to find a raid spot for healing), Warrior (if I can find a guild that wants a permanent tank -- I don't want to be a dual spec warrior), Warlock (solo and voidwalker tanking for my group? DPS raids, decent at wpvp), and Rogue (solo and being efficient at wpvp/group dps).
---
Any input to help me make a decision would be appreciated, although I'm sure it will still depend on what my friends end up doing.
---
I think you’re overreacting. Did you take your meds?
---
Personally, I think Blizzard had initially planned for megaservers with permanent layering. Everything they've said all along strongly hints at this. Then the community had a hysterical tantrum about layering and Blizzard had to promise to end it as early as possible, but they probably don't quite know what else to do just yet. I think they originally intended to have realms with 20k+ online at a time, separated by layers. 
---
If they could implement some mechanics to prevent abusing layering, that would probably work out pretty well and 90% of players wouldn't even know the difference. Layering is only a serious problem when you can move through layers at will. Like if you had to be in a capital city to swap layers or give it a twenty second "cast time," and you can't swap again right away, almost all the current complaints about layering just disappear.
---
Nothing we've heard from Blizzard suggests that there'll be a large number of realms. Today's announcement makes it even more clear: there will be too few realms German, French and Spanish ones. I mean, if you imagine a total of ten realms each with 50k players online, it makes sense. It's the *only* way it makes sense. But then ditching layering after phase 1 doesn't make sense, and I don't think it was something Blizzard had planned for until /r/classicwow went apeshit.
---
dualboxing is cheating, it might not be against the rules because each account is money for blizz, but if you do this, I will see you as a cheater.
---
I believe he also raised a lot of money for charity at some point.
---
" This has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall, we think that it’s the best starting point for WoW Classic. "
---
They are pessimist. They'll add servers by language latter, but too late obviously....
---
I don't really remember earthshaker well from vanilla. Are you talking private server? I heard its proc rate there is insane.
---
Well it might be closer to “large scale sharding”, more of what their original idea was from Blizzcon. Which is much better imo.
---
I think that general will be layered because it's zone chat. And trade channel available from city, so no problems with phasing.
---
Am swiss and really considering playing on US simply because I'm afraid that too many people wont speak english on EU servers and the community will split up hard.
---
Couldn't find a reason so far why I should not roll on US.
---
Haha, I got a good internal chuckle from that.
---
You're so god damn cool, i almost cant get my hands down man!
---
That's not how advertising works
---
Priest for the dispels.  There will be so many mages and he could dispel Frost nova and even silence them with shadow talents.  Mages are your worst matchup so priest makes sense.
---
Until the end of phase 1
---
Yes it is. If there is no layering the cap would be 3k as it was back in vanilla, presumably. With layering the cap can increase because every server is split up into 2-4 layers (or however many they can hold) = more people can login, thus reducing the queue. Why layering was introduced has nothing to do with what I'm saying.
---
35 are the oldest millennial's, late 30s to late 50s is gen x, anything older than that is boomers, other than the few people in their 90s who were young adults for ww2.
---
 People literally want blizzard to recreate game and they still fail so bad.
---
 Not a single big classic streamer gives a fuck about this either, blizz has them well in place it seems.
---
YOU ARE ASKING FOR CHANGES
---
Isn't Autohotkey and hotkeynet used to create bots? I've seen them referenced in forum posts of people complaining about being banned.
---
Isboxer is the only one I seem to see isn't bannable
---
You can create character few weeks before launch. I think that they'll announce realm names before that. That's plenty of time.
---
Still better than 100% of anglophones who refuse to speak anything else
---
Blizz don't care, so throwing fits is all we have left.
---
I'm seeing all these problems about Classic WoW that rabid gamers are debating. Just don't play at launch.
---
Hear me out! You wait a week or even one or two days, you avoid all the server crashes/queues. You avoid the cluster fuck rat race that will be the starting areas. Even if you are behind the bell curve you will still find players leveling and have that personal WoW experience of seeing the same names. Hell most 2004 players are adults with responsibilities, you might even catch up to the pack. The only downfall is you won't get to be the big dick top dog elite server first 60. Just pretend Classic Wow release date is August 30th.
---
Haven't been in france since I was a kid, but that's the general story I hear from people who told me about their vacation in france.
---
As long as I'm not on the same server as asmongold or sodapoppin I'm chillin.  Having tens of thousands of live-viewers jerk these guys off is absurd.
---
Why design for players who will quit? Better to design for the people who will stay
---
Nice offhand comment that adds nothing, maybe learn not to double post like a retard.
---
You understand that Blizzard is responsible for the changes that dragged us so far away from Classic ya?
---
Layering is more expensive in the short term, but long term it's cheaper to use layering for awhile than it is to have excess servers after the initial hype does down and the population drops to a stable amount.
---
Photo bucket!! I forgot about that, hoping I remember my password as I’m sure there’ll be tons of pics on there
---
I'm 36, doing the same. I have a wife and a daughter, but does that make me less sad than you? Probably not. Cheer up, bro. Everything's fine, no matter how old and nerdy you are.
---
Not many people think 1-12 shouldn't be layered. As always these "non-popular opinion" posts are popular.
---
Rip WWelle
---
as someone who will be rolling a priest on launch, I find it amusing that no one in this topic is considering a priest (except for those who are leveling with a dps class). Everyone is mage vs warlock vs rogue with some warriors and the occasional shaman/pally.
---
Paladin, obviously
---
Where did I ask for changes?
---
Great post, I agree with almost everything but one. 
---
Layering will not be going anywhere. It is literally baked into the client and server.
---
If Classic is even moderately successful in terms of player population when phase two rolls around, you don’t think it will activate when larger groups of level capped players are moving through zones to raid towns, cities and raid level bosses?
---
Layering is needed for all the reasons you stated but as soon as if fucks up a dragon kill or the defense of a city, people will walk away.
---
Because layering prevents dead servers after the initial hype dies down. 
---
Dead servers lead to server merges, and people having to rename their characters. That's the least vanilla experience ever.
---
I may or may not have been 19.
---
&gt;Had a boar disappear on me mid fight as it rushed towards me, and had 2 random players phase in.
---
Aside from what other people have already pointed out, phasing is literally not a thing in Classic. They are not using it. There's absolutely NO CHANCE you encountered Phasing because it's just not there. Unless you joined a group, nothing could phase out. If you did, congratz, you discovered layering.
---
"I'm very opinionated on things that I have absolutely no clue about and I won't even spend 10 minutes checking if I'm right before posting my opinion on a public forum"
---
Fantastic post, keep it up.
---
I was in full groups and I set up a macro on my mousewheel to target attack, and spun that mother fucker like mad.  It got old, very old, and I agree that layering is the worst thing to ever come to Vanilla, but for the first week I want it to be heavily used.
---
If this was TBC arena you would be correct.
---
Maybe my Nordic is showing, but we had two choises, either learn English or flood into unofficial country servers like Italians did with Crushridge and Finns with Stormreaver and so on...
---
Also I'll gladly take communicating with Frenchies over trying to emote and poorly translating words to Chinese players on Nost.
---
1. There were no Central or Mountain time realms on the open Stress Test.
---
2. Europe has roughly the same playerbase as US and there are 3 more common languages in the EU than English and none of them are getting their own server, which means Europe is only getting a few realms.
---
3. Blizzard is using Layering to completely remove the need for extra realms that will end up dead.
---
4. Server time is arbitrary and has nothing to do with the location of the physical server infrastructure, so they really don't care if all the Central and Mountain time people have to pick West and East coast realms.
---
In part, but Blizzard also explicitly said they would be experimenting with different layering settings, and part of the feedback they were looking for was how the early leveling experience felt (so they could compare player perceptions to how layered things were).

---
Well, I didn't understand the reference, but it was obviously a joke because for what you did keybinds don't matter.  
---
I guess people are usually too salty to understand non-obvious jokes or sarcasm.
---
How so? How is it literally pay2win? I'm paying for two accounts, I'm exerting double the effort to play two characters. I'm not exploiting anything in the game.
---
How is it any different from having two accounts and playing two accounts on two laptops? 
---
Because I have a machine that can run two instances of the game I'm a cheater? This logic confuses me.

Seems like a bias driven by envy.

Nice short comment adding nothing to the conversation. Maybe put in a modicum of effort into your comments you make before shitting out a comment again please.

I blame Einstein.
---
I was pretty set on playing a holy priest for raiding primarily, and probably some pvp as well, but now I am considering a druid with the hotw hybrid spec to tank/heal dungeons &amp; raid heal
---
Any thoughts on how much the added versatility of hotw druid is is worth it? Or if I should just stick with priests for healing in raids?
---
fixed
---
i think blizzard will came up with the best solution. maybe they have already a plan but don't publish it until they get rid of layering. it is way harder to abuse mechanics if you don't know every detail of it
---
Disable changing layers while in combat. Boom, most of the problem solved. And remember, it's only for content wave 1, too.
---
Can anyone who played a level 60 priest in vanilla tell me what this would be like: I want to play shadow priest in pvp but I also want to raid and see how that is but I hear shadow is no good for pve so if I went holy for pve and shadow for pvp, how taxing is the the respec cost without having an alt to farm gold and me just playing my one character?
---
I don't know no.
---
The attack power bonus of the Orc racial effects both white hits and yellow hits while the Troll racial only effects white hits.  Haste is multiplicative in vanilla so the more sources of haste you have the more value you get out of it.  Attack power and melee haste will both increase your rage generation and neither increase the damage of Execute.  If you aren't using axes the two races are very close.
---
The fact that Blizzard just announced that the 3 most common languages in the EU aren't getting their own servers.
---
What a biggoted post!
---
Nah, retail. It was called vendorshaker for a reason. Wep is bad compared to any other wep... but. And a huge but. That's those PvP moments. Especially AV.

A warrior/rogue shouldn't lose to a hunter.  There are a lot of variables perhaps the most important of which is player skill.  A knowledgeable skilled/focused hunter can beat an unfocused/unskilled rogue or warrior but if all things are equal they don't stand a chance.
---
They changed sharding (zone based) to layering (continent based) why is it so hard for people to believe they could easily change it so that layer 1,2,3,..,n-1 exist for starting zones and then layer n exclusively exists for all other zones????

Damn, I had hoped to not play with monolingual idiots, but I guess blizzard shoving 15 year old frenchies down my throat. Thank god russia isn't included.

then why not offer free server transfers every 3 months for classic servers?
---
(French here) We are so bad at speaking English, this drive me crazy. It's not that hard so speak at least a simple international English.
---
I think it's because our educational system for languages is very bad (We have many English or German teacher's that never travelled abroad to learn the language and accent on the original country.
---
And because many of us are just lazy bitches that don't want to learn, this drive me really crazy.
---
I work in IT, so I MUST be able to at least understand it, but it's so convenient to know how to speak, write and understand the n°1 language in the world.

I don't bother having an international servers for wow classic. But I'm really hoping that everybody will make the effort to speak English on global chat.

i'm pretty sure i saw a guy.. 5 boxing last night. was like 5 dwarf pallies. 1 male and 4 female. all moving in unison.
---
I'm currently deciding between Hunter, Shaman &amp; Rogue. Was leaning towards Hunter until I found out almost all the best ranged weapons for hunters at 60 are crossbows. For whatever reason I don't like the style of crossbows(animations and the look) so it is deterring me from playing hunter. 
---
Unfortunately, I am very big on aesthetics which is the main reason I am considering Rogue(love swords). I usually lean towards the "rogue-like" classes in games, but am afraid of the rogue being boring to play and overpopulated.  How enjoyable is the rogue in PvE? I know they are "beasts" in PvP.
---
I like the look and concept of shamans too, but being cornered into Resto for dungeons and raids is something I am not sure I will enjoy. Totem twisting seems cool and the variety in specs for PvP is appealing too. Is healing in dungeons/raids fun?
---
Lol you're close! I'm actually just finished with all that ! I'm in my 20's :)

I started university then, which was a big deal to me, but it's probably unimportant in the grand scheme of things compared to the launch of the WoW website.
---
people who actually wanted to play classic would probably be like, i'll come back tomorrow. 
---
Sure that isn't ideal that players can't play the night they want to but it's significantly better to have 1 night ruined than the economy and world pvp ruined for months to come.

It’s really good and setups the lore of WoW great. There is also the WoW chronicles books for EVEN MORE LORE!
---
Blizzard assumes all classic players are no life unemployed neckbeards like we were 15 years ago...   I HAVE A JOB NOW BLIZZARD you were half right!
---
Millions makes sense. The private server community alone is in the hundreds of thousands, and it's a pretty safe bet that practically all of them will try Classic. I wouldn't be surprised at all if 3-4 million swinging dicks tune in for launch, and while not everyone will stick around, there's no reason to expect that the vast majority will quit again right away, or that nobody will join post-launch. I could easily see a stable, sustained playerbase of over 2 million worldwide.
---
Oh for fucks sake. So EU players now have to wait a few weeks to find out which server is going to be in their language?
---
I've thought about that, but I've honestly always loved the idea and look of Horde. I wish I started as Horde. The way I look at it, is it'll give me a FULL fresh experience since I've never had a max level horde.
---
:D
---
RMP has always been good even if its just 3 guys in WPVP
---
For christ sake, i dont want to end up on a server where the baguettes and german wurst are being spammed in the channels -\_-'
---
Layering has multiple purposes, and EVENTUAL declining server populations is perhaps it's final goal so they *don't* have to merge servers, but it is not it's initial purpose at all.
---
That's what I'm saying
---
&gt; It's laughable to not have a french realm. 
---
It's laughable to not be able to communicate in English on a basic level in 2k19.
---
Are you talking about [DONNERZORN, GESEGNETE KLINGE DES WINDSUCHERS]?????
---
Et ils auront raison, blizzard se fout vraiment de notre gueule.
---
The true stress test was me at work all day thinking killing boars
---
Genuine question, why do Germans seem to dislike playing with their own kind so much?
---
"Sword Rogue" like it matters at level 15... You don't even have the relevant talents to be an "X rogue". You have 6 talent points, put them where you want.
---
I mean, that's just more servers and merges with extra steps.
---
Must've hit close to the mark to get you all riled up.
---
Never trust blizzard
---
Consider me into the Layering is good, gimme dat smooth leveling experience camp.
---
I'm not really thinking about that. That seems different from just running two games and alt tabbing between them no?
---
More or less, some streamer are really really chill. But some have some weird god complex... It's kinda fucked up...
---
unless one is backpeddling, backpeddling is the only movement that doesnt activate leeway.
---
I loved AV during Christmas time when the snowballs were added. I would stealth on the bridge and hit any alliance on the bridge and laugh as they fell to the bottom. Never killed them but I got way too much satisfaction knowing they had to run all the way back up.
---
T-thanks your grace
---
You're trolling right...
---
Blizzard:
---
&gt;Re-releases game were community and communication is the main focus of the game
---
&gt;Decides to have servers with idiots speaking 5 different languages at the same time
---
Except private servers had, and still have crazy high non-Vanilla populations.
---
I think so too
---
It's a big issue, until one streamer announces a campaign to ring the Scarab Gong on *every server* using several accounts, with the collaboration of his friends to play those accounts *and* all his viewers helping with the proccess on each server.
---
Then it becomes a big *disaster.*
---
Interesting! Are you planning to heal?
---
You're right!
---
Good, yes. But there are better alternatives in Vanilla. Namely anything that involves Paladins and warriors.
---
Yeah I’m beginning to remember the way macros worked after /scripts 
---
They are just as complex if not more because of all the stuff you can .... stuff into the macros
---
Nice! :D
---
You must love the op
---
I agree with you, but also can't shake this idea now that Classic Wow is an attempt to remake the Beatles without Yoko, before John died.
---
It's because you dub your TV. That's the primary reason Scandinavians understand English better.

I made [this range comparison picture](https://i.imgur.com/qVNF1D9.jpg) by overlaying two screenshots with a matching camera angle from Perp's vid.
---
Keep in mind this is not pixel perfect. Nonetheless it matches almost exactly with the expected +2.66 yards from melee leeway.
---
Unfortunately I can not make the same comparison with the orc or the gnome parts because the camera angles do not match at any point, but my observation is that any race benefits from the same melee leeway and it is not based on initial melee reach/hitbox size.
---
You clearly didn’t play at launch. Vanilla launch was a complete clusterfuck of epic proportions.
---
That's just, like, your opinion man.
---
&gt;But ho-damn is the initial starter zone experience a cluster-f**K. Ignoring the sad soft-launch of the stress test at 2pm during a work day, come 5pm it was like looking at a swarm of locusts fighting for crumbs. This is objectively not a fun experience.
---
It baffles me how someone can come to such a conclusion. The starting zones were a breeze, even after they consolidated the zones. The stress test felt very empty.
---
You're not a sword rogue for many more levels my friend.
---
Guess you need it now. Should have designed better education system.
---
I'm hoping they do, I want plenty of attempts at clearing DM at level 15!
---
Helps that it's based in an existing franchise, even if Warcraft 3 was still under development then too.
---
Lol he's munching on Tide Pods
---
You are arguing such a hyperbole no one will take you seriously. Why is the economy argument only a slippery slope argument with you idiots?
---
Reading my own post, the only downside I see is that the spinning up of additional servers to meet demand will require some management or intelligent algorithms.
---
I suppose, they can prep a list of names, and if a server type (PvE, PvP, RP, RP-PvP) becomes exhausted (high population on all current servers of that type), then the system automatically adds a new server to one of the existing clusters, or creates a new cluster. Then we get a new server with low pop, and a lock on the high pop for new signups until the newly spun up server reaches mid pop. Probably what they did originally as well, only with physical server blades.
---
Not retweeting anyone with a 9gag shirt, sorry.
---
Found the guy who never loots.
---
You don't need to have a gold farming alt no. but if you want to respec every week you will be farming an extra hour or two depending on the farming method.
---
There is a healer/shadow build that is used for raiding to maintain shadow weaving while still being a healer.  Because of that shadow priests won't really have much of a place in a min/maxed raiding comp.  Of course a semi-hardcore/casual guild can definitely roll with a committed spriest, however that is 2 extra debuff slots going to one guy so you probably need to already be pretty popular in your guild.

I know a guy on retail with a druid named Autism. He refuses to dungeon or go to populated areas because he doesn't want it to get reported.
---
Its probably not calibrated properly
---
1. You think they would have made a server for every single time zone for a stress test?
---
2. You don’t know that. 
---
3. You don’t know that. You don’t even have a server list. 
---
4. That’s the most backwards logic I have ever seen. If server time is arbitrary and doesn’t matter, why wouldn’t they have other server times in?
---
All of your logic is you just assuming things based off a stress test lol. 
---
Wanna know why EU doesn’t have many stress test servers? Maybe because the stress test has been mostly NA players? Have you not seen all the EU players crying about having an active sub but can’t stress test?
---
The problem with a system like this is that you will get a lot of people passing on small upgrades and only ever wanting to roll on large upgrades.
---
Having leveled in 3 stress tests already, Honestly i'm a little burned out on leveling disposable characters, I'd probably sit out the weekend and catch up on my steak an rum hobbies instead.
---
Dont get me wrong, I wish it turns out like that but...hundreds of thousands?? where do you people get these numbers from seriously? The biggest vanilla pserver has somewhere around 10k players and you have to take into account that a good portion of those play vanilla pservers cause they are free. Ask them to pay 15 bucks a month. I really want classic to be big but I cant understand from where you people are getting your estimations.
---
My question is, how am I supposed to predict which server a streamer will be on? I'm going to reserve my name ASAP and hope for the best.

I noticed that trees are not LOS breakers in Teldrassil and I had MOBs running through them. IDK if that's old behavior or not.

Frankly I don't see that getting fixed. MOBs in terrain have been a thing since at least TBC when I started. Today you can go out to Ghostlands or Azuremyst and find MOBs that have been stuck in terrain since 2008.

Yes, would help with pvp in cities defending the king, and add to the real life feel of the cities
---
Generally speaking, several means between 3 and 9. It's pretty easy to surmise that when they use a word like 'several' do describe the sum total of EU realms, it's not gonna be in the dozens. You wouldn't look at thirty apples and say "that's several apples."
---
It all started with getting pushed out a window.
---
Heck, even a distinction between civilized western Europe and the adidas-wearing scum of the east would be fantastic.
---
&gt; merge the low pop servers
---
This is worse than sharding. yes, sharding, not layering. How can you morons say shit like "poisonous design philosophies" and only throw out your own half baked ideas? Sit back in your armchair and continue to develop from it, i'm sure you'll eventually be hired.
---
Really grasping at straws now aren’t we
---
1. Leveling hasn't been part of character progression since vanilla, 2. No expansion other than Legion has a way to progress your characters spells (other than tier sets) 3. WoD was the first expansion to have profession system that was different from the vanilla to MoP system, 3. Gear in WoD was the exact same as cata and wotlk, 4. What do other games have to do with the "character progession in wow". Also why do you assume someone on a video game sub reddit hasn't played multiple RPGs?
---
what makes Ally better in the meta game? just Pallys?
---
i dont play wow nowadays and im only coming back for classic
---
wtf is layering? like what the actual fuck is it? that wasnt in wow when i last played a few years ago so what is it and why is it in classic? 
---
and is that phasing i see in the stv clip? what the fuck?
---
Haha haha, it’s not going to happen this way when it goes live.
---
Just pretend that eastern european languages are trollish
---
Germanic languages are orcish
---
and Spanish/French are the language of the undead
---
Helps immersion
---
&gt;  In the rule of large numbers SOME servers WONT lose massive amount of population simply through RNG
---
This is the opposite of how statistics works. The large numbers here are players per server. The number of servers will be small.
---
Intra-server decohesion, irrespective of whether it's from load balancing (sharding, layering) or for storytelling purposes (phasing), is intrinsically antithetical to the one fundamental, defining feature of an MMO:  A persistent-state world.
---
'nuff said.
---
How long did it take to cool off?
---
Because you are able to do more as 1 person by paying more money, than any other person who plays for 1 sub. That's pay2win.
---
each "layer" is the entire world. it's not zone by zone or area by area. it's like a server within a server, if that makes sense.
---
You lose identity for the first 2 weeks (or however long layering is in place).  For most players, that's like levels 1-30.  It's not ideal at all, we can agree on that much.  But it's better than basically planned mergers.  With a server merge, as I said, some players will literally lose their character name.  If that's not a worse way of losing your identity, I don't know what is.
---
Hahahaha - you realize that adding layers is the same solution as adding more realms. Both are just dispersing the player base. Except one major exploit potential.
---
That doesn't really make any sense though. 
---
If you had to purchase classic as its own expansion for $60 or whatever then I'd be all against layers on release as well purely because most of the people playing will dedicated long term players. In this case access to classic comes free with a regular retail subscription so everyone and their Nan will be ready to log in and try it out come aug the 27th filling servers up with a bunch of tourists.

If you can't speak english properly enough to communicate online (not asking you to be fluent) you should consider getting back to school or taking online courses. Mes 2 centimes.
---
Unstoppable
---
We can speak English in eastern Europe, mr. Civilized. Get fucked.
---
I feel it's mostly just for low levels: at higher levels, you do enough grinding anyways that there is no pressure to complete quests, if you take a bad route, have to grind through 20 extra mobs, and find a couple herb nodes, that's probably what you intended to do anyways. And it depends on your leveling route heavily. 
---
Professions, though, are a big deal. It's a very good idea for your chosen professions, to look over what you can make, what you want to make, and identify
---
- what recipes you need to get that aren't trainable (ie: elixir of fortitude, or the bear meat recipe in theslamar that you need to cook the bear meat you find in darkshore)
---
- what recipes can only be acquired in a specific place  (a lot of the alchemy recipes can only be learned for alliance in darnassus, for some reason, not stormwind or ironforge).
---
- and what materials are used for multiple recipes: so that you can decide what you want to use them for and deliberately avoid using them for the alternate, worse purpose. (Briarthorn makes lesser and regular healing potions, and you should not make the former if you don't need to, and clam meat can make clam chowder (level 15 food), or boiled clams (level 5 buff food). So obviously, don't boil any clams.
---
Blizzard supporting only the 4th most popular language in the EU means they want the other 3 languages all on the same realm, which is likely to mean the EU will have very few realms. If the EU was getting at least 8 realms, they wouldn't have made this decision. I gave them 5. The EU has a larger playerbase than the US, but I gave the US 6 anyway.
---
Need. All. Of. The. Bandages.
---
I don't think renaming your character is a big deal. It sucks, but living in a dead server sucks way more.
---
Is that durotar I see in the background? Wow, brings back memories!
---
LeT's SiT tOgEtHeR, yOu AnD mE!
---
This is some insane mental gymnastics here
---
I'm not sure a macro would fix the bugs he's talking about
---
I made this [range comparison picture](https://i.imgur.com/qVNF1D9.jpg) by overlaying two screenshots with a matching camera angle from Perp's vid.
---
*Keep in mind this is not pixel perfect. Nonetheless it matches almost exactly with the expected +2.66 yards from melee leeway.*
---
Actually thank you for correcting me. English was my second language and my impression was that several was used as a synonym to many, in fact I thought it was used to emphasize the large quantities lol. TIL.
---
I can tell you why. Since you're danish you probably grew up learning english from a young age. Any kind of media, be it movies, tv shows, video games etc. you were forced to watch/play the english original. In countries like germany, france, italy and spain that is not the case. Basically everything gets dubbed (not 100% sure about italy and spain, but france and germany pretty much dub everything) so the germans, french, italians and spanish people are never forced to really learn english beyond what they learn in school and most engish teachers are pretty horrible (at least in germany).
---
Compared to that, especially the dutch and scandinavians are forced to learn english. They learn english when they are 4 by watching the original dub of spongebob squarepants and then they get their first video game which is also completely in english because dubbing is not financially viable for small countries. By the time the kids from the netherlands and scandinavia start school their english is often better than many german, french, italian and spanish adults.
---
I've played online and always loved to play with scandinavians, dutch and even eastern europeans. Most of them speak english really well, even in the nationalistic eastern european countries. On the contrary french and italians are a pain in the ass. They either refuse to speak english or can't even put together a complete english sentence. I just straight up left ranked overwatch games when I was grouped up with some french players simply because they refused to communicate with me in english.
---
I think the dub culture that exists in major european countries has done more harm than good. The children lack behind in their language skills, it probably also hurts european solidarity and clearly hurts online gaming. The dub culture really shouldn't exist anymore, at the least childrens movies and tv shows shouldn't be dubbed anymore as children are taken away the best opportunity in their life to learn another language playfully.
---
This is the big problem with Blizz not giving us different language servers. It's just gonna be a mess with german guilds who can't communicate with french guilds who can't communicate with italian guilds etc. Only the russians can look forward to a good time.
---
I want to play holy paladin, its what I enjoy playing in retail. I love the class identity, the whole holy crusader aspect. Problem is that I have to play horde in order to play with my friends. I suppose I can play priest because of the same holy crusader thing or warlock because I like those. 
---
My question is whether or not holy paladin is fun enough that I should ditch my friends and enjoy myself, or try and find satisfaction with lock and priest on the horde? Thanks in advance.
---
A pet attack macro mixed with a charge macro fixes almost everything he said
---
There's a decent chunk of german, french and spanish players that straight up don't speak well enough english and even more that might speak it well enough but don't want do deal with having to do so. Reddit likes to get all high n mighty saying "wow so entitled they expect their national servers" when in reality a huge amount of players from NA would be pissed off as well if they suddenly had to play on spanish servers (I guess spanish is the second language in NA? Does NA have a second language?). IDK what Blizzard thinks this will accomplish, I guess they want to save money this way somehow but I know plenty of people that will refuse to play on english servers simply because they don't understand it well enough.
---
ROFL what are you talking about? Any time you mention anything bad about layering in this sub, 10 people instantly downvote you.
---
Tbh that layering exploit is easily fixed with randomised layering and the game client not revealing to the player what layer they're in?
---
They can make layering happen after combat ends. There are better solutions to the problems people come up with. You are not responsible for coming up with solutions, only presenting the problems.
---
enjoy this report
---
Sharding != layering tho
---
I have not played horde pre-cataclysm. The vast majority of vanilla kalimdor is brand new to me. I never once did maraudon pre-lfg for example. It would be exciting to explore there. But I can accomplish that leveling a night elf too to some extent right? Ashenvale to stone talon and all that jazz. The main appeal to me about warrior is that my time is important to me and being a tank makes finding groups a heck of a lot easier and night elf wisp form makes corpse runs much quicker too. Ugh just 2 days ago I'd have been all in on going shaman but now I'm having doubts.
---
I played the stress test last night with a ping under 100ms.
---
exactly.... Starting to have this feeling too. 
---
Looks like our new "beloved" CEO called ( you think you do but you don't ) wants so hard to show us that we really did/donot want this at all :D
---
??? I hate all of you elitist fuckers here.
---
So layering is cheaper. We obviously are talking about long term, we don't expect classic to last a couple of months.
---
So you're saying no one can own multiple accounts or they are cheaters?
---
Pay2Win is saying you pay Blizzard for an advantage over other players. I'm not paying Blizzard for an advantage.
---
I will level slower, I won't play either of the two classes nearly as efficiently as if I was playing one. I am disadvantaging myself more than gaining anything substantial.
---
If I was paying money to get gear or ranking or to skip levels entirely then that is more so Pay2Win.
---
Leaving space to add servers is perfectly fine. Not creating any language-specific realm and therefore severely impacting my classic experience because of their low expectations is not.
---
I was against sharding in starting zones, but it does not seem so bad anymore.
---
Yes, I can hear it too
---
In france we can't. Nothing to be ashamed of.
---
Hunters have had it far too easy with their broken pets payback time.
---
I love and i disagree that most of the population wont speak english
---
From my experience from average private server guilds we needed to bench people more often than not.
---
I'm glad you let one dramatized post (full of misinformation) guide your life.
---
They have already been reported. Reporting them again won't do anything.
---
&gt; They can make layering happen after combat ends. 
---
 That barely fixes the problem, and Rogues and Hunters will still abuse it. 
---
&gt; You are not responsible for coming up with solutions, only presenting the problems.
---
Umm, ok?
---
Thanks for your answer.
---
&gt;I still disagree however. I will say, it seems as if all the old  Colonial power houses (France, Italy, Spain, Germany) seem to be stuck  in their ways of their language being the most important one, and it  shows in that those countries choose to full-audio dub everything, and  have translations across the board. Children here are exposed to English  at an increasingly younger and younger age, and it shows in the later  years of language development. 
---
I don't think any of those countries think that their language is the most important one. It's just their language so they want to protect it. Everything being dubbed has more to do with the market size than a state policy. If the number of locutors is not high enough it's not worth it for the productors to dub it, that's why I think we started to have dub everywhere in France and not in Danemark. After, when people are used to it, it just snowballs and you can't go back. It may look trivial but I think it plays a huge part in the proficiency of English.
---
The number of locutors is also very important on Internet. The French or Spanish internet is quite big and self sufficient most of the time, simply because the number of locutors is high. That might not be the case in Danemark so it's another incentive to work on your English.
---
&gt;As for accents, I firmly believe you are right that accents may play a  part in the willingness to speak it - but I still think the Danish  accent when speaking English is fucking horrid, lol. I just think in our  case, we have a larger grasp on the language so we have more confidence  speaking it any way. 
---
Now that I think about it it's true that Danish have a strong accent aswell lol So it might just come down to practice. In France people are self concious about their accent and it can block them.
---
&gt; I've just never seen the point of a specific-language server or service,  and even Danish people having CS:GO or WoW in Danish (Even though this  doesn't exist) seems foreign to me, and whenever I've seen it, I just  haven't understood it. I guess you can compare me to the folks clamoring  about needing to watch Anime in Japanese to really get it? It seems  like I just prefer things as they were designed, not translated. 
---
It's just a question of habbit. I know a lot of people that were used to the Vanilla French client where the town and mob names where in English so they want it back for Classic even though they don't speak English :)
---
I thought they were eventually removing it permanently? So why would we need a petition?
---
I'm old, shit
---
This isint possible... must be a glitch. Venruki is a famous streamer and top player. This is arenas we are talking about which makes him the top 1% of pvpers
---
I don't understand....have these people never heard of a beta before? If you kept your character it would be early access... My God
---
So we should propose that as a fix instead of whining about the whole concept withiut an effective solution. 
---
From what i can tell, they know of the problem, they are working on fixes and ideas for fixes. Its up to the community to recommend solutions that we want. Not just complain about every fart and sneeze they do.
---
Above level 10
---
Resilience (split pve and PvP gear entirely)
---
Arenas 
---
Killed off the use of normal battlegrounds
---
Gem sockets were just overall a hassle
---
Flying mounts
---
Summoning stones
---
Total obsolescence of all prior content from level 50-60, including zones.
---
World PvP died
---
The sheer volume of attunement quests was nothing short of obnoxious
---
Vast power creep
---
Single hallway style instances
---
Economy inflation (people first started hitting the ~250k gold cap halfway in the expansions life cycle). Gold became significantly less important after your epic flying mount.
---
Revamp of most classes which took away from the uniqueness of many classes, I.e every spec was equally as good at DPs. It made hybrids too strong in pve and PvP imo 
---
Removal of faction restrictions on shamans paladins (the beginning of class honegenization and normalization).
---
Capital was a true faction neutral town. And not like BB where you could still fight in some way. No -- it was a true shared neutral town. It broke down the whole horde v alliance mentality. PvP and the entire purpose of having a split faction became a side show instead of a major theme in wow.
---
And just the theme of "Orcs &amp; and humans ** In Spaaaaace!** The new gear sets and color pallets just became even *more* obnoxious and cartoonish. Purple and pink neon crystals fucking everywhere. It's where the "Clown Suits" random gear jokes really started because to be honest every item set and gear just looked so bad and over the top.
---
There are more things I'm sure but just overall I would not waste my time on a classic TBC.
---
It's core features, which makes the Hunter unplayable -- not just a simple issue they can fix later once the game is out -- also are you aware the game was released 15 years ago and didnt had these bugs? no?   
---
And if you think 2 months is a lot of time before the release well think again lol  -- and it's been known since day 1 but still no fix -- a beta should have 100% of the core features working as intended, so it's looking pretty bad.
---
Ok thanks,  I had no idea
---
If you dont speak English in 2019 and you have access to the internet your just a retard
---
I cant even imagine being a programmer with out knowing English when 99% of the global resources are written in it
---
Great because most players playing live will probably not play classic for long and I honestly can't see millions jumping into to warrant too many servers, the game has aged with no way to bring and keep new players in unless you are really into MMORPGS and even then, most of us here already know what to do once we hit 60 so the burnouts will happen, fast.
---
I really hope I don’t have any UK on my server they are just awful
---
This is going to be a mess, reminds me of KnightOnline, where everyone spoke different languages and It was hard to find someone who spoke your language
---
Im fine with blizzard underestimating the success of classic, but now they negatively impacted our classic experience with their decision to not give language-specific realms, this im not okay with.
---
You might wana look at your own comments then pleb
---
Are all of your friends playing shamans?  For my friend group we chose our faction based one who was playing what.  One friend wanted to play pally and that decided it for us.  If you are that committed to pally unless someone is equally passionate about shaman it seems like a no-brainer for everyone to play ally.
---
They said it will definitely be gone by phase 2.  They said the plan is to remove it as soon as possible.
---
lol what? a macro? what does it have to do with these bugs?
---
Show us your glowing resume that Blizzard denied.
---
I do know that EU has more active characters than US, you can lookup the numbers yourself. Without Russia, they're about even.
---
So if over half the EU player population isn't getting their own servers, what makes you think Central and Mountain, which aren't even half the player population, would get their own servers?
---
Lol it another name for a balance Druid.
---
I can explain why Stormwind was a ghost town. One, yes you played at night, but that is not the main reason. The stress test only goes to lvl15. Stormwind is a very important city for a lot of reasons, but it is not very important below lvl15. So no one can be above level 15.
---
 Also stormwind is where most people go to chill during their free time. For this stress test, everyone wanted to kill stuff as fast as possible, so no one "had the time" to chill in Stormwind, because they were busy leveling up in goldshire.
---
Once the game is officially released, and out for a couple days, Stormwind will be *way* more popular! I promise! 
---
Also the most popular area in Stormwind is the Trade District. There are less people in the other areas, usually.
---
Yes, obviously...
---
Terrible decision. I don’t want to play with shitloads of people who refuse to speak English.
---
How does it change
---
Because you clearly are clicking your pet abolities and complaining they aren’t efficient. Make some pet utility macros and never have these problems again
---
&gt; I can't find a duel 
---
layering exists because there would be TOO many people to duel otherwise. You are a moron.
---
&gt;I don't know a single person in real life who knows the meaning of Twitch emotes
---
then youre either a normie or not really young :p
---
there are millions of views on twitch everyday btw and it's growing steadily
---
think about the fact that just asmongold and sodapoppin will reach more than 100k views on launch day. that's a decent amount of people. the twitch culture is spreading to games that go well with streaming like WoW, Overwatch, Fortnight yadyada. I said boomer because old people are usually out of touch with the trend of the interweb. like it's fine if not everyone would know any twitch memes but then again it brings me to my initial notion of " nobody forces you to scream POG whenever you feel excited but at the same time you can't tell other people what not to say just because you don't like it" and " it's not like the ANAL thunderfury jokes were any better really"
---
I can't be wrong here
---
thats abit more riske because guards will kill you if you mc enemy faction.
---
There is a way to pick one
---
Oh man that raid on Ironforge is still the capstone of my WoW memories. I can't wait for world PvP to actually matter again!
---
Challenge accepted.
---
Make layers permanent servers like hellscream 1 and 2 and 3, then merge them when population permits.
---
&gt;2. Europe has roughly the same playerbase as US and there are 3 more common languages in the EU than English and none of them are getting their own server
---
This is not what Blizzard said. Those are your fairy tales. Blizzard didnt say all severs would be english. They said they wouldnt split them in to different languages. Which means the servers are international and not that they are english. Sure english will be the most common language but they will not be english servers. To me this simply means that instead of having 50 en, 50 de, 50 fr, 50 es and 50 it servers (OBVISOULY JUST RANDOM NUMBERS), that instead there will bethe same number of servers as before but that they are international.
---
Now were gonna be stuck with a bunch of unofficial german/spanish/french/Portuguese servers causing lots of people to have to re-roll or get stuck on a server where they cant interact with most of the community.
---
Dumb decision by blizzard. At least start with their own servers, and then if they dont have a big enough community merge them afterwards. This is just gonna cause drama for no reason
---
This isnt wow classic
---
I've used all 3 for numerous years (going on 18 now dual/multiboxing various mmorpg's). I've never been banned or even warned from any GM.
---
As for being bots? I have no idea. I've never tried to automate anything. I assume its possible as you can set a repeat.
---
I use mine strictly for pressing A, B, anything, and the 2nd or more clients pressing A, B, anything, but never a timer/repeat.
---
I'm in beta and the beta login is under "development" not "live".  What you are seeing here is the stress test.
---
Ya I keep seeing this. I have to keep telling myself they are just trolling but after 20+ posts all asking the same thing I'm starting to wonder.
---
Hey man, offspec theory crafting is what I have the most fun doing! More power to ya
---
I simply considered the possibility of something like that happening.
---
It probably won't, but it could.
---
Yeah, myself included.
---
Also pleb? what year is this?
---
Nice comment history in that case ya fucking hypocrite, welcome to blocked. Troll
---
JA JA ZUG ZUG   
---
its going to be a shitshow for sure
---
Wow, you are a terrible person.
---
I'm 23. Perhaps Twitchspeak and such are more common in the United States. Again, I don't know anybody--as far as I know Twitchspeak is the Gen Z thing, high schoolers and down.
---
Hi all! After some great feedback and responses from [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhpe1p/introducing_flight_master_a_tool_to_help_navigate/), I made a list of changes and improvements and started working on the next version. Now I'm happy to announce v1.3! The biggest new feature is the use of spells, items and hearthstone to help you find the fastest way to travel between locations. 
---
I've also done some quality of life changes too - you can now click on points on the map and select "Go To" or "Go From" those locations and hovering over each point will now show the tooltip. 
---
**Patch notes**
---
* Added option to use druid / mage spells, engineering items and hearthstone to calculate faster travel times
---
* Added option to select travel "to" and "from" by clicking on location points on the map
---
* Added the city of Darnassus and paths to travel to it
---
* Changed map location tooltips to show on hover instead of on click
---
* Added better visuals for druid-only travel
---
* Added larger icons for capital cities
---
* Added arrows to show direction of travel on paths
---
* Added some notes on travel items and spells
---
* Bug fixes around calculating the shortest routes
---
* Changed boat / zeppelin times to 2min 30 seconds (subject to change once EU can join the next stress test or just wait till release)
---
* Lots of internal changes and improvements that enables all this stuff!
---
**Future**
---
* Few of the ideas I have for next releases:
---
* Dungeon / Raid locations and travel to them
---
* Add horde quest that teleports you from Booty Bay to Gnomeregan
---
* Map coordinates of travel locations
---
* Map legend
---
Let me know if you find bugs, I'm writing this solo so I'll miss stuff :\]
---
Hunter's min range even without moving is insanely large, you can stand outside of frost nova range (10 yards) and still not be able to shoot because you are too close.
---
HoT’s do stack but not as between players. Also, HoTs will overwrite other HoTs depending on their rank and special modifiers like Druid Tier 8.
---
His head. So disregard
---
&gt; First off, this entire process is so convoluted and time consuming that it wouldn’t be worth it. 
---
You really, _really_ underestimate people. If it can be exploited, someone will find a way to do it on an industrial scale.
---
Maybe it’s great for you. It’s not great for the people who doesn’t speak German, French, Spanish nor Italian. I don’t spam in my native language since it’s excluding and annoying for the people who doesn’t understand.
---
&gt;Resilience (split pve and PvP gear entirely)
---
Feral tank /sunglasses
---
Did you play rogue?
---
I'd hate to play wow with a 400 ms ping. Combat would be jerky and unresponsive.
---
Which is more far-removed from Vanilla, a 10k pop server or the ability to fade into the mist mid-world pvp? This is absurd. This isn’t vanilla WoW.
---
Yeah, as a French player I have to agree. I'm always sad to see our reputation online and most of the time I just don't tell anyone where I come from. But remember that not all of us are like this.
---
I will be playing in English, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to roll on a French server to communicate more easily or an English server just to avoid other French players. I guess Blizzard just made the decision for me!
---
You farm 60s at lvl 20? oO
---
I wonder how many people are salty this guy got "beta" and they didnt.
---
as someone who always played on german servers i disagree.
---
Content and overall impressions of the game are not the same thing.  Even if they were, why would it me necessary for me to give a total score?  Even if I did, the result is meaningless unless you think each scale should have equal value.  Not everyone cares about leveling, raiding, and PvP in equal measure.
---
Seriously blizzard, between this and layering, if you fuck this up....
---
No, you treat it exactly like layering with only one name per server group. Only one bob on hellacream 1 or 2. When you merge no one will lose any names. Layering is literally constant servers opening and merging so making them permanent and merging them when needed only fixes the abuse
---
I'll gladly take new players over anyone such as yourself.
---
Can’t pick between Rogue &amp; Druid
---
Germans use dd (damage dealer) instead of dps for some reasons.
---
Neither do i
---
LOL the music.  Definitely a vanilla wow vid!
---
“Ion, some random person on the subreddit said not to invite all the retail f*ggots” “Yes I agree, this will surely please the shareholders and sate the one person on the subreddit”
---
Okay, Alexensual.
---
Your personal experience is anecdotal and not at all relevant.
---
Paying for entertainment, what a scam!
---
I can kind of understand why the big wigs don't want it to dwarf BFA though, there isn't a cash shop in classic which means less money for them. The more people move to classic the fewer people are playing retail and spending money in their cash shop
---
There's no bad publicity my friend.
---
Found the most ridiculous post of the day. Congrats
---
I’ll pay for innerspace (ISBoxer) but only because a lot of work has actually gone in to it as far as guiding you through set up.  Otherwise, I’d write a script in AutoHotKey to broadcast 1 through = and a few others so you can do things like make your buddy follow you, heal you, etc.
---
or not
---
If you can't switch layers and they're permanent, there's nothing that differentiates layers from full blown servers. Merging said layers is the same as merging servers.
---
I was on Burning Blade too in vanilla! Alliance side
---
not saying it is. just said i disagree
---
Quests and items are handled by their id and the client interprets it into a link.
---
Oh man, this is something where we need to let Blizzard know that this is not a good thing to do. With Server Limits being lower than on Nostalrius this can not end well. While I personally have no issue in talking english, there's certain countries who are VERY proud of their respective local language and it quite honestly just sucks ending up in a party with such people. Suddenly Tank and Healer speak english but the DPS just communicate in their own language - that's not fun for anyone.
---
Furthermore I fully believe that there's enough players for AT LEAST one Realm of each type (PvP, PvE, RP) for any of the big non-english speaking languages, namely Spanish, French and German. I see absolutely no reason to not give each of those languages at least one server to join. They'll notice fast enough that one server won't even be remotely enough for the game...
---
You think general will be layered but it hasn't been in stress test or beta.
---
Who are these people casually dropping in along with their main sub that they are going take Classic seriously enough to be worth upending the entire design philosophy for?
---
Seems are fair amount of streamers are Alliance. And I'll be rolling on a PVP server. My windfury howls for their skulls.
---
I love you but you are wrong and have been kicked out of the hunter inner circle
---
Exactly what you asked. A study on tauren hitbox, melee range and deadzone relative to other races and in-game playable models such as animal transformations.
---
&gt; ou are actually lucky enough to have english servers
---
English has been the unofficial language of the Internet ( and pretty much the Western world ) forever. How am I lucky? It's common sense.
---
I don't want to land on a server full of people who can't or refuse to speak English.
---
Ah , so this is an inadvertent frost nova buff. Damn mages buffed again!
---
First few weeks is way too long
---
Have you ever played with germans? They're really annoying in most games. Sorry if I'm being rude, just wanted to give an honest answer
---
Garrisons - bad.  
---
I liked racking up free money for logging in once a day and letting MasterPlan do the work for me but I don't think they were good for the game
---
Don't you guys have google translate?
---
My oldest daughter drives me to my football games 🤣
---
I agree, even though Redridge is still early enough to be a complete clusterfuck.
---
EU servers will be the most toxic place on planet earth. GJ Blizz!
---
I'll believe that when blizz finally give us the Dance Studio.
---
lol ya I can't vote for this one, mainly because I started like 2 weeks into TBC and essentially quite after Wrath, minus a stint in CATA, private servers since.
---
The economy is definitely going to be damaged without changes to the layering mechanic and minimizing that is foolhardy
---
Children’s cartoons are dubbed Dutch in Netherlands tho... but yeah, apart from that it’s all subtitled.
---
Gotta sell those server transfers somehow.
---
I put garrisons in cut content because its only half of what it was supposed to be if that
---
A lot of people disagree with Blizzard's decision, doesn't mean it isn't happening.
---
I thought it was against ToS, but i did have two accounts and dual boxed back in vanilla and TBC. Never heard anything from a GM about it and most people that did say the same.
---
Lol I absolutely cannot wait for Classic to destroy BFA.
---
Brexit, Boris and now Bratwurst. These are dark times we live in
---
To me this is the exact same reasoning for spell batching, neither should be there
---
&gt;Thanks
---
It's a somewhat passionate discussion and I don't want to make you feel like I disrespect you or your opinion mate. 
---
&gt; If the weakest link is so bad it literally
---
But that's subjective, mate. 
---
I can SOMEHOW see how your approach can be relevant in some rating communities, but at the end of the day if I want to decide whether a product is for me, I need to have an insight into it that considers everything and not just one single aspect. That aspect may be paramount for you but totally neglectable for others. I hated MoPs chinese flavour (I love the art style in general, it just didn't fit wow) and the childish humor throughout made me vomit. But I still enjoyed it a lot because gameplay and amount of content are much more important to me. So to me, the expansion was much better than WoD, which had an awesome art direction but lacked content.
---
&gt;Reviews are personal opinions, there is no such thing as objectivity even from professional paid reviewers.
---
I REALLY REALLY hate this sentiment, though. There are ways to approach things objectively. 100% objective truth? Hard for us to see. Approaches that are aware of subjective biases and try to steer around them? Absolutely possible and a trademark for a good journalism.
---
The whole "there is no objective..." argument is really just an excuse for being lazy. What good is your subjective opinion to ANYONE? Now if you were famous and I knew your works and opinions on other stuff and could use that to know whether I'll like something that you like, that's different (which is why influencers work. They build trust, you look for one that thinks as you do and then trust t hat you'll like what they like) but you (no offense) are nobody to me. I don't know you. Why should I give a single shit about your subjective opinion? For all I know your taste is fucking horrible. So what does it tell me if you liked something or not? Nothing at all.
---
Hence why I think it's important to go with a more nuanced approach, where you don't just say "MoP was shit" but rather "I didn't like MoP, because Art direction is very important to me and the Art direction MoP chose [chinese art style, childish humor] did not appeal to me at all. If you like that art direction, however, the other aspects of the expansion were very solid and you might really like it."
---
&gt;For me: Story&gt;Art&gt;Gameplay&gt;Music.
---
Just including that in a review makes it so much more useful to people who don't know you. It's hilarious that rating sites don't split their rating in such categories anyways. I mean this conversation is just more evidence that this makes sense, because different folks place importance on different stuff.
---
I guess I'm asking too much of a reddit post. But I hope you can at least understand where I'm coming from.
---
&gt;I can appreciate that you liked Kung-Fu Pandas
---
Please stop saying that. I enjoyed the gameplay and the amount of content that was relevant to me. I HATED the expansion thematically and I feel insulted by you constantly insinuating otherwise. It's kinda aggravating.
---
do you honestly think that response was anyone's version of being 'riled up'?
---
Yep. I don’t like sharding or layering either. Personally, I hope we can at least reach a compromise like OP mentions. Layer the bottlenecked areas towards the start of the game, so newcomers can be happy, but keep (at least) 30 onward completely together as one world.
---
I have all my keys binded, Pet included.. what are you even talking about?  Also Key bindings =/ Macro
---
Do you really think people are not binding their keys and the hundred of bug reports for the pets are because of it? good one.
---
I wonder whose the clicker here lol
---
I’m sure that many of your fellow countrymen will. The environment will be toxic...
---
Dont care still gonna roll druid!
---
&gt; My idea is a lot better than what is currently implemented.
---
Yeah, you can just say that. I can also just say that layering is better for the game than your proposed solution. 
---
&gt;What?
---
Gamers aren't game developers. Blizzard doesn't give a shit what you think a good solution is. Most of the time, players come up with ideas that sound great on paper but are just unrealistic, impossible, etc. It is on them to come up with solutions that fit within their design philosophies. The best thing to do is document issues with what tech they *will* be using (they are not going to change from layering, its dumb to even begin to think they are going to do such a drastic change this close to launch) so that they may be addressed.
---
wtf does this even say.
---
Sure, but then you can have a more even-handed approach. If *most* realms settle into a comfortable medium, you can then work on the remaining outliers the way they did back in 2006: queues and free transfers. Sure, tryhards committed to a "Full" server will grind out the queue, but I can totally see people taking the free ticket to a different realm early in the release cycle. 
---
Plus, there are always people like me who will most likely sit this thing out for a few weeks/month post-release to give the initial rush time to die the hell down and make a more informed decision.
---
Experienced mage from vanilla never let melee get that close. Open with frost nova. If you have a little server lag, snare with Cone of Cold to slow, create distance, wand the totem and THEN frost nova when the opponent in range. The slow makes the ranging more accurate. You did this because missing with your frost nova was potentially fatal and you losing your shatter bonus is never ideal.
---
hotkeynet just launches two versions of wow and copies your keybinds between games. It's quite simple if you want to dabble in duo boxing.
---
&gt; Removing is a nerf to 95% of mobs in the game. This is a massive change.
---
I believe leeway only comes into play with player characters no?
---
yes, everyone is entitled to his opinion and that is what reddit is for. However what you said about only english getting their server is factually wrong because none of the servers are english servers
---
I just think low effort shitposts(like yours) are unhealthy for the sub as a whole.
---
Wow fuck seriously? This is absolutely terrible! I was so much looking forward to have this language separation. What I experienced on servers that should not be named was horrible. 
---
Please Blizzard, don‘t do this to us!
---
Otherwise we‘ll have to organize and we‘ll make the splitting ourselves.

36 chef here, wow addict! Don’t let those thoughts get you down.

Having fun is never a waste of time. The opposite is.
---
If they're not going to do dynamic spawns, then i think i agree.  Layering is not desirable, but neither is sitting there in the middle of a troll camp waiting for spawns to kill.  A troll camp that would normally wipe you and your group easily if not for the zerg of players camping them.  
---
I remember N-dale launch well and dynamic spawning really did work.  Sure it had its own problems like good luck getting those four crates in the cave of death with mobs literally re spawning as soon as they died.  The result was a total clusterf#ck, but it was a fun one.  
---
Sitting around waiting for trolls to spawn last night was NOT fun.  If layering is the only solution Blizzard will consider, then so be it.  Just stop using it ASAP once the launch day rush dies down.
---
Fuck. I'm starting to think you're right. Every server I've pinged has either been LA or Chicago.
---
Which is still good for UK players at an average ping of ~84, but damn.
---
I’ve played on Vanilla launches much larger than the amount of players than there will be on an official Classic server, and it was a blast. Did quests take longer? Yes. But so what. The world felt lively. I got to make friends and chat. I got to see the same people leveling for days straight. That’s what an immersive world is all about.
---
&gt; The biggest vanilla pserver has somewhere around 10k players
---
Yes, and on average a game has about 10-15 times as many players as there are online. Or did you think that when Ndale has 10k players online, it means a total of ten thousand individual human beings are players of that server? I mean, I *hope* that's not what you said but it kind of sounded like it.
---
When LH released their one-year statistics, they had about 300k **active** accounts (1.5 mil total). While you can make accounts for free on private servers, most players only have one active account, and almost nobody has more than two. It's pretty reasonable to assume that Ndale alone has about 100k individual players.
---
And that's one server. While not many servers are as big as that one, there's quite a lot of them. If you rounded up the entire community - including the ones on TBC and WotLK, who will almost certainly try Classic - I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being upwards of half a million players.
---
If you think a bunch of those will stay on private servers because it's free, I think you're silly. Some of the bigger ones have already announced that they're shutting down when Classic launches.
---
Solution: at level x you are put onto layer 1. Everyone else.is spread accross layers 2 and up.
---
x is whatever rhe community would want.
---
I was doing that last night with my priest, hit with hammer was faster than Smite cast time :)
---
Old school flex.
---
By essentially playing as 2 players you have an advantage, an advantage that you bought with money.
---
As someone that had their main on a dead server I can't agree more. It was just sad getting to lvl 50+ after months of playing and realizing that there was maybe 1 raiding guild, on the opposite faction and just no one to group with to do dungeons. I had to start over on a fresh server just to experience the end game.
---
Accurate!
---
I doubt it, this doesn't happen on private servers who are equally international, except for guild recruitment macros in trade chat.
---
Yes, but the EU only recognizes 24 of them. And apparently when it comes to Classic, Blizzard only recognizes one of them.
---
Only have to be 74+ to be Silent Generation
---
I mean... what do you do against triple ambush?
---
https://youtu.be/XEIwYKWShjM
---
Yes. I don't watch streamers at all but came home a week or so ago and my roommate was watching Soda/Asmon and when they open their mailboxes it's literally flooded with gear/potions/gold. I was so surprised because items in classic are much harder to get than their modern counterpart, but people want to be noticed I suppose.
---
Merging dude
---
I imagine a big problem not mentioned enough is the fact that most people who will be playing are a lot older now than they used to be. This means more fixed schedules and less flexibility for raiding. This will also be a problem. We're not all teenagers who can stay up until 2 am most nights anymore lol.
---
I think we might be a good fit for each other. I'd love a chance to speak with you on your classic plans. Hmu at wildgunmen#1302 on bnet any time.
---
Imagine not knowing what a tilde key is.
---
Yeap, if you just used english language clients on your games and say windows for a decade of gaming you'd learn the language without much effort.
---
1st it's Naxx, not Max (that one is pretty hilarious I must say) and no I didn't reach rank 14 ... but nice try lol  
---
Again you have no idea what you're talking about
---
fyi, French Canadians will also have their unofficial NA server but most of us tend to use English in public channels and we're just a drop in the ocean numbers wise.
---
Thanks man. I'm not unsympathetic to people who feel like the OP feels. I'd rather not have layering either, but making shortsighted decisions is bad for everyone in the long run, and I think there are other things people can expend their attention on related to classic.
---
It would have to have over 3 million subscriptions for that to happen. Not a chance.
---
try naming a character something like burgerking? if the naming filter is working, titles like that wont work
---
I‘m absolutely fine with this. I speak German, English, French and Spanish and will simply play whereever i land in the end. Everybody else who only speaks one language will habe to gather up with likeminded people.
---
If its low lvl gear you're gonna replace, ride it out till almost red. But of course this doesn't apply for later levels. It doesn't save a whole lot but every bit adds up. And by all means im not saying run around in broken gear, if you need to repair it do it, but basically dont just hit that repair icon cause you see it lit up.
---
Or, hear me out, Germans play Dwarves, French play Night Elves, Gnomes are played by Spaniards and "common" is English             
---
             
---
BOOM RP through the fucking roof!
---
Are upvotes considered downvotes here?
---
They had two servers up. Two.
---
I guess it must be common for horde not to know what a tilde key is xD
---
I don't know if they can do layering by zone, but maybe they can do layering by level?
---
Players 1-20 are spread across max number of layers. 20-30 across fewer layers, etc until 50-60 is only 1 layer.
---
It won’t. Account sharing is bannable. Streamers don’t get special treatment in that regard if you look back to reckful getting banned for it when he was a top wow streamer, won multiple official blizzard pvp tournaments, and was just a general pvp legend.
---
If they ban someone who participated in official events for trying out a new class on someone’s account imagine what they would do to some streamer that probably shit talks retail wow daily that is actively trying to take away experiences from other people on other realms.
---

Ur not fooling anybody
---
Fair enough, I was not sure it worked that way in classic
---
how is this any different than the other posts with exactly the same idea, that also go down voted to oblivion?
---
What differentiates them is that this group of servers is made with the intention to merge them. Only one name per group and so on. It literally is layering without the abuse. Basically just make it where you can pick which layer you are on and you can not change that.
---
Coffee. Bagels. My fiancee knows my excitement for classic, and she definitely will be making me some nice meals the first couple days.
---
I'm pretty sure that doesn't work. It will always try to cast Riposte but fail, and won't move on to Sinister Strike.
---
dude moved on from this review, to go and make Bastion. respect.

Fun fact: perception + paranoia ( felhunter ability)  increases stealth detection range so much that anything outside vanish can be seen at like 20-30 yards away.

[chuckles in shaman]
---
Unless their speed leveling strat includes logging into the game an hour before launch it won't matter.
---
and then they will have to deal with a clusterfuck of server merges down the road. This solution makes launch better, but will fuck people over later.
---
Each to their own. I just can’t grasp the idea of it all... I don’t understand why people now a days want to watch people play games instead of actually playing it. I have young family members who watch streamers all the time instead of playing an actual game.  I understand we can’t quite play classic yet and I guess watching them might help some people with the agonising wait for the actual release.... and who knows maybe even donate money to them.
---
As long as we can filter chat it should be ok. Even though I guess General_Eng will trigger a lot of people! :D
---
It seems like the current form of Blizzard are able to destroy anything they put their hands on. That’s impressive.
---
Somebody needs to respond to you with a shocked pikachu meme: shove a bunch of players into starting zones to intentionally overload the servers, not enough boars..

Not for Ony/Nef because they have stated no layering in Capitol citys
---
I also noticed that some of your comment is blue and apparently random and I just wanted to let you know that you might have a virus, good luck 👌👌🙏🏻✝️🤛
---
Back in vanilla, you'd actually not get the pet in the mailbox. There would be an NPC right at the starting zone with a quest for you to complete, and upon completion you could chose either the panda, zergling or diablo. (You could only have one on your character, you'd have to make alts if you wanted the other two, as well).

Jealousy has nothing to do with it.  It’s just a general annoyance when someone like Logan Paul moves in next door, throws parties every night and drives a car in to a pool.  
---
I care less about the streamers than I do the general streamer culture, where people watching have to be as annoying about it as possible because these internet cult figures elicit money and attention from their followers who then do bizarre missionary work to try and show their devotion to some guy who noticed them once and said hi in front of a bunch of people.
---
Well since mounts aren't till 40 you don't have to worry about that. and there are many other talents id rather put those 2 points into if i had them free'd up because of a boot enchant.

Pro tip: there is a setting to show you name over your character in game. Nice for screenshots like this so even the person taking it has their name show up =)

There's something really exciting about meeting a level 2 tauren player in Mulgore and then weeks later running into them again in Dire Maul. Like, "hey, haven't we met before?'

Yeah we get it, it's a joke.

1. My joke didn't work if that's a tilde key.
---
2. Why would you prefer a tilde key over an ESC key when designing a keyboard for WoW?

&gt; WoD was THE WORST expansion by far. Just because BFA is fresh in your memory doesn't mean it's worse than WoD.
---
I played WoD quite a lot, I quit BfA 2 weeks in because it was just that terrible. The leveling was fun but EXTREMELY short. I don't like the dungeons, I HATE my class design, I HATE how unviable my main spec was at launch, I hate mission tables (which are STILL in the game after 2 expansions of people complaining about it), I hate the Azerite pendant (it's a very boring replacement for artifacts) and Azerite gear was complained about a ton as well.
---
To be fair, I quit very early after clearing M dungeons twice basically. There's a real possibility that the game improved since then. But to me that's inconsequential as the start was SO shit that I quit immediately with 0 desire to return. In WoD I played for much longer, because stuff was at least fun. WoD lacked content for non raiders, but at least the Dungeons were fun, the Garrison gave me something to do before it turned into a golden cage, Draenor was beautiful (shadowmoon &lt;3) and I had lots of incentive to level my alts up.
---
BfA just drove me away so hard. I enjoyed nothing about it. Even the leveling was not that great, worst so far possibly, as I have never felt shittier. Leveling in BfA was straight up getting weaker, evident by the fact that 115s could easily kill 120s. My char lost tons of crit and never regained it, crit being the stat that makes fire mages playable. I lost legendary effects, all my Artifact passives... and got the shitty azerite gear.
---
Island expeditions are terribly shitty as well. It's like scenarios in MoP. I hated those and I hate Island expeditions. Stupid as hell "content".
---
Let's not talk about the failure that warmode was (still is? dunno)
---
Sorry but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that I am right in my assessment. BfA sucked. Hard. Again, maybe it's better now, but when it launched it was the worst shit expansion I have ever played. Everything felt terrible.
---
Ideally layering would just be in the first 2 zones and deactivated entirely in contested zones like STV, but from the sounds of it layering is done continent wide so if you turn it on for the barrens then it gets turned on for ungoro as well.
---
Just because they can only get a few jumps and nodes doesn’t mean it’s any less detrimental.  This isn’t a this vs that argument. We can have our cake and eat it too. Pretending that “a couple layer jumps” isn’t a serious problem means we’re setting a precedent that abuse of the system is okay as long as it’s done only a few times.
---
Nothing compares with a civilized UK citizen who can't speak or write properly. Ah, civilization.

The age-old question was always "is it faster to get a port to UC and fly to Kargath, or wait for the zepelin to STV and fly from there"
---
Will this have zeppelin timers?
---
I was in a serious raiding guild and sometimes even for us we didn’t have enough people. We would just find whatever we needed in world chat. Ringers are always easy to find. You just have to switch up how looting goes because most guilds use different types of loot distribution. Yes it was on a private server, but let’s face it. This is the way it’s done now adays.
---

Horde\*
---
It's the same for me and I'm Dutch. I absolutely hate speaking Dutch online. Hell, if I find out one of my online friends speaks Dutch I'd rather continue talking English with them.
---
I guess it's mostly because I'm used to speaking exclusively English online (seeing as every single game is in English and barely 0.1% are in Dutch or have Dutch translations avaiable). That, and the fact that Dutch sucks balls to be honest. We still use English terms all the time (and swear words).
---
If someone is coming to you with some greens to DE then yeah it should be tipped, just like a rogue opening a lockbox. Though it should be said that DE'ing doesn't have that much value in vanilla. Typically BoE items vendor for just slightly less than the avg. DE value. Here's the value I calculated on a pserver as a sample https://i.imgur.com/aymCQkL.png  I made this sheet because knowing if it was worth DE'ing was actually challenging.
---
For dungeons it's different though. Dungeon blues generally DE for more unless they are weapon/shield. Usually it's customary at least on pserver for a enchanter to announce himself and needing on loot none needs to DE it and then shard it and roll the shards out after the dungeon, with no tips.
---
On second thought. Retreat!
---
Bad financial decision. They want to keep players not scare them away
---
Plot twist, he's blind
---
&gt; I'll be able to easily circumvent it or it'll be massively damaging to the game itself.
---
You people just say that. You can just say a lot of things. Go back to twitch
---
yeah, see you in 'Max'ramas kid hahaha
---
I suggest you start wanting to pvp cuz this game is all about it
---
Right now layering works in the exact same way as sharding and is abusable in the same way. Blizzard hasnt commented once on all the problems that have been found out in the recent weeks.
---
If you focus on getting your BiS stuff at 60, you will definitely have many opportunities to PUG with a guild that's looking for a few more people to fill out their raid.  I remember it was a bit of a struggle getting 40 together.  I mean, we did it and got through AQ, but it was a pain in the A.  All it takes is one or two key members to have a sick kid (especially now that we're older) or a late night at work and that's GG.  
---
I really do think that if you make it a point to befriend a handfull of members in a handfull of raiding guilds, you'll be able to get in on the fun.  Granted, the really hard core guilds won't let you in or will simply never let you get loot.  With those guilds that are almost there, but not quite there to the point where they can consistently get 40, you'll be able to get in.  Just make sure they are willing to add you to their looting system whichever system that may be.
---
Oh no! Not the casuals!
---
Maybe I'm thinking of their original sharding plan.
---
This looks fun as fuck. Just need to find 2 more nerds that are taking week 1 off.

I'm one of the last people to invoke #no-changes but this is blizzlike and was such till WotLK(?), he's not even refuting that.

It's really weird that it works in pvp combat, even in BFA you can't change shards through invites while in PVP combat with War Mode.
---
We'll see. You're all in for a rude awakening lmao.
---
why would I want to work at blizzard? I work as an indie game dev already as a hobby, its just a side thing, but it brings in some extra cash and its fulfilling.
---
Step 1. Create a server named A
---
Step 2. Decide on A's population cap
---
Step 3. Instead of creating A, create servers A-1 and A-2.
---
Step 4. A-1 and A-2 share the same database. Meaning a taken name on A-1 cannot be created on A-2. A-1 and A-2 each have half the population cap of A. 
---
Step 5. Whenever Blizzard wants to, A-1 and A-2 are merged back together seemlessly as server A.
---
Well, neither will this.
---
Because there's a massive amount of hype behind the game due to how long people have been asking for it, the amount of large streamers who will be playing it on launch and the seemingly brilliant reception from so many retail content creators who originally doubted it like Preach which will absolutely peak the interest of retail players who'd normally not care for classic. On top of that they can play it for free as it comes as part of their retail subscription so there's literally no reason for them to not check it out on release. 
---
Lets say we have the generic 2.5-3k player cap per realm with no layering technology present at launch. You then run a very high risk of choosing a realm that has lots of short term players who have no interest in playing in the longrun who then all up and leave once the hype dies down and they decide that the game isn't for them leaving you with a less than healthy community. If you start with layering on the other hand then you can get double to player base in at the start  which will counteract the initial drop off in players and insure that all realms are alive and kicking well into the content life cycle.

You can't relaunch a game with traditionally fucked economics and not expect extra-fucked economics.

This is going to be ugly. Especially since the major languages will create unofficial servers anyway. Why not make them official in the beginning?

Was this something they came back and said recently? I had only heard that it will be around for phase 1.

this
---
TL;DR
---
&gt;People only exploit layering a couple times, it's not like sharding

Have played on fresh private server launches with 10K+ people on server, it was so busy people were camping one mobs respawn spot. Slightly frustrating at times but I would much prefer it to layering bullshit.

---
People distrust ion but yet him being lead design led to one of the most liked raids since Ulduar in ToT.
---
don't let them discourage you friend, we both know you are right. There will not be more than 8 servers per region, no way.
---
Yeah, especially in a game with a 400ms heartbeat.
---
I think its only going to be a handful of realms max for EU/NA and I think its the right decision with layering in place. People on this sub tend to overestimate how many people will keep playing after launch hype has worn off.
---
This will absolutely happen.
---
Yes, and on average a game has about 10-15 times as many players as there are online. Or did you think that when ND has 10k players online, it means a total of ten thousand individual human beings are players of that server? I mean, I *hope* that's not what you said but it kind of sounded like it.
---
When Light's Hope released their one-year statistics, they had about 300k **active** accounts (active within 100 days). While you can make accounts for free on private servers, most players only have one active account, *maybe* two. It's pretty reasonable to assume that ND alone has about 100k individual players. And that's currently active, plenty more are former players who will return to Classic.
---
Just get summoned by a warlock
---
You really don't see how that makes the community shittier for everyone ? In a game where the community is 50% of the reason the game is great.
---
I really don't see any advantages of not having national servers, only disadvantages.
---
And you're proud of that? LOL.
---
Classic is going to wipe the floor with that loot pinata garbage it's inevitable.
---
Maybe with shit like this blizzard will see how stupid sharding and layering is... Such a joke of a system
---
Fair enough! I've got an alliance guild lined up for Classic so it seems I will have to pick a main side and then level and alt on the other side.
---
With the amount of posts out there arguing why they don't want layering, it's mind boggling how you were able to completely miss their arguments and build up your own strawman about the issue.

While you can make accounts for free on private servers, most players only have one active account, *maybe* two. It's pretty reasonable to assume that ND alone has about 100k individual players. And that's currently active, plenty more are former players who will return to Classic.
---
Man I remember realizing that horde were actually people in LK.
---
This is a very fair point I have seen multiple clips of layering as an exploit or bug and does present an issue. However, come opening week if they were to not implement some sort of way to allow appropriate mob spawns for the population, it's going to leave a very sour taste at a very critical time for audience rentention. I am sure it will be fine come release. Blizzard might do dumb shit but they know how to write code for the most part.
---
Literally everyone knows there will be a massive 50%+ dropoff after the first month or two.  That's not controversial at all, nor is it the point of this post.
---
How do you live with yourself then?
---
Uhh, is this basically shards?  I thought this was supposed a recreation of vanilla wow...    
---
So like I'll be able to use people to invite me for multiple gathering/chests/whatever in different actual worlds?    
---
And we'll miss out on seeing the same names while leveling up?  Because we're basically in different instances of the world map?  Doing some quests with some guy at like level 16 then seeing him randomly and grouping for something at level 40?  What about open world pvp rivalries?  Looks like garbage tbh.
---
From my understanding skinning usually won't get you too much money until Devilsaurs. If you want a gathering profession that will make you money I would recommend Herbalism for straight money or Mining to both sell and use for your own progression.   
---
That being said. The problem is that with it being a brand new game basically with everyone at level 1 most common items may be sold for larger amounts of money than what it would be on pservers/retail making most auction house selling all speculations. Do what you think is fun but be warned Engineering is an expensive profession so you will be putting a lot of your mount money into buying mats if you can't gather them yourself.
---
I smell racist scumbag
---
Yep. You cant release a game twice. They are rereleasing a solved game. This experience is not going to be anything like wow was at launch. Similarities sure, but the nostalgia goggles are unreal here.

---
They do these every week.
---
Why do you care about wool cloth? It’s an infinite resource, no limit to how much can be farmed due to instancing.
---
Yea how many layers are the servers capable of creating??? We have no idea the plans for number of servers or what the population will be at launch to make broad assumptions like I can level on boars by just walking outside northshire Abby so we don't need layering is Fucking absurd.
---
Think less of those typing them, obviously.
---
&gt; y’all
---
everyone who's not me is the same!
---
way back in beta forsaken were considered unread but never in retail
---
Modern English begain in the late 1300's.
---
England didn't have a queen until 1553.
---
You honestly expect stable server populations months after an aging gaming base remembers how tedious early 2000s MMORPGs were? 
---
We have time between now and August for an experiment: go back and play one of the Everquest progression servers that just opened up. Stick with it for 2 months. I dare you.
---
Lol @ the fact you think Venruki isnt an experienced mage.
---
heard on an interview they’re using new names. 
---
Smart, honestly, because it prevents confusion when you refer to Tichondrius - did they mean BFA Tichondrius or Classic Tichondrius? I know the decision will likely not be popular.
---
Then your level 16 gets pulled into the higher level layer ofc.
---
&gt;Server identity and seeing the same people as you level up is critical to the success of classic. The way layering is currently implemented will be more hurtful than helpful. 
---
Is this really a thing people got in classic? I played vanilla at release and I remember nobody, outside my guild, up until I hit 60.  
---
All your server reputations are gained and earned at max level. Bucksworth the rogue that ninja looted two boss drops and said "you got bucksworth'd". Rankyrogue who said retard is u stick paper on forehead, axxle the rogue bitching about how he's a god at PvP and nobody wants to 1v1 him.
---
&gt; request group are changes and they are great changes infact needed IMO 
---
Request group is a pretty bad QoL change as it directly removes social interaction.
---
lol Max
---
The big p.server had something like 100k active accounts, and you had to pirate it. I don't actually think we will hit 1million active players post-hype phase but it's certainly possible.
---
That’s because autohotkey has a lot more capability than just what it does for multiboxing. It’s perfectly fine to use as long as 1 key press = 1 action. It could be used in ways that get you banned if you use it in ways that are against the rules, for instance you press P on your keyboard and it runs a script that starts your dps rotation and your 1 key press made your character cast 4 spells
---
I want Classic to succeed, but I'm not so delusional to think that it's going to have more players than Vanilla did.
---
The answer to all of your questions is yes.
---
Pause right when he gets hit and look how far away that Tauren is.  That leeway is brutal.
---
Yessss bro
---
Is this an out if season..
---
Are they serious? I mean here we all speak relatively good English, but not enough. Take a Spaniard, frenchie, EINEN DEUTSCHEN, and some guy from Sweway and put them in the same realm, group, zone. This isn't a good idea.
---
Sure, there will be "German" servers, for example, but new players won't know that. A new french player will start the game, choose a cool sounding player and be greeted with pure Nordic language?
---
Reconsider, please.
---
The scream was delicious!
---
Isn't it already the case tho?
---
It’s not my fault you got a virus don’t be mad at me! It’s probably from googling one too many times
---
I mean if you really did get beta you should test it with the rest of us. But I bet you just got the stress test. 
---
Even so log on and jump around. Play with the character creation screen. Log in, kill a boar and log out. The more testers we get the better chance of fixing bugs before it goes live. WoW is just as much the communities game as it is Blizzards.
---
There's a god tier Mind Control location for Alliance priests near the Horde flight path in Felwood that basically forces Horde to take rez sickness or take a ghost run through Darkshore, Ashenvale, and most of Felwood. Got banned on two separate occasions for doing that.
---
Got to bitch about something
---
No, we are not looking for a guild.
---
The only answer we have suggests strongly that layering will be implemented for months, until phase 2 begins.
---
Yes I have, next question please.
---
If you were even remotely on to something Blizzard would shut off layering in a few weeks which is contradictory to the phase 2 statements. Layering is desired by retail BFA players that didn't actually play vanilla.
---
...that's literally what Layering is
---
Hmm, Druid offers some flexibility with several different specs &amp; roles, however Rogues are really fun and OP :D Sounds like a bit of a hard decision :P
---
Fair enough lmao
---
I'm not discouraged. This just means more people will get to apologize to me on August 12th/13th.
---
then give me 1 example where it can't be.
---
Not that experienced in vanilla I presume? I don't know him, but it seems like he haven't got the routines down quite right yet. He seems like a talented player though, I'm sure he will get there.
---
German is potentially the only language in EU which might be able to sustain a healthy server pop. So make distinct german servers and shove everyone else in English speaking ones? Doesnt seem to fair to me.
---
You get the point though... and it's not as if Blizzard invented the word phase or phasing.
---
Feral has good TPS, but it's awkward because pretty much all the single-target threat comes from Maul. If your Maul gets parried twice in a row, it's disaster as you generate basically no threat for a full five seconds. And boss parry chance is apparently almost tripled in Classic compared to pservers, so that's gonna be an issue.
---
LOL. I completely forgot about the space goats terminology for Draenei.
---
I see were you come from and I really agree with you.
---
However if you play warrior you must also be aware that leveling will be slower. 
---
However I don't care for server first and stuff like that, and consider leveling time one of the most enjoyable experiences in classic, so I don't see much of an issue that warrior is slower than other classes and min maxing is in my opinion overrated, I rather play a cool char to look at than a one with slightly better stats but a race I don't want to play.
---
And the wisp form is a great choice, I think I would go main warrior night elf and a bank twink. And maybe just for fun a shaman on a different server and only play it once a week or every 2 weeks a couple of hours to get the horde experience and shaman play style. (You could consider a PvE server with the shaman so you are not forced to fight your beloved alliance friend's)
---
&gt;Several
---
/r/Classicwow:
---
&gt;Several.. SEVERAL MEANS UNDER 10 OR 12,  EU HAS A POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S ROUGHLY 20% MORE THAN NA MEANING TOTAL WOW POP WILL BE ONLY 100K THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG
---
Thanks for the confirmation, I assumed so based on watching op's links but wanted to make sure, that really sucks.
---
Sure. Good luck out there.
---
I'd love to have the live zeppelin timers but I don't think I'd be able to get that data.
---
Yeah very difficult &amp; I’m going to DPS both no matter what I pick if that makes any difference. I don’t know much about Feral Druid’s but I’m pretty sure they’re still a viable option in classic
---
Absolutely terrible idea if you're looking to play with your friends and end up on different layers of the same realm.
---
True dat
---
No one claimed that. The claim was it's going to have more players than BFA. You're an idiot.
---
Undead NPC's. Plaadins have both single target and AoE spells that deal substantial damage to undead NPC's. Can't use it on players though.
---
Eh, rather they add servers later than remove them if there's too many in the beginning.
---
But you're only ever seeing people from your server. Eventually the tourists will quit - the people you met while first levelling will either have left or will be still there alongside you.
---
Lol dude you just disagreed with me. Are you trying to say you’re on the same side as me?
---
It did not have 10k players, it had 10k *concurrent* players. As in, at any given point in time, it had 10k online. It's active accounts numbered around 100k.
---
Classic costing money IS a barrier to entry that p.servers don't have, this is true. But they were not without their own barriers. A lot of people avoid privates because they don't want to download a sketchy client, or don't know how, or simply aren't aware that they exist. Which barrier to entry is bigger? We can only speculate right now.
---
meh ive seen this troll before
---
If you read more than the last sentence you would see that I said it was a problem and offered a solution. I'm saying making the layering even worse, i.e. sharding, is not a solution.
---
K1, K3, LH.
---
I've noticed that named mobs and quest items respawn much faster than on Pservers. Quest items are basically instant while Pservers had a 5+ minute timer.
---
Regular mobs is the opposite, but I'm not sure it will be that way at launch. Vanilla had dynamic respawning and the Beta doesn't. So that's a bug.
---
we had a 6 man raid take down a level 12 rare bear in dun morogh, we were around level 6 and it was amazing, no loot but worth it
---
The biggest thing to keep in mind is 1 button = 1 action. If you press a button and both characters jump, it's technically against ToS. If you press 1 button and your character performs several actions (outside of in-game macros) this is entirely against ToS.
---
I was thinking that the picture of Mulgore that is up there looks more like Devils Tower and surrounding area.
---
This was the line just before chaos erupted and everybody stood around the spawn point.
---
Must be a UK server.
---
It’s a good solution, but I love using layering to farm matts. Saves me tons of time.
---
Assuming when you move into a new layer your account sticks to that layer, and that it moves one of the accounts at random to the layer the other account is on then you'd never know what layer you would go to, and if your friend is on your layer forever, you cannot exploit any longer as your on the same layer. This is pretty nonviable as a consistent exploit.
---
&gt; It's laughable to not be able to communicate in English on a basic level in 2k19.
---
The French are still trying to become a superpower. Still trying and still failing.
---
You're thinking of exorcism
---
And then people downvote me when I say Blizzard may very well completely crew up Classic.
---
Over the past few months bad news like this has kept coming out. It slowly keeps adding up until you get an unfun, antisocial and completely non-vanillalike experience. This in particular will make socializing terrible if half your server can't understand you.
---
I'm not talking about the Beta when talking about EU not getting servers. They literally just announced that all of the EU is getting shoved onto the same realms. The only reason to do this is because there aren't going to be but a few realms.
---
Yeah but why would they do that? Businesses stay in business by making rational decisions and what would be rational about shutting down a Classic two days before launch?
---
I think maybe some people should take a break from following Classic news and return when it has launched.
---
I'd make them more hideous. I think they're far too pretty.
---
dont feel offended guys, im german too!    
---
(reupload because i typp'd the title)
---
I am sure you have found a home but if you are still searching id loved to discuss your plans for classic. Wildgunmen#1302 on bnet. Good luck out there.
---
I get what you are saying but, in the history of gaming. How many dead MMO's had so much interest. Private servers started popping up with hundreds of thousands of players. That shit is unprecedented. 
---
I will also say that classic wow is far more appealing to non-gamers and non-hardcore players. Retail really only appeals to hardcore MMORPG players and, Hardcore MMORPG players who are short on time.
---
Every part of classic demands you take it seriously. Yes it may be easier then the hardest parts of retail but, people who never even hit 60 in old classic loved it. Because no part of the game was treated like a joke or something to be burst through. Classic wow is like a good book thats great from start to finish. Retail wow is like a good series but, the first 3 books suck and you have to power through them. 
---
Once the leveling sucks, the non-heroic dungeons sucks, and everything else sucks until you "unlock" the real game. You will have lost most people.
---
Can someone remind me what layering is for if dynamic respawn and ques are still going to exist? The tourist bogeyman?
---
You clearly don't understand that they are "starting questing" right there.  They are waiting in queue to pick up a quest object.
---
No, because literally the top post on this sub is for a petition to turn layering into sharding. I think people need to speak against it. Loud people advocating for things like sharding are what ruined wow.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
&gt;I really don't see any advantages of not having national servers, only disadvantages.
---
What languages should get their own servers? German is the most spoken language in EU and its not even clear they could sustain a healthy population. French/Spanish/Italian make even less sense. In the end all you achieve is split the community and servers will die out over time so you have no community at all.
---
It will be popular enough to keep a dozen servers going for quite a while. I'm definitely not worried there will be a lack of players.
---
A million seems a bit high to me, but I'm terrible at gambling so I wouldn't put money against it.
---
Nah, usually when I *do* take the effort to type it out, I tend to get upvotes and at least someone saying "Oh yeah I guess that would work". I'm not suggesting doing nothing at all, but I'll admit I'd still prefer nothing at all over layering.
---
They know how many subscribers they had. They know how many subscribers they have. They know how many subscribers private wow servers have. Exactly how many people they may have at launch and at what rate they'll leave may be a little fuzzy, but they probably have a very good idea of how many people will stick around for the long haul.
---
Prior to sharding and cloud computing, the available option was merging servers. Merging servers will fuck the game economy (and to an extent, raid progression) harder than any layering. Layering is a dynamic solution they can adjust on the fly, and it doesn't throw the bank alt out with the bath water. Some extra flasks/gold/devilsaur leather aren't going to break anything near as much as the alternatives. And WoW's economy was fucked from the start thanks to gold farmers anyway -- if it's not out of whack, it will seem out of whack.
---
You can't cast healing spells on enemies.
---
However, Exorcism is a single-target spell and Holy Wrath is an AoE spell. They both are only usable on undead and demons and they  deal holy damage.
---
Bro your account is 3 days old, you're not a very good troll.
---
Correct, when two players are both moving
---
I'm not basing it off opinions, I'm basing it off numbers and Blizzard's own announcements.
---
I think your 'super' key has autism :(
---
I just said to not quest. I said to grind. Did you read my comment before responding to it?
---
As someone who's experienced the launch of nearly every fresh Blizzlike x1 Vanilla pserver, it is undoubtedly a clusterfuck in the starting zones. Forming groups to camp 1 boar spawn or the quest item you need for the Warlock imp quest isn't fun no matter how you try to spin it
---
Should be Australian
---
Yeah, I’m definitely not envious of the situation on the EU side.  The only thing us folks on the NA region servers have to worry about is the damned French Canadians.  Those guys hate English and anybody that speaks it from my experience.  Luckily there aren’t many of them.
---
It's not the same thing. The post is tagged as [Meta] because it's addressing the subreddit. 
---
Visit any subreddit and they have rules regarding creating certain types of posts. I think this should be one of them.
---
This is a discussion about the meta of the subreddit, not how people should play the game.
---
He would pick flowers. The the minotaur rage beast that he is
---
HAH! that's good
---
You will run clearcasting always so you can just kite with cone of cold, nova and dps with arcane explosion and flamestrike.
---
Arcane explosion aoe farming is better than blizzard if you can kill the mobs with explosion without going oom, atleast at leveling. so fire aoe farming shouldnt be a problem.
---
I think you mean 
---
Last;Line
---
People only exploit layering a couple times, it's not like sharding
---
Thanks for the apt summary
---
Lol ok so you are upset the beta has bugs. 
---
That explains why you came to reddit to report a bug to blizzard. You’re not aware of many things. 
---
If this is a big issue and 2 months isn’t a lot of time then your cries are being wasted.
---
You do know this isn’t the same game that was released 15 years ago right? That’s why there’s new bugs. That’s why they are have beta for it. Because of all the new bugs. Because this is not the game from 15 years ago. 
---
Any more questions?
---
You are advocating for exactly what blizzard has already said they are going to do. It’s pointless. This happens every day on both sides.
---
I can see that. But have you noticed that all the BFA boys trying the private servers are just anti social anyways? join group do the quest then leave. No interaction barley helping just kill sharing.
---
It was poorly worded.
---
Yours isn't much better. Just feeds the shitty comments and you make no comment on why you have no interest in layering. Both low quality posts that don't add anything.
---
DRUID!!
---
Dude it's testing phase. Your characters are going to be deleted. They don't care.
---
Since classic is the relaunch of a 15-year-old game, it appeals to a lot of 30-40 yo people or more. A lot of them don't speak english, or extremely basic. They are the most fucked in this story by far, and probably won't even bother play if they don't know a guild beforehand.
---
British are the 2nd most fucked, because you will be de facto excluded from every non english chat.
---
The rest, non-British that is comfortable with English, will have the less trouble, even though they will be excluded from other european languages.
---
All of the issues that still exist with Classic: Layering, servers not being split up by language and missing RpPvP servers is all due to Blizzard not wanting to open up enough servers. Great plan Blizz.
---
You pick which layer friend.
---
Horde?🤔
---
Well, I'm definitely biased because I fell in love with vanilla first.  Regardless of which endgame is best, the fact that they did nothing to preserve my favorite content kind of gives them a black eye in my book.  An "expansion" that shrinks the game isn't really an expansion.  It's another game placed on top of the corpse of the previous one.
---
I still think WoW is the best MMO available today.  It's just a shame that they didn't find a better way.
---
Ah yes the entirety of Americans all of them.
---
Condoms save lives!
---
“Same realms”
---
So you hear that and just assume 2-3 servers per region?
---
That’s not a smart estimate. 
---
Like I said, you don’t know the server list.
---
I suddenly feel so old...
---
What in the world was the point of posting this here (or anywhere at all for that matter)?
---
He won the vanilla 30, 1v1 tournament just a week ago.
---
So he is one of the best beta players and really really good at mage.
---
Wod under appreciated?  
---
  BC better than vanilla?  
---
  The fuck is this shit?
---
To put it simply, we check off all of your listed requirements. We have an emphasis on both PvE and PvP. PvP server, For the Horde, led by Classic veterans. All raid times will be evenings, expanding to two raid groups when the numbers dictate. 
---
If that brief synopsis sounds worth discussing further please feel free to reach out to me here or at wildgunmen#1302 on bnet. And good luck regardless of where you call home. Unless it's Alliance...
---
Leeway is what it is, same could be said about spell batching though to some extent.  
---
Both mechanics are of another time, both should be tweaked in my opinion, however seeing Blizzards current stance on authenticity I find it unlikely.
---
&gt; If they aimed for when more people in the US were off work, they'd be stuck at the office late.
---
Gee I'd really hate for them to have to do that.
---
I really can't stand the huge megastreamers like Asmon and Soda just because they have such shitty personalities and attract shitty people, I really wouldn't mind it though if I played with a more chill less popular streamer like Crendor or Madseasonshow
---
Interesting, does it mean that I need a non-russian sub to play non-russian servers? Currently I don't
---
Consider me one of the 40 Flakes. I get about 1 day, I can plan on making it. the other nights I'm on Dad and Husband time, but If a spots open and I'm online I will gladly step in, consume'd and studied
---
Why ask a doctor when you can ask bobby b? 
---
Or what do you think bobby b?
---
Imo you really don't have to prepare, classic isn't much of a competitive game and exploring it for yourself for the first time is worth it.
---
But I'll answer your questions anyway:
---
1.) Retail could be a good introduction to the basic idea of wow, but it's expensive to buy and honestly not that fun. I'd pass.
---
2.) Never played them,  but I doubt it will teach you much lore, I could be wrong tho.
---
3. There are many databases out there(wowhead being one), this allows you to look up quests, abilities, talents, gear and such  that you are interested in. It doesn't really help you as a introduction guide however, it's just a place to look up specific things. 
---
I would recommend playing blind, do quests, grind mobs, do as many dungeons as you can, and learn the basics of the game while you are doing it.
---
4.) It can definitely matter, some of the racials are better for PvE some better for PvP and some a kinda useless. For troll shaman for example you have a good racial for healing, but it won't do you much help in pvp. At most you will lose out on 25% extra chance to resist stuns. Take that as you will how important that is, not every class can stun and 25% is still 25%, and not every fight is won by resists.
---
DO YOU THINK IT'S HONOR THAT'S KEEPING THE PEACE?! IT'S FEAR! FEAR AND BLOOD!
---
I wish I could like this more.
---
Layering is server wide though, they can't layer specific zones, that would be sharding.
---
Ich habe eine Bratwurst
---
I mean really, which do you prefer:  
---
Ungodly wait times to even get ON the realm, have it run glitchy because it is overpopulated and over taxed, nasty wait for mob and resource respawns only to have it camped and taken asap, and likely multiple drops throughout each day everyday because the server is being abused.
---
or  
---
Layering/Sharding?  Sure people will try to abuse it, of course they will.  Sure it will get annoying to see people ghost in and out, but it beats the devil out of having a flash mob everywhere you look.  Try to imagine having say 5 times more people on ONE server than it is designed to handle.  5 times more people in any given zone, than it is designed to handle.  It would be a nightmare!  
---
Now, given they will load balance the layers, you can expect if they spin up "X" number of layers, and we have "P" number of players, you can assume you will have P/X = Layer Population.  e.g. 50,000 people / 10 layers = 5,000 per layer (roughly).  IE, each layer will be roughly balanced.  It's not like you can swap from one that is crowded to the max and then suddenly be in a silent wasteland.  There will be some difference, and node's etc may or may not be available.  It's not like getting a layer switch automatically respawns all mobs and resources...
---
Further - If you DO NOT want any layering, and think having say 2x the number of realms to begin with is a better solution, how much did you like it when your OLD realms died - or were suddenly filled full of outsiders from server "X" who were offered a transfer?  How would you like it if two dying servers are merged (as there would be no way to keep twice as many realms as needed alive in the long term) and you had that epic name that was iconic to you... maybe you still have it...maybe that other person with the same name got screwed instead of you.  Server merge would be permanent and suck.
---
My point is multifaceted:  
---
A - Layering cannot be sustained permanently.   There are too many in game repercussions which break the world that is WoW.  Further, it is diametric to why they are even rolling classic.  
---
B - We cannot simply NOT layer and expect any type of even remotely decent playability for  at LEAST a month.  It will be crazy and hectic WITH layers.  Without, it would simply be unplayable at best, unavailable at worst, unstable regardless.  
---
C-  Layers will be balanced.  Don't worry about people suddenly going from a booming metropolis to a ghost city.  That is not how load balancing works.  
---
D- Yes people will try, and succeed in some instances, at gaming the system.  FOR A SHORT WHILE.  Ok, so Herbalist Bob get's a ton of extra lotus and floods the AH, or fills up the guild bank.  SO WHAT?  It's short term.  If we can expect world bosses at the MAX of three months in - big deal.  For three months some people will try to game the game.  
---
E- Reread D and now add WHO FREAKING CARES.  So someone got an advantage over you.  OK, and?  That's life.  It happens.  It will not be the fall of the server economy LONG TERM.  Short term economies are going to be volatile anyway.  By the time we get to where the economy should settle down and become a pattern, we will be out of layering anyway.  So really, what is the impact of people trying to game the system?  Maybe they profit a little and get to spend more gold than you.  Look around...that's life.  As they say, "Suck it up, buttercup."  If you don't like that someone could take advantage and get more than you, then DO IT YOURSELF!  You spend the time and hassle to set up layer jumps.  You try to corner the market early and blah blah blah.   OR maybe you are of the mind set that all of these extra resources will be a bad thing, permanently destroying the economy.  \[funny to think that considering 1/2 the population will be gone in 3 months regardless... but\], if you REALLY believe that, then go farm and destroy everything you get.  Blow your gold at venders, then destroy those items to keep less gold in the economy.  Do what you feel you need to do to combat the issue in game.  OR --- 
---
F- Step back, think about the actual impact, and realize a short term dislike is better than a long term fail.  Be AMAZED that we are even getting CLASSIC after years of hearing it will never happen.  Be thankful that they have taken the time to plan the project well, and are trying to implement it the best way possible to both preserve nostalgia AND make it playable, not just for day 1 but for day 90, 180, 360, etc...  Maybe be glad it's starting at 1.12 and not 1.00.

Is there anything wrong with wanting more?  No.  But, we as a community need to also understand that launching classic is a little different than just a new patch or expansion.  It is more like day one launch of WoW.  It is a NEW game, again.  Day one back then had what 250,000 games sold...if ALL tried to get online on day one, that is a small percentage of what we will see on day 1 of classic.  Estimates are what 4 to 6 MILLION!  Everyone will (at least try) to download the content early, then as soon as the buzzer goes off LOG&gt;LOG&gt;LOG&gt;LOG&gt;LOG YAY I"M ON!!!!!  Ok, obviously not EVERYONE will log at the same exact time, but I would be willing to bet over day one we will see millions of login attempts.  Hopefully through decent planning, creative solutions, and a little luck we can all actually log on and start the race all over again.
---
1.  No.
---
3.  If you are not a minmaxer, and you want to just experience something new and fresh, I wouldn't prepare at all.  If you are, then vanillawowdb.com and wowhead (using the classic db selection) are both good.  classicdb.ch is kinda shit.
---
4.  Not unless you are a minmaxer, even then, barely.  
---
My advice is to do whatever seems like the most fun for you.
---
Hurr Durr I chose to have children so your choices should reflect my chosen lifestyle.
---
If they start opening up servers for languages like French or German. Why stop there?   Why not Klingon or Dothraki?
---
Should have been done on a weekend, middle of the day tbh.
---
I’d say go in blind except:
---
Research all the classes so you can make an educated decision on which fits your play-style/class-fantasy.
---
Look up what talents, dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds are.
---
Pick the most interesting looking race that can be what class you’re interested in. (Look up each races mounts if you need a tie breaker)
---
starter zones only
---
When you say “I think” and “I believe” that is your own opinion buddy. 
---
What you are saying is not fact. If something is not a fact then what is it?:)
---
Yea right, I remember. Still meh, since against Rogues you definitely want a Voidwalker and you'd still need to know one is there in the first place. Potentially not bad in BGs, though.
---
Do yourself a favor and don't play retail. It's a garbage experience for new players without heirlooms to level faster.
---
Source: Tried to level with my brother who is new to the game without using heirlooms.
---
Sounds like LFR.
---
Thanks for reaching out. I'll add you later tonight and we can talk then, perhaps.
---
Ist dies ein Aprilscherz außerhalb der Saison?
---
Just give the access to everyone, even those who don't have a sub. But because Blizzard are greedy fucks, well they don't do that.
---
Do you watch sports?
---
If so apply the same logic
---
Why don't you just go play football instead of watching it?
---
That can come back around to bite them in the ass if they don't attract the old fan base.
---
We will be
---
Ya no.
---
Lvl 10: Play as hybrid. Perhaps a wrath, moonfire then go bear to finish mob. You should be able to handle 2 mobs at a time which maximizes thorn damage and increases rage generation.
---
Lvl 20: You should already have 1 point in making cat form run faster. You level with cat. You damage as cat. Your life is cat.
---
KILL SH!T WITH CAT.
---
Windfury!
---
Bubble!
---
Shit was endless back in the day.
---
Sounds good. I leave the office at 7 tonight. Look forward to speaking with you.
---
Am I missing something?  None of those have any filter for Classic WoW.
---
can't have everyone pleased =/
---
Layering will do literally nothing to avoid what's happening in that image, though.
---
One person is set in playing horde for no specific reason. That’s what decided it... another problem is I don’t know how dedicated they will be to playing after launch since they might not like it. It’s my first time playing classic but I know I’m down for the grind.
---
1) Who the time to originally write this made-up crap
---
2) Why bother creating accounts just to keep reposting it every few days?
---
Imagine thinking Venruki sucks
---
Yeah dude. People acting like the first 2-3 quests are essential to the game are being needlessly obtuse.
---
I flipped some hours at work so I should be available for the exact launch time doesnt take much to get ahead.  Last night I showed up late, got stuck in the hell everyone is talking about.  Ended up checking servers, saw 2 new ones up so I joined.  Was able to make it out of the starting area rather quickly and it was like I was playing alone until I back tracked to echo isle for the mage quest.
---
Very well said!
---
I work in construction, there are so many guys who could be at the top of a skyscraper walking on a beam with nothing under them to go do some work and wouldn't wear a safety harness if you didn't make them wear one.
---
Some people just do not give a fuck about their personal safety.
---
&gt; IF YOU WANT TO, you have the option to walk places. no one is stopping you from doing that. 
---
there shouldnt be any work-arounds, you gotta EARN things in classic, not simulate tediousness.
---
&gt; Thanks to your stupid threads and arguments I will have way less time for my kids, just remember that 
---
Not because of your own fucked up priorities?  
---
Classic was casual yes, but not in a time-efficient matter, more like in a no-mechanical-skill matter. If u dont have the time, go play retail. We want classic to be classic and not to be ruined through 'busy' people, thanks.
---
Your right. We should let people with bad ideas talk and talk and talk and we should be quiet. Blizzard knows what we are thinking. Blizzard NEVER listens to these loud people and implement bad systems like LFR, loot boxes, ability pruning, pvp templates, and sharding, just to name a few. No one should defend their ideas ever. Its pointless.
---
Woah, how do people reach that?
---
I tested that one too, it did not work. Also tested this dragon chilli food which scales 1:1 with spellpower which is very good for cat or tanks in general.
---
With sharding pvp servers will be a walk in the park.      
---
It's obvious that if somebody or group is dominating a zone in a layer I'll just fuck around until I find one where they're not there.  Yuck.
---
&gt;If you followed the dev you would know it's the same code used back then -- they only integrated it within the current game engine which can create new bugs -- any more questions?
---
toxic brings toxic
---
Played on 2 vanilla live servers, and 2 private servers since then.  Despite what people say in polls, there is never enough priests at end game.
---
&gt; Maybe a classic style MMO isn't for you then
---
You define a classic style MMO as an unplayable one?
---
Name a first world country outside europe that speaks french as the primary language. Then name the dozen or so that speak english.
---
I think you're asking whether it's the colors of the animation or what feelings the animation represents that triggers my synesthesia. 
---
If that's the case... both. My synesthesia mainly deals with written words, letters, and symbols, so those will trigger my synesthesia regardless of their meaning. When it comes to colors/sounds, like in this case, the meaning is an essential part of it.
---
I tanked RFC as a shaman and it was amazing
---
I'm pretty sure he means at actual release
---
Germans I don't mind, most of them speak English, but please no French and Russians. 
---
I really don't want to roll on a server and find out later that 90% doesn't speak English.
---
literally what i said
---
Yeah because when there's a queue of 20 players to loot a quest item there is definitely enough mobs to grind...
---
on a pserver with **bugged respawn rates**, great argument
---
&gt;Im saying that always happend.
---
Apart from English, I've never seen an item in an other language than my mother tongue before the EU realms merges.
---
Do you want to play WoW if the chat looks like this:
---
"Mariobros: acquistare \[Sbocciapace\]"
---
"Frog: achete \[Pacifique\]"
---
"PrecisionEngineering: Kaufen \[Friedensblume\]!!!"
---
There's a huge number of people who want to play classic but can't. They watch streamers to live vicariously through them.
---
As much as I agree with this, I’m playing on a WotLK server right now. And it’s not the dungeon finder that kills social interaction in the open world (or even the dungeon). It’s like you said things being so easy there’s literally no need for you to interact with people. For example last night we were running a lvl 15 dungeon on some characters we made this week. And the healer was actually running low on mana a lot so we all traded him what mana stuff we had, it also kept us talking during the dungeon. Same kinda thing when we are questing in the open world, even mobs in WoTLK aren’t as easy as they are in retail. So a lot of times when my buddy and I are questing if we see someone who can heal or rank us (or just someone on the same quest chain even) we will see if they wanna join us questing.. Dungeon finder didn’t kill retail, it just filtered out general chat imo
---
It's not like we will have years and years to play this game. Fuck sharding, and fuck layering.
---
With international EU realms only, Blizzard will lose a many many potential players.
---
Layering is a piece of cake, compared to this decision. Unbelievable.
---
I know and I understand why they are needed.  I was just being an ass
---
At the 3,000 number they're talking about, doesn't that mean that evenly distributed they're planning on 500 people per starting zone (and more like 250 in some and 750 in others)?  I'm not as concerned as others about the world pvp and other layering issues, but it just seems like sharding is a much better solution.  And they can still decrease the number of shards over time.
---
The authentication servers and networking systems are the same ones that are used for retail: they aren't going to face any serious problems due to classic.
---
The only interesting question is how to layer/shard the classic realms to balance concerns about immediate over-population and eventual under-population, with concerns about having an authentic social experience.
---
Hmmmmm I wonder if OP and the CM that made the blue post could possibly have different ideas of what the word several means.
---
Yeah. I understand many people just joke that way but I would like more people to accept themselves and that gaming is their hobby.
---
Only the starting zones and the subsequent following zone. For example, Elwynn Forest and Westfall, Dun Morogh and Loch Modan, etc. That's it.
---
Venruki is a fucking boss, but as a long time shaman player... sometimes the windfury gods smile upon you... and you hammer smash your foes.
---
Exactly. That small difference means everything.
---
Except when the streamer eventually quits the server and then the entire population dies out.
---
And the actual idiotic people they attract.
---
And their determination to ban you for “stream sniping” when you kill them in a battleground you both joined coincidentally.
---
I dont think bobby b would allow this?
---
The differences are subtle but highly impactful.
---
For example, on K3 Murloc Foragers attempt use their self-heal 100% of the time. Every Forager will use it unless you finish them off while it's "casting." But in the beta some will use it while others will not.
---
Mob agro radius is smaller and they do not chain agro as easily.
---
Some quest prereqs are different. For example, Murloc Bounty has a prereq in the beta that it does not have on K3.
---
My months on K3 have been valuable preparation but as they say time spent in the simulator is no substitute for real-world experience.
---
SOON ENOUGH, THAT CHILD WILL SPREAD HER LEGS AND START BREEDING!
---
You group up and go somewhere people aren’t. I did it last night, had no issues. In their case they just go into around Razer Hill, group up and kill level 9-10 mobs until they’re high enough to solo them. Most people that “Get ahead” on server launches just grind until they’re in the clear
---
"He won the vanilla 30, 1v1 tournament just a week ago."
---
what a nice benchmark lol
---
lvl 30 1v1 tournamet with buncha plebs (streamers) who never played the game before
---
pog
---
WTF? I thought layering was only being used for the starter zone? This is dogshit.
---
4 days old account, 0 karma. What is this recent surge of throwaway accounts made to troll?
---
Warlock pet stances are definitely not working correctly, I experienced the same problems during the stress test last night. Aggressive stance was very flaky as well. I can remember setting my VW to aggressive and sitting it on a quest mob spawn to tag the mob, and it would attack instantly, every time.
---
Attempting the same thing on beta, the pet would randomly decide whether or not it was going to attack. Very inconsistent.
---
Yeah I think blizzard is sleeping on this super hard. Out of my group of IRL friends, about 20 of us are all close because of WoW. Only maybe 4 of us stuck around till BFA but with classic coming around the corner, nearly all of them are subscribing again. I think 3 of us participated in the stress test, but we have a bunch more that will come back for release. Wouldn’t be surprised if there are plenty more friend groups like mine that are gonna come back in a big way
---
I joined a server that they shut down because of lack of players, then rolled on 3. I don't know if it was layering or what, but it was mainly just the first couple quests in Teldrassil's starting area that I was unable to complete, as well as a pair of quests south of Dolanaar.
---
After I managed to get out of the starting area things got better fast, and by level 7 or 8 I never saw anyone. When I hit Darkshore at level 11 I saw no trace of other people besides a skeleton on the beach.
---
Csn you provide a link?
---
&gt; Just group up with players and farm mobs 
---
Yea totally disregard the early narrative and mindlessly grind out mobs! That will certainly keep new and returning players interested...
---
Wow, 2 comments and you've already destroyed your own argument.
---
Called blizzards solution bad, presented a "new" solution, and now said they were the same solution.
---
You should go work for blizzard with that 300 IQ level logic.
---
I agree that there is potential for the economy to be damaged.  I don't think that the damage is going to be as severe &amp; eternal as a vocal crowd thinks it will be.  
---
My personal thought is that the people that are going to be racing to the end and have the most potential/opportunity to exploit aren't going to put them straight into the economy (thinking herbs/ore).  It seems more logical/plausible that bulk of these people are going to be in hardcore raiding guilds &amp; are going to funnel them as a guild resource versus trying to horde/control market for the first two-three weeks.  By week 3 or so, I would hope Blizzard removes layering or reduced # of layers.  After that I would agree that the impact on the economy is going to see more &amp; longer lasting impact.
---
Blizzard also has two months to figure out another solution, so there is always that.  /shrug
---
I was on Spinebreaker-EU (also known as Spainbreaker) as my first realm and had no idea why people spoke in Spanish so much. Eventually they transferred off to official realms
---
My dad's old guild was minimum 18+ years of age, and most were between 21-60. They didn't have too many problems after they worked out the initial kinks.  They did take seasonal breaks but that led to a happier, healthier guild despite them not advancing as fast as they could. 
---
My dad eventually quit around Wrath (I took a long hiatus late into that expansion and wouldn't come back til WoD). It was actually the smaller needed group sizes that caused his guild to break up in later expansions. Those smaller groups would eventually become a click and then realize they were better off just having their own guild with their own rules. 
---
Still, you don't need a raid of 30+ teenagers to be successful. In my own experience, they tend to be less capable of committing to a schedule and behaving themselves in coordinated encounters anyway.
---
I'm European but there's no way in hell I'm gonna play on EU servers. Just imagine all the different language, it's a mess. Hello, US servers.
---
You are absolutely correct. I dont care is APES gets 12 sets of devilsaur gear in 2 weeks by cheesing layers. I will never compete with them. I will however, compete with the other 99% of players for everything else.
---
&gt;n the stress tests the layering isn't working as they said it should
---
Do we know whether or not they were adjusting the number of layers during the stress test? I'd assume that they would to see how things are handled, and also that adjusting them would result in people/mobs popping in/out.
---
Looks like Blizzard doesn't believe in a long-term success of classic wow
---
&gt;So you’d rather stand around waiting for wolves to spawn for hours instead of actually being able to play the game?
---
At this point yes. The amount of abuse that will take place because of layering is worth a shit show start at launch.
---
What are you not understanding?
---
Roughly 40% of the EU Retail player population isn't getting their own realms in Classic. Which, by all reasonable measurements, means Blizzard doesn't think 40% of the player population will be able to sustain even one realm in Classic.
---
5 realms for all of EU was generous of me.
---
We just report everyone writing in the barbaric languages! Soon the servers will be as pure as a post Brexit UK! :P
---
My vanilla guild had a roster of ~60 raiders, and about 20-30 of those were near 100% attendance. On peak nights, we'd have enough people, although sometimes not the right class mix (ex: need more healers, need a second hunter with tranq shot, need more mages for dispel magic, etc.). On offpeak nights, we'd often have 30 people at raid start time, and then we'd be sitting around waiting for people to log in. We usually didn't bring stranger-PUGs, but people a guildie would vouch for, or raiders in allied guilds who wanted to play an alt, etc. We had some allies in a PvP guild that we would snag for the occasional raid, too (and they would raid in PvP spec).
---
Most nights we started between 10 and 45 minutes late while waiting for people (although in MC and AQ40, you can clear trash without a full raid). Most of our guild was employed full time. We would raid 9pm-12:30am EST, but that was 6pm-9:30pm PST, so the west coast people would be fighting traffic to get home from work and log in for raids.
---
Noob here, what's layering?
---
The entire point of Layering is to split the playerbase so that the game is actually playable.
---
If you're going to have multiple servers but they're all just one game world.....what's the point?
---
This is super useful! Looks like it should only take ~15 minutes to get anywhere (assuming you have all the flight points unlocked already.
---
I see. I've always hit it every time it was up. Makes sense to let gear that will be replaced shortly wear down.
---
What do you mean bugged spawn rates? They have dynamic respawning.
---
What a jump in logic... There's a lot of reason why we're stuck with BFA now and this isn't one of them. Try again.
---
Pets were never this bad in Vanilla.
---
They had issues yes, but pets on the beta are far worse.
---
we all know the french only pretend they cant cause theyre so stuck up ;)
---
They should at least divide it into english/everyone else
---
Found the guy that spent time thinking about what to say to that lvl?? that killed him in Redridge.
---
5/10 honestly, its not cringy, it just kinda feels like a comeback Carlton Banks would give. It probably means you are a great dancer.
---
That was my point. I see retail and vanilla as two different games altogether, although being top tier at retail does have an advantage. Since vanilla was more than 12 years ago, even some of the best players from back then, and some of the best today, will have a time to adjust and get comfortable with different PvP scenarios. Some players like Monkeynews, Esfand, Perplexity and Payo have been playing for years on private servers, but even for them it's hard with all the differences between the pservers and the real deal, although they also have big advantages.
---
The first time I did the stairs, I shat myself lol
---
It's so tough man, the respec costs are crazy too because as a priest I want to play both shadow and holy for pvp and pve, respectively.
---
A user on the hunter discord found a way to somewhat fix the pet issues. You need to keep your pet in Defensive mode at all times though, since Passive mode is bugged like hell.
---
Here are the macros the aforementioned user used (Attack, Follow and Stay macros, respectively):
---
    #Pet Attack
---
    /petdefensive
---
    /petfollow
---
    /petattack
---
    /cast Growl
---
    #Pet Follow
---
    /petstay
---
    #Pet Stay
---
And you are complaining about queue times because....?
---
If you were actually played horde chances are very high you were on a server that heavily leaned Alliance, the numbers for Alliance vs Horde globally during classic were very one sided which is why they got the Blood Elves to try and tilt it somewhat towards a balance.
---
So playing horde you had near instant queues.... thats how it worked.
---
If 20 Alliance queued and 10 Horde queued that means 10 Alliance got in instantly with the 10 Horde whilst the remaining Alliance hung around and waited. When the game finished those 10 Alliance had their queue pop and the Horde players went right back in with the other Alliance players who just finished their match now having to wait their turn.
---
So again, you definitely played Alliance or not at all or maybe the last possibility that you are just playing stupid now because if you played Horde in classic you knew queue times were basically non existent.
---
also this is probably beta wher eits probably on the highest settings (probably simulating extra players) to test it out looking for things like this.
---
Can i have an ELI5? What does being in “layer 1” vs “layer 4” do?
---
60 in a whole week? There’s already plans of having mc cleared in first week. Although first clear usually has some 57s and 58s in it.
---
Blizzard doesnt have all their cups in the cupboard.
---
People will only understand trainstation when they read chat.
---
People have done that in all the stress tests so far. Most people are already in groups and mobs die as soon as they spawn. Most of the time there's no mobs and just lots of people standing around waiting. This is *with* layering mind you. If people could be off farming mobs they would, but there's none that aren't taken already.
---
Same here, I selected panda cub for the druid I was playing. Everyone kept asking how I got it, most are surprised I have the original collectors box.
---
I don’t believe you sir. Took 30 minutes for me to sing lvl 2 on that server.
---
Ryan, you mofo.
---
I did my part, sir.
---
Sorry you're getting absolutely demolished for approaching the topic with a level head.
---
You’re making me sad.  I might be in that 90%.
---
Vanilla isn’t for everybody. If you don’t like competing for quests, enemies and resources, it might not be for you. It doesn’t mean Blizzard needs to cater to every player that demands a flawless and uncontested leveling experience. It happens in Vanilla. Lack of Player convenience and quality of life is what seperates a lot of what is Vanilla and BC from other expacs
---
Nova range works fine, it's 10 yards, the hunter deadzone and min range is what's fucked up. The hunter has to stand about 11-12 yards away from the target to be able to shoot it, in reality it should be 8 yards.
---
*Do you guys not have google translate?*
---
I checked the server without the heavy layering and it was packed still, so i don't think it was a population problem but more so a layering issue.
---
My experience with layering is a feeling of solitude, which makes completing quests easier, but there was 0 community from it -that's what felt wrong.
---
On the flip side to it, the other server was also a cluster fuck. I ended up grinding what I could to 6 and going to brill. It lessened up a wee bit, I still had to fight for tags, but I grouped for kill quests and recognized people as I progressed through Tirisfal. It did take much longer, but I felt a more complete experience.
---
Not sure what the answer is, but I do worry about layering issues.
---
Those idiotic people are in every server. They were more idiotic in 2005. You're giving streamers way too much credit. Their audience isn't going to make or break a server population
---
Yep. I have not regretted any time I spent on vanilla WoW so far, it's all positive memories. It's good to make positive memories. :)
---
What does it have to do with my post ? Wut?
---
I won't be happy until we get a dedicated server for Moldova. Only Romanian language allowed of course, but WALLACHIANS STAY THE FUCK OUT.
---
they are waiting for an item that has \~2 min respawn when it has instant respawn on classic
---
You're a moron.
---
The hardcore will do that yes, but the Chinese gold sellers will produce a massive amount of resources by abusing the layering system
---
I did it last night no issue. Went to level 9 mobs, grinded in a 5 man group. Didn’t have issues
---
A true adventurer right there.
---
Mage has easier time with melee classes, and a lot of ganking attempts on you will be rogues. No need to outgear them or go into specific talents, you stand a fair chance if not dominate from the get-go.
---
Warlock's biggest weakness in wPvP are rogues who get to open on you. Sure, you could go Soul Link, but Soul Link is bad for everything that's not dueling and making gankers' lives miserable. In addition, a fair share of Lock's power against specific classes in 1v1 is dependant on having the correct pet out.
---
There’s 2 months until release. These things can be ironed out. I agree the way it’s set right now isn’t good, however, I think it can be a good thing if they do it right.
---
That's pretty acoustic
---
Cdew=pleb?
---
Ryan is spot on. Farming gold is for suckers.
---
Yeah the gray equipment drop is insane, to I do have some faint memory of such thing happening back then
---
You'll have to wait for his favorite twitch streamer to answer that.
---
Mans is getting caught up in the video game version of the News.  Over reactions to shit that doesn't matter.
---
This has no business being as good as it is
---
K
---
EVE has a full 1 second server tick. That made things pretty weird. 
---
Does anyone know if there are any talents or items in WoW that reduce cool downs by less than 400ms? If so they would effectively do nothing, right?
---
At least if they don't split up the realms just make them all English. We don't want people speaking French and other meme languages in trade chat.
---
Can you share your spreadsheet, I'm totally not a 33 year old just as pathetic as you are.  :)
---
Who said there would be a german, french, spanish client? ;)
---
Hahahahaha.  I can just picture you checking the server queue before crawling into bed one night, seeing "estimated 12 hours," and waking up in eight to find the queue popped in seven and you got disconnected for being idle too long.
---
But they already said layering will only be a thing at the beginning and will be removed , also I don't think it's going to be on all servers.
---
The point is that the A-1 and A-2 servers are seperate servers in most ways that matters. They will share naming (i.e there cannot be a Mn on A-1 and a Mn on A-2) and they will be known to merge as population decreases (In weeks/before phase 2 as with layering).
---
This fixes every issue related to layering since layering is meant to keep from merging dead realms, with this system people will know going in that the servers will be merged and that they are sharing namespace.
---
So they will not be one game world they will be seperate and you cannot interact between them. 
---
If, as they claim will be the case, layering will be gone quickly then the servers will merge quickly and the impact on server identity will be reduced.
---
It's pretty mind boggling how instead of addressing the posts directly you just go make a strawman thread about it to avoid the legitimate criticisms of the system as it is currently implemented.
---
One shadow priest is needed each raid for warlock powerups. You will be treated like royalty from your lock guild mates.
---
I know very well who he is and what I said stands.
---
If you watch, V wands the totem and then waits for the second bolt to DPS the shaman as he closes on him. It’s a show-off move for finishing off a fleeing enemy in your pvp video. Experienced vanilla mages know wanding is only for priests in pvp. All this low-level dueling has warped their thinking. Post-vanilla mages have all but forgotten the absolute terror of melee because they could recover from something like that. But *IN* vanilla, geared warriors and enhance shaman would absolutely delete mages if they could get to them.
---
Oh I know, they're gonna have to adjust again once everyone hits 60.
---
That’s awesome! Yeah you definitely don’t need a bunch and I’m glad most won’t be lol. I must’ve been annoying af back then. I just meant that’s a reason why it will be harder across the board. I’m sure many individual guilds who may not even be hardcore will do just well.
---
So don't my fricking go to Barrens/Westfall. There's Silverpine, darkshore, and Loch modan...also group up with other players this isn't a single player adventure
---
No, I don't get the point because what he's describing is literally impossible. Unless he joined a group, this has a 0% chance of happening. The technology to do this is not running on the classic servers.
---
I dont own any collectors edition, but thats actually really cool of Blizzard to add this in!
---
I think you might be seeing what you want to see, and aren't recognizing the huge presence that is the method streamers and sodapoppin who are horde.  It's probably closer to 50/50.
---
Can someone explain to me what layering is? I don't understand the videos.
---
Didn’t they already confirm they will remove it as soon as possible? It’s only temporary to stabilize servers. It doesn’t help if there are 100 people trying to kill 6 boars. To me it makes sense, and it will be removed as soon as possible anyways right?
---
&gt;The entire point of Layering is to split the playerbase so that the game is actually playable.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If you're going to have multiple servers but they're all just one game world.....what's the point?
---
... what? Did you not read what all of the steps (this idea isn't mine by the way, its usually called 'sister servers')? The point is to stagger the population temporarily. Exactly what layering does, except not exploitable.
---
Well the Germans, Spanish and French are hopefully very public about where they will go so that the rest can... well... go somewhere else :P
---
If you dont wanna play on an english server just dont play classic. And spamming none english is just rude as hell but guess if you dont have the brain for a second language that's the way to go.
---
Wait are you implying that it was easier 15 gears ago because they made more players and worse technology? The fuck
---
why? I don't remember Ion ever lying. He states why he disagrees and carries on.
---
This is a game, not some kind of social experiment. People want to play with people they understand.
---
Druid. So like diet rogue/warrior.
---
do you have a license for that [Primitive Hand Blade]?
---
Shaman. Tremor Totem for fear, Grounding Totem to catch an offensive spell, Earth Shock to interrupt and spell lock a cast, Purge to clear your buffs, Nature's Swiftness for an instant big self-heal, Windfury hitting you for some extra burst. Warstomp for an extra interrupt if Tauren. 
---
Shaman is a caster killer. Shaman is an every class killer.
---
Just for a couple days..
---
This needs more attention. Great video btw
---
I'm damned if I can recall what I used but I had a working voice control system working back in BC. I just played my main toon normally and the on follow toon controlled by voice. 
---
I bought voice commander on steam a while back and never got around to using it. I do plan on playing around with it to see how it works out.
---
I'm really fine with this tbh. It was like this on the private servers, except people had to deal with chinese and russians which just refuse to speak english.
---
Holy shit, how hard is it to just not fuck Classic up with stupid fucking decisions like this.
---
"We think this approach will give players more freedom to move around to where they want, and find guilds and friends that best match their interests."
---
Really? Freedom? It's easy $$$ by saving money on server costs and more easy $$$ by forcing people to transfer down the line
---
# ZORN
---
Oh that's awesome! I played a Hunter in vanilla, which is part of the reason why I'm also playing Hunter this time around \^\^ HUNTER LOOT BOIS :3
---
Or that they realize laggy/rough launches are really not a big deal, and that the long term health of the economy and server identity may in fact be more important than being able to quest quickly through the first 2 or 3 days of the game.
---
You can literally get to lvl 5 grinding mobs and doing select quests in like 40 min. Which is much faster than standing around waiting for stuff to spawn.
---
Main reason I know this: I was one of those teenagers once lol.
---
I still remember him scolding me after I trolled one of his guildmates very poorly and making me apologize to them on Teamspeak, lol.
---
After that I started playing on my friend's Horde server instead.
---
Personally I think this is fantastic news. I used to play DAoC back in the day and that was full of people from all over Europe. You got such a great sense of community, where each guild really had their own flavour and you could even pick up other languages (or swear words) if you wanted to put the effort in. I'm loving this decision.
---
Well that was the whole point wasn’t it, this was the logical decision, but OP is memeing about the fact this was predictable and they might a well started out thus.
---
If phase 2 is 3 months out and layering is removed after 11 weeks then it is true that layering was removed before phase 2. I don't think Ion saying "a few weeks" was meant literally but was his attempt to downplay the issue to limit the backlash he knew it would cause.
---
Need to go full circle. The Alli who waved needs to past his screen shot now
---
Why are you so defense? I didn't even say anything about retail in this post.
---
Yes i do play retail a lot. I'm a part of the twinking community, which can be found here: xpoff.com
---
It is how layering works. The difference in sharding and layering is there is more permanence to it
---
Sharding is per zone. You can shard in and out of it as you please. Each zone can phase you depending on your location and that areas population. 
---
Layering is per realm with a cap. Once you are on a layer in that realm you are on that layer until someone invites (which you return to your layer after you leave I believe)
---
What doesn’t make sense to me is why your character can long in to one layer then to another and remain on the layer you logged into. 
---
That’s my limited knowledge of it as well friend so it gets confusing to me
---
Are you suggesting players should travel all the way from Northshire Abbey to end of the zone at level 2 in order to level up lol? If that's their only option, we have serious issues worthy of criticism.
---
I got a whisper from a "GM" on a private server saying I would get banned if I continued to fear off the boat. Made me lol.
---
A fair amount does not mean a majority.
---
Thanks I appreciate I will try that -- and I'm indeed playing with my Pet on Passive
---
Autimso Joe? Keep getting your comments removed bruv. Hope it makes you feel better about being wrong.
---
that, and china
---
Just because they used the word phase doesn't make the whole message incomprehensible. They're just saying that they got layer switched in combat.
---
It's not SUPPOSED to do that but that doesn't mean it can't happen.
---
You don't need to prepare. From someone who has played a lot of MMOs for a lot of hours over more years than I'll admit, it's nowhere near as daunting as you've probably been led to believe. It's just a game and not a particularly hard one to learn or play. It is an older game, but it's fine. You'll be fine.
---
Honestly the reason you see loads of people "prepping" for Classic and obsessing over every little thing is just because they're all bored and impatient as hell wanting the game to launch already. If you want to play the Warcraft RTS games purely for fun and to get to know the universe a little then just do it because it's fun. You won't be missing anything significant if you aren't steeped in all the lore. And you won't learn much from playing the RTS games that will carry over to the MMO version.
---
I would recommend not playing retail unless you just really want to. If you do, be aware you're going to wind up unlearning a lot of things, and you may actually come away with a poor impression of the leveling experience since it's got a lot of problems in the modern game by now. Play it as its own thing if you want something to fill the time, but expect to start over from zero learning a completely different game with Classic.
---
As far as race / class choices, I'll just leave this here:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b673ma/deciding\_on\_a\_healer\_main/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b673ma/deciding_on_a_healer_main/)
---
This seems needlessly rude. "Learn English or don't play this game."
---
All aboard the WF hype-train!
---
Asmon said at launch he won't accept any items or gold. I bet that last to about level 20.
---
The circklejerk against streamers on this subreddit is insane
---
I don't understand how in all those threads about layering you didn't get the message that it is serverwide.  It's not zone based layering, a "layer" is the whole server, the whole instance and you can't make it zone based.
---
So layering can't "stop" when you leave Northshire, for instance.  It does not work like that.
---
I played about a year and a half of Vanilla. Starting zones were never so full that you couldnt get done what you needed to do. The genuine classic experience does not involve skipping all your starter content because its too packed. 
---
The time for your try hard attitude is not levels 1-10.
---
True.  Again, hoping that Blizzard will have found a more workable solution to dealing with them where they are more of an annoyance versus a plague.  As much as I enjoyed seeing a website spelled out in gnome corpses or getting spam from Susan Express.
---
Indeed, with an increased level cap comes more spells and variety. I also think most people in the community can attest to the fact that it takes quite a while to get adjusted to a certain character and/or spec, regardless of how good you are at the game. Especially when it's such a dramatic change from retail to classic.
---
Where did I ever complain about queue times during vanilla???? I said cross realm BG’s were a fantastic feature, which they were.  While I never mentioned it previously, in addition to lower queue times for EVERYBODY (alliance and horde alike, even if Horde times were lower before they were implemented) it made it so you didn’t end up playing against the same exact team for hours at a time.  
---
The amount of utter morons on this sub that have a hard time reading (your a prime example) is nothing short of astounding to me. 
---
Instead of trying to play the role of master detective and tell me what I did or didn’t play (LOL - yeah, you’re a better source of what I’ve done than I am LOL) why don’t you go work on  developing your shit reading comprehension skills.
---
Top rated comment.
---
If you want to play an MMO near launch? Absolutely. If you want a game that shards you to you never have any downtime or competition questing, there’s a game for you. It’s just not Vanilla
---
 My gut tells me twitch and/or curse will have a separate option by launch
---
The 2.3 spellqueue is the real latency fixer.
---
How is that even a language
---
not everyone will accept that, especially people with little english skills. And to chat in english is something ENTIRELY different than talking english with them via teamspeak/discord etc. If i want to keep my guild/community a german-speaking community im effectively eliminating 80% of all the potential recruits on my server, assuming a perfect distribution of languages.
---
Okay grandpa
---
To the top with you. So many people in here not understanding what the point of layering is and what its for.
---
Saying stuff like "Just layer the starter zones" shows you hate something that you don't even understand.
---
And don't forget that vanilla had race specific spells for e.g. priests
---
You're not fooling anyone by saying casual players will give up if there servers are laggy/unavailable/have long queue times for 5 minutes. 
---
Original WoW launch had even less hardcore players and was amazing. 
---
I would choose classic queue times and risk of "dead servers" down the road over layering/sharding as it currently is.
---
Layering?
---
I watched both clips and have no idea wtf it is?
---
There's a pretty big difference between watching elite athletes vs a guy that plays a video game sorta good.
---
Choquer et déçu
---
Nachoing
---
I honestly felt bad when the Spanish forums united to "conquer" Spinebreaker, but, to be honest, they didn't give us any other choice. That's why these news are so bad for EU, people will try to do the same once more and the community will feel really divided within each server.
---
I thought they still kill you when you arrived
---
I think they don't want dead servers and know there won't he millions playing classic wow in 5 months.
---
It's 2019 gaming- too many other gaming eco systems going at the same time to assume everyone will play in 1 or 2.
---
&gt;I don't know where you are getting your information.
---
Hunters ARE less damage than a few other specs that don't even have good aggro resets. If warriors had pets and a pet specialization tree this would be a great argument for warriors because they don't have a reset and they do some of the best damage, but that's not the class we're talking about. Yes, anyone can accidentally pull aggro by prematurely DPSing too hard, I've done it on my shitty low-gear holy/ret solo spec paladin by randomly getting a seal of command/auto crit after divine favor/holy shocking plenty of times. That doesn't mean it's a particularly bad problem for hunters, so much so that it's a good justification for a worse spec.
---
&gt;I was highest DPS **hunter** in most raids *during a period where usually only 1-2 hunters are taken per group because you don't need a lot of them to fulfill their niche and their DPS isn't that amazing
---
&gt;2nd only to another hunter whose spec I did not specify *for some reason*
---
Oh and I definitely noticed that you didn't even acknowledge the issue about pets not having avoidance in vanilla.
---
yeah you're right. /sadface
---
Im not Europeon so maybe I have a different view but I speak only english and a very small bit of spanish. I would NOT want to learn a whole new language just to play a game
---
Zoomers playing classic....
---
That just doesn't feel right
---
Or Hache-Tripes (HT) for Dire Maul hehe
---
They said around 3 weeks, where at least a good bunch will be lvl 60. I dont care much about this, as long as it gets removed at some point.
---
Get your inventory (and yoir life) together.
---
People would rather have a smooth 10 hours starting leveling in exchange for screwing up player interation for the whole ride to 60 and beyond...
---
If my first experience playing WoW was 40 minutes of smacking a boar with a rusty sword I dont think I would ever have kept playing. Those initial quests help get you into the world.
---
We should down vote female gnomes being allowed in the game
---
Servers should be grouped beforehand so that you can't take a name used on any of the grouped servers.
---
This still harms the server community, but in a less personal sense.
---
It would still cause problems for people who lose their exclusive status such as early rank 14s, scarab lords, etc.
---
Confession time... I bought gold once and only once back in the day. It wasn't for selfish reasons, only to save time I didn't have. Levelling Alchemy was a bitch and I needed to be able to make pots. I got fast tracked into raiding after I got all the required gear myself but wanted to give something back as well. Black Lotus were also a complete and utter bastard.
---
*hon hon hon*
---
This is for you
---
MMO launches used to be like this. PS launches are all like this. If you’re demanding Blizzard to make Vanilla, then demanding that your experience is flawless and shards you everywhere so you can quest perfectly, then this isn’t the game for you. There’s going to be zones where there’s too much PVP to efficiently quest too. But that doesn’t mean Blizzard needs to fix it. It’s part of being in a shared world. You would need to do the same thing. Go find a way to level somewhere else. If that’s not appealing there’s always BFA
---
I'm not sure I follow.
---
Why do his alts stay in their layers, but his main switches?
---
Is it because he only logs out of the alt (and thus stays connected to the server), and on the main he closes the game completely (losing connection to the server)?
---
Yeah, being 15 vs being 30 in WoW has made a difference. Still fond of the O Rly owl though
---
I heard of a thing called TBC once.
---
Guess Canada does not belong to NA anymore.
---
I think I will do war. Hopefully the wisp form will speed up leveling lmao. Also shadowmeld is incredible and has a variety of uses, afk button, great for arathi basin flag watching, ect. My dad will be leveling a priest with me so I'm not too worried about it but we won't really be leveling at the same rate neccessarily so I won't have pocket heals 24/7 :(
---
Thanks. Any thoughts or comments about the Hybrid HoTW spec vs full on resto for raids/dungeons?
---
&gt;We, as a population, SUCKS at English.
---
I gotta admit, this made me chuckle a little. Point taken.
---
(Your English is still 1000x better than my French).
---
Don't follow everyone's advice to a complete T.
---
Listen to what people have to say, play the game, form your opinions and have an open mind.
---
Accept that there will be 60s within the first week or two of launch and it might take you months.
---
&gt;Where did I ever complain about queue times during vanilla???? I said cross realm BG’s were a fantastic feature, which they were.
---
Lol what do you think they were for?
---
&gt;it made it so you didn’t end up playing against the same exact team for hours at a time.
---
Thats not a benefit and again you just speak of Alliance issues.
---
Horde players play all sorts of teams because there are far more teams queuing on that side compared to the Horde team which has to face all of them 1 at a time because they may be the only team queuing then.
---
&gt;The amount of utter morons on this sub that have a hard time reading (your a prime example) is nothing short of astounding to me.
---
Yeah real masses of retards in here as demonstrated by you.
---
&gt;Instead of trying to play the role of master detective and tell me what I did or didn’t play (LOL - yeah, you’re a better source of what I’ve done than I am LOL) why don’t you go work on developing your shit reading comprehension skills.
---
Nah just need to not converse with retards like yourself who get their pants pulled down in the conversation only to be revealed as completely covered in shit.
---
You said a retarded thing and decide to double down, really exmplifying the stupid of this subreddit but thats ok, just one more person to block.
---
See ya Sperg.
---
I think ~30 worldwide is the right number to start with. Can always add more if queues are too long.
---
Because that's not the way the layering architecture works.  It creates a new world, the whole map, and puts population in it, the architecture doesn't support layering zones because you aren't switching servers to go to different zones.
---
Alright, funny name
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I agree it's a possibility, but reading Ion's quote as proof that blizzard is trying to deceive us and layer us to hell and back makes no sense. OP's point was that Ion was claiming layering period = phase 1, when that isn't the case at all. I don't feel like Blizzard is rubbing their hands together with layering like it's something they want really badly. Feels like they think it's the lesser of all the potential evils from the huge player base.
---
Which is exactly why we should be making as much noise about this as possible. There is less than two months left to fix this.
---
What will their numbers be once Classic actually releases and the horde of viewers can actually be playing?
---
There’s a huge difference in how loot gets distributed.  On the server pack I ran just to play around by myself, you could set group loot to free for all, but quest drops would still be distributed randomly.   On Classic, quest drops are available to whoever is on the quest.
---
Mafia members will be weaving between layers to farm nodes so efficiently you'll feel like professor X with his helmet on as they phase in and out of high level farm spots.
---
oh?
---
That's my understanding so I don't get how he could want zone specific layering when it's basically realm wide.
---
Not if you do it before you zone
---
Why on Earth wouldn’t they separate by language?
---
It’s a social game.
---
I truly think Blizzard is under estimating how many people are going to crawl out of the wood works to take another hit of the vanilla wow crack pipe, myself included. Played vanilla + tbc, no wotk. I'm not resubbing until name reserve in August.
---
 Shits gonna be bananas. I dont like the layering/phasing bullshit. I think they should do away with it and up the ante for more sever hardware/realms.
---
Yeah but then they'll stick layering in for extra phases...and I guarantee they'll make an excuse for it during the AQ opening...just annoying
---
The only other vanilla-like alternative is those 66% of players (those in other layers) is putting them in a huge queue. You still can't play with them.
---
I'm not saying I like layering, but all the alternatives I've seen suggested are worse, imo.
---
yes, no one is going to be leveling as protection anyway. If your group has an issue with it find another group.
---
Their product is so superior that all the top pserver people are on classic beta?
---
Did you click fireball and make it active?  If so he wont attack
---
Did you do that in vanilla? Mad props to you and your guild.
---
I mean it makes sense they cant read most of em don’t have eyes for fucks sake.
---
Honestly, I'd like to see them do barrens and such for a month or two as well...but I'd hate to not see pvp in hillsbrad/arathi.
---
When are they releasing server names?
---
At first I was worried, but then I realized I live in Murcia, so this is not my problem.
---
still the issue of strangers appearing out of nowhere.
---
Double scarab lords (the mount part I suppose)
---
More R14s than have actually ranked there
---
Someone suddenly no longer being "The best geared rogue on the server", or even "the only rogue to camp redridge 24/7"
---
Look there's reasons people watch streams. A) Gameplay B) Personality. So if the guy sucks at the game people are there for the personality, not to watch videogames.
---
If streaming was just people looking at random people playing a game, there wouldn't be 100k watching asmongold and 5 people watching joe schmo.
---
Yea its pretty funny to complain about layers duplicating resources when they just flat out made more on pservers.
---
Yeah, my guild ran MC weekly until we were half way through AQ. Only ever got 1 TF that entire time.
---
... because the entirety of "the old fan base" is people so opposed to layering they'd rather not play at all than deal with something the servers are doing in the bacteria backgrounds that'll be all but invisible to the majority, amirite?  Cool gatekeeping bro.
---
I'm part of the old fan base, having played off and on since launch, and I'm okay with layering as a better solution to dramatic population dropoffs from tourists than having overcrowded servers, massive queues, or forcing a pile of merges in a few weeks.
---
Don't you guys have dictionaries?
---
Pally's and racials.
---
Again, your try hard attitude doesnt belong in starting zones. We arent talking world PvP, we are talking early levels. 
---
And dude save the condescending tone for someone else. I played EVE for half a decade. Nothing in WoW even comes close. Let me rob your corpse and break into your bank vault. Then we can talk about unforgiving video games.
---
Ninja loot whatever you want!
---
Layering / sharding destroys any semblance of pvp and tuens the game into single player rpg with matchmaking. Will not be playing. Interesting to see people defending it lmao
---
While I think OS need rolls is kinda lame, I think it’s totally understandable for healers and tanks outside of Raids. If you wanna be a good player, I’d at least give them a heads up before starting the instance.
---
And where did private server players come from?
---
I hope so, but it feels like there will be fewer than 10 per region, maybe a lot fewer. They are going to cram a lot of people into each server.
---
Been playing since 2006 and ask this kind of question. 
---
Something doesn't add up.
---
They probably checked who tried the stress test and extrapolated low interest from EU because of this.. 
---
/s (actually not unlikely)
---
Does it count if your bunghole is on fire from spicy snacks?
---
Im a German Dude with Mediocre English Skills so im not that mad tbh. I finally have the chance to improve but as ive read the outrage on our German Forums there will be Thousands People not playing if they arent releasing German Realms
---
If you tank a group just make sure there isnt any one else that can use what you can use your the tank so you can enforce it
---
Just want to say something, most dangerous don't always have to mean the most efficient. In WSG for example a well played druid, priest/pally and mage could literally carry an entire BG because of how easy they can get the flag and stall the game while the other noobs all go for the efc. So if I was in a WSG pug that trio would be way harder to play against than 2 warriors and a healer in mid.

It really won't be a problem. Nativ speakers have always been a minority on English EU servers.

You must be new ~~here~~ on the internet.
---
where did you get the 300k number from btw? based on the latest stress test?
---
My memory is a little fuzzy but it's most likely going to largely depend on who's in your party. It's not *terribly* difficult to dodge Mail/Plate wearers in your dungeons, so competing for armor isn't a huge issue. When it comes to mutually beneficial upgrades in gear, you'll have to play it by ear. Some players are open to discussion and won't mind multilpe runs, some you'll just have to pony up and Need roll against them.

Before level 60, absolutely. Everyone just wants gear to help them level.
---
At level 60, you'll need to discuss with your group beforehand. I'd be pretty pissed if my tank rolled on HoJ without saying they planned to first.
---
Sorry my bad, read that as „are not allowed“ . Beg your pardon my good Sir.
---
Except people in Europe communicate in English, most of the time when they are from different countries, because there's so many and we can't all speak 24 languages.
---
The issue is there are large groups of people that don't speak English or just refuse to or don't really care if people don't understand their language.
---
We need servers that are designated English speaking servers for the mixed nationality players and servers for the other big languages, so English servers won't randomly turn out to be 90% French or German and basically make the game unplayable for the remaining 10%.
---
Most people only thing layering shouldn't exist after lvl 20 zones. No one is saying to take it out of starting areas. thats just stupid
---
Bro, even layering will not be implemented after phase 1 so this wouldn’t either! Strangers would only appear out of nowhere on the merge date.
---
there was serious congestion on sargeras, mal'ganis, illidan, kil'jaeden for the release of bfa.  couldn't login sometimes, pick up quest items, or get out of combat the first weeks and weekend cause the lag was so bad.
---
more like how many EU players opted in for beta, but they should have a shit ton of other metrics to estimate the EU playerbase by now.
---
I honestly dont see it as a big problem. Its rather nice. Youll just have specific guilds for each nations language, thats the way it is on pservers already and if i managed to learn english with nothing but wow as a child i honestly can expect you guys to learn enough to know lfg and such... Especially since the "wow language" is spoken on any server except russia and china perhaps, where they simply have a whole different alphabet.
---
Be honeat to yourself you dont have to talk in any language aslong as you know lfg, lfm, lf dps/heal/tank, inv, r?  Etc. 
---
And now tell me about how english "r" is.
---
Btw. I grew up with german.
---
Next thing you all dont realize is the experience youll gain from it, maybe even learn a bit of other cultures. Maybe even a bit of spanish.

Hell dont cry because of something that can enrich you ffs.

*Laughing in NA intensifies*
---
Poke, poke, poke, is that all you can do ?
---
This is perfect, as long as the main language is english! Of course you can speak other languages in the guild. Myself I speak german
---
Aight, my hype died. If there's no German servers, I'm not going to play.
---
Def broken not how it was in vanilla. No way I'm going back to backpeddling 😂
---
&gt;Since parrying an attack decreases your swing timer, an additional +5% parry chance actually adds up to a dps bonus on its own too.
---
parry decreases swing timer???
---
Based on Stress Test #2 where we saw 8+ layers per continent.
---
fuck this shit. finally having a high quality german server was what i was looking forward to the most. english simply doesn't feel as comfortable and familiar for me, i'm sure that goes for most people and their mother language.
---
Raiding MC with 10-15 guildies and randoms with reserve on bindings was pretty common back in vanilla.
---
And yet I wouldn't want to play in English. In social settings I strongly prefer to speak my mother tongue. I will join whatever server turns out to be German, won't bother before.
---
Unless you are a developer for classic wow you can't possibly know this.
---
As you level up more and more you, you'll start to use cat form more and more for the faster running speed, stealth, and slightly faster damage dealing.
---
As we are looking at world pvp.  Nothing beats a rogue rogue druid.  Or rogue rogue rogue.  Triple ambush vanish triple ambush and it's a 3 v 1 fight.
---
Mage mage mage would also kill most other teams. Pom pyro 3 times kills every class.
---
Sheep to setup 3 pyros at once. 
---
There is just too much dps/ spike damage going on with one of those combos. 
---
Warrior is very weak untill high gear levels. 
---
Hunter/pally is a good choice. Mage as a third maybe for better dps and cc.
---
I think the combo of warrior hunter paly would be very weak In world pvp vs  skilled groups. If you are going around 3v1 then any combo will win fine.
---
Your extreme levels of ignorance make it impossible to have anything that resembles a productive conversation with you.  
---
I’ll just end this ‘discussion’ with you by reiterating my original point:
---
I’m glad cross realm BG’s will be in Classic.  They were a great addition to the game in Vanilla, and will be great for Classic as well.

I'm in the same boat.  My first level 60 was a druid, but I'm not sure I could bring myself to do it again.  Love the lore and concept of druid, hate the fact that I'm the worst at everything.
---
Not all items have instant respawn, the crates in the undead zone were 2-4min
---
same thing i replied a bit below:  
---
&gt;And to chat in english is something ENTIRELY different than talking english with them via teamspeak/discord etc. If i want to keep my guild/community a german-speaking community im effectively eliminating 80% of all the potential recruits on my server, assuming a perfect distribution of languages.
---
You're just a rusophobe.
---
Anyone defending it hasn't played Classic vanilla or TBC. Or, they have but only way back when they were out and can't remember it well. If they had played more recently on private servers, then they would understand how truly catastrophic layering is to the entire philosophy and core gameplay of Classic vanilla. If you're going to have layering, there is almost no point to even have Classic.
---
Spinebreaker! I remember those days! I didnt play back then but a friend of mine did, I remember that when i started playing we already got the spanish servers i think and I rolled on Zul'Jinn
---
&gt; and you can have 3 layers provisioned and running, you can have 100 or more running.
---
Isn't this a bit naive? "Just scale it bro" sounds like management speak to me.
---
I get that scalability is the big draw to using Virtuals over bare-metals, but isn't there always a cap to the amount you can scale to?
---
You can do whatever you and your group agree on.
---
It is. Isn’t it ?
---
Check the official classic forums, there's a thread with add ons that are being/have been ported to classic.
---
Curse hasn't thrown up an official classic site yet as far as I know.  
---
As far as what you can set up now?  Presumably the client won't change too much before launch so if you save your add on/interface folder you might be able to save anything you set up in beta/stress tests.
---
I see. I was thinking he wanted something that was level wide. Yeah you’re right if you go zone based it will be similar to sharding(if not sharding) the way it is now is fine. Maybe you can not switch layers unless in a capital city.
---
except people are not using 56 k/bit connections anymore, completely defeating the purpose of this mechanic and actually changing the game. 
---
Except he already addressed that in the video.
---
There are no english server.
---
78% alliance at level 40? Are those numbers correct?

---
I feel the same way. Its cheating in my eyes. 
---
MMOs are social games. If you buy yourself an alt and dual box you are undermining the social components of the challenge.
---
Best way to get a bre first is to be a streamer
---
I've been saying this from the start, but only now is this an acceptable opinion to have.
---
Shouldn’t be an issue as long as you are VERY upfront about what you will be rolling on.  Like if you plan on rolling on Felstriker, let the group know beforehand.  Shouldn’t be an issue most of the time since anyone else will basically be at the mercy of whether you will tank for them or not.  
---
Otherwise, don’t be a dick about a technical upgrade you didn’t have planned out to get.
---
I wasnt a cop when I was 14 haha. I mained a NE Rogue then, Ill main a NE Rogue now (was real into Niar videos lol). My alt was a pally tho, so of course I will have some Paladin Police fun.
---
There’s travel in your future when you hit level 30 and you get your travel form.
---
You will never be a rogue, always healing and crying about your class.
---
That's fine. I think for a lot of people they'll find gaming has changed a lot since they loved Classic, and a lot of the things they enjoy about modern gaming making Classic hard to enjoy now when played under a modern lense, but there are also a lot of us who dislike those things about modern gaming, and want Classic as it embraces older design philosophies.
---
Boy oh boy this post is aging verrrry well.. as i knew it would, LMFAO!!!!
---
Layering = Death of Classic
---
Yeah I saw your other comment a second or so later.
---
Thanks for trying to stay close to the facts, all of your comments are highly informative.
---
Mhh... not sure I mind it too much. I can live with English in globals.
---
Hmm I think this is the way to go. From other comments on this post, I got this idea as well:
---
As tank you should be the leader of the group and look for the party you want to run with. That way this kind of problem can be minimized and it wont get ugly.
---
I don't think a single person is saying that.
---
Such info. Many notes taken.
---
One word language-layering! :D
---
the correct answer is zergling.
---
&gt;Fueled by a lack of basic understanding of the technical limitations of making this tech work at this scale
---
No way one of the largest game studios in the world can support the infrastructure required to make a 15 year old game work smoothly on release. I'm sure the developers care about the project, I also don't think they fundamentally understand what makes classic WoW such a genuinely unique experience, and furthermore I don't think you understand that either.
---
Bob's Burgers in r/classicwow?! Yes please!!
---
Perhaps with layering they can count the times you've been on the same layer as another player and make you more likely to join a layer with people you've already been around before.
---
Vanilla servers have a life span of about 2 years for the hard core.6 months to a year for average. Why not just allow server transfers and consolidation for servers that started at the same time? It's not that complicated. Private servers have already done it for years.
---
Asmon consistently gets 30k plus viewers per stream
---
So group up. 20 groups competing isn't bad and it'll only last for a few days maximum. Meanwhile layering is lasting till level 60, till phase 2....
---
This makes me even more excited that I'm going to be going Rogue/Priest and play with someone going Shaman/Warlock.
---
And earning enough salary to buy gold for a mount in a few seconds/minutes/hours? Priceless.
---
Do items that change the character model also affect melee range?  If so:
---
Roll Tauren
---
Have World Shrinker fail
---
Get double grow buff from horde quest
---
Winterfell Firewater
---
Elixier of Giant Growth
---
Bloodlust
---
??? 
---
Profit
---
Opposite for me. I'm German and can't stand the community on English servers. I was excited to play on German realms. This will not be the vanilla experience I was looking for. I played on German realms as a teen and that's what I remember playing on, and that's what I want to re-live as much as possible. This ruins the experience for me a million times more than anything the "no changes crowd" complains about.
---
it's fine
---
Motherfuckers acting like they ain't never seen Barrens Chat.
---
Bump the level cap and open the BG!!
---
RIP classic EU.
---
Will have to brave the ping and play on NA servers I guess.  Real shame.
---
I dunno about you but I felt like the Belle of the Ball with my mini diablo out. Got like, 20 whispers about it.
---
Yes, and those problems were limited to high-population realms. There was no overload of the authentication and networking infrastructure: just specific overpopulated realms, which can be solved by players re-rolling on less populated realms.
---
Looks like no one has scanned pvp server horde side.
---
What swifty video is this referencing? I'm not familiar with his content
---
So, one noticeable problem: Mini Diablo has lighting applied, he should be full bright. Hopefully he still has his Minion and Lord of Destruction tags...
---
Incorrect. This applies to mobs in the game as well which in turn makes AOE'ing and kiting mobs extremely annoying.
---
Example with NPC's: https://clips.twitch.tv/AssiduousAmericanHyenaArsonNoSexy
---
There will not be low and medium pop, because they get merged into other servers, modern servers can hold 10s of thousands of players.
---
/r/Classicwow has turned so toxic. I don't really care if they play on my server or not. Why do so many posts on this subreddit have to be overwhelmingly negative?
---
Yeah but arent the servers 4 times bigger than in vanilla? I mean if those 3k germans play on a german server or english doesnt change much, i mean its still 3k.
---
And you might eliminate alot but there will be even more exclusively wanting to join. Theres a guy that started a guild named berlin On the pserver im currently playing on.
---
After a few hours we already were 37 members or smth.
---
I already recruited 4 guys just because we were in the same dungeon and they wanted to join a german guild.
---
I dont see much of a change except french in bgs typing "francais?"
---
Thats the moment i will be mad about it but today isnt that day.
---
Imagine slobbing on streamers all day
---
If they WERE planning to layer us more, wouldn't it make sense to downplay it as much as possible? 
---
As an analogy, ever hear a game company tout that there won't be any micro transactions or cash shop or paid DLC, only to find out otherwise upon release? Have you heard Facebook and Google claim that "privacy is important" to them?
---
HoJ is a well known BiS for so many classes, you almost have to expect that you'll be rolling against someone if it drops. That being said, it is courteous to state what you're rolling on in any given dungeon so just bring it up before you start the run.
---
15 years of tradition, unimpeded by progress.
---
Why not just keep it simple and use the "longest" wait time for a zeppelin? For calculating the travel time?
---
Nein! Das ist mein Breinhurst! Mein! Nein!
---
Because it's not done yet and things change. That doesn't make it a LIE.
---
I keep an EDH deck by my PC, just because I often brew at my desk, but I love having it at hand for any game where I might be waiting. 
---
Sat on a flight path? Waiting for my dungeon group to group up? Waiting on a spawn? Guess I'll just play a few practice hands. 
---
The only problem is I've been doing it while sat in a car on ARMA lately, or when I'm down, and when I get up I'm trying to figure out the right play and get shot again.
---
I would rather have queue and instability for the first two weeks than have layering at all.
---
He's probably the best mage to ever play the game lol
---
No.  It's like Blizzard, in their almost 30 years in the industry, clearly don't give two fucks about Europeans.  They have proven this time and time again, this latest insult is just another in the long line of bullshit we've had to put up with from them.
---
its gonna be weird going back to a rogue with no cloak again, exciting tho
---
Give Turkey their own server.
---
This is a horrible decision
---
From my experience leveling a few toons to 60 on private servers, there's merit to it, I would constantly pull aggro from bear tanks. The best tanks I had were warriors and then I had a couple really good shaman tanks.
---
It’s not that bad since you can get basically everything done within one raid night for the first year. By that time you know people and have a foundation for when 2 raid nights apparently makes people depressed and make them question the point of existing.
---
People are tied to the layer they're assigned. You can only move layers if you get invited by a friend to a party. 
---
Anything else like the clip on the OP (which didn't even show anything) is likely a bug that can be fixed. 
---
So you should still be seeing the same names around the world as you'll all default to the same layer every time.
---
I’m hooked
---
Ask again in 9 months.
---
This stress test is now, however I think I read on another post that one is coming up next month for EU, but don't quote me on that.
---
If the spellqueue window system stays in, that is also a large buff to melee (but also a nerf to CC chains)
---
I think they underestimate how little we like each other. Europe is like a big family. We'll protect and defend each other but spend more than an hour together and all hell breaks out.
---
Havent had the chance to pull the source but it was mentioned prior to the first stress test that this is how it would work. It might be in the developer Q&amp;A from one of the twitch streamers that got to attend the closed press summit.
---
Also seems like a sneaky confirmation that there will be no RP-PvP realms. Sad.
---
I don't understand why there are so many comments assuming people don't understand that.
---
I understand that, and I imagine a lot of the people proposing changes do as well.
---
I'm proposing they *change* the system to along the lines of what I've said. Because I think it would be a better system.
---
And not only did Ion originally imply it would be on a zone-by-zone basis at the early levels, before they decided to go with "layering", but also the combination of sharding and phasing on retail means they have the basic building blocks for the code to make this work.
---
They would be "sharding" the 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. versions/layers of a single server, and then phasing individual zones based on population within the zone instead of a quest/cinematic trigger.
---
Fuck I hope so.
---
They don't do it "just for launch". It's permanent and inherent to their core design.
---
He doesn't play retail. He was at the height of the ladder during WotLK
---
Somehow I managed to get four 6 clot pouches while leveling a druid in mulgore it was magnificent
---
You do know blizzard says they want to have layering removed in classic by the time the world bosses drop correct? They only plan on having it for 2-4 weeks after launch.
---
Whatcha think on the whole leeway thing? Keep it or boot it? Hmm
---
Absolutely. Just tell people up front and if anyone has a problem, kick em.
---
Better yet, invite clothies / casters and you won't have any issues. I will be tanking to collect gear and will be making my own groups.
---
Yep. Vanilla = world pvp. Layering hurting world pvp is bad.
---
Is normal.  I have a screenshot of one of those weeds over there for the quest that's floating in the air too.
---
you might be able to escape specific players by switching layers, but you'll just end up in another layer with enemy players. they also likely have a system in place where you can't switch layers while in combat, so if you're actively getting attacked, you can't escape so easily. ideally they'd also prevent you from changing layers for a minute after combat, but i haven't really thought about the implications of that.
---
36 days ago I suggested this EXACT THING!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/booozs
---
I was mocked, and down voted to hell.
---
Does this subreddit not know that streamers also existed on retail too?
---
Je vois pas le problème, en 2019 c'est tellement facile d'apprendre l'anglais (en traînant sur Reddit par exemple). De toute façon il y aura toujours des guildes francophones pour qu'on se regroupe donc ça risque pas de déranger. Blizzard voit sur le long terme et pour une fois prend une bonne décision. Si chaque langue avait ses propres serveurs -&gt; certains deviendraient morts au bout de quelque temps.
---
Tbh, if you’re in a guild that useless just gquit. The “good” guilds spend a lot less time on stupid shit like that.
---
Critical thinking is going extinct.
---
Can we at least report people for refusing to speak English?
---
Aren't you missing the point?
---
Orc stun resist is stupid good. Tauren war stomp and 5% more HP is pretty good. Berserking is good and could be so much better if it was just on a 2 min cd instead of a 3.
---
Perception isn't that good honestly and it has the same problem as berserking - 3 min cd. Which pretty much means that you HAVE to know there are rogues nearby to get any value out of it, and if that's the case then the rogue must be bad.
---
Stoneform is good, escape artist is great. Fear ward I don't count because then you need to count all the priest racials. Shadowmeld is super underrated in PvP in my opinion and is better than stoneform in my opinion.
---
Horde definitely have better PvP racials. But Paladin is way better in a group PvP setting than shaman.
---
0
---
This could be a real problem, imagine putting a fair few hours into levelling your character only to find there's very few guilds or even people who speak your language. You're left with two options, start over on another realm, which would be quite a downer, or you put up with it and miss out on the social side of the game. Language based servers were introduced for a good reason, I can't quite understand why they wouldn't keep that option for players.
---
Without a doubt the biggest problem, in my personal opinion, that Classic WoW has yet thrown up. I picked the wrong server during Vanilla, it's one of the few Vanilla experiences I don't want to recreate.
---
I don't think you understand the real bottleneck to the AQ event. It wasn't the scepter quest. It was the massive turn-in requirements of cloth, herbs, etc that had to happen on both horde and alliance side.
---
Servers that were horde or alliance dominated had to use the neutral AH to funnel mats to the opposite faction so the completion could progress.
---
Even if most servers turn out to be okay, there might be servers where half of the player base speaks french the other half german and anyone else has to go reroll on another server.
---
Even if people speak English if there's a too big majority of one nationality on a server it might turn that server into their own server and just speak their own language.
---
This happened even with the bigger languages separated where there were some servers that were designated national servers and most people didn't speak english not because they couldn't but because everyone else spoke their native language. There were servers where you logged on and everyone in trade chat was speaking Danish, Norvegian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish etc
---
That wasn't really that big of an issue because during TBC and Wrath we had lots of servers and the biggest countries had their own realms separated officially.
---
If it stays like this in Classic people will have a realistic chance of by accident rolling on a server where they won't understand 90% of what people are saying and they will be completely excluded from everything.
---
I played on an oceanic server and the 7h time difference was manageable, better than the US time difference imo. The only problem is that I was at college then and I can't really play in the mornings anymore.
---
Feels like people failing to see that casual guilds will demand more raid times and consums than hardcore guilds in a long run. Bwl and MC indeed easy but with casual guild problem starts with ZG and AQ. Even when AQ hits you will still raid Bwl and MC, its harder to do in casual guilds because of slower clear times. And more consums because of wipes and people need to carry deadweight in raids. Everything is easier,less time consuming and more organized in hardcore guild. Since your concern is gathering 40 man and limited raid nights you should consider non casual guilds. Hardcore guilds will Clear MC and bwl together in 2 hours max in BWL-ZG patch.
---
I’m in the same boat but don’t care. I’m just worried I’ll have dementia in old ago and confuse wow with my real life in the nursing home. “That nurse looks like Jains in disguise! Lok’tar ogar!”
---
I had three copies of the red hood you get in Hillsbrad as a quest reward because the server kept crashing and rolling my character back.
---
Cool. Hope I win the greed roll on that shield then! Those vendor for quite a bit you know!
---
considering leveling pace and that a lot of people have dual monitor setups now, they're gonna be insane
---
Just make mobs spawn faster,  not nodes or anything else.
---
Did I miss something? So we just gonna get EU servers and no specific regions like german or french servers?
---
This is kek
---
Nobody likes this decision. Literally nobody. It's the worst thing yet, by far. Not even the discussion about layering tops this.
---
You can copy a nick in
---
I guffawed on the pot while reading this and almost made a mess. Thanks for the funny/thoughtful feedback.
---
I have two classic MC stories. For our first, let's reminisce on Tanaris. Vast, barren, yet entrenched by an infestation of piracy. My Forsaken priest had arrived to exterminate, but my eyes beheld, for the first time, the mind boggling sight of a mage AoE grinding.
---
Only, thid mage, she was a *living* human. Well, she had her talents, I had mine. What ensued was a lengthy battle of attrition. I had managed to to keep myself healed, but did rather little damage.
---
Finally, I found myself baa-ing as she blinked away to the water. Foolish, for her, as I gave chase. Not through the watery depths, but floating above. Faster, I overtook her and started swimming downward myself. She was far below, and already heading upward. That was not a thing to be, however.
---
I had no fear down in these waters, my dead body cared little for the amount of air in my lungs. A trifle, really. I had all the leisure to remain as my spell took hold. Ensnaring her body and mind, I forced her back below, down down.
---
She drowned.
---
I had plenty of time to restock on air, wait, swim back down to see, and she had respawned.
---
Needless to say, she drowned again.
---
Whatever happened to her, I cannot say, but I love Mind Control.
---
That isn't leeway, tauren have extended hit/hurtboxes.
---
Funny, the main reason I'm rolling a priest was because I love dwarves. 
---
I saw the polls, but I would still be pretty shocked if that is true, especially in later levels. People don't like playing healers in general. Usually slower and lower dps when leveling. No big damage numbers.
---
I'd rather have to transfer a character or reroll than have world PvP abused by this.
---
&gt; MOST people will be a lot older
---
So...are some people not aging?
---
I am part of the old fan base as well. Blizzard doesn't care about retailer's having more enjoyment in vanilla than retail. In fact they want all players playing retail. 
---
Classic wow is being made to snag up the playerbase that refuses to play for a variety of reasons: LFD, Sharding, etc of reasons. 
---
You piss off the old fan base enough, they are just going to go right back to playing private servers now with a brand new developed format thanks to Blizz.
---
&gt;Well, I'm definitely biased because I fell in love with vanilla first.  Regardless of which endgame is best, the fact that they did nothing to preserve my favorite content kind of gives them a black eye in my book.  
---
I agree.
---
&gt;An "expansion" that shrinks the game isn't really an expansion.  It's another game placed on top of the corpse of the previous one.  TBC did the most damage, trivializing a full 60 levels of content.  You could argue that it was really just level 60 content since you could still level alts, but it was a barren wasteland compared to vanilla.  A barren wasteland that's supposed to be your home world of Azeroth.
---
Its true but how would you handle new content without making the old one kinda obselete? For me a worse offender are catch up mechanics within expansions that make any efforts early in the expansion seem futile. 
---
I do agree they could've handled the power creep a little bit better so older content could still be relevant. Any green gear from the first Outlands quest was miles better than any epic.
---
It wasn’t crazy hard, but there were times where I felt like AoE threat could be difficult if I couldn’t generate enough rage to spam Swipe. Usually it was just an early pull sort of thing, after that initial treat establishment I was fine. 
---
Single target tanking was never an issue, Furor let Maul be available at the start of the pull and from there rage wasn’t a problem. 
---
I never tanked raids, but I leveled from 25~ to 58 purely through tanking as a feral Druid in Vanilla. Had a static group with a mage, priest and rogue and we agreed to only level via dungeons. It was fun and I never ran into a situation I couldn’t handle as a tank. Granted we did sheep mobs and mark pulls.
---
Wait they are gonna layer classic? If so they are morons. Part of the fun is getting a group of 60’s and holding darkshire hostage!!!
---
&gt; Roughly 40% of the EU Retail player population isn't getting their own realms in Classic. Which, by all reasonable measurements, means Blizzard doesn't think 40% of the player population will be able to sustain even one realm in Classic.
---
This is not opinion.
---
Can someone explain what this means
---
Funny thing i reported that bug on the stress test. At that point it was below the ground... good fix lol
---
You're projecting your personal feelings onto the entire old fan base.  I'm saying your feelings don't necessarily apply to the entire old fan base.  Which of us do you think is more correct?
---
That's also true for EPGP and DKP tho
---
I'm not entirely sure if your first sentence is true...spending 2 hours trying to mob tag to get to level 5 is a uniquely painful experience in classic wow.
---
Its too funny. These people don't even realize they're the ultimate neckbeards, crying about the "authentic classic experience". Totally unaware... lol...
---
So you could cheat on your own. Pepega
---
Basing it off numbers doesn’t make your opinion more right. Based off the numbers on retail you’re not even close to being right. And your logic doesn’t help at all
---
I'm currently on holiday in your country and I don't find your people unpleasant at all but loads of em just can't speak English even when doing their best to help me with something.
---
What's the feasibility of an add-on that whispers you a translation of a detected language?
---
Then your wizard or cleric who didn't max dex gets left behind instead.
---
I haven't played WoW seriously in a long time.  Can someone explain "layering" to me?
---
LoL isn't toxic to french. French people who come into games and refuse to speak english even if literally the rest of the team is speaking english or just a majority are rude af. If you don't understand English then just don't speak, like half of the english speaking population do anyway.
---
No one is inherently toxic against french, but many people have had horrid experiences with the french on LoL.
---
Leeway and Layering, the last 2 enemies classic wow has.
---
I dont like it cause it possibly changes meta. Idk if they can but should be resetted.
---
But i wouldnt be mad if it stays in classic.
---
Then again not giving separate language realms is a much bigger punch in the face for me than some mechanical aspects into the game
---
How about as soon as u leave starting zone
---
Can't wait to start leveling on a realm for two weeks then feel forced to reroll because apparently the server I picked became the unofficial french realm
---
I have a group of friends going Alliance that I plan to play with. It was a group decision... mostly because one of my friends is dead-set on Holy Paladin.
---
Apparently they were more aggressively layering on 3 and had larger layers on 15 or something like that.
---
We were on 15 and we started stress test late because we had work stuff go late.
---
It was hell. Until we got to the barrens, but that's probably because everyone else was still stuck or gave up.
---
I like that
---
Streamers save servers
---
Not a problem, all ppl from Germany and France talks english now.
---
rip all EU servers
---
dear lord cotton mouth. No amount of sheer water alone can out-class the weed + jerky combo in isolation
---
Whats the next best thing from a frost mage? In terms of having the ability to solo instances for gold, solid pvp class that  has alot of outplay to come out of top in 1vX.
---
You forget something about frenchmens, we have a horrible accent naturally, i my self can speak english relatively well but i will do it very rarely cause this accent that i have just disgusts me i can just hear my self it sounds so dumb and i cba taking an american accent even tho i could cause it just sounds fake as fuck it bothers me alot i think im mentally ill lmao.
---
Depends on the country, most latin countries don't speak english well. The difference in being *able* to communicate and being fluent in the language is quite big, so for some the interactions will be quite limited and the depth of the conversations quite shallow.
---
I was quite psyched to return to my country's community, being able to do guild meet ups, talking about current affairs of the country, grouping up with a random person and finding out they live 20 miles away. It really adds to the community, rather than the "lowest common denominator" that servers become when you mix everyone.
---
Yall need to understand this...  the game cannot work without this "feature," period.  The only way to get rid of it is to go back to single servers like they had back in the day.  It will never be turned off.  They are lying and full of shit to say otherwise.
---
Germans are the second biggest community after the english ones. I wholeheartedly believe that germans would fill at least 7-10 servers (i predict server caps being at 5-6k) for their own. French is the third and russians the fourth biggest community those will also fill at least 4-5 servers. The hype is immense.
---
Most of the playerbase won‘t even have a reddit account to sub here and yet we still managed to reach 140k subs!!! 140k / 5k (server cap) = we would fill 28 servers with just our subs.
---
Your class choice is probably most important in the game.  This should be researched pretty thoroughly before you pick.  For example you might pick a druid because you think cats are cool to dps, but when you get to end game it will be really hard to get into a raid in that role.  If you don't plan on doing anything endgame then it doesn't matter as much.
---
Things like bindings are usually reserved for someone in particular (main tank for bindings specifically)
---
That's where the streamer's fans come in: they *provide* all the required materials for the streamer and his friends, in all servers.
---
This is exactly what I advise to those I know who actually wants to learn. I play video games in English since i'm a kid, and it worked really well.
---
Quest links don't show up as just plain text on Classic so that will be a problem
---
As mush as i dislike streamers the dude wasnt 1 shotted or i must be blind then
---
You're right to a point; there will be legitimate long term players turned off by the overcrowding if it gets too bad, and then the feeling of being left behind seeing people far ahead of them.
---
Just don’t take Hand of Justice and you’re okay in my book :)
---
Why even have layering? Bring the chaos. Bring the mayhem.
---
You just don't like what the numbers show. Numbers don't lie.
---
i'm sure blizzard shareholders feel the same way about how well current wow is doing - you think they'd care?
---
You people want vanilla that isnt vanilla.  Vanilla sucked so bad.  Sometimes you couldn't quest because a whole zone was being griefed by high level papers.  Sometimes there were too many people.  The only option was to play a different character.   Or not play.  That was what the game was like.  The first year of the game was difficult to level up because of other players making your life hard.  Only way around it was to do dungeon groups.  And it took like an hour to get a group to the dungeon sometimes.  Hell, in wailing caverns it took like 30 minutes to fight mobs to the entrance.  BRM was camped so you had to corpse hop to it and it took an hour.   This is what the game was like.  Half the abilities you had weren't even useful on many classes.  Or broken.  You had to beg for money to repair your shit sometimes because you had no money from repairing from all that shit.
---
Bring people who don't need it, if it's the only option inform them that it will be a roll off, if they don't like that they can leave
---
Heaven forbid you make friends by venturing out instead of trying to do every ! like it's a theme park!
---
Imagine using imagine unironically.
---
Hunter/warlock
---
I don't know why I find this so funny
---
Yeah thats what greed roll is for
---
Thanks, I did mot know that as horde only player.
---
What about chests and mobs?
---
You people want vanilla.  That was vanilla for the first year.
---
So the best way is Garrote &gt; SSx2 (I suppose better because the energy increase for backstab isn't worth it on plate?) &gt; Rupture. And then Deadzone kite and/or vanish and reopen with more bleeds?
---
This is hilarious and real but I just can't help but feel sorry for this poor dude every damn time I see him in a meme.
---
Seeing how bad sharding is on retail (and I still play and like retail), I really dont want any compromise on it.  
---
I'd rather take lags and crashes from time to time instead of a system that even resembles sharding.
---
not many people go from high pop to low pop.  most players are moving to the high pop realms with better raiding guilds from under populated realms.  that is the current trend of wow population migration.
---
Just wanted to share that video. We can see my shadow priest @6:16 :)
---
Yeah dude. People acting like enjoying the game and immersing yourself in the story is needed and you can't just kill boars to level 60.
---
Cyka Blyad!
---
this works fine in SWTOR (instances in their case) and general chat is still global.
---
and it doesn't mean you will never see some people just sometimes you won't in the open world. leave an area and enter again and you may get a different mix. general chat is always there to group up if needed.
---
swtor does not do it as seamlessly as wow does in videos ive seen, there is a loading screen for layer shift. as well you can see how many layers your area has and can freely switch between them if not full, switch too many times and you get a timer.
---
The whole plan to get rid of layering is just to consolidate everyone onto one layer. So the solution is just to have everyone lvl 30+ forced onto the one layer
---
World of Layercraft!
---
Again, if a precedent is set there's a chance blizzard enjoy's and likes that solution so much we'll be stuck with it long term or for the rest of the classic releases (BC and WoTLK classic etc). What I'm saying lets just avoid it all together even if the launch is terrible to get a the most classic wow game we can *long term*. My thinking is long term, not simply the launch which only lasts a week.
---
Why tf can't people just use english? Ever since the early 00s I've been forced to use english whenever I play online, ain't nobody creating a bloody *Swedish* server for my snowflake ass.
---
I refuse to believe someone who is wanting to play classic long-term will quit and never return because they can't kill mobs on the first few days of a launch.
---
Layers prevent name and guild clashes. The original intention behind them was to essentially be separate servers within the server (capped to 3k players which is similar to vanilla servers).
---
The only issues I'm seeing is with the layer changing on party invite, which can be fixed.
---
Fixing these cases is better than just scrapping the whole system as it's solving a real problem we'll have otherwise.
---
You’d need access to a database of languages, so if you have access to that pretty easy. Otherwise, pretty hard.
---
Excellent points.
---
People here seem to forget that Blizzard is a business selling a service, and if people are so frustrated by overcrowding and other issues, they will stop paying for that service. 
---
Blizzard will take measures to ensure that there is an enjoyable play experience in the first few weeks, and no amount of complaints is going to change that.
---
I'm really quite surprised at the number of people who have deluded themselves into thinking queuing for servers and waiting for mobs is fun.
---
Probably because it makes sense.
---
You don't call healer hps either.
---
I don't want to be hired by blizzard, I want them to listen to their community and not their shareholders.
---
That's how it looks in pug raid on retail. Just add Russian.
---
&gt; Then WHY are we doing layering?! 
---
So you can play the fucking game on launch.
---
You can also literally rob people and get rich IRL, but its maybe not a great idea?
---
It wasn't even reserve. They were asking if ANYONE wanted it other than me because I was a friend / pug. Issue was because they had like 4 of that one drop, so they felt like no one would have ever gotten the other binding for it as they would be 4th in line. 
---
Just so happened the opposite was true of my guild, so if they had allowed me to take it I would have basically been guaranteed a TF. Which had been my dream since I rolled warrior. I am absolutely certain that hunter never got that other binding and even if he did, might have never finished the quests anyway.
---
If they find something being abused, they can add it to the debuff.
---
In vanilla.
---
"Story". 
---
&gt; you can't just kill boars
---
This is especially funny, because the first few quests boil down to "kill boars" for the most part.
---
Group up for grinding? Sure, enjoy 5xp per mob. You are going to level blazing fast.
---
I would take private server leveling with a grain of salt. We already know that private servers were making feral druids too strong while level. I wouldn't be surprised if the same happened with other classes.
---
Its very possible I was simply terrible back when Vanilla came out, but I remember an elite mob my level being very lethal.
---
This breaks everything for me! I cancel my vacation etc  and my hype is gone
---
I agree, it's so exhausting. I come to this subreddit to embrace a good game and have fun, not to whine 24/7 like a goddamn infant.
---
yeah, like you say in your edit, communicate when you form the group or let them know when you're joining. that's what i used to do. for BRD, when farming from HoJ, for example, i'd form the group and if a rogue was to join or something i'd make sure he didn't need it. we'd also have like a 1 blue per run rule (lol). kind of a gentlemen's agreement not to roll need on a blue if you already got one, when pugging 5 mans.
---
I cannot see how this is a better solution with all the issues we’ve seen. Original release did just fine with queues and a wide realm selection. Why can’t we have it the same way and combine like realms down the road if population issues call for it. Layering makes the game less organic so they have less logistic issues that they are very capable of handling.
---
Dungeons don't really drop tank specific gear until into the 40s anyway. 
---
As others have said, make it clear up front what you intend to do. Don't bring other melee if you don't want to fight over drops, etc.
---
If the group has another warrior or paladin then expect them to be rolling on the dps &amp; tank gear as well.
---
They should layer lvl 30-60 zones. That way the good players get to use the new mechanics and bad people dont.
---
damn that gold exchange quest I was trying to kill kobolds for what seemed like hours lol
---
I can't remember - was the recruit a friend Zhevra Vanilla or BC? Cause I will ride that all day long.
---
You don't get it ... if i ask you to come with me to "Les lamentations", you will never understand i'm speaking to the Wailing Caverns, and nothing to link here ...
---
I just did level 3 mobs by myself since everyone was stuck at trying to kill wolves at the dwarf/gnome start.
---
Yeah, it looks like the spawn point is inside the tree. When a mob spawns, it takes a few seconds to agro if you are close enough.
---
Yeah i see u mate. I absolutely never considered blizz would fuk up realms like this. I mean i didnt think they Were THIS dumb. Authenticity was the keyword they used for classic over and over again....tell me if mixed realms are authentic...
---
Well maybe they think classic is going to have a low playerbase long term. With mixed realms i think layering will stay active longer or maybe even forever. Or they even dont want it to? Cause bfa gives more money,you know. ( sounds a bit like conspiracy tho)
---
It’s not hard, all you need is a slow fall and a growth potion. Right at the entrance there’s a pipe that you stand on and find the tightest spot. Once you have you use the growth pot and hop through the wall off to the right of the instances entrance, use slow fall and bam you’re in the underside of the world. Then you run to your left a bunch and there’s “old Outland” it’s nothing huge but it’s cool
---
I would bet Blizzard is worried about server populations.
---
Just choose dead server then. It wouldn't have layers.
---
I am!
---
Yess, worse cast scenario is actually a great idea! I'll update this once I find that out :)
---
People understand the Pros of layering just fine it's just that they don't think it outweighs the Cons. You're free to disagree but don't misrepresent it.
---
You will be suprised how much toxicity will develop from mixing all european languages, it's exactly the opposite from what you want.
---
I'm out of the loop-- what's layering?
---
Not true.  You can log off and back on and be on a different layer.  The same guy has clips mining the multiple nodes by jumping on another character, then jumping back on the other... and the mining mode was back.
---
Nothing bothers me more in an MMO than having to deal with multiple languages on one server. I'm in the UK but I'll be playing on the NA servers because I'm not going to dedicate 1 month of my time to a realm only to find out its some unofficial German realm or something like that.
---
Ib4 someone makes a French version with Omelette Du Fromage
---
Yeah, the language is going to be a problem for sure.  I'm a native English speaker in the EU, you bet your ass I'm going to connect to US servers.
---
By living in the greatest world in the galaxy. The United states planet of earth.
---
Think about it. Classic is coming out and most people are pissed because they are stuck at work not playing the beta while all the streamers are getting paid to play the beta. The envy is oozing
---
That's the most entitled thing I've seen today...
---
&gt; Original release did just fine
---
ok sure bud, so lets just not change anyting then! this guy knows whats up. Absolutely pathetic logic.
---
I dunno man, I remember when Steve Irwin died. So many new hunters with puns on his name walking around with pets named Stingray. Anonymity always brings out the worst in people, no matter the era.
---
Yes. This is my current experience on Beta.
---
well Ill stick to North America
---
They just announced not to provide separate language realms.
---
Yes, most EU players are proficient in English. Most.
---
But there absolutely will be people who only won't to communicate in their native tongue and they WILL flock to realms and there WILL be unofficial [language x] realms. And if you didn't get the notice - realm transfer of your unofficial french realm are only 15€, what a bargain!
---
Also think about trade chat. When you link items in WoW, it uses your client's language. So if you're looking for that sweet 4str 4stam leather belt, be sure to look out for "Cintura di Cuoio Silvano", "Ceinture sylvestre en cuir", "Waldledergürtel" and of course "Cinturón de cuero de bosque" respectively.
---
I liked the video, but you don't offer any source, so we have to believe you that dungeons are faster than questing.
---
Pretty sure the popularity of pirated vanilla servers for the past 10 years did that.  Not a stupid petition.
---
Ha well if it was just layering, I hope they layer like 3 and not 15 then when the game launches. There was just enough competition for me to adjust my play to compensate and struggle to get out of the zone, but not enough for me to get stuck.
---
&gt; Yeah cos it's totally not like Ewan Mcgregor is the only major cast member to play their character at a level that isn't absolutely god awful.
---
Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Sam Jackson, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee are/were all outstanding actors, every bit as good as McGregor. The difference being McDiarmid had actually played the emperor in Ep. VI while McGregor had an extra point of reference for how to play his character in Alec Guinness, which is why their performances stood out so much. Neeson, Portman, Jackson and Lee were simply left to do the best they could with the crap sandwich Lucas had handed them.
---
&gt; As opposed to the wonderfully written romance between Anakin and padme in Attack of the Clones, yes.
---
See above.
---
&gt; And Anakin and Luke *definitely* aren't natural ability masters with less training than most jedis unlike Rey
---
Luke was a talented pilot with a strong affinity for the Force. He was also a whiny teenager who got BTFO'd by a single sandperson and who had to train with Yoda for several months before he was able to tap into and wield the Force to any significant degree. He also had to have his ass pulled out of the fire multiple times by those around him throughout the course of A New Hope.
---
Rey is not only talented but unnaturally adept at absolutely everything she tries her hand at. She's a better fighter than Finn, a better mechanic than Chewie, a better pilot than Han, a better duelist than Kylo and a better Force user than Luke. Our *introduction* to the character presents her as independent, self-sufficient and able to simultaneously fight off multiple attackers, each of whom is larger than herself. From there she continues to never need anyone's help with anything, perfectly extricating herself from every situation with virtually no complications.
---
There's no character progression. No development or improvement of any kind. No real motivation beyond a vague desire to "do the right thing."
---
That is *textbook* Mary Sue.
---
&gt; Jesus, dude just say "I watched the prequels when I was young and I learned from previous Star Wars fans to hate new stuff and parrot dumb criticisms I read on the internet and never gave a second of critical thought to" . At least then you'd be honest and could have a shred of dignity.
---
I watched the prequels as a teenager and thought they were garbage. I hated what Lucas had done to Star Wars just like everyone else. I was elated when he sold Lucasfilm to Disney and crowed from the rooftops when it was revealed he basically had no active involvement in TFA. I also hated what Abrams had done to Trek but I felt Wars was more his style and was excitedly looking forward to him righting the ship and setting the franchise back on course.
---
And I was *wrong.*
---
I've never said the prequels are good movies. Quite the opposite, in fact. I *explicitly* said they're terrible films, and I hold to that even now. I repeat, however: for all their many, *many* flaws, they still *feel* like Star Wars. The grand scale, the visual style, the characterization, the philosophy, the soap opera drama; it's all there, weighed down as it is by the terrible writing and direction.
---
The Force Awakens has none of that. It doesn't feel like Star Wars. It feels like a generic Hollywood action blockbuster wearing a fancy Star Wars costume. It has great production values, it looks incredible, and it feels completely and utterly *soulless.*
---
What a friggin desaster! Classic lives and breathes through the feeling of having one big community on a realm, where players get reputation in the realm and groups are forming across the whole faction. But this only works if everybody is speaking the same language. People with toxic behaviour can't get a bad rep if a huge language barrier exists across the realm. When you are looking for a group for challenging content you will have to look not only for classes and good players, but even the friggin language!
---
Even though I can communicate in english without problem, I just don't want to be forced to play a game in english and talk in discord/teamspeak in english to communicate with your groups/raids for success.
---
Also imagine what a big slap in the face this is for people who can't speak english. 
---
Who the hell thought this is a great idea. We will pay 12€ a month for classic so there's a no reason to go the "it will reduce server cost" way. The German and the French community is without doubt big enough for their own realm.
---
Also you can skip the whole RP realms if you force multilanguages in. Roleplays is all about the nuances in the language, this will not work in a foreign language.
---
40 consistent raiders was a lot easier to find than 25 competent raiders in BC and beyond.
---
Glad there's private servers for every big european language!
---
I bought gold twice but on the second time my account got a 7 day ban so I never bought gold again lol
---
Unpopular opinion time. With how layering and sharding can be exploited(I know most people won’t but possibilities exist) I’d rather just play it like, dare I say is, classic wow... I accept the too many people looking to kill the same quest NPC thing
---
Excuse me, but we called it "Spinebroken".
---
&gt; We arent talking world PvP, we are talking early levels.
---
This is a fallacious argument. We are *not* just talking about early levels, because layering does not only effect early levels. It will be in the game for potentially months, long after many people are level capped. Wormholer btw.
---
I wonder if blizzard would at least be kind enough to offer free transfers off of a server that becomes an unofficial non-English server.
---
We have indeed 2 weeks to fogire out which servers they claimed. I hope we will find out that way. Best thing will be that Blizzard will make atleast 1 on the big languages (german/french)
---
If that would be their plan why not split languages? They will make 2 eu PvP servers, if they'd do 4 they could do one french, English, spanish, German. They want to host less servers than 4 that's why they don't split languages
---
WPvP will not be a thing.  If a group of people raid something, you could just ask for a group on another layer and poof, they're gone!   
---
Guild battles, wiping on the way to raids, same thing.. won't be a thing.
---
You doomsayers are so fucking pathetic, holy shit lmao.
---
Weird, because I had a much easier time leveling a few druids to 15 on the stress test than I have on Lights Hope.  I've finally figured out what class I want to play, so I've been repeatedly running druids from 1-10, 1-20, etc getting a handle on the early Mulgore quests I'm not super familiar with, and I feel like the beta is way easier as a low level druid.
---
I don't think this can be enforced while people pay to play there, you can't really force them to not use native language after work. I agree this would be better then having a mixed world chat but idk it's  just a shitty situation.
---
Yeah, layers in 1-12 is like the most benign thing about layers.
---
Lmao the nochanges movement is in shambles.
---
Retail realms don't matter though. You can be on a completely dead realm and sharding will make it irrelevant.
---
If retail realms worked like classic, a lot of realms would be merged together.
---
The circle-hate-jerk is mad here. 
---
How much money will Asmongold make off this fine piece of art?
---
What if there are only 5-6 realms?
---
Super cool!
---
The servers wont be stay "big" for a long time, blizzard plans to remove layering and having a normal classic server population like it was back then.
---
youre right with your second point though, but not every german guy is looking exclusively for a german guild, so our recruitment pool still gets narrowed down, maybe not by 80% though.
---
The amount of mis-information here is mind boggeling
---
Sub is fine to level once you hit 30 as before level 30 you are missing out on hemo
---
Its not uncommon to see many classes respec at level 30(or higher), and its only like 1 gold, which isnt much at past level 29
---
Hemo isnt bad compared to combat leveling its just not as fast, and since esports has become a thing and theorycrafting things is common in almost every game, its become gamer culture to min max everything
---
Leveling sub daggers isnt undoable, but at the end of the day, you cant sneak up on every mob, and even if you can it doesnt mean your going to kill them faster as even with sidestabbing it is insignificantly faster than just using a dagger (and classic wont have side stabbing)
---
Since you asked for a spec i would personally level with something LIKE these 2 but i wouldnt use them as exact guides, as you might want differant talents than i do
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-30205521000201502-500153100330101
---
TL:DR go down sub, grab hemo, and prep and imp sap, then go down combat grabbing precision riposte blade flurry and endurance
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/325220105001-302002-500153100330101
---
TL:DR for this spec is after grabbing hemo and prep and imp sap is to grab gouge then go down assassination grabbing dmg talents before grabbing cold blood
---
Honestly while leveling it is really upto you how you want to level, what talents you grab are honestly fine, and you could even get to 60 without ever spending a talent point if you really wanted
---
PS: the 2 specs above have me choose master of deception over oppotunity and not grab imp ambush, if you want to make the macros amd carry a dagger on you, you can ambush out of stealth for really high damage then swap to a sword for hemo
---
PPS:hemo doest actually require a sword, any weapon is fine (except daggers and fist weapons)
---
If you have any questions feel free to ask
---
Like FF14 EU servers. Some servers are known for their german or french community, people just choose them if they really don't want to speak english, or avoid them if they don't like a particular community. 
---
I survived on a server mostly populated by germans, stop freaking out guys, you'll be sehr gut.
---
Why would I lie about my experience on the stress test servers? I'm logged in right now, character name is Reiker.
---
Yeah it took slightly longer to hit level 2. Big fucking deal, it's simulating a server launch, of course it's going to take a little longer.
---
That's how I feel about people who pay for cable though, and there's way more if those.
---
blocked by my work but would love this info come go live time. i prefer being on the underdog side of a server.
---
Did we all not just watch evidence of that?
---
MVP
---
Except it will....
---
I dunno guys, private servers have huge populations and i've never seen language problems except for Chinese, whom you just cant read. Sure there are language guilds, but still, let's wait and see just how small the classic realms will be for specific nations to have an impact on them.
---
Are you out of touch or is it the kids that are wrong?
---
"According to current "pserver" databases" this statement just invalidated everything else you said.
---
You cant do much before release.You will be able to purchase a realm-transfer some months after release. This way blizzard soaks up more money out your pockets.
---
This reminds me of a nightmare Dughan saw during the book Stormrage (set between the fall of lich king and cataclysm). Almost everyone in the world were forced into a sleep by the emerald nightmare and one of the stories to make it sound menacing was a nightmare that dughan who lived in goldshire had. (everyone in goldshire had fallen victim to the nightmare)
---
They were basically going to clear out one of the mines to get rid of kobolds and the mage in their group ended up being a necromancer who revived the dead kobold and eventually everyone in the party died horribly in pitch black darkness torn apart by undead kobolds with nowhere to go.   
---
But it was just a nightmare they saw... so hes still alive!
---
Worth it!
---
Almost everyone that doesn't speak english as their native language IS capable of speaking english but that should not mean we have to. I find it quite funny that you are bashing on "if you don't have the brain for a second language" when it is actually the english speaking people who generally "don't have the brains", brainsas you like to say it, because it is you guys who can only understand one single language.
---
Did you really grinding mobs in a game to something that is illegal in the real world?
---
Not gonna lie when I first started in dec of 04. My buddy let me hop on his account and make a guy real quick. Items were dropping left and right. I was blown away too cause I could use them. They were useful. So different than other MMO’s at the time where generally the only drops you got were vendor fodder. Granted I know now that those grey items are just vendor fodder but...
---
Not all gold farming operations are the same. The one I visited was pretty high scale they had leather couches.
---
I actually really like this.
---
No one mentioned anything about it being unplayable. The stress test wasn't close to being unplayable, neither was Nostalrius when it launched a single server with no dynamic spawns or sharding.
---
The problem is that people just make this shit up with no experience or logical reasoning.
---
man, i remember watching this for the first time. also the orangemarmalade 1v2 was pretty insane.
---
I never played classic with rose tinted glasses, it has always been a far better game than what modern retail wow has become. Way better social atmosphere, and far greater sense of accomplishment will always be enough for me.
---
Leeway is literally a classic mechanic.
---
Correct. So far the most data was collected by myself and you can only login to one faction on a pvp realm.
---
When's pt2 coming out?
---
entirely missing the point, nice! :)
---
Sadly I watched some roofers working with 0 safety gear on a brand new housing development.
---
One of them had a misstep that turned into a stumble off the 2 story (but really 3 because the backyard was a decline.  Right onto his back.
---
Now he's a quadriplegic.  (I don't know what his longterm diagnosis was, i hope he was able to improve from his initial paralysis).
---
OSHA rolled in for several days.  We were the excavation crew very separate from these roofers, but everyone was of course on their safety game for those 3 days.
---
Sure we cut a few corners but we still never put anyone in danger.  Those roofers... went back to 0 safety after OSHA left despite their coworker's example of what could happen.
---
I'm glad I never worked with that crew again.  That's insane to me.
---
Okey :p
---
But don't you think that they would have made some kind of announcement if they increased reputation gains by 50-60% in a patch? I feel like that's a substantial change that would have warranted mentioning.
---
This is true. Zone-specific phasing is sharding. Layering is server wide phasing (each continent has its own server).
---
I appreciate the effort for a great leveling experience, but limit layering to level 30 zones as this sub has pointed out.
---
Nice video. but nothing beats [Harryp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA7_1XTaLi4) IMO.

I just did a deep dive into this (Vanilla Datasets/Databases) and I cannot find a single source that does **not** list them as having the Database Rep as listed. So this may be a legitimate bug, or at least you've made a very convincing case and they should review it on the reference client/server.     
---
Overall well written argument.
---
&gt; I don't know if they can do layering by zone
---
That's called sharding, and is the default in retail.
---
afaik it is an evolution of phasing from WoTLK, where they mostly used it to tell more compelling stories by actually changing the world through your actions, they used instanced zones for this.
---
the idea of layering is that the entire continent (continents?) is sharded/instanced, each carrying up to a maximum server population. (somewhere between 2.5-3.5k players)
---
it is _mainly_ done to prevent dead servers down the line; once the majority of people leave, you simply merge the layers rather than end up with dead servers.
---
If used to combat early launch rush, we might end up with 500k+ player servers, containing many layers.
---
Gnome warlock or dwarf hunter?
---
Perfect private server feeling right there :D
---
Layering and cross realm are very different things. With CRZ I move around between zones and shards seeing different people as i do but i have no reason to interact with these people. They aren't from my server I have no reason to group with them no reason to add them to my friends list no reason to inquire about guilds with them. I can't trade with them I can't build a long term relationship with them.
---
With layering you can do all of these things. Sure you may not be in the same layer as them the whole time but you are on the same server as them the whole time. You can always add them to your friends list, add them to your guild, or mail them mats that you not need.
---
Not great. Not terrible.
---
This is exactly why i don't want layering. People to interact with, and a lot of them.
---
It's a bot programmed to make a dad joke, so no it probably didn't read it. Or at least it doesn't understand what it read.
---
We spent like 1 or 2 hours on the echo isles. It was insanity.
---
hormonal rage, either way
---
I'm not surprised if they would ask full price.. honestly :D
---
Venruki got rank 1 in tbc so...
---
Yea lol.  Dunno what i was doing on my shaman back then.  But it was before tempest keep that i lost my account.
---
Of course they are being humble about it. Otherwise the implication will be that the 95% of staff who work on retail are incompetent and need to be fired, which is essentially what is going to happen...
---
Sorry if you feel that I'm being combative but I don't care if you want layering, sharding, dual respecs, or a barbershop; I'm going to make an argument to preserve the integrity of the game that I enjoy every time.
---
There's many MMOs that have those things. There will be 1 Classic WoW. I want it to be fun for the specific niche of players that it's designed for. No compromises.
---
That is better, but still creates logistic issues.  What if one of the pre-grouped servers ends up huge, and the other is small?  The big one doesn't need a merge, and merging it would completely overwhelm the identity of the smaller server even more than a merge of (roughly) equal sized servers.
---
Ultimately, if the layering tech and mechanics get ironed out, there won't be any issues and everything will be perfect.  Honestly, that's probably not likely and there will be some issues, but I expect Blizzard to minimize the most egregious layering problems as the beta progresses, and ultimately leave it active for as short as possible after launch.  They honestly can't be thrilled with all of the problems and exploits we're reporting, but if push comes to shove, in-game jank for a couple of weeks is better than a completely unplayable mess.
---
You mean it hasn't been there for 15 years?
---
I can't wait for classic. OG collectors unite!
---
If classic WoW fails then WoW will fail .
---
Saying "I think they are going to mess up classic" is pessimistic. 
---
Saying "I think they scheduled a stress test to fake a lack of interest so that they can move resources away from the project" is conspiratorial.
---
more like 45 people with no-shows
---
So "layering but not layering"
---
okay
---
I am from a german speaking guild and upon hearing the "news" we have already started grouping together with many of the other already known german guilds in order for us to all move to one server and make it german. There is no doubt in my mind that until classic comes out, you will be able to know which servers will have been "claimed" by which languages (at least predominantly based on existing guilds).
---
Except for the interview with the lead game designer that said weeks...
---
Ahhh, yeah, you're absolutely right. What's Blizzard's stance on add-ons that call out to external services? I didn't even think about that and I'd assume that's against ToS
---
&gt; I would never trust online petitions where people just sign it and you cant tell if they'd actually pay. 
---
Which private servers required you to pay again?
---
I was an admin for a private wow server(Nostalrius) &amp; have seen the numbers. If I remember correctly something around 80% of characters were under level 20, not including characters under level 5 to avoid counting people who created an account then instantly quit
---
I remember that. Being a huge Warcraft fan I just ran around the different areas.
---
If you login with an NA/Oceanic account that has active time, you should get in.
---
you could do that, but how are you going to control the population then? Afaik they want to use layering for a few things:  
---
1. Make sure that the realm pops are kind of original, by capping each layer at around that cap.  
---
2. Make sure the launch experience isn't the total shit show it was 14 years ago with lag, server crashes, queue's, basicly unplayable at some points. This is one of the things Blizzard has always said about that it wasn't something they want to repeat.  
---
Now you can ofcourse disable layering at like lvl 20, but how do you control the population, i mean you don't want non original population numbers on a server, so then you need to start queueing ppl. Some players won't mind this, other players will, just because 14 years later they aren't kids anymore but have a job, a family and other stuff to do aside from waiting at the PC untill they are allowed to play by Blizzard.  
---
Layering / Sharding isn't great for Classic far from even, the alternative however also won't be acceptable for a lot of players.
---
Was stuck on a German FF14 server, it was awful
---
FPS capped to 10 in raids and big cities.
---
So you would rather RUN to the dungeon entrance than use LFG tool?????? yOu ThInK yOu Do BuT yOu DoNt
---
Just get the fuck out of this forum.
---
Both. I am very comfortable projecting that about the old fan base. More than likely they are going to be part of the no changes crowd. I do think there is a subset of players like you but its much easier to put money on the No Changes and Private server crowds past actions.
---
Who believes that lmao
---
If you are an idiot, I suppose.
---
No. Just make swapping Layers impossible to control or predict. Let's say Character A is logged in and on Layer 2:
---
1. If Character A logs out or quits the game, upon returning, they will be placed in Layer 2.
---
2. If an Alt of Character A logs in, they will be placed in Layer 2 no matter what Layer they were in before.
---
3. If Character A joins a group with a character in a city or on a flightpath, that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
4. If Character A joins a group with a character drastically lower level, that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
5. If Character A is engaged in PVP combat, temporarily suspend Layer swapping for any and all party members until the PVP combat is finished.
---
6. When 3 &amp; 4 are not available, the group members that get Layered or don't, will be completely random at first. Once the decision is made, leaving the group and rejoining always forces the same decision.
---
7. Always force guild members and friends on the same Layer upon logging in, otherwise ignore these changes.
---
This (and probably a few other rules) would completely eliminate the ability to abuse Layering in a time efficient manner.
---
I mean dude had a bad moment for sure but generally he's a beast from watching a couple of his streams.
---
Brain fart maybe? 
---
I smoke weed so I have an excuse when I fuck up.
---
True, however client/server offsets back in the days were far much severe. (for what it was needed)
---
This time arround, it just doesnt feel right in my opinion. At least when watching open pvp on streams the attack range sometimes really feels insane.
---
I think they also underestimate queues. I've seen "this or 10 mins in queue" as an argument. They should realize that if 5 layers is active, the alternative is 80% people in a queue at any given time (so queue time equal to 4 average game sessions)
---
Might be different for Horde with windfury which doesn't work on bears. For Alliance a feral tank will pretty much always do more threat than a warrior unless the warrior i dual-wield fury.
---
Yeah games too, as in kids games, but I used to always turn on English just bc it sounded cooler and better.
---
There definitely is. Frost mages for one can hop layers to get camps to respawn.
---
God this subreddit is turning into such a toxic circlejerk. Makes me wonder what the hell the mods are doing.
---
They can't easily change it back because it's 2 months until release and they've already swapped to largely bug fixing mode, and they likely spent the last entire year building this tech. Going back to the drawing board now will get it delayed another 6+ months.
---
If I were living in EU I think I'd just roll on NA servers and accept the shittier connection.
---
Isn't that what asmon does most of the time? Watching videos of people watching other people?
---
What if you explicitly choose your layer when you log in. E.g. you might log in to "Kil'jaeden 5" meaning that you're in layer 5, then you can only switch layers after being logged off for 15 min or so.
---
Did you never play on a private server? People from all over the world connect to them and everyone besides the chinese speaks the same language. And chinese wont be in Classic.
---
When the server name list comes out, we will need a list of the Unofficial German/French/Spanish/whatever servers so we can avoid them if we want to speak English and people who want to speak their native language can go there.
---
You say that as though a Klingon server wouldn't actually be really popular.
---
Segments are basically servers. You'd all sign up for the same segment ahead of time.
---
LF Healer Deadmines! No baguettes/fiats/paelas or merceders.
---
That or death grips which give immunity as well
---
3k per layer and a layer is continent based. So only 3 starter zones.... yeah that’s fun.
---
Yesyes I get it. There are a lot of Venruki fans, one of you even inboxed me.
---
I'm not saying he was, or even is, a bad player. I'm just saying that it takes some time to get accostumed to a different incarnation of the game, regardless of it being from BFA to Classic or BC to Classic, especially with all those years past.
---
&gt; Apologies for my English. I'm not a native speaker  
---
wouldn't have known if you didn't mention it  
---
good work my dude. wish i were bilingual
---
Im only commenting on OP's post. I cant really comment on the ideal timing. 
---
Although If it were up to me, I would probably do lots of servers with small population caps and then merge them together after a month or so. Balancing out faction along with population. 
---
I was a dirty low-sec pirate :)
---
It's unlikely they'll even be enough servers for that. My guess is that EU gets 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms for the entire continent (minus Russia).
---
Lmao. "Enemy of classic" to "Well I mean yeah it's authentic classic but that's because it was 15 years ago!"
---
I’m not sure where the suggestion is that I don’t have an interest in benefit? Either way, People will do what they do to ‘stick it to the man’. If people think I’m an ogre then so be it,
---
Thanks for the comment!! But this
---
&gt; This is vanilla we're talking about. 
---
you know what I meant :p
---
Why is layering in classic to begin with? Isn’t this suppose to be a remake of vanilla? There wasn’t laying before?
---
Its really hard to RP out in the world, when you are mid post and get jumped. I mean, If I can't have some sort of Pirate Gadgetstan RP, I don't know that I wanna =p
---
Wow, this post solved everyone's problems!! I never thought of it this way before. Get this guy a Nobel prize!
---
Yeah it’s classic...
---
Keep in mind that BFA is way harder to run server side than classic because the numbers are simply smaller. 
---
Add to that the ARPG-Like ability spam and the servers take a real beating compared to classic workloads.
---
I'm still predicting at least a few server outages during launch, as is tradition.
---
Yea we can and its super cozy. Dont get why its such a big deal.
---
i dont know how it is on French servers but on german servers they use the english acronyms for 5% of the instances.
---
It goes well beyond 20. Popular zones can be crowded up to level 40 from my experience. Stv mob grinds in the 30s are bad, shimmering flats was nearly impossible to complete during peak times.
---
A single Tauren druid could traffic jam the entire race on a server if they wanted to be a big enough asshole Moonfire camping Chief Sharptusk Thornmantle in the starting area quests. Yea, people would just end up skipping the quest, but I had enough struggles trying to do it amicably with full groups spamming macros on top of his spawn point. The frustration is real.
---
Nah.
---
I sir am 39 soon to be 40 and am doing the same
---
Yes, because private server ban people for doing it. Blizzard can't enforce this for many reasons. It will be madness reading any global chat.
---
Venruki never saw it coming, lol
---
Yeah, people regularly just walk up to these people in cities and just give them gold. Some people troll by putting in massive amounts of gold and then canceling trade.
---
But yeah. Asmongold has said he won't accept freebies until he has his epic mount. But he's definitely not ever going to have to farm for consumables or anything really
---
You guys? I speak 3 different languages i have Danish friends we speak Danish to each other when we group if i group with others i obviously dont speak my motherboard language to them
---
&gt; So I don't think it's unrealistic to ask them to make small modifications to systems that already exist in 2 months.
---
Unless you are familiar with the details of the architecture you don't know if it's a small or large modification.  
---
And depending on their DevOps process, 2 months before release is generally a time to minimize changes, fix bugs, and stress test.
---
But since you seem unconvinced, here are a number of other problems with the schema you proposed:
---
1.  It assumes that the people who you login in with the first time around (your Origin group) are the most important people to "stick" you together with.  But they are not, the most important thing you need to avoid with layering is being separated from your friends, guild mates, and people with whom you have established relationships, i.e. your community.  Being on the same layer and vaguely recognizing the name of some guy you hung out with for 15 minutes back on launch day is not as important as seeing the same people on the IF bridge every day.  You aren't likely to form very many long lasting relationships with the people you just happened to log in with.  Relationships emerge much more often in WoW from dungeons, elite questing, world and instance PvP, and just hanging out in Ironforge or Ogrimmar.  So your concept of an Origin group is a nonsense.
---
2. Your model assumes character movement is a linear progression, by which people move from Zone A to Zone B to Zone C to Zone D, and thus your layering model is based on this assumption, grouping players into layers, and then merging them into other layers as you move out from zones.  But people would then need to be separated again, joined and separated over and over, as they travel from Elwynn to Stormwind, back to Elwynn, over to Westshire, over to Redridge, back to Stormwind, back to Elwynn, back to Westshire, down to Darkshire, etc.
---
The result would be that guy you were adventuring with, when he turns in the quest back in Goldshire, and you stayed in Westshire, suddenly he gets "aggressively" split back into his "origin group".
---
I've always been a #nochanges guy, except the changes I want, those are cool.
---
"I just bought it off some gold farming site"
---
It's true that orc stun resist is one of the best racials, but that's about it. I forgot about it for a second there. Tauren racials are garbage imo. The stomp is a cast and only works in melee, and iirc has a long CD.
---
What a pog streamer dood
---
Because hype is totally a reliable indicator of product quality. Just ask Anthem. Or Battleborn. Or BfA.
---
I like to watch videos from wow arena  on YT, and when i see Payo and Asmon, i really get mad and want to bitchslap both.
---
It’s not that big a deal. It won’t last forever. It won’t affect the end game for anyone but the upper tier of spergs. It doesn’t need to be “fixed”.  
---
90% of the &lt;5% of players who try to exploit this will burn out anyway. 
---
You’re prio layered with your guild so guilds would literally have to not guild up. 
---
It also doesn’t say what layer you are on. There is no way of knowing. So the only thing that you could take advantage of with any real accuracy would be mob kills. So yeah a lot of players will be running around in devilsaur. It’s not game breaking imo.
---
He doesnt suck. Just played this wrong that's all.
---
This destroys a lot of classic, for me
---
As a german myself that is fluent in English I can guarantee you most of the germans would rather not play a game than play it on English. Some can not speak English, some are not good at it, and others are very uncomfortable with it. Germans are one of the must stupid minded populations when it comes to having stuff translated for them.
---
I'm aware, TF was hyperbole to show the point that the system has no safety net to protect someone just appearing on their first raid and getting an extremely powerful item.
---
It turns out all of us backpeddling scrubs back in Vanilla knew what we were doing!
---
What about raid times? raids starting 8pm will be 2am for me. I can't pull that off with uni :D
---
&gt; Server identity and seeing the same people as you level up is critical to the success of classic 
---
Yes it is, however original server caps are also very important for this tight knit community. A lot of ppl don't want the overcrowded pserver like experience with 12k players on a server, but they want the original Vanilla like experience with +-3k players on a server.  
---
However making servers with 3k pop probably won't work at the start as ppl will quit and servers might get lol on pop. Therefore you need a mechanic to control pop at launch, so you don't need to start merging servers a few months after launch. Layering deffo is not ideal, but what other mechanic can make sure that we will have original server caps from launch, but also avoid dead servers after a few weeks / months.
---
5'11" is a manlet
---
Did Blizzard already state there won't be language specific realms?
---
I'm not sure I see this being a major cause of abuse.
---
This is not gonna end well. Every language group has some annoying habits in chat that will infuriate others.
---
Just remember: \^\^ :D krass
---
Comparing retail to classic servers is not nearly the same thing
---
Imagine giving this nerd 100 bucks. What a loser!
---
We will surely be doing that, also to provide information for the german speaking folks so they can also join us, but as far as I am aware, the actual server names will only be known in August in the process of the character name reservation, no?
---
We don't need retailt tourists for ANYTHING. Nobody is subbed to retail anyway anymore.
---
You've clearly never played real vanilla wow at launch before they gave language options to spanish and russian etc.  It was a fucking nightmare.
---
I find mob density to be greater on pservers not so much on classic. Not only are nodes spawning in clusters but it seems like mobs are a bit more tightly packed too.
---
I wish
---
Hey Brexit boys. You can come play with us Americans. We accept you.
---
They only have two servers open, or no? Server was filled to the brim.
---
It's what plants crave.
---
That's not entirely true. The economy is still realm specific.
---
Same here! I played with 3 different groups in the 6 hours I played last night (all pugs) and one I played with for roughly 2 hours. We all friended each other as well. In fact it had been so long since I used that feature I was almost startled by the notification, lol.
---
Op watched Asmongold stream :)
---
All the comments about the end of the world and this being worse than sharding... 
---
They are apparently strictly limiting the amount of servers at launch to see what the population is like after a period of time and initially stretching the server populations with layering. In that train of thought, clumping everything together makes sense, aside from Russian (Russian not being a Latin based language).
---
In time, other language servers might be set up if the demand is sufficiently high.
---
Im looking forward to meet my guildmates irl. Need to get 2 weeks off because of traveling tho.
---
You can see visually when warrs stance swap, so if you're 1v1ing a warr and he randomly swaps to d stance, he's gunna disarm you, fear him as it lands and he can't remove that fear 100% without trinkets or the like.
---
We should make them change their mind then, it's gonna be a shitshow if it stays like that
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Ok let me explicitly spell it out: just because you /can/ doesnt mean you /should/
---
&gt;realm transfer off your unofficial French realm are only 15€, what a bargain!
---
Realm transfers are not gonna be available in Classic as confirmed by Blizzard.
---
Because most pokemon names somewhat describe themselves.  Charmander (fire salamander).
---
Medical terms also describe themselves.  Leukemia is a combination of greek words for  Leukos (White), (Haima) Blood, and (ia) Specified Condition of a Disease.
---
It takes a special kind of fucked up gaming company to not believe in the success of their own game. It just seems to me they expect Classic to peak for a month and then die down except for a few hard core players.
---
Aussie?
---
It is really no different than going to the movies or watching a stand-up, depending on who you watch obviously. You may watch some for gameplay purposes, but I think most watch for entertainment purposes.
---
Forgive me, I've been gone for awhile. What is "layering"?
---
I just wish we'd get Latin servers, because they deserve their own place considering the language barrier..
---
Did you watch the original video and what he was claiming to be able to do? Because if you had you’d know this is not the same as what he was claiming... it’s seriously like talking to a brick wall....
---
Dwarf hunter was my very first vanilla character. Great lore between the class/ race. Super fun
---
UK players are just as upset too. They want their Brexit servers. You forgot them!
---
Mop only deserves the "underappreciated at their time."
---
Well.. I'm Dutch and we get English in school from 10 years old i think. also i've been playing WoW since i was 13.. I learned alot of English from WoW if i got to be honest. :)
---
Thank you tho.
---
yes, they did several hours ago.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292440/wow-classic-european-realm-structure?webhook
---
this is just an early meme about a topic which will be discussed A LOT
---
Seek comfort in knowing that most of your colleagues are likely pieces of shit that you wouldn’t want to be friends with. So you can stop comparing your life to theirs now.
---
I'm an idiot, I read wouldn't as would ha.
---
but not technically possible so I don't know what people are fooling themselves into believing it will happen. i mean what you're talking about is sharding (zone instead of continent instances)
---
YYEes dude
---
This is only a 'problem' for the first 20 levels max (which is like what, 15% of exp to 60?) not all the way to 60. And I find it more immersive with many people around, its an MMO after all and not a single player RPG.
---
By the time phase 2 starts players will be spread out and not all in the same 3 zones so layering won't be needed even if there's still a high pop server. If there's a couple servers with ridiculous queues they can offer free transfers to less populated realms, but that's better than realm merges.
---
This stream looks terrible.
---
Obviously quit your job and education and increase your NEET energy like a real raider.
---
People raid at all times of days. Some people work third-shift in NA that also cant raid at 8pm-2am. Also if enough EU people migrated to NA servers there would be more people who don't want to raid at those times.
---
I enjoy the small details like the tide pod spillage on his shirt.
---
Blizzard has consistently shown they don't care about the economy though.
---
If you don't see that as an abuse then you're very obtuse
---
I really hope I won't have to.
---
Hmm, pretty cool factoid. Never thought of that
---
THANKS, MR ION. I SURE ENJOY PLAYING WITH GERMANS AND SPANIARDS WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. VERY NICE!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btos6ur0v3Y
---
It wasn't an issue. You micro your pet and throw up occasional mends. Also most fights didn't have tons of AOE or anything.
---
Again, I think you are confused.
---
Sure, they may have started with AQ, buy only so many people were walking around with T2.5
---
Where as TBC, literally everyone had the color pallet of a rare poisonous frog from south america.
---
The private server DBs do have the inflated rep gains from post-TBC. Take a look at this Allakhazam entry for "A Threat Within", the very first Northshire Abbey quest:
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060221180928/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=783
---
They didn't list the rep gains with the quest details, but you can see in the comments from 2005-2006 that the quest awarded 50 rep (55 for Humans due to diplomacy). Now, look at it on ClassicDB:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=783
---
This lists it as 75 rep. 
---
Then take a look at the next quest in the series, "Kobold Camp Cleanup":
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20051104104929/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/quest.html?wquest=7
---
Comments indicate it awarded 100, while ClassicDB suggests 250:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7
---
The values seemed to have been buffed discreetly in the prepatch, and historical data suggests that the lower values are indeed authentic.
---
Great idea to reroll or pay for a server transfer after some weeks or months of playing ;)
---
Everyone even thinking we need layering period doesnt want what actual Vanilla WoW WAS.  This is not Vanilla WoW.  It's just sharding WoW all over again.
---
If you look at patch notes from blizzards website on the way back machine they have a disclaimer. They try to be as thorough as possible but not all changes make it into notes. Did you also by chance check the undocumented changes as well?
---
&gt; Cdew=pleb?
---
 invanilla? yes
---
Why don’t you just ban people that manipulate the layering system?
---
Kopf -&gt; Tisch
---
Big mistake by blizzard.
---
One of the biggest problems with this is that it would likely take a significant amount of time to develop, and they have 2 months until the release day that a bunch of people have already taken off.
---
They'd have to delay everything for a long time to implement any other solutions, so it's either accept current layering (with smaller fixes like preventing moving layers more than once an hour or whatever), or accept a massive launch delay, which is going to get some insane backlash.
---
Layering is fine, some in the know retail players told me it's a necessary feature, otherwise the game simply won't work.
---
Kind of in the same boat but with Shaman instead of Druid. Pretty set on Priest but.... Shaman possibly.. tough to decide.
---
perplexity's statements about choosing to emulate lag instead of allowing the game to be updated to meet the standards of modern technology are similar to what i've commented in the past. perplexity has much more authority over myself as he's provided evidence of his testing and much more detail about why what we're going to be experiencing will be controversially detrimental.
---
There are plenty ways to improve the game in nuanced ways without throwing out a very important part of the spirit of the game. It’s a social thing. If you can’t understand that then I don’t know what to tell you.
---
I glaub s hakt was soll denn der scheiss alda?Ich will mid moine kumbls schwäbisch schwätzä und nix anders. Heiland sag noi
---
Top notch prediction and comparison.
---
the polls are not really good information
---
see the folks living on reddit and forums are the most hardcore and psyched giving them higher odds of rolling healer or tank
---
I think it is almost impossible to make the system both;
---
* Not terrible to use for legitimate players
---
* impossible  to exploit
---
&gt;  in-game jank for a couple of weeks is better than a completely unplayable mess.
---
Agreed, but possible economic damage could last for months.
---
no one was getting close to exalted with alliance reps from purely questing in vanilla.  my gnome rogue alt that's been level 61 since the start of tbc is barely revered with stormwind and honored with every else
---
No, that's just what most of the youtube videos are since it's hard to make a video of an 8 hour mostly uneventful WoW stream.
---
Alliance side needs an ooga gang as well. Then we'll get to see some hot ooga on ooga action.
---
People are arguing for the convenience of layering because it will help with launch and calling those who disagree "whiny babies." If waiting in a queue means that the server economy remains healthy for the long term over the short term advantages of layering, then I'm for a layering alternative.
---
I was under the impression that layering was for server stability. Are you suggesting we add queues to zones as you walk into them or something ? What is going to hold the server together when 500 people are at crossroads?
---
Legit curious.
---
Ni Hao?
---
Du kannst sie in mein Senfglas stecken
---
5. im going to ignore testers who say layering sucks and construct strawmen, fuck real conversations on the internet
---
the issue with huge pop realms is it ruins the server economy unless you do dynamic respawns for nodes and mobs and they have been clear in not wanting to do that. if pop counts are over 5000 then the devilsaur set and flasks will cost an insane amount
---
About 40% of all European realms are German. You can be damn sure I'm only gonna write in German even though I'm perfectly capable of writing in English.
---
If it came out before Classic I would have bought it and played through again. Since Classic comes first, I'll be too busy with that.
---
I remember it being pretty tough for the guild I was in.  Wr ended up forming an alliance with a few other guilds and one of us hosted a website were people from any of the guilds could sign up for raid.  The leaders from each guild would pick people from the sign ups and assign them as needed.  Ended up usually having 80-90% attendence and the rest were filled with reserves.  This was having 2-3 raid groups running various content throughout the week.  Rarely had to pug.
---
I was not a raid leader but I imagine it was quite a bit tedius for them to assign and manage but it worked.
---
Sicilian clique for sure
---
No you can search for yourself.
---
Exactly! some of my best friends I had in Classic were people who you would see repeatedly in the world.
---
It meant you guys played at the same pace, had the same general schedule, and had similar goals for the game... all without ever even having to say a word.  
---
What separates WoW Vanilla from retail... was community. Everything there is to do in Retail WoW you can do without saying a SINGLE WORLD to literally anyone else playing the game. WoW retail is a single player RPG unless you are pushing the last 5% of content.
---
Now blizz is trying to make our single player experiences more streamlined in Classic... just further shows how much this company has lost the plot.
---
I mean, there is going to be widespread competition for mobs. You'd probably be better off grouping up and grinding mobs in a dungeon for xp, or just grinding out quests.
---
Spanish guild with no healers, guess they’re fucked!
---
People will change their class on their journey to 60 or play Dps builds to farm.
---
What do you mean 24 languages represented :D there wasnt 24 different languange servers back then either. on top of english and russian there was, spanish, french and german. Its not like every swede, finn, dutch, and slovakian players were just speaking their own languages lol. English was the way to go, and I think those big 4 can manage that too this time.
---
Honestly, 2 weeks is no where near enough time for people to figure all of this out.
---
We're talking an entire country of people being forced to play with a totally different language speaking country.
---
It truly cannot be a monumental task to release a Server List. 
---
Classic  is only going to re-release one time, lets release it on the right foot!
---
Seeing tons of people around you doing the same stuff as you keeps you motivated and interested. If you wanna play a single player RPG there is better options out there. Check out Witcher or Bethesda games.
---
I would say it is more likely that GOOD healers will be more sought after. Reputation of a role is more important than just answering the LFG message in chat. Healing will be lost on a load of people who don’t understand gearing and down ranking as a mechanic. I wouldnt worry too much.
---
probably watching Asmongold/Soda stream
---
Someone runs in and grabs the chest while you are fighting the mob guarding it
---
Frawitz is an ass and we won't be working with him again
---
This is wholesome content and looks like a very friendly community.
---
HOTW spec can heal fine, NS is the big one as that big heal in case of emergencies. 
---
Swiftmend is brutal in terms of mana cost, as hots aren't really used outside of 5-mans all too often - such a mana sink, and you need longevity in raids.
---
tbc
---
Go in blind. There will be a lot of people who know the game inside and out, but I’ll bet there will be a lot of people who never played and want to experience it from the start. Lots of people that I know wouldn’t jump in now because the game has been going on for years, but they’ll gladly play classic. 
---
Take your time and don’t over research things. Even your race / class combo can be overblown... just find something that fits your style. Don’t worry about endgame because, honestly, it’s a long ways away and the 1-60 game is fantastic. You should experience that first.. endgame will be there for you when you’re ready.
---
A proud race like Nibbler
---
Well then i'm verry happy you do have "the brain" to talk english because if you dind't you'd be shit out of luck and should just not play the game i guess.
---
Is that asmongold in the middle?
---
The issue still remains, if servers are not officially marked for a certain language, someone that is not reading forums could accidentally go to a German or Spanish speaking server then realize that nobody speaks english.
---
This has worked out perfectly fine on private servers for 2 exceptions being chinese and russian and neither will be on the european realms so this makes perfect sense.
---
If only they could be Goblins
---
I will definitely keep this in mind. Thank you for your feedback.
---
Oh man, watching him mouse-click *everything* sets my teeth on edge. Such simpler times! Haha these videos are both awesome.
---
Yeah seeing 5000 people in a level 1 zone is totally more immersive than seing 50. I have no trouble believing the entire population of Azeroth came to Elwynn Forest to kill wolves at the same date and time.
---
Doubtful.  The leveling experience lends itself to playing a DPS spec, which means people have played the game a certain way for 100+ hours and then face an expectation of doing everything differently once they hit 60.  
---
It’s also way easier to get in to PvP melting faces and oneshotting with wind fury than trying to go back and forth.
---
Honor is not the problem. Spam layer swaping to avoid any ganking.
---
With layering you mass farm things. For every rare mobb you can check if they are up on every layer.
---
You can stand on herb or vein spawns and just change layers so your farming without moving. So if your quest mobb, quest items, veins, herbs, rare mobb ain't up just swap layer untill you find them
---
Most prominent Russian guilds tend to play on EU servers and we keep reminding our members to speak in English only when there are pugs in the group. Common courtesy.
---
THIS 👍
---
Layering will be gone by the time the Honor system even exists.
---
That is likely intentional, because the layers aren't separate right now. But yeah if they "fix" it, and allow users to choose their layer (like Darkspear server - layer 3) then I'll stop complaining. You should not ever be able change layers under any circumstance.
---
Sounds like a dream. Money stress made me fat and bald tbh
---
They are actually
---
Wir können auch nicht alle gut Englisch sprechen. Wäre ziemlich dumm von Blizzard wenn sie das tatsächlich durchziehen. Wenn das so bleibt werde ich mir das mit Classic definitiv nochmal überlegen
---
Using weed as an excuse to fuck up bigga kek
---
Calm your tits mate
---
Did I say anything like that at all. I’m saying that layering can be fixed. You need to chill the fuck out.
---
I barely made the cut for being on a 100 Mbps cable connection in the rural area I live. Go just a couple miles north and it's nothing but satellite.
---
Yeah, that's what I and 8 other people I know are doing
---
Why is not dynamic respawn for mobs in early level zones considered for blizz as an alternative to layering? You could exclude the nodes and rarespawns to prevent diluting the economy etc, seems like it worked fine for pservers, am I missing something?
---
The goalposts are seemingly moving from being stubborn #nochanges to #somechanges now that people are getting their hands on it.  Cases like this are the exact reason that stubborness made any sense in the first place, parts of vanilla are objectively dumb design in retrospect/modern day yet that's how it was.
---
&gt; One thing you could do is basically a Horde and Alliance Blacklist. So if someone is stream sniping or [otherwise doing something I don't like], I'll say "okay, Blacklist this person". My friends on the Alliance or other streamers, don't play with this person. They are never allowed in anything that the actual good guilds on the Alliance are doing. They are Blacklisted. And it's vice versa as well. So you won't get any actual good raids, you'll never actually get any good gear, and eventually, if you want to keep stream sniping, you're going to be doing it while I have double your gear. Let's fucking make a list.
---
That's what he said. He doesn't get to deny it.
---
Then only and incredibly small number of people will be able to play, since unless blizz wants dead servers they need to be conservative with how many they spin up.
---
Layering/higher caps allows for the post tourist rush to still have decent populations.  The real issue is just "how long".
---
They've said things before that didn't come to fruition. The only way layering goes away is if the population drops to the extent Blizzard expects. If more people stick around than anticipated, layers are going to inevitably become permanent.
---
Palm-ala Handerson
---
Pero que jodida santa puta mierda de la rehostia es esta?
---
*Community* matters. Especially in a fundamentally social genre like an MMO.
---
Congratulations, you're what's wrong with modern game design.
---
Vanilla is always better with mates
---
Yes, but the issue will not be resolved. They have announced it officially. 
---
So we need to move to plan B - Inform the players, so we can make intelligent decisions on which realms to play on. 
---
Lets spin it the other way- Imagine no America's server? And we were forced to join EU or Russian server? Talk about a nightmare.
---
How does playing during vanilla help you pick a realm for Classic?
---
I played on Dunemaul EU at the time, but with brand new names in Classic, I don’t see how that is gonna benefit my choice this time?
---
Because the people that you are attacking could just ask for an invite to another shard and then you cannot see them.  It's that easy.
---
Lots of them played on French Servers. You knoow, the thing that won't actually exist this time around.
---
Blizzard What The Fuck.
---
You mention czech way too often. I can see right trough you chlape
---
Yeah, and it's going to be a shit show. 24 languages forced onto 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms? Fucking yikes.
---
That's why people that know they only want to play in English should play on US servers.
---
Exploring the game for the first time is pretty mind-blowing, and to be honest can be a little overwhelming. It is indeed more fun playing with others, I always try to group with people when possible. As for the "why is Stormwind empty" question, it's probably because it's a new beta realm and people are just leveling up and are all low levels etc. When the game releases for real there will be waaaaaaaay more people about and the cities will be flooded I guarantee it! Also the dungeons generally start at around level 17 and there's plenty of them to keep you going all the way up until 60, which is when you can raid too.
---
I love talking about classic wow (played since 06) so if you have any questions at all fire away!
---
This is what I immediately thought about. But it will only work if Europe has 2-3 superservers with 10k pop each. I don't think Blizzard is going after that, so there will probably be plenty of smaller german-infested servers.
---
If they add layering, the game is fucked in general. They need to add a population cap - not because of hardware limitations but for the games economy in general. 
---
Any sort of layering defeats the purpose of the social aspect of classic (which is a huge point in the grand argument of why we want classic back to begin with) and also opens the game to mechanic manipulation &amp; abuse like we’ve already seen with rare spawns like the Gurubashi chest.
---
Did we have German servers etc in vanilla?
---
New players my friend.
---
On the one pirate server I briefly played on, my hunter felt *ridiculous*. I and my pet soloed a quest mob eight levels higher than me at one point. I used no funky kiting trickery that I recall, I was just in levelling greens, and I did nothing more than have my pet tank it while I lit it up. My strong recollection was that this simply should not have been remotely possible with Blizzlike mechanics.
---
That was without Lupos, the BiS pet everyone wanted to farm that apparently added another 30% pet DPS on top of that.
---
If that's what pirate server players are used to, real Blizzlike hunters might be a shock to them.
---
Lol I'm sorry, but this is way more interesting and memorable than having a super convenient, no-competition, wait-free game. I was actually looking forward to forming queues like a group of civilized adventurers.
---
Oh yeah man its going to be hard.   
---
There's tons of human psychology stuff that fucks it up too.  For hardcore guilds, if you are stuck on content there's really nowhere to go. You're already in the first or second guild on the server, so you can't easily progress without banding together and banging your head against it until dps figures out how to squeeze out an extra 10,000 dps during the enrage phase etc.   
---
Casual guild? Not so much. Your raid crew will have the option of leaving to go to other guilds if you get stuck. But, you'll also have people on the casual end of the spectrum who don't want to work too hard to pass content. Your guild is in a cultural tug of war to keep its most active players around when they can easily go to greener pastures.   
---
Theres also the problem of people getting all the gear they want and disappearing until new content comes out.   
---
You have to find a good guild with strong culture that recruits people that match that culture or you won't hold together through BWL
---
please bobby b make them see reason
---
Well, yeah, after the shit he caught for it, I would "change my mind and shut the fuck up" too.
---
Doesn't matter though, his Blacklist idea turned around on him. Now there's a streamer Blacklist where streamers simply won't be allowed to play on a specific US PVP realm at all.
---
If it is actually enforced, most french and spanish people won't play. And probably no German just to protest. I dno't think it's a good idea to discourage most of Europe from playing.
---
MERDE! 50DKP MINUZ!

[COME, BOW BEFORE YOUR KING! BOW, YA SHITS!](https://i.imgur.com/hrCP6Uk.gifv)

I dont understand why it would be a shitshow. It wasnt a shitshow back then, when 20 languages were forced into certain realms. Why cant those 4 other languages make it in as well
---
totally agree
---
Yep exactly. Elwynn is one thing, but wait until you get to Westfall and it takes literally 5 hours to all of your goretusk lovers…
---
&gt; Your model assumes character movement is a linear progression, by which people move from Zone A to Zone B to Zone C to Zone D, and thus your layering model is based on this assumption, grouping players into layers, and then merging them into other layers as you move out from zones. But movement in WoW is not linear, it is purposefully non-linear. Early questing is designed to send you all over the place and back and forth to the same locations to slow you down and waste time. People would then need to be separated and then joined and separated over and over, as they traveled from Elwynn to Stormwind, back to Elwynn, over to Westshire, over to Redridge, back to Stormwind, back to Elwynn, back to Westshire, down to Darkshire, etc. The result would be that guy you were adventuring with, when he turns in the quest back in Goldshire, and you stayed in Westshire, suddenly he gets "aggressively" split back into his "origin group".
---
That's what the origin groups are for (which by the way is just me giving a name to the thing they've already said is occurring, in that your character is getting tagged with an 'original layer' that is 'semi-sticky'), to try to give consistency to the people you see while the layering/compartmentalising is going on.
---
&gt; It assumes that the people who you login in with the first time around (your Origin group) are the most important people to "stick" you together with. But they are not, the most important thing you need to avoid with layering is being separated from your friends, guild mates, and people with whom you have established relationships, i.e. your community. Being on the same layer and vaguely recognizing the name of some guy you hung out with for 15 minutes back on launch day is not as important as seeing the same people on the IF bridge every day. You aren't likely to form very many long lasting relationships with the people you just happened to log in with. Relationships emerge much more often in WoW from dungeons, elite questing, world and instance PvP, and just hanging out in Ironforge or Ogrimmar. So your concept of an Origin group is a nonsense.
---
I didn't feel it necessary to explicitly say you could still group with people, since that's already a thing and no one in their right mind would want to get rid of that.
---
The picture is a summary of the proposed *changes* (and so I only talked about the 'origin groups' to give context to the numbers).
---
&gt; Unless you are familiar with the details of the architecture you don't know if it's a small or large modification.
---
&gt;And depending on their DevOps process, 2 months before release is generally a time to minimize changes, fix bugs, and stress test.
---
Yes, true.
---
But if you don't ask, you don't get. I'm merely putting forward a suggestion which tries to keep all the desired advantages Blizzard wanted out of layering, while removing the potential exploits and community issues.
---
I mained shaman in vanilla and BC and it was really fun.  I want to be something different this time, but it was such a good experience being able to do so much while leveling and always getting into groups.
---
-self Rez
---
-astral recall
---
-water walking
---
-ghost wolf
---
-aoe heal
---
-Nature’s Swiftness
---
-hard to take down
---
-lots of buffs 
---
Shaman will always hold a special place in my heart.  
---
If you want to challenge yourself, try tanking as enhance with rockbiter and earth shock!  I got through BRD with it back in the day.  Hard to tank packs, but you’ve got taunt totem, grounding totem, chain lighting pull all to help a bit.  Keep NS as your Oh Shit.  0/30/21 was my build at the time.  Rogues and warriors loved the improved totems.  Switched to 31 Resto later on.
---
Ok last one. Hopefully they get the point!
---
I really fucking hope they at least give the Russians their own servers. It's so cancer to play with people who are completely incapable of communicating in English. We see them in HotS, we see them in OW, we see them on private servers.. these guys just need their own server for the benefit of everyone.
---
Of course, but were talking about layering, not pay to win and pure cash transactions. What is the upside for Blizzard to tell us about layering at all then? Why wouldn't they just never bring it up or test it?  
---
If the theory is that Blizzard is trying to lull us into thinking we'll have a layer-free experience after a few weeks (in order to what, get a months sub from everyone?) only to leave layering on forever (again, why?), it would be easier to not even mention it to the public or test it on beta/stress.   
---
For the record, I don't like layering past lvl 20 and I would prefer it's gone after a week, but I think it's better than the alternative of letting everything run and merging a bunch of realms later. I just don't understand why some people are acting like this is some ultimate activision evil scheme and how it's going to destroy everything.
---
This is exactly what happened in Classic. I ended up on an unofficial Spanish realm and there was a big rift between Spanish and non-Spanish.
---
Then when Blizzard finally created Spanish realms, our population went from Medium to Low and never recovered.
---
Big mistake not doing language servers from launch
---
Have you been watching any streams?!?!?  It clearly isn't working as they described.  It works exactly like sharding on retail.  There is no difference.   
---
It will never be removed because it cannot be disable.  That's how the game works.  That's how it is designed.  There is no such thing as a server, "layer," that holds 3k people.   The infrastructure is designed to spread out the population across many many servers all over the place, based on location.   That's why it is not possible to do large wpvp raids in retail.   Communication between shards is not reliable.    
---
Please feel free to reply back when it is disabled after the first few weeks.. I'll gladly eat crow.  Keep drinking the koolaid.. daddy blizzard knows best and will never lie to you!
---
Maybe watch the VOD before you speak
---
yes bobby b, that's how i want you to prove our point to blizz
---
Y’all taking this way to serious. But I guess y’all live for the drama
---
I'VE GOT SEVEN KINGDOMS TO RULE! ONE KING, SEVEN KINGDOMS!
---
Leeroy?
---
Im not playing Classic cause i know layering will fuck everything up. Id happily take a queue time for the classic experience. Activision are idiots.
---
Why is using layers for the first few weeks considered, "not classic" while changing respawn rates isn't?
---
Exactly. Also the reason why we see Warlock so high and Hunter so low in these polls.
---
Not if you can just hop layers and have the whole camp respawn. If you get ahead of the pack it's even easier, which is what will happen since layering is bottom heavy.
---
If you see tons of people doing the same stuff as you thats motivating and immersive, especially to new players or people coming over from retail. If you wanna be immersed in a world or story you are better of playing a single player RPG or retail wow. This is a true MMO where immersion comes from the fact that you play online with alot of other people.
---
The issue is there aren't supposed to be transfers in classic.
---
If private servers have proven anything it's that no matter how easy the content 95% of the population will make it feel difficult
---
i see you met Asmon... 
---
I like Asmon ...
---
seven realms*, my sentient king
---
Some things are worth fighting for
---
Yes, but if layering stops after a few weeks who cares if there is a glut of peacebloom. The amount of farming you can do with the layers is way overshadowed by how much you will do later.  Also rare mobs don't spawn on each layer, so it'll be harder to find rare-spawns during phasing, not easier.
---
Zoomer stream
---
If your comparing your experience now while most people are at work to yesterday at 5pm-9pm. when most people actually logged in yeh I’m sure it’s not nearly as busy right this minute cause we are at work.  There were around 30-40 people around the scorpion named mob waiting for a tag so this whole everything is empty line is a lie because last night you literally had to camp spawns for a chance on a tag.
---
Yeah it's really scary to me too. Catering to this "instant gratification" crowd is exactly why modern wow turned into the mess it is today. Inconvenience isn't the end of the world.
---
With Blizzards budget, it should be no issue to redesign hos it works. 
---
The system laying system is already hated in how it is designed on retail servers. Shouldn't be hard to make a few changed, and improve the player experience.
---
Srsly why not have RP-PvP server at this *test* lol
---
People are very defensive on his behalf, lol.
---
I've got a recording of the 26~ minute deadmines runs we were pulling off as all melee, and a recording of my 1-60 speedrun. I didn't think people would be interest in the raw footage though
---
HEY GUYS WE GOT THIS GAMEBREAKING BUG FOR YOU BUT FIRST LET ME JUST SAY HOW EXCITED I AM TO BRING YOU THIS CONTENT FOR CLASSIC WOW YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HONORED I AM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS CONTENT FOR YOU GUYS BUT I RELY ON YOUR GENEROSITY SO DONT FORGET TO HIT THAT LIKE BUTTON AND SMASH SUBSCRIBE THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS I SUPER APPRECIATE IT FOR REALSIES
---
Could do best case/average case/worst case. Then if it's always better...easy choice. Else they have to decide if they're feeling lucky :P
---
It's mostly about French and German having as many servers combined as the English servers. Blizzard can't honestly think this won't cause huge problems. But I guess they don't give a damn about their EU players, even though we're actually more players than on US.
---
Isnt it only going to be around for 1 week?
---
And thus why I recommend dynamic spawning instead of layering. With dynamic spawning mobs spawn when they need to depending on the number of players. This is oftentimes used in Private Servers.
---
Oh no. A tragedy. Meanwhile my country of 40 million never got WoW in their language. People played the game without knowing english too. Yet already few hours after announcement there are more crybabies on this forum than in the history of my country.
---
I don't see the problem either, I played a lot on Spinebreaker back when it was essentially the Spanish server and loved it. I also play on Gandara in gw2 which has a huge amount of German players and, again, I like to see the mix. The outcry over this is coming from a place of boredom i reckon, once classic releases people will hopefully stop caring so much about these things. I'd hate for this sub to essentially be wow forums 2.0
---
Streamers don't have to be good, they have to be entertaining.
---
Get in a group and mindfully grind out mobs. Don't be so antisocial in the game. I'd much rather get a full group and grind for awhile than solo a bunch of quests.
---
I don't think you will. I will function the same way - you will only need to set your client to English to force the alteration because of grammar changes in the client.
---
Good call, likely leaked from 7.3.5.
---
This is the first time i've heard this! So in 5-mans, rogues get to actually use all of their stuns to CC mobs?
---
Ya pretty soon people are going to come out of the woodwork and say how a amazing it is. Surprised they haven't started saying layering was always in vanilla.
---
Put 3 flares and EXPOSE THEM
---
I was answering on someone stating you reach your goal (9 days played to 60) if you play 11 minutes every day for a year. Which was not correct ;-)
---
If you don't have a time limit, yes, you can login, kill a mob and logout again and be level 60... eventually...
---
I'm from Brazil and I agree
---
Quality shitpost A+++
---
They could not expose the Germans to English Names like Ironforge(Eisenschmiede) or Stormrage(Sturmgrimm) but now they are forced to play with non German speaking people? Does anyone get this logic?
---
Talk about a mountain out of a mole hill. Guess what it takes about 1 min to realize you are on a server with a language you do not understand. Logout and start on another. Is your life so delicate that this seems like a tremendous burden? Really? SMH
---
The sleepy panda was my first choice back when vanilla launched, and it will be my main's pet. Watching him sleep during raid boss battles is just too funny!
---
I aim to please.
---
I think that Millennials just don't understand kids these days.
---
Can confirm. Was at work.
---
What about all the people who are on the fence and dont even get to experience the game? There are tons of people who never got to experience vanilla wow who will be trying it out and having to wait a few hours of gameplay to even begin to play the game will turn off a ton of players who would otherwise be in it for the long haul.
---
Cause they are actually spoken by a lot of people, like way more (combined) than english in europe. And for Spanish and French, most of them are terrible in english. The same can't be said about swedish people.
---
This looks more like jealousy about some people getting free shit :|
---
That's really not the case. I know plenty of people who avoid private server launches because of this exact issue and dont show up to end game for 2 to 3 months later. Being level 6 for over 2 hours because there are no mobs is just not fun for the vast majority of people. You will lose any players who are on the fence about classic to this because they arent masochist.
---
It's a real shame but at least we get to play classic at all! If it was up to the blizzard CEO it never would've happened "you think you do but you don't"
---
It's a terrible opinion to have.  Don't listen to the POWER guy.
---
I think a mega server might be better for the health of classic in Europe.
---
But I understand the language barrier and complexities within that will be difficult to deal with.
---
Good luck either way it works out in the end.  I think you guys can make it work even if it isn't optimal.
---
This has to be the most autistic comment I've read at least so far this month.

Seriøst dude, du oppfører deg som en edgy 13-åring, som er utrolig tragisk.

Oh hey I also know 3 languages, I must be like the smartestest person ever!

I mean there's so pretty buggy stuff from 1.12.

I know a way to reset 1h cooldowns that wasnt resolved till sometime in wrath. If that bug went mainstream would you want it fixed?

He used to have really bad teeth due to being poor but he had dental surgery.

Samesies :D
---
Front page was half-full of "laying is bad" complaint posts. Most centered on high lvl content, but the general opinion of layering in general has not been high lately.
---
I'm simply expressing an opinion that it feels quite necessary earlier on.
---
Youre acting like the other 3 are just passive players. If theres 3 stealthers, those other 3 will spam exposing spells, like flares, aoe etc and most likely hit at least one
---
From my understanding of layering you will still get that feel, since the original server pops were so low compared to now.   Even with layering there were definitely waaaay over 100 people *just* in the valley of trials when me and my guildmates logged in to server 2 last night
---
Bavarian only servers confirmed
---
What's the point of regrouping europe if in the end people only play with their country ?
---
Why not from the start open a server ( each type ) for every big country and then, if there is not enough players ( because now it's just speculation ) regroup them by merging servers ?
---
By doing so there would be no drama, people that want to have enough people to play end game would accept to merge
---
obviously this is shit - but im still ok with it if it's only for the first few weeks to deal with launch.
---
Hva er problemet? Slutt å syte så gæli.
---
.. you actually know why it worked and why it won't work for Blizzard?
---
That was before the shitshow that layering has become :p
---
This guy has to be a troll. Nobody is stupid enough to believe this is a real issue. Fucking log on servers until they are speaking a language you speak. Beyond easy, stop giving this troll attention.
---
I did. Him *saying* where these alts are located is a lot different than *proving* where these alts are located.
---
Maybe you should *think* before you speak.
---
It's both
---
Yeah I'm honestly not sure why so many people want to grind quests by themselves with absolutely zero competition. Convenience isn't always a good thing. Inconvenience is what breeds community, because people need to help eachother.
---
Because the EU launch of WoW had 100+ realms to choose from, so communities could migrate and avoid each other. This is how humans operate. Just look at London. 
---
There's a Black neighborhood, there's a Chinese neighborhood, there's an Arab neighborhood, and so on and so on, for Bangladesh, Germany, Ghana, Greece, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, Lithuania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Thailand, and Turkey (to name the big ones). All in one city. They flock together.
---
Now take all those groups and shove them into one apartment building. That's what Blizzard is doing.
---
There aren't going to be 100+ neighborhoods in Classic WoW, there's going to be a handful, maybe as little as one, depending on the server type you want.
---
Are you really comparing Portugal with Germany? You do know that when looking at native languages in the EU, German is on the first spot? There's no way this decision is based on logic.
---
Not good.
---
see, well that is what I like.  fighting other players.
---
Such a bad decision.
---
Guess I wait until all the data has been datamined and a nice german private server opens up.
---
This just screws over all french/german/spanish/...etc communities. I didnt even think not splitting servers by language was a topic in question lol
---
I like the colors and faces.
---
But why are the bodies only the size of the esophagus.  It was really distracting trying to figure out which organs you'd have to remove to look like that.  And the answer was almost all of them.
---
Grinding either solo or in a group is honestly my least favorite thing to do in WoW. For me it goes WPvP&gt;BGs&gt;5 man ubgeons&gt;Questing&gt;Raiding&gt;Grinding
---
Its the height of arrogance for him to assume people would chose him over the sanctity of their server.
---
No, I was using Portugal as an example of why giving one language region their own server doesn't mean they have to give them three.
---
And it's based on Blizzard's logic. You might disagree with it, but that's the truth.
---
German players playing on German servers makes up about 25% of the EU WoW playerbase and they're not getting even one of their own servers.
---
Which means Blizzard doesn't think all of Europe can sustain more than a few servers. Maybe they're right. We can only speculate, but at least they're the experts with all the numbers.
---
Why are you insistent on leveling up quickly and by yourself? I think a single player RPG would fit you a lot better if grouping up to kill mobs sounds terrible to you.
---
No memes, Stino is amazing. Yessssss doood!
---
The stink lines lol
---
This is awesome :) Wish we had US and Australian players on the same server too.
---
The paranoia is real.
---
I'm sure they can merge some underpopulated BFA servers if they want to find the ressources..
---
In the end it's all about money and politics - what my old professor told me. 
---
Since the development of virtualization technology have been invented they can dynamic scale the the server size and accommondate the initial rush of players. 
---
But then again, if the keep the old architecture where all players computation is handled by the server, IT does require an unnessecary unnecessary big server.
---
Also gerne mal ne pm schicken welchen server ihr wählt wenn es soweit ist =)
---
That's why everyone should speak in God's language, English.
---
People don't trust Blizzard to not fuck things up. They have a long history of design creep for the worse. Not being skeptical is just Blizzard Bootlicking at this point. Just wait and see.
---
The goalposts are multiplying like a Naruto shadow clone jitsu
---
I could live with streamers if the twitch chat culture of emote spamming fucked off.  Leetspeak back in the day was tolerable because it at least made sense if you sat back and looked at it for a second, but twitch emotes are just a black hole of stupidity with zero chance of understanding what the fuck is going on without background context.  Streamers themselves are just people, its the idiots that follow them.
---
I actually heard a coworker say "omega" out loud, a 35 year old grown ass man saying fucking twitch emotes outloud.  I have no faith left in humanity.
---
I know this will get downvoted because I'm specifically calling out people who suck streamers dicks, and not the streamers themselves, so a bunch of idiots are going to feel personally attacked, but oh well.
---
The main problem I see repeated is people talking about PvP.  In that case the solution is easy, have a timer of 20sec (equal to the logout timer) from when combat ends before you can phase.
---
&gt;But it will only work if Europe has 2-3 superservers with 10k pop each. I don't think Blizzard is going after that, so there will probably be plenty of smaller german-infested servers.
---
Im pretty sure thats roughly what they are going to do, otherwise this announcement doesnt make sense. Probably a bit more than 3 servers though, my guess would be 5-6.
---
No problem. If it's any help, there's comments avaliable on WoWHead that indicate that the reps were buffed with 2.0.1:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=433/the-public-servant
---
&gt;This quest rewards 150 Ironforge reputation and 150 Gnomeregan Exiles reputation as of patch 2.01
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=183/the-boar-hunter
---
&gt;This quest rewards 250 Ironforge reputation and 250 Gnomeregan Exiles reputation as of patch 2.01
---
Sorry for the terseness of the information, but hopefully it helps you out.
---
I don't care about the drama. I just want a server free of streamers. There are plenty of non-drama reasons to want that.
---
I would never in my life work in that sort of environment lol wtf naaa
---
Does anyone know if Lupos still does shadow damage on beta?
---
If you layer hop, you're not going to always get a fresh untouched layer. Its gonna have other players on it that are also killing mobs. It also requires that you be organized with other players on those other layers. If you're already working with a group of players, just grind dungeon content, it's an unlimited source of mobs.
---
I mean, on private servers with dynamic spawning, mages were still out competed by hunters and druids on the race to 60.
---
You have to sign up for the beta in your account options. You can always just put a timer on it as well. If you don't access it within a certain amount of time, you lose your chance.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-hunter-is-almost-unplayable/203356
---
It's basically already confirmed that the game is nothing like the original. Pathing, pet behavior, charging mechanics, etc. are all different. It's a weird bastardization of modern WOW code, so it feels like neither contemporary WOW nor the original WOW.
---
The only true value this could have had if it had been a 1:1 authentic original WOW client just with some security patches and fixes a la something like Chocolate Doom for Doom, but instead, it's simply just a diversion in a desperate attempt to keep people subbed to a dying MMO.
---
This is completely counter to the way we play games today. Will feel completely alien to many, even if you played Vanilla back in 04-06.
---
German yes, but no other.
---
Yeah I agree. The people complaining about this kind of thing just remind me of people who complained about having to manually travel to dungeons. We've had to fight off those people for years now.
---
Slavic: Jebem ti mater
---
No there are no english servers. Blizzard didnt say all servers would be english they just said they wouldnt be split by languages  they are international servers, not english servers
---
As an American English speaking person who has had to read the same post in every single "Streamers are bad" topic of "Ha ha, glad I play on EU servers" allow me a moment to take the time to reflect and Ha ha aha ha ha aha HA HA HA HA ***AH HA HA HA HA!***           
---
              
---
That is all.
---
I would sign this petition.
---
I get why they are doing layering. The current gaming culture would flip out at hours long queues in the first week if they didnt do something. If you think i'm wrong then you clearly haven't seen how people in this community reacted to having difficulty getting into the STRESS TESTS. If something similar happend at launch Blizz would be mocked as greedy company who didnt allocate enough resources fir a successful launch just to save some $$ on servers. This game would never take off due to the huge amount of negative press they would get. The dream for me would be just have a bunch of servers that are pop capped at 3500 but thats just not a feasible business strategy. Realistically i think they should have just stuck with there original plan and kept sharding in for the few opening zones but i assume they either couldn't make that work or they gauged the outcry of the "no sharding crowd" to be too detrimental to the health of the game. The main problem with layering is its all or nothing. You cant tweak what zones or levels are getting layered. Which is what OP current concern is. 
---
TLDR; Layering is a very imperfect system that will hurt the game but blizz is in a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation because gamers nowadays cant handle queues.
---
Orrrr, you could make up your own story and "prove your worth" by doing other things. I really don't think you can make a good argument about how the first "kill 10 boars" quest is important to the story.
---
[fixed it for ya](https://imgur.com/a/w5KsBVE)
---
There's no way to "fix" layering without breaking the game even more. Players needs to be able to jump through layers to group up. You could force players to jump through hoops to swap layers but then you're just making the issue of layering even worse. Instead of a small immersion breaking thing that happens sometime, it becomes something you actively have to work around every time you group up with someone. 
---
So yeah some people are going to jump through layers are get 2 or 3x more mats in the "same" node or whatever. It doesn't really matter. Pserver respawn timer are shorter than vanilla because of how massive the servers are anyway.
---
I feel like a lot of people are overreacting to a lot of small things on this sub. If anything, that melee range looks like the worst thing so far, to me. It's the first "bug" I've seen that will actually impact day-to-day gameplay and seems like a massive advantage to give to melees.
---
I can't wait for all the streamers to find out playing WoW Classic and saying "thanks for the sub" every few minutes was only a viable source of income because they had exclusive access.
---
Or they could do it the most fair way they can, and select accounts
---
99% sure you got into the Beta stress test, not the full Beta. Either way, yea, your character gets deleted. The purpose of the beta/stress test is to find bugs and help polish the game, not to progress your character - You have to wait until 8/27 for that.
---
Well, if Blizzard wont make it official, we can still make unofficial language realms. I'm assuming in the upcoming weeks before launch the different language groups will start to claim realms once the names are out. Hopefully we will have time to organize it so we can safely choose a realm on launch day.
---
I think it goes a level beyond just "I watch stuff that I can't do myself," because watching games you can't play doesn't really explain streamer culture as a whole. I believe it has more to do with people who want to feel part of a community and interacting (or as much "interaction" as a 10-messages-a-second receipt-sized ream of nonstop textual diarrhea can be) with their favorite internet celebrities.
---
The reason for that may be similar to why people join cults/gangs/internet hacktivists, because they want to feel or be part of something. This exists in sports fans to a milder degree, because instead of saving *"Yankees won,"* they'll be like *"We won,"* even though they have no actual connection or personal affiliation to the team despite treating it like they do.
---
I get this all the time in retail with random dungeon groups. Nine times out of ten there is someone who's DBM is reporting in a language other than English.
---
Is there a run down on the abuses OP is referring to. I didn't get into the beta and haven't really been following, other than just being aware they opted to Layer everything until a a pre-determined time.
---
Dynamic respawns is certainly the lesser of two evils. Thinking about ganking is not considering the greater picture. Were talking about neets being able to destroy server economies because layering is so easily abused.
---
Shrek bless you.
---
Here is your dream weapon:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18717
---
There's better healing gear out there but that's the best you'll get for a 2h.
---
You can still pvp/dungeon with it but probably no raiding.
---
Yeah but what about *me*? I want to level without any interruption or competition! I can't handle waiting! It's all about me me me me me!!
---
Druid maybe?
---
Tauren is gonna be the new meta.
---
Daze basically has a 15 yard range now
---
What the heck is going on in the top right? Did someone donate / sub?
---
Private servers also had 50k queues on launch. I remember putting myself into queue when I woke up and still be in queue when I came home. This will be the reality without layering.
---
I think its less about entertainment and more about people looking for that recognition "Oh thank you so much __deerlord__ for that follow and the 5 dollars!  Super appreciate it bud!" or " __deerlord__ just resubbed for 6 months running, what a guy!  Super appreciate it bud!  Lets hear it in chat for __deerlord__".
---
Don't even get me started on lonely neckbeards donating to female streamers who don't even stream games.  Twitch has gone straight off the deep end into a garbage platform ever since they opened up the "just chatting" bullshit.  It PG-13 cam girls and don't try to tell me its anything else.
---
Yeah no jumping is hands down the biggest reason I don't play casters.
---
It's just retarded as a non-native english speaker to be forced to speak english. You will not be able to give answers in different accents (or different jokes) etc. - so most of us in the blizz forum wish to play it with so many #NoChange 's as possible.
---
There was already a video posted showing people layering in combat. It was done on demand last night. The video is posted on this subreddit.
---
If you could choose a layer when you made your character and weren't allowed to ever layer hop, that would be great, but right now you can switch layers by simply joining a group.
---
I had the ToEP ZHC combo before the nerf and had tons of fun with it one-shotting people.
---
Really sad this won't be possible in Classic, if it was I'd consider making a mage again.
---
As an American English speaking person who has had to read the same post in every single "Streamers are bad" topic of "Ha ha, glad I play on EU servers" allow me a moment to take the time to reflect and Ha ha aha ha ha aha HA HA HA HA AH HA HA HA HA!
---
If that were the case why even have the debuff? By the nature of your post that's just not even true.
---
What I don’t understand is how will I know, come August 27th, which server the streamers are on? Like what if I jump in and pick a server and there is a shit load of streamers on it?
---
Also how will I know which server to pick if I wanna play on a popular server (non streamer) one?
---
Vanilla had server transfers right?
---
Second
---
I thought people grow out of conformism
---
Sounds good man! I'll add you up when classic rolls around in a couple months.
---
Oh god, I never thought about Layering. Play the game for ~2 months thinking everyone mostly speaks your language and then BAM, refugees from everywhere stealing your pints and biscuits.
---
Nah, its great! I asked to be proved wrong lol. Gonna try and find the full patch notes for 2.0.
---
Moving through the Mithril Order questline and actually using the gear at level as I unlocked it felt so rewarding.
---
Well, undead and orcs are more badass then elves :)
---
Past 20 you have a ton more options for zones to level in though and this is when the "pack" begins to spread out a bit more. Also this is when contested zones start coming into play which I am against having layering for entirely.
---
I played alliance for Vanilla, BC and WotLK, before swapping for Horde in MoP. Logic dictates that I should play horde now, especially since I am on the bring of rolling a warlock and I enjoy the pvp side of the game a lot, but I am going to play Classic for the nostalgia and to rekindle with my early days and for that reason alone, I am almost sure I will stick with Alliance.
---
It's not just about not knowing English well enough or not being comfortable in English. The community is completely different on German realms. Some like it, some don't - but with this decision, you're forcing people who like all-german realms to play in a way they don't want to. 
---
Also, I played on German realms in my teens and this is how I want to experience classic. 
---
It's like you bring back a popular product but change a major part of it so it's totally not what you expected and like.
---
Yeah, no really only part of a solution
---
the real question is how many people who role healer will actually be decent at it?
---
Like what's the problem here? The majority of people from france, germany and other big countries  are capable of speaking english to some degree! I play dota with russians that barely speak a word english everyday, and even they will speak english when they need to! If people need to find people for a group or something they'll use english if needed! As for finding a guild there will garantueed be enough english speakers to create full english-speaking guilds! I honestly dont't really see the issue here if it's not u being upset worldchat will be filled with gibberish? I think we have more present concerns with classics current state, i.e layering abuse etc.
---
Say it like what?
---
Warlocks are a fantastic class, they get pets, they get cool spells, they have excellent utility (summons, healthstones).
---
That's not going to make a big difference on an already well populated server
---
I also get the drop down thing, but mine says I don't have game time left (which I do) so I guess blizzards fucking with us again
---
I have no problem with coming into contact with the different cultures, actually I look forward to that.
---
The only issue is that a significant portion of people from the larger communities in EU (French, German, Spanish, etc.) want to play within their own communities. It's a legitimate wish and relevant enough to there being already language based realms in retail. English native speakers are a fraction of the EU population, and while a lot of non brits can speak English fine, there's still a lot of people that speak no or little English, or that do speak English but prefer to be interacting with others in their own languages still.
---
Most of all, it'll result in realms being claimed as unofficial language realms, meaning I might end up picking a realm at the start where, 3 months later, everyone is speaking French, or Polish, or something. At least with language based realms, we will know where people who are open to interact with others in English are.
---
Literally just talking in General chat while standing around waiting to tag mobs was so enjoyable.
---
DAE going to level slow???
---
Can’t wait for streamers to get sniped all fucking day. I’m rolling ally too, looking forward to it.
---
My friends and I are from Germany and I wouldn’t care tooo much because like in every  online game you mostly speak English anyways. But there are 3 German speaking countries, that’s not a small number.
---
I'm so used to having only blues and purples, that I will vendor all grays no matter what. No way I'm actually going to equip a gray.
---
This is the comment that finally made me leave this sub.
---
How is selecting accounts more fair? A random chance would be fair. Then hand selecting accounts would naturally great some sort of bias. 
---
You were right about something tho. It wasn't a loot box. Loot boxes always have at least something in them. Lots of people subbed for the first month and got nothing out of it. I'd say they got "access to BFA" but not only did they not want that, but you need to buy the xpac still.
---
that's fair, i didn't see that. that seems like a pretty big oversight, so i hope they address it.
---
EU can’t access yet, that is the stress test. US only
---
this will be great
---
And as a native english speaker i can guarantee I'd prefer to play with other people.  But I ended up on a Swedish server in vanilla wow by chance and it was never an issue.  Everyone spoke english.  You would enter a party and the first thing asked was "swe?"  When you answered no, it was no issue and the conversation proceeded in English.
---
Scandanavia have impressive english skills but Germany are not far behind.  
---
My point being that if a German person levels to 60 and his choice is between rerolling or speaking English most of the time.....he's going to speak english.
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
I get that message sometimes too. Very odd.
---
the needs to be upvoted to over 9k
---
Just take it and forgettaboutit
---
&gt; This is going to result in insane amount of anti-insert nation here.
---
Blizzard is doing Trump's work...trying to break up the EU.
---
If you didn't get an advantage from this you wouldn't do it. So pay to win.
---
Sure after we found a solution for the EU server structure desaster.
---
Shaman boxing is always a good time. I say give it a try, even if it takes more time.
---
In the beta holy SPELLS dealt extra damage to undead. It was removed before the game went live.
---
They said they were only going to have the layering system on for a month tops, right?
---
I don't see the problem.
---
I opted in before i saw that it required a sub, no sub from me blizz bye so no beta (:
---
twas a big upgrade for me
---
So they should be releasing germans servers really not Russian and leaving it at that if that’s how vanilla was?
---
Probably even true. *Stresstest Starts* &gt; literally 80% of EU sleeping. *guess EU doesn’t want to play classic then*
---
Private servers had folks around the world playing at different times of the day. Try packing all of them into a single time zone on a single server then we can talk about how 30k is "awesome".
---
Layering can absolutely be tuned conservatively to keep competition in layered zones.  If I had to guess, they will likely try to keep an equal level distribution across active layers, and keep them near the original server pops.  That is probably the best solution to simulate classic.
---
So playing Rogue is quite different from what it was last time around. Leaning towards mage now.
---
Damn, 50,000 gold for $7.99.
---
I hope I can get 1000g for that price in Classic.
---
This and there is Finkles Lava Dredger in MC for when you are raiding. Will have to fight the druids for it though.
---
I mean it's odd that we can now install the client but not able to login. Guess just to get us prepared so we can login as soon as the eu test takes place.
---
So how do you feel about the debuff limit?
---
It's the exact same thing as leeway, in that it's an old school engine limitation issue, that gimps certain aspects of classes.
---
Your average EU dungeon group when Classic launches:

Mr perfect over here never makes a missplay, alright dude.
---
Why does this comment make me feel old. I thought millennials were kids
---
Well I'd agree that Grinding is the worst of your list, but not when you're in a group. You put BGs at level 2, they are basically just linear grinds with cool loot.
---
So Questing&gt;Grinding, but GroupGrinding&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SoloQuesting.
---
I'd agree completely.  I don't mind the streamers.  They can be entertaining enough at times, even Asmond and soda who seem to get the most flak, but boy those chat streams are pure cancer.
---
It is selected at random....
---
Also they were up front about needing a sub, people have known this, so people have no right to bitch because they subbed expect an invite.
---
Hell there are people like myself who have dubbed since beta for vanilla and don't have access,  people need to quit whining
---
Yeah, there were definitely more than enough people even with layering that it felt close to a full population server of old
---
Multiboxing shamans with lava blast is high quality entertainment
---
If you think exploiting mobs respawns doesn't so that the you have no idea how resources work
---
oh, but I will be :)
---
Intet dansk? Det er for dårligt!
---
Throughout WoW I've been grateful to hide gear in forms.
---
Also, resistance gear was ez mode feral tank gear. I loved it.
---
Yep, Thursday was holiday in most of Germany and many people like me took one day off on Friday. But guess only NA is important
---
Typical Germans, banding together to seize territory from their European neighbors. Probably end up keeping the non-Germans on your claimed server confined in the Lordamere Internment Camp.
---
whats even more shocking is that people give them real money too!!! lots of it sometimes. Even more shocking sometimes they even give some video game streamers real money based on their looks! How strange.
---
:p
---
Segðu bara að víkingarnir tóku yfir París eitt sinn og við værum óhræddir að gera það aftur.

Pally’s is also the reason why alliance dominate pvp.

why so sad? if they are friends from diferent countrys this is good for them since they get the chance to play together
---
Stream sniping, not ganking, thats what is murky but he clarified it on this clip and stream, he said it but this sub and other places exploded on misunderstanding the statement
---
Did someone say [[Donnerzorn, Gesegnete Klinge des Windsuchers](https://de.wowhead.com/item=19019/donnerzorn-gesegnete-klinge-des-windsuchers)]?
---
Man, I still remember how my friends and I used to laugh about the first few localized names when Blizz started to translate stuff for the German version of the client. 
---
Laughter all around because it all sounded so ridiculous – since we were used to the English names from playing until then.
---
*“Haha, if they continue like that someday Ironforge will be called Eisenschmiede."* 
---
*"LMAO, can you imagine?! They would never go THAT far, it's a capital city after all. No need to translate names for stuff like cities”*
---
Little did we know that sometime later that was exactly what IF would be called. Still feels *off*.
---
What's your point? The "enemy of classic wow" talk was of course exaggerated. The point is that these 2 mechanics will in my opinion impact the gameplay in a negative way.
---
There are ton's of other mechanics that are going to change the gameplay aswell (e.g. 16debuff slots from start, 1.12 itemization/talents/skills, etc.) that are also not authentic to classic. However, they seems more reasonable then leeway does. It was a mechanic for old clients with terrible unstable internet connection just as the 8debuff slot limit was for weak servers. They change the debuff slot limit to be 16 from the start and even admitted that they would completly remove it, but it has too much of a balancing impact.
---
I'd just be happy if they think about the leeway mechanic the same way.
---
Streamers like Lirik or Forsen are listed as having a high impact but I doubt they will be playing for longer than 2 weeks since WoW is not their main game. Asmongold is probably the most impactiful streamer there since WoW is all he plays.
---
&gt;&gt; this guy wants classic that isn't quite classic and is modified to make queue times shorter and reduce the number of dead servers shortly after launch , nice
---
Clearly you've never watched sports or met anyone who does
---
Just no
---
As is tradition!
---
Honestly if you dont know how to speak english in 2019, you and the country you represent is trash. If you feel the need to force your 0-value language (like german, wtf?) then you are - again - trash
---
Solo and Rogue One aren't "the sequels".
---
TFA's plot and character is so similar that it has the same themes as A New Hope.
---
TLJ is a dumpster fire, but so are the Prequels.
---
The argument between sharding and layering is pointless. The former is ugly and the latter is much more efficient. The only argument should be about how many weeks into launch should layering be removed - I would say week 3 but I have no idea if that's close to what they're expecting. However, it seems the true problem is giving players the ability to switch layers easily to form groups cross-layer. I propose that we should restrict group invites from changing layers unless the group members are at a city or at the very least a resting zone. This would eliminate "runners" and also "mass teleporting" which are the only feasible abuses I can think of with the layering technology. I think if you and your friends all form a raid group and get in the same layer right away, you're probably never going to switch between layers and lose out on that "I saw this dude weeks ago at stonetalon haha" feels.
---
Black lotus farming, and thorium farming is going to be abused. Why does this matter? Because these are used to craft high end and often times BiS or pre raid BiS items and potions. And not only that but rare spawn manipulation will be abused with people going after rares that drop nice items like Tidal Charm. If it stays in I know I personally will be abusing the system, even if its a shitty thing to do
---
Lmao these kids are hilarious ..

Good luck, this petition will be ignored by everyone at Blizzard.
---
The suggestions I made would have to have some very sound programming logic behind it. For example every time you group with a player he gets a +1 in the code which will make him more likely to be in the same layer as yourself it the future.
---
Frankly I dont have much faith in layering and I agree it will severly harm the social aspects of the game.
---
It won't be an accident. Every server will be German speaking, every server will be French speaking, etc.
---
If ~25% of the EU playerbase (Germany) can't support their own server, then Blizzard isn't going to give 100% of the playerbase more than a couple servers to choose from.
---
My guess is 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP. For the entire continent (minus Russia).
---
If something can be exploited it - Always Has, Always Will
---
No, it’s not. That’s the classic solution to launch issues. Layers are another solution to launch issues, but they are not the only solution or even the best solution. Blizzard is a business and must make a cost effective decision with technology. Adapting shards into layers to solve this problem cheaply is a preferred solution (not due to user experience but cost) to a different solution that might take more planning or engineering work. 
---
Blizzard is a business more than a gaming company. Maybe they were more of a gaming company in 2000 with Diablo 2, or 2004 with the classic launch, but that’s not the company they are today. For the most part, it’s not even the same people.
---
you can literally melee from 10 yards away as a tauren
---
Most of those people will be Spriests, ret pallys and ele shaman. Always need more healers. Additionally looking at those polls Druids were near the bottom. So if you want to heal and are worried about competition then roll Druid.
---
The issue is, they won't. There will be 100% unofficial German/French/Italian/Spanish etc servers and if you rolled on one and don't speak the language, too bad, you'll just have to reroll and start on another server.  
---
Back in TBC and Wrath I remember servers that were designated national servers and that happened when the bigger languages were officially separated.
---
Back then we had tons of servers so a few of them being unplayable for everyone that was not from a specific country was bad but not to the degree it will be with classic.
---
If countries with a population that is 1/10 of germany or france had their designated servers all of the big countries will have theirs in classic.
---
He saw the totem and wanded it; bad move imo. With the range he had he should have just shot 2 r1 frostbolts at the shaman (or 3). Cone of cold to keep him out of melee if necessary. He let a shaman walk right up to him, that's just rookie play
---
I don't really have a problem with that as long as people understand that you should try to communicate in English when other people are around. What ended up happening is that the server community felt smaller because a part of it sort of isolated themselves from the rest.
---
I'm a literal genius and everyone else aka you is an IMBECILE
---
Jumping around and hanging out is part of the game...
---
I'm probably going to get downvoted or questioned for proof but theres a large overlap of conservative incel neckbeard community and the classic wow community. I don't quite understand it myself but theres something about nostalgia for old times past and the popularity of free private servers that attracts the conservative neckbeards. 
---
I'm not going to write a dissertation on it for the people who ask me cite my sources but I will point you in the direction of looking at top upvoted memes here. Do a search for "chad" or "virgin."
---
No, people are advocating for instead of the continent layer to the all 1-30 lvl zone layers. From 30-60 no shards, no layers, 1 megalayer. When you enter less than 30 lvl zone you are back to your personal layer.
---
Idk man honestly i just watch streamer speedruns and stuff while im lying in bed and dont feel lile dling anything else and ignore the chat...im sure for some people the community is a huge thing but imo not for me
---
The concurrent active playercount won't be any bigger than in classic.  3000 player per layer.
---
Since servers consist of multiply, dynamic layers the language and the distribution of it will be even further fucked up.
---
Seems silly, people will just make 'unofficial' language realms
---
It's your life to do with it what you choose. If min maxing professions in a 15 year old video game is what you enjoy then enjoy it, life is too short not too have some fun while we can.
---
Nice troll
---
No, he said anyone "being a total sperg" gets Blacklisted. That's entirely based on his opinion. And we already know streamers accuse others of sniping simply because they lose.
---
Don't you guys have google translate ?
---
I never said it indicated TLJ. I said it made the enthusiasm for the movie high. If it was awesome people would be super happy right now.
---
How would that even be possible that thered be ”german, italian, french, spanish etc” servers, when there is only going to be 2 pvp servers.
---
Languags barrier imagine how many Italians will be have to watch Norwegian, English, and Polish LFGs and Prof ads in Trade and shit. Now multiply that by every language in Europe.
---
Most french people hate speaking english if they are even good at it. you're supposed to have fun playing the game, not having to work to even understand people. This will deter quite a lot of French, and it's obviously not a good thing.
---
Just left my house and it turns out not everyone speaks German, do you think the entire world is a small part of Europe? Enjoying playing with an international community and enjoying understanding the people you are playing with are not mutually exclusive.
---
That’s awesome. Blizzard customer support is a1
---
I actually think Mage/Rogue/Paladin would be much stronger in World PvP, if we are talking Vanilla.
---
That’s why I’m saying just buy up to iron grenade, which should only be a few stacks of copper/tin/iron right?
---
I say skinning because I won’t have to ever stop and intentionally farm it. Just focus solely on leveling and vendor the leather. 
---
Maybe I’ll just say fuck it and do skinning/LW and reroll one at 60. Or herb alch and make some fun pots.
---
What does it means layering?
---
I'm feeling entitled because there is 2 italia swearwords
---
And how many languages do you speak Mr.Racist-polyglot? Or aren't you the same monolingual idiot you wouldn't play with yourself?
---
How is stream sniping any different than ganking? Sounds like he's bitching about getting ganked before the game has even launched. QQ
---
Lieder = songs in German. Pronounced like "leader".
---
is this going to be fixed? 
---
if this goes live I'm not going to be playing Classic... this is just too much and will make playing caster/ranged classes at a big disadvantage
---
The whole point of playing classic is because Blizzard sucks at making changes, if they modify anything the WILL fuck it up, I guarantee it. If you want to play with Blizzard's changes then just play BFA (aka steaming pile of shit)

As a german myself that is fluent in English and has to speak it all day, I prefer to play in a german community and chill, because for some people it is slightly more demanding to speak in a foreign language for a longer time and it is no shame if they want to avoid that in their free time.
---
I speak most of my games in english, but in an  MMO i prefer more even ground in social interactions.
---
Water. Fruit. A very loving and understanding wife who (no /s) genuinely understands the hype I've got and understands I've booked a week off work for launch. Who'll make meals and the like that week. Amazon prime now for when I run out of fruit/water or something else I need.

Stay healthy and hydrated guys and gals. No video game is worth being ill over.

No
---
Just replied this to bpusef. They will also go with the 16 debuff limit from the start because 8 was a technical limitation.
---
They would even completly remove it, but it would have too much of a balance impact. True, it would make some specs more viable (e.g. balance druid) but it was a balancing decision to keep it.
---
The leeway mechanic gives melee classes the ability to hit e.g. priests outside their psychic scream range. So while a rogue/warrior is hitting you in "melee" range, you can't fear him. Feels a bit weired in my opinion.
---
I am fine about it tho since I am going to roll warrior :)
---
Well, don't forget that you're gonna have most of the streamers. Really wondering what will ruin the classic experience more.
---
Side note about the layering "abuse" links in the video. Are we expecting people to multibox to abuse this? Are they just having friends afk in other layers? Or are they taking the time to log off, switch for them, etc.  - it doesn't actually seem like that big of a deal to me.
---
Sure, if you want to wait until then. Most guilds, PUG United included, are getting their respective teams together in Discord now. Classic thrives on community and we are building ours in the lead up. If that changes your mind at all, hmu on bnet and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. 
---
Regardless of your decision, best of luck out there!
---
I used to think he was alright, but then during the first Arathi Highlands battle between his raid and the raid of Sony/Venruki I noticed that he would be freaking out about people in his raid when they were a bit out of position. He would just focus so hard on harshly criticizing these real people who were probably watching the stream (who by the way were there of their own volition to help him farm for his WW axe) which left a really bad taste in my mouth. And I haven't watched him recently but when I was watching I remember having expected him to be more skilled given how long he's played WoW.

---
How true that is! Are you my colleague I was talking to about that last night, lol.
---
They do. Read the post (and the forum thread, it's worth it.)
---
Layering is making me want to wait until they remove it to start a character. It's really killing the hype and this is coming from someone who played Vanilla for years.
---
As if I would respect the opinion of someone who took a photo and then uploaded it.
---
My guild did the same thing, there was an addon back then that you could use to to sign up for the raid, similar to the version of the Calendar in retail now.
---
We had an alliance with 3 other guilds to fill out the full 40 man raid.
---
HAH. Trying to get me to resub early to save my name? F U C K that.
---
Tell that to Diablo 3. Its servers got so swarmed on launch day that it was unstable for weeks. People were absolutely furious, forums were littered with complaints and people to this day still rant about Error 37.
---
Long story short, rough launches are definitely a big deal and something Blizzard needs to avoid at all costs unless they want to get slammed from every side.
---
World bosses aren't the only thing that's abusable and imo not the biggest thing, farming rare materials in several layers will be devastating for the economy (things like black lotus &amp; devilsaur leather). And not to mention the effects on world pvp.
---
Also if they have layering for a couple of weeks or during phase 1 people that gets to 60 in a week will have several weeks of farming mats on different layers which will speed it up immensely and make them super rich easily.
---
I can see why layering in the start will be necessary but having it for more then 2 weeks while not limiting it to starting zones will heavily fuck things up. 
---
People are worried because of the effect it can make, that's it.
---
Hitting people from 10-11 yards with melee attacks just seem really dumb though. How does nerfing this affect the game negatively?
---
1) Wing clip attacks at the same distance as melee attacks. I tested it. I wasn't attacking through walls so this is not really relevant.
---
2) Ok.
---
3) The data does line up. Human vs human is 5 yards center to center. It is the same for all non tauren races. (Couldn't test dwarf/gnome/night elf). While there may be different ways to come to the melee range distance, the calculations I put in will yield the correct result. Human vs human melee = 5 yards, minimum deadzone = 11 yards, autoshot (35yd) range = 38 yards. It is easy to test and see that
---
4) I'll test vs non-physical abilities later, but I don't think the range is calculated differently.
---
Regarding the picture. To clear some things up.
---
The fem tauren vs fem tauren was hitting at 8.8 yards.
---
Using my calculation, 3 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 1.4 = 8.8 yards. This adds up.
---
You applied the calculation to human vs human, but as I said this calculation is only meant to be used when one of the players is a tauren. If nobody is a tauren, player sphere = 3 yards, melee range = 2 yards from sphere for a total of 5 yard melee.
---
Let me know if there is something we are still not on the same page on, but hope I cleared that up.
---
&gt; He's probably the best mage to ever play the game lol
---
not at all
---
Why wouldn't you care if they play on your server? Unless you're a fan of X streamer, you probably wouldn't want to see your server's world/trade chat getting spammed about whatever X streamer is doing.
---
Best Wpvp trios in Vanilla are probably:
---
Rogue/Mage/Hpaladin
---
Warrior/Mage/Hpaladin
---
Warlock/Spriest/Hpaladin
---
Connecting to Classic should require a dialup then. I never melee'd from 12 yards away in vanilla.
---
Glad we can agree on something
---
Biggest first languages in europe:
---
1. German \~ 95 million speakers
---
2. French \~ 80 million speakers
---
3. English \~ 70 million speakers
---
&gt;Hahahaha - you realize that adding layers is the same solution as adding more realms. Both are just dispersing the player base. Except one major exploit potential.
---
&gt;&gt;Adding more layers is the same solution as adding more realms.
---
&gt;&gt;Same solution
---
You mention exploit potential of one, but ignore all the potential issues with multiple servers.  That's why your solution is bad.  Throwing out criticism and half assed solutions makes you sound dumb.
---
This is fine on a micro scale, but if Blizzard turns off enough people from Classic, the game will die and they'll just shut the servers down.
---
Looks about right. The Norwegian is messed up as per usual.
---
You're joking right? You didn't even know who he was two comments up lol. He's one of the most decorated PvPers of all time.
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
---
Seems like Blizzard is expecting a ton of people to quit after the initial swarm of people.  I'm sure they are only doing this because they don't want 80% of say Italian players to quit and have a dead Italian server.  Would probably be better to just risk it then merge if necessary.
---
There's a point to what you're saying, but mind that it's not that black and white either. The sites streamers use such as Twitch take cuts too, no different from the execs of cable companies.
---
Yeah and on this clip (maybe not, on the stream though), he clarified what sniping meant for him and how he would perceive it, and i honestly agreed with him, and he himself admitted that if he acted petty he hoped people would call him out on it, and while a lot of streamers act like you just described, soda for the while i watched him, enjoyed the competition/being ganked.
---
Exactly why they had to stop reporting player numbers on earnings calls.
---
Connecting to Classic should require a dialup. I never melee'd from 12 yards away in vanilla.
---
How will this work on pvp servers? I get ganked so I just switch layers?  This doesn't belong in classic...
---
wow this comment gave me the most intense vanilla nostalgia I've had since classic announcement.
---
Wait what? 2 servers for millions of people? 
---
Even if only 1 million people in the EU will play on the pvp realms, that's 500k each. That's a little more than the Vanilla 3k.
---
This is the real *Beta* for azeroth. Im sure they know about it. I support doing a petition. No harm is done by doing it.
---
I just reactivated my sub today (hadn't even ran out yet, lol) but couldn't get in anyway because it just said active subscription was needed. Could be because I'm EU though, not sure since I haven't read anything about this test.

Wish I could join everyone currently playing :(

Tell that to a majority of the French who can speak English about as you can with a soggy baguette shoved down your throat.

And from “we’re looking at sharding only in the early zones” to “we’re going to use layering for 2 weeks” to “layering will last through the first phase”.

Great, so he'll have no problem being corpse camped 24/7 if he ends up on my server. Good to hear.

That is so much truth. Probably the main reason I haven't taken any other classes with any seriousness. I've leveled a few DPS toons but mostly just to PvP with

Won't be available in Phase 1 though, will it?

Man if I'm in a group of 3 rogues and I see 3 hunters flaring the area up, I'm just gonna go find easier prey. Rogues always choose their fights.
---
I guess you don't see the hypocrisy.
---
Layering = bad even though if they had this tech in Vanilla they would've 100% used it so we didn't have notoriously large login queues and server instability. Blizzard proposes a change using newer technology to allow players to actually play the game when it releases and will turn it off when the server load decreases = enemy of the game.
---
But we can use better tech to increase debuff limits which has 100x the impact that layering will on the game as a whole and we need to remove features from the game because newer tech dictates that it's no longer necessary. But waiting in queue for an hour and being unable to tag any mobs is the true authentic experience we need to preserve.
---
Is the Bobby B bit here now?

I THOUGHT BEING KING MEANT I COULD DO WHATEVER I WANTED!
---
This could end up being a dealbreaker for me and many others. Imagine rolling on a server and after one or two weeks you realize that you are the minority and nobody wants (or can) interact with you. I won’t have the time nor the motivation to reroll. This will also destroy all the community feeling that was so special to Classic. 
---
I mean, as a German I’m not that bad in English and I can easily understand native speakers, but putting together all Europeans and force them to speak English is gonna end in a shitfest and hostility. Just play a CSGO or DOTA match.
---
I was really hyped for classic and blizzard seemed to do a great job, but they are putting everything they did at risk with this stupid decision.
---
Bro 13 years. It’s okay. *tears* we are going home.

I am rolling warrior though I have mained a paladin for 14 years. I will always be a paladin at heart. I miss “Paladin Chat” was a brotherhood like no other. Good times
---
Blizzard is acting like they expect a ton of people to quit shortly after launch.
---
oi bruv u got a loiscence for that argument fam
---
It really doesn't effect me in the slightest but I want the game to succeed and if people want language specific realms then they should get them.
---
If they can't fix it get rid of it. I will happily say that.
---
&gt; I think also for the barrens and west fall, there’s really not too many levelling options around then
---
There is actually four zones for alliance at that level (Darkshore, Westfall, Loch modan, red ridge) and three for Horde (Barrens, Silverpine, stonetalon mountains).
---
They're not creating designated servers for specific languages, meaning overall there will be a large variety of nationalities on each servers. So how is that a problem that will arise? People will communicate using primarily english, for groupfinding and other social interactions, if people wanna speak french, russian etc they will do do within rheir respective guild, the server will be english overall! People with second languages needs to stop being such snowflakes, 2019 anyone, myself with another primary language is expected to use english, if you're not willing to conform, check yourself..
---
Ion said it'll be removed a few weeks after launch. I'm not too worried about it's effects if they're only around for a bit to aid the launch.

It looks really dumb when you're hitting an inactive target running into a rock

Most abbreviations are different for Dungeons, Raids, Cities though.

It’s mind boggling seeing people defend layering. There should no layering anywhere in the game period.
---
It's not a matter of "can", it's "won't ".
---
What would be your solution to people who want to play on an RP, PVE, or PVP server specifically?  3 servers for each European country who’s native language is not English? How would you possibly populate those?
---
*Actually* controversial opinion:
---
No sharding. No ~~sharding on steroids~~ "layering." No whatever the hell Blizzard decides to call the next abomination birthed from sharding but don't call it that will be.
---
Queues. Full servers. Add/merge them (aggressively) as needed.
---
Yes, it's ugly. Yes, it sucks. Sharding, by whatever name, sucks worse.
---
The folks at Blizzard keep saying they want to give us an authentic Classic experience then insist on adding this shit to it. I won't go so far as to say they actively *want* the game to fail, but they sure as hell seem to expect it to.
---
Which makes me wonder why they're going to all this bother in the first place.
---
I understand you're proud of this shiny new tech you created, but it thoroughly fucks any sense of community. It doesn't belong in the game. Give us Classic or don't, just stop half-assing things like this.
---
You forgot the Bier
---
Yea, it's people doing media shares donations.
---
Yeah I guess, but i think the video was just to demonstrate.. you can still use this to your advantage in real situations.
---
Yep, glad you see how foolish you've been.
---
There is a huge difference between no competition and literally hundred of new characters all trying to get through the same thing. I joined in the stress test late, the human starting zone was busy, had to join groups for better chance of killing stuff, and each person camping a spawn, which was fun, but add in an extra 1-200 people and it would be ridiculous.
---
This. Better to risk a few empty servers than to fuck up all of them.
---
True enough. One could also say watching streams isn't something that exactly needs completely undivided attention for many people as well.
---
Reputation was increased in patch 2.0.1 and not documented. Private server experience and reputation values are well known to be based off of post-TBC values. The experience itself was officially confirmed and fixed after a 3 day 9 hour speed run by a hunter named.... Varuk? I don't remember his name. Started with a V.  
---
They fixed the experience after that point.  
---
There has never been a solid address on private servers regarding reputation values and likely never will be because people will flip out that they can't get a Darnassus saber on their gnome by level 40.  
---
You will not find any database from the past that shows proper experience values. The only thing you can find are comments. You can find comments based on 1.12 patch and earlier, but you can also find comments from patch 2.0.1 from a particularly thorough guy who was doing the Stormwind quests. Go dig around in Stormwind reputation comments and you'll probably find him in there.  
---
The strongest evidence I have that less reputation is correct is a [comment by a level 25 human](https://web.archive.org/web/20060312175336/http://www.thottbot.com/?ccb=1&amp;v=500276) priest on March 12, 2006 (pre-1.12) who started in Shadowglen at level 1 in pursuit of a Darnassus sabre.  
---
Lets do some rough math with his quote:  
---
Thott Quote | Pserver value, roughly | % of total | Quote values | % Reduction
---
---|----|----|----|----
---
"All of Darn/Teld" | 9080 | 38.01% | 4104.81 | 45.21%
---
"All of Darkshore" | 10635 | 44.52% | 4807.79 | 45.21%
---
"Almost all Ashenvale" mod | 4175 | 17.48% | 1887.40 | 45.21%
---
 | 23890 |  | 10800 | 
---
"Almost all Ashenvale" 2 | 9080 | | | 37.51%
---
I took his quote about "Almost all of Ashenvale" and modified it to be only quests up to level 25. But included a calculation just for the hell of it that includes a simulation where he did every quest in Ashenvale at level 25 (highly doubt it but included it anyway)  
---
In the end though, I don't have to change your mind. I have a pretty strong belief that the reputation values in Classic are correct. Private server players have historically had a very hard time swallowing any idea that their private server reputation values are wrong. And that's okay too.
---
Also French?
---
name reservation takes place ~2 weeks before release. i think we will know where most streamers plan to go at that point, assuming they announce their plans
---
Layering: Not great, not terrible.
---
Languages: if you roll on the unofficial French server, have fun trying to decipher that and ending up in groups where all the other speak french and kick you when they realize you don't.
---
I didnt see this specific event but based on how he is, I would assume whatever horrible things he said was super deadpan sarcasm. That's what he does.

You will quit after 3 weeks if you screenshot your ding to 60 i will personally paypal 100 euros

I'm pretty sure at this point asmongold is a self fulfilling prophecy, he's what every basement nerd wishes they were, a guy who nerded out on WoW while going to school, then somehow getting enough of a following he could quit school and make a decent living nerding out even harder than he already used to.
---
I mean, it must be quite nice to make a good living working from home doing your hobby.  If you aren't some dipshit who has a completely different persona while you stream, it shouldn't be even remotely work like and risk burning you out.  If literally all you do is play your favorite game(s) and people eat it up, its not really any different than what you already did for free.
---
In asmons case I think a lot of people see themselves in him, not particularly amazing in any sense, basically mediocre, in both real life and in game, yet a very successful streamer.  I guess its almost like an underdog story?  Nerd bumbling through life playing video games in his free time becomes 6 figure income earner playing video games in moms basement, nothing really changed except the money in his bank account.
---
I don't really care for him, but hey, I can't say I wouldn't do the exact same thing if I had internet capable of streaming (lol DSL, rural life), and somehow garnered a following that let me quit my day job.  Realistically every one of us on this sub are total closet nerds who would love to just play games all day long.

This sub has gone to hell in a hand basket

Read the second sentence again rrreeal slow this time
---
You’re failing to understand the nuance between layering early zones and layering the entire continent
---
Because people are better at games than I am and I like to watch professionals. Professional CSGO and SC2 are a lot different than whatever shittier level I would be playing on.
---
You're either not European, or you haven't travelled around Europe, but either way you live in an illusion. Let me red pill you on the real world: French, Spanish and Italians are very bad at and ignorant of English, they don't care about it. That also goes for a big chunk of Germans, although I believe many German gamers are good at English because of gaming.
---
Well they surely won't sustain many German players after this news. Personally, I won't play classic under these conditions. It's not how I played classic, so why are they forcing players like me to play classic like this?
---
I speak 2 fluently and some german.
---
This is a terrible idea, Blizzard needs to change their mind about this!!
---
!remindme 60 days
---
I am pretty sure nobody abuses the anti-christ as much as layering will be abused.
---
On a more serious note: showcasing it's shortcomings in a beta is rather important. If nothing else changes at least more people will know about it and it will somewhat even the playingfield.
---
Besides - a lot of people are upset by how layering changes the feeling and gameplay. Feels more like an LFG-tool-era thing than vanilla WoW to a lot of us.
---
And what do people do when they not like something? they exagerate and cry on the forums, as is tradition.
---
I don’t see what other option they really have. The choices are questionable layering which can be exploited for pvp and pve reasons or we can have dead servers 3 months from now once the rush is over. Server mergers would be trash because people would lose their names and guild names. I’d rather take the chance at people messing with the economy (and literally give no shits about the pvp side) than risk being stuck on a dead server with no guilds raiding.
---
Then go play a single player game you whiny bitch, this is a "Massively Multiplayer Online" game, or did BFA make you forget that?
---
I mean, you could always just, idk maybe ask? How did people learn the memes of old? How do people learn the memes of new? We fucking talk to each other if we don't understand something. A young guy who likes to watch twitch probably would be willing to explain that monkaS means he is afraid. You can still just say "I think that is dum" and go your seperate ways. Stop hating to hate.
---
Was there? Maybe I honestly don't know for sure.
---
Hebrew?
---
Back then wasn't 1.12 itemization, it didnt have layering, cross realm bgs, loot trading, spell batching and billion other things i could mention, no this isn't how it was back then and 10 years of experience has taught us higher pop &gt; better experience. If you disagree you could always just roll on a lower pop server isn't of trying to ruin the game for people who enjoy that experience. 
---
Imagine a world where we both we what we want? CRAZY THOUGHT i know.
---
But... why? Who can't play classic if they want to? I wouldn't think there's that many people who either can't afford the subscription or don't have PCs.
---
What the actual fuck is that stream
---
You're giving streamers too much credit if you think one could single-handedly destroy a server. Yer not even gonna notice them, they usually run premades and have their own guilds, you would have to go out of your way to interact/be annoyed by one
---
&gt; You're joking right? You didn't even know who he was two comments up lol. He's one of the most decorated PvPers of all time.
---
WHAT are you talking about? when did I ever say I didn't know who venruki was lol? You must be a joke.
---
If you refer to this: "lvl 30 1v1 tournamet with buncha plebs (streamers) who never played the game before"
---
You just proved my point you aren't very bright but I'll explain. You have people like TipsOut, the big boy streamer bfa fanboy can't remember his name, people like this n others testing vanilla for the first time participating in the vanilla 1v1 tournament so it's a ass benchmark.
---
Venruki is not the best mage in this games history. if you believe that ur delusional
---
We do learn english at school. It just used to be completely useless for most people, and thus not liked that much, so not spoken that well.
---
Nowadays, it's required in some higher education school, like business schools. Still the minority.
---
&gt;So yeah some people are going to jump through layers are get 2 or 3x more mats in the "same" node or whatever. It doesn't really matter.
---
doesn't matter that a handful of players can take control of months' worth of endgame resources and control the economy. no big deal.
---
I don't layering and I do intent on outlevelling people.
---
If I'm in Un'Goro crater what's the reason for having layering there? There's going to be like 10 people in there. Can the server not handle 10 people?
---
Of course it can. There's absolutely no reason for the entire game to be layered. They just need to shard the lowbie zones.
---
Definitely getting that vibe here as of late too. Comes off as grumpy out dated neck beards as far as the eye can see.
---
I mean, I feel the same way about watching sports most of the time.  That being said, anyone good enough to be in professional sports is incredibly physically talented as well as mentally to know what to do and when while actually playing.  There are *far* fewer mechanically amazing players that stream compared to shitters like asmongold and sodapoppin who are just personality streams, because they certainly aren't incredibly talented players.  Why anyone likes their personalities is beyond me, but we have morning talk shows with even more vapid idiots that are insanely popular, so what do I know about what the masses like?.
---
there were french servers as well in Vanilla, and probably others too.
---
I doubt anywhere close to half who start will continue actively playing after the first week other than maybe logging on one or twice a month because friends pester them.  There's going to be a ton of rude awakenings that will pretty quickly quell population.
---
It didn’t matter you had multiple parties fighting over the same mobs, it was a complete cluster fuck on server 15
---
Fun fact, all of these items shouldn't be in phase 1 since they were added in patch 1.5
---
Layering. From Wowpedia. Layering is the World of Warcraft: Classic alternative to the sharding technology. It allows a realm to create several instances of itself to balance its own population, instead of balancing players around shards from multiple realms.
---
Lol, that's cute.
---
Nobody actually needs english in french, except if they work for some global companies. If there's no point in learning english, why the hell would you do it?
---
how are people still fucking sperging out over layering? do you not understand that devs want the exact same thing as we do? It has been explicitly stated in interviews that layering is a temporary feature that will be removed rather quickly. Would you rather have dead servers after a year, or layering for a month/few weeks? 
---
do you retards not trust Omar? classic will be great. layering will not ruin it. stop the circlejerk. 
---
They might even improve upon the tech after beta, making it smoother. who knows. but for now, stop being sperglords
---
I dont get it, blizzard rebrand sharding as layering and we are ok with it.
---
I think you should learn to read instead of imaging the words I didnt say. It's pretty apparent that this guy is a casual player.
---

Few weeks, that means I got couple weeks of black lotus farming with layer hopping, I'm gonna be richest person in the server.
---
No, fuck off with this argument. This is the exact same thing modern wow players have been saying since TBC was released. Blizzard kept adding bad features, and people like you would defend it with "Don't like it? Don't play it." It's not even an argument, it's just a waste of time.
---
&gt;Burning Legion intensifies
---
oh, woops i had a brain fart and thought it was both teldrassil for some reason
---
Lmao it's not about "tolerating" inconveniences is about not being able to actually do anything in game to progress.  
---
If I told you that your connection was so bad that you could only engage a mob once every 3 minutes or so, you would be pissed.  The fact that it's not a connection issue, it's an overpopulation issue doesnt make a difference.
---
Can't you just go to a different GY?
---
Same. With my odd shift I'll be lucky to get 50% attendance.
---
So, guess I'll play hunter or druid. lol
---
Above 40 DPS (and without caster stats):
---
Perdition's Blade, Core Hound Tooth, Gutgore Ripper from MC.
---
Felstriker and Finkle's Skinner from UBRS.
---
Alcor's Sunrazor and Scarlet Kris from BOE World Drops.
---
Heartseeker from Blacksmithing.
---
Darrowspike and Frightalon from Scolomance.
---
Bonescraper from Stratholme.
---
Fang of the Crystal Spider from LBRS.
---
That's not true at all? I'm doing it for the experience of leveling a Warrior with a support. I don't have anyone that wants to duo with me so why not do it myself.
---
Again, what benefit am I getting? You can't seem to answer this.
---
You're not making any rational argument or sense at all man.
---
Okay now do Gnomes
---
I feel like a lot of people commenting didn't read your whole post. You 100% should be rolling need on dps gear while leveling. Theres no such thing as dps or tank gear in dungeons while leveling so you're all rolling on the same stuff (just like caster dps and healer gear is the same). I think the only thing you might get some push back for is rolling on leather (and mail but only after 40) since you should be using plate. But even then if they aren't dumb they'll understand the lower armor is worth the good stats. 
---
That being said at lvl 60 when everyone is farming pre raid bis you should definitely mention when the group is formed/before hand that you want to roll on dps gear. 99% of the warriors tanking for pre raid bis will also want to roll dps gear so you aren't in the minority at all. Its very much the norm. Actually if you really want, since tanks will be so scarce, you can get away with reserving dps items. Or just not join groups with the rogues/hunters so theres no competition for your gear. I know it sounds scummy to do but tanks are just so rare that you have the power to do that if you wish. Im not advocating this practice im just saying its going to happen. So by all means roll the dps gear just let your group know.
---
Children as in up to age 10, most of the things after that were English with subs (drake and josh haha) for example.
---
It didn’t matter if you were in a group as there were many other parties fighting for the same mobs.
---
I heard there will only be very few servers in every region, how do I avoid streamers if they are on every server?
---
C'est de la merde !
---
I dont really see why people are pissed about this? Whats the big deal?
---
http://lorelol.ytmnd.com/
---
Thinking of naming my character Atuan
---
Get rid of this and spell batching. We don't want to physically emulate 2006 technology here, Blizz. lol
---
F
---
The same servers that couldn't render things 50 feet from you?
---
OH yeah, perfect comparison
---
Remember when the only people who streamed were talented players?
---
Yeah, those xfire days were golden.
---
There's an alternative, shard the lowbie zones.
---
You guys are constantly misrepresenting the issue. I haven't seen anyone claim no layering/sharding for a long time. Layering isn't the only option and it most certainly wasn't the original option presented.
---
&gt;Yeah seeing 5000 people in a level 1 zone is totally more immersive than seing 50-100. 
---
You're completely ignoring my point. Do you know how big layers will be? About 2000 players per layer. Do you really think that's not enough? Like seriously? Do you really think 500 people in Elwynn Forest is not "playing with other people" enough? Do you need to have 5000 people instead?
---
At least throw real arguments at me.
---
I intended to provide an unpopular opinion and I sense sarcasm in your answer or do you really believe layering will be abused by a large player base?
---
I've been seeing a lot of people say that druid is all but totally viable for most of everything but a few bosses in naxx. Thoughts?
---
Or what?
---
My sub ran out 3 hours into the test, I can relate to this...
---
I wasn't bashing asmon, that also goes for any hobby you really enjoy, me personally I would rather make it big on YouTube rather than twitch just because I feel like live streaming online games ruin a lot of fun with snipers/carries.
---
Ryan = Casual Boomer
---
Stop whining and speak the queens English
---
Is that why his teeth look like Mr. Ed, now?
---
I might do one, just for kicks. I never played Horde pre-Cata so I'd like to see the old cities.
---
I know there wasn't Spanish 100% because we had Spanish people leaving mid-late vanilla for the new Spanish servers. And I believe there was unofficial Spanish server. Also was no Italian or Russian.
---
Again, I just would have two accounts....what is the advantage?
---
Do you complain when someone can afford a 2nd car but you can't?
---
Do you complain if someone owns a home AND a cottage? Are they pay to winning at life?
---
I'm still waiting to hear what the advantage is and you're flat out ignoring that.
---
If someone is playing two accounts at once that means they're effectively playing each character half as effectively as the other one. That's a DISADVANTAGE, not an advantage.
---
In out of the loop. How does layering affect the game? Is it classics version of sharding?
---
“Hey, let’s NOT invite that guy that we invited for the first two stress tests and then complain when the servers aren’t stressed enough.”
---
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND the reason for that.
---
I'll bet, that's rough
---
Spicy.
---
Private servers don't have the dynamic respawns that Blizzard had back in Vanilla. The reason why it seems bad on private servers is because all the spawns are on a timer, whereas Blizzard had dynamic respawns that would adjust based on player vicinity.
---
Most streams do, to be fair.
---
&gt; the majority won't care that they couldn't start until 3 hours after launch 
---
Then that majority can wait 3 hours. I'd rather not have an enforced timer where some of my friends are in and playing and I'm not.
---
Sorry dude it's just not a very good bait.
---
Why? What about his choice isn't min max? Should the warrior be troll for dmg, or orc for pvp? Seems like UD is a pretty solid choice
---
Highwarlordstino put it all the way in, lol
---
Autoattack leeway is one thing I don't really care about, but leeway working with specials like kicks/mortal strike is broken
---
There are 24 official languages in the EU.
---
In Retail, six of them have official servers and the rest have plenty of servers to migrate to if they do a bit of research.
---
In Classic, all of these languages will be forced onto a handful of servers.
---
They originally said that they gonna put sharding ONLY in the starting zones for a few weeks. This is not good but its way better than layering for months. Layering is terrible, its going to cause way more problems than it solves.
---
Its is continent wide not only for the starting zones. It can and will be abused since you can easily hop layers by getting an invite from another one. You can hop layers to farm nodes and herbs, farm rare mobs, escape from pvp, or just to avoid crowded zones. Are you a mage aoe farming? Just hop layer so you dont have to wait for the mob respawns. Someone just killed the elite quest mob and now you have to wait 15m? Just ask your guild mates to spam invite you to get to a deffierent layer. The problem layering creates just goes on and on.
---
You think if you dont do this it wont affect you? It will! Imagine standing in crossroad and looking at ppl, you gonna see them disappear cuz they got an invite from another layer. Its very threatening to the community.
---
Layering is a terrible system, I know it will only be present during phase 1 but i still fear that this system will damage the game, the economy and the community. Im very sad to see so many players defending this system. What Blizz orignally purposed was not good but it was way better than layering.
---
IMO layering should not be continent wide. It should only be present in the starting zones and once you leave it you will be layerd to 1 realm where everyone plays and you cant hop between layers to abuse the system.
---
Claims to be from Europe then calls Europe abroad. Hmmm
---
Yeah... but if you're strafing you're moving at a slower rate in the direction the other play is running directly to meaning eventually you won't be able to hit them. Or if you're snared it doesn't matter anyway cus you won't move at all. It also doesnt change the frost nova range so its kind of a mute point. With that said, this should be removed.
---
thx
---
I did paladin(or priest, depending on mood), 1 priest and 3 mages. It worked quite well but I'll be rolling horde so it changes things.
---
Leveling is fine, just need to get to lvl a8 or so then dungeon all the way to 60.
---
Took me about 12 days of leveling(lot of breaks though) to do my team.
---
You get riposte 100%. You just get precision first.
---
The only thing this documents is the +1 range from being Tauren and the +1 range from chasing a target (because in all situations you will be chasing a target or kiting a target, not moving to attack a still or inactively moving target). Both are well documented.
---
Why ?  
---
in Europe it's 2019 and every idiot is able to speak engish and the ones that still need practice will learn very fast.
---
Why do you need to kill that specific mob? Shit man, do something more fun in the game instead. I don't understand everyone's obsession with solo grinding quests and ignoring the big MMO part of the game.
---
Remember to consider the fact that priests have race specific abilities. Undead get devouring plague DoT, while trolls get a personal buff that functions similarly to how lightning shield works for shamans.
---
This has never been done until recently, why the backlash. I've been playing MMOs with people that speak other languages since before WoW existed...
---
You multiboxing a character in STV and you meet a player. You have 2 chars, he has one, who wins? That's you.
---
You leveling 2 character to 60 takes you maybe 50% longer than leveling one, but for someone who didn't pay for an advantage he would have to level 2 full chars to 60 which total takes more time.
---
You farming gold you can 2man DME bosses, it's pretty easy to do so multitasking it won't be hard, you can farm 100g per hour, others can farm 50g because they have to split.
---
Yeah that's not an advantage at all..
---
Do these servers have unique player names? Are guilds unique to each layer? If they do, then it not layering at all, it's just more servers with independent communities, and merging them has the same issues that merging normal servers has.
---
If they're not completely independent realms, and guilds are cross-realm and names aren't, but the population is split up, how is that any better than what Blizzard is doing to begin with? That's basically just merged servers like they have on live, but they still have to split up the population... with layering.
---
or maybe they do those things and come home and play wow

Looking forward to play with streamers NOT
---
I am going to join the server that gets announced as the no-Streamers-allowed server, but if a few of them try to join, I'll be part of the contingent that forces them off.
---
Only a 2 min cooldown, and escape artist is a cast as well.
---
I'm jealous
---
Ironically coming from a Finnish person
---
For those who don't see the problem. Do you know that Wow is the kind of games to be played by all sort of categories of people? We are on reddit here but a lot of players simply are either old and did not have the opportunity to learn, didn't go to high school, never read / listen english films/tv shows etc. It tremendously changes the experience for those people to not being able to play in their native language.
---
Plus, unofficial communities naturally forming will destroy any hope of having coherent servers. Not everyone, but a lot of people will get frustrated by rolling on what will be the future official \[insert a language server \].
---
Plus, linking gear if someone plays with a non-english client simply will render communicating about gear borderline impossible (not even sure if you can see a link of an item not in your language).
---
Those who have played in pservers, by playing in a pserver, most players know what they are getting into, and it's already harder than simply installing official wow and subbing. You underestimate how different the Classic pop can be compared to pservers.
---
Holy shit at the people riding this guy's dick in this thread.  Woof.
---
He just sucks as a mage, get over it!
---
I just read this as someone indecisive, though more opposed to layering, and the way you brought up all these inconveniences made me realize this is indeed the best solution. We pay a MONTHLY FEE after all, this game is a service and providing poor server performance at launch is the best way to fuck it up.
---
I’m sure that if there was no layering, we would have seen hundreds of threads on this sub complaining about lag/queues/crowd... lol
---
[1. General - Elwynn Forest] INVITE TO ASMON’S LAYER!
---
When Blizzard announced Classic, the FIRST THING they said was that they set out to recreate the experience of Vanilla -- but not the launch experiencea. Maybe they should host the servers on server blades of the early 2000s technology in addition to simulate the connection speed of that time to create more authentic experience. Without that, the authenticity and fidelity of Vanilla is going to be irreparably ruined!
---
When the game launched originally, there weren't as many people playing then as they will now. The main factor that filtered people out was not how difficult the game was but how unstable our connections were. Only the most stubborn kept leveling on the "high population" realms on those first couple of days, and NONE OF those realms were anywhere near as congested as the launch of any recent private realm. 
---
If you thought about this for just a few seconds, you'll understand why they came to this decision. The launch experience of vanilla is going to be different whether they add layering or not. Their servers are VERY stable now; we're on fiber internet too. They could easily have thousands of people competing in the starter zones in a very stable environment. This is NOT what happened though in vanilla; back then the servers just shit themselves but in so doing also filtered people out. This won't happen now, and they're faced with the ability to launch a Vanilla-simulator that can create the conditions for the worst possible experience someone can have. (Which, by the way, is no where near what it was like during Vanilla's launch)
---
Won’t be able to right click friend. But people have forums and discord’s. Collision will happen
---
Jesus dude, put down the bong, save the few brain cells you have left.
---
The funny thing is, US can't grasp how frustrating this can be, knowing that any person you speak to understands and can communicate back with you is a given for them.
---
Common abbreviations are well established and known too. 
---
Boy  does that look different with 5 major languages at play, it looks and feels shit. 
---
Some of us experienced it first hand before Italian and Spanish (and other) realms were implemented. People attacking others was no uncommon sight.
---
I remember when Italy won against Germany in the World Cup 2006, people joined the German realms just to insult the players lol.
---
fun fact, in actual vanilla wow you didn't need a subscription to play on the beta/stress testing.
---
Wow, it's like when you only invite BFA players to your beta, nobody fucking plays your beta....
---
What does this prove at all?
---
English is not my first language, yet I raid in a British guild and am fluent in English. I should totally count as an English speaking player, yet I'm not on that list. That applies to MOST of Europe. If you count players that interact with other in english, compared to german and french, English will be by far at the top.
---
I don't agree with the decision by Blizzard but I have no idea what this list has to do with anything.
---
Isnt your first example just what multiboxing is and no one has ever been banned for that?
---
Press 1 button and do one action on all characters isn't against the ToS is it?
---
so you want friends/guildmates and families not be able to start with each other?
---
True wizened players get this.
---
Not only do we need layering, we could use sharding in the beginning zones
---
hahhaah
---
and not a single of them has been good since wow vanilla.
---
They aren't even that bad, it's usually way worse, we can be so creative
---
Kinda what I was thinking. People in my Pre Classic Guild are kinda freaked about it and upset. But I told them that this could happen on discord just as easily.
---
Server identity is already eroded with paid transfers.
---
That was the start of the issue. Suddenly whole guilds would appear to grab server firsts because they were too shit on other realms but jumped to a fresh one instead etc.
---
It's super important, definitely. But I can't believe people aren't mad about paid transfers as much as layering.
---
Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, and Shinedown all on loop
---
Idk about you. But i coordinate with my friends when we decide to due/expect to play togethrr
---
For fuck sake. Yeah I'll love it when i find out a month into the game that half my server are Frenchmen who refuse to speak English. Jesus Christ blizzard, when will you learn from your mistakes.
---
Those French. It's like they have a word for everything!
---
make sure your on the right settings, my active sub is on wow 3, but it defaulted to wow 1 and kicked me out when i first tried
---
Cross faction collusion isn't even banned by Blizzard anymore. On Retail, it's encouraged. There's even a potion you can buy to speak to each other.
---
No he didn't. An analogy is not a direct comparison. It's a comparison of one aspect of a thing with that aspect of another thing. In this case it's whether something can be done means it should be done. I personally don't think his analogy is a good one but people thinking analogies are one to one comparisons must be stamped out.
---
I mean, hardcore wow players were OG neckbeards before that even was a common term with only maybe EQ players having more cred. So having a lot of people here come off as super nerds shouldn't be surprising. I'm not going to downvote or ask for a speech but I was under the impression the Virgin/Chad meme was tongue in cheek and not something to take seriously. I think you might be going out of your way to find things that meet your preconceived impressions based on your personal beliefs.
---
No he is not, that is the fundamental difference. The german will reroll as you can see in the other replies to my comment. Personally I prefer English speaking communities because I do not like the fact that most germans want to be in german only communities, but I am the absolute minority.
---
100% agree
---
These "solutions" are just just problematic.
---
I've played almost every mainstream MMO back in the day and I don't remember a time one released and this didn't happen, so let it happen.
---
We dealt with it then we can deal with it now.
---
Killing NPCs isn't really 'ganking'.  But no.
---
Maybe, maybe not. Honestly the rules with griefing are kinda loose and it's often on case-by-case, but you would get plenty of messages from GM's to tell you to stop before they would actually ban you that's for sure.
---
Yes and retail is gearing towards no factions I feel like
---
1-12 sure, not mid-late leveling.
---
So like mark and sap with one macro?
---
I think the first 3 zones should be layed and possibly the 20 zones like Duskwood should have 2-3 layers. 30+ zones like STV should have no layering.
---
If it was in vanilla then it's in classic.
---
Enthusiasm for TLJ was high because Abrams did his standard "mystery box" bullshit of throwing a bunch of shit out there, not explaining any of it then walking away to let someone else clean up the mess. And despite this being his MO for over a decade now somehow people are still falling for it.
---
The dude's a hack who shouldn't be directing anything longer or more intricate than a commercial. Yet somehow he's become Hollywood's golden child for genre entertainment. I'd honestly be impressed if he weren't building his legacy on ruining the franchises I've loved all my life.
---
Nah this is great stuff. This is what I was looking for. Unfortunately, 15yo me didn't really care about rep in 2005 so it's hard for me to separate pserver experiences with retail vanilla. I had really hoped that pservers were more correct than they are, but it's not looking good lol.
---
Who hurt you? That's such a sad thing to say as your defense for layering.
---
Someone recently noticed druid private server leveling is much easier than actually classic WoW.
---
I will be interested to see if other classes were overturned.
---
&gt;Just left my house and it turns out not everyone speaks German, do you think the entire world is a small part of Europe?
---
I was answering to a German on a specific point. My argument stands for every other country/language though.
---
&gt;Enjoying playing with an international community and enjoying understanding the people you are playing with are not mutually exclusive.
---
Thats my whole point? Thats why we will speak english in public channels and your native language in guildchat (if you arent in an international guild obv).
---
Layering is just load balancing and load balancers are very common. I don’t believe there is any tech that they necessarily built (don’t quote me on this though but it seems that way as an outsider looking in). They just setup the infrastructure with load balancing across different nodes on the same server, which they claim they will “merge” later on, which really just means they will turn off load balancing when the population decreases.
---
Its in beta already.  Walking should work too, as will any slow that slows enough to hit the walk animation.  In theory stealth should disable it too, but I think they are using modern stealth code.

&gt;after he stole a chest I had cleared out a camp of elites to get to.
---
I assume he was permabanned?
---
I've traveled to Italy, Spain and France many times. In fact I dated a girl in a small North Italian city for a while. English is the most adopted second language in the world. France, Spain and Italy included.
---
Greece, Romania, Poland, all of Scandinavia, Czech Republic, I have not found a place I could not get around with English. Granted, sometimes the first person I engage needs to get help from someone that might know the language a bit better. Never, I have been in a situation where ultimately English wasn't enough to get a question answered or a point across.
---
&gt;he majority won't care that they couldn't start until 3 hours after launch
---
Then that majority can go start 3 hours later to help the servers if they truly don't care. I certainly won't.
---
I'm here to voice my concern for this. Quite unacceptable imo.
---
Well the largest bottleneck is absolutely STV. But you can expect much of the attrition to strike by the time they get there.
---
Sweet justice seeing glass cannon mages get one-shot. You know they build for 1-shot specs all the time ;)
---
Your name is coincidentally on point
---
I'm the idiot that Xfered to the Gurubashi server because it matched my time zone, had a good H:A balance, and an active PvP scene - little did I know that it was the official unofficial Brazil server where I couldn't communicate with 1/2 the population, and 1/2 of that population would kick any non BR immediately.
---
Layering is a solution to overcrowding, which is going to be a very real thing. How long that overcrowding exists will determine how long layering is needed. This isn't a design decision that Blizz is arbitrarily implementing, it's a direct solution to a problem that would severely reduce the quality of gameplay for millions of people. 
---
Yes, it's imperfect and potentially abusable, but until someone can come up with another option, they should stop complaining about how it's going to ruin the game.
---
Doing nothing isn't an option, overcrowding would be unacceptable. Adding more realms isn't an option, because it would spread the population out too thin once players start leaving. And as far as we know, Blizzard doesn't have the ability to do per-zone layering. If they can figure that out, then great, but getting rid of layering completely is not a real option.
---
I'm pretty sure camping quest mobs for extended periods of times is punishable. Could be wrong.
---
In general though Blizzard's stance is if its a PvP problem it has a PvP solution so they tend to be hands off with that stuff.
---
Yea, obviously best dps is to use energy on something else, but a good rogue can do a lot of CC on an accidental double pool or just kidney if they see that the tank is near death.  
---
Bosses are typically immune to stuns and CC, but only a few bits of trash are immune.
---
nah, the increased hitbox is baseline to the race. Orcs being larger than gnomes for instance, have the exact same hitbox as gnome.
---
There was a media share donation going on during that clip hence the video/shenanigans. Stino is actually pretty good, there's just silly stuff going on periodically.
---
What happened to this post? D:
---
100% Agree.  There's so much negativity towards the safeguards Blizzard is trying to implement here for long term success.  There have been many great ideas on how to make layering work posted on this sub, but any mention of layering that isn't to do away with it entirely is immediately downvoted. 
---
Some of the best ideas I've seen here are quite simple and would alleviate most of the exploit problems.  Simply preventing changing layers after the first 30 seconds or a minute after logging in as well as only allowing layer transitions from grouping to occur while in the same zone as your party would fix 99% of the problems people have with layering without really impacting game play at all.  You could also impose a 3 changes per hour limit (as opposed to cooldown between every change) to prevent abuse event further without impacting any normal gameplay at all.  The logistics of abusing layering with just those 3 conditionals would make it astronomically more difficult to coordinate exploits than it is now.
---
This is funny. 
---
I have to admit though. Even the French are catching up.
---
I’m hoping to hit 60 in under 6 days played, so I’ll probably end up questing, but honestly farming dungeons might be a solid strat too.
---

---
Ah, yes. "You don't agree with me, so clearly you're simply too stupid to understand why I'm right."
---
Smell that condescension, boys.
---
Comparing retail to classic is a bit wild there. There's no real factions anymore in retail so of course the rules are less strict. Trust me proper cross faction collusion will be banned.
---
HAHA!!  I'm doing the same thing on my backhoe!!
---
This was the experience with my guild.  We formed pretty late and finally got a consistent 40 man group going by the end of Vanilla.  When BC came out we sucked because like 15 or 20 people were hard carrying the rest without us even realizing it.  It became obvious in Karazhan when the first group did fine and the 2nd couldn't clear Moroes.
---
The 1v1 tournament isn't what I'm basing my claim on, Venruki's trophy case is. You're not too bright for reading comprehension I guess.
---
&gt;  Without an official way of recognizing their own communities, European players will have to sort through the available realms and find one that speaks their own language.
---
Well they won't have to sort very far. It's likely EU will only have a handful of servers. My guess is 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
The oldest Millennial are 37 this year.
---
No. Blizzard is not going to have a separate EULA for Classic.
---
Just make it where you pick your layer and you can not change. Layering as it is now is literally just new servers opening and merging as the population rises and falls. This is where the abuse comes in.
---
And furthermore, when you go to the next node maybe someone from another layer has taken that node.
---
TLDR - the more layers you have the more layer hoppers and gathers you have. In the end it may save some small travel time, but overall be net neutral.
---
Millennials are the streamers. They're also a lot of the viewers.
---
Naw everyone is orc... this is 1.12 where wotf lasts 5 seconds and isn't op.
---
Dustwood I thought had a world boss. So how would that work. It just needs to be set at two weeks and it's gone. No more, a short while and call it good enough.  Much less room for abuse to matter in two weeks then months in just starting zones. Yes I know world bosses are not in phase one but it should just be removed after a short amount of time.
---
&gt; "Waldledergürtel" 
---
Why are you speaking in murloc tongue, boi
---
Gnome warlock.  Because I hate dwarf hunters.
---
I can't speak on exact numbers. Only of what I remember from playing extensively back then.  
---
The lower values feels about what I remember.  
---
I remember above 150 rep gains were rare.
---
You would hit a bit into honored into a few reputations by the time you were 60.  
---
I remember it took me awhile on most my characters hitting revered for that sweet mount price reduction with Orgrimmar after hitting 60 in the earlier days. But when AQ hit it was getting trivial getting exalted as more quest existed.
---
I throughout agree that english should be spoken by literally anyone on the internet, but sadly that is not the case, and I cannot be fucking arsed to deal with people who don't, and therefore I'd be very happy for those players to be on a language-specific server.
---
This list shows that there are other major languages in europe.
---
Yes, there are players who like to play on an international server or even prefer it. But  it is not hard to find lots of players, who want to play in their own language with others that speak the same.
---
I 100% read this as another "Me and the Boys (mind controlling Marshal Dughan to the depths of Fargodeep Mine!)" meme the first time.
---
He's playing up the character of an elitist jerk. It's his stream persona, Asmongold rather than the Zack we see on Allcraft and such.
---
it's not the same flavor, at all.
---
Are you ready to take over Crushridge again? :D
---
&gt;Demonstrate it's a worse spec with real data.
---
You're the one that gives a shit about it. How about you link me all the pages that say that BM has theoretical higher DPS but it tends to fall short because of all the inconveniences and pitfalls of pet use during raiding.
---
Oh and somehow your conjectural evidence is better than mine? Oh no, it wasn't because that hunter whose spec I still haven't specified was playing an unspecified spec that was better than mine for raiding, it was because he was better than me at PvP.
---
&gt;but you are talking to someone who regularly topped the charts among the other hunters in our guild
---
I didn't see where you denied that there was even any actual competition because hunters aren't a top pick for DPS spots. I guess I appreciate that you're not willing to blatantly lie, and instead just skirt around things.
---
&gt;tying and beating one of the best hunters in the server pretty regularly
---
Generally higher DPS &gt; situationally higher. You don't see other classes with generally lower DPS bragging about being able to beat fury warriors or whatever but leaving out the fact that they can only beat them in fights that specifically favor their spec. It's because they understand that it's a special circumstance and the vast majority of the time that's not going to be the case. You're definitely giving off a stink of confirmation bias, j/s.
---
LMAO!
---
No it won’t. That’s what you don’t get. There is nothing new about an OLD game.
---
I honestly just think it's dumb since an entire class is fundamentally a DoT class, and the debuff limit reduces them to Shadow Mages.
---
Since you didnt understand what I wrote, you should just wait until someone dubs it for you
---
"I am set on Alliance because Paladin."  You have a specific reason.  If he can't give a good reason for going horde, make him the bad guy.
---
Please source on this? I'd love for no realm transfers to be a thing (for character responsibility), but I've not heard this is confirmed and would like to see a source.
---
I can probably read French pretty well after having been forced to study it for 6 years at school. I wouldn't even mind being in a group of four friends speaking their native language occasionally. Actually provides a little extra dimension, right? Makes you feel part of an international community. I kind of like that thought.
---
Theres a difference between generally sucking and having a moment of subpar play.
---
If I'm controlling two characters and an enemy comes across me in STV 9 times out if 10 they're going to get two free kills because I can barely play either class effectively when I'm controlling both at the same time.
---
So no, there's absolutely NO advantage. It would put me at a disadvantage.
---
I'm willing to spend $15 a month to control two characters yes. That doesn't mean I play one character and I get a free pet that follows me around auto healing me.
---
I have to control both of them. That's the whole point. That's no different then if my wife went to bed and I had to take over her character on her laptop because were in the middle of a dungeon and effectively play two characters at once.
---
I would agree with you if a program made it so the other character doesn't need to be controlled, but there's nothing wrong with having two accounts and alt tabbing to play two characters at once.
---
The only way I can see someone having a problem with that would be if they are salty because they can't afford an additional $15 a month to do it themselves. 
---
Otherwise why would you care?
---
I feel like the sense of Community, the sense of a big "family" that Classic Servers provided back in the days is completely ruined by the point that there are no Language specific realms. By that you split the one big community into multiple small ones which  creates nothing but a toxic environment.
---
Im German and while im fine with communicating in English, for some of my Friends its not. Its gonna be a major turn off for them and for me honestly aswell. I was fine with Crossrealm Bgs and kinda fine with Layering if they tuned it properly but no language specific Realms kills it completely. If i want something like this i can just play Retail.
---
Interesting. I thought 1 person would wear the set bonus just for the huge thunderclap buff
---
From my experience germans are really split up either they speak english really well or they don't speak a word. I lived in germany for a short while highschool and legit the classroom was so split between student not saying a word or paying any attention, and students actively partipating, it was crazy.
---
If you get Engineering, get Mining.
---
The EU realms will be announced on August 13th, but I wouldn't get your hopes up for having too much choice. If 25% of the EU playerbase can't sustain one server, then 100% of the EU playerbase can't sustain more than a handful. My guess is 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP for all of EU.
---
loser
---
I don't know what I just saw, but its better than anything any other "personality" streamer has ever shown me.
---
Like, either be mechanically amazing at the game or be this wizard shouting OH MY GOD.
---
Nah, c'est bon
---
Clearly the only bigot here is you considering NO ONE agrees with you.
---
&gt;	spam exposing spells
---
That’s not how wPvP works
---
probably British
---
EU wide servers is the worst of all changes that could happen.
---
Yeah only takes a few minutes of world chat on Lightbringer to see that is definitely the case. One reason i can't wait for classic is actual moderation because goddamn is that shit cancer.
---
The fact you couldn't see it is a parody of a mo ds name in this sub doesn't say much for you.
---
Also your spiteful downvote was as amusing as it was  meaningless.
---
Yeah let’s shit on the people who bring thousands to the game and the community. The people who constantly make content for the game, introduce new people to it, put on other smaller streamers and content creators... yeah *they are the ones* ruining the game.
---
It’s *definitely* not the tryhard neckbeards crying a river over “streamer privilege” despite doing NOTHING to add to the community besides whining. 
---
I for one LIKE that Classic is popular on Twitch.
---
&gt;Do you know how big layers will be?
---
No and you dont either because afaik Blizzard hasnt stated anything official on that yet.
---
&gt;Do you really think that's not enough? Like seriously? Do you really think 500 people in Elwynn Forest is not "playing with other people" enough? Do you need to have 5000 people instead?
---
I dont *need* them but I also wouldnt mind. Anyway, I was just making fun of people who wanna play Classic like a single player RPG. The real problems with layering lie in other spots as you surely saw in the many posts about it on the frontpage of this sub. Like it getting abused to dodge PVP and endlessly farming nodes.
---
To clarify, English is my second language too. Send thought by video games.
---
NA servers get grouped in with Brazilian and Spanish speaking servers and we manage ok. Kinda figured EU servers would be more tolerant. 
---
(Blizzard didn't listen to NA call outs for English speaking servers and Portuguese speaking servers to be separated... this will get the same attention... none.)
---
Wait a few hours for your friends?
---
We're playing with the 1.8 weapon speed normalization, so Barman Shanker doesn't give big ambush/backstabs.
---
DPS is DPS. Rogues are fine
---
Dont most raids only take like 1 druid though?
---
Yes, please do so the streamer servers are slightly less populated for ya boy.
---
What is that high pinched squealing? Is that really his voice?
---
Cool cool
---
Blizzard has NEVER ever stated that "sharding would last through the early zones" or that they would "use layering for 2 weeks". That stuff comes from the subreddit who's users have parroted those requests over and over.
---
Blizzard have stated exactly one thing regarding sharding and that is that sharding would be gone by a set time. For all of Blizzard's mistakes it's really unfair to be putting those words into their mouths when they have been very deliberate in communicating how sharding would work.
---
If you think lonely neckbeards are only donating to female streamers, you’re fooling yourself.
---
Yeah it's kind of weird. I've also noticed that people here like to shut down debate more than many other subreddits. If you post anything opinion that isn't the recognised one true opinion it gets downvoted to oblivion. I think you're probably right though, if there is one group that really hates opinions that differ to their narrow sights then that is it.
---
I don't do residential (I'm an electrician), but from what I've seen from new houses popping up, safety is a word that literally doesn't exist in their vocabulary.  Shit goes up way too fast for OSHA to roll in and do anything.  I've never seen a roofer with any safety gear any time I roll past a new house, because they have shit done in a day.  Worst case for them, an OSHA guy happens to be driving by and decides to stop.  Scheduled site visit next week?  Pshhh, they'll be done and gone by then, and anyone who is there will scatter when they see the hardhat.
---
Just watched the linked video and there is no clarification. 
---
IMO if you don't want to be ganked don't broadcast your location. If you're broadcasting your location then don't bitch about being ganked.
---
People need to just quit their 'feedback' you mean?
---
Layering is already in effect for that image. That image is demonstrating layering. Without layering, that line might be much longer.
---
Now I don't recall the particulars of that quest, but can't they group up for the kill/shared drop? Is this more an effect of people not knowing about grouping for kill/shared drop quests?
---
Just perma anyone speaking a trash-language on public chats, like I wrote on the edit.
---
You know what, you're right. Anyone that is just not willing to adapt is probably not going to be my friend either.
---
Yea this is insane they are including such a system to Classic WoW. Put in sharding instead and limit it to 1-20 zones and it solves every single problem. No early game congestion and no high level exploits or wpvp teleporting.
---
Bobby B, you're here!

Wait a minute you kill jaina in retail? I thought she is a good Girl. Wha happend?
---
And it would ruin the experience of all the people who played classic on German or french realms and want to emulate that experience.
---
All I can think is... why aren't they grouped up? This should be a kill/shared drop quest. Did the Tutorial not pop-up like it normally does? Are they just ignoring that feature?
---
There are so many questions.
---
This is the SpellQueueWindow, not spell batching.  This was a 2.3 patch addition.
---
How you're ready to roll against Tank and DPS Warriors for those
---
A lot of them  played on French servers, they are the coolest people on earth dude. Due to history they have some reasons to be hostile to English (though they are not, they just want to speak their language but it is too much apparently)
---
It will be a racist shitshow, just like on private servers.
---
And Blizzard will not do anything about it because they cut down on GMs at the same time and have no time to curate classic servers as much as retail.
---
Stino (HighWarlordStino) does ridiculous stuff all the time (i.e. drinks vinegar, plays WoW slots, uses camera filters, etc). Actually pretty good though if you don't mind all the craziness. I can definitely understand why someone would ask wtf is happening.
---
1-5 mobs in real Vanilla were meant as a tutorial.
---
They are weaker by design. This has been confirmed. 
---
Private servers just had them way overtuned, which there is not a problem since people that play on private servers have played the game before they don't really need a tutorial for MMOs.
---
Will end up just like EUW on League

Where is the best place to complain about this?

---
Just my opinion.
---
It isn't done randomly at all. They hand selected streamers, and even former devs. Then they put a bias in for older accounts. 
---
I'm not complaining I didn't get a beta invite. I didn't sub. I couldn't have gotten one. I just don't like the idea of needing a sub to get in the pool. The reason I don't like it, is that you don't need an active sub to test the most recent patches of retail. Which makes no sense to me. 
---
The people with subs would be the one interested in retail, whole the people who selected classic beta in their account options are the ones interested in classic. There is probably some overlap between those two, but I don't see why you would only draw from the first group.
---
I forgot this existed:

I actaully can't agree with this. One of the reasons I stopped playing BfA was that I could not financially sustain my raiding. Professions were worthless moneysinks, so no money to be made here, I had no stockpiles from WoD or Legion, but the prices of flasks and potions were surreal for me. I never had any alts, so farming the mats for myself was not an option (and that should not be expected IMHO, RPG should not be designed around alts, that's just an option) and standard world quest routines simply did not suffice. I've been playing since BC through MoP and while I was always short on gold due to being a big spender and too lazy to engage in the AH or farm excessively, doing daily quests and crafting (ecnhanting, bags) still allowed me to buy potion materials by hundreds. As someone who doesn't want to spend hours grinding materials on alts, I felt ostracized from the raiding scene, just for financial reasons alone.
---
Great video man. Really helps get the gist of how each pet is unique!

It always was a shit show. We knew that. I was able to predict the problem and solution over a month ago. Now someone suggests the same solution, and they get 2.3k upvotes... It's just infuriating that people on this sub can't see these things.

I like how instead of realizing they fucked up it would be an I told you so moment for them. You want vanilla? Here have some not vanilla. Oh, I told you you didnt actually want vanilla!

IDK. The guilds I was in during vanilla brought multiple druids. Around 3-4.

Probably Druid.
---
Paladins lore wise are generally dicks to most people aside from the odd Tirion.
---
Here we see Activisions brilliant "Cut-cost" Policy in action, once again ruining what could've been a great experience for many players..
---
I think it would be cool for the streamers to coordinate and roll alliance and hord on the same server. I think this would increase the ridiculousness of the things they do. As if one streamer wasn't enough. It would also give other streamers a larger built in audience when people's favorite is not doing anything. Or get some true streamer vs streamer wars going.
---
I think it would be epic and would even consider creating a character on such a server to participate in some events. 
---
The biggest challenge will be server balance. I was on such a meme server before in vanilla, but it ended up over populated and way out of balance. PvE was great, but world PvP was pathetic. The other faction just started to abandoning the server.
---

Just remove altogether. It's chaos day 1 but it's natural chaos and sorts itself out very quickly. 1 or 2 days.

The trick is to run away from where mobs were pulled originally and then vanish. The mobs will run back to their starting location before being able to be aggroed again, and might just aggro on to the person attacking the rogue.

Cool, dude. You're not interested in discussion, feel free to tell at a wall.

If it happens on a macro scale, the game could also change to adapt to the players who refuse to play. Hurt the companies income and they will respond.
---
I see you’ve created the same post again. 
---
Classic stop posting inception.

Except for their existence in Warcraft 3,.

My bad, I misremembered. They actually said that it will probably come.
---
&gt;xDlate: Are you going to implement in-game shop or things like that?
---
&gt;Ion Hazzikostas: Definitely not at launch. We may down the line if it's something that players want. When we say the shop I mean specifically only the services that were available in the original Classic period. Things like server transfers and race changes were available later in Classic. I could see a world in--let's say a year into Classic--as realms have become mature where a player wants to transfer to a different server to join a guild there to play with their friends, and they want us to provide a way that can make it happen. That's the sort of things we would do but no pets and mounts for sale or anything like that.

We should force them and the Québécois onto one server.

No  that used to happen all the time in xroads and other areas

The streamers are above and beyond the number they set for invites, they don't count at all.
---
I have an active sub,  and am interested in classic,  but also play retail,  the are more of us than y'all think.  We are half the reason this happened
---
Regardless of how good of a player he normally is, and regardless of how many trophies he's won, in that moment he sucked. He wanded the totem instead of R1 frostbolt from much further away, then wanded the 2H Windfury shaman while letting the shaman close the gap on his non-Ice Barrier non Frost Armored ass. 
---
That's downright shitty play, regardless of how good he "normally" is. He should've popped the grounding totem from far away, he should've CoC'd and/or nova'd the Shaman way before. He was overconfident and died because of it.
---
I figured that, but the majority of europeans have not worked or lived in other countries.

Sure, some will use English at work their work or during holidays but not everyone in europe is in your situation. In a big corporation or university you will find a more international athmosphere then in a backwater town/area. And there are a lot of backwater areas.
---
New Player 1: layer 1

New Player 2: layer 2

Both: “hey, we’re at the same spot in front of X...why can’t I see you?”
---
If you don’t know that you need to party up to be on the same layer, them you’d be wondering what’s going on - same race, same server; yet not the same players
---
But you know, saying you’re going to play at the same time is the issue here
---
Hey OP (and anyone else), what does your professions spreadsheet look like? I’ve been building mine but would love to collaborate with people. I’m making a leveling spreadsheet on what stuff I need to save so it’s easier during launch. 
---
If you wanna share, I can share mine (Priest, Rogue, and Warlock), and planning to do Tailoring, Herb, Alchemy (still up for debate tbh)
---
P.S. OP, I’m 33, so I feel you, it’s fine. We love this game lol
---
cant peak for every server ofc but on german servers the english acronyms are used 95% of the time, for everything, even back in vanilla. Only exception i can think of right now is WC, they used HDW (höhlen des wehklagens) for that. Everything else was always english acronyms.
---
And its not even only the acronyms. They use the english names for CC's, never seen anyone say schaf or betäubung for sheep and stun. Dispell, cleanse, purge, interrupt, kite etc.. are words used on german realms, rarely their german counterpart if at all. I can guarantee you that you will never see on a german realm someone say DF for thunder bluff or PSH instead of BWL, or GK instead of MC, simply doesn't happen. I would even go as far and say that if you go to a german realm and say something like LFG PSH or LFG GK that not a single person will know what the fuck you're talking about.
---
Again, can only talk about german servers. I have no clue if the French or whatever use their own abbreviations.
---
I don't remember when it came into play but it'll be less interesting to watch in Classic without it :(
---
I wish they would let me have my Murky :(
---
Be real people everyone in Germany speaks English.
---
IT's the same situation in Dota.  You either speak English or Russian on EU servers.  With the KKomrades out everyone will speak English well enough to get the gist.
---
Who’s A and where can I find them?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Thanks for the nostalgia trip. I haven't heard that name in years.
---
That’s KURWA
---
They did say those things except they just called it sharding at the time, after backlash they started calling it layering, I understand messages can get twisted but this isn't the case it's just what blizzard said.
---
Anyone can google this.
---
I think you are right from a PVE standpoint but for PVP I think its the other way around. Priest would better compliment warrior with dispel since shaman can't remove poly, frost nova etc.
---
No. It is not difficult. You can easily find 40 people within your overpopulated guild who want epic gear. 
---
Finding the same 40 raiders to go week to week with? Yes. People have obligations and you can’t assume all 40 people will have free time on your raid days for the next 1-2 years. 
---
Guilds that don’t have enough members need better leaders or a recruiter addon to invite the entire server.
---
Dude, getting around in English and playing a mmorpg in a foreign language are two completely different things. Asking for help and basic everyday life things is not the same as asking the mage do give you some water.  You live in a bubble and this bubble will violently burst on launch day.
---
Lol don't read my post and then claim I'm wrong. How about instead of just trying to instantly flame me, you read where I actually support complaining to blizzard about features you don't want while also not paying them to play those features you don't want?
---
Kthxbye

Why is that twitch video "incredibly damaging to the game"
---
Well depending on your age and your kids age you might not be a millennial and if you are your kids generation might not have been named yet.
---
MC will be faceroll for any guild with competent players. Especially with world buffs.
---
This is what I was hoping. For my devious mind it would be hella hilarious getting a headstart as a Rogue and then being the Teldrassil boss roaming the area until’ some level 20 came back to stop me. 
---
Then again with layering at the start it wouldn’t be as epic.
---
It was part of having a community of players. “Ahh, here to kill Sarkoth and loot his mangled claw as well? Well sorry to break it to ya but the line starts here. By the way, would you like to group up?”
---
No wonder the Karova Bar weed edibles have a picture of a cow wearing a top hat on the packaging!
---
oh come on even a retarded chimpanzee could get decent at mage pvp with how much time venruki has invested. Im sure hes good and has his hiccups. who cares?
---
I think we are more focused on PVP side of things since we are very competitive. No doubt he will be rolling UD for WOTF.
---
not really.  I'd rather be melting faces in BGs

I'm Dutch, practically your neighbor. I can actually just understand your message without a translator.

I don't understand why you mind speaking English that much? Doesn't it give you sense of being part of an international community? Isn't it cool to team up with players in other countries and share an experience? Don't you feel you might be able to learn from it and expand your horizons?

MY NAME IS FRAUDS OUT AND THIS IS MY 10 MINUTE GUIDE ON HOW TO KEYBOARD TURN
---
People need to make their voices heard on the forums about this. It's enough to make me consider going to US servers.
---
I was surprised to find the quest last night, and my wife was none too happy.  I went afk with my Panda out, came back to a circle of confused people around my sleeping Panda, and a few whispers wondering how.
---
Im alright of they black list me. Itll give me more reason to stream snipe. Dont get me wrong I only plan to snipe when i want to start a pvp battle. But if their fans harass me or blacklist me then I suppose Ill just snipe more often.
---
Ill be working US Second shift. Done at 4 AM London time, Starting work at like  8 pm When are you all trying to get raids done by?!
---
Here should be everyones final thoughts on the issue. No one cares.

No you are
---
Es geht nicht darum dass deutsche kein server bekommen haben. Die briten bekommen auch keins. Die server die es geben wird werden nich englische server sein sondern ganz einfach internationale. Ich persönlich bin ein fan davon und hoffe dass es so bliebt aber jedem das seine.
---
Stop posting Stop posting "stop posting"
---
True, Germans embrace the English names faster than others.
---
Back in the day the Capitals were in English even for the German client. They changed that but can't remember when exactly.
---
The guys entire life revolves around sitting in his room playing WoW for 12 hours a day. You would be a shitty, angry, depressed person too.
---
Wow I made a post asking about this in specific and people told me that it would be like in Retail. This is actually awful news. I dont want to accidentally end up on a server I didnt know many guilds from one nation specifically decided to roll on and I'll later learn that I cant read most of the chat. That would fucking ruin the entire experience.

Who would you say is the best mage in WoW's history, then?
---
Do people think it's funny to type [Donnerzorn, Gesegnete Klinge des Windsuchers]?
---
Yeah, but when English becomes a technical _minority_, suddenly some form of other language will take the lead.
---
if it fails we just wont get tbc... im sure they will keep developing it till naxx anyways
---
I mean its kinda like europe irl right? a massive melting pot of sexy sounding languages? i agree tho this is wack for an online game
---
The only good thing is...we don't have to deal with russians.
---
Det hadde vært jævlig kult med en Norsk server.
---
Even if you exclude streamers from what you call the "random selection" you still have to account for the bias for older accounts. It's clearly not random. It was intentional made that way. They even stated that.
---
Active subscribers are definitely not half the reason we are getting classic. I would doubt they are even in the single digit % of private server players. The private servers were the main reason, if not the only reason, we are getting classic. Specifically N O st.
---
The whole point of layering is to make the game playable at release. If there is no layering, either mob competition will be insanely high or they will have to open a ton of servers. Either way causes more people to stop playing in the long-term; which reduces the chance you will ever run into that player again down the road. Can’t run into that player if he quit because server lag and mob competition where too high.
---
Bro your talking to a beardling. Better to simply ignore him. Other wise you'll get caught up in his angry little beardling nonsense.

Paladin

Can't wait to see what they have in store for oceania
---
&gt; Plus, linking gear if someone plays with a non-english client simply will render communicating about gear borderline impossible (not even sure if you can see a link of an item not in your language).
---
Whenever someone links a piece of gear in chat (group or otherwise) with someone who runs a non-English client, the text is in their client's language. When I click on that link, the item pops up with my client's language item name and description.
---
Meanwhile in NA, there’s only English servers even though there’s 10 million French speakers and over 125 millions Spanish speakers.
---
INB4 the UK are moved to American servers, as different laws and languages apply to the EU servers.
---
I don’t see it as a huge problem sincerely.
---
I am italian and back in the day we “colonized” crushridge. Nobody in the server ever said a single word in english,  newcomers won’t have any problem to understand that the server is not played by english speaker players, in less than 15 mins anybody will realize that. Just avoid the server in question.
---
Hell the fuck no. How is this ever gonna be fair for people who are not in the first wave? If i wasn't in the first wave i would go on a rant here and on the forums, contact support to tell them to fuck off and vote with my wallet and not play the game.
---
I'd say Paladin, they have a buff that's good for every class and can tank heal and dps dungeons depending on what the group needs
---
That’s how you set stuff up. Just cause Rian Johnson is a moronic dick doesn’t mean abrams didn’t set stuff up.
---
She is. Half the raid [attack on BfA horde capital] is from Alliance PoV, half from Horde. You fight Jaina as Horde.
---

Neither devouring or starshards should be in raid rotation

Oh man, having other players around to group up with really sucks. I mean what is an MMORPG all about anyways?

A lot of their work seems like they are planning for a failure before it even begins. Someone in upper management is very pessimistic about this game.

I need more of this.

Did she die?
---
I'm well aware but it still has the highest high-end damage of any prebis dagger beside felstriker.
---
"ah ah ah" sounds like Count Countula.
---
"One Spanish server! Ah, ah, ah."
---
I don't see what the big deal is. Plenty of games that rely more heavily on communication (League, Fortnite etc.) do not have language specific servers.
---
Even though I expect classic to be quite successful, the reality is that there is not enough demand to provide every language its own set of realms. The whole point of layering is to help Blizzard consolidate realms so that they continue to feel like massive communities even in the long term.
---
This is great! Lots of good advice here.
---
If you don't mind followup questions:
---
&gt; Battle Shout to generate AoE threat.
---
I've been struggling with some larger pulls in Gnomeregan. People told me to *spam* Battle and Demoralizing shout. Others said it only works on PServers. Do you have any insight on this? Best strategy for AoE pulls? Say, 8 mobs or so?
---
Social party management is also something I've been trying to figure out. I don't know the dungeons well at all (still relatively new to Vanilla), so being a proper leader is a bit difficult. I had others take over in where to go and they start pulling, as well, which is at times annoying. Or sometimes half the group decides to do X, and the other half to do Y, and they go in opposite directions, while I stay in the middle, haha.
---
Pretty sure it's still in the EULA it's just not enforced on retail.
---
If you minmax in classic you're LITERALLY hitler
---
Yeah, i remember that. I also remember that the vast vast majority of players at the time didn't like that they changed the names to german. Wasn't just cities, it was zones too, not sure if all of them but i remember that STV had the english name before the change 100%.
---
In raids they will be highly sought after in dungeons. The supply of tanks is normally so low that nothing matters other then the tank. Once you have a tank you have a group.
---
Watch the second video where he exploits layering.
---
You are right - they do think with their wallets. Which means that if we all sub for Classic WoW and, should they ever go to BC, not transfer over: they will give us 1.13.
---
As long as they speak english.
---
You’re making this way more serious than it needs to be. Sub for classic if that’s what you wanna do, or don’t because you despise this “new” blizzard. My friends and I will play either way.
---
I wonder if there will be a wider beta in the next month or something so more people can join. I decided to play Classic but I was never much into WoW (quit two months into Cataclysm) so I have no intention of buying BfA to barely even play it, and wasting two weeks of a subscription just to be able to reserve the name of a character is stupidity. However if everyone with game time did have access to the full beta in the final stages I would totally subscribe so I could both play the beta and reserve a name for my characters.
---
No. Most priest will be shadow, most shamans will be enhance, most pallys..well may try ret but may go holy
---
But then that player will be the only one above level 30 on that layer which causes a lot of issues for things like PvP realms. It fixes some things but breaks others.
---
can russian accounts play on other than russian servers?

#NoChanges
---
He knows too much folks.
---
I'm actually going to stick my nose in here.
---
I was in kind of an average guild. I can tell you that the real challenge was just providing like 20-25 competent people and just filling the rest of the spots as needed.
---
We cleared MC and BWL fairly easily with some good leadership.
---
I doubt we will see a lot of DKP this time around but I personally feel a lot of guilds will benefit from it as nothing encourages participation quite like it.
---
I could be wrong here, and just an old man yelling at a cloud, but there is a massive difference between text shorthand, leet speak, and twitch emotes.
---
Two are relatively easy to decipher, with little to no context, the other is literally meaningless drivel without specific, arbitrary context.
---
Didn't blizzard confirm having a sub doesn't affect getting into the beta?
---
So can I now make a ''stop posting 'stop posting "stop posting"'' thread? 
---
If we keep doing this, I am seriously going to have to learn how nested quotation marks work. Do you really want to make me do that kind of work?
---
&gt; What does it matter, that they don't have those tools at lvl 10? Yeah, it's a design problem, but one, which falls off later.
---
It shows that they missed a fundamental requirement for that spec. Prot Paladin isn't the only one with that issue. Feral Druids get claw as their combo point generator and rip at level 20. They do not get another combo point spender until level 32. So you go 12 levels with nothing to spend combo points on...
---
And no, it doesn't "fall off later". If you're a new player or do not know much about Classic but played other expansions, that will ***not*** be immediately apparent to you. On top of the fact that not having a taunt completely changes how you and your group have to approach doing content that no other tank has to deal with. 
---
&gt; Deadmnies isn't hard to tank, just wear a shield and go. You do have righteous fury at that point, so you can generate decent enough threat and if you lose aggro it isn't that big of a deal.
---
It is a big deal because I am a worse tank for no other reason than Blizzard just "forgot" to give me the tools. It makes those runs harder to do with a group that is not patient or experienced enough. I was lucky in that I had a priest and a druid (druid was main healing) to make that work. I regularly lost aggro on pulls and we went oom more than we should have. 
---
&gt; Because being a great tank at lvl 20 is so very important? The only real effect here is, is that an arms warrior or any druid can tank levelling dungeons, while ret paladins will have a harder time to do so starting at the 30s, where a real tank becomes more necessary.
---
The point I am making that you're missing here is that those other tanking classes get all of their tools right out of the gate. There's almost no reason for the Prot Paladin to not have the same treatment. So either Blizzard forgot to give them the tools needed, or they designed the class poorly. 
---
&gt; If you are a new player with WoW experience and didn't read up on the class you want to play, that's your fault.
---
So victim blaming? That's a poor argument. 
---
&gt; If you are a completely new player, a friendly person, who knows about paladins will likely be in one of your first dungeons to give you some pointers.
---
And if they don't exist? That new player spends hours and hours on this character only to realize that what he wants to do isn't really possible? 
---
&gt; Becuase paladins have a harder time tanking at low levels?
---
Don't get hung up on that. I was just giving you an example to show the disparity between the tank ready classes. 
---
&gt; Yes, the lack of taunt means, they are compeltely unable to tank bosses, where tank switches are required and also makes it quite risky to maintank any boss. 
---
Risky to the point that you might as well not even bother having a prot paladin maintank. 
---
&gt; But prot paladins have their niche in aoe tanking many mobs and that's because consecration is miles better than the druids and warriors aoe abilities. a geared prot paladins consecration will tick for ~60 and generate 90% extra threat, so 114 TPS against every single mob just from this one spell. Thunderclap only hits 4 targets and demoralize barely generates any threat.
---
This is such an incredibly niche role that it might as well not even be mentioned. Most fights in the game can be CC'd accordingly, or the mobs that "die quick" can be kited with things like Blizzard, Frost Trap, etc. 
---
&gt; Because a different class needs different gear? Boomkins can use leather items with spelldmg, which will get disenchanted otherwise.
---
Don't forget that most hybrid classes picked up whatever was good for them. In some cases you would have druids wear cloth armor because the stats were better than anything they could get otherwise. 
---
This was actually a huge problem for the developer because players did this often. so one of the fixes was to make it so that you got bonuses to your main stat if you wore the appropriate armor for your class. 
---
The situation you mentioned is likely not going to happen often, if at all because those hybrid classes are still going to want to roll on that leather or cloth item because it will be a dps increase over anything else they can get in the game. Remember, the loot table wasn't really designed with hybrids in mind. 
---
&gt; Walking up to the boss and judging the boss every ~35 sec, especially when you are busy healing the raid is quite the hassle.
---
It totally isn't. 
---
&gt; Did I ever contest that? Yes, it's a dps loss. So? does it matter? 99% of the time it doesn't. 
---
You miss the point. You go feral in to raid in a guild. You level up to 60, but it turns out you do not have a spot in your raiding guild because you being in the raid is a dps loss to the group as a whole. They have to bring the class, not the player. That is a failure of game design at that point. 
---
You have a choice between a rogue who you know will put out X amount of DPS and a feral druid, who you know will put out Y dps. Because of raid comp and class design, the feral druid is going to do less than the rogue. 
---
So you're telling me that you're going to pick the feral druid in this situation? Bullshit. 
---
&gt; Yeah, you can make arguments, that another battlerezz or another blessing isn't really necessary (you missed salvation for your most important blessings by the way)but it sure doesn't hurt to have that. 
---
I was just giving general examples. And if you never end up using it, or if you hit enrage, having that person in your raid will hurt your progress. 
---
&gt; You don't have to brutally optimize in vanilla and even though the class balance is much worse in vanilla, it's not like you shoot yourself in the foot by taking along a couple hybrid dps classes.
---
The point I am getting at is when you have a choice between taking a hybrid class in a specific role (such as damage), vs a pure dps class, you are almost never going to pick them over a pure dps because they don't bring enough to the table on their own. Pure and simple. 
---
You can give them a spot if you want to weaken your raid as a whole, but there's almost no reason to do so if you have the option to take that pure dps class (who bring utility of their own too).
---
People love to give J. Allen Brack shit for saying that, and some of it is deserved. But the reality is he’s not wrong either. Watch how after WoW Classic is released on the market for a bit, the influx of QoL changes, requests and complaints that come streaming into official forums and Reddit. I mean it’s already happened and happening. His statement does and will reflect a large group of players. I think Classic, after the dust settles, will be home to a more niche audience of MMO’ers. And in the end that’s who really wants to be there. 
---
I guess what I’m really trying to say is in the end the only thing that matters is...
---
THE BURNING CRUSADE!

I’ll post “stop posting” threads if I wanna!!
---
I can appreciate and agree with that. I didn't mean i wanted lag, I just meant given the choice of layering or lag, I would take the problems for a better experience. Watching things phase in and out of the world really ruined retail for me.
---
I hope you're right though, that they do layering properly and it does provide a better experience that we don't even notice it's there.
---
im portuguese and i have never seen that variation of laughter used in portugal or brazil. only one i know of that is unusual is kkkkkkkkkkk

If having double the ressources somehow gives you a disadvantage then you are just shit. You not being able to use your cheats to an advantage doesn't mean it isn't cheats.
---
&gt;That's no different then if my wife went to bed and I had to take over her character on her laptop because were in the middle of a dungeon and effectively play two characters at once.
---
That's also cheating
---
&gt;but there's nothing wrong with having two accounts and alt tabbing to play two characters at once.
---
Yes there is.
---
&gt;they are salty because they can't afford an additional $15 a month to do it themselves.
---
This is exactly the kind of shit that people who pay2win say.
---
It all gets a lot easier when you realise that no company has ever been "for" you, they are there for the money and that's all that matters, blizzard never has been or will be a friend, as they are a corporation, sure they have passionate developers but as a corporate entity no company is interested in what is nice, they are interested in what gets them the bottom line, it just so happens that being liked by your consumer is a good idea for revenue.
---
Capping it at player level 30 for example is though.
---
Or, you know, being completely unable to play the game for a couple of weeks by not being able to log in or do quests because there's so many people. 
---
Which, IMO, would kill the game faster and more effectively than this "problem".
---
Which is wholly a temporary problem since it gets "phased" out as time goes on.
---
Didn’t they say layering was going to exist for only like a week or two until things stabilize? What are you getting your panties in a bunch?
---
You cant stop me :p
---
&gt; IDK where people fall on this, but personally I'm 100% down for the first 24-72 hours to be a total clusterfuck. I don't get why people are so worried.
---
It also encourages people to group up more to share kills and build friendships within the game.
---
Streamers bad 😡
---
Ah I thought the stream man bad circlejerk had passed and we could focus on important issues like sharding. I expected too much from you.
---
hahahaha how does that make a lick of sense?
---
&gt;I don't get why there wouldn't be Spanish speaking servers
---
I think it's because whatever language is the next biggest, that group will be pissed off as well. If (hypothetically) English has the most WoW fans, Spanish the second most, German the third most, French the fourth most...then with no Spanish servers, most of the pissed off people are Spanish speakers, but the Germans don't care much. If they make a Spanish server, then the Germans will be pissed off. Then if they make a German server, the French will be pissed off.
---
Holy priest and or Holy paladin.
---
Well, this is wildly annoying. Now I have to check on some ropey discord to see which server unofficially supports which language?
---
Okay real talk, whats with the tipsout hate?  I don't follow him at all and I see everyone hating on him now, what happened?
---
I think the bigger issue is twitch emotes are *so* niche. Each streamer has their own, each community has their own uses for those.
---
It's not nearly as universal as lol and other slang. Only a select few has risen to the top in that mannor yet I still see each little community mainly use their own little emotes.
---
If you had a modicum of sense, you'd realize there are semi-accurate ways of determining active subs through the use of the armory API. If you think there's only 1.5 million subs worldwide, you're a retard.
---
Frankly I don't mind giving money for a product that I enjoy like Classic. Even if I disagree with some of the company's business decisions. My enjoyment for the product comes first.
---
Just speek Ameriken
---
Nah, what people want is to have their server to always be at the perfect population level of high playerbase but no queues. Server merges happen to *other* servers, it would never happen to *their* one!
---
What you're suggesting is basically just making more servers and then merging them later. That's exactly what Blizz is trying to avoid.
---
Are people making assumptions based on a load test that there won’t be language specific realms?
---
Showcasing it is indeed a good thing. Raise awareness. But, who besides the popular streamers have thousands of people willing to invite you at the drop of a hat to instantly change your layer? Is Asmon gold screams, "QUICK SOMEONE INVITE ME I'M BEING GANKED", he will catch an invite immediately. If I scream the same thing, I get yelled at by my landlord. Sure, you can be in discord with your 4 friends, and scream for an invite to them, but you are probably already on the same layer as them anyways. This abusing is so difficult to actually accomplish for 98% of the player base.
---
You do know he was right when he said "you think you do,  but you don't" just look at this sub complaining about the way the game is (and no, not layering) and wanting changes and additions
---
&gt; The gamer population in South America is getting bigger every year.
---
The gamer population in South America able to communicate in english is probably growing even faster.
---
Just the streamers
---
err. No. Reddit, also for Germans, is the main source for news. And yes, most people, either German, from UK, France or Spain, are upset about this decision.
---
&gt; Barrens is worse than the starting zones
---
That's why you go ahead of the swarm.
---
Get a fucking audio book
---
&gt;blizzard plans to remove layering and having a normal classic server population like it was back then.
---
Source on that?
---
You act like it’s going to be all that world/trade will be talking about. Most people will not give a baker’s fuck.
---
Ehh adults are often better with time management. Raids are usually a scheduled thing and its the same time and day every week and as long as the adult doesnt have too many responsibilities they can be there for the 2-3 hour raid. It's the leveling farming and gearing adults with jobs and kids tend to struggle with.
---
For a Beta point of reference, I’ve spoken to a player who has reached the level 40 cap, and they’ve completed nearly every single Darnassus quest possible. They’re currently stuck at 3,941/21,000 revered until the level cap goes up again and they can continue working on Feralas quests.
---
I’m currently level 31 in the Beta at 10,161/12,000 Honored with Darnassus using my own quest completionist strategy (working on level 26/27 quests now). I’ve been painstakingly recording all rep values for every single quest (with the 10% human bonus built in) as I’ve been updating my guide: https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
If Blizz does not give language-specific realms, then language communities will pick them. The consequence being a bunch of people  accidentally rolling on the German realm expecting English and getting really pissed off. Seriously Blizz, language specific realms, do it.
---
Hah yes, you're right zones were affected too with Schlingendorntal being one of the worst offenders.
---
Classic wont taste much like much like Vanilla anyway.
---
They are working on the layering system. That is what this recent stress test was all about.
---
&gt; No and you dont either because afaik Blizzard hasnt stated anything official on that yet.
---
What do you mean? They've stated multiple times that they will be as big as Vanilla servers used to be. Why are you arguing about something you have no idea about?
---
&gt; Because they wanted to be able to design the content without having to worry about making it too easy with WB a
---
How the fuck do you think this argument doesn't work in Vanilla?  lol
---
You don't kill her, you *defeat* her.

Long story short, Alliance and Horde are at it again, and as the leader of Kul Tiras, she was the antagonist to the Horde. Meanwhile King Rastakhan, as the leader of Zandalar, was the antagonist to the Alliance.
---
I didn't even realize they added a separate fucking checkbox for WoW Classic vs WoW in the beta preferences.  Now I'm kicking myself because I probably missed out on getting in because I don't obsessively check my bnet profile beta settings.  I just assumed WoW is WoW is WoW as far as beta preferences were concerned.  But no, its separate.
---
Oh thank the lord. I think I found the blue post. I'm actually happy that the EU won't be split up. I enjoy talking to people from other countries and most Germans and Frenchies are decent enough at English.
---
agree with everything you said. confirming your last point by saying when i was playing on pservers, item links in other languages simply wouldnt render and would just be [] colored brackets
---
I suppose any duo isn’t bad right? Would a priest and mage work well together for leveling even though we would both be casters? I want to go priest and my girlfriend was considering warrior but I’ve heard it’s pretty complicated at end game so we are thinking mage.
---
Then click on the item and get it all translated in your client's language.
---
Agreed, i was just making a point that everyone pays for entertainment so don't shame people that donate to streamers
---
Also, someone like me who uses Amazon prime weekly, its almost a waste not to contribute that monthly twitch prime to someone, it doesn't hurt me and gets them a couple bucks!
---
BGs arent grinds!!! They are crazy fun.
---
This is a mistake.
---
The only outcome in this scenario is the creation of “unofficial national servers” for German, French, Spanish, etc. These communities are notorious about their refusal (or inability) to communicate in English. Any unknowing new player that accidentally joins one of these realms, who doesn’t speak their specialized language, is going to be isolated and ostracized. This is an observable phenomenon in retail as well as private servers.
---
This could seriously hurt the community aspect of Classic for the EU playerbase, which is such a massive part of what made Classic so good.
---
You guys care way too much about this.
---
Not really, seing as how finland is one of the top english-speaking nations.
---
So, this combined with Blizzard probably being more willing to ban people for being hateful means the European servers just gonna all be empty right?
---
Hey bud, you missed the vanilla wow solution: dynamic respawns in starter zones. It’s the simplest and it’s vanilla I fail to see why layering was attempted at all, but hopefully now 2 months out we can see it wasn’t worth the dev time.
---
Twice I charged a mob and mid-charge was moved to a different layer where the mob was dead. Awesome. No group invites were involved either time
---
If you're on the East Coast and work 4PM to midnight, my suggestion is to find (in order of preference):
---
1. A guild full of members working the same shift as you.
---
2. A late-night Pacific US guild - (10PM raid start would be 1AM for you)
---
3. A New Zealand guild - (7PM raid start would be 3AM for you)
---
4. A Western Australia guild - (7PM raid start would be 5AM for you)
---
Merging realms back in the day was a hassle for Blizzard. 
---
Some players like low pop realms. They like the smaller community or the "peace and quiet" that it offers. 
---
Those communities often become super close because it's such a tiny community in comparison. 
---
Blizzard coming in to "fix it" might completely destroy those communities since they are no longer that tight nit group. 
---
Then of course the technical part of it. It's not always a smooth transition. Data is lost and characters sometimes lose things. 
---
Blizzard also didn't just do it suddenly. They announce a date, give players the option to transfer to a server (several usually), and then proceed with said merger. 
---
It is an option to be avoided if at all possible.
---
Tell em to stance dance and stop being lazy ass tanks.  Cute &gt; Racial every day. That said, Dwarves are the master race.
---
(Because Classic isn't out yet)
---
So first off, servers will never be as full when phase 2 hits as they will be on launch. Plenty of people are hyped for classic but honestly, the majority of them will get bored when they realise just what "classic" means. But even if that wasn't the case, player drop off happens *for every release*, and not just WoW's.
---
But even if the server is so full all the layers are still at maximum capacity, Blizzard will do the exact same thing they did 15 years ago: Create new servers and offer free realm transfers off congested ones. It's a non-issue.
---
So you play a Dwarf?
---
He's not wrong....
---
I played on a "European server" on ffxiv that was French dominated... absolute cancer none of them wanted to speak english.
---
I hear ya. Wow is a game I play in my leasuretime, not for work or for school. I also don't play checkers with my grandpa by talking english with him but my native language. No fucking clue why Blizzard does this, but I guess since they fired their EU staff, they're cutting corners.
---
Most of the people worried about layering already know about this interview. A 'view weeks' has the potential to be way too long, and people aren't just making up numbers when they say it should be 1-2 weeks max. Give it another 2 weeks (still a 'couple') and congrats, now a handful of people on the server have stocks of a thousand black lotus and will control the economy by abusing a system which would be a removed later. The difference in a few weeks can be much larger than some people give it credit for, and so it's right for people to be nervous.
---
Because most of them had their servers, officially branded as  spanish/french/german besides english. They spoke their native tongue back then, and they will want to do that now too. Except now they don't have their own servers, but that won't change what they want. That would not have been okay on an english speaking server.
---
Do you see now where this is going?
---
Lol... it doesn't need abolished, it needs fixed.
---
A simple solution is "hey prevent this from happening" not "get rid of it because it's damaging REEEE".
---
If you dont like it, fine, but hyperbole and shortsighted, extreme, solutions arent the right way to go about it.
---
Nah, this place is uniquely deranged. There's no doubt about it.
---
Z
---
How are they going to do that when there will probably be like 3 layers (according to how they explained layering). Also, this is beta and they are actively trying different things out for layering. That is what the current stress test is all about.
---
Upgrading your ranged weapon as a hunter is one of the best feelings in wow to me.
---
&gt; if you dont know how to speak english in 2019, you and the country you represent is trash
---
Yikes man.  I'm just an American peasant who only speaks English but this is incredibly fucking stupid.  I feel dumber having read your post.
---
Imagine a world where you're the non English speaker being told you and your country is trash for not speaking an arbitrary language.
---
I think that chat thing could be fixed with addon.
---

---
"private servers" here you said it, people who go on private servers are dedicated people, you just push away the casuals by forcing them to roll on international servers
---
This is true, don't know why you posted it but it's factual
---
They dropped the one bag I got in my venture 1-10. Since I'll more than likely be a tailor I'll just make my bags if I don't get drops
---
The difference is obviously the conten and form of media. If the consumer wishes to partace in a story and there exists a pirated audiobook they can corcumvent the author's channels for a free, likeworthy experience.
---
On the otherhand the consumer might be interested in a news story but not enough to listen to it being delivered through a pod. Since the value of a podcast lies not solely in the story but the presentation this means a transcribe for people who ar just curious about what the wow dev has said will likely just stop caring if they cant read it.
---
I wager josh has lost more by being a dick about some dude offering to do a job hes clearly not willing to do hinselg compared to if some people who where never fucked to listen getting to read the interview
---
Sorry if im typing incoherently it's a mess to correct yourself in the rain
---
&gt;It doesn't affect you or anyone else.
---
Of course, it affects everyone if the community gets split like that. There wont be enough players in the long run to support this kind of server structure, thats most likely why Blizzard is going for this.
---
Yea these servers are pain... There were Unoficial Polish server, unoficial Czech server... Good luck with English on these realms. Players chose them, because they mostly cannot speak English or they wanna be in their own communities...
---
I call people pepegas cuz retard is a bad word lol
---
Well you're obviously a child who can't response any other way than "Your wrong" and "That's cheating" so theres no point in continuing.
---
You have no idea what Pay2Win actually means.
---
Imagine someone made a post complaining about the people who have 10 max level alts with every proffesion on their account because they can dedicate 10 hours a day every day to playing WoW none stop.
---
Is that cheating to you as well? How is that any different? Someone is gaining a huge advantage over you because they can invest far more time into the game than you.
---
Time=Money. 
---
I'm not paying Blizzard for any advantage thus it isn't Pay2Win. Paying for two accounts that both require the physical/mental effort to play is NOT Pay2Win.
---
You have no argument and fail to respond rationally outside "Your wrong".
---
Who are these demon spawn we call the next generation??! Generation Jake Paul?
---
Of course they are! But you're literally just killing mob after mob. You could do that in a cave in Elwynn if you want to as well, though you'll hit the end a lot quicker.
---
Mini fridge packed with Code Red Mtn Dew. Tons of snacks. A plant for oxygen. Legrest and duel monitor to afk and watch stuff on.

Sorry, yes. 100% sarcasm. You need a huge source of people who are always waiting to invite you in order to accomplish what monkey news did. Majority of players will not have that access

&gt; Oh and im calling you out Asmongold, even though...
---
Oh shit this will for sure be on stream. Hi Asmongold. Long time fan, never liked the stream though.
---
Let's not ignore the massive discrepancies in English proficiency you find in Europe. 
---
Generally speaking, there are countries that are absolutely hopeless and others that are 10% away from native level English. 
---
So you roll the dice, if you end up with say, Scandinavians or Dutch, you're fine. If your server is majority Spanish/Italian, you might as well be speaking mandarin. 
---
Certain European countries are simply incapable and unwilling to communicate in English and we need separate servers for some of these.
---
&gt; Edit: mad downvotes from salty center-eu. We all know unlocalised servers are for the best, as long as people get perma’d for speaking a trash-language on public chats
---
People like you should be banned from life simply for being this stupid.
---
I think it really depends on the situation and there isn't one "Best" but, I can think of a few stupid combos.
---
SL Lock, Shadow Priest, Resto Druid/Holy Paladin/Resto Shaman: Lock and Priest are both insanely hard to kill and can just dot everything up and succ the mana of healers. Fears sharing DR is a bit of a downside though.
---
Any combination of Ele shaman, mage and rogue, all 3 of these classes have the potential to burst people down insanely fast. 
---
Double rogue druid, for obvious reasons.
---
Warrior Warlock with any healer is really good.
---
RMP works in Vanilla, similar to how it worked in arenas.
---
There are always good and bad matchups for classes if your opponent is horde and has a shaman or undeads warlocks suddenly become much weaker, but if your opponent is alliance and has paladins and gnomes your roots and slows are a lot less effective.
---
Maybe when people get to 60 and get gear we can organize "Arena" battles and just have 3v3 fights somewhere, like the duel tournament. If we want Alli vs Alli and Horde vs Horde we will need one to use one of the arenas in the game that allows that and somehow make sure there are no griefers.
---
You don’t say a word in this dumb essay about why dynamic respawning is worse. It’s vanilla. It works. It seamlessly transitions into the lategame and only effects starting zones
---

---
Nope. The word "faction" doesn't appear in the EULA at all.
---
The language:
---
&gt; Communicate directly with players who are playing characters aligned with the opposite faction (e.g. Horde communicating with Alliance or vice versa)
---
was removed from the EULA in 2012.
---
Or at all.
---
Why above 30?
---
More like, above level 10. And within 3 weeks of launch.
---
And people shouldn’t act like it’s layering OR server merges
---
This. If not for Football(Soccer for you yanks), Europe would have been at war in 46 because one german called a french guy a SOB.
---
We don't do that here
---
I agree because of how layering works. It's supposed to be an entire continent right? For Horde, that would mean for Kalimdor all Tauren, Orcs, and Trolls would share layers and all the Undead would have their own layers. That's especially bad for Undead since if each layer is 1000 players then for at least the first couple days you will have all 1000 players in the same zone. At least later on with layers, those 1000 players would be spread out in different zones.
---
I think the layer pop cap should gradually increase as players are more spread out. I hope this is part of the data being collected from the stress tests. Yes, populated start zones are cool but there comes a point where it's just a massive bottleneck and preventing people from being able to move on to high level zones which helps solve the problem.
---

Pretty sure he got dental surgery a long time ago
---
Shit man im 38 with a wife and 5 kids. I cant wait for classic to come out. I wont be able to play as much as i used to due to work and family.
---
&gt;But I understand the language barrier and complexities within that will be difficult to deal with.
---
They never were a problem on any of the 'private' mega servers.
---
None of those are true. Even the last point they said layering would AT MOST last through phase 1. If they can, they'll turn it off earlier
---
Dynamic respawning in starter zones. It was their solution 15 yrs ago, it should be there solution today
---
Write Blizzard and tell them that I'm cheating because I want to play on a RP server and play two characters at the same time on seperate accounts because in my fantasy they are brothers that travel the world together.
---
Go tell them I'm cheating and they will laugh at you.
---
Looks like we'll just not have layering then at all 😊
---

---
I saw "huehuehue" a lot in the early/mid 00s in other online games. Maybe it changed over time? I also recall reading kkkkkk often.
---
1 chest per 3000 people. 15000 people = 5 chests.  There would always be 5 chests.  One person using an exploit to get more than one is the issue, not the fact that there are 5.
---
MC you could have 15 good people and they carried the other 25 very easily.
---
That is exactly what they are doing. They are even changing things up on the fly, and have said as much in server messages during stress tests.
---
Alliance scum
---
Bruh it's not released yet lol. That's what I'm talking about specifically for classic. Streaming in general people watch because they can't afford beefy computers to play some games.
---
AND DON'T FORGET TO MASH THAT BELL BUTTON TO GET UPDATES ON NEW VIDEOS. AND NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, HERE'S MY GAMER BREAKING BUG
---
Currently leveling on ND and 1-20 has been aids, fighting to tag mobs , and only seeing 1 every hundred yards is not how this game is meant to be enjoyed. I’m hard pressed to think that it will be any different in all level 30+ zones at launch. A couple hundred extra black lotus on the AH after a week or two of layering on launch will not kill anyone or the game economy.
---
People forget why Blizzard Entertainment is even creating Classic WoW. Private server players who do not like retail and are almost all entirely ‘No Changes’ created a gigantic movement. Almost 300,000 people, who again are not retail players and lean ‘No Changes’, got a petition to Mike Morhaime’s desk. 
---
DO NOT come in here from retail and r/wow telling us if Blizzard changes Classic and we don’t like those changes then just don’t play. 
---
If you condone changes then this game is not for you. 
---
I am surprised by your post considering you browse r/wowservers over r/wow
---
&gt; They let everyone with an active NA WoW account
---
And you think that the majority of people excited for WoW classic would pay $15 to subscribe to a game which is generally considered to be in one of the worst places its been in for years just for a night of beta access? Maybe Classic will be an absolute failure, maybe it's going to be bigger than Vanilla WoW ever was but layering is a way to prepare for both outcomes.
---
Ganking lowbies is serious business!
---
How pray tell does the lowbie magically switch layers in the middle of being ganked?
---
Nos+ started dynamic respawns exactly 1 month after opening and increased it multiple times during its run.
---
This is on top of decreasing specific respawn rates of mobs. 
---
And at release (first week) it was 4-5k player peaks increasing to 6k by late march. On the 28th of march Nost added dynamic respawns. So people did do it but you can find plenty of videos and forum post talking about how you cannot quest well into the 30s.
---
Nos+ 2.0 (the big release) already had nos+ dynamic respawns (that were increased multiple times) in it. 
---
You are correct about group quest loot, a few wotlk servers have those these days, my bad.
---
Sources for nos+ pop peaks:

---
Ravenholt Manor. If you're not a rogue, you never have a reason to go there. It's a really cool place!
---
ahhhh i never really took notice of when it was implemented.
---
Hopefully they can make some adjustments to how it works. 
---
100% shouldn't be able to swap layers in combat...

Well its more like.

"Hey man, Im going to play on X server Y layer today. We can level seperate till lvl 10 and meet up at the hogger quest on sat night." 
---
"Sure thing. Youll be a mage and ill be a pally right?" 
---
Just like I always tell my friend what realm to create a character on, i would also tell him which layer id make a character on. 
---
Also, if they are just starting out and are level 1 and want to play together, they can always delete their level 1 character and remake them on the right layer.

Everyone can confirm this was in vanilla as a band-aid for latency? Just checked on a level 1 mage on BfA, and this same leeway mechanic is there: from mobs only, didnt test against players. I dont think blizz intentionally added this mechanic back in from vanilla, this is from the retail client. You dont need to be subbed to test this out for yourself, I am not subbed.

BOW TO YOUR KING YA SHITS
---
Sharding shouldn't have been in the game in the first place. This was an avoidable issue.
---
what i HATE about the english language is that people who learn it as a secondary language, nowadays, learn it in the context of 2019 internet meme culture and their whole vocabulary reeks of it.
---
&gt; When Blizzard announced Classic, the FIRST THING they said was that they set out to recreate the experience of Vanilla -- but not the launch experience.
---
Yes, and most people figured they could fix that by using modern server architecture (which they can, private servers do it just fine).
---
A year ago, anyone who suggested sharding was labeled a conspiracy theorist, because the very thought of them sharding classic was so far outside the realm of common sense, and yet look where we are at.
---
&gt; If you thought about this for just a few seconds, you'll understand why they came to this decision.
---
Because it's the cheapest and easiest solution they have by far.
---
They likely plan to keep layering indefinitely, but they know nobody wants it. Even Ion admitted in an interview that he knows that, but they're still doing it. The decision likely came from upper management and the devs don't really have a say.
---
The fact that they already tried to deceive us by renaming sharding is not a good sign. On top of that, they have set up the most ingenious excuse for keeping layering permanently when the population is too high come phase 2. And yet again, everyone will fall for it.
---
Could you share the spreadsheet with us though? I’d love to see what you’re cooking up!
---
Sounds like things kids would enjoy.

OMAR GIVE ME MY BETA INVITE. THIS MESSAGE WILL REPEAT.

IMO if you don't want to be ganked don't broadcast your location. If you're broadcasting your location then don't complain about being ganked. Streamers aren't a protected class in WOW.
---
You’re comparing your time spent to their time spent but you’re also investing your time into something that holds more value to you than any of the things your colleagues are doing.

---
Germans had a national vacation day
---
What is actually wrong with you? People are more important than money.
---
I wanna recruit you to my guild! xD
---
Exactly, and layering is the best way to fix that.  Server merges are always going to be extremely messy, and this prevents having several months of people being forced to deal with dead servers, and then end up losing their character/guild names.
---
Even 1 ms can make a difference. Lets say you cast something that would exactly hit the beggining of a batch, if that happened 1 ms sooner then it would have landed in the previous batch and effectively earned you 400 ms.

I'm sorry to break it to you, but I think you will get shit over Brexit even if you dodge those servers. It's like a fucking meme at this point

Das wird sicher lustig wenn keiner versteht was der andere will😂👌🏼

No sharding. Layering? Nah not that either. Merge the servers? I'd lose my name, my guild, etc, its a big hassle no thx.

just have a perfect launch with no dead servers lol EZ
---
Back in the days in french servers i remember that we used : BRD, LBRS, UBRS, Strat UD and thats about it, dire maul was HT.
---
No they won't. Ffxiv had "EU" servers and French spoke French even when they knew you only spoke english.
---
Are people chomping at the bit for classic, or just the classic community in this sub? honest question as I'm not subbed to retail. Is there a big demand from the current players for classic?
---
&gt;Not many people think 1-12 shouldn't be layered
---
Go click on the other thread on front page.
---
yeah, that Illusionary rod is badass
---
You shouldn't be able to rotate your character in the character screen using click and dragging across. 
---
You should only be able to using the 2 arrows in the top left corner.
---
I thought this was William Hung for a minute.
---
This list is native speakers.  If you look at the most widely spoken languages in Europe then English wins hands down

I mostly agree, I don't like the consequences that come with sharding but here we are and we're stuck with it for better or for worse.
---
No exp waste!
---
...fuck he got us
---
I mean, I can imagine 2.5k people waiting, you know? That's not that many.
---
Exactly.
---
The difference in Mulgore at 5pm EST vs 7pm EST was hilarious.
---
I got in and got going right away, dealt with the few restarts/disconnects, and was out of the starting area pretty quick, and greater Mulgore was fairly sparse, maybe only having to share mob spawns with 1 other group of 3-5 people to get kill quests done.  Made a new Tauren when a buddy logged in a few hours later after I was already 10 and ahead of the crush of cows, and was shocked at how fucking packed the starting hub was.  Oh you need 10 cougar pelts?  45 minute quest.  Can't even just grind mobs to level, you're literally waiting in line for spawns.  I logged over to a Troll and an Undead and it was even worse in Durotar/Deathknell.
---
Absolute madness.  Shard/layer the fuck out of the 1-12 zones, take it easy on the 12-25 zones, probably turn it off for the 30+ zones, shut it all off after phase 1.
---
Dont provoke him, it already almost happened twice
---
Stop posting "Stop posting "stop posting"" threads
---
Finally an anti-layering post didn’t get downvoted to oblivion, but rather the opposite. 
---
If you start the petition i will sure as fuck sign it. I’d say change layering to server clusters over level zone cap. But anything is better that what is happening now.
---
The ones you talk to, yeah, obviously. The rest avoid multilingual platforms.
---
&gt;What do you mean? They've stated multiple times that they will be as big as Vanilla servers used to be.
---
Glad that you added a source to your claims to know better /s
---
&gt;Why are you arguing about something you have no idea about?
---
We were never arguing about how big the layers are gonna be, nice try changing the goal posts though.
---
It was never 1 chest per 3000 people. It was 1 chest per server. The fact it's even possible is the problem.  By that logic there should be more than 1 world boss because there's more people. 1 boss per 3000 people!
---
I want to role druid tank.
---
But I'm worried I wont be taken seriously as a tank unless I'm a warrior. But I really dont want to go the most likely most played class. And I've always loves druids and being able to do good dps as a cat is also fun when an extra tank isnt needed. And I like to heal so. Rolling a druid seems like a no brainer.
---
I'm unsure though. I know there is a stigma against druids of any type. I dont want to be shunned or otherwise always put in a back slot.
---
For clarity I loved being a mage. Warrior. Druid as mentioned.
---
I didnt really have as much fun as hunter or rogue.
---
Any insights?
---
language is culture, just thought you might wanna know and WoW is a great example of a virtual world that involves social interaction with economics, jobs etc.
---
A general chat full of random languages getting spammed is not helpful to anyone.

They should just have English enforced servers with a non-English waste land server where these people can go spam general chat with their dribble till they pass out

Try another mmo like swtor
---
&gt; Is there a big demand from the current players for classic?
---
It's not beating out BFA on streams for no reason. Yes people want it.
---
Is this how blizz fucks over the european community and gets people to stop playing? It will be a scuffed launch with people scrambling to make servers the "unofficial german/french/spanish server".
---
You know they were going to anyway, right? There's gonna be more nodes/mobs available, but at the same time the casuals will have an easier time leveling. So that free reign is going to last less time. Pretty sure it's gonna equals out.
---
Of course it does Bobby B, my liege. What is your will?
---
Eh. We got lucky.

Who is against staggering?  I have not seen this.  EU always started before the NA.  
---
&gt; If you slowly let players in hour after hour, it will help spread out people over the first few zones. In the grand scheme of things, the majority won't care that they couldn't start until 3 hours after launch, etc. It could completely remove the dependence on layering.
---
Tiding the flow of people on release is only part of why layering is there.  The other part is to keep the servers from ending up dead.
---
I pity the people that get stuck with the server with the most polish people
---
I was on burning legion at the beginning and after the major guilds left and holy crap...
---
J. Allen Brack: \**rubs hands*\*
---
i understand why we may need layering in the starting zones. private servers have done the rapid re-spawn to combat this. its really only an issue for a week or so after launch and even then its only an issue as the core group levels up. once your past a week and past lvl 13 it really stops being a major issue, sure there are times there are waits for mobs but i dont think its going to need layering all the way until 30. even if it did i feel that the side effects of layering far outweigh any benefit it will provide. 
---
id rather not have it at all but if we do then maybe lvl 10-13 it would end and after a certain amount of time (a week or two) id expect most layering to be gone.
---
For starting zones (like they said initially) it's completely necessary and I fully support it. Beyond that it ruins the feel of the server
---
You’re correct. I saw a different streamers clip and it was absurd. Absolutely game breaking from a wpvp standpoint. 
---
Takes a little coordination and quick invites but it’s definitely possible.
---
It's great that you like that sort of thing. Most people don't though. It's a waste of time and not a good experience for the large majority of player. Which is why layering is a thing. Also layering isn't going to remove any mob competition or wait times, there will still be clustering. It just won't be completely nonsensical and game-breaking.
---
Most people won't be looking at just phase 1 pre-BIS, they won't even be 60 by then. In 2 months, you'll have access to Specter's Blade, which is higher top-end damage than Barman Shanker. And in 4 months, you have access to the AV dagger, which is far superior to both.
---
Phase 1 could last four months.
---
Should I pair blacksmithing or alchemy with a paladin? I feel like the gear you can craft with smithing doesn't really favour healing but alchemy would
---
The same experience can be replicated not be reducing player numbers but by increasing spawn rates, something which can only affect certain zones and mobs of your choosing. No one is saying the servers have to die for it to be authentic don’t be daft, but it is a WORLD of Warcraft and to undermine that for the first crucial months of launch all over anxiety over mob availability is simply moronic.
---
Not to Blizzard shareholders they're not.
---
yes! þungur hnifur my friend!
---
As a Danish player who prefer english, this will have to make me wait a month or two after lunch to decide what server to play on.. Or just go NA and accept a dead sever half of the time I'm playing.
---
Actually this just makes me want to not play at all.. :( A huge let down and i have no idea why they decided this was a good idea.
---
There's over sixty million people living in the UK alone
---
Where on earth have you got these figures from, there are much much more Europeans who speak English than any other language
---
24 hours is way too little, maybe a few weeks on a new launch if pserver were any indicator.
---
&gt; "ah ah ah ah ah"
---
*The Count has entered the chat*
---
One....two....two zhevra hooves! Ah ah ah ah ah ah!
---
Imagine being so delusional.
---
Then what have the people who unsubbed moved to?
---
I completely agree with you and feel the same desires. I think the outcome will be somewhat in the middle. They will hope to retain the old player base and we are seeing Classic as remake of sc1 and later this year Reforged. However these games are not as optimized in monitization and provide less capitilazation oppertunity's. So im convinced that their main focus will forcefully be (by Activision) to focus on different games. Diablo Immortal will see heavy moneytization as will overwatch 2. My Expectations are for diablo 4 to be somewhere in the middle. Pleasing the low Class Immortal casuals while giving a bone to the "fans". 
---
My personal goal is to support Blizzard in their authentic ventures; like Classic and Reforged. Providing feedback and ideas for the future. While refusing to play Overwatch, Heartstone ect. Also I boycot the Retail WoW store. If we would do this collectively the 2 most probable outcomes are for Blizzard to either focus on their New Pixar Playerbase or Split for Activision like Bungie and focus on high quality and Class games for a Premium price. Modelled afther Apple. 
---
This will ofcourse depend on allot of other factors. But its a way for chance. If we comply and dont force Blizzard to make these adaptions. They wont feel inclined to do so and time will tell what will be the result of this. I would imagine it would form of a fantasy EA. Deliviring very bland and mediocre "platforms" sucked dry of creativity but accesable to the "main stream"
---
I feel like I should create a bot to do a PSA reply to every post, saying "obvious trooll, please ignore." but once again I'm actually impressed you managed to be that good with your trolling.
---
That's not what unplayable means. 
---
You could play just fine, servers were smooth af except when they specifically announced they were going to add load for testing. 
---
What you're saying is you couldn't quest efficiently.
---
Nevermind the Pandaren Brewmaster champion in WC3 right?
---
Well, why dont you just join a German guild if you are serious about it?
---
Mobs were so fast on the stress test that I couldn't run from them. The melee range felt like 20 yards. I died 6 times on my way to 15.
---
He’s my favorite Floridian
---
Why did I know that both of these clips would be monkeynews
---
Hey bud, you can go fuck yourself with that bullshit you posted there.
---
I don't think it has been doing fine, and I don't see why that'd change. But to each their own
---
So maybe, just maybe, if Blizzard literally *forced* you to speak English in their games you would actually learn? That's how I learned English back then.
---
I don't have any commentary on leeway. However, your username on classic wow is pretty amusing.
---
That you are dumb?  Trust me, they already know.
---
My first char was a horde druid on magtheridon, I only recognized one name in this entire video it was kinda nuts though.
---
He got that arena chest ninja'd from stupid helmet stun. Dumb ass Vanilla Engineering. lol
---
How do you even know there will be such a big dropoff in the first place?
---
Why do people never mention the other option, which is what all fresh private servers did, and pump dynamic spawns through the roof?
---
I have seen this post where people mention "here are the options" and no one ever mentions that.
---
I would much rather have that than any of the other options or any option with layering.
---
Vanilla wow is not a good experience for the large majority of players either. The whole reason it's even here is because Blizzard was willing to do something for the minority that actually want this.
---
Are you talking about [Lame-tonnerre, épée bénie du Cherchevent] ??
---
I wish someone would pay me to take .20% of a shot of hot sauce
---
They just can’t - kinda like clerics in D&amp;D. 
---
As for tailoring - that’s fine but you won’t get anything to wear from it. Shaman doesn’t really have any best in slot craftables so tailoring or herb/alchemy or probably what you would get
---
&gt; Even me, I am often on reddit, but I do not speak English fluently, my accent is terrible (stereotypical), I'm just used to read it and write it thanks to the internet.
---
Now I just want to listen to you speak.
---
For what it's worth, my French is nonexistent and I would probably have the most grating accent. I can't even *hon hon hon* properly.
---
I have no speed leveling strat and I don't want layering. 
---
I find the frenzy to be exciting. The world feels alive.
---
sure thing boss
---
S E N T I E N T
---
wow killed half of of the top FPS shooter clans in games i followed in early 2005, impact it had was unreal. I only started because half of my clan were playing it and not practising so might aswell see what it was about.
---
I get what you're getting at-- but who said that the stress test was supposed to be representative of what was going to happen on launch day?
---
They specifically said they would be tweaking different layer numbers, so even my starting zone layering experience on stress test server abc will be different than your experience on stress test server xyz.
---
Class competition honestly.  Just like mages and such can’t use maxes.  Lore wise I don’t know if it’s explained.
---
Everyone defending layer thinks we don't understand why, or haven't listened to Blizzard. They can't accept we do and have and still disagree.
---
Because that's the least authentic option of all.
---
That makes more sense, yeah, and I see your point now. I wasn't thinking of the beta for that reason — it's for testing and no one is really playing classic since it's not out yet. Never understood why people care that much about betas and treat them like early access rather than just wait for the actual game.
---
&gt; Streaming in general people watch because they can't afford beefy computers to play some games.
---
That might be true in general, but not really for classic since any PC can run it.
---
But wouldn't you want the games to be in English then? So you are literally forced to learn it?
---
15 was fine *if* you got in literally right off the bat.  It also probably helped that I rolled Tauren, banking on Mulgore being less crowded no matter what server I chose.
---
Honestly, if Europeans don’t like maybe this will give them the motivation to innovate for once. American can’t be forced to cater to eurobabies because their continent is inhospitable to innovation &amp; development
---
Not the guy you replied to but I'm guessing he means that people who played in classic, are already communicating amongst themselves about which server to join. So on day 1 they will all go to the same one and build a community there.
---
What a disgusting mentality.
---
Could be. 
---
But the prevalence of 4chan styled memes on here over the past couple months such as chad/virgin and wojack and zoomer macros leads me to believe there are a decent number of *chan type people in here. And people from the *chans often lean edgy, conservative, "anti-pc", and incel/neckbeard.
---
Pala has even better dispel as it is a fully removal not just for spell effects but poisons etc.
---
Also shamans offers great offensive utility with a huge aoe slow and a high range slow/interrupt AND grounding totem (which  sort of acts like a preemptive cleanse). 
---
On the contrary priest offers nothing apart from dunk heals (what both p and s can give) , cannot use shield on warrior (as it kills rage gain) and generally pretty limited in what he can do with his talenting while shamans and palas get all their utility no matter where they spec.
---
Also you are not supposed to get cleansed all the time. Eating dmg to soak up and dry the casters mana is also a thing what  a warrior ahs to do. You can't really cleanse while 2-3 ppl is ccing around.
---
Sure. But it doesn't have to be all or nothing.
---
since i expect i'll be spending a lot more time in dungeons than raids, this definitely makes rogue life sound a little less boring to me.
---
Or you can just leave it as it is. Most streamers haven't really been hindered by layering, it's only been a vocal minority abusing it.
---
I mean, in any other game, are we surprised sometimes to see other people speaking a different language, when I play Apex legends and hear someone speaking Russian, I'm not thinking that the game is trash.  
---
When I met someone in WoW back in the day, it was ALWAYS a crapshoot if they spoke english anyways due to the fact that gold sellers were rampant and a large part (at least through my own possibly skewed lens) of any EU player I saw came to NA servers because they wanted to, sometimes speaking Spanish or italian, I even met some Germans.  
---
What I'm saying is, isn't it ok to want to try to build communities everywhere rather than try to limit who speaks with each other?
---
It's funny because the majority of people did stop playing at some point.
---
Because if you played during Vanilla in the EU, you might remember this problem and think to check if the server you are rolling on is an unofficial language server.
---
If you didn’t, you probably wouldn’t realize and would choose a ream randomly. This could cause you to quit or have to reroll after a month or two.
---
No, the warrior-priest is subpar to warri-pala/shaman :p
---
Take your own advice.
---
I think you mean MURICAN English.
---
My biggest fear is not eve nstarting on the wrong server.
---
It's that there won't be enough servers to house each and every major language in here. that way, you can't even run away.
---
Layering exists at the continent level. It cannot be (in its current state) limited to specific levels. So, the inverse of what you're claiming is actually true.
---
Tailor is fairly meh
---
Maybe leatherworking and specialize  on mail but I still think it’s kinda bad 
---
I would say wither alchemist/herb or engineer
---
Goes for DOTA and CS aswelll.  
---
The stereotype exists for a reason
---
Thats awesome! Glad there are people thoroughly testing this stuff. 4k/21k isn't nearly as bad as I thought. I'll keep an eye out for updates.
---
But you will. There will be one or two servers that will be the unofficial german ones where most of them will converge.
---
Same with every other major language
---
Warrior or Druid Tauren? Leaning on warrior
---
Seems worse. Normal sharding would be easy to restrict to starter zones.
---
Okay? That doesn't justify being a dick to some people who are trying to help you.
---
I never agreed with doing that. If I wasn't actively healing, I was stop casting to preserve and regen mana. Even casting level 1 mind flay would throw off mana regen. So a less effective healer all around.
---
Wrong, feedback is great. The complaining is retarded.
---
Yeah, it's going to be so much worse for an EN guy to end up in a German server than for a French one!
---
Pretty much this. The three spells you mention translate to Renew, Fortitude, and Shadow Protection for Priest. You can also toss them a PW: Shield, and Fear Ward if Dwarf.  You can spec into Divine Spirit talent for another buff.
---
I believe you can also do Mind Control on enemies and throw them a buff as well. If you want to tryhard this idea then make sure to go for
---
 https://classicdb.ch/?item=13937
---
People communicate in other languages, that's the world for you. It's become such the English thing to complain about other people not speaking English no matter where you are.
---
this is garbage i hate blizzard
---
No one said anything contrary to that either.
---
Fine, layer it, shard it, do *whatever* needs to happen to limit the number of people fighting over mob/quest item spawns in the 1-12, and arguably even the 12-25 zones.  25 is high enough that people will be more spread out, and takes long enough to get to that people will naturally separate.
---
Turn off all sharding/layering after phase 1.
---
Uh, you do know that they will disable layering shortly after classic launches right? It’s only there to help the initial influx of traffic. It’s not permanent.
---
Source: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
How Long Will Layering Be Used?
---
If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic.
---
he linked another clip where he actually does it
---
Dude, you’re wasting way too much time arguing about this. Shouldn’t you be telling kids to get off your lawn or yelling at clouds?
---
Why don't you just talk English? You'll never learn the language if you keep isolating yourself from it. Dubbing TV shows and movies, translating games and media is the stupidest thing you can do to your population. At least Blizzard now presents an opportunity where you can join the international world and become fluent in English. Why not grab that opportunity?
---
Stop giving a fuck about what others do, life is meant to be enjoyed and not to follow a set path. If you enjoy playing WoW, go for it 100%.
---
In this vein, it was so incredibly refreshing to group with random people and *be able to give them pots or items that dropped*. How awesome is that?!
---
Portuguese, not Spanish.
---
So layers, but with extra steps.
---
They know that 90% of the people will quit....  I know this too.
---
What? Layering is on the beta right now. What you are experiencing will be there on release &gt;.&gt;
---
Server clusters. You pick your “layer”  when picking a server and stay on only that “layer” until they collapse it down. Same concept but you and your fellow adventurers stay on the same layer and never shard/phase in and out of alternate realities.
---
What exactly is layering?
---
Yeah agreed, but the idea is you don't need the healing and can take like another half a DPS instead. It's a tradeoff of lots of DMG for a bit of healing, but still a tradeoff. 
---
And classic raids could be completed either way.
---
Don't you mean American?
---
This shit happens to me on retail bfa so often it’s disturbing...
---
I'm going to abuse it.  Nodes, named quest enemy NPCs, rare recipes from limited inventory vendors.  There isn't a reason not  to and it can be beneficial to me.
---
This is great thanks heaps!
---
Layering feels WAAAAY worse than dynamic spawns being instant.
---
Pserver launches were epic, felt awesome. It wasn't even close to "impossible to do anything". If you really wanted to get quests done you could literally sit there and camp the same wolf that respawned every 5 seconds. If not, you could run around like normal and take in all the players and spawns going nuts. Felt like a world event.
---
On the stress test yesterday there were over 50+ people in the barrens and crossroads was literally completely empty for me. Not a single person. I walked from Mulgore all the way through XR to Durotar and saw ZERO people. Felt worse than retail.
---
Incorrect spell animations like charge. There shouldn't be a red trail behind the warrior. That's WOTLK. Pls fix ALL animations back to how they were in Vanilla.
---
And that’s the right way to think.
---
Any MMO I ever played that had some exploit - that exploit got abused in large numbers.
---
Even if only a few hundred players do that, it can damage the economy and give many guilds a headstart that can’t be caught up to.
---
I called someone a lipstick fat fucker and got a suspension for a few days when I was 12... I still don't know what it means or where I came up with it.
---
You could add the whole maghreb that could flock to French servers aswell.
---
Data doesn't have to prove something.  It's interesting related data to be digested.
---
uhh this might mean you are in the beta but you just need to sub?
---
for me the play button doesnt even show as something clickable it says i cant play classic yet.
---
Don't level druids. Srsly druids are sad at 60. They are really fun to level but once you get to 60 tehy are just sub-bar at everything and u'll see pretty low interest from people having a druid in tehir group.
---
I was (still am) a huge alt-o-holic so even though I started WoW on release I only got two characters to 60 before The Burning Crusade released. I never even finished a full dungeon set so that's my first goal after getting to 60. If I have enough time and patience I'd really like to get a dungeon set for my favorite classes and maybe someday all of them.
---
Granted, FFXI (and by extension, FFXIV) had the Auto-Translator feature that allowed communication to exist between languages, even though there are some complexities in how each phrase can present itself to other languages:
---
https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Auto-Translator
---
I wonder if WoW would've benefited from this. Would definitely help the present issues now, but that's a big question.
---
As I wrote this is the list for native speakers. Of course, a lot of people can use english as a 2nd language.  But there is a difference between use and want to use.
---
For a lot of Players Wow is a graphical Chat Client. Yes, you can play the game but the social contacts are more important.
---
It works fine on private servers. The only ones who can't communicate in English are the Russians and Chinese and they get their own servers.
---
I get what you're saying, but if someone said "rofl" to my grandfather he's going to have no clue what it meant.
---
I'm stoked you had fun! This was my experience too. I logged on, found chaos, made friends, and now I have folks to roll with in Classic.
---
"You know the thing that they're not going to do? Can we get a petition going to ask them not to do it?"
---
Big brained.
---
When you zone into a contested zone, the zone name color should be Yellow. And not white/grey. That's how it is in retail. I don't recall zone names ever being this color. It was green for friendly, yellow contested, red for enemy zones.
---
I think dynamic respawns work great, not "slightly". You would need x time the rate of the population (3 times for anything over 6k pop, etc.)  Or do it zone by zone (area by area sometimes) like pservers often do. 
---
But worlds better isn't an actual argument. layering is more vanilla like in that it keeps travel times and respawn times more vanilla like. (and the old slightly dynamic respawns are probably still in, its just they were really weak and focused on 2-3k pops instead of 7-9k.)
---
Sure but OP was literally wrote about phase 1.
---
Thanks be unto og for this retarded addition
---
I haven't played on 'em, so I'm just making assumptions based off pserver youtubers covering classic wow, but so far my understanding is that when there's a question of stats or mechanics, pserver devs  seem to err on the side of easier content. I'm sure some of it is just the arrogance of youtubers, but for a concrete example, blizzard devs working on classic have announced boss hit tables, and pserver players were shocked that boss parry will be 14%, since they're used to 5%. And then youtuber personalities respond "huh. Oh well. That won't matter" like 10% more swing timer resets is some trivial insignificance.
---
yes one of my favorite moments from early on was seeing the same alliance hunter almost my entire leveling experience and the countless times we fought. It was great
---
its all over this sub  "im ok with layering cause i dont want overcrowded zones"
---
Dra å ri på ei hestkuk! Du sku faen vært abbortert sekundet de så det ekle ansiktet ditt på ultralyden førbanna fættlurv.
---
Neida jeg elsker deg
---
They'll play. But think of how much worse the experiance is for them when they don't speak english much/at all
---
As A neighbour and fellow European. I really look forward to having Russians on our server. However I agree that Germans should get their own. The growing patriotism is visable and will affect the community. Like you guys speaking German on forums and group chat.
---
Tu sous estimes grandement le nombre de joueurs qui captent RIIIEN du tout à l'anglais et qui donc se limitent en terme d'interaction si ils jouent pas sur un serveur Français, pour des mecs comme toi et moi ça change rien mais faut penser aux gens qui ont pas eu la chance d'apprendre l'anglais correctement.
---
I mean, if everyone can speak multiple languages as well as her, why are you guys even worried
---
Thanks, I need to explore some more, apparently. lol
---
Truth.  The workers suffer for it though.
---
What does that mean for day and night cycles? They have to be based around a certain timezone.
---
Yeah sure, when people played on potatoes. Clearly a tauren warrior with an agenda right here.
---
Hakkar o Crushridge?
---
That would just break layering into sharding. And by the time most players hit that bracket layering will already stop being a thing.
---
It's use is extended in beta because, well, they want to see the bugs that exist in the system. But it's going to be such a non issue on live that it won't matter.
---
At the worst case, you get authentic population density compared to the original vanilla. After that, you get the mega servers.
---
I think that depends what games your talking about. I frequent the dark souls, monster hunter, and pokemon subreddits and they very rarely have top posts that aren't positive.
---
That's what I'm saying lol I'm a French I know how French are cunts in LoL and it's gonna be the same thing in WoW if they don't unsubscribe before (I will unsub if no rp pvp servers anw)
---
Love how I got called a fucking retard and private server autist for calling out layering as bad a month ago
---
Deutsche Spieler, lernt Englisch!
---
It's a common language throughout the world, even just traveling around Europe you encounter way more people who speak English than French - not to mention the rest of the world where English is the common language. So yeah, the only reason not to do it is if you're planning on not traveling or communicating with the vast majority of the internet.
---
&gt; Why do you think they moved to shards in retail WoW?
---
To better simulate a single player experience.   Less/no fighting over mobs/nodes/quest stuff.
---
The lack of servers is more for keeping the realms populated, don’t wanna server merge after 6 months
---
It also included Xaryu, Cdew and others... Not to say it was the pinnacle of gameplay but saying Venruki isn’t a top player is delusional
---
Brazilian...
---
🖕🏽
---
This is my memory
---
Yeet
---
I'm not sure, playing on one of the lower servers that closed I saw maybe 15 people in the dwarf/gnome area. I never struggled finding a mob, especially once I left Coldridge. Of course all we can do is speculate. I think when they funneled everyone into 2 servers it still ran pretty well, so that's a good sign.
---
Shaman are all Native American-esque with their spirits and ancestors and totems and nature shit. They never cared for swords.
---
I was on a private server last night and got invited to a Hispanic guild. I don’t know that much Spanish, but I have studied Latin a bit as a hobby and was able to talk to them some. It was pretty cool. They thought I was speaking Italian, close enough I guess.
---
Thanks for all the advice! And the tip about Westfall!
---
As a level 19 warrior in Northgarde keep working my way teadiously up each of the towers to kill the leaders at the top, I was sent to a new layer mid fight and greeted by a fresh new mob and respawns. Layering cannot be in the game as is. I didnt even join a group when this happened.
---
If obsessed with you on the forums means "discredited your bullshit and lies a couple times before you were permabanned", then yes. You're even accusing me of being a "wall of no spammer" when I've never done such a thing. Lying trash should be thrown out, gtfo.
---
Are you new? People will bitch constantly about everything in wow..
---
Do you not have phones to translate everything?
---
It’s hard to talk from a us perspective here but aparrently Germany has declared war on England/america via forums in that thread.
---
I can understand wanting to group with like minded people though.
---
Stop crying about people not liking layers.
---
Damn there’s no shamans. Fuck yea. All the gear will be mine!
---
But I'm angry NOW!
---
PSA: None is fucking saying it is permanent..
---
Just because blizzard says it's only "a few weeks" and it will end at the very latest in phase1, it's still a big fucking issue.
---
Yes, we should just ignore his PvP achievements because he's a streamer.  And as the top scientists of /r/classicwow have proved time and again, "streamer man bad!"
---
Why do the French suck so much? 
---
Honestly asking because I want your French opinion on the French.
---
WTF DID I JUST WATCH!
---
The reason it's here is because Blizzard realized it wasn't that much work run a 1.12 server and was financially viable. They want to get more subs from people who either stopped playing WoW altogether, or were pirating the game on private servers. This isn't a gift to the Classic community, it's a product they are selling, which means they very much care about the "majority" experience. 
---
Not to mention it's just basic common sense. Even most Classic enthusiasts, myself included, won't want to deal with the mess. It's not how the game was meant to be played, and it's not up to Blizzards standard that they have been pretty clear about keeping.
---
No swords is probably lore and to differentiate more from Paladins.
---
No I don't see any reason you would go tailoring. Armorsmith maybe if you want to make gear.
---
You can learn Russian and join the horde.
---
That's the world we live in.
---
Lmao who plays this still
---
Oh, I understand! So it's essentially little versions of realms. Is that right? 
---
I keep hearing people say that folks are gaming the layering system. Is that because they glitch around until they reach an unpopulated layer and complete their quests without others in the way?
---
So is this the same as Sharding.  I thought we had worked this out that no sharding/whatever the tech is will be used. AT ALL. Because it completely ruins one of the main driving forces behind Classic.
---
Sad times, hope we get a us one at least.
---
whatever name you call them i rly couldn't give a flying fuck. I say blizzard because thats what they say is their name
---
Or you make your own group and only have to roll against a warrior.. it's the hardest peice to get forsure. Took me like 10 runs to get the one from DM west

As long as we can still have a single market ping agreement with our friends in the EU.

Was that last bit a Eurotrip reference? :D
---
Thanks for the explainer!
---
&gt; If at the end of the day on August 25th the CEO and board said "Nah shut it down" regardless of the investment, that is what would happen.
---
That absolutely could happen, and it would be a great way to annihilate your customer base for this franchise, and probably create a lot of distrust in fans of their other series.
---
Problem for Blizzard is a lot of people aren't *just* Warcraft fans, or just Starcraft fans, they're *Blizzard* fans.  If you shit all over one game, you're likely to lose players from your entire company, not just your one game.  If Blizzard put this much time and effort into Classic, then pulled the rug out from under it on the eve of its, release, me, and a lot of people I game with, would literally abandon Blizzard entirely, in every one of their games.  New Diablo came out?  I can't support Blizzard.  Abandon ship on the entire company for that kind of betrayal.
---
We don't even say zug zug in French but zog zog haha
---
This is why I don't.
---
Just sold out
---
Hilarious. Only ever having played on US realms I had no idea this was going on. We only had to deal with a small amount of Brazilians asking "u br?" In groups
---
I just think that whole flavour of comedy is juuuust about to be well and truly played out. I've been seeing this niche in standup grow to become a standard stereotype of sorts, into seeing subs like me_irl smashing r/all with their "kill me plz ExDee" with thousands of upvotes on the daily.
---
"_What's.. the deal.. with *airplane food*?_"
---
Apparently people are going to do an unofficial server, it’s something at least.
---
Stop posting about stopping posts that are about telling others to stop posting

OK, thanks for the clarification. lol

Come out ye Orcs and Tauren and flag for pvp like a man! Show yer raid how you won your epics down in Blackrock Mountain!
---
Hey! Stop posting "stop posting 'stop posting' threads" threads! You're clogging up the feed with your posts about your opinion on other peoples opinions!
---
I’m American dude, why so touchy? It’s just a harmless generalization.
---
I'll do it the other way round and play on an international server to improve my english. However, there will be german guilds. Join them and you will get what you want.
---
Its almost like the point of a BETA is to identify game breaking bugs, technical issues, exploits, and interactions before the game is released...
---
Just dynamically increase spawn rate of quest-monsters by how many people actively hold the quest in that zone.
---
It's not hard.
---
This was a great suggestion! I'm watching a video from Nobbel87 on the entire storyline/lore of Warcraft. It's like 40 minutes long, and he speaks so fast that I had to slow it down a bit, but it's really great so far! I'm like 20 minutes in, and I already feel sad for the Orc race. I want to try them out next!
---
I don't PvP but I like playing a Druid when it comes to helping randoms. Between MotW and Thorns you have some helpful buffs and of course there is healing. When not in a group I don't mind burning up the cooldown on my res either if I am not able to save them in time.
---
Tell that to the French. Hardly any of them are fluent in English.
---
The german community alone had over 60 german speaking realms. How much fucking server are they planning on?
---
Also the german speaking official forums are fucking shitshow right now LMAO
---
Generalizations are hardly ever harmless. Just pointing that out.
---
100%, this is just brainlet outrage time. Swear that there is a a soy issue involved here. The levels of  addiction to drama these people have.
---
Yeah, I will clearly never be able to see anything. Especially with being an adult now.
---
#NoChanges. There were definitely servers on launch (Bleeding Hollow) that will have matched the hype for today's day and age. This experience will pass though as people level up, it's not a big deal. Not everyone needs to have a perfect experience in classic at every waking moment and that's what the original experience was all about. The game was always bigger than you and what you wanted.
---
I´m just here to say not everyone hates this concept.
---
Having an European community is pretty much normal in gaming nowadays. I personally look forward to play with people from all over Europe.
---
There won´t be enough servers for a nation to "claim" it like many people seem to think.
---
Well, they are undead, if anyone could do it it's them.
---
upvoting for truth. Raid time means time of the first pull. If you're encountering a group where "Raid time" means people BEGIN to log on and sort their banks and repair and finish a quest and blahblahblahblah, this is a very serious problem and needs to be either corrected or abandoned.   
---
People that waste the group's time need to learn that we are not NPCs the game has generated to help you get items.

Ahahahaha so mad. Enjoy your final precious days on your shitty retail garbage love. Don't lose sleep over my forum posts. Get well soon!

Nostalrius. Blizzard shut down the most popular private server ever and in response to that, almost 300,000 vanilla players SIGNED A PETITION encouraging Blizzard to create a legitimate Classic option to World of Warcraft. That petition found it’s way into the hands of one Mark Kern, a former team lead for World of Warcraft in 2004 and has worked on all blizzard IPs, who then delivered that petition to Mike Morhaime, then CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. 
---
So many people come into this subreddit and tell us “layering is here to stay deal with it. Do like it don’t play it” but have no idea about how Classic found its way into existence, nor understand the spirit of Classic WoW. 
---
We were loud enough about loot trading. We can be loud enough about layering. 
---
Which is completely unrelated to racials.
---
exactly
---
So don't play.  No one gives a fuck.
---
He probably never had a level 60
---
Well I have plenty of friends who will feel forced and will not even want to try it.
---
Thanks! I keep hearing folks reference Iron Forge. So I'm looking forward to that!
---
Wasn't a problem on retail, ever heard of Burning Legion EU?
---
Ja servus grüzi liebe Freunde! Worst idea Blizzard ever had. Almost. Okay, not even close but still stupid
---
Lol that shit isn't good no matter what way the fan boys spin it. If he has a bad day, someone ganks the shit outa him and talks shit, insta Black list. It's just plain retarded imo and will be abused.
---
I though my pun with the quest name was great apparently you think otherwise...
---
Let´s fight racism with separation!
---
Wait..
---
theyre undead they were probably all removed
---
Sounds like I need to spend a lot of time trying different things until I find what's right for me. 
---
I was battling the same thing. Alliance friends but I love shaman. I gave in since my other favorite class is druid and I don't mind playing a night elf since they were my favorite WC3 faction.
---
I don't like this at all. I want to play with and against german fellas, just like back then :(
---
Druids are sad at 60 , They are awesome to level but sucks big time on max lvl. Avoid unless you are ready to put some SERIOUS work into making it work (for a mediocre results)
---
See my comment underneath chewbacca
---
What is layering??
---
The community banding together to agree upon solutions to problems is literally what made classic what it was. It's a problem that builds better communities if they're solved by the community, like publicly shaming a ninja looter instead of demanding Blizzard do something about it. 
---
And if you're worried about people being racist against people who don't speak their same language then spoiler alert declaring a server Blizzard Official as a certain language won't make those people not racist.
---
Average ping between London and Frankfurt is 16ms.
---
Average ping between London and Chicago is 85ms.
---
In a game with 400ms spell batching, I think most UK players should just accept the extra 69ms "lag" and join their English-speaking brothers on one of the handful of US East servers.
---
Wtf is their reasoning
---
I don't have beta and just wanted to play something a couple of weeks ago.
---
I jumped on a free character, didn't use any heirlooms, and got to lvl 20 with max gold, mostly blues, and a couple of epics within a few hours.
---
Heirlooms are completely unnecessary in modern WoW.
---
if they go with that decision on release I'm gonna send tons of elephant poop to the headquarter
---
I’ve literally been doing all of those since the announcement. Except all my kid does is crawl around and poop, lady problems. Also too retarded to write books. I can’t wait, gotta do something to fill the time lol. Cheers buddy see you out there
---
Germany here, looking for the exact same thing. Will be rolling on US servers so I'm very interested in this EU timezone raid team. Still got possible spots? (Also what faction?)
---
My guild had a feral as our #2 tank from molten core to naxx. It was incredibly rare but they're valid.
---
I didn't mention it in my post, but I did find my way to Hogger by following a friend I made! That was tough, and we kept getting ambushed by other knolls. I loved it though! He shared the quest with me, so that was helpful.
---
So if you crit the first hit of windfury, do all of the other hits crit as well? If you look at the end of the clip they were all crits, which seems kind of insane.
---
Not really critical to wear cloth like it is with Paladins. Most Shaman gear that drops is going to have healing stats on it. Tailoring wouldn't be much use to you outside of crafting bags and selling your items. Totally up to you, though!
---
&gt; The 1v1 tournament isn't what I'm basing my claim on, Venruki's trophy case is. You're not too bright for reading comprehension I guess.
---
oh the irony. Talking about reading comprehension to me, what a joke.
---
I said the benchmark wasn't good at all, and it wasn't. Basing he's "One of the best players in the beta" for winning a 1v1 tournament is ridicilous but you aren't that smart so I Guess you don't see that.
---
the vanilla experience?  maybe we should allow Blizz to work beyond the limitations of "No Changes".
---
It's not like they are handling retail much better. This is what Blizzard has become.
---
Haha thanks for letting me know.
---
Then everything is fine. Back to the spreadsheet.
---
oh right. Did think it scaled really good tho. :)
---
You mean like on a real server?
---
The brain power.
---
muahahahaha suck it EU fags.  
---
always shitting on US Servers.  goodluck against the chinese gold farmers destroying your auction hauses HAHAHAHA
---
I'm gonna send Blizz Tons of Elephant Shit if they going to let this be on release
---
I never said beta and I never said winning the 1v1 tournament had anything to do with my claims. He's the greatest mage in the history of WoW and the stats back my claims.
---
This is going to be so ghetto lol.
---
They are SO awesome. I seriously cannot wait to have awesome gear like that.
---
I like Perp but he is a Pserver player(EU to boot) so I feel like if the mechanics he is used to on Pservers aren't the same on a Blizzard server he'll of course take issue with it. This leeway that he is talking about nerfs rogues and of course he mains a rogue, so he might be taking this a bit personally.
---
No Brexit for you!
---
Just play on a US East server. Your ping to Chicago is only 69ms more than it would be to the datacenter in Frankfurt and in a game with 400ms spell batching, that won't matter at all. They'll be plenty of people from the UK that do this (I worked nights and raided with a UK guild for much of Cata), so you'll barely notice the timezone switch.
---
Blizzards greed knows no bonds
---
I'm in a similar situation in that I want to play a Paladin but I prefer the Horde in terms of experience.  I usually prefer healers having played a Druid and then later a Shaman from early TBC until Legion.  I've never played a Pally so I figure now is my time.
---
I'm not "anti-pc" by any means, but if you're offended over a lighthearted comment about lining up, you're taking life entirely too seriously(imo).
---
Be a man of your words and don't play it if you don't like it. 
---
2521th whining post won't help.
---
I’m slowly leveling a warlock in beta and it’s a ton of fun, but with this last weekends AV testing I was turned off by the way it played at 58 . Maybe it was just the heat it had.
---
The North remembers.
---
How did you get your cursor to smear like that?
---
Yeah this sounds like it sucks.  Sorry EU
---
If level 30+ can't layer then they're all in 1 layer. That will ruin PvP for lowbies in that layer and make it too easy in the rest.
---
I saw that thread. It was pretty interesting. It seemed like the level 60 stats are likely accurate as those would have had the best data mining. People were thinking that the scaling between 1 and 60 was the most likely part to be inaccurate.
---
It also seemed like hunters are the most likely other class to be overtuned. But yeah, who knows maybe warriors are overtuned in places too. Could be all classes for all we know.
---
Imagine playing Pokémon and telling people they're losers over the internet LUL.
---
Oh I think so too! I love to promote [Taladril's Treatise on Druid Tanking](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla) to people who doubt their capabilities. 
---
I wasn't a druid in vanilla but I remember the struggle of druids wanting to be accepted as a non-healer.
---
Rogues absolutely compete with warriors for gear, at least in higher level dungeons. Rogues and Warriors will both be after items like Truestrike Shoulders, Hand of Justice, and Blackhand's Breadth among other things.
---
nah see it that way either you can be a wage slave and regretting live or you can live in the wooorld of warcraft and archive something that matters ....yeaaah liiiveee tooo wiiin
---
1on1 they are amazing. But group pvp, they are a lot less effective with dispels and they are easily trained. Idk about pve except they have a farm a few shards before raids and they spam shadowbolt
---
Those are the non-elite packs? Ignore all of them except the elite.
---
I warn them not to pull, if they continue to pull them they can tank it.
---
honestly yeah that makes sense i agree
---
Bad things are still bad even if they're temporary.
---
It's a fine art, eating cleaves for Rage.  Get killed and the whole raid will laugh at you or call you a baddie.  Survive and your exploits will forever be enshrined on some raid log website for all to see and worship!

---
&gt; edit: I checked again today and it wasnt there anymore. Weird.
---
&gt; another edit: i checked again and it was there. I also saw it in Ogrimmar. The merchants have only one  pole each time and you have to wait for them to restock.
---
&gt; The pole is definitely in the game.

&gt; I got one today in Ratchet from Kilxx.  I checked him earlier and I did not see one, but then I checked 20 minutes later and he had one.

What is layering?? Clueless classic fan here!
---
Where did the Nochanges kids go?

Or maybe you should’ve increased your intellect to allow you to realize that sarcasm does not translate into text.
---
Imagine thinking BFA didnt flop so hard that Blizzard is rereleasing a 15 year old version of WoW just to appease the player base.
---
&gt; Who would you say is the best mage in WoW's history, then?
---
Jah? 10x better

---
&gt; it would likely be easier to split layers in level ranges (1-30, 31-60 for example), but then you'd see plenty of people invite each other so that the level 40 can enter the 1-30 layers (or vice versa) and quest uninterrupted. so that's obviously not going to happen.
---
From /u/typhyr replying to a parallel comment in this thread.

&gt; I never said beta and I never said winning the 1v1 tournament had anything to do with my claims. He's the greatest mage in the history of WoW and the stats back my claims.

X fking D if you think venruki is the best mage in the history of wow theres literally no point in even taking my time to respond to you after thsi statement. full on delusional
---
If it was for 10 years **only**, would we be supposed to stop complaining too?
---
Great advice! You're right, everyone at this point will only know me as a human paladin. I'm gonna create some more characters and experiment though!
---
Imagine thinking Blizzard isn't releasing WoW Classic with every intention of converting those players over to Retail.
---
WTS weapon chain PST
---
Don't be surprised. I've been reading this subreddit for a while now in prep for Classic. There was an announcement post that quickly vanished because of an incorrect date in the title. It was hard to find once it vanished.
---
You say that but the one i’m on is pretty hellish for Australians. Servers normal raid times start anywhere from 12 at night -&gt; 10 AM and can finish at 4. I haven’t experienced even a PUG raid at “normal” hours for myself.
---
Imagine being so bigoted that you avoid playing a game because you might see someone type in German.
---
Can and want are two very different things. Okay with English on reddit, not okay with English in my social fantasy game.
---
i'm glad you enjoyed! orcs are a really cool race and while a lot of people don't seem to like it, i really enjoyed their starting zone in vanilla, so many cool sights to see
---
I think it's more an issue that Twitch culture feels "external" to wow, where at least Thunderfury spam felt "internal" to wow.  Jokes like Mankirk's wife at least are referencing the game.  Of course, the Chuck Norris jokes don't fit that, but generally speaking that's the case.
---
The anal thing also requires the tiniest bit of creativity, far more than the chat flooded with "OMEGALUL" kind of bs.  The spamming nature of twitch chat is def part of why people have an aversion.
---
I'll grant you though, it's not like wow never had stupid chat.  But I think it's fair to have a personal distaste for the particular flavor of stupid of twitch chat.
---
no problem!
---
Any healer is fine really. Playing a warrior/rogue/warlock at very low hp having a healer come along and top you up is the nicest feeling. In that situation I guess druid is probably the best seeing as regrowth is the longest HoT and mark/thorns is a nice long lasting buff. The main drawback of druid is no normal ress means you can't just ress people you come across in the world - there will be times you just have to say *sozz no ress* which is pretty lame.  
---
In a group shaman/pally are easily the best support classes. Their party buffs are far stronger than fortitude or motw/thorns. Pally in particular with bop and LoH as well as bis class buffs and aura is just ridiculous group support.
---
Fair enough, can't speak for other regions.
---
If you are having trouble converting time zones, maybe you shouldn't take a day off school to play video games.
---
I can already see it. Newbie areas will be like "sind sie deutscher?"
---
I'm not EU, but if I was this would be a huge drag.  I would almost play casually until servers sort themselves out and then roll on your respective (non official) regional server.
---
Ich halte es damals wie heute wenn ich mit Franzosen spielen muss.

Context: The german realmpool "Blutdurst" (bloodthurst) was heavily lagging for multiple weeks back in 2010 without satisfying responds from Blizzard. One weekend the entire Blutdurst community decided to do something more drastic about it and raided the english realm "Aerie Peak". The entire server was spammed and lagged until most people disconnected. Keep in mind that Blutdurst was just one Pvp Realmpool out of the over **60** German servers there where back on Wotlk.

This doesn’t clarify anything. All he said was people misunderstood him without any elaboration on what people misunderstood. Useless clip.

Yep, and this is why Bungie is throwing office parties over finally getting out from Activision's yoke.

This “shit” just needs to go away.
---
Make B team great again
---
Many of the people returning are older and want to COMPLETELY avoid that kind of cringey 15 year old culture this time.
---
What shitshow? I haven’t been paying attention too much
---
WOTF is "meh" overall, even for PVP as warriors have an innate way to break fear/charm (Zerker rage if they are in zerker's stance). But the stun resist is so much stronger in pve/pvp. Alternatively, the tauren racial with health boost is stronger for PVE.
---
You realize your ignore list is not unlimited, yeah?
---
Thanks so much! I want to experience everything, but I think a slow burn is probably the best way.
---
Stop letting some jackass who runs a company ruin your fun.  Its classic play it enjoy the 6 months and unsub.
---
&gt; goretusk lovers…
---
I know someone arrested for just that

K bye

Well Retail is just a dropdown menu away on your launcher, have fun.

Omg....read...the...news... it's on every WoW website that covers classic.

Try mind controlling Saurfang dude.

---
swords are not lore friendly, have you seen an shaman im wc1,2,3 with swords? need more fist weapons!
---
Then why even have it.
---
I can speak English and even had a max level character on an English server, but honestly although I was super hyped for classic, having to speak a secondary language in a game where community is so important makes me question if I still want to play. And I wanted to show the world to my 13 year old brother since I started the game around that age, but he doesn’t speak English yet...
---
Not sure if this is an undead-specific issue or not, but I don't see "green blood" getting spilled out of me when getting hit with critical strikes. I'm sure other races also got red blood spilled as well, not sure if its broken for them too.
---
They were in war3
---
So use your sub to play retail. You are not the target market.
---
I mained a rogue in 2005 and couldn't find a raiding guild as a result. When I left and came back in 2006, went Mage and had no problems.
---
That said, the player mentality has changed a lot since 2004. Make your rogue, but also make a backup plan.
---
Boooo
---
1 +  1 = 2
---
Don’t play then....?
---
#YES!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Thank you! I've been making friends a bit in game, and some folks have DM'd me on here. I'm excited!
---
&gt;  They've all done it on private servers repeatedly and yes its a competition for mobs and leveling but that is part of the experience.
---
Those shit pirated servers have like 10k people on a server...  They're insanely overpopulated.
---
Pretty much this. Less layering as things go up.
---
With that said, they should be able to spin up a layer on demand (hopefully) if they are seeing massive bottlenecks. If there's a thousand player in a single zone on a single layer, it's going to be not very fun. But by the time people are reaching the 30's many of the herd will be thinned out.
---
Be sure after all you do is check the subreddit for days on end to make a post about what other people post like OP.

Thanks! I don't want to be a burden, so DM me if you want to play at launch and I'll do everything I can to be helpful!
---
Did someone say [Maladath, Runenverzierte Klinge des schwarzen Drachenschwarms]
---
Gg
---
Could someone eli5? What is layering?
---
Literally impossible given how layering functions. Thats what makes it layering.
---
Warlocks look fun but I loathe pet micro. I'm more into pvp with casual pve secondary. Experienced pvper in vanilla as rogue and warrior. But I've forgotten a lot. Are warlock pets pretty much autopilot either attack or defend modes? Or do you have to click on them then tell them to use certain abilities at the right time? In other words how big a pain in the ass are warlock pets?
---
Tried watching some warlock streams but the streamers don't really narrate what they're doing and why.
---
Orc has both stun resist for pvp and axe specialization for pve. Blood Fury is also a good dps boost but the healing nerf makes it pretty undesirable in some situations.
---
Troll has berserking for pvp and pve. I don't think the regen racial does much but the damage to beasts could be a plus for leveling.
---
Undead has WotF which is mostly just good in pvp, which means the other two races have at least 1 racial over UD for pve and Orc arguably has a better pvp racial.
---
Just my two cents, trying to be objective on the matter. I don't think UD isn't a good choice but I figured I would offer insight on why UD may or may not be the "ideal" choice as far as minmaxing goes.
---
Yeah, on raid nights in Vanilla, we were expected to be at the instance at raid time. If it’s a 7 pm raid, you’re zoned in and ready to go by 6:55. Not really that hard
---
You forgot, If playing a hunter, leave pet taunt on 24/7 when running dungeons it helps scare the enemies and reduces damage taken by the tank
---
What is layering?
---
I'm watching some Warcraft storyline/lore videos on youtube right now. REALLY digging it so far. Makes me want to play completely through Warcraft 3 so I can get the full effect. Although I think I need to play the other 2 versions as well.
---
Hi Nao?
---
Genau!
---
If they think for one moment that I will write English on the Global channel then they are mistaken. 
---
I can't wait for people to have massive communication issues if they can barely understand English (Looking at you, Spain and France)
---
With that said I'll stick to German.
---
sorry for my ignorance, but in first vid when he says to make a new character and "make sure it's in layer 1 or 2" etc, how do you get into a specific layer to begin with, and how do you know which layer you're in?
---
The other way around. I will fuck up regardless but its nice to have an excuse lol.
---
Are you really this dense?  There WOULD BE MORE THAN ONE BOSS PER SERVER.  That's why they have repeatedly said that they have to remove layering after phase 1.  World bosses come in phase2.
---
Demon Hunter. Who else has sacrificed everything. The light is not inatelly good. Just look at Y'rell.
---
Agreed, ridiculous decision.
---
perhaps people like things you dont...omg amazing people can have different tastes...news at 11.
---
What.
---
&gt;what I care about is people using layers to dodge WPvP. 
---
What?  This doesn’t even make sense. Who rolls on a PvP server to dodge WPvP?  Just play on a PvE server...
---
If they give you the option to play on language specific servers and you decide to go against that and talk French/Spanish/German on an English server, they'd be within their rights to mute you for a time or move you to another more appropriate realm, but they can't reasonably deprive you of the product you paid for with an outright ban.
---
Yep. At higher levels, there are a few special events and rare spawns. Like, there's a PvP tournament every 3 hours, and there is only supposed to be one winner. People were glitching the system so they could win twice within a few minutes.
---
Yes, camping and killing quest mobs for an extended period of time is considered greifing.  Back in the day they would do a couple things depending on the GM, ranged from temp bans, forcibly moving you from the area. 
---
Had one guy on my server forcibly logged out, the GM then moved him to the most obscure area in the game, put most of his gear in the bank and left him there without a hearth stone or mount to get back. Had to walk all the way to whatever flight path he could find.
---
I literally said I started playing on Server 4 and switched to 15 when they merged the servers. That happened during 5pm - 6pm. Why are you lying about my experiences?
---
Yeah there were a lot of people around Sarkoth. Guess what, I didn't go on Reddit to whine about other people playing the game, I joined a group and got it done in a couple minutes. That's Classic WoW.
---
Except that this says exactly nothing. Or do you know what the "set time" is?
---
Warlocks are fine. Never going to be a super popular class in vanilla. They are a poor dps for 5 mans, suck in T1/2 raids, average pvp while levelling. Yes in good gear at end game they are very powerful pvp and pve, but really that just means end game they are as good as mage, while the mage is good for the entire game.  
---
If WotF didn't exist and horde got Salv they would be more popular for sure, but that's vanilla.  
---
And yes they are ridiculous in TBC, but they got some huge buffs so that's not really surprising.
---
Can someone link me a reliable source for end game dps?
---
Chat Channels shouldnt have the zone attached next to them (eg General - Tirisfal Glades) should only say General.
---
Or maybe they just have different preferences?
---
Actually nvm this is prolly a bait fuck...
---
But layering isn't done by zone
---
How are people going to know which servers to join? They aren't reusing realm names.
---
I have this one lost somewhere in my home
---
You forgot the one person speaking English:
---
GO TO WWW.GOTGOLD.COM FOR IN-GAME CURRENCY! $1 = 5g!
---
I whispered two different people with a “holy $#!+ balls is that a collectors edition wow?” 
---
Followed up with a “I’m so F’n stoked for you!”
---
Pally
---
Best compliment to a human mage? My daughter is set on it and I'm debating between warrior, priest or druid. We won't be doing any raids.
---
You shouldn't be able to phase via groups unless you are in a capital city or inn.
---
You can’t control what later you’re on
---
The only way to change layers is to be forced off one and into another (automatically), or to join a party; then you get moved to the layer of the leader
---
These are problems that weren’t in classic; beyond what server and faction you’re playing
---
Yes, unless they implement something similar in Classic. You can of course just create a channel called World but you'll see messages of everyone joining/leaving.
---
Hunter and priest for me
---
Ok. So why are you here again?
---
Shaman cant use swords for the same reason hunters cant use maces. 
---
Tailoring is fine but most everyone will tell you engineering is the only profession that contributes to class combat prowess.
---
Professions dont matter outside of engineering except for makin money, so to that end do whichever one you would enjoy doing and find a way to make money with it.
---
Looking forward to a living breathing stormwind during launch!
---
Enjoy bfa!
---
What exactly is spell batching?
---
That's some end content Karma raiding right there.
---
This isn’t even unique to IT. I work as an analyst for a medical supply company and we have people working weekends all the time.
---
That's just going to look like massive lag or a giant bug to most players. They aren't going to understand wtf is going on. Then they will get pissed, go to the forums, bitch, find out it's "legit" and get even more pissy.
---
Well they are undead, not quite sure they even need some of those organs.

its a stress test. theyre stressing it to work out the bugs. its intend for it to not work properly then. otherwise the stress test would be pointless
---
They blue post about language but about layering....
---
Now you get to know what it felt like to get stuck on azralon/ragnaros as an NA player lol.
---
Ok cool story. Classic isn't for everyone, maybe you would enjoy BFA.
---
I would say it COULD be mage. Mages can give free buffs that are beneficial for all classes while leveling or even at max level to be kind. They can give free food and water if they are truly feeling kind. Usually mages are extremely rich because of their insane farming capabilities so if a mage were to help with loans that’s possible too. Even portals can be nifty in some extreme generous cases. I would say mage in general can do that most “favors”
---
Ez fix just add a minute timer to a layer switch...  Maybe You can only do it once every 20 minutes or something too.
---
I don't play LoL, but I do play a bit of HotS and I can't remember ever seeing anything in French. Just lots of Russian.
---
This answers the initial question. It was not in 1.12? It's not in classic!
---
You realize that without worrying about Russians the land mass size of all of EU is much smaller than NA.
---
What realm will have the Croatian(Alliance) and Serbian(Horde)?
---
Lol. That first clip is worthless.
---
I am quitting my job and leaving my family in preparation
---
I'm on the beta realm pvp on horde. I just downloaded and started a scan. I'll upload this evening.
---
NA has Spanish and French only speakers as well.  More so in spanish.
---
Or just speak English.. it's pretty simple really
---
Yea maybe, but the term Queen’s English doesn’t refer to her having invented it. Or even been around when it was began.
---
It refers to her ownership of it as sitting monarch, as she would have traditionally been the ‘owner’ of the isle and it’s language.
---
Hehe yes it is ard. :D
---
Anyone looking to "re-create" or relive the vanilla experience will be gone in 3 months... so they won't matter :)
---
Classic is for those that enjoy playing the best version of WoW where there was no flying, every class didn't do the exact same dps, and where you actually talked with people while playing the game.
---
The casual friendly player aka fortnite players or cata+ players will complain about classic and it won't matter because they won't be playing when the rest of us are.
---
No game lives up to the hype - it's 2019... too much quality competition.
---
that is one extremely creative insult.
---
Yeah you definitely need it in Westfall/Redridge. After that it’s fine.
---
Most of us are going to play regardless but still want to try and push for the best version of the game we can get. 
---
I don't see where you're coming from with this
---
post. People will or won't play the game at their own discretion. It's obvious that you are tired of seeing people complain online but then repeatedly stress that people should 't stop complaining....
---
I like when games are challenging. Playing on easy mode isn't fun for me.

Oooh, thank you! I'll save this. 
---
Should I play Warcraft 1 and 2 as well?
---
How would you know if their layering is working?
---
Just play your own game.
---
&gt; so we had to unofficially choose Spinebreaker as the Spanish realm.
---
Yep, thats whats going to happen for sure. People speaking a language are going to have a chosen designated server, and its going to lead to hostility between the camps of people on said server that don't speak that language. This time Blizzard cant ban for reports though, because they are creating this issue themselves...
---
But damn this is rough for EU.
---
Won't you still see that when people are invited to groups?
---
If you link an object It will appear with the name it has in your client for everyone, but if someone clicks on it, the item will show in the language of their client. That’s all I know
---
Don't pretend like you didn't understand why I mentioned barbershops. I made a reference to players wanting an aspect from modern WoW backported into Classic to ease their experience, which is exactly what layering is and it's exactly what stuff like barbershops are. It's a fair comparison. People want barbershops but they're bad for the game. People want layering but it's bad for the game.
---
As far as not being interested in discussion, give me a break. I've posted pages of well-thought-out commentary on the pros and cons of layering, do you think that sparks discussion? No, people downvote it and the discussion never happens because as soon as their logic is challenged they just resort to saying stupid shit like "feel free to yell at a wall." This subreddit has made it clear that it's not interested in actual discussion.
---
Thats fine but 30-60 layering will very obviously damage the game. The system is flawed, they are welcome to release it but they shouldn’t be surprised if people stick to Pservers lol.
---
You are failing to understand what layering is if you think you can layer starting zones and NOT the whole continent
---
Calling people and their country "trash" because they don't know english is pathetic man. Outside of that, there are big issues with no language based servers that have already happened in Retail. 
---
What do you do when 80% of the players of your server are coming from two non-english speaking countries, say Bulgaria and Poland, and are, on purpose, creating guilds where the official language is their home tongue ? It's all nice to ban non-english speakers from public chat, but such situation literally means you can't join most of the guilds on your server because they're language-centered. 
---
That issue is non existant when you only have one Giga PServer, because there are so many people on it anyway, and there are no other choices as to where to play. This problem occurs when you have a multitud of servers. That said, I cannot comprehend why you're so agressive.
---
Even WotLK was a rather big difference from vanilla, which trivialized leveling and survivability in general. Furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that vanilla was 12 years ago, I don't really think it mattered when you started, peaked or stopped.. it's gonna take time to adjust and be at your best.
---
Is it better to have a low pop dead realm for every language or a few high pop thriving realms where you might run into some language barriers? Honest question. I do not speak anything other than English but my current mindset is if the realm is so low pop that I never GET to speak to someone then the language restrictions were all for naught.
---
Well, now they have a reason to learn English. I really hope Blizzard forces people to talk English in global channels. You can have a French or German guild, but jesus christ it can't be that fucking hard to communicate in English.
---
Quality post.
---
The answer is: it doesn't matter until at least 2 years from now.

thanks for sharing

Simplicity in the start, extreme in the maxxx

Thanks! I've been adding my spells to the bar at the bottom, but it seems to get removed every time I log out and back in.
---
Running dungeons more than once with any group you join will work too I guess
---
Cuck
---
You can't layer one without the other. Doing the whole continent is literally what layering is.
---
oi, you got a loicense for that blade?
---
Have you ever spent time on a properly dead realm? Its an awful experience.
---
Im not advocating either way, just saying how fucking bad it is.
---
You’re right, but they said Phase 1. People will be 60 long before phase 1 is over and can abuse the system. I will admit that it’s not a abuseable in the early levels
---
If this is true, I'd love to know as well.
---
If they're willing to go the classic+ route where they add more content to classic which doesn't invalidate old content the way expansions have in the past, it would be great.
---
However unless classic is an unimaginable success, I can't see them allocating resources for new classic content
---
&gt;Nobody cares about your stupid opinion so you might as well just keep it to yourself.
---
I understand your concern. Im considering not play with the current state of layering. I just hope Blizzard pulls their head out of their ass at some point before launch.
---
Part of the reason the game is rewarding is BECAUSE it is slow. I'm not trying to be funny when I say the game brings out a sense of pride and accomplishment as you continue to play.
---
The russian post is straight out of braveheart.
---
I'm in the PvP beta realm on horde side and I've just been letting it run and uploading it as it finishes. Should show more evenly soon, hopefully.
---
shit gets real when you have to decide if spending the 1 silver to fly to SW is worth that over walking so you have money for training the skills you need
---
Gratz, most retarded post I read this month.
---
Yeah the game will only be garbage for the first two and most important months, no big deal.
---
I hope you are right about that, I have no access to the beta or stress test so I haven't had a chance to experience it live yet.
---
There is a workaround to that problem, to be honest.
---
You could have lvl 30+s all go into a “layer final” instead of layers 1,2,3,... that lvl 1-29 go in. And force them to stay there.
---
It would have the effect we are asking for without making layering zone specific.
---
It will not be removed within two weeks. That's just a corporate thing they said to assuage the outcry. And that is the problem. It is going to be around for months and, very possibly, in perpetuity. It's the kind of thing you have to loudly protest before it is implemented or live with for a long time. 
---
I'm hoping that we can convince them not to implement it.
---
There are YouTube playlists that do this pretty well now: https://youtu.be/jYkCL_j_INY

Priest, this will be my 5th 60 priest lol. 🤗
---
Ahh i understand now. Thank you for the explanation!
---
oh god. not Eu West
---
I think theres a difference between hardcore and a very long, slightly tedious experience..
---
Most people these days are accustomed to “instant gratification” whether you like it or not. Smartphones are really messing with our brain chemistry, its why so many children have what appears to be A.D.D.
---
I don’t think WoW Classic is hardcore, so much as its a game that will not hit the reward mechanisms most people desire in games. If all of the “rush” comes from say, looting an epic, what are the odds new players are going to stick around til then?
---
I think this post is trash , it's based on nothing and blizzard hasn't even mentioned an estimated amount of servers yet to my [knowledge.You](https://knowledge.You) have no idea how they are going to handle the big influx of players (sure layering) they might want to create tons of servers to minimize the amount of shards created so the system wont be easily abused.If you don't understand what i mean is hopping shards to get mats and chests.
---
I remember specifically this "are you willing to do post naxx content or tbc?" and the answer was "yes, we are open to the idea if the players want it".... I think some wires got crossed there as TBC is technically post naxx content. I personally do not think Blizzard has ANY plan to create new vanilla content. Hate me if you want, downvote me if you will, just my opinion
---
It's a good thing. Nobody wants to be on a realm with Italians (throwback to cata days anyone?) or God forbid, Russians! :p
---
Also just because being on a server with half the chat being something you don't understand sucks.
---
it took you an entire half an hour to hit lvl 2?  what an outrage.  yes, leveling in a heavily populated game takes time.  it could take longer.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Ah yes simple math Watson heuheuheu you take the 1 add the 5 and gravity. That's essentially what you just described. I hope you don't have a degree in mathematics. youve proved no point. Added no tangible facts, and have yet to come close to answering my question.
---
The raiding guilds that I've been in that were actually able to do things like Twin Emp and Naxx did not have a single meme spec player.  We had people that respec'ed to a meme spec to break up the monotony of tanking or healing, but no way in hell would we have a dedicated meme'r.  People barely had any tolerance for some of our best DPS Warriors never wanting to tank.  You're not getting a raid slot as a meme spec in most guilds.  Great way to have your healers and tanks gquit.
---
It’s probably better for us. The 10%. But not for the other 90% of players who we do depend on for this to be successful.
---
But none of that matters if layering makes it into the game like this and stays for 2+ weeks.
---
So why are u even here? I know it's kinda hard to grasp, but what people enjoy is "subjective".
---
Thanks a ton! 
---
DM me if you ever want to play sometime. I appreciate your help!
---
I did something like this with one of my alts and a friends account that asked me to level. 
---
I had my main account at level 60 with decent gear. I leveled the other 2 accounts to level 10, then I just multiboxed them with my 60 through dungeons constantly. Got them to 60 pretty quickly.
---
As for leveling together with drop quests and all, it'll be just as fast as it would be to do it solo when it comes to drop quests, things will just die quicker for the other kill x mobs.
---
if they're that impatient i actually don't care.
---
&gt; I've leveled all characters to max or near max.  
---
&gt; I don't understand how people can enjoy this. 
---
Yeah man, when I hate a game I play it constantly for months on end too. XD
---
What you request is indeed being tested, right now, on Stress Test Realm 3.  High server pop is being layered to heck and back.  Vastly more than Realm 15.  And it is no fun at all.
---
It's almost like different people like different things.  Nah you're right, it's a massive conspiracy based on self-delusion.

That enhancement shaman dps is going look mighty tempting when it’s 2am and you only need 3 to go

All fun and games until the Orcs start talking about invading the Trolls....

Yes I have. Most of my realms died on retail and I ended up having to reroll elsewhere. My comment is related to merges vs. layering. I'm totally fine with merging as a last resort, but that's *all* it should be: a last resort. Blizzard needs to do whatever it takes to ensure players feel a connection to the realm they play on. That's half the reason anyone's coming back to play Classic, right? They love that their reputation means something, that they'll see some of the same players over and over again, et cetera.
---
I agree with everyone here who says that layering isn't perfect. Obviously it's not; it needs some work. It's still a better choice/option than throwing up 100 servers only to have to merge half of them in a year because the population dipped down to embarrassing numbers. Blizz knows this: hence, layering. It's not an ideal solution for several reasons, but I'll be damned if anyone here has come up with something more effective that won't result in realm merging down the line.
---
Making the game faster doesn't make it more rewarding. Does Levelling through bfa feel rewarding for anyone?
---
 I think you're missing the whole point of the rpg aspect of wow.
---
If you are looking for something like an fps or a moba, then classic isn't for you.
---
I politely help every single person that asks questions ingame
---
I end up with a pretty big friends list that way, turns out people really like you when you're nice ingame!
---
Hey, thanks! DM me if you ever want to play sometime!
---
You’re def right. I didn’t know what layering was or that it was a thing until “LAYERING WILL DESTROY CLASSIC” posts started flooding the subreddits. 
---
But like I read about it and it seems like a perfectly valid tool to use to try and manage flooded starting zones.
---
&gt;But that’s kind of the point, is it? People choose to either compete with a lot of people, go elsewhere and quest in a ‘worse’ area or go grind mobs somewhere. It’s this sort of accommodate the player so they’re comfortable mentality that, 15 years later, got us this boring, casino-like game we call retail. Some layering, sure. Maybe first couple days of launch. But honestly let the consequences just be.
---
What about zones like Redridge? its a high 10 low 20 zone which covers the same leveling areas like Barrens.
---
Its not instant gratification to actually want to play the game and quest. 
---
Everyone hypes up how important the questing experience is in classic then wanna jump through hoops trying to tell people to just grind or get in line when it comes time to a hyped launch. 
---
Also what year is it? 98? ADD? Really?
---
Both are wonderful.  With the itemization I would lean towards lock.
---
They were in reign of chaos even before that, on the undead mission where you kill Uther there's a hidden Easter egg area that flashes a pic of pandas across the screen when you enter it. There's also an Easter egg area on a night elf mission where you can fight a giant pandaren
---
Anyone with a brain and an auctioneer addon can get that kind of money easily. The endgame of wow's economy is focused around consumables. A handful of nolifers "abusing" a limited number of layers (that will be pretty packed) for maybe a month just isn't going to have long-term effects. Go back to your safe space, script kiddie.
---
Okay, without looking it up, tapping into my college German classes... "Forest Leather Belt"? I'm guessing there's a more idiomatic translation.
---
I've been planning out a dungeon AoE group for some time, let me know what you think of this setup:
---
Prot warrior porcupine AoE tank: I'm hoping Ret Aura + Fire Shield + Blessing of Sanctuary + BS/DS spam + maybe oil of immolation will allow me to hold aggro on groups, can't test as I'm not in beta.
---
2x Frost Mage: Blizzard, CoC, Frost Nova, Arcane blast if anything is left. Blessing of Salvation to reduce threat in AoE as well as the frost talent.
---
MD/Ruin Warlock: Rain of fire/hellfire plus imp for fire shield + blood pact to help the warrior, plus soulstone for wipes. Blessing of Salvation if he's taking threat often, no -threat talent till MD very late though.
---
30/21 holy/prot paladin: Heals, blessing of salvation/sanctuary for AoE, blessing of kings on group otherwise.
---
What do ya'll think? Is this viable for efficient AoE farming dungeons?
---
As a BC starter. This was very confusing to me. I made an undead. And this didn’t make any sense.  But it DID get me reading the lore.
---
5-layer dip.
---
Or dare I say.... 
---
7-layer dip!
---
You’re going to start a “stop posting” inception
---
Curiosity about the game and asking questions is never a burden!
---
They were talking about completely different things. Hard no to additions to the Classic release. It is a recreation of Vanilla. Hard yes (unless Classic is a complete commercial failure) to further development down the road - you don't just stop developing a MMORPG with 200,00+ subscribers and watch them all stop playing over 12 months unless you're literally the dumbest developer in the world.
---
Ok buddy see you at launch
---
Play paladin you will meet a ton of new people along the way.  Most friends quit or loose interest and then your stuck with do I really reroll or try to have fun.
---
the classic trilogy is Warcraft 1, 2 and 3 and WoW + expansions are just shit.
---
Then go back to sharding and just do the starting zones then lmfao

If EU doesn't get language-specific servers, I doubt America will either. So it'll be English + Portuguese + Spanish in every server
---
Devilsaur leather is nice but 40 gold per hour doing mara is very consistant.
---
he's probably referring to the [boomer meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer), not the actual baby boomers
---
Yes, russian People already gather to play on eu Server.....
---
They can do it backwards, put people under 30 in a priority to go up layers.
---
So people over 30 will generally be in layer 1 with under 30 pushed up layers to filter congested zones.
---
Thats what people call the "ideal" but in reality I have been in raids with 3-4 druids. If I know a druid thats a better healer or DPS or tank that someone running with the "ideal class" Im taking the druid.
---
Thats cool man, I really appriciate it :)
---
The thought crossed my mind, but I didn't want to be the one to say it...lol. Sadly there's no way* to predict what servers will do well and which won't. We're all flipping coins, it seems.
---
*Streamer server(s) will do pretty well, population-wise. Asmongold will always have a cult following him around/rolling on his realm to say they share a realm with him. But if for any reason he quit, the server would probably instantly die, so even rolling on a streamer server isn't a guarantee. :')
---
Yup, it'll be unofficial language server time. Prepare to roll a char, take them to level 20 and then realise you're in the wrong place. Although the worst is when you're already 60 and the server then becomes the unofficial server for a different country.
---
Sure i can speak English, but in wow i don t want to. It s a no Go for me and some of my Friends too. Fuck this, it isnt any better than on private server
---
pretty spot on
---
They rarely have been top dps in pve and are there mostly for utility which most people would rather just play a mage for the dmg. I think there will be a decent amount played as warlocks. But alliance will definitely have fewer locks than horde simply because of undead. But every raid will want at least one or two so I don’t think it will be a problem

I consider myself to be softcore. I have bursts of time where I can game a lot, then I have days where I cant play at all. I'm experienced, but not in a rush. I'm even going to wait a week to let the starting zo es clear out so I can enjoy myself. That said, I like following guides so I can make the most of my time, and I think that's why 97% of people use them also.
---
Yeah but a healing priest with the buff will take your spot every time.
---
Lmao trash streamers
---
Thanks for sharing your view! I feel like there is an issue with layering where some people end up largely alone and others end up packed in like sardines. I guess I would prefer more aggressive layering the first day or two and see it lighten up after that.

Gnome warrior or gnome warlock.   Warrior was the class I played in vanilla, but I was undead then.

Nostalrius.  Blizzard shut down the most popular private server ever and in response  to that, almost 300,000 vanilla players SIGNED A PETITION encouraging  Blizzard to create a legitimate Classic option to World of Warcraft.  That petition found it’s way into the hands of one Mark Kern, a former  team lead for World of Warcraft in 2004 and has worked on all blizzard  IPs, who then delivered that petition to Mike Morhaime, then CEO and  cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment.
---
So  many people come into this subreddit and tell us “layering is here to  stay deal with it. Don’t like it don’t play it” but have no idea about  how Classic found its way into existence, nor understand the spirit of  Classic WoW.
---
We were loud enough about loot trading. We can be loud enough about layering.

I agree everyone should speak english but having servers specific for cucks who can't seem to speak english is better.

---
&gt; sucking in this moment.
---
big yikes reading comprehension
---
I'm glad people were being good. I'd say overall people were friendly last night--probably just having fun trolling in the chat. ;P We're all excited, after all!
---
Can't wait to check it out!
---
The tldr is that there is massive ways to abuse the system for resources or to avoid/abuse pvp
---
You do a lot of it in the later levels. Won’t be nearly as bad the first few levels.
---
I did the exact same thing, Europeans always underestimate how many NA people do shift work.

I consider myself to be pretty softcore. I have bursts of time where I can game a lot, then I have days or God forbid even an entire week where I cant play at all. I'm experienced, but not in a rush. I'm even going to wait a week to let the starting zo es clear out so I can enjoy myself. That said, I like following guides so I can make the most of my time, and I think that's why 97% of people use them also.
---
I wonder if they'll do another stress test to fiddle with the layering and mob spawns to see if they can strike something that will work well at release.
---
Not gonna lie, I'm going to try to start the second things are up, but you know how that usually goes...
---
Why? We finally get rid of them and they come crawling back? They are like a pest.
---
Thank you. I think I saw that in stormwind but I thought it was for shirts.
---
They genuinely don't think classic is gonna be that successful
---
Don't ask or what. The Germans tried to show us twice.
---
Of course it's official, check the blue posts.
---
&gt;Also think about trade chat. When you link items in WoW, it uses your client's language. So if you're looking for that sweet 4str 4stam leather belt, be sure to look out for "Cintura di Cuoio Silvano", "Ceinture sylvestre en cuir", "Waldledergürtel" and of course "Cinturón de cuero de bosque" respectively.
---
If you link it in chat, others will see it in their client's language on click.

she doesnt die, shes just a boss fight in BOD

Blizzard wtf
---
Mate he is talking about how retail went to shit.
---
yeah this is US only i think :(
---

---
That has nothing to do with batching at all.
---
It's the scrolling damage text clogging up.
---
If you watch the same clip on Venruki's stream all three swings happen at the exact same time.
---
For some reason Classic has bursts of damage like this displaying the numbers in a staggered way. This isn't the only scrolling text inconsistency with Vanilla since in the beta the numbers change size depending on your camera distance from the target being damaged. 
---
Both of these things should be reported as visual bugs.

I've condensed the entire OP based on his closing argument:
---
YOU'RE HAVING FUN WRONG!
---
But most of the streamers will be on the same server. Easy to avoid them.
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks!
---
Thanks, I appreciate it!
---
LMFAO - I was commenting on the difference between WoW's style of play compared to other modern games. It seems like your ADD-ridden brain failed to even read through the whole post, which just further pushes my point. 
---
Why don't you try to stop and think before you say stupid shit? All I was saying is its not hardcore, but it is very different from what most people will expect from a game in 2019.
---
I welcome all lads to US East, you guys and Australians are a real riot. My favorite gaming experiences comes from those two groups.
