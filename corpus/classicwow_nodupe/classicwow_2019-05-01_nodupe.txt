I have been unsubbed since about 3 weeks into WoD.

I know, I was referring to that myself in my original comment, I just mentioned that it also reminded me of the Toyota commercial üòÑ

Regular person: sharding might make sense at server launch to ensure a smooth experience for everyone, server stability, and to reduce the chaos of thousands of people competing for the same quests and mobs. Hopefully Blizzard plays it by ear and adjusts accordingly
---
You, an intellectual: But what if this thing that's an inherent part of World of Warcraft that nobody has ever complained about or suggested be changed?
---
You can natures swiftness GW?  LOL. In my entire WoW career I never even thought to try that.
---
switching stances does cause a GCD
---
I unsubbed because the game was too easy. I killed 4 bosses in the raid in normal mode as well as the first boss in heroic mode and I don't even have a guild... I stopped raiding because there was no challenge. This game has been cazualized too much.
---
These are already super well known. The recipes are really hard to get on every server because there's always people camping the NPCs to buy them.
---
Exactly the point of this video lol. Did you watch it ?
---
Now it does, in vanilla it did not.
---
Yeah, it works on the private servers I've tried at least. You'd think it would be an arcane spell - but nope, it actually counts.
---
No this is just a meme format from like 10 years ago
---
I have a beautiful wife, a good job, a house, and plenty of friends who always want to hang out and do some fun stuff... and I secretly crave this guy‚Äôs life üòÑ
---
There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be able to get my WoW fill with the way my life is currently. But that‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll enjoy every ounce of the game casually as well
---
Reading comprehension skills severely lacking lol.
---
Hahaha.
---
That‚Äôs amazing I will have to do that in a Raid with spell calling mods just to piss off my raid leader &gt;__&lt;
---
‚ÄúDid you just burn Nat Swift on Ghost Wolf!?‚Äù

If you don't hear the air horn during a symphony then what words would help? It's there, I can hear it, and it's painful. Words can't convince somebody to experience a sensation. Blizzard might even have been wise to do what they did, considering the game is still alive. 
---
Most of the anthropomorphized stuff that had come before had mythological precedence so it was easy enough to accept. Tauren = Mintotaur, Centaurs = Centaurs, Worgen = Werewolves. Murlocs and gnolls weren't supposed to be wise and ancient and, played for laughs, worked as set dressing. Maybe the furbolg were a bit ridiculous but they were easily avoidable. 
---
Pandas came out of nowhere. Yeah, pay close attention to WC3 and apparently there's one in there whose presence I had to verify because I have no memory of him. But that was a funny joke. This was an \*expansion\* that you had to live in, filled with these things. Panda shaped, panda-colored pandas with goofy chinese accents to whom ancient wisdom and great prowess is ascribed. It's just insane. I've never really felt like any property I've been involved with jumped the shark like WoW did with that expansion. I'd quit within three months for the final time and have never felt compelled to return because now, when I think of retail WoW, I remember being blasted in the face with air horns.

Can you explain what mob scaling means? Are monsters in every zone all the same level as you?

I bought the collectors edition of BFA.  I told myself I am going to leave it next to my desk and if I can go a few days without it I am done.  Ended up selling it but now I think I might be back for classic.
---
I'm the opposite, I don't even play but I resubbed just in case its a precondition to a beta invite.
---
No I think upgraded wolf looks cool one of my last two points would go into reduced wolf I think
---
I'm going to be sitting on the beach with my VR headset

What kind of BGs are you playing where rogues get freedom?
---
Raises hand
---
Since mid-Cata. Who the hell plays retail?
---
&gt; Chinese whispers
---
Is that a racist version of the game 'telephone?'
---
Should 100% get your mount instead of buying anything else. The faster you make it to 60, the faster you can focus on all these things and do them even more efficiently with all the flight paths and mount speed you will have.
---
I've just been faint gold for tokens for last couple months. My sub runs out I'll cash in a couple tokens once classic comes out.
---
LF4M, heals and leather/cloth DPS for X
---
With this one trick you will literally never have to run with a Ret pally, as long as you have a tanking set.
---
Don‚Äôt have the time anymore or I would :(
---
I saw that they were gonna fuck around with time travel and alternate universes as an entire theme of an expansion and stopped there.
---
Bit of a pity since I probably would have enjoyed Legion, but WoD just looked SO bad.
---
Alright, now you‚Äôre talking about a completely different thing. The topic was regarding how soon a guild could down ragnaros. What you‚Äôre talking about is a lifestyle. Going hard for 2 weeks to achieve a single goal isn‚Äôt a lifestyle, it‚Äôs a small blip with regard to how a person might manage their life. I can personally tell you as a student at uni with summer vacation that I‚Äôll be playing relentlessly and with as much preparation as possible to avoid the obvious harmful side effects. Anyone that you described however definitely needs some help.
---
Im not speedrunning to 60 so its not really that big of a deal. I already know what im gonna farm on my way to 60. I do ALOT of grinding. So much so i usually have enough gold fo4 all my BOE pre raid bis, and halfway or more to my epic mount.
---
If you grind heavy in the early levels youl have zero issues with gold
---
I was a little shit noob playing a human male fury warrior called Nighthorror on Burning Blade/Grim Batol and my first guild-raid was with ¬´Dillchips¬ª or something wich I think was swedish.
---
Didn‚Äôt Cata end in like 2013 or so though?
---
You should understand that the feeling of old players is that Activision coopted World of Warcraft as a game and perverted it into what it is today. There is an issue with an established product fundamentally changing into something else. Luckily this is alleviated with Classic coming back, but don't come in on a high horse pretending all opinions are equally valid while passing off retails problems as little "flaws". 
---
There's a reason the game is sitting around 1.7- 2.2 million active subs since October and it's depressing because I love this game like every one else.
---
Just say it. Alliance gets paladins.
---
This. Also the pacing allows you to actually appreciate the game and the world around you.
---
Also the feeling of a continuous world cannot be understated.
---
I always thought of it more as a qol situational ability. Occasionally I need to be invisible and stealth is still down.
---
Being single means I‚Äôm ready to mingle in MC.
---
Current state of the game is actually really fun and there is plenty to do. To each their own.
---
I met my current boyfriend on WoW, didn't actively seek one though, just kinda happened, finding a girlfriend is probably less likely I'd imagine, being gay has its benefits

My favorite for male UD is bald with the tail in the back

 * Hunters are the most capable but require you to know what you're doing and put some effort in.

 * Warlock fear kiting elites is brain dead easy but are more restricted since many types of mobs cannot be feared.
---
Having my kid is finally paying off
---
This is going to happen allot, Thank you to all the parents that didn't smack their kids that were screaming MINE!!!!
---
Honestly this sub will suck until release. Yes, occasionally you get a solid post like OP‚Äôs or a original new meme, but most of it is just recycled garbage and overly sensitive keyboard warriors. Love the game, not the state of this sub.
---
Isn‚Äôt r/ihavesex supposed to be for people bragging about simply getting laid, and not somebody joking about not getting it?
---
&gt; vanilla is the one true God
---
At no point did I this. Nice biases.
---
&gt; why should any game not be like anything
---
Because genres of anything have some core features. Retail feels like a single player game, with some small multiplayer features. Tell me, what does the MM in MMO stand for? This isnt "rose by any other name" situation. If I have a third person base building game with no weapons, it's not an FPS no matter what you want to say. That's not how this works. That's not how any of it works.
---
I started with the European beta in 2005, reached rank 13 in PvP, played in a top25 guild EU and quit exactly one week after the release of WOTLK. I can't wait for wow classic and reactivate my subscription :)
---
Thats cool that yesmaster was playing back in Vanilla. Haha.. Nice vid mate.
---
Thank you for putting it so eloquently. Well said.
---
Niuridoom, 55 dwarf hunter, &lt;The Commonwealth&gt;, Durotan US PVE

I was the reason they called them huntards.
---
For real I don‚Äôt get get the elitism. Some classes and specs do less damage but they also bring utility and buffs. People are gonna be happy that you show up regularly regardless if you‚Äôre a fury warrior or an oomkin
---
Remember, heroic used to be normal. The encounters are designed for mythic and there is nothing casual about that. It takes a lot of dedication needed and you can't judge the raiding Scene with only pugged 1 heroic boss imo
---
Warcraft 2 had flying machines. But I can see why it would be far fetched for something as advanced as motorcycles to exist 22 lore years later.
---
Play a class that does. You know... something you don‚Äôt want to do to help the group.
---
Gnome Mage named Gnommywizzo
---
Definitely gonna sub, you post some quality info

Holy Paladins can blessing of freedom on the tank. You don't need a ret for that.
---
Autistic people can't detect sarcasm.
---
Smart. I'm going to call my character Breivik, Since he died on Ut√∏ya after getting shot by Breivik.
---
Fuck.. I wish I would have made it that far. That raid looked excellent. I quit when they released that flaming pile of shit Trial of the Crusader.
---
I did 119-120 in about 40 minutes last night on a drood - but I was pushing hard with every XP buff I could get my hands on.
---
I actually loved that they brought Naxx back since I'd never gotten to it during Vanilla, but I really wish they'd made it harder. I remember clearing the 10-man version of it the same week of launch. At least I think that's when it was. Either way it was far too easy. But, I was really into pvp during TBC and Wrath, and actually got my only Gladiator during S6, so even when the pve content wasn't great, I was focused on pvp where I was having a lot of fun. 
---
But I've gotten away from pvp over the years, so if they ever do follow Classic with new TBC and Wrath servers, I really hope they increase the difficulty of the pve in wrath.
---
Yeah I'll make sure to let my Priest/Druid healer know.
---
Is this post just OP asking others to validate his position?
---
It's time to break the law, no one will ever found out. Unless they do.
---
Sadly it will. It will have those 1%'s or people that have no respect or manners and it will cause issues. I know that my Ignore list will probably be Maxed by the time I hit 60
---
You don't have separate servers anymore with enclosed communities. The social aspect is completely gone.
---
From a min/max stand point for PvE human is the way to go. So I see where you're coming from because it frees you up to get brutality blade. It comes down to what you're going to spend more time doing. There's two right answers for rogues as far as alliance goes.. and now I haven't helped with that decision in the slightest lol. GL
---
Ive been having the "what the fuck do I play" lately. And GOD DAMN I wish I could just log in to vanilla and grind. Because I know when Vanilla is out I wont have this kind of downtime that I do right now.
---
I dont want new quests added to tie up loose ends but. Theres a quest in the south west of swamp of sorrows that requires talking to a blood elf in a cave. It just kind of ends suddenly after you pledge your allegiance to his cause or something like that. Does that end somewhere else?
---
grabeagh i think was my dwarf hunter name lvl 48 i dont even remember my server or my dear friends in game name but he was a gnome rogue. i left him in hinterlands forever when bc hit and rerolled horde as a tauren druid and never looked back. but yes i was a huntard im sure but i still killed lots of people in pvp sadly.
---
Logic checks out. Bald=more int
---
I loved Dramaspear so much, I hope we get a Darkspear mountain time classic server.
---
That dude purportedly played on my server.  I remember when this interview came out, the whole server forums were ablaze for weeks.
---
Solid bait post, get everyone in an uproar! Hahaha
---
And if you get ganked, your toon is deleted.
---
Yeah thats the plan for my group. I know one of my friends is going to destroy us when it comes to leveling/gearing. But hoping to spend most of the time together in discrord chatting it up and feeling nostalgic.
---
Plus gaming laptops are honestly spectacular now, and really not THAT much more expensive for the benefits they give you. This isn't 2009 anymore.
---
He's the most toxic person I've ever played with
---
It would be like if they let Endgame have its theatrical run then they ended it and took it off the shelves, then released it over a decade later to the public.
---
In the meantime people could watch knock offs, but never quite the real thing
---
All this with 8 debuff slots right?  Still apples to oranges for DPS IMO.
---
For healing, I always remember paladin &gt; priest for raid healing as they were mostly topping off with faster heals than priests.  This dynamic changes in later patches due to T2+ and talent changes.  I don't ever remember a paladin being amazing for throughput on a tank, maybe I'm not remembering correctly though.
---
I've re-subbed recently, just for casual play until Classic comes out. It's alright but I can see why people are hating on it - I'm really just playing super casual; bit of LFG/LFR, playing the AH, hoarding mounts etc and it's alright. But even in LFR/LFG I'm really noticing how simple and mindless the rotations have become, every fight I just pop CD's and spam 2 spells until I get proc.
---
Jesus the anti retail circlejerk is actually insane. You don't magically get transported to a zeppelin once you hit 60 and have to relearn your spells - you used a level boost if that happened and the game is making sure you at least know the basics of your class before throwing you out into the game world. But hey who cares about being factually right in this subreddit anyway if it's about retail, instead we can just jack off some more
---
WoW is on the long tail pretty much all over. I have a feeling there will be a spike of subs for Classic but that will drain away after the content is all unlocked and cleared for a while. If they ever progress to TBC the same thing will happen with that. The spikes will get lower and lower until its not worth it any more.  
---
I have a feeling WoW won't be running by the end of 2025 at the latest. At least, not on Blizzard servers.
---
NA PVP realm horde guild looking for players.
---
Core that we have now are all private server vets and looking for anyone and everyone who wants to raid!

Msg me if you got any questions :)

Staghelm was a hero of Azeroth before he lost his son in a really brutal and shitty way. Iirc, a Qiraji General brought out his beaten and tortured son to the front lines, in front of Fandral and the rest of the Night Elf army, and mocked him before literally tearing his body in half.

Looks like the snow of Winterspring is melting and the weeds are pushing through.

So why have a level boost anyway then?
---
Of course it'll suck up your data quicker than just playing a game or browsing the web, it takes up way less bandwidth than downloading all the files needed to play it. By the time they're finished stripping the client down to what it's supposed to be, it'll probably be a little over the original file size. Original file size is like 5.50gb. I would guess it'll be in the neighborhood of 6.50 or 7.50. Although with current tech a lot of games are able to be compressed down even further so they might be able to get it below the original file size. Won't know for sure how big it'll be until release.
---
It's been 12 years. I've gone back every few years to try the starter addiction, just to see what's changed, and I really just wish I could go back to an older edition.
---
only just realised he said burning blade during the interview.. what a legend
---
Its been all downhill since. well, raids and graphics have improved somewhat. 
---
but i wish i had just walked away after the lich king. i've played every expansion for at least 3 months each, and aside from the tail end of Mists of Pandaria and the tail end of The Burning Legion... its been mostly trash.

Wow. So brave

&lt;TRIBE&gt; - NA [H] EST PVP 
---
 
---
Introduction
---
Greetings Traveler! &lt;Tribe&gt; is a mature Horde, PVE Raiding Guild that is focused to clear all content within a reasonable timeframe. The &lt;TRIBE&gt; Guild has its origin back in 2005 when it first formed on the European Realm &lt;Un‚Äôgoro&gt;, back then the Guild had many server firsts but resolved after the end of TBC. At this point of Recruitment we are trying to build our Core and get a solid bunch of people together, to get things rolling.
---
Member Expectations
---
‚Ä¢    Common sense and casual conversation tone.
---
‚Ä¢    If you must think about something mean, just don‚Äôt say it at all.
---
‚Ä¢    The time we spend Raiding, we want to take it serious so please don‚Äôt waste anyone‚Äôs time.
---
‚Ä¢    No Drama or Politics ‚Äì please keep your personal drama to yourself, the Guild chat is not your personal Dr. Phil show. If it relates to a Member please Contact your Guild Officer.
---
‚Ä¢    Toxic, Spiteful and Racist behavior will not be tolerated, the culprits will be removed.
---
What we are currently looking for classes/roles:
---
‚Ä¢    Druid (All)
---
‚Ä¢    Hunter (All)
---
‚Ä¢    Mage (All)
---
‚Ä¢    Shaman (Heal)
---
‚Ä¢    Priest (All)
---
‚Ä¢    Rogue (All)
---
‚Ä¢    Warlock (All)
---
‚Ä¢    Warrior (All)
---
Raid Schedule ‚Äì Early Bird Raid times
---
The Schedule will be Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. We will not Raid during the Weekends. Raid Hours for the Raid will be 7:00 PM Eastern till 10:30 PM Eastern. This should be enough time to clear all the Raid content.
---
Guild Leadership team has seen all Content in Classic up to Naxxramas which we never had the pleasure to clear.
---
Loot Distribution
---
We believe that an Attendance based system with Loot Council is the strongest and fairest Solution (DKPish). We will let Members roll on loot via /rnd and will only intervene if the Item is not suited for the Class. There will also be standard set of items, that will obviously be managed by the LC as Thunderfury. 
---

So why are you making a video about it if it's already well known, "lol" ?
---
Passion, low levels of burnout, same difference
---
The shield is mostly for trying to survive 5mans. There's a lot of bad tanks out there that struggle with threat and having a shield can and will save your life especially since so much healing gear is cloth and leather.
---
So, pay to win it is, then
---
Imagine playing Diablo in the WoW game. There you have it.
---
I love motorcycles. Just bought myself a new Shadow this year and I've been riding it all over the place (weather permitting, which it hasn't lately &gt;.&lt; ). Best $8k I ever spent.
---
Similar to most of TBC, I absolutely loved the mechanohog when I first saw it. That alone almost got me to resub so I could get a giant steampunk motorcycle for my tauren.
---
In hindsight, though... much as I love my bike, and much as part of me still loves the idea of a giant hog built to fit a giant cow man, it was just one more step down the path of turning WoW into the kitchen sink MMO that tries to be everything to everyone. The same path that eventually led to in-game selfie sticks.
---
That's not a world (of Warcraft) I'm interested in living in (so to speak).
---
I'm totally with you here. Quit end of TBC because got burnt out, came back few years later to see friends, saw motorcycles and all the ~~shiny stupid things~~ QoL improvements and unsubbed for good. Now I read there are selfie sticks in the game like what the actual fuck?!!! I can only say I'm glad I wasn't part of this transformation from a former beauty to some ugly shit.
---
Me!
---
I've been unsubbed since cata, so yes lol
---
When you have monster and redbull who TF would drink rockstar? Worst energy drink I‚Äôve ever tasted.
---
As others have mentioned, the only difference between pet families in 1.12 will be attack speed. Slower attack speeds will equate to larger hits, higher attack speeds will equate to smaller hits.
---
In general, your aim should be the acquisition of the highest attack speed you can find within a pet family, in PvP this will translate to bigger pushback against casters and in PvE this will translate into more chances to proc Frenzy of you're spec'd for it.
---
yeah this isn't everquest while classic wow is slower then modern wow it was marketed as the casual MMO and doesn't take anywhere near the amount of time op thinks lol.
---
Wait what
---
If anything, even more confusing, yet technically correct.
---
The best kind of correct.
---
It‚Äôs not a circle jerk. It‚Äôs a legitimate position when they‚Äôve lost 75 percent of their player base.
---
Game has been trash since TBC
---
Get off my lawn
---
Yep. I‚Äôm forseeing my main play time from 4:30am -6-7am on Saturday and Sunday depending how long the kid sleeps
---
This guy fucks
---
So much this, I quit once I realized pretty much every class I played I could essentially bind 2 skills to mouse wheel up and down and just roll the wheel all day and hit 1 maybe 2 other keys for procs and the occasional cool down.
---
I'd say you're welcome to our spare, then, but I suspect that would result in us getting some of your humidity in exchange.
---
Not for all the kodos in Mulgore.
---
Yeah I really hope that's how it stays. It's one of my favorite aspects of playing a Vanilla hunter. I can remember camping for multiple days trying to tame Brokentooth. It led to all sorts of fun gank attempts and general tomfoolery. 
---
Same with Humar. I can remember waiting for days for him to spawn only to have a shadownelded NE hunter gank me as I tried to tame him. Ran back from graveyard and the NE had already tamed it.
---
I miss those days.
---
Is that the green globe on the tv stand? What‚Äôs a game sphere
---
Where is the cheetohs puffs bag?
---
Random generator name
---
Well you kinda can on pserv
---
because it‚Äôs not well known to everyone - like me
---
All you have to do is do what I did, when people invite you out just say no, then close the blinds and turn your speakers up and log into world of warcraft.
---
They should make WoW 2 with the Vanilla world and add things like this.  There are enough little goblin camps scattered around the world to make the places you go to kill goblins / quest as quest hubs for a goblin race that is their own faction.
---
IMO: Naga wouldn't get mounts.  They wouldn't move at mount speed or anything crazy.  Maybe they'd swim fast but trekking deep inland would be a hard task for them.
---
I wouldn't make them Alliance or Horde.  Similar to the goblins above, I'd just turn the spots in the game where Naga hang out as Naga quest hubs / towns.  
---
Let them wear double the neck pieces instead of shoes.  There are caster classes, so priest and mage type stuff would work.  Warriors and hunters, with only watery pets.
---
Tram
---
OhhHhh you're so edgy
---
I like the timeless cartoonesque vanilla graphics. No need to put ultra 4k HD everywhere
---
Yes you can dps as a shaman in MC for sure. MC is super easy. ZG and BWL you can do this as well.
---
Don't listen to these people man. Fulfill your dreams of being an epic dps shaman in Molten Core!
---
Ah, the great GPA Fall of '04... History really does repeat itself, it would seem.
---
OhhHhh you're so edgy. How long did it take you to think of that one-liner!!1?
---
Now I just need to get my wife into yoga and convince the in laws to watch the kid all week.
---
one of my favourite quotes during this interview;

"I am pathetic.. when it comes to world of warcraft, I am a pathetic nerd."
---
Damn. relatable

---
Can confirm, here is a video from 2006 of a priest doing exactly this. My only issues with this video are, it's too dark, and it's speed up so it's hard to judge the total time for the run, and how fast the elite mob packs are moving
---
Unsubbed after MoP, came back for a bit of Legion after the hype, got disgusted by the AP/AK game and then unsubbed since.
---
Looking forward to the things that made me fall in love with WoW again.
---
I haven‚Äôt been subbed since 2008... I have two prepaid cards waiting
---
Robe of the Archmage is very good, and worth going tailoring alone. You can drop it after crafting. If you plan on doing a lot of world pvp then mining or herbalism is the way to go along with engineer
---
...ELWYNN FORREEESSSST, MOUNTAIN MAMA!!!!!
---
This is why I‚Äôll be rolling on my mount at 40 :sunglassesemoji:
---
Once DM comes out, DME Jump runs make more money, and cna be 2-3 manned depending on gear of both players.
---
&gt; There's a reason the game is sitting around 1.7- 2.2 million active subs
---
Only morons try to act like they stuff they cant. Congratulations, you are blocked
---
lol I just did this for reasons unrelated to vanilla wow. I'm going to do my best to get a job before vanilla drops though...I kind of want to have a life now and I can't do both.
---
I'd suggest each level at your own pace and a couple weeks after the game is out each make an alt and level that alt as a group. It won't be efficient at all but it would deffently be fun.
---
That‚Äôs why you have the macro to reply with prices or to shove it bound to your mouse clicks.
---
I‚Äôm still subscribed. I still enjoy retail. I‚Äôll be moving over to classic but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big crime to find enjoyment out of playing with your guild/mates in retail (not saying anyone is directly saying it is bad to still enjoy retail but sometimes people find it a little hard you could enjoy or even play both)
---
I do not disagree that the game has turned worse over time, else I wouldn't even be here. But straight up circlejerking over made up stories is sad, do you not think so?
---
You've never heard of the Okama Gamesphere?
---
The feeling of not knowing doesn't mean much on the biggest/best mmo of all time. When a game is that big, that "classic", it's fun to play regardless of whether you've already done it.
---
Luckily:  
---
You: Hey Mom can we get World of Warcraft Classic
---
Mom: You already have World of Wacraft at home
---
At Home: *installing WoW Classic due to shared sub*
---
&gt; That's not how any of it works.
---
Perfect description of your post. I have no intentions discussing with someone who is immune to logic. You are blocked. Good day sir
---
There is no way Classic gets 2 mil players (and thats if we really lowball retail numbers)
---
I want to say it was tearing him to pieces rather than simply in half, but semantics.
---
I'm actually familiar with that bit of lore. It does provide some justification for his being a dick, I'll grant, but it does nothing to detract from the fact he's still a dick.
---
What's more, he's an elf. Elves are all dicks anyway. Dude had to *really* go above and beyond to establish himself as the dick of the dicks.
---
Yeah I resubbed to try out WoD (quit about 2/3 way through cata) and was overwhelmed with all of the new stuff. There wasn‚Äôt really much introduction to any of it either just kind of dropped you into a totally foreign game with a ton of new systems and features that were never explained. Played for about 3 hours before uninstalling lol
---
I got 1g for ports in vanilla all day.
---
Blader 60 Night Elf Druid on Thunderhorn
---
as for weapon enchants i assume it depends on what level you are no? Like if you just got Frostbrand rank 4 and haven't got a new rockbiter in 10 levels i would have to think frostbrand would be more efficient but i haven't actually crunched the numbers. I usually just use WF because it's fun lol

If you're looking for something that offers serious performance for a reasonable price, may I recommend:  [https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834316435](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834316435)
---
My SO is duo leveling with me. Win win.
---
Exactly the info I was looking for! ty so much!
---
if you can stay in range for 20 seconds you get all your mana back, and you should be dropping your totems then pulling multiple mobs back towards your totems to maximize your mana efficiency. I use mana spring all the time
---
That family was just really cursed. His son gets ripped apart, his mate dies from giving birth, his granddaughter gets killed by Orcs. It sucks. But yea, Elves are dicks, but I love em!
---
You'll want tailoring once ZG comes out for the Bloodvine set. While the Bloodvine items are BoE (another tailor can craft them for you), the set bonus (2% crit) requires you to *be* a 300 tailor. Mages typically replace Bloodvine before Warlocks, since Mages can acquire some +hit through talents, but you'll still likely wear the items for all of phase 4. Once you replace Bloodvine, feel free to drop tailoring.
---
Engineering is a solid choice for both PvE and PvP. If you're thinking about joining a hardcore guild, they will certainly require it for PvE.
---
As far as what you take while leveling, assuming you'll be switching to Tailoring/Eng at 60, you can run Skinning/Mining. Skinning is just there to help fund your 40 mount, can drop it for one of your two main profs after you have your mount. Mining will help accelerate your Eng if you mail all of what you mine to a bank alt.
---
So if you really wanna min/max it...
---
1. Skin/min while leveling
---
2. Once 40 mount acquired, drop skin for Eng
---
3. Min/eng until ZG patch (keeping min this long has other benefits...arcane crystals anyone?)
---
4. Drop min for tailoring and power level tailoring
---
5. Utilize bloodvine set bonus
---
6. Once bloodvine is replaced, drop tailoring for...whatever you want
---
Of course, ignore all of this if you don't care about min/max or have interest in some other prof.
---
Wasn‚Äôt bait I was legit curious. I have a group of buddies that have been talking nonstop about classic and I really didn‚Äôt get the hype. Especially since they‚Äôve played about every big name vanilla private server that‚Äôs been out. Guess there‚Äôs only one way to find out for myself
---
Building onto that idea, there's too much stuff, mainly too much stuff on my internal list of stuff available to complete as somebody who found fun and being a completionist. I have already completed many of these things so this multi expansion list, tackling it again just all the fun leaves me. Likewise, you get to maximum level and you have many choices of where you can go to find gear. Many ways of powering up. So much so that many people feel compelled to do everything, and they instantly get daunted or bored because they have that list of things to do as soon as they hit maximum level.
---
Having fewer ways to get gear at maximum level makes the gear that you do a choir all the more meaningful, at least if you are able to revert your brain in order to appreciate the kind of effort to reward formula vanilla had. Hit level 120 and play for four hours, see how many upgrades you get. Hit level 60 and play for 4 hours, bet you you only get a small fraction of those upgrades, if not everybody will be able to find meaning in that kind of effort to reward system. I like to think I will.
---
thanks for le gold le kind gentlestranger (or gentleladystranger ;))
---
How good or bad would a build be where you go illumination for holy, then all the way to eye for an eye in ret and get kings from prot? 
---
Should i just abandon that and go for holy reck after all, even if /sit doesn't work in classic.
---
I know I was kidding, but it was great how fast everyone defended it. I hope you enjoy it and it lives up to the hype.
---
Same same
---
Right? My phone has been blowing up all day at work and I‚Äôm sitting here like geez guess the hype is real lol
---
One of the great failures of modern WoW is Blizzard's addiction to replacing social dynamics with programmed systems.  
---
To find a group, you speak and use human language. Replaced by a system.  
---
To progress in quests, you shared information either in game or online, and others contributed as well until more refined information allowed players to 'work together' to finish quests. Replaced by a system.
---
Seriously, if they aren't going to be there it means they have nothing to show there. They're not ready to show off whatever expansion comes after BFA and they are not going to merely show the upcoming BFA patch at a convention, and they are not going to show wow classic because we all know what to expect with Wow classic and that is also different from a new expansion. I like your logic, seems likely.
---
Ill say it, wow died when metzen left.
---
I hear what you're saying but the key difference for me is that TB said some horrible things while Cosby DID *some* horrible things. It's not clear to me that the conversations TB had were one-sided, as in some back and forth was probably happening to get to that point.
---
But yeah, when you systemically rape a dozen people that's basically a game over. 
---
I'd imagine that TB felt a wave of humility the second he realized the sentence he had been given.
---
You take the good with the bad the bad with the good. Person X does/says 10 good things that contributes to society in some way, does 1-2 bad things. You don't discard the entire being.
---
Haha I haven‚Äôt been subbed since 2009.
---
Paladin can tank dungeon. We got a comedian over here, almost fell off the couch reading that one
---
Guess I'll be the dense guy...don't really get this line of thought. If those extrovert social activities are more your thing, you're not being forced to stay home and play games. It's like people make the choice to stay home then go "ohhh man I wasted my whole summer playing WoW"...then why the hell didn't you go out and party all summer. Games are a waste of time to you, yet you willingly chose to play them and proceed to complain about how you regret it.

you make suddenly picking up a healing role for the first time out to be some easy thing they totally could do but just won't; it's not. i love to heal, but the role has a great deal of responsibility and requires a lot of focus. it's intimidating as fuck to get into and can still be tough to perform. and they might not even have a healing set of gear. it's not that simple and someone shouldn't be forced to play a stressful role just so you can save like 10 extra minutes looking for a healer

***Heralds of Norgannon***
---
**US-PST | Tues/Thurs Raids | PvE | Alliance**
---
https://norgannon.enjin.com/
---
&lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; was created as a home for Players that are interested in WoW Classic but who can't afford to be online 24/7 or grind as hard as they once could. We are made by adults, for adults, as a harbor for those who maybe only play a few hours a day, or even less, because of professional, family, or other commitments. But where is it written that those who are busy can't also partake in some fun?
---
To be blunt, if you're someone who wants to grind hard, get right to endgame content, and start smashing it than &lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; probably isn't for you. While we are a PvE Focused Guild we will not be rushing anything because WoW Classic is about the journey, not the destination. In addition there is a fixed amount of content that the game will deliver and we're in no hurry to exhaust it.
---
Besides being a PvE home for the busy and time-constrained, we also realize that WoW Classic has the potential to get boring, if you take the game at face value. Once you hit 60 the game shrinks quite a bit and by the time you start Raiding it gets smaller still. To that end we plan to be very active with our own content such as contests, individual and group challenges, and other forms of emergent content. This will also serve as a way to create and maintain social ties within the Guild, it's important that &lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; feels like a home, not just a roster of raid spots.
---
In a nutshell we are aiming to be a Guild that not only sticks around through the initial rush of the game but thrives by providing a steady supply of things to do and people to have fun with while also respecting your time. How does that sound?
---
Raid Times
---
Tuesday | 7PM-10PM PST
---
Thursday | 7PM-10PM PST
---
OPTIONAL Raid - Wednesday | 7PM-10PM PST
---
The primary Raid nights will be Tuesday and Thursday, we are running low times because Vanilla Raids don't require the same amount of pulls/time as current Raids do. This also works with our focus on respecting the time of our Members, why ask for more than what's needed?
---
Optional Raids will revolve around either farm content, 20 Man Raids, or a mixture of both. These will be for Alts, newcomers, casual Members, and so on.
---
I'm going to stress that there will be no hard grinding or "pushing". All WoW Classic Raids have been cleared continuously from when they were live until now so strategies and so on are also well known. Our focus is on using Raids as fun, not the end all be all in the game. That said Raids will still be taken seriously and all Raid Members will be expected to pull their weight and contribute to the Guild efforts.
---
When I hear things about retail WoW it is with the detached amazement of someone describing how much the city I grew up in has changed.
---
This is why I refuse to refer to WoW's current (happy) users as "casuals". They aren't casuals. They demand shit to change every goddamn month. Casuals don't want that great piece they got the other day to become obsolete in one month.
---
Nagas please
---
Using slow fall for something OTHER than accidentally dismounting or to get down from some tall place to a small place when I can‚Äôt yet use my flying mount.
---
DHK‚Äôs were not initially in Vanilla... so it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily break #nochanges if they decide not to add them.
---
Definitely neither. I'll be farming herbs to definitely not make into potions and use for raids and/or sell.
---
I respect your opinion man, but for me "lore and gameplay" are huge parts of it. That's just my opinion. 
---
Lore especially, like they made soooo many decisions that ruined the experience for me in TBC. I hated everything to do with the draenai and their spaceship. The Naaru also were just the stupidest things I've ever seen. Totally one dimensional. 
---
I'll grant you that WoTLK was the beginning of the end of WoW as a great game, but it also delivered so many amazing experiences leveling through Northrend. The Wrath Gate is still one of my all time favorite moments in gaming since I just did not expect it at all.   
---
Also... And I recognize I'm going to be in an extreme minority here, but I kinda enjoyed dual spec too. It was nice to be able to heal raids or switch to feral for grinding. I think you could make an argument that it should have been more expensive than it was (although it did still feel like an achievement when you unlocked it), but it was nice. (Note: That's not to say that they should have dual spec in classic. They shouldn't. But it was nice within the context of WoTLK). 
---
Also Inscription and glyphs were WAY more fun and felt more like Classic than gemcrafting and sockets.
---
Also the Death Knight intro was fantastic and actually made sense. 
---
Lore-wise in TBC it's like "guess what, if you're horde then all of the characters you've been looking forward to seeing since WC2 or WC3 are now evil, go kill them!" and it wasn't much better for the alliance. 
---
There was one very notable exception to this, which was that Blood Elf quest where you return Sylvanas' necklace to her and she sings the Lament of the Highborn. That was some serious chills and I absolutely loved that. So I don't want to take away from that one moment of greatness.   
---
With all of that said however, different strokes for different folks. I can respect that a lot of people prefer TBC to WoTLK. But for me, WoTLK is the high water mark of WoW.
---
Ha! Solid point.
---
Didn't step foot in duskwood until 29, but yeah that guy.
---
&gt; the game is making sure you at least know the basics of your class before throwing you out into the game world.
---
But that's the central issue, isn't it? _Why_ is the game making sure that you know those basics? 
---
Shouldn't it be up to you to explore things yourself, organically? Rather than being shoved onto some conveyer belt of forced training without any choice in the matter, and for no apparent reason?
---
Giving players room to explore things (even including their own spellbook) at their own pace and in whatever order they choose because they become curious and actually _want_ to do so is critically different from shoving it down their throats and having them press buttons they don't have any interest in because they just want to escape the cutscene.
---
Where did you get that early raptor? Sounds like a story
---
It's doable, in legion before leveling got nerfed i got very bored and leveled a few classes 1-110. Firsf one took around 52h, fastest was 24.5h
---
Don‚Äôt need to preorder when you still have the cd roms in your desk from 2004.
---
I mean I hate circlejerks as much as the next guy but here I think it‚Äôs warranted. They massacred the game.
---
Relax? Filthy casual!! Haha jk broski
---
Oh certainly, that is very much true. There are many good Americans, do not misunderstand me on that, as being from a country does not taint any one person. On the contrary, there are a number of influencers etc that i respect and some great personal friends ive made over the years from gaming and travelling that are American. I am judging the country as a whole, not as it appears in any one person.  
---
''Pretty flawed'', well yes if you'd like to put it mildly. Add to that this attitude that you are showing yourself that thats not such a big deal, and there you go. Education is the backbone of a countries future, that is obvious to anyone who has any. To have such a lax approach to it, to just accept that it is always followed by mountains of debt.. that is not just foolish my friend, it is downright dangerous. You live in a democracy, so have the self respect to cultivate a good populace.I realize you hardly consciously choose for things to be so shitty across the board for you guys, but imo they would not be if your attitudes would wake up - you guys have some of the shittiest circumstances on the planet in a lot of regards, looking like a 3rd world country in many aspects.   
---
You certainly have plenty of pride, but it doesn't seem to reach matters of actual importance. I frankly don't understand how the state of things do not prompt you into all out protest. It is not some hate thing, i am looking at things such as i hear them from Americans themselves and as i have experienced them when visiting and i can honestly say: I would be mortified to be an American.
---
I used to be all about Redbull, then I realized how much I was spending on it. So I started trying various Monster and Rockstar flavors, each company has their hits and misses. I'm not sure if I was getting bored of my go-to flavors but after a while something made me start exploring other brands.
---
Regular flavor NOS is my current jam. It's a weird flavor for sure, like a mix of Mountain Dew and Orange Juice, but since I usually have them during morning hours it suits me well.
---
It depends on things that fluctuate everyday, not limited to auction house sales and amount of people out mining versus amount of people out mindlessly slaughtering mobs.
---
I've been telling everyone that brought it up that it will be released late aug/sep, no ones listening but they'll remember my words.. maybe
---
Yup. Unsubbed 10 years ago when I got married. But will have to give it another go when classic is released.
---
Not only that, they added it during a content drought. It was basically a giant "fuck you" to the subscribers.
---
Solid advice m8.
---
boars were absolutely the jam! I think it was something to do with their charge stacking with growl giving them a massive aggro output that meant you'd never have to worry about pulling off of them - I can't remember the specifics of the bug since it was fixed some time later, but I'm assuming classic will have boars at their OP status again
---
Bc good. Wotlk good. Cata meh. MoP good. Warlords bad. Legion good. Battle for azeroth.. to be determined. Maybe it will get better?
---
People still thinking it will release before that, or even EARLY july are highly delusional
---
Come for the hype, stay for the community building.
---
Also if you don‚Äôt have the time to replay it, there are a number of YouTube videos that chronicle the campaign. There is a very well put together one on the arthas storyline that I watch about once a year for the thrill of it.
---
What is an auction house?
---
You are a good friend. have some updoots
---
A guide on how to never get Reed. I like it.
---
Yeah good point. Fun fact we made sure that no horde players were harmed, so no actual PvP took place.
---
Majority of september is still summer..
---
I didn't care about pandas either way, but that expansion will always rank as the worst in my mind because it's the one that killed talents. (Though Cataclysm had pretty well maimed them already.)
---
Since April 2009
---
Their change to make it easier to create a PTR account probably has to do with a low turnout for the 8.2 PTR, and nothing to do with Classic.
---
Frost mage to anything that can be slowed, I mean anything, including world bosses.
---
My sub expires in may. I bought 6 months when they had the promotion with the ship mount.  I still have like 215 blizz bucks tho for my wow sub after classic release
---
I find that binding the strafe keys to A &amp; D works really well.
---
There's good and bad to it. Class design and dungeon/raid encounters make a lot more sense. Questing is a lot more streamlined, but also braindead easy, so it's kind of a wash for me in that department. They completely killed any social element with dungeon finder and Looking for Raid (LFR). PvP is also terrible now.
---
Frost mage with permafrost rules all.
---
I unsubbed during TBC. Resubbed 2 weeks ago because of the beta rumors...
---
Lmao calling it Chinese whispers is considered racist now? Fucking hell.....
---
I was rich, lived in castle, had a huuuge dick. You would be falling in love so fast.
---
Sounds like you know what you're talking about - any advice on a computer I just purchased? I have spent the last few days "slimming" out everything I can. I've deleted/uninstalled all the extra software, and now I'm on the Windows 10 Home services - do you happen to know which ones I can disable to improve performance?  
---
I'm running an 8th gen i7. It's got 16GB DDR4 RAM, an NVidia GTX 1060 w/6 GB's VRAM, and a SSD, so "no moving parts"
---
Well modmails don't tend to be replied to either so I don't think communication is a strong suite
---
While you can combine it with ports and food, enchanting is one of the least needed and slowest to progress skills. You have to raid and get pattern drops because your main sellers are the high end weapon enchants, and spell power to gloves. The reason i exclude other note-worthy enchants is because they are so common the competition will be huge. Tailor/mining  or tailor/skinner or skinning with herb/mining are the best no commitment high profit trades while leveling. herb alch is also good.
---
At 60, use tailoring to get your robe if you care about minmaxing, it isnt much better than the robe of winter night, otherwise, engi is always very powerful.
---
Jayde and Saht?

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800‚Äî2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow‚Äôs release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We‚Äôve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone‚Äôs time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don‚Äôt be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm ‚Äì 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let‚Äôs chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy  but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.
---
**Current Activity**:  Currently a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)  You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT)
---
**Join us!**
---
It can't be neither.
---
OP is asking for which is better out of 2 possible options, not if they are the best of all available options.
---
This as well as they want to keep as much content as possible to showcase for blizzcon. I‚Äôm assuming, given the increase in ticket prices they want to give people a reason for paying the extra money.
---
Unpopular opinion in the MMO scene but I absolutely hate shared mob tagging. I want to be an asshole and left alone but the game won't let me
---
Buy a proper MMO mouse, the kind with 12+ buttons on the thumb side. Helps IMMENSELY.
---
Satyrs all the way
---
What if something saw something that wasn‚Äôt good for them?? You can‚Äôt just have people looking at things that haven‚Äôt been approved
---
Happy hunting.
---
Started in towards the end of Legion, looking foward to Classic. Really want to experience it.
---
Oh dude idk! I‚Äôd like to look into that
---
Imagine walking past 20 different raids and knowing/realizing that they are completely irrelevant.
---
Modern wow has been fantastic as a "resub, play current xpac for a month, unsub - resub near the end, then the next expac"
---
I doubt the south park guys knew how iconic this image would become.
---
Well you're never going to get macros to manage cc or the fun stuff like that. But really why would someone want to.
---
Dps rotations are just boring to me.
---
11234112112311211234112112311211234
---
if i didn't care about cosmetics in bfa I totally would. game sucks atm but still like collecting stuff. Also you're going to need a sub anyways so might as well grind gold on retail to get wow tokens. if I was going strictly vanilla I'd buy as many wow tokens + game time so won't have to worry about not getting to play for a month if I need the few extra bucks down the road.
---
I was in the 4th grade during vanilla, didn‚Äôt really play the game back then but more or less played for the social aspect as a kid, back then making friends on the internet was very new and exciting. Never have been a pro player. My best achievement was downing LK (10 man) in a guild I had created myself. Honestly it‚Äôs more of one of my favorite memories in general.
---
/r/woweconomy - classic edition. Likely best money will be AH sniping, flipping, etc.
---
I'll have a second account whose sole purpose will be gold making. AH alt, limited vendor camp, etc... all without impacting me playing my main at all.
---
Didn't they announce Warlords of draenor and Legion at gamescom ? In the past they cared. But this year the timing is off (August) for announcements
---
Hard to tell until it launches really. I hope it does translate but until we get in there is no real way to know.

An ability like the original Tauren plainsrunning is also a possible option.
---
Maybe instead of being upright your Naga would slither along the ground at mount speed.
---
I didn't really play much of anything past WotLK but I see that sentiment a lot about Legion that it was actually a pretty good expansion.
---
Would you be able to say what it was that Legion did right that WoD before it and BfA after it did not?
---
The feeling will be different. Then again the feeling will be different between people who played vanilla back in 2004, because it didn't mean the same thing to each of us. For some of us, the stronger feelings will be found in the raiding content. Brothers, the stronger feelings will be found in prancing through elwynn forest and throwing bags and Buffs on low levels.
---
And for others of us, strong feelings will be found in filling our backpacks with books and diamonds and pieces of Abomination skin and flirting with high elf librarians.

Been unsubbed since Legion. It took me a while to figure out WHY I could stand Legion or even BFA (Free time). I think I finally figured it out.... The game is to Meta. I'm not talking about the min/max talents or gear. I'm talking about the world itself is meta. It is no longer just loot that you get , it's here is a named item with random stats that will be different everytime. The world itself is designed to be efficient instead of being designed to be a world. Dungeons are no longer a dangerous location but 17+ variants of the same location. 
---
Simply put, Retail has become a game in ever sense over being a world to get lost in. Yes a lot of those mechanics were added in other expansions but Legion combined them or took them to an extreme. Like TBC added multiple versions of the same dungeon (normal and heroic) and WoD added another (Mythic) but Legion just took that and went how can we gamify it and made greater rifts. Everything is is clearly designed from a meta standpoint instead of a world.
---
Did made me laugh as well so much... then I told my wife.
---
Her response: you don't have to - just close the fucking door when you play.

If you like running around zones looking for herbs then that will probably work out better for you. You always have the option to buy from the AH if you don't feel like herbing or if the pickings are slim. The prices for herbs, and most other crafting resources, are going to fluctuate regularly depending on supply and demand, and are also highly subject to "Goblin Fuckery".
---
Self proclaimed "Goblins" are the people who sit around and play the auction house to see how much gold they can amass. Some do it for RL money, some do it just for kicks. It's a different way to enjoy the game. I personally think it is detrimental to community but that is neither here nor there. Once they get their bankroll going they can flip huge quantities of material on the auction house and really mess with the pricing on a server.
---
If you don't have the desire to pay attention to the ebb and flow of the AH for your particular herbs then you may end up paying ridiculous prices, and it might even be cheaper to just buy the potions. Don't forget you are also competing against people who are buying herbs for the purpose of leveling Alchemy, so they are willing to pay more than someone just trying to make product.

Mods used to annoy me until I realized that they somehow got cucked into doing free work in exchange for going on an internet power trip
---
How well does retri palas do with a decent healing set? 
---
Good enough to heal level 60 dungeons that they still need gear from without getting carried? There is obviously no excuse for hybrid specs that requires a semi-similar gear set not to heal and get some decent talents from their respective talent tree, but that is not the case with retri obviously.
---
Just to be different.
---
Unsubbed since BFA. Played pretty seriously through MoP, quit in Warlords and came back for a few months at a time during legion.
---
Overall underwhelmed with everything related to WoW besides Classic at this point. Can't wait!
---
Looks completely unrelated to me. PTR for 8.2 just went live and that‚Äôs all they‚Äôre talking about. They also wouldn‚Äôt have people getting into classic through a ptr

dual-boxing was infinitely easier in Vanilla. Plenty of us 40man box end game content, The vanilla macro system made it ridiculously powerful.
---
They'll be playing Classic, no time for you. RIP the dream.
---
I'm fine with waiting until Its completely finished. I'm afraid that if they release it too soon due to popular demand it will be a mess. But that's what launch was so I guess it would be pretty accurate
---
Unsubbed mid Wrath
---
Much confused?
---
I played from BC to Cata (started in vanilla, but only made it to a 47 on a warrior before I quit) 
---
Excited to give the vanilla raids a shot! Got my fianc√© who‚Äôs never played WoW beyond trying some private servers to get a flavor roped into this endeavor. She‚Äôs currently torn between a mage/paladin/shaman. 
---
And I will for sure be maining a warrior.
---
You wont get a vanilla feel.
---
But an authentic classic feel for sure
---
Honestly asking since I don‚Äôt know anything about the modern game. How is raiding harder and more challenging now?
---
Lol what the fuck
---
The best parts of classic:
---
1. It has that cartoony look that won't ever look so bad it's unplayable
---
2. The client is stable, runs well, and moving around the world doesn't feel glitchy or sluggish
---
3. The game is polished, but still has that roughness to it where mechanics aren't always readily apparent on the surface. Stuff like having weird abilities on low level items that keep them relevant still at 60, multiple ways to farm up items for different uses, quest items letting you do wonky things if you keep them and don't complete the quest etc
---
I don't really know the state of the game passed Cataclysm but TBC just about killed world pvp which is by far my favorite part by far, and I highly suggest you roll on a PvP. Getting ganked sucks, but the emergent game play that comes from the Alliance vs Horde aspect is still unmatched.
---
One time I was roaming around Hillsbrad as a 60 mage and a 40 something priest said they were getting ganked. I came to help and me and this lowbie priest fought off and the corpse camped 4 alliance until the paladin bubble hearthed and the others ran off. Stuff like that is the reason I loved and played vanilla WoW and everything else was a means to that end
---
Are blue posts made every friday?
---
Exactly. Why give out your secrets?
---
I didn't do endgame on private servers, but here's my little theory nonetheless:
---
Us tryhards with our accumulated years of knowledge are going to go back to Classic and find the (dungeons at least) content surprisingly simple and, well, much easier than we remember.
---
And in that environment, hybrid classes being somewhat less optimal than the pure specialists just isn't going to matter.
---
Unsubbed when a couple weeks into the WotLK launch and never looked back. I just recently tried BFA with the free until lvl 20 thing... What a shock! Can anyone tell me if leveling changes after 20? Just on the rails and everyone zipping around on loud motorcycles?
---
There are actually a lot of good pvp potions in alch you wont normally have on hand. Alch is a good pvp prof, even though you could just buy your FAPs, being able to make them means you'll have them more often.
---
Monster Assault is always my go-to. Highly recommend.
---
I hated Pandas in the WOW lore. Felt gay. Sorry
---
Legion was actually really good.
---
Unsubbed since mid cata
---
T
---
Pretty much. You gain a little power as you level but everything you face does too, so you never actually "get stronger "
---
Never heard of her
---
and Murlocs, and Centaurs...
---
Never played classic.. kind of. I played on nostalrius until level 25 and then they took it down. I'm excited to try it again. And actually reach the cap
---
I was enjoying BFA pvp until maledicts trinket and some other tuning changes were released.  I've been unsubbed since then
---
You don't really need a gaming laptop to play WoW.
---
DemCritties the human female paladin.
---
Yeah, I really liked TBC and I think it struck a nice balance between "everybody is viable" and "everybody still feels like different classes". Whether it was originally intended for vanilla or not isn't really relevant in my opinion, it wound up attached to TBC instead, which hopefully will have its own server option after Classic.
---
You're getting way too sidetracked here. My main point was that the thread wasn't political and that the picture wasn't so bad. 
---
Going on about how other people's opinions are irrelevant does not in any way shape or form discredit what I said. It does goes against the spirit of public forums where different opinions are meant to be discussed. The mod's opinions on the thread due to the picture diverge from what I believe and this is fine. I don't think this thread is important enough to warrant their questionning either because I understand why they closed it even if I disagree.
---
And clearly you care about my opinion otherwise you wouldn't be coming back to this thread day after day and being more and more abrasive. If you just post as a "gotcha" because one or multiple mods agreed with you it just makes you look petty, not more intelligent.
---
The divorce rate is like 50% my guy. People are definitely getting into the wrong relationships.
---
what are you talking about there was no great mananement sysyem. no cast sequence no target of target etc
---
tell the raid leader you are holy,
---
Aoe farm undead
---
???
---
Profit
---
I just want to pick some god damn herbs before bed is that so much to ask like fuck
---
The game went through most of its major changes starting in cata and being 'refined' in Mop. 
---
LFR was added in cata, 
---
new talent system wad MoP(?), 
---
some specs became more 'unique' like demo lock. 
---
Even LFG was added ToC patch of Wotlk which some people look at as the beginning of the end, or beginning of new wow if you're less of a doomsayer. 
---
So going back before that time should feel like a new game to the newer players, much as the newer wow feels like a new game to the older players. But the new crowd may not enjoy it and may feel a bit restrained.
---
Thibgs like only being able to send one item per mail that you send. Having reduced bag space as a warlock or hunter. Less flight paths, etc. May feel like silly 're-additons' to the game.
---
Only thing to know for sure. It will feel very different.
---
There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll make leek 60 with more than 2-300g. Even if you skip level 40 mount, you won‚Äôt have enough for an epic mount when you ding. Not to mention, you might have to spend the 80g for riding skill as a prerequisite.
---
I'm subbed. I enjoy it but that's because in my opinion its the best game of the genre at the moment still. If you treat it as a seperate thing its still enjoyable.
---
TIL what TIL means.
---
&gt;But levelling through old expansion is not "content" any more, it's just a grind to get to the real game.
---
I actually somewhat wished they didn't accelerate leveling so much for old content, since I never played most of it and you blow through it too fast now to really experience any of it.
---
Unsubbed a long time ago but plan on using my gold to buy a few months of classic. If it works out I'll resub
---
I made a lot more money selling herbs than I did from crafting regular pots.  Without having rare recipe pots to sell you'd be better off buying herbs when they're cheap and reselling them when they're high.

Yo. I would like to personally apologize for how long this is. I started writing and couldn't stop. I literally couldn't fit it into a comment reply.

Havent been subbed since tbc. I would sub now if it meant i could get a classic date.
---
What works well for me and my SO is just having a consistent schedule for gaming. I‚Äôl usually binge on Friday and Saturday while she‚Äôs at work, and every other day i‚Äôl just play when she‚Äôs occupied or asleep, typically 10-12 PM
---
It's great to have aomeone you know irl playing with you! I have a few people to play with. My only concern with them is that I'll be taking it more seriously than them lol so there will be quite a level gap.
---
There was target of target... Cast sequence can be coded by macros with delay queues. I don't know what you mean by that first sentence.
---
In TBC I periodically would level my warlock with one of my friends who was ret. I started getting legitimately frustrated at times. While some quests would get done faster, others with unshared drops were a nightmare. I'm fairly sure that I actually leveled slower while grouping with him due to how slowly he killed things and the shared xp etc. At some point I just told him I'd prefer to level on my own outside of doing group content just to avoid developing animosity.
---
Hard same OP. Some of these posts legit make me question the quality of life of the poster when they claim they will put in 55 hrs a week. Yes, it‚Äôs  funny to say things like ‚Äúkissing my life, job, gf goodbye for classic!‚Äù But I‚Äôm actuality you sound like a loser. The game is fun, I loved it and will love it again. I used to play a ton as a kid. But with a career, fianc√©, and other interests, putting 55hrs a week into s video game sounds like an absolute chore that would ruin my life. To each their own.
---
i respect your opinion and input
---
Everything the game will be will be as close authentic as it can be from what we've seen. 
---
My most major concern is the community and how the new generation will meld with the old one. Mindsets have changed so much in the mmo space and most of the nostalgic gamers have grown older now.
---
I‚Äôm going to level arms 1-60, because I‚Äôm leveling on a PvP server. But, Fury is designed for raw DPS, and the first two rows in Arms are DoTs and utility. At 36-40, you want to respec to Arms even if you started Fury, so you can abuse sweeping strikes every other pull.
---
Yes. I came back for Legion in 2016. See above.
---
I actually liked the post cataclysm world.  I think the design of the areas were great. 
---
The way the implemented the quests into the areas to super-streamline it, and the way they massively sped up leveling with cataclysm is what ruined it imo.
---
I think it still stands as one of the biggest wastes of effort in gaming history.  They put so much effort into updating all the areas and people would spend all of 1 day played leveling in it before Outland.
---
I actually thought dragon soul was an awesome raid, mind you I was big into the death wing lore since vanilla. (The world ‚Äúrevamp‚Äù was tragic tho)
---
I had the exact same question a few weeks ago, checkout the thread: https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbnehp/how_hard_is_it_to_gear_a_pvp_ele_shaman/
---
I don't think I have tried that one, I will look for it.
---
My wife will be right there with me!  Now if only we knew what to do with this damn baby we made...
---
&gt;Legion was fantastic 
---
Nah, It just had a shit ton of  boring content and a ton of cosmetics thrown at people to mask over the shallow game play loop they created years ago.
---
Make sure to stock up on light feathers first.
---
Raids won‚Äôt be authentic. Besides people knowing the mechanics, which is unavoidable, raids will actually numerically be easier, from 1.12 talents, itemization, and boss nerfs.
---
Basically molten core will be as easy as it was once naxx was out, even when it‚Äôs the only raid out (besides onyxia).
---
This is obviously flawed because it was understandable to make entry raids easier once harder raids were out for specific reasons-
---
1. With new content constantly coming out, you want to make it so people can experience more of the content
---
2. It‚Äôs fine to have an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù raid option once hard raids are actually out so there is still a challenge somewhere 
---
With no new content necessarily coming out and people already having knowledge of the raid mechanics, of anything it would make more sense to want to make raids harder numerically for more Authenticity and making the game last as long as possible, but because of imo a flawed interpretation of ‚Äúno changes‚Äù, low tier raids will exist in their most nerfed form in 1.12 without the existence of harder raids simultaneously, a state that never existed in vanilla and will be even worse now.
---
Like In the past maybe MC would be a 3/6 difficulty on release. And by the time Naxx was released, MC would be 1/6, BWL would be 2 or 3, AQ  would be 4, and naxx would be 6. 
---
Now when MC is released It‚Äôll be 1/6 from the go but without the harder raids existing to justify this (again, not even accounting for increased knowledge)
---
I‚Äôm really excited about classic, but I think raid difficulty, especially of early raids (only way naxx will be easier is knowledge, which is still significant ofc), will be the biggest divergence from Vanilla authenticity.
---
What the fuck is WTF
---
The mechanics are harder and require more precise execution. You're punished a lot harder if you mess up -- a single mistake almost always means a wipe on Mythic.
---
Guilds that progress through Mythic generally can't have dead weight. Everyone has to be pretty good at their class. On the other hand, up until Naxx, you could very much have 5 - 10 people in your raid that more or less just weren't AFK.
---
[Here's the end boss of Tier 22, G'huun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubXDO7TYVs). The amount of things going on is significantly crazier than, say, C'thun or Kel'Thuzad.
---
This is to say nothing for individual performance -- while rotations in BfA aren't "complex," most classes are way more complex than they were in Vanilla.
---
Way ahead of you: getting divorced.
---
This is the episode that got me into WoW in the first place üòÇüòÇ
---
Lol @ blocking ppl who have the audacity to respond to your comment... this mf'r....
---
BFA is really bad. I was subbed for like a month after BFA, fastest I ever unsubbed after an expansion launch and it's sad. I gave it another shot last month and the game is in a terrible state. The core system is awkward, the new features are boring, the classes are all broken and feel unfinished. Only positives are the zones and the music. If Blizzard's name wasn't attached to BFA, it would've gone down as one of the worst games of 2018.
---
How much money do I have to put into the vending machine for this candy?
---
I think there's a high chance of beta this week. Alpha on the public CDN probably means they're just testing out the PTR access from outside Blizzard network access over easter break. As soon as everyone's finished with easter leave and they've ironed out any bugs the cropped up they'll be ready for beta rollout.
---
Best ways to make money with blacksmithing is to craft raid items like nightfall, Lionheart Helm. Or, crafting Mithril spurs and weapon chains. Weapon Chain is an especially rare drop, and there might only be 1 person on each faction with the pattern.
---
Been unsubbed since bfa launched. If the current version of the game was EVER going to improve, bfa was it. Legion was overall a pretty solid expansion, and yet they threw away EVERYTHING good about Legion and somehow made a game worse than wod was.
---
Can't wait for the real wow to come back.
---
Join same guild, create or find a discord channel to all hang out and voice chat together in, have higher levels help the lower levels run through dungeons for quests/gear to help then catch up and stay interested, you guys will all meet at 60 eventually.
---
Resubbed two days ago because I was bored.
---
Did some WQ just for the sake of it, leveled my shaman and tried to find Voidtalon portal on 13 different characters.
---
Found out I was only a thousand rep away to get zandalari trolls and I found Voidtalon portal after 2 years of looking for it (ye really bad luck!!)
---
Guess I‚Äôve had a good comeback so far :D but ye, I was unsubbed prior to buying gametime for a couple of months. So hyped for classic ! :D
---
Yes
---
Been unsubbed since 2015. Only coming back for classic!
---
I started in TBC but didn't start raiding til wrath. I PvP'd in MoP, and I dabbled in Cata, WoD, and Legion. I'm excited to experience my first TBC character, an undead priest, in the world of vanilla. I probably won't raid, but I hope to heal some pvp and help out players that are new to the pre-cata world.
---
Naga are pretty much just cursed Night Elves. They would not be a part of the Alliance as the Night Elves would shun them for their part in the first demonic invasion and the subsequent bargain they made with the Old Gods that transformed them into Naga.
---
You may want to try and type that sentence again. Blocking someone for a dissenting opinion is telling anyway.
---
My characters name will be (hopefully) the same name as my "present" main
---
A rogue with a name reflecting this.
---
Legion added a lot to the game. Just off the top of my head:
---
*  Artifact weapons and class halls were cool. They had a system of progression, they added complexity to classes, and they added a lot of flavor to every class (and spec!) in the game. That was something that had been missing for a long time, and this was just enough spice to make things interesting.
---
*  Mythic dungeons added something else to do that was fun and interesting, yet also challenging.
---
*  The quest design and just overall Legion experience was fantastic. While not surprising, as Blizzard always gets this right, Legion shined in all the right ways.
---
*  Blizzard rapidly released content for the expansion -- a big deal, since in recent memory this is the thing that most people complained about.
---
*  Suramar was incredible.
---
*  Demon Hunters were a cool addition.
---
That's to say nothing of all the usual stuff that comes along with an expansion that was generally good. It had flaws, but IMO, it was the best expansion since WotLK, at least. BfA really could've pruned the ideas that didn't work and expanded on the ideas that did, but instead they very much went in the opposite direction -- doubling down on things people didn't like, and ignoring the things that they did.
---
And WQs to take selfies. Which I will not do, no matter how much I need that faction's rep
---
yup
---
What in my post is wrong?
---
There‚Äôs no set schedule, but recently they‚Äôve been making about a blue post per week. Last Friday we got one.
---
I don‚Äôt really have a recommendation for that many friends, but my group of 4 or 5 will have a group leveling together with our 2nd-4th most wanted to play classes.
---
Never group your ‚Äúmain‚Äù or just someone that you know you‚Äôre going to want to play when others aren‚Äôt on.
---
Also, if my group does split up while questing, create a google sheet with quests you have done that got you ahead of other people, so they‚Äôll be able to catch up. But also be willing to help them catch up if they aren‚Äôt able to play.
---
100% a lie  you‚Äôre not doing diremaul in West fall. DM was deadmines
---
I missed the end of Cataclysm most of Pandaria... came back for Siege of Orgrimmar... and left again mid-WoD.
---
We're both fucking nerds that plan on no-lifing this together when it comes out so problem solved.
---
We laughed at him, but damn his place looks decent enough so he must have a job. Also, what's not awesome about being the best at something?
---
I am, but probably by default; I don‚Äôt sub during uni semesters, so when I resub hopefully classic will also be available :)
---
I‚Äôm gonna make a night elf hunter called Nightelfhunter.
---
I've always subbed to try out every expansion but generally it's only the bare minimum and then I'm out for a couple years till the next one. The only time I had a recurring sub was vanilla/tbc/wrath.
---
Or just play like a person that loves their family, rather than like somebody that sees them as an impediment to no-lifing.
---
Yes. Some. Heh heh

Frost mage farm alt

The mods here like to power trip pretty hard.

Just look at the dude's wording lmao *This is an official warning*

Like cmon man it's a fucking video game subreddit
---
I poked and prodded around the "Scouring of Stratholme" instance in WotLK for quite a while.
---
Such a great explanation. I quit after Wraith of The Lich King. I logged on during the free weekend, and for some reason, I was automatically moved to a region I've never been in during login.
---
I have never step foot in that place, I didn't know where I was. That confused me so much that I just logged off again.
---
God that takes me back. I miss the passion; so much apathy these days.
---
My man !! You got it right. I'll see you in Azeroth.
---
It is quite convenient.
---
Warlock is up there for sure too.
---
If you played in TBC: the special bosses at the end of raid dungeons had more complex mechanics (ex: Kael Thas). If you only played vanilla, think C'thun, twins, or some of the Naxx fights with heavier mechanics. That's now the standard for every boss. There aren't many fights now where you stand still, spam frostbolt, and tank-and-spank.
---
Considering they announced Classic beta will be this summer.
---
Doubt it
---
Have an actual name that fits the gender instead of names like ‚Äònerdstabber‚Äô ‚Äòdarkhunterxxx‚Äô. I have a few names keeping them to myself.

I was also joking, but apparently nobody read it that way

I worry that my old guild will all roll Alliance because by the end of TAQ it was pretty obvious who Blizzard wanted to win WoW
---
Exactly. But at the same time it would take so goddamned long if they didn't. And another thought on getting to the "real game": To me the real game now is leveling. They fucked up when the "real game" starts at max level, basically telling you your leveling experience should be fast and largely ignored.
---
But like I said, the real game to me is leveling. I level to like 100 or so then start a new toon. No point in playing at max level on more than 1 toon since it's just a pointless rep/AP grind. First xpac where I have had 0 interest in leveling multiple toons well into max content. Too much work for basically 0 reward.
---
ain't that the truth
---
You seem to have an axe to grind here, or you seem to think I'm arguing against what blizzard has done. Nowhere did state I thought it was against this, the whole point of my post was that it's going to change pre-raid BiS. You really need to work on reading comprehension. 
---
You seem to be listing a lot of items from later patches as being better/the same here, when the point is all these good items will be available from day 1.
---
&gt;Brigam Girdle was beaten already by Belt of Perseved Heads and if you argue that is another phase, then Brigam Girdle is beaten by Onslaught Girdle off Rag. There are also several 40+ AP belts to chose from, which are like 70-80% as good.
---
Why are you listing raid items? We're talking about pre-raid BiS here. Stuff available pre-raids, and there is nothing than compete with updated brigam girdle for AP/Hit
---
&gt;Skul's is a retard comparison because Savage Glad chest was +20 def.
---
Skul's is a slightly more threat oriented piece because it offers more str while still having def, more than EBT or Kromcrush. either way it's now competitive with those pieces (maybe moreso, as we see the meta for tanks shifting to wanting more threat rather than def).
---
&gt;Deathbone was and still is outclassed by BRD Legs:
---
Debatable, it would depend on how much def/stam you have already. The point is they can compete for BiS.
---
&gt;If you think a 2.3 speed 2h sword is 'fine', I don't really know what to say. It also does not invalidate AR... One is a BoE easy to get profession item, and one is a low drop rate off the end boss of an endgame 5 man.
---
Why are you quoting the word fine? I never said anything about it. And it does invalidate it AR, especially early in the game. A blacksmith needs to get the recipe which only drops 1/20 times from a rare mob in LBRS, then grind 20 arcanite bars and pay the exorbitant crafting fee. The only reason people did this in vanilla was because there was no alternatives. I would sure as hell farm strat live 3-4 times as soon as people start hitting 60. Look at what happened to arcanite reapers as soon as icy barbed spear became available for much less work.
---
&gt;The omni boots gained 9 int.
---
They gained more than that over the course of vanilla, but yes, that's the gist. The extra int pushes them over to being comparably better than the boots from rend, while being off an easier boss. It's like you don't understand the concept of BiS
---
with an even more terrible "core system" than the despised legendary system
---
I wanted to go horde this time and play enhancement shaman but my wife refuses to play horde without blood elf and 2 of my 3 friends only play alliance. So it was roll horde solo or roll alliance with 4 others to atleast farm 5 man stuff for pre raid BIS
---
Yeah it‚Äôs absolute bullshit they are bringing them back. If you don‚Äôt want hardcore PvP, don‚Äôt be on a PvP server.
---
I just don‚Äôt have the energy for end game content in retail right now. I love the game a lot, but it was just tedious. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll find classic more fun.
---
I'm making a Tauren Hunter called Nightchief.
---
One of the perks of being on an rp server is the lack of names like that.
---
Was thinking ‚Äòbenafflock‚Äô when I was considering rolling warlock. But now I‚Äôm going hunter so probably xlegolasx üòÇ
---
Same
---
I wish we could rip the secrets from their flesh...
---
Every expansion since wrath I‚Äôve tried out and ended up quitting, the last two I feel like have just been awful though. I miss BC
---
I agree with your sentiment but would like to point out that due to ability prune, PvP is actually a lot easier now a days... Or at least has a low skill ceiling than before.
---
As a Horde guy, hearing this from him made me giggle like a little girl
---
&gt; And I don't play no fucking homo Alliance either. I don't play no fucking Night Elf's or Gnomes, it's fucking Orcs and Undeads! Fuck the Alliance, fucking die you emo cocksuckers!
---
Oh, hey parallel universe me.
---
Yeah, I met my husband in vanilla WoW, so we have a duo already built in. We're thinking warrior/mage, but not sure yet.
---
Owl only does 3% less damage than a cat, with far more survivability and the benefit of aoe threat
---
After a certain point all of the tanks will be fury warriors so
---
MoP was a decent expansion. Better than Cata, better than WoD, better than BfA.
---
Heearthstooone
---
Take me home.
---
We have mechanics where DPS fucking up wipes a huge group or the entire raid.
---
For instance Ghuun had a mechanic where someone will randomly get a debuff that when procced drops a pool that slows and deals damage and shoots out 4 grey meatballs. If the meatballs hit someone it gives them the debuff and rinse and repeat. You also have mechanics like the sides on ghuun that require one person or two to run an orb in a few seconds while being slowed by puss scabs, and the orb slowing you down as well till you get stuck. You require warlocks to drop gates to skip it. And people were taking classes that could solo orb run to get it done. You also have way more cone attacks, aoes, required interupts and unavoidable damage in bursts than the old expansions
---
Roger. I‚Äôm going across the bay. I‚Äôm hesitant to actually bring my laptop because I want to focus on going to gym, my wife is going on deployment with me and I‚Äôll test for staff when I get back. I know classic will absorb more and more of my time.
---
Played 1 month(14days) of legion and realised it was just another hit daily cap and stuff like the previous expansions and haven‚Äôt subbed since.
---
Please don‚Äôt listen to this guy, he is blindsiding you and parroting a very, very dumb opinion on here that the game is easy.
---
LEVELING is easy now, but that‚Äôs not the point of the game anymore. I can bet you my entire life savings that this guy has never cleared a mythic+ 17 or mythic current content if he thinks the game is easy, it is a LOT harder at the top end than it used to be. 
---
People on here need to stop repeating these stupid arguments over and over, they are just wrong. Current wow is bad for a hell of a lot of reasons, but raid design and difficulty is not one of them, it‚Äôs the hardest it‚Äôs ever been.
---
The guilds that are formed now that last past 2 months in the game will be about 2% of total guilds. I wouldn't worry about it.
---
GF and I have RP-appropriate names picked out for all our planned characters (with some backups just in case). Used a fantasy name generator for most of them, with a few tweaks here and there.
---
You wont be able to get the 60 training until you buy the 40 training.
---
The training is the expensive part
---
12 character limit Nightelfhunt is all you get or Nigel Fhunter
---
Easier compared to what? I think it gets muddy if you try to compare the last few expansions, but there's no doubt in my mind that the average PvP'er from today would crush the average Vanilla PvP'er and it wouldn't even be close.
---
Im from Wisconsin as well. And now that we are consistant in the 60 degree weather im never inside. Really hoping blizz drops classic in October lol
---
I've been subbed to the game since release day 2004.  It's still fun, though I do different things in game now than I did 15 years ago.  Of course I dislike a lot of the changes made over the years, but there is still plenty of fun to be found in Azeroth.  Collecting transmog is a real delight. I fucking love playing dress up with my characters.
---
I play alliance and even i laughed. So cool to see someone be passionate about the game and passionate about the horde vs alliance. Back in the day that was really something :D.
---
I respect your opinion and you‚Äôre input into the discussion
---
Many of the big guilds from vanilla were formed in other games before they came over to wow. It probably won‚Äôt be any more prevalent than it was back then.
---
Guild Recruitment for raiders and casuals
---
Hello I am here recruiting for my guild, we are playing on a NA PVP server. 
---
We will be an Alliance guild that plans on raiding, doing PVP and organized world PVP as well. 
---
The raid time as of now is on Wednesday starting at 8pm to Midnight central time we are looking to add another raid day(We are a moderate raiding guild). 
---
We are also open to all players and will be very casual friendly. We are wanting to have a fun community for the Classic experience. 
---
If you are interested in joining our guild please check us out at our discord https://discord.gg/vqcCkyY
---
Tanks are a rare enough commodity that indicating you already have one can encourage others to join when they wouldn‚Äôt join otherwise.
---
You rolled a warrior on a vanilla server. Get used to it?
---
BREAKUP YOU MUST KILL KEL‚ÄôTHUZAD
---
Yeah, i wanna play the game, but im really hoping it comes out as late in the summer as possible.  Ill have 6+ months of the year where i dont want to set foot outside, THATS when i want to no life a videogame :)
---
Now were Generals of the alliance/horde, leader of our class. But we still need to collect twelve goat horns for that farmer in kultiras...
---
I mean WoW isn't really that punishing tbh.
---
Same prob with me and some friends. We're going to have 'solo mains' and 'group mains'. Basically one char for leveling alone and one for leveling with the bulk of your friends. TBH I'd rather just get to 60 in our own ways and then do stuff together at 60.
---
Yep! My friends and I call winter "Gaming season"  and maybe il get an extra couple days to play when the city shuts down to negative 70 degrees next winter.
---
So...completely off the subject here, but this clip makes me question my choice to not focus on PvE.
---
Did someone say.... BLEVERNEST?
---
????????????????????????????????
---
This has happened in so many games.  My suggestion is to ignore it unless there's something specific you want to do, e.g. Raid at an odd hour.
---
The biggest problem is that guilds formed before servers are out tend to have a hard time with quality control etc.  you will be lucky if everyone gets to 60 2 weeks in and attuned and relatively geared for endgame.
---
The real community building happens in game.  Even if you're in a guild, you will run into people trying to do quests, trying to do instances, etc.  they will be fixtures on the server that you will remember, most likely.
---
It's not feasible to never communicate with people on the server.
---
i Mean, Shamans have more usable abilities than there is hotbar space, so yes. Keybinds are crucial
---
So thats why BfA doesn‚Äôt make logical sense! Ifs a joke :O
---
Bruh, have you leveled a warr on a fresh server??
---
Causals LoL
---
&gt; You know what‚Äôs actually a problem? People who make a problem out of nothing.
---
Because misogyny in gamer communities is not a problem? Did you sleep through all that "gamergate" stuff?
---
&gt; Who are you to say what is and is not allowed in comedy?
---
I'm not saying what's "allowed". Where did I say you weren't "allowed" to post misogynistic jokes? Post racist ones as well if you like, it's up to the mods what is and is not allowed. I am just pointing out the misogyny.
---
Funny how people who post indefensible things have to try to make the argument about what they are "allowed" to do.
---
&gt; That was not misogynistic.
---
I am sure you don't think blonde jokes are misogynistic either.
---
&gt; You have the wrong sub reddit!
---
Because this is *totally* the sub for misogynistic genie jokes?
---
Had a cat until like lvl 53, then got an owl from Felwood. The owl feels sooo much better, it's just about impossible to steal aggro from it.
---
That green orb next to the tv 
---
There‚Äôs a whole episode of South Park based on the boys wanting to play it
---
There are none that are ergonomic :(
---
I get severe wrist pain when I use one that isn't turned vertically.
---
well when they reach max level, have them help you guys out by helping run yall through dungeons and gearing you guys out in BoEs/dungeon gear.
---
I would highly recommend checking out [this](https://www.elsanglinreborn.com/).
---
El's Anglin was a mainstay in Azeroth for years and years.  While I haven't been in WoW in a long time, it looks like the website has a renewed focus on what's coming up in classic wow.
---
Not me. It has it's problems sure but I'm having a blast. I think unless you push endgame content and have buddies it would probably be super dull though.
---
Unplayable is a stretch.
---
5. Teach them to play? It's not hard, and if they're a decent partner, they'll give it a shot. Then you can wow into oblivion together.
---
Bruh should‚Äôve been
---
‚ÄúCROOOOOSSSROOAAADS

People who play in a pitch-black room with their monitor brightness turned up to 98%... how are you not blind? I know a lot of people do this, and I cannot figure out the logistics of it. I would have a migraine within 45 mins of playing like this.
---
Nightelf
---
It will be a gnome.
---
Too late she already ended it because i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to fly her out. Undisturbed, 10-14 hours a day of classic here i come.
---
I too got the joke.
---
Games were designed a differently back in 2004. WoW was the casual MMO back then.
---
retail is a single player game
---
&gt;pservers are hardcore xdddd
---
Entirely correct in my response. The averages and general knowledge have been completely tainted in the past 15 years by private servers and dedicated players.
---
When I played vanilla and hit 60 I did a survey with my guild asking them how long it took /played to hit 60. The average response was around 18 days. I distinctly remember that my time of 14 days /played was unusually fast. Many players never hit 60, they would log in and chat or explore. 
---
8-12 days is average for an experience wow player. If they are new to the game it will be closer to 20 days.
---
Westfall maybe? The defias storyline is pretty long and interesting.
---
When did they announce that?
---
I wouldn't even call it watered down. It's worse than that. Legion had at least SOMETHING to strive for. An artifact appearance, legendaries, class halls, beautiful leveling areas, interesting storylines for each area. 
---
In BFA you have a necklace that levels itself, and leveling is a literal chore. The only fun I had in the entire expansion were the dungeons, nothing else.
---
Duskwood (:
---
I've never actually played WoW.
---
This is probably the wrong sub for sensitive folk like yourself.
---
I don't use one
---
They‚Äôre the best.
---
I will be attempting to name my undead rogue after an undead rogue that helped me a ton when I was a fresh 70 in TBC. He had a pretty common name though so dunno if I'll get it.
---
If you think 1% is many then idk
---
On mythic it's annoyingly difficult and only the top guilds in the game attempt it. On heroic it's about as challenging as vanilla raids like bwl and aq. Normal difficulty is easy mode. LFR is AFK mode.
---
This completely encapsulates what I love about Vanilla. The expansions have felt over designed both in the gameplay and narrative to me, such that it lessens my immersion. I also like the option of grinding.
---
I bought bfa...used the leveling token before release and haven't played bfa yet
---
As someone who‚Äôs getting deployed also, but in the navy so no internet for 6 months during classic release, fuck you. Have fun tho lol.
---
Are you looking for /r/gatekeeping?
---
&gt;There is always something better to bring than a ret paladin.
---
Pretty sure that is objectively wrong. On horde, Shamans are so powerful that it is always \*better\* to have a shaman in a group that not to have one. For example 5 Warriors deal less damage than 4 Warriors plus a shaman (spec doesnt matter). Pretty sure it is similar with Paladins.
---
A human rogue named Rob.
---
Wtf the level cap is 120???
---
Lmao
---
I have a new job were i go to different retail stores and stock stuff at them. Well one of my accounts happens to be where i worked when i was addicted to vanilla wow. Needless to say every time i step in there i remember vanilla, and soon ill be addicted again lol
---
Lol arthas tears. No mate.
---
I'd settle for just AN identity.
---
1
---
I stupidly bought Pandaria CE (after quitting Cata quite quickly). Installed, realised none of my mods worked, logged out. Haven't touched it since. Money well spent!
---
Mythic is an extra higher level for hardcore players. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair comparing it against old normal raids.
---
You have 240hr + of levelling ahead of you to slowly work out all of your skills and keybinds as you get them. Unless you have a severe aversion to keybinds/action bars you'll be fine.
---
You don't even really need a "gaming" laptop, just a good quality one with a dedicated graphics card. 
---
I run wow on my old ass 2012 Samsung chronos series 7. Thinking about getting the Dell Spectre x360 but that's like 1200 for the 4 gb dedicated GPU :(
---
I am not giving my toon name up to be taken before I make a character lol
---
Alliance has some really good low level zones.  Westfall, duskwood, ashenvale, darkshore are probably my top picks.
---
For horde Barrens stands out, I like stonetalon as well.  
---
For both factions I like felwood, Burning steppes, wpl/epl.
---
Yep and now zones scale with you along with enemies. It‚Äôs broken down 1-60 Azeroth 60-80 bc&amp;wotlk, 80-90 Cata, mop zones, 90-100 warlords of dragnor, 100-110legion, 110-120bfa. Also you no longer one shot stuff or I didn‚Äôt as a warrior leveling so yeh it‚Äôs insane and they did the scaling so people could experience the lore of a zone without out leveling it for a while so you can literally gain an assload of levels and still be in day barrens because they changed scaling and shit all over the place.
---
Well, people don't like when the baddies win.
---
Summer 2019 be like shitty memes?
---
Haha trying to get the content out !! Theres plenty of vendor items to go around :p
---
Still subbed. Not a big fan of retail, but it's still miles better than what else is around. Don't have a lot of time to play anyway so I don't get bored. Ideally I would like to down Azshara before Classic comes out, but not sure if the raid will be released fast enough.
---
I get what your saying but why is there still a deep passion for this game and not the other MMOs back then? It's because vanilla wows core game design is very rewarding and endlessly repayable, like dark souls.
---
Seeing your nemesis in the world or a BG, except they got new shoulders or something. And it's like "oh damn!", and you try your best to tell them grats by doing your best to kill the fucker because that new shit don't make you better than me now pal.
---
I thought MOP was dumb as fuck tbh. Quit after Wotlk, played a little cata and WoD then called it quits. 
---
It just felt like this constai grind to get to raid gear and then a new xpac would drop because I can't commit 4 hours a night to instances and raids.
---
Seriously, take a break from reddit. Go on a jog, interact with people and make friendly conversation. Do anything except dwell in classic wow sub reddit and troll people.
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/7T2R1eAIKnEJnAf5U8
---
Sky golem is egregious as fuck because it essientially gave everybody the ability to herb and fly you know like druids.
---
&gt; just a good quality one with a dedicated graphics card
---
I think we're misinterpreting each other. By "gaming" laptop all I mean is a laptop that is good enough to run games. What I meant by my original comment is mobile gpus have come a long way in terms of power efficiency and performance in the past couple years so it is much easier to get a laptop with good performance.
---
I've been unsubbed, playing on only classic/TBC private servers until Classic.
---
In a forum all about replaying a 14 year old game?
---
3 "plz"s
---
No. WoW is still fun. Classic should be better, though.
---
So true OP. Dark Souls is a fantastic trilogy - brutal, yet utterly fair and beautiful. Same for classic. I hope to fight alongside you one day
---
Vashj'ir, Spires of Arak, Storm Peaks, Howling Fjord, Western Plaguelands, Darkshore, and Netherstorm.
---
I don't care that I ignored the parameters of the question. The top three there are worth going out of your way for. Never skip quest text or dialogue. Write down your favorite lines and themes for when you make your own MMO. Don't let friends rush you through quests.
---
Yay for being Introverted?
---
Classic wow or umm? reading a book or another game, perhaps writing a story?
---
I need some high quality murloc ASMR
---
I bought a month just to hang with a friend, but yea I feel ya.
---
Step 1: macro abilities with correct stance 
---
Or
---
Use an add-on to automatically change to the correct stance when spamming the ability you want to use
---
It's also more polished than anything from back then, stuff like Everquest plays and looks like shit in comparison, even though I personally find those games more interesting.
---
Unsubbed since my 6 month thing ran out, didn't expect bfa to be so bad
---
I hate the chauffer. I'm trying to start a new character and enjoy the ambience, but I can't when a bunch of dickheads are buzzing around me in choppers trying to speed through the area as fast as possible
---
Hey thanks for the good idea. I might have to try somewhere in town and bum off their wifi.
---
Thank you I will try this. Town is about 45 minutes from me, but they have a burger king and a couple coffee shops i could try. thanks again!
---
Unsubbed after Uldir.  Officially not returning to modern WoW.  Can't wait for classic!
---
Is joke
---
I played on my dad‚Äôs account when I was 11, up until he decided he didn‚Äôt want to play anymore (he wasn‚Äôt much of a fan of the way WoW went either). I had a night elf hunter, and I‚Äôm 100% sure I sucked. I have no idea what half of these posts are referencing, but I‚Äôm excited ass hell to tool around with a new toon!
---
I got through all the BFA content and unsubbed. Became pretty stale. I play on a private server now.
---
Been unsubbed since end of cata
---
That‚Äôs stupid though, it‚Äôs THE difficulty in wow these days, there are multiple levels to account for the casuals or less skilled people, but still be able to challenge the best.
---
I actually like the post lol. I gave my girlfriend a heads up on the came coming up and am suspicious on how understanding she has been about it. I think its a ploy to get me to marry her
---
Same. This is the reason I am taking the day off when Classic releases so I can log in when it goes live minute zero. I don‚Äôt care about getting a head start on others, I just want my name (and a couple of alt names) to be available.
---
Whoa you blew my mind
---
ive had this name for years all i knew was it was russian in origin but
---
i didn't realize –∫–ª–µ—Ç–∫–∞ is kletka
---
Chain heal is basically a healbot built into the game code.
---
Bro he had a word count quota chill.
---
I have. 
---
It's slow and tedious, but it's far from difficult.
---
The raid encounters on heroic and mythic mode have better more complex mechanics. I wouldn't even say raids as a whole are infinitely better. Gearing and loot are ruined so the major incentive to raid has been diminished significantly. If all you're interested in is raid mechanics and mythic + dungeons then yeah BFA is playable, if you care about leveling, gearing, crafting, socializing, pvping, exploration, immersion, or really anything outside of raid mechanics then BFA is infinitely worse than classic.
---
...and mages
---
Quit since PvP Gear was randomized. Fuck that.
---
It really won't have that big of an effect but I can see it as being intimidating for a new player if everyone already knows everyone in every guy they join.
---
Tell me what you guys think...I am a bfa glad on retail playing boomy and i love the idea of druid pvp in vanilla. I plan on playing a true hybrid style, with a lot of casting and form switching. I have very little experience with vanilla druid outside private servers but I am wondering if it is worth sacrificing heart of the wild/feral charge for extra mana efficiency. I mostly focused on efficiency talents.
---
This is a great suggestion!
---
I'm happily engaged, but if I had a gf of less than 3 months I would dump them in a heartbeat for classic. A new relationship is not even comparable to classic wow
---
I mean, elves have had a *lot* of shitty stuff happen to them in general.  I dont even really blame them for being dicks to everyone else.
---
Always use a VPN  to connect, and share your account info so the "speed leveler" can catch others up while they're not online.  
---
(Ok, this isn't legal, so "don't" do it)
---
Interesting. What class did you play?
---
No cross-realm or sharding (except right at the beginning which is controversial as it is)
---
Server identity, being able to actually recognize those around you and usually interact with them over and over again on some level.
---
The talent tree is far superior to the talent system in retail in my (our) opinion.
---
You get a new talent point every level which leads to at least some power increase with each level.
---
You don't get teleported everywhere and actually have to spend time in the world and interacting with those in it, even while travelling. 
---
More RP, situational and niche skills along with more big cooldowns which can raise the skill ceiling of classes.
---
Items are more than just an ilvl. The stats on the items matter and a lot even have things like procs which aren't nearly as prevelent in the game anymore.
---
For those of us who enjoy tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, you can see a lot of similar RPG elements that you come to appreciate that were cast away throughout the expansions.
---
Can‚Äôt assume that others require what you find necessary to play. Because a lot of these people probably have necessity of those hours outside of gaming to fulfill their real lives, while conversely you or others may not require that time to feel fulfilled IRL. Give and take man. There‚Äôs no one size fits all.
---
You won‚Äôt get to DPS as a shaman in Vanilla outside of being the Nightfall-bot.  For PVE, if DPS is your end-game goal then I‚Äôd stay far away. 
---
For PVP - god yes. Awesome toolkit and absolutely worth it.
---
Yup, I feel the wow itch though but holding back from retail.
---
Priests can shackle those? (Or was that added later?) Also, if you have a good warlock who knows how to CC with fear/CoR and Seduce, you're g2g. Even better than a sub rogue with sap, or hunters traps.
---
Vanilla is not really known for hard rotations in PvE tho.
---
I love vanilla but the PvE side of things can get really freaking boring but the PvP in vanilla is miles ahead of retail in my opinion.
---
Now they hinder progress by drip feeding content in micro patches.
---
I think people are over the whole cheap wordpress website with standard plugins thing. Do modern guilds still do that? I think most just have discord and few shared google docs.  
---
  
---
Raid signups, calendars, dkp, loot council and whatever can all be tracked in game now I think?  
---
   
---
I'd be interested in hearing any people that have raided actively in a few guilds over the last 5 years what the standard way of doing things is.
---
Not as good at single target, but acceptable.
---
They are the masters of raid healing though.
---
I've been enjoying the random skills in the private server Ascension. Really interesting way to play wow.
---
Yeah, this subreddit... haha fuck
---
I enjoyed legion but quit BFA since all my friends quit.
---
But I did enjoy running mythics with friends and trying to push keys. We were not good by any means but it is fun to try coming up with strats and yelling at eachother when hell breaks lose.
---
I am super stoked for Classic but I will still probably play retail every now and then. Sure, it is not in the greatest state but I still enjoy it every now and then.
---
I keep seeing these classic wow/dark souls analogies and I don‚Äôt understand them at all lol. I just started playing dark souls 1 a few weeks ago. I guess the ceiling in WoW might be higher because of pvp, but the floor to succeed in dark souls is soooo much higher lol.
---
They won't be able to be tracked in classic I believe and I was thinking pre-launch maybe a way for people to find guild/people to play with and ways for a guild to get organized of saying hey I am going to play this class and so on
---
Unlikely that you'll have a Priest in the group if you're already the healer.
---
Also you can't fear/seduce/sap undead.
---
Lol yeah I always think of them as the lamest of the lame.
---
Unsubscribed because I actually have a job now - working 45 hours a week.
---
When classic comes out I‚Äôll probably stop work to 20‚Äì30 hours a week.
---
I don‚Äôt personally believe it is in the worst state it has ever been.
---
I‚Äôd give retail a passable grade - but I‚Äôm not interested in playing retail, now that classic WoW is coming out.
---
It seems pointless to gear my characters just to ignore them 3 months later.
---
I always get bombshelled  with dislikes when I say things like this.
---
But I think it is a fair opinion to have - you don‚Äôt need to hate retail to love classic.
---
+ it is getting released, there is no reason to sling poop to the other side - you both have your cake.
---
This sounds excatly similar to my situation, if youre rolling horde, I wouldnt mind guilding up or something with others in the same predicament.
---
That's just not true, if Classic is going to be different, it will be easier, not harder. Most bosses on private servers have higher armor, most of the content is buffed because its too easy for people who can spend 24/7 playing and min/maxing everything. Private servers also have progressive itemization, that means weaker items in the beginning, classic will be so much easier.
---
That is AMAZING! Kudos dude.
---
Ha, forgot about the immunity. Didn't Pally's have a fear undead?
---
Horde for life first.  Second reason though is Barrens chat 2.0 in classic wow.
---
Why?
---
RAF?
---
mobs in the keep in arathi, the peons or humans on the farms IIRC. Probably a few others like patrols in barrens etc.
---
So pessimistic
---
I've been dating the same girl for a year. It's gotten serious. So I am wondering if it might work to give her a ring a couple weeks before release, so I can buy a week or two of leveling. =D
---
Are you able to play WoW classic with gametime and not the subscription?
---
 Nice work on the vids lately Plat! I gravitate towards your stuff over everyone else‚Äôs because it‚Äôs original with some good comedy peppered in. One of the few sources of media that is original and not recycled garbage.
---
Obviously you have skill if you can play glad level, but its hard to rate your build when you both admit you've never really played much vanilla, and your "goal" is to be a hybrid.
---
I'd say most people would challenge a lot of your spec, with a lot of the criticism focused on WSG flag running ability. Like it or not that's a huge part of a druid's game at 60. You don't have 5/5 nature's grasp which is borderline mandatory, and losing things like thick hide gives up a lot of your strengths in your pursuit of being a true hybrid.
---
You're honestly closer to a traditional moonglow PVE spec to be honest than a typical PVP spec. 
---
The lazy answer would be "Thanks, I hate it" - but you probably need to expand more on your PVP goals (Why do you want to hybrid? 1v1 wpvp? Duels? 1vx?) before those more experienced can truly critique it.
---
From a pure BG perspective though I'd say it leaves a lot to be desired.
---
Remember that reddit doesn‚Äôt consist of 100% of the player base.
---
Unlikely that you have a Paladin in the group if you're a Shaman.
---
I agree
---
You have teammates in BGs
---
I played cataclysm and that was about it. I'm interested again to see if i'll enjoy it. But quick question, are you able to play WoW classic with gametime and not the subscription?
---
Pretty much what I do too
---
You didn‚Äôt like farming gold in your garrison over 10 toons?...
---
Pretty much all true except when it came to world bosses. Some guilds were really good at staying ontop of them.
---
I had ‚ÄòPandamonium‚Äô reserved as a name since TBC and told anyone who cared to listen I‚Äôd be playing a Panda Monk in the ‚Äònext‚Äô expansion, to much confusion usually.
---
Well, if you want to really min/max writing and lore I would first recommend either a Druid, Warlock, or Shaman. Druids and Warlocks seem to have the most lore around them. Warlocks have the slight edge in class quests but Druids have more interactions with NPCs such as the Cenarion circle, and the whole moonglade thing. 
---
For best writing in a zone I'd have to give it to Duskwood. There's a multitude of amazing quest chains there that I can't wait to replay. 
---
Westfall and Elwynn are good too for the Defias storyline.  
---
Eastern and Western Plague Lands are fantastic as well as they really pick up where WC3 TFT left off.
---
You saying that anything BFA has is harder than vanilla... Outta here with that dude
---
BfA is easily the worst that WoW has ever been from a gameplay perspective. The systems design is a garbage fire filled with feces.
---
It's pretty, though. Also fun to collect Xmog and mounts, I guess. If you actually want to play the game semi-seriously though, it's absolutely dreadful.
---
They didn't
---
im sorry i should have clarified that it focused on 1vx and Wpvp, what im most excited about. In WSG ill be switching to necessary build for FC. I appreciate the info tho! I dont want to use to much of what i know playing private servers because i have no idea if that is even what classic will be like in actuality
---
That is perfect. Thanks!
---
This fit perfectly into the direction that Blizzard was moving WoW for years.. eventually every class became generic AF.. 
---
I love WoW it was a part of my life for so long but nowadays it is so boring, have you noticed every class has a stun and a slow, a gap closer etc..
---
No class is unique, nowadays Blink = Charge = Dash = Fel Rush (every class has the same abilities reskinned)
---
I do the same thing with weed
---
I hate Dark Souls so I gotta disagree. I‚Äôm glad you like it though. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like Head Over Heels on the ZX Spectrum.
---
I had resubbed for like 3 or 4 months in legion then 1 month in bfa. I stopped playing WOW after mop
---
LK was pretty great, Cata had some good in it, the rest was pretty bad. I became a tourist afterwards, not a player.
---
I know LK was ez-mode compared to BC but overall it was a good expac.
---
I'll be more interested in who is subbed two months after launch. I don't see myself doing much more than the grind to 60 and seeing if I can grab Benediction before never caring about playing again. Knowing there's nothing beyond  Naxx just doesn't get me excited. It will always be the endgame, with nothing coming after, and even PVP getting exhaustively boring after no meta changes happen because "muh classic experience"
---
Thank you for your service!
---
You need feral charge, period.  You'll just make to make that happen somehow if you want to ever be able to dream of winning a 1v2.  It's an escape, it's a silence, it's a positioning tool, it's a root, it's a low cooldown, and it's free every time you shift into Bear with Ferocity.  It's a must have.
---
Are there mandatory hybrid talents you absolutely need no matter what playstyle in Wpvp/1vx? Even though a lot of people dont understand it I totally get what blizz was trying to do with druid in vanilla with certain talents in certain trees, really stressing the true hybrid playstyle. I see a lot of nay-sayers who really just look at the class based on specific roles and styles they want to fill.
---
Just buy caffeine pills. Each can of those drinks has only like 200mg(Varying) for 2-4$, you can get HUNDREDS of pills for 10$.
---
If you think its harder now than in vanilla i can tell you never played during classic, or bc or even wotlk for that matter. How can you also call a game hard that tells you every boss inside and out. I can't wait for classic to roll around and all these people saying retail is hard... oh boy you're in for a treat! :D
---
They would be added to the horde in TBC with the blood elves if anything as the blood elves and naga allied up in WC3 and as someone said in another comment they would be shunned by the night elves.
---
Obviously at least one of their racials would be faster swim speed/longer underwater breathing.
---
Maybe even faster regen/a spirit buff while in water.
---
+5 to polearms since they like to use tridents
---
Classed would probably be Warrior, Shaman, Mage, Warlock and maybe priest or druid.
---
If druid they could be a sea lion instead of a bear and maybe a crawler instead of a cat.
---
It might be a little OP but I could see them using a water strider as a mount.
---
Trolling the occasional neanderthal is something I can do for fun in a couple of minutes in between important stuff. 
---
And in a sense maintaining a healthy on-line gaming community by reprimanding the jerks *is* important, because if you let them think they own the place you end up with stupid things like gamergate. Think of it like picking up rubbish. If everyone picks up a little bit of rubbish here and there every now and again we all get a nice, clean community to live in.
---
I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth reserving ‚ÄòPandamonium‚Äô. I did that in TBC first go round.

I deployed in 04 while in the Marines in Iraq. game was released just after I got back and EAS of feb 05, so perfect timing. We had some shitty net cafe's but I spent by time in a humvee sleeping on the tailgate, so no games for me lol I was into Daoc at the time.

&gt; Entangling Roots doesn't have any diminishing returns
---
Yes it does.

&gt; Patch 1.7.0 (patch date:2005-09-22): Entangling Roots now shares the same duration in pvp as other long-duration forms of crowd control (ie: polymorph, fear, sap).

is that more of an american thing? genuinly curious, i'm from scandinavia and we always say summer is june 1st &gt; august 31st, and i thought this was the norm in the rest of europe too. looking it up online it says "The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere" I guess in some countries this is the more commonly used definition?
---
I'm in total agreement with you there
---
Damn that makes a lot of sense. If I played a boomy build with feral charge...ill have to give up natures swiftness. I see alot of really beneficial talents in balance like master shapeshifter (MS) and moon glow. Is nature Swiftness mandatory as well and will it cause mana problems with all the form switching without MS?
---
I think there‚Äôs a good chance of finding a GIRL
---
I'd argue it's even worse now for the bleeding edge hardcore players. Preach calls it the "Mythic Raider tax", basically forcing you to grind ever-increasing amounts of AP, which is about the most monotonous thing in the game currently.
---
There was a time not too long ago when you could be a world top 100 raider and only log on for raid nights, and maybe a few hours per week to gather consumables. These days you need hours and hours to grind M+ and AP, on top of a grueling raid schedule and split raiding periods.
---
Gearing in BfA is just a travesty at the moment. All RNG, no effort-based rewards, no player choice or agency. It's trash.
---
I mean to be fair they kind of fixed that, making classic content scale with you from 1-60 means that you aren't out leveling a zone once you've done a quarter of its content any more.
---
TBC was absolutely amazing, but it was the expansion that started a lot of the things that are now seen as the community killers or otherwise decline of the game. It worked in TBC because it was only the dipping your toes in stages of those functions (dailies, flying, separate world, new city, lfg, etc) but in hindsight everything I came to hate in WoW has it's roots in TBC.
---
‚Äòseems like‚Äô - exactly what I was thinking
---
Yes, but also lower attack speed (affecting frenzy), it can't take bite, and if it spends focus on screech it can't dump claw as well. It's not much but there's a solid argument that slightly faster clear speeds and better pvp win out over the tankiness of the owl.
---
Honestly it's mostly personal preference unless you are really trying to hyper optimize, but at that point you're definitely going cat for kill speed. You're better off using whichever pet you think is most comfortable, since Hunter leveling is really an endurance game of zero downtime grinding.
---
&gt;high quality
---
I got you fam https://youtu.be/bul9E3myozM
---
You‚Äôd really want to get heart of the wild, 5/5 in furor and put the rest in balance if you want to be able to do any damage. All those points in resto hardly help you at all, just minor buffs to heals/mana and a CD for 1 insta cast spell.
---
You gonna be raiding 6 days a week and take 1 day to appreciate your other half? Romance truly isn‚Äôt dead.
---
I tagged one of those dragons as a level 40 something.  BOE tier 0 shoulders dropped...sold those for somewhere around 40g.
---
I don't really get it. Why do you feel the need to put exactly 2 points into Feral Instinct? Is there a stealth level breakpoint I'm unaware of?
---
Same thing with all the other points you only partially invest into. Why do you value 1 point in Improved Nature's Grasp more than Improved Wrath? Not saying it's wrong, but I'd like to hear your thought process behind it.
---
I'm all for hybrid builds, but this to me seems like you want to do a little bit of everything, but not "specializing" in anything at all. What kind of gear will you use with this? Feral?
---
You've specced some points into improving your ability to melee, but not enough to squeeze out anything significant out of any form in perticular. Some of the points are for imporiving healing touch, some for rejuvenation and yet you chose to skip more meaningful talents that will improve your healing even more.
---
I think you're better off picking 1 or 2 "roles" and invest more into that than trying to fulfill everything.
---
Caster with healing capabilities is possible, restobear is an option, castercat could be done if you manage to find some weird combination of gear that works for you. 
---
I'd recommend Heart of the Wild / Nature's swiftness, Moonglow Resto, Deep Feral Cat or even 19/11/21 world pvp focused clown build.
---
Like the poster above suggested, **feral charge** is pretty much mandatory. You don't have kick, silence, pummel....etc. The utility out of it for 1 point (really 11) is massive. VERY early on in vanilla it was common to see x/11/x specs for PVP, just because its very hard to be unhappy with those 11 points. Thick hide is great, imp bash gets you a very useful bash-&gt;regrowth combo, and ferocity is decent.
---
**Furor** is probably mandatory, one because its a tier 1 talent, and two because it really is essential for playing to the druid's style. It's not quite as class defining as TM is for warriors but its damn close.
---
Beyond that i'd say it gets tricky, and you're out of "mandatory" and more playstyle specific. I ran 9/11/31 in early vanilla and I was largely happy as i could survive in PVE and PVP, but i felt less happy with my return on investment in the resto tree versus how much I got out of early balance and early feral, if that makes sense.
---
CoH is like that too
---
Daoc was fire tho
---
Others have said it but definitely go with the novels.
---
I'm guessing late August/early Sept.  Beta will probably be out by end of May, and typically it's about 3mo or so between a beta and release for WoW expacks.
---
Not to be that guy but the mods on this sub are the worst of all subreddits I follow. They remove good content all the time. They need to lighten up because it‚Äôs holding this sub back.
---
I've been farming tokens the last month after a 4 or 5 month hiatus. Sub stopped today but I'll probably take a week before subbing to farm more. They're all going to classic.
---
&gt; Are the new expansions really that bad?
---
Mythic Raids in BFA make Vanilla-WOTLK raids look like leveling dungeons.
---
Started vanilla hoping one day to kill the Arthas. Ended up disappointed he had to/could be killed in 10 man too. Killed him on 25, quit one week later before bothering with hc.
---
[insert Simpsons meme: stop it, he's already dead]
---
Will be dm'ing you after work.
---
&gt; Bro its bad... Everything is faceroll.
---
Link me your fucking Mythic Ghuun/Jaina, liar.
---
What‚Äôs the hype about any game? Or film? Book, music, play, afternoon spent with friends? 
---
Please explain as I‚Äôm trying to understand.
---
You want feral charge. Oh God do you want feral charge.
---
No.
---
Possibly the worst spec I have ever seen.
---
With sanctuary and holy shield, I'd rather have a shield. I might not be killing too many ranged that way, but thorns damage alone will help kill the average melee. Besides that I'll just be a super tanky healer.
---
&gt; Many semi-hardcore guilds clear Mythic before the next tier with 9 hours a week of raiding.
---
Can confirm, my guild does 2 days of raiding and we got Cutting Edge Ghuun.
---
Comparing the top-end content in Vanilla and the top-end content in BfA, it isn't even close, lol.
---
In Vanilla, you could get into a guild that would clear content at a reasonable pace while still:
---
*  Not using addons. 
---
*  Not using keybinds.
---
*  Not using any kind of optimization spreadsheet.
---
*  Not being aware of the ideal rotation for your class.
---
*  Not using consumables.
---
Those things are considered *the minimum* in BfA. Even casual guilds will expect you to check the above boxes.
---
You could ask every player across every top-end guild in World of Warcraft right now -- including players that have been raiding for 15 years -- and you wouldn't find a single person that agrees with you. Vanilla raiding was easy. Naxx will be regularly pugged within a week or two of its release.
---
The same goes for PvP. I've played Warlock/Rogue/Druid since Vanilla. The average player is way better at PvP now -- and messing up is way more punishing than it ever was.
---
I love Vanilla. I'm eagerly awaiting Classic WoW and I'm not subbed to BfA -- but these kind of opinions are just wrong, dude. Classic WoW was actually genuinely an easy game. Even BC was easy compared to the recent expansions -- and BC greatly increased the game's difficulty across the board.
---
&gt; Please don‚Äôt listen to this guy, he is blindsiding you and parroting a very, very dumb opinion on here that the game is easy.
---
It's not even an opinion, it's outright false.
---
You and the thousand others who have posted theirs lol
---
&gt; Mythic is an extra higher level for hardcore players
---
1500 guilds have killed Mythic Ghuun before next tier. Most of those 1500 raid 2 nights. That's not hardcore.
---
Solid wisdom
---
Glad but you don‚Äôt realize the important of feral charge?
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to get motes of air!‚Äù
---
Oh so many painful memories...
---
I‚Äôm still surprised about this assumption about a summer release. They could release it on 31st December and it‚Äôd still be summer here.
---
&gt; When they were birthed they killed their father
---
Them's some strong babies
---
Yeah, this is ultimately what made me quit. I'm a casualcore player myself -- I can dump a ton of hours into the game when an expansion comes out, but then work/family/friends/other games/etc. catches up and I have to limit my playing to 2 - 3 days a week.
---
Up until around Cataclysm, it was possible to do that and still raid. Sometime during Cataclysm though, the raid difficulties started to spread further apart until you basically had to be in a relatively hardcore guild to see cutting edge content.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of Mountain Standard Time. Sounds like you just made it up.

Hi, /u/EurOblivion
---
No I think it‚Äôs you that never played basically any versions of wow at a competitive level. I raided naxx in vanilla, attempted (never killed prepatch) Yogg+0 in wrath and have done some heroic raiding in every expansion after Wotlk.
---
WoW was EXTREMELY easy in vanilla, I remember clearing MC with literally 32~ people, you didn‚Äôt even need a full raid. The hardest part of vanilla was that people had no idea about min maxing, even rotations were considered a ‚Äòhardcore‚Äô ideal for the early parts.
---
You really shouldn‚Äôt comment on things you have NO understanding on, leave that to the people who don‚Äôt sound like idiots.
---
WoW was most people's first MMO which will always affect MMO player's perspectives. It was also the most popular MMO ever, even in it's vanilla state at the time.
---
There is also a deep passion for other, older MMOs. Look at OSRS. It's extremely popular. Project 1999 is also decently popular. DAoC has the Phoenix server which is pretty popular. It's just that the population in those games at time of retail were so tiny compared to the behemoth of WoW.
---
...you killed one boss in heroic amd are saying its too easy? People will pug Molten Core and clear it too.
---
Raiding had never been harder than it is right now. Vanilla raids are laughably easy compared to raiding the last few expansions
---
Warlock is the best. Hunter second, then Mage.
---
Keep an eye out for twink drops. I‚Äôm thinking a lot more people will run an alt twink this time round.
---
For sure. I‚Äôm looking forward to everything Vanilla, but it also warms my heart knowing in 3 or so years I could be doing Karazhan again. And not that fucked up dissapointment they put in Legion :/
---
yea my problem is I want to do too much of everything i guess. I put 2 pts in feral instinct because I was told at least 2 pts helps for stealth detection purposes. perhaps i am underestimating prowl on its own. I have 1 pt in improved natures grasp because I didnt want to dump 5 pts into 100% and i figured 50% chance would be fine. I assume that I could get it to proc after a couple hits at most if not instant anyways. I will be using int/SP gear with crit. Rejuv I will always have up when taking dmge so i figured i get the most out of it with the improved talent...i really only put pts in imporved healing touch for the NS talent. After playing with the calculator a little more i came up with [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0uoxhMLZxG0oZyx0ofo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0uoxhMLZxG0oZyx0ofo). I guess you would call it wpvp clown build xD
---
Man I‚Äôm getting hammered today with downvotes for defending BfA, a game I don‚Äôt even like but there are SO MANY stupid ‚Äòfacts‚Äô being spread around here, stupidity isn‚Äôt an excuse to spread lies!

I am a boomy retail. always have always will be

What's the difference between gametime and a subscription? Classic is just a different type of server. If you can play WoW, you can play WoW Classic.
---
Vanilla is like playing Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures compared to the MMOs before it. Brutal is not a word I would use for vanilla wow. 
---
I'd say it's more challenging than retail WoW in a lot of aspects except for anything past normal mode raiding. Chewing gum while walking is harder than 90% of retail WoW, though and more entertaining.
---
I think I played vanilla, but was super young. Will definitely be my first time playing through tho. I still don‚Äôt know what class I should be haha
---
...welcome to what a friend of mine argued, (and was shunned for) during 2006/7.

Have you played any MMO from before WoW?
---
We're seemingly so close to release after having waited so long, yet we don't know for certain just how much longer we'll have to wait. I'm gonna be honest, if it actually is a late August or September release that's going to suck, I don't want to have to limit my playtime from the get go because classes start.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I have to poke fun.  This is what Glads have turned into lol. 
---
In all seriousness if you‚Äôre trying to play a pvp boomkin look up stormx.  Unless you‚Äôre just going for a general druid pvp spec, then go hotw
---
Yes, but that's the trade you're choosing to make by focusing more on the boomkin side for Damage.  What makes Druids balanced are that they lack burst damage and CC.
---
If you want to pick up burst you're going to be forced to drop survivability.  NS is an amazing ability.  NS + healing touch crits is instant full HP, for you or an ally.  Instant resurrection which is seriously OP but niche. Instant root or hibernation against Shaman, Druids or pets which is fantastic CC in certain situations.
---
Here's a cookie cutter Balance PvP build to compare and get you going in the right direction.

It appears i may have put together the worst spec you guys have ever seen lmao xD but im glad it got a discussion rolling im really learning a lot about vanilla druid so i appreciate the responses
---
It‚Äôs funny you say that, WoW and Dark Souls (in that order) are my 2 favorite games, hands down.
---
I think it was Kargoz YouTube video that showed you are faster using wolf form (with talents) than your mount unless you plan on travelling across an entire zone. So, yeah don‚Äôt even worry about buying a mount.
---
Blind fanboyism.
---
Thats okay he said 9 million other players are aswell. Same here
---
Yeah I work full time in Law Enforcement and I am back to school for Cyber security, so that would suck for me too. I just hope they drop a good bombshell and say here it is pretty soon
---
I unsubbed when they closed down Nost and I resubbed when they announced classic and have stayed subbed since.
---
I want my main to have a serious fitting name for their class, Paladin. My mage is gonna be Dopaminus, like on one Voldemort server. And then the alts are gonna be whatever goofy or hashtag deep name I come up with at the moment.
---
I didn't. Maybe it's because I skipped MoP-cyrrent wow but I'm having a good amount of fun with the game in it's current state.
---
‚ÄúI wish that I could beat a shadow priest in a duel.‚Äù
---
lol chill dawg... wow is obv way different now than it was. vanilla and retail are two different games. I know the basic vanilla cookiecutters for druid  im really just fucking around trying to think outside the box a little no matter how shitty it looks idc
---
*pops Bestial Wrath* Smaaaaaashing
---
yes exactly.
---
That'd do it :P

After thinking about it more I can see some potential in this! I made an edit to my previous post. You'd be the most annoying player to meet in the battlefield for sure.

That‚Äôs actually kind of sweet. Carry on their legacy and don‚Äôt be a dick!

&gt; Buying stuff helped make the vanilla warrior leveling experience a little less brutal at times. Feels good to go wreck a group of mobs that gave you so much trouble.
---
Best to save up the money and just team up instead.

This is my recommendation for a True Hybrid PvP build.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0LhMmZxG0oZVEooco
---
Following your advice! Thanks OP!
---
Hehe yea... joking...
---
Try the monster juice mango loco. It's really good
---
i have played a hunter and i agree with you, i also will not be playing a hunter because ive done everything on a hunter on a pserver, i will be going a rogue. but i might make a hunter second! 
---
great post !
---
Great advice not just for WOW but for life.
---
You have obviously matured and gained wisdom over the years thank you for sharing
---
yo that build looks wet, def gonna try it out
---
Many. DAOC, EQ, SWG,
---
Damn shame I missed it. I came back towards the end of Pandaria for the Siege of Org and then kind of burned out mid-WoD.
---
oh no, they're on to me!
---
To be honest I am half tempted to, if only because I want to film some stuff and put it on Youtube. For instance, I managed to solo the Sunken Temple Hunter quest ( you gotta kill the 2 drakes ) and I could find no Youtube guide for it so maybe I'll make my own.
---
Also most Hunter PvP videos on Youtube are junk. I could do a few.
---
Then again, the Rogue life calls to me, too.
---
I normally sub in 6 months. Or else I would not be subbed right now.
---
BFA has been a pretty big disappointment. Sad part is if it had been a singleplayer game that was complete from the start it would actually have been pretty good. But as an MMO there is absolutely nothing worth loggin on for most weeks.
---
Complete retard checking in here
---
If by the end of my 50 year life I have enjoyed 90% of my waking life, is it not better than to have lived to be 100 yet only enjoyed 10%?
---
Nearly every waking moment of my life is sweet comfy bliss, no responsibilities or forced activities of any kind. I shit eat sleep and play video games. I am truly free.
---
I'll take that until I have a heart attack over most these people's lives any day.
---
How long do you expect to be subbed to Classic?
---
Not trying to be snarky, just asking out of genuine curiosity for how long Classic WoW will keep us playing.
---
&gt; Leveling is a part of the game instead of an extremely long intro to the actual game.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; There's a continuous world, instead of fractured and forgotten continents that don't matter.
---
To expand on this, the questing from Vanilla no longer exists. BC, WOTLK, CATA, MOP, WOD, Legion, BFA... The levelling quests will always exist. The Vanilla quests were erased from existence.
---
Except there is no 'discovery' because we know all this stuff going in. It's not fun if every hunter uses Lupos because he is objectively better than every other pet.
---
Not specifically you, it could be anyone lol
---
if i plan on playing an arms warrior, could i potentially get the whirlwind axe at level 30-32 if I have three friends with me? We all plan on leveling together in a group so we will be around the same level.
---
Also, why is the whirlwind axe so valuable, are weapons like the ravager or mograines might not better?
---
I unsubbed in 2008 (just before WotLK) because WoW was negatively affecting my studies (I'd been playing since 2005 and had managed to fuck up a lot of exams and schoolwork).
---
I came back at the tail-end of MoP, played one month of that, then one month into WoD... got bored, came back to Legion for a month and then, surprise surprise, also played BFA for a month.
---
So I guess I'm a bit of a sucker in that I keep giving Blizz money for each of their crappy expansions, but I enjoy the leveling and the new areas so I feel mostly satisfied up to the point that it just gets boring.
---
Saucy, saucy starfires!
---
I'd imagine you'd get more value out of having more points into crit damage or more healing, but proccing a stun on a starfire seems even more annoying.
---
but who were you?
---
Welcome to the club
---
Bring it bitch

ffs...
---
&gt;you would be an idiot to not prioritize her over Classic WoW.

Why? Because you say so?

---
\&gt;reduce my wow time to 1 hour for some girl who i will probably not end up with
---
LOL no thx
---
I main tanked while in Qatar back in 2012-14 time frame off the Wi-Fi on base. I've heard they have started doing service installations in the rooms now and its only better... Still going to depend on the deployment location.
---
Personally man, in my mind I also don't consider the TBC lore to be cannon. My head cannon is WC3, Vanilla, and WoTLK.
---
Very much this. We spent how many years with the threat of the legion looming so i had to know how Legion went! and WoD seemed cool that we were going to Draenor! They never kept me around but it was fun to level and hear the story
---
My favorite part of this sub is everyone losing their shit daily.
---
Classic raids are dogshit and i love raiding so that's why im subbed to retail
---
where are the cigar ashes
---
‚ÄúI like to make cheap jabs at people by posting shit like r/ihavesex
---
Oh my God, so many humans!
---
I agree I love hunters, however I am even more of a shill and prefer BM. I played classic in 05 &amp; 06 and I love BM for the PvP and ability to solo my way through things most couldn't. I am planing on leveling a priest first with my brother. But whenever he isn't online I'll be leveling a nelf hunter haha.
---
Just remember WoW avatars aren‚Äôt related..so to your hearts desire bang away
---
This is amazing advice, and very mature. Now, if only I was still in a relationship :'(. Though I am working on getting ripped.
---
I played BFA for 2 months after a LONG hiatus.  
---
Fucking sucked. 
---
Then I started up private servers. Leveled a warrior to 60 with BiS pre raid.  Then I realized it was all for nothing.
---
That fucking sucked too.
---
So you didn't clear end game vanilla, sounds like nothing in bc, then barely anything in wotlk. And you're trying to compare it to end game now and end game back then. Im actually laughing my ass off.
---
Meanwhile in Vanilla:
---
Frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt,
---
Once you get pre-BiS gear there's no point staying BM. It does way less DPS than MM, relies on the pet ( which is gonna be dead in a lot of fights if you keep it in melee ) and doesn't properly scale with gear, so it's less rewarding when you get better gear.
---
20/31 or something like that was the standard for PvE.
---
For PvP you'd be better off with a build that has both Scatter Shot and Intimidation.
---
I can't wait to see all the people saying how hard retail is and then going to classic. You're gonna have a rough time getting out the starting zones let alone out of barrens.

This might be what im looking forward to most.  I actually started in Wrath, and things were easier then, but even at that time (and with help) it took over a month (with a LOT of playing) to get to level 80.
---
I really love leveling, but its just so meaningless on live.  Its fast/easy, and theres so few 'rewards' without talent trees, etc.  It just gets so monotonous, outside of the quests/zones changing around you.
---
No but I wish I had more time to put toward classic, maybe not to this extreme but I do miss the simpler times back hen I was a kid
---
Hi, I'm Orcwarrior the Gnome Warlock.

Not all heroes wear deodorant.
---
Who TF has time to play 3 hours a day?
---
If they are redoing the gates of aq event again they will have to find a way for everyone to be in the same zone without lag.
---
Been unsubbed for over a year. Didn‚Äôt even buy the latest expac.
---
Back in BC my cousin fell for this girl he met. They met in a dungeon and were "together" for about 3 months. One day when I read his messages, I messaged the person. She ended up being a dude. Poor guy. To this day I still make fun of him.
---
Stfu
---
When they ruined the Loch is when I lost interest tbh.
---
Why not live 100 and enjoy every day of it too? Yikes that mentality
---
Bag. Buy bags first. Decent ones too. This will help tremendously, thank me later.
---
You did better than me, I logged out right after hitting 111 lol
---
It's kinda pointless though.
---
...and listen to the outcry as Mages/Warlocks/Priests flip out when you take +healing/int/spirit gear, or Warriors as you take plate, or hunters as you take mail...  
---
All of this regardless of whether or not you state your intended loot table prior to the start, of course.
---
I‚Äôve played this entire expansion up until this most recent raid tier.
---
Honestly I never raided, and I probably won't on this hunter either. As for PvP I honestly could 1v1 anyone except paladins, and so few people ran BM I honestly think they didn't know how to react once my humar went giant and red and started mauling them senseless. 
---
No offence, but not everyone is looking for advice on how to build on these forums, I know BM isn't viable raiding, I just really enjoyed the flavour of BM and didn't really wanna be another cookie cutter hunter.
---
Sometimes a judgement, 6 second stun, or BoP is far more effective than a heal. js.
---
Today you will learn what TIL means.
---
Then you'd realize that leveling a warr on fresh isnt really hard
---
I didn't known about the ponytail thing. Am 100% a female dwarf pally now. 
---
Plus. Fuck the ugly faces. Just wear a helmet. It's like a paper bag!
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound so bad until you get to your last sentence. Leveling with no talents and no new skill upgrades just seems dull as heck. Why did they ever remove these?
---
Someone at my work won a lifetime supply of Redbull years ago. Lifetime supply defined as two cases of regular and two cases of sugar free once a month. He elected to get the Redbull delivered to our office since he didn't think he could ever drink it all himself. 
---
He hasn't worked at the company for years and the Redbull still comes every month. None of my coworkers are that interested in it so I just take home one of the sugar free cases every month. It's amazing.
---
Okay officially i misread the datamined info
---
But the devs have started alpha testing and beta entry has appeared in the CDN
---
So i can feel safe saying
---
Doubt it. Beta will be this summer
---
I was subbed through nearly the entirety of vanilla, and a good portion of BC, before stopping in mid wrath.  So I could probably be happy playing for a year or two if the game will let me.
---
This made me lol
---

---
Love the video bro. Check out my channel as well would love to know what ya think
---
Just look at what that korasuma guy is saying just below, has to be a troll account right?
---
It‚Äôs honestly a bit worrying that people think vanilla is going to be difficult, if that‚Äôs the reason they are playing they won‚Äôt be hanging around for very long.
---
Hahah thats amazing
---
Do what you‚Äôre going to have most fun with! Leveling is a large portion, you don‚Äôt want to be not enjoying that if that‚Äôs how you feel about a warrior. Unless he tanking component offsets that, maybe go Shammy.
---
I think it's a matter of perception. Your hybrids could be just as easily annoyed. Especially if there are players who pass up on the group simply because they want to DPS instead of heal.
---
oh ok thanks, i didn't know if there was a difference or not?
---
I've seen a few players do quite well in PvE this way
---
Mate you realise there‚Äôs literally only handfuls of people who cleared Naxx right, and that Yoggsaron is considered one of the hardest bosses ever in wow? Less than 1% of people would have done those, and most people who say they even got close are lying.
---
Thax/Thux - Mal‚ÄôGanis - Validus
---
If you really want to be a feral tank you should just do it. The hardest part will be finding a guild. Vanilla has so much other content that a normal person playing 3 hours in the evening should be entertained for months before raiding becomes the best way to improve your character. At that point you may not even bo into tanking anymore.
---
Good luck
---
Luckily in vanilla, you couldn't actually see another player's spec. So unless you used an ability that gives it away, nobody really knows...
---
It‚Äôs pretty fucking tedious only using two zones and random dungeon ques for 1-60.
---
I literally just *mentioned* one of popular private servers the other day and they removed my comment automatically. I appealed to the mods and they didn't respond. So absurd. I wasn't encouraging or advertising anything... I was just having a conversation.
---
I never hit 60 in classic. I got to 53 and burned out and made a 19 twink. I went to check and I have 26 days played on her, 22 days on the level 53. I leveled up many professions and played thousands of rounds of warsong gulch, but never raided. I started over on a new server in TBC and did pug raiding at max level, but was in a guild with college buddies and never did serious content. Ended up quitting within hours of hitting level 80 in wrath. Came back for legion and BFA and quit again. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the late game PVE side of classic.
---
I'm down with this but they'd need a different way to deal with griefing.
---
If you call a graphics programmer an artist then yes there are artists on board.
---
What he meant is there are no 3d modelers/texture artists on board since it's not needed in the recreation of Classic.
---
Orc rogue named Angwe
---
I‚Äôve been arguing with this guy all day, don‚Äôt even bother, he‚Äôs honestly either a troll or a person who has never played wow before. 
---
There were healers in my guild in MC who would literally click spells out of their spell book. He‚Äôs trying to compare MC, a raid you could practically kill with a half full raid, to mythic raiding. Absolutely has no idea what he‚Äôs in about.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt normally care to argue with idiots, but people like this are going to hurt classic wow. I‚Äôm not as optimistic as most people here, I think it may struggle to keep people interested because they are so used to instant gratification these days in gaming and people with elitist attitudes (with nothing to back it up btw) will just push casual people away.
---
Cannon is anything Blizzard wants it to be, sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Blood elves on horde never made much sense. Extremely out of character. It was essentially blizzard forcing feminisation onto the horde, at the expense of both the story and our faction identities. TBC was when it really began to go wrong
---
I think I might make a Hunter as an alt actually. Sounds super fun!
---
Yup. They never replied to me when I sent them a message a week or so ago.
---
They really are though. They talk down to people as if they have any sort of real power besides being able to delete someone‚Äôs comment from a forum. The fact that they do it for free is embarrassing. Reddit must be saving a bunch of money by convincing people to moderate their forums for free
---
Isn't everything pointless?
---
Been unsubbed for almost 4 years now.
---
Blue haired (long, parted in middle style) Night Elf male rogue. They‚Äôre like gnats.
---
Probably high level Enchants or bags
---
Thrall is a caulk blocker
---
Same. But i imagine there will be a queue for most, including myself so my dreams of reserving names like Tom, Bob, etc are dim
---
Rogue dps isn‚Äôt good in BC ?
---
They don‚Äôt necessarily need to be removed. It could be that you don‚Äôt start getting dishonorable kills till you kill the same npc 2 or 3 times within x amount of time. This way, you could raid a town or city just fine, but it would discourage camping some npc to the point where the enemy can‚Äôt use it for hours.
---
Has it become unpopular option to like them?  I think they're pretty great.
---
I'm not sure slaughtering civilians without penalty is the kind of dynamic feel I can get behind.
---
I swift axe to the face
---
Throwing in my 2 copper, but I hope for a shot at reserving names that are common. RL names like Tom or Joe, and of course my character names. I‚Äôll make a list so i can spam the char select screen and maybe i‚Äôll get lucky. 
---
But we‚Äôll most likely get hit with a sizable queue so I‚Äôm not sure what to do.
---
I had a girlfriend that played league of legends with me and when I told her I was getting back into wow she said to not do that because she doesn‚Äôt want to be dating a loser.
---
Free trips to spirit healer
---
But it being a joke doesn't make it not also true. Lmao. Does a statement intended to be humorous suddenly invalidate any and all truth behind it?
---
Well I might not be giving out items for quite a while, not until I hit 60 and start levelling up my tailoring or alchemy, but I'll be sure to toss on a fortitude buff to any adventurer I cross paths with!
---
Could Classic be the answer to the Fermi Paradox?
---
That'd take a priest for MC
---
Yep, I leapt into BfA but after getting to level 117, wondered why I was wasting my money on a subscription. I even tried levelling a void elf, to experience 1-60 again, but the levelling experience is just so dang different. 
---
Can't wait till Classic comes out and I'll have a reason to resub :)
---
This has got to be the most beta shit I've ever read.
---
If ever in doubt, no changes.
---
This is some next level introspection. Good on you m8. We‚Äôre all gonna make it brah
---

---
Yeah as much as I hate on retail wow as a now ffxiv player waiting for Classic. Their raid design is fucking amazing. Ffxiv alternated between a 8 man raid with 4 separate boss battles with the fourth Having a special boss encounter, and a alliance raid which is 24 man without a hard mode but is one continuous dungeon. While they knocked it out of the park In stormblood with the ivalice alliance raids (and I'm so looking forward to YoRah the dark apocalypse: designed by the guy who made Neir automata.) They just dont have the same "feel" as a wow raid.
---
M+ is a really cool system that is implemented in a way that burdens the playerbase and makes raiding obsolete, particularly in a world without Tier sets. I like that 5mans are relevant again, but they're *too* relevant now, to the point that you get geared faster through M+ than through raiding.
---
Plus it's just more RNG lootboxes. RNG lootboxes are one of the primary reasons I quit.
---
This! It really generated a positive discussion about the issue. My 2 cents would be definitely give it a real shot. If you‚Äôre halfway through the STV levels and aren‚Äôt in for keeps, you‚Äôll know.
---
...you can
---
To also add on to what Minkelz said, Classic is a lot less complex than BFA. I don't mean from a players perspective, but from the games/servers perspective. They've already said that they've turned down the spell batching speed (meaning the server is resolving completed spells less often = less work), as well as a level 120 in BFA can easily have upwards of like 30-40 different buffs/effects on them at a time from things like the Azerite gear and such, which really doesn't happen all that often in Classic. I think that the amount of work the server will have to do per player will be a lot less, which means that you can have more players together before you start running into problems.
---
I was pretty much the teenage version of this guy. That was at the tail end of Vanilla/BC/Wrath. 10 years later, I don't want to go back to being this guy, but fuck do I want to play Classic. If I do though I don't know how good I'll be at moderating myself...
---
It‚Äôs going back to our roots. What made us love the franchise in the first place. The ability to go back and attempt to relive the best memories most of us had gaming. Classic is everything.
---
lol
---
Generally I agree with your statement above. A community absolutely needs to come together and chip in to maintain a healthy status. Only you‚Äôre the rubbish we‚Äôre trying to clean up. Your comments are getting downvoted for a reason.
---
What is your class and race, maybe we can make some suggestions.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping people don't rush it. I won't be in a particular hurry to power-level to 60 and, when I get there, I'm going to be focused on collecting fun items, gaming the AH, running dungeons for BiS, leveling professions and then moving on to casual raiding. So I am hoping vanilla will last me at least a year :)
---
Ehhhhhhhhhh
---
Yeah but she's probably ugly lol
---
I‚Äôm thinking about going Druid, but from what I‚Äôve read there seems to be kind of a negative stigma surrounding them. I would totally go resto and heal in pVE, but in PVP I‚Äôd love to do a little damage. Do people  ever do a split of resto and feral for PVP?
---
Even worse are the guys who aren‚Äôt mods but act like it. I‚Äôll be stoked when the game is out and I‚Äôm not dealing with trolls and mods.
---
"(She doesn't have a choice, but you have to make them think they're in charge... NOBODY SHOW MY WIFE THIS POST)"
---
Love it.
---
Yeah legendaries were fucking garbage. I couldn't even dps because I never got the right tanking legs and thus never got to switch loot specs. And of course other players of my class had them so they would by default so 30k dps more than me or sometimes even more than that.
---
I am hoping June, wouldn't be surprised if it happened in Sept.
---
How much +SP gear even is there before 40, or even before 60?
---
September hopefully
---
Lmao, people still believing we'll get classic this summer. Calling it now, it'll be after summer or @ xmas
---
Wouldn't be surprised with September at this point.
---
I was hoping for July 16, but with no date announced it's looking grim.
---
Ignorance is bliss.
---
August seems reasonable to me.
---
But we have no clue how hard they've been pushing since all those demo issues were reported in limited play. If devs have been spot on cranking through things, and better detailed in their work through later zones. then testing phases could be quicker. 
---
Really until they give us a detailed status update, it's all speculation. I'm surprised they went so quiet on status updates after a couple big detailed articles. They've discussed key topics, but not really general progress as far as I know.
---
NO CHANGES
---
From what I've read it is perfectly possible to allow an event like that to happen and have it go smoothly on the current infrastructure if they choose to.
---
Retail servers are apparently broken down into shards that are shared with other servers. With so many shards existing at once they can only allocate so much server strength to each one which is why they are not geared to handle things like city raids since they are specifically designed for less traffic.
---
If this is true, then it's pretty shitty on their part since it's just a matter of saving money. 
---
I still feel like they wouldn't get away with this in Classic though since the world won't be sharded and they will see these events coming ahead of time.
---
yikes
---
I'm almost 30 and married.
---
I no longer care for sex. Or parties/clubs. Or even alcohol really.
---
And beaches have always bored me.
---
Apparently. Our dumbasses couldnt google for my achievement run in wrath on the horde leaders. None of us had rolled horde before, so yes you have backdoors to your cities but of you never rolled horde good fucking luck finding sylvanas or cairne or the blood elf douche. Getting yeeted the fuck off of thunderbluff or not even making it because elevator boss +smart horde with knockback abilities was particularly infuriating.
---
I think the feel of authenticity will come from playing a MMO that hasn‚Äôt had the life sucked out of it, as I a side effect of making it more accessible. 
---
This is what the desire for classic wow boils down to. A lot of us have played retail at some point after vanilla, I know I have, I have played every expansion searching for that game that wow used to be, but there was always something or things missing, thats what compelled me to want an official version of Classic wow. 
---
Now that the search for that game we love and once was is coming to an end, I‚Äôm fairly confident That I personally will be happy with it and it will have that ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù feel we‚Äôve been searching years for.
---
I'm a teacher. I get June/July/August off. But I'll be away all of August.
---
So if it doesn't release this month I'm going to cry like a little girl :(
---
I‚Äôll be handing out the hot dickings.
---
I'm still playing live so...no?
---
Legion was awesome and I played its entirety, however BFA bored me after a couple months and I unsubbed.
---
No one can book any vacations or make plans until we get that release date. Economies are faltering I tell you!
---
Everyone creates an alt that they only play when the person with the lowest amount of play time is online. So keep track of his level and make sure your alt is always around his same level.
---
Wow wasn‚Äôt even a punishing mmo by mmo standards when it was released. 
---
The only time vanilla wow seems like Dark Souls is when it is directly compared to modern wow.
---
Not to forget they just added the fidget spinner toy
---
Because, when I was 15 and it was a school night, I had to wait for my mum to go to sleep and my dad to go to the pub for me to play WoW again. I kept the light off so that, when dad came home (my room was by the front door), he wouldn't see I was up and I could quickly log out and get back to bed.
---
I started classic wow 3-4 moths after release, after watching my brother in UBRS doing the rend fight. It looked awesome, so I tried wow out. Next day bought my own game/account and rolled a hunter. 
---
He was in a serious high end raiding guild and once I got to lvl 10 and did the pet quest, then my brothers and a couple of guild mates, ran me from Ironforge to via Loch Modan/ Wetland/duakwallow marsh and to Duratar to get me red raptor. There were a hunter, mage and my brothers pally and they had us on aspect of the pack and they aoe‚Äôd everything I aggro‚Äôd so I didn‚Äôt die.
---
I got loads of whispers and questions as a level 10-11 with a red raptor in Ironforge! üòÄüëç
---
Didn‚Äôt even give BFA a try because I knew it was dogshit.
---
Sure, but I am 45 now....why would I buy a crap gaming laptop? üòÇ
---
The issue is that when those 50 years start closing in you may very well wish you had more time. For now it‚Äôs immediate gratification. Doesn‚Äôt your future self deserve that same care though? That‚Äôs how I think of it. Supporting the happiness of my future self. We all invisibly have different expectations and don‚Äôt all need to make lofty goals. Comfort and happiness are completely valid options- but those are achievable while still taking care of yourself at the same time. 
---
I will say, at the end of the day though, I‚Äôm also just happy to hear that you‚Äôre happy. It‚Äôs just something to consider.
---
Yeah probably true. But why buy a poor/Average one, when I can get a good one and play on highest settings and have zero lag if raiding? Makes no sense to buy a poor or average gaming laptop when for a few hundred ¬£ more I can get a good one. üòÄüëç
---
My stupid best friend rerolled Alliance when he came back at the end of Cata, convinced me to come back at the end of MoP and of course I had to roll Alliance.
---
I hated it, but by now I've played Ally long enough that my faction identity has eroded away and I no longer feel the passion I used to :(
---
You can do macros for that.  
---
You just can't do macros to cast multiple spells with 1 button press.
---
Torture. With how well they seemed to want to communicate when they did a couple dev watercooler articles, I'm surprised how quiet they've been lately. I dont think people would be so hyped, stressed ..etc if they were just providing a weekly status update. 
---
The problem atm is we dont know the status at all, even a ballpark. So they could be nearly done or still months away. If they think they are still months out, just say so. No need to commit to a date. Communicate the struggles/work left to do and the community will understand.
---
he‚Äôs got an npc named after him in borean tundra, ‚Äúgorge the corpsegrinder‚Äù
---
Yeah I‚Äôm currently unsubbed from WoW at the moment waiting for Classic to be released.
---
*WEST VIRGINIA*
---
Getting the pink flamingo pet on my hunter and purposefully not leveling it; so that I could go to lowbie Alliance zones and use Eyes of the Beast to bait them into attacking the pet and flagging for PvP.
---
Haven't played since TBC, sup bitches
---
This. Me and my boyfriend are already planning how We gonna lvl, prep food before hand etc so We can lvl together with no breaks.
---
I feel like you might be looking for the wrong thing in a girlfriend because your luck seems terrible.
---
Perhaps look for a female friend instead of a "girlfriend" and see where it might naturally progress. Worst off you won't lose much of anything, best is, hey, you got a friend (and perhaps the start of something special)!
---
I was a turbo nerd back in vanilla.
---
Many years have changed things.
---
Can only be a mega nerd these days.
---
Left early Cata, haven't even PC gamed in a few years. Finished building my PC recently and I'm holding out on home internet till closer to the release date. I'm a reborn noob.
---
I've been ubsubbed since mists. Can't wait to go back!
---
My main was a hunter from release to Cata. Loved it. Never short of gold either. Great class to play and my pet was like my companion. 
---
I quit back in 2012, and I‚Äôm either leveling a shammy for resto or a hunter when classic is released.
---
1-60 gameplay should feel very authentic. Endgame will probably feel kinda different since we‚Äôre gonna have 1.12 itemization in MC and all that. Content will be easier because of that and players are just better overall. Community will probably be the biggest difference. Our culture has changed so much since then and we know so much about the game. However, the interaction and community should still be there if pservers are anything to go by. I spoke more to random strangers in my short time playing them than I ever have in modern WoW.
---
I agree, the non transparency is terrible.
---
Maybe EU.
---
US players don't care as long as you don't suck
---
&gt; Really hoping blizz drops classic in October lol
---
Nebraska checking in. Agreed.
---
I haven't been subbed since towards the end of Legion. Even then, it was just to mess around. Thinking of re-subbing. Maybe just to waste time until Classic. How's the journey from 110-120? Are the zones cool? Are the quests nice? Any feedback would be appreciated.
---
I unsubbed right after we killed Sargeras as the game was "done" for me once he was dead. Definitely coming to no life in classic wow.
---
Well the elite power-levelers will only see like 5% of exp being rested due to IRL sleep. You can still live the dream!
---
Also camp outside at night like a REAL MAN. Who needs beds?!
---
Dr Tran is that you?
---
Brilliant group healers. Great in PvP and PVE. Just not great 1v1 tank healers, but a good player will be fine.
---
You can level as ench or ele and still heal 5 mans leveling up, then go resto 50+.
---
yeah True
---
It's not really the internet without random psychologists rummaging around.
---
Probably doesn‚Äôt like the extreme socialist politics of the state.
---
And she doesn't say anything BECAUSE you start feeling guilty.
---
No need to call someone out when they know they're doing something a little wrong. TLC afterward is the real "meat and potatoes" of course.
---
Shammy‚Äôs are great fun. You said you are an above average player, so by 60 you‚Äôll have figured it out and be a good shammy. They are great fun in PvP.
---
Mid August probably. 8.2 will be released before.
---
Anal [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Content up to AQ and Naxx can be cleared with pretty weird treats setups, so it's not like there are no of specc people raiding. But they are not competitive in DPS, and I'm fairly confident that someone ran the numbers to see that even with improved totems for the melee group ye doesn't add up. 
---
Your problem is going to be finding a guild. In my experience the people that get to raid as boomkin, enhance, ele, or Ret, are co-founders or even guild masters. Noone is going to be actively looking for these specs. 
---
So IMO the main challenge of raiding as an odd specc is to convince 39 people that it should be you and not one of them.
---
As a joke hero
---
For someone that "played Horde" your comment history sure says otherwise.
---
"widely accepted" oh really? Can you provide some data to that statement?
---
No they can‚Äôt.
---
If you want to dps at max level and raid, level a dps. You will be lucky to be in a raid guild that allows enhance or shadow (no ‚Äògood‚Äô guild let‚Äôs balance or ele raid) or feral. And each of those will only have 1 slot. It‚Äôs pretty typical MT, Spriest, feral,  ret/enh are friends of the gm or founding members of the guild. So good luck getting a spot.
---
If you want to pvp as a hybrid dps, and want raid gear, your best bet is to heal in raids, scoop pvp loot and respec every week. Once you learn to farm gold, the 100g will take 1-2 hours to farm‚Äîmaybe 3-4 if you wpvp during the farming.
---
30/0/21 is the standard for a reason. I think the other posters covered it.
---
31/20/0 still has a niche though. It gives you a better chance at beating Warlocks and Priests. You can use this build once you get a nice 2H weapon from raiding. I would still default to wearing a 1H weapon and shield most of the time, then have a weapon swap macro to bring in the 2H against casters. This is more of an open world / 1v1 / "holy shit I can't believe I got Sulfuras and I need to show it off" build.
---
IMO absolutely nothing after WotLK is canon. And from TBC and WotLK only bits and pieces are canon. Vanilla was such a perfect setup to pick things up where WC3 left off, but then... yeah.
---
Blizzard from day one listened to the crybabies on their forums and this is why the game is the way that it is. They listened to people who want to have full epic/legendary gear without working for it. They listened to people who want to kill the biggest villains from WC lore without it being hard.
---
The people that Blizzard tried to cater to are the types of people who would literally feel offended if someone was walking around with better gear than them. They feel insulted at the idea that their character can't 1-shot Arthas and Illidan while giving Sargeras a noogie.
---
These were the """cajoowuls""" that cried on the Blizz forums 24/7 to make things easier and easier. Supposedly they were the majority, and the people arguing against them were grouchy nolifers. Turns out that those """cajooowuls""" didn't represent a tiny piece of shit from the WoW fanbase, and their ideas drove away everyone else.
---
But... its june - august?
---
I've been unsubscribed since late WotLK
---
I think the typical spec for hardcore PVP druid is basically focused around flag running and making that as effective as possible, which means a few points in balance for shape-shifting, a few points in Farrell up to Farrell charge, and the rest and restos you can keep yourself in your teammates alive. It's definitely different than just healing in a raid, there isn't really a good Druid spec for killing people in PvP but you have tools to win against pretty much every class if you know what you're doing. I think Druids are really fun in Battlegrounds and World PVP
---
Make sure you post a picture of your game discs too.
---
&gt;Nearly every waking moment of my life is sweet comfy bliss, no responsibilities or forced activities of any kind. I shit eat sleep and play video games precisely whenever the fuck I feel like it. I am truly free.
---
Dear God lol. You're not free, just a slave to your under-stimulated 13 year old brain.  You could be a peak drain on society if you just took care of yourself an hour a day and drank water. But I can see how the thought of living past 50 with no family, loved ones, or accomplishments is terrifying.
---
Yes. Also look for higher levels to help- hunters, warlocks will most likely be several levels ahead of you even if you are playing from day 1.
---
Little late, hoping I can still get some replies.
---
How much of an advantage is it to go dwarf priest instead of human?  Is my chance to get invited to raids much higher because of fear ward?  I don't mind dwarf, but all my friends will be playing human and it seems like it will be very difficult to join up with them from the start.

I met my ex in wow back in 2013, wouldn't advise doing this as long distance is super hard and honestly depressing.
---
Indeed. Given the hype for classic, it's a real damn shame the site hasn't been restored.
---
Farming gold off mobs works well if you find a good spot. Running low level instances like the scarlet monetary gets you good drops, cloth and occasional blur BOE to sell on the AH.  Tyr‚Äôs hand and EPL were also good AOE spots for mages to grind cloth/coins and humanoid mobs. 
---
As a mage doing DM runs can get you a lot of gold.
---
But dedicated herb runs can be good too, however I always felt this was hit or miss, and not good value for time/money than flat out grinding gold.
---
I'm not apozed to healing at all intact would have spent most of my wow time as a healer but I don't want to have to farm gold in holy or pay for respec and then do super bad dmg so I'm thinking a more spa orientated class is best.
---
Since you never played vanilla, it'll be authentic to you personally. And no, it won't be nostalgic for you. A completely different game. You may enjoy being in certain zones or revisiting certain dungeons, but the experience there will be completely new.
---
Talents/skills completely different, gearing different, pace different. Even simple things like realizing the game won't give you the exact location of where quests are completed.
---
Well, first of all you are out of mana sit down and have a drink !
---
Gnome/tailoring/engineering, play 50 hours/week. Give 'em hell son.
---
‚ÄúI don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.‚Äù 
---
-Ludwig Wittgenstein
---
Yeah a thousand players min-maxing with complete information defeats the entire point of a game that emphasizes exploration.
---
Hope for June, prepare for August.
---
I'm unsubbed since 2008 or 9.
---
Conjure that water baby
---
It's gonna be hard to use on many raid bosses. 
---
I'm 100% going for Monroe for pvp
---
It will be 2 min at start of classic
---
I buy my subs in yearly increments, and purchased my year of game time right after BfA came out. I still had faith that BfA wouldn't be a total dumpster fire. I was wrong.
---
That‚Äôs why they made unstable affliction in BC
---
No you don't want that.
---
To be that kind of Person you wpuldn't ask this here.
---
You would be looking up every information you can and calculate it yourself and test it on private Servers flr countless hours.
---
You seem like the typical kid that wants everything prechewed.
---
The answers you are looking for are already out there try to put some effort into this.
---
I am unsubbed.  Though the new sets may make me sub again for a while.
---
On an established economy the high end consumables (all the stuff that is used in raids and PvP) are more expensive than the materials, because there are far less alchemists than there are herbalists, plus there are several mob types that drop herbs as well.
---
If you have good knowledge of prices, fluctuations and the breadth of consumables and ingredients then you can literally stand next to the AH just buying materials and reselling the potions/elixirs for profit. But when using solely this method of getting the ingredients I would advise you to reasonably stock up on a broad variety of quality ingredients so you can react to the market more fluently.
---
That said, the better your knowledge of the prices, ingredients etc. is, the more money you can easily make by also gathering the ingredients via fishing and herb gathering. Some ingredients like Ghost Mushroom, Stonescale Eel etc. need to be actively sought out to gather in meaningful quantities, which is why their price is usually higher than other ingredients.
---
Checkout stormx on youtube.
---
Yea let me just reinvent the wheel
---
i was unsubbed since beginning of wrath, hated how the world was deemed irrelevant in BC, saw the trend continue in wrath so i just stopped. took THIS MANY YEARRRRS?!
---
Ha! Cought one!
---
Don't decurse. Keep dpsing when you're close to pulling agro. Don't cc (more targets for aoe!). You'll be top dps and everyone will hate you!
---
But for real, join the classic mage discord. Watch some good streams. If a mage is beating you find out why. And as always remember your A.B.C.s   Always Be Casting.
---
Hi, /u/lazypeon-ru
---
No, not for horde. Not worth the time investment, get a cat and get leveling
---
I remember back in vanilla when a friend told me he was soloing devilsaurs at level 54 on his druid. I was a couple of levels behind him so when I leveled up to 54 I started doing it. 
---
When he saw me he was all "WTF how are you face tanking them?" Apparently he'd been rooting them and ranging them down which didn't even occur to me. I wasn't that kind of druid.
---
May want to look into cooking also, some of the food buffs may help you out
---
You took Natural Weapons and Omen of Clarity in a build that only has 7 points in Feral. Why? You would do more damage, take less damage, have more utility, and have an extra 20% intellect if you simply took those 23 points and moved them to the Feral tree.
---
30 Feral / 21 Resto just does the hybrid thing better. Swiftmend builds work too although that's not really a "hybrid" build.
---
The classic announcement is what made me drop retail wow. I've played every xpac apart from the latest.
---
"Playing the auction house" or in less dramatic words: Buying and selling stuff for profit is something everyone should do who has a grasp on certain prices and fluctuations. \*Especially\* if their income is tied to certain material prices in the long term
---
The reason most fluctuations happen is because many players sell under value. This might have many reasons but my suspicion is that they either don't know the price they could sell it for and/or are impatient and possibly undercut even below market prices. These under-cutters simply don't value their time as much measured in gold.
---
An experienced eye can quickly see these kind of material dumps and counteract a price drop by buying materials and storing them over longer periods. For example you are a herbalist and commonly run Fadeleaf routes. Now someone is dumping their stock because they are short on money for something but undercuts the usual price by 20%. This is where you can buy in bulk, store it and just not do Fadeleaf runs for a while, while also stabilizing the market for something you want to get long term value out of.
---
I've only been subbed for a handful of months since cata.
---
I meant I just sniped it from you
---
Technically , September is still summer :P
---
I quit many times throughout my WoW career. I played heavily through vanilla to WOTLK, and left after mid-Cata endgame. Didn‚Äôt do MoP or WoD, game back to the beginning of legion, left, tried BfA and left pretty quick after getting to 120 or whatever. 
---
I will be traveling a lot this year so I won‚Äôt catch the classic hype as soon as it releases, but when I get back I‚Äôm gonna join back! I did all the famous private servers so I won‚Äôt feel like I missed out much.
---
Why do people say mage is better 1v1 / 1vx then hunter?
---
Hunter better 1v1 then mage?
---
I will save my charity for the real world. 
---
jk I'll only do it in WoW
---
So's playing WoW but we still come here
---
Sap is only broken by damaging abilities.
---
- Tibia and World of Warcraft
---
- All day every day, I remmember during AV weekend I would skip school friday and monday for more honor farming. Also set my allarm at 1:00 at night so I can game from 1 till 5. And quickly go to bed before my mom wakes up. Was so tired from it I skipped next day aswell and tge gaming continues
---
- Most if my friends played Tibia in primairy school and most of these primary school friends are still my best friends. Most of the friends I met online faded away over time. A few guys I still text sometimes, like once every 3 months.
---
- Not me but my mate met his girlfriend online 6 months ago. They are still together but having some issues because of the distance between them
---
- Im from the old school Mmoprg. Amphasize on the RP. I feel back when we were younger gaming in general was Vs. Your friends. Nowadays its always with your friends. I miss playing against them. We're from the ninento on the couch generation wich was always vs eachother. Also oldschool mmo's are way more RPish. You could play the good guy or the bad guy. Nowadays you cannot play the bad guy because its a team game. Rping as the bad guy gets called griefing or trolling. This used to be just a way of playing.
---
-
---
Hunter for ease of leveling. And when you hit 60 you can do good gold farming in mauradon and dire maul.
---
Oh right damn, I had forgotten that existed. Can't wait for people to find out about all of these silly item restrictions and spam /r/wow with whine posts about how stupid everything is :D
---
Vanilla devs had a different design philosophy when it came to hybrids. These days if you play a Druid literally all 4 specs (tank, cat, moonkin, resto) are just as good as pure DPS, pure Tank and pure Healer classes.
---
It's not like this in Vanilla. As they say, jack of all trades master of none.
---
Unfortunately for Druid they get a bad wrap because they're not as good as other Healers per se. Shaman and Paladin both get way more raid slots than Druids (usually there will be only like 2-3 Druids in one raid optimally).
---
Anyway, I wouldn't let it get you down if you enjoy Druid. They are still really good in PvP. Their playstyle is more of a wittle-you-down style than anything. Also they are the #1 flag carrier in WSG.
---
I could be mistaken but I think most Druids run Heart of The Wild/Resto and some points into Nature's Grasp because it's so good.
---
It won‚Äôt be me, but if I don‚Äôt see a ‚ÄòJoeyJoeJoeJnr‚Äô I‚Äôll be upset.
---
My biggest concern is going to be how much sharding is going to impact the gameplay.  Blizz has said all the right words, but I can't help but feel they will be super prone to flipping on sharding right when things start to get fun.  Large scale activities were always my fondest memories of vanilla WoW, and I just don't think I can take a couple of orgrimmar raids getting sharded.
---
That, for instance, would end my subscription really quickly.
---
I was actually the Holy Paladin that lost to DnT in the 2007 blizzcon 2v2 finals.
---
Retail players are still so delusional that they think classic will die in a year (still subbed and heard that golden line yesterday, like every other day in game).
---
Can't wait to throw the wall of no at them once classic becomes bigger then retail
---
If you don't mind dwarf 100% go dwarf.  You will get raid invites as human, but you would get priority as dwarf in every raid teir.  Stoneform also has it's uses on the few bosses that bleed/poison/diesease you.  Chromag and some of the ZG bosses come to mind.  If you ever pvp those two are also super useful there.  
---
You would very naturally run into your friends around level 10 when the game pushes you to the capital cities, but you don't have to wait.  You can run to Ironforge, take the tram, and be in the human starting zone in under 20min.
---
You can't really solo this method, the solo method is just AoE lashers and herbing. It can work just fine too but it does depend a lot on the exact values of lashers which private servers aren't the best way to be sure of.

I consider summer to be June, July and August, 3 months per season
---
&gt;implying there's gonna be RP/PVE servers
---
I know Americans aren't the smartest, but why do you have to respond on 3 days old comment.
---
Dishonorable Kills were one of the better features added to WoW. People would try to be assholes and just camp quest turn ins or flight paths. It made it so if you were one of those assholes you got punished for griefing. I just wish they had been expanded to include low level players as well. Like, yeah, if you want to be a time wasting prick to other people you can still do it, you just, ya know, won't get to big dick it with the hardcore PvP players.
---
You played every single expansion since vanilla, huh? It seems you were ultra casual in vanilla if you don't understand why it was so good.
---
I'm helping care for my 90 yr old gram who has basically regressed to a toddler state. And she ate well, didn't smoke, lived healthy...etc.. until she wasn't. Sure some people can be lucky and enjoy into their late years with relatively good health and money. But no guaretee your body won't fail you anyway and your savings disappear to medical bills. She's been miserable for a decade now. I dont want that for myself. 
---
Quality of life is what matters, and you are not guaranteed jack tomorrow, so all you can do is take that quality today. So I'm with you.
---
I liked them all for different reasons but if vanilla is only considered good because of appealing to the hardcore cutting edge raider then that‚Äôs a pretty small margin
---
Right on the spot.
---
If you're not into racing for world/server first or have a very unreliable schedule there is literally no point to tie yourself to a guild prior to launch. 
---
Just play the game. If you also put in some effort in being nice to your peers and make whatever instance/quest/etc you do run as smoothly as possible then people will recognize it. They will add you to friends and keep inviting you to the party. If you're currently not in a guild they will for sure ask you to join theirs. Should you also be among the first say 100-200 people to 60 then there will be no problem whatsoever to find a decent guild to raid with since everyone is desperate to fill their raid spots.
---
HD graphics ? Best thing about this engine is you will be able to increase the spell effect intensity to Absurd levels so you can trick people to turning up the spell effects and crashing their Game.

Farming E'kos in Winterspring as a Dual boxer would be very lucrative :o
---
I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs trolling or not... is that bad?

I havent subbed ever since TBC was released #vanilla4lyfe

It would also be a bear and wolf holocaust and there would be no wildlife left within a day of server being open.

---
Well if you think about it, the things on the first panel will always be there, every Summer, possibly for the next 50-60 years (inb4 sea levels rise by 50 meters).
---
Yet, Classic, and it's launch, will only happen once. So it's a no-brainer which one is more worth it do dedicate your time/Summer to.
---
&gt;Ignore what irks you, remark on what makes you smile.       
---
       
---
To me, this is like asking me to ignore dead bugs in my food and instead pick around then for 'the good bits'.     
---
         
---
Some behavior/content is enough to poison/ruin an entire production even with context. This is one of those for me, for sure.
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
Er...tauren.
---
there isn't much to being a big dick top dps mage honestly. 
---
But sure, start with tailoring and drop it for engineering when you get archmage. For 2nd professions depend on gold making. Then when you hit 60 you need to farm a billion gold. Yes a fuckign billion. Then you buy 2x freezing band and the BiS "of the frozen wrath" greens that exist at that patch. When diremaul comes out you start ranking to r10 for set, and then well you are basically go. Make sure you have flask and pots/demonics for raiding and minmax your dps by precasting perfectly and utilizing AoE(including sapper + immo oil) on any encounter that has more than 2 mobs. Learn to tickdrink for speedruns(you have a timer of your mana tick and drink right before it ticks, then move until next tick is imminent, this way you can drink while walking but it costs a ton of water). Make sure you worldbuff before every raid, that includes going into BFD to the murloc and getting that sweet +15frost damage, it takes about 12 mins to do this from Darnasus, so get it after you get DMT buffs and before getting anything else.
---
I keep going through stages of renewing my sub, playing for a couple of hours and not touching it for the rest of the month üò¢
---
I think if they should make a change to the DHK system it should be that you only get a DHK if you personally do damage to an npc that is killed. 
---
The whole "someone in your party/raid tagged an npc and killed it and everyone is fucked now" thing kind of sucked.
---
They never officially announced a beta. There was just a leak about them uploading some beta files. Could be an internal beta, not an open beta.
---
Pservers.
---
But how did they stay on top of them? By investing countless hours into atleast one level 20 warlock each player had to level, lookout duty 24/7 while the respawn timer was active.
---
It was no handout. Top guilds were top for a reason and that was dedication.
---
World bosses were basically e-peen contests in which you could combine your PvE and PvP prowess from raids and BGs into one to dominate the enemy and your own faction. 
---
Credit where credit is due basically.
---
I am still subscribed since vanilla. The longest breaks I took was about six months during MOP, and another six WOD. I am not sure if I cancelled my sub then. I think I might have. But I always come back.
---
I personally dont take anybody seriously who posts stuff like "retail tourist" or shits on &lt;latest expansion&gt; without actively playing it.
---
Only issue with this plan is that GQD is a bunch of SJW cucks.
---
would liked to of gone to Coachella before I got to old, but I guess I'll never get herpes :(
---
I played from release through the first two expansions, then left.
---
I had to take time off work for health reasons just before BfA was released, so I re-subbed to fill my time, played a while, watched the TotureVision evisceration of BfA\* on YouTube, agreed with every word , left again.
---
Looking forward to farming runecloth in Plaguelands, and having picnics by the waterfall in Stranglethorn Vale, on an RP server.
---
\*  If you haven't seen it, give it a look.  It's a very honest opinion of the flaws in BfA.
---
I don‚Äôt heal warlocks that life tap.
---
WarCraft 3 campaign
---
Hang in voice chat. Also have toons at different level ranges to always be viable for what they want to do. 
---
I came back for Legion and most fun was hanging with a small set of old guildies from BC. We were all on different servers to start and different guilds. A few ended up moving and raiding together. A few of us created alts on that server. They helped power level us at times and we ended up running a ton of 5 man content together.
---
Unfortunately we lost steam in BFA and one  of the guys who had always had serious health issues ended up passing away. So the group is pretty much disbanded. I'm antsy for classic because I really want to put effort into generating some new gaming friendships.
---
Ghostsaber
---
But wouldn't that make it just a graveyard zerg? I would much rather have such a system in place that allows one of the factions to 'win' the battle.
---
For some reason your post triggered the wailing caverns right eye socket hidden quests and traininers i found years ago. Most know of course, but I found it without a guide. Can't think of any hunter pets.
---
You‚Äôre not above average at all if the amount of keybindings are a concern, sorry to break it to you.
---
Honestly don't remember struggling that much against them, like I said they assume your marksman and they ignore the pet which leads to them getting wailed on
---
If you get to 60 and are start getting worried about raids you're gonna be 250 hours bare minimum into a character. It takes about 15mins to run down to storm wind. So yeah, don't fret the small stuff.
---
CoH
---
For the longest time I did not know what TIL  AFAIK or IIRC ment. But all of these sentences were exactly the same with of without it. Its a filler word.
---
Nice! I‚Äôll add that
---
Nothing! Waiting on the release date then getting myself a new gaming laptop for playing. üëç
---
Alts.
---
I rush my main to 60 after that I'll level multiple alts with rested. Keep them at seperate level ranges that way I always have an alt to do a dungeon with.
---
Thats rough dude, I'm sorry..
---
You're gonna need someone higher level. I think the final boss is a 38 elite or something. So if you don't have someone in the group at least 36 it's going to be pretty hard.
---
&gt;Dishonorable Kills were one of the better features added to WoW.
---
It killed town raiding.  Making such NPCs non combat would have been better.  
---
&gt;It made it so if you were one of those assholes you got punished for griefing.
---
Griefing made the world feel dangerous and required you to interact with your guild in order to drive off the greifers.  It created content.
---
Meanwhile my warlock ass is farming an hour before raid for full soul shards :')
---
I liked humar for the black lion look. Took a while to get but liked that pet.
---
Didn‚Äôt manage to get brokentooth before he was nerfed. 
---
If I play a hunter, then it depends what race I play as to what pet I want. Humar goes great with a Tauren, and I like the raptors with orc/troll.
---
The old loading screens. I think some of the art on the vanilla loading screens are phenomenal and nostalgic and I can't wait to see them again!
---
Why not level something new?
---
I have not played since 8 march:P And i was subsribed on and off since august
---
Mate of mine said to me "damn, I'll never find a girl irl since I don't go out much. Why can't I just meet a girl in wow?" 2 months later he met a girl. Loving semi-close ( 1 hour drive ) away and they are together for 6 months now.
---
Its rare byt possible. Like an epic world drop. Aiming for not has no effect you just randomly find one if you do.
---
Hell yea!
---
Was gonna say, retcon started in TBC and the Dreaenei Spaceship.
---
Depends on your playtime. 
---
If you plan to invest at level 60, doing dungeons, raids, PvP etc. you will have a good 50-70 days /played or even more.
---
A well planned leveling route takes 6-10days. So you will level only a fraction of your playtime.
---
I leveled 2 shamans to 60 and 3 warriors on pservers.
---
In the end shaman leveling is really repetitive and not much better than warrior leveling. But for me tanking is 100% better than healing. I healed the preBiS grind, healed couple MCs and got dragged into an AQ40 raid up until twin emps. Then I knew I dont like healing and leveled a warrior up once again.
---
Ask crogge xD
---
Blessings and food, I imagine. The dream is to spend "alt-tab time" standing around somewhere in Stormwind or Ironforge and being a dwarf priest who offers free food and a buff to anyone who passes by. It'll be a way to get more immersed, do something at least marginally useful for the other people playing and in the end it's better than spending game-time browsing social media instead (never was a fan of that). 
---
As such the light will shine down even upon your stomachs! Gratias ad lux!
---
Old School Runescape and some pservers (Vanilla and WotLK).
---
I'll be spending downtime shadowmelded in good ganking spots in redridge to suck the horde poison out of the land.
---
Everytime I see modern STV it makes me want to puke.
---
STV is famous in vanilla as being a warzone, but more then that I think it is a masterpiece of a zone.  The reason it is so pvp active is that the zone is great to quest in, as well as being important from low 30s all the way to 60.  
---
Lore wise vanilla is right after WC3 and the undead plague, cata is right after wotlk and the defeat of Arthas.  Vanilla EPL and WPL always felt unsettling and unsafe and did a great job to me of feeling like being on the edge of evil with the undead still actively trying to spread.  
---
Post cata, those zones feel like petting zoo for the undead.
---
While not a part of the lore, the southshore vrs tarren mill phase of vanilla pvp cemented that as the most visible and active point of faction conflict in the world.  Having southshore fall to the forsaken broke that.
---
LoL, laughing at how toxic it is but getting frustrated at the same time.
---
Those 23 points in balance give you almost nothing useful other than natural shapeshifter and moonglow. Standard hotw/ns is better in every way.
---
1. Why aren't speedrunners "real ones", ie why is their preferred way of enjoying the game apparently worse than yours
---
2. The speedrunners you are describing don't speedrun to max level, they speedrun clears of AQ, Naxx, etc. Things that aren't out for at least a year. I'm really not sure what I am reading here.
---
Deep Rock Galactic. Dwarf Fortress. Division 2. I picked up Risk of Rain 2, but need a solid chunk of time to fire it up for the first time. Maybe this weekend. I started playing Minecraft again for the first time in years.
---
Hi, /u/bdonvr
---
Might go halfway between serious and silly and name my dwarf Chaddar Thunderrock. 
---
I probably won't do that and actually get a really serious name so I'm hoping someone else takes that.
---
Man, even if I agree with you, do you really need to bring that shit in here?
---
Anyone want to hop on LH tonight and level some lowbies for fun?
---
Diablo 2 actually is still pretty fun!
---
I pretty much stopped playing on private servers because I didn't want to be in a burnout phase when it dropped, does that count?
---
Arcane Intelect. Water cost money tho.
---
Same! Our whole guild quit right after we killed Ragnaros in Firelands 25 heroic.
---
Cause it s also very strong. But hunter can beat mage
---
Got to 120 within the first three days of the xpack. Played off and on with a squad of IRL friends for about two weeks post BFA launch. Annnnd then quit due to lack of giving a shit and more of the same daily quest grind.
---
This is contrasted by playing Legion for the majority of it's life and viciously going after daily quests and enjoying it and enjoying artifact weapons.
---
I wasn't disappointed with the story because I'm gun-ho for Sylvanas going batshit nuclear on the Alliance because red is dead. I thought the Horde leveling was cool and their area designs were fine and the capital city was fine. 
---
There's just something about how titanforging/warforging is still in and how nothing feels compelling due to AP going towards an item I dont see or give a shit about compared to my Legion badass affliction warlock scythe.
---
Classic cannot come fast enough.
---
haha same here
---
But arent mages stronger against more classes then hunter? &amp; gear scale better?
---
I never said anything about RP-PvP. Names like that still exist on PvE servers, dum-dum.
---
I did not mean to be dramatic with the phrase "playing the auction house." I meant it quite literally, referring to people who don't play the rest of the game; their sole focus is the auction house and drawing as much money from the economy as they can.
---
I really hate today's bag of edgy buzzwords. sjw, cuck, beta, it's really sad how many people can't go a minute without calling somebody all 3 of those.
---
lolwut
---
&gt;v1 and 1vX class in the game. We have a throng of tools that we can us
---
Im i think if your marksman and you rely on your ranged damage the mage can cc and kite you to stay in your dead zone. Im sure a good mage would cause big issues by denying a hunter the chance to used range attacks therefore like 85% of their damage. In Vanilla im pretty sure my pet did roughly 60% of my total damage, so if they ignored it to focus on trying to be in my dead zone they would waste a lot of time and spells on me,  leaving my pet to cause havoc. It has obviously been like 12 years since then so my memory is most likely off a bit, but like i said the only class i remember having big issues with was pallies, they would just bubble/heal through the bestial wrath, then basically outlast me in a war of attrition haha. having high armour and heals was often my downfall.
---
Actually... ACTUALLY?!
---
I think hunter does better vs warlock and rogue comparatively.
---
Hunter scales better in PvP, you can hit 2k aimed shot 1k multi 700 auto if the crit stars align. That will oneshot any cloth.
---
I love going through mine and reading all the stuff that didn't even make it into release.
---
Mirah song is very nice for human warr
---
Find yourself a decent fury warrior friend that also can tank (Which won't be hard).
---
In P1 you can run Strat live reserving first 1 or 2 orbs and the flask/truefaith recipe.
---
In P2 you do DM:E jump runs. Just make sure that between the two of you someone has maxed mining and the other person enchanting (For disenchanting, don't have to be maxed) and preferably herbalism. You will be getting a couple of blue items and depending on the price for shards you disenchant or vendor them. There will also be 2-4 guaranteed Rich Thorium Veins at the end of the instance with changes of receiving Arcane Crystals that sell for quite a bit. With some luck you can pick up a DM class book where some of them are worth alot of gold. Mainly Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying for the Quel'serrar sword but also the rogue/hunter ones.
---
*Laughs in Risk of Rain 2*
---
It will be added to the starting areas for a couple of weeks while the mass numbers hit the server. It is a sensible and rational approach that leaves the server numbers to be healthy after the initial zerg. 
---
If you were going to design a system from scratch to handle a server start zerg scenario then you would arrive at the sharding solution. There are far too many fanbio's of streamers crying about sharding in the starting zones without providing realistic solutions. Your points are valid generally for the open world, but on day 1 launch a solution is needed. The PServer scene have tried multiple different approaches all of which were awful and meant that the starting zones were a horrendous experience for everyone and sharding is the obvious solution to an overpopulated day 1 server realm when all players are in 6 zones fighting for mob tags with 10 people all camping a single mob spawn location to get a mob tag. You are not going to make life long Wow friends at levels 1-10 so chill about it and realise that we have a Classic Wow dev team that are listening and happy to change things on community feed back but are not moving on this for good reason.

I subscribed for every addon, played 3 month and unsubscribed.
---
Red alert 2
---
I had been unsubbed for the past year, played on some private servers, then this weekend past I resubbed to see what it was like, I heard the battlegrounds got a remodel. Totally different in every way, I just can't get into it
---

---
Yeah I won‚Äôt be supporting a GDQ event
---
love to see all these tons of comments from people that actually didn't play since THAT wow. There may be an impression that the majority really does not play in absolutely every expansion that Blizzard releases (there is an opinion that this is a reason why wow still afloat)
---
&gt;stsaber - spooky cat
---
I might try for this one, this time around. I had Humar in vanilla which i loved, but i don't like my chances for the first 6 months of release haha.
---
I‚Äôd prefer it but I understand why it won‚Äôt happen.
---
Luckily there are none in phase 1 so will at least have some time to camp red ridge
---
I'm playing DOTA 2 smurfing in the lowest rank clapping bots. And yes, I love to feel superior hence the reason i love twinking in WoW too
---
since cata ;D
---
\&gt;  I‚Äôm thinking about going Druid, but from what I‚Äôve read there seems to be kind of a negative stigma surrounding them.
---
Druids don't push the highest numbers in raids on average is where this old stigma comes from. But they have unique qualities and flexibility that is valued by good raiders and guilds. There is always a place for a couple of Druids in every good guild, but nobody is looking to stack them to anything higher than 3-4 per raid.
---
The four most optimal PvE builds are:
---
Off-tank/dps feral (0-2 per raid):
---
Tanking trash, adds, high threat bosses, back-up threat tanking, decursing/dispelling or DPSing if otherwise not needed. One is optimal because of their off-gearing process and flexibility.
---
Swiftmend/deep resto (1-2 per raid):
---
Very high burst healing, decent raid healing, decent tank healing. HoTs don't stack so you don't want more than one \*maybe\* two.
---
Moonglow (any number to fill healer slots):
---
Very efficient HT spam, frees up Innervate for Priests because of that.
---
HotW/NS hybrid (0-1):
---
Same mitigation as feral when tanking but lower threat ceiling, dps is supbar so you want to be healing when not tanking/off-tanking with this spec. Don't really excell at anything but can fill multiple roles with a gear swap in any type of raid/dungeon. Especially high tier raids vary a lot between how many tanks and healers you need per encounter.
---
In PvP this is an entirely different story Druids are \*the\* best WSG flag carriers and thus the "heroes" of that battleground. This is when rocking the Swiftmend/charge spec or at least the HotW/NS hybrid spec. In AB you can solo defend flags for a very long time with these specs too and support very well becasue of your mobility, burst healing and survivability.
---
Feral Druids are different. In PvP they have less surviviability than their resto counterparts. They still make for good defenders because they have stealth and mobility, but they are much more gear dependand. They also need to be on offense more (zerging) to make use of their kit and thus rely more on their teammates to be impactful.
---
There is much more we could talk about here but the bottom line is: You won't be a sick damage dealer as a Druid in PvP regardless of the spec, but if you value complexity, survivability and mobility then Druid might be for you.
---
What is GDQ?
---
Why would you want this?
---
I'm talking about PvE.
---
Hi, /u/jakewalker14
---
Lmao i literally had this happen yesterday.. after 1 hour everyone finally arrived at maraudon to find out after the first pull our "healer" was a ret paladin with only one piece of equipment that had intellect on it... we didnt even get to kill the first pack.. what a waste of time
---
Killing civilians isn‚Äôt griefing.
---
Stardew Valley and Minecraft.
---
I like how much diversity there is in the other games people who are excited about Classic enjoy. Broad communities are the best.
---
Hm. Ok.
---
So this was likely a bug, but i tamed the turtle boss from BFD and he had a glitch that whenever it levelled up, he would have over 100k armour until he gained a certain amount of XP (like 25% of the next level). I had screen shots of this but that was several computers ago and i cant find them now :(.
---
Not sure if this will be part of classic or not but i used to tank deadmines and stuff with him at level 32ish to farm gold, since the mobs were grey we wouldn't get xp and they would only hit him for 1 or 2 damage each. 
---
Might try this again and see if i get lucky haha.
---
Overwatch
---
I stopped after I hit 85 in cata. Played LOTS during wotlk.
---
Pserver.  New WotLK just opened a few days ago, pretty smooth so far.
---
Hey I like my motorcycle lol
---
Mking
---
I am gonna be a grandma druid with cooking and leatherworking sets.
---
More complex? Definitely. Better? Not imho. I used to love raiding with friends, I had no clue what logs were or if I was doing good dps or not. We just worked together and after enough attempts shit just died and we were happy. 
---
Then ICC heroic came out and we got stuck. Some people started getting frustrated and stopped playing and our group broke apart until cata. Then in cata, rinse and repeat. Then in MoP. And in WoD most of the group decided to not even play cause they knew what was gonna happen. The few that did found a guild for their skill level rather than a guild full of people they enjoyed hanging out with.
---
Turns out a lot of people in our group were shit at the game, we were a group of 10 and only around 4 of us were good. We all enjoyed the game and treated raiding as a group activity to have fun/talk shit, but once raid/class mechanics became much more complex to please the "too easy" crowd, raiding was officially dead as a social activity, because you will always hit a roadblock.
---
I ended up joining a top 250 US guild for BfA cause I had really good parses (all 95%+, most 99%) and an acquaintance hooked me up. I didn't even get to trial raid with them because after being one of the first 10 people in a hardcore guild to hit 120, with no sleep in the past 48+ hours (work + no lifing WoW), I fucked up one mechanic once in a heroic dungeon I had never seen (didn't play beta). They must have assumed I was brain-dead from this, cause on the first raid week they told me they didn't have a spot. That's when I realized that this is why I haven't been able to stick around for an entire expansion since WotLK; cause you either find fun, casual people who are mediocre at the game and get stuck on early mythic bosses (if they even make it there) and the guild disbands, or you get stuck working a job instead of playing a game, and 99% of the people you "work" with are insufferable cunty tools, so actually succeeding feels shitty anyways cause you don't have anyone you like to share it with.
---
Whats the jist of ban about?
---
I think having DHKs will make people try to kill civilians MORE in phase 1 and 2, when there are no dhks.
---
The rake looks normal but has a 1.2 attack speed and is level 10. Could be worth a run for some people.
---
Salv is great, and made alliance pve better in vanilla, but that gap used to be smaller.  On private servers nowadays EVERY player is minmaxed, and buff stacking spam is was more prevalent.    
---
Also there are some fights that were just better for horde.  Cthun with shamans adding kicks, nature's resist totem for huhuran, tremor on like 1/4 of the early fights.  Vanilla fights were mechanically simple, only a few fights have a true timer, often the only the limiting factor was healer mana.  Raid leaders could hot swap shamans mid fight so that mana tide always got dropped in a healer group.  In this way horde was better on long fights so having to wait longer to dps isn't a killer.  
---
Also there are several fights where the boss isn't taunt immune or there is no threat mechanic AKA patchwerk.  Then salv is literally worthless.  
---
Even in a progression guild I don't think we understood how big of a deal salv was until BWL patch and having to deal with wing buffet spam.  In MC/ony fear ward and added cleanse for the dispel fights seemed like a bigger alliance advantages.
---
Horde hunters can get bats instead (bite instead of claw but otherwise identical stats).
---
More than likely 6-slot bags after I‚Äôve outfitted myself and my brother.
---
Pserver with races/classes I'm not gonna touch in Classic. Got a few Sekiro bosses left to do.
---
Have you never heard of solstices or the equinox? On a solstice the sun will have reached the farthest point north or south that it can reach relative to the earth. Winter solstice(first day of winter dec 21) will be the shortest day of the year in terms of daylight. The summer solstice is June 21 which is the longest day of the year and the first day of summer. In the Arctic circle you will get 24 hours of darkness on dec 21, and 24 hours of daylight in June 21. 
---
There is also the equinox which is when the Earths equator passes through the centre of the sun. This happens twice a year (March 20, sept 23) which are the first days of spring and autumn respectively.
---
The real solution is to just make quest givers untargetable/invincible. Everything and everyone else is fair game. 
---
I firmly feel DHKs we‚Äôre introduced as a means of discouraging killing quest givers.
---
I had a dual gather mage alt.  What worked for me was I rebound camera in/out to "[" and "]" and put tracking on mouse wheel up and down.
---
Not always. If it's civilians dying during a city raid, it's obviously not. And if it's one person literally camping an NPC for hours, it obviously is.
---
I feel like most of the time, getting DHKs is alot closer to an accidental annoyance than somebody actually griefing somebody.
---
It was a combination of things; mounts, shiny and newly pressed armor sets, daily quests, narrative of being a hero... 
---
WoW to me was something else. I liked TBC, but even there I felt something was lost because of the flying mounts and dailies. Wrath was just last nail in the coffin.
---
I farmed the breastplate of chromatic flight. That was a pain in the ass lmao
---
I stepped into MC for the first time wearing greens and sub level 50 blues
---
The waiting game
---
Retail just doesn‚Äôt feel like WoW anymore, it‚Äôs more like a single player action game.
---
Something like if distance traveled is &lt; 17 seconds use spirit wolf.
---
Same case, made my quit in WoD. Each time I login coz of friends pressure, I loose respect for my friends more than I do for the game.
---
Which one is it?
---
Hope for mid June cuz thats when ill be off from work for 4 weeks üòÇ
---
Baby due early September. What do I do?!
---
It's fun for about two weeks.. I got 120 in less than 12 hours, got up to 380 gear level in 7 hours and I was already able to do mythics and raids. I also beat a mythic raid in less than two weeks played and I haven't raided since MC on nost, which just seems REALLY silly to me since it's supposed to be harder than heroic.
---
The pvp is also terrible for too many reasons to list. It could have been fun, but it's just so imbalanced and such a pain to be a caster.
---
Ridiculous. I have much better posture than that
---
It is. I tried to avoid doing dungeons and try the old school leveling but it is so damn boring. ‚ÄûKill this troll leader he is very dangerous!‚Äú. Needless to say two shots and he is down. Nothing has a meaning you feel like a god in this world and it is boring...I hope at least the new content makes me ran out of hp/mana sometimes but I think I will just wait for classic
---
&gt; considering x-bow is obviously a type of bow
---
No, it's not.
---
I never was that big of a raider so I don‚Äòt rly mind this tbh
---
Elite : Dangerous. In deep space but coming home for Classic.
---
Damn South Park was so good for so long but eventually even they went down the shitter
---
Or if you are lucky like me you dont get any dopamine hits from video games so i play as long as i have fun.
---
It costs rage, and you lose the rage from the white hit yes, so it is not a highly efficient use of rage.  
---
I didn't play dps warrior, but IIRC slam pve builds were a thing, but only for 2h arms/fury hybrid spec weirdness.  Eventually dual wielding fury is so much better that every dps warrior should be dual wielding.  IIRC Slam interferes with swing timer, so it not practical while dual wielding.
---
Heroic has other benefits as well, it is off of GCD so can be used as a rage dump, and heroic strike had a hidden benefit of protecting your attack from being a glancing blow.  
---
I leveled an alt warrior as fury, but if you level as arms, say with a whirlwind axe, I think there are times that you should slam and only heroic strike if you can't slam down your rage fast enough.
---
Do you mean with or against? coz i played against him and it's pretty toxic yeah but if you mean he's a toxic person then i can't comment
---
I‚Äôve had enough of this same question.  Use the damn search function and get out of my face.
---
SAGE
---
You definitely won't since there is a 12 character limit and no spaces allowed.
---
Exactly.
---
(If we want to nitpick, it's possible artists get involved occasionally for checking things or drawing a new logo, etc. I'm not a Blizzard employee on the Classic team, how would I know the *exact* details? But the main point is that Classic is just a recreation of Vanilla. They explicitly said they won't touch the data, they won't redraw anything.)
---
Roll PvE, problem solved.
---
Sure, haven't subbed since TBC though. Played free xpack trials in MoP and Legion, and holy shit what a horrible experience of a game it's become.
---
I've been discussing this with my friends that I've known since Vanilla WoW. Ever since I started working 5-6 years ago, I lost what I feel was an addiction to gaming. Primarily WoW since 2004 and Starcraft II since its release. So now, when I get home or have weekend, and I find myself not necessarily wanting to play games. However, just thinking about classicwow really triggers that old feeling that I haven't felt in years. It's both interesting and terrifying.
---
But, to answer the question. Each expansion I fall prey to buying the expansion out of a sense of nostalgia. Then, I get bored within a month, because it's not what WoW used to be. It actually feels like doing chores in the form of a game, in addition to my household chores... lol.
---
The following specs are considered competitive during the time that MC is current content:
---
1. Fury
---
2. Combat
---
3. Affliction/Destruction, Demo/Destruction (nearly identical in function)
---
4. Arcane/Frost
---
5. Marksmanship
---
Most specs are raid viable, but that does not make them competitive.  
---
You will be able to find a raid spot as a DPS Shaman, but long story short you will not outperform pure DPS classes. There is no amount of utility that you can offer which cannot be more efficiently matched by another class or spec.
---
I personally don't see anything wrong with bringing hybrid DPS to raids, but even for me it's difficult to justify bringing more than a handful. Balance/Cat Druid, Ret Paladin, Shadow Priest, Elemental/Enhancement Shaman are all considered inferior PvE DPS with good reason. A lot of those specs are great PvP specs, but their PvE performance just isn't there.
---
10 million sub numbers first month after classic release.... But prob only for one month...  Time will tell.
---
Words of wisdom.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/community/classic-discussion 
---
All the information about it is in the stickies.
---
For me it is a redemption run. 
---
Back when i was playing vanilla in 2006, i had no concept of questing, gearing, or effectively working on professions or raiding. I hit 60 right at the start of Naxx. I remember when i was below 20, i just put on what looked cool. No idea of what i needed as a warrior for example i needed mail, but i found this cloth robe off a mob and was using a staff because i loved the way it looked and i thought it was super cool and used both items until level 12. 
---
I remember doing all of the crazy quest lines but no fully appreciating them, for example the whirl wind axe quest, or the  *Berserker* quest line. One of my most fondest memories in this game, was leveling in Tanris, the music and the mobs were just so unique to me at the time, my favorite dungeon was ZF and i use to run it multiple times a week! The coolest part of it at the time was the steps encounter! (Still in game but back in the day it was a whole other level to me at the time.)
---
I plan on finding a guild to raid and play with again, i want to make new friends int his game and find a new community and i'm excited to see what classic has in store for me. 
---
I am ready to go back again and do it right this time, and have fun, i can't wait until classic is released so i can walk down memory lane.
---
For one thing, character look, and gear (funny looking most of the time), made you look like a race member which belonged to the whole, not the other way around.
---
Retail is built like modern free mobile games that are constructed to increase retention by using daily content that you need to do in order to stay competitive/progress and are triggering your daily shoot of dopamine based on gambling mechanism. You end up with a list of daily chores to do and once done, you feel empty but you have crossed all entries from your daily wow todo list, so it is satisfying to some degree and it washes out if you had the rush because the Titan/warforging rng Jesus was with you that day. At that point , retail could be f2p and provided gems to buy skins and mounts it wouldn't change much to its actual gameplay/content/mechanics.
---
Vanilla is an old game that base its retention on progressive reward every couple levels , than on content that is rewarding when completed. It's an achievement based game , where you get that dopamine shoot whenever you complete something worth , it may take you several days but when you do, boy, you feel it. (10, 20, 30, ..., 60, your first 5 man dungeon , your first spoulders, onyxia attunement , etc) 
---
Retail = retention by incentivation and gambling
---
Vanilla = retention by gameplay and engaging journey 
---
Two games, two crowds , you may enjoy the two, a majority of original vanilla/TBC/early woltk players are more into the old ways of gaming.
---
Currently Vampire the Masquerade bloodlines, can't wait for the sequel to drop next year.
---
My brother and his friends used to do hide and seek in stockades back in bc/wrath. They would clear the whole dung and then they would turn off their minimap/hide it and take of friendly bars (shift+v). 
---
They were 10 or 11 back then so you guys might not find it as fun as they did, but it might be a fun drinking game though
---
Lupos won‚Äôt deal shadow damage so why are you even mentioning that?
---
Still better than prot...
---
You don't need to play with your friends from the start, in fact it is way more optimal to play apart from each other and meet up a little bit down the line. That being said probably like 20% of bosses in Vanilla have fear and the rest don't so Fear Ward is useless on those, so Human is actually better for those bosses due to their Spirit. I wouldn't sweat it if you don't roll a Dwarf Priest.
---
You said RP-PvE. Also, I never said anything about RP-PvP realms, those names still exist on PvE realms, dum-dum.
---
Can confirm
---
I quit day after Mists of Pandaria, Need to thank them for releasing crap otherwise wouldn't have a life, just when i think would never play wow again blizzard jabs me with a classic blow.
---
OW, Ratchet and Clank series, Souls games, Pservers, some indies.
---
Lmao GDQ is for beta cucks, get out of my face soy boy
---
What is plan
---
Blizz has always been silly like that, though. It's always bugged me even that the male undead dance is him rocking out like a punk in the 80's, even if he's inexplicably flashing the sign for love.
---
Same here
---
I'm just gonna break up. WoW &gt; Girlfriend. Hope she doesn't take it too badly.
---
She doesn't work, so if I stick with her I'd only have enough to keep gaming for about 3 years, maybe 4, without her I can go 7-8 depending on how stingy I get, 10 if I get lucky and don't have to spend the emergency funds but considering how this is likely to affect my health, probably not.
---
&gt; One of the perks of being on an rp server is the lack of names like that.
---
Trying to inform you. Do you always take everything personally, Smoothbrain?
---
Haha, had to go look it up. It's called Dragonblight.
---
I'm pretty sure night elves are the only ones that care about gender.
---
If you get summoned you‚Äôre not running tho ;)
---
People talk about how being a good mage in PvE doesn't take a lot and they're not wrong.
---
Being the BEST on the other hand does.
---
Learn when you can AOE and do it wherever possible. Precast like a madman in whatever situation that permits it. Use fireblast to resposition for better precasting, or use it in combination with scorch when a mob is about to die and the project based attack won't make it in time. Spam sappers during your AOE, and spam dense dynamite in between those instant spells (fireblasts or AoE spells).
---
Keep an AoE set and manage your gear well in raids while managing your mana better by spamming dark runes, mana potions, and mana gems on cooldowns.
---
Good luck, and most importantly, have fun :)
---
The human Spirit bonus is pretty much trivial. The best racial humans have is a 10% rep bonus, which is fucking amazing when you're grinding so many reps in vanilla and it's so tedious.
---
Took one month free from work starting the 15th of July in the hopes it comes as predicted, a few days after. Gonna grind like never before.
---
For the Horde!
---
I was really into Thursday, Armor For Sleep, and Thrice when I was trying to level in South Shore on my main and I think getting ganked so many times seared the moment into my memory and those artists give me flashbacks lmao
---
But then you couldn't kill the faction leaders if you did that :(
---
Still sucks when you're in a city raid because any aoe damage you do can give you a DHK.
---
Cries in responsible adult with job, wife, kids, mortgage.
---
Same reason you can‚Äôtbpush the square block through the round hole. They‚Äôre ncompatible.
---
Those of us clearing our schedules for years to come and has saved money ever since we started making it since there's nothing we'd really like to spend it on, except this.

---

---
It used to be a cool little grassroots event run by speedrunners for charity.
---
Now it's a sterile corporate-feeling form of what it used to be banning anyone for saying anything even slightly offensive. You can't even make jokes during your speedrun anymore. It's crazy.
---
hahahaha
---
Both really, agility gets a solid amount of credit for shamans, like Warriors, it's almost as good point for Point as strength, so you want any gear that has either Stat or both
---
Np
---
Human mages - Now there are female mages out there (Jaina being the best example), but Wizardry has been traditionally very male dominated. There would only be few female mages around.
---
Warrior for all races except Night elf - Just like in our world, soldiers and fighters tend to be male, allthough female's definetely can be warriors, but just like with the mages, theyshould be more rare lorewise. Night Elf Warriors would be predominately female due to their culture, so you can add them to your list.
---
Human Paladins - same as mages. The Silver Hand is very male dominated, but there is no law against female Paladins.
---
Rule 4 buddy
---
Welcome! You are the 10,000th person to make this exact post!
---
Why no quests? Are you literally just grinding to 60?
---
Inner fire increasing melee damage!
---
Will you take valueble time to have intimate moments with eachother or will you prefer to grab some extra EXP before calling it a night?
---
I really love this question. Can't wait for it to be asked again in a new post in 30 minutes.
---
Wizardry in WoW has not been male dominated. Humans learned magic from the elves, who we **know** didn't care about gender when it came to magic, so why would humans?
---
Blizzard has hinted at an early summer release. The July 16th theory is so obvious, they must have put it in on purpose + them saying we can look forward to a Classic summer implies that we'll be playing Classic throughout the summer. A september release doesn't really go along with a Classic summer.
---
I disagree. This time round many folk who played in vanilla, are time constrained. I have a demanding job (well demanding enough that I cant play wow during the day), and I have wife and young kids. I'll prob be limited to playing from 8pm-11pm/12am week nights. (Probably less at weekend).  
---
I've used the guild recruitment discord and on here, to find a like-minded bunch of players from all over Europe, who will have the same playing time. This will heavily benefit me, as I'll have guild mates to help form groups for low level instances, help with questions I have, help with professions I'm leveling, or who I can ask to make me stuff to level if I have the mats (in turn me helping them level up their professions).  
---
I'll still group up with random players while out and about questing, and if I am near to an instance and they are looking for a player to join them.  
---
My own opinion is that communities are also built through players on realms have respect for a guild tag. They get to know which guilds are helpful, considerate, polite....and which ones are rude/ninja's etc.  Players can be /kicked if they  put their guild in a bad light.
---
&gt; I'm actually not experienced in Vanilla WoW gameplay so my knowledge on Vanilla WoW mechanics is very limited 
---
In this case the best first step is get to 60 the normal way to gain experience.
---
Or a desert.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the same? Could you elaborate on that a bit more? Which service did you use and is it as easy as getting a vpn? Google search didn‚Äôt help a lot
---
I kept auto-attack on my hot bar for the longest time before I started just right clicking or using abilities to initiate. I think a lot of people were guilty of this lol
---
I used up debuff slots in raids with rend, mortal strike and deep wounds as an arms warrior. I didn't even realise there was a limit, or that rend was a shit ability.
---
I also was 13/14 when I played, and was embarrassed by my voice on vent, so I would try and deepen it whenever I talked to appear older and manlier lmfao. Blunder years for sure
---
Blizz has come out with a release date just 60 days before the game came out. We're right now at 75 days. Plus, Classic is not the typical Blizzard. Information has been scarce since the announcement.
---
So is City of Heroes actually good? I've followed the news this last month and thought about joining.
---
At least it's something you have control over.
---
A smooth game with like 1500+ players isn‚Äôt too much to ask for. 
---
I would also like to see horde vs alliance population on a server before I make a char on said server. Hopefully there aren‚Äôt too many unbalanced servers.
---
The one you like playing the most because you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time playing
---
I'm concerned about the AQ opening; imagine if they shard that :(
---
whichever class you can tolerate playing 20 hours a day for 2 months
---
Well see
---
Warrior with a pocket healer or a mage.  Maxing out your honor is primarily about doing as much damage as possible to the maxim number of players.
---
&gt;I never made it to Rank 14 and once classic comes out that will be my primary goal. 
---
I've known 2 players who got rank 14.   Both hated themselves for doing the grind and quit wow shortly after achieving it.  The time commitment is enormous if you don't share accounts with someone else(IE cheat).
---
Definitely not new, but I was young during the WC 3/Vanilla era, 11-15, so my play experience was more like a solo RPG for the most part, but I had an awesome guild around helping me out.
---
I'll be providing a sample taste, get them hooked.
---
Not even giving yourself the entertainment of quest lore/goals or the social aspect of grouping? Sounds miserable to be honest.
---
Boomkin, trust me I played vanilla.
---
You're supposed to kill members of the opposing faction, not su-- .. you know what, nevermind. Carry on.
---
I don t believe they talked about pets yet
---
A warrior is gonna top that DPS chart son, you can have third though
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Game will be in 1.12 state
---
Inb4 it's the same guy making new accounts just because he really loves showing off his game manual.
---
the vanilla fanboys are coming out trying to act like shit was harder back then
---
Are you allowing yourself gear above grey / white?
---
Anyway, a Vanilla Iron Man is very easy if you have the patience. Just play a Hunter and once you acquire a pet, just grind level-appropriate mobs to 60. That's stupidly boring though, so I encourage you to do the following:

1) Holy crap, do quests. What's the fun in *no quests* to 60?
---
2) Allow professions, but only from materials you harvest.
---
3) Allow talents, so you get a little more skill diversity.
---
Otherwise, just roll a Hunter. Easily the best Iron Man class due to having a pet plus a focus on ranged attacks
---
Faster meets pulp fiction? Wtf.
---
What if you dont sift anything and just mix thou?
---
This kills the player

Of course. WoD, Legion, and BFA were three dumpster fires in a row I couldn't take it anymore.
---
WoD had the least pruned classes out of the three but no content. Some of the stuff they added was cool like the gladiator's coliseum but of course it was removed after WoD.
---
Legion had a ton of content with terrible barebones classes that get partially fixed from RNG legendaries and an expansion rental piece of gear via the artifacts. Still ridiculously overpruned + pvp talents further removing baseline abilities and making them only usable in pvp scenarios. Also added retarded pvp scaling and ruined casual pvp like bgs. Highlights are return to kara, m+, and mage towers. Argus and broken shore were complete failures. PvP vendors removed for no reason. PvP in general was trash in legion.
---
BFA somehow took the already shit barebones classes of legion and made them worse while also removing legendaries and the artifact system being trash. The new content is utterly terrible and people are showered with gear doing LFR content like warfronts/incursions. Questing was worse than legion/WoD, having literally 0 character progression outside of boring loot upgrades, although the zones were great. People are apparently too stupid to find pvp vendors OMEGALUL.
---
Please use our What Should I Play (WSIP) Wednesday sticky.
---
I'm playing Google docs.  I am theorycrafting my Horde Warrior harder than I've played any game since Vanilla.
---
I don't necessarily mind the actual DHK mechanic, I just find it infuriating that half the mobs tagged as civillians are legitimately part of their faction's armies. I don't think I would actually mind the mechanic if it at least made sense in the context of the setting.
---
For Honor and a bit pserver (lightbringer).
---
My advise would be to do this on your second char. Not your first. But do whatever you want.
---
Easiest to get a premade spot between these 3 are Rogues.
---
R14 gear is equivalent to t2+, but some classes have shit AQ gear, hunters for example, their R14 set still equal/better in some pieces like the gloves for example which is BiS til TBC pretty much, and you end up with more stam so it's still better for PvP.
---
I didn't appreciate stoneskin until I realized pairing it with a shield lets you block full damage from cats since their per-hit damage is on the low side. Using the shield talent in enhancement enables 10% full mitigation to such mobs. Really cool. 
---
I'd probably hold off on the water totem quest, though. All you get is healing stream and then the poison cleanse at lv 22. So there's no rush to do it at lv 20 ASAP.
---
Hyjal.
---
They ruined zones like thousand needles for me and for the love of god, removing the fucking vanilla weather effects was a tragedy. I don't understand how a game from 2004 had stronger weather effects than 2019 WoW. Remember when nights were actually dark? I also hate having quest objectives marked on the map and the removal of class quests.
---
Does OP realize the time commitment he has to put in in order to achieve this?
---
HANDLE IT!
---
Sekiro, Devil May Cry 5, Outward
---
Mine was definitely not knowing about talent points. I was like level 20, and finally got my higher level Brother's help with something and he asked what I'd put my talent points into.....but I didnt have a clue what he was talking about.
---
Whaaaat? That never happens.
---
Well it paid for the subscription, I guess.
---
This sounds incredibly mind numbing, and honestly I don't even know how you would do it without quests.  
---
Most classes will be out because too much integral stuff comes from quests for them.  Mage will probably be your best bet.  
---
This doesn't seem like something that will be fun or worth doing.
---
aye, but we werent meant to go here...haha 
---
you couldnt get here through exploiting. :)
---
I knew what this was even before clicking the link. A classic :D
---
I‚Äôve only ever taken one big break and unubbed during Mists (which I‚Äôve come to regret) and most of Warlords because of school.
---
Joined this sub when I heard Classic was coming out, but I‚Äôve really not been enjoying the echo chamber of hate for the live game.
---
I think a lot of people have gotten used to how easy it is to achieve things currently and completely forgotten just how time consuming the really hard achievements were back then.
---
I hated the theme of MoP besides y'shaarj but the class design was beautiful. I don't think I'll ever like a class as much as I liked MoP warlock or MoP shaman.
---
I don't think so, no
---
That's from a novel from 2006, so whether or not it's even canon is up for debate.
---
It's not even mathematically possible to get it in 2 months. Takes 12 weeks -minimum- and that's assuming always ranking #1 earner on your realm's faction every week.
---
Extra XP.
---
Haven't seen the most important reason yet: Tarren Mill world pvp!
---
I unsubbed before vanilla you guys are all casuals
---
There is room for everyone in WoW. You'll be able to make the most out of your experience. Don't worry.
---
Jarod Shadowsong would speak differently about women being the only warriors and hunters.
---
In all honesty there is no gender class split in any of races or factions. You silly stupid ppl need to stop trying to split hairs with the gender topics
---
The NPCs you see in the NE civilization are the sisterhood of elune (special faction of the priesthood of elune) same with the Sentials (a special unit of priestess who became warriors in the entirety of the night elven army)
---
Idk where u got your info to think only males can be druids
---
If you dare say WC3 models imma smack the shit out of you.
---
;)
---
My partner's a 'Wrath baby' and is excited to be able to experiance what I've been talking about for years.
---
I got lucky af tbh. My Ex hated me playing.
---
Everyone else: let‚Äôs take in the sights and have fun while we get to our destination, we should even rent a nice car for our trip
---
OP: I‚Äôm riding a rusty bicycle with gears that stick and a seat that punches me in the balls every 30 minutes on my trip.
---
Good advice to communicate, I did the same. Told her was my fav game back in the day so I will be playing a lot, she had no issues but when time comes to crunch it will be different story. I think we need to look at the other side of the coin.
---
You don't need to let it completely isolate you from RL, Sure you're going to play a lot but I think it is important to know when to have a break and focus on your RL. Go out with your misses, focus on your kids, spend time with friends, go camping, exercise, do your hobbies. You won't be the first to 60, won't be the first to hold legendary, won't be first to down bosses but you'll have balance and you won't regret it.  
---
unless your regret is going to be focused not getting those awesome wow accomplishments then play like a mad man.
---
Amen. January 2010 was when my sub ran out last.
---
I just like to challenge myself.
---
Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it.
---
So you recommend a 'Troll Beast Mastery Hunter', with 'Mining/Smithing' as my Professions, is that correct?
---
Do Hunters have any good 'Abilities' or 'Pets/Pet Abilities' that are quest locked?
---
I forgot they give quests. Obviously exceptions could be made.
---
It doesnt matter what character. its all about playing time. I got to Marshal on my Hunter, and loved it. I was playing solidly easily 8-10hrs a day. 
---
To get to High Warlord, you really will need to be playing a character that you love as you'll have to spend an insane amount of time grinding honor. Also, you'll probably need to be playing 18hrs a day in the last few weeks grind as you'll need to top the server. 
---
Also, you'll probably need to be running in a premade group to max honor.
---
Definitely! As I was maining Alliance, I never experienced a lot of the Horde dominant zones - Badlands, Silverpine Forest, Thousand Needles, Stonetalon Mountains or Swamp of Sorrows.
---
There were also other zones I only travelled through but never actually experienced through questing, like Hillsbrad Foothills, Ashenvale to a certain degree, Feralas and Blasted Lands (although I dinged 60 there while grinding!).
---
That's part of the reason why I'm probably going to roll Horde this time around, just to experience the game and the world through a new perspective. I'm really looking forward to questing through the zones I neglected 14 years ago!
---
Lol yeh that's pretty much me, I just like playing MMORPG's and giving myself weird self-induced challenges.
---
But I will have a normal account that I will play on also :)
---
If you use a vpn it changes your ip and allows access to sites like YouTube. A tunneling service doesn't.
---
I'm basically suggesting creating a 'new' weather system that looks like the old one.  I'm not a game dev but I am a programmer and it seems to me like it would be quite trivial
---
Luckily for me, I avoid that issue altogether by not having a SO in the first place haha...
---
but classic will fill that void!
---
right?
---
You can‚Äôt even get your pet without doing a quest. Every class has class quests, usually around every ten levels.
---
Thinking August
---
I love platinum WoW. Found his channel recently and his class overviews helped me decide on what to play first when classic comes out.
---
Legion was good, but only if you did play mythic dungeons trying to push keys to high level, else the content was poor if you did not have a good guild for raids. My server was a desert most of the time.
---
Best of luck to you. That just sounds like the antithesis of a good time to me. M
---
Like others have said though, if you‚Äôve never played vanilla before, it‚Äôs a good idea to level your first character normally so you have a grasp on how things work.
---
It‚Äôs also entering a dead time in retail right now. I think 8.2 may end up hitting before Classic though, but either way, I‚Äôll likely unsub for the next month or so.
---
Horde for me. I played Alliance from 2005-2007, when I played on the US servers (brother lived in the states). Then I bought the EU game and re-rolled horde when tBC came out as I had friends on the horde side. I never ever played alliance again after that. Loved Horde, loved Tauren and Orc characters the best. 
---
Sounds bad, but horde PVP always seemed to win more often than not, even in pugs....maybe with the exception of AV (when it was a rush game).
---
Warripr
---
If it's boring, it's ok, I will also have a regular account to play on, so I will be fine.
---
Do Mage's have any quest-locked important abilities?
---
Because I think your suggestion is quiet interesting.
---
An 'Undead Frost Mage', that specializes in pulling groups of mobs and killing them all at once.
---
With 'Enchanting/Tailoring' as my Professions.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
Do any have any better suggestions for the 'race/spec' for the Mage?
---
Also any differing Professions?
---
 I don't think that will be a problem, but either way, I would love it if Guild chat mattered again.  
---
In retail, I don't talk to anyone in my guild because groups for dungeons, raiding, pvp, and world questsare automated and perfect efficient.
---
Doesn't really matter because any guess is a good guess. I kinda have doubts it'll be late summer though since the intent is for us to be able to play during and not the tail end of it. I think July, mid August being the latest with a release announcement either late this month or early next month.
---
There will most likely be phasing in the first few weeks after launch. So i think there will be a beta so they can test it.
---
yep ditto here
---
path of exile
---
Agi &gt; spirit &gt; int &gt; stam
---
Stamina is useless for a hunter since your pet is tanking everything and being healed with mend pet. Spirit and Int are more valuable than stam.
---
You mean groups of friends know each other before the game is released?! \*shocked pikachu\*
---
I play bfa, wont stop either
---
Lately I only play dota auto chess and no matter how well im doing only thought that crosses my mind is: "all this time could have been spent to play classic wow"
---
Welcome to the club :)
---
Some will still exist, but they've been patching bugs in the engine for 15 years.  
---
A lot of exploits will not work anymore, without them having to change the world at all.
---
I will use whatever gear I can make/find for myself, without any other players interference/involvement.
---
So if I loot or make good gear, I will wear it.
---
It's funny that you recommend a Hunter, because someone else did too. But what 'Race/Spec' do you recommend?
---
I will not do quests, sorry.
---
I will allow Professions.
---
I will allow Talents.
---
Don't Hunters use alot of Ammo? I will not be making much money, because I'm not using Quests/Auction House.
---
Are you sure I can afford the Ammo?
---
On one hand &gt; Human/Dwarf Paladin
---
On the other Tauren Warrior
---
Mulgore just has something special that attracts me
---
Azshara
---
Depends on your spec. If you are off-healing with 20 or 21 points in resto then go for str/ap. If you put 21 in elemental then go for +spelldamage, you'll do a bit more dps than a phy damage based enh shaman.
---
people just believe they will get at least part of the original experience but Im pretty sure that LOTS of people will realise very quickly that that is not possible.
---
Exactly... I don't remember people skipping cookie in Vanilla. It's like 3 minutes to kill another whole boss.
---
Name checks out
---
Lol, yes I will also have a regular account.
---
But thank you for the input &lt;3
---
So Pet's are quest locked then? Shame. :(
---
Is there any other canon that retcons this?
---
Yikes man, what is wrong with you? Threatening violence over a topic of discussion.
---
We know of at least 1 case where there is a complete gender split. Night Elf Druids are only males, outright stated by Blizzard in such cases as a pre-WoW Blizzcon talk and supported by other circumstancial evidence, **such as WarCraft 3**.
---
very fun game and a really good helpful community. The community was what made it great outside of the endless hero concepts and builds. Give it a try, cost nothing to join 1 of the 4 servers. There stickies about how to download what you need and run it, pretty simple.
---
Alliance, played Horde the first time and also playing a class I never tried out back then, new experiences all round. I can‚Äôt wait.
---
I tried to like BFA. I got to max level and just... stopped. There's nothing really for me in the expansion. I like some of the features but I don't want to pay for a sub for a game I don't enjoy and refuse to play. 
---
I'm happy to start giving over my money again this summer though.
---
i struggle to even be a mega nerd these days :(
---
It's not hard at all, it's just exceedingly boring.
---
1. Find an on level mob which is separated from others.
---
2. Kill it, wait for respawn, repeat.
---
3. When it no longer gives XP, go to a higher level area.
---
4. Go to 1 until level 60.
---
You'll "spice it up" with learning going to a skill trainer and learning new skills. You can also buy white items at vendors. It's very safe, very boring and not a "challenge" at all.
---
Alliance. Storm wind and Ironforge are just too good. Plus human starting zone is bae
---
That is something you don't see everyday. :)
---
they're rolling RP realm
---
No way it‚Äôs June, they‚Äôre gonna need at least month of beta. And thats being optimistic imo. Remember the pages upon pages of bugs reddit found during the two week demo.
---
You're a good girl.
---
FTH
---
I go back and play every expac for a month, but the last one to keep me on for more than 2 months was wrath
---
Badlands. Blasted lands. Always skip those. Not particularly fond of Desolace either. Or Stonetalon.
---
Yeah, I realize the time commitment and its good for me. One of the things I have always regeted in my life was not getting rank 14.
---
Never really got around to Feralas
---
i am doing that right now thank you!
---
Well going solo based on what I love it was shaman.
---
^^^I'm ^^^sorry ^^^if ^^^I ^^^sound ^^^like ^^^an ^^^ass ^^^here. Do you mean Culling of Stratholme? Because that place IS cool as fuck. I loved seeing the city as a city and not just a burning ruin.
---
The fact they had a few vendors and such that actually made it a functional city was wild. Whoever worked on that dungeon had ALL the time and it showed. I still love it.
---
Terrible. It takes specific (expensive) gear and it's still subpar.
---
Yes it has, read Cycle of Hatred.
---
The Council of Tirisfal was male only. No female wizards.
---
Always been alliance - was when it first launched.
---
Will certainly be changing that this time around. 
---
Undead priest!
---
Loktar ogar
---
why?
---
Seriously mate, it might sound cool but playing 18 hours a day every day for weeks on end is not something you‚Äôll be proud of in retrospect
---
When it comes to Classic it's up to date. Classic and retail are two different things by now when it comes to lore. Also, I've never heard that they retconned Aegwynns story or the Council of Tirisfal.
---
You will not be able to get Rank 7 Conjure Water without a quest.
---
Baldur's gate, total war warhammer, Warcraft 1/2/3, pservers
---
I farmed that breastplate for my paladin before I understood the value of stats. Such a waste of time lol
---
Where can I find the lilies posts
---
You make it sound so boring lol.
---
Thankyou for the support &lt;3
---
Don't worry though, I will be playing a normal account also.
---
18h if you are lucky
---
I kill-stole a Kobold in Elwynn and a player said he'd report me and I'd lose my account.
---
After weeks of begging for my parents to pay for the account - I was terrified.
---
I shut-down my computer hoping they wouldn't be able to find me If it logged off fast enough - and ran away. Didn't log back on for a few days.
---
Was around 10 or 11 at the time.
---
You can have sex during flying times
---
Then roll undead, you know you want to
---
Look at me, getting relationship advice on a gaming subreddit. Fuck.
---
You can buy ammo from vendors, but again, you can‚Äôt even get your pet without doing a quest at level 10. If you are absolutely dead set on not doing any quests, Mage is your only choice, because the only class quest that with a locked ability if the final rank or conjure water.
---
Hahaha you made my morning especially with the last one! üòÇ
---
That's a shame, but not a deal breaker.
---
What level is rank 7 conjure water?, for level 60's?
---
I would suggest playing a melee class or perhaps Hunter, since those are the classes that get the most bang for their buck. A rogue will benefit more from the r14 weapons compared to lets say a shadow priest. Where the shadow priest only get improved stats such as spell damage and int/stam/crit, the weapons dps-capabilities wont be a factor for casters.  
---
Whereas the rogue gets both better stats AND insane weapon dps. The vanilla PVP-system was sort of biased in favor of melee classes :(
---
Sugar free red bull tastes like shit compared to the full sugar one
---
That's how boring my Irl is by the way, I have to resort to this :(
---
This is fun to me lol :(
---
I agree there has to be some kind of penalty for killing Civilians, but the way they introduced DHKs was not a solution imo. DHKs killed city raids especially since players that are ranking in PvP wouldn‚Äôt dare to follow such a raid cus of the risk of getting a DHK by accident.
---
Just... don't.
---
Balzak
---
"Summer 2019" He says! My favorite Blizzard humor. 
---
I don't want to be a Debbie downer, but guys, we seriously do not even have a beta server up yet. 
---
We're honestly going to be lucky if we even get a release *this year*.
---
I'm unsubbed since MoP, and I get back when free stuff happened since for a quick tour. Sometimes play on trial account and maxed out the lv20 content.
---
/thread
---
A notoriously dead wife.
---
Just play the master race horde and you won't have to deal with retardins, other than wrecking them in pvp with your sick wf crits. Lok'tar ogar!
---
The most annoying thing is, In my opinion, that those sorts of activities are exactly why blizz have been relatively quiet on the subject of sharding.  
---
I would suspect the vast majority of the playerbase would be completely fine with things being sharded for a little while after launch, or in specific zones, in the spirit of making the launch as smooth as possible, but we don't have any info on their plans after that.  We don't even know how long they are expecting to have sharding on, or if they even have the ability to limit it to specific zones.
---
It's frustrating, and might mean the difference between me subscribing for 2 years or 3 months.  With what time I have available to play I suspect it would take at least a few months before getting sick of it.
---
I unfortunately have to not tell my SO that I'm playing classic so that she does not find that I'm this much of a turbo nerd.
---
At least you won't have to hide anything.
---
That's interesting man.
---
What 'Race/Spec' combination should I use for the Mage?
---
Also what Professions should I choose?
---
For years.  Private servers have been good, though.
---
somebody needs to buy you a beer
---
If that would be the case, they would likely be at Blizzcon.
---
A 3 months long beta is not necessary for Classic. It's not a full fledged Expansion which has to be tested inside and out. With Classic they just have to test if the mechanics work as close to the original as possible.
---
over 10 days of leveling? 
---
GOD DAMN WHAT IS THIS PHASE 2?
---
if you actually don't want to do any quests, then go mage.
---
Level tailoring + enchanting, craft yourself a wand early and AoE farm to 60. That's the fastest and least painful way of doing it. You can start AoE farm at 14, and AoE is the fastest way to level a mage if uncontested, so basically you just have a hard grind to 14 then smooth sailing the rest of the way. Quests don't really unlock anything signficant for mages except at 60 with the 55 water quest.
---
Yep full time as a Police Officer and took 2 classes, still jammed non stop when I was off.  It's up to you, noone can really tell if you will have enough time, but if sleep is not important you'll be fine
---
N'oh my God... Way too much truth to this post
---
On a pserver I remember grouping up with 4 other warriors. Yes a 5man warrior comp and going in to RFK to do the chest class quest. Btw we were alliance...
---
Feel bad for you man.
---
But I‚Äôm sure classic will be successful enough that after 6 months there will be fresh servers starting up for you to join
---
She aint tho
---
I'm over this question
---
Rogue is kinda bad with rank 14 been there. Rogue isnt is strong noways as ppl rember it and Rank 14 set is soooo bad for Rogue, it only has a purpose in group pvp situations where you get heal, and these are very limited. Sure the Weapons are nice, but it feels like shit getting pve gear in allmost all places then.
---
Druid is weak but kinda cool since it needs the Rank 14 Gear like shadowpriest there is nothing that compares to it, but if you love carrying flags and beeing a anyoing pice of shit, you basicly want 4 pices atleast all the time.
---
Shadowpriest has no gear that compares to rank 14 since he needs the Stamina, but Shadowpriest is kinda limited and sucks against good ppl, but its a class that loves to have rank 14, and is one of the classes where its highly debatable to even switch out one pice.
---
I cant rly recommend Shaman or Paladin, the pvp gear is for both for a absolute meme specc, if you want to go meme go druid, atleast the druid shines in some situations.
---
Hunter Rank 14 is very good too but hunter scales kinda shit with gear, and if you have the skill to perform as a hunter t1 or rank 14 dos not make the difference.
---
Mage loves rank 14 gear, you still need pve gear to make it better but Stamina is hard to come by as mage and rank 14 set will help alot in 1vX where mages needs abit of Stamina.
---
Warlock, are you insane ? your pve set is nearly as good as the rank 14 set no point putting the effort in, a min max guy would like 2 pieces but is it rly worth ?
---
Warrior, jea...these weapons you would like them early on arguable the class that wants rank 14 the most, but what do you want not as a warri, you basicly want everything in record time. 
---
tl:dr : Mage, Shadowpriest, Druid would all love Rank 14 gear and the payback is atleast decent, ofc you still need to have pve trinkets etc. Most classes use 2 pieces or non kinda quick but these 3 like the set way longer.
---
Create an Alliance Warlock. They've always been in demand on every pserver I've played.
---
Once ZG launches they are pretty much ready for raiding when you get the full bloodvine crafted set.
---
I resubbed to unlock the Kul'Tirans thinking that it might reignite the spark to level up a new character but it was short lived.  I unlocked the Kul'Tirans, I got down with the Thiccness, but I couldn't reignite the spark.  
---
I'll be back for classic.  It's not nostalgia either, I tried the private servers to get a taste of what's to come and it was truly amazing how much I did still enjoy the old content.  The last time I truly enjoyed World of Warcraft was vanilla, TBC and Wrath were fun but they also had some really shitty features that chipped away at the soul of the game.
---
Feralas.
---
I played heavily for the rpg aspect of the game in Vanilla. I leveled my hunter in all the wilderness related lonely zones. Azshara, Winterspring, Darkshore, Ashenvale, Tanaris, Silithus etc... If it had trees or eldritchy bugs I was there. I ironically avoided any populated zone because I played on a potato and would play World of Powerpoint anywhere 10+ people were doing something.
---
Hunter is definitely a lot of fun.
---
Tho I have some more cons for you:
---
* Because the DPS is so low, it can be very hard to find a good guild, especially early.
---
* Hunters do have very nice gear from MC/BWL and even Naxx, lots of upgrades and cool shit, but in AQ you have basically no upgrades. A couple of very small stat increases and the potential to get the trinkets(and in that fighting versus rogues AND warriors to get them).
---
pfff NoFear cans with the resealable opening FTW
---
Thanks a lot. Unfortunately.... I have a Mac üò≠
---
You misspelled 2008
---
If you don't want to tank don't say "I can do either".
---
Ok, thanks for your advice, you know alot.
---
What 'Race/Spec' combination should I choose for the Mage?
---
I, and a lot of good players left for Guild Wars when TBC launched.  Nothing like loosing in pvp while wearing full T2 to a rando orc sporting outland greens.
---
After a while in Guild Wars we came back, but probably still spent more time in GW than TBC.  It wasn't a bad expansion, but the entire idea of a level increase really made us angry.
---
Tough crowd üòÇüòÇ
---
Deadwind Pass, There was nothing here for me as druid and it was full of bots/Chinese gold farmers. I made the trip through it once to get the flight path in badlands/SoS.
---
In general there was few quests here but nothing like any "normal" zone,
---
*A queer. (Jokes)
---
Thankyou for your concern sir, I am very high strung.
---
Lol, the amount of self awareness from her was not impressive.
---
I'm trying to decide between a prot warrior and a warlock. I'd like to be raiding, dubgeoning etc. Also, what races would be ideal?
---
Always Horde. Horde is Home. Horde is Family. Horde is Life.
---
I appreciate the concern, and everything written here is spot on.
---
My wife and I got through vanilla without a hitch so I suspect classic will be no different.
---
You don't have to be world class to do speed running. Speed running is just trying to finish games as fast as possible. If a person is bad at speed running, it is still speed running.
---
I quit WoW after WotLK. When the talent trees got simplified all the fun of an odd build went away, and WoW felt like it was catering to a younger and younger audience. I came back for each expansion after that, but I didn't manage to do anything but level to the next max, and then unsubscribing again.
---
I left for good when I couldn't even be bothered to get to max level in Legion.
---
Haha... indeed. Full Shaman Group for maximum amount if buffs.
---
Exactly! Redoing and revamping wasn‚Äôt the problem, it was removing any shred of difficulty. And on top of it, giving players 0 incentive to quest, as spamming LFD was way faster.
---
Everything lost value. Everyone was powerful, so no one was
---
Just play the game normally, if you have never played vanilla before it will certainly be challenging enough for you.
---
Good post, thanks lad!
---
About to give project ascension a try. Could be fun.
---
having 1 feral in a raid is optimal tho.
---
It is looking like I will be a Troll Hunter with Engineering and Mining. I will do both PvE and PvP, but the thing I like the most is raids.
---
Does anyone have any suggestions as to whether Gnomish or Goblin specialization will be best? Both of them have some tempting things, and I am probably not gonna skill Engineering twice to get the BoP items from both.
---
In raiding, sure.
---
Why alliance?
---
Gonna go orc hunter for my main, wich prof do you guys recommend me for geting gold?
---
There are usually less warlocks on ally side because of Will of the Forsaken racial that undeads get.
---
Lok'tar

Staghelm was the leader of the druids after Malfurion did whatever big name faction leaders do when people need them most (abandon everyone \*cough\* Thrall \*cough\*) but Tyrande was the high priestess of the Godess Elune and leader of the Sentinels. She was the one who woke the druids up from the emerald dream at the beginning of Wc3. Once achievements were put into the game she was the one in Darnassus you got the achievement for killing not Fandral Staghelm. I'd argue she absolutely is the leader of the elves and Staghelm is just a bitter druid because his son died and he grew an unblessed world tree. Could be why he got all Q.Q emo and ran away to the fire lands to make the druids of the flame in Cata too.
---
Druids wouldn't have starfall. Treants, roots, hurricane....mass faerie fire? idk
---
what made PvP so much fun was the oddball PvP specs you could make with the old talent trees - like a 31/20/0 "You can't kill me!"-paladin.
---
Oh. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Stoneform is beast in AQ too. Everything there poisons and it's the worst.
---
ill probably play a holy paladin. both for pvp and pve. my dream would be to eventually get geared well and play a holy/reckoning build so i can still play mostly as holy/support with the occasional reckoning one shot in between..
---
Whichever you want. As long as it‚Äôs Troll or Undead.
---
I never played classic so I'm looking forward to it but everything must be balanced, I won't take it to this level.
---
pffffff she's boring to look at
---
I will have a normal account too.
---
The first 2 months of Vanilla Wow will be very exciting, so I will play a regular account for a little while.
---
They both seem like good races.
---
What Spec do you think?

Coolest fight is in Undercity as a Alliance :)
---
I think the only ones that were ever actually outright confirmed were that NE Druids were exclusively male, and the Priestesses of Elune. To my recollection though, a lot of the Paladin orders \*seemed\* to be male-only, although they were never explicitly stated to be. This would make sense since WoW Paladins largely are largely inspired by Christian knightly brotherhoods, which were the exclusive domain of men.
---
I'm really stuck on Warrior Race. I've played on an undocumented server just to help me decide but I'm still stuck. I have a level 27 Tauren, 26 Dwarf, 20 Orc and 20 Human and I'm stuck between them.
---
I reckon I prefer alliance overall; however I find the weird spinning animations of the dwarf and human really annoying whereas the Orc and Tauren look quite great overall. Between them again, I reckon Dwarf and Tauren are cooler but human and orc are better models with better animations.
---
A lot of people suggest skinning + herbalism/mining, and they probbaly have a point with going full gathering. Personally, I would suggest either Alchemy or Enchanting.
---
I initially read this as who's unsubbed from r/classicwow until Classic WoW comes out, which really confused me.
---
When did he ever watch that TV...
---
Nah, got my last exam in the middle of September so it would be better to have it on the 20th. But I srsly can't wait any until then.
---
I subscribed again like two days ago because all the hype made me want to play. I‚Äôm just screwing around a bit until classic comes.
---
vanilla had so many wierd areas that, at the time didnt seem to make any sense. Like darkwhisper gorge in southern winterspring that was filled with superstrong elites and blasted lands that had something similar.
---
The difference is absolutely massive. People have tested this on private servers for years.
---
Just take casters f.ex. During early tiers, a mage will have something like 300 Spellpower from items.
---
A flask add 150 spellpower on top of this. Then you have greater arcane elixirs for another 35 spelldamage, and Shadow Power Elixir (if a warlock) for another 40.
---
For a mage alone that gives you a 60% ( ! ) increase to your Spellpower, and thats not even counting Wizard Oils which gets added later.
---
For melee the difference is even larger due to how all the various different consumables synergize with each others.
---
What server are you playing on?
---
As much as I want this I don't think it will happen. A lot of people are just bored and "done" with WoW, I think that has a lot to do with the declining subs too not just the quality of the game. But the reason I got bored with WoW in Cata after like a month was that I simply didn't like the game and what it was becoming, however I think me and people here are a minority. But time will tell.
---
carried broken weapons around for ages thinking i'd be able to fix / craft something with them at some point
---
Idk how it is for shaman, but Druids need to be mounted for something like 31 seconds to cover the same ground as travel form with a normal mount and 17 seconds for epic. That also requires you to spec into imp wolf for instant cast and I think wolf is only 30 whereas travel is 40%
---
Good advice, OP. My life is not that easy, I also have kids and houses and a car (woe me, right) and my parents recently both died. Been waiting to play this since 2004 (I had started college and wanted to graduate so I quit in my level 30s) and now I need an escape more than ever but it ishopeless. But good advice, nonetheless. I am sure it will help a lot of people, thank you for this.
---
I remember playing a big black tauren warrior.
---
- I learned tailoring because I had a lot of linen and wanted to make some clothes for me...
---
- I lost a couple of weeks in the fields below Thunder Bluff at level 5 because I was trying to find the entrance. Mobs were too high level and I could not get out of it (when I first played wow, I could only play it 30minutes X day every now and the since when we connected the internet, the phone line would not work so we could not receive any call in the meantime)
---
- I did not learn any additional weapon until at least level 45
---
- I was scared of the AH because I thought it used real money
---
Funnily enough, I never really quested in Duskwood considering it‚Äôs quite an iconic zone. I levelled 1 human to 60 and pretty sure I went elsewhere.
---
Love it! Very excited to see what we can do with exploration in classic, which will be more of a challenge with the much less buggy BFA client.
---
Hoping to get my SO to play with me, she's a bit on the fence as she is convinced it's all Nostalgia and she's not thrilled to raid MC again for the 400th time. But it would be a lot of fun to play WoW with her again and just chill and do quests and 5 mans.
---
You will be fine. There are many, many people like you who have a full schedule. I work a similar amount and do other things besides gaming. Back in '04 I was a uni student and I no-lyfed the shit out of vanilla WoW (and loved every second of it). But now? I am in a different space. I play on pservers and have no trouble finding groups, doing content, and getting into guilds/raids, and it takes me months to reach 60. The classic playerbase is older and most of us have shit going on. What is the "current" content in vanilla is very different to retail. The gearing out was slow and the gaps between tiers were not as large given the sometimes odd stats on gear. On a former pserver I was in AQ and STILL was using some "of firey wrath" gear that I bought off the AH on my mage. I think vanilla is far better for meaningful progression than retail, I hate how in retail a new tier comes out and bam, everything is massively upgraded.
---
If you don't like healing, DO NOT HEAL. Classic will be a commitment to your class, it takes ages to level an alt, and even longer to gear your alt properly. If you feel like playing a cloth class, you really can't go wrong with a Mage or Warlock. Particularly a Mage, they are very popular, however they are also stacked heavily all through vanilla. I can never remember on pservers guilds not looking for Mages when recruiting ranged DPS. 6+ in a 40 person raid was common and desirable.
---
I think I'm pretty settled on an Aliiance Cloth-wearer. 
---
I really wanted to try healing, so I joined a private server a while ago and took a priest to 40, doing both healing then ending up shadow. It was pretty fun and it's good to basically be able to join anyone or any group instantly. 
---
I'm sort of feeling the pull of more utility and dps though, like a mage or warlock. 
---
I work full-time so don't really think I'll be able to raid consistently, and I've always enjoyed some solo content. 
---
Mage seems like a lot of fun because of the high damage, they can solo grind lots, they have portals and food/drink for ease and polymorph means you're still valuable in any 5-man.
---
Warlock seems like a lot of fun, being able to solo a lot with the pet, tons of utility.
---
Priest of course gets insta-invited to anything, levelling is boring but very consistent, shadow is great if you want to just go pure caster. Dwarves can be priests and everyone knows dwarves are the best.
---
Man, I'm so undecided. Right now I think I'm leaning towards mage because although they can't heal they have a great toolset. 
---
Help.
---
First character was a warrior. Leveled as arms until 50 or so then fury until 60.
---
Guy who got me into the game also played warrior and *insisted* that you had to stack sunder on every mob. He had probably been told this in the context of tanking, but he told me to do everywhere all the time. Seemed weird to do it while questinng but I was a total scrub and he knew more about the game than me.
---
I put 5 stacks of sunder on every single mob I killed until I respecced fury . . . He had insisted fury was bad. I did it as a joke, but I found that I was killing stuff much faster (plus it was much more fun). It made me realize that I maybe shouldn't blindly follow his instructions . . .
---
Back in the days we were never 40 ppl in MC and onyxia because it was hard to find ppl that was attuned and wasnt saved allready. Can imagine it will be the same once the hype calms down. So you should be able to find a spot i think
---
As concerns the WoW classes and races, I am wondering about a few things:
---
* Are WoW player NE Priests Priestesses of Elune, making them all female - all/some/none?
---
* Are WoW player NE Hunters members of the Sentinels, which would make them all female as well - all/some/none?
---
I got to rank 10 on my resto shammy. I'd just find the best geared warrior and run around healing them. Made for great honor. :D
---
Just be like me and have an SO who's indisposed until October.
---
:(
---
&gt; Are they into hiking (god forbid)
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
I'd say go for gnomish specialization or if you are lvling engineering twice, keep gnomish. I don't see anything that useful in goblin specialization.
---
I played a mage in vanilla retail and onto PC servers, as much as every class bring something to the table, I think Mage is probably the best class in the game overall. Warlocks are pretty great too, not as powerful farming, but you also get free level 40 and discounted level 60 mounts so that's an advantage. Increase are awesome, you're the best healers, and you can be a dwarf which is the best Alliance race. So well, I guess you can't really go wrong with any of them.
---
Almost everyone in my guild was full time in a demanding major or working long peon hours at their first salaried job.  A core of 5-7 no-lifers did all the heavy lifting.
---
Orc.
---
What is the least gear dependable class for pvp? I‚Äôm stuck between alliance mage/lock/hunter
---
Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever going to reach Naxx but I really enjoy pvp, I know alliance lock is kind of gimped because of undead, I know I probably won‚Äôt get a raid spot as a hunter and mages seem overplayed which puts me off. 
---
Anyone got any suggestions? I would consider rogue or only the fact they struggle getting melee weapons between themselves and warriors which they need to be good.
---
Well put
---
I hate the current game, but how are you not able to do precisely that? Old content is still there, sure it's not as relevant as at lvl 60 but you can explore, RP, farm Uldaman for Papal Fez or whatever, the world is still there... Again, I hate BfA, but I like to roam around, play the AH, farm mounts in old dungeons, and BfA does not prevent me doing that, so I don't get your point
---
Mining/engi. Hunters have powerful cash-farming with maraudon solo runs.
---
Wotlk was great, still had vanilla elements left but also lots of quality of life improvements.
---
What would you recommend if my plan was to twink out with buddys at every bracket for a few weeks before moving to the next one? (29,39,49) im looking at feral, spriest, or any recommendation youve got
---
Gnomish, so you get the teleporter to gadgetzan instead of winter spring, which is close enough to Orgrimmar
---
I secretly hope it comes out on August 16th. Okay maybe not so secretly now.
---
Even if the good caster weapons are not in at the start, dont underestimate how good the Staff for some classes.
---
The Stamina is SOOO good for Shadowpriest its 200 HP more then all other weapons you will love it for duels where a big hp buffer is needed.
---
Lock is also more gear dependant than mage and Hunter IMO
---
&gt; I know I probably won‚Äôt get a raid spot as a hunter
---
Not necessarily true, raids usually have a couple hunters in their roster.
---
I used to wander around spamming Mark of the Wild to all and sundry, till one day in Ashevale I didn't check and got flagged for PvP (RP server) and a bunch of higher level horde twatted me and then corpse camped me.
---
They are
---
Have been for many years.
---
I used to twink at 19 a bit and to be honest any class with twink gear is going to be incredibly strong in the bracket.
---
I took a rogue, mage, paladin and warrior through and it was easy for all of them to basically never die.
---
The big 19 winners with the very best possible twink gear were warriors and rogues but to be honest you won't have the enchants available to you to really see that pronounced advantage. 
---
I guess it depends what you want to do, run flags or kill people like the terminator. Also remember that some of the twink gear is horrendously rare. 
---
So I think really your options are to just be in a premade, in which case you'll probably win anyway. 
---
So.. er.. in conclusion, play what you want.
---
I was working full time when vanilla was released. But I didnt have a GF or kids.  It was fine to play and raid/PVP. I cleared MC/BWL/AQ40, and only just got into naxx when tBC was released. 
---
Now I have a pretty demanding job, wife &amp; kids. I am aiming to play 8pm-12am most nights, sitting on the sofa watching TV &amp; socialising with the wife. I have found a good bunch of folk in the same situation, and will be rolling as a guild from level 1. 
---
Best thing you can do would be to find a guild that suits your play times and circumstances, level with them as you go, and as long as you are a good player, helpful, get your char as well equiped as you can, get pots/elixers, enchants you need....and are ready on time, and dont cause drama.....then you'll easily be able to raid.
---
What levels were you at where mobs were one shot by a mage? I was leveling my mage a while back and even with full heirlooms mobs were still hitting hard and had massive HP bars.
---
Classes became shit, they ran the story into the ground real hard.  Garbage D3 wanna-be.
---
I will never unsubscribe... I love the game
---
I like world pvp, farming and raiding, so I was stuck between rogue and a shadow priest. At least with a rogue I feel I can get away with switching my specs less, pick my fights and I won't be so limited by mana
---
I feel the same way like you. I'm playing Skyrim for the \~20th playthrough to pass the time, and it's quite relaxing and helps to divert my attention but I just wanna farm some GODDAMN HERBS IN ASHENVALE ALREADY MAN AND I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER I'M AN ADULT THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
---
Shaman is more needed for premades, actually.
---
Breath of the Wild
---
Full time work 38-45 hours /week isn‚Äôt really that bad. You can still find another 30 hours a week for something pretty easily if you want to. Relationships/family is what really destroys your available time.
---
I wish.
---
Held out hope that it would get better and stuck through Wrath and first raid of Cata.
---
I actually just started dark souls a couple weeks ago. 
---
I also finished RoC hard campaign recently and am barely into frozen throne 
---
I also played some diablo 2 single player, and was looking at some mods but probably won‚Äôt have time.
---
Also was looking at Skyrim mods but again probably won‚Äôt have time.
---
Literally since Wrath.
---
Vanilla encounters were not designed around addons. Modern encounters are designed for having like 5 addons for boss mechanics. That's the difference.
---
Meta in Classic will be all about speed clears. It's more about knowledge rather than perfect execution.
---
I would reccommend it if you go hardcore. Truefaith is arguably better than tier 2 chest, especially for longer fights. However, it's all very close. Robe from Baron is almost as good. Just prepare mats and plan it out while you level from 50-60. Same with Hide of the Wild. Focus on going Stratholme in general at the end of leveling. Aim is to get: Truefaith pattern, Archivist cape +healing. Shoulders from Balnazzar is heavily underrated as well. Stocking up on Rightous Orbs is always good, and they sell really well. So plan no 2 for getting pattern is to gather up enough during those runs, to sell and buy the pattern. It's an enjoyable dungeon as well, lots to MC, shackle, good amount of healing, stack up on filler pots like greater mana potions from the crates + loads of runecloth.
---
Shame it's not for classic. I think once that time comes around it'll be added as another game on the bNet launcher as they'll want to keep the games separate so people don't keep logging into the 'wrong' version of the game.
---
Horde is Shrek
---
Most people...
---
&gt;BFD to the murloc and getting that sweet +15frost damage
---
never heard of that buff, what is it?
---
WoW is a hell of a lot cheaper and infinitely more rewarding.
---
Absolute classic. I remember in TBC me and my friends watched this together in Ventrilo and laughed until we cried
---
Keep telling yourself you only play 11 hours a week to clear mythic. In theory yes, in reality you play 20h+ to analyze raidlogs, reading class discords, sim your gear for different fights, setup your addons etc. Grinding perfect azerite traits and azerite power not even included.
---
Gnome melee
---
Goblin ranged
---
Neck is from 1.4 so phase 2
---
I lol'd
---
I'm kind of torn on this, on one hand I think the levelling experience is better as Horde (Wailing Caverns, RFK, SM..), but on the other hand part of me wants to roll a human paladin and mete out justice across Lordaeron and hopefully smite some undead rogue pest! (Been playing W3 too much recently)
---
Decisions, decisions...
---
Which is a great point your being up, vanilla raids were designed for no addons. All of a sudden you have decursive and the 1 mechanic of the boss is done by an addon.
---
go warrior/paladin(or priest if horde) and smash your way through everything.
---
My first character was a tauren warrior.
---
When I was fighting a mob I would sometimes just use a series of hamstring til it died, cos I somehow imagined that all my attacks did the same amount of damage and whichever bonus applied through that spell to a mob didn't really matter as it was just a mob and not another player.... 
---
I reached level 44 in a few months and gave up. I couldn't find more quests to do in the whole map and grinding mobs was too tedious for me. I didn't play for months after that until a borrowed a friends level 60 lock. My first character I levelled all the way myself was in TBC.
---
Is a priest a good choice for someone looking to level fast and not have to compete for raid spots, I also want to heal so I think this might be the best choice
---
I usually play for a few hours then realize I don't have time for this anymore üòî
---
By all account vanilla was an amazing game but it was in no way perfect.
---
Some issues might be a matter of perspective but the debuff limit should be a common one. Hardware limitations forced players toward a less satisfying experience, which was neither the dev nor the player intention.
---
Balance, itemisation and the failure to make some spec work are others issues imo but some may disagree (the greatest paladins in the lore like uther, morgraine, arthas ect all seems to be retribution, yet it was the worst talent tree in the game iirc)
---
Classic could have been an opportunity to fix the debuff limit but both the community and the devs are affraid to change anything that might affect the vanilla experience, which is fair imo.
---
I hope you still gave it a shot. If not you missed out on the greatest class design this game has seen for the majority of classes, for a very silly reason. The aesthetic was great too, loved the eastern feel.
---
Pick the one you always wanna have to look at, and the faction aesthetics you prefer.  No one besides you is going to care what race you've chosen.  You won't lose a raid spot or nothing.
---
I don't think you're honest. You're not killing anything with 1 or 2 shots as a mage. I'm saying it because I leveled mage just a year ago. And no boss takes 2 secs to down, in contrary most of bosses in dungeons are taking quite a sizeable chunk of time to kill.
---
Yeah. Druids are faster levelers. Priests are a bit slow, but steady with little downtime. You will always have a spot of you go Dwarf.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=8733
---
Here it is. There's a murloc optional boss with a big shiny pearl, if you click the pearl you get the buff. It's really easy to run through the dungeon without pulling too much, I timed it to 12 mins from darn with epic mount as a mage ofc.
---
2 days official. In reality they play 3-5 nights a week. I know what I'm talking about. In Legion I was in a "2 days" guild and everyone played much more.
---
I dont know. But you can try if you like living on the edge.
---
Not as good
---
GM Island.
---
Thanks, I might look into playing a Druid some more.
---
When I could learn Taunt I chose not to, because after reading the text I thought...‚ÄùWhy would I want something to focus its attacks on me?‚Äù
---
Some of the examples here are extra special.  I was 10 or 11 at the time and I'm starting to think I was a pretty smart kid after reading the stuff you guys did  üòÇ  üòÇ 
---
Only thing I can really remember was getting ganked 3-4 times in the lake shire inn by a high level horde druid before I realised what was happening. I had never seen one before and I thought it was a really powerful mob that was bugged and kept agroing me from a great distance away.
---
They are awesome. Some people are just tired from 10 years of warcraft and some people don't like changes from classic RPG gameplay.
---
There is actually a wand from the paladin epic mount quest line summons a boss in Scholomance that has 11 intellect. It's really underrated. The +healing green wands will have nerfed stats like 15 healing instead of 30 ish. So they won't be as strong
---
Frost ofc for aoe leveling. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VZZMhMIsfpho
---
Start with frost, must pickups immediately is imp blizzard 3/3 artic reach and frost channeling, the shatter is the last points before ice barrier. 
---
As for race, if you going ally I very much recommend gnome. If you are going horde then both works. Troll is fun for PvE, undead is fun for PvP. So  if you plan on pretty much any kind of pvping when you finish your goal go undead, if not go troll.
---
Alliance
---
I've heard that said, but I can't see the reasoning behind it.
---
Me :)
---
This sounds like a great idea. I myself am attempting to learn Spanish since my wife and her entire family are from Mexico. 
---
I never thought of this approach but it seems it would work well.
---
I'm not. I like BfA. But I think that I'll like Classic even more. And honestly I'm a bit tired from all those warcraft years, my social life in WoW kind of sucks recently, so yeah, if Classic won't turn me on, I'll either unsub or go full casual M+ pug pushing mode.
---
No, Stormrager was from the start of vanilla. I played then, and got it. Wand of Eternal Light was added 1.10 during the updated. I got it then as well back in vanilla.
---
This
---
Do you think it is easier for a player like us choosing mage over warlock ( raidspots, pug groups).
---
I like the opening description you give, it's effective. I completely disagree of course, I think it's nice that wow took an opportunity to not be the super serious game it was until that point. It needed breathing room to tell new types of stories. I wish more people gave MoP a shot. Throne of thunder was awesome.
---
1. What mobs exhibit a CC/snare/slow immunity?
---
2. Can they be avoided?
---
3. Your thoughts on the best class to team up with to handle them?
---
Mages never were that tough for me. Warlocks are tougher than mages because succubus...but slice and dice fixes that.
---
Mages are going to sheep -&gt; blink -&gt; pyroclasm so you preparation -&gt; vanish -&gt; sprint -&gt; ambush yadda yadda yadda and they typically drop.
---
The classes that give trouble are the ones that can force a Rogue out of their skill rotation and mitigate damages.
---
If you‚Äôre on my server I will never turn down an invite to group with you.
---
Kind of you to say. I can see where you're coming from and, though I loathe that expansion in my bones, I actually believe that MoP wouldn't be such a bad experience as something you temporarily level through because it definitely did have a unique aesthetic and tone. The problem was that it was *all there was* so, when it didn't work for me, there was no alternative. 
---
Plus LFR and personal loot were both formally made part of the game (I'd retained a modicum of hope that LFR was a failed experiment in 4.3) and the dailies grind to get into the first tier of raiding quickly became a chore.
---
But you still only need to do like 4 zones to get to 60. And if I go to Wrath at 60 for example I only need to do like 1,5-2 zones to get to 80. And then when I get to WoD I level through the expansion in less than one zone. Even in BfA you only need 2 zones and a bit to get to 120. 
---
If they would make everything scale from like lvl 20 and up I would be fine with it. Because I could probably do an entire expansion and get to 110 that way, instead of doing the first zone in 5 different expansions and getting no cohesiveness to it at all. 
---
Especially as someone who has not played most WoW expansions at all, I would love to go through the content at some point, but I really won't go back on my main and grind through meaningless quests just to see the usual shitty story. If I could take an alt and play through Legion for example while still getting something out of it I would be pretty happy.
---
I'm sending my wife and kids to live with her parents for six months.
---
Is this fake? Why the fuck would there be all that grass in any town? Why would it be in a frozen wasteland especially?
---
Hard to quest in a zone with nothing in it lmao.
---
Mods should probably just remove you from this environment as you're clearly unable to conduct yourself appropriately in a space where you're left to regulate yourself.
---
Ignorant and violent is a pretty serious combo chief.
---
Night Elves live in a mathriarch socity with very difined roles for males and females for centuries, with women being priests and warriors and men being mages and latter druids, but this is slowly changing thanks to the influence of their allies.
---
If you want an example of good PvP or good class design, you'll need to go back further than legion lol.
---
Alliance are disgusting.
---
I'd say in terms of leveling that they are middle of the pack, slower than hunters and warlocks but faster than warriors and paladins. In terms of raiding spots, healer priest are always sought after because they are the best healing class in the game.
---
Goblin has grenades exclusive to it I believe. Could be wrong.
---
He loves metal, my guy
---
Well yeah that‚Äôs why I said pvp is continuing its downwards spiral since Legion. The last time I actually had fun in PvP was in MoP but then again I played a warrior which were OP because of Second Windüòå 
---
I miss TBC PvP the most.
---
**Hunter**, **Warrior** or **Shaman**?
---
Long time vanilla veteran, so I know the general pros and cons. I've mained **Druid** most of my WoW life, but for Classic I'm looking to switch it up.
---
Generally just want advice from the **Hunters/Warriors/Shamans** out there. Why should I roll your class over the others?
---
I'm going to be getting into all aspects of the game, looking forward the most to Phase 2 world PvP.
---
No matter the class I'll always roll Tauren.
---

I do exclisively drink water. I've also been on keto for a decade cuz I'm not even a huge fan of carbs. You guys assumed I was morbidly obese or something but I'm not, I just eat a lot of bacon and my family has a long history of males dying of heart attacks from eating bacon.
---
Assuming it's a stationery, not a laptop?
---
At that point you cannot really improve it any further except to make sure no power saving is happening while gaming (max performance or whatever Windows calls it in power settings.)
---
Windows Defender takes a ridiculous toll on write performance, but since WoW really only writes data during client updates it's not important. Updates are bottlenecked by your download speeds.
---
Also kudos on the hardware. Same as mine. It's a real beast.
---
You should already be able to max out everything at 4k in WoW, and that CPU is *more* than capable of handling anything WoW throws at it.   
---
You may have to turn down a few settings when raiding, since spells wreak havoc on the GPU. That's only if you're gaming at 4k though.
---
Wont play
---
Isn't the night elf female in the vanilla cinematic a druid?
---
[Goblin Bomb Dispenser](http://classicdb.ch/?item=10587), are you talking about this one?
---
Everything was OP in mop and I loved it. Such fast paced action.
---
I'm half tempted to play a hunter, but as I have significantly less time these days I think I'll pass.
---
It really depends what my best friend plays. I'm going to run a class to support him. Whenever he's not online when I am though I'm probably playing a Night Elf hunter.
---
I learned english mostly from gaming online. Its the best way to put your knowlage into practise.
---
1)  I sold all my equipped gear to buy full white gear from the vendor in redridge and when I realised my mistake, I didn‚Äôt have enough gold to buy back.
---
2) I begged for a weapon from a lv 60, got a blue sword . Wanted to enchant it so i learned enchanting and disenchanted it...
---
I unsubbed at some point in 2010 after cata
---
Thanks for this talent tree advice.
---
I don't know much, but I will save this link &lt;3
---
Do you want to play Classic?
---
If yes: play it. 
---
You were not put on this planet to be at another person's beck and call. 
---
I know how difficult it can be sometimes with this stuff and it's a shame you are in this situation but look, you shouldn't have to compromise yourself like that for your wife or anyone else to love you.
---
Be yourself and come play Classic with us if that's what your heart is telling you.

In traditional Night Elf society there is a clear distinction between male and female gender roles. Beyond the civilian sector, women could progress to the formal military or the priesthood while men could only progress into the Cenarion Circle. Recently, because of the losses from the Third War, the Night Elves have lifted the restrictions on their society, yet women still hold the majority in the temple and military while men hold the majority in the Circle. A common misconception is that the majority of men became druids, leaving the women behind to enter the Emerald Dream, the realm of Ysera the Aspect of Nature. However, this was not the case and in truth only a small number of men were druids. This meant that a large portion of the populace was male during the 10,000 year period between the War of the Ancients and the Third War.¬†
---
Another misconception is that men were/are looked down upon in Night Elf society. This was and is not the case. There is no proof that such opinions were held. In truth, because Night Elf men had only one path beyond the civilian sector, while women had a few more choices, this would ultimately lead males down the path of being artisans, traders and hunters, all key facets of a society. Men could be warriors, archers or scouts, holding those skills without being in the formal military, similar to how one can own a gun without joining the army in modern life.¬†
---
Because the gender roles have been lifted, males can become Sentinels and priests, while women can become druids. It is important to recognize that there is a vast power gap in these positions. The restrictions were only lifted less than ten years prior to the current timeline. This means that your male priest or Sentinel or female druid will only have at most a decade of experience compared to the hundreds or thousands of years the opposite gender possesses.¬†
---
&gt; Warlocks have the slight edge in class quests but Druids
---
By slight edge you mean overall [38 class quests for druids](https://classicdb.ch/?quests=4.-263)  vs [94 class quests for warlocks]https://classicdb.ch/?quests=4.-61?
---
after druids get their aquatic form at level 16, there are no class quests AT ALL for them for the REST OF THE GAME. when warlocks get a consisntent class quests through out their whole way to 60. and an amazing epic mount chain at 60 ON TOP OF THAT. obviously druids got no chain at all at 60.
---
In what world is it a slight edge? they are incomparable. 
---
druids basically only got 2 quests: bear form (lvl10) and aquatic form(lvl16). and a poison quest which is a tiny one. 
---
THATS ALL. FOR THE WHOLE GAME.
---
honestly, im just typing it so ppl would get a wrong representation reading a person saying druids are about the same to warlocks in class quests.. its a ridiculous. i don't like when misinfomation like that spread across. seeing how upvoted this comment is. and that many ppl will look up to it.
---
I don't exactly read through all the quests, no, half of them are just filler anyway. I just skim the quest text if there's anything interesting. But I follow along the story, I don't just blast through everything. 
---
But in most (good) hack&amp;slash games there is actually some challenge, you can't just play them basically AFK, that was my point (and story is usually secondary). And it's not a good story driven game either, seeing how much filler quests there is just to pad out the time you spend levelling. They could make it pretty decent, some quests are nice, but then in between the nice ones they add a bunch of standard MMO crap, basically "go kill X cause reasons".
---
1) Kinda. In Classic/Vanilla, all NE Priests are worshippers of Elune, and the class quests indicate that you are a member of the organisation. Officially, when the Night Elves joined the Alliance around the start of WoW, they went through a big societal upheaval where their gender roles in their society were abolished. However, this was pretty much just a case of "change the lore to fit the mechanics". Blizzard didn't want to restrict classes by gender, so they just fudged it and declared "men can now channel the Goddess, women are now allowed to train magic (Druids), and there are absolutely no consequences to destroying one of the cornerstones of one's society."
---
2) Definitely not. Hunters in WoW are much more individualistic, rather than part of an established organisation. Even when you do interact with the sentinels, they never treat you as one of their own. It's kinda like asking "are all Human Warriors members of the Stormwind City Guard?" The Sentinels are NE Hunters, but not all NE Hunters are Sentinels.
---
We would have played together at launch with my love but we've got a daughter born, so we've got a long quest ahead.
---
priests aren't really that squishy at all.
---
If you're a Dwarf not really.  Desperate Prayer is actually really good for that kind of situation.
---
This might sound like an odd parallel but - what wow class would you say is most like baptiste from overwatch?  I love that hybrid combat medic style of play where I can pitch in offensively here and there but am mostly a healer/buffer to the rest of the team.  I like the decision making aspect of when do I heal/buff vs attack the enemy.
---
From what I‚Äôve read a 0/30/21 Druid is similar, as is a 30/0/21 shaman, but I‚Äôm curious if a priest back be specced that was as well.
---
Almost certainly going horde but I‚Äôd be open to alliance if paladin fits the bill.
---
Man i always wanted to get to that airport, spent maybe a few hours trying in vanilla haha, I remember flying over once on the way to menethil and seeing some one up there and i was like how the fuck? haha good times.
---
I just "love" the loud noises of those motorcycles... So immersive... Not...
---
You also need to remember that dungeons in Classic *require* crowd control. You can't faceroll through them.
---
Rogues are invaluable for sap. Mages are invaluable for sheep plus water fountain duties. Warlocks are invaluable for fear in some circumstances. 
---
Every class brings something unique to the table in Classic. If you want a guaranteed spot roll healer or tank, but you're still in demand as DPS, you just fulfill different requirements.
---
And don't forget, one of the best things about Classic was building a *reputation*. The server community *learns* who is a good DPSer. If you're good at your class it doesn't really matter what that class is.
---
you're talking about narrative. he's talking about mechanics.
---
I used to take care of Alzheimer patients for a living. Maybe that is part of where my mentality comes from, although my family has no history of it.
---
Ive told my girlfriend that the past year I've strived to do everything I can for her. When WoW classic comes out, I want at least a week of pretending I don't exist. We live together so it's gonna be hard.
---
Im basically sacrificing my credit card to her so she can do whatever she wants.
---
Rip
---
I played vanilla when it released and made it to level 29 as a hunter. I tried to farm a harpy claw bow that was a rare drop. Think i spent a week farming harpies and then quit. Came back in wrath as a healer. Quit in cataclysm.
---
Is that why she is your ex? ;)
---
Summer in May? It's may now and I'm freezing cold with a thick coat outside :(
---
Please do a few hunter PvP videos..... I‚Äôve run out of content to sustain me until release lol
---
First time i unsubbed was at TBC after i finnished questing on hellfire peninsula because i was sad that the old world 60 zones were abadoned and raids useless. Came back 2 Month later because of friends and had fun getting a nether drake. Then i left sad how empty the old world felt and everyone was in this "New World".
---
Then i got back to Wrath till Dungeonfinder. Gifted my 5000 Gold to a random guy.
---
Got invited to test Cataclysm for 7 days. I was outraged they overhouled the old world and made it an action fiasco and of cause: Destroyed Barrens.
---
Mist? Skipped.
---
Came back to Warlords because of my brother inviting me and legion was near. Just wanted to play WoW again because i missed it. I went with the stream and got Heroic Argus down. Felt just not like WoW overall but i just saw it like "Another game wich is action based" after i gave Wildstar a try. I went into bfa and after i finished story zone quests, the gating wich annoyed me in legion was still there. So much things annoyed me so i'm still unsubbed.
---
In classic there is nothing like that, if you are a healer you heal.
---
Maybe priest if they bring you for the shadow debuff
---
I'm from western europe and summer is considered until the 21st (or 20th?) of september.
---
But socially speaking summer is usually considered june - august, usually the hottest months of the year.
---
Yeah, Blizzard updated the lore with the launch of WoW to get rid of the gender divide in Night Elf society. The narration for the starting cutscenes of NE Priests and Druids even mention the gender divide, but only as a passing mention with "after the war we decided to open our ranks to the other gender as well to increase our numbers."
---
This lore change was entirely driven by mechanics, because Blizzard didn't want to restrict classes by gender. There was never a well established narrative for when/how exactly this happened AFAIK... the Night Elves just destroyed one of the cornerstones of their entire civilisation sometime between WC3 and WoW, and there are literally no repercussions to be felt in-game.
---
Currently I‚Äòm still in ‚Äûvanilla‚Äú zones and playing as a arcane mage with heilrooms until lvl 60. around 30 I only need one arcane missile or maybe 2 to down mobs.
---
I was talking about ‚Äûworld bosses‚Äú during quests you have to down after doing some quests before. You know? Killing 8 minions etc and afterwards you down the ‚Äûboss‚Äú. Dungeons bosses need a little bit longer thats true
---
DHK are made in a really terrible way and really serves no real purpose in preventing prolonged griefing.
---
With that said, I'd be fine either way. I understand the no changes mentality and I can see why you'd want to keep it for that reason but since it's so bad I think in a way it's more blizzlike to fix it rather than keep the broken version.
---
Slow fall! Haha great times!
---
I just quit my sub again, after having re-subbed in March. The reason I re-subbed was because I was curious about the new landmasses, and the new allied races. And I gotta hand it to Blizzard's art team, they know how to make impressive, atmospheric environments. They basically kept my sub going for a second month, because just riding around Nazmir was pretty fun.
---
Apart from that, the game itself does *nothing* for me any more. The leveling experience is so dull you can *feel* your brain cells commit suicide one by one. Professions are pointless except for transmog (and tailoring for bags, with the Draenor bags still being competitive, which means if you want bags, you better visit and grind your garrison daily). Hell, 95% of the entire substance of WoW, expansions and all, are pointless except for transmog. The whole progression system is pointless. The writing is basically "whatever looks cool and feels epic", which doesn't appeal to me at all (I'm a big fan of cohesive, coherent writing). When I ask myself "What am I playing for?", I come up with "because it's still fun to run around the world and look good doing it", but there is no reason *to* run around the world.
---
I'm probably happier with alliance overall; however I enjoy horde animations more. On the other hand, alliance win BGs more which is a plus for me. I don't like competing with paladins for plate gear though, its annoying. So probably Dwarf or Tauren when it comes down to truer favourites.
---
I moonfire spammed mobs.
---
Rekt me.
---
I used to do that, really fucks up your eyes though if you do that from night 'till sunrise. Nowadays I always have a light on which is way better on the eyes.
---
This Everlook thumbnail looks ridiculous
---
There's plenty of shitty people on both sides of the fence.
---
Both prot warrior and warlocks are great for both raiding and dungeons, so it all depends on what class you feel suits you better. Prot warriors are obviously always needed for dungeons, which makes findings groups a piece of cake. However, prot warriors take a great deal of work, so if you wanna get those raid spots you have quite a hard competetion.
---
When it comes to race, my knowledge is limited to horde. Orc for warlock. For prot warrior it's orc or troll. Orc get bonus to axe skill which helps with threat per second. Trolls have the highest threat per second when they pop berserking. Now if you're looking to play casually, go with whatever race you want. No one will blame you.
---
Plus, caffeine pills won't fuck up your stomach lining. Energy drinks are seriously terrible for you if consumed regularly.
---
unsubbed since 2007; level 61 was game-breaking.
---
YES! Same here except I played Wrath for a bit too. But logged in a few months ago amid peak-Classic hype. Saw motorcycles, logged off in horror.
---
Is it true that "warlocks suck without really good gear in PVP"?
---
I'm set on Warlock (I played TBC back in the day so I know the class) but I keep hearing how without like epic gear you can't do anything.
---
Its very discouraging because I can't nolife this time around but my main interest is PVP and people make it sound like without hardcore raiding for a long time to get top gear you are weak af in PVP
---
I resubbed in the vain hope of a beta invite.
---
lol same.
---
my gf is cool tho. 10/10 looks + smokes pot and does videogames with me.
---
30/0/21 is the only real "meta" hybrid that is effective in PVP, you need to constantly be purging, earth shocking, using totems to benefit the team, killing low health targets and healing in danger allies.
---
I don‚Äôt think you know what that word means
---
yes, but so will every other class, including other rogues and warriors :)
---
Then kindly vacate the subreddit and post pointless dribble elsewhere.
---
Just resubbed last week as I had unsubbed for a around 6 months because the Azerite trait grind, lack of PvP vendor and repeat grinding instances rat-in-a-maze fashion was getting seriously tedious. The break was well needed.
---
Had a bit of time to chill out on that and reassess what I want from the game. Now I‚Äôm seriously enjoying PvP and some general fuck about with my Rogue, newly levelled Hunter and soon to be levelled through Arena (when I find a Rogue duo partner) Mage. Spent 4 hours in Stormwind recently on my Rogue just killing lonely players and hiding from the hoard of players (an Aliiance hoard) trying to hunt me down. Super fun, more people need to be doing this.
---
Really looking forward to the new zone in 8.2 and some actual world PvP since were all going to be questing in the same zone FINALLY!
---
Alliance are NPCs, so I'm not sure I understand your question.
---
Shadow Priests Melt Faces...HUGE WoW meme back in the day...it was not a lie
---
LFG, LFM ,Gz, Ding, Inv, Hi, Buff, Thx, lol, Need, Leave grp, Share Q's, pls, ninja, noob, tank, dps &amp; healer. These are 90% of the words used while playing, so not sure if it helps that much improving language skills. Many ppl dont even know what LFG &amp; LFM stands for üòÇ
---
I mean the real excellent advice would be to limit your playtime to maybe a couple hours a day so you don't have to schedule it so extensively with your SO...
---
Nah. Fuck that. Nolife this shit.
---
As a married father of three young kids, at classic release I'm going to be very jealous of the turbo nerds and their lack of responsibility outside the game.
---
One of my best Vanilla memories was me seeing one such mage during leveling (I was around lvl. 32 I think). He was struggling, low hp and mana, so I dotted the mobe in the pack, and saved him.
---
One tell _"thanks...wanna go together?"_ and one click on the okay button later, we were duo-aoe/dot-lvling for 5 hours straight, including run-ins with some alliance people.
---
A Song of Ice and Fire indeed :-)
---
We stayed friends for years after this episode, until he quit the game in late WotLK.
---
Thats some high quality H20
---
Same.  Classic leveling is that perfect balance between relaxing but still challenging enough to be interesting.
---
Mage for sure. Polymorph, blizzard aoe, decent dps without much investment in gear (bloodvine set comes to mind). I want a mage in every dungeon I do for their utility. Portals and food too. My guild took in 6 mages to raid in ZG MC BWL and AQ 20 on private servers at which point I quit (because official servers got announced). I played as a mage to clarify. Just a very desirable, self reliant class without the nuisances that warlocks have in soul shard farming or hunters with pet and ammunition maintenance. It is the perfect class for OP imo.
---
warlock rank 7-10 gear is very strong and provides you with plenty of stamina and SP, which is what you need as a warlock to stay alive.
---
It's not fake. This dude just used console commands to set ground clutter higher than ultra. If you go in-game and type:  
---
``/console groundEffectDensity 256``  
---
you'd get the same effect as in the picture above. (128 is default value for ultra high graphics). You can check this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esjIBC41fXI) if you want a better explanation.
---
Based NEET
---
Yeh
---
I'm okay with this since your summer is my winter
---
Alliance in vanilla, horde in Tbc, because Liquid Snake makes a cameo as blood elf male.
---
Well, I kinda skipped Thousand Needles...couldn't figure out how to get to anything :P
---
priests are favored against both
---
I didn't know about the tram between SW and IF and walked to IF. Took ages to get thru burning steppes.
---
Sounds about right. I have a Dark Iron, leveled as Prot Warrior, without pots/buffs, not even full heirlooms (I'm lazy), did not streamline my leveling at all - just bungled along. She's currently 112 nearing 113, /played reads 2 days, 3 hours.
---
That would legit be summer here. In NZ &amp; Aus our santa wears shorts and singlet. Too hot for a heavy-ass polyester suit
---
I'll let these videos speak for themselves:
---
https://youtu.be/na7AevF49_4
---
https://youtu.be/5pppfBoQdAY
---
Because I was young and dumb and didn't know any better at the time.  
---
\^\^ Feel free to copypasta that and use it as a catch-all in the future.
---
Seriously, was there anything there besides some leatherworking quests? It's my favorite zone and I've spent the least time there haha.
---
I actually resubbed because I‚Äôm sick of playing BR games and wow classic has my loins tingling for MMOs. It became too great and I cracked and subbed.
---
I sure hope we see classic before August.
---
More like Heroic/Normal/LFR are difficulties for casuals to experience the content, while Mythic is the real thing.
---
The WoW movie showed female orc warriors
---
His desk is to clean..fking casual
---
Waiting for the day that EU gets random name generator because I can't come up with names and settle on them happily.
---
These types of posts are the reason I probably won't be able to enjoy Classic the way I want to. My girlfriend is fine with me playing it but she won't play with me. I'll constantly feel some level of regret while playing that I'm not spending that time with her. Being able to play a couple hours a week won't be worth a subscription imo. But goddamn do I want to play this.
---
DHKs are completely okay.
---
The only people who could possibly have a problem with them, are the high ranking PvPers, aka. a tiny majority of the playerbase. To everyone else, they are completely irrelevant. If you don't go for high rank, what do you care about DHKs?
---
And if you go for high ranks, then you don#t have time terrorizing Redridge anyway :P
---
I leveled to 60 on my paladin without knowing I could judge seals. I would turn on seal of command and alt-tab. Had to do that for hours in wintergrasp.
---
Back in the day, games weren't always dubbed in German. Like the older GTA's didn't get translation, Ultima Online was in English.
---
So by playing games I picked up a lot of English Words and Vocabulary.
---
Gaming is a really amazing tool for people to pick up a language, because you learn while you have fun as it should be.
---
Highly recommend it, IF you understand the basics of the language. I wouldn't go in totally blind, but people should try to get like the basics down, so you can say at least hello to people.
---
All of us who don't support bad game making decisions. The few who can't quit are why bfa is in this state, sunk cost fallacy.
---
PvP is only as hard as your enemies are, and good players had way more tools to use back in the earlier expansions.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Been there done that. My English went from mediocre school level to 3/4 of native speaker from start of vanilla to sunwell in tbc. Voice chat is also great help if you can use it and not being shy of speaking and making mistakes sometimes.
---
I have been anti retail my whole life, but I gotta say Bfa is the best state wow has been in since wrath. The azerite system fills my talent tree void and the fights are cool.
---
&gt;league of legends
---
Username checks out.
---
There are people that would say playing LoL would be the loser thing to do. In all seriousness though thats a rough thing to say and I can only think that she meant only losers play MMORPGs.
---
Bought BFA after refusing for several months, because some friends told me it was fun. It wasn‚Äôt and they stopped shortly after, bastards üòÉ was surprised to see it was 4 years ago since I played it last, which was also shortly.
---
Good, good... welcome to the Forsaken! and to the Horde!
---
Unsubbed since early MoP
---
No one's going to tell you what to roll. Weigh up the upsides and downsides of each class and figure out what you hate/love the most.
---
I made the same mistake at a dinner once: ‚ÄúMmm, this is actually pretty tasty‚Äù. The chef asked what the hell I meant by ‚Äúactually‚Äù.
---
This guys has a [Horde tattoo](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm9.staticflickr.com%2F8429%2F7743224824_40e7dd2f3a_z.jpg&amp;f=1) that he proudly displays when performing live. As a teenager deeply into death metal and wow you can't imagine how validated I felt when this came out.
---
If it‚Äôs true to vanilla, you could run it on you phone.
---
I've gone been since wrath as well. Add another to that statistic!
---
Problem with transparency: The playerbase nowadays is a bunch of entitled babies, that loses it's shit over ... well, everything. Announce something, ANYTHING, and sone asshole starts a shitstorm over it, or over something they imagine because of it.
---
The gamers themselves created this highly volatile environment, where every scrap of information is immediately weaponized by someone, and now the gamers complain that they don't get information.
---
You're in law enforcement. Imagine V-men getting fined for minor bullshit, immediately after giving valueable information. How long do you think they will continue to work with you?
---
Damn. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to just fuck your navy buddies.
---
But I‚Äôll create a character for you!
---
I'd say it is majority here. I'm unsubbed since wod. Gonna check out the classic for sure, I just hope they won't ruin it
---
Make it a rogue and farm the Pirate Outfit :D
---
Fuck an alt, takes way too much time initially. Just have them mob tag while you blow everything up. Easy.
---
I have to play alliance to play with my (stupid) friends. I want to play hunter. Is there a big difference between Nelf and Dwarf hunters?
---
We have to show Blizzard how many classic lovers are out there on classic launch day by subbing on day one. Their subscription numbers will rocket upwards.
---
I will use a shortened version of my original name. Old server mates will easily catch it's me and getting a manual group invite will be a smooth experience. For my alt I haven't decided yet.
---
I sorta did this when I played, as I had some rl friends who got me into the game who were willing to run me through dungeons so I could get basically any gear I wanted.
---
It was super fun, but I was just a noob with gear. The only thing keeping me from doing this at launch is knowing that pausing at any given level for too long means I‚Äôm more likely to get wrecked in WPvP by random 60‚Äôs lvling up professions or guarding an alt, or catching a guildie up to run dungeons, or beginning the dreaded phase 2 honor grind...
---
And this got you ... what exactly, other than a boatload of your time wasted?
---
I relate to the whole "relax and play" a *lot* - because with current retail, there's nothing relaxing about it. It's simultaneously boring and taxing - the game doesn't offer any challenge in the open world, but it runs its reward mechanics on a real life schedule (emissary/world quests, assaults), so you cannot play when *you* have time to kill, you play it like a second job: Clock in, do the progress allotment the game grants you for the current time period, log out, wait for real time to open more progression. I am *so* sick of this. I entered Azeroth to be an adventurer, only beholden to himself and his companions; Now I'm just a cog in a wheel - I pay to spin when it's my time, and as far as the game lets me be spun.

---
It‚Äôs a good game. One of the best in my humble opinion.
---
that didn't really show much real pvp tho
---
One of the joys of being a prot paladin, rogues don't get you so much.
---
I mean, you don't get them either, but it's nice to be ignored.
---
Doesn't matter, other than you I have a list full of friends, who will be happy to open a portal for me.
---
I'm sorry, i don't really understand. I'm the one you are quoting both times. Someone responded to me saying there will be RP servers and i said that i read a different post about there not being any at launch, so i was wondering what type of servers will be coming.
---
Apologies if i'm not being clear (or for being an idiot haha)
---
My warrior is still working on the first pack.
---
What season do you consider March? Spring right? Well, technically March should be considered a winter month as it was only a Spring month for 12/31 days (so it's winter for ~61% of March)
---
I'm 99% sure that the reason we classify seasons to start on certain days is based on astronomical events such as the winter solstice (which happens December 21 which just so happens to be the first day of winter for 2019) and the vernal equinoxes.
---
An equinox occurs when a day consists of 12hr of daylight and 12hr of nighttime. A solstice occurs when daytime or nighttime duration is at it's longest for the year--winter solstice having the longest night and summer solstice having the longest day.
---
Iirc there were some fedex quests but not sure if they were on vanilla on added in bc
---
Even in pvp?
---
Jokeface, I have no idea what you are smoking, but in a world where reputation decides who gets gear and who doesn't, no one is willingly going to associate himself with an asshole who deliberately wipes his groups.
---
If you actually do find "associates", all the better, makes it easier to ignore the lot of you, and filter out your applications quicker.
---
I did a lot of the typical stuff. I spent gold on gear/weapons that weren‚Äôt very beneficial to the class I was playing, killed incorrect mobs for quests and wondered why I wasn‚Äôt getting quest loot or kill credit, but the first and most memorable was not knowing how tf to talk to people. I came from Runescape at the time and all you needed to do was just start typing. So whenever I tried to say what‚Äôs up, my character would wiggle around a little bit until I said forget it and went back to killing incorrect mobs for quests.

to be honest if you're really into PvP, you would want auto attack on your bars. I made a macro where you can't disable auto attack by pressing the button again, also makes it target your nearest enemy, if you dont have a target already. I actually do this for all abilities. Not having auto attack binded makes you even more of a noob imo ;D (no hate)
---
I'm bringing my girl along.
---
&gt; By all account vanilla was an amazing game but it was in no way perfect.
---
Nothing will ever be perfect, but "in no way perfect" i  dont agree at all it is by far the closest a game has come to be perfect
---
Can you OT with the typical build of fury/arms build though? Or do you have to respec?
---
Also, I just want to be sure I understand: As a fury warrior i'm on second priority when warrior tier gear drops?  And what about 2h drops, if i'm fury against MTs and OTs, who gets the priority? What about Rogues, will they have the same priority as I do on 1h's?
---
Well I can‚Äôt speak as much to warrior and hunter, but I will say totems are a big part of shaman pvp. If totems sounds bad to you, that‚Äôs a problem, they should be an appeal...I played a shaman for pvp a lot in BC/wotlk and loved it, I think because I liked the totems and like healing.
---
I guess I can say that warrior is good for if you have a pocket healer, but if you care about solo world pvp is bad.
---
Also since you are saying you care about World Pvp phase 2, hunter is top tier world pvp class. Although I guess that‚Äôs for solo/catching opponents, if you are group pvp warrior and shaman (assuming you are healing) =very good
---
I think it was in cycle of hatred or in tides of war that quote you say is. 
---
It's not that magini didn't exist, they were often shunted (see your quote agai ) and from lore there are very few named woman mages. Exception being aegwyn and jaina.
---
Similarly, NE society didn't ban male priests or sentinels or women being druids, but it was seen as oddities, rare examples. Eg see elerethe renferal - she used to have centuries of experience as a druid or jarod shadowsong being warrior/one of founding members of sentinels after war of the ancients (maybe founding member is bit of a strech, but it was also his innovative to create defensive force and as a lot of males died in said war, they had to recruit women as primary filler for sentinels) .

I'd really love it if the tooltip included what patch the item was introduced, obviously its fairly niche information though.

[WhoPulled] : 13:01:02 Pull detected: "Assholemage" [Flamestrike]
---
Sound familiar?
---
At least on person will have that one installed.
---
Here is what you think will happen: "I am gonna have fun being an annoying asshole."
---
Here is what will actually happen:
---
You: "Mage LFG UBRS"
---
Everyone: "known griefer, ignore him."
---
You: /cry
---
It's still 3% hit less you have to get. That's pretty good, at minimal it means you save 200-300 gold on getting the good scope and you get the +7 damage one instead which is good.
---
Now this makes sense yea I could see that
---
I guess I'm just looking for further input, maybe some appeal to one of the classes I've overlooked.
---
Fresh hitting 60! I made many friends along the way. One was a Hunter class leader of the top raiding guild on my server. After being promised I could join when I hit 60 I was pumped! 
---
1st day in the guild they invited me to a Onixya kill. 
---
1st pull, the main tank goes down. Me and my elite raider head comes into play and I started spamming the raid chat.
---
REZ TANK! CHANGE TANK! STOP DPS! REZ THE F*****G TANK. 10X over.
---
Needless to say I wasn‚Äôt around for a second pull. Booted straight out of the group and the guild in one fatal evening.
---
I've hopped on a private server for the meantime waiting :x
---
I mashed right click on mobs to autoattack faster for a couple weeks. My first character was a doofy looking bald human paladin cause I was sort of overwhelmed by the character creation screen and didn't know I could customize my appearance. I threw my talent points in random trees so my character would be more "balanced" and thought it'd be fine either way, assuming that I'd get all of them at max level anyway
---
This is my conundrum. I want to go Horde, but I love Alliance cities!
---
You make very good points. I do like totems and healing, but I'm afraid to be stuck doing it. No idea how welcoming the classic crowd will be to less optimal specs.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Define "best".
---
The most overpowered buffs in the game and would almost never run out of mana? Paladins the best.
---
The largest toolkit among all healers, with an answer to almost every situation, from area damage to massive tank damage that needed healup in a microsecond? Priest is the best.
---
Holy shit I just changed someone mind on Reddit.
---
Living in the Northeast US, I won't be playing classic if it comes out in the summer. Our weather is not pleasant 9 months of the year, so I have to enjoy the 3 months of summer to the fullest extent. Will join in the fun in October
---
My girl is leaving in august for a semester abroad so classic better comes out in august
---
Okay, so if this question were aimed at women instead you‚Äôd be totally fine with me saying, ‚ÄúWoW won‚Äôt rape me, beat me, kill me or mansplain things condescendingly to me that I already know‚Äù since facts aren‚Äôt sexist apparently? :^)
---
This is a very broad question, there's simply too many mobs that you will come across to point out one specific. Generally bosses or Elites.
---
Any healer+tank combination works when kiting isn't an option.
---
I played Alliance exclusively in Vanilla, and I thought that I had explored the entire world. I did not play Horde until I started on pservers a few years ago, and I found out the Horde had a flight path &amp; small quest hub at Bloodvenom Falls.
---
I was an Undead Warlock in Vanilla.
---
So this time it's gonna be Human Warlock.
---
Background: I was brought back by my disciples (charakters I played from TBC onward up to and including BfA) sacrificing themselves for me.
---
In fact they are all parked around the altar of the Spider in Jint'Alor right now, waiting for the time to bring back their master ;-)
---
Faces was melted. Fact
---
Paladin
---
ppl in this sub have too high expectations and will be let down after a few months of playing classic
---
My first dungeon experience was on my rogue in SFK. I didn't understand party roles yet. First group we approached, I went stealth and started attacking before the tank did anything and died. The group laughed and rezzed me. They explained the roles and we moved on. Fast forward to arugal,  we down him, spellcaster dagger drops, I see blue dagger with stats I don't understand and I hit need. Group flipped out and blocked me. Good times.
---
They'd have it no worse than any other class
---
There has been loads of those kind of posts. 
---
Its much more interesting to learn where people where in their lives. 
---
I was age 15-19 for Vanilla and TBC. Made such a huge impact on my life. Good times.
---
Dude, look what time it is for them today
---
I was more thinking as a healer
---
Yeah, hopefully it‚Äôs out during the winter cos summer I‚Äôm at the beach Classic or no Classic. üòé
---
Not a big difference but Nelfs have a higher base agility than dwarfs which is what hunters use. Dwarfs have a bonus to their gun skill but from what I've heard bows are way better anyway. 
---
If you're going hardcore and trying to min/max than go Nelf otherwise it doesn't matter.
---
In Pvp I'm not sure, I would say it would be 30% running for your life 20% ccing 50% healing :D
---
I was around 12-13 years old when I started playing my warrior. I didn't have much understanding of the game, so I only ever completed quests when some yellow text would pop in the middle of my screen, because then I knew I was doing something right.  
---
Anyway I didn't know about class quests either so it wasn't untill I asked another warrior "what the angry head above his head was" that I learned about berserker stance, and he told me how to get it.  
---
I was around lvl 54 at the time and I was sooo happy when I got it because then I could finally use whirlwind, intercept and recklessness.
---
Would say it comes down to one main PvP point really,
---
Shadowmeld (and prowl your pet) to ambush or defend bases, should be able to kill someone with an aimed shot
---
Stoneform should allow you to kill rogues
---
The racial bonus for bows and guns doesn't really matter unless you're a min maxer, even then it doesn't matter 
---
I would check out animations to see which is your favourite, nelf female is really cool
---
I shared this story before, I'll share it again. 
---
With my first char ever, a Dwarf Paladin, I managed to join a decent raiding guild early on. The day I hit 60, they had only 19 people for their Zul'Gurub raid so they invited me to join the Hakkar fight, because 20 players in the raid is better than 19, right? Well, not quite. 
---
They briefly told me what I had to do and as soon as the fight started I fucked up something with his blood siphon ability and we wiped. On the second try I fucked up again. I started to feel ashamed because quite obviously I had no clue what I was doing and now everyone in the guild knew that. Salt levels were rising in our teamspeak channel and I felt so bad.
---
Shortly before the third try I was so afraid of fucking up again that I plugged out my LAN cable and faked a disconnect, never to return to my Dwarf Paladin again until Wrath of the Lich King. Instead I created an Undead Mage that I played as a class leader in ZG, MC, AQ and BWL later on without fucking up any major encounter abilities ever again.
---
I guess my poor, abandoned dwarf at least taught me how to properly prepare for a raid.
---
Did you completely forget Cataclysm happened or something?
---
Yes, I learnt English only due to WoW. This time I'm gonna roll on a German server and immerse myself in the language that way.
---
Gameboy
---
I not sure that's true and not just because you've pulled a statistic out of thin air but... If leaders are keen, and can infact lead then I don't see any reason why a guild won't last. 
---
If your talking about a guild being successful, again define success. In Classic maybe one guilds soul purpose is to Tank STV while another's is to raid 5 times a week.
---
I think that guilds formed now stand a good chance of sticking together in classic, just as much as those formed in game. The only flaw to this is the ability for those applying and joining guilds to actually hit 60. Which for many will be a tough road that not everyone will make the end of.
---
Ouch
---
sl can be played just fine with low gear, you main job is to spam tongues/fear/spelllock so you really just need stamina to survive. Destro however is tough, most if your viability comes from burst and non raid gear is very sparce on crit
---
Ratchet and clank is so underrated!
---
I use to sneak on my parents account at night and play our night elf hunter, stacking stamina was the best way to go because it gave you more health of course. Using a fishing pole for more dps because it was better then the starter weapons. Another memory I have is killing murlocs in west fall on the north shore and a gnome kept jumping in front of me saying to put pants on, but I had some leather pants from a quest line I think in the night elf starting zone that made them look like underwear.
---
Tell us.... tell us everything!!!
---
You won‚Äôt get kills in pvp as a heal spec however you are very nearly impossible to kill and can keep everyone around you alive long enough to kill the enemy.
---
That would be a wild livestream on chatturbate.
---
people are going to be just as disappointed in classic. Many people dont realize the amount of time and grind that is needed in classic.
---
Got any suggestions for classic private servers? Want to get a feel for the mechanics again before I go into it on launch
---
I once ninja-looted during a Wailing Caverns dungeon.  I didn't know anything back then!   I apologized and felt horrible for days afterwards when I realized what i'd done.  Scared me off dungeons, and when I did go back I didn't loot anything at all for a while.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to come when they said it would come
---
Buying everything off the ah. Not realizing I had talents till lol 21. Putting on Intel get because it was rare. Picking tailoring/enchanting as rogue.  
---
I was 14 at the time though.
---
Accommodating WoW and a full time job is far easier than accommodating WoW and a family. 
---
In 2005, I had a full time job and an infant child and I raided up to four times a week. 
---
I‚Äôm now retired with two teenage kids and I won‚Äôt be able to reliably raid even one night a week.
---
but what happens after naax bro
---
Oh man, deep rock galactic is so much fun
---
These are my current thoughts.
---
Though I can feel the pull of the alliance, purely for something different to what i'm used to.
---
Thanks bro I really appreciate it!
---
Professions are for making money right?, they are in real life, so....  
---
I stayed in loch modan trying to make money for skills for a long long time, ( well after cherry bombs were grey )  
---
mining, making cherry bombs, vendoring them, mining, making cherry bombs, vendoring them, mining.....  
---
Because thats how professions work right???  right?????
---
Too Human, Grim Nights and OSRS
---
I didn't note that there are 3 skill trees. So I holy specced my paladin until lvl \~45 wondering why I don't do dmg.
---
I thought of doing this too!
---
My character in his original form, before being reborn as an Undead Rogue.  Sort of like a prequel take on my first wow character.
---
The WoW movie retconned just about everything though.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Angwespy too
---
I can smell your body odour from across the internet.
---
I‚Äôm trying to decide between playing a druid or paladin. I‚Äôd like to be able to either tank or heal 5 man instances, and I‚Äôve heard it is possible to do that as either of the classes. When it comes to raiding I‚Äôd like to mostly heal, and maybe try off-tanking if I get geared enough, but even if I‚Äôm always stuck healing I‚Äôll still be happy. I seems where these two classes really differ is in PVP. If I choose pally I don‚Äôt mind being a pocket healer. As a druid I think it would be fun to be the flag carrier in WSG or flag defense in AB. So, I keep flip-flopping on what class I‚Äôm going to pick in classic. Is one of these better than the other at the tank/healer hybrid?
---
For talents at level 60 I‚Äôm thinking of something like this:
---
Druid: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxxscMzxVxf0xo
---
Pally: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVuoxZVhtIxzmo
---
An elf would have thought of something better.
---
This!
---
Back in the day, I hated the addition of DHKs. It killed mass world PVP stone dead. But if I want Classic WoW, I want it all. Good and bad.
---
Yes, on private servers. On live servers you can't force a crit by sitting since crits from sitting doesn't add reckoning stacks. It hasn't worked for a very long time, if ever. It's a private server bug that the private server community is gonna rage over "lol official is so broken" because they have played for so long on unofficial guesstimated servers that they have no idea that it's them being wrong, not Blizzard.
---
The sorceress unit from WC3?  The only non-hero mage unit for humans.  I don't see how Aegwynn was unusual when all your mages were women.  Unless they were elves and I'm forgetting that?
---
Oh man, DEing the free blue is hilarious!
---
Stuck between priest and priest, which priest I should priest?
---
Thanks!

Hello from Arizona
---
Start with a N and ends with a Dale. 
---
Don't listen to the people who worry about "burning out" prior to the classic launch. This will only get you more pumped for the real deal.
---
Completely grinded around 4 levels (2 in the 30s, 2 in the 40s) without questing. Literally just killed NPCs in STV and Searing Gorge lol. Was only around 13 or 14 years old at the time
---
Not at all. I work a 9-5 desk job. Come home, do what I need to, make dinner, and raid 2-3 nights a week 8-11 or 9-12. Wife is huge weeb so she understands my nerdy gaming desires and needs.
---
Just tried out World of Warships and it's surprisingly satisfying.  I'm sure once I get higher tier and start getting stomped by better people that will change but for now it's a a lot of fun.
---
I believe screech doesnt cost focus, but I could be wrong :)
---
unfortunately I dont like the feel of grime on my skin so my hygene is quite a bit above the NEET average xD
---
I will have my wife log in to the game, find me and ask me a question in game :)
---
They are still absolutely horrible for the price though
---
Zug zug.
---
:))))))
---
I cant quite decide whether I should play holy paladin or priest in classic and I tend towards playing a dwarf. I am more PvE focussed but I'd also like to play a bit of pvp every now and then. Is one of them more gear dependent for PvP or way better for battlegrounds? I know dwarfs are better in PvP, are humans way better for PvE?
---
&gt;Going on about how other people's opinions are irrelevant does not in any way shape or form discredit what I said.&gt; Going on about how other people's opinions are irrelevant does not in any way shape or form discredit what I said.
---
You seem to be in denial, because that is exactly what is does.
---
You are of the opinion that the thread isn't political, and the picture "wasn't so bad". Mods disagreed.
---
&gt;And clearly you care about my opinion otherwise you wouldn't be coming back to this thread day after day 
---
One common mistake people who value their own opinion overmuch make almost constantly, is to take any form of interaction as validation. The reason for my coming back is boredom on a holiday, and a morbid fascination with stubborness.
---
We are still 10 weeks from that July 16 release.  How far out would you expect a date?
---
It's a real nostalgia trip, I loved the PS2 games as kid.
---
If they knew the release date they would tell it. it only created more hype and would have time to reach more people. and would be better for them.
---
They don't know themselfs. though they said classic summer, it doesn't mean that back at blizzcon they knew the release date all along and were just toying with people. encyrpting it "classic summer". its just a general window.
---
And they couldnt know what kind of troubles and developement issues they gonna face, and how long it all gonna take. so i wouldn't bank on "classic summer" as an exact "true" guideline to that it has to come out in the first half of summer or something.
---
They aren't robots or prophets, its a constant dynamic work in progress with a ton of factors. 
---
By how it looks right, and their last post, now its mostlikely gonna be the last half of the summer.
---
HEY GUYS, DAE
---
I thought NPCs were actual people so when I was doing my wetlands run I was shit talking the orcs around there.
---
that's literally not the same lol
---
Ya did good ya did good
---
Subbed when I signed up on the beta list
---
All right, no probs.
---
The info we have is that there will be RP-PvE servers at launch, but not RP-PvP.
---
He goes by Manduin now since he is no longer a child.
---
i actually enjoy training, fuck me i guess
---
I understand, but they‚Äôve constantly reassured the summer release. It would be better to tell us now that they‚Äôve ran into multiple issues are pushing release.
---
Did you guys complete RFK??
---
Lol
---
Alliance. Taking it back to my old wow days as a NE Druid.
---
Everyone at blizz already knows that people love vanilla, it has a major flaw for them though. It cant be monetized besides the subscription fee.
---
A few things like old talent trees etc. could be implemented, but as soon as you take dungeon finder, store mounts, sharding etc. and try to mix it with a vanilla experience it wont work, so there is no way to take retail and steer it in the direction of vanilla, the point of no return is long gone.
---
Yeh I don‚Äôt have a problem with it, it‚Äôs been around since classic there was a guy named headhunter riled the AH with an iron grip
---
I'm making a lot of assumptions here so feel free to ignore my unsolicited advice but I wouldn't assume it'll be just like before.
---
Just like people, relationships evolve and change over time. I would take a moment to talk with your SO about how much time you're planning to put in. Worst case scenario is that things may be different and then at least the issue has been preempted before feelings get built up.
---
I am interested in classic wow, but still not 200% on playing.
---
That July 16 theory i don‚Äôt believe in at all, it was a ploy for Blizzard to start snowballing the hype over the months.
---
Think I have been unsubbed since 2013. But I am hyped af for classic, I havnt played pirates servers either so its gonna "almost" feel like a new game for me
---
I levelled my wand to maximum weapon skill cuz i thought for priests that was they main source of dmg.
---
Accurate/10
---
Your question was pretty wide so im not sure I gave you all the answers you wanted. If you have any further questions feel free to ask them :)
---
You just have to type "staysafe warrior list" to find it. Not spoon fed much heh ? :D

His list is basically useless since he recommends helm of endless rage which won't be available in phase 1.

It's better to use the patch:1.2 (the patch before dire maul) than phase:1 argument since the phase1 gives things that won't be available.
---
Eye of rend and crown of tyranny are 2 good candidates to replace helm of endless rage.
---
No it's not.
---
Yes and no. No where I didnt quest, but there are places I wont quest alone. I wont touch STV without a friend at my back.
---
You really only count the grind at rank 11. If you don‚Äôt get r11 just casually playing for fun you have no chance at all of making rank 14.
---
I would do everything involved with one quest chain before doing other ones unless it was obviously in the same area. 
---
In all fairness this was before addons like questie so......
---
Also didn‚Äôt take advantage of inn rested xp.
---
haha love it!
---
We only needed one of the bosses so yeah we did it :D
---
No there is no difference
---
Sorceresses are high elves in WC3
---
Yes for sure. There are a lot more people playing Mages than Warlocks, but Mages are just better in PvE overall. Food/water is what guarantees easily finding 5/10 player groups. In raids, it's the damage and reliability. Warlocks are important, but they don't really start to get going until tier 2, or even ZG, due to the lack of good +hit gear. There is never a point where the average Warlock will pull ahead of the average Mage in damage. You won't have issues finding groups as a Warlock, they are an underplayed class. However, they are also less required by raiding guilds as their damage is lower, and less desired by groups as food/water and polymorph are beloved. My experience is that Mage is an easier class to find groups and raids with. While it's one of the more played classes, with how desirable they are in groups and raids, there still isn't enough of them. If you want to play melee, fury warriors can also get into raids pretty easily, you tank groups to your preraid fury BiS, then respec. Unfortunately, it is hard to break into tanking in a good raiding guild. You might get some off tanking opportunities, but most guilds have a well established MT/OT.
---
good for you, I dont hate you for enjoying something? Just dont hate me for not enjoying it.
---
Warlock has the benefit of being more self sufficient w/ its pet. SS helps you avoid corpse runs. Less drinking between pulls. Less downtime in other words. More efficient use of limited game time :)
---
OTOH, if you really like group content, it is easier to get into groups as a healer or tank. Less waiting around helps too when you have limited time to do a dungeon. Can take a while in classic to get the group formed and finally at the dungeon.
---
So sitting behind a screen for hours on end is pure bliss for you...
---
Well that makes sense then.
---
Warlock sounds right for you. But every other class aswell. If you play casually, every faction, race, gender, class, spec, build is fine.
---
Just pick what you think is cool.
---
Priests are great. What they lack in kill speed they make up by barely having to drink between pulls. Also you'll rarely die due to PW:S, great kit for healing (Even as shadow specc while lvling) fear/shackle. 
---
Mind Soothe is probably one of the most underappreciated abilities in the game. If utilized correctly you can skip alot of mobs both out in the world and in instances.
---
I don't think you'd be getting sex either way.

Wotlk was ground zero for the modern wow formula, cata tried to rectify it but the damage was done
---
Wait, could you even get from Searing Gorge to Loch Modan without the key?
---
I kinda just wanted to know if one of them was completely unviable/if the market for them was going to be completely over saturated, or if one race was a clear winner for them, like dwarf priests. Thank you :)
---
My prediction is August, because they said summer 2019 and I always expected the worst xD (soon tm)
---
I'm between Lock and Rogue. PvP server. I will enjoy lock A LOT more while leveling and in dungeons and raids (which I will be doing), but I know itll be rough going out in the world, as to where a rogue let's me play safe and on my terms 9/10 times and gives me more solo fun opportunities.
---
great post
---
It's almost certainly getting delayed. Or peiples expectations are unrealistic.
---
Late summer at the earliest but likely fall is my guess
---
Yes..maybe. Historically and even on most private servers it seemed warlocks were underpopulated. Which is surprising considering the amount of hype they get from the various what will you play polls. From spending time on the internet you'd think half of every server will be warlocks, but in reality at 60 they seem to be slightly underrepresented. I suspect because many people find the slower dotty style boring, but maybe things will change for classic.
---
There's a wide variety of crafted gear and your blue pvp set is good so you have nice casual gearing options that you can grind out over time. Then once ZG comes out you have your raid set handed to you thanks to Bloodvine.
---
For 5 mans it's difficult since you're basically competing with mages for a spot as well, and there's a ton of mages. But then again, no dps class is really "in demand" for 5mans, it's all about the healer and tanks supply. I know you don't want to play hunter, but I think hunter might be the only in-demand 5man dpser since they're often going after loot others don't want.
---
Locks are great for casual pvp since you're strongest 1v1 and in more chaotic fights.
---
Locks are great casual raiders since you're not expected to be top dps, but are still a solid dps and will be wanted for banish duty. You can also contribute to the raid simply by being prepared enough to stack soul shards so you can summon and health stone on demand. But again, this will depend on how many people take their locks all the way to endgame.
---
LOL.... This is the whole point. Finally a game that isn't instant gratification, free loot and EZ Mode. Classic is all about spending extended periods of time working on progression. It's not something to just speed through to Max level.
---
Totally agree. When I've been gearing a Warlock or a Hunter, I just wanted to be playing my Mage. Great class, can't go wrong. Mana gems sharing a CD with Dark Runes saves you a lot of gold, never need to buy water, portal all over the place, great PvP, great PvE. Everyone loves you. Man I am hyped to level a Mage in classic!
---
I think there are only two classes that care about killing blows, and that would be priest for the spirit regen, and rouges with 2/2 of remorseless attacks for the crit bonus.
---
Even then I don't think rogues even need the killing blow, just to be in a group that gets a kill.  Correct me if I'm wrong, its been a long time since I had a rogue in vanilla with that talent.
---
I dont want the beginning of July anymore. I'm moving in the beginning of July and I want everything set up and comfortable before I lose myself.
---
The reason I reacted like that is because it looked like you were changing the question in order to make my answer look incorrect. Maybe that wasn't your intention.
---
To be clear: At launch there will be RP-PvE, but RP-PvP is very unlikely.
---
Why not both?
---
Take a week off for launch, and if the servers shit the bed, head to the beach! Or do a workout, or get a tan.  
---
Plenty summer to have while the servers are on fire!
---
I think my ex wife threw them out TBH!
---
I got my dwarf warrior to 35 or so, had help getting the whirlwind weapon quest from a higher level warrior. Our computer died or something so I stopped playing a while. I let my cousin play it, and he ended up selling all my equipped gear for gold including the whirlwind axe.
---
Depends how good of a player they are, but the illumination talent is what makes holy platepriests insane
---
Did the thousand others have angry tikis in the background?!  I didn't think so.
---
Just based on your written English here alone, I'd say you understand it more than enough to be able to normally play on a primarily English-speaking realm.
---
That said, you're in the EU and generally there's no guarantee a specific realm will have a lot of people who can understand and write in English.
---
I also learned English as a 2nd language from movies, music and games, however, for some reason, there's a tendency that even fewer young folks pick it up and develop it. So more than likely us people in the EU will still have a lot of language barriers to put up with on our realms.
---
This is why I've always wanted to play on US realms so that I know that everyone would understand me perfectly when I'm calling out their mom etc.
---
I'm probably sounding like an English elitist but frankly I am. Languages are too outdated and a mere barrier between normal human communication. It's absolutely disgusting to see /General and /Trade chat spammed by a foreign language. It's actually against the rules but people still do it (I'm looking at you, Finnreaver and Defias Polishood).
---
Anyway, enough ranting from me. If you've got real life friends who'll be playing just go play on their realm. There's only so much you can learn about a language from simply reading/writing it. The harder part is mastering it verbally.
---
Dude, where was your mount?
---
Mid/Late August is my guess since 8.2 raid will probably release mid/late July
---
I'd strongly recommend druid. Check out Skarm on Youtube, he plays at high level with a similar build to what you are describing. Both tanking and healing in AQ/Naxx with the same specc. 
---
His videos in general are probably the best out there for Classic. Unlike most 10:01 Youtubers trying to ride the hype train.

You guys DO know that, technically speaking, summer lasts until September 23rd this year, right?
---
If you dont believe the hype then what was your post abiut exactly?
---
This podcast is SUPER well put together, very higb quality, and his entire body of work is a GREAT listen, I can't reccomend it enough. 
---
Also, if just the content that is put out every week wasn't enough to sate your Classic thirst, check out the Discord! There's a great Classic WoW community over there that has formed from listening to the podcast, come check it out!

When I was around a low level Night Elf warrior I came to Stormwind and picked up the delivery for Stormpike quest from the Dwarven District. The quest was red. To me it meant hard. And lots of xp.   
---
I didn't know about the tram. Somehow I totally missed it. So I looked on the map where was the place called "Loch Modan", looked what territories I likely would need to go through.  
---
I walked through Elwynn, Redridge ... and at the top of redridge I saw the gate to Burning steppes and had a bad feeling. I crossed. Got aggroed right away by some black dragon. I died.  
---
I resed, kept going towards BRM, died, revived, until I arrived with a completely destroyed gear in BRM.   
---
I crossed into Searing Gorge.  
---
Made my way to the tunnel to Loch Modan, dying a lot in the process. And then as I finally arrived ... the gate was locked and I didn't have the key.  
---
I talked to the guy guarding it on the other side. He said "Hey, you don't wanna go there it's dangerous.".  
---
I was like "I am already there, open the fucking gate !".  
---
I capitulated and Hearthed back to Stormwind.  
---
Then I asked how to get to Loch Modan after telling my story. People laughed and a few said they had done the same mistake at first.  
---
Another one told me that I could still have made it had I known about the passage to Badlands and then to Loch modan farther East in Searing Gorge ... but I had died enough for one day XD
---
It would definitely be after launch haha
---
Asdf
---
I leveled up as a Prot Warrior because Warrior's should have shields... Solo... I never tried any other specs until the dual spec came along, where I quickly discovered I loved Arms (was it MS-Crit? Foggy memory) and funnelled all my gear upgrades towards that.  I didn't even tank in the end.
---
People still not reading it that way lol, sorry bro
---
How do you know this episode is so super great when its been out for less than 10 minutes? xD
---
Speakers?  Amateur.  Use nice headphones, then no one knows anyone is home.
---
He must have gone through Badlands and then to Loch Modan.
---
Priests are not squishy at all. As long as you keep inner fire up, and have specced into improved inner fire.
---
With and against lol
---
I dont think I ever took auto attack off my bar as a warr
---
F.lux is a great program for your eyes

I had M Uldir at 2 days

I was stating that we don‚Äôt have a release date as of May? And that my hype for the game is building up even more?
---
Bingo
---
If the wife's hot Ill do the body swap for you right as I hit 60 to let you no life it
---
I subscribed to vanilla, and played through Kara and Gruul‚Äôs in TBC. Got the first flying mount on my server...led my guild through the aforementioned raids, at age 17. I remember vividly saying ‚Äúimagine if you put this much time into a skill like guitar or drums.‚Äù 
---
Haven‚Äôt subbed since‚Äîand to his comment I used the confidence I got from leading to be a captain on my rugby team and eventually become a tech sales manager. 
---
Long story short...I adore the communication and social skills that WoW gifted to me at an early age. All of the QoL improvements that came in later expansions have diminished any sort of social engineering by the player so I haven‚Äôt had much interest in it. Can‚Äôt wait to resub and hop on discord and work together towards long-term team goals (40 man raids).
---
They both have things that are exclusive to them. Mentioning one of them doesn't provide much in the way of deciding which one is the best overall.
---
I'm a rogue who picked enchanting and engineering. 13 years later and neither of them are maxed out yet. :)

Ran through the entirety of the Deep Run Tram, not knowing what it was or where it went. Hid from the tram itself several times, thinking it would kill me if I didn't. THEN, I ran back after getting to Ironforge because I didn't know I could use the flight path.
---
Just spec 0/30/21 and do both.
---
Whenever I'm taking a break from the grind I'll turn on vending machine mode as I'll be rolling a mage so free food/drink for adventurers!

Gotta work on your jokes
---
Horde for easy BG wins
---
Then that's great for you since you'll be able to somehow experience again vanilla through classic, although it won't exactly be the same. (=&gt; Nothing new to discover)
---
My point in the first post was that some people take vanilla for a perfect game to the extend of presenting what are for me issues as perfect game design.
---
Iirc it was after classic anouncement on a thread about giving BC crusader strike to the retribution tree, and someone replied that vanilla was already perfectly balanced and that there was no need for any changes.
---
That reply is for me the perfect exemple of rose tinted glasses and misinformation about vanilla.
---
Imo this kind of post is responsible for some of the rose tinted glasses argument : people portraiting vanilla for something it wasn't.
---
As you said nothing will ever be perfect, but we shouldn't ignore issues just because we like the game.
---
Im sure this one happened to all of us at the start. Had the exact same thing. Even stocked up on potions and buffs. Died like 10 times. Next day, now ill get him! I brought a friend!! Huh? wheres that mob? Friend: what did he look like and how did he attack you? Me: answers Friend: -\_- morron xD

If your goal is to raid and you enjoy it on a lock, play lock. That will be the majority of your time in-game (one would hope) so it makes more sense to roll that way. The best lock farms are in dungeons anyway; DM/Mara
---
&gt;Do You Remember?
---
&gt;The 21st night of September?
---
&gt;Classic was changing the minds of Retailers.
---
&gt;While chasing the other clouds away.
---
&gt;Our hearts were ringing,
---
&gt;In the key to UBRS the rogue was bringing 
---
&gt;As we wiped in the night
---
&gt;Remember how the hunter stole the loot away!
---
If you are just playing casual, you can bear tank any 5 man instance and even UBRS.  Also, if you are casual, being a tank means you wont have an issue when you are online and looking to instance, its easy to get groups as a tank or healer.  
---
Also, if you level feral, you can DPS as you quest and pop bear if/when you are asked or you fancy an instance.
---
I was a dumbass dwarf hunter, didn't want to spend money on ammo, so I specced survival and almost exclusively meleed. Got dual-wield swords because I thought it looked badass.
---
Somehow bumbled my way down to Westfall and got into a Deadmines run. I had no concept of aggro, or how to turn off pet abilities, so my pet kept growling, pulling aggro, and pulling extra mobs.
---

the real question is, will character names already used in non-Classic WoW be unable for use in Classic? I'm betting yes.

Yah filthy casual
---
top fucking kek
---
people like that are why we have warning labels on microwaves telling you not to nuke your pet.
---
What you mostly missed out on was the feeling of overpowerment, mythic+, and good raids (not counting EN.) For all the good things Legion added, something equally bad existed but it was still worth experiencing.
---
And I don't know what other guy is talking about for questing. Legion questing was dogshit. It was notoriously bad for the story and pacing outside of Suramar (and even then not many people could stomach doing it on alts outside of required quests.) Not even the post-release quests could reach mediocre status. Only good quests we had were the hidden secrets.
---
everyone should sub until classic is released, BFA hype is gone after second raid, what a load of shit really.
---
Hijacking this comment to further extrapolate (I'm an armchair developer):
---
At this point there is simply *nothing* Blizzard can do/change for Retail WoW to make it more in-line with what WoW once was and what the *majority* of fans loved. Things like old talent trees, tedious long quest chains, less quality of life improvements and more actually rewarding but hard-to-achieve items and goals... All those are things that have been changed by Blizzard in order to 'streamline' the game and make it more accessible.
---
Of course, that is all a dust cloud to hide the real intent which is greatly increasing revenue by attracting more potential players  (I.e players who would normally not play nor enjoy a game such as Vanilla). Things like paid services, pets, store mounts and all that bamboozling is extremely effective at attracting people to sink time into the game and also give Blizzard even more money.
---
If Blizzard were to make a Vanilla WoW 2.0 (not Classic but rather another WoW or expansion very similar to that), it would mean they are accepting the fact that their 'inferior old game' is actually much, much better than the trash that is currently Retail. They will never do this; they cannot afford to have  such a defeat (even though it would be an honorable one).
---
So, what you're left with is Blizzard slyly and shamefully throwing us, the real fans (real meaning not necessarily hardcore balls to the wall, but real as in people who understood what WoW once stood for and how great it was in terms of the gaming community), one last bone for us to chew and enjoy, while again giving them a bit more money and attention.
---
After this you can absolutely forget about anything decent that could(would) come out from them in terms of the WoW franchise. You'd be delusional if you do.

I just want a Tauren Warrior named Sherman.
---
Dont ask but i always keep my sub going. As i like to do anything when it comes out even if it is WoD bad. I still keep sub. I think i need help tbh i have addiction and no one can take me off of it.
---
Subbed, I wouldnt be able to come back to classic, current wow got so mamy improvements like balanced classes, all specs viable, harder raids, basic stuff like being able to summon in instances, enchant scrolls, aoe loot, achievements, catch up mechanics for ppl who are coming back, group finder, world quests, story line quests, class hall quests, transmogs, etc shyt loads of stuff to do...
---
Im waiting for classic just to see whos gonna play it xd and how many ppl. Current WoW need some improvements but its much better for me than classic was :p (started playing in 1.9)
---
Ppl saying that classic is better that unsubbed in tbc/wotlk and didnt even try current game amaze me :p
---
redridge mountains has a path to BS
---
Initially probably alliance.  I never played through alliance from the start and only within the last expansion did I play them in live.  
---
I could still see myself ending up as an Undead Warlock or Tauren Shaman again but I think I'll start off as alliance.
---
Point is they made it work. If it s 1.12 that is p boring
---
I am pretty set on a paladin. Last year I leveled a priest and a paladin pretty far on a pserver. The priest was so fun and the paladin was as bad as everyone says. That said, the paladin's play style, especially in PvP, fits me better. So I'm gonna suck it up and push to 60.
---
I am less sure about my alt. I definitely want an alt to play with friends who level slower. I'm pretty sure I want a night elf hunter. It was my original and only character in Vanilla. I swapped characters when the took away mana and only mained it again in Uldir. I want to experience the wonderful high skill cap hunter class again. But a small part of me says to play mage, druid, rogue, or warrior. I guess it'll depend a lot on what my wife wants to play.
---
Almost 30 and married as well.  I still love all those things.
---
No thats Paladin. Priest is getting butt fucked by rogues and warriors, you need your team to pay attention to you. Pallys can brush aside a lot of incoming damage
---
I assumed vendor gear was the best gear in the game. And kitted myself in a full set of whites.
---
I think skarm did a video about this for tanks recently
---
I was like 6-7 when I played classic, I have some pretty good ones..
---
1. I've always mained a warrior, I was aware that drinking didn't have any immediate effect, but I still bought water and drank it after eating, so my warrior didn't become dehydrated and would get a 'headache' debuff or something.
---
2. On like my 2nd time playing I didn't know the difference between the action bar and my bag, so I tried to get rid of a pair of gloves by pulling them to the action bar. I saw that they remained in my bag, but I came to the logical conclusion that I just had to do it enough times so that they eventually would disappear from my backpack. 
---
3. I wanted to have enough gold for a mount when I hit lvl 40, I was only allowed to play for an hour every day, so I spent a couple of weeks killing only ghouls in the catacombs in Duskwood at lvl 39. I was somehow sure that this was the best method of gold making without getting xp.
---
Wait you mean it‚Äôs not a one time %increase?! /s
---
I tried to get into a WC but I had all white and grey items. The guy told me to go do quests and get some green items first then try to do a dungeon. I was a hunter. It shouldn‚Äôt have mattered lol
---
Good point! However in my defense, if you look at what I say I point to the larger podcast as a whole and when I said the podcast is great I meant I know the channel is great. Considering the countless hours of quality content Josh puts out I'm fairly confident in recommending this latest episode too, even though I'm saving it for my ride home from work later today =P
---
Rend is a shit ability?
---
Cousins convince me to play WoW, as we played Diablo 2 religiously.
---
Rolled a druid because Diablo 2 feral druids were so goddamn badass with werewolf and freaking wearbear.
---
Bear form was super lame in comparison.
---
Specc'd balance because also windy druid in Diablo 2.
---
Hurricane as 31st point talent was garbage... spent the entire time leveling to 60 before the tree rework for druids in bear form despite being specced balance.
---
Yeah, it was a fucking rough time...
---
Warlocks want it as well for mana regen.
---
I helped out in one of these are a level 36 hunter. Wasn‚Äôt much. But was fun as hell. Until everyone disbanded leaving me alone at the crossroads with no flight paths discovered and hearth on cd.
---
Neat.
---
My typical routine is look at the new expansion, think maybe they can right the ship, buy the expansion and get disappointed, quit after a month and unsub.
---
Although I stopped actually  having hope in the first place after wod.
---
Oh, do they also have a killing blow talent? I know they have shadowburn as a nice finisher, but what else?
---
Night elf mohawk
---
Good news as a chronic pfUI user. It would be really hard for me to go back to the default UI even if it was just for a few days.

I'm Brazilian and I was thinking about joining an US guild just to practice my English a little bit, but unfortunately the time zone differences when scheduling raids might be a problem. I think I'll probably make an alt in an US server when I'm done with the content of the first phase just to see how it goes.
---
Name them after your favourite politician so when you die it‚Äôs less painful
---
My first character was a dwarf hunter.  I made it to 22 maybe.  I had a gray or white gun still but dammit I had a sick 2h blue sword with spirit and shit.  Iirc it was Deanship Claymore or whatever.  Had no clue why leveling was so hard!
---
Bro this guy has hot whamen and 420 blaze!!!1 LEDDITORS ITS TIME TO UPVOTE1
---
Horde, the game itself is just so much more fun as such.
---
And imo its more fun to be attacking stormwind that sitting afk in it.
---
The video won‚Äôt play...
---
Thank you for support!
---
I couldn't wait if with much to play right now, I just gave in to a pserver for practice. The leveling is so grindy but I wouldn't change a thing. I'm sure it's not 100% perfect classic but plenty of it is just how I remembered so it's enough, for now, til summer.
---
Dwarf Priest gets fear ward, and is likely to make you more desirable as a recruit. I think most people would argue a healing pally is better for PvP since they can tank some damage while healing flag carriers, etc. At the end of the day any healer is going to be welcome in a BG. Human's greatest racial is their bonus to reputation gains, so take that fwiw. I'd take dwarf either way myself.
---
As arms I was spec's into something like axes, polearms, and swords. My secondary guild MT set me straight to spec into whatever you had at the time if it wouldn't immediately be upgraded anytime soon.
---
Except in AV...
---
...which if you don't care about wins you can camp a choke point and get free HK's!
---
I was probably around level 35 at the time. I disnt know really anything about guilds. A guy whispered me asking if i wanted to join one. I said sure but apparently i was already in one. He told me to type /gquit. The guild i was in was called horde forces or something dumb. I thought i quit the horde for a good moment... Lol
---
Yes AV is PVE 90%
---
I kept auto attack in the one slot beyond Vanilla, I'm quite sure.
---
THEN THE WINGED WYVERN RIDERS ARRIVED!
---
Haha I guess I‚Äôm thinking about the subbing/unsubbing I did across like 10 years
---
The bigger news for me is the Arctic Wolf, which is a pre-1.4 epic mount.
---
It could indicate that we are getting old school mounts at launch.
---
*fingers crossed*
---
Back in the day I bet like 90% of people didn‚Äôt know there was a debuff limit.
---
&gt;"What warrior spec are you?"
---
&gt;"Slav Tank"
---
&gt;"What"?
---
depends on where they summoned you. If said warlock demanded they come to SW/IF you would have to. And there's still no where near enough exploration xp between SW and Northshire to level you up.

---
Desolace is possibly the worst zone in vanilla imo
---
you should decide that for yourself, I'm sure if you devise a plan you can stick to it, nothing worse than playing and month down the line you're pissed because you listened to someone else on what class to play.  
---
Do class reviews, decide which professions suite you best, it is your play style, you need to invest into some time   
---
on deciding which route you wanna take.  
---
The game is best enjoyed at your own pace. Most of all stay away from toxic players/guild, nothing worse than controlling demanding people.
---
Leveled as balance till 50 cuz I didn't know there were tabs for other talent trees.
---
Jesus the whirlwind quest was so tough. It's not soloable, if I remember. I had to get a few other warriors to help.
---
Thank god I'm horde and don't have to worry about it.
---
I have heard they were going to release a similar Horde quest chain with a raptor mount in ungoro but ended up not implementing it till after vanilla. Even if I had that option, I'd probably skip it, it's just such a time sink that I could spend grinding profs/gold/leveling alts.
---
I just think that is really stupid because allys got paladins that dispell all the shit you got. Sure Wotf sucks in wPvP because there is alot of Undeads and you will go 1v1 often but if that is all that matters to some people I don't know what... Gnome Lock for PvE imo and with a Human lock rogues can barely open on you anymore.
---
This is pretty awesome, though I prefer some of the older-looking addons. I kinda liked how unrefined things were back then. Might just be me though.
---
My Russian friend always would join English speaking guilds to help him improve. It really is a great resource as you get conversational English and slang etc not just grammar and proper usage.
---
I played a hunter for all of Vanilla. It is a really easy class to play, but has a very high skill ceiling. You have a lot of utility and are self sufficient. It can be very strong in PvP, both open and BG once you know what you're doing. It starts falling short DPS wise in raids, but the class still has a place in a raid. At least based on what I've read. I only cleared MC as I was somewhat of a late comer to Vanilla. I had no issue getting into that raid at least.
---
All three classes obviously have their strengths, so it really depends on what you are looking for.
---
I'am unsubbed. for the past years i have only played for 1-2 months in the beginning och each expansions. and then i unsubscribe.  I rarely return.. and if i do its just for a short time..  #FUCKAZERITE
---
Yes, absolutely.  My little gnome will look so fly.
---
Is the math like 2h per day for 2 months?
---
[deleted]
---
Depends on competition and also what sells for what prices. Herbs are more expensive the more high end raiding that's going on. Private servers can't really be used for comparison due to very high pop cap and much higher percentage of people raiding than on official servers back in vanilla. It also depens on class/specc, gear level etc since the faster you kill the better gold/h. You have to test it out yourself to see what works best.
---
Lovestosploog
---
Well it is mostly for levelling I guess, but they have a talent for mana regen when they kill stuff with Soul Drain.
---
When I first started I used to try clicking auto attack as fast as possible, thought that was how got had to attack. Didn't realize all of was doing was toggling attack on and off lol.
---
As awesome as it would be, there's just so much to work towards and grind for...I can't see being able to accomplish everything else I want to and get this mount, lol.
---
Dude i relate. Downtime atm, study vacation for exam. Then true downtime until july 8th. Bad timing most like.
---
Leveling a warlock is extremely casual, raiding not so much.
---
They are extremely gear dependent, meaning they aren't even popular DPS options until after AQ. But, after that point, they're one the the main DPS classes alongside rogue, mage, and warrior. If you're just planning on pugging some raids when there's availability though, you're going to be in about the same spot as every other DPS option though.
---
Which is the start of the last week in fiscal quarter 3.
---
What does that mean?!
---
I don't know.
---
Ehm more like 2 years. Humans do it 10% faster, but look kinda lame on it. Gnome master race tho
---
I heard that as well. I think they did implement the raptor at one point, but after revamping the Wintersaber grind to be easy, so they made the raptor grind easy as well. It's too bad that Horde didn't have a counterpart to this mount really.
---
But this in fact will be the 2nd classic launch, also most likely the last though.
---
You'll have trouble pvping as destro without epics, since they rely on blowing shit up quick to stay alive. SL will make you pretty godly even if it's with just r10 gear and prebis.
---
It's in BETA?? Who got invited?
---
Fear
---
Shield
---
Heal
---
Priest is the ultimate stall tactic healer until your team can assist.
---
Employee Alpha.
---
Whoa a BUSINESS wants to make MONEY????
---
Have you alerted the media?
---
I leveled a priest on a pserver last year. Highly enjoyable play style. They aren't super fast like a hunter or druid, but they are smooth. Speaking of which, you might also consider a druid. They have their own set of issues at 60 (no regular res mostly), but they are very strong levelers and have a lot of other strengths. Obviously up to you to really research and decide what is right for you.
---
I'm a Mythic raider, so I don't really ever get to unsub. But I am experiencing the best content the game has to offer so it keeps me very interested. If I wasn't doing this I would have unsubbed a long time ago.
---
I've decided that I'm gonna max out a (fury) warrior and a mage. The only thing I'm unsure of is which one I should get to 60 first. Either I level my warrior first and get it geared, and level my mage during phase 2 with DM out. Or I level my mage first and feed gear to my warrior to make the leveling smoother. Thoughts?
---
Pally pitching in offensively??
---
Honestly, Rift was a really great game. The amount of builds you can try was truly amazing. I'm a bit sad it fell apart. I wasn't invested in its story like I was with WoW (WC I-III and FT) so it disconnected me from it a tad. Either way, I played a Cleric, and it was so infinitely superior to how Paladins played in WoW at the time.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre in a hardcore guild that‚Äôs looking for a high world ranking, which is not what my comment is talking about.
---
Yeah there's a level 40 elite at the end that requires help. You can do this "solo" by waiting at the quest NPC for other groups coming to do their quest. You can ask them to help you with your kill after they finish yours, and most people should offer to help you if they're not assholes.
---
The bloodtusks in STV can be soloed at 30 if you're careful but you'll probably die a bunch both to the mobs and to other players.
---
The elementals in Arathi are harder. It is theoretically possible to kill them at this level but you need to be very careful, bring potions, and still be prepared to die all the time. The fire elementals are especially annoying because there's always people there farming mats from them. You can buy the charms for the quest from other players, but people tend to try to gouge the shit out of you for them (like 1g+ each and you need 24 total).
---
Cata tried to rectify? Cata took everything good that was left in wotlk and threw it away. Then they added more crap. Wotlk was the peak of wow (both in gameplay and number of subscribers). It had its faults, sure, but I think of wotlk as a plateau whereas cata went over the edge into a free fall.
---
With an ideal set up and counting for no ganking or competition, it's closer to 4 hours a day for two months. The reality is that there will be a lot of competition (and PvP if you play on a PvP realm), so I expect it to take longer than that.
---
12h per day and if you‚Äôre lucky maybe 50 days
---
I think you want the druid. They're so good in BG as healers and flag carriers it's qf a requirement to have at least one in WSG especially. Impossible to chase down, remove snares on form change, tanky af in bear and uber bg heals with their HoT's (instant cast, snare, form change and open up a gap)
---
12h and if you‚Äôre lucky maybe 50 days
---
Good point. You can't really grind this mount and do other parts of the game at the same time, unless you don't have real life commitments.
---
Fair enough, just thought it'd be funny to point out xD
---
Thanks man. Now i can see how stupid younger me was.
---
I was on teamspeak with a friend of mine, he was a 60 alliance and I just started out as a horde. We decided to meet up for the lolz in ashenvale. Knowing full well he would kill me, i decided to play a game of cat and mouse and hid from him while he tried to find me.
---
After about 2 hours of fucking around like this I decided I would just let him have his fun and kill so we met on the road.
---
Turns out the guy was on a completely different realm, I was 12 and no notion there were different realms for some reason. An afternoon well spend!!
---
I did all the Blacksmithing Quests like turning in 280 Mithril Bars to get some crappy Recipes.
---
When I lean back in my chair with a slight right tilt I immediately picture myself as this dude.
---
I tell people my first character was a gnome mage but it‚Äôs a sham.
---
My first character was a night elf hunter named Sneakyelf.
---
I was in Darkshore and had just returned from some questing when I saw another night elf stealthed outside the town. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI can do that too, I should join him because he‚Äôs being sneaky.‚Äù So I stood across the road from him and shadowmelded. /wave /hello and whatnot.
---
Then he walked over to me but still in stealth! So I tried but my stealth would break every time. I asked him, how do you move in stealth? And he said only rogues can do it. I was pretty jealous and dread started to come into my child brain that my name isn‚Äôt really as appropriate as it would have been if I chose a rogue. I continued leveling up to 20 but I had lost motivation because of my name/class combo.
---
So I rerolled a gnome mage because I didn‚Äôt want to do the night elf quests that I‚Äôd already completed.
---
When I think back on it, I probably was trying to make a stealth archer like I played in Morrowind.
---
You mean Broken blade.
---
Was also my first server. Half tempted to go back to it if it's available in classic.
---
I am still subbed and play nightly... Granted BFA isn't that great, but I have spent hours doing PVP/Arenas for the PVP Gear. I have been finding ways to entertain myself because I love WoW.
---
Dwarf or bust
---
Classic will be great but don‚Äôt expect it to be ‚Äúharder‚Äù just slightly more tedious and time consuming
---
You dont need to get the kb
---
Zug Zug
---
Do you have the 110-120 heirlooms yet? I ran a warrior with the new heirlooms and got from 110-120 in just over 4 hours...
---
The mount's in the game files but that's no indication that it will be available in-game. Azshara Crater is in the files too.
---
Mage first to feed gear to the warrior
---
I stopped playing at the end of Warlords of Draenor, skipped Legion altogether, got the itch again and came back mid way into Battle for Azeroth.  And honestly I don't see the hate.  It looks great and the quests are fun,
---
They were even the most popular botting class back then too because you didn't rely on gear to cast spells.
---
It indicates nothing, it's just a sandbox server.
---
I havent been subbed for years... BUT I just randomly last week bought a retail sub and bfa because im desperate for something to play. Just having fun with it and not taking it serious, but it's kinda nice filler for now until classic wow comes.
---
It was a really good game, professions, dungeons, raids, invasions and other events, I loved all of it.  
---
    
---
Just a shame it ran like shit and the animations left a LOT to be desired. In WoW (old wow anyway), the sounds, attack animations and impact animations all gave combat a real 'oomph', which is something RIFT lacked fiercely. That paired with the fact that wow could run on a toaster (and the mmo community had grown accustomed to that) while RIFT struggled on every system was a damn shame.
---
I plan to but it will probably take me years to get since I'll only have 2-3 hours a day to play due to work with the exception of weekends of course.
---
It's so God damned good.
---
The client is available on Blizzard's release network. It's not available to the public through the launcher, but some people have found a way to download it from the server. You can't actually log in to the actual beta server without an invite (currently developers/friends and family alpha test), but some people are emulating a server without any actual content to launch the client.
---
I've repeated this several times on here, but my opinion is that retail WoW has such far superior graphics, in almost every single way. Yes, the character models aren't the same, personality/etc was lost in some customization options, and some of the animations are truly bad (all NElf males are horrendous, Dwarf running for example is bad too). 
---
That said, the textures on everything are so fucking great, it's a jarring switch. Also, a lot of the spells look a lot better in retail and dare I say, match their lore a bit better. For example, shamans healing spells use _water_ which is lore wise how they heal with the elements. Fire mages have better looking spells, paladin holy spells look great, etc. I know beggars can't be choosers and I can't exactly sit here and pick what HD graphics to port over, but I wish I could...I know I miss Vanilla for the game play, community, sense of accomplishment, story, those things. The graphics? I think updated would be an improvement.
---
I never considered the positive human impact of gold farming before. That does complicate the issue, doesn't it.
---
That's the most tidy classic UI I think I've ever seen.
---
100% Shaman. That fits the bill perfectly. I‚Äôd argue they have the highest skill cap with using your totems optimally to help buff team or protect team or hinder enemy. They can heal. They can do some damage as well.
---
Came for Justin Timberlake meme.
---
Left disappointed.
---
Very insightful thank you!
---
I had to delete my first two hunters, as both of them suddenly bugged, and couldn't shoot anymore.
---
Only when my third hunter bugged, and I whined to my friend about it, did I learn about this thing called ammunition.
---
Look at what they did to my boy
---
Let them starve.
---
Legion is only good because it is sandwiched between the worst wow has ever offered. Legion only beats WoD and BfA. Class design was still horrible.
---
I'm not paying $15 a month to fund a humanitarian mission.  That's what charities are for.
---
What you really should do, is research what type of pet you want to use at level 60 and where to get the color of that pet you want and the graphic model you like and what level it is...then when you're the level of the end game pet you want, you should go tame it and keep it until 60 so that you don't ever have to worry about leveling it up later...which sucks ass in Vanilla by the way...you really don't want to have to mess with leveling up a pet that's way lower level than you.
---
I love The Rake because he's level 10...he has 1.2 attach speed...I prefer a dps cat pet personally...by level 16 I have him at max loyalty and hardly ever have to feed him anymore.
---
That's my hunter pet path usually.  The Rake at 10
---
\#ketofam
---
To be fair, based on the post we're in here and your comment, it wasn't a stretch to assume you were obese.  lol
---
She does the videogames, but does she do the sex?
---
Stardew Valley every now and then, same with Monster Hunter World.
---
Sort of, the founding members of the Silver Hand just happened to be all men. Other than that, there were plenty of female paladins fighting in the Second and Third wars.
---
For rogues, pick the cloak!!!!
---
The boots can be replaced by T0.5 boots eventually, and provide the same same stealth bonus nightscape boots.
---
The cloak stacks with slow fall making you take a massive reduction to fall damage and distance before you do.
---
The mask can be replaced by a ton of other items, despite most rogues taking it, anyway. The cloak tho with slowfall and a stealth enchant is probably the best utility item in the game.  Mechanics &gt; Minor stat boots on a single item.
---
Hunters make fantastic alts. Easy to gear on throwaway loot, great farming/grinding. Can take tranq shot duties when necessary if you're raiding on your main and the guild doesn't want extras down the road. High pvp skill cap regardless of gear, which is pretty rare in classic.
---
Everyone waxed on here poetically about wpvp but 90% of my fights are lopsided or getting yanked while I‚Äôm already fighting monsters. I understand the appeal but I personally never cared for it as a pillar of wow that‚Äôs my 2 cents I know a vast majority will disagree. Yes I‚Äôll be playing on a pvp server. Yes I know this decision will lead me to being ganked.
---
Good news is, you can ask a female character out on a rl date, very good chance she'll turn out to be a guy, so you can get your boyfriend that way.
---
Or move to Thailand and get a lady boy, best of both worlds.
---
They could implement a rehash of the old talents like you say, but I also think that they could roll out separate classic style servers for the next expansion. Ones that have scaled up mobs, fewer flight paths/graveyards, pop caps, no shards, no dailies, server only BGs, and no LFR. Basically a ‚Äúhard mode‚Äù server that requires you to actually care about mob tags, talk to other players, game the economy, and have WPVP over resource nodes and stuff.
---
I played it back in the days so I know. I just prefere the slower experience. At lvl 6 you usually pick your professions and you need to level them, you have to buy skills but not all of them if you want to have your mount at lvl 40 etc. Even though I won‚Äòt raid at 60 it feels more of an accomplishment even getting this far
---
There is not really any cookie cutter builds for druid as you can switch your points anywhere to fit your play style there are tons of different variants of specs.  
---
I‚Äôm just poking fun because this spec obviously shows you have no clue how old talents worked.  Which is fine, we all start somewhere it‚Äôs just funny to look at.
---
My very first character, I ran to Goldshire at level 1 and saw a NE rogue with the defias mask on and for some reason I thought he was horde. Also I remember mailing someone to ask them how to speak in General chat
---
I resubbed last month to grind up tokens. Made 4 + 1 for resub in total and let my sub run out yesterday, taking a short break. My brother introduced me to Magic: The Gathering Arena last week, so I've been fumbling my way through that. Been struggling to get into Division 2, but I need to finish it.  Sea of Thieves got a massive update yesterday. May take that back up.
---
Being a Rey pally till mid 40s. LoL.
---
Will play on english servers because I see my english turned out pretty bad over the years (from austria)
---
p2 PvP will probably be best as a hunter when it comes to self-reliance. Warriors are best if you think you'll have heals, shaman are best if you want to heal.
---
Druids are 1000x better than Paladin when it comes to tanking. Warriors and Druids are A tier, Paladins are C tier. Warriors and Druids are actual tanks, Paladins are kind of a meme. Also Warriors and Druids can dual-role with a single talent setup. It‚Äôs as simple as going Bear Form or Defensive Stance. Paladins, on the other hand, can‚Äôt just tank on the fly. They have to spec into it. You can‚Äôt tank without Consecration and Imp. RF, minimum.
---
useless comment of the thread award goes toooooo
---
Lol dude, the faction hate was real in vanilla, I remember one of my guildmates telling this story of these dudes they met in a diner on vacation and they found of they played wow and they got all excited and talked about it for like 20 mins, then my they found out he played horde and it ended with loud cursing and my guild mate leaving the retaraunt lmao
---
Never bothered to level them beyond 110. I mean, it's not like 110-120 takes monumental amounts of time anyhow (I think even without playing for rested XP, you can hit max level with entire zones undone). Still, might be worth the investment.
---
B-b-but... s-socialims wo-works!
---
Joke aside this is actually a legit concern, I don't even know what to think of it suddenly. Any news on what was the reaction in Runescape, and if there was, the reasoning behind it?
---
Not shit cause I‚Äôm gonna be broke lol
---
Thank you, I remember spending hours setting up my UI in vanilla.  It was much harder to create a "clean and consistent" look back then because there weren't massive addon overhaul packs like there were later (and if there were, I didn't know about them).  I manually adjusted the colors, bar textures, positioning, styles, etc of a bunch of different addons to get them all to look and feel the same.
---
I don't see a problem here. You spot a gold farmer. You get him/her banned.
---
If someone really wants to help others, there are much better alternatives then fighting for someone's right to sell gold in wow through 3rd party websites. I don't know why would anyone consider this an important issue.
---
Exactly the same as every other gold farmer
---
Nope
---
&gt;I also want to heal so I think this might be the best choice
---
bless u
---
Classic isn't free with a BFA subscription.  BFA is free with a Classic subscription.
---
Theyre going to release retail 8.2 first in july and then release classic after that small amount of content hype dies down again, probably in September
---
Make sure you're having fun. Those games can drag a person down.
---
How will classic work again will I have to buy a copy or do I get it with retail and retail sub?
---
Agreed. Warriors need more money and constant upgrades while leveling up
---
Sort of? Males in Night Elf society have always been able to be soldiers. If we look at the War of the Ancients, plenty of male night elves served as soldiers, not just militia.
---
Since this tool is designed to search only classic information, and classic is based on 1.12, I assumed from the start that the range of patches would be small enough that it would be unimportant. Seeing your comment is a direct counter argument to that. I will put it into the backlog of items for this project and figure out the best way to achieve this.
---
Thank you for your suggestion
---
&gt;Leveling is a part of the game instead of an extremely long intro to the actual game.
---
Whilst I fully agree with this half the people on here and most of the YouTubers seem to think otherwise. 
---
With so many speed leveling guides and people saying to skip whatever doesn't give you the most exp per hour you could be forgiven for thinking the leveling process was just a boring chore you have to do to get to the actual game.
---
Depends on if you want to have a life outside wow just kidding you can totally play part time and eventually do content just might take you longer. Mage is a good clothie class because they bring the best CC in the game for 5mans and water and dps to raids.
---
You do. Ever tried lvling during vanilla and your void walker got the kill? Yea, no regen for you then.
---
I really hope there is 20 vennies killing devilsaurs on every server
---
o7
---
My biggest one will forever be how I couldn't figure out how to turn the camera, probably due to how I came straight from Warcraft 3.
---
 I had the camera top-down like an RTS game slowly made my way through Shadowglen while only being able to see a metre in each direction around my character. When I found the Moss Spider cave, I was completely convinced that I had found Undercity and expected to find Mal'Ganis each time I turned a corner.
---
I never found him.
---
I just bought a month because I got my original rogue back and wanted to see all the old stuff he had on him. And after like literally 30 mins I logged off because I was already bored. Bfa killed it for me. Going to be classic from here on out unless the next xpac is something fierce.
---
Who cares? How is that Bliizzards problem?
---
I bought it, couldn't get into it. Read about it, ended up realizing I picked the hard mode vampire clan - Nosferatu. It just made me according to how I answered the questions.. I'll have to reroll.
---
Screenshot sadly shows nothing because this is a sandbox (aka private) server. 
---
However, the last blue post said they were restoring patch-by-patch vendor data, and mounts are normal vendor items, so it does actually seem rather likely at this point.
---
Gold farm to sell stays illigal.
---
Same as weed farm to sell.
---
I must be mistaken on the item/boss then. I know I needed on something I shouldn't have &amp; got heavy hate for it. I didn't even understand how the need/greed system works. I'm thinking "yeah, I need that. Wtf does greed mean?"
---
Each to their own! I spent my teen/uni years trying very hard to "fit in" and push myself to socialise. Now that I'm more comfortable I'm pretty happy just to be an introvert and sit at home, either gaming or painting models. I work as a teacher and that takes all my social energy. I'm happy enough :) Went clubbing on holiday recently and it was just so boring I went and sat in the corner to read an e-book.
---
Maybe just let people buy gold if that's what they want to spend their money on.
---
Play the faction YOU want to play otherwise you‚Äôll be stuck on the wrong side when your friends inevitably quit, and you‚Äôll either have to suck it up or reroll.
---
If it's not a screen, it's my hobby desk. I spend more time painting historical miniatures than gaming :)
---
I think WotLK is super overrated. There's a reason I quit at the end of that expansion. Gameplay wise I don't think it was the peak of WoW at all even though it might have been numbers wise.
---
The reason why WoW went downhill is because they wanted to make it more popular and to appeal to as much of a mainstream audience as possible, so they had to change the game to suit that audience and the game lost all of its' flavor, so saying that something was good because it was "popular" or had the most consumers is always a terrible metric to judge with in my opinion.
---
&gt; I never considered the positive human impact of gold farming before.
---
Don't see it too much as a positive impact. As with anything these operations can easily become exploitable. There was the same issue in China back in the day, with a running joke about Chinese gold farming sweatshops.
---
Do you like having the only good AoE heal? Then they're great
---
Probably the very first week I was playing I heard about people 'speed hacking' so every time I saw a warrior use charge I reported them for speed hacking (because how else could they go so fast?)
---
Most? Lol
---
Am I the only one who wants the original ui as well? There‚Äôs something nostalgic about the full page interface menu with 12 options and that aged parchment background.
---
Unbelievable the difference between warrior and other classes.
---
I'm here following vanilla guide and grinding mobs between quests to make sure I am always a level above mobs or else questing becomes too hard/expensive.
---
Meanwhile a level 23 mage is farming 10 level 22 gnolls at the same time.
---
But isn't that what half the people on here tell every one to do? Minus the dungeon finder.
---
Thats the name of the frontman from cannibal corpse
---
In descolace i tried to get one centaur clan to hate me (rep) then the same one to like me i tried to hate me. The mobs were grey and I realized i'm not getting xp.
---
Suddenly rethinking my decision to switch to Alliance for Classic...
---
Lightning bolts to the faces of alliance.
---
As someone who owns an armchair, they are much more simple to develop than video games.  I don't wish to be rude, but you should take a seat.
---
I'm pretty sure the first gold I ever got, I went and spent on one of those common two-handers you can get from weapon vendors. The one that kind of looks like a katana. I thought since it was so expensive, it must be good.
---
L o L
---
It's an extremely sad situation, but it's not Blizzard's fault. I don't expect them to act any differently, and I don't think they should.
---
This is my issue as well with the game. Doing the actual pve itself is more fun. More complex rotations, more cooldown timings, more challenging mechanics to deal with.
---
Literally everything else in the game is worse to me.
---
I leveled to 60 as a holy priest.
---
Priest lol. The only healer with a wand.
---
Hard to tell. There are lots of "nolifers" in this sub that say the prioritize gaming over a girlfriend and kids.
---
You should read the story of the tragedy of the commons, as well as the king who buys cobras to take care of his city's snake problem.
---
It is not blizzards problem.
---
Omg it has a stun proc?!
---
I told my wife of  one month I‚Äôm getting to 60 on time or I‚Äôm getting a divorce lol. She loves how much I‚Äôm excited for classic.
---
I thought the mods made these posts unallowed?
---
If not, let me Google a picture of the game discs and the manual and give me my karma!
---
Wow he got the Okama Game Sphere!
---
I subbed recently when the alpha happened because I wanted a BETA invite. will probably just cancel it soon though and wait
---
I did not realize autorun was a hotkey in the game until about mid 30s on my first serious character.  I literally held down W to go everywhere for the first couple of months that I played WoW.
---
Do not reward blizzard for bfa's mistakes, wait until classic so they can see the numbers and understand what the community really wants.
---
For everything shitty about Cata it had a really good progression system from Heroics to raiding...for a couple of months before it was all nerfed to shit.
---
The problem was dungeon finders are too simplistic when it comes to getting roles that can CC and do mechanics properly.
---
When you compare the raw specs to a desktop equivalent sure, but miniaturization and portability come at a cost. Whether or not that extra cost is worth it to you really depends on your use case and budget.
---
That being said, I happen to agree with your sentiment. I have a good gaming desktop setup and then a surface book for on the go.
---
Not particularly related but my friend from back when I was at college could type at 120-140 WPM just through playing wow from 2006-2010 as he hated using a mic.
---
Prime example of a huntard =D
---
f**k you maybe.
---
You could just write an add-on to do this.
---
I've been subbed since BC. I paused it in Warlords because there was nothing to do. Have had a paid sub ever since Legion prepatch.
---
Im subbed and have been on and off since 2005, i only unsub when i get burned out, not because i dont agree with the game.
---
Probably Lock then if you want to raid
---
So, something like 27464? Haha.
---
Nice job screenshotting a video to farm karma instead of actually providing the video link.
---
I really just hate how everything is capped, tracked on your UI and there are all these opportunity loss rewards, like world quests.
---
Bonus honor on first win of the day only, so don't bother continuing BGs after a win since it's no longer worthwhile.
---
Just let me fucking play the game and respect my time/effort for whatever I WANT to do.
---
When you make it explicitly clear that you were joking and people respond by downvoting ten times harder... some people are just out to be dicks, apparently.
---
August or Sept is my guess for sure.
---
I want everyone to know I am playing World of Warcraft and not to disturb me.
---
I think you can already see how much more interest there is in classic.  Look at reddit subscriptions.  like 18k for retail and 78 for classic.
---
Hunters can feel cheesy af. You play the game on easy mode. Pet mini-game is interesting though.
---
Shamans have to place 4 totems that are all on the GCD constantly. Group walks away from them? Move up and re-place them, slacker. Can be tedious.
---
Warriors are tanks. If you don‚Äôt want to tank, don‚Äôt play a Warrior. There‚Äôs no reason for you to not tank every dungeon you do as a Warrior. If you aren‚Äôt willing to tank you‚Äôre limiting yourself for no reason.
---
Sounds like a problem for Venezuelans to figure out
---
What? No.
---
Part of the dishonor was that you roleplayed the act of killing innocent NPCs. They were collateral most of the time, but it was necessary to inform you of your poor decisions, or malicious intent. I honestly forgot about DKs until this very moment, but I look forward to the old system.
---
I won‚Äôt be doing this but that‚Äôs because I only speak English and I prefer to be able to communicate effectively.
---
Not even joking. We've got orders to Fairbanks, AK she is from Anchorage, AK. Her and the kids are moving back until I move up in November.
---
I used to taunt enemies that were already attacking me.
---
Same here. I had a Tauren druid once and I must have spent a good few hours trying to collect enough silver to buy a full set of common leather gear from the vendor in Bloodhoof Village.
---
No point to bring politics into this. Venezuela was doing great under the "socialist" Hugo Chavez. Much of the resource problems that Venezuelans are facing are due to corporate boycotts - a problem of capitalism.
---
Like, a metric fuck ton.
---
I gave BFA a try and it was dogshit.
---
Which professions are the best for shaman? Herbalism + alchemy seem like a good choice because of gathering herbs in ghost wolf, but I've been doing herb+alch on retail since MoP, so I wonder if there are some other interesting choices.
---
Incentive to overthrow their corrupt and decadent regime instead of letting them run away from the problem.
---
I struggled with the same question (pally vs priest, as Dwarf) and landed very solidly on Priest. 
---
Human isn't better at all (unless Sword w/ Ret) until they have a lot of Spirit, which is less relevant to HPal regen anyway, you just want crits.
---
I'd say go Priest if you don't really really enjoy the Paladin Seals and CDs. Leveling is such a nightmare, and if you do want to go a DPS spec, not having movement or range really hinders you at times.
---
I love pally, but I just can't quite do it before Crusader Strike and having a taunt
---
Sounds good, havent thought about it that way.
---
But that comes down to a monetizing problem also.
---
They would pretty much have to develop 2 games at the same time and get half the money so to speak
---
(exaggerated of course but you get the idea).
---
One thing I love about this post is the likes. For every like it's $15 of lost revenue for Blizzard.
---
Dwarf Shadow Priest best Priest
---
Solid advice ‚úä
---
It's not healthy to needlessly speculate. Nobody here has an answer, or any knowledge that would suggest their prediction is any more valid than the next person's.  My advice would be to just unsub for a bit. 
---
You will fall prey to overhype and destroy the game for yourself. Beware! Turn back before it's too late!
---
People don‚Äôt like to hear it, but you don‚Äôt need a SPriest in a raid. A healer Priest can spec into SW and manage the debuff while also healing.
---
I found leveling early levels fun and a reason to choose faction/race/class quite easy.
---
Edge edge
---
I would argue that pally and priest are about equal in terms of pvp. It just depends what role you enjoy playing. Pally excels at "healbot" if you like being in the back line throwing out heals and buffing your teammates then pally is probably the best. Priest trades some of that raw healing power for some offensive power with abilities like mana burn (a pally's worst nightmare) fear bomb, silence if you go tri spec etc.. 
---
The best way to think of it is pally's make great defensive healers and priests make great offensive healers. This is slightly more true for ally side as well since priest has the only offensive dispel for them while shamans get purge, flip side is priest is the only defensive dispel for horde side.
---
Also to note dwarf is a great pvp pick for priest with stoneform, since the one thing priests can't dispel is poison while pally can.
---
Blizzard has the opportunity to learn from this, however, they are such a different company nowadays with different leaders all throughout. They have much different goals and a completely new demographic.  
---
As much as I'd like to see Blizzard take something away from this and rise from the ashes, I don't see it happening.  
---
The only reason we're getting Classic is because they believe that there is enough demand for them to make a profit, not because their company ideals changed.
---
Even if it just lists phases it would be useful.
---
It was dreary, yeah, but for someone looking to escape some early-30's STVietnam ganking, it was nice!
---
I'm in stitches hahaha
---
Probably bags. And then I may switch to alchemy at some point and sell Arcanite bar transmutes.
---
Gonna be hard to twink early tbh
---
Not during time walking, got a warlock up in an afternoon of dungeon spam.
---
I didn't know what a talent was until I hit level 22 with my forsaken mage. 
---
/sigh
---
Waiting for the next iteration of this shitpost.
---
Depends on your goals.
---
Espa√±ol est√° bien f√°cil. Aprend√≠ en 8 meses viviendo en M√©xico. La idioma es diferente en texto la verdad, c√≥mo ingl√©s. Tienes sus propios acr√≥nimos y que sea... 
---
Es m√°s f√°cil en mi opini√≥n a hablar en persona para aprender la idioma o mejorar tus habilidades,  pero los habilidades de textear s√≠ son importante a aprender un d√≠a, la neta jajaja
---
some of it has been on youtube for a few days.
---
I foresee this going into an infinite loop. I'll wait.
---
You underestimate the amount of casuals that play retail wow and will play it, no matter what Blizz throws at them. I also have my doubts that classic will overtake retail after the first 1-2 months also
---
Have they ever delayed a release like this though? Not one I can think of.
---
This is internal alpha testing at Blizz, the title got it wrong that's why I posted it with a subtle change...
---
Hopefully there will be lots of compression artifacts and ifunny watermarks
---
If this is your mindset, you probably shouldn't even bother.
---
Nah, I am always using the original GUI for the skillbars and only used some additional indicators (timers, DPS meters and such) for raids.
---
It also still has the same core issue that has plagued every expansion since Cataclysm. Why bother doing anything when you can wait a month for the next content patch and replace all your gear with random items from world quests?
---
There is really no point playing the game as a more casual player wanting to slowly progress your character on your own time. Catchup gear is just too rampant.
---
Lol really?! The evidence is staring you in the face and you still cannot accept that it was socialism that led to Maduro in the first place. Capitalism wasnt the problem, it was socialism that put Maduro into office
---
Play Druid. Better for what you want based on what I read there and my perspective. 
---
Druid is far better at tanking, but significantly worse at healing. You do get Rebirth and Innervate, but lose the regular Rez and the best defensive CDs in the game. Druid is more fun to level and do general world stuff by a big margain, too.
---
I'm considering unsubbing from this subreddit because WoW is like cocaine lol
---
Yeah most of them have a "best" choice but they're put up against some really tempting alternatives.
---
Repost.
---
For a leveling priests, the wand is crucial. Put 5 points in wand spec in the Discipline tree. It speeds up leveling considerably.
---
yeah, the helm MIGHT be attractive since we won't have Lionheart helm for awhile, but the shoulders are easily replaced with Truestrike or even that Green BRD quest shoulders with a bunch of +hit on it.
---
But it also depends on IF we even have the class quests. They were added later and blizzard has said they are delaying some items/quests added later.
---
To muddy the waters, the class quests weren't all added at the same time. They were added across vanilla (starting around 1.6 or so) with some classes not getting theirs until NAXX.
---
So we might not even have the ST class quests until phase 3.
---
This is a good post - none of this happened in a vacuum. More of Sweden's resources are nationally owned than Venezuela's, yet Sweden has one of the highest living standards in the world.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Disabling features like LFR and cross sever BGs doesn‚Äôt require separate art/music/balance/etc it‚Äôs just turning off something. Same goes for removing graveyards and FPs. Yes it‚Äôs not just clicking a button or deleting a line of code but it doesn‚Äôt require the full wow team to work on it. They could probably just literally double the HP of the mobs and call it a day. The sharding part would be trickier but if it kept sub numbers up it would be worth the work.
---
It's weird, because Monster and redbull both smell like a chemical I would put in a vehicle, not to mention what they even taste like
---
^(to be fair, Rockstar Punched is the only one I'll drink)
---
It took me two months irl to realise i could eat and drink at the same damn time. I used to just do one and then the other on my newbie druid wasting all that time xD
---
it ain't an american thing. You have confused summer in our terms with the actual defined summer.
---
For us summer is all of June/July/August but thats just the seasonal.
---
The equinox for Summer is 21st of June and again 23rd of September. Hence businesses/governments define that as actual summer and not the season itself.
---
I must be doing it wrong. I subbed last week and have almost 1 day played and am only to level 45. Been constantly running dungeons and doing quests too. Maybe it's because I don't have the xp boosting heirlooms.
---
Never played before but always been interested. I‚Äôm more interested in finding a cool group of people to level with and possibly raid, but I know nothing about the game so should be interesting to see if I can find a casual group to hang out with.
---
Cata heroics were fucking amazing. I loved the difficulty, fuck up once, and have fun recovering without wiping. So good
---
Regime change? That has never gone wrong.
---
Damn ITT lots of whipped dudes. My fiance and I have been together for nearly 8 years and she's known since day 1 that what I do is what I do (within reason) and we got problems if she's got a problem with what I do.  She respects what I like to do and I respect what she likes to do, that's all it takes.
---
If you got a girl that tries to control what you do or bitches because you're doing the hobby you love doing, probably time to get far away from that mess.
---
I know, they both taste amazing.
---
To all the Hunter and Shaman players out there: I would ask you to tell me why your class is the best and most fun there is!
---
thats me ;)
---
Are Sunken Temple quests will be available from launch or starting only after Phase 2/3 or whatever number?
---
I can imagine you sitting there thinking you were going to go to the main city with unheard of amounts of cash to throw around due to your cleverness. Sitting there making cherry bombs with a grin on lol.
---
I can't quite decide between a warlock or mage. Pvp server. While I played a warlock on most vanilla servers, my favourite class was always mage.
---
Youd think we'd learn eventually. Actors make terrible presidents.
---
...yeah, he's the guy being interviewed.
---
I remember spamming "If u give me [Defias Rapier] I give u 2g" to people in whisper.
---
Don't think I knew trade or yell existed.
---
&gt;People who play in a pitch-black room with their monitor brightness turned up to 98%... how are you not blind?
---
Your eyes adjust pretty easily, and you can turn the brightness down lower than if you were playing in a brightly lit room.
---
FF7?
---
It honestly isn't our problem. Blizzard will continue to ban gold farmers because it is against TOS.
---
I'm not gonna play a game just to buy gold from someone in Venezuela knowing it is against TOS.
---
I remember running into Darn for the first time and asking my buddies what level the ancient protectors were. They told me somewhere around a million or so.
---
They were part of the lore since vanilla
---
Since it's WoW that would be Staga. Not too convinced of that one, hehe. Well maybe a bank.
---
Looking for input on my class choice - have mained Shaman since 2007 (was an alt-oholic before then).I'm very excited to come back to Classic WoW but as many my free time and priorities have changed since then.
---
Goals: Completion-ism, Dungeons, Tier0 and later Tier0.5, PvP in between things but only when I feel like it
---
I am not expecting to be a full on raider, I will most likely spend a lot of time solo/in 5mans. I want to be able to let me completion-ism flourish with rep/pet/mount grinds, completing a dungeon set, etc.
---
This is pushing me towards Hunters. From my research this would be a great class to allow me to hit my goals, but also has a high enough skill level with rotations and auto-shot clipping that I can have some fun with it. It would also be a class that I may be able to swing into a raid every now then with.
---
Is this agreeable or would anyone recommend another class for this?Thanks!
---
Your hard work definitely shines through! I remember it was particularly difficult to get something to look clean/uncrowded when monitors tended to be pretty small back then.
---
There's some truth to it though. At the end of the day you are just fighting other players. Vanilla have a lot more depth to the amount of gear you can equip in PvP, a higher amount of consumables you are allowed to use and dramatically more spells to use per class.
---
Having more of all of the above does increase the complexity of PvP quite dramatically and trying to downplay this is not really being honest.
---
who cares about relationships when you have wow ?
---
Have always been an Alliance player. I don't see that changing now ;)
---
But the reck bombs!!
---
Shield stops about 10% of melee damage and reflects meaningful damage vs a rogue or feral druid.  Even with an average 2h you can get up to 6 instant attacks depending on how many stacks.  That will do a lot more damage than block damage- but to each his/her own.  
---
I pvp a lot as holy/prot (25/26/0) on a pserver and managed to get full t2, t2.5 and corrupted ashbringer, so granted the gear is god-tier but it is a crazy fun spec.  I think in prebis with the unstoppable force you'd still be a very threatening character just for your heals + burst potential.
---
I destroyed my hearthstone. And I also fell victim to buying white item weapons from vendors.
---
Technically Maduro was democratically elected into office. You could make the argument that the election was illegitimate due to the government blocking certain candidates from running against him, but that has nothing to do with socialism. Authoritarianism exists in capitalist nations as well.
---
Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?
---
It is the sound of your ~~doom~~overhype.

Nice

At least Classic WoW won't give you STDs
---
Yea it's gross. I just want some items to be so special that you get it in the first raid and use it all expansion long. Maybe only for certain classes that synergize with the effects, but it makes the loot more special.
---
I have a similar story form when I was in Elementary School. I was playing Runescape and one of my friend's characters got hacked, then started sending me messages saying he was going to hack my account and brick my computer. I got terrified that my parent's computer could be broken I completely deleted my account(I had full rune that I was very proud of) and then tried to download and run a bunch of virus scans, and subsequently went to my parents crying that our computer was going to be hacked.
---
I'm subscribed. Contrary to almost everyone on this sub I like current WoW AND Classic both.
---
I do a lot of Roleplay too so that's a bonus. My guild is waiting for 8.2 before we go back to active play however.
---
Technically. But more like repost inception.
---
Being able to toggle auto attack for some classes (I think Hunter) can be useful.
---
Check Tips Out video for Progression Classic VS moder wow.
---
not just memes, can be crucial when fighting hunters to close the gap.
---
I love you for this comment.
---
He made it worse.. So more like sex, but also rape..
---
I think I may have got there and then had to go a different way. I can't remember the full details cos it was a good few years ago.  I just remembered dying, then corpse running, then dying...
---
I subscribed to 'warm up' to wow again but unsubbed after a month. It's just too far from the game I want to play.
---
Unfortunately I will most likely be playing Ally because of friends so the rake that early will be out of the question.  I do agree with finding the right pet because leveling them up later sucks balls.
---
I do however really enjoy the cats, and will most likely be going Female NE so having a shadowmeld and prowl can be fun.
---
I've always loved the looks of the wind serpents to, but that will be out on Ally side for a while to.
---
Some questions:
---
1. Does sap award CP?
---
2. You say "cheap shot into 2 hemos followed by a kidney shot". Is that even possible within the cheap shot stun window? The cheap stun window is what like 4 seconds? And then you will use 2 hemos which is 60 energy together and kidney shot after just recently used cheap shot. Sounds ambitious to me. Is this something you do? How is the margin of error?
---
3. This is fine and all, but this rotation do any real damage to speak of? Nice CC of course and usable in many situations, but will it kill?
---
I didn‚Äôt realize/notice that there were 3 tabs on the talent tree. Levelled as discipline.
---
I think I was around level 15 at the time and hadn't done the paladin mount questline.
---
Do what I do, and go into deep Demonology, for Soullink-Affliction.
---
Is it the most efficient Specc? Hell no.
---
Will it get you to R14? Hell No.
---
Is it fun? **HELL YES!**
---
Why is it fun? Because I don't give a rats ass about WotF. I don't have to fear them, because I am about as tanky as a Protwarrior as far as most Rogues are concerned.
---
Yeah its almost like they're professional liars or something
---
The holiday of course being American Mother's day which is in 11 days. So hop to it lads and get your mom something nice.
---
All Iance, All the time.
---
4. What do you do if your sap opener doesn't lead back to stealth?
---
haha, that wasn't one of the first things I learned as a tank either...
---
I got to like level 25 on my first character but decided I wasn't happy with the talents I selected, so I deleted it and started over
---
Funny, here it used to be the other way around, many games used to get proper Czech dubbing. Our Warcraft 3 voiceovers were legendary (sadly discontinued and not avaliable anymore). But nowadays even Czech made games (Arma, Kingdom Come) don't have it.
---
Vanilla/Classic WOW was and is the most casual friendly version of WOW.
---
My first character was a NE rogue.  I fell off teldrasil while exploring a branch that went out off the island.  While falling I managed to land on another branch and die to fall damage.   I had to walk to Ruth Aran village and port to darnassus, find where I kinda thought I fell and jump to attempt to rez.   The rez icon turned red for 0.5 seconds as I fell right passed it.   Walked back to try again.  The walk took 15+ minutes each time.  I spent about 5 hrs that day trying to rez.  I finally manage to click that red button just at the right instant and bam I am alive, falling,  and boom I am dead again.  At least this time kinda on the ground.  So I make my last walk to mt body.   Go repair my gear.   Call my friend to vent because this experience nearly made me quit the game,  he then explains to me that you can talk to the spirit healer.   What a fucking waste of time that day.
---
HALP!
---
Really struggling with my choice between Orc Hunter and Undead Shadow Priest. I will mostly do PvP (world and BGs) -- though I like dungeons and raids, and I don't mind healing (though the idea of paying for respeccing a lot doesn't blow my hair back). I also won't be playing more than a few hours a week... :(
---
(p.s. to me, pet management sounds like a pro, not a con ... yay for class flavor!)
---
I was making reference to an old WoW youtube series :)
---
Sounds like you really enjoyed WotlK lol. 
---
After that long read, it sounds like we are just complete opposites in what we enjoy in WoW. You really enjoy lore, aesthetics, mood, storytelling etc. While those are cool and kind of necessary, they're in the backseat for me.
---
I literally loved about vanilla and TBC for it's world pvp, condensed server populations on only one or two continents/world, the gear hunting, min/maxing stats, helping noobs getting ganked, simple battlegrounds, and probably a lot more tiny things im not noting.
---
I cared about the aesthetic too etc, but I just thought azeroth and outland were beautiful and didn't think so for northrend except for a few exceptions. Connecting lore to the land or quests or something I know nothing about or cared about. I still don't even know why we killed Ragnaros, but I loved doing it because he dropped Perdition's Blade and I really wanted it lol.
---
The pvp in WotlK was so so so terrible to me. I couldn't even recognize the rogue class anymore. I don't doubt pve was good or maybe better but the separate raid tiers basically giving out epics felt so wrong to me. I still remember everyone feeling that same way, that epics were handed out at that point. Even the pvp epics in that one raid from the world pvp event in wintergrasp? It was so lame that you could just down an easy boss without knowing anything and be possibly given amazing pvp gear that others had to grind for weeks for.
---
ah but anyway... don't want to get too into it. Just everything about vanilla and TBC were great for me for what I cared about. It wasn't until WotlK that I felt like the things I cared about started getting removed from the game and instead wanted me to start caring about the story more or pve more or daily quests more etc.. I just didn't want any of it.
---
And now I can have two monitors!
---
For two different porn videos!
---
Who knows. I'm going with the assumption that they'll be available from Phase 1 until they state otherwise. I don't see Blizzard going through the effort and doing progressive quest implementation since they've already stated that they're not doing progressive itemization.
---
Ive been unsubbed since I beat Antorus. My guild died during Tomb over shitty leadership who didn't want to be there and I managed to find a group to do Antorus with but it wasn't as fun. I heard bad things about BFA before it came out so I never even started. Messed around on a private server awhile back and had loads of fun, hitting 40 without ever feeling like I was grinding. Decided to step back and wait for Classic to keep the hype.
---
&gt; Dude, where was your mount
---
Ahh, I think I'd stopped playing by that time. I was aware of ROFLMAO
---
I was level 42 before i realised talents were a thing .....
---
My buddy turned me on to Pokemon names a long time ago. I own several on full servers. I may go for the same thing, may not.
---
Check out the tri spec pvp build for priests. You get imp mana burn, holy nova, slience, blackout, mind flay...
---
You're trading healing power/mana for offensive power/utility/control
---
I unsubbed last month since my RL gave up since we are missing people for our raid and she doesn't want to fill the empty places with random people so I took the opportunity and quit. Since I came only for the raid and anyways I find BFA super boring and now I'm waiting for Classic to resub again
---
Alright, you guys convinced me. Ty!
---
Nah man, don't let anyone control your life in any way, ever. You can have respect for your girl just as she can respect you back. If she doesn't respect one of your hobbies that you love doing and only wants to control that hobby than she's not worth it. You gotta find a girl that understands how passionate you are about gaming, especially a game you've been waiting 14 years for. 
---
My fiance and I have been together for 8 years now and we have the utmost unconditional love and respect for each other. Sometimes I want to come home and go upstairs in my game room all night. Sometimes she wants to come home and play Animal Crossing and watch her Hallmark movies all night. We still spend plenty of time together!! I'm lucky to have someone like her though, apparently most women are trying to control their man it would seem. Get out while you can!
---
Would this be called a Metameme?
---
Beats looking at your old comments and finding out you used to be much smarter.
---
Best Classic WoW podcast, you‚Äôre missing out if you‚Äôre not listening.
---
&gt;Sorry for edging off you elitists for fuck sakes.
---
What are you even saying?
---
&gt;I was scared of the AH because I thought it used real money
---
You weren't a noob, you were just a few years ahead of Blizzard.
---
Thats the name of the frontman of cannibal corpse
---
Still subbed but I really dont play much, I mostly do fluff achievements, run a random low level dungeon, or mess with transmog. Classic needs to hurry up!
---
Has to be Horde for me since I want to play Shaman.
---
Yes, I leveled as holy priest in vanilka, BC, wrath, and part of legion. Let people play how they want. It's a game, not some race to endgame repetition. Leveling is quick now regardless of how you do it. 
---
I leveled my pally as prot last weekend and some hunter followed me around talking about how I was stupid to not level as ret. I'm just like, dude it's an alt. I'm in no rush, but further I like prot. Taking on 6+ mobs at once working on utilizing my save and self heal buttons effectively. I'm not impacting you, just let me be.
---
You have a point but it‚Äôs a better metric than a sub of people who **generally** are set in their ways and hate anything after the first expansion. That would be like asking my grandpa for music recommendations. It‚Äôs not it.
---
They're not exactly filler, they're for additional context to the comments being made.
---
Fem dwarf?
---
Oh man, that wouldn't happen for me. Suffice to say, younger me was one of those 'redpilled' on the internet, being an ignorant asshole before they even called it that. And then I grew up and realized I was such an asshole so I changed, massively.
---
There are a couple examples that I know of and they seemed to be attributed to the color of their eyes.  As I understand it, a Night Elf born with yellow glowing eyes is destined from birth for greatness.  Therefore afforded opportunities not granted to anyone else and put in positions of power.  A prime example is Kur'talos Ravencrest (bright yellow glowing eyes) who lead the Kaldorei resistance during the War of the Ancients, similar to your example.
---
Also, you may notice Blizzard made sense of this issue by making all of the male Night Elves in WoW have yellow eyes.  :p
---
Are there any other examples that you can think of where this concept doesn't fit?
---
I mean come on. This is getting ridiculous. I understand the complains people have for modern wow, but pve is something you can‚Äôt compare with classic, especially difficulty...
---
**OH MAN** I've really wanted to go Demonology since that's what I played in Vanilla (I was 9 years old) Glad to hear someone talk positively about the spec!
---
Recursive loop!
---
using all my money to buy fish offhands and goblin shredder manual pages at like level 15
---
Pwnt
---
Have they ever released an official vanilla era version of world of Warcraft a decade after it originally was released?
---
If ever you needed a reason to go male human (as I will)...THIS IS IT :D
---
man.. i remember doing this from lvl 55-60 cause i didnt have anymore quests and didnt wanna run to the other continent
---
i went elemental spec too half fire half frost
---
Yeah, Orgrimmar.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
I remember hastily pulling the plug from the power strip when I saw a pop up window that mentioned something about an "illegal operation". I then ran and camped out behind our fence for a few areas where it was heavily wooded and no one could see me. I was sure the police were on their way.
---
I think telling other people how to play a game and thinking your way to play is the only way. That your definition of fun is the only one. I do think that is pretty elitist. Or maybe self centered. Call it whatever you want.
---
Funfact: "pfui" means something like "gross!" in german
---
Nobody asked me my spec when I was healing because I had consumables and did a good job. You can raid heal 30/0/21 which is FUCKING AMAZING in PvP.  Everyone says Shadow Priest melt faces, and it's true I played one, but Elemental Shaman FUCK SHIT UP BAD. Imagine an instant cast chain lightning followed by frost shock taking someone's health down 40-50% (remember that shamans are crit heavy especially with pvp gear), and then finishing off with more lightning and kiting with frost shocks while a earthbind totem is keeping someone snared and a fire totem (which doesn't do much damage but is loud and throws people off because it sounds devistating)...and if someone does get near you, you have mail armor and a shield on along with a fire buff on your weapon until your next frost shock.  Need to interrupt a cast? Earth shock. Hunter viper sting? Dispell poison or totem for that.  It's pretty sick, albeit goes OOM very quickly in PvP.
---
Shaman is a great choice. If I were going horde, I'd go shaman hands down.
---
... yeah, he's the guy being interviewed
---
Yes.
---
Since Cata came out.. LOL
---
As a dwarf I tried to get to Stormwind to level in Westfall by passing through the Badlands. 3 hours of dying and breaking my gear got me to give up and hearth back to Dun Morough. I decided to /yell asking how to get to SW and some random replied to to take the train...
---
I wasn't aware of it's requirements in vanilla. I ended up doing it several expansions later. I will probably grind for the ravasaur.
---
My warrior's name will be my DK main's name. I'm gonna play her backstory
---
After I did my wetlands run I never returned until I did the shafowfang keep run. Then I really never returned.
---
Always release the first week of school it seems.
---
Thank you!  I started with a 17" CRT with 1280x1024 resolution (was what these screenshots were taken on) and then in 2007 I was fortunate to get a 24" 1920x1200 LCD which I used during BC (I have a TON of BC and WOTLK screenshots which I found on this same old harddrive, here's one of them):

You can see that I kept the same bar layout and positioning, but ditched the art around them.  Similar unit frames, same buff frames, etc.
---
I agree with the easy to change stuff, but I dont think thats enough for the classic crowd.
---
(Looking at the harsh reaction with #nochanges for example)
---
As soon as you tinker with talents, balancing, dungeon design and other stuff it would probably be too complicated and time consuming.
---
When you look at a dungeon run in vanilla and required CC, manaproblems, uniqueness of classes for example, just doubling the HP wont be enough in my opinion.
---
Yeah but I bet most of them don‚Äôt smell like ass either.
---
As much as I can personally enjoy classic, there is no way in hell its taking retail because the new generation of gamers isn‚Äôt going to pick it up. It‚Äôs going to be supported by the old school players and newbies just stopping by. 
---
It has a lot of gameplay choices that are flawed by modern game design and most games know to not do nowadays. For a tldr, in the general the game is a complete pain in the ass and tedious battle of a journey that the modern gaming audience doesn‚Äôt take kindly to. The things we can look at and say ‚Äúthis feels achieving‚Äù, modern gamers are going to look at and say ‚Äúwtf, why would anyone do this dumb shit‚Äù.
---
You need grim reach.
---
Nope, it's not beta. It's possible to download alpha client somehow and made a so-called sandbox. It's like a small server for one person and it doesn't connect to official servers or private servers. There are no NPCs or other things which are server-side (that's why the character's name on the screenshot is Unknown). But, as we can already see, this sandbox is quite useful for addon developers :)
---
what demo is now or less the go to specc in pvp for lock for years in privat servers 7/31/11+2. 
---
Ofc sometimes ally needs to go destro to provide the burst needed in premate group.
---
But its basicly know to be the most broken specc for 1v1, and has some good use in wpvp.
---
September my friend that‚Äôs the latest and you know they want to make this good since they aren‚Äôt even giving us a beta yet.
---
Played rogue for about a year.  Then GF (now wife!) and I made twin gnome mages for some AoE fun.  Probably about level 25...  
---
"Why aren't you drinking?"  
---
"I'm busy eating"  
---
"LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL"
---
I don't know if that "your character can eat and drink at the same time" loading tooltip was around at that time, but I sure never saw it...
---
Ape of empires
---
Yeah, I got the PUG achievement playing a Disc Priest. Made it through every single heroic. My groups would often go through 3 or 4 new members before we we're able to clear.
---
It was a blast, but the biggest problem was lack of CC and weird compositions from the dungeon finder. A LFG listing tool would have been so much better.
---
Leveling a priest isn't bad. Get a wand ASAP, put 5 points in spirit tap, then 5 points in wand spec, nuke your target to 50% and wand the rest of the way so spirit tap procs and your 5 second rule is in effect.  ONLY WORRY ABOUT STACKING SPIRIT WHEN YOU LEVEL. I cannot emphasize that enough, take Spirit over EVERY other stat. Yes even int. Yes, everything. Spirit, spirit, and more spirit while you level. Worry about other stats at 60 which will be easy if you're willing to heal.  At 40 respec shadow then put the rest of your points in disc for better shield (wand of course, always wand), and up to inner fire until you ding 60. Then go Holy/Disc.

Brutal peak incoming at release
---
I stumbled upon blackfathom depths on accident as a level 20 something priest. I don‚Äôt even know how. It was my first dungeon and first time killing elite mobs. 
---
After trial and error(me dying over and over) i finally killed a few mobs (not skipping the yellow tagged ones cuz I didn‚Äôt know the difference) and found the first big room, and I thought that was the end of the area and still found it to be amazing and eye opening. It took about a year later til I realized you could go farther in. Aaand that you should be bringing a full party.
---
Ah , the horde youth. Never change.
---
There is always a lack of tanks for 5mans. When I played on a PServer, I feral tanked 95% of the time in dungeons.
---
Outward and P99. Outward is easily ruined by watching all the online videos for it so if you do play it make sure to go in blind.
---
I wish more people realized how pointless cataclysm was. Good on you.
---
No, I really don't, because there is no need whatsoever to stay far away from things with this spec :D
---
The other half is skinny stoner gamers.. I eat like the poster guy but I swear smoking + weed keeps me lean as a green lentil bean.
---
wow that is really dumb especially considering that it tells you in the middle of the screen in red letters that you have to equip ammo if you try to shoot without it.
---
Too dumb to read eh?
---
My wife is pregnant with twins for the whole summer. I have already got my sex out of the way.
---
If the majority‚Äôs prediction is correct (that there will be a large initial surge, then a drop off in players of Classic) then fiscally, they would want to end q3 during the surge and before the drop off. Many think the surge will last 6 weeks, but I guess it only matters how long blizzard thinks it will last. Which I don‚Äôt know at all. There‚Äôs my two cents
---
Temple will be available on launch, and all quests and available items will be in ther 1.12 state, meaning we will have the class quests available from the gate.
---
This is also good news for the Horde as we will have the Troll town quests in the hinterlands.
---
Me! I played a few hours of WotLK and loved it. When I finally got the chance to sub and play, it was Mists and I couldn't quite get into it. Still have this weird passion for Warcraft. I am hype for Classic, the wait has vee been so long. Hard stuck between Mage and Priest tho.
---
Lupos won‚Äôt do shadow damage in Classic. You should know this.
---
Nice, I think I started with something similar and moved onto an LCD as well - at my parents expense of course, since it was a shared/family PC and gaming was a new concept xD
---
I wasn't good enough to get raiding in TBC (probably because I was still pretty naive and spending time messing around in STV), but my older brother did all of that and I watched eagerly sometimes.
---
Is there not a better source for this? The Twitter user who posted the screenshot clearly has no idea what's going on.
---
That's actually kind of normal for Vanilla.
---
It‚Äôs interesting how you‚Äôve played Lbringer but still think hunter have a high skill cap when the general consensus on private servers is that hunters are very noob friendly.
---
Gonna go horde this time around, what race would make the best hunter?
---
I don't think that's fair. There was obviously a line crossed at some point (at a different place for different people), but IMO the line was not crossed in TBC. The things that "ruined" WoW were always in motion/some stage of development, even during Vanilla. Had Blizzard had until like 2016 to launch Vanilla, those bad features might have been in at launch.
---
You could just bring a laptop to work and use your card playing time as WoW time.  I've heard nurses simply play cards all day.
---
I feel like the social components will give it life. What keeps me from wow is that no one talks and there is zero community. Retuning the game back to vanilla inherently breeds community and i think that is what keeps people coming back.
---
Ol'Shooty if you want a bear with an eye-patch.
---
I prefer the term hopeful.
---
As a Horde player, I will be more than content with the Undead Skeletal Warhorse on my Orc Shaman.
---
Lmfao yeah. You wanna tackle the most difficult leveling experience imaginable but don‚Äôt even know much about the game???
---
So PF UI will work?
---
*Collapses in relief*
---
It can't be a coincidence that it's very similar to "phooey" in English can it? On the other hand, gross isn't quite the meaning of phooey.
---
I mean of course I want epics etc eventually but I never really raided and it seems like it requires a lot of skill (know all the bosses and strategy which I dont know but everybody seems to know by heart at this point) and time commitment, and I'm afraid to kinda be left out because of that
---
Not a high demand for Rogue? There is definitely a need for that. Rogues are also not very gear dependent and are very strong in solo content. 
---
Warlocks will be fine to play too because they‚Äôre very good at solo play as well and are very easy to level.
---
mods please update the rules, this place owned before it exploded the past month
---
I'm assuming you respecced and then we're still very confused about the lack of damage?
---
Seriously this was really entertaining and relaxing to watch. Usually small clips / memes annoy me a lot in videos, but this was just the right amount.
---
I don't think there is a ravasaur in Classic. This was added post-Cata if I remember correctly.
---
My brother had a friend who drank a can of Red Bull every day for years and genuinely has a hole in his heart now. 
---
A lifetime supply of RedBull sounds like a really bad thing for a body to handle.
---
After reading most of these, I'm glad I was 30 when WoW launched.
---
From what I've read, if you're only going to be able to commit a few hours a week, I think Hunter is the better choice. They level much faster and are more independent. They're both great in PvP from what I understand. I would plan on solely questing if I were you, though.
---
It's cool, you didn't do damage spec'd into retribution either.
---
orc 100%
---
So we're opposites in a lot of things.  Now for the big question.  You going horde or alliance?
---
Slap on a renew, and abuse power word: shield.
---
Priests, mages and warlocks are not as squishy as they appear because they all have some type of +armor buff and a shield.
---
My rl friend, who would eventually become my future guild's Druid Officer, was level 40 when this went down. He was a slow leveller, but I didn't think much of it as he was generally slow at most games and I didn't care as long as he was having fun. In our then /gchat, he asked if anyone would please put a beast-slaying enchant on his staff as he had the mats for it. Nobody thought to question why and it was a reasonable request, so our GM (rl bff) said sure and did it for him in Org.  
---
 About a day or two later, the druid piped up in Ventrilo "Damn man, it takes me so long to level!" I agreed and asked him if he wanted me to speed him through his quests. "Sure, meet me in The Barrens!"  
---
"Wait, The Barrens? Why are you still doing Crossroads quests? You should be miles past that by now!"  
---
"I know, I suck, haha. I just take ages, that's all"  
---
"No shit. Okay, on my way" I get there and he's already on some quest (Mankrik's maybe? I forget). We set off and he decides to melee a plainstrider. With his beast saying enchanted, average-ass weapon. I have a sudden lightbulb moment "\[Name\]. Bro. Have you been melee'ing everything this whole time?" I can't f\*\*\*\*\*\* believe it, but suddenly everything falls into place.  
---
"Yeah! That's why I got the enchant thingy! Gee man, respect, I dunno how you guys level so fast aye", he's a little worn out, but still endlessly optimistic-sounding as ever.  
---
"Tell me you're joking" He'd been playing for at least four months at this point.  
---
"No, why would I lie to you?" Confusion.  
---
Sweet mother of god.  
---
I was torn somewhere between utter disbelief and a temporary insanity that urged me to laugh until I cried. I then immediately pulled the other officers into the vent channel with us and explain the situation.  After everyone finished laughing and got themselves under control again, our very awesome Druid Officer took my friend under his wing and started patiently walking him through the ins and outs of their class. He did eventually become a solid player and a great bear-tank/decent healer in the end. We still laugh about it sometimes and THIS time he won't be taking the melee-staff route.
---
My buddies won't come back because they dont see this.
---
Wu
---
I actually was in Iraq for release of WoW. It took a lot of work to get something to work back then, but the TLDR is that the major problem was latency.   
---
The best way I can explain it, and I am assuming you're American, is trying to play WoW on HughesNet or Dish Network.   
---
Hopefully it will be better for you! Oooh-Rah, brother!
---
Early game hunters are top tier DPS.. If you have pre-raid bis and an auto shot timer, know how to do the rotation properly, finding a guild will be easy
---
Fine I'll add a new comment to this thread just for you.
---
Ah, fighting fire with fire I see.
---
Mods can we get some fucking Onyxia Scale Cloaks please?
---
This is actually pretty good.
---
They have low skill floor and highest skill ceiling. What's the mystery here?
---
Easy to play hard to master.
---
I might be insane, but I resubbed to retail when the WoW Classic Alpha was uploaded to their servers, thinking those with active subscriptions might get dibs on the beta.
---
Warlocks are typically less played than mages. They're both going to be susceptible to those pesky rogues. If you know for a fact that mage is your favorite class, however, I would go with that. Many people don't know what their favorite class is. You just need to make sure you enjoy your time playing.
---
Is there any source for that?
---
No, English is just not my first language, and I failed English in high school (the time wow came out).
---
Paladin or Priest? I mainly want to heal and sometimes PvP.
---
1.) Mage in Stockades telling me that sitting down makes health regenerate faster. 
---
2.) Me sitting down between fights for three months to heal faster.
---
I got kicked from a few early dungeons for pulling stuff on my hunter. It made too much sense for the guy with the bow to pull enemies so I never stopped.
---
One time I had a tank tell me to ease up on my DPS because I was pulling aggro. I called him an idiot. I was a damage dealer, the more damage the better right?
---
I also never exceeded level 45 or so. I found out I didn't have to hit 60 to max out professions. Engineering was my true passion. I spent hours running past ?? mobs in endgame zones to mine Thorium veins. I would also beg groups recruiting for BRD to take me since I knew recipes were in there.
---
Isn't it more like nonsense
---
This was pretty much necessary, even years later when people have access to complete leveling guides, there are points where you have to grind mobs to continue the quest grind.
---
Haha exactly this.
---
Maby 40% of the people in those guilds actually played vanilla and know what to expect.  
---
The others have no idea and like 30% of them probably won't even make it to 60.
---
BETA INTENSIFIES!

Always played alliance, so I'll be shaking it up as horde.
---
I think you are mistaken:
---
/r/wow: 1 million subscribers  
---
/r/classicwow: 78k subscribers
---
Most people who are interested in Classic have already written off retail entirely as a lost cause.
---
So while blizzard could change their direction and go back to making quality, I doubt it.  Mobile Cash grabs seems to be the future for Blizzard (diablo immortal, Hearthstone, etc.)
---
1.  For WoW‚Äôs first Christmas, I decided to send some gold to every member of my ~17 person guild.  Only I didn‚Äôt have enough, so everyone got 50s.  I was level 36 and ended up with about 2.50g after gifts.  Right before level 40...
---
2.  Got all the way to BFD before realizing quest items weren‚Äôt personal.  Was looting all the brain stems until a random guildie I was playing with started yelling at me.  Fortunately we patched things up and she and I became RL friends.
---
3.  Jokingly spoke with an Australian accent when I was trialing for a guild.  They thought I was this cool Aussie kid, so I kept the accent for two years.  &gt;.&lt;. One night in college I got drunk and logged into vent and spoiled the illusion.  Many of them had figured it out by then.
---
Good times.
---
wat? One million for the retail WoW subreddit, 78k for Classic. Where did you get 18k from?
---
Nice fishing zone and used to farm Big Iron fishing pole there
---
Interesting...didn‚Äôt know mounts were in the spell book back in Vanilla.
---
The quality just gets worse and worse for every year. Does Youtube update their compression algorithm every year that screws over old videos like this?
---
&gt; Even the client says beta.
---
That's when I knew for sure.
---
Lol you weren‚Äôt wrong!
---
Go Navy! Retired CPO here, stay cool.
---
Wish I had the same time on my hands as the nurses you hear from.
---
I‚Äôd be lucky to sit down for 2 minutes.
---
I'm sorry to hear about your grandma. My grandma has had a pretty poor quality of life for the last decade as well so I understand how this feels. On the other hand, I had a grandpa die at 62 due to a heart attack and an uncle who died at 45 due to blood clots after gastric bypass surgery. Both of them essentially died early because they didn't take care of themselves, and they were sick for years before they died. So you really don't get to just skip the getting sick part, you just get sick and die a lot sooner.
---
Undead warlock also. With cannibalize and your void walker you are a solo machine.
---
So hyped for this fucking game it's next level
---
That sneaky *Thunderfury - Blessed Blade of the Windseeker* camo!
---
It's just that HD gets better and better, this is what our eyes saw back then and we loved it
---
It has been two weeks since the alpha, which is the usual time for one...
---
...seem appropriate.
---
Inc. dungeon / group finder addon.
---
World pvp skirmishes and "call your friends" is what I look forward to. It's a break in the monotony they leveling can be. It's not for everybody. There will be frustration and triumph. If those aren't your bags, go pve. Nobody really wants to convince you of anything, though.
---
Funny story...in 2006 my friend got me into WoW and I didn't know anything at all about the game.  My first character was a NE Hunter because my friend played Ali.
---
During the day at work, I would spend all day researching pets online and learning everything about them, and discovered that there were Rare pets.  I saw The Rake was level 10 and I knew at level 10 I would be able to tame my first pet and I really wanted it.  
---
As a level 10 NE, I ran all the way to Mulgore and logged out at the spot that the internet said he spawned and I logged in every hour with a /tar macro until I found him and I tamed him.  It was the most fun and coolest adventure I ever had...mostly because at the time I didn't know anything at all about the game.
---
I was around 8 when I started playing. I filled up realms with characters at first because just customising characters was enough for me. I picked classes purely on the armor they got and if it was "pretty", but I finally settled on a Nelf druid. When I finally logged in and got into the swing of it I wore every piece of grey trash armor that dropped if I thought it looked good, and was very proud of my adorable character. When I started getting the red armor set to the right of the screen, I thought it was a good thing like "awesome armor set" or something. I was very, very proud when I got the full red suit!
---
Funny tidbit: I was accepted into a guild in BC. I had the swear filter on. One time I requested help with questing and I said something like "will u cum to this place" and a certain word was blocked out. I was spamming chat with "Why is *** filtered out? What's wrong with that word? I dont get it! ***!" They found it very, very funny. Oooohhhhhh man.
---
My rule of thumb: level 1-60 with default UI (doesn‚Äôt exclude other QoL addons, although I keep it limited to just stuff I need for leveling and dungeons) then at 60 I do a full UI so I can see and do everything I need to.
---
Inner Fire armor boost!
---
Yeah Classic is releasing by the end of summer. If there's a beta it can't be any other time dude
---
50% of the people you recruit now will not be raiding with you.
---
it's still very dumb that you would just delete your characters instead of finding out why they wouldn't shoot anymore.  I mean come on...
---
&gt;Convince me PvP isn't a shitshow
---
You've already made up your mind and are most likely looking for confirmation.  And if not, those who are truly looking forward to Vanilla Wpvp think its the best part of WoW and don't see it as some type of nuisance or obstacle to play around. Your mind set is clearly "why do people think its fun to interrupt my boar killing to pvp" instead of "boar killing is boring, I wish there was pvp to do instead"
---
Wpvp is the destination, not a side show annoyance.  Stick to PvE.
---
Base wireless (if any) is probably hit-or-miss. I ended up leasing my own wireless broadband router from a local vendor. It wasn't great, but good enough to do solo content &amp; some PvP. Raids were more difficult, since they were more bandwidth-intensive.
---
But no gryphons
---
Good, now i‚Äôll be able to play classic just like retail.
---
/s
---
They weren't, it's a sandbox server. They've always been spells, but back then you'd only ever be able to "cast" them through items, just like your hearthstone.
---
As a Woyer, Arcane Intellect is much more appreciated than Stam buffs or anything else. The extra intellect helps weapon skillups which means flat out more dps on average. While leveling this is key.
---
So excuse me if I beg you for an int buff while passing by you but I really do appreciate it &lt;3!
---
Far cry 5, Mortal Kombat 11
---
Good rule and it seems to be what I'm doing now and plan on doing in classic too
---
I'm back again with the same dilemma! Thank you to all the commenters last week, it definitely helped. I'm still stuck between Mage and Priest though!
---
The real thing I am missing is how the gameplay actually feels, since I'm a WoW noob. Any insight on that?
---
-------------
---
**NIGHT ELF PRIEST**
---
PROS
---
 - Night Elf is my favourite race fantasy; flavour, model and casting animations
---
 - Give people heals, buffs - very socially conductive
---
 - Make friends for this
---
 - Shadowmeld/mindcontrol PvP trolling. Shadowmeld and Wisp great for PvP QoL.
---
 - Saber mount is awesome
---
CONS
---
 - Suboptimal race/class combo, but who cares, right?
---
---------------
---
**GNOME MAGE**
---
 - Mage class is my favourite class fantasy
---
 - Give people portals, food and water for tips
---
 - Make friends, better off for gold because of this
---
 - More convenience, faster levelling, good solo class
---
 - Optimal race/class combo
---
 - Great in PvP, high skill ceiling
---
 - Favourite starting zone
---
 - Mechanostrider mount is meh
---
 - Raiding is spam frostbolt
---
You compare dead bugs in food you're eating to sounds made by someone in a youtube video? Really?
---
Either way, /u/wenturi 's comment isn't on anything about the video itself, just the guy. I'm not even trying to criticize him, i'm just pointing out that we all tend to focus on what bothers us more than what we enjoy here (on reddit, classicwow, internet), so the board are all filled with complaints. 
---
There will always be something wrong with everything you see, you will always feel compelled to communicate your annoyance/frustration/disdain. So many people here have gotten to the point where they just bitch about every little thing and so many conversations turn into miserable arguments because don't speak to what they enjoy, only what they dislike. 
---
Funny enough when you try and say "hey, focus on what makes you happy" people literally defend their negativity because they want to be right. I'm not trying to tell anyone what to do, i'm trying to point out that we're often doing something that makes us less happy and we don't accomplish anything anyway.
---
dont think you need convinced or anything. 
---
I've never leveled on a PVP server. Its just not for me. I love pvping, but when I want. I raided hard core in vanilla and quit in 2012 due to real life changes (job/marriage/kids). I'm looking forward to re-subbing for Classic, but dont have the time to spend being ganked. I'd rather level and then PVP when I want to. I played for 7-8yrs on a PVE server and there were many wPVP battles. but for me personally, I dont want to level being ganked. 
---
Some folk love it and they believe its the only way to play wow, and that does sound great. But its not for everyone, hence different types of servers to start on. 
---
Hope you have fun and find what you're looking for.
---
I hate you for saying woyer.
---
huh? diminishing returns were added in [1.4 patch](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0) and for some more spells in 1.10 i believe. 
---
classic will be 1.12 patch.
---
I was a big fan of exploring in MMORPGs from earlier games I had played and on my first Alliance character, shortly after release, I swam from Westfall along the west coast up to Menethil when I was around level10. When I tried to run back I kept dieing because higher level mobs had a huge aggro-range and simply one-shot my character. I didn't know about Ironforge (since I hadn't been there) so I went south from Loch Modan and got stuck somewhere in Badlands and retired the character. I think I spent somewhere around 3-4 hours just trying to get back to Westfall before giving up. 
---
If I had only known about the hearthstone...
---
I mean the balance is the worst. 40 second sheeps and as a warrior good luck doing any damage if you don't get that charge off. Really enjoy pvp but it seems extemely rock papper scissors.
---
No tryhard premade will run with enhancement shaman so you're definitely better off with rogue.
---
Oh yeah. In full BIS, it still ticks for an embarrassingly low amount.
---
I would run around and level my weapon skill, 2h mace if I got a new one, more then often leveling staves.  Maintained it all the way up to weapon skill 200 or so.
---
I was playing a feral Druid.
---
So we've reached this point, huh.
---
&gt; Not a high demand for Rogue?
---
Let's rephrase that: There is a much higher supply of rogues than there is demand.
---
Rogues are the single most overpopulated class. I don't give a rats ass about some polls on some forums...Rogues will be overpupolated again. And you don't bring 8 rogues to a raid, that's just not gonna happen.
---
Did you ever get into raiding with the warlock? Once you get some gear going on the warlock, its a whole different animal. I may have to try a mage also, because it was a hard decision between the two...
---
IIRC, it was supposed to be a high-level questing zone but the layout made travel such a nightmare that they scrapped the quest lines there so there are just a few random quests that send you there and I think a couple of quests in the zone itself, but not much.
---
I can admit I've never once leveled in the badlands, burning steeps, or searing gorge.
---
Not a big fan of leveling in winterfall, either. Much preferred EPL/WPL.
---

---
Warrior was definitely the most populated class in vanilla but I get what you‚Äôre saying. They‚Äôre still very good at solo content and you won‚Äôt have a problem finding a group for dungeons.
---
No. You made up your mind and look for either confirmation or confrontation. I know you are wrong, if you think otherwise, knock yourself out, not my problem.
---
There are no 40 seconds sheeps in the 1.12 version of the game.
---
There are diminishing returns and when you leave combat in pvp those CC's break early.
---
Itemization Post:  WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12. 
---
Alterac Valley Post:  First and foremost, we‚Äôre planning to use the 1.12 version of Alterac Valley. 
---
PvP Post:  The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12. 
---
I have yet to read anything from Blizzard that they changing anything in their database. It seems like they are willing to disable things like content, loot tables, or quests, but nothing about modifying their database to accommodate some niche. You can plan for Lupos all you want, but don't be surprised when they do the minimum required (AKA, minimal deviation from 1.12).
---
Warrior was definitely the most popular class in vanilla but I get what you‚Äôre saying. Rogue will be up there. They‚Äôre still good at solo play and you‚Äôll still be able to find groups as a rogue
---
Congratulations, you just proved his point.
---
You are not looking for a discussion, you are looking for confirmation. You will repeat the same pseudo-arguments over and over. So why should we waste time "convincing" you? PLay on a PvE or don't play at all if you don't like PvP servers, it's no skinn off our backs.
---
i would never even consider playing on a PvE server. im no a huge PvP'er but its something in the game that i would not want to live without, being ganked over and over is a little crappy, but it makes all the times where you gank or all the times you win a fight that much better! i would suggest you give it a try!

Rift was like playing an MMO with ADHD. You'd go to do some quests and oh wait..... there's a rift. By the time you were done, another rift opened, and another...... aaaand another. It was really hard to do other things because my attention was so often on those rifts. Even if i was on the other side of the map..... I knew..... deep in my bones...... that there were rifts to close.
---
Fun game.
---
Yeah or maybe an expression of exasperation
---
No one wanted to see it. We were afrait of seeing it.
---
Its not. PvP in vanilla skill (and gear) mattered a whole lot more than class matchups. 
---
Hence why many PvP die hards still did PvE content.  To reap the powerful PvE rewards to kill other players with.
---
Its a very different mentality than what you have.
---
Been messing around on a WOTLK pserver. Mostly just getting used to a new keybind setup I wanna use and felt like being super OP with heirloom items with crusader on them and what not.
---
I've got my old videos, I still love them.  My guild's 1st take down of Geddon when we were all dead, but a 'lock ressed herself and between her and her doomwalker managed to get the last 30ish HP.
---
Teamspeak was overloading as we yelled support for her.
---
Picture this lovely scene:
---
13 year old me is in a relatively decent guild that clears Molten Core/ZG regularly as well as a little bit of BWL.
---
I PUG an Onyxia's Lair run as a fury warrior main.   We down Ony on the first attempt and there it is.....Viskag the Bloodletter.   Everyone goes ":O", we did loot with a /roll.  I used to wait till most people rolled to do my roll as if the WoW gods would bless me with that sweet high number.   I drop the roll, get a 99..win Viskag.   How happy I was to win that weapon was indescribable.
---
Fast forward three weeks.   I DE it for a Void Crystal to sell on the AH for repair money.
---
RIP
---
As Druid, I have always leveled as feral cat for faster leveling and switched to Resto about the time I wanted to start farming pre-BiS, which is usually about the time groups will let me heal for BRD. On some servers, people don't want to take you unless you are close to 60 though, which is pretty ridiculous for a 54ish dungeon.
---
Make sure you are banking some healing gear so you are ready to heal when you decide to make the switch.
---
If you have to wait a few levels, feral is faster to level anyway, and high level quests are a good source of gold.
---
I started a warrior alt a while ago, and it was sooooo nice to be able to funnel gear and weapons into him from my main. Warriors are very gear dependent.
---
**Everything** was a hunter weapon, from what I remember.
---
&gt;MY CLOSURE THAT I NEED

Here you go.  
---
You may now thank me :-)
---
Ruins the game for a warrior or hunter? Lol what? Good hunters wreck in PVP. Warriors with a pocket healer are a *nightmare*.
---
fischerman\*
---
&gt; and not have to compete for raid spots
---
If you're going horde then roll a shaman. Raids fucking love Shamans.
---
oh, thanks.
---
A good mage will mop the floor of the most skilled warrior.
---
Star Wars Dark Forces for DOS was an amazing game.
---
If you‚Äôre focused on the ‚Äúsolo completion‚Äù aspect I would go hunter. If you think you‚Äôre going to spend more time with groups(even just 5mans) I would choose shaman; you can still run DPS for solo content but can find groups easier with healing/totems.
---
And the odd enemy mage will sheep you to give you free health Regen &lt;3
---
These little photo edits are great. Wouldn‚Äôt mind a temporary rise in these since I think we‚Äôre all on the brink of going insane on this sub.
---
In a 1v1 duel, sure. 
---
Wpvp is not fair, and its almost never a "clean" 1v1.
---
While I look forward to Classic for nostalgia reasons I think that people are going to get bored with playing the same thing without any updates before long.
---
Obviously I meant running the entire way, duh.

My best friend back in vanilla ground out the Frostsaber - about 1-2 hours every single day for a couple of months.  She was hardcore, lovely lass too, I still miss her.
---
Which faction and race would people suggest for a **Mage** that is looking to do some semi-serious PvP and PvE?   
---
Alliance have to face annoying Shamans in PvP, but they do have the general PvP and PvE advantage of having Paladins by their side. Hmm..
---
Hunter or warlock are good options, but so would a mage or rogue/druid. Any class you play well and come prepared for a raid with will get you into one. Sorry I didnt narrow it down for you. 
---
The stealth classes can access a lot of things that others cannot. Druid specifically can fill tank, heal, and dps roles on the level you're aiming for, and have a great pvp mechanic that takes a lot of skill to play well.
---
Sure, but I wasn't that old, I had no idea how to find the information in a language I could read. And it's not a level 30+ we are talking about, more like 6 or 7.
---
And isn't this thread about stupid thing we did as a new player?
---
https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_dark_forces
---
I am so happy you reminded me of this game
---
You are still doing it lol, and hunters don't have problems with mages like you propose, ive killed mages on my warrior good and bad.
---
Yes. It seems like it might be a stretch, but the way I could see a link would be using phooey as an expression of disgust. I think using it as an expression of disapproval is apt. I'm not sure if disgust fits.

Yes 1.13.2 !!!

PvP is a shitshow.  Play Druid and stealth to avoid fights, be immune to sap and poly, usually blind etc.  Break out of almost all CC instantly.
---
If you lack patience and creativity then you'll never be able to find the fun in it.
---
I actually just resubbed this month, jic it made a difference for a beta invite.  /shrug
---
No kidding. I just did this and am cringing at myself so bad lol
---
Haha yes,
---
So in conclusion PvP *is* a shitshow of the best kind.  And those who truly enjoy it just do.  Those who need convincing should stick to PvE.
---
&gt;Warrior was definitely the most popular class in vanilla
---
Not at 60 he wasn't. The vast majority of warriors gave up before getting to lvl 40.
---
&gt;They‚Äôre still good at solo play and you‚Äôll still be able to find groups as a rogue
---
Groups yes. Raidspots no.
---
It is true that with some gear you are a whole other animal, but just about every class sucks without gear..
---
it doesn't scale and also has a low base damage, you will only use for kiting and pvp
---
Most of these guilds are coming off private servers...
---
Yeah we have about 99 people in disord right now for our classic guild but we're only expecting a 30-35% retainability on those. Classic is still a a couple / few months out and you never know what will happen. Also not sure how many of those 99 will actually level to 60 within a reasonable time frame.   
---
We will recruit up until the day classic launches allowing everyone in and stop on launch day. If we end up having enough for 2 raids I'll get myself 4 or 5 more officers and have them make a second group within the guild.
---
Hehe, it's not *that* bad. I got most of mine done in two months while playing a lot less than 12 hours a day.
---
Well, if you grind for it 2-3 hours a day then you should get it in 3 months or so. But the big drawback is that you won't be able to do anything else in wow then :/
---
What I want is [Immersion](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/immersion) as I plan on playing WoW in VR this will be necesary along with the mod MoveAnything!

This is my life in a nutshell with my wife? But unfortunately I've gotten to the point where she says, "Why do you even ask, you're gonna do what you want to do anyways." Pertaining of course to Saturdays, September - January when the living room TV will only be showing college football.
---
Honestly there's a couple levels worth of quests there. There's the dude up in the tower, and some longer quest chains from UC where you go down to the naga area and collect a bunch of items and samples. Plus general mob slaying quests on the hippogryphs, and a hunter class quest.
---
Not sure about alliance though.
---
Maybe if you were writing full sentences, people would understand you. Besides, on non potato computers, the video plays fine.
---
Pre-made beta characters often have access to a large amount of mounts in the game, for instance during BfA's beta my pre-made had access to Ashes of Al'ar, which I do not have on live.
---
Time to change that reddit flair and come back home brother.
---
Luna Unit Frames is a God tier classic addon. I really hope it gets implemented into Blizzard Classic
---
They've been able to do that before. They could measure the amount of people running StarCraft Broodwar and regular StarCraft. Also D2 &amp; D2LoD. Both those games had people online in different states of a single game.
---
Rank 14 is best suited for classes that actually benefit from using a melee weapon, so caster are out!
---
Enhance Shaman, Warrior, Paladin, Rouge and Hunter all benefit quite a bit from those weapons. However, Rogue and Warrior benefit the most.
---
Enhance and Paladin could probably get The Hand of Rag much easier, and there are alternatives for Hunters.
---
So Rogue and Warrior I'd say if you are truly dedicated to getting R14.
---
Yes I agree with you on all your points. However I was talking specifically about rank 14. Yes the caster sets are often better. Thats why you see alot of mages and shadow priest going for rank 13 istead of rank 14.   
---
If a rogue or warrior were to embark on the ranking adventure, it would be silly to stop at rank 13, while it makes way more sense for a lot of the casters to stop at that point. I would argue a rank 13 caster could get the staff from Nefarian and be just as good as a rank 14 rogue.
---
I'm a big proponent of Priest, so I have a little bias there.
---
That said, if you don't want to heal or have to work harder to be the 1 Shadow in a raid, go mage if you want to raid. That said, healing as Priest in Classic will be really fun and rewarding, they have a great toolkit and almost every healing spell you could possibly want. Shadow is awesome to level (and play otherwise, but can struggle with mana/finding a raid spot), and Mind Control is actually one of the top 5 reasons I landed on Priest as my main. Shadowform is awesome if you care what your character looks like, you can get rid of a little of the "rainbow hobo" look.
---
I also have never been able to 'get into' Mage. It never felt right for me, but it has some of the most fun spells. Polymorph alone is phenomenal and will make you love the class.
---
Gnomes are fugly though, but you get to have pink hair, so it kinda balances out.
---
I want to play a Paladin and be a support class by tanking dungeons but dps outside. How gear dependant are both activities? Can I tank dungeons and dps outside of them good enough? What about skills / talents?
---
Gnome warlock with a Comb over. Evil has no hair line!
---
16hr/d x minimum of 12 weeks straight.
---
This ain't your retail level guaranteed grind.  If you slip up for a week the setbacks are tremendous.  There was a reason account sharing was so rampant.
---
MrGM I hope you weren't thinking about using similar titles to other videos again :(
---
lol i love these
---
Play both. Main one and alt one?
---
If your intentions are to attain Rank 14 by playing solo, you should really reevaluate yourself. Its not possible without a pvp group.
---
I don't see how hunter is harder to master than mage, rogue, warlock, warrior.
---
Because there is currently not a single good MMORPG out there. 
---
WoW killed them all, while turning into a Barbie-Game over the years. Cosmetics above all else, other players don't matter, just you and your Malibu-Barbie riding on a blue fox.
---
Don't get me wrong, retail is a good game for those who like playing with dolls, but this is not my idea of an MMORPG.
---
That's not how items work on an emulated server. Because all they would have is the client, the game you can play, all the server side data would be emulated on a guess.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to not be invited and watch everyone else :(
---
Kind of a dick move to insult people for talking about noob things they did in a thread that's supposed to be about funny noob mistakes.
---
Unless you were too dumb to read the title of the post?
---
Anyone remember rakishi and Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit and chris jerricho tripple H the undertaker and everybody. I stopped watching wwe after Eddie Guerrero died, it wasnt the same.
---
It was streamed live on Twitch.
---
Combover gnomes ain‚Äôt no joke.
---
Even with rogues, at most you need 1 or two for node defense or stealth capping.
---
Ele/resto shaman is what is usually demanded the most for horde to counter paladin buffs/blessings.  And even then, Ele is a caster which doesn't benefit nearly as much from R14 weapons when you could realistically just go for the Hand of Nefarian instead for more spell damage.
---
OP really needs to reevaluate his position, as he doesn't seem to really understand the task at hand.
---
Well yeah, and I'll be on a PvP server and probably many others will be after it :/. That's why I think it's just better to think in years...
---
I really enjoy the Ask Kevin parts. Thanks for your great work!
---
Remember gold dust ?
---
Mage rotation is literally frostbolt spam.
---
Lock rot is literally Shadow Bolt.
---
Hunter has the most complex rot in the game and also has to manage a pet.
---
Oh okay I didn't know that. I saw the sheep pop early but I thought maybe I got dispelled.
---
Tinder, cant seem to get past the first level.
---
StarCraft &amp; Diablo have both offered Blizzard the opportunity to measure player engagement in different states of a single game.
---
English equivalent is more like a disgusted "yuck".
---
When you have literally no idea what you're doing and take over 9,000 steps back lol.
---
Rock, paper, scissors. Finally. Classes won't be homogenized messes so everyone can get a trophy.
---
Warrior kills Warlock. Warlock kills Mage. Mage kills Warrior.
---
See how this works?
---
Aside from not understanding how diminishing returns work or how patches prevented 40 second sheeps, you've got a lot to learn about the rock, paper, scissors design to classes. Sure. Some class specs aren't very viable in PvP, but there's a lot more flavor going on with RPS design.
---
If you want homogenization where everyone gets everything then go play retail. Not gonna fault you for that if you like it better.
---
Semi-related since it‚Äôs an in-game item but please share some info about South Dakota cornbread
---
Bit of an unfair comparison as most of those quests are duplicates, which will obviously favour Warlocks more as there are 4 races that can be Warlocks vs. Only 2 that can be druids
---
Stancedancing is borderline impossible. You're being an elitist scumbag that's trying to keep down the casuals. 
---
&gt;/cast battle stance
---
&gt;/cast charge
---
Translation: 
---
&gt;Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, i got downvoted for posting the same spam thats been posted a million times before, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
---
No they aren't.
---
Blizzard said they ARE progressing availability of quests and items added later.
---
The ONLY thing about 1.12 is that items, mechanics and quests that DO exist in the current phase will be in their 1.12 forms.
---
For ST that means, the statue quest, find the temple, kill the witch doctor, the Avatar chain, and getting the chained essence of Eranikus.
---
Class quests weren't added until starting in 1.6. They most likely will NOT be available until phase 3. 
---
Riventusk wasn't added until 1.5. It may not be in till phase 2.
---
 &gt;One of the things I have always regeted in my life was not getting rank 14.
---
Ironically, one of the things you are going to regret in life, will be getting Rank 14 :-)
---
Thought we were in favour of reposts. NO CHANGES
---
I see, thanks for the answer.
---
I love the Pserver Boi‚Äôs cranking out downvotes, Holy spec priests are one of the hardest classes for Rogues to deal with because rogues don‚Äôt do patience. They want to blow cd‚Äôs and kill shit bit with priests it‚Äôs about the long game.
---
how do you kill that which has no life
---
Additional info, 850W thermal take power source and water-cooling, overclock to 4ghz built in option.
---
Well...  
---
1. My bff wanted to be a tauren shaman for the power but I wanted to be a night elf hunter for the glow-up, so we rock/paper/scissors to see which faction we'll go. I won. Still look back on 21 year old me and sigh. He rolled a dwarf hunter named Bobmarleyy, promptly made his way to Auberdine &amp; spent almost all of his time until he maxed it out fishing, smoking and listening to reggae (lol).
---
2. Another friend of ours wanted to be a pally since they got a free mount. Bff would point out to pally friend every now and then that he had made and was playing a priest a couple of times. Pally friend wouldn't listen to him because he thought bff was just being a dick &amp; trying to put him off. Friend hits lvl 40, is confused the guy won't give him the quest. We finally convince him to log out to the character screen.  
---
BFF: What did you want to play?   
---
Pally: Pally  
---
BFF: and what does that say?  
---
Pally: ...(quiet voice) Priest  
---
Pally friend also had his name nerfed around the same time from Ifupaymegold to something random like Dandaraka. He was so embarrassed he rerolled to a random RP server and switched classes.
---
3. Friend who eventually became our Druid officer/tank managed to level to around 40 strictly melee'ing stuff with his staff that he'd proudly got beast-slaying on. He might have even got to 60 that way if I hadn't noticed when I came over to help him out with his quests *in the barrens*.
---
4. One of our guildies tricked another guildie into doing the alt+f4 thing &amp; the guy that fell for it was so mad he /gquit and told the first guy to get cancer, which made me lol because it was the first time I'd ever heard the insult.
---
5. Having to compensate another guild because our guild member ninja'ed a run he was on and his defence was "Oh come onnnn man, you can't expect me not to roll on that, it looks fucking **SWEET**!" - Can't remember what he rolled on but he was a mage and it wasn't a mage item.
---
6. Having to explain to guild members why we don't just need roll on everything and why people hate them for doing it.
---
7. Me getting finkle's skinner but not being high enough level to skin the beast (RIP hide).
---
8. Dying of laughter as our guildies tried to convince our warlock officer to bs his way out of a name change by pretending to be Mexican and claiming racial discrimination (Nol Ube).
---
9. WarriorGuildie: Can I come to MC?  
---
Me: Are you attuned?  
---
WarriorGuildie: Uhh, I think so  
---
Me: Well you either are or you aren't  
---
Him: Yeah, yeah I am  
---
Me: Okay, cool bro come on down  
---
Him: \*Joins the raid, comes down, jumps through the window, falls and dies\*
---
10. Female ex-Guildie: Can I have \[item\] please?  
---
Me: Sorry, \[name\] already asked for it. I'll save the next one for you  
---
Female ex-Guildie: \*Passive-aggressively insinuates I'm biased and have a small penis\*  
---
Me: /gkick
---
For the first month I didn‚Äôt know what an action bar was; I kept the spellbook open (took up half the screen) and clicked each attack.
---
I didn't join BGs for some time because I thought the enemy could loot my items on death.
---
Orc shaman vs Night Elf druid.   
---
I like both class fantasies and being self sufficient with heals and durability during questing. 
---
**Orc Shaman**
---
*Pros*
---
* Cool battlemage class with enhancement. 
---
* Faction unique
---
* Can show off gear more than a druid
---
* I like the idea of totems giving more options for different situations
---
*Cons*
---
* No stealth
---
* Can't tank, only heal or dps, making finding groups for dungeons harder. (Is this true, can they really not tank early dungeons? They have a lot of tanking talents)
---
**Night Elf Druid**
---
* Can fill all roles in dungeons
---
* Cool class fantasy of shapeshifting 
---
* Battlerez and mark of the wild
---
* Jack of all trades class that can do everything decently
---
* Can't see gear most of the time (in shapeshift)
---
* Alliance
---
Not going to be Min/Maxing and maybe not even doing all end game raids. just trying to play pretty casually. Honestly I'll probably just end up making both eventually
---
If mean if you're just looking for 1080p60 you may just need a mid-range graphics card upgrade.
---
Maybe snag more RAM as DDR3 of that speed is pretty cheap these days.
---
The group quests in WPL/EPL have some really good quest rewards iirc, I know a wand is almost a req for being a caster in a chomag fight.
---
I was going to level as hemo/coldblood. I have seen on YouTube people say to roll combat for sweeping strikes etc. For faster mob farming. I am not sure of what to do though.
---
Looks like there isnt a FP there for Alliance, but there is for Horde.  Theres probably 'easier' places to get to for questing at that point for Alliance players.
---
On a pvp server especially, i could see how having a horde hub there and not an Alliance one could definitely make it a more horde centric zone.
---
I have not heard that word used in 12 years! BEWARE THE HUNTARD, THEY ARE PLENTIFUL AND DANGEROUS!
---
**What does ‚ÄúpfUI‚Äù stand for?**  
---
The term ‚Äú*pfui!*‚Äù is german and simply stands for ‚Äú*pooh!*‚Äù, because I‚Äôm not a big fan of creating configuration UI‚Äôs, especially not via the Wow-API (you might have noticed that in ShaguUI). 
---
 [https://shagu.org/pfUI/](https://shagu.org/pfUI/)
---
I'm not sure why you're so skeptical of this, this is a pretty well known strat to make gold on private servers. Even months after server launch you can still find the recipes for things like transmute arcanite going for double it's vendor price. If you can get a stockpile of those recipes early on in the sever lifespan (when they're most valuable) it will definitely make you gold. If there's only 1 recipe available for something available once every hour or 2 or whatever, and there's hundreds of players who need it, there's a demand.
---
I started playing around 2005 on a Dwarf Paladin, I was around 10 years old at the time. I had a just scatter shot spec that I would increase things depending on what I needed in that given scenario and not think about actually leveling down in the spec trees because I was in the mindset of "Oh hey that gives strength, that's cool". I didn't have a spec, I was just a paladin with no specialization in anything.
---
That's not the bad thing though, the bad part of it was the fact that I thought questing was a cheating way of leveling up. I called my friend out on it whenever I went to his house, saying "You're questing, you're cheating your way to 60", and I thought I was high and mighty for not questing.
---
Needless to say, my patience must have been god damn amazing for me to level up to 45 with doing maybe a handful of quests as a Paladin in vanilla. I couldn't even imagine doing that now.
---
I'm going to bump my memory up to 16gb from 8gb for Classic.. so I'd suggest the same for you.
---
I'm doing the same, but with a troll mage that used to camp Astranaar back in the day.
---
I used to dread handing in my quests daily because he would always be there lol.
---
I will honour him by making a troll mage with the same name.
---
They either want to rethink their version to make it more like older versions, or (more likely) they're not changing their minds, needed to clear up some sticky space for future blue posts, and removed it so the discussion gets lost and buried.
---
I‚Äôve been developing this tactic for about 10 years, as I foresaw classic coming. It‚Äôs been difficult,  but I‚Äôve just remained single. Who‚Äôs the smart one now? Mwahahaha
---
Plenty of ESL folks play WoW. There are countless stories of non-understanding out there I bet.
---
Horde have druids top (taurens)
---
LMAO. 
---
Thats how my wife is when I ask her about buying new stream or PC equipment.
---
Obviously I mean in terms of pvp. Pve is pretty straightforward for all classes.
---
You overestimate SL. It‚Äòs a shitty spec for BGs because you lack dmg, I wouldn‚Äòt spec SL before at least bwl/aq40 gear. Furthermore, any skilled rogue with ZG trinket/tea will stun/cc lock, and burst you down. 
---
Source: Played BiS rogue and dueled a lot of BiS warlocks. If the rogue reacts to your trinket out of kidney you have lost.
---
If not casual. A bear can also manage early MC /early BWL, but most competitive guild wouldnt look at you unless you heal
---
Paladins are super annoying and efficient at healing in PvP, not to mention fairly bulky, so if you planned on PvPing any fair amount, it might be something considering a bit more.
---
I think you might mean blade flurry? And yeah combat would be faster overall, I'm asking specifically if I'm going sub, if anyone had an opinion on if a sword spec or dagger spec would be better
---
Bags and old cooked stuff after my professions/level have moved on
---
I like completing the maps, so I visited everywhere that triggered a map fill in but as an alliance player I didn't stay long in Horde zones.
---
&gt;What are your tactics on not completely pissing your wife off?
---
Starting in a different Zone than her, so we don't compete for quest mobs in early leveling :P
---
Ouch! I feel for you. A friend did the same, also an ESOL.

Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. *memespecs* are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.

**If you're interested please contact me on Discord [Howaito#3139] or join [OUR DISCORD](https://discord.gg/ZSsSz7E) so we can get to know each other until Classic release!**
---
**In any case, HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER! :)**
---
I'm going priest. I love healing and shadow is great in PvP.
---
It is more than that. It carries information of something that carries information but on top of that it also structurally resembles that thing. So it is a memefractal.
---
I*d say female nelf hunter (good looking/nice animations/shadowmeld and cat pet ambush)
---
If you're trying to level with proper leveling routes you don't really put yourself that far behind not getting your mount at 40. You really should be grinding from place to place and mounting around from quest to quest isn't as efficient as grinding to questing spots and back to questing hubs. Mounts really only save time in certain situations where you maybe have to run through underleveled zones.
---
I played warlock, druid, and rogue more than anything else in Vanilla. It's way more difficult now, lol. You had more abilities then, but you never touched most of them as they were next to useless.
---
I'm not sure my mb can handle 16.  This is the PC I bought because, I was pissed off at the lag I'd have on sindragosa.
---
Madseason is the best &lt;3
---
Most people won't want to group with a Prot Pally due to their lack of aggro retention/defensive CDs. Their buffs are extremely beneficial and they're possibly the best heals. Everyone will expect you to heal in any group activity. That's not to say you can't live your dreams, though. Best of luck.
---
If every video on YouTube was original there would be like 18 people to sub to.
---
Would it be choppy or clunky?
---
Actually keeping autoattack in your bar is pretty important. You can conveniently "hide" it away and access it via macros. But in essence you want to have some sort of control outside of your mouse over auto attacking!
---
Google:
---
"bae: a person's boyfriend or girlfriend (often as a form of address)."
---
You just sold me on Horde, dawg.
---
I‚Äôve always seen hemo as being more gear reliant. For leveling I believe you can‚Äôt go wrong with ambush/backstab.
---
It's not the content it the titles almost being the exact same. I youtubed classic wow and first 3 videos back to back
---
You leave MadSeason out of this
---
My fav class is shaman(enh) but recent play of all classes in vanilla has gotten me disposed towards lock and rogue, which were the two least played by me in retail BC-WoD. Vanilla is a different animal for sure.  
---
I'll likely flip a coin between lock and rogue, quickly level to 60 and funnel gear and funds to a shaman for easier leveling.  
---
I understand lock is by far the easiest leveling but worry about seeing way too many clothies on the way up and having to battle for dungeon spots and gear. Perhaps taking enchanting will net me some perks to join groups?  
---
I'm so apprehensive lol.
---
Look at it this way: how many news shows televise the same news, and get different viewers? The content is the same, presentation style is different.
---
Im playing that new game Forager. That was on my radar for a long time and its loads of fun. Also a lot if MTG Arena. Did some 20 twinking for a bit. Thats about as much wow as i want to play until classic. I dont want to ruin the experience but i also dont want to give blizzard any money at all.
---
&gt;that is really dumb especially considering that **it tells you in the middle of the screen in red letters** that you have to equip ammo
---
The thread's title in big, bold letters:
---
&gt;**Share some of your worst ‚Äúnoob‚Äù moments from vanilla!**
---
Your conclusion btw:
---
&gt;Too dumb to read eh?
---
They are also making money with subscriptions.
---
I like his format and no selfie cam antics. Pretty much him Frost and countdown to classic are really well put together and aren't reading a post to me.
---
I only recently discovered they removed "stances" from  retail seeing as I haven't played a Warrior in forever. Getting rid of Class identity feels bad.
---
Having the tank as the master you mean? I realized that having melee slaves was no ideal because they would (quite often) run past the mob and just keep going.
---
To get around this, I would spam the attack hotkey which made the DKs look like a spawn of piranhas.
---
When I five box again, which clearly this sub is not a fan of due to the downvotes, I am definitely going to have 4 ranged slaves and tank with the master.
---
You're thinking about gnomes. Otherwise the Alliance is pretty alright.
---
I like him :) as you can see he was first in the chain
---
nymfo af. wont even let me play more than 1-2 hour straight XD
---
Some of us are not men?
---
Can somebody tell me what the one remaining class is for Kevin Jordan to discuss? I've lost track at this point
---
There's no abusing power word shield though. You get a debuff that has quite a long 15s CD (in PVP 15s is an eternity).
---
&gt; Draws on the soul of the party member to shield them,  absorbing 942 damage.  Lasts 30 sec.  While the shield holds,  spellcasting will not be interrupted by damage.  **Once shielded, the  target cannot be shielded again for 15 sec.**
---
I recently learned the Joy's of hybrid specs for casual play. My paladin can heal or dps dungeons with his hybrid spec. It gives me more options for groups to join. Paladin DPS is fine in dungeons since they don't really require much.
---
No, im not gonna corpse run to Stocks/RFC as the other faction lol
---
"They're actually listening to the community" - Cucks on this subreddit.
---
Classic is DoA, they're gonna implement anti community shit like 1.12 AV.
---
Depends, give the warrior free action potions and engineering and see what happens!
---
Meh, MadSeason and MrGM are good. Not familiar with Method.
---
This is generous. 50% of the ones you recruit now may not even ever run a dungeon with you.
---
Hard to tell, I used to have that exact chip until 2016 myself.
---
It worked well enough then... but you could see how the new AMD chips coming later this year shake up the market and buy a new build then?
---
We don't even have a date yet, so slow playing any hardware upgrades until needed for the game is in your best interest for performance and $$$.
---
Did you acquire the skill of reading? Yes? Then read my post again:
---
&gt;Is it the most efficient Specc? Hell no.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Will it get you to R14? Hell No.
---
&gt;Is it fun? HELL YES!
---
I am not playing SL because I am a super-hardcore, decked out PvP player. I am playing it because it is FUN. Yes, I will lose to people who dedicate their life to playing a video game. They are welcome to their victory, they earned it after all.
---
I am playing SL because I like it. It's fun, it fit's my class fantasy, and it worked well enough for me at enough occasions.
---
SC2 was delayed
---
Other cancelled games were delayed before being ultimately cancelled
---
That makes everything much easier though. LH is probably out in the same update or prior to class quests being released, thus the helm won't be a desirable option.
---
Druid. It can heal, it can stealth, it can tank. Druids are the best friends for rogues.
---
which video is this from?
---
Just don't get married duh
---
It has been 12 years since I played, but on a pserver I decided to roll Warrior. I saw a warrior wrecking mobs out in the wild with Dual Wield swords and I wanted to know how to get that skill. My guildlies told me you get it at 20 and you learn it from your class trainer in Orgrimarr. I ran with anticipation, so anxious to learn this skill! I had a second level 18 sword ready to go and start killing mobs faster.
---
I go to my Warrior trainer and level up my Arms skill and don't see DW there. I go to Org general chat and Barrens general chat to try and find out why I can't learn DW. Someone sends me to UC Weapons Master to learn it. I go there, learn nothing. I'm super frustrated and my excitement is deflated, I'm almost bitter at this point.
---
For some reason I go back to Orgrimmar class trainer and BY MISTAKE I mouse-wheeled down and learned there were more skills for Fury/Prot down in the list and low and behold see Dual Wield.
---
I wasted about 1 hour trying to figure out how the hell to DW. I wasted even more time tanking in dungeons w/ Taunt/Sunder as my only skills for Prot when I could've had more.
---
Such a n00b!!!
---
Notoriously bad according to who? The Legion questing experience was well-liked by basically everyone I know -- and I never saw people complaining about it.
---
I dont even have sex
---
Only way to win is to not chose and play them all.
---
The Gravestone Scepter (wand) from Blackfathom Deeps quest is a must have for any leveling caster, it's has much higher DPS than any other wand in its level range
---
Lol yeah I was thinking about those while I typed this out. I'm gonna be playin horde this time around so I wont be able to run stockade reliably. If someone is looking for a druid to tank or heal stockade maybe I would dive into it lol
---
For solo levelling backstab would be a pain. Frontstab won't work in classic, as it shouldn't.
---
Loved everything about except it should have been cheesed a little more on graphics for performance. Could have gone with faster cast times too it felt a little slow
---
Reminds me of when I tried to get to SW to play with my friend (I was a NE) by walking, then swimming across the great sea. I got to about azshara (with a few fatigue deaths) before I gave up and figured out the proper way to go.
---
My bad thought it was referencing a different person named george
---
i thought like either a mage or a priest would go well with a rogue but huh ,,, druids, never even considered them \*thinking face\*
---
Sounds good to me.  A buddy at work also told me something about video cards might be dropping in price because of a bit coin mining something or other.   Do you know anything about that?
---
All of them except the 2 on the other side that arent worth it (RFC/WC and VC/Stocks).
---
Frost mage.... there is no escape
---
Yeah, and he writes his script very well. I like his sarcastic jokes and monotone voice :P
---
I miss Hots
---
Yup. Had like two quests last time I played on a p server:
---
- Kills Bird Wyvern Things
---
- Something to do with 4 pools of water in the beaches below
---
- Kill (high?) elves at the camp to the northeast
---
- Steal Furbog's wallet (Rogue Quest)
---
- Talk to dude in tower
---
I like to think I love Aszara but the lack of a proper road really irks me.
---
You can go very wrong with that. You have to open on your target from stealth, slowing you down. You also have to get behind the mob for backstab. The front stabbing bug on private servers may or may not exist in classic.
---
I thanked an NPC in mulgore for killing a wolf for me when I was attacked running on the road
---
I meant with gouge lol
---
Mage isnt great, they pull aggro easily in a no tank situation, and then the rogue is running around like a chicken with his head cut off
---
Thank you for not being a jerk. I want to be on a PvP server but it just seems like more headache for no payoff. I guess the group and profession dynamics really help even the fight!
---
Druid! Or another rogue. 
---
No point having stealth, if your playing partner cant do it also.
---
As I said I was 9 years old during most of Vanilla and I haven't played on private servers. My faint memory of people's opinions on Demo in Vanilla were a lot of people telling me to go Aff or Destro. But 1. 99% of people had no idea what to do back then and 2. I was 9 years old at the time and might not remember correctly. I barely spoke english at the time aswell.
---
Well graphics cards jumped in price because of high demand of people building bitcoin rigs.  But with the bitcoin craze kind of slowing, it's possible that graphics cards may come down in price.
---
The only thing to do in Deadwind Pass is walk up to Karazhan and go: 
---
***"Damn, this place is actually fully here in Vanilla."***
---
Then roam around looking for anything else to do and eventually Hearth in disappointment.
---
Y'all are wild lol
---
Not every dungeon, but I will sacrifice leveling time to have a good old visit to Wailing Caverns and BFD no doubt.
---
Oh and SM. I loooooove SM, and no horde scum will prevent me from getting dat Whitemane Ass :D
---
[Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/63LBWcL.png).
---
Shimmering Flats was good but I've only ever quested in the needles part once. I'll definitely need to go back.
---
Short answer : no
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
I think 90% of the people I do dungeons with will I be raiding with I think. Its the leveling that will cut down the amount of members.
---
I believe it the compression and reuploads ruining videos and pictures
---
I'd wager it can handle 16gb if it's an i7 processor.. but if you bought it pre-assembled then maybe not.  Your PC seems like it should play WoW Classic fine.  Maybe run some tests on a private server.
---
is druid as a class pretty easy ?
---
I was 9 or 10 when I first playedand had no idea what I was doing. I played a night elf hunter. My uncle asked me why I was still running deadlines at lvl 30. He also gifted me 10g and I spent it all on "cool" looking gear at the AH that matched color scheme and I'm pretty sure was all cloth with spirit/intellect...
---
Yea and that's what my main is on retail. So i'm looking forward to druid again as nostalgia but would also do something a little different by making it alliance.
---
SM is a must! I hope people are excited enough for low level dungeons so that groups are easy to find
---
Yeah I‚Äôll probably do all of them except ones in enemy faction capital cities. They‚Äôre a ton of fun and not as much of a hassle as some here imply. I‚Äôm not in a rush to 60; leveling is half the fun of vanilla WoW.
---
I was surprised when I found an Alliance flight path in Stonetalon Mountains peak.
---
You can tank, and it will get significantly easier when you have consecration and improved righteous fury. That will put you at lvl 33 before you have those talents. Just remember to down rank consecration as needed too so you arent drinking after every pull. 
---
Now leveling as prot will suck before reckoning just to warn you. Pallys cant really tank as ret like wars can tank as fury. So you cant go a deep ret build and expect to hold agro or survive. You can however go a deep ret build and heal every dungeon while leveling. So something to consider there.
---
yeah but we won't know for sure exactly which phases they're rolling stuff out in. They've said it should be roughly the same as what patch the phase covers that it was added in, but some of the messier stuff like level 50 class quests could end up in any phase between 3 and 6 depending on how they decided to do it.
---
Only 2 classes had class quests in phase 3, so maybe they hold it back for 4 or even 5.
---
OR...they could I suppose roll them out by the phase they came out in, but that's probably gonna annoy a lot of people that this class or that got these OP items they could get at level 50 for a relatively easy quest, and you won't be able to get yours until the last phase.
---
But even that is technically correct...so they could do it that way.
---
I played a rogue in tbc, I would have been around 11 at the time. I would always target mobs with T, not realising that this triggers auto attack. So as a rogue, I would sneak up behind my target in stealth and start auto attacking them. This caused many unhappy dungeon groups who just wanted a rogue that could sap for them. I remember finally figuring it all out in Zul'Farrak
---
Good to see the Alliance will be working for the Horde now.
---
Low efffort karma farmer, I have something for you. It's an updoot!
---
That was actually really clever. Not generic at all, very high effort meme imo.
---
Ah ok.  He was talking to me as if I knew what he meant and I figure unless I'm giving advice, it's ok for people to think I know more than I do.  
---
You very succinctly put it in a way I can get.
---
I meant like will they even make it to deadmines.
---
Everyone should play either tank or healer. Vanilla with a lack of dps would be funny.
---
i used to think you could only eat or drink at the same time. didnt realise you could do both for a couple weeks
---
Glad to hear from a like minded person. What do you plan on leveling as? Why should I invite you to my group?
---
Could be something, could be nothing. The old beta build didn't have some values set correctly making it unable to download relevant client files without using a specialized launcher/3rd party tool. The new client still encounters the same error, but it... looks different. I wouldn't read too much into it just yet, personally.
---
I'd say the sharing of leather armor is the only drawback to druids as a partner for a rogue.
---
Thanks for making this! Our communities have really been enjoying it. :) Any idea why certain abilities don't work? For example, we can't call !ability Blessing of Wisdom or !ability Mass Dispel
---
Yeah, you can find used RX470 4gb cards for like $65 on eBay, I snagged one myself.
---
And what do you do with that "Karma"?
---
Finally quested in Winterfall last summer on a p server.
---
I was excited to indulge in the environment. But the truth is, those last few levels you don't even give a fuck anymore and just want to ding 60. Winterfall is damn huge and my mindset was "Just tell me where to go so I can get the fuck outta here."
---
And if you weren't leveling or farming the furbogs on the mountain, you were farming Thorium nodes.
---
I thought i could be a battle mage so i would only use insta cast spells and melee people with my staff.....I did this for 23 lvls
---
We have to go deeper!
---
As long as I can use finalfantasylization I'll be happy
---
...sigh...yup...
---
The developers at ******* **** don't do this shit, btw. 
---
*Had to repost this because of retarded subreddit rules.
---
There‚Äôs no reason any addon that supported 7.3.5s client wouldn‚Äôt work
---
wrong. rogues and mages are going to be running rampant with warlock right behind...
---
For real.  Subscriber count increased and suddenly we are flooded with memes.  I'm not a fan, but obviously lots of people like them.
---
Right. I'm not gonna try to force a stockade run. I'm just really looking forward to Gnomeragen, deadmines, wailing caverns, and Scarlet Monestary. Those dungeons just seem so big and like an adventure to complete. With a dedicated and decent group they were like half the fun on leveling
---
You‚Äôre in a thread about worst noob moments. Durrrrrr. You must be new to reading. Durrrrrr.
---
Experimenting on a pserver, I was pretty set on Paladin. Reading through what people say here about how boring the rotation is, how bad they are at everything but healing, I can‚Äôt see why I would ever continue down this road. 
---
What are the redeeming parts of paladin?
---
I love horde for the challenge, but stocks is one of my faves so it‚Äôs a bit sad
---
I figured you were morbidly obese. It's a fairly safe assumption based on your attitude. 
---
I understand removing toxic people from your life but the reason I decided to comment is because there are young/impressionable people on reddit and attempting to justify/glamorize wasting away playing games until your heart gives out is unacceptable.
---
I won't get into the weeds talking about how I've never had to diet/no longer worry about money/no longer worry about finding the right partner/don't need to worry about who's going to take care of me when I'm on my deathbed. 
---
Those are real issues wether you ignore them or not. Even if your 100yrs-10% 50yrs-90% wasn't completely misjudged, your last 5 years will be a literal nightmare. 
---
Nothing worth having comes easy. And I'll still be playing classic.
---
We can go deeper...
---
Answering the question that no one asked.  Im sure I will get downvoted for this, but this whole post is pointless:  if someone is going to be respectful and conscious of their partner, it isnt because you made this post.
---
Im married, and my wife and I have worked out a system that suits us -- you're sitting here arrogant enough to talk down to anyone with an SO as though they're window-licking mouth-breathers who magically tripped and fell ass-backwards into a relationship and have zero idea of how to maintain such an __*unimaginable anomaly*__.  Well thank you for bestowing your secret knowledge to the unenlightened.  We are not worthy of the gifts that you bring.  üôÑ
---
Im sure your post came from a good place, but it's so unbelievably self-righteous and as I mentioned before, incredibly condescending.
---
TL;DR: you're a king of cringe, and you could have pared all of this down to your very final line, and saved me the nausea.
---
Oh, I have to get it running again.   Hard drive died and I just out it in the corner.   But no worries, her name isn't baby.
---
But I'm glad to hear she has hope.  I still have my vanilla wow PC.  I g, imagine if I out that hard drive in and it works.   What?  Windows XP!  What?   Haha
---
I'll probably have to pay someone to out a ssd in for me haha
---
I'm going to post this down here because I know it would be just totally raged at elsewhere, but a lot of the complaints about WoW "getting bad" after Vanilla had little to do with the game and more to do with players' inability to adapt.
---
Resilience and the arena didn't make PvP worse, it made it harder. PvP prior was completely random, and you weren't ever going up against people who were better than you. Dumb broken things about classes were fixed, and there was some attempt at balance in the game (even if it wasn't great at times).
---
If you watch most old PvP videos, it's literally one person 3v1'ing versus people who are keyboard turning and wasting GCDs left and right. You could get away with that in Vanilla. With every expansion, the difficulty got harder across the board and players got better, and some people just couldn't hang.
---
Same with raiding. How many people were in your MC/BWL raids that literally just took up space?
---
Like, either someone saying "Vanilla was harder!" has never played the current game (and hasn't in quite some time) OR they're lying to themselves so they can be smug about how good they are at video games without having to come to terms with the fact that they can't hang with  the new average.
---
maybe just me, but always found those specific interfaces very aesthetically unpleasing
---
This is a much better post than OPs.
---
I predict they will push it back to November and release it on the 15 year anniversary. They will say they are close but just not ready yet, and need a bit more time to finish development.
---
I usually go Silverpine Forest and skim the easier Barrens quests. But I'd like to complete every quest in the starter zones and secondary zones. I may continue this method and just do ALL the quests.
---
This is gonna be a tough one!
---
But that is exactly my reaction.
---
I agree, with a good ambush and ravange they should 2 shot most things
---
I think it tastes great. Regular Redbull is far too sweet.
---
&gt; What are your tactics on not completely pissing your wife off?  
---
I've been playing the long game by completely failing at any relationship I get in to, so now I'm 30 and my ex broke off our 5 year relationship last year. Basically I've been preparing for 9 years for Classic's release.
---
I used it for a few months, needed the real estate once the action bars became littered with buttons.  
---
Its fun at lower levels but youll appreciate the addon later on.
---
I was set on going Alliance for a change, as I was Horde through and through back then.
---
But when I fooled around on this private realm to kill time until Classic launches, I thought to myself "ah, let's check out old Ogrimmar, before Cataclysm changed it".
---
And guess what, now I'm swinging back to Horde again because the city was just so special. The wide open space (compared to the rather confined Stormwind and Ironforge, with all their walls and structures), the bank in the middle, with people standing on top of it - afking, flexing, jumping, the relaxing music under an open nightsky (versus the unnerving drums of Garrosh-Ogrimmar).
---
It's just so so good. It's tragic.
---
This real life.
---
It was fun for around a week. I would definitely go back and play it again if it was my first experience. But I couldn‚Äôt see myself playing that game for too long.
---
&lt;Monstrous Bear Hugs&gt; Horde offpeak-times raiding guild (EU PvP Server)       
---
Fellow Horde, the drums of war thunder in the distance! The call to arms has been issued.  
---
Soon, the time will be upon us once again. A return to where it all began‚Ä¶
---
**Who are we?**  
---
Monstrous Bear Hugs is an upcoming offpeak-times PvE raiding guild for WoW Classic.  
---
In order to foster a wonderful community and enjoy this game once again together, we are starting early recruitment. Our primary focus is pve raiding, but we will also be doing guild world PvP and lots of guild premades for BGs and massacre alliance filth! :)  
---
I, the Guildmaster, am an old-school wow player since the EU open beta,  playing and raiding ever since. However, now married, in my 30s and with  a fulltime job, I cannot quite no-life like in the good old days  (though I do plan to play WoW Classic A LOT), and so I‚Äôve been seeking likeminded people who either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt raid at regular peak times.
---
**How do we raid?**  
---
 We are going to raid outside of the regular raiding hours, such as in the morning, early afternoon, or late at night CET, as well as during  the weekend.  
---
As there is still a long time until Classic comes out, exact times have not yet been decided and will depend on what suits the members the best.  
---
We are not a super hardcore raiding guild. We want to clear all PvE content up to and including Naxxramas, but we do not enforce strict  min-max policies. We do not require you to choose the most optimal spec. The most important is that we raid to have fun together.That said, of course we are raiding to progress through the content, and  so we will aim to use an optimal raid composition when possible. You  can join and raid as, say, a shadow priest if that‚Äôs what you want, but  you will likely have less competition as a healer!  
---
The idea is to raid 2 times per week, 3 hours per raid, at least in the beginning. Depending on member interest, this could be increased later.
---
**How about drops?**  
---
Loot will be handled with open-bid zero-sum DKP with a small regular  decay. We are not going to use Loot Council. We are not going to tell  people they have to pass loot to more overpowered classes. Some common  sense restrictions such as MS &gt; OS and tank priority for Thunderfury will however of course apply.
---
**Who are we looking for?**  
---
As the game hasn‚Äôt been released yet and our numbers are small, anyone  is welcome. Beginners, PvPers and people unable to raid very much are  also very welcome, as the most important is to create a Vanilla WoW  community first and foremost. I‚Äôll be glad to help new people learn and  journey though the game ! üì∑  We will get around to raiding once we are able to. That said, the  target audience is of course especially people who want to eventually  clear all pve raid content in Classic, but would be willing to raid  outside peak hours.
---
In order to keep with the Vanilla spirit, a simple phpBB guild forum  has been set up for our members to hang out. We will also use discord  eventually.  
---
If interested, please have a look at our discord or our forum!

See you in Azeroth :)
---
Damn I hope so. I know I played with a buddy on Xbox live (he was deployed) I was here in murica. He was laggy as shit. I won‚Äôt mind if I can at least just quest/grind.
---
It's less about budget than it is wasting money.  I don't want anything hard core.  60 fps on high settings is the goal.
---
durrrr durrrrr welcome to interwebs moron
---
Ok, all cool. Hope you will have a good journey through Azeroth!
---
Are you talking about those pucks that give you your own wireless network?
---
Dont let that stop you. We can corpse run together lol
---
&gt; Need some help with anything? Bags? Quests? Want a dungeon run? Add me to your friends and I don't mind helping you out with things. I do this all the time, it's not just because you're a girl.  
---
Ahh... the good memories from vanilla.
---
Monster Hunter World. On Xbox gamepass and last I checked it was $1 for 3 months. Fun game with a grind of its own. MHW and Apex will likely keep me entertained for the next month or so.
---
I‚Äôm in the usaf! But navy guys are pretty cool!
---
Guessing either July 16th from the hint, or August 20th (just cuz mid-late August would be what I'd otherwise guess)
---
Alliance &gt; Horde for pve. Blessing of Salv is insane.  
---
Pvp is a bit more equal, maybe slightly horde favored. Undead and Orc have amazing pvp racials.  
---
Human &gt; Gnome for pve. 
---
Gnome &gt; Human for pvp.
---
Troll &gt; Undead for pve.

Undead &gt; Troll for pvp.
---
Well yeah. I was saying they should. Not would.
---
A GTX 1660ti might be your best bang for buck right now.
---
My first character was a human pally.  Because I thought professions were just for flavour,  I went skinning and leather working,  I thought Armor kits were just the absolute best... When I hit Duskwood I was so frightened of pvp that I hid in a cave killing and skinning worgen for about 10 levels. Came out fairly wealthy and even had a blue 2h sword drop. Oh and I was leveling as prot with a 2h... But I figured ret bombing out myself,  so I wasn't completely stupid. 
---
Let it be known,  thst I had my hearth set to Darkshire,  and I was ready to bubble away at a moment's notice. One day,  an undead rogue entered my cave,  and I actually managed to kill him! Me! Warily,  making sure he respawned outside my cave,  I exited with my back to wall,  only to be harassed by an undead warlock. I beat him too!  So confident was I that I headed for Stranglethorn... 
---
It wasn't long before I went straight back to my cave in Duskwood. I bet he's still logged out there to this day
---
Proactive taunting can be quite useful!
---
I do it on pull with tauntable mobs/bosses that need to be positioned correctly, because of knockbacks/aoe and the like and if the mob/boss has any kind of mobility ability just to have that guaraunteed timeframe, in case my autoattacks miss or somebody gets a crit off in the first couple of seconds. Sometimes on trash taunt is all you need to keep it on you until it dies, so you don't need to spend ressources/time to build actual threat.
---
Stop dude. The salt in the air is making my drink taste funny.
---
To play they're not hard. To master as difficult as anything else. Learning every aspect of each part of druid play is a fair amount of stuff to master. But the basics are pretty straight forward.
---
There's a difference between noob...doing something because you didn't know any better, and too dumb to read the warning in the middle of the screen.  Like I said..that's just fucking stupid...not noobish
---
It's good at low levels but it falls out at max.
---
I had such a great time on it last time around. Didn't ever even consider switching until they took away mana and changed the way the class felt.
---
Warrior
---
noob and dumb are too different things....this is just dumb
---
I unsubbed 1 month into Cataclysm...
---
I‚Äôm a grown adult with everything keybound and still have 1 as auto attack

Blizztard is fucking implementing a mount journal.

Fuck #NoChanges, I guess.
---
$300 card for an year old rig seems like a waste no?
---
Just fine for divorce now, before classic comes out. Divorces take up a lot of time. Time that could be spent playing classic.
---
I resubbed the day it was announced. Reconnected with my guild, which is still going. Been raiding mythic since. It is fun, but I am looking forward to Classic.
---
No...noob things not stupid things...you win for stupid though
---
You move the card to your next computer build?
---
Wasn't until I finally saw the loading screen hint that I realized lol
---
Tbh in your analogy I would just get out at 45. Plenty of easy ways to go when the balance tips from comfort to suffering.
---
don't do it
---
Was teamspeak really a thing back then? I thought everyone only used vent
---
As a gay teen girls in wow flocked to me as they knew I wouldnt harass them or make lewd remarks on vent lol.
---
I want the original UI but i'll be using at least move anything to center the health bars
---
NOM NOM NOM I love the tears of the enraged interweb heroes and WoW nerds!!!! lol
---
That's old meta. Now a days almost all good guilds have at least one feral tank.
---
I'm sure I tried something like that with the zone off of pandaren areas when I resubbed, tried to fly there a good few times before realising I had to do a full quest area to open it up.
---
I've always played mages/spell casters on any MMO, but Hunter looks like a lot of fun and seem pretty diverse. Should I play warlock or Hunter? Would I regret rolling a hunter? Thanks!
---
Seems like maybe you should just be a rogue
---
I admit that my experience is limited to Wrath and onwards. Still I would say Wrath and MoP was way more complex than it is now in retail. For a new player PvP against regularly experienced players would be more difficult than it is in BFA. In BFA you have very easily distinguishable oh shit buttons and burst buttons. PvP required a little bit more research before imo.
---
Maybe you rolled Need on Shoulders or something, considering you might not have had any at the time.
---
I'd let them die.
---
You were never able to cast multiple spells at once. You just can't put a spell with a CD at the top as /cast so it goes off when it's up every so many seconds.
---
RP practice!
---
Choosing to go ret is your decision, not inviting you to my group is my decision :)
---
Fair enough. Just not how I'd want to go out
---
Oh hell yes! (Minus the annoying, exceedingly out of the way dungeons.) I'm not going to power level. I'm going to take it slow and enjoy all the sights. And I think I'd have MORE fun if I can get into a guild that isn't filled with veterans and experts. Sucks the fun out of dungeons for me. Taking our time through Gnomeregan - a group of people who had never seen it before - was just too much fun.
---
Here's hoping for some brand new players so we don't try to steamroll every dungeon!
---
ya know, i have a much harder time finding groups on LH as a holy pally than i expected. every lfg post in world chat is looking for a dps or tank.
---
I always thought vent was an American thing. No one really used it in Europe back then, I think. I still haven't used it ever until today.
---
Came up with a cool name based on a real name (not mine or anyone I know, obviously) that both fits the character and can be shortened to 4 letters easily for shorthand/voice chat
---
I learn German and English with games...mostly thank Wow :D
---
Eh, I played Warlock all through Vanilla and I'd say they're one of the safest options out there.  You can beat just about anything 1v1 after the starting zones and you get most of your spells.  Higher level you can even 1v2+ using seduction/fear and dot them all.  People really think twice about 1v1 a warlock in the open world
---
I don't really PC he anymore.  This PC, or the next one I own, will be for classic wow.  Well that and porn and media.
---
Maybe some Minecraft.  But mostly porn besides that.
---
Nice.
---
Even for AQ40 pre-Nax? I thought the gear didnt scale well for them AQ40 pre Nax, just like MC pre BWL
---
Dawg.....? People still say that?
---
1 alliance please
---
I've been talking about it almosy daily since December and filling her in all the news when we get blue posts, even though she has NO interest and was at first super annoyed. Over time though, by doing this I've shown her just how important it is to me and she's responded by talking about WoW in a way where she's trying to build my raid nights into our social schedual
---
Thank you.
---
Hey obviously the laser beams from God is the strongest skill imaginable!
---
&gt; You compare dead bugs in food you're eating to sounds made by someone in a youtube video? Really?       
---
Yes, I feel it is an accurate parallel. They're both content you can consume, with distasteful and undesirable elements incorporated into them that are not readily separable, either physically or psychologically. Only suitable for consumption when there's literally nothing else available.     
---
        
---
When it comes to Classic WoW, we are not exactly in a famine, so we can afford to send content like this back to the kitchen with a complaint. And we should, otherwise it could still keep being made without improvement.      
---
Or at the very least console ourselves by complaining about it to sympathetic ears while those who like bug-food can just keep watching, happy as clams.
---
Go for 1H maces in main hand while leveling if you go Hemo spec.  1H maces are slower and hit harder than most of the other 1H weapons.
---
I always went 1H mace main hand and fast dagger in OH when I leveled my rogues.  
---
I always leveled as Sub as well...and by the way for all the min/maxers that are going to hate and go "no sub is too slow blah blah blah".  My rogues always leveled in 6-8 days played so I personally don't think it's that much slower.
---
Yeah, that's probably more like how it is going to be. Luckily the Horde don't really have much reason to go there other than Timbermaw Hold rep, so they will likely almost always be outnumbered.
---
Go female dwarf and have both?
---
I tanked Gnomeragan on my paladin one time. It was my first time through the whole instance as well as many of the party members. It was long and hard and we barely made it through. But it was one of the most fun instances I have every run.
---
This is completely unrelated to anything, but the song [Metameme](https://open.spotify.com/track/4bkwVZ4nqLnaXTfCRWekjK?si=PoXX5H_JQIiDWo22bKJ1cg) is fucking fantastic
---
I dont plan on it, but if i get a whisper from a healer friend saying he needs me, sure ill help out.
---
I took the Crescent Staff over the Wing Blade when I first started playing because it had higher dps... I was a warrior.
---
If you‚Äôre bringing a lappy, front end load it with single player games that don‚Äôt require an internet connection. You‚Äôll probably find yourself bored in your hooch with no internet.
---
This needs to go one deeper.
---
Still deciding between priest and paladin. Either way you should invite me cause I'll gladly heal and buff you :), and I know most dungeons very well. My main was a Druid from vanilla to MoP. Haven't touched it since, and I gradually fell in love with healing.
---
Yes Blizzard is plotting to destroy us from the inside /s
---
You can run classic on a potato and still get like 30FPS, so if you're actually being serious.. yes, your machine will run at max graphics. 
---
I think you have to be trolling though.
---
Hi there,
---
Plenty of posts talked about his in a very negative light, so yes, asked. I'm simply trying to shine a little experience on the matter, my own experience, it's the only kind I have. If you find it condescending, maybe it is; however, maybe it seems that way because you've got the whole marriage thing down and it's old hat. Many don't and most of us don't have it down everyday, it's a relationship, so you work, and you work, and reminders help. You're entitled to your opinion, but I'm glad to have helped foster a positive discussion on this topic. This game is great and I think we all know someone who strained a relationship going too deep into a game or hobby, so here's to avoiding those situations.
---
You‚Äôre probably right I‚Äôm just hopelessly optimistic. I would be so happy to have my game back.
---
Dank.
---
I actually keybinded "attack nearest" to something and used it pretty often. I got to rank 12 broham
---
"i am so smart because I can quote some random person who did not know anything more than the rest of us"
---
Ok, so if the point of life is not to enjoy ourselves? What is it?
---
Unsubbed since a few months into Legion. Wod for only a few months when it was released. Quit MoP 6 mo before WoD.   
---
Been testing classes on a vanilla server for about 4 mo now off and on and must say that its far more immersive and enjoyable than retail by miles.
---
d0pe\_sp0t is referring to Hardiness: stun resist by 25%. Plus your pet gets a nice little damage boost too. So, I agree; orc 100%
---
Its important to charge your batteries too. Spending time together is great and some couples thrive on it, some needs a little "me" time. There's no right answer but for yours.
---
as SL your job will not be  " -  FC and capping in Arathi " it will be defend flag room in WSG and def a flag in arathi. Your damage is not your strong side, its staying alive.
---
Druid, Mage, Priest I'd say are prob the top 3
---
I definitely plan on hitting all the dungeons and their related quests. I don't think it'll take long to find groups while everybody is leveling still, and most of us should have our sea legs back (or newcomers familiar with vanilla dungeon mechanics) after WC/VC.
---
After I've leveled one or two chars I might start skipping the ones that take too long to find a group for (ST, even though it's a favorite of mine). But my fist and probably 2nd character will definitely do all of them because groups should be plenty.
---
You didn't look hard enough. ^/s
---
This is usually something you only hear from people that consume a lot of sugar. I stayed off suger for a long time, and now I cant stand the taste of anything that has sugar in it. Its WAY too sweet.
---
Sugar is like a drug. You like it as long as you keep taking it.
---
I wish you the same :-)
---
Seeing thise posts a lot I just think people don't really know, going to try and give them the benefit of the doubt for now
---
it's not from Vanilla, because I statrted to play with BC. I made a Belf Paladin, and after completed all quests in the Ghostlands, I thought I was supposed to go south. And south did it all went when I run too far into it before noticing that it was a lvl 50 zone. (Also, I could't read english at the time, I was like 10 and I learned it by playing WoW basically, so I noticed the hearthstone and thought "Hmm. I need more space to take these scales from this floathing wyrmy thing. I'm not gonna need this.")
---
No, just wanted people's take on what computer works well current one lags when in raids so I thought it being 40 mans again I'd need to upgrade wasn't sure if this was a good enough upgrade. I know nothing about computers.
---
WotLK was playing the game with cheat codes on. After how hard heroic dungeons were in TBC it felt good to be able to AoE entire instances down. Also like cheat codes, it eventually got boring.
---
Ulduar was the best dungeon Blizz made, with hardmodes not just a UI toggle to increase the boss's HP by 200%. However, it was followed by ToC, which was the worst dungeon ever. Not since MC were raid bosses simply trash mobs made twice as big.
---
Despite being boring mechanics wise, I remember clearing it something like 8 times a week, since lockouts were difficulty and size specific. The loot was so high Ilvl Ulduar was completely obsolete. Icecrown was also a letdown outside of Arthas himself. 
---
TBC introduced flying and dailies, but WotLK added dungeon finder, brain dead instances, toggleable difficulty and only one raid tier remotely mattering. Wotlk had some amazing highs, but is also a large part of why retail sucks today.
---
Why would someone out themself through that?
---
Buy her nice shiny things from time to time. Compliment her. Buy her a certificate for a spa day.
---
I'm torn! I was a Hordie originally and rather proud, but my best friend pulled me allied-side when he finally convinced me to come back to WoW circa-MoP.
---
I think I'll go ally just to see the other side of things, though I feel a little dirty.
---
Hah! Fair point there. I misspoke.
---
Those DG worth xp
---
Druids are great going into MC because pre-bis is very strong
---
They struggle going into BWL because MC offers limited upgrades
---
Going into AQ40 they are good with BWL/ZG upgrades
---
Going into Naxx they should be good with all of the AQ40/AQ20 upgrades which many are BIS game
---
I'm not a total expert though, maybe Naxx is just so hard it doesn't matter. It's releasing next week so we will see. I do know our druids are staying feral until Saph/KT for which they are respeccing to help heal.
---
I have a screen shot of my level 38 warrior in arathi highlands back in vanilla, and I noticed that I was using a quiver in one of my bag slots, lol.  Back then i would pull mobs with bow or gun, and I kept arrows/ammo in a quiver instead of a normal bag.  The quiver tooltip said it would fire faster and I didn‚Äôt realize this only applied to hunters...
---
BLANKETY BLANKETY BLANK
---
I'm so sorry for your loss. I recently lost a family member too, it's not easy.  I know my brother in-law only had one Saturday a month he played vanilla. It took him a damn long time to ding 60, but he made it haha. Grats on making it through all this though. You're a hero.
---
It's been a long time since I played but I had "attack nearest" and "stop action" or something similar binded to keys. It's nice to be able to have those actions, but it's not important enough to have it binded to 1, one of the easiest keys to reach and pound on a keyboard.
---
That's fair, plenty of people want to die surrounded by loved ones at a ripe old age. I know that just isn't me. 
---
I want to simply disappear having had the smallest footprint possible, and having had maximum enjoyment of the time I spent alive. It just so happens I really enjoy living in a box with a computer which is so cheap I'm almost guaranteed to die before my money runs out.
---
Not taking the Crescent Staff reward from Leaders of the Fang as a druid because of the int and spi(no agil or str) and immediately regretting it when I couldnt find a viable wep for another 10 or so levels.
---
Personally I prefer to build my UI at level one and level with it to build up muscle memory along the way. I generally lay my keybinds out in similar ways across all my characters, but it‚Äôs still nice to build comfort. A for interrupt, D for taunt, T for ranged attack, C for Healthstone/Self Heal, MB4/5 for procs, etc.
---
Why is a random addon working in classic worth mentioning? I thought the addon framework wasn't going to change that much, aside from maybe banning a few automation features. Could you not run addons in the Blizzcon preview?
---
#relationship goals
---
Rolling with a group of friends and overall it looks like we will be going Alliance. Planning to play a Female Dwarf Paladin to change things up from the first time around (Gnome Warrior). I love the layout of Ironforge and I am super excited to do the Onyxia attunement all over again.
---
Thats fair enough then. Apologies. Your PC will be more than well equipped to handle classic.
---
While 40 men are of course more, there are  less details and spell effects going off.
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying. I used to have 2 sugars in my tea and now I have zero. I can never go back to having any sugar in tea. However, this isn‚Äôt the same with soft drinks.   Even with juice. Have you tried sugar free Ribena? The sugar is what made the taste so good in the first place. Might as well not even drink the sugar free version cause it‚Äôs not worth the money, water is better or coffee if you want the pick me up
---
Yea TS was around then, but not used as widely as Vent.
---
All but the 2 opposite faction ones that are hard to get to without a 60
---
Each one at least twice, some 3-5 times like ZF and some of SM
---
I mean, honestly that sounds like something one should do. They do that in movies all the time at least.
---
(best Jim impression) Absolutely.
---
You come across as one hell of a hostile man
---
Thanks for the blueprint for talking to my wife!

I unsubbed after wotlk. Played legion for 2 months and then unsubbed again.
---
Just as original as this sub :^)
---
Mained a Rogue from late vanilla/early TBC through to Cata. Had an alt mage from WoTLK to Cata. Will mostly be world pvp/BGs and possibly casual raiding. I didn't really get to experience what a Rogue (or any class for that matter) was like in vanilla, so very tempted to roll one again from the begin. Although I also loved my mage. 
---
Also pretty tempted by Priest (probably go shadow at 60), had a play about with one on a private server and they're really fun, but go OOM too fast ‚Äì I'm guessing they're heavily gear dependent? Something which may be a problem if I'm not intending to raid much.
---
Is Rogue/Mage the safest choice for someone who isn't going to be reliant on end game gear for pvp?
---
NOT VC. DM
---
Oh okay, I thought double the people and stuff going on would make my lag worse on current laptop. Cheers.
---
Very first dungeon I ever did I chose to tank...if that wasn‚Äôt enough I thought I needed to hit the /heal macro every time I needed healing. I also needed on everything because I liked the dice icon. 
---
My group was either patient or desperate because we finished.
---
You know what? I respect your passion, and you're right. I shouldn't have said "slight edge". I'll edit my post. Cheers.
---
&gt; Edit: I have no idea why im getting downvoted i was literally saying that we don‚Äôt have a release date and that im hyped. Sorry for edging off you elitists for fuck sakes. 
---
I downvoted you because you complained about being downvoted...
---
That fucker has more kills than all fel reavers combined.
---
my body is ready
---
you get an upvote good sir
---
This friday release date and beta announcement. May hype. Beta will start early june  last 2 weeks, beta ends June 18th. June super hype. Servers launch July 16th and Earths economy slows down substantially for at least a week. 
---
You heard it here first!
---
Communicating well is the most alpha trait you can have.
---
I think we may have lost ours by AQ40 so maybe thats why I thought they dropped off around then, I guess that bit of nature resist they get is a little nice
---
You're making the correct decision.  Our differences are minor and we'll both be almost 30, married, and alliance and thats all that matters!
---
Now just need TSM addon implemented and I‚Äôll be a happy goblin.
---
Same here. Seeing that awesome zone flooded broke my heart.
---
Abs never hurt haha
---
Rude
---
You abandoned your character?? That's another level of embarrassment man lol
---
I must visit Maraudon!
---
I took the tram to IF, got lost and wandered the lagforge desperately trying to find the tram again. Eventually made it back to stormwind and decided not to go back to IF for a while. This was in the really early days after release so I think a lot of the city navigation stuff didn't exist yet but maybe I just didn't know about it.
---
Yep most of retail wow lag is all the armour shooting off sparks and characters with big blue ground cirlcles following them, ect
---
*Laughs in Brood Wars and Diablo 2*
---
I would recommend taking a look at survey numbers for private servers. The majority of players on private servers are too young to have played vanilla during its release.
---
If you want to have it all cuddly, friendly, never challenging anything you say and only serve you confirmation all day every day: That's what facebook bubbles are for.
---
aha guess im just dumb
---
I did the first raid of BfA and unsubscribed a couple months later. Got tired of doing the same stuff daily and pvp isn't as fun when every class can do every thing.
---
Was that not what the quest needed? Maybe i misremembered. D:
---
This Meme is getting recursive.
---
WoW is a CPU-intensive game. Ignore the other two posts you've got so far saying that there's nothing to worry about. The modern engine is *much* more demanding than it used to be, so your question is apt. 
---
The CPU in your laptop is pretty good and your graphics card is very good. Your gameplay experience will be top 85%th percentile minimum and probably better though I expect that, in some large-scale situations, someone else involved is getting better FPS.
---
This whole thread is about doing dumb stuff dude
---
whatever you need to tell yourself lmao
---
Eh, wiping a ton on Onyxia then MC then BWL then AQ then Naxx.  Brutal enough to kill off some guilds.  It won't be brutal now since everyone knows the fights, but with 40 people trying to coordinate back in 05/06 it was a bit brutal
---
I‚Äôm similar but that‚Äôs because I rely on action. Are shaped like my naga to increase the speed at which I memorize my abilities.
---
So I was a Paladin in vanilla and capped 60, did the same thing on a ‚Äúserver‚Äù a year ago. I love the Paladin aesthetic and being able to be a hybrid healer. But the other day I went on a new server to test out my build for Classic. Boys, I don‚Äôt think I like it anymore. I‚Äôm thinking about rolling a warrior for damage, idk what it is but I just can‚Äôt get into vanilla Paladin gameplay anymore. Any tips?
---
Oh god. I went to Silverpine Forest excited to see the Greymane wall finally opened - but when the zone is completely changed it doesn't even matter anymore. The wall I knew on the southern border of Silverpine is gone. RIP Silverpine Forest.
---

by abuse I mean have it up all the time when possible.
---
when my neightboor started to play WoW in 2005 he knew only couple of words in english. in 2010 he could support almost any dialogue, the only problem was that he couldnt spell 90% of the words, that he wrote. he knew the meaning, could use tenses but had no idea how to pronounce these words :P
---
Horse is in the back. Leave your stick by the door on your way out.
---
Nothing was implied detective, I wouldn't use either of those... But you uncivilized horde do your thing :^)
---
Crowd Pummler changed the meta.
---
Also even in Vanilla, there were promising experiments on using Feral tanks on 4HM to ease the strain of needing so many warrior tanks (Bleamau and Zelkik melee for significantly less than Korthaz or Mograine and it's not a bit deal if they crit or crush, so druids can actually tank them fine, and can use the casting-rod to buff taunt just like a warrior can). If you geared one up on the side or in an off-tank role, he'd be ready to roll as soon as you hit naxx. They also do well as HS tanks for Patchwerk, and also Thaddius.
---
Though to preface, until 1.11 Druid tank was complete GARBAGE. Easier to use than a paladin but garbage. The Stigma mostly comes from that time. Druids only had about 6 months or so to be good tanks before Vanilla ended.
---
Dire Bear forms bonus were about the same as BEAR forms bonuses after the overhaul. And original bear form was basically giving the druid a shield's worth of armor and telling him to go'em. he had the tools to tank but not the mitigation to survive unless over-geared. 
---
I literally spit my drink out while reading the patch notes on how much they'd buffed everything, thinking it had to be a typo, until the update finished and I was able to get in and see that no, it was really happening.
---
&gt;they‚Äôve constantly reassured the summer release
---
One guy from Blizzard said one time "have a Classic Summer".  
---
How is that constantly reassuring a summer release?  If you're talking about all the yahoos on Reddit that keep saying summer, then you're listening to the wrong people lmao!
---
Ez, Next quesiton.
---
Good Alliance.
---
I plan to as I can.  Not sure about going all the way up to Silver pine though for SFK at that level though (I'll be an Orc) but maybe once. Getting a group should be easy as I'll be a Warrior and my wife will be a Shaman.
---
I haven't played vanilla so it will be interesting to do these dungeons when you had to pay attention. I did them in Wrath but they were shadows of their former selves then.
---
Rogue is actually the hardest spot to get, with the amounts of rogues wanting to pvp, and the fact that a premade in both WSG and AB, only want 1.  
---
You need to be friends with your premade, or just stand out so much you get that spot.
---
lmao, Earth's economy slows down for wow xD
---
Absolutely right. Anyone who is trying to deny you a passion or hobby is probably not the one, but you're giving up your lives as individuals to have a life together. If that life together is them watching from the bleachers as you keep on your solo path, that doesn't work for *most* couples. 
---
It takes all kinds though, and there are couples who are content not speaking most of the day to each other and doesn't affect their love or relationship.
---
&gt;You gotta find a girl that understands how passionate you are about gaming, especially a game you've been waiting 14 years for.
---
Respectfully, I while I am looking forward to this game, I wouldn't call myself "passionate about gaming". It's a fun hobby, but there are plenty of things I'm more passionate about than this. Although I do appreciate your response.
---
I just recently leveled another toon before finding out about the heirlooms and I averaged about an hour and a half to two hours with well rested bonus per level (all questing no dungeons). That was on a warrior. My friend recently ran with Heirlooms and was dinging after every 30 min to 45 min with the heirlooms. Without the heirlooms I was able to finish all of Nazmir, half of Vul'dun and only 2 chapters of Zuldazar before being 120.

I've already conned my husband into playing on launch night. He isn't as foaming-at-the-mouth about Warcraft as I am, so he wanted to skip the launch madness but I finally broke him.
---
lol, sorry brother, but it sounds like you're made of steel and gonna get through.
---
Yeah me and my buddy will probably bring a Warlock with us to SM as Ally just so everyone (except the warlock, rip) can hearth out and be summoned back for repairs and water/whatever else
---
It really is! My first run I was a feral druid, made a bunch of potions and handed them out beforehand, and the hunter made me a new set of boots. I hope the random friendliness comes back!
---
Aaaaand my commute just got that much better. Thanks Josh!
---
Lbringer is the only server ever to use the pre-1.9 version of Lupos which turned out to be a colossal mistake.
---
I did not understand how stats work in the slightest for about a year. I always thought the item with the most armor was better, so i had all these ridiculous stats like intellect on my warrior.
---
Is everyone asleep or not on their phones refreshing this sub at work like me?! Why isnt this getting more attention???
---
Hey, if you wanna play Vanilla, you can play it any time already. Just sayin.
---
But the official release does have me excited.
---
it won't. shagu is going to have to code in the 8.1.5 LUA API not 1.12. that goes for all the addons from private servers.
---
Take my vacation Week 2 of release, and play 8 hours every day until she gets out of work. Plenty of time for me to play, and she won't even be around to get pissed off.
---
I'm holding out for the Charlie.
---
real shit
---
Here is the spec I use https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#f0ebovzZZxzeochRo
---
So hemo is reduced energy cost as well as cheap shot and it awards more combo points. One the 2nd way through you will get between 4 to 5 combo points so you cold blood eviscerate and that generally ends the fight vs any cloth wearer. Against warriors I do a lot of bleed kiting. And you can tear them up. And then being orc if you happen to wander out too far of the kite and they intercept you now you have a 28% chance of resisting the stun. Vs the base 3% everyone gets.
---
Dudes gonna make it to level 15 over the course of a week by hunting and pecking boars and then get fucking smoked by one of those defias mages
---
In your defense, /wow has 12x the subscribers, but only 3x as many people online at any given time. The sub count is mostly due to how long it's been around, and how many people used to play WoW.
---
Yeah I'd never not go sub. If I'm a Rogue I want good stealth stuff (I won't be playing one for forever, but still)
---
Oh wow
---
Last one is pretty rad family moment lol
---
Sub rogue on a PvP server is just peachy.
---
If your gonna be tanking mobs most of the time with your mates, go hemo with a slow hard hitting main hand. I guess ghostly strike is really nice here too. Can always macro swap to dagger for backstab ambush when ever. üëç
---
If you have a feral or a warrior in your group of mates, full backstab ambush spec is nice but you gimp your self a little when your solo.
---
I see. Thx for elaborating. So this is for BG or something?
---
Also kidney shot and cheap shot are on seperate DR in vanilla so you don't need to worry about making the kidney lasting less time due to Dr. All of rogues abilities in classic are on seperate Dr timers.
---
Anyplace with a constant large horde presence.
---
Gonna be leveling on a PVE server this time so not having to worry about ganking opens up a lot of places like thousand needles that I never considered before.
---
China loves them some WoW man, so not entirely impossible.
---
It can if we spread it. As I plan to level enchanting I am going to be giving out free enchants to new players as well as maybe making some boots with run speed to hand out to nice players. And when I'm higher level I plan to help out players with dungeons or quests
---
Thanks for the feedback. I love shaman but I am ready for something new. I have friends who will be able to 5man with me so I‚Äôm not too worried about spots.  
---
I definitely want to keep the solo part as priority.
---
Spring 2011 unsub as well, checking in.  Unsubbed to try Rift in March of 2011.  Played that for a month before quitting MMOs altogether.  Cata just wasn't the same.
---
I'm waiting for a release date. Since my wife And I will be going on a RP server, it's a bit more involved for us to find a guild.
---
I had ruled out Druid as I had played Tauren with my Shaman so was trying to avoid them for something new lol. 
---
I‚Äôll take a second check at them. Thanks!
---
This is the spec i run outside of raids. Mainly for PvP/ pick pocket running. It is a good amount of gold that you can gain from pickpocket runs of brd at high level as well as pyromancer kills for the firey enchant recipe sells for like 100-200 gold generally especially early.
---
Bad news bud.
---
My "mentor" of sorts was a female in vanilla. We randomly met in Crossroads PVP (defending) and she saved me from an Alliance player. She taught me a lot about the game and brought me to my first MC run. Kind of had a sugar mamma. She bought me Belt of the Archmage on my birthday lol.
---
Do whichever spec you want, but WotF isn't gonna be anywhere near as good as people claim. You can still Death Coil I believe and it'll be easy af to force out. 
---
Alliance has Fear Ward and more dispels so they aren't actually much weaker to fears overall
---
Echoing the thoughts of everyone else here, absolutely druid. 
---
They're the only other class that allows the rogue to continue playing in the rogue playstyle through stealth. Additionally, the ability to heal is very handy as well and greatly reduces the downtime.
---
Druid and rogue is also absolutely DEADLY in world PvP.
---
I mained a druid in vanilla and it's super fun, leveling as a druid is a treat. Plus you can get into dungeons quite easily while levelling, especially if you're down with tanking.
---
This is true and not mutually exclusive. We'll split for hours to play our respective games, but we don't have a lot of life's pressures and have the time to still maintain our relationship after the hours of HoTS, Overwatch, and Vive. Some people don't have that time and while nobody should "control" your life, ever, in ANY way. Being in a relationship means valuing the other person's feelings, and if they feel like they're not getting enough of your time, it's up to you to find the solution.
---
I guess I'm confused as to why they are being so tight lipped about even whether a beta will happen at all. "Classic summer" is coming up really soon, so they have to at least have plans for how they are handling pre-release/release. Without even giving timelines, I don't see the reason they are being so secretive about even just the high level stuff.
---
&gt;What are your tactics on not completely pissing your wife off? 
---
Not having one. Check mate.
---
Down to Resto Shammy or Holy Priest. Want to be a main healer for PvE and not be worthless in PvP.
---
I just looked up the specs of this laptop and it has a 1920x1080 resolution display (144hz with gsync so that's good!).
---
At 1920x1080, with a RTX2070, You will be able to run wow at max settings with PLENTY of fps (over 100) and will benefit from the variable refresh rate and gsync.
---
If you want to "test out the PC" before classic release you can always create a free trial account of retail wow, download and install the client, max out the graphics settings and see what performance you get.  Classic will run on the same engine as retail so performance will be similar.
---
Make sure you install wow on the 256gb SSD drive and not the 1TB hdd.
---
As far as if it's worth $1500, that's up for debate.
---
You could easily build a desktop with similar specs as that laptop for around the same price (and you get a 27" screen instead of a 17" screen):
---
 [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZDH69J](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZDH69J) 
---
But you can also custom build a PC with different priorities which will still run wow at max settings and get plenty of FPS for less than $1500.
---
Retail feels so unrewarding with zero sense of community. I unsubbed a few months after BFA dropped and am STOKED for classic and to get back into what the game was originally about.
---
100%

Repost
---
boss.
---
This is incredibly sweet
---
Nah dude he already said he didn't know English at the time which is a perfectly valid reason. No need to make him feel bad, his story was pretty funny IMO.
---
You nailed it. Easy to learn, difficult to master.
---
Once you play warrior at 60 it's impossible to play any other class.
---
I'm not really worried about anyone power leveling, because I just won't associate with them. I'm hoping to find a guild made up of casual players, or even players totally new to WoW in general. I won't have lots of time to play, so hopefully the areas I'm in won't be super crowded.
---
Like to know how the hell they get the money. Got a job now and it‚Äôs gunna be hard to allocate time to playing classic unlike back when I was younger.
---
Vanilla had extremely powerful macros.  For example, a macro would cast backstab until you had 5 CP's and then it would cast eviscerate, all with 1 button press.  
---
There were macros that would cast e.g. Inner fire on cooldown while you were moving about doing other things.
---
Macros were just straightt up way more powerful in Vanilla.
---
I wanted to provide you some feedback! We've noticed that sometimes the Bot doesn't reply back with anything for perfectly valid strings, other times it does when something is not found.
---
Examples include:
---
    !ability Crusader
---
    !ability "Greater Blessing of Kings"
---
    !talent blessing of kings
---
    !item Formula: Enchant Bracers - Superior Stamina
---
??? what
---
oooh, that's interesting! thank you, i'll save this comment for future reference :O
---
I remember when I first saw talent points I was like "increase crit chance by 1%? That's like nothing. How useless."
---
I asked my buddy that got me into the game if talent points were important 'cause they seemed underwhelming and he was like "They're literally the most important thing in the game..."
---
Rogue was my first character. I used daggers until like level 40 or so but didn't figure out you could gouge-backstab. So I just used sinister strike with them. Until I switched to mace spec...
---
I will generally run each main dungeon once for a full quest run but not farm them for gear on my sprint to 60. Especially in classic since I will be leveling with 3 other friends the four of us will easily be able to crush dungeons. Warrior, warrior, hunter and shaman.
---
I plan to play a druid and I'm thinking about leveling up resto bear so I can tank or heal. But maybe I wont need to focus on tanking. I'm hearing a lot of people say they will tank
---
But your family is not.
---
Tips on what?  Enjoying paladin or playing warrior?
---
Eq2 was such a phenomenal game that just never got hold of the skillbar issue.   I'm really curious how such an important issue like class skill design bloat never got addressed while content was produced at a very quick pace.
---
Just need one more warrior and you are good to smash through any dungeon lol
---
rose tinted goggles.
---
Are you implying if a thread is 3 days old it‚Äôs irrelevant? 
---
Lol CZ, ok I understand now. Carry on little guy :)

The private server I play on actually seems to lack DPS. From 15-80 the dps spot is always hardest to fill for dungeons. Even during raids we have a lot of trouble finding ranged dps.
---
You think the "progression" guilds are going to want to deal with a bear tank though, rather than just slapping down a warrior tank?

I was in my early 20s when I started playing in 2005. Today I'm married and have a kid. My husband is very decidedly *not* a gamer and doesn't understand sitting and playing a video game for an hour or two, let alone... WoW. lol
---
We're going to expand his shop and get him some more tools so he can build stuff and fix cars no matter what the weather is like. He gripes if I sit down and play a game for more than an hour or two, but it mostly comes from him not having adequate space for his own hobbies and he gets bored.
---
In the past I've also just spent way, way too much time online gaming and will make a conscious effort to balance it better.
---
I wonder how many will stick with it since Warrior is the only really viable tank at endgame and a slog to level.
---
Hi, /u/Ridikiscali
---
Let them test it! Honestly I don't care, if it helps them get closer to actual launch then do it. Any beta is a good beta, accessible to the public or not.
---
Not literally "all" of them, but within reason absolutely!  Tanking 5/10 mans is the main appeal of WoW to me, and doing dungeons while leveling is part of that experience.  I'll be a Tauren Arms warrior while leveling, excited to find some groups and run all the dungeons I can!

I wont be doing them *all* im sure, but ill be doing quite a few dungeon runs, and im sure ill do some of them multiple times.
---
I do want to raid somewhere between semi-casual and semi-hardcore (6 hours per week?), but im not going to be rushing getting to 60.  Ill be playing plenty, but also doing dungeons, professions, etc.
---
WhEn Do YoU tHiNk WoW ClAsSiC wIlL rELeASe?
---
I come back every expansion only to leave after the first raid tier. Now that classic is real I don't think the trend will continue.
---
I plan on leading a guild of some friends and employees. PvP is going to be a strong focus for me. Healing is an option as I played a disc priest in WoTLK. But I really want to play a class with strong 1vX capability. With enough practice I'd like to be able to pull off some intricate PvP strategies, so naturally I'm leaning towards mage or rogue. The rogues CDs are a huge concern for me though as I don't like the idea of having to back out of a fight while I wait for game mechanics to allow me to smash on someone. But on the healing end of things, I wouldn't mind being a healer so I can help my team progress faster and maybe just make an alt class for PvP? Suggestions?
---
I wasn't a little kid like most of you but I do have moments I regret. 
---
1) Leveled my rogue as Ass/Sub bc I wanted to pvp.  
---
2) Passed on Nightbrace Tunic bc it didn't have agi and I thought it was bad.  As a result I wore a green chest all the way through Tier 1.
---
3) Never using slice n dice...the most egregious one.
---
I'm thinking about it. I'll plunk away at it but it isn't a priority.
---
&gt; a couple levels
---
Thats quite generous
---
That‚Äôs sad.  I remember having to decide what mount(s) that I wanted to bring with me, and which mounts to stuff in my bank.  I really enjoyed that in TBC as well.  Oh well...
---
Guys, put your hot cheetos in the freezer and then eat them that way. Thank me later.
---
that's so true. a former friend of mine got me into rift and while it was intriguing, the sounds and animations couldn't grip me like wow did and like cisco mentioned above the lore didn't do much for me whereas with wow it's a big draw. i remember wanting to make a rp character so i looked up the lore for a certain race (i forget which) and was like... huh? that's it? what?
---
the toaster comment is really important too, like. i had just upgraded from a toaster laptop to a lower end desktop that could run wow like a dream, so when i went from that to laggy, stuttering rift that made my computer get really hot i was pretty bummed out. i wonder how rift is doing now.
---
Hand holding. Retail wow aside from say mythic dungeons and arenas is a hand holding adventure game. Classic wow was a sink or swim rpg game.
---
Wasn't [t] a default bind for the same thing?
---
Yeah.  Young children mostly.  Have a 6 month old daughter and I might find 10 hours a week to play if I sacrifice sleep.  But with foundry work sacrificing sleep is dangerous and painful.
---
Priests aren't squishy at all. Inner Fire gives stupid amounts of armor. You're basically wearing mail while it's up. (maybe leather+shield armor if you're not a Spriest).
---
Sending my wife to a yoga retreat for launch week.  But even then once she's back, I have to say I feel wonderfully lucky to have a wife who isn't a nagging harpy about me playing video games.  She (gasp!) has her own hobbies and she knows that I'm super pumped about WoW, so she's just kind of happy for me.
---
Not a fan of retail, but I think this is not actually correct. Many peices of gear you obtain in previous patches in classic will still be useful for you in post patches, classic has more gear connection between patches unlike WotLK and foward. Things don't suddenly become unimportant because of a new patch, you still need to run DM for your buffs, you still need to do previous patch stuff. 
---
Patches in Classic ADD to the game, Patches in Retail Change the game imo.
---
If the general age and maturity of the general classic wow audience has gone up as much as it has for me. And if people really do want level slower and enjoy it than I wouldn't be surprised if warriors were the most played class by about 4-5% at level 60
---
I still know her to this day! We don't talk, but she's a click away if I ever wanted to. We grew apart pretty heavily around TBC/early Wrath, and we don't really share the same interests nowadays.  
---
I'm going in to Classic totally solo, but I'd love if her and I played together. Shame she's not interested in Classic.  
---
I'M GONNA BE A RONERYBOI
---
Legitimately never heard any arguments about this. The biggest arguments I've heard about Classic were for talents because it was a time when you could actually customize your characters talents down to the finest details, not pick from 3 default options like todays talent system.
---
It all depends on what you want to do.  Hunters are beasts in PvP, and can solo probably better than any other class.
---
The only thing they really lack is raid dps.
---
They are doing progressive content to make the game come out faster and so they have to do less work up front. Any other reason they give is just bullshit.
---
Can you explain what the difference between playing a patch and playing the game is?
---
Tauren druid here. Ready to tank or heal if I need to so I can run everything within reason. The 5 man team play in dungeons is probably my favorite part of leveling. I plan to focus on pvp when it comes out but until then I'm just gonna log kn for the few hours I have a couple nights a week and run dungeons
---
GIVE ME THE JUICE
---
let's be honest OP, you don't do any of those things on the right
---
That's not true at all.
---
If it were, the moment that the last stage comes out, everyone would start doing Naxx instead of anything else. You still need to work your way up the gear ladder to even hope of clearing anything in Naxx.
---
I don't think you mean what the phrase "playing the patch instead of the game" actually means.
---
Not me, but my mom, and not technically Vanilla. She rolled a dwarf hunter, and gave up playing for a while because she couldn‚Äôt climb over the mountains surrounding Coldridge Valley (east side of it, so at least she was going the right direction). I eventually had to get my then-top level toon to show her how to follow a road through the tunnel. She was like ‚Äú...oh, that was way easier.‚Äù
---
Trying to float from the world tree to darkshore was a right of passage for Night Elf lol
---
&gt; most addons are just going to work in Classic out of the box, right?
---
Yes. They said the API engine is going to be essentially the same, but they reserved the right to disable certain functions if they were being misused (this being left intentionally vague).
---
It'd be actual news if an addon _didn't_ work.
---
I plan on getting her addicted.
---
If my father was able to get my anti gaming mother in to wow 15 years ago I'll be able to do the same.
---
Paladins can be strong in PvP.  Rey has a lot of tools that let you control the enemy, and the bubble to reset and heal up to full is a big deal.  
---
Paladins have a lot going on for them like blessings etc.
---
Very few classes have an interesting rotation in PvE in vanilla.
---
No they are not. You're looking at a screenshot from a private sandbox server, you could learn the Thunderfury procc and put it in your spellbook if you wanted to there.
---
Use http://classicdb.ch/ instead.
---
First two lines sound exactly like the start of Wonged Hussars.
---
The argument with retail is that everything basically resets every patch because theres so many catchup mechanics, and often times a lot of things change (completely redoing azerite gear/the heart next patch).
---
The idea is in Vanilla you didnt have those gear resets and whatever that made your old gear useless.  OP seems to think the content waves will do that, i guess?
---
Meta.
---
Oh thank you! 
---
Interesting, they also say 4.1, I actually wouldn't have guessed that one. Cheers!
---
Are you me
---
Well, it can be monetized. Some people will stop playing it, some will not and will pay.
---
As a European, I'd been using Vent for years even before wow came out.
---
Night elf mohawk 
---
Always have 3 ranks of *Pity the Fool* on your hotbar at any one to time.
---
Carry ample supply of Sucka Pots.
---
Spec into A-Team early, and Respec to Dripping Gold at 60.
---
No class is that hard to play, you can have fun playing any class. If your friend is a rogue, then they can stealth past mobs, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do this unless u had stealth/prowl too. 
---
A Druid can also pop heals as you two level, meaning you should be able to do any elite quests too. 
---
You can also go bear form and tank a boss or an instance if you go feral.
---
A Druid is a great fun character to play.
---
Broken Blade of Heroes ;)
---
Loved that commercial
---
I have a feeling we‚Äôll get a launch in August at least
---
have fun with no real CC lol
---
Play something that you will enjoy. You can use trials to  experience gameplay of different classes. Classic leveling is a lot different than retail wow. I suggest taking your time leveling, no need to rush to 60. You will learn so much as you level. as for hunter, either night elf or dwarf can choose that class.
---
Its freaking BOB!  You've never heard of freaking BOB man!!  Its only the single most BADASS buff in the whole universe!
---
What commercial?
---
when i rolled my first character, a human hunter (cata), and walked into the abbey, i thought the injured npcs for the healing quest were logged out players for quite some time
---
I only plan on doing what I call cluster dungeons, SM plague lands ones, and black rock mountain ones. Just because you can find a grind group get your quests but also run them all a few times without travel time being an issue. Figured if I did those and maybe 2-3 others I could get Exp. Break the quest grind up and get gear upgrades in increments instead of always running to a dungeon for its quests or loot... just my take though
---
Imps probably got to you before black dragons ;)
---
go human warrior, its basically the staple for alliance, just like how orc warrior is for horde. cant go wrong.
---
You dont need cc when everything is dying so fast to all the magniciant rage flying around
---
Brack floated the "pristine server" idea at one point when they were still saying they would never do classic servers.
---
No XP boosts (including heirlooms I believe), transfers, crz, tokens, group finder, etc. Since it was offered in the context of an alternative to classic servers, it wasn't met well, but I think it would be worth revisiting after Classic has been out for a bit and we see how many people actually like the older wow model. It could probably also use further tweaks like re-tuning (including leveling content) and we should seriously consider curtailing or removing flight in my opinion and replace it with taxis and portals with similar unlock requirements.
---
Enchanting won't get you into any groups...
---
Lock and rogue are both good for soloing around to level 60.  Both will run into the same issue of being one of many dps.
---
Rogues are nice that they can pick locks, stealth around instances, pick pockets, etc.  it's something fun that no other class gets to do.
---
Locks have a lot of inventory management.  1 bag is sacrificed for soul shards.  But, they are fun and strong.  
---
Really depends on what you want.  Both scale well with gear.  Both have separate specs for PvE and PvP.  
---
If you really want to play a shaman, I would start with that though.
---
It's a private server running an unreleased client. You are looking into this way too much.
---

Witcher 3
---
Interesting. I'm not going to join a hardcore raiding guild. I will PVP a lot since I'm rolling onto a PVP server etc.. 
---
Are warlocks mainly destro or is it a mix for PVP and DPS?
---
Disagree, the progression system is completely different. In retail everyone can play the new content immediately or almost immediately. There's no point in attempting to progress through the old content when you can just jump into an easier mode on the new content and start your progression there.
---
In Vanilla/Classic you generally need to progress through old content before you can attempt new content. And some new content like Naxx and to some extent AQ simply isn't feasible outside a more hardcore raiding play style. We saw it in Vanilla and we continue to see it on private servers. Level 60 5-mans and MC was still active well after newer content was released because that's the natural progression.
---
Not necessarily, just that the content I want to do is not avaible upfront for purism reasons
---
No changes
---
Have you played it recently?
---
A lot of running back and forth between goldshire and the logging camp. The two farms on either side of the kobold mine.
---
Then of course kill hogger at 10 right next to the level 10 zone only to run back to goldshire to hand in the quest. Mob density and aggro range  in the two mines and morloc camps is also insane.
---
Also while I'm bitching I love that theres no caster item from the hogger quest but there is a druid staff.
---
I still have a lot of nostalgia for northshire and goldshire though.
---
The longest my sub lasted since WotLK has been 2 months tops, per new Xpac.  BfA especially was trash, unsubbed with the quickness.  I will play Classic though, I miss the days pre-Ion and pre-J Allen poisoning the game, making it not casual but "super-casual friendly" and especially them destroying server communities.
---
What are "super-casuals" you may ask? There are 3-types of players:
---
1. Hardcore
---
2. Casuals
---
3. Super-Casuals
---
First one I don't need to explain.  Casuals, these are the people who play up to and including everyday, but aren't putting in 8hr+ sessions plus min/maxing.  Super-casuals are people who can't grasp the most basic of concepts, don't like to talk to others, doesn't have friends/social skills, log in every couple days and some of those sessions maybe for 5mins.
---
J Allen and Ion are 100% to blame for the loss of million of subscribers aka $$$$, and yet one is the internal boss of blizzard, the other is the boss of WoW. Corp America ppl lol.
---
I‚Äôm almost positive this has already been answered around the time of the vertical slide demo that came out at BlizzCon.
---
From memory the comparable testing indicated the system requirements were a bit higher than the original vanilla 1.12 client.
---
Although the engine was taken from 8.xx and backported to emulate 1.12 most of the graphical and CPU and GPU intensive tasks which cause performance issues in the retail client are not present (higher tri count models, particle effects, post processing, cascading shadows).
---
In summary, (permitting you are using older models and not using any using any new foliage settings) your machine will eat up classic with ease. In both raid and open world.
---
It's winterspring my man
---
That's a nice medium plan. I know it will waste a lot of time running every dungeon and doing their quests. But I also dont think rushing to 60 and only doing your atunement runs is in the true spirit of classic wow
---
If you never had a lvl 60 in vanilla i strongly suggest you check some "choose your class" guides on youtube.
---
Source?
---
Shamans can maybe tank the first couple instances, wailing caverns and bfd but they can't keep tanking I don't think.  You would be hard pressed to tank the last boss in RFD without way overleveling it.
---
However, being a healer means it's super easy to find groups for content.
---
I don't think re-tuning dungeon and raid encounters is particularly difficult for Blizz anymore. After maintaining multiple raid modes/tiers for several expansions now, I would be surprised if it wasn't at least partially automated or incredibly streamlined.
---
Blood elf? Not vanilla thanks.
---
Who?
---
Stahp
---
Playing fast on my main hunter, not going to stick around waiting for tanks to catch up to my level.
---
Instead once I've got a stack of gold I'll funnel some spare money to a tank alt and do every dungeon as a tank. Or maybe a healer.
---
but that is not the point, i am not complaining about this on the same basis used for retail
---
Its just that instead of running ZG like I want I will be stuck in MC and instances will have shitty gear in general
---
1.12 is just a superior version of the game, and imho its lame as fuck to impose this purism on the whole playerbase to appease a bunch of youtube spergs
---
Yes, you are the only one
---
this kinda makes me wanna roll a mage to play with the wife's priest, instead of a warrior...
---
I was thinking of leveling boomy so I can just share the gear, is boomy much worse than feral?
---
I mean i was just excited because i get to play wow with my windows open :p
---
How is human &gt; gnome for PvE?  5% int is huge.
---
Classic DB is almost always correct, the others are very spotty
---
At least he's giving a reach around. The others aren't a sure thing, and are more likely just to cause you headaches.  So there's that at least.
---
Yes, they are. My desk, keyboard, mouse, computer, and monitor are always there to support me.
---
Exacly, so you dont need to timegate naxx to not make BWL etc useless, so what is the point in timegating it?
---
My wife lets me game as long as i listen to her and watch TV shows with her. So I am set. She will even let me play for like 14 hours on saturday. She really is the best. Now if I could only get her to play.
---
HES HIGHER THAN 30 ELITE
---
Have you played retail? It sucks.
---
Yes, that was the level-boost I got when I tried the game a few summers ago. Get to level 60 in roughly a week. All original zones turned to shit. Endless cutscenes, stuck one a zepplin, relearning all new abilities, no sense of identity or connection to my toon, and jump over 10 years of expansions rendered useless.
---
Grab the lube because this jerk is justified.
---
Sorry that you're not getting your way. Stages increase the longevity of the game.
---
If you don't like it, just don't play until ZG comes out.
---
I mean... why not both? Right now I has sex, but no has Classic, and that sucks.
---
Usually it's played with the slaves just on follow on the master. If they're melee then they will always be slightly out of range unless you run the master through the target and back/turn around. Using ranged is much easier.
---
Usually while leveling I would stand back a safe distance and just pull with the ranged, then taunt with the warrior when the mob got close if necessary. A lot of single pulls would die so fast that I wouldn't have to do anything with the tank.
---
In dungeons I manually position each mage then sheep pull and run in with the warrior. Mages have an assist attack macro so they shoot the same target. However when a sheep breaks early, it can be challenging to figure out which mage was sheeping that one and resheep it without marks / focus targets. In Classic it might be possible to set a focus target per mage and have them resheep that with a macro, which will actually make it much easier than 1.12.
---
I also got in the habit of having a "master mage" for when I needed to separate the melee from the ranged, and bound a different key to make all the mages follow that mage instead of the tank. All the mages would focus assist one of the mage, not the warrior, so that I could attack different targets if needed.
---
Solid plan I like it. Hopefully you can tank for me someday. At the pace I plan to level you alt will still probably be able to dungeon with me through Scarlet Monestary lol
---
In high end pvp you're not doing much killing on a rogue, thats the arms warriors job. Rogues have insane CC capabilities with Sap, Blinds, Cheap shots into vanish cheap shots , gouge, mind control engineering helmet, nets, reflects, preparation and do all that CC again. theyre amazing for peeling flag carrier support.
---
Yeah and Green Foot and Mushroom are class specs. /s
---
Definitely in the minority in here but I‚Äôve been subbed since 2005 off and on, and am currently subbed in BFA. Leveled one character to 120 and got bored, so started leveling characters with the Project 60 rules and had 10 times more fun than I was having at max level. I was too little to really enjoy BC, finally hit max level in Wrath. Cata was the first time I ever raided, and MOP was when I got ‚Äúgood‚Äù at the game. Was active for all of WOD and most of Legion when school allowed, and now like I said have played in BFA but hardly any of the actual BFA content, haven‚Äôt even touched Kul Tiras. When Classic comes I‚Äôve got 5 friends all bringing back their subs, so they‚Äôre probably more of the voice in this sub
---
A couple hours a day lol
---
You are correct, no human hunters. The question really comes down to play style and the roll you want to fill. There are classes that can fill multiple rolls. Priest/Paladin/Warrior (Alliance-human). Maybe a Shadow Priest (dps) and then have the option to heal early on. Whatever you choose, just have fun.
---
I'd say the biggest issue with wow is relying more on gambling addiction mechanics to keep players interested than sandbox mechanim. But let's be honest gamble makes more money, appeal to more people than just geeky nerds who enjoy some kind of roleplay and min maxing.
---
Looking at a surgery from soupasouka with ~20k response for the age of people planning to play classic, only 20% were 18-24 and the upper 20‚Äôs still has a lot of potential for people who played classic on launch. Me and most of my friends are in the 20-24 bracket and played on release. So this kinda just backs up my theory, the new gen will be a minority and the majority of the game will be held up by the old gen.
---
Something to soak up damage or heal for you is a giant plus as a rogue. 
---
Druid is probably top tier because it can do both, and also stealth past stuff with you. The biggest downside is gear overlap.
---
Warrior, paladin, or even hunter/warlock with pet can hold aggro and soak damage. This is huge because then you can be an ambush/backstab build and absolutely MELT EVERYTHING. Paladin might be great. Can hold aggro for backstabs or heal, buffs increase kill speed, virtually 0 gear overlap. 
---
Or if you just do a combat swords build like is normally suggested having a healer keep you topped off and wand/melee stuff you‚Äôd have a pretty great kill time and virtually 0 down time. So honestly a priest or enhance shaman would be pretty great too. 
---
Mage or another rogue might be cool for an ultra glass cannon / CC build.
---
Rogue gets some pretty good synergy from every class TBH, it just depends on your play style.
---
I don‚Äôt see the correlation at all. In Classic you‚Äôll be raiding MC even during Naxx progression. Classic catch-up mechanics are minimum. Late comers will have to work their way up the ladder just like everyone else did.
---
no dungeons before level 33
---
then only selected dungeons for quest rewards. 
---
But i cant wait for the level 60 dungeons
---
I mentioned it in another comment but I'll bring it up again!
---
Brack floated the idea of "pristine servers" back when he was still insisting there would never be an official Classic server. At the time since it was offered as an alternative to classic, it wasn't very well received. But I think if/when Classic is successful and Blizz sees a viable market, it would be worth returning to the "pristine server" suggestion.
---
No XP boosts from heirlooms or RAF, no crz, no LFD/LFG/LFR, no transfers, etc. I think encounter tuning is also not difficult for Blizz these days so retuning (especially leveling content) could also be on the table. Some systems I think would be too much to develop and maintain, like reverting the talent system and probably removing/altering flight would not be up for consideration.
---
But I think the pristine server idea taken a little further than Brack initially suggested could be a reasonable compromise to get a lot of us back into the game.
---
Horde for sure. I like your reasoning because some of those are my absolute favorite dungeons. Also I just enjoy the horde races more. I'll play a Orc or Tauren Shaman first, then an undead or troll priest. Save all of my gear as i level to feed to my warrior when i level him. 
---
I really can't wait for this game to launch.
---
Nope, your list of addons won't with without updates, it's a new API. As far as we know, this is the first addon ever to work in the new client. Of course it's a big deal.
---
From what I have heard from buddies recently it's not all that bad depending on where you are at, with pings less than 200. Now days Afghans have 4G phones, so it can't be that bad.
---
Started with a hunter, spent too much time trying to figure out why I couldn‚Äôt equip a gray shield I picked up off of a mob üôÑ
---
Female Dwarf Rogue.
---
So... I really don't get it. This game isn't runescape.
---
A lot of people level up alone, infact most do.
---
Without quests will just be incredibly boring and theres no reason to do it. I mean sure collecting the odd mob drop would be sort of rewarding, but you have to remember you out level those items in like 4 levels, so it's really not anything different than what everyone does except for without quests which is just mental. 
---
The added challenge is non-existant, there is only an added time waste.
---
A survey from soupasouka with 20k responses says that not even 5% of players responded were 18 and under. Like I said the new gen isn‚Äôt going to take it.
---
Will /salute all other horde brothers
---
You guys realize that new people come to the subreddit and don't go through every old post but yeah if you would just go back a bit people constantly ask this question.
---
I honestly  hope for a TBC launch as that is my favorite expansion. If they will let me bring over my characters so that i can do the progression as it was originally played.
---
I plan on lock with engineering for PvP 
---
Alt Druid for farming herbs/mining
---
What should my lock‚Äôs 2nd profession be? purely PvP
---
Prollyvwhat I will do.  Was just asking.  Thanks so much for all the great info
---
another rogue
---
W.T.F. Kingdom Come doesn't have a Czech version? What?
---
Mind blowing.
---
Relax kid, this isn't a blizzard server.
---
Sorry for not clarifying. I guess both? It‚Äôs weird, aesthetically I like the Paladin and the potential to be a meme in PvP with engineering and bubbles but gameplay I like the warrior because you actually have offensive abilities and aren‚Äôt relying on seals and autoattacks to deal damage. I also feel like Classic is my chance to do it ‚Äúright‚Äù this time.
---
&gt;Shout out to all you trying to figure out how to convinces your wife to change your gaming schedule from 8-11pm 3 nights a week to 7-11pm 7 nights a week. lol
---
That fucking feel. I plan on sitting my wife down and saying I'm gonna be quite a bit less present while I level but once I'm 60 I'll commit to limiting my time more.
---
yeah not reading that
---
As a fellow alliance player, I commend you for your thoughtfullness.
---
As a warlock player, aka. the guy who has to farm all the Soulshards, won't profit from his own efforts, and is likely to get some undead dagger in the back while summoning the lazy people chilling it out in SW, I can only say, go f\* yourself ;-)
---
I want to believe.
---
LET ME IN!
---
LET ME IIIIIIIINNNNN!!!!
---
Apart from 12 years of school, TV/movies, popular culture? Yeah mostly gaming
---
That's a nice alternative. I want the option to support while I play. Not opposed to healing. I thought tanking would be a little more needed, but if Pally's have a hard time during the leveling process, I'm not married to it. I can dig healing. 
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Plan on playing a druid and duo lvl with an irl friend. I'm going to make a solo account I can play on while he is busy. What 2nd class should I make? Thinking about mage so I can solo and farm shit easily. Any thoughts?
---
The grind was a lot shorter than pretty much any MMO before it. At least you didn't lose xp on death and had quests. I'm not sure on the endgame as I was pretty young back then but from what I remember and understand, only taking a couple months to get to max level was considered fast and you could kill most of the mobs solo, even as a fresh warrior.
---
Balance is a weak spec for leveling. Feral kills things a LOT faster, and there is little to no downtime for mana breaks.
---
Make a league of legends acc on the LAN server and you‚Äôll learn how to flame all your inlaws !! ;D
---
Nah i was just being a jerk b/c arthas tears is extremely cheap and easy to be by
---
How does giving people less options and producing a more incomplete game increase its longevity ?
---
If you're sitting here waiting around for WoW Classic to release and nothing better to do, I'd highly recommend going and trying out a progression EQ server. Mangler is probably the best one to start on right this moment.
---
I started a while back and you can see where a lot of the inspiration for WoW came from and improved upon in some respects, less so in others.
---
One thing I like about EQ that WoW doesn't do as good a job at is the planned downtime.  By that I mean the game is slow.  Casters need a lot more time to regen their mana.  At first this might seem like a bad thing to have nothing happening in the game at all, but what really happens is your group takes a few minutes to chat, get to know each other, and form a community.
---
The breaks aren't long, but it's just enough that you don't have the Live WoW problem where you can do an entire raid without anyone saying a word to anyone else.
---
me_irl
---
Lol, Watched this the other day. Actually gone back and watch a ton of parodies and machinima from back in the day. May have to make a playlist for when Classic is out and I start that BG Grind (Phase release pending ofc).
---
some kind of open/semi open beta would be nice, so people could start working on addons before release.
---
Onyxias lair has a level 80 error message and there‚Äôs a level 65 Caverns of time dungeon as well
---
It's CC now. Cookie Cavern.
---
Im still subscribed, and see myself playing both games once Vanilla comes out. I'm a high end raider in retail, and love the fast pacing and high mechanical intensity of today's boss fights compared to the more linear strategies of Vanilla. That being said, modern WoW's gearing doesn't have any sense of permanence, and I miss that about the game. I'm excited to play a hunter in Vanilla and eventually get Rhok'Delar for example, knowing I can rely on that weapon for a LONG time. Both games have pros and cons to me, I love them both, and I'm excited to have vanilla return as a part of my WoW experience
---
Mage, Lock, or Hunter.
---
They are also letting alliance use horde mounts and you can level to 60 using only your starting items.
---
Yes....cause Warrior Tanks need all the same gear. 
---
Bear tanks have no real competition as far as raid gear drops. You can progress as fast as you can gear the people you need to progress. And having side-grade people to fill slots, in case you're getting screwed on the drops, is always worthwhile.
---
What's the bad news?  Deadmines wasn't vc til after dire maul.
---
Human rogue and warrior. Both very difficult to lvl. Rogue being a little bit easier. But warrior being more versatile. Strong dps, best tank and strong pvp spec. I'd say rogue are a little bit more complex to master, just because of the timings and cooldowns.
---
Maybe it was just a thing of my guild to use teamspeak, then. Never had to install it to talk to others, though. Everybody was using teamspeak back then it seems to me.
---
What is the point of this post? xD
---
This guy is an entertainer, it is not surprising that he would give an entertaining answer.
---
If you've only played the content from WoD and on, you're in for a real treat. People today get a lot of satisfaction from 'instant gratification' and so Blizzard caters to that. With Classic, this isn't the case. If you want it, you work for it, even if it takes you forever.  
---
The satisfaction from getting something you had to work really hard for will always outweigh the satisfaction you get from being given something with little-to-no effort.  
---
If you are okay with challenges, you'll love Classic.
---
Hunter sounds like it would be more ideal for you.
---
Shadow priests are good, but hunters are more able to progress and excel without as much in terms of items.
---
I will have a regular account also.
---
Thankyou for your input I will take all into consideration for sure.
---
&gt; It cant be monetized besides the subscription fee.
---
Well, the way I see it, it doesn't matter how well you can monetize your game, if said game is dying. If everyone stops playing, you don't get money ether way.
---
And retail is dying. It's not a question if, only when.
---
What would happen if I did? I'd have to delete the toon?
---
Man I hate those rules.
---
Why would you suggest starting with shaman?
---
I figured the lock or rogue would be far easier to level, as has been my experience thusfar, allowing me to bankroll my shaman for easier/OP leveling.
---
When I first turned 60 and learned that Paladins were healer, I purchased every green item on the AH that said "of healing."  
---
I did not understand how important intellect was...or any other stat.   
---
...+healing stats are more important than intellect / crit, right?
---
When I got the trial, I made a Tauren warrior, didn't know how to level so I started killing the harpies in Drygulch.
---
I got from level 8 to 13 killing harpies.
---
Also I logged onto my friend's account and mailed myself 2 gold.. he was on a different server.
---
This was Discord Unit Frames. This was a theme called Paradigm; it had several color schemes.
---
For hemo you really need to know where the weapons are.   RFD, SM, Mara offer slow 1-handers from quests that you'll definitely want to pick up ASAP.
---
I know. It was also pretty stupid because I had an IRL friend in that same guild. Told him I did not like Alliance anymore and wanted to go Horde. Well, at leadt I don't regret that particular decision.
---
How would allowing people to just farm naxx right away increase the longevity?
---
Chain heal and totems breh
---
I played on the default resolution for the longest time, until a friend came over and fixed it. 
---
My eyes felt better too
---
You underestimate the classic playerbase.
---
If they introduce store-mounts/pets, levelboosts, tokens etc. its not a matter of "some" people leaving.
---
The shitstorm would be gigantic and you would lose pretty much all the people who you just lured back in.
---
There is a limit to how badly you can screw your playerbase and not drive your reputation completely into the ground.
---
Well except for rings, and trinkets, a lot of that early ‚Äútank gear‚Äù for druids is also good for rogues iirc. Just don‚Äôt see the point of working through the hassle prebuffs for something that will turn out about as good as a warrior. And do they manage anywhere near a warrior tank dps?
---
Jesus man, you sound like the sticky remains of a circle jerk. 
---
The only reason I know you're not a troll is because of your point on the social aspects.
---
Since when do alpha tests have a "usual" duration?
---
How would they be able to farm naxx right away when you need to be decked in BWL+ gear to progress in naxx?
---
Farming mobs is the way for me. my plan is making gold while leveling. 
---
Even in farm guides i found farm spots that not been mentioned. 
---
Another advantage of grinding is you learn to handle you hero.
---
Kinda opposite to what you're saying, it can very well "go wrong". If you go daggers you need to be behind the target and if your gouge misses/is avoided you lose the ability to do that.
---
good, old AV was shit
---
how does gearing a 0/30/21 work tho ? do you need different sets or is there hybrid gear ?
---
There were no latin american servers until 2008, so before that my server had a lot of spanish speaking players. I was the only person in my leveling group who spoke English at all. I initially made friends within that group because I had a high school grasp on spanish so I could follow the tank's marking instructions okay. I learned a lot of spanish and leveled with them through TBC. I lost all my friends when Blizz opened latin american servers and they took a free transfer to one of them.
---
If there was a north american guild that focused on speaking and teaching a foreign language I would probably be interested. I had a lot of fun with it in the past.
---
Already did once, and I'm planning to go Horde this time, so probably not.
---
&gt;Yes there is, it doesnt run on 7.3.5 anymore first of all. And there may be artificial barriers placed on classic LUA to restrict certain addons from existing.
---
I‚Äôm planning on running all the dungeons I can, maybe if the really far away ones. My fianc√© and I are leveling up warrior/healer though so bit of an advantage.
---
Also planning to start farm BRD ASAP for damn Hand of Justice
---
A few more iterations and the truth will be revealed: there is basically nothing new :(
---
Summer is coming, sooner than soon but it's still too long!
---
Doesn't matter, Engi is pretty much the only relevant PvP profession. Alchemy to make use of your herb gathering druid would make sense to you can gather some funds.
---
It sounds like a BIG waste of time. Just for a mount that is just a reskin of a vendor mount.  Idk that‚Äôs just my opinion tho.
---
I've played games with longer grinds like Aion (never played EQ/SWG).  Agreed it wasn't the longest grind, but reading text with no assistance and going out trying to find some creature south of this town wasn't always easy.  Grind length I'll concede that point
---
LFM 3 dps is a lot easier to fill than tank or healer lol
---
Mythic dungeons are pretty standard for wow players. And if we're not comparing it against old dungeons/raids then wtf are we doing comparing anything at all?
---
The games are completely different now. The challenge is not in leveling or gearing process anymore, it's in the endgame boss mechanics.
---
An August release makes my penis soft.
---
I hope they address any bugs that are found in the beta...
---
So many bugs were submitted in the BFA beta but they weren‚Äôt fixed when the game released.
---
If you're going sub and aren't levelling with a Warrior to take theat then go hemo. Daggers won't work well as you won't be able to. Gouge can be avoided/miss and will often when levelling, which means you can't backstab. If you're planning on PvPing it also means you can go the prep/coldblood build which is great for WPvP/ganking.
---
I'm kinda fine with cross server BGs, but that still doesn't solve the dodging issue. People will still dodge good premades. You need to add a 30min Deserter debuff for missing a BG queue.
---
I miss nhymm
---
Yup! I did it in vanilla and will do it again :)
---
And "after diremaul" was a vast majority of vanilla.
---
You can stack reckoning and one shot people in PvP. You are the hardest class to kill in all of wow. You are the best PvP support class. 
---
If you wanna be ret/reckoning, it‚Äôs pretty fun. The main downside is you have zero gap closer, so you just spend all your time running at people. At least you can‚Äôt be snared.
---
North American servers have 4 time zones to pick from so you might be able to find one that works for you depending on where you live.
---
Priest is super cool in PvP, especially with a trispec you're a bit of a jack of all trades. Shaman is fun aswell, 30/0/21 being the most common PvP spec which is very good at balancing heals and damage. 
---
Really boils down to personal preference.
---
Hey man if you like standing half naked in pits of mud with the other animals go horde. 
---
I‚Äôll be in the best two cities in all of Azeroth and they‚Äôre conveniently connected by tram.
---
The Dominos and Mountain Dew economy will be thriving though.
---
I know the leveling is insanely slow but yes, i plan to level my warrior solely through dungeons.
---
Just gonna plant my ass outside each and spam for group
---
Mage is your safest bet if you want to be really independent from raiding. Rogues can do well without much gear, but they become less reliant on their cooldowns once they acquire some good stuff, and scale pretty well with gear honestly.
---
Why is the flask so good?
---
HORDE! Alliance will always be inferior! Until blood elves join.
---
Yessir, we are 100% rolling Horde. I will get you my battlenet later when I get home in a message.
---
If the subscriber count went from lets say 13 million to 3 million you could say the game is dying, but if 1 person out of 20 goes absolutely crazy in the shop and brings in more money then 100 people combined its still fine.
---
As I have written above, there is a limit to how badly you can squeeze out these whales and not anger every fan you have left, but the numbers dont lie and its still a lucrative business.
---
What, no love for bellular?
---
No rogues or fury warriors for BRD though.......just kidding mostly -_-
---
God I hope they do old events like this one again. I loved that event more than anything even though it was so stupid
---
Not OP; but IIRC, 5% is just the base intellect, it doesn't actually scale with gear. Not 100% on that, but that's how it works for Taurens with stamina
---
75 str = 150 AP for 1 minute. Many fights are quite short also due to dps being much better nowadays, making it an insanely powerful trinket considering it's a reward from a lvl 50 quest.
---
being associated with gnomes is just as bad
---
I subscribed for about a month during legion, quickly lost interest, and did not renew.
---
Friends, family, and coworkers got me into WoW in early 2005. We all worked 6 10-12 hour shifts. I, personally, couldn't find time for more than exploring, screwing around, leveling numerous hunters, and battlegrounds. But several of my friends and coworkers did the PvP ladder (with mixed results due to work) and were able to do progression raiding.
---
So yes, you should be able to find a raid slot.
---
I was going to play pure with no addons hardly for nostolgic sake.  Played on some pservers and about level 20 I was like ‚Äúok I need a quest addon.‚Äù
---
Quests are scattered everywhere for random dungeons and zones so I see it as a quicker google search tbh
---
Didn‚Äôt they say 7.3.5 is the client they were essentially using in the demo? And that they just ‚Äúrecreated‚Äù the rest of the world
---
In BC I leveled as a holy paladin. Why? "I can level more efficiently if I never die!" Used a 2H hammer most of the way, too... but goddamit I could solo anything I wanted.
---
They are finally throwing Oceanic players a bone, it will be Australian Summer 2019.
---
Roger. It‚Äôs a shitty laptop I have but thanks for advice. I‚Äôm going to be study for my staff test and doing schooling.
---
Good luck with that lol. From what I can see and what is predicted rogues and warriors will make up a large population on most servers.
---
I wouldnt want to miss out on quests and stuff. But if I was leveling a priest alt I would sit with you and heal bot for you all the way to 60 lol
---
Yeah, it was put in towards the end of bc.
---
Then when cata hit, it became laughable
---
I imagine some of it is an unwillingness to set a date and then have to change it. Blizzard, and most other developers are sensitive to their stock values and if they push back something it can hurt stock. It'd be better to wait till you are sure you can meet a date before you set it.   
---
They also seem to view classic as a side project and wouldn't want to hurt their "main" content by diverting people from it by announcing this before say 8.2 hype is over etc. 
---
At this point though it is still hard to understand why they haven't set a release. I expected a firm date in march honestly, and here we are in May.
---
Deadmines was never VC. It's DM. There is never any confusion because Dire Maul is *always* followed by the type of run it is. North, tribute etc.
---
Basically me except I'm not bald and my beard would impress a dwarf.
---
So.. I did play all of Vanilla but this happend about a month ago on a private server I was trying out to see if I wanted to get back in to classic.
---
I saved up every single copper. Everything white+ was auctioned. I herbed like crazy. By level 30 I had over 100g, I felt like I was rolling in it.
---
At level 39, I had aboutr 160g and thought screw it, let's level up some tailoring. Mounts are only 40g right. So I spent 120g on levelling tailoring and giving myself a really sweet set of hand-made blue quality cloth armour ready for level 40. The Dreamweave set I think it's called.
---
Hit level 40, go to the mount vendor and realise what an idiot I was. No idea where I got the 40g idea from.
---
I haven't played since, but meh, it's time for some official soon.
---
Oh yeah definitely since we are running 1.12 talents 1/4 of every raid is going to be warriors just about they are just broken.
---
It's sarcasm as in none of them are being original at all
---
I feel you brah.
---
I agree I don't think runining the game for the most avid of PvPs (Basically the reason they play) to make it more fair to the causal group that isn't really all that into it. Its the exact mindset that ruined retail for a large amount of people, and why their is such a big callback to return to the old way.
---
I plan on playing a druid. Luckily I play well against warriors in pvp. As long as I have room to kite I can slowly bleed/dot a warrior to death while out lasting him
---
Work my ass off all summer on the house so when classic comes out in the fall I can kick back and she won't be mad
---
But it makes a great story!
---
Believe they were trying to replicate some of the old movement. Like wall jumping.
---
I got way too excited and let down the last time this came up
---
Two different sets, if you are raiding, feral bear gear is kinda niche, you don't share alot with other classes, alot of your stuff is bis for a while and you get it from dungeons and quest rewards before MC.
---
The resto gear is good and bad, good news is you can utilize the tier sets and there isn't too much competition usually for it, the rings and trinkets and stuff is fiercely competitive across pretty much all healing specs in the raid.
---
Unless you PvP then warriors are MS...
---
Also warriors can tank most content pre raid (and even some raid content) as a hybrid fury/prot spec.
---
^ Blizzard shill
---
TBC was really good no shame in liking that, but if you said MoP we would have had to shoot you
---
Like I said, I'm not even worried about specific timelines. Just basic stuff like "Beta yes/no?" doesn't seem like the sort of thing they need to be super secretive about usually.
---
Yep, not since right after Cataclysm launch. Played for maybe a month.
---
What do you mean prebuffs???? Bear druids are in their final form in classic. 
---
They do don't as much dps, but they do MUCH more threat, which means the rest of the raid can output more dps. 
---
That's why raids have started using them on fights where their disadvantages don't manifest as big. Off-tanks early on, resistance fights, gimmicks. And then experimenting with MTing on certain fights where it's more useful to keep all your warriors on DPS.
---
And even in vanilla they were experimenting with the new buffed Druid to see how it changed, it was just a slow process since they were essentially gearing from scratch and there simply wasn't enough time before TBC's prepatch arrived and changed everything which made working on it further pointless as those raids weren't designed for TBC mechanics.
---
This screenshot actually was taken by my college girlfriend, I am Auroc (prot warrior) who you can only see by the party health bars.  A few months later they would patch being able to raid any/all instances, but in my experience  this was how you did end game before that patch.  I think we had 13 people in this raid, I cant remember the exact number but I remember thinking it was a small group for this instance.  At this time Death and Taxes was a small elite guild on Shattered Hand, later becoming a end game crushing juggernaut that would world first many raid bosses.  
---
Like all of you, I am super excited about classic coming out!  Times have certainly changed, but I hope some of the original game philosophy can be brought back to life for both returning players and new.
---
Ah, case and point.
---
They have upgraded the client to share data with 8.0. Can see that from the voice chat that was introduced in bfa for example, it is in the classic client aswell now (likely to be removed)
---
So the addon API is likely the one from 8.X not 7.3.5
---
&gt;Though to preface, until 1.11 Druid tank was complete GARBAGE. Easier to use than a paladin but garbage. The Stigma mostly comes from that time. Druids only had about 6 months or so to be good tanks before Vanilla ended.
---
What was this abou then?
---
It wasnt. It is now but not in 2005.
---
TBC was the best xpac in my opinion.... but none the less Vanilla is going to be SICK!!
---
Why does this ruin the game for them? They would still come up against mostly pubs just not all from the same server.
---
Its really not that bad. This sub attracts the biggest elitists.
---
I'm actually 21, but enjoyed Nost when it came out. I play since early wrath
---
Vanilla &gt; TBC
---
How are these guys running the client? Anyone know?
---
Priests are capable levelers Burbank in my experience aren't as fast as hunters, warlocks, or rogues.
---
If you want to heal priests are a great choice though.
---
i never would have all keys and no clue about rare Elite. Even after BWL with T2 equip i never hunted rar mobs. But in classic i will have all keys and be an Elite hunting shadow priest. But with hunter as farm mate
---
Just can‚Äôt fucking be happy with what we are getting, huh?
---
they might eventually release it in separate servers, who knows what they will do after naax.
---
Look at how long other Blizzard betas have been for games and WoW expansions.
---
They may be easier to level, but it will only marginally help you level your Shaman. If the end goal is Shaman, just skip the others and start with that. AFAIK Shamans don't need to be bankrolled like a Warrior does.
---
Wall jumping is still in current retail, and seems to be either unfixable or not worth fixing at this point. Wallrunning definitely wont be in, which will make a lot of overworld exploration areas (dun morogh airport, hyjal, etc) quite a bit harder to get into since walljumping is infinitely more difficult.
---
Because they want to play people they see, classic had actual rivalry and a community on both factions. You knew who the fk to stay away from
---
I want it
---
Maybe release a classic new raid.
---
Soon on Youtube "Asmongold reaction to my reaction to Asmongold reaction to Added in classic cdn what does it mean ???!!! Beta soon ? 16th july release possible ???"
---
Bro there's even a wowwiki page on it, which I'm sure is your source for all things wow anyway.
---
It‚Äôs basically unfixable due to balance. Evenly matched premade matches will easily last for hours. They‚Äôll usually just end up either dodging or win-trading because it‚Äôs a giant waste of time. 
---
Not saying I agree with it, but as it is now, people will form premades for the exact purpose of farming regular games, not fight against other premades. 
---
A shitty solution would be to pair full groups vs full groups, but then they‚Äôll just form 9/14 man premades instead. 
---
Cross server BGs won‚Äôt make it impossible to dodge since you can always place a scout alt on the other servers in your group. It would need to be large groups for people not to go through the trouble. It also punishes everyone but the people who ‚Äúruin‚Äù the experience, so it‚Äôs not an efficient way of dealing with the problem. 
---
I totally agree though, premade meta is the worst. Imo It‚Äôs not fun capping 3 flags in 2 minutes, and it‚Äôs not fun fighting another premade for two hours. 
---
The one thing that might salvage it is having a good system for balancing faction ratio and keeping the population to a not too high threshold. How they will do that, if they will at all, I don‚Äôt know. 
---
I played on Sylvanas EU, and late stage AQ was a fucking pain because seemingly every single member of method was grinding R14, it was all but impossible to join a random bg without facing a team of literally BiS geared players. Then they transferred and peace was upon us once more
---
Youd be competing with my wife for that spot lol
---
They absolutely had that raptor mount in ungoro in vanilla. It only took maybe 2-3 weeks of a few daily quests. I remember having it on my tauren and feeling so bad ass in org
---
Warlock of the Horde, still doubting between Hardiness (Orc) and WotF (Undead).
---
I find the Alliance more aesthetically pleasing in general (the Human race especially), but Gnomes are a complete immersion break for me. I can‚Äôt play a Gnome, I can‚Äôt socialise with Gnomes, I can‚Äôt group with Gnomes or call a Gnome my guildie. All I can do is gank every single of those pink-haired troglodytes I come across. 
---
It might seem petty, but the reason I pick Horde is Gnomes.
---
Only going in dungeons for quests or a big weapon upgrade.
---
Well for trinkets, for the most part smoking heart of the mountain and the uBRs quest reward trinket is bis for a very long time/forever. There is no competition for those. 
---
Having a bear tank means 1 less warrior is needed to compete with the rest of the tank pool for gear.
---
I thought that was for level 60 stuff, not level 50 class quests?
---
‚ÄúIf done correctly‚Äù
---
I was an 11 yr old clicker
---
I think the best bag strategies are going to be amongst a group who are playing separate.  
---
A guild where several people agree to send a bit of linen from each to one guy to build up to bags. Then send materials to get the bags made for free.
---
pics or didn't happen
---
I see that, and I would be interested in hearing other plans to reduce dodging. But even 30 min deserter debuffs wouldnt stop premades from sending in a player to check if they were up against a premade and then skipping that match by having that player stay in the game.
---
Your math needs some work
---
your bank alts don't need bags day 1. You can mail them stuff and if they never open it they don't need bags. It can sit in the mail for 30 days. Get mailed back to you and sit there... oh, I don't recall the return mail length. But by then you should have more space on your main or bankalt to deal with it.
---
2 years?  What is with you people and simple math?
---
Yeah but people still used dm for deadmines and occasionally jerks would yell at them about it.
---
A new API? Is there more info on this somewhere? This own subreddit's "[What we know](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow)" page only says 
---
&gt;The Modern Macro and AddOn interface will be used for Classic, however modern features have been removed or limited.
---
That makes it sound like addon compatibility won't be a big deal.
---
My first time playing I had no idea how to log out. With it being full screen there was no ‚ÄòX‚Äô 12 year old me was so used to using. 
---
I spent an hour or so trying to figure it out and asking random people (who ignored me). Finally just held the button to shut the computer down. 
---
Did that for about a month before I learned that ‚ÄòEsc‚Äô opened a menu...
---
I‚Äôve been hurt before.
---
Hey I mostly tanked but I am eyeing warlock. How hard would it be to get dungeon groups? Since I am not exactly as desirable as a tank.
---
True that makes sense then, no idea they transitioned to the modern client (not that 7.3.5 was old) to make development and maintenance easier.
---
I‚Äôm still active, but primarily just engage in the roleplay community. My main is on Wyrmrest Accord, so I log on a couple times a week to get in on that. Occasionally I‚Äôll do World Quests if I see a nice upgrade as a reward, but I‚Äôm putting actual endgame content on hold ‚Äòtil 8.2.
---
I was 10. The first week or so on WoW. Running SFK as a Warrior and Shadowfang dropped. Rolled "need" but then decided to sell it after seeing the gold potential. Someone from my party then said I was a Ninja and was going to report me so I cried IRL to my mother and then gave it to him out of fear. The day still haunts me and is likely the day my mother lost respect for me.
---
No one has money when servers first come out, and everyone is leveling professions.  So, right away nothing sells for shit, then profession materials will skyrocket for a few weeks (especially mithril/arcane crystals).  Once the server ages a bit, leather and mining is pretty much worthless until Naxx.
---
Gotta think about how gold enters and exits the economy.  Generally, people don't farm raw cash, except for 1-2 classes (hunters instance farming, rogues pp and instance farming). On a lot of servers, I find ah prices are pretty rock bottom because no one farms straight cash and everyone just farms professions. The average players income from killing/looting and repair costs are pretty neutral, maybe a little +value (people also do a lot more killing when a server is new, and a lot less as it gets older and they don't need things).
---
Also, everyone pretty much understands now that professions are required to play the game, and by professions I mean herbalism (one of the only professions that is top tier throughout the entire expansion, along with engineering (required) and enchanting (huge commitment)). You can make some money farming herbs/potions, but the market is usually flooded when everyone and their mother has herbalism, and with mages farming DME.
---
The best selling items are things you need to farm but are limited in where you can get them.  For example, elemental earth is needed for repair bots, sharpening stones, and greater nature protection potions (they also drop solid stones,  mid level mining item required for goblin sappers which sell great), and you can only get elemental earth from a few places in the game so the price goes way up.  Same with, say, elemental fire early in an expansion when everyone needs greater fire protection potions and there's only a few fire elemental spawns in the game.  Also grave moss, you need 4 for each greater shadow protection potion and it only spawns in 4 places in the game with limited nodes.
---
A lot of what determines the market is what stage the game is in.  At launch, everyones farming mining, herb and elemental fires like crazy and no one has cash to spare.  In BWL, people have a bit of money and need fire protection potions, some shadow protection potions. When ZG is out, cloth sells well because all the caster DPS rolls tailoring for bloodvine. By AQ40, everyones farming elemental earths, grave moss, large brilliant shards, righteous orbs because enchants are plentiful by now, but the mats are not. When Naxx comes back around, every profession is needed again (you need every protection potions -arcane and you need mining/leatherworking/skinning mats for every piece of gear and attunement, also lots of frost resist gear) and the server is flush with money, so its easy to get cash right before and during Naxx patch.
---
Theres also gimmicks to farm.  Healer/tank combo with mining/enchanting in DME can spam runs and get mad mad cash. Hunters can farm mara or DM:N for 75-150 g/hr. Mages aoe farm DM:E or ZG crocs for items.  Rogues farm gravemoss and pickpocket and get npc items in RFD. Horde herbalists can farm gravemoss and sell it high (it only comes from alliance zones or RFD, slim pickings). Certain classes can farm the Chimeras for Chimchops in Feralas (or team up with a few buds) and make mad money. Groups money farm dark runes/righteous orbs because they only come from specific instances. Groups control the un'goro devilsaurs for their leather so people are forced to buy it. Groups farm the giants in south winterspring for their e'kos which all physical dps needs, and it sells well.
---
For becoming an AH baron early on, you should roll a class that can farm straight cash early (hunter/rogue/mage), or sell items these classes need (devilsaur leather is obviously a good one, DPS potions, etc). There's some tips: Enchanting materials do not have an AH fee, so its very easy to buy/sell those items or flood/starve the market if you have the capital. Depending on the scripting and what addons are available, its also easy to push items by other buyers to the back pages. Prepare to buy items for upcoming patches if you want to make bank (good idea is something like, buy a buttload of elemental earth before everyone realizes they're important, then resell them when everyone realizes they need them - the price goes from 1g to 5g a piece between launch and AQ40). In general, its hard to be an AH master because everyone knows how to do it these days.  It requires a lot more camping and theres much smaller margins of profit now than there used to be.
---
Most people I know are just poor and run with herbalism and farm their own shit. Most of the rich people I know get money from raids (aka not wiping) and cash in with needed items at the right point in the timeline (elemental earths at AQ40, arcane crystals at Naxx, etc), or have something no one else does and needs frequently (enchanters with raid recipes, alchemist with flask recipes).
---
I loved TBC, however I'm almost positive most people who feel the same way are a bit high on the nostalgia.
---
TBC is hands down my favorite iteration of wow, but looking back at some of the rep grinding or the attunement chains... it was a huge slog.
---
Later patches removed most of those issues I had. They also bumped normal mounts down to 30 and reduced the cost of mounts/training at some point.
---
Even with my love it, I just know that it wasn't perfect despite the idealised version of it in my head. I've played on a few of the unofficial TBC servers and you're never really sure what is "blizzlike" or what is a shortcut the devs took just to get the server up. I would love for an official blizzard run/build TBC server so hopefully post classic that is talked about.
---
Do we live in a world where someone can't express their opinion? He even mentioned that he was looking forward to classic.
---
You can probably heal all 5mans without talents, given proper gear and the group isn't bad you shouldn't have any issues. Most group damage is avoidable and the tank could be doing more mitigation than most normally do. That being said, you'll probably need to drink more from being less efficient. 
---
As far as raids go most people wont know what spec you are so if you are actively trying people wont be able to tell for the most part.
---
While there is obviously testing that will need to be done, this isn't a brand new game that needs to be tested. It's the combination of an older game and newer systems. I personally don't think the beta would need to be as long as a typical one.
---
Because speed run guilds would be thru naxx 3 weeks after launch. Can't have that.
---
I've been unsubbed since vanilla.
---
Shadow is very weak at PVP until you get BWL or higher +shadow gear.
---
&gt; Armored Board from ZG ( Ithink?) 
---
You mean armored boars from RFD or RFK ?
---
If you're not typing this on a phone you have no excuse ! :p
---
It makes it funky fluffy flacid.
---
i was explaining WHY people think druid can't tank. And where that stigma came from.
---
Because for 4/5 of Vanilla they sucked. (it also didn't help that innervate was the 31 point talent at the time and the rest of the talent trees were so meh, you pretty much HAD to go 31 point resto to raid, which is where the Druids always heal thing comes from).
---
Post-buffs they're great. They'll be great from Day 1 in classic.
---
But most people only remember those druids from most of vanilla, where they had almost no armor, pretty much no bonus Hp, and had tools to tank but were essentially naked, and was basically just a bad rogue with a taunt (except rogues are better cause they can parry).
---
And thats what they remember when they think back to vanilla because druids were only good for about 6 months before TBC's patch changed everything. As a result most people just assume that Druid didn't get good till TBC.
---
i didnt say anything about specs
---
Yeah aside from Ulda and possibly people trying to get that chest piece, ally don‚Äôt really do badlands often. Closest FP is loch, which is quite a hike.
---
FALSE
---
When retail players say "You play the patch" they mean that all progression is lost each patch. With an increasing ilvl cap ( cap, because of Titanforge ) and new AP levels to farm again.
---
If playing the patch was true in vanilla, at the end of MC everyone should be able to do BWL. After BWL everyone should be able to do AQ40 and after AQ40 everyone can do naxx. This is not true at all. Not even remotely.
---
Between rogue/lock/mage
---
-I want to raid and reliably have a spot.
---
-I want to be able to farm gold well.
---
-I want to be able to hold my own in world PvP.
---
Leveling hyper fast isnt super important I just dont want it to be a slog.
---
The fact this comment is so heavily downvoted disappoints me.
---
Are you me?
---
They will notice the poor dps though and most raids don't want a Spriest, its a bit of a meme spec until ZG drops
---
Do you have anything insightful to add?
---
I‚Äôve got the second edition master strategy guide, dungeon companion and atlas from when I got them in 06, I‚Äôm reading through them just about every day and putting in post it‚Äôs to help me remember the important stuff. Trying to use the online sources as little as possible and honestly it‚Äôs really fun. They‚Äôre incomplete to an extent like the dungeon companion doesn‚Äôt have Naxx, the atlas has the pre-AQ silithus, and the strategy guide is missing some changes, but they‚Äôre absolutely worth it imho
---
He said he will be healing not dpsing
---
This is a great listen.  It's really fascinating to hear the perspective of someone who worked on EQ, especially since I came from EQ.  
---
The "EQ tune" discussions remind me a lot of the discussions we see on this forum regarding BFA and Classic.  These aren't easy questions to answer and there are pros and cons to every decision that gets made.  It boils down to what is at the heart of the player and being able to give those players the best experience you can.  I think this is why it's evolved to the point where the demand for Classic is as high as it is, we got to far away from the original philosophy and the current game isn't for us, but it got there from the same method that gave us Classic in the first place.
---
MMO's are constantly evolving and these philosophical debates are very fascinating to me, they really show how the worlds we game in are created.
---
I doubt Blizzard would make the changes necessary to make it fun overall for me personally, only raiding was redeeming in TBC.
---
Resilience killed pvp vanilla so no plz
---
Ahhh .. I have so many fond memories of raid groups in dungeons. Thanks for sharing.
---
They should release TBC and WOTLK content but keep all other vanilla traits, including max level at 60. The retail cap is at 120 and for those who like that style can play it, but I think it would be awesome to have Vanilla, BC, and WOTLK content all without increasing cap. Making flying an achievable quest for each zone such as the pathfinder quests, even split Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms so you have to explore and experience most content to flying in each individual zone. If anything, don‚Äôt raise the level cap past 60 and you‚Äôll keep the community together throughout PVE and PVP.
---
I was raiding ZG on my frost mage and after numeral failed attempts on the bat boss, our raid leader told all ranged DPS to be the furthest from the boss. Since my fireball had 40 yards vs 35 yards for frostbolt, I ended up spamming fireballs while I was specced heavily into frost.
---
Agree 1000%
---
I assume eventually there will be a list of where the streamers are but I doubt it will be out before launch.  If I was a streamer I don't think I would tell people.  They will try to name snipe and them make leveling harder.
---
Of course people will figure it out but delaying that is in thier best interest.
---
My trick for having a close auto attack button was to set '~' (the key to the left of '1') to auto attack since it didn't have a default function
---
The best hope right now is that we get a list of server names prior to launch.  This will make it easy for friend groups to coordinate launch-day gameplay and for streamers to organize their own communities.
---
If you don't accept queue you get the 30 minute deserter I think it what he was saying. That way you can't avoid them without making your grind hella inefficient
---
Armor is worth way more to then stamina for your pet. As the pet rarely will be at max HP anyway.
---
My wife plays more than I do.
---
"Tossme" lol
---
Rift was pretty good but it was basically trying to be WoW with more customization.
---
I think the scale of it felt off, the zones felt too small to me.  Also the engine felt wonky.  The animations were mediocre as well.
---
But the thing it clearly got right was public events.  It's crazy how it predicted them and now they're a staple in games like Destiny and The Division and GW2.
---
I think your aspiration is possible. You will need an understanding guild, and perhaps forgo healing altogether and shadow in raids. Or more likely you will need to spec healing while your group is progressing through raid content and then switch to shadow once your group has gear to support you being more inefficient.
---
did we have an aggro meter in vanilla .... i am pretty sure there was no damage meter and no boss mods either
---
Apparently you struck a vein lol.  I would totally prefer TBC but vanilla is pretty great too.
---
TBC was probably the best part of WoW and I‚Äôm hoping for it to get it‚Äôs own legacy servers in due time. That being said, I have much stronger feelings for Vanilla and it would be silly not to release it first.
---
What about a system that whatever # you queued with the opposing team had to queue have the same number of premades. So if you queue 9 you have to wait until opposing faction queues 9.

&gt; **What does "pfUI" stand for?**

 The term "*pfui!*" is german and simply stands for "*pooh!*", because I'm not a big fan of creating configuration UI's, especially not via the Wow-API

Sadly there's a bug for hunters : it doesn't count attack power as ranged attack power too.

Have not subbed since 2014. Fuck retail, imo. I will re-sub for classic, hopefully without WoW token &amp; RCR.

---
Kevin Jordan is ridiculously wrong on the priest racials. The idea that you can summarize an entire culture through a single ability is laughable but it's undermined by every other ability being the same name for all races anyway. Sometimes it's better to just not do something than to do it half-baked.
---
I think his mentality on abilities and race choice in MMO games is wrong. People get attached to their avatars and they care a great deal about how they look. Nobody wants to feel pressured into choosing a particular race but the reality of the racial system in WOW is that everybody is pressured to a degree because some racials are clearly more useful and consistently useful than others. Racial disparity reduces player freedom to express themselves through their in game appearance but also reduces their ability to choose a race based on their cultural values.
---
You can't fix an OP ability for one race by making every other ability OP in a different way. You still have the problem of people feeling pressured into playing races they don't like the look of both in appearance and culture but one ability is always going to be more important than the other.
---
MMO games don't work like roleplaying tabletop games. In roleplaying heavy games nobody is particularly concerned about the numerical viability of a character because the game master tailors the game to the group. The insane difficulty dungeon crawl groups have always been very light on RP because they rely on a lot of metagaming to be optimal.
---
The priest racial system was a failure and it was primarily a failure because people ended up going dwarf priest because fear ward. You talk of the importance of cultural differences in priests but ultimately by creating disparity you remove this nuance as players don't feel like they can choose a race for it's appearance or culture.
---
Playing the AH is providing liquidity to those who need it. Providing gold to those who need it quicker and providing materials to those who need them. Asserting that it's detrimental to a realm is just absurd.

Love Scott Hartsman. Rumor has it his bald head smells like Unicorns and Rainbows.

this would be a thing if vanilla is not a gimmic or a fad that burns out quickly when the nostalgia goes away
---
Go orc. Fewer locks on alliance and you will soon find out that rogues are going to the bane of your existence as a lock so that extra 25% stun resist is a life saver.
---
I have a similar story and can‚Äôt tell if mine is worse or not. I knew there was a tram as far as entering instance portal. What I did not know was that there was an actual moving tram that went back and forth. So I walked the entire track. I went all the way through the trams path...on foot.
---
At least the game *had* quests.
---
In pretty much every MMO before WoW they just drop you in with no quests and no direction. That's a lot worse than having quests that at least give you a cardinal direction.
---
Did they make the endgame dungeons way way easier in a midgame patch?
---
Somewhat.
---
Most servers ive played one focus on the patch, but in vanilla you can never fully abandon the rest of the game (except for 5 mans, those certainly get abandoned).  We ran MC all the way thru Naxx because bindings were needed and it -still- dropped BIS warrior DPS gear (actually most raids drop 1-2 pieces of BIS warrior dps gear - and if the warriors need it, you'll be doing it).  BWL we didn't run, but there was always organized pugs for them we joined because it drops amazing gear.  AQ40 has some sicko BIS trinkets.  ZG has the heart and bijous, onyxia has her head. AQ20 gets abandoned, but it blows anyways. World content never dies, everyone has to farm no matter the patch. BGs fall off a bit, but there's always people queing.

It's not like in WOTLK, where I had pretty much BIS gear in ulduar, tried to come back and raid ICC and everyone laughed out of the room with my GS because they farmed a normal mode instance with 5 bosses for a few months and had double my stats.
---
Ahh true, well they'll figure it out based on his hps/overhealing, better to just respec for 10g than to waste 39 other peoples time
---
Default UI master race. So much more immersive. I used ElvUI for a while but noticed *significantly* I was less into it. Playing on Ultrawide though I may use something like MoveAnything to bring the unitframes a little closer back in.
---
I have one of the best druid names of all time and I won't be sharing it until you see me on the live servers!
---
Hmm alright, if I went the priest route, what would end game PvP look like for me? Would I be limited to 1v1 30 second duels before I'm OOM and getting rocked?
---
i am not sure how dungeon finder affects this... there are toxic players who leave groups if someting doesnt drop but it happened before dungeon finder was a thing too
---
Your only hope is honestly to find a more casual guild that will bring in anyone for their 40man raids. You will be pretty damn useless as a deep shadow specced healer, just saying. I think you should rather just try and get the position of being the only shadow priest the raid brings instead.. or just spec healing and come with terms on respeccing weekly.
---
One does not simply walk into Blackrock Mountain.
---
Leveling up my Undead Warrior I had NO clue what I was doing, had a hard time with some quests, and wasn't the best person for group content.
---
* Couldn't find where to start the Undead Defensive Stance quest and abandoned it. 
---
* Was in a SM Armory when the tank left and someone told me to but on a shield and use sunder armor to tank. Told the guy I didn't have the ability and got into an argument over it. Did the Orc Defensive stance at 36 and finally found out how stupid I was for getting it this late.
---
* Level to 60 as Arms with dual wielding. Always went for the fastest 1h swords I could find as I thought it was the best for damage and getting rage. Didn't get Berserker stance till 60. Had a ROUGH time leveling.
---
* And my all time favorite. I use to not understand the loot rolling at all. I though that by clicking Need it would go to the person who needed it most and clicking Greed would mean you're being greedy and trying to take the loot. I rolled Need on everything as wanted the gear to go to the person who needed it the most and didn't want to be greedy. Got yelled at all the time but didn't understand why till later levels. Sure got that bass ackwards. 
---
**Still had a blast playing it! Can't wait for Classic!**
---
You're assuming you know what iv cleared and done in wow... You legit have no idea what you're talking about... Just stop. If you think pve is harder now in bfa than vanilla, dude you're gonna have a shitty time in classic. Make sure to come back and keep posting about stupid shit when it launches. can't wait to see dipshits like you struggling
---
Humble AF. I dig it homie. This isn't low effort meme quality though. I'd say its more of a next level effort meme my guy!
---
Blizzard learned a long time ago that telling the community anything that isn't set in stone only sets things up for people to get mad at them if something gets delayed or changed.
---
This, you don't need bags till you start actually putting stuff on the AH. If you are doing day 1 AH listings, then I guess maybe, but I'd recommend waiting at least a few weeks to a month before posting so the economy can mature/stabilize and people actually have the gold to buy things.
---
Ofc things like wands and bags will sell fast, but then you've got to put in the effort of grinding those professions to make it worthwhile in the long run.
---
DHKs are a garbage mechanic. They effectively eliminated city/faction leader raids virtually overnight - not because no one wanted to do them anymore (they're still one of my favorite parts of the game) but because they had such a huge negative impact on the equally garbage PvP ranking system.
---
As for ganking, that's simply part of life on a PvP server. If you don't like that, fair enough; that's why Blizz has PvE servers too. And BGs for those who like a more organized and level-restricted competitive setup. For the rest of us, the unstructured chaos and potential unfairness of world PvP is an intrinsic part of the appeal. It means I gotta' stay on my toes when I'm out in the world and be more clever than my opponent. It makes the game far more engaging for me.
---
30 days and then another 30 days on the return.
---
Also they all have a free 16 slot backpack and a huge 40? 48?  slot free main bank, so you can stuff a lot without any bag if you use a few bank alts.  the only price is the time it takes you to run a lvl 1 to the city
---
They use a modern client and modern server code, so classic is probably not much less complex than BFA performance wise.
---
Dwarf mama?
---
See your mentality only applies to elitist/hardcores. I've had 31 point reck/prot paladins top healing charts against elitist/tryhards and when they found out his spec they demanded he respec. Then his class officer had him put on probation because of his spec despite him out classing his class lead in every aspect of the raiding scene. Except sucking the GLs dick
---
Can I be in this club with you?
---
Realistically, you'll be fine healing 5mans *if* you have a group that's at least decent (as in: Tank can hold aggro, group allows for and waits on mana breaks, dps is able to CC), and you bring your own mana pots. Of course, not all 5mans are created equal - if you attempt to heal Dire Maul North as a shadow, with a group mostly in greens, you're gonna have a bad time, even if you all play decently.
---
As for healing raids as shadow: Unlikely. Your mana reg, output and especially your ability to *land* that output will always lag behind someone who actually specced into healing, which means that most raid leaders will chuckle at your suggestion and move on to an actual healer. You can play as well as you like, but so can every other healer (including addons), and don't think there's no competition among healers. The amount of sniping going on in a well-running raid can be insane, and with at least 31 points in shadow, you do not stand a chance against any healer that isn't completely asleep.
---
And you sound like the dude licking up the remains of the circle jerk
---
Yeah, TBC is my favourite version of WoW too. Classes/specs being made viable was one of the main things for me.
---
Servers with no streamers will be dead in a few months so might as well join the same server at the start.
---
i would really like to have scaling leveling zones up to lvl 59 at least (at 60 there are some zones with elites they shouldnt scale or there goes my wd epic farm)   
---
condsidering they are building everything on the bfa engine, it should hopefully be doable ... please please please, i really want to finish ashenvale for once ...
---
That's the mother of the centaurs sheeple!! Zaetar, eldest son of Cenarius found that piece of rock-ass so good he forsook his position as a keeper of the grove to mate with Princess and ended up fathering the Centaurs, who also all promptly killed him.
---
I‚Äôve never seen this happen through my years, also never seen this expressed in any of the websites that track legacy stats.
---
Yeah sadly its a nobrainer for companys now.
---
Develop over many years and a big budget an MMORPG with Lore, Story, Voiceover/MoCap Actors, a huge well designed world, continuous content and balancing patches, addons, tech-support......
---
or...create a big empty Map call it Royal and pump out skins and watch the money flow in for minimal effort.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure warhammer age of reckoning was the first to put public quests into an MMO
---
Just can't be fucking happy with BfA, huh?
---
I prefer BC for a couple reasons. 5-man heroics, the hardest dungeons in the existence of WoW. Excellent raid design, unique boss fights and scenery. Amazing Class design, it‚Äôs like Vanilla with steroid sprinkles. 
---
But I‚Äôm still looking forward to Vanilla. Classic is just such a sweet spot. I love that there‚Äôs one world and no flying. And the community is tighter than ever.
---
BC&gt;Vanilla&gt;Wrath&gt;Everything IMO. But I‚Äôll enjoy every minute of Classic and I‚Äôm chomping at the bit to play it.
---
Your gonna fill up on 6 slot bags anyway from leveling might as well just send them over to said bank alt when you get better ones on your main
---
I WANT TO BELIEVE PLEASE BLIZZARD
---
Just get Helm of the Executioner Helm until Lionheart, it's at least as good as the visor anyway.
---
That ‚Äúlet me in‚Äù meme sums up my feelings about Classic WoW so perfectly it‚Äôs unbelievable. It‚Äôs perfect.
---
My Princess
---
I guess you're right and I forgot about that.  So, it's not huge but it's something.  I guess I just don't think humans have much for warlocks other than their impeccable style.
---
I‚Äôd watch it
---
To be fair, they totally had all that stuff coming.
---
I mean, they're *elves.*
---
...why yes, I *am* an utterly unabashed fantasy racist. Thanks for noticing. :D
---
I don't know what you mean by website tracking legacy stats. I had logs on realmplayers when that was a thing. Quality of player is 80% more influential to the meters than spec will ever be.
---
Having balanced content on the sub is a good thing, if you want to filter it out you should but dont discourage memes.
---
Streaming is part of gaming now whether you like it or not. Escaping from any possible streamers is pointless. I can understand the biggest guys but even then people blow this out of proportion. Even if there will be no server with decent viewer pool streamer someone will grow organically on that server to become one.
---
You actually get to game from 8-11 PM 3 nights a week?
---
Not OP, but I‚Äôm *ecstatic* we‚Äôre getting Vanilla, even if BC is my favorite. I look forward to spending the next 3 years plowing my face into Murlocs, demons, and horde scum. 
---
But I think a lot of people *do* prefer BC, or at least just want to play it. We need the community to band together and ensure there‚Äôs no stupid ‚Äúwall of no‚Äù for BC, like there was for Vanilla.
---
Not officially, but addon developers have said that it's a mess of some 7.3.5 and some vanilla. However we should not consider the API to be finished until it's actually released.
---
Or rogue or feral druid
---
The endgame dungeons were supposed to be entrances to Raids (BRD to MC, UBRS to BWL, Strat to Naxx) so they had zone portals in the middle of them and you could enter as a Raid. Could get loot but not complete quests in a raid group. So we started to do gear runs as raid groups when people hit 60.
---
Soon they patched that out.
---
The only endgame bow that won't be a DPS loss compared to a similar ilvl crossbow or gun is Rok'.
---
What did I just watch
---
If your list of addons are for modern wow then they may work. 1.12 client addons most likely will not be compatible
---
I agree, TBC is my favorite period in wow, vanilla is great and I'm insanely pumped but if we ever got TBC in a couple years I would physically explode with joy.
---
Warlocks have about as easy as a time as most other DPS. Which is to say, there is always a lot of DPS. If I was making a group, I have no issues bringing a warlock, and depending on the dungeon I might prefer one to a mage or hunter.
---
A voidwalker can tank an add on a large pull, like the later pulls in UBRS. So a VW can be seen as a sort of CC. 
---
You can summon people assuming you and 2 others are at the portal to a dungeon. 
---
Healers and tanks of course find dungeon groups the easiest.
---
Ah yes, my Q3 investment portfolio.
---
Well they did state that they were adding things to drop tables in phases, so they'll probably be doing the same thing with quests.
---
Mage or Hunter for the great farming potential at max level imo.
---
Uh why do u think letting lvl 6s get killed in pvp is a good idea?
---
My first char was a pally in tbc. Leveled as holy because a friend told me holy was the best at 70. Used a 1 hander and a shield exclusively. Because I didn't want to die. For some reason I didn't realize 2 hander did so much more damage.
---
I didn't aoe grind, and tried to fight only one enemy at a time. I only used seal of wisdom after I got it l, so I was basically always at max mana, and would FOL myself if I got below 80% hp. I remember when I finally got holy shock, and was able to do more damage. Best day of my wow life.
---
Never died unless I was ganked, but goddamn it was slow. Took me over a year real time (no idea what /played was) to hit 70.
---
i was 60 before i realized yellow mobs wont aggro you  
---
figured they worked like any other mobs so i would just pull any that were in my way
---
"I wish to know the Classic WoW release date."
---
*"Soon."*
---
I don‚Äôt like to waste 39 people‚Äôs time because I want to play a meme spec, that isn‚Äôt 80% player quality, you can‚Äôt just pull up a random number and say it‚Äôs true...
---
how many times can we pile up this shit?
---
Warriors are always great no matter the role. Tank, the best, DPS, one of the best, PvP super strong.
---
If you go warrior, consider a 0/31/20 Fury Prot build, does good DPS, and tanks better than just a pure fury or Arms warrior would.
---
The pfUI creator unfortunately said he doesn't plan on porting it to classic, as it would have to be completely re-written from scratch.
---
for some reason this reminded me of having to get that room of drunkards drunk in brd for .... some attunement or another ... was mc or bwl or something .........
---
LET ME INNNNNNN!
---
Sure you can, you just get 1 guy to be the fall guy. Queue pops, he goes in to see if it's a premade, and if it is he eats the deserter buff and logs on an alt. Repeat. You literally just need 1 out of 10 to be willing to do this.
---
Warlocks tend to go SM/Ruin 30/0/21 It is solid in PvE and quite good in PvP.
---
Hunters are good at PvP, any premade normally has 1-2 Hunters. And if you do raid in a casual way Hunters are always needed for traq, hardcore guilds tend to bring 3-4 more casual guilds might bring more.
---
Lock or rogue will definitely be faster and easier to level, but bankrolling a shaman will only get you so far.  It's not like bankrollin a warrior or rogue.
---
Leveling a bankrolled shaman after leveling a lock (the faster of the 2) will take a *lot* more time than just leveling a shaman first.  That's my ultimate point. 
---
If you want to play a shaman at endgame, level it first.  It's a capable leveling class without too much downtime and you will be able to do dungeons as a healer.
---
If you want to level back to back characters more power to you, if your goal is to progress a shaman though you will get there faster by just leveling a shaman from the outset.
---
Sweet ass. For anyone else reading this thread and want in feel free to message your Bnet as well.
---
You don't waste 39 other players time. That's not how raiding works, the mentality that if you aren't minmaxed you waste other people's time only matter if you are having issues on content. As a healer if no one dies or comes close to dying, it doesn't matter what spec you are using at all. You aren't slowing the raid down and you aren't costing time. So shit talking a healer for being a worse spec when content is being breezed through is elitist and douchey lol
---
I am hopeful that we will get an expansion server. A server that enables TBC in the future and just STAYS on that. Allow more casual people to experience all of it. That expansion was amazing and expansive. I barely touched half of it and I want to experience more!
---
Undecided
---
On one hand I want to play horde. I strongly consider making a shaman alt, don‚Äôt have to share plate with palas (since I plan on maining Warrior), I like the horde look more. And if I end up on a PVP realm, then it might end up being horde
---
On the other hand, salvation is gonna make tanking easier, human racials are awesome, if I make a Lock alt, then I might have an easier time getting in PUGs because there are likely less. If I pick PVE realm, then it will likely be alliance, also I have an idea that players on PVE realms are more mature on avg
---
Needless to say, I have little idea where I‚Äôm gonna end up, and as what
---
I think you‚Äôre also looking at TBC from the same perspective modern players look at Vanilla from. There were sloggy bits, some poor design choices that have been talked to death on this sub. But there‚Äôs also so many things TBC did perfectly... and I mean that. 
---
Every spec was beautifully reworked. There was so much variety in raids, yet every spec was unique. Just as well, raids and dungeon (difficulty wise) were at the best state they would *ever* be. 
---
So while there are parts that seem a bit of a slog, and flying/dailies progressed WoW in the wrong direction, it still is a lot of people‚Äôs favorites. Im not arguing or anything, just trying to word out what I‚Äôm trying to say. I‚Äôm also just really worried there‚Äôs going to be a vocal minority in the Classic playerbase that is going to ‚Äúwall of no‚Äù the shit out of BC.
---
Isn't nonsense a clean/mild version of bullshit?
---
But he doesn't know yet that he will be glued to classic once he decides to try it
---
Nope.
---
there's been nothing of the sort stated.
---
In fact it's the opposite. They said they're gonna try and recreate the progression of quests and new items similar in progress to when they originally launched.
---
To give as close to an authentic leveling experience as possible during that phase.
---
They even said they only added Mara to phase 1 because it came out so close to release that barely anyone had even hit 60 by then, and so for the vast majority of the initial vanilla players, Mara and it's quests just was a part of the leveling experience.
---
No you aren't reading what is being said. 1 guy goes in sees enemy premade and leaves. No one else joins now ALL 10 get deserter. Not just the 1 guy. That is what was suggested that I was clarifying. I am aware it doesn't work like this normally, this is a suggested change
---
There are many addons like it for BfA, I think it's a fraction of the work to tweak those instead and they're generally even better.
---
At some level that is true, but not really a super helpful sentiment, since following that logic means that Blizzard would have never mentioned Classic existing at all until they were ready for release.
---
Stuff like an open beta isn't something you can just figure out in a whim last minute, you have to have lots of stuff figured it ahead of time.
---
I got into a newer guild at a low level. GM decided to run me and a bunch of other guildies through RFC. I hit need on everything that dropped because "Well greed sounds bad I don't want to be greedy". GM booted me out of the guild. Didn't really care about my explaination. That guild went on to become one of the top raiding guilds on the horde in vanilla and BC.
---
Shrek is ogre.
---
a lot of people were doing dungeons in level 48 leveling greens... which was why they were so hard in the very beginning.
---
7.3.5 addons won't work at all since Classic is running off of the 8.x client.
---
You still need to go to Westfall at lvl 17  to learn screech rank 1.
---
If efficiency is your main concern, really just take a cat.
---
If you want to be cool, just take whatever (Mazranache is the epitome of cool !).
---
Should‚Äôve found a correct screenshot a 22 would see a skull not level.
---
And from where do you come up with this ridiculous notion? Watched a YouTube video?
---
If you do your homework and know how to play efficiently, its not bad. It's not too hard to raidlog in vanilla, but you do have to put in some time to farm every week. The most important thing is mostly having a consistent schedule if you want to raid, play on a server with the appropriate time zone (consider eu or sea servers if you have a wonky schedule).  Obviously most of the folks I play with have jobs, even the nolifers, they just spend all their excess time on the game. The family is what really kills the playing time, as well as schedules that are constantly changing.
---
You don't necessarily have to play a healer, if you're playing more casually you should just play a low pop low farm class (warlock/shaman/hunter).
---
My alt is going to be a hunter, so I'm just looking at some of the gear I might supply him with as he levels up. 
---
For any given bow and gun with the same DPS, if it's a troll hunter would the gun be better because I can apply a scope?
---
If I had to choose I would pick TBC.
---
I am nonetheless stoked over classic.  Its just barely behind TBC in the contest for my heart.
---
MrGM is pretty good.
---
A prequel title, with a sequel meme, in classicwow. What a day
---
Going off of u/busyboots original comment, I wonder how successful or funny a Metalocalypse style show would be, but with mmo devs. A video game so popular that Doritos stocks skyrocket every patch release, and countries go to war to be independent of the game. Like a cross of The Guild, Metalocalypse, and Make Love, not Warcraft.
---
I never got to the point of killing faction leaders. I do remember a time of being a lowly 20 and perusing Stormwind in all it's majestic beauty when, wait, is that a horde coming out of the tram? Oh.. there's a couple of them, exciting! There's gonna be an epic fight here. Oh no, there's like, a LOT of them. Better run away and watch from a distance, oh god, there's twenty or more! RUN!
---
Watching a small horde raid pop out of the Stormwind to Ironforge tram and mercilessly slay the SW population was one of those cool, organice vanilla experiences.
---
The best classic wow podcast out there.
---
your server must have been pretty bad or you were ranking after everyone who cared about rank finished
---
Well then it sounds like you have it narrowed down to three classes that are all reasonably good at accomplishing those goals.
---
As for picking one of those three, only help I could offer is it might help to figure out if you like melee or not, then whether you want lots of combat mobility or not.
---
DnT brings back memories of the old school hardcord raiders.
---
I almost always go Gelkis, but just because I think it's an easier grind and the quest givers are more convenient. I never thought about the ammo.
---
Yeah, I hadn't thought of it but those are very good twink arrows. Looking at some comments online, people are saying they sold them for ~5g on the AH. Mad worth it, but you probably need to sit on them for months till WSG opens and people actually start twinking.
---
so that means i need to make a feral druid for pvp ... or a rogue for those early game graveyard caps ... great
---
Oh, yeah, that might work.
---
Honestly amazing lol, maybe I‚Äôm just easily amused. Love this sub
---
Orc Rogue, or Tauren Druid. 
---
Things that are important to me: 
---
* I want to be a higher performer in both PvE and PvP.
---
* I want to reach 60 quickly and enjoy the power I will have from acquiring good gear. 
---
* Technically challenging classes are a must. As I aim to only focus time on 1 character, I want to make sure that it is challenging fro me throughout Vanilla.
---
My current thoughts on Rogue: 
---
* They seem to perform great in PvE and PvP, with a high skill cap. Also, the option to play Orc is fantastic.
---
* They can 1vX!
---
* They are relatively repetitive and boring to level (When you are focused on powerleveling) 
---
* This likely wouldn't be the ideal class to play with my warrior friend 
---
* They are dependent on their cooldowns - I would dislike having to take a break from the action simply waiting for my blind ability to come up. 
---
* Orcs are sensational for PvP. I don't even mind how ugly they are ! (hah) 
---
* \*\*\*\*What are your thoughts on rogue - what am I missing?\*\*\*\*
---
My current thoughts on Druid: 
---
* They are good in world pvp 1v1s, but not that great for 1vX
---
* They bring a lot of utility to any group they join and are fantastic in BGs. 
---
* They are reasonably good healers - but their damage specs are unideal for raiding. Feral druid is viable, but it takes a considerable amount of potion and item farming. ALSO, you need multiple gear sets to be successful - farming multiple gear sets seems like a hassle. 
---
* Fun to level, and would work great alongside my warrior friend
---
* I should be able to get into raids easily
---
* You get to play a little bit of every role, and there are complicated interactions between druids and other classes, making PvP engaging and challenging
---
* I do not like tauren!! They're too big and broad. A Cow. How can I be a cow?
---
* I love the idea of being fantastic at druid. Most people will think druids aren't good - it will be fun to beat those people. 
---
* \*\*\*\*What are your thoughts on Druid - what am I missing?\*\*\*\* 
---
Thank you to everyone who takes the time to respond! This is my final boss decision before I begin the prep for classic WoW. I've watched both druid and rogue videos, enjoying elements of each.   
---
I would love to gain a better insight into playing rogue and druid, and what your actual experience was like for each.
---
Think some folk don‚Äôt realise that you can‚Äôt stand in a city and just do instances, you need to run there before entering through the door of the instance, as it was in vanilla.
---
land whale feminist destroys gamers with farts and logic
---
This is incredibly untrue you want to get these done as fast as possible no one wants to be in MC for 4h+. And people are going to die, other are going to have to cover you because it apparently elitist to spend 10 gold to not waste 39 others times. You are being selfish if you do this, and you expecting this meme spec dude to be breezing through old content you are just not correctly informed.
---
a wow playing girlfriend and you let her go?
---
I remember putting gear on my action bars because I didn‚Äôt know how to equip items. 
---
Falling off the deep run tram 15 seconds in thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just run all the way‚Äù took me a very long time it was painful. 
---
The most painful was being around 5 or so heading straight to storm wind to spam ‚Äú/yell Gold for the poor plz‚Äù and whispering people for copper/silver/gold. Anything I could get my greedy hands on lol. Then a friend of mine stayed over and spent the gold I acquired on bank slots.. god that hurt.
---
I used damage meters, threat meters and boss mods as early as MC. This was roughly around september of 2005.
---
would love a patch 2.1 tbc server.  could add in ZA, sunwell/isle of qd without the welfare badge changes and leveling revamp shit from 2.3-2.4.
---
The attunements and rep grinds weren't anymore of a slog than vanilla.
---
The majority of streamers would be no problem, but get on asmongolds server and your subject to his whims in one way or another.
---
I mained a druid in early classic (through MC, but not BWL).  When feral still wasn't really a thing, I duo'd a lot of dungeon bosses with a rogue to get my set together for tanking Garr (the one boss they said they'd let me tank :D)
---
I had SO much fun sneaking into dungeons to duo bosses (mother smoulderweb and rattlegore come to mind specifically). 
---
You will share a lot of gear though.
---
Haha, we can only hope :)
---
Absolutely brilliant sir! üòÇ
---
No, ElvUI will work since it's built for the modern client. For pfUI to work the guy will have to do A LOT of work bringing it up to the modern API.
---
Warriors are insanely good.  I have a feeling they might be a little overrepresented though because in hindsight everyone knows they're great and scale amazingly with gear.  You shouldn't let that stop you though.
---
Warriors are really good.  They do kind of level slowly.  But when geared they are really fun.  Never have trouble finding groups if you know how to tank.  Etc.
---
Warriors have many viable specs, from casual tanking/hybrid dps to pure PvP.
---
Paladin, on the other hand, heals.  They heal really well and really efficiently.  In PvP paladins are insane hard to stop healers because of stuns, bubble, and platemail.  They can do stuff with engineering as mentioned.  
---
Ultimately it just depends on what you want to do.  Do you want to PvE in endgame stuff?  If so do you want to heal?  Because that's the easiest way to find raids/groups.  Do you want to dps or tank?  Roll warrior.  PvP either works.
---
Or 10/31/10. Tactical mastery is so good and parry gets you closer to being uncrushable I think.
---
This is all assuming they care enough about classic or the idea to do it of course lol
---
T works, will toggle auto attack against your current target, or pick the closest target in front of you and AA that.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
The Guild is low-key one of the best shows out there. I have so much nostalgia thinking back on younger-me watching that show as they were making the episodes.
---
This ain't Google, this is my living room!
---
Nah it's all intellect.
---
Classic Setting it is boys. This looks like shit.
---
How far can you go in raids with multi boxing ? I have a hard time believing you can get past Ragnaros !
---
does that gnome have headmaster's?
---
I have played on 4 different vanilla private servers, I have raided through BWL on all of these servers. I have raided with super tryhard guilds and with semi-hardcore. I have never had an issue with clearing raid content, and clearing it in a timely manner. I have ran with spriest, ret paladins, feral, boomkins, etc. The game isnt difficult, and it isn't difficult to clear in a timely manner.  
---
I have personally outdps'd tryhard full potting fury warrs/rogues as MS 2h Warrior, just to test it out. The elitist mentality that "The way I I I I I (Eye) I want to clear the raid or clear the content is the best way to do the content "Noone wants to etc" " Is elitist.  
---
When you make the statement "No one wants to" ever, for anything at all. You are being elitist. Because you are claiming your own perspective is the correct perspective and other people could not possible want what you don't want. That is elitism.
---
I had a hunter main, so thinking of starting as a shammy. Will give it a go anyway. May end up back at what I know and playing a hunter üòÄ
---
Similar story, my first character was a nelf hunter and I convinced myself around level 30 that I did more damage with my swords than my bow. Was with a group in Scarlet Monastery melee'ing everything and I'm pretty sure I was rocking Deadmines swords, not the VC sword either because I remember it looked so much cooler than the ones I had.
---
yes.
---
It's all ogre now..
---
I will certainly play every dungeon at least once.  I was never a speed leveler anyway, although I always end up in a serious raiding guild because I like that style, I don't have to be among the first wave of raiders to have fun.
---
Don't be an emo cocksucker. Corpsegrinder will find you and camp your body for an hour.

I broke up with a girlfriend while playing vanilla, I remember it very very well, she had been demanding we get married etc, and we both didn't have any appreciable amount of college work done at that time, we didn't have a plan, her greatest ambition was to be a hair dresser, didn't have great jobs or much of a savings. I knew it would be impossible to get married while having so much against us.
---
So I broke up with her, while I played wow, so I didn't have to look at her. (I feel bad about that, she deserved a better end, but I was young and dumb.) I'm super glad I did it though, it would have been a nightmare, I dodged a huge bullet.
---
Rogues are gods in vanilla. Druid is da poop
---
In AV you 100% care about wins, grinding HK's in AV is really bad.
---
I understand that. I think I am more interested in quickly leveling then raiding/pvp as lock or rogue and having my shaman be the OP rich kid I hop on from time to time to do dungeons and quest with others.  I'm an altoholic and will probably have several alts that I'll do that with.
---
I'd say most of the community hates multi boxing. Probably were insta killed by 5 shamans once :D
---
Some people are really harsh towards it, but It's so good. The last season or two kind of dropped off in quality though, IMO.
---
True, but patience is a small price to pay, especially as I'm leveling either a Priest or Paladin first (hunter will be an alt) so I won't be tempted to use them early on anyways.
---
That‚Äôs weird a few weeks ago people were telling me winter is coming and now summer is already coming?
---
There was community-driven content back in vanilla without the aid of streamers. We had naked gnome runs, 40 Paladins vs 40 Shaman, FTA/FTH... You don't need streamers for that.
---
Corpsegrinder for Warchief. He makes Thrall look like he's got the personality of a rock.
---
It does matter don't listen to him. Warlocks need hit rating so go tailoring. You'll be wearing bloodvine set.
---
10 fucking gold mate, stop being horrible to 39 people over 10 gold.. omg
---
&gt; When you make the statement "No one wants to" ever, for anything at all. You are being elitist. Because you are claiming your own perspective is the correct perspective and other people could not possible want what you don't want. That is elitism. 
---
You are now doing the exact same thing hypocrite jesus... over 10 gold you can't be respectful of 39 people, I doubt you were in any guild with that mindset, me me me me me....
---
Theres a difference between being honest and being an asshole too, and you're just being an asshole.
---
Just charge more for the damn subscription. 30 bucks a month for an unfucked wow is totally acceptable. Inflation has changed the price of a coke from 1 buck to 2 and wows sub cost has done what?
---
Warlocks in PvP tend to go either 20/31/0 for soul link or 30/0/21 for SM/Ruin, which is really only strong with very high crit.
---
For PvE dps warlocks are generally either 30/0/21 or 0/30/21 depending on the needs of the raid and gear levels.
---
Oh yeah I completely agree. The first few seasons were amazing and so, so quirky and original.
---
I think he means "2weeks since it got put on the CDN" which is usually around when PTRs go form there to live. 2-3weeks.

They must not have phones.

Easy. My wife and I for the time being do not live with each other, so my weeknights are 100% my own as is.

Get ogre here!
---
I'd love to see a massive faction battle in hillsbrad/Arathi. Imagine all the 60s in Stromgarde Keep, last faction holding the keep after an hour wins. Other keeps/farms in hillsbrad would host 20-29 or 30-39, etc.
---
Gnome walkers are ok but motorcycles are a major no huh. WotLK was the last bastion of good wow

Compared to enhance sham or spriest, no, it's not.

No, Shrek, no! üò´

&gt;  The old beta build didn't have some values set correctly making it unable to download relevant client files without using a specialized launcher/3rd party tool.

Thats intentional and not a sign of error btw. Incase you didnt know :)

&gt;Is this a good goal to set for myself in wow classic?
---
Lol, no.

This will work.  Classic.db is great for item lookup, itemization is great for what patch it came in
---
Elv UI Is fine :)
---
And what whims would that be on pve server? Looking angrily at you?
---
Horde snowflakes can't take some harmless faction banter i guess üòÇ
---
Was probably 9. Made my orc warrior, and decided I would level just by grinding. Made it all the way to level 23 and was like this game is fucking boring and put it down and probably went outside
---
You don't need it but it creates it at a bigger scale
---
As a healer, yes. But OP is talking about enhance, good luck trying to get a spot with a meme spec like that.
---
Is lock or shadow weaker at a fresh 60?
---
ive tried many times and just cant get into the alliance. Quests feel less fantasy, the lore is mediocre, and the zones feel less like fantasy.    
---
And what kind of gamer plays an RPG and rolls human, anyway? "Oh hey role playing game!  I think Ill be a human!"..
---
Whenever I see these postsI am baffled by no one mentioning resillience. By adding resillience as a stat it trivialised all    raiding content for those who mainly pvp‚Äôed. 
---
The thing Im Looking forward to the most come Vanilla is to start raiding, getting my hand on epic loots and then curb stomping hordes with them. This is what made raiding so great for me.
---
Sure you had some raiding weapons in tbc that were great for PvP, But other than that most of the raiding gear were only viable in PvE. Getting good loot so I could kill other NPCs more efficiently never really resonated with me.
---
TBC didn‚Äôt only Kill world PvP by adding flyging mounts. It also killed raiding for pvp‚Äôers.
---
 * Playing the auction house raises the price of items, meaning regular players need to grind extra to afford things that they would normally be able to afford otherwise.
---
 * If a Goblin buys an item then it means it was priced fairly and it would have sold to a real player if a Goblin snatch it up. That means a Goblin does not "provide liquidity" because that liquidity exists without them.
---
 * Flipping material on the AH does not "provide materials", the materials were already on the AH, but now they are more expensive since they have been flipped. Materials come from killing mobs, not flipping AH.
---
 * Goblins often remove and sequester material from the AH for long periods of time, waiting until they think they can make more profit. Sequestering is the opposite of providing.
---
 * Goblins are the 1%, they hoard wealth by taking advantage of everyday people and return nothing to the community.
---
TBC had a lot of good, but flying mounts and some other design choices put a big damper on my enjoyment of the game. TBC - Flying mounts and im down.
---
I couldnt get past the dailies....
---
pfUI is a clone of ElvUI anyway, and ElvUI will be available for classic.
---
That's fair, I still think that I, personally, need someone that games. I might be into it a little more then most though üòÇ

Premades is a bit like twinking in the sense that the objective is to stomp normal players without 
---
necessarily out-skilling them, sadly I think the grind will be the same.
---
I am pragmatic enough to say that ‚Äùno changes‚Äù is a utopia and this area could definitely use some tinkering with, it would be exciting to experience a different meta where time spent isnt the only decider.
---
It goes up to 50g, stop saying 10g like thats the cap. IT ISNT
---
50g is upwards of 5+ hours of work for some semi-hardcore/casual players. So respeccing is a big fucking deal to them.
---
Can't wait!
---
&gt;You can level to 60 using only your starting items.
---
Well we know that there will be instant 60 level boosts for sale...
---
I liked TBC better because you could actually raid as shadow, enhance, boomkin, etc and not feel like a failure.
---
I am going to make my bank alts, never log into them, and mail them everything for the first 4/5 days.  They dont have to open the mail for 30 days.  By the time I get to 60 I can farm mats for a bank alt to make a ton of bags until full travelers
---
You either have a mind of steel that can withstand anything or you have no mind at all ! ;-)
---
Go warlock, it will be fine and are a very versatile class, ideal for casual solo play.   Based on my pserver experience of the past years there is always a shortage of warlocks, so if you ever decide to play a bit more you will find spots.  Mages are more in demand, but if there 100 mages for every 50 warlocks, that evens it out or even puts warlocks in an advantage. 
---
Word of warning:    the mount at lvl 40 is free, but the one at lvl 60  still requires 400-500 gold in materials to finish the quest.    Also many spells and demon pet spells are quite expensive to train.   This is by design to compensate for the fre mounts.
---
So make sure you don't blindly buy every skill upgrade, as you will end up broke anyway
---
While I'd be perfectly happy with TBC opening someday (and live there about 2/3 of the time), Soon isn't the best word.
---
TBC launched too soon as it was. They really should've held off longer, finished the shaman class review, finished the rebalancing patch which was being held off because the class reviews weren't done, THEN MAYBE released TBC.
---
Only 1% of the player saw Naxx because of TBC. Pretty much as soon as it was announced it killed most of the raiding effort except for the most dedicated. And even a lot of them fell off once the release date announced. Espcially with how punishing naxx is, it's a lot suffer through when know that in 3 months you might not have even downed KT once yet and it's all be pointless.
---
The prepatch was just final nail in the coffin.
---
I'm all for TBC eventually having servers release, but they need to wait until the classic servers have fully matured before they announce it.
---
yes it won't be AS bad since it's not replacing the mechanics it is gonna cause sharp drops in the vanilla crowd since only people who want to do the stuff with the appropriate mechanics will stick around and do it. 
---
The rest who just want to experience the content can do that more easily in TBC.
---
And Vanilla NEEDs a fairly high average pop to be healthy. 500 at a given time at bare minimum, 800 if you want be really safe. (and thats the average amount online at any given time outside of like maybe the absolute peak of off hours. Any less than it becomes frustrating to do anything, and even in a guild with enough people to run stuff, having less than 100 average pop is miserable as you can't do anything pretty much without your guild, and not everyone can play every day, you might only have your full compliment on raid nights and the server die every other day).
---
While yes blizzard easily consolidate the servers down without really messing anything up if it becomes nessecary to do so, it's still something you don't want to pull the trigger on too soon. 
---
Let classic play out, and everyone get their fill, and then when Naxx has gotten more appropriate completion rate among raid progress, THEN consider pulling the trigger on a TBC announcement.
---
Especialyl since you've already got the framework to expand onto, it'sa much easier job than it was making the framework in the first place, so they could probably crap out a TBC 2.0.8 in like 6 months probably of announcement. Well...then again TBC did have everything up to T5 available at release (if T5 was completely broken at the time since they didn't expect people to progress through it so fast)....so it might take a bit longer to ensure thing is working right.
---
My first character was a Rogue. I picked a Night Elf rogue after looking at the racials and seeing Shadowmeld. Thought that blending into the shadows fit into the Rogue playstyle, not knowing that they had stealth already.  
---
Playing that character after the starting area did that question for the Saytr. The follow up to that was where they tell you that because you helped him you need to do something or they would kick you out of the alliance. I actually thought I would be kicked be out of the faction.  
---
After a bit of time, I decided to switch to a warrior. After leveling, I went into a UBRS group. When I got into the group, they asked me where my shield was because I needed to tank. I didn't even know what a tank was, and I certainly didn't have a shield.  
---
So, started looking into tanking, got a shield. A long while later started raiding and went into Zul'Gurub. Rolled on a shield there because it had better armor and stamina than what I had... but also had intellect, because it was a shaman shield. I won the roll, Vent exploded with profanities and the group dissolved.
---
Agree. If they are really trying to release a finished product, people are severely underestimating alpha/beta lengths. I suspect a public 2 week beta would generate enough bugs to keep the devs busy for another 2 months. In which time, they'd probably release a couple waves of beta builds.
---
So if they really just started alpha and no beta announced yet, we are still a long ways off from a release if really focusing on quality. Unless the devs really went crazy since the demo, better checking their work as they go. Because that demo showed they had overlooked quite a bit at that point.
---
Do you have spare just in case ? \^\^
---
So bigger PvP battles are not better then smaller ones?
---
No, you're right. I was mistakenly remembering a warr or rogue vid or something where the weapon specialization mattered.
---
He was just trying to make some thicc dryads. They came out thick in the head instead.
---
Holy Paladins are the best PvP healers and it's not even close
---
Can heal 5 mans handily enough but honestly you are more likely to get in to a decent Raiding Guild if you play your Shadow Priest as a Shadow Priest. There is space for one as a DPS but the idea of risking a wipe because you have a sub-optimal healer isn't the sort of thing any good raid leader would contemplate.
---
But I think you would have most success by agreeing to heal until the +Shadow gear is available, then switching to Shadow at some point during BWL when it's no longer one of the worst PVP specs. This can easily be agreed with a guild in advance if are a good healer.
---
50 gold takes 30 min... pure lies, it‚Äôs 2 and a half stacks of 60 herbs, and why would you get to 50g with you respeccing according to you it doesn‚Äôt matter talents only change a character by ‚Äú20%‚Äù
---
Depends on who leads and sets it up. You could have a 5 man run worse then a 500 man event
---
I am heavily torn between **Rogue, Mage,** and **Warrior**. I mained my rogue all through vanilla with 200+ days played and loved him. Thunderfury and all. I feel I have mastered the class. I remember making a horde-warrior alt and feeling so much stronger once I obtained gear (pvp mostly, unstoppable force). I felt like the stance dancing and play style actually fit my skills better, and I had so much fun on that warrior. The main thing is that I am concerned with the talent+dmg adjustments in 1.12 as a rogue. I want to be able to feel strong and 1v1 almost anything, but I remember rogues took a large hit in 1.12. Would you recommend I go warrior or just something completely different and play a mage Vurtne style? Will be raiding, grinding pvp, and overall fully enjoying classic. 
---
Thanks all!
---
There are a bunch of Warcraft books that provide good back-story for most of the lore in WoW. I don't know what kind of videos cover these books, though - other than the Warcraft movie that was out a few years ago -  and was a little hard to follow imo.
---
It would be very fun and give user generated content for years to come
---
Yeah everything in terms of questing was terrible about cataclysm.  I still thought the designs of the areas were good.  I particularly liked updated desolace.
---
But yes, losing weather sucked.
---
I like both games separately.  I do agree a TBC reboot would be great, but let me have a few years of classic first.  Actually, give me 5 or so years with classic first.  The hype for TBC will be so huge after that
---
Yes, but it realistically it is just going to be a bunch of meme'y kids trying to be annoying, spurting out racial slurs, and generally get in the way of w/e the streamer is doing.
---
No its way better cause r14 rogue is shit ;)
---
But jea for a caster r14 often makes more sense but its not like rank 14 is bad for them, casters just benefit from weapons abit less.
---
For Shadowpriest even the Rank 14 Staff would be better then the Nerf staff, and you can make the same argument with Ashkandi for melees. Or even Perdition's Blade for rogues, Rank 14 is almost never worth the effort.
---
This is true, if they go with low pop cap (2-3k), expect a lot of dead servers in no time, so if you don't want to risk ending up in one of those, I'd consider rolling on a streamer server, not too big like soda or asmon, but small to medium is good because you always have a great influx of new players, and people sticking with the server.
---
gnomergon is where it was at
---
No DKs in phase 1 though (even if they are implemented they will count for nothing).
---
Compare to Jom Gabbar, ilvl 81, drops from a tricky boss near the end of AQ40:
---
&gt;Use: Increases attack power by 65 and an additional 65 every 2 sec. Lasts 20 sec. (cooldown 2 min)
---
This is an average of 358 AP over 20 seconds. Over one minute, however, it is an average of 119 AP. The flask is 150 AP over one minute.
---
Over two minutes, Jom Gabbar is 60 AP while the flask is 75. 
---
In other words the level 50 item is more AP than AQ40 loot on fights shorter than 2 mins.
---
Of course, this doesn't take into account the fact that burst AP is better than sustained AP because you can time it for DPS windows on bosses and personal cooldowns, but should sort of demonstrate why Classic itemization was sometimes kinda... weird.
---
That's true, human is kind of bland when given a choice.  It's usually the well rounded average character.  Not great ant anything in particular.  Maybe a bit more social.
---
Sure, but the issue back in the day (early vanilla) was that people would ask when a specific patch would drop and Blizzard's CMs would give them a specific date. When they had to delay that specific date for whatever reason, the forums exploded with outrage and accused Blizzard of lying or being unable to deliver.
---
So yes, they probably have an idea of when they want everything to launch, but they're probably not going to tell us unless they're certain that it isn't at a high risk of being delayed. People also usually only find out about betas when they drop in their e-mail inbox to begin with.
---
Oh I didn't realize you don't understand the difference between private server economy, and likely vanilla server economy. Secondly knowing where and what to farm is knowledge that only players who play the game a LOT (Hardcores) and some semi-hardcores have. Most players make around 10g per hour on average when farming from lack of knowledge or wrong professions etc.
---
Lastly I didn't say 80% of output comes from player skill I said its 80% more infuential than talents. So if you get +20 hps from talents, you get 80% more (or 180%) which is +36hps just from cleaning up your rotation. But I understand how not reading and talking out your ass are your strong suits. I've dealt with enough elitist players to understand that thinking you are right is the most important thing, not understanding what your opposition is saying.
---
Joke's on you, never started a family to be ready for this moment.
---
I would say 8/31/12 if you're going to go that route, going 10 into Prot and not getting Last stand and Imp is silly. No reason to go into Prot without at least those 2 talents
---
Whose being elitist now lol
---
I mained a ret paladin in vanilla... it's kind of rough, you'll get super kited a lot.
---
dont tell the elf
---
I think streamers are going to have a hell of a rough go at it, so much farming you have to do to be end game prepared, if not on a PvE they might be just continually ganked.
---
Taking over a zone.  Easily cornering any market on the AH.
---
Im being condescending not elitist. Small and subtle difference, but to someone who aggressively pushes his own agenda and refuses to look at the game from a perspective with less time/knowledge it is completely invisible.
---
Charging 30 a month for a game with no new content would be crazy.
---
Especially when there is a "private coke" thats free ;)
---
Speaking of coke, a drug dealer wouldnt charge you crazy amounts the first time you buy from him.
---
He wants you to be addicted and stay a customer for a long time and then maybe charge you otherwise later.
---
Why would a company producing addicting games be any different?
---
It scales after everything is calculated. If you're min/maxing gnome is better in pvp/pve. It'll equate to 1% or less dps increase over human.
---
Downsides are you get that passive "kill every gnome on sight", as well as swimming/dismounting in shallower water.
---
Human gets that sweet 10% increased rep too.
---
Yes but rok can last quite a long time until you get lucky and get ashrethul.
---
Do it like a druid is so much better 15 years later and understanding english.
---
If you're going to play at launch then the 16s you get for vendoring these when you're level 32 during week 1 is worth more than the 5g at level 60 during month 6 when people are willing to pay 2.5s per arrow for their BG ALT.
---
If you're coming in late and don't have to sit on them for months then it is totally worth it for the 5g at level 32.
---
Mods please drop classic wow
---
Sure thing. Come on in.
---
I leveled rogue/hunter and we blitzed to 30.  We never stopped pulling, we never stopped to regain resources, and we skipped many levels of skillups because we barely needed them.  I went the unorthodox BS/crit spec, and he went BM.  We killed mobs in about 7-9 seconds, skinned another 3 secs, moved another 3 secs to another mob, and repeated.  Most downtime was flying.  Druid hunter would work similarly, as Im sure demonology warlock/rogue.  Obviously up to your partner on what they want to play.
---
Do t describe yourself like that, and no 100% both elitist and selfish it‚Äôs a really sad combo to see. Good luck finding people who would want to play with you
---
I did specifically say I'm not asking about timelines though, so I'm not sure why that topic keeps coming up...
---
To compare it to the patch process, it would be like  Blizzard refusing to acknowledge the existence of a coming patch entirely.
---
I mean don't get me wrong I'm def going to mail those arrows to my bank alt and AH them later, 5g is 5g. Amazing reward for an easy quest, just don't get hasty and throw them on right away.
---
I rolled a human rogue as one of my first toons and when I got to the poisons quest, I got frustrated trying to complete it.  So I just said screw it and re-rolled Hunter.
---
Regardless of their impact on community driven content (which will exist either way) I‚Äôd rather stay clear of their edgy orbiters turning /2 into Twitch chat.
---
But it can be...
---
I did the grind back then. I plan to do the grind again. That frostsaber is my favorite mount in the game.
---
Sure looks like it
---
Pick a class that intrests you and once you are bored make a new one. Thats what I did the first 3 years.
---
There are no rules to follow. Do what ever you like. People dont expect anything from you and just learn at your own pace.
---
Going to ignore the last two points because they don't have anything to do with the main point of "flipping items" in AH. Manipulation is different, and the other is a latestagecapitalism rabbit hole that doesn't really warrant a response. 
---
If someone offers mats on AH for much lower than the going rate, it means they value immediacy of transacting over the actual amount of gold they receive. An opportunist who doesn't mind waiting a few hours or days of holding inventory is going to buy it up and offer it for a higher price. When a buyer of mats comes in, hours or days later, they may need more size than the AH would normally have. By having flippers/opportunists laying their offers higher and waiting for sales, there's more supply for the size buyers.
---
So by facilitating the buyers and sellers, by holding inventory and being willing to wait, opportunists are providing gold liquidity to those who need gold, and mats liquidity to those who need mats. This is the essence of market making and has existed for hundreds of years in plenty of capacities.
---
I mean if you get ten bad actors in a battle of 500 then they get reproved and banned in game and then teabagged by the opposing faction
---
no.
---
Blizzard don‚Äôt give a shit lol
---
Barren chats existed before twitch lmao
---
Parents. Inheritance.
---
It‚Äôs more common than you think.
---
If you use a racial slur you are getting at a minimum a time out
---
No
---
Changes
---
FYI that guy has no idea what he's taking about. There is no mount journal in classic.
---
On the bright side there would be less shit to sift through to find something worth watching.
---
I hear this a lot but I kind of disagree. I work full time and I'm a student and I still have plenty of time to play games. 
---
I have a girlfriend, apartment, okay paying job, and I still make time to play games 3 to 4 hours a day. 
---
I still make sure all my important things are done like chores and finances after I get home from work. Only takes 45 minutes a day to do important stuff. Then I can game all night.
---
I do sacrifice sleep for games, but I can function quite well off of only 5-6 hours of sleep. 
---
I guess my point is that people have different priorities. I'm a game Dev. I love games. Playing them, talking about them, and building them. I make time daily to play games because I love it. If you don't want to make more time to play. I make time to do it because I love to do it.
---
 /join LFG works. I really don't think there was a 50 person cap, but feel free to prove me wrong.
---
In what, 2h or 2days? Blizzard won‚Äôt monitor it that hard
---
Agreed. These TBC posts are getting old too
---
I did just that back in the days to improve my English skills, but I used to focus on quest text where the language in typical RPG fashion is formal and old fashioned.
---
The fun part is that when I actually started to have to speak in an  English speaking environment, my English was still heavily influenced by this. So for a while because I did not know any better, I ended up using at work expressions like "to harry" or "to concern oneself with" etc until I took the hint most of these sound positively 1800s nowadays.
---
F5 F5 F5

That only applies to raids, ferals are excellent dungeon tankers.
---
I got a ban for dropping an f bomb in barrens chat back in the day
---
Hahaha nope.
---
The only change people can get behind? Have you been reading this sub at all?
---
Join a guild, /w people of the appropriate level/class, and/or spam trade. It's not hard.
---
Actually no they didn't. There was an actual black dragon that aggroed me from 500 yards away right as I crossed that lava bridge. I was in combat mode and yet didn't see any enemy. Until I got OS'ed by a black drake out of the blue.
---
I would add Shadowfang Keep to that list.
---
I'll be going mage In classic and am really stuck on what professions to pick. I'm heavily leaning towards skinning for gold and tailoring for bags and then bis robes. Thoughts?
---
few updates to it today too, maybe something soon
---
rip life i once had.
---
Whilst helpful, the aim of wow classic (from Blizzards point of view) is to restore WoW to its pre-tbc state.
---
No changes.
---
Take all my energy and spirit bomb everyone's doubt!
---
If you think people on here would get behind ANY change, then you haven't been paying attention
---
I was playing EverQuest (for awhile in a top guild) when I was that age. I played vanilla WoW super casually, but by that time university had started to take over my life and I quit around patch 1.5 or 1.6. By the time I came back to retail, it was Cataclysm, and the game was almost unrecognizable.
---
I still play, and I still like it. But it was such a huge departure from my WoW memories of 2004 ("I can't believe they're enforcing such small raid sizes -- only 40 people"). 
---
I still dip into classic versions of EverQuest for the same reason your generation is psyched about Classic; it was a huge part of my childhood. But I'm completely and ridiculously hyped about Classic because I never quite got to experience it the way I wanted to.
---
Fresh level 60 mage, never been in a raid nor did I know what a raid was.  Got invited to Kazzak raid as I was a mage in the zone and they were short on mages/druids.  Join up with great confidence in my dps capability!  Little did I realize the primary reason a raid would invite a rando mage to their group was to remove curses.  I had hardly seen a curse in the game yet, I didn't even have remove curse on my toolbar...
---
Not only did I not decurse very well (default UI and what is the icon for the curse????) but worse, I got the curse myself, didn't realize, and exploded the raid, with my name showing up in everyone's dmg logs (doing 50k dmg or whatever it is from dying).   The mage who couldn't decurse even himself and wiped the raid.  Good times.
---
Oh for sure, don't misunderstand me, TBC is hands down my favorite expac. FWIW I started playing wow December the year it came out. I've played most of the expansions, but only for a month or two each after wotlk. WOD is the only one I completely skipped.
---
I feel like Blizz really learned from their design decisions from vanilla, saw the underrepresented specs and gave them a reason to be there. Also reduced the raid size which lowered the barrier of entry into raids. Arenas were an awesome addition to pvp and the balance was a little more interesting than being bursted down. Professions actually felt rewarding instead of meaningless. IIRC, a lot of the early BIS was from tailoring or BSing. 
---
I will say I'm not sure any of you remember needing to grinding out to exalted just to run heroic dungeons, and all of those required different reps to get the heroic keys. This WAS a slog, I even thought so back then. I can't remember anything like this sort of grind in Vanilla, which doesn't mean there wasn't one, but the other poster that replied to me seems to think there is. The attunement for kara was pretty interesting and at the time I thought it was cool... but I don't think vanilla had any attunement requirements that were very close to that. 
---
At the end of the day I think we agree. TBC is awesome, but I think we can also agree that nothing is perfect. There will be things some people enjoy and others won't. For me, the rep grind is not all that great. That madness started with TBC and has been a staple in every expac since.
---
Changes.
---
.
---
I'm under the impression that bag drop rates are way lower on retail than portrayed in pservers where I get 4 bags by Lv 15 isn't realistic.
---
But that's a good point to recycle bags by sending to your alts.
---
My first character was a tauren warrior. At around level 20 I wandered into WC, died to a raptor, and wondered why it was so strong. I thought it was a bug. Didn't know what an elite was or even notice the gold dragon around its portrait.
---
On the same warrior, I decided to see how big the world was. I ended up running all the way down to the Molten Span and being in awe at the beautiful environment. I died many times and took many screenshots. Hearthed out after that. I couldn't believe how big and detailed the world was.
---
I can't wait for Classic.
---
In addition to what /u/garrote said, beta length for other games isn't a good metric for Classic because Blizzard seems pretty adamant about a summer release date, and if Classic beta was as long as an xpac beta, it would push it out of that release timeframe
---
LFG is quite possibly the single most destructive change blizzard ever introduced into the game. 
---
You don't have to know anyone. You don't have to interact with anyone. Its awful.
---
Sure. I think all the streamers should focus on a few realms and both factions on each realm to make sure it's even. Truthfully, streamers weren't at all the vanilla experience, so keep them siloed away.
---
There was a clause that said that you couldnt use it as an insult or an attack iirc, Ie you can say "Fucking raptors" but not say "You are a Fuckwit"
---
I know you're not asking about timelines, but people keep bringing up the topic because it was those events that made Blizzard so tight lipped about saying anything in the first place.
---
We don't even know if Blizzard will do an open beta at all. The only open beta that Blizzard has done for WoW was at the end of vanilla, but there's never been a open beta for any of the other expansions.
---
The point being, if Blizzard does have a closed or open beta, we probably wont hear about it until people either start getting e-mails or they announce it right before the servers go out. That's the way it's been for years. They probably have an idea of when they'd like to do it, but they're not gonna announce it until they're ready to go.
---
Well, the cost hasnt gone up or kept up with inflation and the result is the in game store, tech cost saving moves, and shittier games. I'm just saying I'd be willing to pay more, and I'm not alone there.
---
Think about it for a minute, private servers don't have that authentic feel, they don't have any kind of security or permanence. What's the user base difference between private servers and retail? When if you ask around retail is by far the shittier product? 
---
Think about the cost per hour of entertainment for wow. Even at 30 a month it is still the cheapest form of entertainment now a days. 
---
You all want this product to be perfect just the way you like it, well if they need to maintain a certain level of profit I'd rather just pay more upfront than see them ruin the game by cutting other corners or having an ingame store.
---
You sometimes and can have your cake and eat it too, but don't expect it.
---
First meme is making a joke about things that happen in Classic WoW. Second meme is making fun of the entry-level nature of that joke. Third meme is making fun of the meme making fun of the joke. 
---
I fall into the elitisty camp making fun of the first joke. Third meme is basically the reaction of the person that made the original entry-level joke.
---
By your logic a bigger electricity bill is better than a smaller one.
---
Have you been on the moonguard server when someone like asmon gets bored hops on and then its filled with twitch chat crap and ruining other peoples idea of enjoyment on the designated place for that enjoyment? 
---
Community driven content is based entirely on its well.. community. If that community is 1 or 2 big streamers good for them but be prepared for the problems it brings mainly shite stability and the inevitable barren server when they get bored. The same applies for popular guilds. 
---
Community is a fluid thing it can be good and bad, when the community decides to type MonkaS in trade for 1 hr solid i think ill change server thnx
---
Ye olde gife.
---
I was telling a gold farmer to stfu. We know how bad they were in barrens chat. But fair enough I did direct it at them
---
I don't think you should post a suggested change and claim that 'everyone can get behind it'. Especially considering the sub you're posting in
---
No wife, no kids, just a full-time job with 40 hours a week, few hobbies and seeing friends and family. I get to play plenty everyday, lucky me. 24 years old
---
We often see these kind of topics :  
---
"Never or barely played Vanilla, started at TBC/WotLK. Can't wait for Classic TBC/WotLK !".  
---
While some might prefer later Xpacs over Vanilla, I'm eager to see (read) how many will understand and enjoy the differences Vanilla carried.
---
Holy shit, I remember Tossme.  He was always an elite priest.  Crazyyyyyy
---
Right. No one wants to watch a (male) streamer just grinding all day, and it'll open themselves up to so much ganking/griefing. I think/hope the streamer thing is overrated, since it's just a pretty bad format for the mega-streamers.
---
Whilst I still agree with no changes  at all...
---
I think you're thinking of the wrong LFG - OP means the original LFG where it only listed groups looking to join a dungeon, you still had to whisper them and get them to invite you etc.  OP doesn't mean the auto-lfg system.
---
If your Shadow is UD i would argue its almost Shadow = WL, but since there will be no shadow gear in p1 warlock will outgear shadows insanely fast as soon he starts MC.
---
And ofc SL overall is a monster you will never beat as Shadow, but without any type of gear SL WL has his struggels too.
---
They would prob get a short ban for racial slurs though I agree, I just think by that point the damange may be done
---
You guys should go look at the OPs other great thoughts that he as posted elsewhere. Some duseys in there.
---
What about a tanking set? Cuz the short time I played on private servers, it was way harder to find a tank than a healer. I know warriors are the best, but when you've been spamming General chat for 40 minutes for a tank, I'm ecstatic to have a Feral druid tank or even a pally tank just to start the damn thing.

  We are a hardcore 40 man raiding guild based on the West Coast.Our faction is Alliance with no intentions of going horde.  Core members have a wide range of experience ranging from US and World competitive Naxxaramas clears in original Vanilla and Private Servers to server first endgame content up to current retail WoW;¬†as well as multiple PvP achievements¬†including but not limited to¬†rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 gladiators across every expansion, Hero of the Alliance/Horde and even pro gaming experience¬†across various games.  We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining. We expect you to know your class, game mechanics, and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic. We pride ourselves on using raiding time so efficiently that it doesn‚Äôt require an exponential amount of time to clear content.

Hello Shattered Hand vets
---
Hey, sounds really interesting ! Sent you a req. on discord to have a chat
---
That is true. And you will always have bad actors. Any user made events will deal with this and streamers will probably deal with it worse cause they bring in bigger crowds
---
I was looking to play a SM/Ruin lock so I can be decent in raids and PvP so I don‚Äôt have to constantly respec
---
Yep and like atlan said you can hold things in the mail until you send them over.
---
&gt; What are your tactics on not completely pissing your wife off?
---
Gradual exposure
---
I remember people doing 10-man Scholo/Strat pugs for their Tier 0 pieces.  I think those two were capped at 10.  And UBRS was capped at 15.  Then they reduced them to 5 and 10 respectively.  The dungeon raids were just mindless zergs, and I remember having a hard time getting Scholo/Strat quests done because everyone just wanted to raid it for easy/quick loot.  I'm glad they reduced the cap to force people to run the content as intended.
---
You‚Äôre a rogue, there‚Äôs a million things you can do to reset and special abilities don‚Äôt miss as often.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. lol
---
That's a perfect example of blowing streamer influence out of proportion in my opinion. I can see a streamer giving a general direction for his viewers but they are not an army of loyal soldiers. They won't farm whatever material for hours for their overlord. That's not how twitch chat works at all.
---
Streamer would have to make some incredibly entertaining event to pull something like that and that itself could be good for the server's community. It could also be bad but you can't make great things happen without risks.
---
preist here
---
I doubt streamer are going to have fun with classic, it really just isnt geared towards them. Prob going to make a lot of them upset because to do that job you have to be a narcissist of some degree
---
Are you guys going to continue raiding once BGs come out, or is PvP the primary focus?
---
Could you let know a little more about any specific reasoning behind this idea?
---
How do you figure when the variety streamers move on and all you have left is their twitch chat spewing followers.  Instant ghost town.
---
I mean, if you've ever played a game in your life without reading a guide and tried to understand how something works the language is pretty clear.  
---
As well I don't have to stress with finding people want to play with me, I'm not worried. Atleast the people I play with genuinely want to play with me, and don't see me as a number on a spreadsheet.
---
There are addons that help with LFG.  I do not want Blizzard to add their LFG tool to Classic, nope, no thanks.
---
Unsubbed since early WoD, and will be returning now with Classic being re-released.
---
If you need to strip mine the base game isn‚Äôt healthy.
---
I really really liked Karazhan. It was small, and each member was critical. Thay being said, there were features added that I just didn't like. PvP became more about grinding for pvp-stat gear instead of using what the world provided like in vanilla. Flying was obviously annoying and made world pvp ridiculous. Get jumped from above, and run away long enough you can just immediately disappear into the proverbial clouds. If given a choice, I absolutely pick Vanilla.
---
we will keep the same raid days and continue to raid, just we are going to do a lot of PvP and premades so we hope we can find a few people that will want to do that also. but raiding wont stop with BGs
---
as mentioned below.. use world channels... e.g. "/join lfg; /join world"
---
Feral Druid FC?
---
Wowhead classic will most likely be the defacto go to
---
D2jsp
---
&gt;if Classic beta was as long as an xpac beta, it would push it out of that release timeframe
---
That's my point, though. I don't think they'll hit that target. It's May, and we don't have a release date. I think it'll be out sometime this year -- maybe the 15th anniversary. I obviously hope I'm wrong. I can't wait to play.
---
&gt;since following that logic means that Blizzard would have never mentioned Classic existing at all until they were ready for release.
---
That isn't remotely true.  They announce something when they know they are making it, hence why Titan was never really announced.  And they announce a release date when they know they are going to hit it.  They aren't perfect, TBC was pushed back, SC Ghost was announced and canceled, and BFA was rushed, or just generally shit, but overall it's a good strategy that tends to limit disappointment.
---
Sadly, people are going to get a lot of half truths and straight up wrong info
---
/join lookingforgroup, nuff said.
---
They haven't necessarily done "open" betas for expansions, but they definitely had large betas that were known about months ahead of time.
---
Battle for Azeroth had beta signups that started in November, and the beta starting the following April.
---
Christ dude calm down. That's not how it works.
---
Vanilla content is progressive; you still get relevant gear from MC if you are a new character when ZG comes out, it's not like modern wow where each new raid comes with a catch-up set.
---
If you released everything at once, you realize the server would be fucked, right? HC Guilds would steamroll through content by holding monopolies on world buffs and rare spawns early, overgear everyone else, and would stop PvP with AQ sets when everyone else is just starting BWL. The economy would go insane if fresh 60 hunters started spamming trib runs making 60g+/hr when most players have 100g total. It'd be an absolute clusterfuck, that's why people more experienced than you advocated for progressive content. It's to slow power gamers down, not "appease a bunch of youtube spergs".
---
Wtf no.
---
Came here to post this
---
... For some reason, I still like having auto-attack on my hot bar. Not sure why, but sometimes I'll play vanilla on a private server on my laptop in bed, left hand holding my phone and watching Netflix, right hand on my mouse on a mousepad. It's an MMO mouse, so I can control the abilities from there, and I can just auto-run with the middle mouse button. For whatever reason, on melee characters, I've just kept it in the 1 slot.
---
Maybe not exactly what you asked, but as a pro tip you can go to classic DB, pick for example a zone and then sort by reward. That way you get a quick overview of quest rewards. 
---
There are usually only a few that are really noteworthy by zone for each class so this is easy to do
---
I disagree, having to grind the reps just to do each reps respective end game 5man(s)? I don't believe there was anything like that in vanilla. Maybe you mean numerically, which you are correct you need to fill up the same bar 3-4 times. Also compare karas attunement to mc or bwl.
---
I'd argue you need at least 13 point in discipline as fast as you can get it for regen.
---
&gt;Going to ignore the last 2 points because it is too hard to argue with obvious truth
---
FTFY
---
&gt;If someone offers mats on AH for much lower than the going rate, it means they value immediacy
---
Or they recognize that the "going rate" is a price fix from Goblins, and they value selling their goods to legitimate players for a fair price rather than taking advantage of legitimate players.
---
&gt;By having flippers/opportunists laying their offers higher and waiting for sales, there's more supply for the size buyers.
---
This is backwards. There would be less need to bulk buy if Goblins didn't create artificial scarcity.
---
&gt;This is the essence of market making and has existed for hundreds of years
---
The key point you're missing is that IRL there can be value added from middlemen, that is the only reason they exist. Perhaps a farmer does not have time to go to town and sit around all day to sell their own goods, so they sell to a merchant for cheap and then that merchant sells to people for more. That does not exist in WoW. The farmers put up their goods on the AH, then the Goblins relist the same item on the same AH for more. There is no value being added by Goblins for either the original seller nor the final buyer.
---
Where do you pick this quest up from?
---
Do you have any advice for the mage quest?
---
EDIT: That is until my hot bar gets filled up, then I replace 1 with my most used ability and hope that I don't get thrown off by moving all of my abilities around. My mom always clicked the abilities, which I never understood.
---
I'm going to be pragmatic.  I will probably try to do dungeons I have quests for but won't wait around until after I outlevel them.
---
Yeah , no
---
First time i killed her i took like 100 screenshots in diffrent angles and my troll cheering. Good times.
---
This is a good point. I had been primarily against cross realm BGs, but it is becoming less of a sticking point for me. When I want to enter a BG, I have decided I like relatively instant gratification in that realm. Although, when I a queue wouldn‚Äôt immediately pop, I‚Äôd tend to go world PvP which probably had a net positive impact on the immersive nature of the game.
---
But queue dodging isn‚Äôt something I had considered.
---
Streamers could cause an overflow in population on servers. I will attempt to avoid a streamer server at all costs. When Swifty quit his realm the entire realm died. If you join the same server as a major streamer and they quit you will be totally fucked in server pop. I suggest avoiding them at all costs.
---
How about find one in real life that way you know you‚Äôre dealing with
---
For like 2 weeks and then she'll say something, I'll randomly stop for like a week and then pick back up. Constant battle for sure. lol
---
That's my second auto-run key.
---
Not sure what to play, but I really wanna tank or healer because I simply love group playing. I've played warrior back in the original vanilla days up to MC/ZG and was a pretty good tank. But getting a tank spot in a raid isn't as easy as in 5 man groups and I'm not sure if I'd be happy playing warrior dps.
---
Healer on the other side should be quite easy to get into a raid... But given my tanking experience healer isn't my first choice. Another thing to consider: farming stuff. Very likely I will not have time for an alt because I work very much.
---
No. Splitting server types are carebear move that will kill the community. Separating everyone is a bad idea. The game works in a very simple way. Put more time and effort then Jimmy and you will get better gear eventually. That's it. If Jimmy doesn't have time for that too bad for him.
---
Babe, why did you get me a weeks worth of spa certificates back-to-back days for the end of summer?
---
Blizz can easily make these sorts of things not work if they want to, just like they did with the auto group finder World Quest addon.
---
Dear god I'm old as fuck thanks for reminding me.
---
Thanks for the helpful response. If this is indeed the case then that is more than enough for me. People attacking me or attacking my post history can F right off though.
---
Spamming in trade chat while your group heads to the dungeon for summoning is the only way to play WoW.
---
I live with my girlfriend, but thankfully she's pretty chill about it  I asked her if she'd mind if I played WoW Classic and she said "no, of course not". I don't think she realizes what playing WoW Classic actually entails lol. But we have different work schedules, and sometimes she'll want me to hang with her. But that usually entails watching tv with her, and she doesn't mind if a passively play a game at that time. So I'm pretty set!
---
&gt;If I was a streamer I don't think I would tell people
---
They are going to be streaming though... They will have anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand people seeing their info as soon as they log in.
---

---
Check out Lore Whore on YouTube. I don‚Äôt think he is still making content, but his lore videos are awesome. I also have started making Lore videos about the dungeons in Classic if you‚Äôre interested.
---
&gt; What are your tactics on not completely pissing your wife off? 
---
We're going to be playing together! I honestly hit the jackpot with her lol
---
keep in mind i was 4-6 years old throughout vanilla;
---
i set my dad's lvl 60 main's hearth to westfall, repeatedly, because i liked the sparkle effect it made when you changed your hearthstone location
---
whenever i fell into the stormwind canals or those middle sections in ironforge, i would start crying because i didn't know how to get out and i thought i would be stuck there forever
---
i thought my character functioned exactly like a real life person and i would stop every so often to make my character eat and drink, at full health+mana, therefore wasting a LOT of food
---
reddit discourse is maybe a millimeter higher than facebook on the scale, dude
---
If only there was a version of the game that held your hand and made sure that it was impossible for you to fall too far behind the people on the bleeding edge of PvE and PvP content.
---
So, it's not remotely true, but also true because they've cancelled projects in the past. Got it...
---
I've been trying a warrior in both a vanilla private server and in retail recently (picked it up again a little over a week and a half ago). I've been taunting everything that isn't looking at me. Feels kinda satisfying, actually. Never really was a warrior guy before. I was always a Tauren Druid main.
---
My post in r/Judaism was denouncing an anti-semite. Context is key, loser.
---
NO CHANGES!!!! :&lt;&lt;
---
People are vicious in this subreddit, makes me worry about the general toxicity/elitism of people who we will eventually be playing with.
---
In the same vein, I didn‚Äôt know there was an inn in westfall for months.  Just never checked.  Always flew back to SW to log out when leveling there.
---
It was the casual push that many point to as the reason so many people who played in classic dislike the current state of the game.
---
That is fairly clear. You've got some other goodies.
---
I'd watch you watching it.
---
Streamers are a blight on online gaming.
---
Well that happened to me too. Except I remember how I accidentally got there.  
---
I was questing in the area and had to kill nagas or some shit for some quest in Zoram.   
---
I stumble on a structure that looks different than the rest of the ruins. I investigate. I go down. And Down. And Down.  
---
And in the cave. I explored a bit but avoided fights as much as possible because I figured from the loading screen this had to be a dungeon. Though I had not done any as of yet.
---
If you don't show the realm they have to go find you.  It delays it a bit.
---
No I can't wait to gank the crap out of all of the casuals and tourists as I way over gear them all LOLOLOLOL
---
You must be watching a different Asmongold.
---
My guess is they noticed that it did not even break 100 likes, while threads calling for the older version were getting comparative tons more love.
---
It's the George Costanza "never happened" strategy.
---
There were no summoning stones in classic wow. Meeting stones were changed to summoning stones in 2.0.
---
But I guess the elitisim of this subreddit means that the only way to form a pug group is spamming /trade chat in a major city. Anything else would somehow detract from the classic experience LOL
---
Whats not remotely true is what I quoted, by that logic they wouldn't have announced Classic.
---
I would still argue it corrodes the community. You don't have to "know" anyone aka save them to your friends list to contact later. If you can just plug yourself into a list it's not the same as engaging with people.
---
The only change should be to be able to change the order of your characters on the character screen.
---
Rest assured though that Jimmy will make many posts like these in an effort to make things easier on him.
---
"LF1M Mara Princess run"
---
"ohhhhh a princess, I wonder who we're rescuing from this dungeon? Probably a night elf who's been captured by these dastardly Satyrs"
---
*gets to final boss*
---
"Ah, or that"
---
I'm interested in climate change, sustainability issues, and artificial intelligence? Oh the horror.
---
Blizzard is seriously considering not having an entire server type (RPvP) simply to keep people centralized.  There's no way in hell this would happen.
---
Wow I guess I wasn‚Äôt the only one that quit shortly thereafter. It‚Äôs like climbing Mt. Everest, after that what else is there to do?
---
Everything pales in comparison.
---
I'll give you that, but I think expansions that are creating game and art assets from the ground up probably do need a very specific beta process like that.
---
I did some quick googling and this was updated 3 hours ago, but still seems to fall in line with my prediction: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/194729
---
If they're opting to do a beta at all, we'll probably only hear about it via e-mail.
---
But if I ever get you from full health to zero, know that I will feel like I won, no matter how many times you crushed me!
---
Right? Wow I can‚Äôt believe my comment was downvoted.
---
Iamcold is what got me lol
---
Thought the same thing until I broke 5 bones and had to get x4 pins in my hand. Classic can u plZ wait 6-8 weeks lol
---
Can't ask "what happens after Naxx?" If Naxx never launches...  \*points to head\*
---
I'm 35, no job, no wife, no GF, no kids, (almost) no friends.  
---
I'm in the PERFECT spot ! :D  
---
...  
---
What ?
---
&gt; beta ends June 18th. 
---
Okays, so June 25th th-  
---
&gt; Servers launch July 16th. 
---
Wat.
---
This was the best yet. hahaha. I remember spending an hour trying to meet up with my friend at the yeti cave in Dun Morogh. I was yelling at him on my landline telling him to quit being an idiot and to go to the correct cave. Yeah, good times.
---
I mindlessly mined ore in the Dead Scar on my death knight when Wrath came out to sell on the AH. I knew that people would be levelling their professions, but... For some reason, I never really thought about why, and never felt like levelling my own in order to make even more money. The rest of the time I spent as a level 25 fisher-druid in the Barrens on Durotan.
---
Software is becoming more of a service and less of a product.  Wouldn't be surprised if the future expansions are all free just to retain and grow more subs.
---
I believe they effectively only switched the wording around, so rested xp is the original normal xp and the xp we're used to is actually the intended exhausted xp.
---
Thats when you leave lol
---
Plot twist she‚Äôs gonna share the wine with another guy

Can you give me a link to the Fury Prot build? It sounds really interesting, I know you can tank while leveling pretty easily as a warrior regardless of spec but I never knew there was a level 60 build for it.
---
How do you get to Winterspring on a lvl 1 alt without dying constantly throughout ashenvale, felwood, the timbermaw furbolg cave and Winterspring?  Seems like it would take an eternity at lv 1 only being able to go the max distance forward you can res through the cave.
---
You're surprised that people want to make their own groups instead of having an artificial system do it. 
---
That isn't a question. That's a statement that you don't understand.
---
As someone else said, you'll still have to figure out which server theyre on...and honestly they could black out their name for the first couple days to try to make it a bit more difficult.
---
They'll be found for sure, but they can delay it a bit to help themselves out.

I completely agree with For The Horde. Picked the wrong one initially because at the time I didn't think I'd do enhance pvp so didn't think melee stats we're worth anything. Realizing my mistake was so disappointing.
---
Initially there was no cap.  This is a screen shot of I think 17 people in Strathlahome.

People here are obviously not reacting in a great fashion. 
---
But you are basically suggesting to add the key feature people use as the reason why retail sucks and vanilla doesn't - AND suggesting that is something everyone can get behind.
---
The point of not having such a system is to enforce community engagement. You shouldn't need such a system, but rather quite that tank from your WC run, or run with your guild. 
---
So no, people are not being nice, but you could kinda see it coming - you might as well have suggested to remove talent trees because they're a hassle..
---
Why are you making stuff up? Your title should be ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried many guilds will form before release‚Äù, not making a defiant statement about the situation.
---
The 15th anniversary isn‚Äôt in the ‚ÄúSummer of Classic‚Äù though.

I played a rogue. I remember very clearly running into a dwarf hunter in Duskwood and seeing him use his gun. I thought, "I had a gun too, why weren't my bullets colourful and fast shooting". I asked him where he got his gun (because obviously it was the gun that was this amazing thing). Went all the way to SW and probably spent 40s on a white gun and went to use it and it didn't do shit. I was mad and confused. Good times.
---
wasn't that part of the onyxia attunement?
---
10:12 minute long video.
---
Stop what?
---
At that point it makes more sense to just cherry-pick features of the other expansions into a new WoW branch altogether; splitting WoW into two versions. 
---
There are too many for changes to the expansions that a pristine server doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
---
Hey Joana, I have a question. 
---
Given that guns can get scopes, and bows cannot, then all other things being equal (so let's a tauren hunter so we don't need to consider the racial bonuses) is a gun that does X DPS without scope better than an X DPS bow, since the scope can be added? I saw the bit on your guide about them being pretty equal, but it seems like a gun could be better since one could attach a scope.
---
Fucking dumb. Stop trying to change the game
---
Vanilla UI is perfectly good. I don't know why most people with custom UI talk like vanilla UI is unusable.
---
Only addons I want are for bags or dungeon maps/loot tables.
---
And then they learned again a couple of other times. Still disappointed that they decided against having Karabor and Bladespire be the faction hubs.
---
Not on this scale though.  Plus they never really brought back older versions of those games (Starcraft and WC3 just got a new coat of paint).
---
&gt; You're surprised that people want to make their own groups instead of having an artificial system do it. 
---
Theyre asking for a chat like /world to post in not a LFR 
---
&gt; You don't understand.
---
Back in the day people did stupid shit for funsies, nobody was trying to monetize shenanigans. Now we have streamers who live by "creating content", Blizzard is pushing all this professional e-sports stuff, it's like you're not allowed to play a game for fun anymore because it's basically a job for so many people. I long for the days when the only pros were gold farmers. I am not sure streamers are any better than gold farmers. They are providing a service I don't want to consume and getting in the way of the game I want to play. The fact that they provide a service someone else wants would be the same argument for why gold farming should be ok.
---
Sequisha said he's gonna get down on some WoW classic.  I'd love to run some PvP with/against that guy!
---
This would probably be the most rewarding. The reduced hostility cause all the angrybears would join a normal realm :D
---
I plan on maining a warrior, and almost leveling exclusively through dungeons with a spec similar to: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LVhxzAboxzVZEbzoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LVhxzAboxzVZEbzoo) . Recently did just that on a private server, except as prot and had a blast. - might start with Parry, if parry-haste works the way I think it does.
---
Yeah sure man. Hit me with that link.

Nobbel87 on YouTube has the best lore videos imo

Unsubbed in ... January? I just can't believe what they did to my druid....
---
I dont think the posts purpose is to say "look, thats bad". But I also think your comparison is flawed because it ignores (what I think is the point) unoriginality. Different news outlets should have very similar content. Thats the point of objective news, telling you what happened. But this right here isnt news, its content. More or less. Its recycling news. Which, again, isnt bad by itself. But the fact that now everyone does the same kind of recap right after each other just screams "I have no idea what to talk about"
---
How about you can‚Äôt see the enemy 10 players on the board till the game started?
---
Probably hypnotic blade iirc
---
Knowing the name made me realise what an incredible nerd i was... and by was i mean am... :)
---
That guild name is scarier than anything classic can throw at me, the second part especially.
---
Reverse psychology, she‚Äôs now the outlier. Originally it was me gaming and her not.  Now for classic I‚Äôve got three gamer kids and we‚Äôre going to roll through classic together.  Now it‚Äôs on her to ‚Äúget involved with the family activity‚Äù haha!
---

People like Asmongold should just stay away from Classic

I got lost on my very first character climbing out of Durotar through the mountains. I died in the river between Barrens and Durotar. It was my first death and for the life of me I couldn't figure out where my body was and stopped playing that character.

My netflix sub and hundreds of steam games that were free or a few bucks onetime payment with thousands of hours playtime might disagree with you
---
There are dozens of us!

I feel like it's more because there simply isn't much to talk about at the moment. The majority of the time the sub gets some decent posts is the couple days following a blue post. Other than that you have a bunch of topics that would just be beating a dead horse.

That sounds awesome. When I level a priest alt I think I'm gonna just healbot through dungeons like this
---
TBC nailed the LFG tool UI, I'd love to see them bring that in. But given that there's like 2% chance of that happening, we'll be just fine forming our own groups from our guildies, friends lists, and yelling in cities chat just like we've always done.
---
Good: Classic, TBC, Wotlk
---
Not bad: Cata, Legion, MoP
---
Not worth playing: WoD, BfA
---
The important difference between reddit and facebook:  
---
On reddit, you have no say in whos going to answer, unless you crawl into your own subreddit where you can delete whatever you dont want to see. As soon as you're out in the open, people, ALL people, can answer you, and challenge what you wrote.
---
Well I imagine the inner fire one had something to do with it not being on gcd? Because you could do that now it that is the case.
---
You could have macros take account of your resources before? Or was it just a spell rotation in that case of a rogue?
---
Also, with the amount of grind in Classic, a good way to alienate players is to let people grind their way up in a beta and then wipe their progress. A lot of people get their fill and never come back.
---
I would bet if we get a beta, it's going to be a very tightly controlled to stop this from happening.
---
I liked the LFG tool as it was first implemented.  The one where you could post up what you or your group was looking for.  In that way it was just a glorified chat channel that didn't have to deal with people spamming it for off-topic shit.
---
That said, I know some people don't want it.  Probably the majority.  
---
I wish there was a bit of a medium.  I wish there was a LFG chat channel for every instance you could join.  But who knows if people would use them.
---
Fantastic original content, laughed too hard at this video
---
It's good advice.  We communicate about everything so that sort of stuff just isn't an issue.  When you are with somebody long enough, and both parties are functioning adults, things like game times just don't matter.
---
Single and ready to play. -ugh sounds like an add found on less reputable sites.

As a programmer, I can only say : _"pffff...casuals!"_

I told my wife before we got married that this would happen when the game comes out and she‚Äôs always just replied with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs no problem! Do what you enjoy!‚Äù 
---
So it going to blow up in my face as soon as the game comes out.
---
That's true on a long fight, but with the time most quest mobs take to kill, you'll get gimped more with slower attack speed.

She does her own thing just as much as I play games.  As long as both parties are happy it all works out.

I was like level 38 and my brother got on my account and got an enchanter to enchant my weapons with icy and fiery weapon. Spent like 60g. He thought he was doing something nice for me. I proceeded to cry to my mom and it was just overall a bad experience. My mom.... "Calm down, you're 19 years old!" 
---
jk jk I was 11. :P
---
I never did them.

Like I said in another comment, when a new expansion comes out, I level up one of each faction to see the new areas, characters, dungeons, and storylines and then quit before getting into the end-game grind.
---
I haven‚Äôt raided or PvPed since WotLK.

Rest assured that my response to jimmy will be of the "gfy" kind :D

Don't remind me I'm hitting 30 in a few years, jesus...

Yes. I have been unsubbed since the end of Legion, waiting for classic! Can't wait!

It most likely is a fraction of the work too to make those addons for the BFA client.
---
I don't see the point of your comment other than to stir some flames.
---
Sad Blizzard is going all 1.12 instead of compromises for Classic.  
---
It's supposed to be a "piece of museum", a static version (apart from the content phases) that represent all of what Vanilla was.  
---
This would require more thinking.  
---
Like with the items changed throughout Vanilla. Why not add the first itteration of an item, adding an "Ancien" affix to the name, and its last version ? Some were so drastically different that you can't consider one is "better" than the other.  
---
Same with Alterac Valley.  1.12 AV for a week, 1.5 (or 1.7) the next week. And so on.  
---
EVERYTHING should be discussed, and compromises made to best represent Vanilla in that static 1.13.
---
I thought it was honored to get the keys?
---
This is awesome, and just generally good advice. It's taken me 34 years to realise the level of accountability that we must take in our relationships, and how far even the smallest effort can go. Well written and great advice!
---
I was level 10 and had just trained cooking.  The only other MMO I had played before this was RuneScape.  So using that knowledge I found a campfire and kept trying to drag and drop the fish icon on the fire since how else would you cook food right?.  After about 30 minutes of trying different foods and different fires all over the dwarf starting zone someone told me how to access the cooking skill.  The struggle was real....
---
Think it's just rogues at this point?
---
They might disagree, but they misunderstood my original statement. 
---
I said entertainment. Like watching a movie you actually want to watch, or playing a game you actually want to play. Not searching for hours to pick the best turd out of an enormous pile of turds to fix your nightly shit sandwich.
---
Been digging up some memories from Vanilla recently with all the hype, and recalled this one.  A younger version of me thought this was the greatest, and I was convinced I‚Äôd build one of these for myself someday.  That day will never come, but I‚Äôve always appreciated the dedication (and hilarity) here!
---
I think you‚Äôre forgetting how far technology has changed outside of the game over the past 10 years. Not just hardware wise, but software wise as well.
---
I suspect that convenience features (like LFG) were largely implemented because people were beginning to develop them outside of the game. 
---
If they removed LFG, we‚Äôd see a bunch of Raider.io style websites pop up within a couple of months to help form groups.
---
Granted it‚Äôll only be with people on your own server, but that social aspect we got back then is largely gone, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be coming back.
---
That being said, I‚Äôd definitely consider giving modern WoW a try again if they introduced the hard mode you discussed.
---
Well the primary ask seems to be for the retail tool and then there's a snarky concession 
---
&gt;If this is too big of a "change" for some people then a global lfg chat would suffice.
---
...for a chat channel. I don't think OP understands.
---
Yep, you're right, it's rogues. I went through all of the episode descriptions
---
You know you spent way too much time on the game when 15 years later you recognize the guy in the picture.
---
If it does blow up for some reason, I can see them making a separate game similar to classic wow that they can milk us for money. Not necessarily a WoW 2, but more a WoW classic 2.

---
31 now and preparing for Classic responsibly. Make sure the house is cleaned and do some meal prep to have an easy dinner every other day. I'm thinking of cutting up a nice piece of beef and making a stew and baking a sub roll to go with it.
---
This is how I could see 2019 being different than 2004. We can all communicate to each other in real time much easier than a decade ago. If a popular stream says, ‚ÄúFaction war in Hillsbrad‚Äù you‚Äôll have a massive faction war in Hillsbrad. Or we use platforms like Reddit to talk to the other faction and coordinate through messenger, email, phone numbers, GroupMe the list goes on. I could seriously see GroupMes of the most prominent guild leaders for a few realms starting stuff up via that.
---
It‚Äôll be interesting for an old game like that to be put into the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù that is today.

Why are you assuming everyone can get behind it? I suggest you change the title to: Please cater to my desires and risk the integrity of your game, Blizzard.

---
I see what you did.  Take your upvote.
---
Bye Bye Bye!
---
I dunno.  I think you kind of did have to know people.  Even in classic they had meeting stones which auto invited people.
---
The LFG UI was mostly a glorified chat channel.  It let you find people who were looking for specific groups or instances.  You still had to interact with them.  You still had to ask for the invite.  And most importantly, after the run was done you were still on the same server together.
---
I know there is a tendency to worry about slippery slopes, but I don't think this is where the slippery slope started personally.  It started when the game auto put together groups and transported them to the instance.  And it was the nail in the coffin when it began doing it cross realm.
---
I respect your opinion, but I think the LFG issue has always been hard in WoW and the LFG tool was their best solution to it.  Having to compete with trade spammers, gold spammers, and just spammers in general while looking for a group was one of the more aggravating barriers that didn't really add to the experience much, imo.

Lol sleep is the only thing you can give up while you have a family. I stream Wed- Saturday from 8pm after the kiddo is in bed until 2-3AM every morning. Then I wake up at 6 AM to go to my 8-5 job. All I know is sleep deprivation.

While I totally agree with you MOST streamer influence is blown out of proportion but seriously have you been in Asmongold‚Äôs channel? It‚Äôs an entirely different beast, that channel WILL farm for their AsmonLord for hours without a doubt.
---
Equipped Satyr's Lash on a hunter. Noob-me figured if the stats on a melee weapon helped my ranged attacks, the proc should work too. It wasn't until quite some levels later that I figured out it didn't work like that, and why the group had been so bemused by me rolling on it. Lucky nobody else wanted it.
---
The time is upon us!
---
SFK isnt so bad honestly since an alliance leveling zone is RIGHT next to it. Gnomer is maybe a bit more reasonable to add to the list.
---
A template of infinite potential
---
I could see that being fine if youre 'binge leveling' and can spend a lot of time there in one sitting (not hearthing halfway through the zone), but for people that just want to quest for an hour or whatever its probably a bit prohibitive.
---
I've warned my gf about this many months ago...what worked for me was promising "1 DATE NIGHT" a week.

What killed it for me was logging into my old account, after 8+ years of not playing, and realizing that all of my accomplishments were pretty much null and void. Those epic tiger mounts i spent weeks farming darnassus rep on my human mage to get? O you can use them on any character now and that's nothing special. My hunters pet, Humar the Pridelord, took me forever to get while I waited by that damn tree in the barrens for him to spawn. O now you can get a similar pet later on with no real effort? Fantastic! 
---
Everything you once worked so hard for, was literally spoon fed to players through the expansions.
---
Thanks for the great post. I‚Äôm sure lots of wives and husbands out there will appreciate it some launch. As for me... I‚Äôve been talking a lot to my husband about my hype for Classic WoW and yesterday I saw him looking at warrior talent trees for classic... I think I‚Äôve got him talked into it! üòÄ Between the two of us and a toddler proofed computer room we are pretty good at wrangling the kiddo while we play together.
---
Big streamers are going to be a blight on any realm they play on. Their viewers will overpopulate the realm and they will make playing on the realm not about playing WoW but about playing WoW with *big streamer*. 
---
And what happens if, say, a big streamer starts on a server but then decides to change to a new realm? I would expect a fair amount of their viewers to follow them. Any large group of players leaving all at once can kill a realm.
---
I was wrong for assuming people would get behind it but I'm not gonna change the title (can you even change titles?)
---
To be clear I wouldn't be in favor of the auto-accept and stuff of the modern LFG tool. Just an ingame tool or global channel for people to list groups. That's all.
---
It seems that global channels will be used in classic however. I'm still not clear whether there is a 50 person limit or not, clarification on that would be nice!
---
Also in Dark Souls you can literally use your starting weapon and some shitty armor you found on a corpse in the first level and slay the very gods, solo. Not exactly the kind of thing that happens in WoW.
---
I don't know if streamers will announce what server they're going to until after launch. It might cause them some issues such as: 
---
1) Names being taken and held for ransom
---
2) Guild names being stolen from them and held for ransom
---
3) Long queues for even them
---
No. This is the reason retail is messed up. Too many casuals complaining about the game being hard.
---
Why is that? Even on shorter fights, on average, you'll get more dodges/misses/parries so instead of getting dodged once, your pet might get dodged 3 times which would equate to about the same dps.

---
I believe that honored was the rep required after they did the big reduction in everything(xp, mounts, removed attunement etc)
---
I know we can reduce all mmos to "grinds to unlock more grinds" but the rep grind was and still is really lame to me. It's nothing but time gating.
---
I agree the attunement was awesome at the time. I loved the feeling of finally finishing it off. Then you spent weeks catching up the rest of your guild. Running and re running all the same normals until they could do heroics, then re run them through the heroics.
---
I hadn't thought about it reducing the spam about selling runs. Honestly though would it?It may just push them to sell the attunement itself. Also, I don't believe Gruul had an attunement so theres a quick run to sell.
---
You're thinking LFD, which absolutely was. LFG as in TBC's LFG tool was quite good. It was a high info density persistent channel where you could look for group members without digging through spam and having to constantly keep losing at the LFG channel. You could post your goals, go off and do your thing, and then periodically check in on if there were people looking to do a dungeon, who you would then still have to interact with.
---
As a healing pally in dungeons I always felt weird about the loot. I was afraid to roll on dps upgrades because the tank would want the same things, but I also didn't feel comfortable rolling on +int gear that clothies wanted. I pretty much just passed on the stuff other people needed and just ran dungeons for the quests/fun of it. I can imagine a lot of paladin healers don't care though and just need on whatever they want. I know I've seen some tanks specifically looking for a priest healer for this very reason for dungeons like SM.

Hello!

pfUI creator said on his discord that he is not planning to make an interface for Classic wow, doing it for 1.12 was enough for him.
---
Will gladly start a femdwarf-only groupme so we can coordinate all of our tiddy raids on horde cities
---
Here is my hot take, with Classic existing we will see the opposite happen. Now that Blizzard is hitting a particular demographic, they will lean in even more on retail with more monetization, more store mounts, etc. They consider people who hate those things, will just play Classic instead, and will then just try to milk the remaining retail audience for as much as they can.
---
I want to be angry that I have a job but I cant. I kind of need it
---
Do you think that the troll berserking racial ability during melee dives could make 31/20 more competitive?
---
You‚Äôve only got yourself just enough time to find a tank for your dungeon at only 4 hours
---
There's not anything wrong with R.druid in 5 man dungeons as your healer.  You don't have a rez, so your team has to be more careful than normally would be. They have enough output to deal with accidental pulls, especially with tranquility.   
---
Play smart, bring a class that can rez if you want, just don't be idiots and you'll be just fine.

KEK got me good
---
Wasn‚Äôt too bad, but other healers are better. Not having a ress was the worst, but I had engi and sometimes having jumper cables came in handy. If you wanna spam dungeons I think priest is the best.
---
A terrorist and child murderer.
---
I like what you're asking for, but I don't think its reasonable to assume this will ever happen.   I happen to prefer smaller scale content for fun.  I'm one of those weird people who will raid, but also collect a "non-raid" set to use in dungeons so they don't get too trivial.
---
If you don't want to step foot in a 40-man, you're going to be fine.  When AQ hits (someone can chime in here with the correct phase/patch) you'll have a quest chain to upgrade your dungeon set into what's known as dungeon set 2 or T0.5 armor.  It's on par with PvP tier 10 sets and slightly worse than T1.  You get it entirely in 5 mans, by summoning extra bosses and revisiting old places.  Its a fantastic (and long) quest chain that is perfect for a small group as a goal to work towards.

Usually my drive and passion to play games is pretty cyclical, there will be periods of time, weeks to months where there is not a game that i am constantly thinking about or striving to play.. during these periods of time i make sure to spend a lot of time with my wife and take care of projects around the house or things of that nature. I still play games here but not as frequently.. then there are periods where all i can think about or want to do is play said game. Thankfully I have an understanding wife who knows what she signed up for when marrying a nerd like myself. She knows and is probably not happy or looking forward to me playing classic, but she understands how happy it makes me. This does not give me a free pass to play every free moment i get. This means she understands that a majority of my free time will be dedicated towards it. A very important part of not creating tension or stress in between us is to periodically check in. I will frequently ask "hey hun, i know I've been gaming alot lateley. Is everything okay with you? Would you like to go on a family walk/go get a bite/watch a show/movie? if so done hesitate to ask!" and if she asks, i make it a top priority to fit in that task. Just be in touch with your significant other. It's okay to enjoy yourself and have fun, but NOT okay to neglect your partner.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with op stance btw just pointing out the lfg/lfr thing
---
Honestly the first one isn't that bad, if it even is. I right clicked for the longest time but when there are alot of mobs infront of you like when you tank, sometimes it's much easier to use your auto attack button than being precise right clicking.
---
I was like 7 when i started playing classic, i told everyone i was 12.
---
Now here's a voice of reason. My suggestion of a bare-bones lfg tool or global lfg channel was only intended to enhance the classic experience. Parking 1 person in a major city to be able to fill your group isn't necessary for the genuine classic experience IMO.
---

No wife/gf here. 
---
Wake up early. Say you have to be at work by 8, leave by 7:30. If you normally get up at 6:30, get up at 5. You'll have 90min to play when populations are at a minimum and no wife agro. I can see a woman getting mad at me for not coming to bed at 11, but now that you're waking up earlier you can get mad at her for not coming to bed at 10! Then you can still play from 7-10!
---
The difference is that the dungeon finder goes cross-realm. So toxic assholes like you described don't care about their reputation since the people they screwed over can't affect their future play. Keeping all your activities in one realm means that you reputation can become known to those around you.

I'm going to be that guy.  Green circle means he's friendly; you aren't an Orc.

---
She deserves it
---
Even with the 2/2 talent in Prot that increases HoF duration by 6 seconds?
---
Then Blizzard should probably filter out all those changes from patches between launch and 1.12 that came from all the crying on the forums at the time. If you want diminishing returns then the game is to hard for you, right?
---
Some servers called Deadmines VC for sure. The ones I played on said DM
---
*this*, as in *this* is a definition for *this*
---
Neither VC nor DM, in french it's Morte mines I guess so MM whereas Dire Maul is Hache Tripes in french so HT!
---
Not a big fan of all translations but for once it clears any doubt (if there was one initially!)

I didn't call anyone names for arguing against my suggestion. I called ONE person a name for attacking my post history for no reason. Get a grip mate.

I have always wondered what I was saying to some mobs to ‚Äútaunt‚Äù them to me. I mean what exactly am I saying to a boar?

In Fury there are about 5 points you can move around. I pick Imp Battle shout, but you could move those into say Imp Demo shout, Imp Cleave, Blood craze, etc etc
---
Mage is honestly one of the strongest classes against rogues.
---
Im very interested going shaman. My only worry is that how hards is getting elemental gear as healer? I know they share alot of items, but getting bis items might be hard since there is like 20 other caster dps in raid wanting them.
---
Skinning isn‚Äôt that great of gold imo, market is so heavily saturated that you will only sell for vendor price which isn‚Äôt good until at least thick leather. Even then, herbing is better imo and enchanting is tough early but very rewarding later on.
---
I think he'd have had some luck just inviting discussion about the chat channel idea.
---
Finally got Sulfuras (as Enh Shaman, Eye of Sulfuras dropped the 3rd down, lucky me :o )... but liked to be a jack-of-all-trade. So I was geared with random pieces.  
---
And received quickly enough, when proudly AFK in Orgrimmar, that it was a shame I had it, while wearing T1 bracers with +healing enchant ahah !
---
Let me guess, someone stole your Mulgore Spice Bread?
---
/spit
---
Try to abstain yourself the longest possible without completing your air totem quest. And only complete it when you want to do some cool stuff in pvp or pve as a melee shaman.
---
Last time i checked OSRS has 3x as many users aS RS3
---
There aren't that many shaman quests, and I would do them as soon as you can. They're mostly just for getting your totems.
---
Totems, will keep you busy :)
---
Im literally pissing myself
---
For the Horde! Probably undead for me.
---
I don't think it will happen either, and I assume I will manage just fine on a normal realm. I just think i'd enjoy a realm like this more in the long run, which after all Classic WoW is all about. Sure, I can reroll to enjoy the earlier phases again, when fresh realms start to roll out. I will certainly check what you are suggesting about dungeon set 2 out when the time comes, cause I'll probably have a lot of classes at 60 that won't be raiding.
---
Whenever I see DM, I simply check the level of the person asking. Less than 25, it's Dead Mines, otherwise it's Dire Maul. Context matters people....
---
You could do a little of both worlds and go druid. Tank 5 mans, heal raids, good at farming, and fast levelers for your limited time
---
that's what she said.
---
If you are worried about klling the community, then how should TBC be handled without doing exactly that?
---
Suprise! Over 10% of players are hardcore full tank warriors lfg. Groups are looking purely for enhancement shamans, ret pallys, and boomkins. The wow universe implodes lol
---
All I remember is your water totem quest will make you wanna kill yourself.
---
What should I play?
---
I love horde
---
I love healing dungeons (played ele shaman in vanilla)
---
I love ganking people in world pvp and feeling safe (I played rogue)
---
What should I play? (:
---
Just claim to be poor and don't bother to train summoning. After all, it's one of the most useless abilities with no personal advantage. (Mages at least get to eat and drink the food and water they produce). When as a warlock do you get to summon yourself?
---
You looking for an allie list?
---
Was planning to play a Rogue but I've heard they got hit with the nerf bat pretty heavily in 1.12. How much do they start to suck post nerf? Is mage more viable? Hoping to mostly PvP with the occasional dungeon.
---
I mained a hunter from vanilla - Legion. Considering playing hunter again, but not positive.
---
Two completely different things. They shouldn‚Äôt have to make servers to slow the game down for people. This won‚Äôt ever happen so you can keep dreaming. You want to keep up with everyone else then play more.
---
I think it does like 150 dmg over 15 sec at lvl 60
---
Haven‚Äôt seen this in years. Still great!
---
I don't have the wife problem, but I still have this pesky job to get rid of.
---
I think it's probably more realistic to look at this like a big patch release than a brand new game release. That seems to be how they're treating it.
---
Are you planning to raid heavily?
---
Represent!
---
Yes!
---
Tbh from my experience healer quality is much more skill/effort dependand than gear/spec dependand unlike DPS.
---
It basically takes your dungeon set (which is a wide range of level 50 items) and turns it to all level 60 - half blue, half purple.
---
I was a fairly hardcore feral druid, and your assement isn't too far off. I would add the following tweaks:
---
- Druids are extremely good in WPvP 1vX because of their massive kiting potential. 
---
- The gear sets are painfully real. I had 6 that I can remember: Tank Threat, Tank Mitigation, Burst DPS, Sustained DPS, PvP Fight, PvP Kite. Additionally, getting obscure items is very important. There are level 55+ quests where if you take the wrong reward, you fucked yourself permanently. Enchanting is mandatory. 
---
- They are not particularly good in BGs, except for WSG where they are a BiS flag carrier. For this reason, premades are generally willing to carry you in AB farming so that they can have you WSG weekend.
---
- Beating people who look down on druids is extremely satisfying. A fully rank 10 or higher geared druid will one shot most level 60 mages before they can say "but my pick is META."
---
- The flip side of this is that Druid faces some pretty severe discrimination in vanilla wow, and I can (kinda) understand why. The only thing worse that dealing with people who think feral druid is useless, is dealing with other feral druids who don't commit to it and go around shitting up it's reputation even more. 
---
- Kinda the same as above, but be prepared to have the same conversation justifying your existence over and over again, sometimes with people who are significantly behind you on DPS charts. 
---
- Overall, Druid is the supreme example of high-effort, high-reward in Vanilla WoW. Which is why I'm hyped to roll one again.
---
Wow that is shit
---
feelsbad
---
Right? Amongold could have 1000g the first week of he wanted.
---
Unless he actively discourages boosting and gold/loot donating he will essentially have 5+ raiding guild's worth of resources at his disposal without even asking for it.
---
Of course I don't expect Amongold to do that, I haven't heard him have any intention of trying to have a normal vanilla experience.
---
He'll be happy having BOE's and gold funneled to him because warriors benefit from that the most and he wants to exert the least amount of skill possible in PvP.
---
Wow, someone needs an outlet for all that suppressed anger.
---
Shaman
---
Wasn‚Äôt expecting that.
---
&gt;it's one of the most useless abilities with no personal advantage.
---
Well, the way I see it, what I am summoning are essentially minions with (slightly) better AI that will enable me to gather loot from the dungeon :D
---
Does it have to be cross realm though?
---
Because Blizzard has a history of letting servers die until it's really late and having no ability to manage 3:1+ faction imbalance
---
Damn you really know how to get under someone‚Äôs skin don‚Äôt you.
---
1) Didn't realize getting "drunk" in game would cause you to be unable to walk in a straight line. Drank a ton of alcohol waiting on the elevator to come to the bottom so I could ride it up to Thunder Bluff. Get to the top, screen is all hazy, and immediately proceed to walk off of the elevator and fall to my death.
---
2) Didn't understand talent trees, so I just randomly dumped points wherever, and couldn't understand why my warlock was completely useless and could not progress down the talent trees to the cooler looking talents.
---
3) First time running Gnomer. I jumped. I didn't dismiss my pet. I just kinda assumed he'd jump since I did.
---
4) Didn't understand how stats worked. Used to how gear worked in Diablo 2. Wanted to make sure I had enough STR and AGI (figured it was WoW's equivalent to DEX) to equip all of the gear I found and wanted to equip. Also didn't realize my warlock could only equip cloth, so I had quite the collection of leather and mail in my bag. Figured it was red cuz I just didn't have enough STR or AGI to equip it yet.
---
you can't be completionist and only do "almost" all the quests :P
---
"The only good non-human is a dead non-human." 
---
Human Paladin, Alliance of course.
---
The fact Distilled will go for 400 and titans will go for 1k shows the difference in the amount of runs for each of those dungeons
---
Relationship goals right here
---
It's not just catering to casuals, it's catering to everyone who can't put in the time to premake a group, and good luck doing that with a big faction imbalance.
---
Unless you were on a problem server/faction you have no idea what it was like
---
&gt;I really want the pursuit of justice talent to speed up movement
---
Doesn't stack with minor movement speed boot enchant so unless you're wanting to trade 2 talent points for 9 Stam it's not that great once you've got boots worth enchanting.
---
&gt;Holy shield feels like a must
---
It's way too mana hungry to use outside of once at the start of boss fight to get that initial agro.  You'll be using seal and judgment of wisdom to keep your mana up as well or you'll end up drinking every pull.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm wondering what you think about the threat gen from imp ret aura. 
---
Pretty great, you'll want that for full time tanking.
---
There's nothing really wrong with your first build but you may have a misconception of how it'll be played.
---
Ok  8 go living and 8 go undead. Leroy is afk.
---
It looks like it gets really hot in there.
---
i like this, it helps when people try to snipe. And it dont punish casual players missing ques because of reasons. Then add a 30min deserter for leaving a game. (instead of the 5-20min)
---
So, let me get this straight...this guy hooked up 2 separate computers so he could have a separate screen?!?
---
Did anyone tell him, that:  
---
a) Even the original WoW client could run in fullscreen-windowed mode  
---
b) GFX cards with 2 VGA outlets were already available in 2004
---
But basically, this is already a more elaborate repost of the meta jaina meme post from several months ago
---
Well played
---
They would take into account all sorts of things, resources, combo points, enemy mob hp etc.  There were macros that would choose the rank of the spell to use to get the most efficiency with your heals based on the missing hp of the target.  Etc.
---
I was and am and tbh it‚Äôs not the premade groups fault they play more. If you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt play it, the people who play it and like it are generally going to join guilds who have premades.

&gt; Sleep deprivation is a way of life and we need to get your pussy ass in shape! 
---
This is exactly what I needed to hear. I'm ready sir /salute
---
&gt;How streamers could make classic WoW fun
---
Deleting their accounts would definitely be a step in a helpful direction.
---
Its not elitism, and you really need to not think of it as a personal attack on you or your ideas.
---
I get what you're saying, its a minor change to make finding groups easier rather than spam trade chat over and over.  This could in theory help the game get more people to want to try it, or help retain people that are used to retail or the LFG system as it is.  What you're failing to understand is they (the developers) said at this time they are willing to bring back Vanilla/Classic WoW the way it was; not the way some people want it to be, not to fix old mistakes, and not to try a new path to see if a better option could have been done.
---
Nost and the other PServers showed that there is an interest in the original game, with all its perceived flaws and imbalance. Yes, some are downright stupid issues that could be a quick fix that would have little to no impact on the gameplay (as your idea is), but thats not the point, what they are giving us is an opportunity to play the game the way it was, with no changes be them QoL or game changing.
---
So how about we let people get these months/years of enjoyment, the good and the bad, how it was. Then once we see how successful it is let Blizzard and the community decide how they should proceed in the future.
---
It's just about being upfront about who you are from the get go. 
---
If you just entirely abandon your gaming habits for the sake of not looking like a nerd while you are dating it's going to come back to bite you in the ass later on. 
---
I've never tried to hide who I am to her. I gave up alot of my game time for my family willingly with no intention of ever going back to it when I made the decisions I made. She also has known from the beginning if we are at home lounging to not expect me to sit in the living room and watch TLC with her. 
---
She knows I am going to have a certain amount of gaming time pretty much every night. It's been that way forever and I have never given her a reason to expect anything else. Don't change who you are at the beginning to please anyone and it won't be a big surprise to them 5 years down the road when you wan't to take a week off of work to play wow for 16 hours a day. 
---
You also need to recognize this shit is a 2 way street. If they feel neglected it wont be good for the relationship. Don't sacrifice family time to sit on your computer all day on Saturday. As long as are still making them a priority and making sure their needs are taken care of it's going to be alot easier for them to realize your games are important to you.
---
It also helps if you get them involved a little. I gave her my old rig at one point, she plays retail with me occasionally. She mostly does pet battles now, but she had fun with it. I'll have playing during classic here and there.
---
I probably will. I didn‚Äôt originally, and there were a few I missed and didn‚Äôt really know at all. I found a vid series a bit ago that gives a brief spiel about each dungeon, and was figuring on listing them in order of level and making a point to go through them.
---
I know it isn‚Äôt the most efficient, but my play time will not allow for a rush to 60 situation anyway, so might as well enjoy some new places along with the old memories!
---
Check YouTube, the shammy totem quests aren‚Äôt that bad! And you get them all at different levels.
---
The people who want to snipe streamers won't be delayed too long. The realm will be revealed in chat in moments because people can do a /who search.
---
And the streamer won't out level dedicated streamers on day 1 because streamers can't play 24/7. I think that there will be some serious ganking heading towards streamers in Classic.
---
I haven't been subbed since Cata... however long ago that was.
---
Lol that‚Äôs what I came here to say
---
Cross-realm BGs might not entirely eliminate queue dodging, but I think we‚Äôd get far less queue dodging if it required scouting the opposing faction on numerous other servers.
---
That's literally the saddest thing I've read on Reddit, and I've read some really sad shit.
---
For real. Why do so many youtubers and streamers think we want to look at their greasy faces?
---
What part of ‚Äúeveryone on the internet is a white male American,‚Äù don‚Äôt you get?
---
I feel like Elwynn is the Midwest of Azeroth
---
Why compare the Kara attunement to those and not mention Ony?
---
No no no. Don't trust Hartsman or anyone who worked on ArcheAge. Amazing game with huge potential squandered and ran into the ground.
---
\&gt;  They‚Äôll usually just end up either dodging or win-trading because it‚Äôs a giant waste of time.
---
AB has a ruleset where this isn't true, which is one of the reasons why premades favor this BG.
---
The main reason why premades queue dodge/win trade isn't that the games become endless. It is just the easiest &amp; fastest way of ranking. Path of least resistance. Cross realm won't fix this.
---
The only way to fix that, would be an actual ranking system that rewards playing against high ranked players. Something on the line of Elo/Glicko etc. that is used in "modern" competitive games. But this won't happen, since it is a too drastic change.
---
At the end he got 115 killing blow and 2nd place has 3 lmao
---
Just to make sure I'm properly regurgitating, is that \#\#\#\#, or \#hashtag\#hashtag etc etc?
---
"A threat within" and all the quests that follow it.
---
Oh, of course. Sorry about that. I'll just go back to my tea.
---
I thought it's more a T3 Warrior vs a pug in dungeon blues :(
---
&gt;ther healers are better.  
---
&gt;Are they really better? I mean, thinking about a Paladin who just hit 60, they have basically 10-12% crit chance on holy spells and need 1,5 seconds to heal anybody for an efficient, but relativley small amount. Is that better than the Resto Druid Toolkit?
---
I don't see the need. Over a long enough timeline even quite casual guilds will have everything pre-AQ on farm with a handful of bosses in AQ40 and Naxx on farm I imagine. The gear disparity shouldn't be that dramatic especially with catch-up gear added to 5mans in later phases.
---
You would simply never step foot into a BG then.
---
Google it don‚Äôt be lazy
---
This is clearly the best solution. Just give deserter for missing a queue. The time on deserter can increase geometrically to deter systematic queue dodging while not overly punishing poorly timed trips to the restroom.
---
Robe of the Archmage is BiS until Bloodvine. Then Bloodvine releases in Phase 4, when that becomes your new BiS. 
---
Tailoring is BiS forever, or at least until you replace Bloodvine in Naxx or potentially late AQ40.
---
Haha, unlike all you kids, I was just finishing my degree when I started playing classic. I'm still trying to figure out how to go hard on release without pissing my wife off too much. I think we're going to level characters together after I get my first to 60.
---
No because you‚Äôd still have to buy BFA
---
&gt;that 6 slot bag droprates are inflated in private servers. Is this true?
---
Inflated, deflated, it's wrong no matter what the droprate is.
---
Private servers are reverse engineered, and most of the data they use is from mid-late TBC, when real, comprehensive archives were not just collated, but made publicly available.
---
To make matters worse: PServer Admins were desperately trying to retain the population, an issue that got only worse when more and more of them popped up (now they competed with each other). So they introduced numerous "niceties" to make the game smoother in the early levels.
---
Classic will have the real droprates. Which will prolly be a lot lower than what PServer folks are used to.
---
This is exactly how I‚Äôve done priest alts too. Feeling social? Hop on the priest and heal some dungeons. Feeling quiet and want to slowly quest/explore alone? Hunter alt.
---
I love tanking on the main, but some times I‚Äôm in a mood for a different kind of game play.
---
I‚Äôd watch you watch him watch the other guy‚Äôs reaction to asmongold‚Äôsreaction about what is quite possibly a trivial piece of information.  My life is fucking awesome.
---
I'll do you one better, it took me over 3 months to realize I didn't have to press auto attack to attack. So be a 34 ret pally in desolace slamming down on your button only to get a phone call, walk into the other room to pickup said phone and talk for 9 seconds (telemarketer), walk back in to watch your character swing with the auto attack button blinking. 
---
I was dumb founded.
---
Saw this a week or two ago: http://imgur.com/gallery/pBb4AW5
---
As someone who completed the rank14 grind I feel obligated to warn you against it.  I'm someone pretty resilient to burnout and even so I quit for quite a while after completing rank14.  It completely killed any speck of love or motivation I had for the game.
---
A lot of the mobs in the starting areas have a higher chance to drop bags, at least that's the way it seemed. And I'm talking about Vanilla. If you are going to stop making bags at 6 slots its probably a waste of time and money.
---
I might. If these Classic servers are permanent and your character will be around for many years to come there's not really any reason why I couldn't just casually grind every now and again and eventually complete it.
---
&gt;As it stands now players will be forced to have at least one person in a capital city so they can spam trade chat for filling dungeons.
---
It's called "communicating" and "not being pampered by convenience bullshit".
---
# No. Changes.
---
Sorry mate, that's a falsetto.
---
You have to be draining soul while the mob dies, doesn't matter if you got the last tick or not.
---
That's great advice, thank you.
---
No tools that take the social aspect of the game away. A LFD tool undoubtedly does this. 
---
Groups should be made in /2 or by working your guild, friends list, or /who.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to getting rid of the cap of memebers on private channels, though.
---
But I really disagree we should have a blizzard implemented /world.
---
Could limit it to only groups aka 5man.
---
Sell it.
---
Troll racial is pretty good all around, but it won't make or break you. You don't have a problem dealing damage when you connect with a target. Connecting is the hard part. Shaman get kited all day.
---
Shadow priest is a good option. Can heal dungeons no problem and is considered one of the best classes in 1v1
---
Seeing this makes me happy that I am in the 11-17 y/o bracket now, so I don't need to worry about such "adult stuff" like wifes :)
---
Oh thank God you had to be that guy, thank you for shining the light on us blind plebs.
---
Yeah that might make more sense.  I forgot Imp Shield Block was great at 1 point.
---
The streamer can level through mob tagging to get ahead.  
---
Why cant they play as much as the other poopsocker?
---
(Aragorn smiles) - "Not a word"
---
Can anyone blame him?
---
Death and Taxes were what 13 year old me looked up to the most. That and the best dueler on my server a warrior named Hero. Really want to steal his name and that guild name for classic but I‚Äôm sure most will beat me to it.
---
The fact that we want the game we loved back in 2004, instead of a version that was butchered to please people who gut used to the experience that turned retail into a shitshow, is suddenly "elitism" because...?
---
Oh, wait, it isn't...you're just using random words you think sound big, to mask the fact that you have no arguments.
---
# LOL
---
Duo stealth runs make up for it though.
---
I tried with a lvl 1 orc on a pserver. Going to Felwood is OK , I died less than a dozen times (don't rez at the northern GY in Felwood or you won't be able to get out of it. Stay on the road).
---
However the Furlborg tunnel is another matter. Prepare to spend a lot of time running back to your corpse, wait 5 min to respawn then die 10 meters later.
---
Not sure it's worth it.
---
1.12 servers have an addon called oQue.
---
What it does it it reads general and trade chat for key words like ‚Äúbrd‚Äù ‚Äúony‚Äù ‚Äúbwl‚Äù etc. and copy‚Äôs it into a UI that has a button that allows you to whisper the person that sent the message in chat and shows how long ago it was typed. 
---
There was another addon that allows you to share trade chat with anyone with the addon across the server allowing you to read trade chat while questing. 
---
I‚Äôm sure something like this will be created but I don‚Äôt think that blizzard should implement it themself.
---
I actually really hope Classic will be a stepping stone to something better. If the game stays a success, maybe they might consider building a new mmo using the same rpg philosophy and systems. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love vanilla, but a new game with a new engine and story would be amazing.
---
Relevant username
---
Kara was an instance as was mc and bwl, ony was a single boss.
---
I‚Äôd say so, because you almost never go oom, and your buffs are crazy good. Ur gonna be running dungeons such as strat that have undeads, and being a paladin is pretty fun in some situations.
---
I definetly want to do every dungeon at least once, even if its not gonna give me an upgrade for my gear.
---
I'm safe! Holy paladin baby!
---
Omg, this is so funny xD
---
That would also work.
---
Are you saying WC isn't worth a run during leveling? That's blasphempy, WC is a fun dungeon with great quest rewards.
---
I think it would. They could easily sell the runs for SSC and TK, but there was also so much effort you had to put in in between. So it wouldn‚Äôt eliminate the problem, but it would make it much less prevalent. Also, I could be wrong, but I thought it always was honored. I‚Äôll have to check in on that... because getting exalted without the heroics would have been nearly impossible.
---
you mean grinding only? 
---
for all my chars i choose only skinning if i found some epic pattern i will learn second profession. some questlines are funny you miss a lot not to do them. 
---
i will only grind 20-25 levels. i roll shadow priest, but for questing  and elite quests i have a hunter mate who will help
---
at lvl 38 will my make my first dungeon.
---
you can do this with every class depends on how much time you want invest 
---
hunter is fastest class 
---
i hope you report because solo grinder reports are rare
---
This is not how you build a community btw. I don‚Äôt know the answer but some people just like to have a conversation with another person rather than Google.
---
I like this, but if there is a certain premade that a team is afraid of, then they can log on their faction or server and /who them to watch when they get into a BG.
---
There was a Death and Taxes guild on my server.
---
The only thing that makes people vicious, is the constant barrage of "requests" for things that are out of the question.
---
It was said not once, not twice, not five times, but a gazillion times over and over that **There. Will. Be. No. Changes. To. The. Gameplay.**
---
Introducing a prior nonexistent chat-channel is a change to the gameplay. Therefore, it will not be. Most people seem to understand that, but some seem to feel the need to ask for such stuff over and over again regardless.
---
That is annoying. And people don#t like to be annoyed.
---
Not really. If I get to raiding it won‚Äôt be for a while (like years). Mainly thinking about questing, dungeons and some bgs.
---
Nah warriors are always needed and its always high amount of players playing it +  its the class you bring most of to raids and pvp, it is also the main class to tank instances with so there is always need for them, on all sorts of gameplay.  
---
But there will always be competition to get into raids and groups and what not, no matter what class you play. If you cant keep a high attendance and preform well, then there is other thats will give it more.
---
LMAO for some reason this is the absolute funniest thing in the world, to me. I love you for saying this. Please, do I have your permission to do this? Like, Andy Kaufman style, when other people are around while I'm questing?  
---
"Horde scum get pwnt!! KNEEL before Zod! You like that?"  
---
"...You know that's a mob, right?"  
---
"Yeah man I'm the best at killing Horde mobs."  
---
"No... what I mean... you know what? Never mind."
---
This reminds me of Goldeneye 'big head' mode
---
5 year relationship down the shitter here as well.  My body is ready for this.
---
It will always be this way the same with rogues and mages.
---
Wars are the only tanks with taunts, pallys can‚Äôt tank swap. That‚Äôs not to say that a pally or druid can‚Äôt tank, it‚Äôs just more impractical.
---
Fury warriors are the best dps class in the game with good gear, every one wants to be the best. Mages are the highest caster dps. No one wants to summon people so less people roll warlocks. Spriests are garbage in pve. 
---
Rogues are the best 1v1 class in world pvp and the second best meow dps class. 
---
There is no way to change this, blizzard stated that they don‚Äôt want to change how classes work or balance anything.
---
I did this too, and convinced all of my friends to so the same.
---
No idea where I got this from!
---
Of course we were meant to get there. Just happen to wand a mob to aggro you, run up to the instance portal, die to the mob, and resurrect on the other side of the portal. I hope that works in classic :)
---
I kinda have this same problem, but with do i want to go holy/ret and be the sword of vengeance or do i want to go holyreck and being able to solo stuff, heal in dungeons and raids.
---
You have to be trolling :D
---
Legendary Games that shaped a whole generation inside a endless library that cost a normal price or are free are a shit sandwich because they dont cost 30 bucks a month ?
---
A company lowers its quality out of greed and your solution is to throw even more money at it to fix it, alrighty then
---
I mained as a rogue, all through vanilla, and some of TBC (sucessfully in PVE and PVP) without even knowing what combo points are, or noticing them by my player panel.
---
I was a fucking dumb kid. Lol.
---
Probably Hunter.
---
I remember being a Tailor and selling 6 slot (Linen) bags like CANDY in vanilla.  Would have people bring me their cloth + 1-2 silver or something (I don't remember the exact numbers).
---
I would also sell all that I could make with the cloth I found and never had a problem moving them.
---
This was all done via the general chat of the starting areas and early level zones.
---
This leads me to believe that many people had a hard time finding 6 slot bag drops from mobs, or they would not all want to buy 6 slot bags from tailors.
---
Hahaha, love it. Its so stupid i love it
---
Given Vanilla flight times, it doesnt even necessarily need to be shitty sex either.
---
I can't play without the 2 dragons on either side of my action bar.
---
I remember experiencing similar RNG during Vanilla. Some of my characters would have a full set of bags by the time I hit the Barrens while others would have only 1 bag.
---
I would not buy bags from a vendor if you can avoid it. You should be able to buy Linen Bags from Tailors for 3-4s. You will save some money and also support local business!
---
I think you mean quests that are not obvious shaman quests. Quests that reward gear.

---
It's hard not to be vicious/condescending when people are bringing up the same 10 topics/questions multiple times per day every day.
---
I really question the sanity of someone who has played classic the entire time and by the time folks are geared in t2.5 and 3 is still in exclusively dungeon blues. 
---
Casual wow with no raiding is fun to 60, to rank 10 and getting your pre raid. If you‚Äôre sticking around for 6months to a year after hitting 60 and not raiding...why?
---
Wow‚Äôs 1-60 is brilliant, the endgame is great too, casual 60 play the second time through isn‚Äôt. 
---
My point is, I‚Äôm not worried about the equally small % of players who play for 2 years and never get out of blues just as I‚Äôm not worried about the 10-30 people per server who are going to be gunning for r14 prior to bwl release. 
---
Both ends are outliers. When aq/naxx come out, the gear floor will be zg/mc/blue pvp/silithus world items.
---
Given that demon hunter isn‚Äôt in the game during classic I‚Äôd go with the only hunter left.
---
Which is a hunter.
---
&gt; "If you don't like sitting an hour in queue to PvP, just don't PvP!"
---
Such a dumb position. If you are saying only those who make premades should be pvping then make a separate server-only queue for premades, there's no need to ruin it for everyone else who just wants to pvp

bow spec is pretty irrelevant, trolls are best because of berserking, but if you plan to do any pvp at all I'd probably roll orc, PvE wise they're not too far apart, but pvp wise they're miles apart  
---
However in all honesty the difference isn't huge and you should probably just pick whatever you think looks coolest since you'll be staring at it for dozens of days /played
---
Not important. Archmage is barely better than robe of winter night.
---
You forgot to add ‚Äúsubreddit is going downhill...‚Äù to the list
---
Ranged weapon skill is not as impactful as melee weapon skill because there are no glancing blows for ranged.
---
This fact, coupled with the fact that the weapon skill increase is "Bow" only (not crossbow or gun) devalues the troll racial.  BIS ranged weapons for hunter through the various tiers, aside from Rhok, are not "Bows". 
---
I would choose orc.
---
It's pretty sad how microtransactions have totally influenced how Blizzard designs their game. BfA in particular they cracked down on gold making methods because too many people were paying their subscription with ingame gold. It's a "deflation expansion."
---
Jim is paying the same $15 I am a month. If Jim wants to be showered in loot and be relieved from time sinks, retail is on the same sub.
---
&gt; **I've decided to play a hunter on horde side, which class do I go with?** 
---
I know there's an intelligent question in there somewhere.
---
Fair point about the boot enchant. My thought was that it would help a lot while leveling. 
---
I thought about reckoning too, since it also feels like it could be a lot of fun in pvp (thinking of a 26/25/0 for illumination and reckoning), but trade that potential fun for SoCommand. 
---
I may not be able to do without consecrate. If I drop Holy shield, I could probably get consecrate and imp ret. Maybe something like this. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxzZVGpI0zZVcxzbb
---
Hunter: pick Eye. A lot of people will say the pet trinket is unique, which is true... and it's also garbage DPS. 
---
The spear has nice stats, but you can get Ice Barbed Spear easily.
---
 Devilsaur Eye will last your entire hunter career because you can feign death -&gt; trinket swap.
---
"I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure given the mystery of our circumstances enjoying ourselves should be very high on our priorities lists, because literally why wouldn't it be." -me
---
step 1) follow your suggested rules.
---
step 2) see zero new posts here until the launch annoucement and subsequent launch.
---
I‚Äôd say hunter
---
So you saying that it would be reasonable if the subscription cost rose with inflation is trolling? And honestly maybe I just suck at picking these legendary games that are less than 30 bucks and playable for more than a month. Care to suggest a few, I've got time to kill before classic
---
Yeah i just checked into it. It was *revered*
---
Not quite as bad as exalted, but a little more of a sting than honored. Honored was the requirement after 2.3
---
All of them, grind boars
---
Fuck you! No changes!
---
No one knows? 
---
A completely valid response to your question is simple: TBC shouldn‚Äôt be handled. I don‚Äôt agree with that personally. 
---
But the viability of the systems in classic wow has absolutely no bearing on what blizzard may or may not do with a different content release in 2 or more years.
---
Finally, all bc content is still available, most of classic isn‚Äôt. Outland hasn‚Äôt changed in over a decade.

&gt;everything about that xpac was perfect.

---
TBC was better than everything that came after it, by a big margin. But better than Vanilla? Not a chance!
---
Mob tagging on a fresh server? How are the people helping you kill things supposed to level up? After a few levels, you'd have no one your level to help you because the ones helping you kill things didn't get any experience.
---
Also, griefers can break rules and share accounts to get ahead. As soon as streamers get into pvp zones, they'll be hunted relentlessly.
---
Not necessarily. If LFG was limited to just your realm, I could see using it. Although another disadvantage to LFG that I noticed when it went into effect is that all too many people never bothered to actually learn where the dungeons actually were. Made waiting for them to make their corpse run if there was a wipe rather annoying since they couldn't find the damn entrance.
---
&gt;got a blue sword . Wanted to enchant it so i learned enchanting and disenchanted it...
---
I definitely did this as a kid. "NOOOOOOO WHAT THE HELL IS THIS DUST? I just wanted my sword to glow slightly.. fuck"
---
That might have been true a year ago but there are thousands of people using this subreddit now. 
---
There is plenty of fun exciting things to post without the low tier content.
---
They said they are starting with a lean server/realm list to prevent that exact problem though?
---
Exactly. could always roll like three different pallys, but which to main?????
---
It's a sub for a 14 year old game that's getting re-released. Aside from actual news from blizzard there is no new or interesting content that we don't already have. The sub isn't going downhill, it started at the bottom of the hill because there's not really much to it other than a bunch of people that are waiting for the same game.
---
I LOVE LOVE love the 5 man dungeons! Every single one! So exciting!
---
Here's a 2006 guide for pally tanking.  I only scrolled through it but it looks like he uses holy shock as a taunt.  Pretty interesting.

As the kids say:  off.

over his head
---
BFA launched well after Classic was announced
---
You sound like you post on /r9k/
---
Yes. Thats what I meant. Quest rewards that give something so good itll last a good while.
---
You're not wrong, I think hiding names won't completely eradicate the problem, but making it alot more Hassel for them to do this every time will certainly slow it down I think. I'm all for hiding the scoreboard till the match starts.
---
No this is what this means.
---
Right now it's tough because there's no new content to discuss or post about, but I do agree this sub has become nothing but memes and karma-farming.
---
Mob tagging would just put you a little ahead of the pack.
---
Death and Taxes, probably the best and the well-known guild of classic wow
---
Troll is cool for me most funny race. Even the damage Output with troll hunter is ok.
---
T1 and T2 sets looks awesome on trolls
---
This sub has a very bad case of Old Dudes That Hate Memes syndrome. You want to ban memes even though they're the only type of posts that offer something new. Please tell me a better placeholder for them as we get seldom updates and the release date still hasn't been announced.
---
Are you one of those people that are curious about what we're gonna do after Naxxramas too?
---
PUGs like 99% of players will be playing
---
People tend to forget that in a 40man raid system, it is very much a seller's market for Raiders. There are almost always more raiders than raid slots, with guilds desperately trying to get member to fill up a raid. Getting into content is generally very easy provided you are someone who tries their best and brings their A game.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know why they even try. I do not get behind this change. The game was fine, let it be.
---
The end cracked me up
---
I don't plan on doing dungeons until mid 50s where I'll be doing as many BRD runs as it'll take to get the pre-raid bis items I need from there.  
---
It's not that I don't want to socialize or re-experience the world, it's that I've leveled at the very least 100+ characters to 60+ over the lifespan of the game, and I don't think I have much more than one trek to 60 in me anymore on a 1x server, so I'll want to get it over with.
---
So you still had at least 200 angles missing then?
---
Yeah you‚Äôre lower in line but keep grinding and going after prebis in 5s and when PvP gear comes out, get rank 10 gear
---
Mods!  Yes, this person right here!
---
You miss theirs. Barrens chat is indistinguishable from twitch chat, you are just bias.
---
Created my first dwarf rogue, named him Axebeard. had a blast leveling in Dun Morough, but it took me ages. After six hours or so I visited Ironforge for the first time and realised everyone spoke german? I played on a german-speaking server...
---
After realising my mistake I deleted Axebeard and created a new Axebeard on a proper english-speaking server. Leveled him up again and got to Ironforge where a gentleman informed me rogues couldn't wield axes... 
---
I then deleted Axebeard #2 and created my third dwarf rogue, Bradir! Leveled that fat bastard all the way to sixty wielding daggers, constantly going ambush &gt; gouge &gt; reposition &gt; backstab &gt; gouge etc. on every mob. 
---
16 days played time it took me, good times!
---
Really? You seen the title, if issues like this are annoying just stop reading/replying. I dont agree with the guy's ideas either, but there's really no need to take it any further than ignoring it.
---
I dunno where the idea that rogues were 'nerfed' even comes from. I'm not sure there were any direct nerfs to rogues at all through vanilla, at least 9/10 changes up to 1.12 were buffs for sure.  
---
Rogues are a powerful class in pvp. They do have some weaknesses and warriors definitely outshine them in many group group pvp situations, but they're still pretty good and really the best in the game when it comes to single target lock down in control.  
---
I think they're one of the funnest classes to play easily. Warrior is fun with the numbers and sounds, but really a monkey can play a warrior pretty well - Charge, MS, OP, WW.... you pretty much just hit things on cooldown on a warrior, there's not a whole lot of thought that goes into it. Rogue on the other hand requires a real strategy for every situation. Using stealth, stuns, gouge, blind, blind, spint, vanish- there's tons of strategy and planning that goes into your fighting.
---
I think I'll probably play at launch, but if I do I will likely just play like I play other games, at night when I'm not doing something else with my wife.  I know I'm in a minority on this sub.
---
Specifically a Horde Hunter
---
No day should disappoint you, as it marks another successful day closer to Classic launch.
---
That was the special event 4th of July Gun
---
I think it's the best part of the game. If 40 means weren't so stressful to get together I might think otherwise.
---
Ah ok that sounds right. On the topic of 2.3, I assume that would be the patch Blizz uses for the rereleased 2.4 in a few years. I hope they never, *never* introduce the 30% sweeping nerf to pve content. I remember just how much easier Kara got when that was introduced. It would just kill the longevity of the game.
---
No way dude that was just one of the extreme suggestions. Even I post shitty memes here. It's just getting out of hand IMHO. Some self-posts would be good for the community. 
---
The argument that "there's nothing to discuss until the game comes out" is just false. Skarm is constantly putting out fantastic videos. People still provide great content and discussions but they're drowned in memes.
---
After launch they‚Äôll be mostly decorative anyway
---
Of the class Hunter
---
I still don't trust them to actively manage servers intelligently. 
---
To be fair it makes it hard when dolts say shit like "you're ruining the community feel" (when Blizz merges servers) and shit like that when the server's dead anyway.
---
If server transfers are a thing it might not be as much of a problem, but it will still break up  friend groups
---
Not everyone understands that we have the sum of human knowledge at our fingertips.
---
Some can't google, some like talking, some just like playing and figuring it out for themselves..
---
I don't think that's true.  They could monetize old wow's model without being too intrusive or in your face.  But they don't really need to with a sub fee.  Just having more players is a big bump to revenue and profits.
---
"Oh.. fuck. I'm banned from Org."
---
Lmao.
---
Wife plays wow.  /flex
---
Well, every one of those low-effort posts you see, you report those right? And when you report those, they disappear from your feed, right?
---
Do you have a second account that you were then log onto in order to see if the moderators fully remove the post that you reported? I don't get it.
---
But that's the thing - Jim doesn't want to play retail. He wants to enjoy Classic while at the same time sissy it up enough for his wants and needs so that he can watch his 14 hours of MLP a day and still get epic loot.
---
You really can‚Äôt take flying back once you‚Äôve given it. That is the biggest factor I see between the two.
---
BC definitely had better balance with regards to classes, which is something that I'm jealous of
---
I think they could go in the direction of Classic itemization.  One of the things about post TBC WoW is that items got really homogenized and boring.  No more on use effects, procs were limited, etc.  
---
Going back to that "hand crafted" feeling for all the gear would be a big change they could do that I don't think anyone would really complain about.
---
The best part is the keyboard for the 2nd "Maps" computer is MOUNTED ABOVE THE MONITOR for the first.  When he wanted to type on it he would have to hold his arms up like he was riding a harley.
---
lack of new content 
---
satisfaction out of reach
---
read all the quest text
---
Point is, I'm not sure who you are directing your frustration at. Moderators? Each individual person making a low effort post that you don't like? Every other member here who sees a low effort post and does not personally report it?
---
Holy shit, my friends dad was in &lt;Death &amp; Taxes&gt; before he switched to mannoroth and started tanking for &lt;vodka&gt;
---
Wow that ashenvale belt is amazing... 9int 4 stam at like 18? Def have to do that.
---
Skinning is a great profession if you're focused on levelling speed. It costs you almost no time but gives you valuable gold towards your mounts.     
---
The idea behind skinning is it lets you get to 60 faster and easier, and then on a spare weekend once you are 60 you drop it and (because you are now 60 with teleports and mount and gold) you can max any profession you want at 60 now with far less time invested than if you were trying to do it while levelling.
---
Not really, from months on it was the same discussions over and over
---
I don't think that math works out for whales like that.  
---
Average whale may spend tons of money on a game compared to average f2p player, but, that's because average f2p players spend very little.  $0-5 annually.  Having 1 player of every 20 spend $100-500 annually isn't going to make up for losing a million monthly subs.
---
I played for several weeks in bird's eye view before a friend told me you could use the mouse to turn the camera. I have no idea why I never turned it vertically by accident, but my mind was definitely blown about my own stupidity. Still had loads of fun in those first weeks.
---
What was the large hit that made 1.12 rogue weaker in 1v1?
---
Dont forget half hour long fights in PvP
---
I bet you are right. I just remember exploring that zone and couldnt find a single quest related to it. It was so wierd for me at the time.
---
Druid.
---
Thanks for this man, I really appreciate it.
---
Everyone‚Äôs being annoying, but ya go orc. Troll raid dps benefit is minuscule and orc is way better pvp and probably is better for soloing also.
---
To warlock and priests:
---
Name 1 thing that's most fun about the class
---
Name 1 thing that's most annoying about the class
---
Next blue post:  this is internal for employees and their pets. Sorry for the confusion.
---
&gt;but there's really no need to take it any further than ignoring it.
---
Yes, there is:  
---
Blizzard is a bunch of idiots.
---
They have allowed vocal minorities to influence their decisions in the past, with negative outcomes that we are all oh so familiar with by now. Therefore, such threads need to be shot down by the community, to make it crytal clear that we don't want such bullshit in our game.
---
Introducing anything would be a massive shitstorm.  
---
BUT I think there could be a few things they could have without too much protest:  
---
1) Pets.  It was in your original list but since they were completely cosmetic people wouldn't hate them that much except for how "loud" they got visually.  
---
2) Emotes.  Exclusive emotes are a big part of f2p games now in lots of contexts (from Fortnite to Destiny to MHW).  They don't impact play and as long as they are just variety I don't think people would protest that much. 
---
3) Chat emotes/stickers.  Again, doesn't effect play, just gives people another way to meme.  
---
I know some people would protest this stuff but it wouldn't be obtrusive.  
---
I agree that anything like mounts, level boosts, and tokens would likely get more than a lot of backlash and would kill the spirit.
---
I think shit posts like this are more indicative of this subs decent into insanity while waiting for classic
---
Haha, reminded me of this video I recorded. Ah those were the days:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv7ok02cExI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv7ok02cExI)
---
Unbelievable the difference between mage and other classes. 
---
I‚Äôm here following my Vanilla pve rotation‚Äîhitting 1 every 2.5 seconds all night, making sure I‚Äôm spamming the key as the ability finishes to queue up another. 
---
Meanwhile the prot warrior and fury warrior have 3-5 key rotations.
---
Im not 100% sure but I believe the guild Surge was in top on that server. I do remember death and taxes
---
Oh yes. Also, prepare for a massive difference in leveling. In the first few zones in retail you‚Äôre basically face rolling everything, your regen is insane, etc.
---
In classic mobs are an actual threat from level 1. It takes way more time to level.
---
Im buying a laptop and just leveling at work. 
---
I'm a system administrator and over the summer I have no major projects assigned
---
Saying that‚Äôs the only outcome is a dumb position...  and I never even closely implied that. I implied if you don‚Äôt like a challenge don‚Äôt sign up to one.
---
yeah, like part of me really wants to be the flaming sword of justice and vengeance, but i also like healing. Buuuut kings and reck is so good too so its like aaaaaaaaaaaaasdfgh.
---
Like ret has pretty cool talents too like eye for an eye and all the 2h swinging action. Now i kinda feel like going holy to illumination and rest to ret for that sweet damage.
---
&gt;they're not getting the attention they deserve.
---
But you can't blame that on memes. If discussions and videos aren't getting enough attention, then people just genuinely don't care about them, or don't find them appealing. It's not like someone posts a very important innovative theory craft and it gets instantly drowned in a swarm of 100 memes. In fact, the mods here are very anti-memes, going as far as to remove them at their leisure.
---
Just let the memes be. If you don't like them, downvote them and move on. There are indeed some really low effort shitposts on the occasion that have to be removed for quality standards but you're only going to alienate the sub further and turn posters into lurkers by banning them as a whole.
---
good question because i am in the same boat.
---
i skill 0/3/48 and think would be enough for small dungeons. my plan is to enjoy with shadow. only if i am in hurry to create group i will heal.
---
You‚Äôll be fine then
---
its kinda weird. you can't really be a criminal in WoW like you can in the Elder Scrolls games, there's not really any way to do crime. if you're a rogue, you just kind of have to RP that you are a criminal.
---
you can't break into houses in Stormwind to rob people. there's nothing to steal. hell, there aren't even any doors! and looting stuff from things trying to kill you anyway is not theft, its spoils of war. you can only pickpocket enemies. you can only lockpick enemy chests. the guards are only there to give directions to you and (attempt to) kill the opposing faction on sight. the only crime in Azeroth is existing while not being in your faction's turf. sure you can attack the Booty Bay guards for Bloodsail rep, but they're really just a town of criminals/pirates themselves.
---
Whatever the quest is to collect Salty Scorpid Venom in the Shimmering Flats. The drop rate is no fun.
---
He was right, your health does regenerate 33% faster while sitting.
---
/r Oblivion very recently did this to great effect:  a simple tag for memes that could be filtered out if desired

Wife‚Äôs a stay at home mom. She already knows I‚Äôm gonna play this and I‚Äôm pushing 40. I think the only thing that saves me is that I quit raiding after killing OG KT with my 40 man guild that I was the leader of to date her.   So I‚Äôve already completed all of the content classic is going to be releasing.   That means I get to play casually with some buddies and just fart around and have fun.

Now if I tried to tell her I was going to play EVE online again she‚Äôd have a problem.
---
Not if you're alliance it ain't. If you're horde, go wild.
---
&gt;How important would it be for a mage to craft one of those?
---
Not at all, unless your idea of fun is to minmax every minor aspect of the game.
---
&gt;I want to run Engineering and mining
---
Then here is your answer: **Run Engineering and Mining.**
---
It doesn't matter if you "sacrifice" a .8% increase in potential dps (which are likely wiped by a single lag). It's simply not worth it, if as a result, you enjoy the game as a whole less.

They need a month after beta ends to [incorporate all the player feedback and bug reports that are generated in order to ensure a perfect launch.](https://i.imgur.com/C7vv2RL.png)

---
Being a little bit ahead of the pack does not prevent stream snipers from doing anything. Especially if the streamers fall behind because they can't grind 24 hours a day by sharing accounts. And actual fighting/regening only takes up to 25 seconds per mob. Even if you instant kill mobs at earlier levels, you're really only saving the ~25 seconds for maybe 100 mobs before you out level the ones helping you kill? You still can't any time traveling between mobs, picking things up, or going from quest to quest. The help it gives you is neglible on a fresh server, mob tagging really works great on mature servers when you can use a high level player to buff, grind, aoe, and give gears to the leveler.

I just decided to marry a nerdy weeb who understands my love of MMO's.

I'm so jealous. My husband has 0 interest in playing this game with me üò≠üò≠üò≠ Working on toddler-proofing the gaming room before launch!

Ahh nvm I understand your post now

Happy to help. Also Skarm has a good video about the Fury Prot build. Which is where I learned about it.

I agree with your point, Blizzard has fucked up alot in the past in my eyes, I completely stopped wow after the class changes in Cata. I just think that coming down hard on people with ideas will ultimately make the community seem hostile and toxic which will either push new people away from trying classic or just provide a negative view of the community in general. 
---
There will always be retail for people who think classic is too much for them.
---
You see skull if target is &gt;10 levels higher than you.
---
Agreed.
---
Yes, well worth it. It's also a pretty common strategy for clothies, especially PvPers. Take mining / tailoring while you level and save the mats to level engineering (there are lots of guides about what mats you need to go from 1-300 in engineering). Use tailoring for the bags and chest and to keep yourself in decent gear as you level, then drop for engineering. Bloodvine set is great, but you won't be able to get it until Zul'Gurub comes out in phase 4. As long as you hit 60 substantially before that happens, it isn't worth keeping tailoring just for that. You also have plenty of time to farm the mats to relevel tailoring if you want to go engineering until phase 4.

---
Yeah the fact that I'll probably be pigeonholed into healing no matter the content at 60 kinda bums me out. I've never been big into healing so I think warrior would be best, cause I enjoy tanking and DPS pretty equally and a class that can do both very well appeals to me.
---
Honestly I think the hardest part of going warrior over paladin is no free level 40 mount :(
---
You won't be able to do the same. The level cap is only 60.
---
&gt; But this won't happen, since it is a too drastic change.
---
It won't happen because the 'competitive' part of PvP in classic is competing against *your* faction, not the enemy one.
---
This is, of course, bass-ackwards, but hey, it's how it worked.
---
If I lived in a crowded and loud house, id love one.
---
TBC got class mechanics, raid/dungeon combat and prepaid attunememts better than vanilla . Everything else about vanilla was better, from leveling, to powercreep, to PvP/PvP itemization, and especially daily quests and flying mounts. 
---
If they had found a way to include arena and rbgs in Bc I‚Äôd have liked the PvP system (sans resiliance) more too.
---
&gt;why is rule 7 still so laxed?
---
You would be surprised how many people get super pissed off that we removed their low-effort meme.
---
The only memes/images we remove right now are the ones that don't relate to Classic WoW in an obvious manner *without* the title of the post. That's actually still a crap-ton of memes/low-effort posts. We still allow label memes (for now, at least) though I think all the mods dislike that.
---
I'm pretty confident that the mod team as a whole thinks low-effort memes suck and that we should increase how many we remove, but for now, we're trying to stick as best as we can to an objective system of "does the image itself obviously relate to Classic? Yes? It stays. No? It's removed."
---
We're not like most other gaming subs, IMO, because we're a gaming sub about a game that's ~15 years old... but is also not yet released. It's weird. There's a lot of stuff that's so thoroughly known it's insane, but then some things that aren't known. So, we get a lot of repeated questions that you've all seen a million times I'm sure (EDITOR'S NOTE: If I see one more "but what happens after Naxx!?" post without any new ideas I'm going to ban u/myri0). I'm rambling, but basically, we're in a weird spot with not much to discuss besides repeated trivial questions, so we're a bit more lenient on memes for the time being, with the expectation that we'll "crack down" more closer to/after launch, when more active discussion can occur.
---
Anyway, as always, send us ModMail if you have suggestions and report posts that suck and we'll take down the ones that should be taken down. We're open to suggestions, but there's obviously no one-size-fits-all answer to the memes, so we try to proceed with reasonable balance.

&gt; I just think that coming down hard on people with ideas
---
Those are not "ideas" though.  
---
Those are "begging for Classic but with retail-bullshit in it".  
---
If someone want's to discuss an actual IDEA, like serversplits to TBC continuation, or the possibility of added lvl 60 content on new realms, the community is actively participating and chewing it over.
---
But mindless begging for things we already know would ruin the show, because we've seen it happen, will result in us coming down hard.
---
Troll for PVE mixmaxing, Orc for PVP minmaxing. Tauren look ridiculously badass. At the end of the day pick whichever you like best aesthetically.
---
what it feels like to do the same daily quests over and over every day in retail\*
---
Assuming you mean ‚Äòwhat race‚Äô, the answer is Orc if you‚Äôre going to do any PvP. People complain about stun resist because it is OP in PvP. You want it.
---
Why did you reply to yourself, when you could have just edited your original reply?

VW shield is amazing and you should get it no matter what if you plan to PVP.

&gt;New people are going to use this subreddit as a resource for learning about the game

Said new people are doing it wrong then.

This subreddit is not meant as a resource for all things classic. It's a forum for fun and discussions. You want information? go to classicdb.ch and similar websites, they got you covered, in excessive detail.

Because I'm an absolute moron.

Commendable effort, keep up the good work :D

I appreciate the comment.

I don't plan on doing weekly raids, it just isn't really in the cards now that I have a baby and a wife. I might join a guild that lets me raid 1 night a week since I am rolling a healer. I just plan on taking it slow and doing dungeons on the weekends and pvp during the week. I no lifed it back when I was 16 and just don't have the drive to go hardcore again now that I am almost 30. My wife doesn't game much outside of mobile games so trying to convince her that I need 4 hours without interruption 3 nights a week would be a hard sell and not worth the hassle.
---
careful
---
this is how Medivh opened the Dark Portal
---
As many of you know or will likely soon find out, relationships and wow do not mix well and things fell apart.
---
We both moved on and now I have a wife, good job with a pension, 2 healthy kids, House with 2 car garage.  Obviously I wish I could go back to the early wow days when I was truly happy!
---
I‚Äôd choose Orc over Troll. 
---
1)Hit is pretty easy to get on hunter. T1 gloves add 2% hit, T1 shoulders add 1% hit, T2 legs 1% hit, you get 2% from pre raid rings, you can get 3% hit from a scope; and 3% hit from Talents.  So basically getting 9% hit isn‚Äôt hard once you‚Äôve raided a little. Also worth noting, weapon skill matters more for melee classes because of glancing blows. Ranged attacks can‚Äôt be glancing so you get less benefit from wep skill. 
---
2) Rhokdelar is only bis for MC. Once BWL comes out the xbow is BiS until basically Naxx. 
---
3) if you care at all about PvP, Orc is one of the strongest races to play (especially if you don‚Äôt like rogues).
---
Yes please
---
Death and Taxes may have been the most famous guild in all of WoW until Method came along. They were the guild that Blizzard worked with to write the first 2 dungeon companions
---
&gt; Beating people who look down on druids is extremely satisfying. A fully rank 10 or higher geared druid will one shot most level 60 mages before they can say "but my pick is META."  
---
Mages with good gear don't have a huge problem with druids. You certainly aren't 1 shotting, or 2 or 3 shotting any mage in pvp gear as a druid unless you've stacked every buff under the sun and you both have beserking.
---
Youre right.  No streamer gets past level 40.
---
For sure you could. But then bandage cloth would be limited.
---
I'll drink to that
---
&gt;e "begging for Classic but with retail-
---
look wegwacc, I agree with 90% of your your saying. But the coming down hard part just seems a little heavy handed. We can still be civil about all this. Why dont we just reply with something along the lines of: "retail has that feature, if you prefer that style of game"   
---
That way its less of an attack on someones thoughts and we are still drawing a line as to what we expect with Classic.
---
What kind of obscure items are you talking about?
---
This. Supply on demand.
---
When it Comes to  class selection you just can't cheat your way around the system. the more valuable a class is the more they are generally desired for both PVP and PVE content.  don't expect classes such as Warriors Rogues and Mages  to be a minority in numbers in your server by any means. You WILL compete. And to be bluntly honest, picking classes based on loot competition is not a good idea. You're gonna do it on every class. No way to escape it.
---
My plan is to ask my guild who is going tailoring and funnel them cloth to make bags for me.
---
I plan to do the same with enchanting and the early wands.
---
No one forces you to play that way.
---
No one forces you to invite such people into your guild.
---
No one forces you to join a guild that invites such people.
---
Therefore, the only waste of time I can see, is your pseudo-elitist posts, badmouthing people to play what they want to play in a 14 years old videogame.
---
This game has been completed. 1000 times over. You gain NOTHING by playing it to the absolute minmax possible. Get that into your head already. People who play this game for fun, are the ones getting their moneys worth out of it. People who spend their life badmouthing others for not playing the way they think is "best", are the ones who don't.
---
Is that a phone??
---
Covert normie exposed.
---
Never claimed the first three you implied I did?? You confused?
---
&gt;No "No Sex"
---
You can do it
---
As someone who played shadow and priest in vanilla I can say... maybe.
---
Short answer is that if you're in a guild that outgears content, then yes. If your raid is still "progressing" then it's going to be a lot harder.
---
It also heavily depends on your gear.  You will likely go oom very fast if you are 31 shadow.  You can potentially make up for that with a lot of really good potion management and mana gear/mana management.  But I wouldn't bank on it.
---
The main problem as I see it is that shadow gives basically nothing to healing and the healing trees do very little for shadow.  What makes it worse is the top of the disc/holy trees are very weak.  So while you can do it, it will be basically like playing an un-talented priest healing.  Which can work if you have amazing gear and a great raid group that ends encounters quick.  But if your group is still in dungeon blues trying to do MC, or in only partial epics in BWL then don't count on not struggling.
---
You are saying you had a 1920x1200 in 2005?
---
I'm not referring to oneshotting fully PvP geared mages. I referred to "most level 60s" which are generally *not* very thoroughly geared for PvP. The majority of those drop to a Ravage/FB 1-2 punch. Obviously if they have gear parity they will be harder to take, but even against equivalent gear levels I never struggled to drop Mages. Warlock on the other hand were AIDS for me...
---
Troll if you want to pve. Bow spec isnt totally useless but berserking is significantly more impactful then it seems because you bake it in with rapid fire and gives a multiplicative bonus.
---
Thats true, maybe its not as crazy as asian mobile game whales, would be interesting to see numbers.
---
Other games nowadays pick one payment method, blizz said f\*#¬¥ it, why not all of them :)
---
Why do you think that voice chat will be removed? That would be a worthy addition to Classic.
---
I made a post about the money I'm currently living off of "I am a professional botter AMA" I'm on mobile don't feel like finding it to link.
---
Its just my opinion, I just cant understand why ppl prefer classic, it was good for its time, it was something new, it was a first MMORPG for most of WoW players. I played through all expansions, current game is much more accesible.(I was having the greatest time during Wotlk,Pandaria,Wod) Example :
---
Doing a Sunken Temple for example required ~3h with fresh group/randoms, some ppl got lost even before entering the dungeon, and if someone dced you had to go back to town to spam chat(you could always try /who class 50-54(?)  and spam them one after another), and even if you found someone you couldnt summon him straight to the instance(even with a warlock in a group, you had to go back to the entrance) you couldnt use a summoning stone outside, you had to wait for him to get to the entrance (during that time some other guy who didnt expect it to be that long might leave, and you start all over again), a simple dungeon could take up to 3h, I‚Äôm adult now, dont have time for that...
---
Current wow got lfg tool
---
You find a whole team in couple minutes (and in normal heroic got insta ported)
---
Mythic dungeons - you can list your group/requirements and wait for other ppl to join, get to entrance and use summoning stone, if someoe leaves you list your group again. Easy and convenient.
---
I can think of more examples, The list is really long.
---
I know this sub attracts specific kind of ppl/gamers, thats why my opinion can be mistaken as trolling.
---
Ah fuck I hadn't even thought of that.
---
wowhead is bloated and runs like sht
---
Probably a better call
---
Enchating for Smoking Heart of the Mountain, and Mark of Tyranny (quest reward) are two that jump to mind right away. There are others but it's been a while, I would need to look them up.
---
I always liked my Orc on a Kodo mount. I grinded so hard and for so long to scrap together the runecloth for Thunderbluff exalted. And when the war mounts came out, riding around on a war Kodo was pretty dope. I'll probably do that again. Love the huge obnoxious size of the Kodo. The frostsaber is cool too
---
I‚Äôm treading on ice but MoP was fun to play. It was enjoyable. Not that it can touch pre-cata but IMO it was the best post-cata xpac.
---
Yeah, just keep doing it as you go.  Give them the cloth you wont be using for bandages and they'll love you.  You'll be stocked for bags all the way.
---
Am I in the minority for liking the feel of the original UI?
---
When theres one twink in the BG
---
Bring out the firing squad
---
I actually plan on running a spell power pally tank build. Obviously never going to raid on it but i think it would be boss tanking dungeons with it.
---
Gonna have to playtest a bunch tho when i hit 60 xD
---
Why would enchanting be mandatory?
---
I think you're 100% spot on their m8 :)
---
Did she ninja raptor mount in zg?
---
Too many subhumans here now. Cancerous sub.
---
I believe they added attack power scaling which changed their overall DMG. The talent tree was also entirely re-worked and their talents were refunded based off of it. I don't know specifics other than that.
---
&gt;You confused?
---
You angry? :D I pointed out that you don#t have to play that way, in a (fruitless it would seem) effort to make you realize that your blanket statement is pointless.
---
You made a blanket-statement, claiming that everyone who plays not the way you think is "right" is "wasting 39 peoples time". That's not true. If I am in a guild where a spriest healer is accepted, I am doing so because I chose to do so. If I am playing in a guild that is spending 6h in MC, then I am doing so because I want to.
---
&gt;People still beat old records
---
**No one gives a fuck.** What mattered, were the world firsts on the official servers, back in Vanilla. That's it. Train left the station.
---
Nobody will care which PServer goonsquad will "clear" MC the fastest on Classic. Nobody will remember anyones name in the guild that does it.
---
And yes, "Nobody" includes the PServer-elitist-super-hardcore-crowd who will take this seriously. Because that's exactly what they are: Nobodies.

I prefer this format to each of them making a 20 minute video about a 1 paragraph blue post.

---
DPZ has been very, very kind to investors
---
My plan. I'm going to be a dungeon slut.
---
Have you tried Hunter?
---
Mage might be a better fit for you. You have great flexibility with portals, being able to tune in for even 15 minutes and AoE farm will actually be rewarding, and every group wants a mage.
---
&gt; We can still be civil about all this.
---
We are prefectly civil. AFAIK, no one in this thread insulted the OP, resorted to _ad hominem_ or belittled him as a person.
---
&gt;less of an attack on someones thoughts
---
Thoughts need to be attacked. Opinions need to be challenged. If we stop doing so, out of a false sense of politeness, what we end up with is college students sueing professorts for not warning them about "triggerwords".
---
Austrian Dwarf Hunter is looking for a german/austrian or english semi-hc guild preferred on a (rp)pvp server. 
---
I always had a more competitive mindset, but since we are all grown up by now, 2-3 raids/week would be awesome. You can expect 100% raid attendance from me, loyalty and probably lvl60 in the first 14 days of release because I will take my days off of work to go full retard. I played since beta and dinged 60 on a pServer too.
---
The things I really would appreciate in my new guild are a garantueed raidspot(!!), inmature behavior from adults with black humour, a fair dkpsystem, an experienced leadership and the right mix between a serious and laid back raiding mindset to clear naxx with my new friends.
---
Hit me up! :)
---
What does that have to do with how long/annoying their attunements were...? How many bosses are in the raid has nothing to do with their attunement quests.. What a randomly arbitrary thing to say.
---
classic is very easy yes
---
this is why you always run into people with such huge egos
---
they have never been good at anything in their life so when they put in enough time (12hr+ days for months on end) they finally feel like they are "good" at something and don't want to realize how easy it actually is
---
any mythic raider or gladiator on live is so much better then these r word p word server no-lifers

Aviana already started planning and working on LUF for classic months ago.

You are thinking 2.0

Appreciate it!

I feel like my "Guide Voice" and awkward camera awareness will go away in a few. It did while I was streaming, just took a bit to get used to it.

Editing should improve as I do them as well lol.
---
When it came to use my talent points I didn't realize there were spec trees other than the one seen when first opening the window.  So, I became a moonkin.  Moonkin for life!
---
Not sure if people will be able to find value in prot paladins, but you absolutely need 11 points in holy for conscecrate, and I think 10 points in ret for deflection is huge.
---
Wow, you are really getting angry. Glad we sorted out that you lost this conversation hard. Good bye.
---
The ability scaling to garrote/evis etc was a buff to anyone not in greens. It was a nerf to 'naked rogue' fighting which was just a dumb meme anyway. The talent rework was also pretty minor, builds remained mostly the same just less silly things like imp throwing wep spec and imp distract were taken out. Overall it was definitely a buff, mainly to combat pvp and hemo.
---
Your the one shouting in the last comment haha
---
How is leveling sub more fun? Especially with swords. It doesn‚Äôt offer you anything. You‚Äôd level so much faster going combat or assassin.
---
Personally with warlock: I really love how strong the class is with lots of room to grow. Once you die tho, you'll need like 1 minute to rebuff summon demon and healthstone and to get full hp and mana after that. So if you die in world pvp its going to take a moment to get back on your feet. Also running out of soul shards doing bg's and having to go farm more or even worse, trying to get some from pvp.
---
Actually, your voice is pretty well suited for doing this kind of content. It's not making people fall asleep, it's not annoyingly high, and you speek at a normal, easy to follow temp.
---
It would breed more competition, and why would you cater to the 1% who are going to ruin the game for everyone else?
---
Honestly, the only LFG you should need is a Friend's List and a Guild. Be social, add people and play with them often. Make bonds, the vanilla style.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
never thought i'd see silvio dante in a warcraft commercial
---
I must have just gotten lucky. My wife enjoys her alone time as much as I do. Once the kids are in bed, I have hours to play!
---
In raids you usually spam shadow bolts, put the single curse you are assigned on a mob and banish some elementals. The actual skill is not to fall asleep (it happened to me...)
---
Without hesitation

I always like to pick up this helm because I can get it so early. just have to get a group but it is possible even though the quest is red. [http://classicdb.ch/?quest=1136](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=1136)

I'm trying to figure out the reason that pic has 0 views.
---
That's actually a relief to hear. 
---
I personally hate listening to my own voice but I guess a lot of people say the same thing about their own. Maybe that's why I'm a little self conscious about it.
---
It's trash. The cloth required for the level of gear you can wear is way outside of your ability to kill those mobs or run those instances. The only good use early on is for bags. For that I'm just funneling cloth to a guildie who is set on early tailoring.
---
Smoking Heart of the Mountain. I guess that only applies if you specifically want to tank.
---
To you.
---
I find the man with a fake marriage having to pretend to be someone else nonstop around his family to have a more depressing life than me. Most people's relationships fit that in my experience. 
---
If you can't be who you want to be and do what you want you have become a slave. Hope it's worth it.
---
Of course having a relationship where you hide absolutely nothing and are brutally honest with and to each other and do absolutely everything together and are soul mates is the dream I would trade everything for.
---
But it's just a dream, anyone reading this is lying to themselves hardcore if they think they have it. They have become stockholmed and brainwashed into believing they are the thing they have pretended to be for so long. Chomping at the bit for any opportunity to escape, even if for a little while, even with the crushing weight of the responsibility of their family constantly lingering just out of view, buzzing in their ear reminding them that they no longer have any real agency in their own life.
---
That's real sad.
---
Haha I agree with you on the "triggerwords" issue.
---
Im all for logic and reason, there just seems to be a lot of condescension on this sub which i think can be damaging to new or inexperienced classic players. At the end of the day, I just want a great welcoming and helpful community and classic WoW haha, because ultimately that's how I remember it.
---
Looking for guild that doesn't mind a Wrath baby. I am 39 and married with 3 kids and own a business so while I can raid, I am not available for hardcore raiding. The social aspect of a guild is far more important to me than the raiding chops.

I will main a Rogue or Hunter.

Because I cropped it and posted it as hidden just before I made this post

I swore having this problem on Chromaggus specifically.  We kept getting the Ten Storms shoulders as alliance.
---
It never happened in vanilla.
---
Ahh, okay. So the drops in Classic will be restricted to Pally in Alliance raids and Shaman in Horde?
---
This was not a low effort meme. I was told as long as I included "Classic" within the meme itself that it qualifies for a post. This subreddit is constantly silencing me. This meme had a lot of comments &amp; traction...
---
It took the average player around 10 days PLAYED to get to 60. This was not just grinding grinding grinding. This also included people exploring the world, hanging out in cities, farming, profession leveling, looking for groups, pvp, etc.  
---
Yes you can go much quicker, know your route, be efficient, ignore most professions, have a good core group. But we are talking about averages here, some people were much slower.   
---
Hope for the best plan for the worst.
---
It's delicious!!!
---
I'm not going to hype myself and just assume it's the devs keeping the CDN updated from changes they've done in their close house testing.  
---
If Beta is coming, Blizzard will give us a heads up to get maximum media attention.  
---
My assumption
---
In my opinion, the person that spent time scouring through someone's entire post history is always going to be the bigger loser in the equation, irrespective of what you find. I think OPs idea for LFG is asinine but you should be embarrassed.

Sweet dreams are made of these

It's not the same mindset as before though, that will never be recreated
---
bag drops on pservers are 100% higher than in vanilla; it's actually ridiculous how much they drop.  there's a reason draenei/blood elf start zone gave you some shitty token 4 slot bags early and it wasn't to replace them with a full 6 slots an hour later.

I came up with something similar...

I'm usually the guild Tailor/Enchanter. People funnel me Linen and I hand out bags like candy on day 1. I get to level it and people send spare cloth also, so I end up being able to make gear appropriate to my level. :)

Oh hai me :)
---
This was an issue at one point, but was quickly patched.
---
Its pretty obvious that he miswrote race.
---
That priest though...
---
Underrated comment
---
LMFAO!
---
Farmed Headmaster's Charge rofl
---
Literally one of my top goals.  You got me.
---
So, you are here, in that sub forum, ready to start to play wow classic again, to throw you everything IRL to play. Did I sort this out?
---
PREACH.
---
DnT was definitely the best guild on that server, and in the USA as a whole.
---
priest however are always targeted first in any pvp. Not the safest class to play.
---
Lucky. Why can't it be a choice dammit üòÇ
---
&gt;one person in a capital city so they can spam trade chat for filling dungeons
---
But that was just how it was back then and it worked fine tbh.
---
If anyone wonder how you will look after your rank 14 grind, this picture pretty much sums it up.
---
LPT: Shoot for singular *wife* üòÇ
---
Play Paladin. 
---
They can tank and heal dungeons easily. Primarily a tank healer. Later into the game, can become a solid off-tank for raids due to aoe abilities.
---
Pretty sure it was local to the zone you are in.
---
A properly played mage beats rogues. It can be close, but there are perfect counters to all those CD‚Äôs. Especially during 1.12
---
You say that but we even see it on the shorter lived private servers
---
In my experience, rogues and warriors quite literally can't 1v1 anything
---
Ehhhhh, I disagree. Wow has tried adding voice chat multiple times. It just turned out to be awful and was never used. Right now, people don't use it either as far as I know. People stick with discord anyway. Back then vent.
---
Lets just say I was real nervous on my way back to shadow prey
---
Jarod Shadowsong probably, there are other named LT‚Äôs of Kurtalos‚Äô army but we don‚Äôt know about their eyes, however we can assume they did have the ‚Äúdestined for greatness‚Äù yellow glow.
---
this rules
---
If that‚Äôs not goals idk what is
---
~~worth~~
---
I‚Äôve been subscribed since December 2005.
---
Rogue vs Mage is a timing fight on both sides.
---
Get engineering and tailoring, craft the robe, drop tailoring for engineering, then grab tailoring again when zg comes out. Best of both worlds.
---
It was in for awhile, maybe end of classic or early to mid BC. It was fucking terrible and I think they removed it or just hid the feature for it
---
I guess I should also say that despite appreciating computers and using them daily, I know very little about what makes them run.
---
Considering how trivial it is to bypass, I really doubt it's to keep people from downloading the client. What other reason would there be to do so intentionally?
---
Wow, guess I got a little lucky! It‚Äôs a laptop, though, so maybe not? Lol. 
---
The power saving options worry me a little, even though I turned most off, but especially with the throttled processor. That guy runs 4 cores at 2.2GHz with a ‚Äúturbo boost‚Äù that kicks up to 4.1GHz - but I can‚Äôt find any manual controls. Looks to be all automatic. That and proper cooling are a little worrisome, so I‚Äôm hoping it was built right for that - I still haven‚Äôt heard the cooling fans kick in. This thing is QUIET
---
But I‚Äôm hoping to learn how to engage it properly so I can get at LEAST 50% setting to run in raids smoothly - pretty much like my vanilla WoW experience.
---
Blizzard should make specific servers just for streaming and anyone that's caught streaming on a non streaming server gets BANNED!!!
---
Would it be bad to give a rez to druids. I would not change the vanilla experience tbh
---
They don't ruin it for everyone else, that is throwing it out of proportion, and there is nothing stopping you from reaching their lvl of play too. It also isnt catering, this is how it was already set up, changing it would be catering to people. 
---
I was not a hard PvPer but I could still hold my own (joined a few matches a week), still could get into matches, and could come out of it w/ being so upset.
---
want to briefly chime in and say they did double the HP of mobs, twice, to my knowledge. the first was some time in mid legion. the second was when they were revamping the leveling in late legion. both times it was met with heavy criticism and rightfully so because the mobs still couldn't ever hurt you, so it just made combat even more boring
---
I‚Äôm also hoping for this seemingly reasonable outcome myself
---
You mean genetics.
---
Is it ever coming?
---
Yeah, just hoping to get some knowledge of any random thing that comes to mind as a pain in the @$$ - possibly avoid those dudes while leveling
---
Every shaman seemed to have them too
---
Yep. Tried BFA, didn't like it.
---
Yes its been so long I remember dnt also. I may be thinking of the server Burning Blade that surge was on. I was so jealous of them with full nax set.
---
I should have mentioned that I roll horde...
---
So basically this thread has turned into Reddit‚Äôs version of BfA
---
You can poop w/o having a tube-sock around and still play on a laptop
---
its pretty obvious that people want to experience wow the same way they did back in vanilla. but i dont understand how could they actually think thats possible. everyone knows the dungeons, raids, items etc now. there will be zero exploring in classic and thats what made it amazing when we first played it.
---
Good points, will consider it. Thank you!
---
Seems like the best pallies I met played this way - they learned not to use gear as a crutch and became super skilled at their class
---
We let ours respec for nights we knew we were doing chromag after getting stuck on a arcane/nature rotation 1 week.
---
That and logic: ‚Äúhe just vanished, so I‚Äôm gonna pop R1 Blizzard right here...‚Äù *POP* ‚ÄúAh, there you are...‚Äù
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I'm going to lose weight bc i'll be to addicted to get some. (super small town no uber eats or stuff like that)
---
On the other hand, no resurrection ability makes partys more sympathic towards Prot- and Retpalas, Oomkins and Shadowpriest as DPS/Support. :D
---
Maybe not a true noob moment but I was attacking astranaar on my orc hunter, and there was a night elf rogue who was getting the best of me. I ended up scattershotting him, feign deathing and mounting away somehow, but he used an engineering frost trap reflector and walked into my frost trap and froze me on my mount, caught me and killed me. It was the only time I ever saw it happen, and it was very early in classic, I was level 42 maybe. The fucker
---
Smart mages pop Blizzard on top of themselves, smart rogues pop vanish and move lateral first and then circle for the auto crit ambush. Like you said it is a tight fight but it is not always a mage wins fight nor is it a Rogue wins fight.
---
I'm sure he got the joke. He's just pointing out that the joke doesn't actually make sense
---
Well you got me there! 
---
I didn't originally think about ony, but I'd say a single boss non entry level raid isnt really comparable to the first raid of the expansion.
---
You can start onys attunement prior to hitting max level and there weren't any rep gates holding you back from the instances. It didn't feel like a massive attunement because compared to Kara's, it isn't. It's a chain that runs you through a couple of instances and all over the world.
---
fwiw im not sure something and be both random and arbitrary
---
+200 pounds or so. A lot of sitting around is needed.
---
Though I suppose if you get so into the game that you stop eating much you eventually turn into the crypt keeper instead.
---
I want to play Warrior but I am Leaning towards Paladin. How big are my chances of actually getting to run dungeons as a Protection Paladin? Will I just get hissed at and ignored or will i get accepted? This whole thought process have made me interested in running a Mage as main instead. But I also want to play Warlock. I'm so confused really. Does anyone have any good tips on how to pick the right class?
---
It's quite the shitty inn tbh
---
 http://www.guilded.gg/r/AdXEN5Vvml?i=841VqM5d
---
That‚Äôs why instead you just make a lvl 49 boomkin twink
---
i did that when I played paladin, you never had to drink mana you just hit monsters for hours and hours with the passive buffs
---
Ah of course but I always just drop enchanting after getting the trinket since it has little use otherwise.
---
And at that beserking isnt even that great as it costs a GCD and unless you are about to die you wont get much more than 10-20% normally
---
Paladin is the superior PvP healer due to how tanky they are.  
---
Priest is the superior 1v1 in PvP.
---
I don‚Äôt have a phone. Do you ?
---
I'm sure the guy who made the joke knows that it doesn't actually make sense. No need to point it out.
---
Well Adderall does curb your appetite
---
What do you do for work?
---
And you need to decide if you want to be a tank, healer, or dps
---
Yo let‚Äôs try and hold off on the 30 minute videos analyzing this tidbit before we get an actual update from Blizzard how about that ?
---
it reduces the cast time of aimed shot, its amazing.
---
I sold eye of the flame cus i got green head with more stam as warlock.
---
I also lvld my friends 19lvl warrior twink to 22 and sold his twink blue axe (cant recall name nightreaver or something) 
---
I also sold hyacint macaw to a vendor since it took bagspace ...
---
Yeah the good 13 year old me had no clue üòÇ
---
I would attribute that to the much smaller population
---
Laptop so you can play wherever, whenever. Classic wow won‚Äôt require a super rig
---
That's going to depend on the guild you're in, the people you play with, who else they have in their raid and...
---
Sounds like you want to be looking for a guild with low-stress, lax occasional raiding.
---
And if you can't find that Guild, make that Guild
---
by 10% at full health, and as I said costs a GCD, Not sure how long aimed shot is but, I doubt 10% of it is = to the GCD
---
GGGAAAAATTTOOORRRAAADDDEEE!
---
I got my tailoring up to 75 before level 10 this way, just having people bring me their linen and lining up for bags. I think I made about 50c-1s profit on each bag and got skillpoints.
---
I leveled a lot of characters in vanilla and my general feeling is that bags were hard to come by if you didn't visit a tailor. Sometimes you found a 6-slotter early on, but it was definitely not the norm
---
LH had a pop larger than what the original severs held.
---
ad infinatum
---
it doesnt cost a GCD.
---
aimed shot? cus beserking 100% does I can record it if you want, it'll take awhile though
---
The change was already made during classic, it's when they added battlegroups I think. So changing it would be true to vanilla. And yeah if you are getting graveyard camped in wsg that's a good deterrent from getting as good as them.
---
And there‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôm not leveling a warrior first this go-around. Those ‚Äúmovements‚Äù were a pain in the @$$...
---
Generally you'll take a 40% performance hit for every dollar you spend on a laptop versus a desktop.
---
That's not accounting for separate monitor / keyboard you need for desktop.
---
Granted these days if you're only interested in classic get anything with a decent cpu (4ghz + at least dualcore) and a 10x0 gfx card (1060/1070/1080) and you can run most games at near highest gfx at 60 fps 1080p.
---
SSD helps with loadtimes, nice to have, but expensive.
---
i bet it smells like autism in there
---
I mean, I have an average laptop from 2015 (believe it was $500), and I can play retail on high* without lag. It's really nothing special - I pretty much got it because I needed a laptop, and I wanted it to be able to run the games I already owned. I imagine for the same price nowadays, you'd be fine. I can check the specs if you want.
---
*as long as I turn off the crazy shadow effects
---
Without a release date, they could just keep postponing it forever. A release date is at least somewhat peace of mind :P
---
i dont think youre using berserking correctly which is why you think its bad, you wouldnt pop zerking unless yur auto shot is on CD, then you pop zerking to makeyour aimed shots/auto shots take less time to cast, its the best dps racial for hunters period.
---
As far as I know AB is preferred because it‚Äôs more efficient and will still end with 3/2 games switching back and forth, it is still a waste of time if it draws out and people will definitely dodge if they can since. 5 cap game is much more honor/hour. 
---
An actual benefit for competing with the best would actually be really good, but yeah certain kids will get their panties in a bunch.
---
I don't play a hunter, Just applying the math ive seen on troll mages using beserking.
---
But which class though?
---
its 10 or more
---
Thanks for the info. Any idea what price range that puts me in?
---
Well then I have enough time.
---
I have the exact same thoughts man. The top things every week are stupid memes. Not even clever. Just lazy memes people throw together in under 4 seconds. Topics that should be discussed are buried under layers of useless crap. Getting a bit tedious. Sure I will get downvoted for this opinion as well, but whatever.
---
VC stands for VanCleaf.
---
1-1.5k I think for the lower end gfx cards
---
The main problem of resto druid is the lack of rez (you only have battle rez which have a 30min cd). So you will have to bring a ret or a shadow priest with you or be sure to not wipe.
---
I know alot of resto druid on pserver get their gear mostly by tanking nowadays because of that (and it's faster to find a group as a tank).
---
Trolls are cooler looking, for what it's worth
---
(They were my favorite commercials back in the day)[https://youtu.be/zXeyYdGoLCU]
---
Yeah well you know that's just like, your uh... your opinion, man
---
Much appreciated. Makes sense that there has been so much improvement seeing as it‚Äôs been so long. I remember having to put graphics on low, but I was also playing on my parents desktop who refused to upgrade since ‚Äúit worked just fine.‚Äù
---
i choose to believe
---
you can probably get dungeon placements pretty well, while levelling people just kind of want any tank in general and the AOE that prot pally has is useful in a lot of the 60 dungeons
---
it's really raids and maybe more hardcore guild play where you won't really be able to be prot at all
---
i am torn between wanting to help test the game and find any issues, and not wanting to burn any leveling energy off haha
---
Thanks. Hopefully people take a critical look at the state of this subreddit before the game launches. Otherwise we're in for a shit show.
---
Hell no, as a druid i don't want a normal res because it allow me to be lazy in raid after a wipe ;)
---
Globalism, world markets, international trade, blah blah. Just do your part and everyone will go down together.

Here he(Asmongold) comments on the whole event!
---
Warrior/Mage
---
Wasnt nihilium the most famous ? And in europe i think to recall iT was memento mori (shattered hand and later frostmane) iirc
---
That's better there for a while. Probably just fixed a typo or something. Or just pressed the saved button on that webpage for some reason.
---
Versionnumber: 1.13. 
---
Woah. Who wants 1.12 when there‚Äôs 1.13.
---
Desktop will absolutely be better value for your money. However, laptop makes sense if you travel a lot and want to game away from home, or if you expect to LAN with a friend or something. Also, if you need a laptop for non-gaming purposes it might be more affordable to get a single gaming laptop to use for everything instead of getting a laptop and a desktop.
---
Personally, I have both. I greatly prefer the feel of playing at my desk with a desktop PC and 34" monitor, but I need a laptop for work anyway so I made sure I got one that could at least handle some light gaming.
---
One last point: latency is significantly better with a wired connection. Net code today is pretty good at hiding it, but it's still there. A desktop you plug directly into your router with a network  cable will shave off a bit of latency compared to playing on a laptop with wifi. Laptops with physical Ethernet ports do still exist, but are getting rare...
---
It wouldn't be worth it really, you'd have to spend a lot of linen to level up to 50 before you can craft the bags, you're better off either picking up skinning and vendoring all the skins for buying bags and/or just wait for one of the million tailors offering free craft of bags to show up.
---
If you're not going to be travelling about on a regular basis and wouldn't really benefit from the mobility of that a laptop brings then you should absolutely go for a desktop. 
---
For the same price you can get a better rig with a bigger monitor and who knows what the future may hold as you may find another game that you want to play that requires the extra specs and being on a laptop really limits you in regards that.
---
I think Nihilum was most famous as far as realm and world firsts went, but the rep of Death and Taxes, in my wow experience anyway, was much bigger and well known
---
TBC pre-hyjal attunement nerf, yes please. I'd want to fully relive classic vanilla first. At least 2/3 years, but I could see rolling onto TBC eventually. Though if new vanilla content is an option or TBC scaled to 60, probably like that better. Limiting flying just to TBC continent or removed with bridges/portals to access fly only areas.
---
Probably any dps class will fit with what you're asking. Tanks have limited slots in a raid.  Healers, while not exactly challenging, have to have a little more focus and raid awareness that I find to be draining. Mage if you like casting, warrior if you like melee with the potential to tank/ot.
---
I'm a druid and i'm tanking in AQ40 fine. Even maintanking on twins and ouro. Sometimes fankriss and sartura too.
---
damn. I got excited when I saw the recent edit.
---
&gt;It's not about individual skill. A premade is a coordinated group of 10 (probably geared) players arranged into an optimal comp, all in discord together.
---
Then do this, its a multiplayer game, you don't see people complaining they can't do 5 mans and 40 mans on their own.
---
I was only young and niave. I asked my brothers friends to help me name my first character (a dwarf hunter) they all suggested Phallis
---
I dinged level 20 before I realised and deleted..
---
I remember do something like this in Stratholme, I think it was my first ever instance and I was so clueless about everything then. Shortly after I really started getting into running dungeons, the change came that reduced most of them down to 5-man max.
---
This, after playing mage in vanilla for the last decade I can tell you its mandatory if you care about min/max.  Your second prof would be engineering unless you are one of the guilds nominated enchanters.
---
One of the things I'm most excited for with Classic is the wide variety of weapons, some with very unique and fun effects. Which class do you believe is able to (viably) use the most of these weapons with cool effects?
---
I loved the PVP in that game!
---
The Volkswagen Fox did have comfy seats. I should have done this with mine after the electrical problems instead of trading it for beer.
---
Yeah I was actually thinking about this. My memory isn't amazing do I don't remember the servers being like this back in the day for world events?
---
Laser Chicken
---
Bis trinket are blue from a quest and a bop enchanting recipe.
---
Druids rings and cloak are the one with alot of armor, warrior tank will prefer threat items on these slots.
---
Also druids won't take your weapons.
---
And about the leather, most are only good for druid (high stamina and armor and few dps stats, only 2 bis pieces are also really good for rogue).
---
Also druid single target threat is by far superior to a warrior.
---
Professor Hunter's class.
---
Those are two opposites.
---
Hey, thanks just for reading all of that, lol! That's interesting... I think that you're probably right that WotLK aligned so well for me precisely because of, ironically, all the things that made it such a bad experience for you. I'm sorry about the rogue, and about the PvP stuff. Like I said briefly in the post, I definitely don't have anything against PvP or think that it should be privileged over PvE balancing, or anything... but I do know that I know absolutely nothing about it. So the way that it changed didn't affect my gameplay experience at all.  
---
As far as the gear/itemization went, I actually really liked the badge system. I didn't feel like I geared up too quickly... if anything, that was a level of accessibility that I actually preferred. VoA may have made things too easy, but the pace of it, otherwise, made me happy. For the level of raiding that I was doing I definitely felt like I had something to progress to throughout the entire expansion, and new content that I felt like I was unlocking. Ulduar also, of course... great raid.  
---
Important for me to remember, though, that when it comes to MMOs, itemization and PvP are huge. And, ironically, they're some of the things that I have the least strong opinions about. It was definitely more important to me to feel like part of a more cohesive world and to get to enjoy good writing. When it comes to itemization and classes, I always want to feel like there's a challenge, and I definitely don't want to eat up content too quickly... but Wrath gave me a feeling like, every raid or every dungeon, no matter what I was doing, I was progressing in some way. So in that sense, I think that might be the only thing I disagree with in what you say. The itemization definitely worked for me because I liked having that sense of progression, and I loved doing "John Fuckin Madden" as a cat (challenging to keep up during fights).   
---
Important for me to remember, though, that this is a really big game... All of those changes that you mentioned were things that never even pinged on my radar., except maybe the Vault of Archavon items. That's really interesting. I'll keep that in mind if I ever get the chance to make a game (haha pipe dream ;) )  
---
Thanks again for the thoughtful response.
---
Why is it that games of premade vs premade WSG last so long? I had always assumed that because of the burst heavy nature of vanilla that FCs would be easy to kill, and that battles in mid would quickly swing in favor of one side or the other.
---
No problem. I'm not near my laptop at the moment or I'd give you specifics. (All I remember is it has 6gb of RAM, and an integrated AMD Radeon... something. I'd have to check.) I'd say just check online / look at models in a store, jot down some of the specifics. Google a graphics card you haven't heard of. I don't think you'll have any issues finding a machine to run it, just research before you buy.
---
Unless you want to run it on Super Mega Ultra High with no lag, ever, even around 1000 other players all casting spells.
---
man I loathe this quest, all the others from goblin raceway are completed yet this one will keep you grinding for another hour :D, and its not like you have a nice tight farm spot either they are dotted all over the place.
---
blizzard is a small indie company you cant expect that many people in the open world , the servers are setup for like 10 people per shard
---
tbh im just surprised they didnt ban him for causing lag
---
Well a lot of it has to do with the amount and probably size of server side code that is being executed and processed. Really only people who have worked on true PS projects can shed light into this. 
---
The difference the in ‚Äúgame engine‚Äù is a big concern as classic will use the newer one I understand. But yeah, great post. This is my biggest concern.
---
Lol plenty of people would
---
&gt;now I have a wife, good job with a pension, 2 healthy kids, House with 2 car garage.
---
Yeah, not for long!
---
Back in bc to get lag fests that bad you needed a raid of at least 200, we did that a few times on my old server raiding the alliance capitals
---
Then who was phone???
---
The riding a harley bit really made me laugh ahha
---
With a laptop you're pretty much beholden to what the manufacturer has done. Sometimes they offer overrides of defaults (like undervoltage/-clocks inn the BIOS), sometimes not; sometimes there are no such power saving defaults anyway (there shouldn't be.)
---
Good rule about laptops is if it's bulky you'll have plenty of cooling and shouldn't have to worry.   
---
Asus ROG laptops for instance are bulky because they are actual gaming laptops and have proper cooling so they don't have to throttle.
---
If you want to test the cooling, it's fairly easy. Run the CPU and GPU respectively on max load for a while and if your laptop doesn't turn into a hovercraft you would be golden.
---
The Nvidia Settings program also monitors power level so you know it's actually running at max.
---
If I was to make a 49 twink balance druid I'd probably skip moonkin form. What do I need armor for when the entire balance playstyle revolves around kiting and avoiding damage.
---
More than anything else in classic what I would love to see is some kind of system, no matter how small, that rewards players in PvP based on performance over time invested.
---
Why would people give him all that?
---
I think that is more of an indication that there is more garbage here than one person can pick up alone. Garbage can click on downvote buttons too, you see.
---
Oh, I am so sorry for both of you. I leveled a prot pally in TBC and it was a blast. So many talents had such a great synergy for AoE grinding; just pull a half dozen melee mobs and let them beat themselves to death on your shield.
---
A good healer (i.e. good player) is a good healer and can make any of the healing classes look better than the others.
---
The reverse is true as well of bad healers.
---
Played a ret paladin in vanilla but raided with a guild who was accepting. I‚Äôm going to be playing more casually for classic and I‚Äôm worried if I roll ret I won‚Äôt get invited to any PUG raids, or at least not allowed to roll on 2hs. I know how the stigma was in the past, I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs still as bad these days, at least on current private servers?
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love vanilla, but a new game with a new engine and story would be amazing.
---
Absolutely. We have to be thinking "what's next".
---
There's a reason why I keep going back to Everquest 1 and Classic WoW servers.
---
I am sure there are other devs keeping an eye on Classic WoW and it's success/failure.
---
The aspects of these games that draws me back, is mostly the social side. MMO's were built to be *SOCIAL* games after all, and they drilled that point home. As well, when you got something shiny, you *EARNED* it, and people would see it and applaud you for it. Still remember hanging out in LAGromar with my moose antlers (T2 druid helm) and had people stop and stare at them (or was it my pineapple on a stick on my back.... either way).
---
But nothing can really top hearing the words "CROSSROADS UNDER ATTACK" and seeing a dozen or so hordies stop their duel, mount up and ride straight for the flightmaster, ready to go to war.
---
How else would you marinate your steak?
---
Getting her to play with me. Now just need something to get her completely hooked as she hasn't played that seriously before. Any suggestions?
---
Had a boomkin in wrath. Kept getting annoyed that blizzard would keep redesigning the spec rather than just buffing the damage...
---
Nothing felt permanent with that class/spec.
---
Priesst with the old school version of the Devout set. Had these too!
---
It's okay friend, you can have your midlife crisis in WoW Classic. Get the shiniest mount and swag T2 Gear.
---
It's cheaper than getting a fancy car IRL.
---
I‚Äôm going laptop, Cos I need to be mobile with work, and also need to be sociable with the wife.
---
I was thinking of the Sapper Charge. Being able to make your own is a big plus.
---
I just checked what it is and it looks very interesting
---
Is it good or is it a meme ?
---
We didn't have cross server BG's back in classic, on my server when we were doing premades we were hitting premades on the opposite faction. It was really bad at some points that the enemy faction was literally 10-man dodging us as they were sick of getting smashed.
---
My tactics for not pissing my wife off?  Making sure to help her farm the gear she wants.  
---
LOL at having a non-playing wife.
---
That's tricky to do, as what happens if you were on defense in AB? Your performance for that BG will suck. (Same for defense in WSG instead of playing midfield)
---
I never knew who did it (if it was a friend or otherwise), but when I'd just scraped together enough money to buy my first mount &amp; riding skill, there was a mail waiting for me and I went to check it out.
---
It was a "present" from someone I didn't know, but I went ahead opened it while not yet knowing what "c.o.d" meant and thus sending 80gold away to a kind gift sender. Oh the despair of that naive moment.
---
Lesson was well learned, never again open any mail from unknown sources!
---
Rogues have cheap consumables and are pretty relaxed. You also have vanish to avoid death sometimes. You can sneak around gankers in front of raids and dungeons. I'd say rogues are your best pick. Locks have to watch aggro, mages have to conjure a store every raid. Hunters have to kite sometimes. Warrior dps is pretty much the same but without any escape option.
---
We can hope.  But honestly who can sayz
---
It would really crush competitive PvP though, I think pairing premades with premades would be best, even if that means longer waits. (Or at least it should try)
---
I don't need any tactics. My boyfriend and I met through wow and are probably going to play classic together.
---
In my first few weeks of playing, I kept mashing the auto attack button, thinking it would make me attack faster. 
---
I also got really mad when I kept collecting these pet collar junk items and other things thinking I could put armor on my pet only for my friend who got me into the game to tell me that you couldn‚Äôt customize your pet‚Äôs look. 
---
I bought a scope on the Auction House, after seeing a picture of a Tauren with a gun (don‚Äôt remember which one) that had a scope on it in the game guide. You can imagine my disappointment when I opened my mailbox and found out that wasn‚Äôt the case.

This is completely false. I'm 32.

1 weapon skill gives 0.04% crit in PvE.

Weapon skill also gives extra hit but doesn't scale linearly:

300 = 0%

301 = 0.4%

302 = 0.8%   
---
303 = 1.2%

305 = 3%  
---
306 = 3.1%

307 = 3.2%

308 = 3.3%  
---
309 = 3.4%  
---
310 = 3.5%  
---
311 = 3.6%  
---
312 = 3.7%

314 = 3.9%

I'm subbed because ethically I cannot unsub while playing private servers.
---
Or just be a big brained boi‚Ñ¢ and macro start attack into all of your abilities.
---
&gt; Huge fights like this is part of the Vanilla experience! 
---
So is lagging out and crashing the servers. Heck the amount of people doing tuesday raiding would cause the servers to lag and break. There were days when guilds would call off raids because the servers were lagging to hard. This isn't something new for WoW.
---
As Horde, yes..because I can't just quest and/or grind and there's tons of fun to be had in instances with grabbing every serpentbloom before the other 4 people in my party do and all the sweet sweet xp and rewards to be had. I also want to see if the white murloc in WC is harder or easier than pservers...
---
No, Barrens chat in vanilla was not like twitch chat. Go on a pserver and read barrens chat, half the chat is recruiting for Klan rallies it's fucked up.
---
&gt; Who‚Äôs the smart one now?
---
I was 21 married with kids during Vanilla last time, I'm old school negligent, I cant recall my daughters first steps but I recall that first epic loot drop.
---
Sorry for any vagueness an argument can be made for keeping Goblin engineering if you want to make your own supply of [Goblin Sapper Charge](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10646). It's a powerful grenade that is great for PvP. Most useful items in the Gnomish tree are trinkets you can make whereas for grenades you need the recipe to make more.
---
A mount? I'm not made of gold! Back in my day (level 39) we walked to our destination and we did just fine, only 80 deaths.
---
Yeah you should get a chat timeout for that. It'll be even easier to report in classic too üòç
---
People saying there shouldn't be cross-server BGs remind me of retail idiots asking for more and more quality of life bullshit until finally the game basically plays itself like it does on current retail.
---
The community doesn't know what's good for them at all.  Listening to player feedback and giving them what they want is exactly what killed retail over time.  
---
#The one thing we should all be ok with is #nochanges.  And #nochanges means we have cross server battlegrounds and people just need to fucking get used to that.
---
Is uh.. is she single by chance?
---
My now wife raided MC with me back then and we'll probably raid MC again come classic. Or just chill out in 5 man content.
---
lmao this sub
---
If you like tanking I sugegst you go warrior, youc an do both.
---
They're both very good and fun dps it comes to what fantasy you like the most
---
No Whos on second.
---
this is such a good quality meme haha well done sir
---
I don't really get why people give a fuck about streamers at all?
---
Druids are VERY VERY hard to pin down if they are skilled. To quote my friend from classic: "that furry &lt;profanity&gt; IS COVERED WITH BUTTER OR SOMETHING"... I guess that's what you get when you send a fury warrior to try and kill a druid FC. (FAP potions are godtier)
---
Most of the times the FC (if it was a druid) could cross midfield quickly, and pass by their team if they had decent control within 45 seconds and be in their base. And once again if they were skilled at being a FC, they could do circles around their base indefinitely.
---
Throw in engineering toys, skull of impending doom, FAP potions, swiftness, etc etc. And the FC isn't exactly easy to burst.
---
Most of the battles DO rage in the midfield fighting for control and zerging each other. A full team wipe can happen quickly, which leads the FC to be in trouble quickly. 
---
Premades traditionally have 1 person on defense (rogue or hunter) to slow any incoming FC, as well as a number of people midfield, with FC running solo, or having 1 utility/healer with them (priest/paladin typically for dispels/bof) So most of the battles midfield will rage for a while, with respawners diving right for the fight, and CC is pretty rampant. Rogues and Mages are great for this role, and can mass control the battle to slow down pacing.
---
This is also not taking into account people who are salty and decide to 10-man turtle in their flag room with a geared prot warrior holding the flag... waiting for the enemy team to afk out.
---
Not much though because you see the character name, and can go check for that race/class/faction with that character on the armory.
---
Might not be armory right at the start of wow classic but u can bet there will be at some point.
---
Why do you think it only cost 10 gold to respec? Did you never play vanilla?
---
Rogue is certainly easier to master than warrior since there is just less things to master. Warrior is arguably more useful at 60.
---
Headphones? Look at this guy, he hasn't yet realized that the HDMI-out on his GTX is *begging* to be plugged into a 7.1 AVR with a sub and satellites. His lobes have never heard the pure eargasm of true surround, and the explosion of theater dynamics when the action begins.
---
He's one of the ones that still thinks "surround headphones" are real, and not marketing garbage.
---
You're aware Shadow Priest and Elemental Shaman are the real OOMers in 2019, right? Moonkin can sustain 5min+ at max rank. Which is literally every fight in Vanilla WoW outside of phase change mechanics.
---
Fanbois be crazy
---
It's 2019 the technology just isn't there yet. give it time. he should def be banned for server lag and damaging the blizzard composters
---
That is the reason according to dataminers I saw on twitter. Its not something they care a TON about but still enough to atleast force an effort out of poeple trynna get in
---
Last two severs I played capped it at 10, and got used to it
---
Trying to feed off the attention, or get their 5 seconds of fame.
---
I'm starting at Day 194. What's next?
---
&gt; Temple will be available on launch, and all quests and available items will be in their 1.12 state, meaning we will have the class quests available from the gate.
---
No, they specifically said that items added in later patches won't be appearing until the related phase.  These items will not be available at launch.
---
Just pretend the last day of summer is the release date. They have at least confirmed Summer 2019
---
Join the feral side, we have dancing bears!
---
I don't understand how that should even be possible. Are the servers really so bad or is it about all the effects or what.
---
I sure hope classic won't be having same kinda problems.
---
They can miss, be parried, or dodged. Special abilities often do those things and when they do on Gouge it means you're not getting a Backstab off. 
---
That also completely ignores the fact Gouge has a CD and can really only be used once or twice at a push per mob, Gouge is wasting energy (DPE/DPCT), Gouge is also wasting potential survival (Gouge &amp; Bandage). 
---
By all means play Dagger if that's what you want but it's definitely not the best/easiest way to go for sure.
---
If you do want to play a balance druio: Do it, you'll be able to raid. Probably not in a hardcore progression guild, but you'll definitely be able to find a casual guild that would be more than happy to have you so long as you put in the effort and show up. Will you see all the content? Maybe not, but you'll see enough of it to acquire enough purples to blow people up in PvP with some sick nasty wrath/starfire crits!
---
That's pretty redundant.
---
No raid queueing. Only groups of 5 can join and no 2 groups will be placed together. That way, you would always have 5-10 radoms on each side. Group would actually have to try to play a proper game.

Day 195.
---
Ranged DPS is the easiest. Melee DPS have a lot of positioning and running in/out to avoid AoE and Cleave mechanics.
---
Hunter, Mage or Warlock are all basically just standing still and hitting 3 keys the whole time.
---
I think he's right that its like that on some pservers but its not blizzlike
---
I leveled as resto because I didn't know you could respec.
---
*Wow Classic is out*
---
Are.. are you sure? I haven't seen the sun come up or go down. I haven't actually been outside in 24 hours
---
\+1 for Druid, it seems to check off your boxes (if disregarding your experiences in parenthesis):
---
* Druids can be Horde
---
* Druids can heal dungeons
---
* Druids *can* gank in world pvp, and are a stealth class which makes threat of being ganked much lower. At or close to level 60 they have reduced killing potential, but levels 20-50 Feral Druids do relatively impressive damage in conjunction with Druid's normal perks, which makes them powerhouses in world pvp while leveling
---
It's only an hour of grinding a day for not even 3 years. Easy.
---
Because you can't really avoid a stun, Bear form levels of armour is nice. The 3% crit on top is good too.
---
Esfand did the vid for Method. But if you didn't know Method is a succesful raiding guild for (I thinj) expansions that had world firsts in raids on hardest difficulty.

Forget mythic. I'll even take heroic.

Blizzard did a good job training players not to do much open world anymore. Heck everything is instanced these days. So why assign resources to anything other than the instanced areas.
---
Warrior or Rogue probably, there wasn't many particle effects weapons in classic from memory.
---
The quest is called "Blackfathom Villainy" its actually given by Argent Dawn NPC, Argent Guard Thaelrid, in the Dungeon itself. Plenty of guides on youtube that can show you exactly where he is.
---
If we don‚Äôt get a beta don‚Äôt expect any usable addons at release. If we get a beta then there will be usable addons for release. As it stands currently  there will be no usable addons for classic wow at release. If they release straight from alpha give it a week and there will be addons to use.
---
All we know: 
---
1. Classic will use whatever the current API is for their engine from now until the end of time. No 1.12 addons will work.
---
2. Which addons will be available will be tailored for the Vanilla flavor from what Blizz mentioned. We don't know the extent, all we know is that addons that automate WoW won't be allowed (obviously).
---
Warning: if you play druid, you won't ever be able to play another class. All classes are inferior to you once you play druid.
---
Is it sad I was thinking the same thing?
---
You pay for the game, then you pay monthly sub, then there is mtx on top of that. apparently million of players still playing and paying.
---
And this MMO game still can't handle more than two raids in 2019, apparently "there is no technology for that". If its not a sign of a massive degradation of a company and developers i don't know what. 
---
Multibillion company with the name.. jesus christ, they could have some of the best net engineers. Whole tech net department should be fired, and they need to hire ppl that can do their job. 
---
this is honestly beyond ridiculous, especially considering how expensive wow is (compared to free to play games on a market), and its not an fps game when you need high frequency of updates between the clien and the server to convey a proper poin to point aiming and shooting. its a fucking ontarget combat oldschool mmorpg system. and its still lags like that. even goddamn laggy assmade pubg didnt lag like that.
---
It honestly just blows my mind, they are a scam artists. Nothing more, nothing less. I don't care for their reasons and excuses at all. cloud technology blablabla. even Ion said that its unacceptable and that they fucked up.
---
I didn't do a player count, but I remember when the World Dragons got added and everyone was going after them you'd end up with at least a full raid from each faction trying to down the dragon while also fighting each other, and it was a huge lag fest.
---
im 24 now and not even close to having my own family. Y'all must have a tough life when u can only play 2 hours a day ;)
---
Lol I just wanted to post that I have that CD Killer cuts from core that came with killer instinct on the snes. I've probably listened to that cd 1000 times.
---
Lol glad you thought it was thoughtful, I was rushing my thoughts while at work and didn't get to check what I wrote :P
---
Yeah and to clarify, it's not that I thought wotlk was a *bad* game, it was just the shift toward a new WoW that I wasn't the target audience for any more. I honestly didn't stick around long enough to do raids like Ulduar. I only did the Trial of ...something one and VoA. I don't remember why I didn't try pve in wotlk more, but I think it was because previously in BC and vanilla, pve was a side thing for me and not the main attraction.
---
I LOVED kara in BC and SSC and TK...man they were so fun to progress in. I loved the new 5 piece tier items that you redeem tokens for. I don't remember how wotlk tokens worked, but I only remember not liking the multiple different versions of the same piece (10 man, 10 man heroic, 25 man, 25 man Heroic). Tokens were a good idea that worked well I thought. Especially how they worked in TBC with heroic dungeons. I loved farming heroics for badges and always feeling like I made progress even if I didnt get a piece IN the heroic.
---
But all that said, those were things to fill in the gaps while I wasn't PvP'ing. I went at arena hard in TBC, and was always in contested zones in vanilla helping people getting ganked. It was the reason I logged on. WotlK spread out the population so it wasn't as easy for me to spend my time helping people with pvp problems or start wars. 
---
Ah but its all fine, I'm getting classic now soon. Hopefully you can get an official wotlk server one day.
---
Retail is clown world

Mage can do most raids with 2 buttons and no real need to move or pay attention for that matter.

Liv Tyler, yummy :)
---
Some kind of personal ELO rating that is based almost exclusively on wins and losses works well enough for games like LoL, Overwatch, CS:GO etc. There are a lot of reasons this would be harder to implement for something like battlegrounds, but it would likely still be better than the alternative.
---
I meant that pfui was built for a 14 old version of the API. Getting it to work for 8.2 is so much work that you might as well start over from scratch
---
As for healers horde side: Shaman/Priest/Druid are the three you will be looking at. More in depth:
---
- Priest is the tank healer horde side. Always need a few.
---
- Shamans have totems you want in basically as many groups as you can get them.
---
- Druid as someone else said, 5 man tanks (even sometimes RAID tanks, I did it all the way up to and including naxx 40 was a good time, not tanking every fight mind you), heals, and druids are always in high demand due to B-Rez, and because of the complex nature of the class, not everyone will play it.
---
Highly recommended.
---
Good info thanks. So it's actually 3% extra hit for Trolls using bows, that's quite good considering a lot of hunters will spend their entire lives on a Rhok Delar.

Well they won't run if you don't change them
---
&gt; After launch they‚Äôll be mostly decorative anyway
---
it already is :(
---
Mage is probably a better farmer than the other two, and still get a raid spot to be perfectly honest. AOE grinding is a real thing in Classic, along with portals.
---
The biggest issue is when you quest in a race area that doesn't also have your class. Like a nelf druid in dun morogh is going to have to travel back to train.
---
Feral druid for the support spells or second rogue for the incredible ganking.
---
&gt; Rogues are a powerful class in pvp. They do have some weaknesses and  warriors definitely outshine them in many group group pvp situations,  but they're still pretty good and really the best in the game when it  comes to single target lock down. 
---
Agreed!
---
&gt; Warrior is fun with the numbers and sounds, but really a monkey can play  a warrior pretty well - Charge, MS, OP, WW.... you pretty much just hit  things on cooldown on a warrior, there's not a whole lot of thought  that goes into it.   
---
&gt; Rogue on the other hand requires a real strategy for every situation.  Using stealth, stuns, gouge, blind, blind, spint, vanish- there's tons  of strategy and planning that goes into your fighting. 
---
This is fundamentally, entirely wrong. You're completely missing the nuances of actually playing warrior versus playing rogues. If anything, rogues can much more easily "faceroll" so long as they have their slew of cooldowns up, because **Rogues can always pick their fights, Warriors don't have this luxury.** Stealth gives rogues the potential to have mobility and close the gap and initiate PvP fights without any fear of being CC'ed and kited to death in the mean time.
---
It's clear you've never played warrior in PvP, else you would know that if you just try to face roll with spamming CD's and expecting to magically win, you'd just get kited to oblivion by a hunter or a frost mage, while doing nothing to them in return. Because Warriors cannot pick their fights with the same ease as a rogue, they must always be careful of positioning; 
---
For example, a Warrior caught out just spamming all of his cooldowns while being stupid &amp; aggressive in mid-field of WSG is a dead Warrior, whereas a Rogue with all of his cooldowns up can absolutely murder whoever he wants dead, and then just vanish away once he starts taking heat.
---
I used to try to jump and time it with my weapon swing so I would be falling as my weapon would hit the mob because I thought it would increase my crit chance because the first time I jumped in combat I got a crit. Turns out it was coincidental but I wasted months trying to perfect this technique.
---
Here's how I look at the spec: it's fun if you approach it like bringing an old muscle car to a car show. Sure, you might be next to a brand new Ferrari that could smoke you on a race track -- just like a mage could smoke you on the DPS meters -- but you're still going to spiff up your toon to the max and show it off. And people of taste will appreciate and evaluate what you bring in its own context.
---
Echoing Engi. It is *THE* pvp profession. Many engi toys cannot be used in forms be warned, BUT something like rocket boots you can use then shift for hyper fast bear.
---
Just pointing out what many others have that it doesn't matter how you spec a paladin until prolly 40+ or so anyway.  And realsitically as long as you have a set of healing gear you're probably 90% as good a healer as a holy pally until 50+.
---
Even at 50+ you could spec hybrid and just a few points into holy can give you MOST of the goodies you need for 50+ dungeons while still retaining the ability to do nearly as much damage as ret while leveling.
---
It's only really at 60 where life starts to get a lot easier as a main healer in 5 mans if you spec deeper into holy, but you could still run a hybrid build that gives you seal of command (nb: holy shock is fucking useless in classic, and you COULD miss the 5% crit which gives you 6 extra points to put in ret etc...).
---
Sure a holy/prot build is what you really want but no one is gonna know if you keep SoC and a few ret damage talents that allow you to do some solo farming/xping/questing/whatever early on.
---
I agree with some of what you said, but vanilla is way more face roll. Look at vanilla mage or warlock, or really any class. Also sure the talent trees are less complex, but id argue they are way less cookie cutter than vanilla, each choice matters for different things, where in vanilla you basically had to pick the same things as everyone else and couldn't switch it around often.
---
And then she'll leave you and the kids for her guild leader who still lives with his mom.
---
mostly a leveling build thing but they get a similar thing to priests if they get a kill while draining soul.
---
Path of Diablo &amp; Dota 2
---
Diablo 3 once the new season hits - play it for a week or two then quit.
---
No you need a KB in classic m8.  In BC you didn't need a KB, but you always did in classic.  Even your own pet can stop it from proccing in classic if it gets the kb.
---
Go to a local tailor. Boycott Big Linen!
---
Yes there were lol
---
It doesn't only apply to hunters...... It's just only GOOD for hunters ü§£
---
You must have been bad or never actually seriously pvped to have never gotten past rank 9.
---
Speaking from a healer perspective - you are downranking a lot of your healing. Max rank heals are very expensive and usually are overkill unless your buddy is getting smashed by multiple people (for example like an FC), and even then, you will last more than 30 seconds.
---
If you are in a 1v1 situation, you will be kiting.... a lot... even casters you will be using SW:P (shadow word pain) on the target, using your wand, maybe mind blasting, while keeping yourself alive and trying to outlast the other person.
---
In group pvp senarios, you are positioning yourself in the back, hopefully near a friendly warlock/mage, as you WILL get jumped on quickly and WILL die if you don't have someone peel for you immediately. This is where communication is very important. If a rogue or warrior jumps on you, they need to be peeled immediately. Classic PVP is very bursty, and crushing clothies as melee is very easy.
---
I think he means chance on hits.
---
I‚Äôm probably going to level tailoring as I level, but at the same time I‚Äôm playing Paladin so I don‚Äôt really give two shits about first aid while leveling... for several classes the necessity of first aid really hinders being able to go tailoring. But as for your question about Elwynn, there‚Äôs plenty of linen cloth there. Defias, kobolds, gnolls all drop it.
---
But you also can't cast any sort of healing spell in Moonkin and would have to waste a GCD and some mana to switch in and out of the form to heal.
---
REQUEST FOR CHANGE HAS BEEN DETECTED!
---
COMMENCE THE "DOWNVOTE" PROTOCOL!
---
Warrior is more useful during leveling as well. Tanks are the biggest hold up in assembling a dungeon group
---
That is a fun idea! I‚Äôm sure people here will give you hate about No Changes. But it‚Äôs fun to think about regardless!
---
Or not.
---
You're demanding that people play your way, how are you not being selfish?
---
Priests DO hold more utility in pvp (BG's or OWPvP where it's groups on groups) due to dispels, and fear.
---
With that said Shamans really shrine in PVE healing, due to totems.
---
Leveling isn't terrible without some kind of travel utility at 30, you probably won't have your first mount until 40 if you are REALLY lucky, or potentially mid 40's.
---
Shamans as enhancement can be pretty brainless to level truth be told.
---
I'll run everything that gives me decent gear or has good quest rewards.
---
Not much point running things like SFK or WC as alliance really as they are far too hard to get to and have no quests (well SFK has pally and warlock class quests but still, most paladins will just 5paladin man it up till the horses and leave the rest of the dungeon alone.
---
Not demanding anything, saying other people should be prepared to get left behind if they‚Äôre selfish

I abandoned a 50 something druid because I lost a duel to my brother, a 30 something paladin. Never played the character again and rerolled horde on another server. I feel ya.

Thank you for the feedback. I have been noticing stability issues with the hosting solution I am using. I believe this to be the source of the non-reply issue. As for commands not working, since this bot is still in ‚Äúbeta‚Äù I‚Äôm trying my best to make it as good as possible but some things slip by.
---
!talent is not a valid command, so in some respect it‚Äôs working :)

I am trying to overhaul the whole search architecture in order to make it more reliable. Hopefully these experiences have not turned you off of helping me make this bot the best it can be.
---
Thank you for your message.
---
I followed a high level hunter around begging him to give me a buff so I could do more damage when questing!
---
Found the Balance Druid. 
---
Also, neither the Priest or Shaman are brought to raids to DPS.
---
Dont remind me either, I'll be 40 in a few years, shiet...
---
arguably VC is worth if you're a warrior for the 2hander which is basically significant BiS for like 10 levels.  However it's probably not worth the excursion and time taken - plus prolly basically no one who isn't a 2hander user is gonna wanna bother.
---
Also that dungeon is kinda aidsey in vanilla honestly.  Hoping classic doesn't let you floor pull gobbos n stuff.  Also wondering if the gobbos insta spawning their pets will be a thing or if that's a pserver thing, can't really remember real vanilla for that one.
---
yeah but mages are a lot different, if you dont spam your abilities youll lose dps, but because hunters work with auto shot timing and there are plenty of openings for zerking to be considered efficient.
---
A bigger health bar can be the difference between a corpse run and moving onto the next mobs.
---
I'll have to try out the CPU/GPU tests! It's an Acer, so I'm not 100% confident on the cooling system. A little slim, but it's got aluminum surfaces on the back of the monitor and around the keyboard. Pretty good size fan on the back end, and some vents underneath (not impressed by those).  
---
If I do run into issues, do those USB powered lap-fan things you can put under your computer actually work?  
---
Side note: I'm finding way too many oddities with Windows 10 - like even something as simply as the predictive text boxes popping up - are more annoying than helpful to me. (I'm turning off soooo many "features" it's ridiculous).
---
Yeah even as alliance Stockades is just a quest run, no one runs it more than once because you just wanna do all the quests as no good gear drops in there at all.
---
This only only happened very early on but was patched.
---
It then happened again in 2.0 patch shortly before TBC launch since both factions were granted Shaman/Paladin.
---
Yeah mate. Trying to find my pre-bis I've found that the extra 3% is really good (planning on making a dwarf) but not as good as it would be because a lot of the best items have hit on them. Since you only need 8.6% to 9% hit it means that you can overcap on hit fairly easily assuming you are dedicated enough to farm all of the best gear. This isn't great because the items aren't balanced to be exactly equivalent to eachother (1 hit is x agility, etc.). There is also the problem that faster weapons tend to cause your aimed shot to clip your autos which is a direct loss of dps. The best weapons tend to be crossbows for this reason.

Generally your level 10 class quest will only be available in your race‚Äôs starting area. That‚Äôs the main thing

Patch 1.12 added cross realm battlegrounds in Vanilla.

If you are a pvper, engineering is you go-to.

Oh for sure, tossup between warrior and rogue, I would give favor to warrior. There are a ton of .... interesting .... weapon on hit effects that warriors get.
---
I believe I jumped the gun with implementing multiple commands before ensuring the initial command works flawlessly. The !ability command has been nothing but a pain because I rushed it out.
---
I am overhauling the search architecture and making sure that !item works 100% before adding !ability back in.
---
As I have also mentioned in another reply, there are some stability issues with my hosting solution and I want to iron those out to hopefully help with responsiveness as well.
---
Thank you so much for the feedback. Please continue to test and provide feedback. The github attached to my bot will be able to provide a more direct line of communication to me and provide better transparency of bugs, features, and other development.
---
On retail there is Rated Battlegrounds, but the rating system is pretty prone to abuse (unfortunately). With win trading, and elo boosting.
---
All of this is true. I had to laugh at the"kids" in my buddy's discord, they were taking about classic and how it's going to be so much easier than retail currently is. They are under the impression that leveling will be the same as the current difficulty of mobs.
---
I'm not so sure they will. As long as this new Quest Chain is in the spirit of Classic and adds a little flavour and story (and isn't lore destructive) then I think the vast majority would see it as a nice little Easter Egg. I'd certainly like to hope so anyway.
---
Problem is no one wants to run SFK because there are no quests for alliance in there except warlock and pally class quests.  So good luck finding a group when hardly anyone wants to run it and it's super far away (have to do a big run from wetlands -&gt; arathi -&gt; southshore to get the FP, and it's still a long run from southshore too.
---
These are honestly the dungeons im only prolly gonna do if ppl are like 'LFM CAN SUMMON' :)
---
There should be casual guilds this time around as well, and they might be okay with having a ret paladin in their ranks. Filling out a full 40 man raid is difficult, so if you're reliable and patient and give out the necessary buffs to your raid, you should usually have a spot, but gear is probably going to other classes first.
---
Ret paladins need weird gear, and so the rare, poorly itemized stuff that might have a smattering of random stats tends to be pretty good for Ret paladins. Ret paladins can actually make use of the bits of gear that might have strength &amp; +dmg/healing!
---
Bear in mind, you're never going to pull DPS that's anywhere near what a similarly geared and reasonably skilled actual DPS might bring, and if you actually want to make this (rather mediocre) DPS, you'll need to farm consumables like Dark Runes, potions, flasks, dragon breath chili &amp; more for a long time before each raid. Chances are, you're giong to skimp on your consumables - in which case, you probably don't deserve the gear: a 2H DPS warrior (not ideal, but exists) would likely get 2-3x more mileage from a solid 2H weapon drop than you would, and a raid would be a bit silly to allow you to get priority on this gear.
---
**TL;DR:** 14 years have passed but the community has a lot of data from pservers (&amp; vanilla experience) to say that Ret Paladins still are the #1 or #2 worst DPS class&amp;spec in the game, but do bring some utility to the table that's reasonable (buffs, bubbles, blessings) and might find a spot in a raid that's either short on people or short on paladins. You probably won't get the gear you want because... well, you don't deserve it (other classes usually can make a lot more DPS out of it), but a bit of silver lining is that you can absorb poorly-itemized gear &amp; get some mileage out of it (Ret Paladins benefit from both melee stats like strength &amp; agil while also benefiting from  +dmg &amp; int somewhat)
---
I mean who cares. If you want to, just do it. If your fun of exploring and traveling is prevented because in about 2-3 days played you will need to cough up an extra 20g then maybe mmos arent for you.
---
min/max, "enjoy" the world, whatever, it all has drawbacks and rewards, the most important thing is you have fun doing it. If the Wetlands run is fun for you, do it.

Bring it into modmail.
---
I am currently working on a search architecture overhaul and in doing so will hopefully address the partial search request that I‚Äôve been seeing so much of :P
---
Thanks again for the feedback.
---
I definitely meant chance on hits, particle effects are cool, but I want the Ironfoe type weapons.
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Maybe I should write one.
---
Basic idea is you kill with dots wand and imp for early levels. Optionally switch to vw at 10. Shadowbolt is very Mana inefficient so shouldn't be used except in special cases. Either level as pure affliction or a little demo plus affliction.
---
Always be regening - if you are at Max HP and less than Max Mana, lifetap.
---
To me that's just a "hopeful" prep time. Until a physical date is given, it's all just "we hope" in my eyes. Pretending Sept 23rd is the release date does nothing for me until they come out and say YES WE WILL RELEASE CLASSIC ON SEPTEMBER 23RD. While I would like it to be sooner, just knowing for CERTAIN that it is being released on a specific date is promising. I play a lot of Oldschool Runescape and I remember promises of Winter 2017 as a release date for Mobile, came out October 2018
---
Interesting is good! They don't need to be BiS for me to enjoy their uniqueness.
---
True, it's more of a if you're already in it kinda thing. I wouldn't switch in and out if you're already kiting or know you will be.
---
Both, 5 accounts on the horde (multiboxing) and 1 account on the alliance to spy and do some tricks with the AH.
---
Definitely don't have to. Maybe more efficient, but not a must
---
Kang the decapitator comes to mind....
---
Thanks for the input
---
3 buttons is making is sound hard. It's more like 2. Or if you are a mage.... 1.
---
Nice! I only started in Wrath so I didn't even know about this item.
---
I did this as a frost mage during the Cata pre-patch. The imbalance was glorious.  Everyone else should've simply quit until release.
---
This is actually the better choice I believe
---
sounds like Jim is paying for a game that doesnt exist.
---
You're gonna have some issues if you think vanilla is more face roll than what wow currently is.

Classic WoW by day, Countdown to Classic podcast by night. All day!

You need a nightfall shaman to be honest, also known as the "AFK BOT". They literally just tunnel the boss with autoattacks.

Well the screenshot is right there so..

u don't really gain weigh by sitting around all day, its what you eat and how much
---
I don't think any caster weapons had SP pre-raid that weren't "OF THE X"
---
What if they put in an extra quest to get 10 bear asses somewhere, and then literally nothing else.
---
People would tear apart every word of that quest to find out what it‚Äôs for or why it‚Äôs there, when it‚Äôs just to mess with the turbo nerds.

Not tying to be a dick but did you even try looking? Took me 10 seconds to find this.

I saw ‚ÄúSo you want to be a scarab lord‚Äù I believe by Platinum WoW and as soon as soon as it started to gain traction all the big channels starting making the same video. I wish these ‚Äúcontent‚Äù creators would get called out for leeching ideas.
---
\+1 for Druids! Druids are now known to not only be dungeon-viable but also raid-viable tanks, can pull respectable DPS (if you put in the time &amp; effort), can obviously heal both dungeons &amp; raids just fine... all while bringing unique &amp; irreplaceable utility like brez + innervate :) 
---
Highly recommended!
---
We know [their team has their own alpha/beta going on](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bf8d7q/blue_posted_its_an_employee_alpha/) so it's likely just updates to that. We'll know for sure if they announce a beta for the players so it's not worth getting all excited for every little update they make to that.
---
Just thought I‚Äôd ask here first
---
But did you down the boss on that attempt? If so, WORTH!
---
Me and my group of 4 years who are leveling together are all traveling to elwyn forest so we can do westfall and hit up deadmines quest line
---
I did something really close - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/A4fAwAAEzDa9zQ I had imp thorns as our DPS were a bit... overzealous at times. And a bit of damage to thorns, our tanks enjoyed.

RDruid is fine for dungeons had no issues in 5-mans unless people were dumb, then they got to do the "WALK OF SHAME".

There's a ton of very strong on-hit effects that are a ton of fun!

Actually Luna is a backported version of Shadowed Unit Frames for Wotlk. Details I know, but still.
---
I laughed so hard when I read this!
---
You keep saying the phrase "wasting 39 other people's time" which is conjecture at best and rarely ever the case. 
---
You're claiming that having one shadow priest healing in raid will ruin the entire raid and everyone will wipe and die and MC will take 4 hours which is the silliest shit I've ever heard. If this is happening don't blame the off-spec healer, blame those 39 other people who obviously FUCKING SUCK. You could 30 man MC in less time in blues. 
---
My guild had a shadow priest and a ret pally back in vanilla who would sometimes heal and sometimes dps. We managed to down twin emps and 3 bosses in Naxx. Weird huh.
---
Once you go druid, you will NEVER be able to play another class.
---
(Yes no out of combat rez but SCREW THAT! I rez people DURING BOSSFIGHTS!)
---
I was patchwerk tank... my bear face STILL hurts from that fat sack of rotten meat pounding my face in.
---
What I'd like them to do is mess with the locations and turn ins for most quests. So that old guides and addons are of no use for Classic.
---
What could be more vanilla than a hundred people shouting in Barrens chat that they can't fine Mankrik's wife?
---
Not me saying this. I am saying almost exactly what you are saying. The other guy is saying this.
---
Best /dance in the game.

Mulgore is one of my favorite starting zones

This Is amazing

Macro your pull dot to pet attack.  Dot second, dot third, wand
---
Repeat
---
When corruption is instant (3/5 bc of global) pull with agony, then corruption, then wand to death.  Before that, immo/corruption/agony
---
You should 100% get imp vw and you can grind the elites in wc before the instance.  I farmed 20-26 there in very few hours
---
I am taking 3 weeks off work, probably will be sleeping 3-4 hours a night for the first week. And I am going to enjoy EVERY GOD DAMN SECOND OF IT.

Even mages have to hit 3 buttons.

 2. Conjure Water

 3. Conjure Food

---
Imagine not knowing how to look up old raid videos on youtube.
---
That was beautiful.
---
It has super high spirit and is thus a great evocation weapon
---
LOL everyone is so gullible. How do we know this isn't a private server or just an image someone made?
---
I saw that I replied to the wrong comment, I corrected it.
---
And here in lies the problem with people who either never played Vanilla or have been scratching Pservers. 
---
It's hilarious at this point
---
A good mage brings 30-40 stacks of water to raid. And 20 stacks of food.
---
In my experience daggers were faster.  Plus, in the off chance you got into a dungeon, there was no competition on them like there was on swords and maces.
---
I'm almost positive I leveled 30/0/21 back in 1.12.  It was all about chaining remorseless ambushes.  You had basically 100% crit chance in that window.  (45% from imp ambush, 40% from remorseless, 5% from malice, and 5% base).
---
Ambush did the most damage of openers and with Seal Fate and initiative usually it was 3 CPS, which made getting to 5 cps quick for an eviscerate.  (Usually gouge, backstab, eviscerate).
---
I leveled my rogue wanting to go Hemo but as far as leveling and farming went, nothing compared to the seal fate remorseless ambush.
---
I'm really skeptical that blade flurry combat could be faster because it relied on the cooldown and double pulling, which meant much more downtime.  
---
Remoseless + Ambush is just way too efficient.  It's one mob at a time but anything that isn't elite is deleted instantly.
---
You are acting like a child grow up, let people play what they want
---
Thats what i was thinking too. Druid wouldnt be caught by anyone.
---
Try asking google it‚Äôs this thing called a search engine, pretty handy.
---
Teach me your ways
---
Maybe they crave the spotlight or maybe it‚Äôs for self validation.
---
I can watch Madseason and that himuredex guy. Their content is the most interesting to me.
---
They can also take the tram to stormwind, and just go back at level 10 for the class quest. (Or better yet, wait till 14 so they can get the teleport:moonglaxe ability too).
---
Discount is based on reputation but the Night Elf area is gorgeous and I'd definitely stick there to level if I rolled a Night Elf.
---
The only thing that will prevent queue dodging is a culture among pvpers that they are primarily there to pvp vs one another, not out farm the other premades of their faction.
---
Dodging wasnt cancerous back in the day, because most premades got together to win, not necessarily to rank. 
---
Hitting the best Alliance guilds premade was the highlight match of the day. In a sea of 7-9 minute games youd have 3-5 really good back and forth long ones--thats why my server played. R10, R13 gear, GM/HWL? Those were the benefits of pvping, not the reason for.
---
"Hey guys, Tips here..."
---
What the heck
---
Shaman cause chain heal friggin rox
---
You probably have to because there generally isn't enough quests in one zone alone. You can do 1-10 in Teldrassil but you can't get to 20 in only Darkshore or only Westfall. You have to do both or even all three with Loch Modan. Same with Ashenvale.
---
It's a joke, I know mages do not conjure consumables during a fight.
---
My guild's warlock bailed as soon as he got Staff of Atiesh for &lt;vodka&gt;, never forgave that guy.
---
I never played vanilla. Joined in the TBC. I missed it. Where were they?
---
We're having a lot of fun with it! It hasn't turned us off, and hopefully my comment didn't come off as negative - I just want to help report some of our findings to help make it be the best version it can possibly be.
---
Looking forward with what's to come, thank you for your hard work and have a great day!
---
The robot chicken escort quests, woof.
---
Really? I played WC3. Maybe 15 years ago now though?  I missed it. Where were they?
---
&gt; Obviously I wish I could go back to the early wow days when I was truly happy!
---

---
Is this a thread to just shit on youtubers?
---
Feel how you want about them, I think they leave much to be desired myself, but this is a low quality shitpost if I've ever seen one.
---
To all those thinking of rolling a druid... JUST DO IT.
---
As a druid you can look forward to: 
---
- Bearform at level 10 (have fun killing the owlbeast, he's a jerk who steals your lunch money)
---
- Aquatic form at 16 (protip: save this for when you have travel form at 30, it's a TON of running around no matter which faction you are)
---
- Cat form at 20, become a rogue with 30% faster movement speed! (with talents)
---
- Travel form at 30, zoom zoom 40% movement speed
---
As well as: polymorph immune in forms, break polymorph on shapeshift, can shapeshift out of roots/snares, rezzing your friend in combat, as well as dancing on mailboxes in bearform.
---
As for Moonglade, what happens in the Moonglade, stays in the Moonglade. (And yes you have a teleport there which you keep forever)
---
I'm a teacher... no need to neglect anything or anyone unless I go full nolife mode.
---
Oh I'm 100% on the side of people playing everything and anything. I'm just not on the side of Private Server know it alls who spill shite out into the community in an often toxic manner.
---
This dude is living in 3019
---
Absolutely, I thought you meant on their bar in general haha
---
memeology 101
---
That would work for maybe a day and then the addon will just update.
---
We know that the build they had at Blizzcon was already an old build by the time blizzcon came out, that was the explanation for some of the more obvious silly bugs like health regen values.    
---
Given that alpha testing has been in full swing for at least 6 months, probably more like 12. The recent upload to the CDN isn't a 'sign that alpha started', it's a sign that the alpha is being rolled out onto the public delivery server so that aspect of it can be tested, ie what you do just before you roll out a beta the public needs to access.
---
They weren't loved by their parents so they seek our approval instead.
---
Most of your damage is frontloaded if you use a dagger.  Remoseless + improved ambush = guaranteed crit and with initiative and seal fate it = 3 cp's most often.  
---
Your right that backstab isn't super reliable for leveling / farming.  But you just need 2 cp's after that initial burst for a 5p Evisc.
---
 Hey guys, happy to post it here in the comments, but we have data for 10 days /played as well. We just thought it was some fun data to share. Time to max level at 10 days /played Summary If you play 10 hours per week it will take you 5.5 months to reach level 60 If you play 20 hours per week it will take you 2.8 months to reach level 60 If you play 40 hours per week it will take you 1.4 months to reach level 60
---
I don‚Äôt think any opinion that you don‚Äôt share should be considered toxic or know it all
---
I think you'll get a spot no worries. It's hard enough to get 40 people together let alone being choosy about specs. You're also a pally which is great for utility.
---
I don't recall ever doing a pug that wasn't /roll so I imagine you'll have the same chance for gear as anyone else.
---
Nightmares Asylum was up there too. They did a really great job with raid video content back when no one was really putting any effort into editing.
---
Faster move speed while stealthed and stronger stealth makes a big difference.
---
Queue times were already pretty long. Then again I played on a server that was 80% alliance. I remember waiting 2-3 hours for queue to pop. Play one match and log out for the night.
---
I'll take 5
---
It's not an opinion when it's forced down people's throats an opinion has openings for disagreement and discussion. What's happened in the above is disgusting quite frankly and reeks of retail wow forums.
---
How sad.
---
&gt;If I do run into issues, do those USB powered lap-fan things you can put under your computer actually work? 
---
They help with air circulation around the laptop but they won't bring any more air into the laptop itself, and if they create turbulence they'll even reduce the air intake (no air for the laptop to suck in.)
---
I'd sooner buy a pipe and fan to suck air from the outside and deliver it underneath the laptop. That would work wonders, as the air would be cool. :P

Shaman or hunter has been so difficult to choose between. I mained a shaman in vanilla but never stepped into a raid, it would be an absolute nostalgia blast to go back and relevel. Hunter has always been my second love and my alt, I just love kiting.
---
My issue is that shaman seems really fun and at end game I love the idea of spamming chain heal in raids. However I love ele and I don't think I'll play enough to keep up with the gold costs of respeccing between talent builds.
---
Hunter seems like such a fun choice because of the ease of levelling, the farming you can do, the kiting, the general open world fun you can have.
---
Basically, for someone that wants to enjoy a bit of all the content without being hardcore at any of it, what's the best choice? I love battlegrounds, ganking, occasionally raiding and just fucking about in the world itself.
---
Personally, after WoTLK the storytelling really took a nosedive. Now it seems they just rehash past glories to try and keep people playing. Also why play WoW as a single player action game?There are tons of superior single player RPGs such as The Witcher Series, Dark Souls, Kingdom Come Deliverance, so on and so forth. These games are superior in every way in terms of story and combat. 
---
Not saying Raids and PvP are necessary, but to me MMO's have always been about the player interaction, not the story.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-warlock-pve-dps

Do whatever you think looks cooler. Hit the wowhead classic dressing room and go nuts. Orc is better for racials but do what you enjoy.
---
Play a tank and start making dungeon groups around midnight EST.
---
I used to be the guy who would constantly eat while playing but if recent times are anything to go off, I'll spend the entire day doing a few dungeon runs and not realise.
---
Hey don‚Äôt feel bad, boomkin players. As a mage, Moonkin Aura IS that good. Moonkin Aura + Curse of Elements + Nightfall Proc + cooldowns makes me feel like a god.
---
Go fuck your self
---
I‚Äôm kind of in the same boat. You going warrior or rogue?
---
Deep Ocean, Vast Sea.
---
NEVER.
---
Not at all compared to all the damage increases. And if you‚Äôre duoing you‚Äôll barely be in stealth.
---
Ive leveled 2 characters through 1-60 on alliance prior to the BC leveling nerf, and another 3 on Horde. Since then I've leveled at least 3 of each on private servers. 
---
I found a quest I'd never done before two playthroughs ago. And prior to that, I was with an Alliance friend who showed me 3 quests I had no idea about on my last alliance run. 
---
Im pretty sure Ive seen mostly all of them now, though (except scarab lord)
---
Smashing that sub button omg
---
Can you give me some examples. For raiding it easily is more faceroll. Sure levelling you need to worry about more stuff, but in raids besides mana management most classes spam 1 button.
---
funny meme
---
...but i'm definitely not gonna stop going to the gym
---
No wife no problem.
---
Low effort but really good.
---
All this talk and organisation months out from game release counts for very little. If I was trying to start a guild that wants to raid 4 weeks into Classic now, I'd try and hit 300 people at least that say they will.    
---
Because you can be sure 100 of the 300 never even get to level 10 staying on the server/faction/guild they said they would.  
---
And another 100 will decide they do like staying married and keeping a job and playing basketball on thursday night and will take 6 months to get to 60.    
---
And then of the 100 left over that actually get to 60 in your guild, you'd be doing very well if 40 of them actually regularly come to raids. That's before you even worry about whether those 40 players are any decent at the game at all.
---
Yeah, I guess it does stop anyone from just downloading a single file and having it handed to them on a platter.
---
I always wanted to see what was behind the green portal in Stratholme.  Was it supposed to be the Naxx portal?  I seem to remember there was another near Hyjal and one in Caverns of Time back then too.
---
Raiding BRD, Strath and SCholo are still some of my favourite memories of WoW.
---
Step 1. Play World of Warcraft.                 
---
                
---
Step 2. Treat your loved ones like they come second.               
---
            
---
Step 3. Avoid interacting with others and when you do, complain.                
---
             
---
Step 4. Convince yourself you dont do Steps 2 and 3 and ignore it by doing Step 1.

Your ready when no ones left around to tell you your not.

In Sweden we used Ventrilo

Loved it

I don't even think rogue is a better leveler than shaman to be honest, it's usually Shaman &gt; Rogue &gt; Warrior as the bottom three.

People don‚Äôt usually upvote discussion threads. I make a couple each week, and sometimes they get 200-300 upvotes, but really most of the time, they hover between 10-30, even when they have 50-200 comments. 
---
That‚Äôs kind of the issue with memes vs self posts. You see a meme, laugh and upvote, maybe skim comments, and move on. Discussion threads ask somebody to read a paragraph or a wall of text, comment on it, and continue discussing. With all that, people don‚Äôt normally upvote the thread since they‚Äôre actually too busy reading or replying.
---
The anti-druid crowd is out downvoting pro-druid posts again, sorry you're being downvoted.
---
I though onyxia in phase2 could only take damage from dots
---
I see a lot of hate against streamers here, why is this? The only streams I watch is tournaments and that's exceedingly rare, so I'm not really familiar with how it works.
---
What if they just made it so that you couldn't see the names of enemy players in the battle ground until you actually were close enough to see them,  it just said like "Member of the Alliance"   Then you wouldn't be able to scout.  Then combine that a rather long de buff if you bail from a game.  And maybe randomize all the numbers of battlegrounds so even though it says " would you like to enter Warsong gulch 3,  you actually have no idea what number it is".  
---
I mean Im honestly fine with cross realm BG's as well.  at this point I'm just sick of solo queuing only to get stomped on by a premade that dodged.  Been playing private servers since cataclysm but the BG scene is pretty much unplayable due to the rampant premade dodging. It just fosters a community where no one pvps except for premade groups.

Leather pants for rogue. Next upgrade is a LW legs that require level 50 or UBRS.
---
I want to raid semi-hardcore, do some world pvp and casual battlegrounds. I am torn between mage and rogue, rogue seems like the most fun in  world pvp but mages seem A LOT stronger in battlegrounds.
---
Also rogues seem like the would get stomped by a lot of classes while mages have a fair shot against anyone? Especially with the huge amount of warriors in battlegrounds. Thoughts on this everyone?
---
Can I achieve oomkin mode natty?
---
How much is the one you're looking at
---
You're not going to use discord or vent with random party. WoW voice chat has a chance in that situation. Latest voice chat is actually quite good. I used it for my friend M+ party and it generally works just fine (quality is awesome, one guy sometimes was dropping, but I think it was fixed for some time).
---
Good chances to run dungeons as a prot pala.  People aren't nearly as picky about tanks in dungeons.
---
However, it depends on how popular warriors are.  It's no secret that warriors were probably the strongest class overall in 1.12.  If there's a glut of warriors it may change how it feels.
---
Except that it's fun and has some nice blues (that ring is nuts for a while).
---
I've got some bad news.
---
They implemented new voice in BfA and it's good. Discrod is better, I guess, but WoW voice is integrated into game, so it's infinitely more accessible for PuG groups, it's literally one click away.
---
"because during summer it is perpetually hot in the rooms I play in" Thermals may be an issue for you then. It's basically components all crammed together. So they would all end up thermal throttling and slowing everything down.

---
Honestly, I think classic wow will help me lose weight. When I'm on the computer all day, I eat way less.
---
I think it would be better to be able to ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of sharding. So, you click a button, and your toon gets grouped with everybody else who opted out. On one hand, you‚Äôre still in a shard, technically, because you‚Äôre separated from the large chunk of people who don‚Äôt opt out. On the other, the people around you will stay around you. You won‚Äôt get bounced to other phases at random times, sometimes life threatening times. 
---
So it still would be a shard, but there‚Äôs a level of permanence. You can likely see that rogue dude you saw at level 3, when you‚Äôre killing Hogger, instead of a likely re-grouped cluster you would be interacting with in otherwise.
---
Yea, this. When I'm in gaming mode, I'm too fixated to care about food. Just get a gallon jug of water and a shit pan and I'm good to go.
---
No it can't LOL
---
&gt;ok i need to get to this place so i can get a sweet polearm its called Shadowstrike acctaully its 2 weopons cause it can turn into Thunderstrike its an epic polearm
---
I‚Äôm going to play either a priest or pally, and I think I‚Äôll make a dwarf either way.
---
I‚Äôve leveled a few humans before but no dwarves. I‚Äôm tempted to take the tram to Stormwind and level in Elwynn again for the first few levels. Then again, it might be nice to try something different. Is Dun Morough as fun as Elwynn? How do they compare?
---
I just resubscribed. Not interested in other games, taking a break from competitive esports, wanted something to do to relax after work. Enjoying it found a great guild to be apart of thats active, and then met some others on a different server who rbg on the weekend and had a ton of fun with them. I'm not saying the game is in its best state, but it can be enjoyable if you have a goal in mind and work towards that goal without being worn out.
---
I kinda miss the fact that information spread so slowly, even back in 2005. WoW came out before YouTube. Knowledge creep was extremely slow, which contributed to the sense of wonder that vanilla had. Shame there won't ever be a game like that again.
---
Omg. The comment about Vendorstrike... and the comments about how there will never be expansions, or level cap increases.
---
Oh those sweet, sweet naive children.
---
July 16th would be perfection, please don't make me wait until August, university starts again late august!
---
They're expensive little units once you factor in buying your own SSD/RAM, but purely performance wise it'll be completely fine at 1080p. They're in between a 1050ti and 1060, close to one or the other depending on the game.  
---
They would run Legion at 60fps fine so Classic will be no issue at all, as long as you're not worried about anything fancy like 144hz or 4k.
---
For that price I'd just buy a laptop
---
I hope ElvUI and the healing addon I forgot what it's called port there's to Classic
---
On pservers Alliance have instant queue times.
---
Not really a Balance Druid, but I am the author of the most indepth TC of the spec. This is why I can confidently make such a claim. But yes, you're right. Shadow Priests and Elemental Shamans (and Balance Druids) have zero place in a raid.
---
Hunter is a more reliable and effective Nightfall bot than Shaman.
---
You can be sure? You can't be sure of anything, maybe statistically on a Private Server most people don't play for very long. They also ain't paying for the pleasure.
---
These numbers are again pulled out of thin air. There is no reason that a guild can't be formed outside of the game and be as successful. Method are doing just that, but next you'll say that they are exception to your made up rule that 100 people will not make it past 10 etc etc etc.
---
Played both:
---
Priest most fun: easy to find groups if you heal.  Easier to chain farm than you might expect.
---
Priest most annoying:  pretty much always have to heal in group content.  Their dps was not good in PvE and the utility they brought was not justified by the slot (unless you had like 8 warlocks, which no one did).
---
Warlock most fun:  can solo anything extremely easily.  Very strong class out in the world.
---
Warlock most annoying:  it's a toss up for me.  Soul shard management.  Competing for Slots in groups as a dps.  And also the debuff limit basically forcing you into shadowbolt spam in raids.
---
Broken link.
---
I‚Äôm liking this format
---
I would, but I already have a keyboard, mouse, Monitor etc.. That are all really good.

I‚Äôd be okay with a GLOBAL lfg channel.

Got the best laugh from this.

---
Girlfriend also games and knows how to be interdependent. Also we don't have kids so that helps.
---
In my experience, completely dependent on where you go, most likely you will have different speed packages that you pay monthly for, the decent ones are spendy tho.
---
Sincerely, someone coming home in August hoping for an August-September release lol
---
Buying a laptop doesn't mean you can't use those, I would assume you already have a desktop if you already have all that stuff so it really doesn't make sense (at least to me) to just buy a second smaller "desktop" when you could just buy a laptop then you would just have both.  You can use external keyboards/mice/monitors with a laptop if you really cared about them.  
---
for $1600 you could get a pretty beefy laptop that would be a lot better specs than what you're looking at now.
---
just my 2 cents though
---
Do you already have a good gaming comp? My air conditioner was only $300 if you're worried about the heat
---
I consider Dun Morogh to be the best alliance starting zone for efficiency. Elwynn has a lot of running around just for 1 quest.
---
I‚Äôll be doing all, alliance side so like others skipping WC/RFC. I‚Äôve never done a full uldaman or Mara, even whilst levelling through multiple pservers
---
You sound like someone who says "cuck" too much.
---
Doesnt matter all that much. They go by comparatively fast. And any gear you get doesnt really matter. 
---
The biggest thing that'll affect which of these zones is better is probably population. I expect elwynn to be (more) packed especially early on.
---
I personally like dun morogh a lot because the quests are very hub-based akin to modern wow, where you can do a shitload of quests and turn them all in at the same spot. Plus troggs are easier to pull 1 at a time than kobolds and defias
---
What ‚Äúnew‚Äù thing do you expect to be on a sub for a 29 year old game?
---
What a journey of a gif
---
What is this from (not Princess, obviously)?
---
I started in wrath, I love druid, am I wasting my time leveling one to 60 in classic? Should I focus on other classes first like mage/lock/warrior and maybe just play druid for fun? Enlighten me pls
---
This or a few new Easter Eggs could be fun.
---
Priest most fun thing: with 30 minute buff and rez, people in the open world love you. Youre like a travelling hero. 
---
Most annoying thing: levelling is *smooth* but its not fast or interesting. Its wanding from 10 to 45, more or less, and then shadowform wanding. Its not like its hard, but its definitely mind numbing at times.
---
As far as I'm aware sharding is only a "Launch and shortly after launch" mechanism to prevent server crashes and people from not being able to progress due to lack of mobs.
---
&gt;t also has a 7day (approx) cooldown time, since the instance literally takes days to complete. so basically, once you enter the instance, it doesnt refresh until 7 days later.
---
I love that. I mean, for a short while, some guilds won‚Äôt be doing 1-day clears of Mc. It‚Äôs  just adorable that it was expected to take ‚Äúdays‚Äù. I mean, I do hope it takes days this time around too.
---
**silently re-adjusts glasses with index finger**
---
Yeah, this advice is way too honest, lmao.
---
I found the lore of this thicc lady so funny.
---
And I also believe it was said it‚Äôs only for the 1-10 zones.
---
Still gonna' play a (B)OOMkin. Bite my furry, feathered ass.
---
Hmmmm... I thought that's what they were supposed to do - might be able to make something like that fairly easily. Heck, could even put a low-power cooling system into it to pipe refrigerated air into the intake vents. Doesn't seem like it would be too hard to do, and wouldn't use too much power either. Maybe my engineer buddies could come up with something
---
Yep. If it‚Äôs just the 1-10 zones, this idea would really be heavy handed and unnecessary. But I worry that later zones might be sharded also. People will still struggle *a lot* with getting mobs and quest targets in the later zones. And if they decide to drop the shard hammer for zones past the 1-10s, an option like this would be a godsend for me.
---
What class would you recommend for duoing with a prot warrior?
---
Came here for this exact quote.  Literal gold.
---
Maybe consider building a small form factor pc (/r/SFFPC). Will probably result in a better value proposition (price:performance) on top of just being an overall better experience.
---
Wittgenstein is a random person who didn't know any more than us. Huh. You seem really thoughtful
---
Any healer. Shaman or paladin.
---
In terms of ez from my experience druid for sure, i played most of the roles and classes. 
---
Noone expects you to top hps meters, you can pretty much do whatever and not tryhard, it doesnt matter what you do really. you heal here and there, but everyone knows its on other healers do heavy lifting in healing, as they are by design are better in it. So you don't really need to do anything in raids, you stay behind and try to heal with your 3sec cast healing touches. you really don't need to do anything.
---
I see ppl mention rpds, they are wrong, any dps's have pressure to perform as everyone looking at dps meter. aswell as more consumables, because of that and need to tryhard more in general. and ranged dps are heavily involved in cc, aoeing, focus targeting the right things and so on. healers need to do nothing of it and the most undemanding healer noone expects anything from is a druid. 
---
they also get gear more easily cos there arent many druids usually. So you gear up quicker and can skip some raids and still be geared than many others.
---
Sure you can, you just need to add in grinding in between quests. In fact, for most classes, grinding is just straight up faster than doing quests at all.
---
Ye exactly. A small filter of sorts
---
you sound like someone i should put on my block list.
---
Vanilla UI is rough for healing 40 man raids. Or really, any group size larger than 5.
---
Destiny 2? Gross!
---
classic as fuck
---
Rogues got hit pretty hard in 1.12 but they were still pretty good.  They weren't the dominant powerhouses they were in prior patches, but they could hold their own.  They definitely didn't suck in 1.12, but some classes were really frustrating for rogues (hunters in particular).
---

Can‚Äôt get dpsmate to work with it for some reason
---
Wife is graduating law school around classic release, planning on getting her addicted before she starts working. She loves league of legends, so I think she will have lots of fun with world pvp.
---
Hey, it's a based space game and that's good enough for me. EVE never really took off with me though I've spent way too much damn  money on that game and I didn't like Elite Dangerous so it's all I've got for the moment.
---
_"This Video has been removed for Violating Youtubes terms of Service"_
---
Considering the kind of abuse usually makes it throuh their filters, that doesn't bode well for whoever put that up.
---
I think people are overthinking the sharding issue and getting too worked up over it. If they shard 1-12 (ie Durotar) then you're talking about the first 6 hours of your experience (at a casual pace), out of possibly hundreds of hours of play.
---
For all we know they may only shard the 1-6 starter zone, and then we're talking about just the first 30-45 minutes.
---
Sharding Barrens is highly unlikely. That zone is huge and everything is spread out. After Barrens players begin to get very spread out across multiple zones, and lots of them will start doing instanced content which will alleviate zone congestion even further.
---
Summer officially ends September 23. Just sayin.
---
im taking family law in law school, and honestly marriage sounds like the worst deal for a man taking a financial providing role in the relationship and she doesn't do as much
---
If only Wittgenstein had seen the moon landing on TV, then he would have understood that the good life is being a mindless hedonist!
---
I already "min"ed my relationship. No need to max.
---
This sub is pretty tame compared to some other places I've been. Even the official forums are worse.
---
The forum community has sucked big floppy donkey dick since vanilla, though, this isn't anything new. It has never, ever been an accurate reflection of the in-game experience and that isn't about to change.
---
Except it isn't. Porting the Legion/BFA version of addons to the modified Legion/BFA client we're using for Classic is much less work than porting 1.12 addons to said modified Legion/BFA client.
---
Shattered Hand represent. The best server ever!!
---
Mage and Lock will have plenty of raid spots, Where as Hunter‚Äôs we have limited spots (2-3) plus you will be have to kite some mobs for some encounters plus tranquil shot.
---
I agree that Blizz has a history of taking a mile when given an inch, but I disagree with this idea that we need to be childish dicks about it when somebody creates a topic like this. I think it's important for people to push for classic staying classic, absolutely, but the shit-flinging it often turns into just makes us look like unreasonable, spoiled, entitled children and in all likelihood reduces the chances of such "arguments" being taken seriously.
---
Its good for its on use intellect buff (+20) that can stack with the mages buff or other equivalent scrolls etc. PvP wise its stamina is really nice as well. Stat/buff stick that looks cool - similar to the Will of Arlokk from ZG
---
Hesitated to post this because I know it'd get downvoted. But I have spent a while wondering how Blizzard could improve a game without changing it.  
---
Though technically Blizzard is changing Class WoW either way. Battle Net integration, better graphic options, loot, performance, backend code etc.
---
Try Warframe over D2
---
Tried FFXIV , the amount of shit and information that gets thrown at you at level one made me just not wanting  to even try
---
Boomkin can't be good, because the Druid can respec and then be another role. Somehow, Blizzard convince the player base that this makes sense.
---
Druids are good, boomkin druids are kind of a joke in classic though. They will be bottom tier of damage compared to basically any other spec.
---
anti-druid crowd, thanks for the laugh
---
I raise you world buffs 3% is meh
---
I played FFXIV all the way from Open Beta to the most recent xpack. I love the story, but the crafting was my end-game and I just can't do the gil/materia grind anymore. It's lost its luster for me finally and classic being so close isn't helping either.
---
Yep, no ravasaur.
---
It was supposed to be the horde equivalent, but was left on the cutting room floor with countless other things, such as the shaman air totem quest line.
---
If we see a ravasaur mount grind in classic, it will be part of potential "vanilla +" content.
---
I mean I‚Äôd go orc but that troll gangster lean shooting
---
if you want to dps you're wasting your time, yes, druid is very good at tanking and healing 
---
no standard res really hurts them though
---
I'm probably going to play a Warrior so that I can equip everything (minus wands).
---
I played a Hunter in Cata and really liked how many different abilities I had at my disposal. Ranged attack, traps, freezing, burning, aspect of the cheetah, and my pet, things like that.
---
What are the "unique" things that a warrior can do?
---
Yes - I hope they delay the launch further so people can opt out of a feature that they‚Äôll have absolutely no memory of a couple days after launch.
---
I‚Äôve been playing dota 2 a lot since I don‚Äôt enjoy retail classic very much. Almost made divine. Have about a month before the end of the ranking season, hopefully we have some news of classic dates by then!
---
Yes Method is different to 95% of trade chat recruiting 'semi-hardcore' guilds that make up the LFG thread.     
---
Yes I'm making up numbers. No I don't care you don't believe me. Go for it then, make a hardcore raiding guild with 40 randoms from a reddit thread 4 months out from the game release. I wish you all the best. I'd love someone to prove me wrong.
---
If you are planning to get the mount again, plan out a leveling route that does ALL the TB rep quests as you go, it will make your life a hell of a lot easier.
---
I plan on doing the same for my shaman but with under city for the war horse.
---
Because WoW isn't the only game that you play, maybe?
---
I would say warlock is slightly easier than other dps classes to find a dungeon group because being able to summon to the instance is really nice, and it makes getting everyone there faster.  
---
It's not close to the ease of which a tank or healer finds groups though.
---
yo I was in Iraq last year and got to like 1800 in 3s
---
Sharding is just load balancing, so opting out of load balancing defeats the purpose of load balancing.
---
Its going help when 80% of the population want to play on the server that Method and Swifty are playing on and so you'll have starter zones with 500 gnomes trying to tag 10 wolfs that spawn. Meanwhile a bunch of other servers are virtually empty. So these fan boys can get plonked into one of the other effectively empty servers so they can level a bit, but still join their fan boys guilds and see them in the world.
---
google spits out information, it isn't necessarily good information, he could have easily landed on tipsout or staysafes guides and then where would he be?
---
I'm going to play vanilla for the first time. Warrior or Rogue? I don't know any ways to make money (that's why I'm more leaning towards rogue), but Warrior is the big boi with tha big sword doing big hits. I want a big rotation, many buttons to press which are situational. On retail and since wotlk I've been playing prot pally, here I would be too but in classic we sucked... What do I do?
---
WoW = Life
---
We have nothing to talk about right now. It‚Äôll change when release date comes out and we‚Äôre all actually playing the game. Shitposts are going to be pretty common until release.
---
Imagine OG Barrens chat. Now imagine Twitch chat. Now imagine them merging. That's issue #1, chats like trade chat and city chat being overran by nooblings.
---
Issue #2 comes from the "posse" - that is they will constantly have a mob around them, rendering wpvp against them impossible without a group of similar size and increases the odds of getting ganked.
---
Issue #3 is that since they'll attract a posse it will increase server size which impacts load times and latency. 
---
Issue #4, if you're in the same faction you run the risk of getting harassed/spammed by the noobling posse if you a) don't give a shit about the streamer (or openly trash talk them) or b) become more popular on the server than the streamer
---
The game hasn‚Äôt even been released yet....we have nothing to talk about.
---
You should see the amount of shit posting going on in amazing subs like r/CFB and r/Collegebasketball during offseason.
---
Are we talking Always the bottom, or possibly being 2nd or 3rd to people who arent trying in a dungeon? Lol
---
I do love resto so that's what I'd main, but I would have to get to 60 somehow :P
---
75hz team where you at, wooo
---
&gt;bless u
---
Ah, a Priest *and* a Paladin. This raid is really starting off strong.
---
Tech shit is generally expensive in Australia. You're going to be hard pressed to find a laptop with equivalent spec for $1,600 let alone one much beefier.
---
feral levels as well as hunter or warlock so it's not like you'd have a problem
---
Death and Taxes! They rocked it back in the day. Ironically, the post in which they announced their disband (in late TBC) contains a lot of the complaints raiders still have today about accessibility ruining the experience. Seems like they saw the writing on the wall.
---
Wand Spec first, IMO. You don't really need Spirit Tap much until 20 anyway. That wand damage, tho...
---
Now I can afk in SW at such a high frame rate.
---
I love this shit - thanks for digging this up!
---
They won‚Äôt change if you don‚Äôt run them.
---
240hz is the only way
---
I wish I could say that was the truth
---
Haha yeah, I'd totally have a six pack if not for WoW Classic...
---
This is actually too funny, he was so excited for vendorstrike :') bless him.
