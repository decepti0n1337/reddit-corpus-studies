Of course, I can think of the Dire Maul farmers on Nostalrius for that

---
---
If you want to take it and go to the bottom of the list for spell power ring, by all means.
---
Maybe it’s just a busted de-spawn?
---
We're moving in to a phase where people are starting to see the design flaws of Vanilla that Blizzard tried to address in later expansions - the plateau where once you get your dungeon gear at 60, the only remaining way to progress in the game is to start scheduled 40-person raids. And how new content releases were mainly targeted at players who had already geared up on existing 40-person raid content. 
---

---
As Blizzard started to address these problems in later expansions, they lost something along the way. There is a pleasure and a social aspect to teaming up for obtuse, difficult quests, making long journeys to dungeon entrances, and opening trade windows for mana water. This social aspect is just completely lost in modern retail WoW. And raiding feels less rewarding when your hard-earned gear just becomes completely useless every 3-6 months. The pendulum of accessibility and designing towards easy content has swung way too far in the other direction in retail, and the modern retail subscriber numbers definitely indicate that the retail design team have lost their way. 
---
 I'm hoping that the design team can bring back some of the baseline challenge, gear advantage, and social aspects of Classic in the next retail expansion, while also keeping the parts that make retail a more fun experience for non-raiders.
---
&gt; Did the spawn rates for gathering items increase enough to match the vast populations? 
---
They did for devilsaurs, but I think that was mostly to stop getting complaints about cross faction collusion.
---
They are clearly willing to make changes when it reduces work for them.
---
What aren't you sure of? That they still are jumping through hoops non-dead servers wont' have to?
---
Transferring servers or smuggling materials to alt accounts are both hurdles/hoops non-dead servers don't deal with it doesn't matter which one they choose to do.
---
Warning: I'm full of shit and botted now my account is banned
---
Don't be the guy that is winning all the AVs and farming people for honour?  The only jerk part is that he's explaining his system.
---
Ban/invite is just a term for his filtering.  Ban just means "filtered out"
---
Not that I don't believe you because there are a lot in Hinterlands, but how do you know - have you watched them all? Whispering them doesn't mean anything as they could be afk / not wanting to reply.
---
There’s a difference. If you want to be intentionally too obtuse to understand that, so be it. If they wanted to allow premades, they would have allowed everyone to queue as such. 
---
In its current state, you have one faction who has the ability to obtain an unfair competitive advantage via external programs.
---
Here's how you fix it: More alliance should play AV. That way more Horde will be stuck inside instanced content = everybody wins.
---
^ might contain sarcasm
---
This guy fucks!
---
Seconding this..my 4 friends and I quit when we realized alliance couldn't fight back on stalagg. 2 of us wanted to but ultimately burned out rerolling since our mains had almost full raid gear by then..
---
I mean, if they enjoy pvp as it is now I guess.
---
If by fuckwit you mean someone making a tonne of gold selling ports then its fantastic thanks. :)
---
t0.5 is shadowcraft, yes.
---
the 4pc bonus is the same one as the 6pc on shadowcraft. its just so insanely good cuz u only need 4 instead of 6 pieces
---
I logged onto my account, sold a few items too quickly with Auctionator, logged off and was hit with a ban screen immediately.
---
What do you need gold for?
---
Raids don't require consumables.
---
I fucking died at "scout for new talent". Your playing a video game bro, chill out.
---
As someone who is about to finally get Classic I sincerely hope people don't leave now.  I originally started playing January 2005, and to this day it is still one of the most fun games I ever played.
---
50 AVs per day, 12 minute games. That's 10 hours of AV each day, plus queue times plus "periodically joining pugs". Man I miss living with my mom.
---
Don't go to AV wearing cloth. Wear your t1. Embrace the banana.
---
&gt;#nochanges
---
There have been plenty of chances.  Classic is not vanilla.  The nostalgia is there and the game play is mostly the same, but the way people play it now is totally different.  And really, the nostalgia exist mostly in the leveling experience.  The level 60 experience is its own thing isn't reminiscent of vanilla in any way shape.
---
The players have already brought the changes... so if they are interested in making classic into a long term investment, then it should be open season to tweaks whatever is necessary once everything is released.  There are a plephoha of changes I would welcome right now, but won't happen until a few months after naxx if anything.
---
The only weapon from rag my guild has seen is an Eye, we have been killing rag since week 3...  Also just got our first QSR this past week.  11 brutality blades, 2 viskag and 2 deathbringers though.
---
I'm just trying to let everyone know, to help them. 
---
Why is everyone is so quickly to point fingers. I've never bottled in any game.
---
Haha you're and idiot and got caught botting. Go cry elsewhere.
---
I used auctionator, have done years. It's not getting me banned. You either botted or got a lot of people reporting you.
---
Mageblade as well. Infact almost all drops, as I've only seen 2 drops and I will still need 7 items. Classic's loot is brutal, it seems the 2-3 drops per boss really leaves few room for people to get the loot they want. Some loot gets vendored (Vendorstrike anyone?) while I as a holy paladin have to compete with 8 mages, 4 paladins, a warlock and the occasional druid IF an item DOES drop.
---
Aurastone. We haven't had a single one drop so far. But you bet your ass we get that fucking dagger every single week.
---
No, I didn't bot. Just sold items too quickly with Auctionator as soon as I logged in.
---
And 5 minute Escape artist ^^
---
My apologies if I sounded condescending.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But to elaborate, that's not at all what my bot did. It did not repeat keystrokes. It made decisions on its own. It knew to pot/bandage. It knew how to deviate from its path. It knew how to farm, etc. It ate and drank at predetermined thresholds.. it wasn't mimicking anything.
---
You see it’s a multi level problem. They can’t ban people just cause they got reported a lot, that’s very abusable. So they need to have someone actually check and verify that the reported person was doing something wrong. Since something like that can’t be automated, they won’t ban them cause they don’t have enough staff in the first place. Remember the layoffs blizz did ahwhile back? These are the people that got fired to save them money lol, I’m pretty sure they want to spend as little money as possible on classic as well...
---
Honor awarded from kills vary depending on a lot of factors. Chances are, you're earning less per kill on average this week than you did last. 
---
Due to the group environment, you really don't get a lot of honor from kills in AV. People severely overestimate how much honor they should be getting. It doesn't help that the game doesn't even show honor based on diminishing returns whenever you get a kill.
---
I think it flagged because I sold items too quickly as soon as I logged in. So try not to do the same and you'll be good.
---
I've heard it happens if you buy out items too fast too.
---
Any warrior wpns of any kind since week 5
---
Something running in the addons directory only has access to the hooks provide by the games LUA, if the add-on was causing issues (see honorspy a patch a go) Blizzard will remove the hook.
---
To trigger the bot protection you need to be playing in the memory space,  so you botted.
---
God.  You fucking people. Just play as intended for God's sake.
---
How are you deducing they are bots from that picture lol?
---
Ten Storms is a blast. Really fun server.
---
So they aren't the same efficiency, got it. If they were, you'd only have 250 healing was my point.
---
I'm trying to warn people to help everyone, why is everyone so quickly to blame me. 
---
My gosh... lol.... that’s a load of people!
---
&gt;“Rebalance the racials somehow? Wotf 5 min, orc stun 10%?”
---
No ty. You can go play retail if you want a “balanced” game.
---
Ledditors are big noobs, Most of them are still not 60
---
Good, you hunters have been making too much gold anyway
---
Top end aint shit all about top DPS for weapon
---
Well, I think we did priority for the tanks but those were 4-5 poeple. After that it was for all because to be honest we never had any dps problems with molten core even from the first try. Everybody should have loot and be happy. I think after and during BWL it is another thing as raids are gonna be harder but outside gearing tanks 1 dps shouldn't be prioritazied over another.
---
The fast games for alliance always get 3-4K honor becuase you kill the all the lieutenants. The turtles give roughly the same honor but take ~3-6x longer
---
Because the addon isn't doing anything to get you banned. It has been around years and can't physically do anything to bot because it uses the API blizzard provides. It's an addon.
---
You've done something else to get banned. The time you get banned has nothing to do with when the thing you did happened. You could have used a bot 2 months ago and it's only just banned you.
---
He wasnt locked to a pug raid, it was an officer in the guild that had something come up due to the holidays so he was going to log out @ MC and instead of outside he logged inside.   
---
the person with the locked raid ID never zoned in
---
that really sucks! sorry to hear that
---
Yeah, Solo is the company that makes those, and are super cheap and found in just about every store that sells party stuff, food, alcohol, etc. Lots of people (myself included) bought a bag of like 500 for $20 and whenever I have a bunch of guests over I just pull them out since cleaning up the next day is super easy.
---
Play as "intended" in a 15 year old game in which most concepts have been scrapped because they weren't working as intended?
---
Ony Cloak's are useful for BWL, nearly required. Not sure why it would cost thousands of gold but it should go to a LW reasonably early.
---
Yeah you guys learned early on, now i know!
---
Anyone can do it with a simple google. Anyone with a very basic understanding in programming (which is really intuitive so not hard to learn) can do it in 5 seconds without google.
---
You make an infinite loop that jumps and then waits for a random number between say 32 and 102 seconds, and then jumps again and waits again etc...
---
I'm not sure how that looks inhuman when inspected closely, but it could be said that a human would be very unlikely to be *this* perfectly random. If you're chasing perfection, I suppose it'll have to be a bit more intricate in the random number logic. Maybe, pick a random number between 90 and 120, sometimes, randomly (20% chance) repeat the keystroke two times within .2 to 1 seconds, sometimes (5% chance) completely skip a keystroke, another time (5% chance) change the range to 20-50, that kind of thing.
---
Processed meat, I’m really not interested in your mommy issues, but I’ll reply to your comment because I’ll have the last word and finally put your online outburst to rest.
---
Meh it is the same as not giving a melee ranged wep to a hunter. Hunters will get a better wep when the bow or whatever will be used for a long time by the melee.
---
Pretty sure they don’t actually want bots in their game is possible... but anyway they won’t spend money to have real people check this kind of thing
---
I've been raiding as combat daggers for about a month or so and I think I'm about ready to make the switch to SF.  The damage output of combat daggers is really great but holy crap the rotation is a total snooze.  You just maintain slice and dice while backstabbing.  You can't even throw in any eviscerates because by the time you've filled up your CP your 5 point SnD is about to wear off. 
---
I think I'm willing to put up with slightly worse parses if it means I get to have a little more fun playing the class.
---
People just need to grow up a bit, most the player base are men in their 30's, it's a tad bit sad when they lose their collective marbles over someone multi-boxing, especially when they just want to assume that person is somehow ruining their experience. Here i am farming gold to buy my characters their mounts but apparently that is economy breaking? Or somehow ruining their own experience? It's like folks stopped aging mentally around 2005.
---
moba Regis 4
---
Figures. He appeals to children I guess. Carry on
---
Oh ur talking about the upgraded version?
---
I said I'd never join a reserve run and that tanks that do reserve runs are greedy. Never said they were equal to dps or shouldn't reserve orbs just that I'd never join their group...
---
My bf kept using Messenger to see when I went to bed and then would lecture me on gaming late... Cut that shit out, he's single now
---
Yes, if there is a raiding group of 25 people then it is 24 people and me.  If the raids are 40 people, then it's a stupid name
---
the no duhs guy the no mommorpherfire guy
---
I think we've seen 2 eyes so far out of 12 runs I believe. We started giving leafs to our rogues
---
Its harder to pull off good numbers with the build on alliance, but still viable.  Its harder to execute perfectly where as DW is easy.  But you will want a OEB/TUF at min to try it, if not a BRE/Spinal Reaper/Hand of Rag.
---
TIL. Im a warrior
---
Perhaps the issue is not with the need to change, but rather that many players don't trust the current design team to execute the changes well, and would rather keep the current flaws than have them mess with the game.
---
Using communication to queue at the same time in hopes that you can have a better-than-pug team in AV is not something you should be punished for 
---
Using Ventrilo back in the day to queue together at the same time was not a punishable offense and it shouldn’t be in classic WoW either
---
thats kinda what they do best, and that level range sucks for quests
---
This.
---
False. Alliance tanks still need to fury tank once fury warrs start doing over 850 dps
---
Ummm yikes sweaties!!! Thank you for telling us what we can and cant enjoy!! 
---
Convinced me to check out more of his stuff, this dude is hilarious. Thanks for your unintended reccomendation.
---
Join the discord, it has the information your seeking
---
That’s kind of funny because he did the same level race on Light’s Hope on private servers before classic release, and as far as I can remember “random scrub” was pretty much what everyone thought of him lol.
---
&gt; At 0%, 1% crit adds 1% crit. At 99%, 1% crit adds 1% crit.
---
Yes, well done. Crit, in terms of crit, adds exactly as much crit as was added to crit. Genius. If you'll note though, we are trying to see how much crit adds *in terms of healing.* The units are different, and it turns out they are nonlinear due to the `(1-a)^2`part of the second term.
---
&gt; On a 5 minute fight
---
Ah, we can add in another constraint if you'd like. So 5 minutes is 300 seconds, and each cast is 1.5 seconds. Therefore, the maximum number of casts is `300/1.5=200`. Interestingly, the metrics I used before were `M=13000` mana and `X=35` cost, so you were base line allowed `13000/35 = 371` casts, which is already higher than our saturation number. Therefore, it would behoove you to simply use a higher rank FoL since you'll get higher HpS and less left-over mana at the end of the fight.
---
Knowing the math I've already done for priests, I can guarantee that a higher rank FoL will further emphasize the int weight (int scales better with a heal's base since higher ranks are base-line more efficient). I'm going to check with my guild's paladins for their stats and raid logs to see what their stat ratios should be.
---
Isnt that exactly 1/3 the game? Followed by dungeons and pvp,
---
All I see is a /who for 1-60..
---
We do fixed cost items dkp with class restrictions.
---
All OS stuff is /roll'ed
---
Against shit mages, maybe.
---
&lt;Sweet Mustard&gt; !
---
Well the honor system killed the game for me personally
---
Get honor spy
---
All eu pvp servers have the flavor of nasty green yuck to some extent. You'll never get 50/50.
---
&gt; if its not a quick win, bail.
---
The 15-minute afk debuff gives them an excuse to stand up, take a bio break, etc.
---
Wait those are all really funny though.
---
&gt;Well, he was the culprit, entering Molten Core with an alt warlock saved to MC @ DM put him in his pug raid ID and he logged to secure us with the same ID when we all entered an hour or so late and he was still logged off.
---
You literally said the saved alt warlock entered mc then you the rest of your raid did an hour later?
---
[removed]
---
Yeah it was pretty ridiculous. I'm used to running in raids where they count down to the % before she is about to take off and they say to pop all cooldowns and burst her as much as possible from around 70% or something as she walks over to fly. Staying below threat isn't tough if you ramp it up like that - but I guess they had some PTSD from prior attempts. Was brutal on the healers though, doing it that slowly.
---
Keep in mind the slam auto macro will not net you 2 windfury procs because of spell batching.
---
No Brutality Blade, Nightslayer chestpiece, BRE.... Viskag. It's rough for us rogues especially
---
He used a fishing bot.
---
he is lying if he says he didnt.
---
It can affect economies if they are taking what they earn and manipulating the market. Hell if I had wanted I could of taken all the gold I had gotten from dungeon farming and vendoring to blow away the market but really all I wanted to do was buy my characters skills and mounts. I'm not here trying to be some god of the market or an asshole, I'm playing the game how I like to and doing what I can to avoid negatively affecting others. But that won't stop folks assumptions, and really it's experiences like this that make me sad for the player-base.
---
Disable transfers for shamans and paladins.
---
Wow that was easy!
---
Yeah, because the bonus scales with your other gear (esp. weapon). A rogue with blue weapon and extra energy is much weaker than rogue with a naxx purple and extra energy.
---
Slam macro wont get fixed, it was already commented on by a blue to be working as intended just like heroic strike queing your offhand.
---
Yeah i didnt think we stood a chance to get in touch with a GM that night and somehow it was within the hour. Sadly he was getting off of work and couldnt help us all out and only the one member.   
---
I agree it was our responsibility but with the confusion of the warlock not being in the raid at the time and still @ DM it didnt make sense. We didnt realize the person the was logged off was inside until we realized we where locked.
---
Based on the other posts it seems a banwave is happening.
---
This is the trick. Casual players are saying how much they're enjoying classic. Many who aren't casual players have been out of content for a while and see that they will be in this cycle for a long time with no real endgame or meaningful pvp in sight. In vanilla you always had things to work on, but the hardcore players have ruined the game for themselves in a lot of ways by rushing to finish it all up so quickly. 
---
 In many ways classic is an incomplete game we are playing, and the top end of players who dedicate a lot of time wont stick around if they have no reason to continue logging on. They/we ruined it for ourselves, but the gaming environment has changed so much that the game has to adapt to that in ways.
---
So they do check your addons?
---
I hear that’s the fastest way to jerk off everyone in the room.
---
The casterring is shit. It’s normal.
---
shut up liar. 
---
Auctionator or other AH add-ons will never get you banned. 
---
Add-ons or botting that do stuff automatically without your input gets you banned.
---
Which guy are you referring to?
---
I'm creating a list and need to know.
---
pretty much yea
---
the bot aint an addon.
---
Things running in the /addon/ directory wont get you banned as they can only use blizzard approved hooks/api to do stuff.
---
The fishbot run externally.
---
Yeah, just like their t0 obsoleted t1. /s
---
WOAHH OMG CHARLOTTESVILLE OMG HOW DID YOU SURVIVE??? One lady died, and you guys act like it was 9/11. Theres a crazy amount of violence and death from the left as well. Stop being so sensitive.
---
lol horde premades. cute.
---
( ཀ ʖ̯ ཀ)
---
Remind me to give you an EU discord server tomorrow
---
&gt;i get we have probelms with botter but ffs. game literally just started and standing up to stretch is an afk...
---
     
---
Hear hear!  Sitting down to jerk shouldn't be an afk either!
---
/moo  
---
Yawn PogU
---
So what's the criteria for determining if someone is using a bot?

Yeah, thats why people hardly complain about League of Legends.
---
Losers
---
Balalalaaa
---
Hmmm well I guess he might fight it, but sounds like someone else had to fight this kinda stuff for months, so I guess it depends on his desire to continue playing.. Thanks for the info, peeps.. Kind of a "trust one person over others" thing.. Dude's pretty trustworthy and I believe him, but if you guys aren't seeing it, guess there isn't much that can be done.. Was really seeing if anyone else had seen it
---
Been clearing since mid October, no aurastone hammers or no mageblades as well. Only one deathbringer and one vis'kag. Only one shield from rag as well, but the shaman who won it left the guild, so we have none.
---
I took me 2 hours to hello my guildie's warrior level two of  his weapon skills to 289 at that spot.
---
It also takes about 3-4 low level dungeons (RFC) boost runs to reach 300. Dungeons are more efficient for weapon skill
---
The advice in this thread is pretty questionable. If you pug MC at random times with random groups every week some of them will inevitably be shitshows and you'll end up spending a much longer time actually raiding. The loot younger will also be completely RNG and not scale with time invested.
---
Join a half decent guild that can clear MC and Ony in a smooth two hours and just put that time aside once a week in a place that fits your schedule. Spend a couple hours variably once a week getting your consumables ahead of time and you're good to go!
---
How does call that small action bar for eq pieces?
---
Leveling as drain tank is like this. Sadly there isnt much you are doing wrong. I would personally suggest doing sbolt spam and waiting on tank for 3-5 seconds before starting to cast. Other than that just keep in mind that come 60 you will become a beast when properly geared/talented.
---
Me too please.
---
You didnt answer the question.
---
I got Humar after camping for hours, and I found Broken Tooth randomly while flying to Badlands on Christmas Eve. My early WoW Christmas gift. :P
---
There’s your answer.
---
Looks like Elon musk’s cybertruck
---
I've to say I'm really waiting for TBC. Have had fun in Classic but I just feel like I don't want to schedule my life around raids again and pvp is pretty trash. Did tons of arena back in TBC and it doesn't require strickt timetables and playing a lot since it's more about skill than grinding.
---
DAFUQ
---
Yes, it was popular for the reasons I outlined.  It took place in the same universe as a beloved pre-existing IP and "blew away everything else competing with it" because the competition was *that* fucking awful.  When the bar is set so low that it's basically buried, clearing it is easy.
---
I would NOT skip ST. It is a low chance but the best pre-raid bracers drop there. It is a headache and most dont want to run it - but if you find a group lf a dps - go. Also Mara has the best wand for your level and for sometime after.
---
I was trying to be sarcastic
---
You should see my current ring
---
Ya people like you are exactly the reason OP shouldn't bother pugging. Show up unprepared in dogshit gear and afk the whole time, even during bosses. What a scumbag haha.
---
125.8% win rate.  Now what?
---
All 8 of them left hate their lives.
---
And it's mostly deserved, oddly.
---
How do you know it was too quickly? You sound pretty certain, which is pretty suspect.
---
1) Warrior outdps rogues in every raid, every phase all throughout Vanilla. 
---
2) Warrior with engineering and FAP or LIP consumables along with some practice will make you obliterate almost  anyone in front of you. 
---
3) Nothing beats that amazing feeling of charging someone, stick to their face while criting the living crap out of them. 
---
4) You will always find a healer in any BG.  If you’re good, they will automatically want to heal you. If are still learning the ropes, ask them to tag team with you. 
---
5) Playing the underdog 1v1 class in the game while getting good at it will make you stand out. It’s VERY satisfying and the adrenaline rush when you out play your counter class is just priceless. 
---
6) Warriors SHINE in BGs and premades.
---
You mean 4-set bonus? And you need a 4-piece naxx set to fully benefit from it.
---
You're right i guess i don't entirely know that's what caused it, i edited my post.
---
I have spoken.
---
Honor &amp; faction rep.
---
not lost an av all day... the only diff is literally everyone is doing premades now.
---
Story time.
---
Blizzard's model for Classic WoW quite closely resembles that of a not-so-successful vanilla private server. The name rhymes "Bronos 3". 
---
"Bronos 3" also had a similar issue with people excessively farming honor in the open world. This type of farming strongly amplifies the faction ratios unless the ratio is balanced. 
---
The theory among Bronos players was: When the starting point is that the weaker faction is *too* outnumbered to fight back against the dominant faction, then the players of the weaker faction get farmed. This leads to players of the weak faction quitting the game. This skews the ratio even further thus amplifying the effect.
---
I'm not 100% sure how this relates to Classic but it's definitely food for thought.
---
You're right, it is weird that it would come instantly, i guess i don't entirely know that's what caused it, i edited my post.
---
Have you done silvermine forest? Green quests are easy to blitz through for exp. You can also start hillsbrad.
---
Having cleared Naxx 40 back in the day (Tichondrius, Easy Company, World #69), I know there is actually a lot of logistical work that hardcore guilds need to be doing right now to prepare for Naxx. To clear Naxx you need 50 raiders (to accommodate absence and stack the raid for specific fights) who can raid 3-4 nights per week and have at least mostly full sets of tier 2 raid gear. An elite team of 40 clearing MC every week right now is not going to get you to this point.   
---
Even if the MC content isn't hard, you need to be spending this time bulking up your guild membership, starting a second MC raid, sorting out your culture and loot system, and getting a lot of people geared. There is plenty of work to do right now! Maybe hardcore players just don't realize it.
---
If you like balanced servers, Flamelash is the place to go. Perfect 50-50 balance between Orcs and Undead. We don’t have alliance though.
---
And pala set is kinda like t2, but inferior.
---
The guild has stated they want their members to do this. Are they going to have an issue if you say no? If you really don’t want to level an alt then I think the answer is pretty simple if it’s going to cause issues with your standing in the guild
---
because the top dps warriors will be dw fury since it's better.  This post is about 2h fury right?  So you're not gonna be top dps in the world as 2h fury, but if you want to do good dps as 2h fury you need to use the slam macro.
---
Blame the system, not the player. If the best pvp gear required skill rather than ridiculous time investment none of this would be a thing.
---
WoW should never be a chore. We play to be happy. Part of that happiness is the people we play with. However, the game itself is what really motivates us. 
---
If you don't want to level an alt for split runs and you cannot see a viable path to remaining in the guild, then you should find a guild to be happy in.
---
Huh? Did I miss something?
---
5% of the most vocal and whiney people are posting things about the game. When you have mediocre to good service but not out of the ordinary, do you leave a review? If somebody shit in your drink and smeared ketchup in your face, would you complain?
---
People, relative to negative feedback, rarely go out of their way to comment on positive experiences.
---
You’re missing the point. They allow you to queue as a group for 2/3 of the battlegrounds. AV is intentionally left out of that. Because one faction has an instant queue, they’re able to bypass that, using external programs. I don’t have a clue if it’s against TOS, but it’s absolutely against the spirit of the game. 
---
It’s the same reason they disallowed the LFG add on.
---
Ok boomer
---
What consumables are needed for BWL
---
It does, and theyre both hideous. At least the cybertruck is a joke. This thing is just ugly
---
Um.... I argue this comment about it being a sign of reckless or naive gameplay. 
---
Locks that have ruin talented will peal off a tank on a double crit. The odds of double critting is not high when leveling but it does and can happen. Still to this day our guild tanks sometimes lose threat from multiple crits happening, and i personally stop casting 100% when i see a double crit go off if it doesnt peal just because i know anything more will.  If you are going to claim to be clairvoyant and know when you are going to double crit- then please let us borrow your crystal ball.
---
Err what?  As someone who did premade AV a lot in vanilla there absolutely were premade AVs lol.
---
There was even an addon to time up everyone's in-game queue so you didn't need voip to sync it, you could just join a raid in game and have 1 person queue and it did the queue automatically for everyone at the exact same milisecond.
---
if they punish you for not leveling an alt to feed members then yes just /gquit
---
If MC is taking 3+ hours to clear, it is definitely not because a mage is tabbed out. Not to mention I still out dps half the other mages in fights while only tabbing in to press frostbolt. If i'm half afk, what are they doing?
---
Yeah this happened to me too, also half assing some av but obviously not botting. Honor spy was doing some weird stuff earlier this week adding and removing friends so I'm thinking maybe that triggered it for me but I figured the addon was fine since it's on the twitch app
---
Yes I do :)
---
I didn't call anyone an liar. I just don't have any issues. 
---
You are making it an issue - your problem. 
---
While we wait a tad longer we also get honour faster/more per run. In the end all is fine cause I only have to invest half the time to achieve the same.
---
fury vs deep prot is less of the issue, gearing not in all defense gear is more important. Deep prot still generates good agro if you wear the right gear.
---
I just want to know the best way to Fuck with a bot. Or maybe some fun or funny ways to Fuck with them.
---
Where's Nelson from *The Simpsons* when you need him?
---
Just wanna add to this: 
---
Keep in mind this discord just launched so still ironing out some kinks. We need as many horde as we can get in there for it to work properly so gogo join up.
---
Once we have the numbers, we're expecting 20-30+ in voice for each AV rather than the 6-10 we're currently getting. Should be great if people are patient long enough to get it running 100%
---
I get your sentiment, naxx will test us and it is essentially endgame. But for heavily focused pvp players like myself, I wont feel that endgame fulfilled truly into bc era. Pvp is in a really bad place right now
---
I'll wait here while you tell the rest of the story that you intentionally chose to exclude.
---
What a time to be alive
---
Oh joy a return of the elitist wow players, people who arent actually part of any well know or major guilds but act like anyone who isn't 100% min maxed and play perfect to their expectations is absolutely trash at the game. I know wow can take over tour life a bit at times but at the end of the day its a game, I play to have fun, and yeah its frustrating when you wipe on a boss, or get out played in AV, it happens but there always another attempt, a fresh BG. Don't be a dick and ruin other ppls time playing the game
---
Full quest run of ST gives a lot of XP. And mara has a really good caster weapon (sword with 1% crit from tinkerer).
---
It told me I didn't have flair attached to my post and the moderators removed it? IM J.ANISTON AND THIS FLAIR STUFF IS BULLSHIT
---
wat
---
You're welcome. Learn how to talk to people and you may get different results. Until then have a happy New year.
---
So I doubt they will keep you banned but you do deserve this punishment for your "actions" ironic 😂 you shouldnt que for something and go afk and have your team do all the work just so you can lvl,honor,mount,etc. That's not what it means to be a team. Also just cause you see other people doing it doesn't mean its right, as they have and will get banned aswell. Let this be a learning lesson for you and to everyone that does this.
---
The entire story is in the title, but if you have questions feel free to ask
---
3rd post about bans in an hour/
---
Surf's up boys, lets ride this ban wave all the way in.
---
Priest.  Holy/Disc already does a ton of damage in 1v1 situations.  If they could get max shadow damage and heals, they would be unstoppable.
---
Druids would suck because they already suck.  And also because of gear.  IF you were in feral gear, your heals and spells would still suck.  If you were in heals/boomkin gear, your feral would suck.  Having all the talents wouldnt change that aspect.
---
 🔨
---
And I thought Asmon was a tool.
---
Flair is how posts are organized
---
is dual boxing characters legit in the TOS?
---
Idk, it’s super easy to add the flair and mods made it pretty clear they would delete posts without flair.
---
It’s dungeons. You need to wait to do all the WPL and EPL quests until you are revered. Once revered the dungeon elites don’t give rep so you need to save the quests for after that to make the grind the exalted as easy as possible.
---
One of the few things I'd change if I could. It is a relic and should never be in this game as the current pvp meta exists.
---
Imo that’s a scummy thing to do and I’m glad ur banned
---
is SF really that good? I've been running 18/28/5 spec to stack damage on my backstab crits and the imp damage from duel wield spec is pretty nice. I really hate running cookie cutter specs, with what I got I can usually beat rogues who are my gear level (I dont have HOJ yet either). daggers is the way to go IMO
---
Sounds like two accounts, and youre just preventing other people from leveling wherever youre at. 
---
Just sounds like griefing to me, not necessarily cheating.
---
blizzard *literally* does not give a single shit about classic. there wont be a rebalance or anything because that would mean blizzard misses out on transfer money
---
not going to happen, they WILL let this game die over that
---
Hopefully perm banned
---
Done a bunch of runs including today and never had this issue.
---
wut
---
Not sure if its zoomers or crusty millenial boomers but these guys exist by the thousands on the servers i played in after tbc
---
Even in classic, just yesterday a druid was threatening people to play better or he would drop the wsg flag on purpose
---
Thrall's walls! I wish use of Auctionator would get people banned!!!
---
Since you’re rolling on a new server I’d go hunter. You’ll be able to farm gold way more effectively than if you were a shaman.  Also hunters are super fun to play and can solo a lot of content.
---
Bruh we have someone turn in the Head 6 hrs before raid time....just so we can make sure we have buff for raid time. What they are doing isn't bad in fact, you expecting it to be at a certain time and not getting it is actually the problem
---
You're changing your position.  You went from saying that Horde will have no queue times to queue times aren't that bad.  Just admit that your initial position was wrong or are you just incapable of this very basic thing?
---
Look up the enclave
---
I'm reading both sides' frustrations here and I can sympathize with them all. On Horde you've got 20+ minute queues for a 10 minute stomp due to alliance premade. Can't imagine how that feels. On the Alliance side, however, you either solo queue and end up 3v40, or join a premade for easy rep/honor. Before premades, horde was winning easily 80% of the games I'd play because Alliance only knew how to push Galv/drek (often times splitting and pushing both), getting wiped and then scattering until we lost. It's not fun. My question is, what's the solution here? It seems both sides are just trying to cope with what they percieve to be an awful experience.
---
Dayumm and i thought only Steam forums will be full of ‘VAC banned but i didnt cheat!’ kind of threads..
---
lmao I got put on some cringy list by some trash guild on my server cause I told a sword rogue he shouldn't be rolling on a dagger. He agreed with me then I said so why'd you do it and he got mad. GUess it worked out cause I wont have to worry about getting into groups with trash people from his guild which cant even clear MC yet lol
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13338/core-rat
---
Depends if you have Edgemaster's or not.  
---
Play around with the sim / spreadsheet: https://guybrushgit.github.io/WarriorSim/
---
Ring of spellpower and Sash of whispered secrets. Do they even exist?
---
He might be alliance
---
Schematic: Major Recombobulator takes up a blue spot...but theres no way you got that 11 runs in a row. So I have no idea, I haven't ran it in weeks.
---
So we should get a 6 month ban for walking away from our keyboard right?
---
And losing money from people quiting because of the situation.
---
&gt; DPS warriors are fine. A significant block of the people choosing to play them are horrible.
---
Pretty much sums it up.
---
It was possibly rabbits. I know in vanilla and maybe for a little bit after, rabbits were used to “cast” effects in cities and the world.
---
I had a warrior wanting to fury tank with leather.
---
To be 10 again
---
I’m situations like this you will get much faster responses on the official wow forums. I once had my chars exp locked in classes after a gm logged into my account to fix an issue. He forgot to unlock my exp. This was in the second week of classic and reply times were well over 24 hours.
---
I submitted a post to the forums and a mod there handled it nearly immediately.
---
He means with BWL likely out within a month DB will be out classed with the BWL axes.
---
Hahaha I love this sort of stuff.
---
Oh one of those warriors.
---
I play alliance on Razorgore-EU. Great server! World is alive and worldpvp still happens, but much less after bgs released.
---
You clearly arn't on board with the slam plan
---
AFAIK you have to be extremely aggressive in escalating your case and asking for a higher rank GM to look it over. Talking to the usual "Ramrukhasa" support agent is never going to get you anywhere, they have obvious canned responses and only do the basic tickets, not anything this complex.
---
Most any ban appeal can be reversed, but botting is typically the hardest, because in most games they won't show you their evidence, and it is hard for you to disprove their evidence when you don't even know what it is.
---
Scummy and bannable/cheating are not the same thing.  I'm not even sure this is scummy.  He's pvping on a pvp server.  He is using an alliance character to kill horde players in certain areas so that he can have that area to himself on his horde character.  Absolutely nothing wrong with that because all of those players are able to do exactly the same thing to him.
---
its a 15 year old game thats been theorycrafted to death, there is no skill involved in being 'the best' its just following guides and doing something over and over til you get the best items. nobody is impressed that you are top DPS meters or have best gear lol it jjust means you play the game way too muhc
---
This comment is from thottbot.
---
I had sometimes in the past only 2 blues but was rare.
---
Just did some runs today all with 3 blues and no aggro issue
---
Everyone knew horde was gonna be outnumbering alliance. You know who's fault it is? Yours for picking the bad faction lol how's that?
---
There's **[snakes](https://i.imgur.com/4P5N93r.jpg)** under gundrak too
---
i love how your group fucks up and then doubles down if they dont get their way with a gm. such disgusting, selfish behaviour.
---
Somehow I read your tittle and thought you said BOTTLED and got extremely confused
---
Ah, yeah =/. That's a grim outlook for a long while.
---
Find a pally tank and spam hellfire
---
This is me currently. About from the eating garbage and no exercise the rest is me. 
---
And funnily I also got a 6 month ban. I would say I’m getting 12-15 hours online a day some days.
---
Right on thanks ill look into it. I wasnt sure if there was an easy way to get sounds. Thanks
---
I'm not sure that is true. Skarm used to suggest the trinket.
---
Right on, whats one aspect you are pimp at? I also make hiphop tracks
---
Went to bed at 4AM last night good thing it’s still the holidays and no one is doing anything at work anyways lol
---
did my first raid everything went perfectly but the healer officer wasnt happy because we (paladins) didnt dispel enough... so how can i improve my dispel? they recced me to use healbot, i see it great because it changes the colour of whos debuffed but how can i dispel him if either of the mouse1 or mouse2 are heals and they wont even target the guy i click just heal him?
---
Need to collect sounds then, which part of a track are you the best are craftin?
---
Remind me
---
I'm saying that casuals weren't the only one. Plenty of hardcore raiders from my day didn't realize that they existed either. I myself and my brother who cleared 6 or 8 bosses in Naxx back then, which is as hardcore as it gets, didn't realize that the servers were out there.
---
i will engage maximum karen mode if my appeal is not granted
---
nice video please create one about your UI/addons
---
Mageblade has dropped twice for us and gone to a holy Paladin each time (we use Suicide Kings). There might be a few unhappy mages and warlocks in our guild.
---
For what it's worth, you could also try it the other way, which is less popular i admit, by taking more of the utility role and help others do more of what they're good at.
---
Help them survive: imp out with blood pact, give healthstones. Don't forget to refresh SS.
---
Help dps do more dmg: CoR if more mdps group or CoE if mage(s) present(s). 
---
Help control the fights: controlled fear with CoR, take adds attacking the healer. Watch for patrols.  Basically be the group "eyes".
---
There's so much more to bring to the table if you're not "ready" to be a full rdps in your career (leveling).
---
But most important, have fun! :)
---
Right now..... yes
---
Come p3 - not as easily but still possible. 
---
Come AQ - no.
---
Thank you
---
Forgot to mention it was my mage account that got banned, not main one, it only has level 40 mage, it’s 4 days old and needless to say that mage has never seen AV or botted. Thanks to reddit I can now see my ban has nothing to do with killing other guys as I thought before, but the thing is it’s still inappropriate.
---
you look pretty stupid right now. no wonder blizzards thinks they can get away with their stupidity with customers like you.
---
Wife fell asleep on the couch last night. I get off the computer at 4am to go to sleep for work so I go to wake her up to get into bed.. that was a mistake lol
---
Deathwish and MS.
---
Back in vanilla warrior got 1 extra talent point due to a bug and could wreck with both... for like 24 hours before it was hot-fixed.
---
We had mage blade week 1 (I won it by luck) but have had almost zero patterns, recipes, bindings, or any other non "expected" gear.
---
Peetty sure it will take the first log. Then when the other guy locked with a different IDwill try to enter it wont work for him !
---
&gt; and alliance can get into a new game that much quicker
---
That's the reason we don't care.  Actually, sometimes that's the reason we intentionally make games longer, although it helps that it's on pare, and even actually better honor for us to draw games out.
---
\&gt; Or doesnt it matter as much if the dps is higher 
---
  
---
This. Also, you should always prioritize weapons you have weapon skill for. So axes for orcs, swords/maces for humans, daggers for everyone else (because mugger's belt from DM;N is easy to get, as well as distracting dagger from DM:W)
---
I mean that's fine, be arms, but it's complete poop compared to fury in terms of DPS.
---
i think if you teleport them mid botting it fucks up their way-points system
---
I did the same thing but Alliance cause my friends wanted to. Only me and 2 others made it to 60. I did it as a warrior solo.
---
Then P2 dropped and unless there is a streamer raid in the area it's horde death squads all the way up the mountain. It's like the entire faction exists only to bodyguard them.
---
An an extent yes, but as fury, your only ability that’s going to be effected by weapon speed is whirlwind/cleave. On a single target fight check how much of your damage is whirlwind, scale that down, and boost your white damage up. I’m sure someone can do the math on wether x is better than y
---
you also have 0  brain if you think its self-inflicted. such a pity.
---
Seeing people talking as if bots aren't getting banned is weird to me. One of my guildies duo boxed a pair of mages, doing dungeon crawls with his priest-playing wife, while running a runecloth bag buying bot for money. Despite manually controlling both mages, one of his mage accounts was banned along with his runecloth bag buying account.
---
Some people can only dick swing in video games. It is the height of their meager existence.
---
Half asking av =/= ban
---
Using 3rd party software and getting caught by warden = ban
---
*b-bb-but I SWEAR I didn’t cheat bro!*
---
LOL
---
Same as MC, but BWL is generally harder, so more reason to actually use them
---
My guild is essentially the same. We bring alts to soak up pieces that we’ve been flooded with.
---
thats true our furors are always top 1&amp;2  im hovering around 9-11
---
It isn't, but that's ok
---
lmao Ebenezer
---
&gt;reality check indicates that there was some truth in the famous "You think you do, but you don't.
---
Not really. Vanilla has been amazing on private servers for the last few years. So I know it can be an amazing experience with proper management.
---
Rogue.
---
You don't have to play Fury, as much as they don't have to invite you to raids. As long as that choice remains, play whatever you like. 
---
Arms and Fury are pretty much exactly the same PvE Dps playstyle. So I'm not sure why you don't like them.
---
Imaging using 3rd party software and getting caught by warden lmao
---
Yeah currently I only got  a Demonshear and my perfromance is utter shit, I also can't get the timings right with slam. It's just a nightmare.
---
Let me tell you who's not gonna be first in line to get BWL weps:
---
the guy who just got a wep
---
If someone tagged your mobs before you could tag them, would you still keep attacking them? Would you speak up at all? Would you respond to a /s "hey"? None of them respond to anything other than waypoints and attacking one target at a time.
---
FREE MENETHIL!!!!
---
One thing to add too, the Rank 14 gear is the best gear *in the game* for most specs, and will only really be contended by a handful of gear from now till Naxx.
---
So right now even PvE-ers want that shit.
---
Who the fuck cares about world pvp this much? I care about the bg que times, and since the ques are battlegroup based I'd say the game has balanced out from the hype. Like 26 minute AV ques for Ally to exploit Marshall glitch is pathetic and tilting.
---
You missed the part where I didnt use 3rd party software, and the part where they didnt list afk AV as a ban reason
---
Boomkin with Tranquil Spirit and Nature's Swiftness would be amazing.
---
Fuck all you botters.  It's about time you got banned.  I repeat, go fuck yourself, and don't even bother trying to whine about how you are innocent.
---
&gt;PvPers roll horde for ez life racials lol. 
---
Based on what evidence? I rolled Horde because I like the aesthetic and I played it back in 2004.
---
&gt;  Any thread on the topic of PvP would've told you that without any faction balance control horde will be favored and be facing the shit end of the stick in terms of queues. 
---
That's not the point here. Of course the side with more players will have queues, that's a given.
---
nobody is rank 12 yet
---
Skarm is bad
---
You must be brand new to WoW if you think Druids are a meme class. TF bro?
---
Correct
---
Sure, sure, of course you didn’t. LOL
---
Looks like a major bot-ban wave is hitting.
---
There is a weakauras build that is an attack timer bar that changes color when you can slam, it helps.  PM me if you xant find I can't send you the export
---
Loving these bans.  Bots and cheaters are cancer.  Bring in the karma train.
---
This. Free me from this curse
---
It wasn't even me who got banned dumbfuck. I know f or a fact my friend who got banned did NOT bot. Probably a mass report from another competing alliance guild. Dude is opposite faction as me and he's literally in a premade voice all day. The gm literally said "you have a high activity log" thats the only evidence  they have againsst him.
---
Probably gonna head to hillsbrad. Where to after that?
---
No that is against the TOS. There is a reason you arent allowed to make an alliance and horde on a PvP server and he bypassed this with his alternate account. Peace
---
Ashbringer is great, seems really balanced. Im on there as a Alliance player.
---
If you're a caster and want/need ony head you playing gaem worng.
---
Nope deserved
---
Having 2 accounts isn't against the TOS though.
---
yah, sure buddy...
---
There are very few times where a 3rd party ban is wrong these days. Im not jumping to accuse you without evidence, but if you did something as simple as a macro or an auto clicker....you might as well just stop while youre ahead
---
I think the real """mental gymnastics""" is reddit not wanting to accept a shred of responsibility in admitting that blizzard fucked up in the first place on """multiple occasions""" and the players behaviour is the logical consequences of the environment provided which leads to players on the other faction fleeing the server. I don't understand how people don't get this.
---
it starts and ends with blizzard. end of story.
---
most of you whiny babies should just play on a pve realm. turn pvp on if you feel frisky.
---
I agree. Rude to tell people you “don’t care” like that. At least try to be nice about it.
---
Both suck though and that's the point?
---
100% wasnt a macro or autoclicker or anything. I have autorun keybound, thats literally the most automated thing on my UI.
---
Well good for you, sweety. Glad you had a laugh. I don’t PVP or grind or whatever it is so I don’t really know what it means to get a certain rank. If you don’t have to have any skill to achieve it I didn’t know that. I’m just defending someone’s right to live their life how they want, even if it involves toiling away for hours on something that becomes worthless eventually. My point is that we are here for a finite amount of time on this world, and we shouldn’t shame others for what brings them happiness.
---
Imagine playing Mage.
---
In all seriousness another awesome video from Pint! It's a Christmas miracle!
---
Glad you agree =)
---
Now go check the farming spots and cry. Actual bots did not go anywhere, still safe and sound.
---
YES FREE ME
---
Amen brother.  Can you imagine going from requiring 16 hours of afk a day for months to get highest rank vs 10 arena games a week for not that long to get highest rank?  Skill over time should always be rewarded and classic is the opposite.  
---
I'm fine with #nochanges and all but clearly the pvp system is awful and it hurts the replayability of classic.
---
good ole silky jhonston +1 from me
---
It used to be like that.
---
I'm going with Hunter because they're really the only class where everything stacks.
---
Caster classes tend to be forced into an either-or situation. While it's nice to be able to use both great heals and great nukes, you can only do one at a time. Similarly, melee classes tend to specialize in certain types of weapons. So you're wasting a lot of talent points on weapons you aren't currently using at any given time.
---
In contrast, virtually everything from all three Hunter trees stacks to benefit what you're doing anyway.
---
Just out of curiosity how long as these bots getting banned for?
---
There's plenty at my fire elementals in arathi.  I know.
---
Well my buddy doesn't even know if it was his fishing now, but I'm DEFINITELY not deleting this post because YoJansen will probably cum in his pants on the opportunity to call me out, based on how fucking giddy he got when the mods removed my shit the first time for "lack of flair" lol
---
Yes that i know, im a human and use 9% hit gear now that i got the dagger, should be hitcapped or is it better to switch out brigam girdle with muggers belt?
---
The picture is just to show how many there are. I've come across multiple of them farming the trolls, slimes, and wolves in the area. I took this screenshot shortly after using the lvl 53 to complete my slime quest.
---
Fury with sword spec and sweeping Strikes. Weapon swap to a fat 2hander for MS, swap for shield slam and full survivability of prot.
---
On heartseeker the market is so flooded the set is going for 85 or less.
---
Hit up social media as best you can
---
Got an addon list that you are willing to share?
---
Fury warriors have obsolete tier sets already, it doesn't stop them from going for weapons, rings etc.
---
No
---
Still smells nice.

1) DW fury/prot is far less than 1k dps.
---
2) Most DW fury prot abilities don’t have a threat mod, outside of the base mod you get from defensive stance *when* you actually use that. As fury/prot, part of the high dps comes from executing during the last 20%, which you can’t do in defensive. 
---
3) You lose tactical mastery in fury/prot so it’s generally not trivial to deal with mechanics like Rags knockback. You can FR cap, but then your threat goes in the toilet. Whereas a bear can just feral charge.
---
Thats what Mograine EU looks like every wednesday and sunday and then head gets turned in and it will lag so hard that animation and buff go out 20 minutes later and then people get disconnected and lose it again. 
---
We pay for this ...
---
Sounds like stuff someone would say who hasn't played vanilla.
---
The difference in t0 and t1 is much less than you think it is.
---
Yes this is the new honor system fix. You have to get bracket 14 but you have to do it only playing a max of 13 hours a day because at 14 hours a day you get banned for botting.
---
Healer or tank, but a bad fucking ass rogue or mage is pretty fucking useful.
---
How do you feel about playing cat dps, we're full on tanks at the moment, and possibly offtanking fights like gar and domo?  We're looking to fill up last couple spots, we raid mon, tue, thur 10p-1a pst,first raid is 01/02/2020, we have several people geared from our previous guild, more info here... also message me on discord Bossmage#7124 or via [bn](https://battle.net/)et bossmage#11451

---
But people didn't know if they rolled on a Horde or alliance minority, because unlike private servers Blizzard keeps all those stats hidden.
---
How come none of the other top rankers are being banned then? He cheated.. get fucked.
---
I use Blizzard raid frames and when properly set up they’re fantastic. Look in settings menu at the bottom and you’ll find raid profile settings there. Among other very useful options is one to show when someone has a debuff that your class can dispel (and ignores other debuffs so it’s super clean). That makes it easy to dispel - if you see the icon on a players bar just dispel.
---
I am in the same boat with you, my second account with just 40 mage got banned for half a year while my main account is safe and sound. 
---
People abusing reporting system plus high playing activity resulted in a wave of false bans, don’t take idiots here seriously.
---
yeah just like the horde do after wasting their time in a 20+ min que to get rolled hard by an alliance premade.  must be a blow to the ego when you realize you’re not any good at all lol
---
Do you have honor spy installed and updated regularly? I'm thinking thats what did it for me
---
you are not the only one here, mate - Got banned aswell for a reason i have never done
---
I do not use honour spy no. I’m noticing a lot of people all saying they were half afk in AV, but I didn’t even do that, I’m not going for ranking so honour spy would be useless for me.
---
hello, this sounds similar to what happened with us, 14 of us left a larger guild because we were unhappy and started our own guild, our first raid is 01/02/2020, roster is filling up quickly, we're semi-hardcore, late night 10p-1a pst, more questions you can message me on discord Bossmage#7124 or via [bn](https://battle.net/)et bossmage#11451   
---
check out this post for additional info  
---
How do you make premade AVs?
---
We've had zero Deathbringers, Viskags, BRE's, Spinal Reapers and only one OEB and one Mageblade. We've had terrible luck with weapons. But we did get an Eye of Sulfuras at least
---
Ayy my realmm -firebowlmon :D
---
Just save some money and get it eventually. Enchanting isn't a moneymaking profession atm (disenchanting is :D) so consider dropping it after you get it.   
---
The most expensive part of leveling enchanting is 250+ or something. It's quite cheap to get it to 200 at least.

Evaluate the Stat Values tab for your raid's needs, but you appear in good shape for both protec and attac with those options. I no longer use my SHotM.  
---
The Blacksmithing trinket Glimmering Mithril Insignia helps a bit with bear fear vulnerability.
---
To be fair
---
+ It more or less takes forever for Blizzard to ban anyone for anything in the first place
---
+ In the event Blizzard does 'reverse' a decision all impacted players generally get (relative to the loss due to ban) an insanely stupid amount of compensation
---
***
---
There is pretty much zero reason for the wider community to ever believe that a false-ban took place and in the event that it does happen the 'victims' always come out ahead anyway.
---
Lmaoooo
---
LMAO what a fucking waste of a perds
---
Mind providing a source for that? I see no mention of Slam, start/stopattack, or even macros in the "Not a bug" post.
---
Unlikely to ever change.
---
Is there an addon that adds a sort of LFG element to the game?
---
I know it's supposed to be classic but honestly LFG is just such a good QoL addition to the game..
---
But I generally like wpvp, and I still enjoy it on characters below 50.
---
Its just all these "pvp gods" who sits on all high lvl flightpaths all day every day that makes the game really annoying to play sometimes. Even the 15-20 fuckers roaming constantly in SG + the groups inside of BRM.
---
Its just a fucking joke how bad it has gotten
---
🦀🦀hotter is gone🦀🦀
---
So being a glorified chat room is what you think WoW should be about?
---
Literally anything can be fun with friends. Even work can be alright sometimes as long as you enjoy the company.
---
If your argument for why something is good is "I got a group of friends together and did it" then it's probably not actually good.
---
Amazing gameplay, thanks for sharing
---
iirc continuously denying the other faction player from playing is griefing and a bannable offense.
---
Scarlet Monastary and Stranglethorn Vale / shimmering flats / thousand needles.
---
Hmm im not sure then, hopefully whatever happened gets fixed
---
make a character with that name before you xfer
---
As long as one faction has 40 more people queueing than the other faction, they will have instant queue. This is 100% guaranteed with AV since you cannot group queue as a party so EVERYONE is solo queue (aka it does not complicate how queues work).
---
Well if we’re he to talk about lack of evidence lol
---
i dont get your point? whitemane is fairly balanced. besides that some people actually like a little danger in there leveling experience. you cant just say "roll a PVE server for best leveling experience" as an objective truth some people just dont see it that way.
---
The bot is playing for him. And I have done all those things but nothing has happened, also alot of people have started to get banned today. But he is still not banned.
---
Cauldron quests in WPL are repeatable.
---
Lol you’re not kidding. Ive seen multiple posts from hunters asking what the hell to do with all their tribute gold.
---
Helps if tanks are marked to hit them first.t
---
Seems like a familiar story I just read on a new account
---
Not all changes are bad, classic as a lot of awful things in it removed my retail. A lot of the issues Retail has is actually very recent problems.
---
This game is a prison and Blizzard will set you all free.
---
&gt;I didn’t bit btw
---
sounds like something a bitter would say, if I’ve learned anything from my time on the osrs subreddit you did in fact bot.
---
[Ramstein's Lightning Bolts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13515/ramsteins-lightning-bolts) is a good trinket for initial AoE threat in dungeons. Other than that, your set up looks great.
---
What server did you roll on? Thinking about trying out an alliance character.
---
wowclassicpopulation.com takes snapshots of people online but it works only if people contribute. Better than reading just the raid logs.
---
85% win rate in a premade actually sounds pretty bad.
---
How do you do a premade AV? You cant queue as a group...
---
I've seen a few false positives in the WoW subreddit, a few for Warframe and a whole load for OSRS/RS3. Always confirmed by staff, or as a result of the OP making an update thread. 
---
They legitimately happen, though are rare. I've personally been false positives on WoW too, but back in the days where you would ring them so it took 20mins to get it fixed Vs the days it'll take now that encourage social media outreach.
---
Why would he go into a pug for extra honor if hes getting 12 min wins? Very plausible statement.  Also, premades dont go into pugs to find people to ban. They dont give a fuck about people playing in pugs unless someone plays exceptional, and in that case they would be recommended into a premade. This guy is a joke lmao. Bet hes in 24/7 premades too.
---
u did thing I dont like, enjoy ur ban lmao, deserved
---
- you
---
This is your brain on Classic wow people.
---
Ah, the obscure botting software Glider that nobody has ever heard of and whose name should never be mentioned.
---
Akchually

6 months is fucking extreme too, its nuts
---
nice ui
---
suspected so, + ashbringer's lore is my favorite in vanilla wow

how active is it? do you get frequent casual "human" conversations or is it just silence and lfg like gandling? i really want to make friends
---
don't be that guy you'll get banned from his epic av group
---
The weapon order will only change once you press the Gear DPS button at the bottom. It takes a bit running simulations for each weapon, depending on how many simulations you have in the settings.
---
Being a retail baby I never knew much when I started classic,   On my hunter I never clicked on beast training until level 50 . I couldn’t figure out why my pet wasn’t taunting and I assumed it’d need to be a specific pet. ( kinda like retail ) needless to say it was a long journey to level 50.
---
Who uses consumables in PvE grounds Omegalul
---
I have multiple twitch vlogs of me actively playing, chat logs showing me whispering people, and plenty of other stuff that they choose to not look into.

Priest would be stupidly OP if we could spec into all 3 fully hahaha
---
Sorry Stacy bro’s only
---
Full of grown up men pretending to be someone else in a fairytale story and they will lash out if you do not play along.
---
The only fun world PvP I had in classic was before honor and BG's. I was questing with a couple of friends in Tarren Mill, doing the murloc quest. On the shore were already some alliance, but they weren't aggressive so we held our distance and tried to do the quest. For whatever reason one of us thought that they were going to attack us so he, literally, charged in. They were a couple of levels above ours so naturally they shredded us. We had a laugh, corpse ran back and thought nothing of it. But they kept attacking us afterwards. Some random horde join in, some random alliance join in. Couple of minutes later, our enemy and ourselves messaged our guild and all of a sudden it was all out war. About 20 horde and 20 alliance, all sorts of levels ranging from 20-60. It was a blast!
---
Now I didn't play anymore since honor released as that sucked the joy out of me even as horde on a relatively balanced realm.
---
when people finish ranking to 14 - they quit the game cause they're completely burned themselves out.
---
This has happened to multiple people as far as I'm aware. I'm sure they're getting a lot of tickets about it so hopefully it gets rectified soon for those of you affected.
---
thanks!
---
i think this is what i was looking for ! :D
---
btw do u know what addon is this guy using? https://www.twitch.tv/videos/521365521
---
i like his raid frames
---
That's like the officer who threatened that it isn't wise to pick fights with officers, because I made the suggestion we explore doing something about how tank gear is getting disenchanted instead of gearing offtanks for redundancy. Threatening to /gkick only works if I value your company...
---
Can't go wrong with occational conga lines and hoovys.
---
Dude. This game BY FAR brings out the most elitist dicks than any other game in history. It’s insane sometimes honestly
---
A lot of them are like that, cbf inviting dps wars.
---
yes the officer told us it was very important to dispel tanks and melee dps
---
Aw someone got banned for cross faction collusion. Wahhh. I cry for you a river of tears.
---
I have heard it 2, that there are invisible rabbits that track,trigger effects, supposedly thats one of those "work smart not hard" cases, its easyer to throw a effect on rabbit. For example in LoL atleast it used to be, that some  effects, towers and some other stuff was coded as minions. Towers was (still is? ) just a suited minion.
---
That's why they are doing the quest... For exp. And nothing in what you just said changes the fact that the mage doesn't have to accept his invite and he spat first. He was rude first.
---
Reminds me of the Jon Jones copypasta
---
If it was true - the entire horde on my server would be banned for camping searing gorge and menethil harbour 24/7 and other high-level locations on a daily basis as well. PVP on a pvp server has never been a bannable offence
---
Blizzard will cave and make it two weeks.
---
You're correct. Our druids are really good players though for sure (parse in the 80s-90s consistently). But my point is they are very viable as healers.
---
Aww, how could they do this to you precious... AND YOU ARE WELL KNOWN CELEBRITY TOO? Damn...
---
May be next time play the bg properly and don't get mass reported. You AFK'ers are the tumour on av matches on alliance side, you and your kind are the reasons I don't play AV anymore. Hope your ban stays permanent.
---
SSPVP3?
---
This is my server, I've been way for about 2 months (played launch) re-subbed to start leveling again after the wild first month and financial issues. I'm alliance, what do I do if the server dies? abandon my character?
---
If you were on track for rank 14 I’d say you were more than likely using a bot or account sharing. Sucks to suck, you won’t find much sympathy here.
---
They just got normal players.  It looks like an automated program went haywire while employees went home.  All the "bots" are still around.... if you had a \*box\* auto-following your main... you box got banned apparently.
---
BRD has some very expensive recipes on my server. Definitely worth running.
---
Suspiciously large amount of razorgore players in this screenshot.
---
Yo that's my realm! :D - Zenbai
---
To the people suggesting he was banned because a lot of people reported him - there have been numerous threads about entire servers reporting people on their server well known for botting over a period of months with nothing happening.
---
I'm highly doubting you just got randomly selected by people to get reported for cheating and then Blizzard did something.
---
95% of the time, more info comes out that clearly shows the OP not sharing all of the info.
---
Were you using a click program, something to click on your screen so you don't go afk?
---
If you plan on pvping alot at 60, don't pick horde unless you like waiting 25 min for a bg. That's not an exaggeration, either.
---
Deathbringer, CHT, Perditions, Spinal reaper, right bindning, eye of sulfaras. So yeah. 1 BRE, 2 OEB, 1 Vis'kag, 2 Brutality blades, 1 Gutgore. Not alot of rogue/warrior weapons dropping :(
---
They cheated too
---
Alliance "chokepoints" only works if Horde raid has combined IQ of 50.
---
Of course you cap SHGY in turtle, not doing so is stupid. The chokepoint is bad anyway: If you go to IW bunker, you will spawn behind Horde deathball. They can just pick people who comes from GY (or use mages and spawn camp). If Allies loose too many people, Horde will ride pass and get SP GY. Not to mention all stealthers can go pass IW bunker unless you have 4 spots flared all the time.
---
Bridge? Who the hell uses the bridge? There is 3 entrances to Alliance base. If Allies defends the bridge, Horde will use backdoor and cap GY. If Allies defends the backdoor, Horde will cap SP GY.
---
If there is no Wingdude or Ice Lord to summon, then suppose Allies could hold in base forever. But if one of those happens, Horde will just brute force in with NPC help.
---
Based on this: [wowclassic population last 14 days](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/overview?lastSeen=14) Noggenfogger is 90% alliance. Not sure how it's estimated though
---
Hunter
---
I have 5 box accounts, same pc, same account - 1 got banned.
---
ONE.
---
For "botting".  What was I honestly doing?  Using my hunter to level my boxes in dungeons... you know auto follow then pick up loot.
---
Your case is indeed interesting but they wouldn't be handing a 6month ban for something like that surely?  That is the nuclear option for them and its not like they don't have a lot of experience in this space.
---
Did they ban people for it last time?  during the queues?
---
What did I just watch..
---
ITT: Bads being mad.
---
i got it from a pug :( scenario 4 made me giggle tho
---
Anyone else sick of the "look at this roll" posts? I don't find them particularly interesting at all.
---
1.	Classic cast bars
---
2.	OmniCC
---
As a dagger rogue, I don't get new weapons from BWL. 
---
Looking through it, all I would get is 1 trinket, a neck and a backpiece.
---
How is camping one spot with murlocs any different from camping the entire searing gorge lol, why not just admit you have said a silly thing and stop being stubborn?
---
Lmfao I would actually love to see that, double karma
---
🦀🦀$11 btw🦀🦀
---
Alliance = 12 year olds and French people
---
Garbage tier mage.  You should be gkicked.
---
In retail you mean. There's no reason to scout people in classic BGs since you can't crossrealm...
---
I didn't play on a private server but it's been pointed out here that: private servers had a ton of bots, and the playerbase was generally spread out across multiple time zones, so some folks played at almost completely opposite times. Both of those factors speak to the high pops of pservers and how WPvP played out there.
---
Damn, that is a significant bummer.  All horde like that?
---
Yes, lets ban someone for botting because they did a completely different offense. Great idea.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Then that’s what you should have said as to why they were bots, not farming mobs. Huge difference there.
---
Blizzard isn't banning people based on playtime. If you think someone got banned for being logged in too often, then you're exactly the gullible person these posts are aimed at.
---
So what would a non-botter say? Would they just not complain and accept being banned for something they didnt do?
---
I’ve came across a few of their premades in AV and was so happy to see them since their premades were really good. Are they a private server guild?
---
sounds like alexrami
---
Cross realm BGs, so yes.
---
It pretty much does.
---
T0 isn't worth breaking until you have several pieces of T1, and even then its a very modest upgrade.
---
Sike! You thought!
---
Humans don't normally distribute their clicks and keypresses. "Picking a random millisecond" means using some pseudorandom number generator which draws from an algorithm that all but guarantees a normal distribution. 
---
It's harder than you think bud, doesn't mean Blizzard will put in the effort however.
---
Done like 10 runs without seeing a single OEB

It’s your own fault you rolled “tehgankzor” on rp realm and no one takes your joke ass seriously 😂😂

this isnt griefing, you're making shit up and what OP did isn't against the rules.
---
jesus christ reddit
---
based
---
Man that greatly bums me out.  I was horde back in vanilla, but if the PvP is as bad as it seems alliance may be the way to go.
---
If you're not leveled too high I would just reroll on another server
---
The stats difference between t0 and t1 is quite substantial, not factoring in the crit and hit chance some of the set items give.
---
I see you have some reading issues for real, show me where I said I was “camping one person for multiple hours”? I was literally standing at the same spot just killing approaching mages, they could’ve gone away, they could’ve asked for help, they could’ve brought their main character as well (and many of them did) - I had zero intention to harass any given person for hours, just leave my murlocs or fight for them with my resto druid lol. Imagine thinking they don’t have a 60 main - of course they do, but it’s not in horde mentality to have a fair battle so let’s instead just abuse the report system and click “cheating” because you know, there is no punishment for false reports anyway so you can report everyone and watch them get auto banned.
---
Most of them were actually self-balanced by the community, as private servers always have the current faction ratio publicized. So if people saw that alliance was 45% they would pick that faction when starting on the server. 
---
While Blizzard does everything they can to hide the player data.
---
And if the ratio got skewed too much, lets say 43/57 the private servers would just lock horde from creating characters on new accounts, until a new alliance character was created. To always maintain equilibrium. I never saw a vanilla pserver use such a system tho, as all the ones I played on were community balanced.
---
Alliance also usually dominated in organized PvP on pservers, since paladins are the strongest PvP healers, so they would often form 5 man wpvp squads. While horde has the advantage in small skirmishes like 1v1, or 2v2. And there were also different PvE metas which gave incentives to play both factions.
---
R14?  You were botting.
---
Wrong sub!
---
I love you.
---
Oh believe me, I have no desire to live in that fairytale and take things seriously there.
---
"Every breath I take without your permission increases my self-esteem!"

---
You mean transfer.
---
They are.
---
I have never ever been no changes, it's a streamer thing. I have proper grammar, so you can tell I'm neither a streamer or one of their zombies.
---
Sound like your regular internet moderator lmao
---
I doubt that very much, considering most servers are PvP.
---
&gt;My sub ran out 2 months ago.
---
Then why are you still subscribed to this sub?
---
I talked to a gm on the web messages thing and all he said was they werent overturning it because third party software was detected, but he couldnt clarify whether or not the software had to be running or just exist. I use Autohotkey in Path of exile but haven't played that in 6+ months so i have it installed but not running. They obviously didnt tell me if  it was AHK that triggered the ban or not but thats just all i can really assume at this point, You dont happen to use a Glorious mouse with their macro software do you?
---
I was also banned for third party program. I figured it was a false positive too, submitted a ticket and 3 minutes later they say it was legit. I'll escalate it too. I also have honor spy like you and also may have engaged in a few too many AFKs, but never used a 3pp to do it. Just played some league. I'd understand a penalty for AFK'ing, but I don't really understand why we're hit with a half year ban for this. Anyways, please escalate yours as well so hopefully they look into this.
---
Happened to a friend of mine too but BLAH BLAH U DESERVED IT YA RIGHT U WERE BOTTING.
---
Flamelash feels like a little village, community seems tighter then ever and it truly feels like 'everyone' knows each other. Even see the occassional ally roaming around.
---
There's no reason to use them as catch up if ZG and AQ20 are in the game.
---
Do you think they are going to open up account transfers? I have my healer and main on the same account because I lacked foresight and am hoping to move one off to a second account.
---
This also isn't WoW Classic for many reasons, a lot of which were stated by other comments.
---
That’s why I said more than likely you goof, of course there are legitimate players but the vast majority of people playing 18 hour days are not doing so legitimately.
---
First of all, dont go back to loot graves. Open them from top to bottom, and iceblock closer to stairs, After your nova, go to max range and start blizzard(if you got mana sustain int / spi gear, or druid healer with you), when the first mob gets close, use cone and kite the room in a semi circle, use the corners, IF you kite straight/diagonally like you did, you will get hit, ALOT.
---
LMAO LOOK AT THIS GUY. HE CANT EVEN COC IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WISH IF WHEN YOU DON'T THEN IF WHEN SHALL CHALLENGE BE SO AS THEN IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK TODAY IF I CAN SEE IT WAS 
---
LAMO GIT REAL
---
beat me to it lol
---
&gt; (parse in the 80s-90s consistently).
---
This is what I mean about gaming the meters, though. Parses are rated largely in comparison to others so there are ways to top meters without necessarily playing your class in the most ideal ways. I’m sure your Druids are good and they do have a role - but a niche one. A healers skill is determined in an analysis of skill usage in context of their healing assignment, overall raid performance on a fight, and gear level (and amount of and performance of other healers). Healing meters alone don’t tell you much more than the fact that your healer knows enough to know how to top them.
---
Nope, I use a basic wireless mouse that cost like 20$ and came with my shitty keyboard
---
The mistake was using a bot.
---
I read your post about your multibox shaman being banned. Genuinely curious-
---
Anything that would drastically set this account apart from the others to get picked up by the system in playstyle, addons, afking or other behavior?
---
Jump into PUGs. There are always guilds that need that one extra person. Most guilds will let you free roll too (other than the real stuff). You’ll likely get your t1, a weapon or so, and some accessories in 3-4 months as long as you get your lock out every week. That’s one longish day and one hour for ony every week.
---
why did i read the whole thing
---
The mistake was blizzard automating bans based on user reports.
---
Wait, so you did bot?
---
I remember that shit before they fixed it in old retail. Was not pleasant. When did they add the warning and timer?
---
They should, I'd bet 90% of the people that consistently get bracket14 every week are botting.
---
I’ve never experienced this. Perhaps a misbehaving addon. You could try disabling any that seem like they might hook into the map and see if it helps? Also ensure all your addons are up to date.
---
Some members of a big guild asked me to stop farming so much honor and I told them to get lost, so I suspect they reported me
---
Nah being sarcastic- who would bot with a resto shaman?
---
Every time I see a bot it's a BM hunter.
---
Wouldn't want to face a Lock with SL/SL and Ruin.
---
I’ve done a lot of things that are against TOS, been banned and always got my accounts back. From botting to exploiting and 7 day bans to perm want bans. 
---
Repeated calling and requesting your account back will eventually get your stuff back. 
---
It’s kinda like getting a 100$ speeding ticket; make it cost the court more than its worth and they throw it out.
---
Not necessarily, if they are a class that need their BIS ring for the vendor too. But if they dont care about that It would probably not be worth the effort.
---
I blame you
---
the fact you felt compelled to say this pretty much invalidates your claims.
---
Baseless assumption.
---
lmao couldnt tell, but yeah blizzard is fucking up right and left lately.
---
dead game
---
Parses are comparing them and their gear to other druids in similar gear. This tells me they are a good player as many people are trying to get 90+ in the parse for their respective class. 
---
Different than healing meters. 
---
I mean they do the most healing over the raid. Sure they use consumables. But they are pumping out heals and it is good for the raid. (they also decurse etc so they are doing other jobs - thorns, buffs, innervating priests sometimes, etc...)
---
You only need rank 2 for this fwiw. It’s very easy to get and very useful! Although it has a long 5min cool down.
---
Man this is such a joke. So much time wasted on my character just to lose it, and if i make another account its gonna get banned for the same unknown reason id assume.
---
Yeah sorry bud. Blizzard banned him because they detected a third party program playing the game for him. They investigate these accounts before banning them so they aren’t by mistake. Your buddy was botting.
---
Imp. renew only affects the base heal, not anything added by your +healing.
---
While it does do something, I think its just a waste of talent points.
---
I'd go for something like this if you wanna play it holy/shadow:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/-205151030300055-15305001015
---
If you dont want to nova, put the extra point in improved shadow range
---
You do have some inefficiencies: you don't get mana regen from spirit until BWL, so your spirit affecting your spellpower isnt as strong as it could be.
---
Also, keeping mana up might become an issue (maybe not if you drink pots and runes on CD,)
---
If you want a build that can basically heal and apply SW, i'd say you should go for something like 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/50023012-2050500303-15305001005
---
Cba to do math on Inner Focus / Meditation / Improved Healing, but there arent enough skill points for all of them
---
&gt;This is the exact reason that league of legends became so bad in the lower ranks. Everyone yelling about how everyone else is throwing the game not noticing they are 2-9 in lane.
---
If you think League of Legends has it bad, try looking how angry people can get in DOTA 2 or Rainbow6 Siege. In DOTA's case, it's even worse because of how games can snowball much harder, and because how much higher the skill floor is compared to other MOBAs. Not to mention how in both DOTA and R6, you can actually grief teammates directly by getting them killed, i.e. Tiny Airlines in DOTA, and teamkilling people in R6.
---
Banned until 7/01/2020? Wow classic will be over by then.
---
There have been numerous instances of people getting report spammed and temp banned. They send them out in waves, but if you have a ton of reports on record they typically wont investigate further.
---
Yes- but then again you’ll have to respec PvP regardless of the class. It’s worth the respec once you have the gear. You will destroy.
---
Ooh thanks for this. I have a macro that’s been driving me nuts, works fine with alt as the modifier. But I want shift and that doesn’t work. Not able to check right now but I’m sure it’s a conflict with an existing keybind.
---
Yeah im gonna keep escalating it if they deny my appeal, im just fucking angry that I even have to do this
---
They changed the rules, you can name private servers here on this sub now, as long as they are historical servers and not ongoing ones ;) Kronos III
---
Yeah, wasn't this done on a pserver? Warrior was obviously best.
---
why do all the people that make wow pvp vids have TERRIBLE taste in music?
---
Mark of the chosen is great for druid tanks. Smoking heart of the mountain is what you want until BWL tho (Drake fang talisman) which granted provides little mitigation (1% dodge) but the threat bonus is huge. (56 atk power and 2% hit)
---
Personally I have mark of tyranny and smoking heart and I will be switching the smoking mountain for the drake fang talisman for most situations once I get one. ofc will keep the mitigation option tho
---
our first strikers mark dropped when we were still brining in pugs...
---
a pug won the roll -.--
---
Ah so they would just log out? Interesting! A smart programming idea.
---
I feel like a bunch of low level Horde players aren't the target audience for a quote from a speed-leveling Alliance player.
---
So which of these players is you?
---
https://i.imgur.com/h5iyw2y.png
---
&gt; However mageblade will benefit the raid equally going to a healer.
---
I don't think so. +1 healing is worth less than +1 spellpower and that is reflected in item budgets. It benefits the raid when a paladin gets it, but not as much as it benefits the raid when a mage or warlock does. Especially at this point in progression where healing is easy and more DPS helps clear times.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
I honestly wouldn't either unless I had been on this subreddit a few months (?) Ago. It was a big deal here when it happened. It was interesting to watch otherwise haha
---
Just pointing out they have no way to control their premades in reality, seems that many of them simply don't understand that fact.
---
All you have to do is use an alias on the discord server and you can join their groups and leech off of them with a 60% mount.
---
They legitimately get mad at things going on and check discord for anyone they are mad at who might happen to be using a true discord name.  It's pretty sad/funny.
---
If it's just a kill quest then why shouldn't he get an invite? That's just fucking rude and there's no need to be an egregious "bad ass" because you think sharing is tough or unnecessary. It takes 5 seconds to click accept, kill the mob and everyone moves on. What a douche.
---
Build Arcanite Reaper. It’ll last until you get the 2h axe off of Rag.
---
Maybe decursing? :p
---
It's not his podcast. He just appeared on it, mostly so the hosts could rip on him for being clueless.

The stream is run by North, GM of &lt;Grizzly&gt;, whom I presume you *have* heard of.

Ds/ruin is probably better for 5 mans and pve raids. Sm/ruin works well for pvp and pve raids. 
---
I pvp, pve and farm as ds/ruin
---
Definitely have! Where does one listen? Why isn't this posted on realm forums?
---
I wish man, I’m about 400g short
---
Yeah it is sketchy handing a bunch of expensive mats to a random player and having to hope they don't scam you.
---
When I need an expensive craft, I don't even trust to ask in trade "LF xyz".  I'd much rather wait and watch for someone to advertise what I'm looking for.
---
I put more trust into someone who is consistently advertising in trade, rather than a whisper from a random player after I say "LF enchant".
---
Just way to easy for people to take advantage of the situation, and unfortunately there are people who will.
---
Sorry it happened to you.  Hopefully Blizz can help you and reprimand the guy.
---
Have you got gold? You can pay decent guilds to carry you through and buy the drops you want.
---
Play wsg and move on
---
Same thing happened to me. DoubleBubble on Blaeux.
---
Never botted in my life. Blizzard won't tell me when, where or how I was botting.
---
What can we do????????????
---
im on horde, and yes there is
---
Paladin or priest. You cant kill them.
---
Nope.
---
You've already said more than I know and I know about him.. lol
---
Right on! I recently found that weapon on wowhead. I’ll start farming emp now.
---
Thanks for taking the time to share!
---
It is really good for big guilds as well. We are building our second raid team. It doesn't matter who plays when on which team, they can always get items.
---
It's fantastic to see all these honor leechers and AFKers getting banned. Love it
---
Druids are not a meme class. Balance is a memespec in pve, not pvp. Druids are really good in pvp.
---
That's a 10/10 dick move. Thank you for the idea. Good to pair it with fear.
---
I've heard different but similar, something like a_cute_bunny.filename was the first placeholder they saw.
---
The problem with that sentiment is that it goes both ways.  If an alliance player is a coward for transferring off an unbalanced server because " a higher enemy pop just means More to slay," then EVERY horde player who had the chance to transfer to an alliance favored server (which would likely be Heartseeker) is a coward for abusing their advantage instead of transferring to slay more members of the enemy faction.
---
Yeah we have DKP with exceptions. 
---
for example: Tank prio items, MS &gt; OS, Weapons go for melees over hunters. Stuff like that.
---
works fine for me, have  you updated?
---
But shadow is your MS lol, you're just filling for the dungeon. If he wants to have that item to himself he should put it's reserved in the title
---
On the flipside I see tanks spamming "all orbs reserved" for 2 hours, while runs looking for a tank with round robin generally aren't looking for more than 15 minutes.
---
That is basically how much you have to play if you want rank 14 on some servers.
---
I’m still not sure if the person in the screenshot is being serious or not. Can never trust these things haha
---
That's me playing. I suck. That's all
---
No honestly I'm a really bad player and my fiance loves the game. I'm trying to get better but I do stupid stupid (stupid) things. I'm laughing at some of these because I totally follow my fiance on run when we're questing and am generally lazy until I have to kill something. I laugh because all the gf-fiances-bf that are playing for their significant others mostly are going to be kicked lol. I like the game honestly it's a blast but sometimes too much of a good thing. We played like 14 hrs a day this weekend (his choice of activity which I dont mind). I'm surprised my character isn't banned. Come to think of it I had two or three whispers that I responded too about sm cath (40 mg) so maybe I dodged a bullet by responding to it?? Go figure.
---
what’s the gold limit out of curiosity
---
Thank you, I'll try that out!
---
People who blame one faction are just /r/iamverysmart people 99% of the time.
---
Step 1: See someone blame the creators of the game for something happening in the game. Since, you know, they are the ones in charge of it. Obvious logical step
---
Step 2: Tell yourself, "I'm smarter than these people, so I shall take the opposite position. Not only is not not Blizzard's fault, it is YOUR fault instead!"
---
30 minute games are your best Rep per hour. A typical 30 minute win gives between 800-1000 rep.
---
You're absolutely overthinking it. Leveling now just means the random white items you list on the ah are gonna sell for lots of gold now that everyone has money
---
Addons can never get you banned
---
I feel you there. Adulting sucks :(
---
You have time to run up and clear SM cath once and that's as a Warrior with a 60% mount. A better class could probably clear it twice at least especially with an epic to get there quicker.
---
imagine min maxing in classic
---
Top kek
---
Leveling easier than it ever has been. Most of the time pretty peaceful. I can be harder to find groups for the harder elite quests outside of peak though.
---
The Windwall of Yasuo actually teleported spells outside the map and had it hit invisible minions for some reason. Also the Nexus destruction is hardcoded in such a way that it is impossible to take the 50 gold it gives you on destruction away.
---
You realize you look like an idiot having typed this out, right?
---
Never reveal your rolling for OS. Makes winning stuff way more entertainin.
---
Harder than MC but not “hard”
---
My vanilla guild was very mediocre (never killed anything past the first boss or two of AQ40, maybe Instructor in Naxx?) and we farmed BWL in one night a week. Everything you need to win is out there in 15 year old YouTube videos. It really shouldn’t be troublesome with how guilds are facerolling Classic MC in blues and greens and giving no fucks about fire resist. AQ is when I would expect there to be the first actual roadblocks, but maybe I’ll be surprised there, too.
---
Out of all those choose Ashbringer. Stay far away from Noggenfogger and Flamelash. Dreadmist and Stonespire are just as alive as Gandling.  
---
Honorable mention should go to Golemagg too.
---
Level herbalism and do lashers in dme, better gold, and not as unforgiving if you u fuck up once
---
They were/are both extremely high-pop servers.  Herod was #3 in all regions only behind the "streamer" server Faerlina and another one I forget.  Stalaag was #4 or #5 if I recall correctly.
---
So they're super high pop, which means you see the players from these servers more often than others.  Doesn't mean they have a higher % of assholes on those servers, you're just seeing more assholes from these servers because you're seeing more people from these servers overall.
---
As someone who had to take a month break after levelling to 48 your making me not want to come back :( this sucks
---
&gt;  burned out rerolling since our mains had almost full raid gear by then..
---
With paid transfers open, sounds like it's a good time to get back in it.
---
Blizzard is out here saving lives. Ban them all
---
Oh, thank you!  That makes all the difference.

Have your friend do this, he can be to you within 10 minutes or less

&gt; Imp. renew only affects the base heal, not anything added by your +healing.
---
People like this always make me laugh, like their way of playing is the right way and everyone else is just a filthy casual. I would just like to know this guy’s opinion of me playing WoW completely stoned not knowing where the fuck I am half the time.
---
and 15% dmg from shadowform, 15% physical dmg reduction, and power infusion, and spirit of redemption.. basically the 3 big thing for pvp.
---
I thought that’s why they got Vulf banned from the premade discord’s.
---
You can only have one set of gear at a time, and you can only cast one spell/use one ability at a time. Therefore, the more "pure" your class is, and the more similar the functions and methods of the specs are, the more they will compliment each other. The obvious winners are Warriors=rogues&gt;priests&gt;hunters.  
---
Warrior: Aside from the weapon-type spesific talents (which includes the general 2h dmg talent, OH dmg talent, and 1h dmg talent as well), every talent the warrior takes makes them better at their job, no matter the circumstance. Especially the fury tree seems to also be amazing for supporting a 2h build, or a tank build. With the weapons/shields being the proportionally biggest aspect of their gear, out of any class, and gear for different roles having more overlap than hybrids, they can take advantage of weapon-swap, and switch between DPS and tanking better than the hybrid tanks.
---
Rogues have much of the same story. Many talents in all trees would be nice additions to any other spec. Their limitation of energy means they can't take advantage of all the talents, as some abilities will be disfavored compared to others, but overall, a great boost.
---
With 2 trees that boost their capabilities of being a healer, priests would be the undisputed best healers in the game. Attempts at doing PVE damage would not be boosted that much, but the increased versatility might improve their relative standing in PVP.
---
For hunters, The survival tree isn't great in PVE, and not top-of-the-line amazing in PVP either, so in total, their boost is less than the melee DPS'. Still, the BM tree is full of amazing talents that used to have too high opportunity cost to take. In the hands of somebody actively controlling their pet, there are many big gains to be made here, that were unavailable before.
---
Mages and warlocks both suffer from talents only affecting one school or type of spells, and having opportunity costs tied to each spellcast, wasting a lot of talents. Mages go deeper into arcane for some nice school non-spesific talents, and warlocks get demonology buffs, but neither is getting full advantage of all their trees.
---
The hybrids all need different gear for different roles, and need to specialize, with the additional talents only supplementing their main role, only getting a few extra talent points that they actually use effectively. (However, Elemental shamans end up with mana tide, finally solving their Achilles heel of mana issues, which alone would make them more than viable in the current environment, but few of the other talents help them that much, and they would fall far behind in a world where everybody has maxed out trees.)  
---
If you wanted to balance around full talent trees, one way would be to allow swapping gear mid-combat, to allow hybrids to switch roles on the fly.
---
Literally all of the major mobile MMOs kids play these days have auto-afk features that allow you to just bot the whole game including dungeons and raids.
---
Black Desert Online has auto-afk activities like afk fishing, process goods, run across the world automatically.  This actually helps you make money and progress your character in more ways than one.
---
In general I think this kind of thing is a good thing because most people really can’t sit around gaming all day long to keep up with people with no lives who grind all day. I don’t think vidya should punish you for having a life and a job.
---
Honestly I'm playing on shazzrah which has a large horde majority and I have yet to see a single alliance player that did not KoS me.
---
It doesn't work that way.... If you got banned for botting, innocent or not, it's not due to massreports
---
I love Monolith, thanks /u/Roeshambo11 
---
The issue I have is that even though I am a guild officer, master looter and raid leader, no loot is showing in the Loot History page. I know this is user error but what am I doing wrong please?
---
We still want lower pop caps. That’s the main issue here.
---
I mean you aren't wrong about the economy and pvp, the other points mean basically nothing. You should mention those nstead of just saying "anti social" which doesn't really have a point against or for multiboxing.
---
Great! Thanks man.
---
If I remember correctly it damn near puts you down to trial status, can't send group invites, can't send Bnet invites, can't send mail, can't talk in any channels, you can however talk to current Bnet friends, but anyone outside your friend's list you're limited to emotes
---
Gotta be careful because 48 hours is a second offense ban, first one is 24, second is 48, and third is perma-silence or just a flat out ban, so you must of been dropping some hard Rs or something in order to get a second offense silence.
---
That’s because he’s a genetic freak
---
What's your fav fashwave song?
---
Have you added anything to the loot history? It would only appear there if you award loot through the award window through either the /dkp bid interface or the /dkp award [item link] command
---
It's all fun and games until retards like Red Text and 4 of his friends are mods of the subreddit.
---
Ill agree a bit with the below.  I think daggers are more ideal, as it's easy to get the weapon skill. But being able to do either is also good.  There is only one epic axe drop and it's a 6% drop rate, but there are two dagger drops.
---
Depends on what classes can get training.  Dun Morogh to Night Elf lands is a quicker shortcut.
---
The fact that you respond to EVERY comment in this thread and the way you respond to them makes me highly suspect that you used a bot or a keyboard macro some sort that justifies the ban fully.   
---
I've seen so many posts in here and retail wow subreddit where people claim they did nothing wrong after getting banned. People page community managers by doing u / username and try to help. 99% of the cases ends up bans being rightful after further investigation. you project the textbook passive-aggressive attitude those botters/gold buyers do too, telling people stuff like "but you forgot the part where i didn't bot" etc.   
---
Every single time, they blame the automated report/punishment system too. For cheating specifically, you don't get banned because some random people decided to mass report you in AV. Blizzard has a cheat detection system called Warden, which does memory scans on your PC while you're playing one of their games, and checks if you are using any suspicious 3rd party software, and flags your account for cheating if you do to hand out a ban in the future. Does it get false positives? Yeah sure. But it has been refined so much over the years, the rate of false positives is pretty low.  
---
Even if you are one of the false positives and your ban gets overturned, it just puts you in the 1% or whatever that low amount of percentile is of false positives.
---
Yes it does
---
Damn, no. We've just been using the standard Master looter interface. I knew it was user error, thanks muchly.
---
I'm sorry, but how the fuck can you say? "The gm literally said "you have a high activity log" thats the only evidence  they have againsst him." I'm not saying that he's innocent or not, but GMs don't got any clue about it, so they wouldn't know what evidence they had on it, hence why it would get sent to the specialist team....
---
Don't be the guy in red right?
---
ITT: Botters.
---
I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more Frostbolt.
---
It's not *too* late, it's a lot more top heavy with players at 60 now compared to three months ago.
---
It's harder to find groups for lower level dungeons and elite quests (plus some end-game dungeons) than it as before but it doesn't mean that there are absolutely zero people doing those, just that the inital wave has passed.
---
Even trying to find
---
That has nothing to do with your shit. We are here discuss you using two accounts to PLAY BOTH HORDE AND ALLIANCE on a PVP realm.
---
Frost mages with 3/3 permafrost
---
"Ok lol"
---
Guys you have no idea how wild it is going to other game subs for the first time and like, the devs and support team all being there and actually talking with you directly and giving feedback on situations. In fact this might be the *only* game where the devs and CS hold so much contempt for us and actively go out of their way to let people grief us and ignore our attempts to resolve it.
---
It is if you are playing alliance and horde at the same time to grief people from your farming spots
---
Depends on your race
---
They wrote the code to make it near impossible with the No ChAnGeS updates they did to stabilize the ground hunters could have. My best guess based off my Mara runs is 5 set GS, max armor and nature res on pet, nature aspect, and move speed enchant to boots with trinkets for dodgy moments may get the job you’re looking for done. Problem is the amount of micromanaging it will take probably makes that strategy impossible. Inevitably you’ll take aggro and she will run you down or your pet will hold aggro but get walloped by her before you can burn. A build like that may make 50-75% of the fight better, but you’ll be in a solo kite off for the last half to quarter.
---
Seconded, you old school unsouled?
---
Haha the horde on Skeram are toxic even to each other! That’s awesome, sounds like you were all made for each other.
---
You shouldn't be oom ever if you're down ranking properly, especially in 5 man's.
---
Where does it say that in the ToS?
---
True, back in vanilla we relied on the server forums to call people out, and it was always by name, and it was taken seriously. Server discords seem like the new best place to call out baddies.
---
On our server people seem much more open to know why somebody was blacklisted, i.e. the whole story, not just blacklisting people willy nilly.
---
Look at the screenshot maybe? fucking read it?
---
Wing: Cathedral.
---
Sell greens and blues. If you have enchanting, DE the blues from bosses, because Small Radiant Shards are worth ~2 gold. Make bandages out of the silk for more money. You can also try selling stuff on the AH if the rates are worth it.
---
Fee: 1-5 gold per run. 3+ might be kind of greedy considering warriors are much slower than mages, but if people are willing to pay that much for your service there is nothing greedy or wrong about it. Test the waters. 
---
Rules: you get all the loot, put it on FFA. If someone is interested in a loot drop, they can buy it from you for the vendor price.
---
Tips: give shamans a discount or make it free for them if they agree to lay down WF, perhaps some heals if necessary. 
---
Players can either stay by the gate and get exp or help you out.
---
Am I the only one upset this guy was going to snipe Domo and Rag from a Pug? I get it you got screwed. So you screw over the pug? If this is how you treat people may be this is karma?

---
Put up curse of shadows and corruption only. On some trash dont even bother with casting corruption. 
---
COS -&gt; CORR -&gt; Shadow bolt x100
---
Mage can solo like 8-10 mobs at a time with two spells. That’s pretty brain dead mate.
---
if u cant play on weekends ur not getting any no life shit anyway...
---
World health organization
---
If you were hitting, eat shit and die.
---
It will be far harder but not impossible. Do your research on a REALLY good server for your faction choice and play-style like others suggested. You’ll find a lot of guilds are rounding out their first and second teams and pretty soon raiding will be harder to get into for up and comers.
---
At later levels? cuz so far all I've got for AoE is arcane pulse and frost nova.. 10 shots of those and I'm oom, if not dead.
---
I made a druid I really want to be a healer but I will be feral when solo questing. I'm looking for help on building a talent tree that I can heal dungeons with while still being able to solo down mobs while questing. Thanks
---
no way we're getting world pvp back to where it was for those glorious 2 weeks. and ya i hated parts of it when none of my friends were on or my pug group would start wintrading, but still it was the peak of classic and it looks like its not comin back
---
unsubscribe and move on more like it
---
Nice to see a name from Kronos :)
---
Yeah this is the way
---
What level are you?  Once you get 22-24 it’s pretty safe to aoe. Below that just frost bolt and shit dies.
---
19 :l
---
The funny part is that I actually think you believe this.  Meta going off the rails for alliance last couple days.  I'm at 27k honor today after 4 games lol.  I've heard you guys are losing most of the time even in your premades now.  I just hope you don't actually expect us to cooperate.
---
Apparently you already lose Bonus loot if you aggro the guards and then exit the fight (I. E feint death).
---
I see you are alliance. If you have mostly human warriors you will have axe options of Crul'shorukh (Nef axe) and Dooms edge (trash). Ashkhandi is also generally considered a hunter's weapon these days. Barb of the Sand Reaver in AQ40 is also pretty much exclusively hunter. Also ZG offhand sword and dagger are BiS for phase 4 for hunters I believe. 
---
I think if it's going to be swung **in raid**, the weapon is better used by melee. Hunter's are one of the lowest scaling classes. You passing on weapons for someone going to swing them will almost definitely be better for the raid.
---
How dumb are you? Do you have a hard time reading? 
---
I clearly read it but you clearly didn't my comment. GMs isn't the one with the fucking evidence, how hard is that to understand? They can see that you have logged on often yes, but they aren't the ones with the tool to detect bots and such. Hence why he sends it to the specialist team, but you seem to dense to understand it
---
I kinda hope that the ban remains now
---
There's no such thing as being "behind" in Classic aside from whatever standard you or your friends who play the game are setting for yourselves. There are plenty of people at all parts of the levelling process, whether they be people leveling their first character like you or people leveling alts, so you're not going to be lacking people to quest or run dungeons with, even if there aren't as many people leveling now as there were in the first month or two after release. If you're worried about falling behind in raids, that's not really a thing in Classic either unless, again, you're trying to be super hardcore. Guilds are still going to be running Molten Core for the entirety of Classic, to gear up alts and to get legendaries.
---
I always wondered why people looted dead alli/horde. Where exactly do you turn those items in? I'm alliance btw. Isn't it better to stay in the action intead of hearthing all the way back to base to turn those in? Sorry im new to AV.
---
Yah the physical dog reduction is pretty huge
---
Personally why I don't mind people reserving 1 item in a dungeon. Save a lot of hassle negotiating with every class that can roll on it. I don't blame him for not wanting to roll against me, but if he aint reserving then since it's a 5 man it's fair game. I need so I need.
---
Maintain distance from mobs with slows/frost nova - try not to let it melee you at all.
---
A lot of legitimate people got falsely banned today, and not even pvpers.  Blizzard fucked this one up bad.
---
It’s not hurting the people abusing the system at all, only the people not abusing it.
---
So it’s more like they’re shooting us in the foot to shoot you in the head and taking all of our shit.
---
They were pretty elitist while on Stalagg, i wish you luck friend
---
in the 1% baby yeehaw after my appeal gets accepted y'all are gonna see ur wrongness
---
Any chance you feel like tossing that info this way in a dm? Been looking for the info all night after going 0/6 tonight, just starting. Have epic mount, don’t desert, competent, team player.
---
wasnt there a hunter streamer on stallag, Ahmpy or something? where did he go? one of the better stalagg guilds on alliance just transferred to my server grobbulus
---
A dude that got false flag banned on a server with an already dwindling alliance population lmao. I only brought up the stream / people knowing me because there are people that can vouch that iv been playing, not botting.
---
They joined a new game like 4 min later.
---
40 dates in 30 days?
---
I’m a hunter main and, honestly, I’d be giving Brut  Blades and CHT to alts before hunter. It’s the slightest bit of AP and not necessary at all.
---
The mage was there to grind xp and gold, then some random guy showed up and demanded an invite to his party, which would be 50% decrease to both of those. And when the mage didn’t send an invite, which would have only resulted in a net loss for him, the random guy spat on the mage. 
---
But somehow the mage is the rude one?
---
Invis pots aren't the end all be all. 
---
Don't pop one P2 though. There's no true agro gain table and she will target you either going out of invis or before P3. If you want to lose threat get classes without an agro drop mechanic to stack for a hit. Works REALLY well. 
---
Use it when she touches down so tanks aren't playing wackamole with mages/locks/warriors.
---
Thoughts on the 30 agility in phase 3? Each hand gets 15 for pretty cheap.
---
Nope

Grobb is easily the best server from both a community and balance perspective.
---
Try like me, utterly sober and not knowing where the fuck I am half the time. But, I can bet like you.. we're having the time of our lives, yeah?
---
This is the way.
---
Ah, yeah. That is pretty big. Still hunters aren’t really there for their dps. They’re there to handle certain mechanics (in MC: tranq shot). I’d still be willing to let hunters (and myself) suffice with the 25 Agi 2h enchant.
---
You sound salty as fuck that classic PVP meta is completely botched and people are done with MC lol.
---
Jesus calm the fuck down gatekeeper.
---
I mean. That's why I rolled warrior lol
---
Honor decay increase (that can lock out top ranks) and a blanket nerf to Vendor Prices, Rep and xp, like 1.5% per 1% over a 55/45 imbalance for the entire faction, with free faction transfers to unbalanced realms.
---
There is no incentive, you’re right. They need to create one.
---
I mean was there any other solution to not letting paid transfers happen when they did??
---
It just seems like it was that, or watch people quit or less likely, just reroll.
---
The community is mostly at fault here, not really Blizzard.
---
He probably botted.
---
If he didn’t, cool hope for the best.
---
But we don’t care and don’t post about it. Let blizz work it out
---
I am playing 20 hours a day, just becuase you have will power of a rock doesn't mean everyone else does. Sleeping for 4 hours a night with 2 naps during the day is normal for some people who work jobs that require time commitments like that. Just because your mentally weak as piss does not mean everyone else is.
---
Actually Horde top PvE guilds would not transfer materials at vendor price. If they do someone could AH snipe it and resell on Horde AH.
---
Alliance alt would sell some junk grey item and Horde guild banker would buy it for ridiculous amount of gold.
---
Either way lot of gold would be lost to greedy goblin auctioneers cuts, so they better start farming thouse reputations now.
---
P. S. I wonder if some Troll rogues gonna try to kill that Alliance bank alt and snipe AH meanwhile.
---
Yeah. I doubt I'll be able to get one on my pally when he hits 51
---
Glad too see racist / bigot offenders being punish ty blizzard it’s 2020 no time for childish bull 💜👌
---
A few objective answers vs. one subjective one is not in any way comparable to this question.
---
t. malding ally that got killed in brm once
---

---
Nice music, smooth gameplay :)
---
Yea its insane right, its not like when enough people report you for spam and you get auto silenced for a month. That never happens right lmao.
---
Are you one of the cunts that got banned? You sound like it.
---
Don't remind me...
---
I'm only in the late 20s - still a lot of people around.
---
Holy fuck people in this thread are fucking stupid and blinded by all this BiS list bullshit
---
If you are in an PvE Guild only, then its acceptable to give ony head to melees first.
---
However if you're in any decent guild that values both PvP/PvE and the wishes of her guildmembers, then casters have the same right on the head as any other class. The Ring is the best PvP ring you can get right now, its fucking BiS (god I hate this word).
---
However you should clear beforehand if you gear for PvP or PvE, you can't expect to get loot for both.
---
He was reserving, he just fucked up communicating that.  Should definitely have been asked before inviting you.  That said I kind of agree with his point.  I also kind of don’t.  Lots of things in wow etiquette that both sides are kind of right on.
---
This is what I also remember from my BC days as a hunter, grinding that loyalty up takes a couple days, so if they are rank 6 it takes quite awhile for them to downrank back to loyalty 1.Like, you would have to kill the pet continuously for at least 8 straight hours.
---
Sulfuras will be fine.  We have a much healthier alliance population than Stalagg ever did and we won't stand for Grizzly's shenanigans.  If they try stirring up any trouble we will tear them apart until there's nothing but bones left.  It also helps that a coordinated effort took place in anticipation of their arrival to reserve their guild name and the names of all their top players, to be relinquished only upon receipt of hefty payment.  They think they're tough?  They have no idea what they're about to walk into.
---
I just got deathbringer in ony tonight which puts me in a tough situation. Its a little slow for sword and board, but im worried about being too squishy if i go for the 9% build and go fury prot. I think i need to bite the bullet and farm edgemasters so i can wear more mitigation gear.
---
People loot corpses then don't turn them in. And it pisses me off bc I'm trying to loot them just to turn them in
---
Can confirm it as dual boxer. I had lvl 60 druid, but desided to reroll to PvE server in mid of phase 2 pre BG massacre. Being able to level 2 characters at once, buffs utility and heals from my 2nd character made it worth another 13€
---
I totally understand a shadow user not wanting priests to roll on offspec items. If you want OS only join if you can roll or look for a team without anyone who needs
---
W H Omegalul?!?!
---
&gt;it's always been their main goal to leave the general population unbothered as to not be noticed
---
Lmao.
---
It's cute when people can't accept personal responsibility.
---
The pvp system is not just about nolifers...
---
Sounds like you just don't like the game.
---
In that case you are mentally impaired -congratulations.
---
GMs aren't the ones that handle the bans you walnut. Hence why the GM will forward it to the team that does
---
The real MVP!
---
Found the Stallag Horde.
---
People keep saying this but it's not against the rules at all.....
---
Where did this happen and what was his name?  Just curious as an aoe frost mage.  🤔🤔🤔
---
&gt; We pay for this ..
---
Mograine is one of the highest pop realm, especially at horde side. Blizz gave you chance to transfer to lower pop for several months. I was playing an alt on Mograine a while ago when transfers were still a thing, and the lag in Ogrimmar was unbearable. Don’t only blame blizz for problem people have created for themselves.
---
But Lok doesnt have 25 agi lol
---
if it had 25g it would be amazing with ~2.5% crit and 50 ap
---
Sell all the things!! need mah epic mount.
---
U always producing some quality m8
---
I wonder if sharing accounts to farm honor counts as botting. Also dishonest, but maybe harder to detect?
---
Yes, but it turns red (if you are wearing it) until you re-level to 245. Same with harm belt, para cloak, all that. 
---
If you mean does it keep "Concentration" or "Arcane Wrath", yes, those don't change, but it acts like un-repaired armor until you get the Eng level back up.
---
Off tank stands with MT, but he moves out like melee does on the knockback.
---
Flames don't hurt much, the problem is that they burn mana to people nearby. So you need to quickly gather them and drag them away from healers. Every warrior should be ready to equip shield and aoe taunt and drag them away from healers.
---
Pretty cringe
---
you are so brave
---
While levelling you can still heal dungeons in feral spec. Just make sure you have a set of int gear with you. I'm pretty sure you can heal dungeons up to black rock depths doing this.
---
Here's hoping the honor in AV gets nerfed into the ground so players like this get crushed.
---
I don't care for AV, it's boring just to run past everyone, it feels like PVE all over again. Much rather enjoy AB/WSG, where it actually takes coordination and ACTUAL P V P to win.
---
more proof that WoW is literally just a fancy wc3 custom map
---
If you played all the healers in your raid you wouldn't do that good, that's my point. I never said you were bad.
---
Just saw ours tonight
---
Warlock legs from rag :(
---
And its BiS??
---
It falls under something else in the ToS - account sharing. Very much bannable.
---
We had 3 people on our realm who were top honor farmers get hit by the banhammer for account sharing.
---
howd you find the people to sell to?
---
How do you actually know you are server 1st without the achievement thingie they have on retail?
---
I don't understand. How do I make sure this never happens to our guild? Only have a trusted person make the raid and then enter?
---
That is the best answer imho.  I know you can talk about fair, but from a design point, does there exist a mechanism in game to solve this?  Yes.  It is called waiting 7 days.  Bummer... but that is how the game works.  The extension of customer service is nice, sure , but that is costing someone’s time.  Maybe an hour?  To make a spreadsheet, compare the raid ID, remove the wrong entries. In the database.  Update the database... prolly gonna have to open up the department shared drive for access to the raid reset power shell script folder.  ... or you could just tell 40 people to take a chill pill, relax and go do something else.
---
Dedication!
---
THEY’RE OUTNUMBERED 15 TO ONE, AND THE BATTLE'S BEGUN
---
WRONG
---
Please don't bully our friendly Russian multiboxer, very rude of you
---
I've leveled my mage from 44 to 48/49 through soloing the ZF graveyard, for how long does it remain the best xp/hr? I've heard that maraudon becomes better at some point, but I've also heard to just stick to ZF until BRD.
---
The funniest thing about this trolling is not only you can't form a cross-realm party you are competing with the other players in your server in this honor system therefore after some point they will be enemies to each other. Quite a drama.
---
Outside of humans, Quel'Serrar isn't even a particularly good weapon for tanking, nor is it worth the cost. Not only are you buying the book, you also need Edgemaster's Handguards to make it work.
---
This is very inefficient compared to how easy Daggers are to acquire for tanks. Even if you can't get Aged Core Leather Gloves, and either Core Hound Tooth, Perdition's Blade, or Gutgore Ripper from MC, you can just as easily use The Lobotomizer from AV rep with Mugger's Belt which is pretty easily obtainable from DM:North.
---
Realistically, no tanks outside of Humans should be using them except to look cool or if you're an idiot titan cow.
---
Dude, stealing a joke from the youtube comments? Shame!
---
OP must be the cheaters friend.
---
"100% guarantee" lmao
---
Warriors are mostly defaulted to DPS in raids.
---
I believe you did not bot, but you have afkd several times in AV. Some ban is deserved for you. Probably not lifetime ban, but a few months. Get over it. You are alliance, you should have only queue when you were certain you had 30 mins free for an av game. 
---
I have grinded to exalted and had so much suffering partly because people like you who did not contribute anything but leeched others. We can’t win with 30 active players against like 38 active hordes. I have made sure to not only report afkers for afk, but for cheating. (Note I was only reporting actual afkers, who did not do anything for more than 5-10 mins)
---
Could u guys stop downvoting banposts? Let the frontpage ebjoy the salty tears too bro
---
Pay a mage to teleport you lol
---
Sexymap addon if you want it
---
Reminds me of that quote "If you want to test a man's character, give him power."
---
Dude got a whiff of power and went Saddam Hussein on the rest of the world. 
---
Seems stable.
---
What like 750,000 runecloth??
---
Actually curious as to how you achieved this!
---
Great job!
---
Perm ban?
---
 https://imgur.com/biaUfb9   
---
There's literally no way for me to prove to anyone I was wrongfully banned, this is why we have "innocent until proven guilty" and not the opposite.
---
Holy shit, read his comments. OP is a dick.
---
Oof dont mention your ingame name.. ruining your reddit anomynousness
---
By far the easiest to level is a BM Hunter If you are as bad as you claim to be.
---
Just because someone thinks you’re coming off as a self-righteous asshole, doesn’t mean they encourage botting.
---
Yeah, it was stated in the OP and it was expected way before even BGs were released. OP asks people to do something they aren't interested to do, well, good luck.
---
That's a gross mischaracterization of what either of the two users you replied to said. You have made a good case for yourself being a cock.
---
I’m getting shit on for even asking so I appreciate this
---
Warrior is the best melee DPS in the entire game. When you look at the top raiding guilds like half of them are playing warriors. You will have no problem getting raid spots. 
---
The real pain in the ass is getting pre-bis because you share a lot of your loot with rogues. 
---
Also farming gold isn't great. You have to pretty much do strat live runs or play the economy.
---
Yea you get silenced, not flagged as a 3rd part users.
---
Blizzard is not handing out 6 month bans based on the community reporting you.
---
These guys hurt so you need a healer for it. DMN ghosts at the king give skill and don't fight back, also invincible.
---
Doesnt work. Do you maybe have a link of a working version?
---
Do you have a link of a working version? Would be very nice
---
Zero talismans of ephemeral power, zero rings of spellpower, 1 choker of the firelord over months of raiding.
---
I've been leveling a paladin alt with mining/smithing, and it's reminding me just how expensive smithing can be, as well as how unprofitable it is outside of a few recipes like Lionheart Helm.  Is there really any reason to keep the profession if I have guildies who can take my mined materials and craft what I need?  Thinking of going mining/enchanting (planning on soloing dungeons, DEing the rares).  Thoughts/advice?
---
All we know from Blizzard currently is "early 2020." Anything else is speculation.
---
No! Bad troll! Bad bad troll!
---
I use Shadowed Unit Frames which does it, but it's a unit frames addon so I'm not really sure if that'll help.
---
The latest version doesn't work? Can't test it right now. https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sspvp3/files
---
Okay sorry :) 
---
Na but for real... don’t roll on offspec... Imagine every dps warrior rolling on tank gear
---
Hey, I'm not making a judgement on whether you were wrongfully or rightfully banned. I was just asking for proof of the ban because I see the OP but haven't seen any posts of people getting banned.
---
If you really weren't botting, that is kind of alarming. Have you submitted an appeal?
---
But what do the dungeons yield per run????  It’s only the bosses hat give rep right?   I guessing like 400 per run?  And I need like 20k+ rep????
---
It will be 2028 before I can get exhalted. Seriously, what am I missing here.  That seems insane.
---
Honestly at least 2/3 of the games I've played in 5 horde were easily able to stroll into Dun Buldar because Alliance refuses to defend at all. They just keep slamming their head into "go straight to galv, kill the lts for HONOR."
---
I'm asking about experience farm, not gold. The plan is to grind dm once capped.
---
I wouldn't even bother with that macro if it's giving you trouble. Even if it did work, wouldn't it just blow up your screen with an error every time the other one doesn't trigger? Idk, I've heard of people doing that but that's not one I use 
---
Really the most important is making macros on all your most uses abilities that have 
---
#showtooltip X
---
/cast X
---
/startattack
---
Use one for Intimidating Shout with /cancelattack instead of startattack
---
One for Slam with 
---
/stopattack
---
/cast Slam
---
And a shield swap macro 
---
/equipslot 17 (shield name)
---
/equipslot 17 (OH name)
---
Use slot 16 for 2H
---
Rly good healers dont care about meters. Because those are the guys that do the work that meter-whores wont do. Like dispelling, totem twisting, ressing and even rebuffing.
---
Botters hurt everyone who enjoy playing this game fairly. You wont find any sympathy here. Tell your friend to fuck off from us non cheaters.
---
Pally benefits immensely from engineering, because the bombs help you get some extra damage when needed. And if you ever plan to try tanking, engineering is the best.
---
you better have blademasters mate
---
Thats what happens when you play a dwarf priest
---
That’s fair enough then
---
I dont mind playing 30minutes for 6k honor, rather that than 8minutes for 2k and into another 30min queue.
---
At least I had found Time to play other games while in queue.
---
wat, how?
---
Its been discussed, alot actually. I already am paying for 5 accounts, not going to add one extra to levelup a single alliance char just to MC that one guy.
---
You cannot have allies and horde chars on same PVP server account.
---
I really wish you'd get falsely banned, might maje you understand the concept of sympathy.
---
Ah, my apologies. I shouldn’t reddit before bed. I personally stayed in zf until brd, then ran that until 57. The earlier you can get into strat, the better. If you have guildies to help, you’ll level much faster.
---
Thats fine. I was just curious about the griefing rules. Since that is a thing that happens in real life and its not illegal.
---
Try this. I haven't used it yet but it's been recommended to me.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sspvp3?sort=name
---
All bosses except those that are classified as "Warrior" have 0 armor after Sunder, Faerie Fire, &amp; Curse of Recklessness. Bosses classified as "Warrior" have 300 armor left. 1 Anhililator is questionable, 2 is overkill.
---
pat pvp
---
Yeah, the plan is ZF until 51/52, then spellcleave BRD prison for some levels, start doing full runs and getting gear from the various end game dungeons.
---
Quite sure theres been quite a few "sweaty nerds" involved in that thing. Working together. 
---
How many coders does blizz currently has working on Classic, maybe couple at max ? "since its already ready, you just import all shit".
---
HotW / NS is the best build for being a true hybrid in the game.
---
You can use it to PvP or PvE, tank or heal in raids or 5mans. It's great and super versatile.
---
It's the only reason I'm considering leveling a druid after my pally.
---
Go 2h fury, it's pretty fun to play. If you do it right you should be able to dish out some pretty good numbers.
---
You mentioned that you want to help your guildies, that's the way to do so.
---
Lol, that's the first time I've been called that.
---
But..the dude is right? MS&gt;OS even in 5 mans. If you were healing and your BiS dropped and the druid tank took it because 'its good for moonkin' you'd be making a post about how it's unfair.
---
I'd never take a dps piece on my warrior if I was there to tank it if say a rogue needed it.
---
Ah yes, the classic blame other people for your own choices.
---
I heard hunters had to take care of their pets though :l
---
Generally you go by what your role in the dungeon is, not what you say your main spec is. That's been the 'rule' as far back as Vanilla, unless no one else needs the piece
---
Otherwise warriors would get claim to 100% of loot that wasn't clothie shit, even when they tank.
---
My fiance's account was banned when we got home from work today supposedly for cheating and she's level 14. She just started playing 2 days ago. In her 5ish hours of playing I was with her the entire time and she has never cheated. Tell me again how she deserved that?
---
Nah, you're out of your element. Writing scripts is not enough for this. If you'd like a demonstration to experience first hand, write a keylogger with timestamping and hit spacebar every minute for a few hours while watching netflix. Minimum 3 hours.
---
Next, write a script to randomly simulate that for the same amount of time.
---
Compare. Don't forget to record how long the key was pressed too! You'll have to randomly simulate that as well.
---
If you'd rather read about what others have to say, here:
---
https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~swc/pub/bot_identification.html
---
They address one of their solutions' resilience to simple random-delay attacks :
---
"the burstiness magnitude scheme is not only resistant to simple random-delay attacks; it is also more effective in terms of detection capability because the burstiness of randomly-delayed traffic is even lower than the original."
---
Come back when you have more to say than "oh, its not really that hard" otherwise you just look ignorant.
---
That's just retail attitude: if you are unhappy, whine hard since Blizzard catered to hard whiners all the time in retail.
---
Tribal. The devilsaur set is the most useful and widely used thing you need a specialization for. Get the Onyxia Scale Cloak recipe for BWL and the salt shaker.
---
Invest in engineering for the other profession. Whatever you have other than engineering profession is just preference. If I were you, I would drop LW asap for enchanting or armorsmithing if you want to craft. They're just going to contribute much more long term. Or really any gathering one, the usefulness of leathworking as already fallen off a cliff.
---
On my Druid I just reply with “can tank/heal/dps, will be rolling on &lt;items I want&gt;”. I either get an invite or I don’t and when it drops I roll. Any complaints “sorry I told &lt;inviter&gt; what I was after” and that’s the end of it.
---
Saves much drama.
---
Not per server but per battle group.
---
X amount of servers is in the same battle group
---
there was a banwave?....nice
---
I'm a moderator on the Discord, and Menethil is an active member. I'm not positive either way, but he is an active member of our community discord.
---
Trib runs are much better gold so i would just spend 5+ hours practicing that until you have it down. Just spec MM to trueshot and survival to improved FD. Also use a wolf with furious howl.
---
Good luck, and say hello to 2-3M r14 honour requirements.
---
GRIZZLY was a cancer on Stalagg, colluding to track down and have Horde kill anyone that messed with their cartels. They will work with Horde guilds to collude for world bosses, so keep an eye on that, and they like to do things like have Alliance MC'd so they can kill them, or notify their pals when raids go out so Horde knows when to blockade BRM.
---
Too bad they aren't taking their buddies Washed Up with them.
---
Skinning while leveling. It’s the only profession you can reasonably keep up with while leveling without going out of your way. 
---
Herb is good solo farming. Mining is good for DM:East jump runs. Skinning losses a lot of value compared to mine/herb but if you get to 315 and skin Ony/MC than it is worth it. 
---
At level 60 you should get engineering. It’s too useful even if you don’t plan to PvP much.
---
It’s one of the specs that has the most ability’s to stop your opponent from playing the game PvP omegalul
---
Ye dude stick with your story, cos that’s all you got. Lie all you want, blizzard ain’t buying your bullshit for a reason. Enjoy the 1 year ban 🤠
---
How much honor do i need for the pvp trinket?
---
The account got auto banned for “using bots and 3rd party software”, no idea what you are even trying to prove me. If it had been a decision of a blizzard employee he would’ve probably mentioned another appropriate reason don’t you think?
---
&gt; You get that this is only a problem on megaservers, right?
---
You get that "megaservers" have massive amounts of paying clients. We only have these megaservers because of blizzards poor judgement. They created the problem, yet they dont do anything about it.
---
Seems only way to make them do anything is keep posting these mass lag videos, showing how fucked the servers really are and make it as public as possible. Then blizzard might figure, this can affect our subs and profits. Because they wont do shit for their paying customers. But if you unsub, then they will bombard you with emails...
---
Hello instagram.
---
The only reason to get QS is if you're a human that can't get raid weapons for some reason and won't be able to for the foreseeable future.
---
&gt; I'd never take a dps piece on my warrior if I was there to tank it if say a rogue needed it.
---
Why are you doing the dungeon in the first place?
---
1) Yeah, I could get it to respond. I think I could get it to log out after too many messages too, etc. It would log all chats. I could get it to respond differently to GM whispers as well. As far as throwing random strangers buffs.. i don't remember with the software I used but I think it's entirely plausible.  
---
2) I don't have the answer to this. I'd imagine enough would have to trigger a response, but at the same time as far as I know there could be no such flag.  
---
3) I suppose you could open a ticket, but if you cannot see the person how do you know they're botting? Back when I botted I think the only system was typing up a ticket.
---
99% of the storys end up like this:  
---
Hey guys I got banned don't know why here's my proof.  
---
Blizzard gm will reply: Yes we banned you because you were cheating/buying gold  
---
\*User has deleted account\*
---
glad someone said somethin damn
---
You shouldn't have been botting in the first place.
---
Lmao
---
lol, include that in your appeal. seriously.
---
Or , you know, you could just get good and do it without...
---
Hahahaha I love you just simply copied and pasted the comment rather than entertaining any other thought. 
---
OP can’t read or OP is an idiot
---
I WISH they would do layering with buffs going on all layers to keep the fucking server working. When getting the ony buff in lag lasts longer than MC raid...
---
Upvoting for jmod smackdown
---
Don't take those guides as cannon. If you are running out of mana during boss fights then, yes, I would take cosmos for the extra int. Items can also be situational. I use different gear in certain dungeons and for different bosses. Overall though, I would agree that cosmos is better.
---
People are throwing around the "Turtling" accusation too much. Defending against an enemy rush is not Turtling
---
Good, another botter got well-deserved ban. Now only account sharers are left to ban and maybe the  pvp ranking in classic will actually have any meaning.
---
Literally every warrior tank I ran with rolled on every but of leather DPS gear I saw on my rogue, so it’s really not.
---
On my Druid I tell people what I’m going to roll on and it doesn’t change with my role in group... I’ll do whatever but the stuff I want is the stuff I want and if it drops I’m going to roll on it.
---
I did that a few times in trying to figure out what works best.
---
Mostly the issue is interest in general, so the few responses you get to your advertisement being people who want to be cheap mars what otherwise might be kinda okay.
---
&gt;Don’t only blame blizz for problem people have created for themselves.
---
Blizzard originally releases WAY too few servers, players choose server from that original list, because of their guilds and friends. Player created problem my ass.
---
Argent Dawn gives the only shoulder enchant, but it only gives +resistance.
---
The ones that gives stuff you actually want are all tied to the later raids. I wouldn't bother with any of them right now.
---
Every tank happily rolled on all the DPS gear I saw dropping so not sure where the issue is...?
---
Setting a script to make some movements to prevent AFK is still botting. Good riddance.
---
Or you know, people want to clear it way faster for which this is a huge speedboost
---
50 AVs a day. No time for shower
---
Fake news from someone with no clue
---
This guy is not really making a great point, the neck is the best pvp and pve neck for warriors and rogue
---
Whereas the ring is great for pvp but mediocre for pve
---
So even in a guild that is pvp focused it's still valid to prioritize the head to melee dps
---
Mp5 is not that great for a priest. Not sure about druids/pallys. Shamans however love it and I would suggest using the rare cape you have. 
---
The +healing cape is rare to get and on some BiS lists might be ignored or added as a second option. 
---
Cloak of the cosmos is a decent item and at this stage, I’d say it’s worth it to grab that one quick, and then focus on getting Hide of the Wild over farming for the +healing and Mp5 cape. But if you happen to get that rare cape, ya it might be better to use depending on your class.
---
I fully agree with this. If you have the gold, you can generally do anything. 
---
Time sunk cost fallacy often keeps people in a lot of things. I'm keeping enchanting for the guild, but if I wasn't the main enchanter for it, I would absolutely switch.
---
If its taking twenty minutes of lag for the buff to hit, then you have to fly to Ony and start it's really not faster.
---
Quick question? Can't you macro player actions in game to the extent of effectively botting? Like wasn't that a feature? I clearly remember making a solo raid macro that basically botted entire rooms at the push of a button, when I was on legion of course. But I thought classic had the same feature. I mean I could've just been exploiting some feature that took me weeks to get the hang of but isn't that essentially what some people are doing? Now if they are using an out of game feature then I completely understand. But if it was a feature shouldn't they just limit it?
---
No, let's operate assuming you lie and you botted. Bye.
---
You have some issues man.
---
the billionaire who's products you buy also wants you dead, stop being so fragi- nvm just read your name
---
Yeah, if you are aoe farming all the quest mobs to the point I can’t complete a quest, and refuse to accept a quick invite so I can go about my day, yes I am going to think you are a piece of shit.
---
And still the lf1m tank ubrs runs will have 5 wars in them all claiming being unable to tank.
---
Fury prot with anger management oooff the dream.
---
Since when is North GM?
---
Lol okay I get it, you guys don't believe me.. Neato, luckily I haven't been banned and don't plan on botting, because I'm not hellbent on optimizing, just having fun while also maintaining a personal life.. Sorry I struck a nerve with so many people here with an abrasive post.. Probably should have posed as a question vs. attacking Blizzard, and unleashing the wrath of the Blizzard bois
---
We usually get the buff on the previous night/earlier drop on raid day, exactly for this reason
---
I played 16-21 hours a day this week to rank up.
---
I was banned for “botting”.  My entire guild sees me on all day everyday, I’m ALWAYS talking in AV, talking in my guild discord and in guild chat, all day. Farmed over 5k HKs this week not counting today, and I got banned.
---
Never botted once, used an auto clicker, or anything remotely close.
---
Please fuck off saying everyone that got banned deserve it, asshole.
---
&gt;and then you do 4 set tier 3 with "Sinister strike crits causes you rto regain 5 enery"
---
&gt;
---
&gt;and you equip 2 swords with sword spec
---
&gt;= infinite energy?
---

---
Hunter rotation (and properly avoiding clipping auto shots) is harder than pressing frost bolt over and over.
---
Not really. Macros have what are called protected actions - certain things that there are commands for, but they explicitly don't let you do in a macro. Moving, for example, isn't directly possible with a macro. There's also no command to add a time delay without an addon, so you'll get cockblocked by global cooldowns pretty quickly, and Blizzard has those addons on lock so you can't do anything like casting spells with them. Using the /run command will get you farther, but not much, thanks to the 255 character limit. You might fit a full rotation into a macro, via things like /castsequence, but that still requires repeatedly pressing the same button and is nothing anywhere near playing the game for you.
---
Get your gear from „PvP“ then xD
---
Lmao you're pissed
---
This is why I don’t understand people bitching about reserves. At least if you are willing to pass on that item you still get to go for everything else.
---
Time for a new account
---
Then I’ll roll on whatever spec I please as well ;). It’s not “MS over OS unless you’re the tank”.
---
why would you write that novel to justify clearly shitty behaviour
---
Oh yeah, in my experience the RP is pretty much completely optional (so go for it if you want :D) but you can also just play normally and enjoy watching the cool characters and funny acts that others come up with. Also, imo, the community is less “try-hard” and overall friendlier due to it being an RP server
---
This shows Golemagg being 100% horde. It’s obviously a useless site
---
But mana
---
QS is pretty shit for threat compared to anything faster. The best way to keep threat is to basically get as many heroic strikes out as possible and a 2.2 sword just instead good enough when you have 1.8 to 1.4 speed weapons that do it better. 
---
(CHT, Perds, Alcor/Fel Striker, Eskanders)
---
It's not 'very little'.
---
Stupid people like you don't deserve to be able to play the game at all. "Issue bans based on things not in the TOS" go fuck yourself mate
---
You can 3 man omokk with a decently gears dps tank and healer. Gotta mind control a lot and have friends willing to run it with you. Offer them all the other blue drops.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if archivist cloak is ignored based on how insanely low the drop rate for your specific type is.
---
Dont use sa. Use an imp ea rogue. No need for anihilator.
---
Depends, I am a boomkin but often get forced into the healing role if the group doesn’t want to waste another 20 minutes trying to find a healer. 
---
I think it really depends on just making things clear beforehand. My paladin can tank, but I want him to be a healer. If I am tanking a dingeon(so that the group actually gets going) I still feel like I should be able to roll on the gear I am actually there for.
---
Figured. I had to keep watch on my PC just to sorta input the macro again. No wonder these guys are getting banned then. Too bad blizz doesn't do anything about third party add-ons to try and stop this. But ban waves will just sorta affect the innocent as well. I'd prefer extra security against botters.
---
1. Get ravager 
---
2. Get crusader enchant or lifestealing enchant 
---
3. Get a full group of people paying 3g ea. The group must consist of a healer and an AoE class. 
---
4. Ask everyone politely if they need any loot and if it's okay to put FFA so you can get trash loot. 
---
I make 45g/h with this. 
---
25k exp/h for the boosted players. 22 min FULL clears. 
---
It is by far my best source of income. 
---
It is impossible to get such a good gold/h rate without AoE player and Healer. 
---
And yes. Believe it or not people do pay 3g ea för this shit
---
Word, trying to level a protection pally and until I hit my 50s the loot is kinda rare. There are bits but I’ve just said fuck it and wear mail and leather for stats and dodge with my plate.
---
Unlike OP who joined a group by saying they were healer, then tried to roll on shadow gear.
---
Try not botting :^)
---
Sympathy doesn’t exist in wow. E.g. “you got corpse camped for 30 minutes and you can’t play the game? Well, sound like pvp happened on pvp server”
---
The saved warlock wasnt even in the group when we entered
---
[tauren male]
---
Awaiting Jmod smackdown
---
People have this weird pissy thing about people reserving. He would be more likely to get the group going by just not allowing competition than to say he was “reserving”.
---
yeah and no one on assist
---
In a world where every class had max talent points, mages would be the ultimate glass cannons. They wouldn’t gain much survivability outside what many already have, but that damage output would be insane.
---
A short term money boost is pretty much worthless compared to a subscription.
---
Yeah after I get those few pieces I’m thinking engineering for pvp, thanks!
---
I've heard of them banning people for being on bank alts before, not just on wow classic.
---
Atleast we wear shoes. You mudhut dwelling creature.
---
He wasn't reserving, he was intentionally not inviting people that would roll against him on it. There's a pretty large difference.
---
Ecks dee
---
How long are the Horde AV queues on Grobb?
---
Wow. What a tale, I’ve honestly never heard anything like it. I’m really happy that you guys got your raid in, I know how stressful it can be when shit goes wrong and you got 40 people who have committed their evening to raid
---
Guess I’m just not used to it since I quit during wotlk
---
For levelling however, theyre completely braindead.
---
It's all of the reasons combined. Never one reason.
---
Also, as a tank, I can assure you that ST is not popular. A smooth run can easily take 1.5-2 hours. You have to coordinate people for the puzzle. The last boss can actually wipe your group regularly (banish tank, no offtank, clothies die). And you kill way too many bosses who drop almost nothing (6 balcony bosses and 4 green dragons).
---
I like the huge amount of XP in it, but I really don't like the dungeon itself.
---
But he entered mc while being in the raid then left the raid / logged out and go kicked?
---
Dude I also got banned today and never botted. Played 16-21 hour days every day this week to rank up while constantly talking in AV ad to my guildies and in disc constantly -all week- and last week while AVing.
---
Bullshit ban wave and I’m appealing it until I’m unbanned.
---
Sincerely, a NEET that doesn’t use s not because I have autism and just fucking play all god damn day. Give me my account back.
---
&gt;Skinning while leveling. It’s the only profession you can reasonably keep up with while leveling without going out of your way.
---
I think you need to think beyond that. It will A) it takes quite a bit of time to skin everything, B) only the highest level leather etc are worth shit. Anything lower are sold in AH for less than vendor price, or taking into account the AH cut, at a loss, C) leathers take a LOT of bag space, if this is a alt that you can send big bags, sure. But if its 1st char, you are going to be throwing a LOT of leather away, since any gray is worth more.
---
On a warrior, i really wouldnt even bother. Take mining and level it up as you go. Now its relatively simple to do, only new alts might be checking the low nodes. Not half the server like in launch. And i would just do engineering, since most are going to want that anyways. Or mining/herb if you are not going to get engineering.
---
Them stones sell for quite nice price, since people levelup engineering via AH.
---
How did he reset the mob?
---
Late but not too late. Start, level, enjoy.  You may have a harder time playing certain roles because spots are limited for certain spec/classes
---
You’ll get downvoted and probably removed for self promotion but I’ll check it out
---
Well it's a shit attitude and we shouldn't indulge nor encourage it.
---
Good point, I should have thought of that - thanks!
---
Shit hope your main also gets banned. Looks like an oversight that should be fixed.
---
Rather spend 20% more time stress free than 20% less stressed out.
---
SP gets royally fucked for gear options until later phases, so yea, it is pretty much the best they can reasonably get for a while yet even from raids.
---
Definitely a tank. Pretty much everything in PVE comes down to how good or bad your tank is and how good they are at leading people. Most DPS act like this is retail so you have to work with people wanting to mindlessly follow you and zerg
---
I wonder if he still uploads to youtube, I used to be subbed but the last time I remember seeing one of his vids it lacked serious quality and he just came across as a tired old angry gamer
---
I feel like I'm the only one that cannot stand leveling at all whatsoever. I dunno, just not my cup of tea I suppose. I didn't play back in vanilla, but I love dungeons and raids but despise leveling.
---
no clue how these forums work, if you know of anywhere which allows self promotion send it my way
---
If you're Alliance, PvE servers are around 75% Alliance on average.
---
I'm on Nethergarde Keep and it's bustling with activity across all levels.
---
You can't just handwave something *you* don't understand as something I don't understand. Don't be a fool. If you had any reasonable consideration in this discussion you wouldn't be so dismissive.
---
If he doesn’t have edgies he probably doesn’t have LHH, in which case getting the Axe Helmet is perfectly viable until he sees some swords and makes a LHH. It’s about doing the best with what you have and working on getting better gear. AOTDW is very nice with Flurry or Frostbyte (and +axe skill somewhere l) until you get Edgies (or just swords if human).
---
Wait, you can't rename pets?
---
For AV bots, couldn't they just check who doesn't do any healing (to others) / damage across multiple bg's?
---
Whichever server you pick, make sure you're not adding to faction imbalance by checking [here](https://ironforge.pro/servers/). If you're rolling Horde try to pick a 50/50 server or a server where Horde is slightly less populated than Alliance is.
---
It's around 10x Elite with 15khp, they are hitting hard and probably without them, it would have taken more time to cap Aid Station to stop the respawns.
---
That's kinda fast compared to the vanilla 3-12h AV's. Not saying I enjoyed them, just a comparison.
---
Either way, deviate delight is pretty good.
---
Although if you are still leveling it is better to get LOTP first as the NS talent won't be available till 60. You can respec at 60.
---
Talking like grizzly was thr only guild to exploit layering. Every single guild and person who hit 60 and raided molten core within 2 weeks exploited layering.
---
Some, not including grizzly, also exploited it in dungeons and did a lot more damage to the server and economy.
---
Honor trading? The pvp meta was a 4 man sweep squad. A few players on both sides were accused of honor trading, never saw anything come of it myself. 
---
Also no one win trades in battlegrounds. Just some knowledge for you. You lose honor and thus fall behind in ranking if you don't win as much as possible. The strong premade survive, the weak ones farm less and take lower brackets or disband.
---
Oh so you're the guy that got slapped by a naked rogue in that one video? Good riddance.
---
Go sm/ruin, just corruption and immolate,  you have to get bane, spam sb till right before you pull agro. 
---
Trash sucks, bosses are your time to shine. Just focus on not wiping on trash.
---
In raw stats yes. But t0 makes up for it with it's far superior set bonusses of 40 ap and the 35 energy proc.
---
I'm still using the set and I've been raiding since launch. And almost all my parses are in the 90-99.
---
You can find that in blizzards page, but its dependent of the char level you are moving. It was like 100g on low levels and 5000g on L60's i think.
---
One thing to note is I did a good parse on a couple of bosses, mainly the melee stand and fight ones.
---
When I sort by bracket my parse is higher than most. So maybe it's more of a gear thing.
---
No bigger bro than Gangzilla. The friendliest multi boxer on stalagg.
---
Sadly, the other guy is right. It's extremely non-trivial to make a script that can reliably appear "humanly" random, as opposed to being a little *too* random. Impossible, no, but it's not simple either, and certainly not something that the average Joe with a "Lua for Dummies" book open on the table could pull off.
---
That said, *detecting* something being too random for a human isn't exactly trivial either, and even less trivial the closer to "humanlike" it gets, so it's a race between Blizzard trying to close the window and the botters trying to lose more weight so that can keep fitting through. The botters will always be one step ahead, but that doesn't mean they can just rest on their laurels either.

Head was still on its 6hour timer i believe. The head can despawn sometimes even when the cooldown is still going.

I almost downvoted your post because that guy was such an asshat lol
---
Wait, so they raid at 3 pm or at 9 pm? If at 9 pm why not just reset it after the others got their buffs? If at 3 pm why bother preventing your from being able to reset?
---
My route was silverpine, hillsbrad, thousand needles, shimmering flats, stranglethorn, swamp, march, tanaris and so on.
---
Did quite a few dungeons on my way, would probs benefit a warrior a lot too. Scarlet monastary, Razor, uldaman, zul farak to name a few.
---
Fully buffed bb + cht isn’t bis for hunter in raid, so calm down
---
Not entirely sure how he *gets* to the boss but I imagine it's something lkke mind controlling both his guards consecutively (focusing their damage on the boss) and then finishing him off yourself?
---
I personally think its not doable, especially given you're likely only partially pre-BiS if you're hunting these.
---
We waited 30 mins for buff. Sure we could have cleared mc faster without. People are fucking sheeps
---
Do you think I can get rank 9 in one week? I am now rank 7 at 82% progress, last week I got around 1,2 ranks as well in bracket 11. Same bracket this week. Additionally, am I correct in thinking that if I finish in bracket 11 every week, I can gain 1 rank per week until rank 11? Or is more required?
---
You need to controll them, just imp. Blizzards with some good Novas. Maybe you should pick up a third mage
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with having immense pride in a video game achievement. Different people value different things in this world.
---
I DO think there's something wrong when you let your achievements go to your head and you become a dick about it.
---
Blizzard really fucked the server hard. Before the first wave of transfers, the population was basically even, slightly horde favored. It's hilarious that people are blaming horde for killing the server when Blizzard did it only a few weeks after classic came out.
---
Last time I checked it was 80-20 if I were to believe the website. But I can hardly believe that, seems inaccurate to me.
---
Pretty funny this conversation is happening in a thread that starts with 'amazing coders'.
---
That is called an [escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character). It tells the next character to be literally printed instead of parsed, if it is part of a syntax.
---
So if you want to make a backslash appear as a backslash, you have to do two in a row. The first one is telling the second one to be printed.
---
You can click 'source' beneath reddit comments to see what was typed directly.
---
Tanks need sunder armor for aggro.
---
**Escape character**
---
In computing and telecommunication, an escape character is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters.  Generally, the judgment of whether something is an escape character or not depends on context.

Hunters gain much less from their talents than other classes like rogues or warriors.  Hell one of our 31pt talents is Wyvern Sting.

I think hunters might be the strongest class with 0 talents points.

I don't have 30 stacks to be fair. But if you fish after midnight it doesn't take long to get lots. I fished maybe 20-30 minutes and got nearly 3 full stacks a few nights ago.
---
I don't see 30 stacks being clear evidence of botting. 300 on the other hand....
---
Kind of the exact opposite, since bots are comprised entirely of logic and the Terminator franchise had absolutely none.
---
They don't reveal themselves to general public 😒 Players don't want any extra competition.
---
Lol its not that hard. Maybe if you are rocking a 60% but if so you shouldnt even be out there trying to get BTs imo.
---
It's been closer to 50/50 after BGs released. But there are definitely more horde on the server.
---
I agree and thats because a huge chunk of Classic players use a post vanilla mindset for Classic. People applying ideas and concepts developed in later expansions into Classic was never going to end well.
---
Throw in Blizzard's inept handling of launch (putting in new realms too late after launch that were always going to end up being 2nd class realms and not taking steps to keep a reasonable balance of alliance/horde).
---
I PMed you a discord link, go crazy.
---
Don’t re-roll.  Go outside.
---
Christ dude go the fuck outside.
---
Well thats more in the what happens to do them category
---
As a warlock, thinking of having all of that part of my kit unlocked. I already know how straight up broken we would be
---
Hey it's me! Casual player. I raid once ,twice a month and got 0 gold.
---
Ive gotten like 5 epics and benediction from a few guild raids. The best thing about joining late is that everyond else is fully geared, Soo it's loot pinata for us!
---
You can for sure raid casual.
---
I'm here to resurrect the dead and say sadly I guess in the patch 'classic' is in. AV did not have the ability to join as group. Sometimes I hate #nochanges
---
Fishing in av? (didn't even thought about this possibility)
---
On the other hand when I remember how some av ended fishing may be nice alternative (joke)
---
I know a common strategy is for dps warriors to first use sunder to quickly get the stacks and avoid an early aggro pull. But do tanks not use it as a filler or rage dump?
---
I have QS but switched back to my Ironfoe. More chances to proc Flurry, HOJ, more rage generation.
---
Lol this guy was lying about his guildm what a wierdo
---
I suggest Kromcrush. The last consensus was a 60 (h) / 40(A) split. but it feels even. alliance is more PVE centric than horde (we have all the top guilds.) every week there is some guild drama or loot drama post / pvp shit talking threads. It feels like the real vanilla experience.
---
Thats a great way not to find tanks. Everybody rolls on anything the can make use of.
---
Level with herb and mining. Keep it up as you go so that in any some you're questing in, you're hitting all the herbs and mining nodes.
---
At cap, find a healer buddy and run dire mail East jump runs as a duo. You'll make so much money. Once you're filthy rich, drop herb (or if you're buddy has it), and pick up another prof if you want (probably engineering or blacksmith)
---
your daddy gave you good advice
---
Try this to see through walls... drink something that makes you tipsy then click the ornate spyglass item... you'll notice it zooms out instead of in...Now scroll out until you see your character(the ornate buff will still be on) now you can see through walls and even the floor you're standing on. Also there is a command that lets you zoom out further
---
Beta
---
Not only is it doable as every ranged (even ele), it's easy as spriest.  Plenty of video guides on YouTube, but the TL;DW is mind soothe/mind control op.
---
dps wars open with a sunder, ea rogue builds combo point and unleashes ea(overrides sa).
---
tank opens with 31 pointer be it bt or ss. just spams bt/ss revenge herioc strike.
---
They got shorter, but remember after pvp gear was sold for honor, forgot the patch number, my account had been hacked and everything sold so was farming pvp for new gear while waiting for gm verdict. I had many 4-5 hour games on eu servers.
---
I don’t use those addons, but I have zpearl unit frames which lets you customize how debuffs appears on targets including the frame color, big debuffs, and different timer methods on them. Really useful for things like sheep, nova, cone of cold etc. and I’ve been meaning to look into the options more for it
---
This just reminded me of a group I bumped into in The Barrens when I was levelling my Druid. There was 3 of them, waiting to kill a centaur dude who only spawned once you’d killed enough of his captains. They refused to invite me, and apparently I was the only one with a /target, /instantcast macro, because I got the tag and went on my merry way.
---
That was great! I’m dw fury but that looks like so much fun.
---
Yea...
---
This is false. Annihilator has a low proc rate, and stacks 3 times, having multiple people in the raid with annihilator helps its uptime tremendously.
---
Gaytomcruise?
---
I wouldn't be able to do the thing regardless of drugs.
---
&gt;nobody would agree on which change to make
---
&gt; \#nochanges never made any sense to begin with 
---
Paradoxial, isn't it?
---
How brave!
---
It sounds like you aren't kiting. Are you specced frost? For single target you want to start casting frostbolt from max range, continue doing that until they are in raange of you then frost nova/blink run away and get range again and repeat. It's very strong especially as you level up you can often even solo elites. If you get multiple adds then utilize your polymorph. Basically it's all about not even taking damage in the first place by not allowing the mobs to hit you.
---
Bonecrusher is cheap and easy 2h even for orc to go
---
Nope bye Felicia
---
As you correctly said, those weapons are stat sticks for hunters - marginal upgrades, similar to an armor piece upgrade... While for rogues a raid MH compared to even the best pre-raid (Krol Blade) is +30% dps in one item. For rogue the MH weapon is probably more important than the entire t1 set.
---
Literally had that reaction "this" night :) Love it.
---
You did just write "heals" which means you're joining the dungeon as a healer. If you're rolling on os gear it have to be agreed upon before. This guy is not wrong
---
Why in the world would queue time for Alliance exist? It will always be like this until the factions overall balance out to 50-50...which will never happen.
---
tbh anyone being elitests in classic WoW.. just why?  Also discord premades ruin pugging in classic.
---
&gt; Mind flay has terribe returns on spell power
---
3/3.5 scaling. Not that terrible.
---
Problem is Mind Blast threat spikes, esp when it crits.
---
i dont fully believe that. u grind that steep 50 gold and then switch back and u never gain anything at that point
---
Only way to add "LFG" is to parse global chat channels, and there's plenty of addons that do that - ClassicLFG or Puggle for example.  
---
Just join LookingForGroup channel, setup it output to different tab (so you won't be flooded with spam) and be happy.
---
Well hold on now...It could be both.
---
He’s joining as a healer. MS doesn’t mean dream spec, it’s what you’re showing up as.
---
The only problem is getting oom relatively fast. Need lots of consumables to counter this, but can farm those relatively easy.
---
I did this on a private server it was pretty mean
---
When your post is completely outrageous like that you dont need more.
---
dont worry, english isnt my native language either.  
---
So i also wanted to farm those mats. but the essensens are a pain in the ais since we have so many bots on our server that i cant even get 1 mob :(
---
Try Decursive addon with Healbot.  
---
Yes, it's more clutter in UI but it give you more flexibility - you wither heal via Healbot or dispell via Decursive.
---
Blizzard put fishing in to alterac valley themselves, you can fish in there if you want to or they wouldnt have put fish in the pond.
---
Blizz did you a solid. Go outside.
---
No spell power rings. No axe from Ony.
---
We get [Barb of the Sand Reaver](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21635/barb-of-the-sand-reaver) from AQ40.  I wouldn't waste my dkp or good will on minor melee weapon upgrades that are far better on melee classes.  Besides do you want to use one handers and do puny little girly man raptor strikes?
---
You could just farm gold and buy what you need.
---
On some servers population dwindled, but mostly because people moved to other servers.  
---
As a result there's Horde dominated servers and Alliance dominated servers.
---
Yeah outrageous is a subjective term based entirely on your opinion. Think whatever you want lol, you’re a nobody right? Who asked for your opinion? I was replying to someone else, I don’t think anyone was talking to you?
---
Yeah man i would be happy to find one too. Sick of starting the games with only 20 people. Never a chance of winning anymore.
---
Wait blizzard are banning? So why is my server still full of bots I have been reporting for months?
---
She’s immune to serpent sting.
---
False positives are a thing. If there's a ban wave getting rid of let's say ~10K bots, odds are there's at least a double digit amount of people or even more getting falsely banned after spending hundreds or even more than a thousand hours on their character so far. This wouldn't be the first time this happened and it's common in other games too. Really the only way they could ever get enough attention for Blizzard to care to look into it is if they're either a streamer or it gets a lot of attention online. Blizzard, just like any other gaming company, doesn't take ban appeals seriously unless you're some sort of content creator.
---
Lol I like how you think everyone is dumb, but your pathetic ass is just led around like a moron.   You basically dump all responsibility on the dev on a system you knew about. 
---
It's not their fault that you can't think for yourself.   The streamers for all their negatives understood they needed even sides, but your stupid ass can't?
---
Yeah okay.   The horde players who wanted to pwn noobs won!  Good luck next classic server  :)
---
Oh man it's so annoying when your tanks are full def, you can't play...
---
Close the door when you leave, it's cold out there.
---
If you think like that, better play something different. During every expansion your gear got invalidated every 3-6 months.
---
Because if they don't have their e-cred in the only game they played for the last 15 years what else do they have left?
---
What's wrong with that?
---
Heh, idk.
---
Bots aren't that efficient. Someone legit who plays 18 hours a day will probably beat a 24 hours a day bot.
---
There's probably a lot more bots in the Brackets 10-13.
---
S a t i r e
---
&gt;I'd never take a dps piece on my warrior if I was there to tank it if say a rogue needed it.
---
You might be the only one. Wanna tank UBRS for me?? :)
---
I got permabanned from my OSRS account that I haven't played in a year and a half because my account got hijacked and used as a bot
---
Do you feel bad for me OP?
---
I agree. But people didnt know that when they 1st played vanilla.
---
That may be true. I didnt know either.
---
But the think is people who knew and googled it are in my opinion not casuals
---
It's really noticeable with a priest because when you shield wears off you start getting push back from melee hits on your wand.
---
Yah I don't get it either.
---
Goblin Engineering or Gnomish Engineering?
---
The same thing could be said the other way around tbh. You could have said "I can heal but I'm rolling for dps items" and he could have turned you down instantly without all the hasse that you're referring to.
---
I'm not saying ms&gt;os is the golden rule that always has to be obeyed, but it's the rule that the classic wow community has accepted and use by default, and you're basically breaking that rule by not  communicsting properly. If I made a group and someone whispered me "heals" then I would assume (like 99% of the player base does) that this player is a healer and will roll for healing items.
---
Ironically, most private server guilds died after clearing Naxx once or twice. You never replace that gear, by that logic everyone should be farming naxx till fully BiS! /s
---
Low level zones are full of people
---
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you were botting or just being a leech. You were abusing the system. Either you participate, or you don't play the game.
---
So, I do about 50 Reddit posts a day with my premade redditors and we have an 85% positive upvote ratio with 3.5k upvotes per post in under 12 minutes. Periodically throughout the day I comment on posts like these to farm some extra upvotes and scout new talent as well as create 'downvote' lists.
---
Blamaeux is super balanced faction wise and PVP
---
His main spec is shadow he's just rolling healer to get groups faster. I did the same thing fearing my ele shaman never had a problem
---
I had the same thing happen to me in early Wrath when I was fishing for a solid 8 hours right through the night. Nearly had a heart attack.
---
It's the same on Flamelash on the horde side. It's pretty funny how the people on the mmo-champion forums say that classic is dying etc etc.
---
they could probably instant ban these accounts with their detection and just run the stats weekly.
---
They get money from customers continuing their subscription for 6 months at a time, banning them, giving them no recourse to recooperate their 6 months of sub (breaking TOS), and then most users making a new account and going again.
---
Stats don't always work in their favour.
---
You get Blink at 20 and that helps a bit in keeping range. Just slow mobs with frostbolt, when they get close, frost nova to freeze them in place (always use rank 1 frost Nova - the damage on higher ranks is negligible and just costs more Mana when all you want is the CC) then run away/get range, repeat. If things get dicey blink away.
---
10g ?! 
---
And the leechers pay nothing? 
---
I only take on people who agree to me taking all the loot which is like 90% of people
---
you know the bots were pretty advanced 6 years ago. even then they could relay messages to your phone/an app. being responsive doesn't really prove anything
---
MS&gt;OS. Mainspec is the role you are performing in the group. If you want to role of offspec gear, you need to clear it with your group first.
---
This is regarding endgame dungeons only. Leveling dungeons are nbd.
---
It’s like our auto attack, would be nice if it didn’t suffer pushbacks
---
Yes,
---
You can look at my past posts. Some drunk. 
---
All the same though. Do not have time to play the way I used too. That being said, it is not enjoyable since I would always be behind the curve. 
---
My friend off the game asked if I played this weekend. Told him I canceled. He said, "oh great, he wanted to do the same thing but felt bad". He had already started playing more time on a different mmo. 
---
People on Reddit will refuse to talk about it yet. But, classic is about to collapse on itself and continue to lose servers. 
---
It isn't a hit against them or the game. It is just people becoming more aware of just mindlessly playing AV or WSG with a movie in the background. 
---
Well well.... That will change once they get the rep they need. It won't.
---
A few signs a GM can use to spot them:
---
1. Online 24/7 no breaks whatsoever.
---
2. Inputs the same rotation over and over.
---
3. Does not recognise other players in front of them and will continue to dps down a mob you tagged before them.
---
4. Moves in a very linear pattern.
---
5. Don’t respond to chat text. 
---
Add all that up you don’t have a bad player, you have a bot.
---
I'm at 75 solo runs. Fuck this.
---
When I bid on an auction, and someone bids as well - overbidding me. What happens to the gold that I initially bid? Do I get it back?
---
You were suspended, not 'banned'. Besides, it's only for a week, probably a well deserved break?
---
How? Can you explain :D
---
You scratch mine and I'll scratch yours
---
Ok go drink after 2-3 mobs.
---
Ultimately you’ll be right, it will be expensive/slow  though
---
Make another char to farm.
---
I have 3 60’s; two healers  which raid and a mage to farm mats. Works well.
---
All are geared now and I’m leveling a warrior.
---
"Easily obtainable item". I spend more than 20h farming HoJ (75+ runs, doing him solo, 4-5 runs an hour). 
---
I wouldn't call that "easily obtainable".
---
You aint wrong
---
You've got your burden of communication backwards. The assumed default is that you roll on gear for the role you are performing in the group. If you want to roll offspec, thats fine, just clear it with your group first.
---
The entire player base? Thats just people who post on reddit. Small fraction of actual players.
---
I like Faerlina because of the hot drama. It's the streamer server so there's a lot of people and guilds of all levels. Only negative is the occasion queue, which you can dodge using Google Remote Desktop
---
If you are a shadowpriest and you are the healer in the dungeon, you do not need any shadowpriest gear. You are, for all intents and purposes, a healing only priest. If you want to roll on offspec gear, you clear it with your group first.
---
Same, feels especially bad when you k'ow it's for'you if it drops.
---
'talent'
---
you guys thought you wanted more servers, but you didn't
---
Everybody just ignored that Galv again just yelled to *slay the mall*. Why would you even fight for a lunatic like that?
---
Next time just hire someone to boost your account. Q
---
Why are you so worried about it?
---
I've asked about this before and people mentioned it was a thing back in vanilla too but I cannot recall it.
---
For those unfamiliar: Time between wand attacks is always the same, unless you get hit. Now between some attacks the pause is longer. This only happens to wand auto attack.
---
Same... I was so scared because I thought I was in trouble.  The gm was like “it’s no problem but I’ve seen you farming for quite a while without talking”.   Good times lol
---
Yeah and someone who is falsely accused is more likely to post about it online than stay silent. So the population is also actually biased to show a higher frequency of false positives than is truly the case. So it favours you and isn’t a good representation of the actual error rate. Don’t try talk population statistics with a biomedical graduate mate 🤪
---
This rule is already widely applied, its the norm. Its been the norm since vanilla.
---
What if... what if...
---
The people posting these aren't botters at all, but blizzard's own PR people trying to make it seem like botters are being banned to make us all feel better?
---
Skinning/Herbalism. Mining is hard to level and not as good as herbalism. Skinning is best for Warriors because you will spend a lot of time in UBRS later.
---
Seriously tho, we’ve had every weapon drop in large quantities except mageblade
---
Peaked as in, I'm chatting with a new guild mate without doing anything besides standing (ok, dancing) in IF, not necessarily needing to have to do something. And being totally ok with that. Ok with not having to farm for something or get my last BiS.
---
If it's anything like my server there's tons of people that are raid geared on mains and working on alts now. Tons of people still leveling just from that alone.
---
It absolutly sucks. I wish id rather not know the power of the shadows.
---
Allthough you get used to it and its not that much of a difference in speed and mana etc.
---
No it peaks at bwl zg aq bye
---
*thinks of Stormstrike then NS into instant, 100% Crit Chain Lightning with 20% more dmg*
---
I need new underwear
---
That would he why I said ‘...or very stupid’ yes...
---
Similarly, us Horde don't want you Alliance to think we turtle you just because we want you to /afk. We turtle you because it's more efficient for us to take your bunkers down and get HKs off you, instead of sitting in 20 minutes queue.
---
Why would the player failing to ninja upload a video of themselves failing?
---
You can't keep up Annihilator debuff with only 1 OT using it. 2 is necessary. Also I think that the first 300armor does 5% physical redution.
---
The responses to this are gold lol
---
Also go tf outside
---
Waiting for that sweet sweet war effort.
---
Is this from a stream VOD? Otherwise it’d be strange if the person failing would upload it themselves
---
Regardless, that’s super embarrassing for him
---
I heal dungeons as a shadow priest, I need dps shadow gear. Nobody complaints. :/
---
why didn't the other dude loot it right away when he saw him moving in?
---
Shadowpriest btw
---
The well-known bots and gold sellers on my server are still going strong :(
---
300 armor would make 1 annihilator questionable to you?
---
Do you even understand how much dps is lost from a target having an extra 300 armor against your tanks and somewhere around 12-15 physical dpsers?
---
You are suggesting that the DPS gain one *offtank* would get from using a slightly better weapon available to them, is better than the dps gain to *all* of the physical dps who are against an extra 300 armor?
---
Even if it's just for the "warrior" bosses, there's no possible way you meant to say having an offtank with annihilator is questionable, unless you failed every math class you've ever sat in.
---
Nah man everyone knows you go into a dungeon as whatever roll gets you into the dungeon, regardless of whatever your main spec actually is. I don't have it wrong at all, you do.
---
Alliance here... I hate AV but if you wanna even keep up with rank 9 you have to play like 15-25 hours a week. There is no fun... There is just honor per hour. God I wish more people played alliance so i could maybe take a  Damn bathroom break.  So forgive us if we're not enamored with epic last stands and battleground prowess.. Most alliance players have already done so many AVs we'd rather gouge our eyes out than fight in the field of strife. I'm convinced the only reason allies give up so easily is so they can afk after getting a couple lieutenants and grab a drink while the horde wins
---
he is right dont downvote him boys
---
I mean a lot of people talked about classic as if it was the next great thing and would be the biggest MMORPG but it's not even close to that. Both retail and FFXIV are still way more popular, and as we know from the MMORPG community, if it isn't #1, it's dead.
---
&gt;Most alliance are rather peaceful, and only do PvP in bgs. Which needs  to change asap. Horde needs a taste of their own medicine and so this is  a call to action for all alliance players to kill all horde players on  sight, regardless of lvl disparity. Honor or no honor.
---
I like how people assume that their faction consisting of "better" people than the other one.
---
Why not? Entire guilds changed realms. This is how it should be.
---
Is the ban wave real?
---
Doable, but not great. You'd be better off just playing arms with Unstoppable Force and raiding in PvP spec. Quel'Serrar+Mirah's Song is what you'd want for fury.
---
I'm heart of the wild druid to level so feral/resto spec. I'm only doing the dungeons for healing gear but there's not enough tanks. I'll tell healers ahead that I'm rolling on certain pieces.
---
poisons are 7s per, keep poison until before garr&gt;mh dense oh elemental&gt; at shazz put poison&gt; stone at rag
---
You cannot Blizzard farm GY alone. I fear with teo level 45s you'll still be short on mana.
---
My suggestion:
---
1. Aggro boss so he is read. This causes all opened graves to run to boss first. Giving you some more time to open graves.
---
2. Ice Block when they run to you so you can gather them into a small area.
---
3. Nova and run away. Heal if you need to using First Aid.
---
4. Cone of Cold and kite them in circles. The cooldown finishes 1 second before the slow finishes. So you can do this indefinitely.
---
5. Your friend can join in with Cone of Cold on an alternate frequency as you. This way you have Cone of Cold active forever and double damage. 
---
Comments: 
---
1. Make sure your friend only starts coning when you've done atleast two. This way he wont get aggro. 
---
2. Avoid using frost nova when there is two of you. The mobs might try and switch targets due to range/reachability. You shouldnt need it and it just pulls the pack apart.
---
Enjoy :)
---
I do support your opinion but I advise sticking to the recommended daily dose of salt and vinegar
---
One reason that’s usually big with your sort is the investment. You’ve used over a decade amassing your collection. To leave now would render it all mute and void. The thing is, it already is - and your attachment is precisely what they want. They design the game now to maliciously encourage this attachment - from the ingame stuff to the cash shop, it’s all about money spend per player. The game may have dwindled a good 10 million subs, but it’s making more money than ever all the same.
---
If you’d like to learn more about this stuff, the industry term for it is “whales”. Give that and gaming a google at your own peril.
---
I'm not sure if you are being intentionally obtuse, or just plain ignorant.  Your bridge enjoys half coverage of at least 6 archers unreachable from the bridge itself, plenty of ranged purchase to fire from and retreat to healers, pylons to LOS at the fortress side, not to mention the 10 yard width that takes 1 trap to slow down or stop any number of attackers.
---
If the alliance wants to turtle, the horde is straight fucked.  
---
This experience is coming from an alliance player for 15 years and a classic horde enthusiast.  You can spare 10 people from your zerg to ruin the entire horde push if you just tried a little instead of whingeing about it on Reddit
---
If you have a friend who is a tank you can put together Strat Live runs and reserve the Righteous Orbs for yourselves. Especially if you don't need any gear from the dungeon, people are more likely to let it slide. 
---
*I know a lot of people frown on the practice of reserving orbs but I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention this option.
---
Anyone who cheats in games in general to be honest. Good riddance.
---
Giving people a cooldown/deserter buff for declining queues would not be a helpful solution because when you queue up, 75% of the time the game gives you an AV that's old, which you can check because the AV queuemaster lists AVs from old (top) to new (bottom), so if you have an old queue, you're likely going to want to decline and try to get a newer AV. A cooldown would just cause people to 1. Get punished for wanting a new AV and 2. Force people into accepting AV queues they don't want.
---
Love is Love.
---
Relic Coffer Keys and pickpockets from BRD
---
&gt;But given the similarities of a bot to a multiboxxer I’ve never really understood why multi boxing is permitted
---
What similarities ? Like in your case, your bot was recorded keypress-loop that the bot repeated, the other is a human player playing on multiple chars, controlling them all at the same time and reacting to whats happening ?
---
How is that in any way similar ?
---
I do multibox, just for the challenge of it. And what i actually do, is what most groups WANT people to do in a 5man. I let the tank build aggro, dps the correct target, pull when healer has mana and everyone is ready. Whats different is that i cannot do aoe kiting, my dps rotations are basically castsequences (so non optimal). I try to push the available button numbers on each of the roles to bare minimum. To have enough of cc and control, but so few i can do spam the buttons and can focus on whats happening around me.
---
No, there really doesn’t. Asymmetrical design is perfectly reasonable in an MMO RPG. Not every game has to have balance - really it’s mostly just competitive games that do. The genuine wow experience is about community and immersion, not competitive pvp or elitist pve.
---
This. Lashers are much easier to farm
---
From what I read, lock never left DM and therefor never entered MC
---
Hey I use autoloot. Am I a botter?
---
Or downgrade your operating system enough so all they see is "SOMEBO~1.EXE".
---
Not trying to be a smartass or anything, but it's the partyleader that has to make the loot rules clear, not anyone else. Otherwise they technically aren't breaking any rules, since the leader never set any loot rules, meaning you couldn't even report a priest for snagging a 2h axe.
---
This is so true...
---
I planned to play Classic "alone" without my usual gaming friends, because I Know how they are...they get burned out easily, they are always playing the FotM Multiplayer game, etc...
---
But I didn't make it a secret, so they jumped on the WoW Classic hype train...before I even realized they have picked a server, a faction and were assigning classes to optimize our endgame dungeon grinding.
---
I knew it was a terrible idea going in with this...but tbh, all games are better with your friends so I just roll with it!
---
And it was incredible while it last, I did all dungeons while leveling up (we are 5 and had all the roles so it was amazing), we kept our leveling more and less together so we often quest together in groups o 2 and 3! And farming our pre-bis was a breeze because we had a group of 5.
---
THe worst came later, they all quit and I am still playing!
---
To be completely fair, I am in decent guild and by total chance encountered some old friends playing on this server so I can't really complain much, I am sure that other people in the exact same scenario had it way worst than me.
---
But sometimes I can't help but wonder that I am playing Classic in a server I didn't plan on, on the faction I didn't want to and not playing the class I planned to play (Paladin and I am playing Horde).
---
Same. I don't recall anything about them stopping using Warden o.O
---
Absolutely 
---
Specify what loot rules applies
---
Specify what your going to roll on 
---
Ask if there are any questions. While traveling to dungeon.  
---
Screenshot the reply.  
---
That makes it Ninjaing if they break the deal above. 
---
But I also often state that il do ML (once you got a reputation of not screwing ppl over you save 100% drama as you control rolling according to the rules stated above).   Some ppl know there class in/out but can’t comprehend that other classes could need that item to.
---
Did this in olden vanilla days with my homemade fishing bot. Had it going while I was studying xD
---
GM repeatedly did this over the months I used it.
---
100% a thing
---
Every time this comes up, the discussion is always split. Its probably why a bunch of people made a classic+ subreddit.
---
After an hour, yes they completely unload and despawn any leashed trash.  I believe instances are hard capped to around 5-10 minutes, but have no evidence to suggest that too strongly.
---
Every player in retail was 1-2k per realm.  Now it's 2-3k.  And while modern servers have greatly increased capacity, both physically and virtually, it isn't infinite.
---
Not going to lie, it just sounds more like your trying to justify cheating on the grounds that their system isn't flawless.
---
Perhaps it's not flawless, but that still doesn't mean cheating should be permissible.
---
Where do you get information on the armor values? Can't find any good source
---
You said you're healing but you're rolling for DPS items.
---
Some people might be alright with that but groups deserve to know that information beforehand.
---
good riddance
---
I did the exact same thing as you, only difference is I was partly influenced by someone who pissed me off in game... this led to me getting back into gambling.... not good my best friend started playing lvled another 60 and here I am. Not ideal but at least I’m saving money
---
Get a life bro
---
druid is actually one of the best dueling classes.
---
You're not *forced*. That's called you CHOOSING to fill a healing role because you're not finding a group looking for your dps. 
---
So now you're playing a healing role, but you also want to roll on dps gear? Well guess what, that's not the role you chose to take on. And dps players will rightfully have a problem with you rolling on offrole gear.
---
Found the banned botter
---
a ghost town? have you tried leaving undercity lol
---
Been full clearing MC+ONY for 2.5 months and our guild has seen 
---
- 0 drillborers disk
---
- 0 pauldrons of might 
---
- 0 legplates of might 
---
- 0 bindings 
---
- 1 Obsidian Edged Blade 
---
- so much Druid gear that both our Druid healers and our Druid tank have a very nearly set of T1 and the T2 helm 
---
Me and the 2 other warrior tanks are very sad
---
I want to play a caster for BGs (already have a warrior for raids and a hunter for DM farms), but I'm really having trouble deciding between a Priest and a Mage.
---
How long can you keep fighting in BGs as a reasonably geared Priest? Like an Anathema shadow priest with the 3 T1 Spelldamage items and PvP items otherwise?
---
Professions are engineering and tailoring regardless of the class.
---
herb / alch.
---
just rolled on a fresh server and it's looking like ill have enough for my mount at 40 and all of my skills maxed before 50.
---
been making a killing selling deviate fish, thistle tea, rage potions, and free action potions.
---
Only buy rage potion and free action potion from the vendor, not AH.
---
your money making herbs are stranglekelp, swifthistle, and to a lesser extent, briarthorn for speed pots and rage pots.
---
Hamstring can proc windfury independnat of melee swing?
---
Mindflay has custom scaling instead of 3/3.5. It scales more like 1.5/3.5 while still taking 3 seconds to cast and that makes spriest scaling so bad.
---
I have been reporting a guy on my server for botting for over a month in Deadwind Pass. The name of that character is also in this thread saying he was falsely banned...........
---
I'll say it's working as intended. Good riddance.
---
Tanks are a little different, because they *can* wear leather+, and dps and crit and hit *does* improve their dps. So if leather is an upgrade to what they've got... in a normal situation without special loot rules or prior arrangements, then the warrior should be able to roll on said gear.
---
i mean, plus as a whole instant bans on detected cheats are kinda 'bad' because it gives a developer instant feedback on whether a method is detected..
---
I have been clearing rag and ony weekly since September and dont have either t2
---
Disgusting
---
Yes, because they would much rather not have the run happen, then have competition. 
---
The level of stupidity in this comment is pretty impressive.
---
How hardcore is the most hardcore guild on your faction (server, since there is technically neutral AH). That determines the 'market-price'.
---
You really don't need to be be flasking (and keep in mind that for quite a long time in vanilla flasks didn't persist through death) for BWL content. In many (not all) cases you could use various elixirs and get a better gold: performance ratio.
---
Unless Blizzard decide to change the spawn-rates (which would cause a massive uproar all around and be a PR disaster) there is a finite number of black lotus that will ever exist per server relative to the server being live. When you get to content where it might be more 'justifiable' to expect extreme flask usage (e.g. progression nax) you could severely undermine another guilds progression by buying out all of the materials for consumables. At that point in time there is no limit on what the materials might sell for (because whether you buy something or not could literally decide whether a guild can or cannot kill a raid boss that reset).
---
As long as you don't believe the most hardcore guild on your server is going to hold a monopoly on black lotus in the future then it'll always be more economical to buy them off the AH.
---
Never said they inherently were. I said assholes who min-max are a problem.  My problem is assholes, we are just talking about how it manifests within the min-max community.
---
That is a solid sad.
---
Do you just vendor the blues after few minutes searching for buyers? Just asking from a efficiency point of view.
---
It's almost like they stepped in and didn't allow creation of characters on overpopulated factions! Who could've thought that it would help even out servers?
---
Attack it
---
What a fucking shit-tier attitude. Yeah, everyone else's fault not yours. Imagine being proud that you barely out dps'd HALF the mages in a dumpster fire MC. Keep pretending you're not trying and not just actually terrible at the game
---
Have you got any links to threads where people are complaining about getting banned?
---
With the negative comments by alliance, admitting that turtle wins games for horde, id say we should do it on EVERY game.
---
You could take a couple of Sunken Temple runs. Its an interesting dungeon, 5 quests if i recall. Could squeeze a couple of levels from that. Thou it can be hard to find a group in general.
---
We don't care.
---
Blizzard made afking/botting possible themselves, you can afk/bot if you want to or they wouldnt have made it possible to do so.
---
Fuck off if you fish in AV, its basically afking, and there is a reason voting away someone says “you have been flagged by your teammates as lazy”
---
Join a guild
---
I'm quitting this game until next decade.
---
Not a question. I just wanted to make this shitpost, but it is probably too low quality to deserve a separate post.
---
&gt;suddenly a level 60 character appeared and asked me what was going on over here.
---
Yep, I know for a fact that GM's will do that (my friend was a GM for about 1yr).
---
As I player if I think someone is botting I will also try to interact with them with just a simple question.
---
Simple google search on blizzards stance to boting states. 1st time its 6 month. 2nd is 18month, then perma.
---
I think you lack comprehension skills my man.
---
Let the sergeant gamer dads play like they cried they wanted to on here
---
Also, since SW:P and mind flay can't crit, it hampers them even more.
---
Man Gen Z is really soft huh
---
Farm the boars outside Orgrimmar, they have a really high drop rate for Boar meat. On my server, 10 of these sell for at 50-60 silver. It takes me approx. 3 minutes to get 10 pieces.
---
At end game, there is probably only like 1-2 dedicates tanks per raid group. Probably 20% or less of all warriors you being are tanks let alone ferals. If everyone followed this rule no warrior or feral who could tank your dungeon, would tank your dungeon. Since you're forcing them to pass on the prebis they need for that dungeon.
---
Thanks! I have seen some people saying that the game is gonna die after phase 3 which concerns me... also what are the botters doing?
---
Chads dont click their pvp trinket lul
---
I enjoyed that very much!
---
Thats good to know actually, I was concerned i might need to be spending 100+g a week to raid BWL. 
---
I dont think they are that hardcore. At the moment (as far as other guildies say) we are near top in terms of rading guilds on the Horde side.. From what ive read here, our AH prices are lower than some of the more busy PVP servers (im on EU RPPVP). So im guessing we arent on as crazy hardcore server as others might be on. But who knows, I could be wrong.
---
I might just start buying it now when i have the gold then and stock up for personal use. I have my epic mount so any gold i have now i spend on non necessities (levelling alts etc).
---
The Impassable Supernovae also known as the Great Wall of Dun Baldar
---
Yeah he was streaming the raid and was mad he lost a roll on other gear before this so he tried to ninja loot
---
Is there a bot spefically farming mats for raidbuffs? Asking for a friend
---
false positives can happen. Yes cheaters abound and they scrubs and shitters. Right here in this post people have said they were whispered by GMs. If there is a automatic algorithm that bans in large blocks and no gm to verify it could happen. Generally a person can open a ticket or have a review process and wouldn’t need to come here to post. But it’s possible there are exceptions. Again cheaters and bots are scrubs and deserve the bans but jumping to conclusion is also not good. I’d rather hear a person out. 9 times out of ten they are going to expose themselves anyway. Take care peace to you in the new year
---
It’s a mob for a hunter quest. If anyone else (including your pet) gets on the aggro table, the demon will despawn.
---
Not sure about other chests but in this case it's ML but he does lock the chest out/despawn it
---
2 bots on my servers are running 8hr sessions and usually during off peak hours. (They are also very obvious).
---
yeah sunday bunch of us lost our ony buff after that we got disconnected when the buff popped. I wanted to quite then and there.
---
Also on Bloodsail (H), not a whole lot of RP in the open really but there is some. Horde is just low populated. There's a few guilds focused on it. People talk in /s IC mostly. Compared to WrA there is a lot more going on in Org on WrA, again probably because of the low Horde population on Bloodsail.
---
Salty banned bottlers in this thread
---
Hah, I was there.
---
It took 12 minutes from the ony head was handed in until we got the buff. We had play-by-play-commentary of the NPC walking from his normal spot to the head spot, including when he placed the pike BEFORE THE HEAD WAS ON IT (the head spawned 2 minutes later).
---
WoW in real time, love it.
---
Why is this so downvoted? It's all fantastic advice for a levelling Warlock who wants to get along with their tank and keep being invited back to groups.
---
I’m sure a paying customer in good standing would warrant a ticket ? Which could lead to a review ? If not I’d have to agree that’s a part of the system that should be fixed
---
From what I've seen yes. Bots aren't simply just a one program thing. You can make them do anything you want.
---
But I've seen several posts complaining about those things specifically about 24/7 bots
---
Bro that's deep
---
How do you know he wasn't betting with an alt, farming gold/resources while he sleeps? I'm not saying I know the truth, I'm just saying YOU DON'T.
---
One of my guildmates who was playing 20+hrs a day got hit in that wave.  He started a new account and is now a level 13 after starting his new account...
---
Anyone know if dodging a ban is bannable? lol
---
&gt;Well guess what, that's not the role you chose to take on.
---
You think you’re entitled to the gear you want in a pug 5-man lol. People will roll need on the items they actually need. That’s the entire point of the system. Get over it.
---
If this is the "ban wave" then it fell woefully short. All of the known, admitted bots on my server are still free as birds.
---
&gt; If you were healing and your BiS dropped and the druid tank took it because 'its good for moonkin' you'd be making a post about how it's unfair.
---
...no, I wouldn't, because the Druid can and probably will also use that gear for healing in raids.
---
this was tested and warriors came out ahead by miles
---
Ffs you losers are on my realm now?
---
I've just been scrolling through, haven't been here much today, and I'm seeing all the "banned" posts. Funny to see the banwave taking effect.
---
I wouldn't sweat the professions for now, but having tailoring to get Truefaith is technically is the correct move. Not a huge upgrade from the tier 1 chest tho.
---
Just spend your time getting to level 60 so you can start raiding. Whether or not you enjoy the raiding experience will really decide how much you enjoy the game. I would just try to find a casual guild of nice players who's schedule line up with yours and would be willing to teach you.
---
First interesting post in a long time and instaremoved. Feels bad man.
---
This is where classic is fucked. Compare it to osrs and classic is a sad money grab. Osrs devs want the game to continue to do well and work on it with the players interest as first priority. They change the game in ways that adapts to what their playerbase wants while keeping the spirit of the game alive. 
---
Blizz has no indication of doing this, and I really wish they would take notes from osrs because the future of classic looks really bad with the way it's been handled so far.
---
That’s amazing!
---
Yes they hide behind that but honestly people are pretty lax with their personal security and passwords. You would be surprised even in this day and age with password wallets and key management
---
Zandalar Tribe mybe, fun server with good pve, pvp and rp scene
---
For flair, its back up I flaired
---
Ooo you’re ‘ars 
---
Brent.gif
---
Glad you said it was an alt or I might have thought less of you for being in *gasp* Feralas.
---
Are you saying you got tired of blazing through content with absolutely no challenge or effort?
---
Have you heard of our lord and saviour, off-meta specs?
---
Contrary to popular belief, if you put in the effort you can accomplish some truly amazing feats.
---
For hunters there's melee DPS hunter and hunter tank.
---
For shamans there's elemental shaman and shaman raid tank.
---
I reject your reality and substitute my own.
---
finally, i've seen them eyeballing each other for weeks
---
Wow, the simultaneous double pocket pick, nice one.
---
Seem to care an awful lot here bud. Lmao
---
To the best of what I've been able to tell the damage always goes off at the same rate however the animations may go off at a different point. For example you may notice a wand animation go off rather suddenly, this is the animation catching up.
---
yep, you can do this as you start to move towards the pack too, if any of the mobs initially aggro to you the howl will pull aggro to your pet.
---
On paper it doesn't seem like much of a time saver but in reality it feels so much quicker
---
Yes.
---
Play better or get the honour when horde is focusing on winning.
---
We're playing the same game right?  You've seen the crocodile massacre in durotar haven't you?  Never assume competent programming from blizzard.  They used spawned bunnies as placeholders for escort missions ffs.
---
No. This guy is full of shit and milking Karma.
---
I'm kinda blind and this looked like an AT-AT until I clicked on it.
---
That's kinda fucked lol
---
oh wow, thats pretty interesting actually. been doing it wrong all these years then, and everyone ive been teaming up with for dungeons too, holy shit haha
---
So maybe this will be my main reply explaining botting into this post.
---
Here are a few terms I have to explain:
---
Botbase - a type of bot so to speak, a way to read scritps, made of a specific type of botting: BGs, Dungeons, Professions, Archeology (separate from other profs cause reasons), etc.
---
Script - the specific way you tell a botbase to run. Example: how you make it do your professions, a specific routine for buying ore, prospecting it, making it into JC items, vendoring it, auctioning it, DEing it, mailing others. (My main project did that).
---
Most scripts were like farming routes for ore and herbs.
---
Combat routine - simply how you can make each class/spec do combat. Kind of complex I never bothered but before botting got popular for BGs I would literally be top healer/DPS in every BG I botted so at that point I didn't feel bad. Once it became a problem I stopped because I didn't want to be part of the problem.
---
A decent bot can do anything, simply pick a role, and get it a script, it'll do it.
---
My own scripts did mount farming and JC auctioneering.
---
Been there :(
---
Rekt
---
I believe one of the problems is the shear amount of botters (mainly low quality botters) is compromising the more sophisticated ones that would previously go unnoticed. Either through farming the same areas or sharing some similar patterns.
---
From a technical perspective, it's really not hard to identify bots in this day and age. I'd certainly say that botting is worse this time round.
---
this is actually video
---
How much more mana will I get from innervate with 50 spirit? Having mana problems as boomkin but if I pop the DM beer (+25 spirit) and a gizzard gum (+25 spirit) it could be pretty good mana from innervate, but I don't know the formulas or anything. thx
---
Not fooling anyone kid. Enjoy your time served.
---
Are you talking about AV afkers? Easy to catch lol
---
Maybe go to a close higher level zone like EPL/WPL for honour or farming essences of water.
---
Your brain is the trainwreck if you think that analogy is relevant in any manner.
---
Disagree. Paladin is #1 braindead leveler, followed by lock.
---
You'd be surprised how much shit your pet gets you into as a hunter leveling
---
Handful of posts here on the subreddit starting about ten hours ago.
---
There's no perma silence (from what I've experienced), I've been silenced for 1, 3, 7, 15, and now 30 days chronologically
---
Would I buy this
---
You can also use a wind serpent for this.  The ranged attack works wonders for pulling safely.
---
if you are using it right now for raids you are already failing because there are better options from dungeons let alone untill naxx
---
Pretty sure they were just seeing who can blow the biggest fart bubbles.
---
Lol nice comeback. Basically "no u". It doesn't take a psychologist to see you have issues. Normal people aren't raging assholes. Good luck with your baggage, mate.
---
Handful of posts on the sub maybe ten hours ago suggested there was a ban wave.
---
Obligatory "South Canada" comment!
---
Oh for bots absolutely, I’m talking about people AFKing through AV and such rather than attempting to even play the game. Very different problem altogether.
---
\- What is love? Baby don't hurt me...
---
What's the gear swap addon called?
---
Yeah, while other casters scale with good spell power coef and crit scaling, shadow priests has problems with both. They have really good talents including 10% spell hit and that makes them good now but they fall behind later.
---
My mage is currently level 48, I've been leveling through soloing the graveyards in ZF since about 44. Is sticking to ZF the way to go until BRD, or is Maraudon better for experience?
---
&gt;The focus on running around the actual world was the most dynamic, true MMO content imo
---
I actually totally agree with this. I wasn't expecting to be as bothered as I am, but damn.....It was really good being in an interactive world. It's still there, but to a much lesser degree. Kinda miss it.
---
And the fastest way to 60 is to  kick rocks to lvl 45....
---
Baron Geddon drops them everytime for us...
---
I can see why those prices of essence of water spiked now.
---
Mmmm, I like a little copypasta for dinner.
---
Is it possible to get 325?
---
Didn’t even think of this if you didn’t need the threat. Nice, unless you need rage dump but there’s always HS for that I guess. +1
---
Do hunters need much gear for tribute runs? Leveling an alt for gold farming and idk how much I have to gear him.
---
nah it won't work with a wind serpent
---
Yep. dagger warr can do massive single target dps. The only downside is that your cleave dps won't be as good as that of other warriors using Deathbringer or 2handers, but that's it.
---
The difference shouldn't be huge though. Enjoy op!
---
FYI, blizzard will probably tell you that the appeal has been denied 
---
and the decision is final (they pretty much always do). 
---
Its not really final.
---
You need to keep escalating/opening tickets until they fix it. Preferably call in and talk to a real person assuming they deny you via email, and don't let them hang up until its been sorted. Keep asking to talk to someone higher up, if the first people can't or wont help you.
---
&gt; I personally don't think good farming bots do that much damage to the community.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this. My intention with Classic was to live in the open world and farm materials to make a living. However, as bots have been so abundant, the farms I was looking forward to completing are worthless. Same example with fishing. I was looking forward to fishing (I enjoy it) and could make a pretty penny off what I caught. However as fishing bots have destroyed the market, it's not worth me doing. So I cannot engage in part of the game I was most looking forward to. As a result, I am genuinely considering if I want to continue playing. I am literally being pushed out of the game by cheaters.
---
If you can find a priest healer buddy you should team up with them and go soul link spec. Run around with voidwalker on passive with soul link. Your rotation is to multidot then hellfire.
---
Warrior tanks can't keep up with warlock threat while leveling so you gotta step up and tank.
---
It was, big part of why I enjoyed it. Making my own "big time" script that got a couple hundred downloads made me so excited.
---
Before botting really died people started charging money for scripts and that reaaaaly killed it.
---
30 stacks is nothing for a professional AV player
---
How does it break the ToS to not give banned users any recourse to get their prepaid subs back? Nothing in the ToS says you have any right to a refund. But, several times in the ToS it explicitly states you can and will be banned for violating the ToS. 
---
If you don't want to lose your prepaid sub time don't be a cheating cunt, it's that simple.
---
Thanks for the diagnosis man, so it’s ‘asshole’. Is this in any medical journals, what should I do to fix it? What are the symptoms? Appreciate the help, just trying to fix these issues I have thanks again buddy. Should I contact a psychologist and ask for treatment on ‘aashole’?
---
My brother botted back in Vanilla/BC. The bot he used was pretty amazing honestly, especially when you see some today that are obvious bots.  
---
You could input your own APL ("rotation"), have it emote/talk to people looking out for keywords with different responses, log out if it gets ganked, HS with full bags and logout etc (assuming grinding bot not levelling). You had different "paths" for it, and could have it change direction - you could enable attacking (or avoiding) of other players (initiating combat not just attacking when attacked), so it looked less like a bot. It damn well got some kills too!  
---
Makes you wonder wtf bots are doing today when you see them running around so blatantly. Zero effort bots I suppose.
---
This is giving me ideas on how to skip my next raid. Nice!
---
If all they got was a 3 day suspension for a first offense, the number of people using them would skyrocket.
---
Yet they were getting away with it until very very recently. Shit was insane to me. People willing to throw away hundreds of hours of work to get a couple lotus or essences.
---
Healer need to go on a strike, we are not gonna run dungeon for free anymore!!!
---
I understand what you are saying. I cast some doubt about what should be one priorities. I think Hobbies or Work can a be top priority for someone, if they feel fulfilled by it. Hobby probably does not feel fulfilling for the guy here.
---
The idea is that gearing MUST suck for everybody, I guess.
---
Absolutely based and dead server pilled
---
I've been lotus farming, if someone is running to take the lotus just let them clear out the mobs and sap them.
---
doubt blizzard pays them enough to issue a 2007scape tier post
---
I think I explained it in that comment but to make it more simple:
---
bots help create a good crafters market but fuck farmers.
---

---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/classicwow) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I browse this sub alot and i dont recall seeing sucha posts..
---
They're pretty funny tho
---
My guess is a slap on the wrist ban for AFKing in AVs or people who bought gold.
---
I saw plenty of the bots on the server just a few hours ago doing DM, and other awkward keyboard turning patrols all over Feralas.
---
What's your MC speedrun record then? I am sure you can improve that.
---
I wasn't rank farming, I was trying to get exalted so I could use the unstoppable force. If I had been botting I wouldn't have such shitty honor gains
---
I 'm on Gandling and in my guild the raid slots are full at each MC, we put 2 groups on Ony, but no I still have guildmates saying the game will be dead in 3 months because BGs queue are longer now.
---
It's only good advice for people who want painfully slow leveling with bad tanks.
---
Our warlock friend should look into soul link tanking.
---
"You're a healer you can only take healing gear for your main spec"
---
I'm healing because I can and I need both sets of gear. If you want me to take only healing gear then after this run we can reset the instance and you get a new healer while I play DPS and get the other set of gear.
---
In which case I would agree with you. However I would still contest that is unhealthy for the game overall.
---
&gt;You found 3 cases out of the entire player base, so fucking what lol
---
Seriously? You think that's 3 cases out of the entire playerbase?
---
Yes, you are.
---
Where is the right one’s hand?
---
Where were you yesterday man? I saw at least 4 different posts and I don't even check that often.
---
druids with leader of the pack and nature swiftness. need just 1 point more for that
---
sorry, bad joke lol. i meant since undercity is the place of undeads, aka dead people, then theres probably a lot of ghosts too, making it a ghost town lol
---
People really post their sad bot stories here? wow..
---
It's hilarious because he seriously overestimated how much people cared for him.
---
Now, rather than being a fast leveler, his legacy is that everyone thinks he's a giant dick.
---
And in that comment I also explained the benefit and the downside of it.
---
The upside: cheaper mats = cheaper items = more geared people.
---
The downside: less money spent on goldsinks. Basically in Classic it means less Epic mounts.
---
Its weird...its almost like blizzard designed the looting system to not be tied into specific classes or roles.  Your unwritten "rules" or "norms" are just made up.  The rules of the game are very clear.
---
Im glad, ik I have no proof but this really sucks from my perspective. I led a small guild, worked my ass off recruiting, and logged in to suddenly find myself banned for half a year completely unexpectedly. Im gonna wait for my appeal results, and keep escalating because I know that I didnt bot, and I know that they will see that if they take a closer look. So hopefully I can make a vindication post soon lmao.
---
Baby don't hurt me
---
Sounds like an anecdotal experience to be honest, I have yet to encounter anything like this.
---
I agree it's lame, However, you're free to play with other people.
---
my team is asia rank 4 , but i really want to play new thing
---
Yeah but there isnt much reason for it to drastically change since.
---
The difference is that your pet doesn't get hit when pulling. It doesn't carry the risk of being dazed. And while you're right that it doesn't pull the group instantly, it does pull more reliably.
---
"Ok, just gonna tab out a second to change my music, alright, done, let's go back to- shit, why am I dead?"
---
Very different meaning when broken up, I like it.
---
I did not wipe yet because of my issues. I am trying ti find the best aggro/dps ratio. It depends hugely on the healer tank ofcourse. I’ll try ad much not to annoy them:).
---
Shakira Shakira
---
Well better geared people with more resources doesn't mean much to those of us who cannot engage in the activities we enjoy.
---
A lot of people care less about gear and more about interaction with with environment (game). Many of us don't care for instant-gratification and prefer the tribulations.
---
For me, I'd rather be able to fish and gradually earn the consumables (or gold), than have it given to me at a fraction of the price.
---
Did most of my lv40 mount money with these. They are super easy to farm as you don't need pools for them. Drop rate from "normal water" is pretty high. And as those are one of most popular costume items in game, they will always sell.
---
Your #1 limitation to your boss damage is going to be weapon skill.  Having 305 represents a 10% dps boost for your character.   So you want to chase that.
---
Humans get weapon skill. Since you don't.  You have to gear a little more smart.
---
DW any blue weapons will outdps 2h fury for Alliance for single target.  But if you can get an Obsidan Edged Blade from MC, It's actually quite decent, that +8 Weapon Skill is a massive dps boost against level 63 bosses. But think of it as a AOE/trash weapon, and temporary until you can do one of the following:
---
Your best budget option is daggers.  Get a muggers belt, and/or distracting dagger from Dire Maul. And a good blue 1h dagger.  Then in MC you can get the Ancient Corehound Gloves to replace one of those, and get the nice dagger drops, that also, no one else really wants.
---
Second option is to get a Expert Goldminer's Helm (check the AH, it's a rare item, i got mine for 15g or farm it).  And go Axes.  This is a good budget alternative to Edgemasters. You can then get Deathbringers off Ony or two other good blue axes.
---
The final is the expensive option. Is to just get Edgemasters.  Edgemasters are expensive, but they are BIS for fury dps for non-humans/orcs.  You will get them and never replace them for the lifetime of Classic. Going edgemasters is better than using the Goldminer's helm for no other reason than it frees up your helm spot for Lionheart Helm, which is the BIS dps helm for classic. Plus it lets you use daggers, axes or swords, freeing up a lot of good gearing options.
---
It’s that and Scourgestones... and this is why people recommend saving all quests and stones until revered.  It’s extremely tough to hit exalted if you don’t.
---
My post is about the ban wave that just happened and the hordes of players talking about being falsely banned
---
can confirm this, 4-5 post screaming i got banned for afk and watching netflix
---
Baby don't hurt me.
---
Its the default blizz ui, you can change some stuff in the settings to your liking..
---
For example: I am using ShadowUF but keeping the default blizz ui for raid frames..
---
0 TOEP, 0 choker, 0 spell power ring, and 1 mana igniting cord. Luckily we have had very good luck with mageblade.
---
I think the reason they were getting away with it until recently is because Blizz bans in waves to avoid making it obvious what triggered a ban, so it's harder for bot makers to fix what made Blizz react to it
---
Yes. I did that last night. It was awesome. Pally had to drink after each pull tho, but pulling multiple groups we made short work of them. We had pally, mage, druid heal and shadowpriest so it worked very well.
---
GET SOME!
---
I edited my reply during your reply, but I'll make it into a new comment:
---
If sources from 3 months isnt considered good enough, then your information is not good enough as well.. As you clearly state as well is years old.
---
This rule makes no sense, this is why no one does it. The example you have used is insane since tanking warrior will naturally get tanking gear and reserve DPS gear as well.
---
It will spike in p5 and p6
---
Im not cheating i just watch 20 hours of netflix a day. If blizz didnt want us to fish they shouldnt have made water in av. Obviously the temp is above freezing.
---
**NOT CONDONING BOTTING
---
**
---
Botters don't really stop you from progressing on your own
---
**NOT CONDONING BOTTING**
---
You are totally right. Smartass bullshiters come uo with those said conventions that favors thenselves and don't give a fuck that if that shados priest didn't want to heal or that dps warrior didn't want to tank there would be no fucking dungeon run.
---
Yeah fishing 30 stacks of Nightin is easy lol those arent always bots
---
Someone else problem? Me dumb dumb not set up personal profile, use default. False ban? Watafaka me no understando.
---
Me af 🤣🤣
---
Thing is, its not only about price and demand, its also what ammount of supply there is. And theres probably going to be a lot, so i guess unless there is a guild that buys them all and crashes the market, it will be around the same price as it is now after a few days.
---
Now, that is the most likely scenario, but it depends on the ammount of players in your server and how many times they will wipe :P
---
I use COR more then agony lately. Depends on the group really. If i see aggro on the healer I death coil searing pain. I rarely give out heathstones. Only when people ask for it. It is a bit tedious. SS is always up.
---
No heavy dark iron ring for like. 6 runs.
---
No bracers of stability.
---
One single QSR.
---
I'm a sad kitty druid. :(
---
If you join a dungeon run as a healer, it’s commonly expected that you will be rolling on healer gear. Unless you specify that you want to roll on dps gear or you are after a specific item, I would think it was a bit of a pisstake to roll on a dps item.
---
I don’t have cos yet. I am waiting for it bigtime tho.
---
Fuck off, don’t ruin the game for other people. Go try out scripts and bots in a single player game.
---
2 options came into my mind for the need for underwear
---
Either, you shit yourself, cus you are scared the idea of it 
---
Or, i really dont wanna talk about this option ^^
---
Well, actually.... the guys getting banned now might have done the same thing as you have, near launch. This IS the first ban wave in classic, right. They might have been gathering shit from launch and now mass ban them.
---
Would explain the fact that "ive done nothing wrong...." comments, they cont connect what they have done long time ago to ban they got now.
---
Yeah. I live bosses. SB crits rule and I don’t even have ruin yet.
---
Classic is more popular than any other MMORPG out there. That includes Retail and FFXIV.
---
FFXIV approximation of players when Shadowbringer launched was around 1.7 to a max of 2 million active players. Some put this figure at a 2.2 million, which can be real, but I hardly think it is. Retail WoW active player base should be around the same numbers of FFXIV, around 2.2 million active players.
---
Now Classic, when it launched (the first week, because a number of servers were added due to how freakin popular it was) had about 112 servers worldwide. Those servers were all FULL, during the first week, with the PvP and PvE ones (which were 90% of the servers) experiencing queues of 10 to 15k players.
---
Those queues were ON TOP of the layers. While we don't know with how many layers the Classic server launched, nor the amount of players per layer, we can have a pretty good estimate, based on key announcements by Blizzard, regarding server capacity and expected dropout in time.
---
I would say that each Classic server launched with at least 5 layers, to counter the expected (which didn't happened) player dropout of 80% at least, with some servers (like Faerlina, Whitemane, Shazzrah, Golemag, etc.) probably having 6 or more layers.
---
We can also assume that each layer had at the very least 3k players capacity.
---
So, overall, when Classic launched, it did with almost 100 servers having 5 layers, with 3k players each, and an additional 10-15k in queues (or even more for a handful or servers), with the rest of the servers (the RP ones) having 5 layers, but minimal or no queues.
---
A conservative number of players for Classic, at launch, should have been at around 3 million players, worldwide, if the number of layers was 5 (it was most likely higher) and the layer capacity was 3k players (it was much higher, because when layering went off, the queues reappeared, and the number of players was easily over 5k on most realms).
---
A more realistic number should be 5k players per layer, with 6 layers per server, for 112 servers, which will amount to around 2,8 million players in-game, with around 1.5 million more in queues, at launch, which ends up at around  4.3 million players overall.
---
Now, whether it was 3 million, or over 4 million, it doesn't really matter. The number was probably between 3 and 4 million players, at Classic launch.
---
Anyone who played Vanilla, especially on high populated server, would absolutely see that the server population of a Classic server today, after layering was removed, is much, MUCH, higher than whatever was on a high pop server in Vanilla. 
---
There is no way in hell that Classic doesn't still have well over 2 million players today, simply because the concurrent player to total player ratio is 1 to 5, which means that at least 400k players are concurrent in Classic, over 112 servers. Which is around 3.5 concurrent players per Classic server....TODAY.
---
And that is a totally unrealistic number, because easily, EASILY, there are almost twice that number on a buttload of servers. Heck, even a "Medium" Classic server have today much more players than any Vanilla server, which was around 3.5k concurrent players.
---
Classic, in the "worst" case scenario, have a player base equal to FFXIV or Retail WoW, and in the "best" case scenario, twice the number of FFXIV or Retail.
---
The reality is that there are probably around 600-700k concurrent Classic players (which means around 3 to 3.5 million total players), with FFXIV and Retail WoW having a similar number of around 400-500k concurrent (which means around 2 to 2.5 million total players).
---
People see that there are less players in Classic, compared to launch, but they fail to realize HOW MANY were at launch, assuming Classic have less players than FFXIV or Retail WoW.
---
Classic was, and still is, the no.1 MMORPG today. And it will stay there until at least AQ.
---
Greedy bots get caught. 
---
Setting it to stop if someone is in range saves most reports. Kill the mob your on then sit eat drink and don’t get back up until the person leaves. 
---
It slows you down but why care when it’s just the bot. 
---
Even if you get attacked just looks like you went AFK to get a drink or something after the last kill.
---
Your friend probably wasnt cheating. I got a 6 month suspension for botting/cheating and ive never botted in my life. had my Blizz account for 7+ years and played SC2/Hots/WoW/retail/D3 and never botted. Blizzard has been fucking up and banning the wrong people. I made a forum post a few others on there said they'd been wrongly suspended as well.
---
Haha got ya.
---
On my server at least, the reagents are adding up to virtually the same price as the crafted item because the market is so heavily flooded by regents added by said bots.
---
Love the disrespect backpeddle at 4:05
---
At least find a thread where somebody with working hands got banned. This dude entirely relies on software that is very close to botting so it was an unpleasant case of banning what's actualy a player but needs a lot of asistance to play.
---
And yes in a few thousand bans there will be a few wrongful ones. That cannot be prevented but the number is for sure less than 1%. However the number of wrongfuly banned people is way smaller than the amount of "I was wrongfuly banned" posts here and on official forums.
---
I don't have problems with Stalagg. I'm still here, and its working for me. 
---
I don't even know what the point of your message is, its like you read some website about how to respond to someones post with a trope or fallacy but forgot the important point of reading the original post.
---
Right there with ya bud. I dont even PVP i'm just a resto shaman who raids lol. And I got a 6 month suspension for botting. Funny thing; I typically raid log the past few weeks.
---
You maybe could have phrased it as "offspec healing gear that healer does not need".
---
Doing a dungeon for the 100th time as healer and trying to get a +healing piece, the only piece of gear you need from the entire dungeon, people can get stingy if someone else in a 5man group is rolling for it - at max level, at least. Farming in resto spec is shitty enough to begin with outside of niche methods, ad having to compete with a random DPS for healing gear in a 5man dungeon on top of that is actually really shitty. But if the guy is sensible and agreed not to go for that one piece you still need? Go ahead, my man!
---
But beeing AFK is not the same as botting tho
---
Lucky you! I walk into groups of mobs and die.
---
Just a troll
---
Romantic &lt;3
---
“I farm a lot on my hunter listening to an audiobook and don't pay attention to the game“.
---
We both know you don’t get banned for eating a sand which..
---
I just solo farmed these as shadow, much less hassle
---
You are correct that he did say that but he didn’t include how many pugs he periodically joins and how much time on average those run so I thought adding a few extra minutes for those would make sense and settled on 18.
---
I got a 6 month suspension for botting and have never botted or cheated in my life and have had my account for 7+ years for various blizz games lol. I reported like 10+ bots on my server. My friend last night said they're still there LOL meanwhile im suspended till July pending an appeal....
---
thanks blizz
---
Well the synergy of SL/SL doesn't need to be demonstrated anymore. Add to it Ruin and 2 instant nukes and I believe you have a pretty potent class.
---
very nice. where is this spot if I may ask?
---
Welcome to classic
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ehuzoj/account_suspended_for_alleged_botting_3rd_party/
---
No more.
---
He locked it out? Like no one else could loot it? Is that cause he wasn't in their raid anymore after they kicked him or...?
---
No you're right, its 95% twinks... happends if they release it after most ppl reach 60.
---
Not saying twink vs twink is bad tho, those can be fun matches too.... but its not like the old days where you are the god if you enter with ur twink rogue.
---
I think it's when it lands tbh, because in retail if I use an ability that increases damage by 30% after I cast  the spell it still increases. And if it fades before the ability lands it doesn't.
---
Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
---
If you watch long enough they fight bubbles.

Rip you
---
Blizzard does not have free reign to see every single thing running on your computer. You need to check your facts.
---
Warlock damage, at least compared to the almost any other class, is supbar especially if you're not destro.
---
To get enough damage from DoTs you have to them tick for 10+ seconds(which almost never happens as an alliance lock) in which time a mage/rogue/warrior does about 10x more damage, killing you.
---
Only way to really burst people down is coil + SB + shadowburn which doesn't happen as often simply using DoTs.
---
If he can’t find groups as shadow, and is always “forced” to heal, is shadow really his main spec?
---
I think the only one is the leather healing shoulders from Majordomo. We've had something like 8 mageblades, 5 bindings, 2 BREs, 3 cauterizing bands, several viskags and our first onslaught belt dropped yesterday. 
---
So I guess we'll see nothing but black ash robes from BWL.
---
Wait for 2 weeks when grizzly controls the top brackets and the world bosses because most people can't compete with them lol
---
They will pull the plug on it before they start going the exact same route they went through 10+ years ago.
---
Why would they ever make retail 2.0 with everything the same? It doesn't make sense. WoW is their cash cow that will be milked for the next few years but it's obvious even Blizzard is tired of it at this point and wants new projects.
---
Never too late. Tons of people with alts still playing and enjoying the game. I definitely recommend coming back to the game! Best of luck.
---
I would suggest a lock over a hunter. There is no need to look after your pet. It is basically your slave. 
---
A paladin is easy as well altough it can be boring.
---
blizzard is usually pretty sensitive with bans especially for first time offenders. 
---
 i remember exploiting something in bfa and got a 3 day suspension while others got a month for the same offense. i know people who got 6months for multiple rmt offenses, but then you have reckful with his permabanned acc for account sharing.(prob changed their policy after it, but he cant his acc back now)
---
personally, we lack too much information for the current situation and these speculations + blizzard apologists talking out of their ass makes the situation hard to grasp. 
---
honestly, if someone claims more than 6months then he better show some proof.
---
Hi all! Happy (early) New Years!
---
About a week or two ago I asked what support class I could play — after much appreciated advice I went with the Shaman, but it felt a bit overwhelming to me as a new player. That, and I dearly missed being a Forsaken (seriously, female Undead are fucking cool haha).
---
So I’m thinking between a Mage and Warlock now. I love to support, even more so than shining myself. I don’t like to try hard at all, and I like being able to move around. I suck at many keybinds (whenever I pvp with more than 5 buttons all my interface panels show up lol). 
---
Which class between the two would suit my needs? I feel like a Warlock is insanely fun with just DoT, fear and letting them rot away — whereas the Mage brings a lot of fun movement with it. Which one is ‘easier’ for casual PvE and PvP? 
---
Thanks!
---
Or maybe blizzard screwed up this once, I got caught in the ban wave and have never botted. Unless you count healbot of course.
---
Just go to a server with alot of population and you will not have trouble finding a group. This is especially true for a rp server.
---
&gt;There seem to be a lot of poorly written bots today because when I botted my characters couldn't be honor farmed. They'd wait to rez after a PVP death and give up after 2. They'd target and /dance with players who passed by. They'd randomly jump and sit and they wouldn't eat to full health.. they'd act human. Today it doesn't feel like that's the case.
---
Do you not think this was because, back in those days people would have like 1 bot due to hardware limitations. Meaning they could always jump on and take control if they needed to. Now, people can have 20 bots running at the same time, and they can't monitor / take over as effectively.
---
Its also perfectly plausible it was a mistake. I got suspended and I've never botted in my life. I only raid log to heal.
---
I have level 60 characters on 3 different realms. Faerlina, Grobbulus, Earthfury.
---
Faerlina: it’s got the occasional drama but if you want to get things done quickly and never run into bad players this is the server to be, a lot of dedicated competitive players.
---
Grobbulus: this server has the best community in classic hands down, they have a daytime UBER service, community events everyday. Everyone is super nice. One downside I run into is that many players are very casual on this server, it takes time to get things done and a lot of them don’t know how to play “properly”.
---
Earthfury: Smaller server with strong guilds on both sides, as someone who has played through actual vanilla this is the closest it gets to it, smaller population more tight knit community.
---
Was reserving gear in 5mans this always this common or is it just because so many are grinding preraid bis?
---
Your entire reasoning is based on gold.
---
I am sorry, but I am one of those "idiot titan cow", with Quel'Serrar and Edgemasters (I also have HoJ, Accuria and other shinies), and I am telling you one thing : my threat (as Impale Prot) is on par or higher with Fury/Prot Warriors that have whatever gear you think they can get best, but no Edgemaster's.
---
Sure, if I wouldn't had Edgematers, I would probably lose like 20-25% of my threat, but this is not the point.
---
The point is that Quel'Serrar with Edgemaster's, beats any other weapon combo with Edgemaster's, because the high-end damage (thanks to weapon skill) is far higher than any other tanking weapon, and the DPS is well balanced, being a 2.0 speed weapon.
---
Daggers are all fine and cool, but in current content, when initial threat is king, no current dagger beats QS. Dumping threat with Quel'Serrar is no issue, I actually have to use rage pots most of the time, because I am rage starved.
---
So, not only that my threat is on par or higher than most Fury/Prot tanks, but I am also much more tankier.
---
There many better tanking weapons than Quel'Serrar...but not in current content, and especially with Edgemaster's.
---
If GOLD is the issue, than yeah, you are right.
---
But I am not going to put gold before guild progress, and trust me here, a tank with QS and Edgemasters (and properly specced, not Fury/Prot) is invaluable for raid progress.
---
This guy even respeced to get a group and hunt his items. If you want something so badly just create a group and reserve it ?
---
You remember them sweet /stopcast macros back in the day for efficiency?
---
It's like you are incapable independent thought and accountability.
---
I've recreated it three times now and have a video capture of each time. It's pretty obvious by now.
---
That's why you taunt on pull so you have 3 seconds to get way more threat than any dps can create. It's not a very hard concept.
---
They can also fart big bubbles which float and they wave them with hands or weapon.
---
It does indeed work fine for me. Try updating your addons, or enabling out of date addons and using it anyway.
---
Because monitoring processes that interact with wow.exe is not the same as monitoring your entire computer?
---
I have to +1 this reply

They literally do, Warden is literally spyware in all but name. It has the ability to check not simply everything currently in memory, but also your browser history and stored cookies as well. You consent to all of this, including your personal information being taken in this manner, in the EULA.
---
Where do I get this as Alliance?
---
No, PvE wise it peaks in ZG as its the best raid in the game. While AB is the best BG they ever made.
---
Not real pusbback, the animation your Charakter plays when getting hit is preventing the wand animation from starting, but dmg still goes just as fast
---
I've noticed names are being added/removed on my friends list in game constantly. Anyone know what is causing this? It's quite annoying.
---
RemindMe! 14 days “Still not unbanned”
---
Haha good one
---
How would they know what process interacts with wow.exe?
---
sure, like all the other 'innocent' people who get banned in every ban wave ever.

I’m a dw fury warrior on a pve server with mining and engineering. So far engineering hasn’t been great with the exception of gnomish battle chicken and even then it’s sort of meh. What other engie stuff should

I be making to increase my dps or raid utility. Should I respec to goblin?
---
Seriously. Are people complaining about this? They are even sadder then I thought.
---
Iiiiiiits time for the wetlands Olympics!!!
---
https://youtu.be/PMJsGaQw8Zc
---
Its not tit for tat, both issues should be resolved.
---
P2's was by introducing BG's, now P3's should be by stopping Ally premades.
---
Pretty much the only fight in the game you actually use defensive gear on.
---
What was he doing? Autoattacking with a 2h is ridiculously slow, I leveled 2h swords by just spamming hamstrings or sunders
---
Whenever I level alts I will kill everything I see while running from place to place. Could've been anything. Last week or so I spent tons of time just grinding out leveling my hunter.
---
What would you even farm in deadwing pass?
---
Yes they can haha. Doesn’t mean they’d scale with a B.B./CHT like a warr/Rogue will
---
I do that for dungeons level 50+. I assume people want leveling gear in lower level stuff even if they're healing.
---
Swiftthistle. Since you're 20 you can scour Barrens and Stonetalon mountains and pick every Briarthorn you see.
---
On my server they go for 70-80 silver per piece and it's insane. I just picked herbs while leveling and from 18-30 I picked enough Swiftthistles to make 40g from them alone.
---
Why does every post about a loot system that doesn’t give trials gear devolve into a cascade of “hurrr durrr sounds like a shit system”.  What guild worth a shit is going to let an applicant take priority in gear over core raiders?
---
Clearly a shit system to give the people who have put in time with the guild already get gear over a new guy.
---
or mybe mod shadow banned/muted him
---
Get a goblin engi to make you sappers. Use dense dynamite for aoe packs where you don't want to waste sapper.
---
The same people sympathizing with this are the ones who jump down your throat when you ask people to report AFKs in AV. Either they’re doing it too and want to make it socially acceptable in the community, or they’re so colossally stupid that they’d rather defend the people who are literally stealing honor from them than seem like a “tryhard” who doesn’t want to reward people for abusing the system. It blows my mind when I ask for an AFK report in AV and 3-4 people reliably jump to the defense of the AFK guy. Do people just like being taken advantage of, or what?
---
Good chance they found out no guild needs 100 deep prot warriors
---
Sulfuras horde don't want them either and won't work with them.  Nobody is worried about these fools.  They will learn their place and fall in line.
---
Why?
---
It's got a large population, it's relatively balanced, it's got a ton of guilds on all levels, and it's the most relevant server. The only thing bad about it is the queues, but those are really easy to skip.
---
imo zf until 50-52 and then get boosted or aoe farming in group/world until 56 then DME to 60.
---
Oily blackmouth used to be 12-13s/per on my server until some botters starter selling them 80 stacks of them for 5s, every 3 days or so they'd put up 80 stacks. A few days later they put up 80 stacks for 2.1s/per. Blackmouth priced still haven't recovered...
---
Out of how many turns?
---
Actually so sick of reading this. I MT for my guild and we don't require any special consumables but some of our rogues and warriors bring them anyways to flex on meters (which is fine), doing upwards of 700 or so dps. They don't steal threat. I use QS and spam sunder to proc WF, the top end dmg+the rage gained from bigger hits enable me to spam more HS/SS/Revenges.
---
I think there are some people who legit do not understand that using a keyboard macro to keep yourself from going AFK is essentially the same as botting. And a lot of those people are the ones who are confused why they're getting banned.
---
Sorry it didn't work out for you! 
---
When it comes to utility to your friends:
---
Mages bring portals and water/food, which your friends will be super happy with. 
---
Warlocks bring summons and health stones. Which is also handy. Warlocks also get a free mount, which is nice. 
---
Mage DPS in dungeons and raids is extremely easy. Warlocks is also not very hard, but will generally not surpass mages in damage. 
---
For PvP, I don't know. Someone else can contribute. 
---
I think Mage is easiest to learn. I like warlock better myself.
---
ZT is great!
---
Good job on missing the point. No one cares if a rogue rolls on rogue loot
---
If you are in a guild that's so new that most of this gear isn't rotting by now it's fair to say they aren't very elite.
---
I agree on the QS stuff you mentioned that being said if a fury/prot had edgemasters there’s no way you’d be close to their threat they don’t need rage pots, and also once you get the gear to support it fury/prot is better rage generation, same survivability (maybe slightly less) and more damage, and more threat, maybe your comparing to someone who doesn’t have QS and edgemasters like yourself
---
RIP
---
If it's a hardcore guild then it seems fair, they need dedication and commitment. Why give loot to someone they dont know over a regular. 
---
If its casual then it seems pretty BS. I wouldn't mind waiting 3 weeks if I was still getting dkp. I joined a pug and got 3 pieces in 1 week as a Hpal.
---
Healer does not need 100% mana before every pull.  Also I can pull while the healer is still drinking.  If I take a little too much damage I’ll pop a cool down or health potion.  These healers, and especially DPS that think they need to be constantly topped off on mana are so boring to run with.
---
I actually enjoy AV somehow lol
---
Do you enjoy your dungeon runs taking an hour longer than they have to?
---
&gt; We’re talking about a puggable raid with 25 people.
---
Then they can go pug it for gear, we loot ban trials down to a priority of below pvp rolls for rankers (above a certain rank). Like you said we'd DE a huge chunk of the drops in MC so they are still getting loot. It's more about the principal of weeding out players that would come in and bail when the going gets tougher in later raids. We also require trials to show up full raid consume and world buffed while they are on trial status for the same reason.
---
Quel'Serrar is trash.
---
Edgemaster's is trash, and is required to wear Quel'Serrar.
---
Why would you have to double down on shit items.
---
Daggers are literally better for the pull since you can dump rage faster on initial pull. 
---
Impale Prot is also trash. You don't even touch any decent Fury Prot in this game, and it's a shittier spec compared to just regular Deep Prot.
---
You have no fucking clue what you're talking about and should go read a guide on how this game works. Stop suggesting anyone waste 1k gold on worthless items that are beated by dungeon blues.
---
All the goblin stuff is BoE so it can be made for you by a friend. I wouldn’t spend the dough respeccing
---

No, I just know exactly what you wrote.
---
boar or bear....they eat anything you have as long as its level appropriate.
---
The point still stands that I was banned for a separate issue that I am innocent of. If they handed me a month or 2 month ban for AFKing, I would accept that because its something I actually did.
---
This is them accusing me of a bigger offense, with a heftier punishment, all while I havent actually violated this rule.
---
If my friend assaults a guy, I would want him to be charged for assault, not a triple homicide that happened 5 counties over with no evidence or connection to my friend, because one is something he/she DID, and the other is a major crime that they didnt commit.
---
Noone is entitled to anything.
---
If you go dungeon as a dps, you are not entitled to reserve gear for yourself. Its up to the others if they want to join your group or not. If you manage to get a group together anyways, good for you. They dont get to roll on your reserved stuff. 
---
If you go dungeon as a healer and druid tank says he will roll for healing gear because he is hotw ns literally with intention of finding groups fast to gear up his main spec (resto) then tough shit. You can choose yo wait around another 1min-1hour+ depending on luck for another tank or you can just let him roll for his gear.
---
If you go a dungeon as a tank, with intention to gear up for dps and reserve loot, you are not entitled for people to come join your group.
---
What im trying to say is that people from both sides tend to be butthurt regardless of situation. Some people are butthurt about others reserving items (in a run they presumably want to join partially or entirely for that items i guess?) and others get butthurt when people complain about reserved items in a way as if they were entitled to others people time. People are not playing the game to gear you up. They are playing the game to gear themselves up.
---
You are not FORCED to take in a healer in your group that want tank or dps items, you are CHOOSING to save your own and up to 3 others' people time.
---
You are not FORCED to take in a tank in your group that want healer or dps items, you sre CHOOSING to savr your own and up to 3 others' people time.
---
Realistically this doesnt even apply to dps. They are almost never hard to find for any end game dungeon. If you are playing dps in dungeon you probably know the pain of finding a group. If you can tank or heal you should probably tell the grouo that you are flexible in order to save time but will roll for items you want from any spec that's realistic for your class.
---
My take is that you are dps, butthurt about the massive discrepancy of dps/tank and dps/heal for end game dungeons making it hard for you to even get into a group (hint: if you actually do the work of creating a group you can get into dungeons faster, some people are too lazy to do it themselves.) Because of this you feel that you should at least be entitles to "your items". Well guess what, tough shit. You say that and they replace you with another guy of the same class, probably better than you in general that is ok with the loot rules. And the best part? It doesnt even take them a minute after posting in LFG to find your replacement!
---
Happy new year dude!
---
Dude there are some real fucking weirdos on here you just have to ignore them. People definitely got banned unfairly during this and its pretty fucked up.
---
There are a lot of preference choices for shi vs Stan at 19 many rogues in my twink guild have both agi and start sets. That being said you wanna aim for a minimum of 1200 health imo
---
Yes, he raids as Shadow.
---
Just like how invis pots were gonna skyrocket once DM was launched, they actually dropped like 70% because people stockpiled them. Or how engineering trinkets, bombs, FaPs and other PvP consumables pretty much are worth 1/4 of what they were before p2 or BGs were launched. 
---
Sure, you can probably make money IF you hold until phase 5/6, but unless you bought them for 30-40g you're gonna lose money on most servers in time for BWL.
---
Honestly my problem might have been that I wasn't AFK ENOUGH. I would go afk, but then also follow the pack and get kills and loot armor scraps etc. So I wasn't contributing/being as active as most players, but I also wasnt just blatantly afk the whole game, so maybe they thought my shitty subpar performance indicated that I was a bot :/
---
This is how YouTube works too.  One of the bigger Youtubers like Punkrat will post “sell this item it’s good gold” and suddenly that item becomes total dog shit because 250,000 just heard about it.
---
Sunder is optimal for threat rotation. You probably lose aggro cuz you're spamming HS or DPS are too awful for threat to matter.
---
JAMFLEX PLS
---
"
---
I can tell you a few things about Shadowpanther to help you make a decision. 
---
* CHT outweighs Felstriker by 24 MAEP, meaning that you'd need an additional:
---
a) 2.4% crit or b) 48 attack power or c) 24 DPS on felstriker to make it comparable to CHT. 
---
1% Crit is roughly equivalent to 18 or 19 MAEP.
---
1 AP is 1 MAEP.
---
1 Agility is 1.75 MAEP.
---
1% hit is roughly 13 or 14 MAEP.
---
Whether or not youre a theorycrafting nerd, your numbers are wrong.
---
Only use corruption then shadowbolt other than boss fights. Corruption the 3 mobs in the pack, shadowbolt the skull mob it will probably die after that first one then move to the next. 
---
As tanks get better I’ve found corruption then immolate on the secondary mobs is solid dps then sb as the dots go. 
---
Also using succubus will add very significant dps about 25% increase in the catch/ZF dungeon range.
---
&gt; my threat (as Impale Prot) is on par or higher with Fury/Prot Warriors that have whatever gear you think they can get best, but no Edgemaster's.
---
It's not. Post your logs and we'll see how much DPS the people in your raid are outputting. 
---
&gt; The point is that Quel'Serrar with Edgemaster's, beats any other weapon combo with Edgemaster's,
---
It doesn't. I'm not saying EM + QS is bad for a cow, it's actually a great combo, but there are certainly much much better combos. ACLG with perds or CHT is certainly better. You have to essentially give up a glove slot entirely for your weap skill with sword. With dagger you can get ACLG and get a bunch of stats to go with your weapon skill on top of having a faster(better) weapon with higher overall DPS / TPS.
---
&gt; Daggers are all fine and cool, but in current content, when initial threat is king, no current dagger beats QS.
---
You're argument doesn't even make sense because you said your deep prot. Your weapon speed has nothing to do with your first shield slam hitting or not. You'd want a fast weapon to ensure that in case your first slam and heroic strike get parried you can follow up with the 2nd heroic strike as quickly as possible. 
---
&gt; So, not only that my threat is on par or higher than most Fury/Prot tanks,
---
Again, really doubtful, but please post your logs and show me. Maybe I'm wrong. 
---
&gt; There many better tanking weapons than Quel'Serrar...but not in current content, and especially with Edgemaster's.
---
Still wrong. There is nothing that QS provides that is better than Perds or CHT. Perds is higher DPS and gives you access to an additional 1% crit chance, 30 attack power and 30 hp through ACLG. 
---
&gt; If GOLD is the issue, than yeah, you are right.
---
Here's the problem. Tanks have one of the most massive budgets when it comes to crafting / obtaining gear. Dropping 1500g on QS and Edgies is an absurd amount of gold for something that is easily replaceable by very common MC drops. Perds drops from rag at a 26% rate.
---
the only reason you are taking this picture is due to the cooldown on the zapper, none of this loving bogus!
---
Any competent tank that doesn't have braindead DPS uses sunder. It's optimal for threat. If you're only using it every 30 seconds you're a dogshit tank or your dps are even worse.
---
Much faster and way cheaper!
---
yeah i heard that having a Grind mage as alt is very lucritive. but i am stuck between a mage and a hunter
---
They don't cast sunder because their rogues are using improved expose armor you fucking dolt.
---
I mean, it has happen to me that Blizz banned an account I did not even play on. 
---
I activated a 5 year old account, did 2 instances and logged off, the next morning it was perma banned for economy abuse stuff. I asked them to check that again and do a new investigation, and now they found out that they messed up and account was cleared in hours. Stuff like that can happen.
---
I'd love to see a "competent tank" keep aggro from any warlock that wants it. Lol. If you want aggro as a lock, you've got it.
---
You don't need to multidot as a warlock, just follow the kill order, and use Corruption, CoA, and Shadowbolt... That's it.
---
Choker, BRE, Onslaught, Viskag
---
So, in Classic, it takes the value of when the spell is cast, not when it lands.
---
Got my alt there and it's an amazing server. 10/10
---
Man you've got it all figured out, mom and dad must be so proud of you.
---

This BiS shit has people going crazy. There is more than 1 good item per slot. You don’t need a perfect BiS kit just so you can go raid and replace it all. People make all these rules, skip bosses, etc and all it does is make it harder for everyone to get a proper class mix non-toxic dungeon group. Running dungeons is fun, and is the end-game. I don’t know why folks are in such a hurry to get it over with.
---
*cries in lonely*
---
No it doesn't, that's not how it works at all. Sunder is better threat per rage than Heroic Strike.
---
Top, top guilds can get away with it by stacking the fuck outta their Fury Prot tanks and they have enough threat to hold for the most part. More importantly, bosses die so fucking fast that it hardly matters who's tanking. When bosses are dying in 20 seconds, you can literally taunt them the entire time they're alive.
---
Why wouldn't he roll on healing gear, especially if he is healing and the others in group is warr tank, mage rogue warlock. Literally noone of them even cares for healing items. If the healer offers to give out the vendor sell price for healing items he "steals" would that make you more happy. In that case the group is not losing anything.
---
I level an alt lol.  Cost of respec is too much, I'm not going to spend 1-2hours farming just to break even.  Maybe if I had time.  Wish I had started off with a warlock or mage.  No dual spec kind of sucks.
---
Depression, combined with being an overall shitty human.
---
Considering one of my RL friends got unfairly banned, you're wrong bud.. Yes I know for a fact he doesn't bot and is not hiding anything. This is the same guy who never played before and refused to use addons.
---
People want to be above others. That is how they got fun. No one want to be the under dog. That why subconsciously the majority  choose horde on pvp servers.
---
Hmm could be, I recall only having a jumping input and I recall it working, but I don't quite remember well since it was a few months ago.
---
i would
---
I agree that Sunder is better threat per rage than HS but you can only sunder every 1.5s and with a fast weapon you can HS every second so unless it's 50% more threat HS is still better.
---
Check out /r/woweconomy. You can find most info either in the sidebar or the search!
---
Actually the opposite for my guild. Must have been 5 Perds in a row if I remember correctly. Needless to say, we have wayyy more casters than Rogues/tanks.
---
Where’d they go?
---
When I was shadow, I would offer to heal, if they couldn't find a healer. You would then also deny me the right to roll on loot even after providing the favor of healing so you can actually do the dungeon? That's kinda bull shit, and the reason I only run with Guildies.
---
Everyone knows that’s how you properly kill him.
---
The point of this post is to pull Vann without having to kill any marshals.
---
Playing the victim on forums when you got banned for botting is also the classic experience
---
I can just see it now:
---
“LFM MC, AOTC required link achievement”
---
That's modern sociopathy
---
If you only want the Shadow Weaving debuff on the Boss , the best option imho is to go for a Power Weaving spec.
---
You provide improved shields and improved fortitude on top of Shadow Weaving and Power Infusions.
---
Spec 31 into Disc to get Power Weaving and 15 into Shadow to get Shadow Weaving, with the last 5 points you can do whatever fits yous playstyle =)
---
It's stupid af to compare Sunder and HS since they don't share GCD with each other. You can do both, and that's what every good tank does.
---
yes
---
Glad you didnt play in p2
---
The players have a choice but they decided to choose the most unfun, boring, and lazy way to play. Maybe it is because they are fat, lazy and have no job in real life.
---
Yeah. I feel like I will just to lock in the price if hysteria does drive the price up like other suggest it might.
---
New to the game,why would people use auto-clickers?
---
I did, and its making a huge resurgence.
---
People thought BGs would fix this shit, and it did for a while but the honeymoon period is over now.
---
And the fun part is that it will never be fixed, because its not honor efficient to do wpvp due to instant queue.
---
We tried to tank him with a bear because of larger hp pool lol. Didn´t work, still oneshot.
---
I was hoping you’d see this again! I appreciated your advice so much last time, that I felt the need to thank you again in this :)
---
The Shaman is absolutely amazing, I only encountered 3 negatives:
---
* unable to be forsaken (partly a joke!)
---
* the amount of spells make me lose track of what’s going on, what to use
---
* a few things that require attention, such as keeping up buffs
---
Would you say these points, apart from forsaken!!!, will be easily solved? Or would you say a mage would suit me better in the sense that it’s ‘easier’ in the amount of buttons?
---
I’ve looked at what Undeads can be, and it seems they can roll Warrior, Priest, Mage, Warlock and Rogue. Out of those classes the Mage and Warlock speak most to me as they can cast from afar. If I were to go Mage, I’d love to level as Arcane despite the odds.  If I go as Warlock, I fear that the lack of movement and amount of buttons will get me in the end again. Though, the class fantasy of a Warlock seems super cool. DoTs, DoTs and DoTs. Apply ‘em in BGs, and I did my part. I really don’t like to try ‘hard’ in order to well. It seems that slapping on DoTs solves that!
---
*screams externally*

You know what my concern is right now? That blizzard is banning these addicted afkers who had an R14 goal. For six months.

And wtf :D this comment is absurd
---
1. Νο Classic +. Also, f MMO Shill where this idea originated amidst the retailers there.
---
2. No achievements. If you want achievements gO tO r eTA iL.
---
3. \#no changes.
---
4. Go back to r e TA iL.
---
&gt;Your role is considered first, then your spec
---
Sure, feel free to tank and heal your own dungeons. Simultaneously. As a rogue  or mage or whatever you are.
---
If I tank a dungeon - it's because I want a certain item from it and it's faster than looking for a deep prot tank, not because I love tanking.
---
Nothing wrong with a trial period where loot priority is different, but after 2 weeks, the guild should have made a decision whether you are a member or not. That is 20 boss kills in 2x Molten Core's, in addition to a few Ony kills. I dont see what doing few more MC's is going to add to the evaluation of you as a member?
---
I know there are exceptions with super hardcore guilds, where trial periods can take longer, but i very much doubt this is Method here. And again, whats the point of more MC and Ony runs to evaluate this player?
---
You are a Resto Shaman, and thus you are in demand. Id personally just politely bow out of that guild and thank them for the opportunity.
---
Oh my god, why do people keep telling that to prospective hunters? It's so false and discouraging. You have to keep their food on hand, and train them once in awhile; that's all. Other than that it's like having your own personal tank with you. Hunter is so damn easy! I got my first hunter to 60 without having the faintest fucking idea how to play or what to equip, or what stats were important, or anything.
---
If you wanna minmax go gnomish first and get the cool stuff from that, then drop it and relevel to goblin for the splodes
---
Go Mage. They're vastly superior in BG's in comparison to shadow priests. Also, people will expect you more so to heal as a priest. Shadow Priests are extremely good 1v1, but not for group PvP.
---
I don't think it's as well known now. It's a little like Napster - massive publicity when it was around, then got sued, and 10 years later nobody really thought much about it.
---
Im not an rp nerd, in fact im what most people think is the opposite, a super hardcore minmax parser. But forreal dude its a goddamn game, understand different people enjoy different things lmao
---
Yeah I've killed the druids 3 times like that. It only takes 4 players to kill the druids.
---
I think HB got sued too, but Glider was the most famous case of Blizz going directly after a botting company.
---
Alliance have an advantage currently, simply because Horde have 20-30 minute queues.
---
Doesnt matter. He got banned for botting when he didnt. Terrible or not, it happens and here is the proof, and hence, OPs "Blizzard never ban legit players for botting" is wrong. 
---
Try to spin it however you like, but this is the truth.
---
I noticed an irregulararity today. 
---
460 HKs yesterday, 53k honour from losing in pugs
---
650 today, 58k honour from winning in premades
---
Not sure if it's related to the play time between 4am and 8am (like before) because I live in a different time zone to my server or if it could be related to the server going down earlier...or more simply some weird fluke of getting more high honour HKs yesterday
---
This is exactly why tanks are so hard to find.
---
considering my experiences and the lfg channel, the only thing thats really coveted are tanks, unless its a dungeon with some rare tank item and nothing for healers.
---
dont be scared of healing, it's piss easy. dont even need to spec for it, just keep some healgear at hand. and bring water.
---
Sounds like retail would your thing
---
It wasn't a false ban though. They detected 3rd party software inputting commands into the game. 
---
They 'mistake' they made was not properly identifying that this person is disabled, not detection of the software. 
---
Again, this is a dogshit example.
---
3 raid trial period is pretty standard.
---
The first boss is a dps check right away. Less if you have capable hunters that can kite. Which we had neither of back then and wiped for two weeks. After that there was no real problematic boss all the way to Nefarian which we didn´t attempt bc of TBC.
---
What if I'm a HOTW druid? It's a tank/healer hybrid spec. In raids it's an offtank on certain bosses, healeron others. And needs both tank and healer sets.
---
Bro straight up I feel like it rains in every zone 24/7 while I’m leveling/Questing/Grinding. I really do not remember it being like this in Vanilla. I tried to remember back to how you could toggle it off. I tried /console set weather 0 or a couple variations and could not switch it off. Anyone cracks he code please let me know lol!
---
Yeah,  that stupid ring noone wants drops alot for us also
---
&gt;The assumed default is that you roll on gear for the role you are performing in the group. 
---
It isn't how you play classic. Go back to retail with that attitude.
---
Sure, but tanking in a full fury spec is going to be quite difficult without some really good gear
---
Honorspy did that for me
---
Sorry but that guide is kinda lacking
---
I think Blizzard is already keeping track of achievements in WoW Classic now, beginning right from the start of launch. It's just that they are not showing it to anyone and keeping it a secret. 
---
(Remember, Wow Classic is run by Retail WoW's clients and servers... They have both the database, technology, code and experience to be able to keep track of achievements. We are living in the age of data and statistics... Even tough if they don't show it anyone, they might still use those information about us to adjust item drop chances for us or determining who shall we grouped with in random battlegrounds.. etc..)
---
But when time is appropriate (say, ***IF*** Classic+ is released in the future) they might make the achievements available for Classic+ also.  They might also make it available only for players who demand it... (Say, available only through web page interface, like old WoW Armory)
---
But I don't think they will ever make it available for current state of Classic. I wouldn't also approve it either.
---
\#nochanges all the way...
---
And if it didn't consume a GCD
---
Just a heads up. If you go to another zone there may be no class trainers for you there depending if the other race can be that role. As well there is no arrow vendor in dun morogh and bullet vendor in teld
---
I feel your pain man (assuming you didnt bot). I got hit with a 6 monther, am currently appealing it. Hopefully some of these people who think blizzards system is perfect get false flagged so some sense gets knocked into them.
---
Awww. They’ll make hideously disgusting offspring together. Good for them.
---
"Hey whats up guys, I'm a 2011-2014 WoW botter which I would argue was the peak of WoW botting."
---
Fuck you
---
I think dumpling was saying that legit AFK shouldn't be banned. I cant imagine you are so against people just honestly afking. They'll get kicked with deserter buff if they're gone long enough.
---
Me (rogue) a friend (tank) and 1-2 guildies (healer +dps) have been farming the unforgiven for my head.. And due to shitty luck its taking quite a few runs. We have been paying the guildies in scurgestones, and acording to the its a great repfarm!
---
Who cares? I've tanked everything up to Drakkisath and king Grodok as fury.
---
Hunter tribute runs
---
Butt cheek to butt cheek
---
It happens every bot banwave.
---
Butters take to the forums saying they were just writing code/running a virtual machine/had their little brother play and that's why they were a false positive.
---
Nobody does this.
---
Screen shot proof obvious 😂
---
We got &lt;Brazzers&gt; which includes players such as Rachelstar and Madisonivy, amongst others
---
You have no reason to believe me, I get that. But I know I had no software or anything that could be used for automation. The last time I used an autoclicker was for a game on ROBLOX like, 2 years ago just for fun. And since I know I am innocent, I also know it is fully possible that other people posting are innocent too. Some of them might be lying, but if it can happen to me, it can happen to others.
---
You can. but it's much faster as a healer.
---
Howdy there folks, I'm finally tempted to delve back into the ye olde days on the EU Side of thing. Though I don't expect myself to get sucked in like I once did, is there any source of information on EU Servers? Whether population distribution, progression or just whether or not they might be considered unofficial x servers depending on nationality of most players? I'd like to find a server to settle down in that, should I be wrong, I can dig my feet into comfortably and continue on for some time.
---
You're right. But those afkers being banned as well isn't a bad thing. More too it, I hope blizz bans them all. All the stealth night elves, rogues, druids and warriors who afk near SHGY to soak honor.
---
Literally every new person we take onto our team walks out with like 4 or 5 pieces of gear. It's insane how much gear is fed to them because the main team needs fuck all by now.
---
Okay, well why don't you have a word with the no.1 ranking guild in the world. As their tanks seem to have it wrong as well:

I didn’t get deep into both.
---
But it isn’t as simple as 2 clients and 1 peripheral.
---
There are scripts you need to build so that a single key stroke gets delivered to all of the “unmanned” accounts. Those scripts look almost identical to that which I created to bot many moons ago.
---
BRD hit me like a wall as enhance. noone wants any competition for the extra attack trinket aswell as the arena mail or pretty much anything.
---
kinda tempted to not mention me being enhance and all and just go "yeah, im a full time healer"
---
&gt; This might be controversial but I personally don't think good farming bots do that much damage to the community. They bring cheap mats for crafting profs to make items out of at a more affordable price and it makes more gold circulate the economy. 
---
This is a little-known truth in many MMOs. Bots help mitigate bad game design by automating the boring stuff and letting players focus on the good parts of the game. In games where crafting requires absolutely obscene amounts of materials (which does *not* include WoW for what it's worth; it's more common in \~hardcore\~ \~oldschool\~ MMOs) I can't help but wonder if the developers somehow intended it to be botted.
---

Farm Tyr's Hand in EPL. Mind control one elite, have it attack another, then kill them both. Takes about 1 minute to kill a pair, 20-30g/hr. [This](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0542001305001-13505100032005-5) is the build I use for higher Smite damage and Spirit Tap. It'll take some practice learning the intricacies of each mob type and how to best approach each pull scenario.
---
Also, Tyr is a DnD god. Dunno who tf it is in WoW.
---
Right, but they need 6% for every other sword, and every other person with OEB only needs 6% because of the +8. They can even get away with 5 cause of the overlap. What I’m getting at is unless you are an orc or a human, edge masters could be useful, but otherwise it is probably a better sale than anything else. Secondly, that getting +15 in a weapon skill would cause you to lose so many stats on pieces that the slightly better glancing blows wouldnt increase dps by any, and would probably lose damage. 
---
Going over +5 of a weapon skill is not a great thing to do, which can be proven by the fact that in 15 years of the game, it is not recommended for any type of BiS list, and would have an extremely specific and unique use and not practical otherwise.
---
&lt;3
---
Nothing wrong with assholes. What's wrong is having such an easy way to report people.
---
Damn... private servers were wrong once again! People on light'shope were talking about Alcor's like it was the holy grail of tanking because of its 1.3 speed
---
If you are going to include BWL, which you almost need to with how much later ZG is planned to be released after BWL, you are basically dropping down to Cloak of Consumption.  Bloodvine set is good, but it is boe craftable so you don't even have to set foot in ZG to get it.  If you include healers there is the neck from Jindo.  Paladins have the gloves off Hakkar as well.
---
There are useful items in ZG.  THe issue is that with how late ZG is coming after BWL, a lot of it won't be as useful as people think it is.  ZG is going to end up being either Jindo/Bloodlord for the enchant items or altfests for a large amount of people.  The alternative is release it at the same time as BWL and make it a nice companion for people trying to get a decent boost to help with BWL.

Does anyone know if it’s possible to put my current WoW directory on a thumb drive and be able to play with the same key bindings/addons from the thumb drive on any computer?

Nearly 30% of the server is Undead. It's almost as bad as the blood elf infestation on retail.

I’m Alliance so no idea. Our ques are pretty instant

Of course winning 2v1 is down to the duo to play way worse. But I am annoyed by the full cooldown 1v1 rogue with jump - absurd.
---
Ssssssshhhhhhhh
---
way to miss the fucking point
---
Feel free to tank with your vanity pet and heal with bandages then.
---
&gt;You have no fucking clue what you're talking about and should go read a guide on how this game works. Stop suggesting anyone waste 1k gold on worthless items that are beaten by dungeon blues.
---
says the guy that thinks you should be using sunder in your tanking rotation ? :D
---
What a load of horse shit. Outside of raids you could tank anything with 51 unspent talent points.
---
Why don't you just ask them what their loot rules on trial raiders / new people are. Really that should have been discussed before joining or directly after.
---
People here dont understand any of thus because of the ease of mc, but its all to set a system for the future. Everyone here thinks you can just walk through aq and naxx
---
Examples?
---
learn to play the game, sunder is not good, it's why good players don't use it. The facts don't lie.
---
Ugh did BRD the other day and the hammer dropped off of the last boss and i was super tempted to roll but then a lock did, my mostly MC geared ass just passed
---
But people who post on Reddit know more than the game companies.
---
Hey man, I appreciate your reply!!
---
That’s actually a really helpful one, especially considering your girlfriend is probably on the same level as me (skill wise).
---
For example, when a WSG starts I always get nervous as I feel the need to do well. My old ass gets stomach aches and I press the buttons 1, 2, Q and 3 all at once when I meant to be pressing just the 2. As a Warlock, it seems... safe? Stay back, throw 3 DoTs on somebody, and I did my part. I want to help the flag carrier — by keeping people off of him and letting him/her survive.
---
As a Mage, it seems just frostbolting is super useful already anyway. Sheeping their healer, stamp on the ground to freeze casters in place and blink away when things get too hot. Plus, as a mage, I may even have the opportunity to flag carry myself as well.
---
Hmmmm.... lol.
---
It's pretty cute when people seem to play victim and accuse other people of wrongdoing when all they were doing was playing the game, how it was intended, on a PvP server.
---
I think the more common rule, if any, is that you declare what spec you are rolling for. So it's still MS&gt;OS, but you may be rolling MS dps while healing. If heal gear goes up, someone MSing for it gets priority though.
---
Ugh no, some healing hammer lol, sorry to confuse
---
Do you have a shaman nearby?
---
Also when the guy found out, he have the spriest the group rather than just kicking him, or master looting the boss. I've seen way worse from other people on a regular basis, than how this guy handled it.
---
Agreed, currently our guild, which is a 1 night a week full clear Ony/MC guild, funnels a ton of loot into our up and comers because the main team has pretty much everything save the shared items such as weapons/rings/trinkets/etc.
---
I once took that boat ride to see where it ended up. Nice sight seeing trip. Does alli even use that boat?
---
stupid enough to come deep into these comments threads for a game you have apparently 0 interest in anymore? Ok boomer
---
Well, there's not that much they can do about it now other than layers which people cry about. They fucked up by not setting a server limit before release. Now there's 5x more players than back in Vanilla in certain servers in the same sized world...
---
Is it so hard for you to say “I’ll heal but I’m rolling on shadow gear”?  Nobody is denying you anything except your ability to trick people
---
Lol what is wrong with you?
---
lol x) indeed
---
Earthshaker is not low pop, but high instead. Also some other destination realms are medium as well. Like bloodfang.
---
It should, but it doesn’t. You can thank layering for that.
---
Yeah but ring of spellpower is your bis not this shitty ring. Bis for others so casters get put to the bottom of the list.
---
I wish we scaled like that because that’s incredible. Our GM started destroying the charts when he got his Perdition/CHT combo
---
We're playing the game how we enjoy it, it's not for everyone.
---
I got a 60 warrior and leveling a hunter for farming too.

Ah, so everyone went the whole "we can't be top without best racials" deal?  I don't remember this being such a big deal back in vanilla, but maybe that's because I was horde first time around.
---
Farm some gold for mount to avoid running (kicking rocks) for 5 extra levels.
---
If you have any money, see if you can pick up some items with Intellect on the auction house. Hand-stitched linen britches will add +2, soft-soled linen boots another +2. Those *should* be dirt cheap because training tailors crank them out by the dozens while they're skilling up. You really want to be wearing all greens with Intellect on them, but it's not always easy to get equipped starting out. 
---
If you want something more temporary, the magic quarter in Undercity or Stormwind should sell Scrolls of Intellect, if they're not out. Scrolls of protection, too.
---
Progression requires a lot more healings than farming. When you reach farm status, just start smiting instead. Much more fun than fighting pointless heal meters.
---
Classic that uses the Legion client? Classic that is LESS like Vanilla than the version of WoW ran on private servers? 
---
&gt;so it shouldn't be in Classic at all.
---
theres so much stuff in classic that "shouldn't be in it at all" if you wanna have such a narrow viewpoint. Tough for people like you I guess.

Thats very optimistic of you, when you will be rolling against all the other casters for that cloth gear.

Yikes, this convo... I know you know all this but for others' reading pleasure: 
---
Here's the fury tank rotation: BT &gt; revenge &gt; sunder. Spam heroic strike on every MH attack (assuming you have enough rage to BT on CD).
---
This isn't an either/or scenario, you can use both sunder and heroic strike, one takes up a gcd and the other doesn't. If you have rage available and a gcd available, you should be using an ability. Both BT and revenge have 5 sec CDs, thus sunder does fit into the rotation often enough. 
---
However, it isn't the MTs job to get up 5 sunders on bosses or trash, his first gcd will be BT, followed by revenge if it's up. Fury wars and OTs should get sunder to 5 stacks with their first gcd.
---
Thanks for listening to my TED talk.
---
So to sum up your post. 
---
You are playing a game called **World** of **War**craft. 
---
You keep dying in the **World** because the enemy faction is at **War** with yours. 
---
And you are mad that people do this? 
---
Theres servers that are dedicated to safe place play-style. 
---
If you are on a PvP (**Player** vs **Player**) and are dying to other players in the world you are naive to think this should be *toned* down. 
---
Can you name one war where people didn’t go all out? 
---
Tldr;  People are so desensitized to the word **WAR** that they pikachu face when they see what it really is.
---
I think that is the point
---
I haven't a clue but I hope you're right!
---
75+% of the playerbase thought they did and didnt though
---
It's more of a PvP profession, but it still offers so much more than everything else. For PvE utility you can craft Field Repair Bot 74A, a Parachute Cloak, and Goblin Jumper Cables XL. There's also a Gnomish Shrink Ray, but the backfire can screw you.
---
Really it's all about the PvP stuff. You want Ice/Shadow Reflectors, a Goblin Rocket Helm, a Gnomish Death Ray, and a Gnomish Net-O-Matic. 
---
The reflectors are pretty much a necessity to 1v1 mages, hunters, and warlocks. Goblin Sapper Charges and Thorium Grenades are incredible PvP consumables. The Sappers and the Force Reactive Disc are a necessity for AoE tanking. Goblin/Gnomish Rocket Boots are also super useful, I prefer Gnomish because the Goblin break. 
---
People go Gnomish just to get the Death Ray and Battle Chicken because they're the only 2 BoP items. You could respec Goblin, but you would have to use maybe 100 Sapper charges to get the money back. The Battle Chicken is based off your engineering level so you need to get Goblin to 300.
---
Lmk if you have any questions
---
A simplified example that uses the harm/help kind of macro you're wanting.  
---
You want to be able to case Shadow Word: Pain against hostiles on mouseover and target, and cast Renew on helpful mouseover and target.  
---
Now think of a scenario where you have a hostile on mouseover but a helpful targeted.  You have to decide which action should occur and you do that by the order in which you write the conditionals in the macro.
---
So you could write your macro like this
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,harm][harm]Shadow Word: Pain;[@mouseover,help][help]Renew
---
Now go through the various scenarios.  If you have a hostile mouseover it will cast SW:P on that mouseover, regardless of if you have a hostile or friendly targeted.  If you have a hostile targeted and either no mouseover, or a friendly mouseover, you target will get SW:P.  If you have a friendly mouseover and no target or a friendly target, the friendly mouseover will get Renew.  And finally if you have a friendly targeted and no mouseover your target will get Renew.
---
Now you could reverse the order if you wanted Renew to be a higher priority.
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][help]Renew;[@mouseover,harm][harm]Shadow Word: Pain
---
Now if you have a friendly mouseover it will get Renew regardless of your target.  If you have a friendly target, but a hostile mouseover, your target will get renew.  Etc.
---
Now you can get a little fancier and make it to so that a mouseover is always higher priority, but it makes for a longer macro.
---
   #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help]Renew;[@mouseover,harm]Shadow Word: Pain;[help]Renew;[harm]Shadow Word: Pain
---
Now if you have a friendly mouseover it will cast renew on that mouseover regardless of target.  If you have a hostile mouseover it will cast SW:P regardless of target.  If you have a friendly target it will cast renew on that target so long as you don't have a mouseover.  Finally if you have a hostile target and no mouseover that target gets SW:P
---
So as you can see there is a ton of customizing you can do.  Personally I like to add nodead to my mouseover because when things get hectic it becomes more likely that I want to say cast a heal on my target and my mouse just so happens to be over a dead hostile.  Without nodead you just get an error that you can't cast that spell.
---
Do you not understand???? There are servers which will be completely unable to open the gates due to no horde / no alliance. Of course Blizzard will open them automatically, so stupid to think otherwise and also stupid and ignorant to brand it "a shame" - classic NoChanges crowd being dumb as usual.
---
I got banned for botting once and it was ridiculous. What happened was I had a life and was in one of the top raiding guilds and had to not only perform but constantly over perform to keep my spot. I was botting.
---
That's why you have a pvp button if you use loot council. However, that would mean the rest of your gear you will get while raiding should be pvp gear and not bis over gear. You'll fall behind in raid dps then probably get kicked in bwl because you do shit damage.
---
This is bis pvp ring but way better for pve for melee. If this gets to a caster before a decent melee your guild is pretty garbage or you are grinding for rank 14.
---
They were never the playerbase, they are the tourists
---
Lol. You mad you got banned for afking av? Ruining the games of thousands of alliances every day? You don’t deserve to have internet, go back to your cave and afk there.
---
Guild should be funding these cloaks not the LW. Get a better guild!
---
Unfortunately we have a handful of dagger rogues. Keep in mind not every raid comp is perfect. Since we don’t have our main handed melees BIS I made this post to see if I should abandon ship for 1 handers due to our luck. It’s looking like a definite yes.
---
how is it a toss up? how is 1% crit better than 60 AP ever?
---
You are mistaken. Alcor's was touted as the strongest weapon way back in nosts day because the rage formula for damage taken was broken; rage was calculated before armor mitigation meaning a deep prot tank with a shield could be ragecapped on every single fight, making every fight basically like Vael, where Alcor's is the strongest tps weapon.  
---
I think this was even fixed during nost days if I recall, but it was definitely fixed on all of its successor servers (all of LH), ely, LB, ND and SH. No one used alcor's for a good reason and you must be looking at old nost bis lists to think otherwise.
---
only bug im aware of is when ya pet just decides to say fuck it and runs off to attack something you didn't tell it too. even on defensive/passive.
---
gets annoying.
---
Is this guy inside the entrance to the instance?
---
I need to go check this out, sounds far more accessible than the DM-N ghosts.
---
Not OP, but by bad players he meant the kind of people that genuinely enjoy killing people with a third of their health and half their damage potential 
---
The process of creating the optimal twink is interesting but the reality is they're a teenager beating up toddlers in the majority of the gameplay
---
World PvP is dead on my server
---
And he got his answer in multiple spots, its pretty typical for a hardcore raid guild to loot ban trials for a period of time. We are beyond that now and into reply-discussion about the practice of loot banning.
---
For 1v1 shaman might have the highest burst potential. But I'm not well versed in all of the other classes so one might be able to top that. 
---
Using a 2H with WF that could proc off the auto or SS before the instant cast crit CL+ES combo. There's some 2H spell power staffs that have a pretty nice damage range. Could easily be looking at 7k+ in an instant with pretty much pre-raid BiS. (More if the melee hits all crit.)
---
Currently I can do about 4k with my ele sham doing the CL+ES spell batch combo and I'm basically just in pre-raid gear.
---
I've been offering Stockade speed runs on my level 60 to people and been making between 7-12g per run. The run takes about 15 mins to do. Is this considered a good amount of money based on that timeframe, or should I be doing something else to farm?
---
It absolutely does. I've used the same autojump macro to stop logouts for years now.
---
I think mining should be good, can also do jumpruns if you get geared in lvl 60, 2nd proffession I would prolly go herb for a shot of bringing mats to guildmates who can make potions etc if you want 2 gathering proffessions.
---
as long as it has the WTF and interface folder in it then you are good to go.
---
The guy who asked what server to play on? Did you somehow get lost?
---
You're the one who said rolling on Faerlina is bad advice, so I said why it's good. If you have a reason why it's bad I'd love to hear it.
---
Faerlina is popular and it's cool to hate things that are popular. I get it.
---
You have to water your shoulders
---
I've been doing the entire graveyard area in 3-4 pulls as 47/48. I'd say I Nova about 3-5 times on average, not counting the initial Nova after ice blocking.
---
Just like dualboxing.
---
I agree with what you've said here, and would just like to add that healing meters and all of this stuff you've mentioned are very applicable *in progression situations.* Once content is on farm, healing meters become far less useful; bosses die fast, people are avoiding mechanics, a ton of damage is being mitigated, and healers are just blowing mana in silly ways to snipe heals because they're bored.
---
The difference of one hunter to the next is who crits more often on their Aimed Shot. Every percent helps which is why the order goes: agi &gt; crit &gt; plain AP. So I’ve used the two weapons and compared damage and see almost no difference. In my mind since I’m near BIS, stacking crit is helping more than wearing the barb blade.
---
I still play, but i found myself very disapointed at seeing that to be the top % pvpers you have to afk AV for the next 1 year
---
The farming for raid don't bother me
---
No it's not.i join a group as tank and tell them I'm rolling on dps gear. That's it.
---
It's wildly unpopular. Most people not on faerlina are specifically on "any server except faerlina".
---
So while a lot of people like it, the vast, vast majority of people are very glad the childishness is concentrated on one tiny server.
---
You're right it's unlikely to die, just like every server right now.
---
No, you could be botting and pop over to your computer every once in awhile to type some bullshit.  Doesn't mean you aren't botting.
---
rhe boat ride from the land is significantly longer then the one back, i presume you timed the  return route?
---
I had the exact same idea, but for some reason none of my AHK inputs kept me out of AFK. That is, my character jumped, ran, did whatever the script told it to, but I would still go AFK and get logged out.
---
Raiding? I still have to see a Witchblade in Scholomance, 25+ runs
---
Honestly it's way easier to find a group as dps/tank for 5 mans. Every group almost always seems to have a healer.
---
The technist packs that drop elementium should act like a boss and once you kill them that's it for the week. 
---
Can be a bit frustrating as things like boots of pure flame and a few other bis epics only drop off the first few trash packs in bwl etc.
---
Yeah nah
---
Lol that’s what I say every time I ride through a crowded IF and SW on my server Pagle. I am thrilled to have my game back 😊😊😊
---
and here we are almost in 2020 - what the hell are we doing with our lives?!
---
I think hunters are bugged by a lot of mechanics that dont work reliably. Feign death can fail through several means, some of which are out of your control, which makes some pve and pvp encounters frustrating. 
---
Having said that, it's a very rewarding class to play as it feels really good when things do go your way
---
There’s no way I want to pay that much money 😂
---
It's not offspec.
---
your server is shit mate. Not going to debate it with you.
---
You sound really salty, maybe you should quit WoW. FYI i play horde on an Alliance dominated server and got rekt by Alliance raids during Wpvp so i am not bias like you. 
---
Again it's the developers fault for the server size/pop and that's why pvp was so bad. Stop crying cous you got ganked out of the game, so did most people. You either ganked to rank or you just logged off, great foresight by blizzard.
---
did blizz nerf insignia of the alliance ? i feel like the CD used to be 2 minutes now is 5min
---
Incoming “my friend who I know for a fact doesn’t bot got banned” posts
---
&gt;  fury/prot is better rage generation, same survivability (maybe slightly less)
---
Even best fury/prots currently take around 40% more damage on average than deep prot tanks. Unless they equip a shield. And fury/prot without a shield is pretty much a worse deep prot.
---
So Im using a AHK macro which clicks bg queue, clicks join and buffs me armor with all random timers between. How likely I'm on their list?
---
Maybe less often, but same for a shadow priest sometimes. He joins as dps, group doesn't find a healer, asks him to heal instead and ready to go.
---
Warlocks can't use maces.
---
 It really because you can easily tell the diff between someone actually playing a bg, for example, and someone sitting in tunnel or whatever and jumping or using an ability now and then.
---
You could look at metrics such as how many different abilities were cast, how many different movements, if those movements look like real player movements, how many interactions, how many different targets etc all in a given play session.
---
Lol I read this post thinking about the character Butters from south park.
---
They didnt stop. People believe they did.
---
I would get an email from a site I was a member of. I don’t remember the name of it CheapWoWGold or something generic like that. 
---
I joined the site and would just give them my email, server and faction.  Had to do some small gold transactions first to show I was legit. 
---
They would email me with a gold request something like “BigBadWoolf on XYZ server requested 1000 gold”.  I would reply yes or no. I then had 4 hours or so to make the transfer. 
---
I would them log in and mail the gold to the person. Or in some cases I would see if they were on and msg them and hand it over.  Grab a screen shot of the transaction. Reply to the email request with the screen shot and would get the money. 
---
I know now they do some AH transactions. You put an item up way over priced and someone buys it. 
---
My botting was more for enjoyment so did not do a lot of gold trading. Did some just to see how it worked.
---
I suggest using [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/50320003-1050510303-50025201005) instead.
---
People are talking about how renew scales with +Healing and how great it is. Improved Renew, as mentioned before, only scales with the base of the healing. What DOES scale with +Healing, interestingly enough, is Mental Agility; reducing the mana cost of spells is far more powerful than scaling heal benefits. This is why Improved Healing is a priest's bread and butter.
---
Sadly, there's no way to get Shadow Weaving, Improved Healing, AND Mental Agility. If you must get Shadow Weaving, then it makes the most sense to pick Improved Healing over Mental Agility.
---
Finally, I swapped up some talents. Blackout is useless in raids and especially useless if you aren't spamming shadow spells. Likewise, you don't need to reduce shadow threat if you're just spamming rank 1 mind flay, and I've added Silent Resolve to help anyway. I also shifted some stuff around to grab meditation because it's just so damn important for sustain.
---
Reading problems?   #1:  Talking more about, target mob, kill, loot, 180 degree snap to next mob, repeat.   #2:  "a GM should goto that location (invisible) and watch the player for signs they are a bot".  
---
So no, as long as you're able to respond to a GM while you're fishing, you'd be fine.
---
I'd think 28 - 48g/hr is pretty solid for the effort. Also, farming can be mind numbing. If you are enjoying the Stockade runs then more power to ya bud. Plus you are helping folks grind out those lower levels. Seems like a win.
---
You got the wrong guy pal, lol, read the usernames. I just jumped in here to explain when tanks can apply sunder and why they usually won't be using it. 
---
I was kinda on your side even though you're a complete asshole.
---
Because you’re an incel?
---
Somebodies wolf tried to yolo into lucifron last night
---
Interesting, but very few are using flasks now, mostly top speedunners, in BWL we might see a few more, then come AQ we will see flasks every raid and same for naxx. Demand hasn't really increased yet, but it for sure will.
---
Om bigger servers, there will of course be higher demand as there are more people but supply is the same on all servers. OP says lotus cost 40g on his server, it is currently 80g on mine, it was 105g a few weeks ago.
---
i mean thats possible, but if I were to stay nearby to type I may aswell just play since im already sitting there, which is what I did since I have 2 monitors and just watched netflix while casually AVing
---
welcome to world of warcraft i guess? hasnt changed in 15 years.
---
You cant spell Horde with out H-e-r-o-d.
---
Well then i've been had, motherfucker.
---
They were, I was initially in this guild until my friend group re-rolled another server. We saw the writing on the wall with Stalagg and decided to cut our losses early.
---
This is truly sad to see. I got my Leaf when P2 dropped and it was a shit show. Luckily most hunters (except one on the KOS list) would treat other hunters with respect on Rhok'Delar quests. Unlucky mate, but try again and get it done!
---
If you just want gold i think mining/herbalism is probably best but you can save yourself money by having alchemy as well instead of relying on RNG crystal mining. Sapphire prices went to shit this week and wont change any time soon since people are done crafting the stuff they need sapphires for. Thorium prices have been going down for a while and are at an all time low now. Even dense stone doesn't sell for as much anymore.
---
Yeah I think there was a post from one of the devs around why it was a thing. It’s been in the game since vanilla launch and I think the reasoning was based around being able to play the game with just one hand on the mouse.
---
Eh, you know it really isn't all that uncommon, especially if you are just starting out. Thing is you learned something and know better the next time around. I, personally, went through four guilds before finding the one where I get along with everyone and it was very much worth shopping around! Don't give up!
---
Right
---
Well he's a REALLY good friend.
---
T0 :  Shadowcarft
---
T0.5 : Darkmantle
---
T1 : Nightslayer
---
T2 : Bloodfang
---
IIRC ?
---
The honor system was a shit show before and the new AV has just amplified it. You have no idea how much it pisses me off that afking in AV is better than having a pvp group in wsg.
---
MMMMMmmmm
---
Pay a warlock to summon him to Ironforge, set his hearthstone there, done.
---
 Have one tank start the fight. Estimate how many fireballs your group is hit by.  Have second tank stay around there threatwise. 
---
Once she lands your second tank will be pretty close to the top of the list.  
---
Whoever she decides to eat at the start of phase 3 pulls her to the tanking position 
---
Spam heal this person until the tank has threat or alternatively just let them die until the tank is atop the list. 
---
Let him build a bit of aggro then nuke her from orbit.
---
I do tank occasionally but every so often I run into DPS that refuse to wait 2-3 seconds on a big pull and also refuse to assist the tank. I'll ask, they keep spamming mulitshot, blizzard ect and the dungeon turns into a shitshow. Those every so often are enough to make me not want to tank very often.
---
Deathbringer is way too slow for deep prot tanking, if you give that to your MT over a fury warrior your guild is doing it wrong. You would make an argument for Deathbringer on a fury prot, but again, giving it to a tank would be an odd choice given how great it is for fury. I think Fight clubs BiS list mentions the same thing.
---
I only did a pug run but we let the tank get some aggro in P1, spead out in P2 so most of us could avoid fireballs (completely stop dps so the tank can pick her up again), then after she lands we again let the thank get some aggro, then everyone goes ham finish her off.
---
play a paladin dude. keep up 2 buffs and afk melee. oh no low hp, bubble, big heal, continue.
---
I would never stay in a guild that won’t let me get any gear for 1 month, waste of time!
---
Then don’t tell other guilds to pug. Do your loot your way and don’t pretend it’s the only way lol.
---
Teebu's
---
Because we like playing with friends instead of inviting people just gor their class
---
Thanks, my default raid ui looks terrible, without any mana / class information, I will check interface settings.
---
Oh, is Daish on Yojam? I only know him from Frostmourne on Retail.
---
Lol ok. Typical Reddit galaxy brain, write something you can't justify then refuse to explain yourself.
---
Probably are just mad Faerlina isn't an rp server with this level of spergery
---
Asian markets are all about smoking while playing
---
Both factions are the same, same kind of people playing them.
---
That raid ignored you so they could get to MC and get their on-time DKP bonuses and so they don't risk losing their buffs.  Sure they could have stopped to help you, but if they get involved in every pvp showdown going on they would end up starting much later than planned.
---
Basically the world (of Warcraft) doesn't revolve around you, take your L and bring a buddy next time.
---
Yeah the leader said loot council and we will give you loot when youve been in a couple raid, i was like ok fine.
---
Theres a new threat meter that takes into account wing buffet and fireball threat reductions, not sure what it is but someone linked it in my guild discord so ill link it once i get home.
---
With that being said, MT is always going to lose aggro since fireball targets the highest threat target. The goal of the MT in p3 is to gain threat again, use sunders hstrike while she is im the air. A big mistake i see tanks make is not try to build aggro until she is on the ground.
---
Dur, I'ma haves fun, lulz whirlwind! I's shadow I no healz because I shadow and melt stuff, guduh.
---
Your FF and retail numbers seem super pulled out of your ass.
---
You go look at the warning labels on all your cleaning products, explain why people need to be told not to drink bleach, or that coffee is hot, or even to not text and drive... then get back to me on "no one would be so stupid".
---
Enjoying it because it's meaningless anyway
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. You didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Personally I think that the reason is because Blizzard made warriors to tank in the first place, and this thinking has stuck with people even though the game has changed.
---
Just an example: Look at all the tier sets in classic. The warrior sets are primarely made for tanking, meaning that they should be the tanks.
---
I agree with you though, people should change their mentality but... It's hard.
---
So you had a bot running while you watched netflix and thought itd be fine if you were there to respond to gm messages, but dont think thats botting  and the warden nabbed you?
---
Depends on spec. 
---
Deep prot is - 
---
Shield Slam &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder Armor &gt; Heroic to Dump 
---
Fury/prot is 
---
BT&gt;Revenge&gt;Sunder&gt;Heroic to Dump.
---
But if you’re fury prot on horde, I doubt rage is going to be an issue often. So you’ll virtually never use sunder.
---
So you admit your proposed solution is that no one should PvP on a PvP server? Literally what is the point of rolling PvP then?
---
ah sorry! And yes I am.
---
But can you?
---
Honest question, I'm alliance so I wouldn't know.
---
How can we trust someone who freely admits to AV leeching? They already demonstrated they are willing to break the rules to get ahead.
---
&gt;Blizz will only ban if you do something illegal.
---
You must be young if you think you need to do something illegal to be banned. Read the EULA, anything that goes against the spirit of the game is a bannable offense. AFK in a BG is exactly that, a bannable offense. And yes, I do hope they get banned.
---
Best player should play a warrior. Hands down. It requires the most maintenance, know-how and time to play.
---
Personally, I just don’t need dungeons anymore. If I’m gonna tank, I’m doing it for guild runs. I tanked my ass off leveling and it’s just kinda stressful. There are certainly a lot of good people who are patient and don’t make it hard, but at the end of the day it’s still a lot of responsibility and I’d rather just have fun.
---
It’s also annoying when dps expect you to only roll on tank gear ever though you dps in raid and that’s the gear you want. Granted, that’s pretty rare for a warrior as people are generally just happy to have you. Still happens occasionally though.
---
If you really want DPS gear then just run the dungeon as DPS. You can heal to find a faster group and tell them upfront that you are there for DPS gear but they have every right to drop you and find a different healer that wants the healing gear.
---
I just don't enjoy tanking, it takes so so much more effort than just blasting a target and letting the tank worry about keeping things under control. I did tank a lot when gearing in dungeons, and that was where i learned i don't enjoy tanking that much, i just did it for the convenience.
---
Imagine if he actually used that mental fortitude to be more than a clown and do something productive
---
The fact that you are claiming to not understand the difference between someone having wow up in the background being played for you instead of actively playing is such a red flag lol.  AV is fucking draining and boring as hell to play.  If I could have a bot play AV for me while I watch shows, play other games or literally do anything else I would in a fucking heartbeat.  
---
AV blows but here you are claiming that you would just play because you are already at your computer so why wouldnt you just play... give me a break kid.
---
Sunder is good, but bosses 
---
1) are tauntable
---
2) die in 20 seconds when your guild is really good
---
So sunder is redundant for them.
---
Karma.
---
Spriests can do fine dps in groups, on par with rogue single target dps. They can also heal the group doing the same dps. The only thing an spriest sucks at is any sort of aoe dmg. However if your group has very little aoe dps is a good time to spam swp on every target and watch as the dot numbers fly and you reach around 800+ dps lol.
---
In raids its a bit different. Unless spriest is spamming runes/pots and stacking some key mp5 pieces they will have a serious drop in dps over time however they conserve mana much better than oomkin and ele shaman.
---
Regardless of whether their rogues used improved EA, they still wouldn't be using sunder over heroic strike. evidenced by the fact that they aren't using it on bosses where EA is not up. 
---
Cheers though
---
I'm drunk. Just wanna wish you all a happy new year ❤️
---
I’m gonna be real with you, Classic is my first time in wow ever raiding. So the difficulty of these raids or metas and strats are new to me. I’m a DPS monkey through and through. I know nothing.
---
What I can say however, that despite the amount of healers we’re bringing, our clears relative to the rest of our server and faction are pretty fast and have only really improved from week to week.
---
So if 12 healers to a raid we basically have on autopilot is a little too much, then you’re probably right but it works so why not lol
---
For sure tanks get gear faster or maybe it my luck. Got pre bis for tank and dps spec as warrior about 2 weeks after hitting 60. Then a few epics from mc to seal it.
---
Tank basically leads the group. You pull, you make sure you don't wipe, and tanking is intense work, especially if you are a fury specced without much threat
---
it's good for 5 stacks, but your fury warriors should be using it for those 5 stacks.
---
I started playing Tank a few months before TBC came out and again in classic? It was hard and made it very challenging and brough some exitement to the game for me personally, keeping agro is a pain and many people who role tanks either reroll, quit class or delete, as I mained tank in my guild people would roll tank play till around 30s and change spec or delete because it wasnt what they expected and proved far more difficult than they initially though.
---
Its harder than people though and when solo questing you progress would slow down and people dont have time for that anymore seeing as most people who played back in 2004 now have familys and jobs so need to keep to a stricter time schedule
---
You're watching too much Southpark :P
---
Ty for you anwser.
---
On firemaw in my guild we are currently running 5x40 man raids in MC each week, doesnt seem like a dead game
---
Another feat of strength accomplished by the MIGHTY, BIG CHINNED, IRON WILLED, RUGGEDLY HANDSOME, HIGHLY SKILLED HORDEE! ONYXIA WAS SLAIN THIS NIGHT! REJOICE IN YOUR INNS!
---
Yes it does. It's about maximizing your honor/hour relative to those on your server. So doing everything you can to make sure your games have max honor gains helps you relative to others
---
We have same issues, Ony is just a messy threat fight.  Last fight I was not fireballed (as a healer) and at start of Phase 3 had aggro on Ony.  Usually we have someone that "shouldn't" be the tank tanking and stop all DPS until a tank pulls it.  It's pretty annoying because I used fade pretty aggressively and feel like if I hadn't done that then I would have been fireballed and not have to deal with possibly tanking Ony.
---
Maybe! Thx for explaining.
---
Would be very interested in this threat meter.
---
Go get a job
---
I still wouldn’t take the DB for tanking since it’s so rare. Although optimal, it’s a pretty coveted weapon for dps that can be replaced by the axe off Nef or off trash in BWL. (Or TF for MT)
---
Nah, it's not that bad its the paladin tanks that stand there waiting then end up drinking after a bit. Should be spamming the drink ASAP and your mages probably have to drink aswell.
---
Give cheaters no information that can help them cheat better in the future.
---
Because they don't feel like it? What kind of stupid ass question is that? Their game time is not being paid by you so it's not their duty to do what you want them to do.
---
I know sometimes when leveling a warrior/Druid might be too low to tank but high enough of a level to dps. I’ve always tanked everything though, I don’t think I’ve ever run as dps on my warrior
---
This video is always hilarious to me. Not because it's an BG full of bots, but because these people were all using the bot with default settings, making them insanely useless. They couldn't even be bothered to download one of the dozens of enhancements available at the time that would make the bot 100 times more useful, that's how lazy these people are.
---
Hey look it’s retarded
---
&gt; Personally I think that the reason is because Blizzard made warriors to tank in the first place
---
Probably shouldn't have given them 2 DPS trees then.
---
Especially making the easy pulls shitty. “Oh nice I can charge this pack” the moment I hit charge there’s a mage hard casting flamestrike, and follows it up with come of cold then AE...
---
I love tanking for melee groups....you just can’t run them at 60 because no one wants competition for loot.
---
But you don't bot all the time.   You play during the day, being just as efficient as everyone else, then turn the bot on at night or when you have to go do something.
---
TF isn't out there. And if you want  a tank weapon, then even a craftable phase 3 epic sword is better. Blackguard, I think? The one with 1.8 speed and 1% parry.
---
Never said that.. It was directed at the dude justifying himself fishing because "blizzard put it in AV"
---
Sometimes, when i pull on it, i rip the skin!
---
2nd tank pops Recklessness and a rage pot.  They'll catch up fairly easy.  2nd threat was probably a fury war anyway and they should position her/shield up (or not, she doesn't hit too hard) until 2nd tank takes it.
---
lol and maybe also for folks with only 1 good hand
---
Demon hunters are a pathway that leads to many abilities some consider to be... *nice*
---
Plenty of dps warriors out there who tank because it’s needed, not because they want to. It’s perfectly fine for them to roll on dps gear in that case. They should tell the group that’s the plan at the onset tho.
---
Too much stress from people raging about me not doing something right etc. Tried it for a few low level dungeons rfc-sfk but couldn't handle all the people getting angry I wasn't going fast enough or out threating them.
---
&gt; Then don’t tell other guilds to pug.
---
When did I do that? 
---
&gt; don’t pretend it’s the only way
---
or that?
---
The context was the OP's question of it being normal for a hardcore raid team to lootban new members. It's a legitimate response to suggest an individual go pug MC or find a casual guild if they are interested in a short-term returns in lieu of committing to the requirements of a hardcore raid team.
---
Ignoring the limit? Corruption and COA depending on how long the fight lasts would be good to add. Shadowburn at the end depending on how much cast time you have left.
---
No. You can queue for a specific battleground number though. So there's a huge alliance AV discord that you need to join a special queue to gain access to, where hundreds of dudes sit in a channel until a group leader says "open your Battle masters"
---
They then count down, and on the word "queue" everyone clicks queue. People post the BG number that pops up in discord chat. Leaders will announce a number with a channel name, and everyone with that number goes to that voice channel and/or stacks into that specific AV. Since BGs are cross realm.
---
I've used it a couple times, it's pretty wild. Not all groups end up being fast though.
---
"The Christmas truce (German: Weihnachtsfrieden; French: Trêve de Noël) was a series of widespread unofficial ceasefires along the Western Front of World War I around Christmas 1914."  
---
"The truces were not unique to the Christmas period, and reflected a mood of "live and let live", where infantry close together would stop overtly aggressive behavior and often engage in small-scale fraternization, engaging in conversation or bartering for cigarettes. In some sectors, there were occasional ceasefires to allow soldiers to go between the lines and recover wounded or dead comrades; in others, there was a tacit agreement not to shoot while men rested, exercised or worked in view of the enemy."
---
The legit afk players who just left for a bit aren't the ones getting banned, is the thing.
---
No one wants to tank for people who don't know how to dps properly. People who min/max their dps is what made tanks flee LFG. I don't want to work twice as hard to hold aggro because people can't be bothered to pay attention to their threat.
---
They both get two HUGE leveling benefits as well.
---
Warlocks get their mount for free which is amazing, but grinding the gold for the first time as all the other classes is a huge achievement that feels so good when you accomplish it.
---
But mages get teleports and portals which should NOT be underestimated. I've never leveled a mage because it doesn't fit what I like, but god I get so jealous of them being able to instantly move around the map.
---
So my final vote for you is Mage, but I would still recommend trying out each one just for a little bit.
---
&gt; I've never tanked before and afraid I will fuck things up.
---
Don't worry, it'll very likely be the DPS who fucks up, but you'll get all the blame regardless.
---
Scarlet monastary is the perfect place to learn if not deadmines nor wailing cavern. Tanking a dungeon when slightly over leveled for it is easier, and you can then work your way up to equal leveled instances.
---
This is the same as DPS and Healing. In a perfect world you do dungeons all the way to 60 to develop the feel for it. Starting to tank when you become a fresh level 60 when half the team are fully kitted makes it very very hard to learn. DPS need to learn to CC on demand and react to circumstances, tanks need to learn how to generate aggro and keep damage down.
---
&gt; coordinating with Washed Up to prevent other guilds from getting Azurgos. The list goes on
---
I'll get downvoted for this, but holy fuck the cope is so real
---
After over 15 worldbosses where we sit there and specifically prevent THAT EXACT GUILD from getting world bosses, people just latch on to worldchat memes.
---
Thank you for this reply.
---
I think this illustrates exactly why tanks are so hard to come across. It just isn't fun, and a lot of it comes to the fact that it's incredibly stressful to tank when a lot of dps just go ham on all mobs constantly without any considering for the tank.
---
These are the types of replies I was hoping to get to show other people (dps) how sucky it is to tank, and they should maybe try to change their mentality a bit - it would make it a lot easier to get a tank next time they needed one for their dungeon.
---
There are no "childish servers." It's a WoW server, it's just like every other server. Do you play on some golden God server where everyone clears MC in 30m and nobody ever rages? Faerlina has good players and it has children, just like your server and every other server. The difference is Faerlina is known.
---
Such a strange opinion. This is reaching my football team is better than your football team territory.
---
Relatable :'(
---
You're not as funny as you think you are
---
Eh, for 5 mans it's a bit different imo. Even a full time holy priest needs some gear for farming. I think it's nice if people pass to someone who needs it more, but I wouldn't say that's expected in a PUG.
---
What does showing up on honorspy matter?
---
Technically the factions aren’t at war yet in classic
---
Depends. At 60, if you're good and have a group which helps, you could manage. Call it like 60% of the ceiling of pally 5 man tanking. Good enough.
---
Hey man, I just want to say the anxiety is worst part of tanking, once you start doing it it’s honestly pretty easy to get things under control, and 99% of people are willing to help you learn.
---
Especially lower level dungeons, I’ve been healing on my alt and it’s amazing how little I have to actually do even if myself and/or the dps manage to snag aggro.
---
It works with 8 marshals up
---
To piggyback on this: When I tanked in TBC I only ever rolled on tank gear because I didn't care about DPS spec. These days, it seems understandable and reasonable for tanks to roll on their DPS and tank specs. The same can't be said so much for healers and their + spell damage set.
---
That is false sir
---
OEB, BRE and brutality blade. We've raided since week 2 and some weeks even 2 groups, but we've had next to no melee weapons. 2 vis'kags and 1 deathbringer is all we've gotten for melees in guild raids and then 1 perdition's blade in the half guild/half pug during the holidays.
---
It's safe to say our melees are starting to hate MC
---
You literally listed the rotation properly, with sunder ahead of heroic strike, and said you virtually never use sunder?
---
I saw an elephant for the longest time.
---
I do carry and 1-hander and shield just in case I asked to tank. But for now, I just been questing through content. It's been a breeze so far because my friend help me get the whirlwind axe at level 30. 
---
Perhaps i will start tanking some SM dungeons and see how that goes.
---
The biggest issues I hear from players who play on an opposite coast server is the raid times/prime times for dungeon running. If you're west coast then just know a majority of east coast guilds will have raid times that are 8pm for them, and might be 5pm or 6pm for you depending on where you are. 
---
I'd poke around in some server discords and ask on some realm forums if there are any guilds that raid in your preferred time (if you're into raiding). I know there is a late night raid guild on the server Benediction (After Hours I believe they're called) and there are usually 1 or 2 guilds that raid weekends/mornings instead. 
---
But if the East Coast prime time hours line up well for you, it shouldn't be an issue at all.
---
Why wouldn't it be okay?
---
Quel'Serrar is going for around 300g on my server (Or rather the book) and I grabbed it for 250g bid. My alt is a human warrior. Is Q'S still worth it for me at this point or is it better to get something else? I was planning on tanking dungeons and going fury for raid.
---
Because PUGs can be very bad and make the run unenjoyable. I happily tank for guild groups all the time though.
---
Exactly. You get huge benefits from 305 weapon skill (reduction from 9% soft hitcap to 6%), and some smaller (but still nice) benefits from getting it to 308 (reduced glancing blow penalty). After that benefits are negligible.
---
Or they investigated the guy and found him breaking the TOS in other ways and included him in the ban wave.
---
It depends greatly on who I'm with. 
---
Is it people who are open to dialogue on threat, CC etc? sure, happy to tank. I need to be able to say "Hey Mage, wait a few seconds longer please" without it causing an argument, or worse without them ignoring it completely which happens most of the time.
---
In a bad group, like I said people either get argumentative or ignore you completely. "I'm gonna need more time to get threat on these guys because they're a couple levels higher than me" can get responses ranging from "Why are you here then? Noob" (You invited me but alright), "Just do X instead" (Backseat tanks are the worst...) or not a peep and they just go ham anyway, pull threat and complain.
---
It's really not worth it, you're damned either way. If I DPS I get flak for not tanking, if I tank I get flak for not tanking well enough, can't win.
---
Thanks. I might just start doing that.
---
yeah 90% did same crazy
---
They are waiting for phase 3 &lt;3
---
It's not a new issue, I used frost trap first week of dmt and quite often pulled aggro when releasing FD too soon. In those cases it was always the summoned doomguard that fucked it though, I'm assuiming its the same in your case. 
---
It's much easier to just skip using frost trap altogether in dmt, none of the pulls really require it to work
---
After aq gear frost isnt viable anymore.
---
I do tank, and enjoy it
---
Its a case of noticing mistakes. Almost nobody will notice in a pug setting if a DPS made a mistake, maybe his rotation is off, did not land a kick, did not stun when he could. These things are seldom noticed. The only time clear mistakes are noticeable in a pug setting, if a Hunter's pet goes and pulls 2 packs.
---
With healers, it is similar, maybe the Holy Paladin could saved the tank if he had remembered to use his Divine Favor? Or maybe Swiftmend? Again how are players going to notice these mistakes, all they see are health bars going down.
---
With tanks, their mistakes are clear and visible. You dont know if they had a Shield Wall ready that could have prevented the wipe, but you do know that their positioning was less than optimal or that they lost aggro.
---
Even though tanking is easier in Retail, in that you never lose aggro, its still a position in dmeand, becasue you are expected to know not just the positioning, but also which packs to puil in M+
---
&gt; Meh eventually a MT will need Edgies for TF. 
---
I agree, and I have an unequipped pair of edgmasters sitting in my bank for when that day comes. I bought mine when they were still 500g and now they are up to 1100-1500 on my server. This guy didn't say he was a main tank and didn't make the Thunderfury argument. He's trying to say EM + QS is opitmal right now in this phase, which isn't true. 
---
&gt; If your dps are doing &lt;850 on Horde or &lt;1050 on alliance deep prot using QS is perfectly viable, but not optimal
---
Again I agree, but this isn't the argument the guy is making. He is saying he outputs more threat as deep prot than furyprot. It's just wrong. Nobody said QS isn't viable, I actually said right in my post that it's a great combo for a cow, but there is way better options out there that wont break your bank and will generate significantly better threat.
---
It's like RAAAAIIIINN
---
This has been discussed frequently enough to suggest a norm actually doesn't exist.
---
Does it have a virtualized mouse for looting and clicking world objects?
---
Afaik frost  mages can solo farm naxx trash. So there is your viability :)
---
Pretty much this. Occasionally I will offer to tank any dungeon in exchange for all the greens/blues that no one needs. Some groups are fine with it, others act like I just shot their dog for even suggesting it. I guess I should just dedicate 2 hours of my night to a group of 4 strangers to do the lion's share of the work in a dungeon and receive, on average, less than 20% of the rewards since most of the other people will have stuff they are looking to roll need on. /s
---
It's an Elephant from the rear end, looking back.
---
It’s good to keep in mind because it can work in your favor. I’m on central time playing on a west coast server. I haven’t an issue with queues in months because I get off work at 5 and it’s only 3 server time. Raids start 9pm my time in my guild, which is quite doable for me. But yeah, put some thought into how the time difference may affect you and see if you can swing it in your favor.
---
Happy drunk yew near to you too!
---
I played fire into Naxx (first couple of bosses back then before TBC came out). Rolling ignites are no joke. I used a deep fire spec in PVP as well, but you really become more of a glass cannon. The AP/PoM pyro build was a blast in PVP as well.
---
I fucking missed the fireworks in orgrimmar
---
Man all you guys are coming out of the woodwork all at once huh?
---
Bears are wonderful 5 man tanks and if well supported are also fine raid off tanks.
---
Yeah it sounds like my problem, I still use it before the locked door, makes my pet survive easier, it takes a couple seconds extra but for me it works well.
---
Maybe I just didnt notice it before the patch, I didnt farm too much in DM before so small sample size, just thought that somethin changed.
---
I loved tanking soo much I rerolled to warrior. Got to 60 decked out. 
---
Then I started tanking pugs. People are idiots and toxic.  Not all, but some. 
---
Some guy on my server, nightjakz, or somtin. Plays in a self proclaimed hard core guild and was raging at us during DM North cause the leader (himself) didn't bother getting any Mats so at times we got 'unlucky' and would agro boss. 
---
 Just repeatedly yelled at us saying we aren't good enough to do tribute.
---
After soo many bad experiences, I've reverted back to my mage. It's easier to help a bad tank than it is to help bad dps.
---
This is dope! How did you get this working?
---
&gt; Blacklist 
---
Ummm? No need to be racist..
---
That sounds like an awesome plan to me. Everyone wins!
---
I use it occasionally when i'm petting my dog, so its not totally useless
---
As a dps yes, but as an offtank both T2.5 and T3 head is good
---
I blame healers. If you aren't drinking you're telling me you're ready to pull.
---
If we are out of combat sit your ass down and drink if you don't want me to go. I don't like to bitch at people for not drinking immediately after combat ends. Some of them like to stand around for 5-10 seconds after combat ends before they finally sit down to drink, meanwhile my rage is decaying.
---
The best way to correct the behavior is to just pull if they don't drink. They may have to use a mana pot on the next pull but they are gona be panic spamming that drink button from that point forward.
---
This may be a stupid question, but if I parked a level 1 alt outside Dire Maul North, I could use that character to hold open a tribute instance ID right? 
---
There's no instance level requirement or anything?
---
Isn't deathbringer really slow for a tank weapon? 2.8 S swing?
---
Sry i'm currently leveling a warrior and don't fully understand what makes a good tanking 1 hander
---
You have 29100 RP this week, to reach rank 9 you will need to gain 11720 RP which means you need to get high bracket 2(or called br13 on honorspy), so no you will not get it. 
---
If you go bracket11 then you gain 10k maximum per week, which means you next weeks ranks will be roughly:
---
Next week: r8, 2 weeks: R9  3 weeks: R9 4 weeks: R10 5 weeks: R10, 6 weeks: Might hit rank11 here.
---
hi
---
Bind an easy to reach key to autorun, I have it on G atm, makes life so much easier. I do use click to move occasionally when I don't want to keep running forever or when my left hand is occupied. I use autorun more often than I actually run!
---
Has he adressed him scamming people?
---
Something that helps is having tanks prop reck as she lands to try gen as much threat, also immune to the first fear, once agro is established they need a cancel reck macro - subjective to group.
---
I screamed this in my head!
---
That's not quite it from what I remember. I remember the pyroblast would proc and you have to immediately hit the button to get the free attack? I could be remembering it wrong. Maybe that was a much later update I dunno.
---
Do quests until 55 and then do BRD arena/angers runs. Go to Felwood and grind mobs while you collect Whipper Root Tubers, you're going to want like 200 of those. By the time you get the Savage Gladiator Chain and Hand of Justice, you'll probably be at least 58 and can do all the other dungeons to get BiS. 
---
You could do Mara like the other guy suggested, but I would just pay some hunter to get you the ring for 20g. It will save you so much time just grinding out 20g. The dungeon is very long and will take a very long time to fill groups for.
---
That's good. I'm happy to get more confirmation from here that this is the case. "lingering voodoo" is definitively a good description of it.
---
With gear enough to pull two packs at once, and with herb, it's about 50g/h i'd say.
---
I have 2 monitors man. Its easy to play AV if the goal is to farm rep, I literally just watch a show on 1 monitor while just following the zerg on the other. Takes like, 2% brainpower to do
---
I have been buying all the ones below 31g on my high pop server.
---
I love tanking. And I hate to lose a tank item just because a DD or healer is collecting a tank set (while most likely never start tanking).
---
There is an instance level requirement for all dungeons. Can't even enter below a minimum level.
---
Fishing, clicking a spot you know an herb/ore will spawn at, preventing yourself from going AFK, buying something off the AH. There's a decent bunch of uses
---
Love when FD goes on CD but I stay standing. I think that's due to spell batching if a mob hits in the same batch as FD
---
Yeah because as fury prot you have a shit ton of rage to dump. So you’ll use it once or twice on a fight maybe.  😂
---
Obviously use sunder more as deep prot because being rage starved is more of an issue.
---
I'm guessing they may think that the Robe becomes unusable (not able to equip) upon abandoning tailoring, similar to how Engineering items do when you abandon engineering.
---
Thankfully it does not so you're free to abandon Tailoring upon making the robe and pick up Alchemy, or any other profession you prefer.
---
Never discredit the exp from running a dungeon slightly under your level. Spamming mara and ST when it is easier to tank is 100x better than struggling to even hit level 57 elites in BRD.
---
Just about to ask this too! I'm on that server :D
---
No, the point is I didn't have a bot running, and I was present and playing AV while watching netflix. I was countering the idea that I could have just "hopped on to type while the bot runs" by pointing out that if im needed to be there to type, I may aswell just play the game
---
I believe Bay of Storms requires 425 skill to not get any "your fish got away" messages, because I'm running with 300 skill, 100 lure, and 20 pole, and I still have a rare fish escape me. So if you're on 300+100+25, I *think* you're good. Have you ever had a fish escape there with 425?
---
any info  on how long the ban is?i hope its not 48 hours or shit like that..
---
Again, ignoring the debuff limit there’s no problem with that but be prepared to bring lots of shards.
---
Even more so, I'm sure.
---
They remove them fairly quickly, but you have to be searching by 'New' as most get removed after a few minutes
---
I play a class that can tank but awful itemization requires me to heal for raids. Thanks blizzard.
---
its blizzlike.
---
Anyway the best premades aren't even doing that strat anymore, too risky with snowballs, they have 1 mage pull every warmaster and kite it.
---
Our guild merged with another and we have been clearing content on the weekly which has been great. The journey that got us here and the friends we made on the way has been some of the best time I’ve ever had in WoW. 
---
I am a ring and ranged slot away from tanking BiS. My main is now pretty much raid logging as I don’t plan on PVPing much on a Prot Warrior. I log onto him to tank when needed. Otherwise I’m on an alt. I plan on leveling and gearing every class but hunter and lock. I will get a hunter and a lock to max but I don’t plan on raiding/PVPing on them. 
---
My paladin is almost 47. All my other Alts are between 10 and 20. I have so much content to do. If I actually get all of my alts to 60 I have reps I could get. I have gold making and epic mounts to buy. I have PVP. I have professions. I’m on an RPPVP server so I can role play if I want and probably will. 
---
If I burn through all of this in the next year which I probably won’t I could also reroll on a horde server and start fresh which my main crew have talked about. If we get burnt out on Alliance we have the option of starting over on horde. 
---
I don’t feel like I’ve peaked. I feel like I just started and I am super hyped not only to play my alts but for the next raid tiers. No LFR, No LFD, no CRZ. People actually talking. Server rep matters.  I have been waiting for this for years and I am really happy with Classic so far. I wish retail had a server that had no match making. Azerite armor aside, I didn’t hate BFA as a whole. I just hated the lack of community. Pugs are more fun and building a guild is actually possible.
---
How does one make multiple attempts AND 2 successes before getting gkicked?
---
I play Alliance. The flags I defend are FWGY, and then RH when we push in. It is perfectly normal for a few people to cover those flags while the rest advance.
---
any info on how long the ban was?
---
i really hope it was not only 48 hours..so people stop it
---
AQ and naxx you have to go fire.
---
I’d rather heal. I’m not specced into feral and my feral gear is “meh” at best so I wouldn’t even be a good tank if I tried, but this post reminds me of the other day when someone whispered me asking me if I could tank DM North. I replied “no, sorry, I’m resto” and they literally replied “you’re an idiot Druids are for tanking” and put me on ignore. Like... sure, if you want me tanking in full intellect/healing gear with 0 points in feral.
---
You dump rage that you have in addition to using BT/Revenge/Sunder on CD....
---
First time warrior here. Was exited to tank some dungeons, never done it before. Was specing Arms, but when people /w me if I can tank or looked for tank I asked if I can tank as Arms, and 9 out of 10 times people where cool with it. Started with tanking DM saying I have no exp in tanking so group knows. All are cool with it. people shared some tips and so on. and all was very smooth and nice. same thing in stockades, At astar i warned that im new to tanking and noone have problems. 
---
Then I started cleaving at SM first runs where smooth and nice ( some tanking some dps didnt really matter) they where fast and clean. I dont get to play alot so I spend like week or a bit more in SM, In last levels i noticed something. the cleaves wherent clean anymore, mistakes where made, it wastnt fast and easy runs anymore. Then it hit me. The first big wave of people who knows wow and can play alot are lvl 60 already, those who cant play alot but are gamers, are on mostly in evenings ( good runs in last lvls of SM where at evenings/nights)  at the day, I dont like to say it, but i had feeling i was playing with some retail kid zoomers. People are pulling half instance, dies in mid pull and blames healer for not healing. rages and leaves. 
---
I put that all aside thinking at the time thats its just SM, people been there some time got tired of it wanted to move etc. 
---
So around lvl 40 I start getting alot of /w from people looking for tank to dung ( forgot the name the one south of loch modan) I do my usual rutine. Ask if I can 2h tank as arms, but can switch to sword and shield if needed, and that im still learning tanking.. People still cool with it. First dung. inside while our healer drinks hunter pulls saying its fine his cat can tank it. pet dies i scramble to pull aggro, we end up wiping, hunter leaves, another dps leaves. I and healer fast got 2 more dps. one is pally who idk how keeps getting aggro from me. he rages at me saying im shit tank and i should go kill my self. ok np, we finish instance. but this trend kept happening, people over pulling saying we can go much faster, me being bad tank running around trying to get aggro off the dps ( i did prio getting mobs off healer) wiping, getting told to off myself coz i suck as tank. Then after another group where we had 2 mages, and they kept pulling extra mobs, coz " we have 2 mages we can pull alot and aoe them down, so much better exp/h" what ended up with whipe and usual blame on me ( and also on healer  this time) I said to my self that i dont need that shit. I Rather slowly grind mobs as warr then get shited on over and over again.
---
I would like to think that it was just me. and other new warriors / tanks had better exp then me.
---
DPS players are such clowns sometimes.
---
&lt;URO&gt;
---
How many drops per boss do future raids have? For some reason I thought I remembered it increased in the future raids but I could be mistaken.
---
I don't understand how botting works at all.  Is it possible to write code that says "if a mob is over there, go walk to it and attack"?  Is that through the blizzard client (I would think they wouldn't expose a way to do this).  Or do you somehow write code that doesn't directly interact with WoW that detects how to bot (find location of mobs/ores etc).
---
The 3 set bonus requires 300 tailoring to get and without the set bonus bloodvine loses most of its value
---
If you put him on passive at the very bottom of the ramp, he should be far enough away to despair right when you reach the door. The only time that pull fucks me is when he gets dazed on the first hit, but frost trap doesn’t help me in that situation.
---
the thing with bots though is that the twits using them 90% of the time don't really give a fuck and will just create more account to bot on
---
raiding since 2nd week of classic, no t1 druid chestpiece for me yet &gt;:\[
---
And for every case of people solving it with a simple chat, there's many people getting told off. You just won the lottery, nothing else.
---
First success (ninja'd ony bag) was explained away because nobody from the guild was there, he said that the winner had already left the dungeon and the bag is untradeable. After that he exhibited a lot of sketchy behavior until finally he hosted another PUG Onyxia and ninjaed a pattern (Greater Arcane Elixir) by rolling it off, losing, then looting it to himself anyway and learning it. He was kicked as he refused to reimburse the winner and seemed to feel he had done nothing wrong.
---
The best way would be to be a Druid.
---
Heh I just did the math, you’re right. Assuming a 45 second fight @1.5 second GCDs, that gives you 8 BTs and 2-4 revenges depending on RNG. The only option to fill those GCDs is sunder which would supercede heroic.
---
No, but  are there benefits from going beyond 425 such as reducing the time it takes for a fish to bite, increasing the time frame where you can catch the fish after a splash, increasing the likelihood of getting better drops, etc? Or is fishing skill strictly about 'you can fish here' and 'x% chance to fail to catch that fish'
---
Progression is equal right now, since MC is trivial and cleared in 30 man pugs.
---
You didn't specify your faction and pvp\pve\rp preferences to provide more detailed answer, though.
---
There's a way to manually check activity of server - create level 1 char, run to AH and do quick scan. On healthy server there should be like 15-20k items. If it's below 10k - that's a bad sign (or wrong time :). On most populous realms it's around 30k items, but there may be constant login queues.
---
As a die hard fire mage forced to spam that stupid blue blob spell every damn week, I can't wait to drink the frozen tears to the sweet melody of karma.
---
Well yeah, obviously it's common etiquette, but I'm saying that they can't in any way be held accountable for it if the party leader doesn't lay down the rules.
---
Must be lvl 45 to enter DM
---
No one cares
---
It's honestly not too bad on Benediction. Tanks are still the most needed, but you do see messages waiting on heals or DPS. 
---
On the flip side, I ended up being a main tank for MC last night as a pug because the guild running it was short on tanks. But hey, holidays do odd things to schedules, doesn't necessarily mean anything. 
---
One factor might be that it is very easy to form groups as tanks. So, it's not that attractive to join another group. Sure, sometimes I will, but if I see awkward loot rules or something, I'm probably just gonna do my own. Or if I message and get not response. Some crazy lad last night was spamming chat for LFM so much that he couldn't be bothered to respond to anyone who wanted in. Not a good sign. Warning signs that maybe won't put off a DPS who needs that dungeon will definitely put off a tank, so some people do wait.
---
Underrated comment
---
Believe so.
---
I see, I've been afraid to put it too far down in case they come for me before door is completely open, but I'll try it for sure.
---
hybrid classes dont get alot of comparable items from raids
---
It's incredibly unclear though because a lot of reports that would result in an instant ban are due to player reports rather than automatic detection.
---
I'd actually counter and say it's a good thing because if they work on the assumption that a particular bot is detectable it will make them look for another and there are not infinite bots available. The alternative is shitloads of accounts get to run bots indefinitely whilst players hope a ban wave is soon.
---
Could have guessed from the “/w me fast” xD
---
i mean im glad the bots are gonna be banned for a good amount of time, but also upset that now I have to go through the appeal process since im the unlucky 1%  -_-
---
MS &gt; OS even in 5 mans. It's perfectly okay to roll on OS gear if someone doesn't need for their MS and it's also perfectly okay to reserve that OS piece so whoever you might take it from can make an informed decision and find a different run.
---
Whether he did or didn't cheat, you should give him shit for it anytime you can. That's what friends are for. You guys playing a FPS and he kills you, "Oh i bet that was another one of your cheats huh??"
---
PvE + less hardcore might be the reason.. Im on firemaw eu
---
Been nolifing way too much and was kinda hoping for a ban tbh
---
What class?  For warriors, getting hit capped for dps is essential. A Miss'ed Whirlwind refunds zero rage.
---
For 2h'er with the appropriate weapon skill. You only need 6%, any more +hit isn't going to do anything.  
---
 Glancing blow chance is locked at 40% and can't be changed.  However weapon skill increases the damage that glancing blows do. at 300 it's 65%, at 305 it's 85% and 310+ it's 95%.
---
Sounds like you have nothing to apologize for.
---
Really only get the chance to when my bud randomly specs out of prot and our dozen or so tanks are offline/busy. Few want to see an afflock tank tbh, so I'm content waiting around as the dps role most days until I get enough gear to facetank everything.
---
Ret Paladin with Sulfuras. Human.
---
I'm a resto druid for raids/pvp but love tanking 5-mans. If only the respec cost wasn't so high... I don't really want to go HOTW/NS and be okay but not great at both roles.
---
Aiight so as a shaman, I should be rolling for my enhance, elemental and resto sets right?
---
The point of the rule is a lot more than warriors... They usually get their way and roll on everything anyways.  It's exists more for priests who are healing not rolling on +shadow gear taking it from the warlock or dps Shamans not rolling on healing gear.
---
Yeah and so brain dead.  Most pug dps im surprised they can tie their shoes
---
So my warrior is just an alt that‘s why I asked the question in the first place since I don‘t have too much time to spend on this char. That‘s why I don‘t know if I can farm Dal‘rends. LHH will also not be a thing for this char in the near future. But I could see buying Edgmasters. Maybe sell the deep wood axe and instead buy Edgmasters and go with Frostbite and Mirahs song? I‘m a troll so no matter which weapons I‘ll get I would profit from Edgmasters a long time right?
---
I‘m not sure yet if I wanna go 2handed with a raidweapon. Would Edgmasters be still good with a 2hander? Probably not with the sword since it already has +swords right?
---
I think warriors and druids. Locks would be even more OP in PvP along with spriests, but they would have a much much harder time with rogues. Would be most interesting to see it on a Shaman.
---
It's BiS for looking good and that's what really matters. Whats the point of raiding at all if you can't look cool doing it :D
---
True, but it does kinda feel sucky. Even in my pretty casual guild I would feel bad not having those especially if they arent replacable in MC or bwl.
---
But like. I’m only tanking to get this dungeon group moving. My main spec is DPS.
---
So, around warlock drain tanking level?
---
I don't know ret paladin gearing, but if you were warrior it would be about 20-25 str, so probably around 15-20 for you since you don't have the crit talents.
---
I need to learn this (s)witchcraft!!!!
---
That second guild would be the one to avoid when it sounds like they are actively recruiting players they have been warned about. 
---
GMs can be a very proud bunch though, I was once asked about recruiting someone who played the same class as me. I explained how their gearing and talent choices suggested they didn't really understand the class. The player was recruited the next day...
---
Mages don't even have to go back to town
---
I had a shadow priest tell me he was going to roll on the BRD gloves that drop off Princess only once we were in the instance. Nope, fuck that. That's the only piece I need here. Heal the damn dungeon if you want healing gear or find a healer that doesn't need that item.
---
Holy everything in this thread.
---
Private servers and the onyxia threat bug sure has poisoned the waters around onyxia threat.
---
She resets aggro when she starts landing.
---
I've tanked her a lot and just tell your tanks to have 100 rage when phase 3 begins. As soon as she starts landing they need to start slamming and sunderingen. When they are out of rage pop berserker rage, back into defensive and pop a rage pot+blood rage and start slamming and sundering again. And she'll stick to the tank like glue.
---
Usually let the dots and hunters take her from 41% to phase 3.
---
This fireball talk doesn't matter anymore, it was bugged in the beginning in classic so you could sort of plan around a second tank.
---
Also tell every warlock to stand on the tanking spot so she doesn't turn.
---
I rock hotw/ns. I will tank dungeons for guildies, but if I'm pugging, I'm a healer. It honestly isn't a huge drop off from deep resto for healing. Plus ur Mana pool is noticably large. But for Mana effeciency moonglow is still top
---
Yes they can. Everyone is expected to not be a fucking moron.
---
its cool on one hand, but on the other, swords are all very low drop rate and incredible competition... so yeah, once you get it you're a god, but the odds of getting it are pretty slim :) while hunters get their BiS weapon super easy and basically guaranteed within a few raids
---
"there are people not as degenrate as i am so i mess up their work and fuck up their game"
---
Exactly. He can heal the shitshow himself. Ugh.
---
Yes, but now that less alliance are quing AV, the queue is increasing . And horde have 20-40min queues which they use to go camp alliance out in the world. Usually on flight-paths or in alliance questhubs (because its guaranteed hot-spots).
---
So you fly to wherever you want to go, and most likely you will be killed or polymorphed on landing, and enjoy being corpsecamped for a good 10-15minutes before even getting out of the hub.
---
Which is why I want guards that are useful, so you can at least have some safespots where you can organize and recover.
---
Nah dawg. Say some warrior is filling in as a tank but he's a dps player otherwise. He's not allowed to roll on dps gear? MS is what you make it, the point is to be clear and consistent. The current role you're performing doesn't have much to do with it, you just need to be able to explain yourself if they vary from one another.
---
It's pretty much always going to be between 2 and 4 items.
---
Are you 10k people?
---
Idk what server you're on, but if you're by some miracle on Incendius as alliance, I'd love to help teach you stuff.
---
Are you me?
---
Lol what kind of stupid as logic is this?! Dude is healing just to get the group moving.
---
Just kiss me bro
---
Hit does not affect glancing blows, just weapon skill.
---
How do the mages kite warmasters? They seem immune to my chill/feeeze effects.
---
I used to be a big time botter. I dont believe that shit either honestly. 
---
I even leveled a goblin shaman through BGs with only a single macro in game and a macro based keyboard. All 100% afk.
---
Chances are, if you got banned for it...you did it. I think they might be telling the truth “not botting” but they def used some kind of 3rd party anti AFK. Even if its auto jump or turn every 2 minutes.
---
Mages have it good when it comes to gold farming, leveling, and being *cool*. But man this video hits right at home. 14\~ weeks and the only items I wear in PvE i've gotten are Netherwind Crown, Arcanist Crown(funny story there... the Netherwind Crown rots in my bank now), and Netherwind Pants. Mageblade, there's a chance you may actually never be mine considering BWL is slowly inching onto the horizon, but gosh darn it, some weapon will be mine!
---
The only time sink IMO is leveling up.
---
Being in a friendly guild defiantly helps with playing the game. For the moment nothing really needs to be maximized to the nth degree to kill ony and clear MC. Retail is defiantly more causal friendly but classic is also once you hit a certain threshold.
---
What shoulders is that warrior wearing? I've only ever played Alliance but I just love those shoulders.
---
Oh OK I didn't realize we were talking about dual wield tanking.
---
Every reddit gold post is basically r/wallstreetbets but WoW version.
---
The big thing is people need to realize Fury and Arms warriors can tank just fine outside of raids. Paladins and feral Druids as well. Hell in a pinch shaman can tank. 
---
People get stuck in this BFA “I’m a fury warrior” “Iz a cat drood!” You are your class not your spec and your class CAN do a lot with proper gear.
---
Lol you're just jealous that botters got things much easier and didn't have to spend days leveling / grinding
---
Bears are the best tanks for all content at present. 
---
There will be some raid bosses that bears cannot reasonably tank, due to mechanics. Nefarian's class call turning druids into cats is one such example. But for, say, Rag? Yeah, do it up.

---
Now kindly stfu and fuck off. Thank you.
---
Just don’t invite the classes that use the same gear. Get hunters rogues and warriors. It’s easier and they won’t think twice about the cloth gear.
---
Okay, thanks for the info. I didn't realize that -- it makes since now why OEB seemed so much more consistent than Sulfuras even though Sulfuras produces much higher top end numbers (about 200 damage more than OEB on a really nice crit).
---
Anyway my first question was how much benefit that last 1% hit will give, do you know of any way to calculate or estimate that? Going from 305+5% to 305+6%, in terms of DPS. 1%? 2%? 5%? I can't imagine it'd be that much but you never know.
---
I'm only losing about 9 Strength to pick up that extra 1% Hit so I'm guessing it's worth doing it.
---
Roll a mage and AoE grind. Fastest route to 60 and great gold farm
---
BTW the sit down critical is something from private servers. It doesn't work in Classic. As a druid who loves to open up on mages sitting, I don't always get a crit.
---
Does the Scarlet Crusade worship him in any way? Or did this area in EPL just happened to be named that?
---
I would choose a pve server, whatever you do, but especially if you intend to play alliance
---
I love when I get comments that mix my two favorite hobbies in one.
---
I cannot speak 100% for them of course, but it would make absolutely no sense for them to give the reason "Botting" when they were in fact breaking other things against the ToS.
---
You know what you did, go tell someone that cares. These bans were a long time coming
---
One of the biggest design flaws of Vanilla was making Warriors both the clear-cut best tank class .... and the clear-cut DPS class. In Vanilla, not enough people/guilds came around to the realization that Warrior DPS was broken &amp; insisted that Warriors should be tanks. However, after over a decade of pservers and people seeing what they were missing or wrong about, everyone came into Classic well educated on how busted Warrior DPS can get... thus the swamp of plate rogues we find ourselves in today.
---
I never thought this could be done with an addon. As mentioned, it does not seem to have a classic version but I found similar addons for this purpose. I will give them a try thx.
---
8 piece mage t2 can give you instant cast pyroblasts as well in classic.
---
Have you ever seen somebody get banned for being too inactive? How does that email look? Try to Google it and you find zero results of this. Also, if this was really the case, there would be millions of threads from Vanilla, TBC, Wotlk etc.
---
If you aren't going to res items, or take money from players, you will really just need to tank and tank and tank.  Personally I don't take money from players for tanking and I don't res orbs.  I've made a lionheart, epic mount, annihilator and a force reactive disc.  I literally take the first group looking for tank for anything.  Socially, I am in a position where I am whispered by 5-10 pugs on logon and I never need to look for healers/members.
---
Guild wise, I do not demand payment or res either.  Call it karma, call it me being a pussy (in that I won't charge/res anyone anytime).  My point is, you can make money by just being available and putting in time.
---
About the only thing I won't save for is edgemasters as my realm has it up to nearly 2k at this point.  
---
I do probably about 3-4 dungeons a day, none ever hit the hour mark, no wipes and we use CC where necessary.
---
Make an alt bank toon 
---
Grind dungeons and roll greed on all the BOE equipment and just sell them on your bank alt
---
Mail and sell everything off ur alt .  Best advice I can give you I wish I knew before
---
Dude they can say whatever they want. There are thousands of people going for rank 14 right now and I’m only going for rank 12. Do I play a lot? Yes. But I also work and have a job. I’m part of a hardcore guild and it’s what’s expected of us. They can say I have no life however much they want and that’s fine. But don’t fucking tell me I’m botting because I fucking play more than you.  Currently I’m appealing it and escalating as far as I can.
---
Repeat that thought for every dungeon at least once and that's why I only tank guild runs. I also have no reason to pug with an active guild so unless someone pays me, I'm gonna level and alt or make gold.
---
It worked a while ago at least. No idea if it's been broken by an update but I think it still works.
---
This.  And utilising seal of wisdom as much as possible goes a long way.
---
 So we had this conversation because we actually have New England Patriots players in my drunk floor hockey league now because we were from Worcester and we were friends with some. (I.e. the ones that left our team to join theirs, QQ)
---
"New England Patriots" though, isn't that unique of a name. Patriots are a common phrase so we're aren't surprised to see it in our league now and our Pats players actually talked to them to see if he knew anyone but none of them were in it and some don't even realize it was [Tom Brady all along.....](https://i.imgur.com/kKppeSI.jpg)
---
It used to be Hunters then Jokerd got WF 60 and now it's a perfect tie between Mages and Hunters. After that it's rogues.
---
That's because classic tanking is about 2 things. Threat and mitigation. Retail tanking is just mitigation. The only shitty thing with threat is when your dps want to single target three different mobs so you have to out put out 3x the threat that your dps do. Tanking's only difficult if you suck or your dps are brainless.
---
Sou you imply there are no innocent people statistically? You realize developers are people and algorithms they develop are never perfect, otherwise you wouldn't have bugtrackers, hotfixes etc. Haven't you ever been exhausted by smth poorly implemented? Bugged sharing, random dc, crash or broken quest. How do you imagine anti-cheating system being always correct despite the fact it is just another complex system made by humans?
---
There's a reason why everyone is innocent until proven guilty. This is just witch hunting. You should all be more patient to other people. I personally feel bad for people who were accidentally shamed BG community without a right to prove their innocence. We live in a society... It's all fun until that happens to you, I personally wouldn't enjoy that attitude to me.
---
Non tanking warriors should try 2H tanking, it's what I do and I find it extremely fun. It's almost exactly like your DPS rotation except you use rage on sunders, demo shouts, and revenge instead. BT with extra rage. Just do mad damage so the mobs attack you instead of the group, and stay in defensive stance. Extremely fun, I also top the charts at the end of dungeons sometimes.
---
I don't think it is that complicated really. In addition to the general reluctance you have for people playing tanks(responsibility makes you a target for criticism)you are also looking at the point in WOW's history where you can rarely carry the group and instead just have a bad time if your group underperforms(which you will most likely get blamed for anyway)
---
I've tanked from Vanilla through to BFA and was planning on coming back as a tank. Then I remembered how bad threat generation is, how clunky the gameplay is and how limited the tank toolkits are in Classic to think.. Yeah no thanks.
---
Your nitpicking right now.
---
Is Knot Thimblejack's Cache lootable after killing King Gordok? I am imagining a solo run where I solo the first ogre at the front of the instance for shackle key, aggro mobs in the room next to Knot from top platform, jump down and complete quest, FD, then loot on the way out. Not sure if this is possible or not.
---
They have no reason to lie in this manner to close friends. No one believes that they WOULDN'T bot, so it's not like they are saving their reputation by lying. If they ARE lying, it's just sad honestly, and if they did truly bot they won't ever get unbanned, which is how it should be of course.
---
Yea ultimately this is good advice but he is also probably want a mount at lvl40
---
&gt; layering
---
Sharding
---
My condolences.
---
I was just spitting out the numbers at the top of the SP spreadsheet. But you are right that I was wrong. DPS on an OH weapon is weighted at 3 MAEP so the difference is actually only 8 weapon DPS.
---
As far as your other numbers, it sounds like you have shit figured out better than I do, so props to ya.
---
It WILL be overturned if they manually look at my account. Why? Because I haven’t botted, haven’t used an autoclicker, havent done fuck all. I have 3 60s, all of which were fully prebised and all of which have done ony/MC. I’m up at 4am ACTIVELY TALKING AND WPVPING. 
---
Please tell me, how do you fucking think I’m botting 5.000 HK in 6 days? Do you think I not AV for 8-35 minutes, then hop back on my laptop to WPVP legit?
---
Might as well put living life as a mental health issue on there lol.
---
Once my appeal is granted I am going to be posting a screenshot just so every smug motherfucker who comments something like "You wouldn't be banned if you didnt bot" can see that they don't know everything.
---
My guess is that they're holding hands and dead. That's bascially the jist of it.
---
As a  pug bg healer i sometimes think warriors are brain dead when I watch them charge in at 10% health, but then I realize they are probably so used to dying as a warrior they are just dead inside about it.
---
Or it could be that the people that post about it online are the ones who were false banned since real botters assumingly mostly know that posting isn't going to do shit. Social media is always a very skewed lense.
---
I'm MT in my guild and this is exactly what I do. No matter where I stand in threat meters, if dps holds when p3 starts and I dump 2 rage bars on her (having 100 at the beginning of p3 and then using mighty rage potion when over) she's always on me. Just make sure whoever has initial aggro starts moving her into position to avoid pointless punting into whelps.
---
85g ??
---
I haven’t payed for Black Lotus more than 40g since release and I’m buying them almost daily
---
Grobbulus is pretty good if you're looking for PvP.  One of the most balanced horde vs alliance servers.   
---
Plus some RP happens from time to time if you like a little flavor with your PvP instead of the unspiced dry chicken that is other servers.
---
"Most relevant server" lol. What does this even mean? A bunch of asshole streamers play here? No one cares. If they were doing actual progression raiding, maybe. But this is a 15 year old game, they aren't exploring anything new.
---
And everyone else is just pitchforking with no evidence either lol. Typical reddit high horse raging from the casual gamers.
---
People typically tend to act within reason, and so its certainly safer to assume Blizzard banned correctly as opposed to them making a mistake, but mistakes do happen, and Classic has had a LOT of them already.
---
Maybe I'll try it... I love swiftmend for pvp but rarely have to use it in raids.
---
The market in my opinion is the laid-back guilds with little experience come BWL. Bosses should hit much harder than anything has at this point and some could easily instagib a tank so if that happens and wipes their raid repeatedly during progression, they'll scramble specifically to get them titans.
---
You always get a crit doing that...  The difference is that effects that proc based on you getting crit doesn't work by sitting.
---
Of course they have a reason to lie it diminishes them greatly in the minds of their peers if they're found to be cheaters.
---
Yeah.
---
Lots of non tanks and people reading/watching out dated guides online in this thread
---
I just haven't taken the time to know all the lower lvl dungeons again, and I can;t always make the time commitment. I feel much better if I have to drop as DPS then as tank b/c my wife needs me for something.
---
Is the music supposed to be here as a joke? Video seems serious.
---
Paladin tank, just heal with righteous fury in P2, easy threat when she lands in P3
---
:(
---
I have a priest that doesnt heal and a warrior that doesnt tank.
---
I'm good at tanking and healing, have the gear for both roles, I just dont enjoy either one.
---
I'll tank/heal for homies that need to fill a group to farm something, I will not do either in a pug.
---
You cheated and you got a rightful ban. Change your behavior or be mad at yourself.
---
Them: "You shoulda stayed on Stalagg and kept getting buttfucked by Horde"
---
Me: "But I wasn't having fun. I transferred to Heartseeker and now I'm having fun"
---
Them: "BUT THINK ABOUT THE HORDE ON STALAGG!"
---
I missed the boat and swam, it was going the long way, and it was roughly the same.
---
It’s not worth waiting for the boat, but if it’s already docked it’s slightly faster.
---
Well, yeah, 40g is cheap...
---
Except I’m online for 16, talking and actively playing, on discord, WPvPing, then I LOG OFF OF THE GAME. My character is never online for 24 hours because yes, I sleep. And guess what? While I’m at work 3-5 days a week (not this last week with Christmas) I am, again, logged out of the game. If you whisper me ever at any point in time in game - you’ll get a response. 
---
Again, not fucking botting and everyone in my server could tell you that because they saw me playing manually and talking all day, every fucking day the last 2 weeks.
---
I'm specced prot for the guild but I refuse to tank pugs due to the sheer amount of people with brain damage that infest them.
---
Far sight does not work across shards. Sharding is Blizzard's solution to enable more players on a single realm than back in 2004. Sections of the world are dedicated to "servers" meaning that a given realm is actually spread across multiple "servers". 
---
A good example of this is the border between the Kargath and Searing Gorge which are on separate shards. Before BGs started, there was always severe lag at this location due to the high volume of players on both shards, and the volume of activity around the shard border (the choke between zones was right on the shard border).
---
Nothing you did is against the rules, people just get annoyed when lowbies come in and don't help.
---
You already had an appeal looked at?
---
If you are going to be out in the open world Mining/Skinning is best until you have your 40 mount. Look ahead at the items you will need and save the leather in the bank for them. Once you are past 40 and have your mount (and banked leather) immediately drop Skinning and pick up herb. Skinning is not profitable by comparison and you only take it because up to 40 you will be killing a lot a lot of beasts. Take a night to level herb with your mount and then mining herb will get you your epic mount. If you know ahead of time you will almost exclusively dungeon grind then go Enchanting. You can always ask, "hey can I get the greens for repair?" DE them after you are out of group. You will also just be able to DE all the gear your replace, which 1-60 pure dungeon grinding is a lot a lot a lot. The goal of taking this Ench is purely Smoking Heart of the Mountain once you've got it you can drop and take something else. Mining/ Herb is the most profitable gathering combo and will present you with the most fun WPvP opportunities.
---
I agree. I enjoy tanking (geared prot warrior), but there's no reason for me to run 5-mans anymore. I'll run Strath live for a reserved orb, but other than that I need incentive to tank.
---
Hopefully 100%
---
Lvl 57 arms warrior here. At level 60 what should I be focusing on?
---
Yes - It is running Console Port, Console port gives the option to run up to body and press (A) or whatever is keybound to loot.
---
I got banned for bottling in cataclysm and I wasn’t funny cause the day in question I had a lengthy discussion with a gm about something and it was that chat time stamp that let me become unbanned
---
you totally had to flex that it’s an alt
---
Memory, it doesn't have to be exact. Helps to us guildmembers.
---
Between 18:00 and 19:00 servertime on tuesday the 7th I was writing in guildchat regarding our MC comp. 
---
Between 07:00 and 08:00 I was talking with the only other guild member online about how bad my AV was going.
---
It takes time and research but it's your best bet.
---
It is running Console Port. When you use the right joystick and click down (By default) it will open the cursor and make it possible to use mouse.
---
I believe you can sell the loot to people who weren't previously in the raid if you set it to FFA before pulling domo.
---
Because actual botters would know that blizzard detected their scripts and know full well that they are fucked? Meanwhile I never had any scripts running, so I submitted an appeal and made posts so that others know false positives are happening.
---
I know that term as "glassing" someone.
---
The situation you are getting mad about never happened and I am convinced you are a paranoid schizo
---
I'm fairly sure that as of 2015-2016 (I'm not sure of the exact time and too lazy to go through old posts to find information), Warden no longer scans your active processes. It's been a couple years though.
---
Lmao okay whatever. I've been playing blizzard games since warcraft 2 and never been banned once. I dont bot. My ban was entirely unfounded and was a false positive and i have a review of my account taking place. Get off your vindictive high horse. Taking pleasure in other peoples misfortunates really paints you as a piece of shit
---
Untermensch
---
Yup, all of our raid priests have it already, so it can start going to alts. Same with the leaf.
---
What’s that UI?  Looks like Titanframes.
---
I was unaware that slaughtering unarmed farmers was just part of war.
---
Funny thing is both of them are doing it
---
None of the raids are hard enough require the raw throughput of holy.
---
If my priest wasn't shadow, I'd be Disc with PI and the smite talents.
---
Especially if it was my only character.
---
As a raider, I still use the level 35 greater mana potions which are dirt cheap and unlimited supply from Strat Undead. Major manas can be farmed by running Scholomance. The level 45 superior's are also good enough for now.
---
I talked to one of the web gm's in the like instant chat things but it was less that useful. The actual appeal button doesnt work for me for some reason and just said instantly resolved, so I have a regular support ticket submitted right now
---
Same!
---
Except I wrote one to get that damn Runecloth Bag recipe from Qira. 
---
Literally was impossible to get it if you were trying to do it legit.
---
Summer Boys!!!
---
Yeah all tanks fuck things up every now and then. No big deal. Just make it known you're not experienced in tanking and you'd appreciate patience. Then throw sunder armor on everything and you're good.
---
Guessing modified switch using android  to run Moonlight. Just a guess! You can do the same with an iPhone and controller using Console Port. If you don't have a switch you can do this on your phone using SteamLink. Wait... you guys have phones right?
---
I'm sorry you have such a sad and pathetic life that all your frustrations are taken out on internet afkers instead of real life issues. WoW must be very important in your life. L
---
Enjoyed talking to you though, always a pleasure embracing the challenge of a good discussion with absurdly dense individuals.
---
Its a completely different thing.
---
Avoiding a serverdisconnect to not have to wait 5 hourse to log in again might be a b1tchmove, but you were not doing progress of any kind in that time.
---
Whilst even the smallest AV join-macro makes you progress in the PvP ranking system while other people have to invest their time for real.
---
Cuz tanking sucks and pug dps are trash
---
Was there actually loot that dropped all 3 weeks that you could have used? Or in this case was it something like you've raided w/ them for 3 weeks, finally saw some shaman gear on week 3, and now you're mad you didn't get it even though there were other shamans who needed it too and have been there longer waiting?
---
Legit question as I deal with loot council drama pretty regularly and a lot of the time it is the scenario I just mentioned.
---
Once again, I was banned for "Botting / Third Party Software" not afking. If I was banned for AFKing I wouldn't be making this post. I understand you are probably upset at AV afkers, and want to be angry at someone, but you being angry doesn't change the fact that I was banned for something I didnt do.
---
Dual wielding?
---
Food for thought. Once you start raiding Blackwing Lair, any priest in your raid who did craft truefaith probably isn't rolling on the Tier 2 chest. Less competition for you, and easier to acquire. For MC, Tier 1 is practically a gimme since truefaith is much better.
---
"Enjoying it"
---
They happen every hour right?
---
&gt;or actual botting processes running on your computer.
---
i'm pretty sure this is the main way game companies use to detect if you're botting.  get reported by players -&gt; you have AHK installed, you're a bot!
---
&gt;These need to take in to account human-like patterns of clicking/spacebar/ability presses, the duration of these presses, and the longevity of the random input cycle. ANY mistake or miscalculation here is a dead give away for blizzard's detection system
---
all this is a waste of time and money apart from catching the most basic of scripters who just set up to click the same spot every second 24/7
---
Quel is 2.0
---
I feel like I don’t see many alliance these days since bgs, makes me a bit sad really
---
freedom + bop and go
---
&gt;They could always 
---
do million different things. Among the million different things, each with its pros and cons, only #nochanges is somewhat special, and this is why they went with it.
---
Cute, but obviously photoshop. There's only 1 large giant model, they aren't different sizes.
---
ITT: botters complaining about bans
---
Because people do that shit all the time? I just want to hit rank 10, and even with running AV several hours a day I'm going up pretty slow, only rank 4 now. If I start an AV and then my son starts tugging on my finger because he wants to play, I'll auto run into a wall and adjust course a little bit till the game ends. I don't feel good about doing that, but it's not my fault Blizzard only rewards people who put tons of time in rather then people who try to win

---
Yeah, this all sounds resonable. It sounds really interesting really.
---
Tbh most of the time I'm tanking 5 man groups I'll usually skip the shield and dual wield instead - simply because the rage generation and threat is much higher than with a shield (and without being deep prot). I could imagine that a shaman with shield will take approximately as much melee damage as a warrior with dual wield. 
---
Thanks for enlighting my alliance-only-knowledge :P
---
then prolly 20-25 str yeah. Should be easy to get 6% and have it be worth.
---
If you are INCREDIBLY lucky to meet the right guy on webchat they can forward it to someone they know internally but my advice remains. You have to convince them with evidence you didn't bot. Things like "I'd never bot I love this game to much" won't do anything, they heard it all a hundred times.
---
Band of accuria is amazing for bear tanks what are you on about?
---
I love how there are already some dimwits, who blame #nochanges for the mess that open world pvp/pve is. Increasing the server population is in fact a change and the major reason why missing faction balance hits so hard. You know because 1200 vs 800 ain't that bad compared to 4800 vs 3200, when the world map stays the same. Back in the day major hubs were really contested, now every corner is/was full with players increasing the chances to get ganked. Blizzard is fully aware of that and isn't doing anything to stop it. Not because of the nochanges spirit of classic,  but to promote their paid character transfers. Money talks.
---
hahahah yeah, but i mean, you never know, in pservers black lotuses only saw an increase in price on raid reset day, but they always came back to normal
---
so yeah, focus on thorium if it seems better. twink items are also a good market!
---
Spreadsheets seem to be saying different.
---
I play 30 Ret 21 Holy Paladin.
---
I tank dungeons with a full plate set and shield.
---
The only dungeon that I've felt extra squishy in was a solo tank UBRS. The pulls after The Beast got extra messy and we had to utilize a lot more CC than a Prot Warrior or Feral Druid, or even two regular tanks would need.
---
For everything else I can tank it just fine with 0 Prot talents.
---
Anyone who is unwilling to tank when they could easily do so otherwise is lazy.
---
If I were to believe you (I don't), I might assume you were actually banned for AFKing / generating massive amounts of user reports, but the justification they used was botting since ToS around AFKing in BGs is sketchy at best.
---
Still, I wouldn't think you deserve any sympathy. I've AFKed a handful of AVs incidentally, but the frequency &amp; regularity that you claimed doesn't belong in classic for the same reasons botting doesn't.
---
You've likely indirectly added tens of hours (multiplicative) of your comrades' actual honor/rep grinds to exalted.
---
Prot
---
&gt; She resets aggro when she starts landing.
---
OMG, there it is, the myth lives on. This is just not true. Raid logs have shown over and over how her target after she lands is the highest threat that didnt get fireballed. That cannot be possible if there is a threat wipe. There is no phase 3 threat wipe. Stop perpetuating the myth.
---
Yeah wanding feels really weird in general in classic, between the pushback and the GCD triggering it just feels super sloppy
---
Ah, the paladin setting.
---
The horde pvp gear looks leaps and bounds better than the alliance pvp garbo.
---
this is literally like a year away...
---
Do you have any idea how a shaman would do against a hard hitting boss like Baron Rivendare?
---
I mean, can they handle the incoming damage? When I tank him I'm in full mitigation gear, and still I sometimes find myself rather low on hp (okay sure, I'm a dps warrior so my tanking gear isn't exceptional, but still).
---
Klinfran is easy as fuck
---
stacks with sunders doesnt it?
---
This is sadly true :P
---
Whether or not you want to stay arms or swap to fury. Fury is the better spec for raids, arms better for pvp.
---
seal and judgment of wisdom and light actually Gen a fair amount of threat when the party is single targeting bosses or big elites, no reason not to use those honestly
---
You're literally saying that a player got banned for botting when he is a self admitted cheater.  If the error was they selected the wrong reason to display to him does it really fucking matter?
---
It does.
---
&gt; Blizzard sued them back in the day

After a full clear there is no trash. In Vanilla we used cleared BWL ids to make flasks at the alchemy table für this reason.
---
I'm leveling a druid and planning on tanking dungeons to get moonkin loot. Obviously getting a group as a moonkin isn't going to happen
---
Yeah I leveled as resto and as I got healing gear I didn't realize the improved rejuv and improved regrowth don't increase by 10% off healing gear, only off of base healing of the spell so once you have enough +healing they become almost wasted talent choices
---
Content creators creating content that's already been created. I could watch 14 year old streams of the same thing. They're essentially cover artists. Talented, but forever relegated to a backseat. The spiciest drama is always your own drama. PvP is cross-realm, so irrelevant. PvE is about loot, not speed runs. Streaming PvE is about speed runs, and a minority of the community watches streams. And being infamous for ninja looting and other toxic behaviour is not something to be proud of.
---
Like, there is no relevancy in classic wow. If you happen to be a fan of some particular streamer, sure. Keep up with the server's events. But that's a wicked minority, not some mandate from the masses.
---
Regarding your comment on the gear, this is not surprising as pre-raid BiS has a lot more spell power than the T1 gear, for the most part. For example, I wear mostly +SP greens in MC.
---
This is excellent advice.
---
What did he do
---
You go from it’s “not bannable, never has been” to “well have you see it personally.”
---
Keep moving the goalposts bud.
---
It's already not \#nochanges though, is my point.
---
We started with no cascading, end of vanilla gear itemization, end of vanilla talents, etc.
---
Hell, at the start my mage had staff of dom and a bunch of arcanist and looked like a clown because the raid epics didnt have cool looking graphics.
---
If not for the chat stamp, there would have likely been a plethora of ways Blizzard could check to *ultimately prevent them from losing your subscription money.*
---
Maybe just a gear or spec thing?  I get a lot of compliments on how easy it is to heal me over warrior tanks.
---
Can we ban this person from the subreddit, I don’t like coming on to read about WoW and finding death threats?
---
Well the way I see it a glass would be with a glass. Like a pint glass or a whisky one
---
If you want to top damage in leveling 5mans, hellfire is your best bet on anything with 3+ mobs. You can throw up a corruption or two as you run in as well. This will put you right up there with AoEing Frost mages, and you should be everything else. Be advised however, that you will generate a ton of threat, while simultaneously killing yourself with your own abilities, so you may die occasionally.
---
And the #nOcHaNgEs short bus people that want to feel virtuous and pure.
---
So you can spam a red blob?
---
Get an Annihilator
---
It's the same literally every time there is a banwave for any game. People trot out fake sob stories and make up absurd reasons why they were caught up but are actually innocent. It's a alot of bullshit.

So go play those.
---
He has a shield i think
---
Then you guys need to be advocating for ways that Blizzard can stop this nonsense.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, applying a penalty for declining queues would be a start to breaking up most premades.  A 5 or 10 minute deserter debuff would make the premade practice untenable.  Suddenly, you can't rely on everyone getting to the same BG.
---
Quest
---
Console Port. It binds keys to a controller layout.
---
Get more Intellect gear. I'm using a lot of Lawbringer (5/8), Plate of the Shaman King, the Intellect/Stamina ring, Jeweled Amulet of Cainwen, Malister's Defender, etc. -- I have about 5,100 mana and can do TWO pulls before drinking.
---
Yeah, it's kinda sad.
---
I don't know how i could even provide evidence that i didnt do something, i feel like if they looked at any of my game interactions itd be pretty obvious im not botting
---
They can ban you for anything they want to ban you for.
---
See you in June hope you change your behavior or expect more of the same.
---
Hm, I'm guessing there is something off about their appeal system currently then.
---
What did the webmaster say about the appeal though? Andchatlogs help!
---
Thanks for the info. I was thinking about something like Blizzard app for switch. I know it ain't gonna happen but still, why not to dream :)
---
This is coming from nerds crying about being banned in a video game because they didn't want to participate.
---
??????????????? THUNDERFURY IS A HUNTER ITEM
---
Yeah, it's literally just don't dps when she lands and the fight is basically over if you get her back into the tanking spot.
---
Yea, that’s in the cards I suppose but I was hoping to leave a char there as a dedicated tribute ID holder. Wouldn’t want to level a 45 alt solely for that purpose. 
---
Once I have a 45+ alt I could use it for holding a tribute ID but would be unlikely to camp it there full time.
---
In general you want to start all your quests to unlock content. Get attuned for MC and Onyxia, and get your keys for UBRS, DM, Scholo, and Strat.
---
Play the lock imo, before DR fear is amazing for both PVP and PVE..lock was my vanilla main and I loved it.  Takes a lot of gear to get the damage output anywhere near a mage in raids but it's a fun class imo!  Warrior would be a lot of fun at 60 also of course, just don't go prot until 50+ if you want to tank..
---
When you factor in all of spriest’s shadow damage multipliers from talents (+15%, +15%, +10%) it actually works out to scaling quite well with spell power. If Mind Flay didn’t have that custom coefficient, it would be the highest DPS ability in the game.
---
Because there is a difference between going afk from time to time, and actively doing nothing but afking in BGs. Blizzard doesn’t have to ban them, but like the EULA says, they reserve the right to do so when you accepted to play the game. They can close your account in 5 minutes for no reason whatsoever if they wanted to. 
---
But you can keep pushing the goalposts pretending you’re right or do whatever other mental gymnastics. “I’ve never seen it before, read posts about it or heard of someone who was banned for afking in BGs, that means it’s not bannable. I’m going to ignore the proof you linked me of Blizzard’s own terms saying it’s bannable because I personally haven’t seen it.” 
---
I personally haven’t been to Mars, so it doesn’t exist.
---
I believe you didn't bot.
---
You were banned for not participating in AV and intentionally so.
---
Goodbye and don't come back.
---
In a way, banning in waves tends to break the backs of people doing it.  Imagine it this way, if no bans are going out, you think you are safe, so you don't take precautions, you keep your supply together, you make aggressive plays in the AH and finances.  When the ban wave hits, you are caught with your pants down and lose big.
---
To my understanding a fast attack speed MH does well for tanks due to the superior rage generation.
---
Being hit by a fireball clears your threat?  Does it still clear threat if 2 people are hit by the same fireball?
---
I watched a video on Ony strat where the 2 tanks stood next to each other in P2 because if 2 people are hit by the same fireball it doesnt clear your threat.  When P3 started, she went straight for the tanks who were already standing at the north wall.
---
is this a priv svr thing?  a vanilla thing?  classic viable?
---
Go to youtube and watch a PoV of any decent tank and you'll see how wrong you are. The best tanks, fighting for threat against the best DPS in the world, only uses sunder when it's needed to make sure the buff stays up, sometimes it's even the off-tank that uses sunder every 30 sec and not the maintank. Only reason you'd ever want to spam sunder is if you're poorly geared and rage starved, however if you're stacking as much crit (agi) as possible (without sacrificing too much armor/stam obviously), as you should, and use fast weapons, you should never be rage starved.
---
I'm not a botter and I did not get banned or know anyone who got banned.
---
But honestly I don't fucking trust blizzard one effing bit anymore with this shit. So many automated bullshit systems where some AI determines if you get banned or not based on reports from angry people.
---
Adjusted for inflation, $20 might be worth as much as $20.
---
There are literally 0 APES members in on your Spy addon.
---
0 cauterizing bands so far. Cleared the last 12 weeks so you'd think one should drop. Less important but still annoying, we have seen exactly 0 Boots of Prophecy. It's cursed I tell you.
---
Grizzly members have legitimately confirmed it in game and even here on reddit so there is no paranoia mr wick
---
Exactly. If I botted I wouldnt bother because I know that me making a shitstorm would just result in me getting publicly outed and smacked down by Blizzard. Im doing this because they made a mistake, and I want others to know that people are having this problem
---
I tank a lot for people in my guild. Hate tanking in pugs.
---
You're missing my point I think. 
---
If you don't get your threat wiped by a fireball in phase 2 because phase 2 is like 30-40 seconds, you still don't get aggro when she lands if the tank is on point.
---
I tried tanking with above average feral gear as Moonglow. Did not go very well
---
I have always heard rumors of getting banned for buying gold but have never encountered someone who actually was. It always seemed like a scaremongering tactic. I have bought gold a handful times in the past and have never got a ban.
---
I was just leveling my warr and picked up a green off those vile familiars in orcs starting area
---
Read the last sentence in the OP.
---
I don't think tos applies here, the tank just pulls it from the right side so the other Warmasters don't aggro as far as I know. If they were leashed(?) to Drek they'd pull with him regardless.
---
The appeal button link is different then the standard support ticket, its in a different area
---
Not really.
---
If you afked in AV, bot or not, you got a ban, and it was deserved.
---
See you cheaters in June.
---
There is no guild bank in classic, but TSM was ported in from retail so that feature could still be in the options. TBH though, I didn't know TSM had auto repairs (I do that through ElvUI).
---
In vanilla your gear got invalidated by easy content in every expansion (although actually the Naxx gear was better than the level 70 normal difficulty 5-person dungeon gear o_O. That was a nice little reward).
---
But my point is, if you got MC gear a few months in to classic, that was still useful gear to build off of all the way until Burning Crusade.
---
In retail, your gear gets invalidated every *patch* by greens. So you have a total reset every 3-6 months. That seems a little excessive.
---
No guild bank in vanilla
---
If they banned me for that then hopefully they will clear that up once the appeal is looked at.
---
I mean... Blizzard would rather **not** ban people, as it's directly less money for them (a business).
---
Dont worry most of the top rankers don't have jobs or account share :)   rank 10 will happen for us joe schmoes its just going to take a bit of elbow grease and time.
---
Lock does fine damage in this version because every piece of item has its buffed spell spellpower, not to mention bwl is around the corner, a locks dps is fine and scales the hardest.
---
This is an exaggeration, and mitigated with proper preparation. Plus, raids are doing significantly more damage now than they did 15 years ago, and the fights significantly shorter as a consequence. The shorter the fight, the less a mana issue is relevant.
---
The tank can regain threat after his threat is wiped by hitting her while she is in the air. Her wiping threat when she lands is factually incorrect. There are literally thousands of logs that prove it.
---
I didnt bring up the weird automatic appeal thing, he just told me they normally dont do appeals in the webchat but he would look into my account, then after a few minutes gave me a canned response saying they weren't going to overturn their decison
---
&gt; “LF tank for arena runs, SGC on reserve!” 
---
This made me laugh and cry a bit at the same time. It's the same with people saying "LF tank for strat living, all orbs are reserved". Haha. 
---
On a more serious note: Yeah I guess you're right that most tanks by now have no reason to do 5 man dungeons - and especially with pugs - since they have the gear already.
---
And maybe it's just on my server, but we actually have a fair share of paladin and druid tanks. I enjoy having both as tanks. Druids are just awesome imo, and paladins are actually very enjoyable to have as tanks because it forces the dps (or maybe it's just me because I see plenty people pull aggro all the time from them) to be aware of their threat as the paladin can't taunt back a mob. When I joined my first dungeon group that had a paladin tanking a few months back I have to admit I was a bit unsure of how it would go, but it went really well and I haven't had any issues with paladin tanks at all since then.
---
Yes, it will stand, yes this what some people want. You will get your Classic Plus you can pre-order it now just google "Shadowlands" People can quit that's fine the Classic players will re roll the different faction on different servers. Servers will merge, queue times will go up; it doesn't matter. This is what some people want.
---
so profound
---
It has to be a gear or spec thing. Most bear tanks I have talked to, myself included, have to swap out armor pieces for more crit, otherwise you don't generate enough rage to be casting swipes. This man is delusional if he thinks bear tank is worse by far because of lack of block/parry.
---
Well its not rocket science is it?
---
You got banned. You either botted or you did not. If you did not, then you got banned for something else. AFKing in AV is not allowed. There's even an easy way to report people for it using the map.
---
If you think differently then you just have been made informed in the form of a 6 month ban. Learn your lesson.
---
Damn that looks like at least 10 times more sketchy than any of the vann pulls lol
---
Not that this matters at all, but why do you have multiple stacks of teleportation runes and arcane powder and other spell regents etc? anytime you teleport you're basically right next to a reagent vendor and can restock, I don't see the benefit in taking up extra bag slots.
---
I leveled with a Feral Bear spec and I couldn't consistently hold threat for mob packs of 4 or more. People often blamed me and it felt bad.
---
I had a revelation when doing Zul'Farrak for many many times and having 2 different dps in consecutive runs cast Blizzard on the final troll Boss and his add. It was at that moment I realized that it was the DPS fucking up all along. They really have no idea. When they pull aggro they just figure it was the tank's fault, and they can't kite the mob either. There's just a lot of awful players who are toxic to boot.
---
Am shadow, have a 96.2 parse average. I beat most mages and warlocks I come across, handily.
---
well shoot, I'm not gonna lie I think I'm the only one of my friends that uses click to move. Not exclusively though. My friends see me use it and they actually think its neat the things I use it for(auto pathing to a nearby npc or mob, traveling mid long distances and for just jumping around spinning like a mania etc) I've had the setting turned on since at least mop i think
---
To piggy bank on this i know blizz is loathe to change anything in vanilla but putting the dual spec thing in would be a god send for the late game dungeon experience.
---
Who's going to the the lil' elemental he's adopted?
---
Ok cool, good to know. For Ragnaros, is his damage against the tank all fire damage? So no mitigation from shield? 
---
My main is a healing priest and we just cleared rag for the first 2 times in the past 2 weeks
---
Yes, but daggers are stronger than using QS since you get the benefit of wearing gloves.
---
I play AV discords strictly to avoid playing with people like you, but thank you for your input and I hope this venting has helped you :).
---
This is exactly what I do and get her on me asap every time. Easiest method by far is to use this.
---
Why are you assuming that their are NO innocent people who got banned? Peopel that didn't afk or bot? I don't understand this mentality at all.
---
Just checked Onlsaughts log.
---
13 fireballs on mainly melee and some healers.
---
Only main tank has threat at all times even though he was hit with a fireball. (Except a short stint in phase 3 when a dps warrior goes a bit ham)
---
 [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/RYtq7fLAX4NaPkr3#fight=last&amp;type=threat&amp;target=18](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/RYtq7fLAX4NaPkr3#fight=last&amp;type=threat&amp;target=18)
---
Kromcrush one of the top servers
---
Thank you. And yes, I agree - it's hard work, and tanking as fury (especially 1h and shield fury tanking) is absolutely horrible. I mean, the dps almost just have to look at the mob to pull aggro from you lol.
---
This method was patched out and no longer viable.
---
My guild is Loot Council, and in fact I was recently promoted onto the council. Problem is, we rarely see mage gear period. I keep track of our loot log, and here's some fun facts: 
---
3 weeks ago we last saw Mageblade (next one goes to a warlock). 10 weeks ago was our one and only Arcanist Crown, I got mine in a pug during a week I couldn't make raid times. In fact, I said my crown is a funny story, it's because I won it in a pug and replaced Netherwind. I felt really bad for taking such a replacement, but the guild's luck has been so bad with them I ended up deciding to keep it instead of trading it.
---
We actually did see a talisman this last week, went to a warlock, so the next one does go to a mage! Won't be me, we have someone who has a Mageblade they got outside of a guild run that needs the next talisman. We've seen 5 talismans total, which is pretty good actually! We've seen 2 Netherwind Pants, last one being mine 8 weeks ago. Never seen Mana Igniting Cord. Never seen Arcanist Bracers. Last Arcanist Boots was 5 weeks ago, and we've seen only 3.
---
Log has been going for 12 weeks, we've been raiding for 14, and I added a talisman that dropped before I started keeping a log. I love Classic, though sometimes taking a step back and looking at this kinda stings. We disenchant so much Druid and Hunter gear weekly, and now most Warlock and Warrior tier is aswell...
---
banned people probably buy new accounts and being able to say " we banned 502341 botters this week" probably makes them look good idk.
---
It's just cheaper for them to use automated systems that may not work perfectly instead of actually checking things thoroughly
---
Probably wanna mention your server and faction.
---
Yeah when i did that it said my account had no actions on it or something along those lines, then when i checked my support ticket page it said "Submitted automated request for Appeal penalty" and already had resolved on it.
---
I have so I dont have go fill up so often 🙂
---
I took a feral druid tank into DMN and he absolutely exploded on the first pull. Ain't no chumps tanking that place.
---
Because I'm bad. I had every intention of tanking when classic launched but my memory of pre wrath tanking involved marking, kill orders and CC. The meta changed and I'm simply not good enough at the game to tank 4-6 mobs while the DPS all unload with AOE, I'm also too lazy to reroll.
---
Rag damage is about 60/40 Fire damage to physical. Fire Resistance isn't super important for Rag, but about 150-200 is a good number to have for your Main Tank.
---
rap dumb me smart
---
People ranked to R14 on private servers man. Some multiple times accross multiple pservers. The game is not going to die for them lol. It literally never did and now they have a Blizz official version.
---
Lets see here.
---
They don't apply a slow, so freedom is useless.
---
If you bop the mage they will agro to a healer.
---
Seems neither of those things is a good idea.
---
Saw Punkrats video too? The drama is impressive! PVP realms seem to attract some batshit crazy folk.
---
I mean..2% crit is all yoh lose
---
If they were entirely innocent bans, completely mistaken, why would you have anything of the sort to provide to them?
---
Thanks I added the server name
---
Of course it's streamed. It will never run natively on any console. Not that they aren't powerful enough, just that it's a ton of work to port the client.
---
It's one of the things you don't think about until you need it. Developers cannot create a product that only caters to the average player, they need to add those who are handicapped, color blind, deaf, have poor vision, etc etc etc etc.
---
Click-to-move is *perfect* for someone with motor control only in one arm/hand.
---
Ya first of all their bot detection is so solid they overturned a bunch  of the bans that occured from remote login causing a botting false positive during the first few weeks of classic.
---
Second the cheat detection is actually garbage and private botting software exists that has been undetected for years now.  Most of it is actually done manually based on reports.
---
WC is just a fixed modifier. Not remotely the same thing, except that they both stack to 5. That's the only similarity ... it's like saying ignite is the same thing as sunder.
---
Tanking pugs SUCKS big time. Also, it does take a decent amount of skill and know-how to do it correctly, and from my experience warriors are generally a 'ME SMASH NOW' type class. source-going on 15 years of maining a warrior :D
---
At this point I prolly wouldn’t refill back to my main server with a lock just because I can’t stand Gnome Warlocks lol... main server is PvP btw. So I would either push to 60 on new server lock or jump back and see if I can’t push my warrior through and just try to stay in dungeons lol
---
Very cool! Thanks
---
Lol what. AHK isn't against TOS in this scenario as it's only sending one keystroke. Many people who use GSE are aware of this and regularly use AHK or Punchkey to spam macros. I think you know less about botting/3rd party software than you are aware of. Setting up an svn for a combat routine and clicking start on HB was not complicated as the bypasses required now.
---
&gt;I thought it’s okay being afk.
---
You thought it was okay to join a BG and make the experience worse for 39 other people who are actively participating because you couldn't be bothered to work for your honor? That's an extremely selfish mindset. You want all the benefit without doing the work by being deadweight in a BG.
---
Thanks for the information.  As someone who is going to be getting classic by the weekend I'm looking into which server to join.
---
Yeah, the only item that will still work once you drop eng is the death ray. It is an odd bird, takes Gnome eng to craft, is bop, but doesn't require eng to still use.
---
Sure, but their dps will suffer more than other classes they have to conserve mana, like first kills.  In situations like 5 mans or farm raids where bosses die quickly Shadow Priests do very well.
---
larger worlds and server consolidation, perhaps? Last time I played retail it was a pure solo experience, only played with my wife and got fully purple &amp; legendary geared..
---
I don't buy your "several hours a day" story. I did a few yours for half the week and am rank 4 right now.
---
DnT is a common phrase but all of these poser guilds in Classic (there's like 5) are led by people claiming to be restarting the guild with real members (they're not)—except for one really small guild who just said they wearing the tag around as a shout-out. But of course the bigger poser guilds have tons of members and obviously not all of them know about the actual history of the name.
---
Anyway, the fake DnT on this post led by Nitrocircus who claims to be not just an original member but an officer of DnT(he's neither):
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XDvkBkp.png](https://i.imgur.com/XDvkBkp.png)
---
P. S. What original members do you have in your guild?
---
Yeah just do your lock on the PVE server. I love mine.
---
It's giga pulled out of his ass, we know that the record amount of people who subbed to WoW in one quarter was around 2 million at WoD launch, and the quarter in which classic released, they less than doubled the amount of subs, because they mentioned how they almost set a new record. We know this thanks to the quarterly earnings call by Activision. That's less than double with the most anticipated patch of BfA, 8.2, releasing just at the start of the quarter, so a fair amount of players can likely be contributed towards that.  
---
And his FFXIV numbers are most definitely off, along with his other concurrent player estimates. No game has 25-30% of their total playerbase online at any given time. Take OSRS for an example. At the time OSRS had almost 1 million subscribers, the concurrent players was usually close to 100K, and runescape also has f2p worlds, very likely inflating the amount of concurrent players vs subscribers. Or just look at csgo, more than 20 million monthly players, but around 700K concurrent players, which is the number he assumed classic also had. I can bring up more examples, but I think you get the point.  
---
Another point on FFXIV, the game had somewhere around 2 million subs at the launch of Shadowbringers, and since then, Shadowbringers has reached a total sales number of over 4 million, so their subcount has very likely increased by a significant amount since then.
---
if you end up waiting to play the warrior, support it with your priest.
---
powerlevel engineering, cooking and first aid. upgrade weapons constantly. At lvl30 get everything together for ww ax and have a guildie run you through it.
---
Bear is very much viable with at least a few pieces of good gear and a decent number of points in feral
---
I'm 50/50 feral and resto on my druid alt and I'm doing very well with both roles
---
Get an annihilator (most guild would/should help fund it) help put sunders up on EVERYTHING (while in battle/zerkerstance does little threat). Huge raid dps increase especially if your raid is melee heavy. And just stay in tank gear and be ready to pick something up if a tank goes down/extra add gets pulled. Doing this will benefit a raid more than a deep prot war trying to do real dps.
---
Executioner cleaver is a cheapest alternative to Khang for almost the same output
---
Yup aim shot takes FOREVER when I’m being hit
---
thanks for the details mr cummings :) i actually know this but i just pasted something in and left it i was lazy lol
---
i don't write code. i've done a lot of modification of other peoples work but I don't write anything myself.
---
What’s the reflector for hunters? Is battle chicken bugged in Classic right now? It seems to not agro and do anything.
---
How does one reset the Ony buff cool down timer? (Genuinely curious)
---
Good catch, I'll see if I can find another log with less people in it.
---
Yeah actually that shows they can catch you even if you VPN potentially. I would argue they should ban all remote login users.
---
Your argument is terrible if anything it furthers my point. You will be caught.
---
Yeah sure if you write your own botting software, that somehow randomizes all your actions, maybe you can go undetected for a bit. Good luck with that it's more work to do that than to just play the game.
---
I'm not sure why it matters how many fireballs there were if the trick I'm referring to works like I'm told it does.
---
Well then how do you distinguish between people who afk bot and people who outright suck?
---
What needs to happen, IMO, is not to ban AV botters because its such a grey area and theres so many bots... what makes more sense to me is to give AV Queue suspensions to AFK players. 3 days no AV. stuff like that. That way they can be a little more liberal with punishments and require less verification on rules being brokne.
---
Just flex on us casuals that you’re already in feralas on an alt.
---
Remember when Shakira was like the spanish Alanis Morisette but then she realized sex sells?
---
As the tank for my guild.... I am running with pugs often not because I enjoy it but because I can. It's a good way to meet new people and keep guild invite opportunities fresh. If you just sequester yourself inside your guild like some dainty princess instead of the MEATSHIELD of a murder machine you are, you are wasting social opportunities. Everything has a cost, even easy dungeon runs.
---
Playing like a bot isn't the same as running an automated script.
---
Unfortunately, my account with just 40 level undead mage hasn't been unbanned, and blizzard is lying straight to my face saying it has no cheating reports (I was guarding my mage with level 60 alliance druid and got multiple insults threats of getting reported, but they are saying it has none which I doubt). They say they won't reveal any details and suggested me "to uninstall the addons and programs from the PC". The mage that has never visited any BG and was just aoe levelling (can bots even do that?) got banned along with AV farmers, and my main alliance account is safe and sound. The report system is broken and I am completely sure that people are getting banned just for the high uptime activity plus false reports, and there has been no investigation towards whether we actually cheat or not. It sucks ass to be on the receiving end (in my case it's not the end of the world but still) but it sucks that community here actually thinks blizzard don't do any mistakes. I was thinking the same that you can't be banned if you're innocent, until that very thing happened to me.
---
I'm not going to give you information that leads to you obtaining botting related programs.
---
But you mean like a robot at your computer pressing space? lol
---
Okay cool story?
---
Yea, I’m soooooo jealous of a 6 month ban. Those botters are so lucky, they get everything while us regular players just get to continue playing normally. 
---
sO uNfAiR!
---
That's unfortunate. I've never gotten into PVP botting I'm guessing thats lower prio
---
Yes and I got the punishment for that. Guess I learned my lesson :) now to move on to another game. Wish you guys gl in classic
---
&gt;go to the US blizz support chat when it opens again and see what they say about it.
---
Why would I do that when I already know their stance on deliberate inactivity because its literally right there in their EULA?
---
Level what playing field? Horde win 99% of AVs as it is
---
O
---
Which doesn't matter because respecing is rather easy to do with how easy it is to make gold.
---
I personally love tanking dungeons. I'm a warrior. I'd do it as DW fury and switch between shields. I switched to deep prot a few weeks ago and I'm an absolute god in 5 mans with easy threat gen and concussion blow. 
---
I love doing it. It's fun with a good group. Unused to make GOOD money. But now that I'm pretty geared from raid each death is 2g+. Even with guildies I'll die sometimes. It's killed my joy. Walking out of a dungeon with a 7-10g repair bill crushes my soul. So if I run them now it's gotta be an A+++ group.
---
It's like the buff made you instantly blackout drunk
---
Laughs in premade
---
Get a boar. They have charge, which temporarily stuns, and a high defensive rating.
---
Im still a little salty about that enhancement shammy rolling on the hat from SM cath.  He was planning on going elemental in 3-4 levels.
---
You pyro to drop ignite, not frostbolt
---
Only Booty Bay, or Gadgetzan, Everlook and Ratchet as well?
---
Thanks. I feel like farming for dal rends would take a long time for a alt though. I was thinking quel/mirah's since I already have the book but I could buy a krol blade as well I presume. I'll keep quel for tanking.
---
A slow weapon isn't necessarily bad. More important than the # of heroic strikes is the % of your auto attacks you can turn into heroic strikes instead of white attacks.  Heroic strike has a lower hit cap and can't be a glancing blow compared to your white attacks, in addition your off hand gets a lower hit cap while heroic strike is queued, so your dps is increased significantly and you generate more threat. The bonus threat from heroic strike is actually a lot less than sunder armor in terms of threat/rage cost. So it's better to use a higher dps weapon like Deathbringer where you can more easily have a high HS % because there are fewer attacks you need to turn into HS, and then dump excess rage with sunder armor. On top of all this your windfury procs will also hit way harder.
---
Yes, allowing hundreds (thousands?) of bots to farm (steal) resources for several months, uninterrupted, and wreak havoc on the economy is so much more efficient.
---
Obviously this technique works because after a banwave, we never see bots again. The bot devs just can't figure out how to get around blizz's super secret, complicated algorithm. /s
---
They stun which fucks you.
---
They don't aggro on healer in the start because no healer is healing..  Once a healer pulls with a heal then the mage removes bop and the mobs come back to mage since he did a couple AE's maybe a sapper to get threat.
---
AFKing isn’t against the rules even if you think it should be.
---
I mean, it works if you use it correctly and have the technical aptitude necessary to, say, turn on your computer.
---
SP is subjective and not accurate to &gt;50% of scenarios, though it is a decent baseline if you don't want to put any work into improving your play.
---
Back in the original vanilla release, the world first Kel’Thuzad kill was in September 2006 I believe, but even by November there were fewer than 100 guilds that had cleared KT. My guild was world #69 clearing KT and kept raiding hard all the way up until Burning Crusade release, but even we only got two full clears before BC came out January 16th (Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc...). So barely anyone actually had a chance to farm the gear.
---
“Mint condition”
---
LBRS is where you start to see the difference between those spec tank and those not. your rotation is ok as long as you demo in def stance. My biggest tip is to use your group. ask the mage to sheep, nothing stops the AOE happy boi's like a sheep to break. if you have a druid or a 2nd warrior assign them their own mobs to off tank, same with hunter pet. Ice traps are great in LBRS. always mark targets. 
---
if you really want to keep tanking consider furry prot.
---
MS &gt; OS is a good and valid rule, though.
---
Once everybody has their MS loot, then everybody can start rolling for the OS loot.
---
So if you want to be a healer, than focus on that, and if you want shadow gear then roll OS whenever shadow loot comes up and nobody needs it.
---
2% crit is massive when you are comparing gear.
---
I'm really sorry to hear this. It's so sad that people have to act this way - it's a friggin game after all.
---
Keep it up man and ignore the haters, I'm sure you're doing great.
---
I've never botted in a game or been banned for botting. It's hard to imagine you're not just being a troll at this point.
---
this is pretty much the only "fun" answer. Shield slam crits are fun, but few and far between. fury-prot will give you some more versatility in raid and you get to actually kill things quickly outside of raids. The thing I miss the most from years of deep-prot is losing tactical mastery.
---
Agreed. The dynamics of a guild and manning are night and day when you can get by in 10 mans. I would also like to hazard a guess that the sheer number of dungeons in TBC and wrath, who only had like three bosses affects things. You can do one scholo and get half your set for both DPS and tank if the loot gods align and you're the only plate wearer.
---
Incendius seems to be quite healthy on both sides.
---
Bigglesworth! Alliance is solid. Horde is solid. Economy is strong.
---
Not sure if this is relevant but I play shaman and I never heal for three reasons, one I don't have the gear for it, two I don't have the talents for it and three, and most importantly, I just don't like that playstyle. I love doing damage and I hate healing. Someone in-game told me it was a waste of class because I didn't also heal, well I just want to be an enhancement shaman, nothing else.
---
It is 3, the same time signature means people are taking splash damage. He's still wrong since the phase 1 tank does not get aggro in phase 3, indicating his threat was wiped but not everyone else's, which is what he's trying to prove wrong.
---
I bought the Razor mouse with the 12 mouse buttons on the side. one is permanently bound as autorun toggle. It saved my wrists.
---
I bottled multiple accounts back in the day, only lost maybe 3 of 50+ that I either played or sold.
---
My main account I was able to get exalted with av without ever playing it. 
---
That's why you're jealous and whining.
---
Well one of my buddy’s got one these bans and I know for a fact that he doesn’t bot cuz I log on everyday before he gets on and when he gets on we play together he gets off and I’m still playing (I’m a real fucking loser) he only logs on after he works and we actively doing shit together in game and talking on discord so you are just plain wrong here blizzard fucked up and for some reason and mass banned a bunch of people for something they didn’t do...why would they wait to ban a bunch of people on day then to just ban them as they are bottling
---
While I don't believe most of the sob stories I do believe there are a few false positives in there somewhere. Statistically there has to be.
---
Someone already answrrd. But clearly the mage isnt tanking so aggro doesnt matter. And homie thats nothing, ive had to break 1m just to stay in the running.
---
This is exactly correct.
---
MS &gt; OS is always the rule, for a reason.
---
The game is so much worse when nobody can get their MS loot because hybrids want it "just in case", etc.
---
That "it is a raid mate" is a funny move though xD.
---
I also had to not invite shadow priests a few times already. For example for DMW because Shadows need that MP5 trinket.
---
&gt;When you are so obsessed with a game, that you feel the need to run a program for the 20% of the day you're NOT at the computer, then you have no life and should get some serious help.
---
I can't believe many folks fall into this camp.  I don't bot, but if I did, I'd automate all the repetitive stuff, let it run \~12 hours/day, and play the \~2 hours/day doing interesting things, not the other way around.
---
I thought that was a scorched earth policy via orbital plasma cannon.
---
Cool wanna post some proof insane person
---
Welcome to Vanilla wow.
---
I fully agree with that. The only downside to fury prot is not having tac mastery. However, it forces you to play a little different and shows you how to stance dance without it.
---
Uuuh ... if you don't have a basic understanding of programming, sure, you won't know how to make an infinite loop or generate a random number. I never said that if you don't know anything about programming, you're gonna intuitively know how to code.
---
What I said is, programming is really intuitive. It's made to be easy, with a very neat and understandable way of writing things. So, learning the basics isn't hard and doesn't take a long time.
---
But failing that you can just google something like "spacebar repeat autohotkey script" and find what you want in a matter of seconds.
---
I'm not very smart and I don't really care. I've got the basics in programming down but that's it. I was answering "how simple can this actually be" and the answer is, very simple.
---
Edgemasters doesn't affect 2h skill and OEB already has weapon skill. Warriors are expensive so if you're not looking to put much time into it either get Aged Core gloves or muggers belt and Lobotomizer/glacial, or OEB or Glacial/flurry/edge. LHH is one of the best items you can get so if you can minimize gold elsewhere for an alt do it
---
Probably the VIP one or w/e others there are. Ours is usually all brown.
---
This isn’t the first time blizzard has ever dealt with bots. Also, all the bots I’ve seen are horribly promgrammed so i highly doubt many of these are “false positives” when it’s more than likely someone using some form of auto clicker. It’s not human for someone to click something in less than 1ms from click to release. It’s not normal to click the same exact pixel every time you do something. Not saying this is the cause, but this is one example as to how you could track a human vs a bot or banned third-party program. Hope this helps!
---
That's not pathetic at all. Celebration comes in all forms :D
---
I think there may have been.
---
&gt; Literally every warrior tank I ran with rolled on every bit of leather DPS gear I saw on my rogue
---
See, that's a valid complaint about a tank taking OS gear when it was your MS.
---
&gt; On my Druid I tell people what I’m going to roll on and it doesn’t change with my role in group... I’ll do whatever but the stuff I want is the stuff I want and if it drops I’m going to roll on it.
---
And now you're doing exactly what the warrior did to your rogue.  You're stealing OS loot from somebody's MS.
---
Purple lotus. Large brilliant shards. Mooncloth. Black lotus. All of the materials for nature / shadow / frost protection potions.
---
The farming sucks if you are not one of the classes with a good, reliable, instances farm (ie. hunter, mage or warlock) or have one as an alt. I'm really glad I rolled warlock, farming consumables for weeks takes a few hours in DME.
---
Ootl there was a ban wave?
---
Salty people, damn.
---
curious, how do so many players know when someone is turning in the quest to prepare for the buff?
---
Who the fuck is pretending this is a hardcore game for "elite gamers"?
---
Most people (Asmon for example) agree that this game is incredibly casual and good for casual players.
---
Not having growl was my first thought but he did specifically say the pet has growl.
---
Think 2-3 phases ahead. Chances are people are already stocking up on valuable items and they will be worth nothing when the content is released.
---
When you pull the last guard, you can dive past it, breath, run to the next pack, breath, pick up the dogs too, send it to the right pack and return to stay often without getting hit.
---
I mean for the time period in history that most resembles WoW it kinda was.
---
Ive witnessed to many times that people reply in group with "damn i forgot this and that" so I always come prepared.  Even if it takes up space,  im fine with it. Its just 6/80 spaces used
---
Good to hear another banwave went out.
---
I caught two bots in Azshara last night. A spriest and bm hunter. I kept the priest drinking with viper sting for at least a few minutes solid and I despawned the hunter's pet twice by kiting it out of range, forcing the hunter to melee their naga quarry.
---
It was a fun way to kill time until raid.
---
Sharding is only on retail.
---
Where do you play?
---
Meta-slaves saying "Shamans cant tank."
---
Fucking nerds.
---
All the AV grinders who play AV non stop, the people who ganked flight paths non stop in phase 2, the people who whine if you don't have your full BIS for molten core because it will take 5 seconds longer to down the boss. Those types of people.
---
Warrior who dives dungeons regularly and confidently, always wearing level-relevant blue gear from bosses and dungeon quests, has built up a list of amiable healers and dps happy to join him for guaranteed loot and xp: **Tanking? No problem.**
---
Warrior who's hating leveling because he isn't getting decked in blue gear, skipped early dungeons, didn't learn threat mechanics or try defensive stance (or even acquire defensive stance), bought into the leather &gt; mail meme, and has to go into the PUG life alone because the few friends he made while solo grinding for his xp are offline: **LF1M tank for SM Arm, pst helm and ravager on res**
---
/join lfg works great!
---
lmfao goes 0 to 60 so fast from a wholesome rp
---
Perspective.
---
No add-ons, the internet was in a much more basic state, no one was looking up YouTube boss guides, etc.
---
Even if Naxx and everything else is in the same state we'll see it on farm for people within a couple months.
---
People like to feel special and claiming that it's a harder version lets them do so.
---
It's better to look for a guild in-game. Ask people you group with or ask in chat until you find a good fit.
---
Rolling for a different spec is fine as long as the group is aware of it. My rule is that each person only gets one spec to roll on though. You're healing and want to roll on DPS gear? Fine, but you don't get healing gear too. Pick your "MS" for the dungeon, and stick to it.
---
The objective of this post was to attract more alliance as well. Thank you for the upvote!
---
Ofc he was spamming hamstring. We were always having 6+ mobs attack him for extra rage while I provided WF totem and heals for 0 downtime
---
I've seen a few posts about botting and bans. Was there a recent "ban wave"?
---
RemindMe! 3 days
---
Repeating the same stuff as everyone else using 2 tanks,  one for phase,  one for phase 3.  The other difference that we do is at 70HP% every blows all their cooldowns and we usually have onyxia in the 45-50% hp range before she takes off.  (We run heavy fury warriors)
---
So phase 2 is quick and we get to phase 3 aggro dance game.
---
well this is dumb rap.
---
Because I'm spec'd boomkin, raid as a healer, and respecs cost too much. I'm not reserving Righteous Orbs to mitigate Respec costs, because it sucks when none drop. That and it seems greedy when people in my guild need Crusader enchants and robes made.
---
You did make the title though.... which is misleading.
---
Standing 1 on my server still haven’t been banned.
---
Its been less than 24 hours at this point so I dont really expect them to compensate me i guess. Kinda sucks that i missed raid and the tail end of ranking this week but im just happy to have my account back at this point.
---
Yet the "hardcore" players treat it as such.
---
This so much. I ran with a warrior, pally, rogue, feral DPS + Druid heals the other day. It was so efficient and we were all the same page, until it came to rolling for gear.
---
Quel/Mirah is a good combo.  The total weapon DPS and midrange speed of Quel still makes it better than many other weapons as a MH. The proc is also very desirable for DW tanking since you're not able to block and lose out on 2000+ armor. 
---
Don't forget your Greater Stoneshield Potions!
---
My favourite part of a discussion. When the incorrect party realizes he was wrong and starts pulling out insults instead of reconsidering his incorrect views lol.
---
I wasn't botting!
---
But I was using an auto clicker!
---
They arnt false and you guys deserve it. You guys got picked up by some anti cheating software and your movement were bot like.
---
Even if you weren't botting/ using autoclick( I know you were) you probably were one of those guys who sat in AV afk not helping your team. GOOD RIDDANCE.
---
Second this
---
Multiple reasons I no longer tank for pugs.
---
1. Repair bills when pugs wipe more. As plate each wipe costs us upwards of 2g when you get really good gear.
---
2. You mark targets, standard skull, X, moon and people still dont CC or hit the wrong damn target. Make life easier on your tank and healer.
---
3. No one waits for tank threat or sunders
---
4. Some people pull before the thank leaving us to waste a taunt early or try and get threat back, on multiple mobs this is a huge pain as a warrior. Not as bad on druid or paly as they have much better aoe threat.
---
5. People tend to front load their DPS on pulls trying to top meters and constantly agro, as a tank this is insanely annoying when you're trying to control the pull and keep everyone alive.
---
6. Raiding - as a raider we generally only run with about 3 tanks in MC. So all the other warriors in my guild at least 10 of us are DPS spec. I'm not paying a weekly respec fee which goes up 5g each time to have to switch back to Prot or fury/prot. If I had duel spec I'd absolutely leave one of them as a tanking build.
---
7. If in the event someone dies or theres a full wipe they always blame the tank for not holding threat. Any criticism of their stupidity is met with well your just a bad tank. Basically giving us all the feeling of "Fuck this not worth the hassle".
---
The min/maxers will repeat the same recycled comment that Seal Fate "isn't good until AQ40."  The reality is it's a great spec where you sacrifice a little bit of dps for a lot of fun.  It also gives you an opportunity to break the cookie cutter gear template and go for more crit.
---
Whoops, meant OEBs
---
I love the dumb drama in classic. For me it’s the best part of the game. Even on my little realm there’s so much drama
---
UPDATE!: UNBANNED! Must have been an issue, and proof that these things CAN get appealed when not guilty.
---
Walk your dog?? How do you get up to walk a dog and not auto? I officially call shenanigans
---
Makes sense, Booty Bay is run by the Blackwater Raiders, unlike the other Steamwheedle settlements. So these folks are more akin to sailors and thus drink their hearts out! BOTTOMS UP, ME HEARTIES!
---
Yea nothing I've seen so far in classic has in any way lined up with your weird beliefs.
---
Just a quick note: If you have the option available to you, then level a warrior with a friend (preferably a healer, but really any class/role will do). It makes the leveling experience MUCH more enjoyable, and the entire "leveling a warrior is painful" completely disappears.
---
As far as pvp ranking yes it is just a grind but raids are face roll now because we only have MC and ONY. With later raids fights get more complicated and significantly longer.  
---
As far as pre bis goes. Sure one person without it isnt a problem, but when raids start making exceptions for one, how is it fair to expect it of others, making an exception for one means you have to make the exception for multiple and that is where fights start to take longer, and longer fights means more chances of bosses double criting and killing tanks, or healers going oom. And wipes add on a ton of time.
---
Also it's not hard to farm the majority of pre bis. People dont want to give gear or a spot to people that cant put in the smallest of effort.
---
You say that like anything from Kazzak is realistic in the least.
---
[here's a guy in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ei1mdq/forcing_msos_in_5_mans_is_dumb_and_would_ruin/fcn5yiq) who thinks tanks specifically need to let the group know they also want fury gear over a rogue
---
At the start of ph3 everyone uses fain death and fade or whatever to help drop aggro. Most the time our tank has no problem we keep fear ward up on him and yeah we havnt wiped ony in a while it feels. No t2 priest helm yet :(
---
Always since 1.7.0, which was after BWL was out.

---
You realize how easy it is to randomize a time interval variable?
---
The problem with discussions about bots is that the general public are so poorly informed about how automation works that there is a lot of false confirmation about detection.
---
There is only one hard fight in Vanilla raids, and its skippable.
---
Yeah that's pretty cool actually. Might grab a serpent
---
Wow, congrats on getting unbanned. Got a buddy in my guild who’s in the same situation maybe he’ll also get unbanned
---
I generally think it is funny when people try to derive a level of elitism from Classic.  It’s all been done before and nothing is necessarily hard.  
---
Even the mediocre moments in Classic far surpasses the fun I had from playing League, which is a toxic shit show, and Arena/HS, losing to terrible RNG and boring as shit meta.
---
Text isn't proof.
---
That is correct that they probably take as much time, but there are other aspects to what makes a game "hardcore". To reiterate, I am not claiming at all that classic is for elite or pro gamers.
---
In League, Overwatch, or CS:GO, you get match made into a group. Now, imagine you had to form your groups like you did just like in WoW. For a 40 man raid, it's literally a job and you have to manage people, organize schedules, loot council, etc. If you have half your raid not show up, you just missed a week/opportunity at loot.
---
For PVP to get Rank 14, you would literally have to play 18 hours a day, 6-7 days a week for 3-4 months. I can't imagine any other game that would command such a time sink and thats pretty hardcore if a game could make someone want to do that.
---
No you don't.
---
you have a priest from the opposite faction MC the guy standing next to the head and then you kill him. It resets the timer
---
I have AHK always running, but I have nothing that affects WoW in it. I have system things like hotkey combos for specific volume levels or setting windows to specific sizes and positions. I occasionally get paranoid if I use those hotkeys with the game running, but I've had AHK for almost a decade and I've been fine. All my automated tasks are scripted to stop when bnet is not running, which is the trigger that assumes a game is running.
---
clearly this guy is a botter.  #ReBan

Mouse movement is client side. The server isn't tracking where your cursor is when it isn't clicking something or dragging your camera around **while you're moving.**

At least one ban has been a false positive. My suspension has been removed.

Lesson learned though, Reddit is not nice towards people who get bans.

Down rank consecrate and you can go 4-5 pulls. 
---
DPS just need to not be window lickers (asking to much 🤣). 
---
Solves most of my mana issues. And the ones that dont listen die.
---
Oh that’s not too terrible, still I’m good faith adding something for  putting you out would be good on them. Especially since it was deemed an error.
---
Here s to hoping you get banned.
---
Sounds like you're just trying to find something to be butthurt about. They do it because that's what's fun for them.
---
Plus, when zg comes out, you'll ditch the wolf for a wind serpent, so grab the model you want now imo.
---
This. I was running Strat UD and had an ele shaman in my group. Robes of the Exalted dropped and he won the roll. I wish he would have said that's what he wanted before I dedicated an hour to the dungeon because truth is I would've found a new group. Haven't seen the robes since, and it's hard enough finding dungeons with AV out.
---
Organize a few guilds and roll for loot, np. We've managed to get Lord Kazzak every spawn except 1. 45/55 A/H, one of the most populated servers on EU.
---
Zul' Gurub is THE catch up raid. If you hit sixty after everyone has their gear from BWL and ZG, it will be a breeze to gear and you should see extremely smooth runs wherever you go.
---
You're confusing the terms, Hardcore =/= Elite. It *can* mean that, but it isn't the rule.
---
It's a hardcore time sink and thats for sure.
---
Its literally an intended mechanic, its not like they accidentally put a pond with fish in there. AFKing and botting are not intended mechanics and they specifically have systems to punish you for doing it.
---
Thalnos if you’re going alliance!
---
Who finds 10 man camping flight paths fun? They did it to be "hardcore."
---
So a random integer between 108492 ms and 143532 ms then. It isn't hard to randomize actions. It isn't an effective detection method.
---
Who are these hardcore players you're referring to that treat it as such. Nobody treats it like that.
---
For quordinated/experienced guilds sure, but for casual guilds and pugs there are a ton on challenging fights.
---
He's probably selling gold...
---
Thanks, but that goes without saying. I'm looking for an addon that works like the BC LFG interface worked or something similar.
---
Me too, warriors can wear cloth+

Play on a PvE server with a good balance between horde and alliance. Unless you really like PvP

Is there a way to get decursive to cast macros instead of spells?

Could've been from an earlier instance that was overturned. Still doesn't prove you're not currently banned.
---
You moron, his ban was overturned. Learn to read
---
This, but keep in mind if OP wants to craft his BiS gear, he'll need to pick up Tailoring again to get Bloodvine set when ZG releases.
---
Of course we can blame you for the queues. You voluntarily sign up for a heavy server and then complain it's a heavy server. You people are insane.
---
I hate to sound like a downer but that's just how life works in general. You can't expect everything to be handed to you. You have to work hard and put in the time to progress, whether in game or in life.
---
Fake News.
---
Dude, nobody cared then any nobody cares now.
---
10% extra crit on 5 stacks compared to 50% extra crit on frozen targets. Might be a similar result over large samplesize, depending on how often you use nova.
---
it's a relief. But it pisses me off that the subreddit and community literally shit all over me even when I was innocent. Sad sad state of affairs we got here when someone who is innnocent of botting is just shat all over without a second thought about it!
---
please remember me why i care
---
The Purge is intensifying.
---
not in this phase boyo.  Fury for dps and AV, prot for tanking raids.
---
"I don't want to hearthstone" you are also in the queue which will return you to your queue spot. You deserve every second you are stuck there.
---
Speak for yourself, my two bots are still levelling fine.
---
lol we do but ok
---
go on and fulfil your guild name policing duties and keep showing us how much you know what you're talking about
---
Epstein didn’t kill himself
---
Well, I was the third tank in my guild and wanted to be more productive. Doing more DPS seems to be more helpful for my guild which I am totally fine with. No I in team.
---
All of you are flaming this guy and making assumptions and he literally just got the ban overturned because it was a mistake.
---
Retail also requires you to organize and manage people for raids, except the organization is just the beginning of skill expression, as opposed to the end. Classic is just a watered down version of retail in terms of difficulty.
---
Every other competitive game I listed requires that much of a time commitment to hit the top rank, the only difference is it doesn't force an unhealthy lifestyle akin to a mobile game. You can grind ranks on your own schedule, but in return, you actually have to play well to win.
---
If they banned people for buying gold you could end up in a situation where guilds grief other guilds by buying gold for their MT or RL.
---
er.... what?
---
Imagine if Cold Snap worked on Arcane and Fire abilities in this scenario...
---
No, the one from feralas to the island. :)
---
It's a hardcore time sink which takes dedication. Imagine wiping on Onyxia because a player pulled aggro when they shouldn't have. You just added 15min to your raid to corpse walk, rebuff, ready check and attempt again.
---
If you made League like that where if you lost a game, you and your group of 5 would be timegated by 15min before you can queue for a game again. Now imagine you lose 3-5 times in a row and you get time gated every time. That's some dedication you gotta have.
---
Yeah!
---
Why? They put a floor there so people can afk on it...
---
Stop trying to defend fishing, you’re being selfish. There is 0 difference between someone who afks in AV and someone who fishes. Theyre both useless and arent contributing. 
---
Go fish outside of av and stop ruining peoples chances by hogging up a slot
---
**I said bye bye botter**
---
Just makes your attitude shittier if it means you could help but take pride in being a scumbag haha. Top 3 lock over here btw just incase you thought I'd actually be impressed by that rofl
---
They did it because at the time it was the most efficient way to farm honor and they wanted to get a jumpstart on their honor for when the gear drops. That's literally the entire explanation. You're trying to pin some label on some mythical people that you've created that cry out about how hardcore classic is. Those people don't exist. You're just yelling at clouds to give yourself something to whine about.
---
No contest, you want the one that gives damage, the other is only for healing.
---
I play Warlock. I have tanked (well, off tanked, but could hat MT'd since most of the mobs we were tanking were the same, besides bosses later) UBRS before among other random dungeon trash. I knew I could tank well enough for probably any 5 man when I tanked (well, split tank with my VW) the big black dragonkin in UBRS. All the other mobs were easy peasy to tank though.
---
I'm sure many know but SL warlocks don't make for the worst tanks ever. More or less you tank "with" your voidwalker, but you can face-tank stuff just fine within reason. If you are actually trying to do it, best way is to let VW soak some damage, then you pull threat by stopping his taunts and using searing pain. Then you alternate between drain life/searing pain for threat. Can also split into two "tanks" for any pulls that need.
---
won't go into too much detail but SL/Nightfall especially with 3pc and 5pc t1 (3pc kinda important, 5pc helps a lot) has a lot in its "kit" to help assist with damage, 1440hp healthstone of course, 30% damage mitigation from soul link, VW 10% physical damage reduction on top of that for the warlock, death coil when safe/emergencies, and of course the big daddy 2.6k hp VW sac shield. Oh but you still need your voidwalker? Don't worry, near-insta cast summon him again (keep the shield!) with Fel Dom.  
---
Oh yeah, and we can tank Ony.
---
Incendius is the best server, no doubt.
---
Nice screenshot u found on google after typing “ban overturn wow”
---
Pre-raid BiS - UBRS in particular can easily fill half of them. Strat and Scholo also have some nice pieces like the Valor set. BRD for SGC and HoJ if you feel like the luckiest man alive.
---
As other have also said, attunements and if you want, honor/rep grind.
---
Typical assumption that everyone who says that is lieing, would you like me to show you all my F&amp;F invite alphas, classic beta invite on first wave? I was a hardcore raidleader and GM of a succesful guild for over a decade, you meet people along the way.
---
I use Puggle and it still functions. It does not auto group you. All it does is scan all the global channels and make a nice neat list of all the spam grouped by dungeon.  You still need to whisper the party lead for an invite.
---
LOL you are literally so pathetic. 
---
I've never botted and never will. stay mad you fucking baby.
---
Warrior Tank here. I'm under the impression that many Warriors don't want to tank because of the leadership aspect that comes with it. A big deterrent for many is the idea of knowing the pulls, fights and abilities of enemies that seem daunting to many. After all, if a Tank does not know mechanics of a pull, it could potentially wipe a group or raid. If a tank loses aggro to some overly aggressive DPS, they are quick to blame the tank. Specifically in my case, I couldn't remember from all of the pulls in UBRS from 10 years ago. I did conservative, methodical pulls and made sure to pull to areas where healers had LOS, and DPS had room to work without risk of adds, not to mention making sure the mana users had time to drink etc.  Managing all of this and some toxic DPS whispering me saying things like, "anytime today would be nice" or "can you go faster, I have things to do". Or one of the DPS AOE a group before you have had time to throw two sunders out, resulting in trying to pickup all of the threat you just lost. Then the caster has the nerve to run away from you instead of bringing the mob to you. Most players don't want the success or failure or a raid on their shoulders, and don't want to deal with backseat tanks. Just my two cents.
---
I'm talking about private servers.
---
My guildie just got unbanned as well. These are definitely a thing
---
The irony here calling someone ignorant.

Beilive? I honestly dont care lol

That doesn't answer the question.  Why would you have anything to provide to them?  What would be in it?

What about horde cities?

By the way - if I do the 4) option - complete Succubus Quest - can we engage Phalanx - or is that option then gone?
---
Druids get (15 + (spirit / 5)) mana per tick. Innervate increases your mana regen by 400% for 20 seconds. Meaning 50 spirit would do the following.
---
50 / 5 = 10mp5 passively, 40 mp5 while innervate is active, an extra 160 mana over 20 seconds with innervate.
---
Oh no! I have been attacked! Did your bot type that?
---
Damn everyone ripped you in your last thread
---
/join lookingforgroup
---
It's an official server wide channel intended to be used for forming parties, raids, and guild recruitment.
---
Ask if any levelling guilds are recruiting, you'll probably get a few whispers.
---
Nah. You can do BWL in pre-raid BiS. Most guilds need gear because of lack of skill, not because it's actually required.
---
We've had alot of mageblades and toeps. 0 Bre, 0 Spinal, 0 Viskag, 1 Deathbringer.
---
people like me??? You're literally on a subreddit getting HAPPY that people are having a shitty time because they were wrongly banned for something they did not do. It is so utterly pathetic that this is what you find happiness in and I seriously feel bad for anyone who has to be in your presence because you're seriously SO pathetic.
---
The disconnect that we may be having is that we have differing definitions of hardcore. Yours appears to be solely skill based. I would like to amend my definition to be dedication. Now skill needs time and dedication, but dedication does not require skill to be dedication. 
---
If I am dedicated stamp collector doing that 18 hours a day every day forgoing other important aspects of life (dating, chores, cooking meals vs eating out to save time) I would consider that hardcore.
---
Probably should keep you banned if you’re just afking a team match. You’re practically a bot at that point
---
Banning a bot dev 100 times in a row means he has to rebuy subscription. Banning a bot dev once every six months, means disrupted server economy, money from bot selling in the bot dev pocke. Banning in waves is only good for the guy selling bot software. If you ban him every detection, he will not have a product to sell and will give up trying after having to rebuy his 100th sub. 
---
Ban waves = free money for botters and bad for real users. 
---
Unfortuneatly, blizzard employees are usually the ones selling the bots.
---
Send another appeal, stay calm, and provide evidence if you can that you were playing the account at all times and to look at chatlogs. I wrote some examples in this topic. If you are truely innocent you will get unbanned but don't  let emotions drive the conversation or appeal.
---
I’m just imagining doing the lawnmower as this comp; a conga line of jumping mages spamming arcane explosion while the horde evaporates around them.
---
Lmfao, do you also doubt the moon landing? Nothing ever happens, keep living in your own little bubble bud. I hope you never encounter any injustice because nobody is going to ever believe you or help you.
---
Who the hell thinks Blizzard infallible? Most everyone has had an issue with Blizzard or knows someone that has, which got reverted because it was a mistake. If it’s legitimate and the evidence (or lack thereof) checks out, they have always been more than willing to admit a mistake and revert things.
---
You should be banned for afking
---
So it's AutoHotkey that gets people banned? Started using a script two days ago to fix my broken mouse by suppressing multiple left clicks within x ms (damn you Logitech, second mouse this stupid double click problem occurred).
---
Never used any other bot, script, imorph or automation software and woke up to a 6 month suspension. Using this account since 2005 and haven't gotten as little as a warning since then. Currently awaiting my appeal response.

Any time you make a post that's addressing something the community is doing on the forums, rather than on the game itself, you're circlejerking.

---
I've dpsed in an UD Strath with a shaman tank heals didn't go oom on Baron, though Rammstein's threat drop was painful.
---
and even now, in the thread of my original comment people are telling me im lying and that im still a botter hahahaha, you cant make this shit up dude.
---
This dude who you've provided absolutely no evidence to even being a real person or in this situation?  You're just talking out your ass at this point about everything as far as I'm concerned.
---
Fears and Incapacitating effects (Sap, Gouge, Goblin Rocket Helm, etc)
---
Depending on how fast the mobs go down, you can DW during it if its not straining your healer too much. Dont go furyprot though, thats a pure raid spec and should not be used in dungeons unless really good geared with a geared healer. It makes any stancedance incredibly clunky and bad, speaking from experience. I usually charge, whirlwind, def stance demo shout and the revenge/sunder between targets. Needs some extra time on packs that cant be charged.
---
Oh yeah? Well my guild has like 50 R14s from Vanilla! So there! Some have yet to hit 60, but like why would the lie?
---
You still don't need to invis, you can keep running and jump up onto the ledge by Vaelan to reset mob aggro. If you draw too much heat just fear em and keep running. I've done this as a mage 40-50 times for guildies and have helped shadow priests, locks, and mages, and they all have their ways to get through the whole run solo pretty easily with a little practice.
---
Could also be. But from a genuine player perspective there is not much difference between them. Bots with extra steps.
---
Are you a 12yo? Holy shit, grow the fuck up.
---
I can give a tip. Farm Maraudon, dungeons, level skinning and farm oozes, stone guardians and devilsaur in un'goro 😂
---
Same but I actually was jumpbotting in the cave in AV.  Lucky I was by the computer.  He encouraged me to find better ways to help my team.
---
I’m sorry, I was 16.
---
I am happy to hear you got unbanned, don't be afraid to share your story the next time someone innocent gets pitchforked.
---
Who uses yahoo mail?
---
Where are you getting this shit from? I havent posted on any ban threads till i saw ur dumb comment
---
Nah, could've been taken weeks ago. There's no timestamp or anything to give a reliable date.
---
AFKing is the same leeching behavior as botting. Ban these mofos.
---
have you done the quest to win AV? rewards a blue hammer with mp5.
---
Multiple Addons I think. ClassicLFG is still there and works fine. Though there are fewer groups now around then on release of course :)
---
And what if youre a lvl 60 warrior in bad gear?
---
I didn't care when people made posts that they got banned and I still don't care when people make posts that they are unbanned.
---
I just move around with Auto walk and my no cable mouse from my couch while watching Netflix lol don’t want to play Av is boring but I need epic gear.
---
The fact that you gave him an opportunity to pay the winner back is really quite forgiving and in no way warranted lol
---
Probably Faerlina.
---
Afk in AV... This is what you wanted classic so much? I dreamed about this and playing private servers for years since 2008... Man
---
It's pretty much expected that hybrid classes also fill roles other than their MS. At least in my experience the loot spec is not explicitly declared, people just roll on items they came to the dungeon for.
---
I don't know how much difference shadow vs. holy in healing means since I never played a priest but if I was gearing a shadow priest and found I'm healing most of the time I might as well spec for healing if it makes a big difference just to get my shadow set and then respec back.
---
It was, a couple times. Thanks for it again, I guess?
---
Lol, what's better than yahoo?
---
keep talking you pathetic slug
---
I ran a couple adding that gave a halfway decent two stick control and streamed to my iPad for awhile. Wasn't much use, to be honest. If you could play truly mobile, that would be great, but as it is you have to stream from a PC, which means leaving a remote client open, which is never a good idea no matter how secure it is.
---
Yeah they convinced me that I had legitimately done something wrong
---
I don’t like pvp that’s why I afk. Just want the gear for threat in pve I’m a tank
---
Being released on every console for the next 100 years
---
Lol
---
For some things, I can see the roll as an upgrade being justified.  In others, not so much.  If you don't say anything about rare drops or drops in general, the assumption is that MS&gt;OS.  And that MS&gt;other uses.
---
I had multiple mages roll against me for clear upgrades in Scholomance because they wanted both Magisters and Necropile pieces, respectively for unknown reasons, as they didn't equip either during the run.  Neither said a word about the roll, even after I called them out for taking a substantial upgrade from me.
---
If you want gear for OS or other purposes, the appropriate response is to say, "Mind if I need for X?"  Otherwise, don't be salty when people call you out on it.  I've passed on numerous dps pieces that would have been great for my farming/leveling as a disc priest but I passed because the mages/locks weren't able to roll on the healing pieces.
---
Would I be salty that an enhance shaman or feral druid needed on the robes from UD Strat when I've been using Devout for weeks?  You bet your ass I would.  Some drops are corner stones to specs and builds.  Taking those pieces for your off spec when the main spec has been farming for weeks is just being a total dick.
---
Your reply wins for the most stupid response on the internet today. It's so stupid that it doesn't even justify a proper response.
---
Lol.
---
It's not about Blizzard making mistakes, we all know they do, but the response from this subreddit was that ALL bans were diserved and should quote "eat shit"   
---
This post is about the subreddits response, not Blizzards mistakes.
---
I am down voting you for posting like a tool, not because you got unbanned.
---
I mean... right, that is why everyone hates you.
---
Your own email provider with full control. If you don’t use that it doesn’t matter if you use gmail yahoo etc
---
Yeah, i've got some big staff from doing the argent dawn questline though so i'm not really sure what'd be an upgrade. Kind of holding out for the one from MC, aurastone or w/e and grabbing that lei offhand from the frostwolves, already exalted just waiting for an exuse to buy it
---
Are you kinda bored any want something to do? A new goal? Get smoking heart and level Enchanting, could be really fun/ most dungeons are easily soloed by a druid. If not, don't worry about it.
---
Eat it!
---
Unless you’re like my guild that got a handful of eyes off the bat and then after splits with 2 clears a week we went 5 weeks without an eye. Just finally got our last raider priest an eye and we have 28 full mc clears lol
---
Proton  for Secure Emails
---
Gmail for what ever.
---
Honestly though.. nearly anything.
---
Enough said.
---
This must be horde, because I can buy DI ores for 2.5 a stack alliance side, but why would I when fiery cores are less than 10.
---
&gt;I sure as hell was not going to do it just to avoid some lag for 30 minutes a couple of times per week. Definitely not to move to to a server that, at the time, had absolutely nothing going for it, no community to speak of, and no certainty that it would ever become worth playing on. Noone's gonna leave a thriving, bustling server in favor of one that could possibly be dead as fuck three months later.
---
People said the same about heartseeker and it's doing fine (imbalanced but definitely populated).

I have a nice pve guild and they like me. I just don’t like pvp. No one in my BGs ever said something bad to me they don’t notice
---
Super bizarre bro, what’s your end game here? Bully me into admitting that’s its my fault I rolled on Stalagg? That I rolled Alliance?
---
What are the odds if I read through your post history I find an example of you arguing the opposite to someone actually complaining?
---
no im rubbing it in the faces of all the smug fuckers who thought they couldnt be wrong k thx
---
I'll look into Proton, never heard of it
---
No, they're not doing a good job.
---
We take the extra drops from molten core/etc, sell them, store them in the bank. Then we take those funds strategically to "Help ourselves, by helping the guild". Upgrade our raid groups, hand out potions, give away basic mounts, help craft Sulf hammer, or etc. A guilds job is to help your collection of people. Generally If it makes the guild stronger we will spend the gold on that.
---
For example, we bought one of our priests an eye of shadow recently, it ended up helping the guild as a whole because our priests are now stronger.
---
Good bots can do captchas
---
I'm pretty sure that agreeing to ToS allows them to check what other processes are running on your computer.

You can solo farm demonic runes in felwood (I prefer the south spot) at a rate of 5-6 per hour too

No proof you were ever banned. No proof you were ever unbanned. Photoshopped, could be from someone else. No one cares, no one ever cared. Grow up.
---
Did I miss anything?
---
Explain to me when I’m whining?
---
I just think it’s comical you are so proud of how you botted. I bet at parties you tell people “achhkually I only had 3 of my 50+ accounts banned.” No one cares. No one is jealous of the botters.  Literally no one.
---
You got exalted with AV without even playing a game. Cool man, hang up that screenshot on your wall, mama would be proud of you.

Like what are you trying to prove? Everything you are saying is just sad. People play this game for entertainment. It sounds like you make it your life. It’s pathetic. It’s sad.
---
It's still 1 button and 1 action. If you were to setup one of this dodo bird things from the Simpsons that repeatedly taps a key, could they ban for that? GSE forums has a screenshot of a blue post saying AHK is not bannable or against TOS.
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99995% sure that Arkeld is not a bot.

Your ban should not have been overturned hopefully you get caught again.
---
Bots don't have chat conversations, if you can provide enough dates and timewindows where you were active in chat that overlap with the reports that caused the ban, the ban gets overturned.
---
The problem is that banwaves generally don't get a thorough review at all times and you get banned. If you sell and deal in TCG items or boosting services for INGAME GOLD, the system can flag you reallife money trading. Why? Because of the following.
---
Person Y advertises a spectral tiger for sale, person X wants this item so he buys gold of person Z's account. Person Z gets banned for botting or real life money trading, person X gets caught in the transaction history and they are banned, person Y got the gold from person X and is also banned. This shit happens ALL THE TIME and sometimes takes weeks to get overturned. This is why I screenshot every single gold related trade I do so the evidence is too big to ignore.
---
Props to you dude. Fuck those guys.
---
Didnt Even noticed it
---
I get that, but I think it's an important distinguishment because putting reports in to blizz about players is gonna slow them down. 
---
Thats kinda why I did this. Filling the report queue with inaccurate reports just slows them down so by teaching people how to better identify botters helps with the reports which helps get them resolved faster.
---
Yeah So you’re essentially a bot without a mouse macro
---
It's Reddit, there's garbage people eagerly waiting to wag their fingers everywhere. Just a bunch of sad dorks.
---
I think there are more people who agree with me than dont
---
Agreed, only to help queue times though.
---
Pretty much at this point as well, but I just don't really need anything in the 5 mans so I don't go.
---
Starting area owls don't have screech, fwiw. First tame with screech is in Westfall.
---
I think a lot of people are using "botting" and "remote desktop mouse jiggling" (or whatever you wanna call it) synonomously because the end result is the same for everyone unlucky enough to get matched with people doing either one.
---
Restocker. Great Addon. Only requires you to talk to the reagents guy.
---
Gandling represent!
---
Justified. I didn't hear anyone being banned for anything on my EU realm yet. Top honor farmers are at around 1m weekly honor and i don't think they're botting. I also met one of them in AV.
---
Wouldn't it a huge shame for them if white supremacists like them end up on the *black*list?
---
What did the guy who only got 3 days do?
---
So in general you shouldn't be trading dmg with mobs as mage, use frostbolt at long range, frost nova when they get close and give yourself breathing room.
---
And remember, if a fight is getting dicey, you can choose to sheep the mob and get out instead of fighting to the death.
---
Classes which I would describe as strong levelers who have easy to pick up security would also be classes with pets, like warlock and Hunter.
---
Also, look up a spec for your class which you think is good for utility and survivability as well as damage. If you copy an internet build related to maximizing dps, you will end up missing a ton of crucial leveling talents..
---
Any questions let me know!
---
Okay that makes sense. Thanks for explaining
---
Big whoosh over your head.  80:20 might as well be a PVE server, but keep convincing yourself otherwise.
---
Our spot is getting blown up, both factions are worried!
---
Bro, stop thinking of yourself as some lawful neutral messiah bringing forth some dire message.
---
As a ex prolific botter (started with Glider in Vanilla) who has seen a lot of banwaves: I *fully* trust Blizzard when it comes to bans.
---
They go to incredible lengths to only ban people they are *certain* have botted. I have yet to see a single case in the history of WoW where they banned someone who didn't deserve to get banned. Every single banwave has the same sob stories, but the truth is they all botted, no matter if they will admit it or not. Blizzard is incredibly careful when it comes to banning accounts, to the extent that in one of the biggest banwaves they delivered 6 month bans instead of permanently banning people who were caught. That was the banwave that made me quit botting, by the way.
---
&gt;So many automated bullshit systems where some AI determines if you get banned or not based on reports from angry people.
---
There is no automated ban system that works based on player reports.
---
Work tomorrow morning dark and early bois wooo
---
Not like i go out anyways
---
Things that didn't happened for 100
---
If you use the priest MC trick then you don’t have to wait the 6 hours and you won’t need the whole server to be there.
---
Most all of reddit is pretty trash which is why I try and only browse relevant subs to whatever I'm doing, but jeez, this sub is even worse than r/wowservers used to be, and that place was AWFUL.
---
huh?  Voluntarily?  Stalagg was the server that they told us to move to when Herod and Faerlina filled up.  Sorry that in all of the confusion of launch day that I didn't realize that i should have moved to a server like Sulfuras.  And then after spending about 10 hours I didn't feel like re-rolling.  Why is that insane?  seems quite reasonable to me.
---
Keep talking
---
Boar is better for tanking and for closing (charge op), but I've gone 10-40 with an owl no problem. Haven't even taught it screech yet because I'm lazy but that makes it even better - big threat. Once you can teach it dive the gap between boar and bird is pretty narrowed.
---
That's great. I agree with the sentiment. I just don't feel the need to post it because in the end it accomplishes nothing.
---
I'm not big on whining.
---
There should be an update to the TOS about afking battlegrounds though.
---
Gimme
---
Bayes theorem says your opinion is objectively wrong. The odds of a person posting being incorrectly banned is orders of magnitude higher than you (or most people here) think.
---
Yeah please we need another of these.
---
Do you think that people who AFK in BGs should remain unbanned and #nochanges?
---
I'm calm. The sarcasim just wasn't comming in strong enough for me to detect and I was already in arguing mode because some idiot titan cow was spreading falsehoods with a little too much confidence. 
---
It's crazy how people can convince themselves of shit that isn't true to justify purchases.
---
How am i supposed to keep my soul shard count up in battlegrounds if killing enemies does not reward me with soulshards?
---
We help as much as we can with people's crafted BiS items as well as help tanks with their FR items. We hope to be able to help or fully fund all our melee's crusader enchants in the near future
---
Did I say I don't agree with you? Strawman galore because of insecurities. 
---
Look at your post history, nobody cares about the obvious.
---
It's a PvP server. Enjoy struggling to raid.
---
Fair enough. I only tank them for friends or guildies now.
---
 Is it because you lied when you were seventeen?
---
&gt;better PVPers still come out on top
---
All Alliance has to do to win is join a premade where everyone has an epic mount/isnt afking.
---
You clearly know a thing or two about how bots function. Isn't it possible to no longer read the memory but instead have a bot look at the screen with an overlay? Similar to a triggerbot in a FPS. If designed well enough you could bypass the need for memory reading no?
---
I never claimed you don’t agree with me. I just asked a question
---
[in John Mulaney voice] “Prove, prove... prove you’re not a robot, present the shoe and prove.”
---
Clever usage of the triggers as modifiers and OPie could actually be a totally legit controller setup. Likely slow because of keyboard turning but good enough for raiding I'd bet.
---
Stalagg has a vibrant alliance faction with very balanced population. It should definitely be at the top of anyone's list when searching for a nice alli refuge
---
If you can't fill in the blanks yourself then you're not the target demographic OP is looking for
---
You were flesh botting.
---
Get one tank to be in like 5th position or so, at 70% all your melee blow their load and at 65% all your ranged do the same. Aim to have her sub 40% before she moves to her first position. She will generally get 1-3 fireballs off even if you hit 40% before the cast as the phase transition lags a bit but at that point she’ll land, maybe attack a few people but your off tank should be able to pick her up quite easily.
---
Either that or you run the same strategy while not worrying about your off tank threat and just heal whoever has aggro in p3....I got a sick parse on my warrior last week sitting in zerker spamming execute while tanking :D if your healers are ready for it you can heal basically anyone through her damage unless it’s a clothy and she crits or breaths+autos at the same time.
---
Yeah, just found out yesterday that I tanked through mc and ony with shield slam rank 1...
---
Probably got caught once and wasn't a repeated offender like others
---
I haven't logged in for 6 months, and still got banned for botting in classic wow.  WTF?!
---
Same
---
I've been seeing the "no names" a lot lately, second ally from the top. Did a patch break something?
---
I think it was an example of prisoners dilemma.  Sure, if everyone logged off, queues would have been short.  But since everyone else didn't log off, I couldn't either.  So I did what all the other people who wanted to play did,  logged on remotely while at work and used a jump macro to stay logged in until I got home.
---
AHK isn't Blizz legal. From HB ban we are pretty sure that Blizz sees a lot more about what's running than people thought. The bots were very sophisticated, people were running scripts that were impossible to catch, and yet EVERYONE got hit, no matter how safe of a botter, no matter how small.
---
&gt;No one is jealous of the botters. Literally no one.
---
You sure about that? You seem pretty concerned ;)
---
&gt;mama would be proud of you
---
;)
---
&gt;. It sounds like you make it your life. It’s pathetic. It’s sad.
---
Nope, a side business. It's sad I could run a script and make money? Do tell...
---
Thanks.  I'll look into it
---
Man, what a wasted opportunity for the druid to use /flop.
---
Exactly, that's why I wanted to write this up. There's a massive difference between the bans between the gathering bots or mob farming bots people see and the anti-afk programs. If you get a three day ban there's no way you were using an application that was automating gameplay, Blizzard just detected emulated inputs such as mouse clicks and movements. If you got a three month, six month, or lifetime ban you were more than likely using a bot with these techniques which is much more toxic to the game's economy and the achievements of other players.
---
Good for you my guy, I understand completely that you felt the need to post this and I'm just happy you got your account back.
---
The lengths people will to to justify their botting lol
---
I mean you can afk outside of the bg.  No one is forcing you to queue into the bg then afk for the FULL DURATION of it.
---
It also fucks with pvp brackets since a lot of these afkers are using software to enter bgs and afk for them while they sleep/work and thus are earning more honor than they should.
---
Most likely a failed premade queue. Don’t be fooled as the last time I was in this situation the alliance still won while horde had a juicy head start..
---
Haha Anathema represent! I'm in the same guild as geenpickle, I'm going to show him this post when I get home from work. Y'all should have a huntard showdown.
---
Haha I'll make sure he does
---
There are literally dozens of us! (in all seriousness it's 30/70, horde is alive but needs new blood more than alliance)
---
Does he get a 60s timer once booted and would basically be hearthed out?
---
Generally, if someone is looking for a tank for a dungeon I need, it's because they want the same gear I do, and the drop rate sucks. I don't need competition on rolls, and I can find some other DPS really easily.
---
In general; tanking pugs just sucks. Without queuing for dungeon finder, people just have way less experience running dungeons, so they will act like noobs once you get inside. Since they run less dungeons, they have less gear, so they will struggle more. Also, like I said in the first paragraph, the gear is not spread out well so the dungeons where you need gear are not the dungeons I want to run more then a couple times, or we both need the same gear so I'm not going to have you tag along so you can roll on the stuff I need but has never dropped in the 20 times I ran the place.
---
The state of running dungeons in WoW dramatically improved in WoTLK. I love classic and dislike retail, but if there was a time and place where we could go back to, for me it would be WoTLK. I love having 1 talent point per level, all of the old complexity, but also having dungeon finder.
---
Yeah that's why everyone got banned lmao. In WoD most people got really safe with it but the influx of new dumbasses who didn't care made shit like this happen
---
Ahh so the people botting aren’t lazy? Gotcha lol 
---
Imo he’s just a bot with a few extra steps
---
&gt; Speak for yourself. I just saw our guild's top ranker suspended. 
---
Maybe he shouldn't have botted?  lol
---
Unbanned btw lolllllll
---
It's not limited to MC.  It dropped off Onyxia in a group I was in.  It has a very small chance to drop off of high level elites, and slightly higher for bosses.
---
That's just the easiest way to 5-8 kite warrior, has been for years. Especially true with the way leeway works in classic.
---
To me, tanking in classic is akin to babysitting.  And it gets old very fast.  I have a large guild so even guild runs are on par with pugs.  I ran a guild UBRS, solo tanking and had one mage running up and cocing and blizzarding packs of 5 as soon as they reached me....
---
Vanilla was completely different.  Mages cced without being asked, dps coordinated which mob to attack for single target dps and everything was fun.  Now it is constantly a sh*t show.
---
I've had a few pugs that were great.  I get added to friends lists and I'm always willing to help them out.  I really just think the AoE farming in SM makes dps stupid, and they can't recover from that stupidity.
---
I have no idea what game you are playing but tanking mc bosses without a shield will keep you rage capped and you can't glance with heroic so eskanders is the fastest weapon in the game to spam it with.
---
Are you really expecting people to take responsibility for their actions? How dare you.
---
I guess a lot of people are part of the 1% right now then seeing as many of em are being overturned as we speak. Who looks like an idiot now hm?
---
Yeah people in this subreddit don’t understand basic math. Bayes theorem says the odds of a person being innocently banned and posting here is very high. Like at least an order of magnitude higher than people are assuming.
---
So, if I play this game called "world of WARcraft" - I should come to your home, rape your wife and then slaughter your whole family and it would be OK because it's a war and that's what people do to each other when they are at war?  
---
I really doubt it.  
---
Also, horde whined so much about being camped at zeppelins back in the day that Blizzard added **lvl 55 elite guards with ranged knockback** to zeppelin towers, while Alliance boats are "guarded" by **lvl 20 non-elites**.  
---
We just want the true Vanilla experience of a smaller faction getting much stronger guards, that's all.
---
No the people botting are lazy and cheaters, this guy is JUST lazy. Don't strawman me.
---
I main a feral druid and tank 90% of the groups I'm in.  I like it but I get why people don't do it.  The biggest turn off for me is being expected to know every dungeon, every boss fight, every pull.  There have been several times I've seen a group advertising for a tank for a long time and finally I'll whisper saying I will tank but don't know the dungeon someone else needs to mark, explain fights, etc.  It usually works out well, so if you're having trouble finding a tank and know the dungeon offer to lead it when advertising and you might get more bites.
---
Also I think the lack of tanks has to do with raids.  Sure you need a lot of tanks to do random 5 mans on the server, but how many do you need for raids?  When you only need a couple tanks for raids the number of "full" time tanks drops as many turn to dps or heals depending on their class.
---
Sorry for being so late to my own thread. This is exactly what I would be using it for. Ill definitely check our neatplates thanks alot!
---
/doubt
---
Thrash blade shouldnt even be in MC. its good for lower fury but theres so many better options.
---
I'm not 100% sure on how it worked but the bot would be able to see anything that's targetable and stuff, it somehow was able to get that information from the game. So yes you could tell it the exact specific mob and even other modifiers like level to it and it would follow it to a T
---
I love tanking dungeons. I rolled a Protection warrior specifically so I could excel at tanking dungeons because that's pretty much all I do with my playtime when I'm not raiding. On top of that, I love tanking in pubs with people I've never met before. It's a fresh experience every time, you get to meet a whole bunch of people on your server, and it's nice seeing others level up or pick up upgrades that would just get otherwise vendored or sharded. I'm MT for my guild and so I don't have any loot left to acquire in dungeons aside from the chase items like HOJ, Ironfoe, Felstriker, Chromatic Carapace, Baron mount, etc.
---
However, I'm also an enchanter with every formula in the game. I can easily make 30-40g an hour just idling in town at certain times of the day. The prospect of running Live Strat for an hour for an orb that isn't guaranteed to drop is laughable, especially because they are about 20g each on my server. Running Live Strat for 1 orb reserved just isn't worth it for me. Running any dungeon for "all greens reserved" may sound like a lot of gold, but in reality, it's like 6 or 7 greens that DE into 1-3x Illusion Dust each, and I'm still losing out on income. In order for a dungeon run to be worth it to me, I usually have to reserve greens and blues or just ask for an Arcane Crystal as upfront payment. Helps put a dent into the 100 Arcanite Bars I'll need later on...
---
With that question you implied that I think they shouldn't be punished.
---
Really? I’ve never had a problem with keyboard but I’ve always been a console kid. I’ll have to check this out thanks!
---
"I don't want to be on a low pop server" says one of 4,000 players that could transfer off together and make another server high pop.
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
Im currantly level 43 and I hit 190g by level 40 only doing leatherworking and mining ad professions. Mining takes off really after you starting to mine iron and I AH the bars and stones. I vendor all the leather up to heavy leather. Also got a lot of silver from gray items didn't do all that much questing.
---
The question is though, assuming you can hide it from the warden, they would be harder to detect than a memory injecting bot no? Even if it's super basic, if it can be programmed to grind dungeons so you don't get manual reports it can do some serious work.
---
All of that is okay if everyone agrees to it before the run.
---
But the standard practice of "MS before OS" is rooted in solid logic.  If Player A will use that gear 100% of the time, and Player B will only use that loot 40% of the time, then Player A should have priority.
---
If dungeon loot was handled solely on "people rolling on stuff they want", then people could just roll need on everything and shard/vendor other people's MS items.
---
Loot rules exist so that everybody can get their primary loot faster -- it helps everybody.
---
I dont know as I dont really care.
---
Lmao or even use one as a lock raiding. Set x to shadow bolt and you’re still doing the same thing :p
---
I also have z pearl but I had no idea u could set the timers up in that addon. I'll have to look threw it more it has so many things you can customize its a tad overwhelming lol
---
Well should or shouldn’t they?
---
tbh my goal was to really help people better identify bots and make reports to blizzard efficiently. I think they probably get bogged down with reports about people who just suck at the game or who just ignore them lol
---
Imagine making such a pointless comment, for the sake of displaying your own lack of reading comprehension.
---
BC days would've been Glider and that was easy as hell to detect
---
How do you keep threat on pulls of +4 without the shouts? I feel the sunders are too spread out here and always end up losing one.
---
Naxx most dps classes are balanced. Generally its warr/mage &gt; lock/rogue, but good locks and rogues can compete for top 3 dps in your raid
---
One unverified screenshot with no proof. Behold
---
This means absolutely nothing
---
I haven't played retail wow in years, and quit classic wow over 6 months ago, and I still somehow got banned for botting!?   WTF?
---
Hopefully not as they are not botting
---
I agree, but my thoughts on that are that even tho a lot of botters themselves dont care, the bot developers do. So there's still a lot to be learned from banning people in direct response to reports.
---
EDIT: This is esp true when it comes to software detection. Lets say blizzard knows I'm running this program... if they show all their cards up front the developer is going to code his way around the new changes a lot faster.
---
It was TBC. It also made healing as paladin more engaging. Need mana? Stand in the fire with a rejuv ticking.
---
Or autorunning into elites.
---
lol you'll be okay bud
---
I'm not sure this is true.  There are many attempts where I get targeted and fireballed multiple times in phase 2, and there is no way in hell I'm anywhere near 110% of anyone's threat. Hunter btw, who feigns on CD and drinks for half the fight if ony isn't being a dick.
---
Welcome to Arugal. Glad to see the rest of the realms catching up to us.  
---
Queues have been blown out to nearly an hour as Alliance keep the few players they have in bracket control.
---
Sooooo what I'm hearing is free loot and free RP...
---
Respec into Fury/Arms.  
---
You don't need to be Deep Prot to tank 5-mans.  For raids, having more than 2 tanks speced into protection is giving up a lot of dps and will make things like killing Rag before Sons pop at 3 minutes harder.  
---
Fury/Prot will certainly give you better DPS when not tanking, but unless you're grabbing the first kill target or tanking bosses, you really don't need the points in the Prot tree since you'll have plenty of threat in pre-raid bis when given a threat lead with Taunt and Mocking blow as back-up.  Also Fury/Prot is really awkward because you lose your rage when stance dancing, effectively nerfing a third of your kit.  
---
Also learning how to do competitive dps will help you earn a primary or secondary tank role sooner since a huge part of that job is setting the threat ceiling on key targets.
---
Absolutely not 100% because I’ve seen her chain cast it on the same target
---
Because I am underleveled for the dungeon on my druid. So I go in with the idea of healing it.  
---
I have been tanking many dungeons on my shaman.  Unfortunately now I am at the Maradon level and BRD level.  I doubt that people want a shaman tank in brd with packs that have so many monsters I cannot tab rockbiter each one.
---
Dad showing son how to smash the alliance.
---
Thank God someone with a brain in here.
---
I very well understand. but on those servers alliance / horde willingly and well knowling  made their bed and they should sleep in it. This is not a blizzard problem, its a player made problem on those servers and no, i dont think that Blizzard should intervene at all.
---
I used to get GM's checking up on me in vanilla because I was leveling and grinding with 1 button macros (in-game macro engine was a bit liberal in the start) so could be someone doing the same? 
---
I'd say report them and if legit GM's used to be quite cool with it.
---
Thunderclap is capped to 4 mobs. And I like to use it at the start of the fight (but I don't refresh it) it usually lasts long enough to down the first mob and the 10% attack speed slow is nice for mitigation. I dont ever feel rage starved as a fury/prot but I agree with everything else!
---
I usually do charge+blood rage+thunderclap+fed+demo then start stacking sunders
---
I'll agree but counter your points too. Have your active account do herbalism, first aid and skinning. Then have an alt with enchanting and leatherworking to disenchant and vendor. I make solid gold making and vendoring nightscape headbands. Have two characters and you can cover most things (Maybe do fishing for the floating wreckage too)
---
Created a strat live 1 orb res group. First reply I got was a mage calling me greedy and saying I should give the orb res to a healer if I want to find a group. And "why are all tanks greedy?"
---
Bitch please. You port everywhere. Get gold for being a vendor.
---
I dont need any gear in live. I'm starting the group. AND I'm ONLY asking for 1 orb. I see plenty asking for them all.
---
Starting groups as a tank is getting harder.
---
People just want me to donate mytime. Even got downvoted on this sub when I suggested its dumb of me to waste my time gearing pugs.
---
Sweaty flex
---
&gt;tanking mc bosses without a shield will keep you rage capped
---
Try pressing some buttons, not just spam heroic and hope it somehow works out with your 400 tps?
---
&gt; eskanders is the fastest weapon in the game to spam it with 
---
Alcor's sunrazor is faster.
---
&gt;  you can't glance with heroic 
---
You still can miss with it though. And because of 300 weapon skill you have to now itemize for 9% hit.
---
Addon for HB. But even stuff like that doesn't matter cause you still have an over all pattern.
---
If we draw a square with four points and connect them with lines we have a pattern. Adding random dots that go off the line won't deter you from seeing the pattern as a whole
---
The only real difference is in world PvP.   You won't see huge difference in 50 50 split and 60 40.   
---
The differences come down to who might control contested areas like blackrock mountain or dire maul.  This was more a thing during phase 2 pre BGs than it is now.
---
Ya'll getting trolled by this guy
---
Imagine being this full of yourself
---
I'd be pretty pissed too if someone lobbed an explosive at me.
---
&gt;one day you will have you precious character blocked for what you haven't done and there will be nobody to help you. You will be alone with your problem, your appeals will be rejected, but this time - christmas miracle might not happen.
---
And then I'll remember it's just a game
---
You sound like a botter .
---
Ur ranged dps should have full mana for phase 2 btw, thats why people say wands only. Those who know their mana pool can last through the fight specially with runes or pots are free to bolt/dot or whatever else as long as they save a good majority for phase 2. The thing with phase 2 is the longer shes in it can also be a good thing because that means more people at the top of the aggro table get fireballed, and if you had a tank that literally did close to nothing in phase 1 and never got fireballed he can grab ony right away most times with a taunt or shield slam or whatever they use. If its a fast phase 2 theres really not much you can do if you didnt get fireballed but are high on threat other than going north and saying "ony is on me (name) spam heals and shields". Name of the game is everyone is responsible for positioning her in phase 3.
---
Ya it is a lot, and to be honest I never looked at most of it, just saw the debuff timer box and checked it a guess haha
---
not botted and not banned my man, but I did get a 24hour silence a few days back for literally no reason because the system is garbage though.
---
They’re all gonna feel kinda dumb when they all have to respec fire for AQ and Naxx. I guess their names will all be ironic then.
---
You can stand on top of each other since that aoe knockback only hits players with mana pools.
---
Imagine taking AV seriously...
---
Will probably feel the wrath of a team mate once I check this out then and find out Phalanx cannot be engaged 😂
---
I don’t see a difference. Neither is actually playing or helping the team
---
Lol holy shit you believed bigwillie
---
Calls people toxic proceeds to be toxic
---
Atiesh is a really great pve server for NA-west, I’ve also noticed that it has people from all over so if you’re East, don’t worry about it! Alliance has us out number 2:1 but the difference is hardly noticeable.
---
Do items that start quests (e.g. Head if Kelris) still drop for you if you do not meet the level requirements for the quest that it starts? I'm hoping they will drop and you can accept the quest once you meet the level.
---
Me - a fury warrior- joined a group who was desperately looking for a BRD tank. The group already had a warrior. I was like okay, who cares, I am not a greedy asshole like some other tanks. I ran there and right in front of the entrance the other warrior stated, that I should only roll on tank gear. I said, I roll on what I need for my main spec which is fury and if he had a problem with that, he should tank then he could decide on loot priorities. He didn't want to tank and was pissed of course telling me, I was greedy, selfish and I should be removed. I told the leader it is either me the rare tank or him the abundant DD warrior, who can't or won't tank making everyone wait hours to get a group together. The warrior got kicked, we found another DD shortly after and we had a pleasent run. Morale of the story. If you play offspec to make a dungeon group work, where others refuse, because they feel entitled to play like they want, you can make the demands not them
---
early 2020 could be tomorrow!
---
You just need to be vocal and make sure everyone agrees if you're planning on taking people main-spec items to use as your hybrid/off-spec gear.
---
When you're not a hybrid class, and you only do one thing, and you only need one set of gear -- it's absolutely asinine when people take your gear and then say "I'll probably get around to wearing this at some point, maybe".
---
Nope, worst server out there.
---
looks like it  wasnt an overreaction lol
---
Yeah, unless you have something that also has a bunch of different patterns that are updated regularly and chosen at random, each with randomness built in. I really have no idea how retail works any more so I don't know if botting is still a thing, but based on how prevalent botting is in classic I'm guessing it still exists somewhat
---
Maybe your standard procedure is to pass on upgrades to your raid spec because you're OS healing or tanking to make the dungeon go, but don't assume it's everyone's. It's not. 
---
That fury warrior tanking your dungeon wants his primary loot faster too, and it's the leather DPS gear because that's fury BIS for raiding. If you don't like it, leave and wait another hour for a more beta tank.
---
While there is definitely less Alliance queuing for AV in our battlegroup that's not exactly the real problem here. What happens is because Alliance is an insta queue, it allows for cross realm premades to basically time their queue and all get into the same AV, if they don't get enough people they simply leave the queue and then this happens. 
---
The Alliance side will fill back up usually within about 30 seconds to a minute after the game starts, but at that point its usually too late to organize anything and it turns into a shit show.
---
&gt;I'm glad you got caught. I do not believe you, but lets as you said operate on the assumption you are right.
---
&gt;BG's are there to be played, you were an asshole. you let your team down and essentially AFK'd your way through the content making it harder for people who were trying on your team.. i hope the ban sticks even if it is for the wrong reasons.
---
This comment didn't age well
---
Hey guys, I’m looking into getting muggers belt as a Prot warrior while I save up for edgemasters. What dagger would you recommend using? I don’t have any Raid weapons yet (hopefully the next few weeks), and Felstriker seems like a crazy farm. I was looking at Bonescraper, Heartseeker, Scarlet Kris, Glacial Blade, and also Lobotomizer and Darrowspike. Latter two don’t have stats, and Heart/Scarlet are BoE so might be pricy. Appreciate any insight
---
Some people take it more seriously than others. Maybe its just a game to you. Maybe its not to op.
---
I'll tank once tanking will be fun again, so I'll wait till death knights in classic wotlk.
---
What the hell class do you play? Druid? There's some solid tank gear out for druids right now, lol.
---
A lot if not most current bots for wow run this way.
---
Very normal
---
Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever cheated in/on anything? "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone".
---
I'm sure you have never done anything wrong though ever. If you can't understand basic hypocrisy, you are probably too stupid to break the law.
---
sorry not sorry had to downvote to hide this,
---
We have made something like 8 annihilators, titans flask the MT every week, made some dark iron gear for the MTs. Started stockpiling mats for a couple night falls once bwl drops
---
Then this post could “show” them why they could give a shit?
---
Just got overturned, something goofy happened.
---
Fucking assholes downvoting.
---
Of course I wouldn't roll on something I might use at some point but maybe not. However, if I was playing a HotW-druid that tanks 2/3 dungeons runs and heals 1/3 and is in cat form when questing or grinding I'd have a valid reason to roll on gear for all specs.
---
Classic overreaction (pun intended), by the sound of it. Maybe he had a bad day.
---
Naxx is gonna be cleared the first day it's released within 3~ hours. It's not hard...
---
In oceanic servers we wait for 40 min regularly
---
Yeah bro, I wish I was a rank 14 in the original Death and Taxes...

Oh wait... I was: [https://i.imgur.com/AQ22J8z.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AQ22J8z.jpg)

Go mining, arcane crystals are the truth
---
We’re talking about not being a idiot in a video game. This has nothing to do with real life lmfao
---
What about the botters that are still out there right now? The ones i recorded and put the YouTube link in my report?
---
I'm leveling a warrior tank and I'm loving it so far. It definitely helps to have gold to keep gear up to date if there's a gap in dungeon loot but I love the challenge. The skill ceiling is prettt high if you want to be a good tank and min maxing with stat potions, immolation oil, rage potions, engi dynamite and nades, shield spikes and everything else you can think of is great fun. I don't get to pug much because my guild has a lot of alts around level 40 but I'm looking forward to the max level tanking experience and even pugs as well.
---
Botting &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AV leeching in terms of violating the rules / ToS. At this point, your line of reasoning is akin to something along to lines of "how can we trust this man on trial for murder, he's admited to stealing a donut when he was a teenager"...
---
Ony will pretty much always attack one or two before a tank can get aggro yeah?
---
Had a guild leader throw shade at me for pulling aggro in p3 when I wasn't even attacking
---
Not enough rage? Huh? 5/5 furor in resto tree + wolfshead helm and you have 20 rage on demand...
---
LOL so yes, you're 12.
---
"and horde outnumber alliance for Classic overall"
---
I see this assumption parroted alot on here and according to all the available data we have this is simply not true. 
---
The queue times for horde were 3 minutes for av when bg's launched. And since the alliance won the majority of the av matches the first couple of days and achieved exalted at more then twice the speed, horde queue times sky rocketed to 20 minutes or so. This just supports the assumption most people make that horde enjoy pvp more then the average alliance player.
---
I've been using AHK since Wrath and have never been banned for it.
---
Priests would say differently
---
by dip shits who play 23 hours a day.  Not for 90% of guilds out there
---
Not in a dungeon
---
True, but the dps shift from prot in prot gear in zerker stance to prot in dps gear in zerker stance is pretty negligible imo.
---
Kraun cant use autoclicker while sleeping during rank grind anymore, how will this man keep up
---
I dunno man, I play a caster I can watch Netflix and top dps on the pve that is av
---
Yeah theres ways around edgemasters too. Granted its bis for all no human or orc furys but you can make it work without it too.
---
I've had a 25% winrate in these because we say fuck it and turtle bal until the whole team shows up then we slowly push south capping. Works way better than the rush, spread out, die, strat that so many pugs keep trying.

blown out
---
| As you can see, tanking is not an enjoyable experience. Please, please, PLEASE do your best to help the tanks in your future runs, guys. 
---
This isn't correct.  Tanking \*can\* be stressful when it's a new instance and people expect you to take charge.  Tanking with a PUG is always a toss-up; you have no idea when something goes wrong and suddenly the healer says "my cats on fire" and leaves.
---
Tanking with someone who wants to pull for you, who rips aggro away by shielding after the pull, who then instead of running forward, runs backwards, etc, etc...  not terribly fun.
---
BUT:  after a learning experience (or 8, I still get lost in BRD) run where someone else points out "kill them first", "You can split that group", and gives you a general instance layout...  I quite enjoy it.
---
And as my gear level increases, my expectations or requirements of groups goes down.  Eventually, my only request is that the groups are patient.  Because I would rather spend an extra 10 seconds pulling a group, for every group than do a corpse run and rebuff.
---
I'd rather take the time to explain the fight for people who may not know it, than to assume that they do.  Because I myself didn't know it until someone showed it to me.
---
Tanking like that, with a good group who understands their role, their threat, and isn't impatient?  I love those groups.
---
Because not everyone was banned for that you idiot
---
Parsing/speed/just more fun
---
Healing MC with 10k mana is pretty dope
---
Most things work if you use it correctly this breaks if you use it correctly as well, and brakes for no reason with no way of you finding out why it broke so you can figure out how you need to fix it. The best support is to just keep trying until it fixes itself.
---
Also any news when they're going to get this thing off of MediaFire I didn't know it was 2006 still.
---
UBRS is extremely difficult to solo tank after The Beast, I would always bring an OT to that place.
---
I do tank alot of dungeons, and even tho it sucks before you’re geared it becomes alot easier if you invite healers who lets you dualwield in fury spec. You just gains so much aggro, but good gear is needee for this! I’ve secured basicly all pre raid dps bis items by making my groups reserving 1 dps item while tanking the dungeons. Alot of prople find this scummy, but they can join others groups if they dont wanna join mine.
---
I currently MT for my guild and every once in a while someone will PM me to tank say scholo or Strat - live and get insulted when I say I will if either A: I get first Orb or B the group pays me 20-30g (5-7.5g a person) or C I get all uneeded blue's  
---
They get extremely upset for me even giving them options. Here's what they don't get.  
---
I literally need nothing but gold. Running a pug dungeon on average costs ME 5g in repairs ALONE and that's if i only die once....  
---
On top of that the stress of asking puggers to just chill for 2 seconds. I'm not asking for an eternity here. Just 2 seconds.  
---
So yeh for all of the folks who don't get it. Warriors can't do ANYTHING for money outside of attempting to mine for Arcane crystals which is extremely contested, or sell there tank service.  
---
I'm sorry we don't have the privelage of soloing Tribute runs or DME Jump runs or hell even soloing princess runs....  
---
So yeh i'm not going to join a pug without payment period. It's literally my only source of gold income.
---
I wasnt botting, just using scripts to not go afk 24/7 so i dont have to wait for login queue, because fuck other people
---
It's not like that in every game. Most games just won't do anything with automated reports
---
NO CHANGES
---
I always let healer know if I'm tanking on my druid that I will be rolling for healing gear before the dungeon starts. Most of the time they are cool with it.
---
I run full fury and the remaining points in prot and I maxed out my dual wielding in my fury tree.  This way, I can dual wield tank for aggro and throw on a shield for the heavy hitters.  I can also keep up with DPS if I'm not tanking.  It's not going to get you to the top of the charts, but I'm always top 15 DPS if not top 10.  Fury tanking (with the remaining points in Prot) is extremely easy and I've never had a problem, even before getting my T1 and T2 gear.
---
Good question!
---
Losing a mob once in a while is okay and expected - that's what we have Taunt and Mocking Blow for. So, in the beginning of packs like that, due to how taunt works, I'll actually prioritize all mobs other than skull to stack SA on them. Then as I eventually lose aggro of skull, I taunt it back and start spamming SA.
---
(Everyone may not know this, so I'll just mention it. What Taunt actually does is force a mob to attack you and *copy* the highest threat. So, waiting for the initial burst of, say, a hunter's Aimed Shot can leave you with a sizable threat advantage over other DPS later when you Taunt it.)
---
Seeing as warriors in classic have no good AoE threat tools like in retail, I try play according the the warriors strength of single target threat. It took me a while of tanking to realize it wasn't reasonable, nor most effective, to have aggro on lots of mobs 100% of the time. That's what led me to start using the aforementioned technique. I'll also completely let go of mobs that are around 20% HP, since I either know I have enough threat on it, and/or that the DPS can handle tanking it for a few seconds.
---
DPS players are usually pretty competent, in my experience. Mages has lots of control tools, Warlocks can Banish, Hunters can Concussive Shot, Warriors can Hamstring and Rogues can stun lock. I see that often enough to let my DPS handle a stray mob once in a while.
---
Just wondering... why are you using an alt reddit account to post about this?
---
Watch lezonta for example he is getting those numbers as horde with 4-5hours of sleep every night I think
---
I mean if it makes it more fun I guess that's a good enough reason.
---
Did you play Lineage 2 before WoW?
---
They do.
---
Stop playing Prot if you're not the 1rst or 2nd tank in your raid.  You're hurting the raid comp.  
---
You can tank 5-mans just fine as DPS spec in Blues/Purples.
---
That is probably true, dont have a sim to check. In the cases where you only use CoC to kite and wont have to nova, WC should win out, while using nova on cd will make shatter better. Purely for ZF gy farm this would mostly come down to preference I guess, as some feel nova ruins the flow of CoC kiting, but shatter will optimally come out on top.
---
Turing test
---
Protection potions - like Great Fire, armor one, etc.  
---
Stats food like Nightfin soup.  
---
Enchants\Librams
---
Nah, people aren’t pseudorandom like that. 
---
The bounds don’t matter. Heavy-tailed distributions don’t completely hide the fact that it’s a synthetic either. 
---
The fact is humans are just way too complex to model effectively with simple scripts. It’s why script kiddies typically get banned...
---
Now, blizzard probably doesn’t give a shit to implement sophisticated detection as it would require some money and research and it doesn’t really make them any additional money. In fact it’s the opposite, they lose subs from botters lmao
---
The meta in Classic isn’t to CC much though.
---
In actual vanilla there were standard marks per server. Moon for sheep. Blue block for trap. Etc.  Now? You have to call it out and ask. Even then you’ll have someone break it most of the time.
---
Lastly. It’s just not really needed. The only spec/class that struggles with aoe tanking seems to be prot warrior. Fury/prot, bears, and pallies are fine. So unless you’re rolling with an undergeared healer, or are deep prot, cc just slows you down.
---
LmFaO iT's JuSt A gAmE.
---
You're right man, this isn't real life. Nothing we do online has any effect on our "real life", and no amount of time spent on the computer will change that. It's quite nice having a virtual world where we can live and act with impunity.
---
You just posted a screenshot of what exactly? Could be some private server bullshit. Even if it's a legit screen of og dnt, doesnt mean you were part of it lmao. Stop acting like someone you're not.
---
According to the dislikes, this has always existed in Classic WoW. If anyone wanted to know.
---
Try rank 10
---
Tank flasks, crafted weapons like annihilator and nigthfall, future items like onyxia scale cloak, some guilds do discount/free consumes/enchants and stuff like that with excess money.
---
Holy shit it’s like you people don’t even read. 
---
You don’t understand what “random” means. People are not random the same way your pseudorandom number generator is.
---
*This is the way*
---
Nope. You need to write your own addon for this)
---
A group was looking for an lbrs tank, told them I only need the last boss gem, if its mine I'll tank it. 
---
"We need gems also"
---
They continued to look for a tank for at least another half an hour.
---
Toss in some Greater Blessing of Kings too
---
&gt; You think there should be a clause in the ToS stating you must play at max effort at all times or else you may be banned? Get the fuck out of here with that shit.
---
Time to ban all Ret Paladins
---
Very carefully lol. Basically, you just accept a bit of mana burn to CC. It's not like an insane amount (about 200-300 per tick I think?) so overall a few ticks of mana burn won't be the end of the world. For mages I imagine theres some strats on when to use mana gems/evo but I honestly have no clue on the specifics.
---
LoseControl: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/losecontrol

It’s a cost cutting measure, not a quality decision
---
While in Arms spec, I do the classic opener you mentioned! I was just explaining my rotation for Fury.
---
Because I know exactly how shitty this community is, and also because I had originally posted from my phone which my reddit app had this account logged in.
---
Sell your body. Advertise your rates for tanking instances with clauses for reimbursement should a death occur. They had to pay me at the start of an instance, and if/when a death occurred. People WILL pay.
---
If you appeal it (if you want) they'll overturn it.
---
THE OP DOES!!!! 
---
hahahaha hell yes
---
Spam that message moar my sweet summer child. :-*
---
Let the man gloat when morons with a mega justice hardon were out for blood and got blown the fuck out.
---
It’s actually not a red flag at all
---
Literally everyone on our server who ranks high goes “afk” for long stretches in AV 
---
They’re not botting, they’re just fucking tired of playing AV for 15 hours straight and it’s time for a break to eat, shit, watch something,  take a nap with a timer to hit space bar, etc 
---
It’s actually the logical next step after deciding NOT to bot or account share. Just because your dusty ass isn’t intelligent enough to think to idle in games while still at your keyboard rather than literally botting or account sharing doesn’t mean others are the same.
---
Just build an actual robot with with functioning AI to sit in your chair and play the game while you're away. That way if you get banned you can say blizzard is specieist and discriminating against robots. Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
You sound like someone who doesn't understand how ban waves work.
---
If they got unbanned, what's the harm done?
---
That is called "The Exception" not "The Rule".
---
There is a difference in competence levels when you are making 1 mistake vs making 100+ mistakes.  Blizzard is still in the right and 99.99% of people getting banned for botting, are doing so.
---
You cant use the .01% to make your case for  the other 99.9 % my dude.
---
&gt; The odds of a false positive permaban from blizzard is extremely low. 
---
The basis for this claim: absolutely nothing. It sounds right
---
As alliance 1 mil can be finished on Sunday
---
Nope, it was for you. Everything you said supports players who AFK in the game. 
---
Yet, you complained about AFKers prior. You are the only one complaining
---
Hold the fuck up, classic launched 4 months ago.
---
They were messed up before and will remain so until next Tuesday, but I think you'll find that next week it will be easier to rank with them gone.
---
Why are you so fucking cynical? They want to keep people happy. That brings them money. Use logic sometimes.
---
yea the backpedaling is to prevent leeway activation, vs. strafing which will let them melee from further away
---
Lmao what would be a good reason? You obviously always should play on the server your friends play on, but if you didn't know anyone what advice would you give?
---
I think playing on a very high populated server is the obvious choice, it just means there are way more options for guilds in the end game. Faerlina is relatively balanced and it is going to last the full life of the game, unlike some of the other servers we've seen on this sub already basically dead. Being with the streamers and the drama is also pretty great, it's fun to in the mix when the shit goes down. 
---
You don't like the server because famous people play there, now it's the most well known server. I get it, it's not cool to like things other people like. Just call a spade a spade.
---
Hey do you happen to play on Fairbanks? I’m also a hunter trying to farm SGC for my warrior alt so we could help each other out. 
---
Wishful thinking but thought I’d check!
---
Didnt effect anyone in our guild
---
Bootlicking. It's a bit over the top imo. Makes it feel like whatever the person saying it or writing it is not going to be informative or a correction of something, but just a "let's flame some people" deal. I'm sure the rest of what your saying is valid, just that term makes me walk away from otherwise constructive debate.
---
Gets under my skin it's used so much in various ways to hurt someone else. The reason being I am called a bootlicker on many occasions for supporting law enforcement. The good ones. Not the racist power hungry ones we need to find and remove. But just because I don't think they're all the devil's brood that needs eradicated from society, I'm a bootlicker. 
---
Well, this comment got long and boring quickly.
---
will do. Gonna sit here and check at least once every hour or two and spam it again just for entertainment purposes.
---
What does it matter that it's a game or not? You are investing real life hours into something, not chilling in the hyperbolic time chamber when are online.
---
People keep saying this isn't real life, doesn't matter, then they are going to wake up one day and realize they are 40 years old, no wife, no kids, working at a deadend job, and wonder what went wrong? Good thing all those hours spent video games "don't matter".
---
Video games are entertainment and it would be dumb to sit here playing WoW myself but also say they are a waste of time that will ruin your real life. But, saying they have no effect on your "real life" is beyond delusional, as everything you do is quite literally your real life, there is no distinction.
---
This is my pet peeve with warriors. If you need gear from the instance, you should be willing to equip a shield and tank it.
---
Lmao, a low resolution screenshot where all the members have exactly the same names as original DnT members... yeah must've been a private server, lol (the fact that you don't immediately recognize all of those names is proof you weren't there).  
---
Anyway, let me know when you start getting invited to do podcasts about your time in DnT:

How is that even a grey area? There's nothing wrong with using wine. I have a Linux laptop and I play through wine a few times a week
---
He didn't say it was? Just said that it's functionally the same and ruins BGs for the people that actually participate
---
Yeah but there arent many guilds where players are consistently getting threat capped with deep prot. 90% of raids won't need fury prot, it just puts pressure on healers. 
---
Also, deep prot only works if you're fully world buffed with consumables. So normalizing it is going to encourage people to try with less than that and it's going to fail.

Because AV leeching isn’t TOS, and is an actual strategy used by all of the top tankers. 
---
It’s ok to AV leech! You can’t be banned for that
---
Shhh he probably really needs this, poor bastard
---
I looked at my logs and I got 10 revenge casts in a 1 minute golemagg and my vod shows 45k threat at the end so like 700+ tps I reckon. 
---
also basically what you linked except accuria instead of shoulders and trueflight instead of belt since I use a dagger offhand I use muggers until onslaught + aclg.
---
What does bayes theorem have to do with any of that? You can't possibly determine the rate of false positives without any additional information.
---
Dude ToS pretty much let's them ban at their discretion
---
Just because you were not a false positive does not mean there are never false positives
---
What’s up I’ve been leeching on 5 different characters no ban
---
Succ my dick nerd it’s totally allowed
---
You think it’s a bannable offense to fish in AV? Y’all are clueless
---
Thank you for the advice, I see you are takiny your own advice well enough, even though unfortunately this isn't real life, and nothing we say to each other matters anyway.
---
There is a rogue on my server that is obviously a bot when the account owner is at work or whatever.  Just sits in the same spot and fishes for 12+ hours every day in the same spot.  I reported them every day or a week but they're still there every time I log on, with the same AFK message 'Fishing for Guild'.
---
Those are shit warriors.
---
I have no problem with warriors preferring to dps, but if you can’t be bothered to keep a plate set and a shield in your bag for 5-man’s - when you need gear from those same 5-mans - then you’re a lazy player.
---
yeah i gotta make an alt.  i had so much fun leveling. im sure itd be a blast again. thanks for ur story
---
I never understood tanks getting mad at dps for pulling aggro, it's on the healer to get mad.
---
I just have to wait for CoS.
---
We DPS's so fast in p2 that I (main tank) never got fire balled and had my threat wiped. 
---
Have your off tanks be in the top 5 for threat gen in p1 then when she lands have them all pop recklessness. If dps gets aggro in p3, bring ony to where you normally tank her to avoid tail swipes
---
Just because they shouldn't ban people for using AHK doesn't mean they wouldn't
---
Classic is all color by numbers at this point.  People keep bringing up the fact that future instances will get harder but they will still be exponentially easier than they were back in 2006.  Fact is that to get gold, ranking, etc... classic is still all about who can grind more than the others.
---
I (for instance) work a full time job and actually have things to do on most weekends - so I will never reach Rank 14 PVP but the people that can sit at home for 16 hours a day running AV over and over will be able to do it.  It doesn't mean they are better at PVP than I am... it just means they have more time to grind honor.
---
Look at MC... anybody that can read knows how to do those boss fights inside and out so it really just comes down to getting gear (which is even necessarily) needed to progress all the way through.  Guilds were doing it in greens this time around within a week or two of launch.  I am in a guild I would consider somewhat casual and we have been clearing Ony/MC in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours in one night  from the first week we did a guild run back in September or October.  This was not how it was in original Vanilla but here we are.
---
Every strat, every grind, spot, every item's worth is known - heck there are people even investing in and/or farming things that won't be valuable until Phase 5 right now.  So I agree with OP that Classic isn't really about skill... it's about absorbing the reams of information out there about it and just executing on that - some could argue that is skill but honestly you can get 1000 gold in this game just by face-rolling buttons all day long.
---
I bet the people who are saying "you deserve to be banned blizz knows what they are doing" are the same people who say blizz doesnt know how to maintain the game
---
Never had a problem with it
---
Massive ego or massive troll? Or both?
---
I can't tell.
---
I think retail is pretty much done. I should've titled it better as "ex botter" because botting died in WoD. I don't doubt there's some private low number bots out there but people are paying a high price for that which IMO is probably not worth it
---
It's shown some people weren't botting, they were just ACTING like bots.
---
1.I understand that you should use TOEP before applying corruption because your dot will benefit from the temporary spell power boost even after the trinket buff expires.  
---
That is false.  Classic wow and TBC use snap shotting mechanics.  Meaning that when your spell is cast any effects on you are taken into account such as PI,AP, and ToEP.
---
Yes shadowburns will knock off debuffs with under 5 second durations very often.

Warlocks are good because you need curses to support the rest of the raid dps.  Some weeks you may have 5 warlocks, some weeks you may have 2 warlocks.  Something about the class I find the locks are very finicky players and often times don't commit many months of their lives to PVE progression for each phase of content.

/clap
---
Looks like alliance dogs are back on the menu boys
---
If you took the time to read the actual post, I've laid out the basis pretty simply, even for you.
---
I enjoyed Classic more when I was levelling. I enjoy levelling alts and grinding preraid bis for the same reason.
---
Tbf it wasn’t only bots. I had a guildie who still isn’t even 60 get slapped with the 6 month. It was overturned this morning.
---
Looks like we’ll just part as friends
---
I did complain about afkers, but unlike the commenter above, I understand why the exist in this current system. I would love if blizzard would enforce their EULA and ban active AFKers in PvP, but I’m not blaming the mechanisms of a 15 year old game for them. 
---
Though I can see how you misunderstood that since reading must be hard for you.
---
Dude that’s like 95% of the people on this subreddit
---
Yup. Read the last sentence of the post
---
I mean I botted when retail botting was big and I think I had a good understanding of it so I wanted to pitch in my two cents. I've done my time for my wrong doings and haven't touched it since. Partly because its dead of course
---
So... What if you got banned but are active in BGs? 
---
I've been playing AV pretty casually (maybe 5-10 games per day when I have time) for the last week or so and never went AFK in a game aside from announcing "brb bio" or "grabbing a beer" which was rare and never lasted more than 1-2 minutes. I was at Drek at the end of every match, not just hanging out in the Alliance cave or something. Now my account is suspended for six months and my first appeal has already been marked "resolved" with no explanation. To make this a bit more tragic my account also holds our guild bank and I'm finally off work with ample free time to play until Thursday.
---
I understand everyone being annoyed with AFKers and botters, I am as well, but there were clearly some folks that got banned without cause. The most frustrating part if I feel completely helpless to do anything about it. I'm not being told what I did wrong and my appeal apparently didn't even get looked at. The appeal ticket was closed before the Live Chat with a GM even completed.
---
If anyone has suggestions on how to get through this process please let me know ASAP.
---
Thanks, 
---
Gen, Grobbulus
---
And as a warrior that can tank why would I ever join your group when I can have a plate monopoly?
---
And any good GM will ask them a math problem. Lol.
---
Paid transfers being the best option as a result of a torrent of bad decisions is a complete joke.
---
Realms are being killed left and right due to Alliance fleeing from them or to them. It’s a good thing that after AQ factions don’t matter and the game can just go back to Retail.
---
Minor speed is +8% and IMO much better than 7 Stam.
---
Whether or not there's a good reason to do it differently depends entirely on whether or not doing it differently is better.
---
I might of course be wrong, but it's my understanding that it isn't better, only different.
---
Shit opinion, people and companies make mistakes. It’s not unavoidable or unrealistic.
---
It takes a couple hours after Tuesday maintenance. A differing amount of time for every person, it seems. It took 8 hours for me once and one time 12 hours for a guildie.
---
If you want to come over to Grobbulus (RPPVP - West Coast) I can help you out.   Good server and good balance.  If you are super new it's not too late to switch.
---
if you read the post he linked yesterday about people vehemently attacking people who were apart of the ban wave (In which, a lot of innocent people were wrongly banned, check the new posts on this subreddit) then you'd understand the context within which he used it. I think its applicable tbh
---
Theres been quite a few ban waves already. One today, the 24th, a few on November and October
---
Why would I recognize ANY of their names? I never claimed to be OG DnT. Did you even read what I posted?
---
Oh neat, post the link to the podcast. Can't wait to hear how much of a self-absorbed piece of shit you are :)
---
My wow icon don't flash by default for bg queues. You probably already have the addon mentioned here installed.
---
&gt;actually officers in the DnT from vanilla
---
Midnghtrmblr, Flynn, Xodexx, Bloodshot, Heals, Vestige, Licia, Reyege, Faythe, Asilem, Schmitty, Blacken, Fingardis, Ironpuma, Sploitz, Styloss, Dolemite, Kaboomzz, Brilliance, and the unnamed hunter with R14 gear and warsong gulch tabard who took this extremely low-res screenshot for himself after DnT lined up for their first C'thun kill screenshot would be Nineteen.
---
Perhaps one of your officers can confirm this for you.
---
RuBik's CUbe WaT?
---
I agree with everything you said, but I need clarification on 
---
&gt;     deep prot only works if you're fully world buffed with consumables
---
Are you referring to "works" as in mitigation, effectiveness, threat? 
---
Do you mean that normalizing fury prot is bad?
---
Yup
---
So punish the people abusing it, not the vast majority of innocent people? Nerfing the system instead of fixing the problem was a lazy bandaid fix.
---
Minor speed is PvP BIS forever
---
I think they were removed, I saw 4 such sob story posts the past 48 hours.
---
Ezactly, mecha gnome lives matter
---
i dont know when i dont feel like speedrunning. i make my own group and tell people its going to be a chill/slow run. groups still fill up quickly and if someone acts up then they get a warning and if they dont learn, bye bye.
---
 it is easy to keep track of black sheeps with blacklist addons too.
---
my issue with pugs is that nobody speaks up or is upfront about his xp. fake it till you make it basicly.
---
 i dont have a lot of issues since i manage expectations before the run, offer to coach/teach them and set clear rules. its a good way to filter people.
---
You’re aware that I’m referring to afks in battlegrounds or are you incapable of reading my comments?  People multi tasking aren’t the ones getting banned buddy, pressing space once every 10 seconds is still being afk regardless if you’re watching Netflix.
---
I meant killing the first ogre not the first boss. I think all have a chance to drop the key.
---
the addon AutoCarrot does all of this automatically for you when you mount/demount
---
You must be playing with some shitty warriors.
---
Thanks, I really appreciate the reply. Didn’t realize Dist Dagger was OH, and you’re right those mats are way too much so that narrows it down quite a bit. I do have the rep already so I’ll likely grab Glacial for the moment, then work on Bonescraper, rather not spend the gold if I don’t have to.
---
thank you!
---
"You're out of your God damn mind if you think I'll exchange a service for another! Get your ass in here and tank for us you entitled piece of shit!"
---
Few things, they are not 20g+ to make. If you shop around you can make them for about 5g or less. Also they can be traded after use. So you can make one and pass to another engineer to make another. Yes you can buy a billion snowballs and mail them out, however that becomes a hassle when moving them all around. I did both, made snow machines and mailed myself a ton of snowballs for the future. I should note that I purchased all pets for 1g and under. So anything above that in the future would be profit.
---
You really want to optimize for pure damage as moonkin. If you're running out of Mana it means the fights are too long, you're not using the right consumables (major Mana, demonic runes), or your rotation is bad (spam max rank Starfire, rank 1 at low Mana)
---
Tanks are in much more demand and can do almost whatever they want.
---
Don't worry bud. I'd feel stupid too after making this post.
---
quick search [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRZPzBc8N-M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRZPzBc8N-M)
---
The people i know who got a ban, are all making alt accounts on reddit and other forums to claim their bans were "overturned". I think they feel embarassed for being laughed at, that they are pushing this weird flex. Its some weird tick, where they have to "own" those who laughed at them yesterday.
---
When that dies down, they will continue pushing that Classic is dead and that Blizzard is bad. Then they will come back to the game when the ban is lifted.
---
Do you afk and netflix bgs? Did you use anty afk scripts to not log out during p1 not to wait in lines?
---
By that logic hybrid classes should pass all gear unless they have pidgeon-holed themselves into just one role for 100% of the time.
---
In my opinion this makes no sense for 5-mans. It's not taking "their gear", it's not anyones gear to begin with when it just dropped and is being rolled for. If a DPS-specced warrior sees "LF1M tank" advert for a dungeon he needs gear from he can in my opinion join as a tank and roll for dps gear without explicitly declare his intent do so. It should be assumed that he can collect gear for role other than what he is currently performing. It's not something that should have to be explicitly declared. You're free to disagree but it's a pretty steep requirement for hybrid-classes to pidgeon-hole themselves to a role that they declare as MS and then only perform that role or only roll on pieces nobody else needs.
---
If you can link proof of over 15 ban reversals (you can't) I might agree you're onto something.
---
Also, a basis for a claim doesn't need to be empirical - my claims were 100% logical.
---
yeah gotta remember to play for fun and miraculously u start having fun again. actually way wiser/harder than it sounds

#**&lt;Remnant&gt;** - *A Grobbulus Guild*

##*Alliance | Optional RP | Casual PvE | High-end PvP | CST | 10/10 MC and Onyxia*
---
We raid so we can PvP. It's that simple.
---
**About Us**
---
A tight-nit group who have been gaming together for the past 15 years. We've participated in both endgame progression PvE and high-rated PvP. This includes clearing most Vanilla content back when it was relevant and boosting multiple individuals to Grand Marshal. We are looking to bolster our ranks in hopes of creating a core group of raiders and pre-made PvP groups. Guild members are welcome to RP if they desire, but this is not an RP guild.
---
**Raiding**
---
Most of us are working adults with families. We have no intention of forcing people to fast-track the leveling process to get to raids. We understand that people have lives outside the game and attendance will never be 100%. What we do expect is that when you sign up to raid you will show up and perform.
---
**Loot System** - *Loot Council*
---
Our goal is to be as transparent with this as possible as we are aware of how out of control this system can get. Even though we are not raiding hardcore, our goal is to clear content in a timely manner and pace so this is the best option for us to achieve that. To help with this process, we've expanded our officer core to include dependable standouts we've met, and continue to meet, along the way.  By promoting from outside our initial friend group we hope to eliminate/minimize any potential drama or issues and smooth out gear priorities appropriately.
---
**Raiding Hours** - *Sunday 12 - 3pm CST*
---
These hours are aimed at people that can't commit to a weekday or two every week, and want an efficient, well prepared raid once a week. Smaller raids like Onyxia are scheduled throughout the week to account for reset days.
---
**Other Events**
---
Premade battleground and PvE groups are ran throughout the week.

What do you think botting is? It is a script that runs a task. Your script might not be harmful to the game but its technical still a bot.
---
Fuckin 6 AM ugh. At least i'll be out before the fireworks go off
---
&gt; their raid gear is better than the PvP rare set
---
Here's where you're wrong.
---
Yeah well that's a bit different
---
Those are fair points and closer to what I do. Herb/LW on main. Was skinning until 2-3 weeks ago and gold flow is well over my needs now with little farming. Haven't really gotten into leveling an alt but use my twink in progress to DE.
---
Im just poking fun at all the people claiming false positives, i havent done that, the moment i saw estimated queue 8h i rerolled on day1 to Dreadmist
---
i get enjoyment out of antagonizing people i hate
---
How??
---
The fact that he went back to his previous post and commented "Blown out" on nearly every comment is pretty shitty imo and disgusting that the auto mod didn't ban him for spamming already lol.
---
i dont care if anyone here sees my way im just here to gloat and antagonize
---
You do you, still pathetic
---
Nahhh, let em rub it in the salty bois faces, they know who they are.
---
It'll die out within the day unlike the daily updates on that PVP server that nobody cared about after a week
---
For what class is the pvp rare set better than Tier or raid gear?
---
Wow this exact situation happened to my brother, we were both heading to Blackfathom Deeps and he got stuck, then a level 13 or 14 orc hunter came along, and after a few exchanged emotes the hunter killed him and everyone carried on with their days, it was a neat interaction.
---
I also did engineering just for the death ray. As a rogue, I love it
---
We cant have memes but the constant ban posts are ok? Cool.
---
Get a boar. Cats are for pvp and owl looks whack.  
---
 What you need is a good ol hog thatll tank and charge them boys in place.
---
&gt; Maybe you shouldn't have complained about the Report AFK feature and gotten it nerfed. Otherwise this wouldn't be an issue.
---
Yeah man it's super weird that people complained when they were getting griefed. How dare they not want to get griefed!
---
Kind of the vibes I was getting from there, also lost the roll the last two times it actually dropped... not getting burned a third lol.
---
I believe you’re correct, but I’ve still seen her cast 2-3 unresisted fireballs in a row on our mt
---
Alright great. Thanks for the input.
---
Yeah dude! Then part of your initiation is we bukkake you till we ain't got no more :)
---
What makes that pathetic? some say playing video games is pathetic. Why be so judgmental on what i do for entertainment!? how very rude and immature of you
---
Wait, you paid the guy he ninja’d from? Hot dog you guys are nice people
---
The mage boots have spell hit on them.
---
Enjoy the drama . Most content on this sub is trash anyway. This way we get some entertainment
---
I forgot to mention lobotomizer which is solid but again slow for a dagger. The price lands at like 100g but it is definitely solid dps, I think the problem would be the debuff, I don't know how that plays out with the debuff cap.
---
Yea, and how many raid-logging raiders are shooting for R13/14? Seriously, most of the PvE folks got in, got their rep, and got out. And those still grinding rep are actually playing, because doing objectives and actually winning is the best rep/hour.
---
I've gotta admit it was nice back in BC when every DPS class didn't need the exact same gear.
---
On the other hand, it's really easy to spot a well geared character because you've seen every variation before.
---
Leveling is nice. I love playing my shaman with full gear
---
&gt;Fuck this subreddit and fuck you losers
---
Talking about immaturity
---
Imagine being this triggered
---
&gt; And once everyone gets in and the first green drops, this one guy flips off and starts needing as well because "he too needs gold" and "I should just go farm if all I'm here for is gold".
---
=
---
This is part of why I love being a warlock.
---
"Oh someone's cat is on fire and needs to go // someone is being a total asshat in the group? Fine, I have a summoning portal..." ...and  just like that are ready to go again with an easy replacement.
---
It sucks when you do have to stick it out though because no one wants to wait another 20+ min to find a replacement AND also wait for them to get there, e.g. to Maraudon which is usually a boat ride + flight path + horse trip.
---
That dagger from the world boss is pretty good afaik. Hand of Edward is good in some fights if they come near you. The aurastone is fine
---
Oh, my bad. Carry on. Good luck guy.
---
FD isn't consistent and the only hidden mechanic is how bad they've scripted it to be affected by spell batching in ways it didn't.
---
I
---
You have baby hands holy shit lol
---
Now stop being an aggrogrant brat who spreads misinformation.
---
OP looks like the biggest dumbass now, and won't admit he was wrong.
---
You have TSM retail installed?
---
Don julios? Av exalted.
---
We also have this really awesome dude that rides the boat between Menethil and Theramore.  He RP's as a sailor by himself and it is highly endearing.
---
And now instead of asking Blizzard to fix the broken system they created, y'all lash out at people doing nothing wrong. This is like complaining about people having level 1 alts at lotus spawns, or level 20 summoning chars with level 1 alts to summon in raid groups for world bosses. Don't get mad at people for taking advantage of what the game allows, and playing the game the way that they pay for the way they want to.
---
You think I like people afk leeching in AV? No, but both teams have the issue so it balances out at least, and it is up to Blizzard to help fix the problem, as reporting AFK is currently useless.
---
Mate I haven't been banned for shit, but ok
---
A small advantage of lower population servers is that people are much less picky. I play as moonkin and have not once, ever, had anyone in a 5man complain or even so much as mention it. As long as they fill the group, no one really cares.
---
So pick a high pop server. Also most low pop servers, by classic standards, still have higher pop than full vanilla servers.
---
Does it matter if he said it? Its not botting.
---
Yo 19, you'll always be filthy Drama first and foremost. JKJK.
---
Great thank you!
---
We do this: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8bp2f/onyxia/faalvn6/?context=3
---
and the word rejoiced
---
I used Finkle's for a long time myself. Lobotomizer would be best. The debuff is low priority, like deep wounds, and shouldn't affect anything. If you have mugger's and just go Dagger warrior you wouldn't even need to save for Edgies. That's my plan once I got Perdition's Blade. I guess if I got Thunderfury I'd grab Edgies, but that's a big if.
---
They haven't.
---
Just imagine finally being able to raid MC on a TI-83
---
Then they should attempt to FIX THE PROBLEM instead of punishing the vast majority of players just trying to have fun and do BGs. Is that too expensive as well? Decent game design?
---
This is close to my line of thinking. The game is great, but blizz willingly letting a few big problems that could be easily modified while keeping up the spirit of the game really bugs me. It makes me think that things will only get worse from here on, and there is no future with acti-blizz. They will gladly hotfix a few things that they deem worth fixing, but wont listen to the players when something obviously needs to change. How are realms with fucked up balance even going to do the aq event? I am sure theyll just expect people to transfer so they can fill their pockets even more from their own mistakes
---
Mankrik is a good PvE server for Horde.
---
(1000000 ÷ 7 days) ÷ 18 hours = ~7963 honor/h.
---
I reached up to 10k honor per hour by just doing AV (including actively engaging in pvp), So definitively possible. As horde.
---
Why have any tanks? Why not just tell all the warriors to spec fury and dps tank it. That’ll solve the off tank problem, right? 🙄
---
The fact of the matter is that all but one or two encounters were designed for at least 3-4 tanks. Once you get gear you can solo or duo tank everything, but starting out you need the extra tanks. This isn’t an issue of dps. It’s an issue of gearing. 
---
Besides... what’s the difference between a tank drop across 4 or so tanks and a mage drop between 6-8 mages?
---
Sorry if this comes off obtuse, but what makes a warlock a good warlock when the class pushes 1 button for its rotation?
---
Do the tanks not have world buffs and consumables too? Those Shield Slam crits should be doing crazy threat.
---
no. AV is meta. Sad and strange meta.
---
Yea, that's my point. Most PvE players are playing for rep, and afking doesn't get you any rep. Winning and doing objectives does. So don't blame the rep rewards for people being fucking potatoes.
---
\&gt; I already know I want to play on horde faction on a pve server but thats about all I know. Im also from NA.  
---
There're not many PvE NA servers, maybe like 5? Hope you can find the one that suits you best :)
---
That a brilliant piece of immersion!
---
Do people actually care about parsing in classic?
---
I love tanking. I tanked as a Brewmaster in retail for years and was looking forward to tanking in classic aswell and leveled a Warrior up till lvl 55.
---
I had a lot of fun, specced Prot at about lvl 45 and tanked every single dungeon up to and including BRD.
---
Then it sort of dawned on me: I dont have the time to commit to main tanking for a guild.
---
I dont want to DPS as a Warrior. I dont want to be a DPS Warrior who sometimes off tanks. 
---
I want to be a sword and shield wielding deep prot tank but I’m too much of a casual to ever make that work.
---
So now I’m leveling a Paladin (36) with my heart set on healing for raids.
---
So what I guess I’m trying to say is that a player like me, who isnt hardcore (or semi-hardcore) but still only wants to tank, dont really have a place in the end game (raids). 
---
Still having fun thou!
---
We have a good pve horde crew on Ashkandi
---
&gt; They must believe that doing so would cause more people to leave than they would lose in revenue.
---
[X] doubt
---
Half truths and whole lies. Enjoy your ban.
---
lol look at kaydenkross' reply.
---
Calm down dude, why the fuck are you so angry?
---
indeed... but I don't think he knew he was doing that. You can see the frantic clicking. This is not the entire video either. The entire video includes him trying to go back into the instance to get his items from the chest. He also started mass inviting random people to join his raid ID. I'm not an expert on the raid mechanics though. Maybe he's a genius and he just screwed that entire guild over for fun. Funny part is that he joined another guild on the server almost immediately. Seemed like it may have been planned. I'll be avoiding him and the guild he joined for sure.
---
Yeah kinda long way of saying “I’ve got so much to do” heh.
---
On the other hand, it seems perfectly acceptable for a Paladin/Druid tank to roll on healing gear. This has been a major driver for me to continue tanking instances at 60.
---
As someone who has played since vanilla, I've been loving classic but I have to agree, really looking forward to TBC and WOTLK, especially as someone who used to play a paladin (and will likely go back to one in TBC) the itemization, play style and QOL just improved so much in TBC.
---
Yes it does. I get rep all the time. Other players are getting me rep. If I die then ghost run to RH gy no one thinks im afk. I soak up the same amount of rep everyone else does.
---
Just because some play doesnt mean the game wont be dead. It's when core playerbase leaves that the game dies. There is already a die off happening and it seems like a massive exodus would happen if people were given a reason
---
That's a good thing.
---
warrior R10 is bis till tbc
---
Indeed, they went with a particular interpretation of #nochanges. I don't want to advocate 1.12-esque #nochanges, but this is the reality. 
---
Swapping the release order, partial gating (like ""just" gate ZG enchants"), etc would be #changes. And I believe it's not possible to do without a feeling of randomness in which changes are cherrypicked to release and which are not.
---
I agree with you 100% about the alliance racials, I thought they were close enough to horde back in vanilla.  That's why I'm so bummed about the current state.  
---
I mean all the nightelf areas are cool.  Ahhh, now I'm torn.  Had my mind set on going undead warlock this time around (was a tauren Hunter through vanilla and BC) but now I may have to make the most evil gnome ever.
---
The problem is not afking in battlegrounds, it is the stupid honor system in the first place, people wanted vanilla, well they certainly got vanilla in this case, afking some BG's is just part of the ranking process unfortunately.
---
Whitemane / Incendius / Arugal / Grobbulus / Kromcrush / Sulfuras
---
Seem to be the most balanced atm with good populations
---
The lonely grind meta ._.
---
I know my guild even has a number of well geared and capable of warriors. I am our MT and they normally dps in raids but I am amazed at how many of my DPS warriors will refuse to tank a dungeon to get things they need/want. Still need your cape of the black baron or righteous orbs to enchant that new weapon? They wont tank their own runs.   
---
Now I'm nromally down to tank for my guild, I need literally nothing out of 5 mans and I'm not gonna charge guildies to run things, but it surpises me every time I get asked to tank x or y by a warrior in my guild.
---
Banning in waves creates uncertainty around botting, this way the botters don't get easy feedback on what "nailed them" making it nearly impossible to make undetectable bots. 
---
Let's take the extreme opposite and assume a system where botters get banned the second they get detected. Someone trying to make bots could then sub 50+ accounts and use them to figure out EXACTLY how the detection system work and then recoup the cost by immidietly selling "undetectable bots" and get rich by ruining the game. 
---
Instead the bot makers have uncertainty about them so selling the bots is hard cause people buying them don't know when the next ban wave  will be and if the bot is detectable. Hence, the buyers aren't sure if it's worth potentially looseing characters they have invested a lot of time into.
---
It wasnt directed at you but the guy you resonded to, just related to what you said. And plenty of people are saying that.
---
Also, wasn't implying those things are required for a fulfilling life, but they are, believe it or not, the standard definitions of "success".
---
Playing video games for 20 years instead of investing time on your career and "real life", since some people seem to believe there is a distinction, is the definition of mattering and having an impact, but hey, if it's what makes someone happy, power to them.
---
... what is your solution for a priest spec’ed as Shadow who is healing in the dungeon?  A very common occurrence because Shadow Priests many times are forced into a healing role just to get instance runs - especially if not supported by guild runs.
---
I personally roll for both items on my priest (shadow damage or healing) in this case.  I do make exceptions for rare items especially when in a DPS role - for instance I passed on Second Wind yesterday so our Pally healer could take.
---
But later while healing a run I needed on Omnicast boots when there was also a Warlock in our group - and in reality those boots aren’t far off the healing pre-raid BIS either.
---
It’s all very situational.
---
I'd rank em Aurastone&gt;HandofEdward&gt;Witchblade
---
I don't really wanna defend botters but blizz is really bad banning people who did not bot . Whatever they use to flag does generate a ton of false positives
---
Got my first pair in my first run at 56. My raid Leader didn’t Think i had it, so i Got another pair the next week at lvl 59 :)
---
Omg no changes !!! How dare they implement something fun and exciting that’s new and harmless. What an atrocity!
---
Yep. Best pvp server if ur into that.
---
Boreal Mantle are better shoulders for these phases.
---
Ok I see. I thought you meant "good" as in "skilled."
---
Yeah happy people are definitely all over Reddit threads cussing out people and telling them to suck your dick... suuuuure buddy whatever you say!
---
The addon welcomes me to the Legion expansion pack when I log in lol.
---
yeah he was the easiest
---
Yeah i think Blizz went from one extreme of not having enough servers to the oppisite extreme of having way too many..
---
...What? Botting is not the only bannable offense in this game. And even if it were, he clearly wants Blizzard to ban BG AFKers regardless of the existence of botting. So how is it relevant to say that AFKing isn't botting? It literally doesn't matter and does not change OP's point at all.
---
Can't you get like perma perma banned from Overwatch for flaming?  Like they snapshot your mobo and you can never install a new version of the game.
---
I guess that's the difference between a monthly subscription and micro-transactions.
---
afking is punishable there's even an ingame report feature specifically for it
---
I'd care not to be 50%, lmao.
---
The comment that started this chain was talking about having AHK press the same button every few mins for hours to avoid going AFK to be disconnected, that is not able to be accomplished via an in game macro and therefore is not allowed. Pressing a button 1 time and having it send the same action to the client 100 times is also not possible via a macro, and therefore not allowed. GSE is an addon that essentially makes it possible to put different macro commands into a cast sequence, which is fine as long as you press the button each time. 
---
What you have linked in your other post is in fact not a blue post, but a response from a GM. GMs are normally pretty solid but they are not the word of god. There are many examples of GMs who are wrong and I believe that is the case with that response. Blue posts are better, but those from customer service reps are still prone to mistakes, so with that said even the blue post I found isn't perfect. At best we have no information outside of the ToS.
---
The ToS are vague intentionally so, but I'd say using something to prevent yourself from logging out due to being afk is against the [EULA](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement). Check out the Cheating section.
---
For DPS warriors. But yea, I can see pushing rank if you're a warrior then.
---
I was getting ready to cancel my sub if Blizzard didn't start banning the botters.  Hearing all the cheaters get upset is music to my ears.
---
haha, and you'll always be a horde traitor (:
---
Friend got unbanned. Why would i be mad? I'm happy  tell all these denying pricks to go fuck themselves. Were you also claiming people lied about their ban?
---
Edit: suck me beautiful.
---
Blizzard will see the success of classic, and the numbers of what tbc had for playerbase and see dollar signs. My guess is every sever converts to tbc. That is the solution that would take the least amount of effort, and have the highest chance of bringing in new revenue.
---
&gt; Retail tanking is just mitigation.
---
Except for when you actually get Skittish
---
This. Boars are great and they are in the starting zones of all hunter races.
---
so you don't see them in new, but he sees them on the front page? this sounds backwards. also i have never seen them on the front page
---
You aren't gonna get any content patch announcements more than 2 weeks before they come out, and BWL isn't coming out until after nzoth.
---
Once one of them farts and pops the bubble the other one out.
---
You wear shoulders to complete the 2-piece set bonus, which is +23 spell damage. The pvp shoulders are the equivalent of 38 spell damage and 1% crit if you are using them to complete the set bonus.
---
I use ahk for general productivity stuff and it's always running, never been banned for botting. It has to actually be interacting with the game for it to count
---
B/c teleport to graveyard doesn't exist i guess ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Don't give up on the alchemy, it is the easiest way in the game to make passive income. Just look up a levelling guide to get it to 275, you should be able to do that pretty inexpensively, and do a transmute arcanite every 2 days. That can easily net you 7-10 gold every 2 days for about a minute of work, including auction house time. It will easily pay back the investment into levelling alchemy, and support you in anything else you want to do (including levelling tailoring and making your Truefaith!)
---
It doesnt stun, but it immobilize and i agree.
---
I am using a Boar and i am loving it!
---
ya I notice this when I logged in and read the server list, I just am typically not interested in PVP when it comes to wow usually, but more just exploring and killing things, could I still enjoy a pve experience on a pvp server?
---
From activity I've seen on server Discord and posts here there was definitely a banwave.
---
Its barely been 4 months, chill.
---
Is that formula for mp5, or mana per tick? Ticks happen every 2sec, right?
---
hitting that 1 button more than the other locks, so basically positioning.
---
Big difference between defending a tower and AFK farming. 
---
But you already knew that.  This smells like a really pathetic attempt at rationalization.
---
Agreed.  I love when another warrior gets salty cos I'm not following his "rule" about what gear my spec is "allowed" to roll on.
---
1. just keep shadow bolting, you are literally wasting the damage you clip off prematurely, but this is honestly a pointless question, dude the trinket has a whopping 90 second cooldown, nearly no current fights last longer than that, the only one scenario is like, if you pop trinket at the start of rag, and get to use it again with 30 seconds left
---
2. don't shadowburn, it's not worth casting
---
3. don't compare raw damage across different classes, every class brings its own unique utilities, so the only worthwhile comparison (for raw dps) is with your own class
---
Unfortunately I don't record while I'm playing, never seen much point in it until now. I might have some screenshots in my WoW folder, but you could easily refute those as "okay, you weren't botting ALL the time."
---
I've submitted another appeal, hopefully one that will actually get reviewed this time. I have a little bit of faith after seeing many other folks posting that they've been unbanned. Really hope it gets sorted out before everyone takes tomorrow off.
---
That's a nice amount of gold. I need that plus another 3k or so, so I can craft my hammer...
---
Im nervous about picking a high populated server because Ive read that they can be very hyper competitive and Im looking more for engaging community yet casual, should I go medium populated server or go ahead and join a high populated server? Also another thing I noticed but reading from the ingame server list why are none listed as "low population"?
---
I'm usually curious as to what happened to the members that disappeared but I wouldn't ask a dude to talk to his ex over it, hah.
---
The downvotes you are swimming in really shows how many people on this forum think botting is acceptable.
---
&gt;Friend got unbanned. Why would i be mad?
---
I don't know man, you tell me. Happy people don't act like you are tho
---
&gt;Were you also claiming people lied about their ban?
---
Preferences differ. Get over it.
---
Zoinks! You caught a meet-cute in the wild!
---
That's great, I'll have to check it out after work.
---
Can you set the potion shortcut to use your weakest potion first? I get so many level 35 potions from fishing but I keep a few 45s just in case. I'd rather use up the lower ones 95% of the time
---
Nah doubt it. Been afk bottling in av since release and even a gm told me to stop and no ban here. Fully done with an advanced script that sends me to base.
---
As I was killing the un goro demon last night 2 horde hunters rolled up but they /cheered me..was a nice surprise
---
The toughest part of it is finding a good group of people you enjoy hanging around with every week, but once you get in the routine, it's a pretty easy 2-4 hours a week and a chance at great loot. People are generally pretty helpful if you're upfront about being new. I'd just whisper an experienced priest in the guild about some pointers, and they'll probably be more than happy to help set you up for raiding.
---
Hmm. Which part is half truth and which part is a whole lie? How did you come to this determination? Or perhaps you're just a troll... OR A BOT!
---
Yeah i dont know about that bud i win like 1 in 8 AV at this point as horde
---
Happy petty people do! My dick, your mouth.
---
It's far enough for a coc. It's not super far but when I'm cone of cold kiting I can always see.

&gt;I should come to your home, rape your wife and then slaughter your whole family and it would be OK because ...

This might be a bit of a straw-man, wouldn't you say?
---
He spoke to Chromie.
---
If you played hunter exclusively on private servers, then I definitely wouldn't recommend it. If you haven't, go ahead.
---
Plenty of bugs, FD combat drop can get cancelled bcus of target dropping being directly tied to spell batching, this is a strictly 1.13 client bug. Same bug is why you don't drop target instantly when rogues vanish or stealth. Look at any old pvp video and you can see target drops the moment a rogue casts it, not in the batch after it.
---
I would try to pick a high population server because you are leveling behind the pack. Over 50 percent of players (this is a guess) have level 60s now. This takes up most players time. Of course most of them have other characters they are leveling but if you choose a low pop sever or an imbalanced one you might have a tough time finding people to quest and do dungeons with.
---
Edit: I would also choose a PvE server. I couldn’t imagine leveling now on a PvP server
---
Unless you are using consumes every pull this is an extreme exaggeration. My repairs on full plate warrior are about 40s a death.

Why should a banned botter deserve sympathy?
---
Owls are a bunch if whack suckas. Get a boar and then you’ll see that pet tank those cocksuckers.
---
Yo bro, i got the same reply, and not only am i unbanned, but Blizzard gave me a formal apology, a free rank 14 in peeveepee and 2.3% stake in the company.
---
Its why im spending new years day telling you how unbanned i am, hahahaha who is laughing now? HAHAHAH reddit plebs, you got dunked on for laughing at me! I-i totally have the proof hhaha.
---
Yes, if you have 2 elven rings its better.. you also get .5% crit with elven ring... with Dal Rends, i honestly didnt parse very well overall. You do good dmg, but once you get a weapon it will be a whole new tier. 2 of our rogues went from 5/7 slot to 1/2 once they got viskag, and i jumped from 6/7 to top 3 when i got perditions. For rogues, weapon is the most important upgrade. once you get yours, keep doing what you're doing and I'm sure you'll be topping those charts.

I was sitting at around 12% hit with talents/gear and my gear/talents look like this now in 90%+ parses: bit.ly/2tfylDJ

Claims to play with original members...

Doesn't recognize screenshot filled with original members...

Hmmm, I wonder, is this because your GMs aren't pictured there?

Screenshot too blurry to see all the names? Why not check the (nonexistent) proof that your GMs provided you gullible saps with against all of perfectly clear names in that picture. Oh right, because your GMs have no proof because they weren't there.

... what
---
&gt;I had one of these guys in my last LBRS run... Not only did he get upgrades, he also got 6-7 of my greens and won a 50g enchanting receipe. Seriously, fuck these people. 
---
This is entirely your fault after the first green
---
Yeah I agree. But the playerbase also seems a lot more intelligent. With so many guides/info healers and tanks will be more prepared than the previous iteration of the game. I'm Gna buy when I have spare gold just to create a personal stockpile.
---
As a hunter i look foward to being fully geared super fast since i only have to share loot with 2 or three other guys. I bet theres a sweet spot early in new raids where hunters are kicking ass while the 8 fury warroirs are fighting over loot.
---
i mean you literally dont need any of that to be a good tank. i have a hard time believe you actually tanked in vanilla talking like that. sounds like you are just repeating what you have heard others say.   very very few peopel in vanilla chaes BiS gear let alone even had a clue what BiS even meant. I  mean come on. most vanilla players started raiding in greens for fucks sake.
---
Always good to be aware of your flaws!

so does your nickname

WoW on Linux runs like shit if you don't use anything to translated DirectX to Vulkan. Blizzard stopped supporting OpenGL for Windows iirc, so we have to rely on stuff like dxvk or vulkand3d (I think that's what it's called ?). 
---
But the switch apparently uses the Vulkan API, so technically, it could work maybe. But you'd need vulkan-capably drivers on Linux on switch.
---
It's a nice weekend project to try for sure !
---
seethe, cope, have sex, etc
---
It's 20% posted because not everyone who kills the mobs is on the quest, or has the addons to track it.  Isn't there a precursor to that, and are you sure you completed it?
---
Had a group "LF TANK arena/anger/golem, sgc &amp; hoj res PST"
---
Saw them shouting for 45 minutes before they unreserved hoj
---
Warrior is very fun to PVE dps with and being able to tank 5 mans while leveling is a plus. Your end game rotation will be much more engaging as a Warrior. PVP skirmishes are a blast with healer. If you quest I suggest looking to group with a class that can heal.
---
Warlocks are very fun and easy to solo level. Free mount is dope. Fear is absolutely busted for PVP. PVE dps is not very compelling.
---
Do what you enjoy more, but I would recommend Warrior to be able to experience the game from a new perspective as a melee plate wearer on the Alliance. Also Dwarves look badass in plate.
---
Yeah true. That's my plan. I just bought out 1080 thorium lol for thorium widgets ahead of dark moon fair. I'll just use my next lot of gold for black lotus now.
---
Are they just digging for the process names, or actually reading the memory to figure out what they're doing?  If it's the former, couldn't you disguise the process name?  My understanding is AHK only emulates windows actions, so if it's disguised in name, would they be able to detect it?
---
Also could you clarify on click to move?  I'll often press both mouse buttons to move when my left hand is occupied with something else, but I don't think that's what you mean.  I actually typically initiate movement this way, before hitting an auto run hotkey.
---
not helped by all the pve dorks like me getting exalted and never doing AV again.
---
My 8====D your O:
---
&gt; Do you think I bot AV for 8-35 minutes, then hop back on my laptop to WPVP legit?
---
Yes.  Go world pvp until your queue pops, then you can go afk for 20mins.  Get a snack, go to the bathroom, whatever, and then come back in time to see your team lose and then go back to world pvp farming.
---
this is what OP is spending his New Year’s Eve doing lol
---
BLOWN OUT
---
Says the guy who spent months sucking off blizzard while jerking off to wow classic content.
---
Yup, just mouse over the the bobber and watch tv or on my ipad etc. Right click on the bobber noise. Rinse repeat, I did have an old guildie that taught their youngest how to fish and he'd leave them go for a bit.
---
I don't know where ya'll are getting this constant talking point on this subreddit, since it's just plainly not the case I've run into as an actual shadowpriest.
---
Yes, we do have mana issues. But it's not 1 min, it's only the longer fights like Rag, Domo, Garr, Ony (fights that are &gt;2 min) that it even starts to present as a problem and can be mitigated by preemptively using mana potions and runes. In 5 mans, it's even less of an issue so long as I get a bunch of mage water and spam drink ASAP after combat, and Spirit Tap procs on dungeon trash give back like 20% of our mana bar.
---
Also, ally gets judgement of wisdom, which is insane regen for priests. Each individual tick of SW:P or Mind Flay can proc it, which also massively increases our mana longevity. SW:P legit gets back like half of its mana cost over the duration if there's a paladin keeping JoW up in the group.
---
It's true that we're middle of the pack in DPS (i'm usually 10~15 on the meters for bosses without dispel mechanics) but we bring huge utility (+15% damage for the warlocks puts them competitive with the mages. And vamp embrace is ~100hp/s for the Spriest's group which on multi tank or AOE heavy fights like Garr/Baron/Shazz/Domo put me consistently in the top 5 healing done with &gt;75% of #1's healing).
---
Make sure you’re casting current rank spells, and training at your class trainer. Mages are pretty easy. 
---
Paladins are also very very easy if you just want to figure out the game. Safe, self heal, very non interactive rotation, tanky... just a bit slow.
---
Apparently raid logging resto shaman can't bot, great argument.
---
The real fix is to just give Alliance players who dont join the game they are queued for deserter.
---
Paladins have an insane amount of situational support spells and anyone not using them is bad.
---
lol reddit literally gives you brain aids also i didnt read the op
---
Ooh I didn't think about that. That could work
---
just because a bot passed the first ban wave doesnt mean blizzard wouldnt be able to find it out next time. as botting gets better so should bot detection. when banning in waves you are giving people notice that they have time to bot. after a wave goes out they can just safely spam bots for a couple months in anticipation of the next ban wave and in this case the bots can be terribly written and still get away with a ton of resources in a couple months
---
didnt read
---
Yikes!
---
People will still screech about no changes and other stupid shit. They allowed as many people as possible to join servers as if they were designing server size with layers in mind. It's mind boggling how stupid their decision was.
---
Can you tell me how you really feel? This seems vague
---
That's also fine, but it would certainly depend on how much time you invest in either. Claiming that any amount of time invested in any activity has no impact on the rest of your life is just plain delusional, a position someone in another thread actually tried to argue (that this isn't "real life", it's just a game, so nothing matters).
---
The hell? They didn’t offer me all that? Which rep did you speak to, I’ll make another ticket.
---
He didn't have the quest. Have fun running LBRS again.
---
Some idiot horde warlock came up and despawned that one for me too. I was so pissed even tho I know it was a mistake. He will forever be ignored by me.
---
The upvotes and downvotes in this thread really paint a sad picture of this community.  I mean I already knew you were a bunch of whining care bear bitches but I didn't realize you were all botting too.
---
I sincerely hope not (expanding beyond 'Vanilla' would more or less undermine the very foundation of Classic)

Oh no, my precious character! What am I to do without my precious character?!

Didn't know you could do this.

I'll be bumping mine up when I get home! Thanks for the info
---
Yeah, unlike warriors\bears that get resource by draining healers - pala tanks need to be very careful on resources. They need to you exactly just enough mana to keep threat.  
---
Use more - and you need to drink after every pull.  
---
Use less - and without taunt you won't get mobs back.
---
You can heal most things in shadow spec though..
---
Those both go to Fury Warrs.
---
I'm not a game designer, and I'm not going to give an opinion without serious thought, because just throwing random ideas out there (which reddit loves to do) doesn't help anyone.
---
Do you have a good solution?
---
If you're hunter or druid, yes.
---
&gt;class pushes 1 button for its rotation?
---
wut? warlocks don't do this lolo
---
Seems like everyone in this thread saying contradictory things to one another. Sigh, guess I can't find a straight answer.
---
We carry ON!!!
---
Queue awesome guitar solo!
---
there is no damn info on this shit man
---
Because some mobs hit hard enough or you need the extra threat generation to cover a priority kill target.
---
Take a serious look at the talent trees and ask yourself what the gap is between a Fury/Arms (or whatever) Warrior with a shield tanking a mob vs a Deep Prot Tank vs a Fury/Prot Tank.  
---
If you're holding a single Garr/Magamar/Sulfron/Domo/etc. add you don't need the threat and the incoming damage shouldnt' be threatening leathal.  Even if you're mostly pre-raid BIS.
---
AV afk botters use multi level concurrent secure stack manipulation with asynchronous masking calls to overflow the x86 activation record of wow and create a dynamic hosted call to internal libraries randomized with an isolated offline entropy source to avoid detection all while scanning L2 cache for intrusions to avoid replay attacks from the servers. And I'm not even mentioning the deadlock and race conditions that occur when the system calls are starved of memory due to the insane backend recurrent neural network needed to achieve quantum superiority. And here you are thinking afk botting is just as simple as pressing spacebar lol okay blizzard needs at least 2 years to catch these people afk in graveyard I'm sorry it's just that advanced.
---
I'm very glad that you shared this information with us.
---
I actually enjoy bringing the "meme specs" to dungeons, many of them do really well in short fights. Shadow Priests and Elemental Shamans in particular are really good in dungeons, and are often much more chill players than those playing Mages.
---
This explains the earthquake last night.
---
I'd feel bad HSing out since the other 3 would have been punished for no reason. It's not my fault some people are cunts. Why would you even suggest I'm to blame lmao?
---
Because, when I offer to tank they will then recruit 2 other dps warriors who pull aggro and roll better.
---
This post implies that only people who afk a lot got caught with botters.
---
The real truth is blizzard just have shitty protocols, which result in shitty banwaves.
---
All I want is to fix druids - make Boomkins/cats viable DPS, give tree form, lifebloom and stacking hots to resto and defensive cooldowns to bear.
---
Yup, not just botting, if your strategy is to AFK inside a battleground I hope you get perma banned.
---
You can turn on right click to where you want to move like WC3
---
I think they were scanning memory so changing process names wouldn't matter
---
I'm in the exact same boat. Just started last night
---
Yeah it just be tough for him making millions of dollars playing the game he loves karma is such a bitch
---
Its buried away in customer service menus, not surprised lots of people don't know about it.
---
Your post makes me want to come AFK in a BG but alas I have places to be and beer to drink.
---
Easy to make gold? Please do tell!
---
Because as a prot warrior with 120g in my pocket, I have no idea what to do.
---
So far, I'm leveling a hunter alt to farm gold in Mara/DMN for me, because it seems like the best option.
---
Farming ores/ herbs are almost impossible on my server because of pvp.
---
you have two trinket slots my friend
---
Pretty sure they are, I haven't seen a single one.
---
Everyone's time is equally valid.
---
But if the Rogue is going to use that loot 100% of the time, and the the Druid is only going to use it 33% of the time, then the Rogue should absolutely get the item first.
---
The whole point of loot rules is to allow everyone to gear up their primary set of gear first, before moving to off-spec sets.
---
Without loot rules, everybody would just roll need on everything, and it would take every play 3-5x longer to get the gear that they need in order to be effective with their primary spec.
---
Many servers have 1.5million+ caps. I know people with 1.8 mill who definitely are not botting.
---
&gt; the wowclassic reddit comminuty that anyone who got a ban must be guilty
---
because 99.99% of the time, they ARE guilty
---
haha, using the kid is brilliant!  I bet they enjoy it, getting to play daddies game.  Win/win!

---
Thunderfury alliance with 4 40man raid groups. 3  have full core.
---
y?
---
In a lot of cases yes, you’re right, but today, every one who posted last night about getting falsely banned has posted their ban was over turned. 
---
From this extremely small sample it looks like either only those legitimately falsely banned spoke up, or, the % or falsely banned this time was kinda high. 
---
As for the not claiming infallible, take a look through the comments on yesterday’s posts about bans. It was a horrid read.
---
It's one of the best threat trinkets.
---
Somewhat on topic: 
---
+hit is better than +crit as well
---
Its not fine when games can end in 9 mins, unlike the day long avs from back in the day.
---
The pet choice is negligible, your friend just needs to get better positioning and be aware of aggroing extra mobs.
---
Typical cow being a bro!
---
1. Curse
---
2. Maybe corruption if your debuff slots allow
---
3. Spam shadowbolt and maybe refresh corruption
---
Obviously this is for single boss fights. And if you're doing something else, you're dong something wrong buddy.
---
Damn thats a fucking good one hahaha

imho...

from the quest General Drakkisath's Demise and the only info I can find is To get this quest you need to kill Overlord Wyrmthalak in Lower Blackrock Spire for General Drakkisath's Command which starts a quest to talk to Marshal Maxwell. He will then offer this quest. My question is this a 19% drop chance or what?
---
I'm this subs Sherlock Holmes and it was china
---
Thank you for the response, I've forwarded it to our GM.
---
Incendius is really good, high pop on both sides, great faction balance and world PvP is actually way more fun in leveling zones - you’ve come at a good time to roll on a PvP server that’s also really competitive in PVE so you get the best of both worlds!  I actually rerolled here after leveling 33 levels on a PVE server that had basically no horde and never looked back, I never have trouble finding groups now either!
---
If you beating mages, that’s a sign of bad mages.  Or you outgear them.  A mage will consistently out DPS an equally skilled/geared priest
---
In addition to this, flip over to berserker stance and pop berserker rage as you're pulling, then flip back to defensive stance (or battle stance if you're going for a SS+WW). It will help you generate some extra juice at the beginning of the pull. Obviously save it if there is a mob in the pack that can fear.
---
Found the fury warrior.
---
Gear certainly makes the fight shorter, but it can be done as a fresh 60. Also lvl 55 mage water helps a lot as well!
---
&gt;These need to take in to account human-like patterns of clicking/spacebar/ability presses, the duration of these presses, and the longevity of the random input cycle.
---
Yeah, for example, Blizzard can look at the delay between your button presses. If they see you are pressing your "1" key exactly every 0.25 seconds, over and over again, always 0.25 seconds, that is pretty obviously a bot.
---
Well I think it implies that anyone can get the ban lifted if they just keep calling until they reach a sympathetic or just exhausted call center employee.  These people speak pidgin English and don't work for Blizzard.  If they remove someone's ban it doesn't mean they were innocent.
---
True, but also probably lost just as much in the big picture revenue by pulling the stunt he did.
---
We aren't discussing prior success, were talking consequences for shit behavior. (Karma) Dude lost alot of revenue and sponsors by being a prick.
---
Can anyone tell me more about the Dawnbringer Shoulders? 
---
Wowhead lists them as Holy Pally P2 pre-bis. Crafted from a world drop recipe. However I can’t get any confirmation they’re actually in the game on my server or even any other server. 
---
Even if it’s a rare recipe, surely it would have dropped somewhere if it’s at all possible.
---
Cut your fingernails kid you greasy slimeball, you should have used your ban time to take a shower.
---
Which is why I did go to Blizzard, I ticketed and had it over turned when looked at by a person. I didn’t post to reddit but I did come looking to see if mine was isolated or others had been falsely hit too. Which they had. Of all the posts about bans yesterday, literally all posted today saying over turned. 
---
Either a lot of false bans issued, or, the guilty stayed quiet and the innocent spoke up.
---
I'm Deep Prot currently :D
---
People always welcome to break/ignore the loot rules if they're just desperate for a run.   As long as it's made clear from the beginning that somebody is going to roll against other players for their MS items, even though the person rolling only needs it for OS, then that's okay.   It just means that the tank is being a bit of a bully, and not dedicating themselves to actually being a tank.
---
What tanks shouldn't do:  Be completely silent and then ninja DPS loot without saying anything prior.
---
Blizzard 15 years ago and Blizzard today are completely different.  This isn't vanilla WoW.  Just because something happened in vanilla doesn't mean that it applies to classic.
---

There is no way they will only give us 1 classic reset, when time comes we will probably get tbc for the ones who want that, and fresh for the rest of us.
---
IF blizzard wont provide fresh classic all the autists will go back to private again, I know I will.
---
And blizzard wouldnt risk that again, I believe classic will keep resetting til the end of time since alot of people will never run out of love for it.
---
Cat is perfectly fine. Continue with it. 
---
Wolfs not worth, because Howl cost 60 focus.
---
&gt;And she is having trouble staying a live  
---
Is her pet die a lot? Remember, pet will always lag behind levels of hunter.  
---
So if you are attacking mob that orange to you, it will be red for pet. Hunter need to be extremely careful about this.  
---
I remember pulling two level 31 mobs as level 30 hunter with 29 pet and killing both of them, while my cat was left with 10% hp. 
---
You could even kill three, if you pull third to yourself with Aspect of the Monkey and tank a bit.  
---
In general - if hunt is dying before his pet, it means that either pet could not keep aggro (and hunter just need to slow down a bit) or hunter is pulling too much.
---
Funny...I’ve tanked everything through AQ 40 / beginning Naxx on my Paladin in Vanilla so...
---
&gt;Sure, reddit has established them as a meme spec
---
Not reddit, they are just shite in pve for basically everything but the debuff right now. A good shadow who gets most of the last hits might be able to compete but I still doubt that the Regen keeps up with them.
---
I loved tanking as I leveled up but when I got to level 60 I really started to dislike tanking for pugs. People expect you to know how to lead dungeons you might not have done for a long while. If you lose aggro or wipe you will be blamed. Mistakes when you're dps are not as noticed but if you make a mistake tanking you're in the spotlight. I started to feel like I don't want to tank anymore until I started doing it with my guild. Now I tank for raids and I love it again.
---
So you farm Mara instead of zf or dm e?
---
It's dropped every time I've killed him, that % is based off people who already finished the quest. Just rub LBRS again and make sure you actually loot him
---
I agree, they should be able to tame those fucking bees and shit in sillithis, and un goro.
---
LOVE IS REAL
---
its insane as a trinket, wouldn't use it as a weapon.
---
I’m about to ding 55 and I’m getting mixed suggestions on how to tackle the last 5 levels in dungeon. 
---
Does anyone have a progression of what level and what parts of dungeons to do? I know BRD especially has multiple areas and same with Strathome.
---
No problem! Hopefully this will be sorted out for you all quickly and you'll have your Guild Master back :)
---
The black rock papers are not a drop. They randomly spawn in one of 4 places each run. 3 of those are right next to the bosses in the quest.
---
no, because nobody gives a shit if someone was unbanned, and so far today 90% of posts are people coming to this reddit with a righteous fury.
---
So which one would bring more benefits? LHH or Edgemaster? I know both would be BiS for long time. I thought increasing weaponskills is the most DPS increase. That's why I prioritized edgmaster over LHH
---
Another note on Boars..... they eat EVERYTHING including mage bread
---
Yeah, youre a great example lol. Umad that i wasnt botting and got my ban overturned? 
---
U sound mad. Otherwise why post at all?
---
"The only winning move is not to play." - WOPR
---
You can just not do AV if it's not fun.
---
What you are trying to say is that you will do a fraction if a mages or locks damage in a dungeon because you'll just sit there most of the dungeon drinking.
---
Have you stopped playing since classic came out?
---
&gt; By that logic hybrid classes should pass all gear unless they have pidgeon-holed themselves into just one role for 100% of the time.
---
Every non-hybrid is "pigeonholed" into just one type.
---
Being a hybrid doesn't mean that you're entitled to 3 sets of gear.   It means that you have **3 options to pick from**.   You have the luxury of deciding which will be you main spec, and you should commit yourself to that main spec and respect the fact that other people need loot for their main specs -- to other people, loot isn't used "sometimes", it's used 100% of the time.
---
As a once raiding shadow priest I think I understand why druid tanking is miserable...
---
It's not that there's *no* gear adequate for the job, it's that there's so few options for each slot it becomes extremely annoying to wait for the *one* thing that can do the job. And then when it finally drops another class will be bitching their *ass* off because the standard class roles suggest it should have been for them. Rogues bitch at feral druids, mages bitch at shadow priests, etc.
---
It's really not fun when your BiS item - really the only great item, in fact - in a slot for *all of Vanilla* comes off a world boss or off an early boss in BWL but then it just never drops or you have to fight people with have many other options to get it.
---
I do yeah... great benefits
---
Use Blackhand's in one slot, HoJ in the other.
---
27 Scottish nerd calling people boomers that are in fact his same age. I can quit playing a game and still hang around the sub to see all the drama ensue and stir the pot. Dont take it so personally
---
Absolutely not.
---
MS before OS is the standard, period.
---
If you want to break that obvious rule, then you need to say something.
---
&gt;have a 96.2 parse average
---
So you are at the top end of a shit spec
---
&gt;I beat most mages and warlocks I come across, handily.
---
Playing with a lot of very bad people.
---
cows are the worst
---
they've got a good reputation for some reason but some of the biggest arseholes about are taurens
---
anxiety of doing poorly and or not knowing where to go. People that are cruel have turned me off of that role.
---
i'm a people please so healing fits well....until someone dies.
---
Look at his hands of course he’s twelve and those fingernails though.. yuck. Should have used your ban time to take a shower.
---
He gets everything out of posting this if he actually cheated and gets his ban lifted due to public outcry.  The problem is, he's missing the public outcry part of that.  I think it's more likely he got caught doing something he shouldn't have and is hoping posting in a public forum gets his ban lifted.
---
You will do about 10% less dmg without edgemasters I think. Sure you could but why would you.
---
Not bannable though. It just gets you removed from the bg. Also, things like fishing/doing bg quests are not afk either.
---
Rogues would be out of this fucking planet in pvp and especially pve
---
The bye Felicia. Lol, I fail to see your point, but know you've failed to see mine.
---
The less mods the better.  Stop over-regulating this place.  There was a point a few months ago where it was fcking ridiculous.   
---
If you don’t like a thread, don’t read it.
---
“Hey give me things because I’m playing too”
---
This is 40 against 40. This isn’t an unbalanced server.
---
Stop your bitching and get good. Or quit. Doesn’t matter to be either way.
---
Strat, Scholo, UBRS and DMW/N are all going to be 58+ dungeons.  Likely 60 unless you have guildies to run with you (people often only want 60s for these, so can be tough to get in).
---
BRD Prison/Arena runs - 52+
---
BRD Arena/Anger runs - 53+
---
BRD Bar Runs - 54+
---
BRD Full Runs (or Lava Skip) 56+
---
I never claimed it was... i think you are reading far too much in to my one tiny sentence.
---
Thank you! We need more people like you in the dungeon groups.
---
Yes, but multiplicatively for 36.25% stun resistance.
---
It's my fault for caring about 3 random people, sure. Anyway, if you're going to blame me for acting in the best interest of the group then I'd say your username is fitting.
---
WOW. Sounds like BLIZZARD can't handle FACTS and REASON.
---
This language is OFFENSIVE and DEROGATORY to GAMERS.
---
UNSUBBED. Going to play GUILD WARS now. Good LUCK, MANLETS.
---
Do you know what the word "pervasive" means?
---
Repeat offenders. Guy probably tried it once or ran the program and didn’t use it more than to test or something.
---
Even with 305 wep skill ?
---
Math is math
---
You know what sucks?  You can see “screen captured” in the screenshot.  That’s so lame.
---
My favorite non guild tank is a level 60 shaman. He's a beast.
---
D2 is the only game I ever botted in.  We used to have lan parties in a friends basement where we'd boot up 2 or 3 spare computers, and have bots running, while actually playing the game ourselves on our primary computers.  In retrospect, I guess it's no surprise I turned out the way I did lol.  I still remember taking my PC, with 50 lb giant crt monitor, for a car ride to get to his house.  Was so annoying lol.  There was an old computer junkyard/warehouse in my hometown, and in that day it was actually reasonable to go pick up some spare hardware.  Especially the monitors were dirt cheap compared to the retail price.
---
That kinda went out the window when they added the 'Salty' title though.
---
Staff of Jordan - Is this thing any good? Are casters willing to pay for this?
---
Cool, someone found a screenshot or took a picture of a WoW account.
---
Didn't I pug a ony a while back with ya?
---
I also see you death rolling often in orgrimmar.
---
Love from Akino - razergore
---
umm no. go to faerlina / herod / whitemane / fairbanks
---
every other server is garbo
---
Definitely wont let it die, theres just too much money to be made. Most likely TBC, but both seasonal servers or classic+ are also possibilities. I personally would love to to see either TBC &amp;Wrath or classic plus. Seasonal fresh servers dont sound fun to me at all
---
Premades aren’t as strong as they used to be.  Horde can still wipe them.  They just have to turtle harder
---
Did you end up getting banned? Im kinda curious.
---
I play on Windseeker (alliance), which is a PvE server listed as a 'Medium' pop server in-game.
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
It can be a bit slow on weekday mornings and afternoons (I have recently learned this due to time off for the holidays) but other than that - there are always people looking for groups and out in the world. It doesn't feel overcrowded at all. Quest areas aren't picked over - but there are people questing everywhere. It's a nice mix, and a healthy pop. It honestly feels like the population that classic was intended to be played at.  
---
I would think that the other Medium pop servers are the same way. I also see plenty of Horde running around on Windseeker if you are interested in playing there. Hope it helps!
---
I do not see these Qs as long. But I find it interesting how you are dragging this out. Waiting in line?
---
Thanks for the reply! Lobotomizer has no stats which is why I was feeling weird about it, but if it’ll be better than the others I might just have to go for it (already exalted thank god). I’ve heard good things about Finkles too but the stats seem to be lacking - is the speed/damage what’s desirable?
---
Yeah even if u were if u keep escalating it up the chain u can get unbanned. Just keep causing hell and they will unban you
---
I agree with most of this, however, CC can make a pretty huge difference for the tank.
---
The difference between having to tank 3 mobs while the dps go bonkers on all of them (even though you've marked them with a perfectly fine kill order) and 4 mobs where the dps go bonkers on all of them is actually pretty big. Having to worry about 1 mob less means a lot when tanking.
---
I agree it's not really needed because the dungeons are so easy that there's rarely a threat, but it makes it easier to tank.
---
Fury prot, off gear, no shield. burn her.
---
Usually I'm on here trolling and occasionally giving advice, and I don't really have a horse in the bot race, but just wanna say this was pretty informative thanks
---
It’s a 100% drop! You need to complete the pre quest
---
I mean, technically though is pervasive but I dont think blizzard bans shit for being pervasive lol
---
I agree it's thinner and I exagerated. But still, there's a pretty big gap between botting and AFKing as far as punishment goes, even though both actions are indeed quite similar in nature.
---
What's the point of this post?
---
Yeah 1m is widely accepted as the number you need to hit. EU streamers talk about it more than NA, but mo0 said they set their &lt;APES&gt; bracket 1 at 1.6 million so no one can sneak up on them. Now that is Alliance and Horde will definitely need less, so check what Lezonta  and the &lt;Dreamstate&gt; boys are doing.
---
I guess that's a good problem honestly.  When ranking, I'm not worried about the idiots running low level scripts.  I'm worried about the people who have sophisticated bots that can run 24/7 and get away with it.
---
If you actually want to progress your rank, contributing to the BG instead of being dead-weight should be your goal.  AFKing inhibits that and probably makes you play for longer than you need to.
---
Dam we have had like 4 flameguard drops lol
---
¿Qué?
---
It depends on if you want PvP or PvE. PvE servers seem to be a lot more balanced, since players never felt the need to switch servers since there isn’t chronic ganking on PvE. 
---
If you’re looking for a balanced PvP server.. good luck
---
or alternatively bind it to a different mouse button, works great for me!
---
I haven’t done any sort of testing. I’ve also been letting all of my DPS get their Perditions, Bb, corehound, deathbringer, etc.
---
My rage generation feels considerably higher with Ironfoe.
---
Keep in mind I also have edgemasters to use with my QS and I still prefer Ironfoe. But I didnt farm IF on purpose, I got lucky while trying to help guildies clear for the quest ... if i had to actually farm hundreds of BRDs to get Ironfoe, its not worth it. QS + edgemasters is still very good. Throw a Mirahs Song in off hand with it.
---
Sorry, implying is not the right word. That is what your sentence means when taken literally, no inferences being made
---
Still though, it's completely and wholly irrelevant to OP's point, and the fact that you're deflecting from this tells me you finally wised up and realized it
---
On reddit*
---
It is great. Your shaman (if playing horde) should give you windfury aswell. hoj can proc wf and vice versa.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sspvp3 or ddons/battlegroundtargets-classic?
---
I think Aurastone if you're poor, Edward if you're rich. Because we have no real escape methods, we constantly have warriors and rogues sitting on us. Getting instant cast procs would  be incredible since we have to hard cast basically everything.  I've heard it procs enough to definitely be worth it, but I can't afford one to try it out.
---
Gross
---
Cut your fingernails, that shit is gross.
---
I have the same expectations tbh (or almost at least). I think it's just something that has happened naturally as the game has gotten older, and people have found themselves in these roles.
---
A friend of mine hasn't played WoW in over five years (which can be confirmed via his account management page) yet just recieved a ban for botting somehow.
---
^(The above sentence is a complete lie, but you can be damn sure at least five legit botters are going to claim this to try and milk Reddit karma)
---
False. R10 shoulders + R8 Pants &gt; Anything in BWL for fury warriors.
---
They are only BiS for MC (61+) mobs and does absolutely nothing outside that. So edgemasters are not relevant in a post about tanking 5 mans
---
It is sort of important to be able to grab the mine and do the quest there without being booted. It's part of AV. 
---
And we \*did\* have an afk out option from retail, but it was horribly abused to punish people disagreeing on tactics or not part of premades.
---
just an exaggeration.
---
yea it’s really fucking good for leveling, can really be used up until 60 for sure. on my server it fetches around 250-400g, ymmv
---
Lol just watch some of the APES guys stream, they get caps of 1.6m while streaming all of it.
---
&gt; This might be controversial but I personally don't think good farming bots do that much damage to the community.
---
Dreamfoil on my server was getting up to close to 20 g a stack.  It's how I paid for my epic mount, being full resto at the time.  Now we have a dude that consistently puts up stacks at 12 g, ignoring any other pricing higher or lower.  He always has stock.  I think it's fair to speculate that this person is probably using a bot to farm these herbs.  Now my profit goes down, because my 2nd profession is engineering.  So essentially, I need to level another character to continue to farm well.  I'd call that a fair amount of damage to the community. 
---
That's just 1 example that's applicable to me.  There's a lot more.
---
This is perfect thanks! Basically looks like BRD for me then for a bit. Would you recommend any questing zones?
---
You’re not playing runescape??😂😂😂
---
/s
---
I’m a healer, the way I heal p2 is by assisting ony. Not only do I see who she targets, but I see the damage they take.
---
Major mana pot, dark or demonic tune, life tap depending on length of fight, timing a death coil and sburn at the very end
---
honestly with those prices, you should just buy up everything and transfer to herod, make it rain
---
I did loot him man
---
Wait, guilds do that?
---
On garr/sulfaron/domo I just take all adds on me with my force reactive disk, its fun as fuck!
---
Can't you get banned for account sharing?
---
Most of the time when people need to clarify that they're not doing something it's because they're doing that exact thing.
---
Why would it be reckless and stupid to give the enhancement shaman the eye?
---
How ya being an ally on Stalagg? Just curious.
---
Shadowburn is worth casting at the end of the fight if you don’t have time for anything else
---
i know that, but blizz higher ups will never understand that. they think if they just make retail better we'll flock to it, so they keep changing things, some good, some bad
---
No I wouldn't. Every class wanting random af gear pieces was one of the things I was most aware of going into the game back in august. I EXPECT classes to roll on gear that's good for their class, regardless of armor type. Also, if a dps decides to heal a dungeon because they wouldn't get a group otherwise they can roll on dps gear. I don't really see how people have issues with this? If you do, find a guild that will funnel all the gear to you so you can get your way.
---
This.  I’ve seen many call for bans for fishing, capping mines, and defense of towers.  Not everyone wants a 5 minute AV and people can’t be banned for not doing things you want them to do.
---
The problem is that neither Wine or Wow really works on ARM.
---
Yeah you’ll be just fine with any population server you pick. Servers are BLOATED and none of them are going away anytime soon. 
---
The thing to be aware of is the alliance horde ratio.
---
&gt; The concept of MS/OS is bad in dungeons in the first place is the point though. Druids and warriors are the best example of this, but they often try and join a run as one role, only to get forced to be a tank or a healer to get the run going.
---
Listen, telling people "I'll play my OS for this run, but only if you let me roll on my MS gear" is totally valid.  If everyone agrees to that, then more power to you.
---
But what you can't/shouldn't do:  Roll on 3 sets of gear just because you're a hybrid.  Being a hybrid means that you have more options for picking a main spec, it doesn't mean that you should be stealing all the loot in the game from players who need it for the main/only spec.
---
You want to get banned right?
---
One argument is rogues can get upgrades on every other slot due to their class sets, therefore weapons should first go to warriors.
---
I'd love to level my warrior if/when I get around to it. Sadly the low lvl dungeon scene is pretty dead right now so it'd be even more painful. Maybe people will be focused more on alts during phase 4...
---
Is this rattlegore
---
Did somebody else loot the papers. Pretty sure he only drops one for the entire party.
---
"You want to be rewarded for doing your role? Don't play tank then!" 
---
I have gotten flamed a shit ton on this subreddit with that exact reasoning over and over
---
also if you have to reposition
---
Behold edges....it is your lord.
---
You can take a look at Old Blanchy. PVE NA west coast server. Enough population to fill groups but not enough where competition is crazy. Most people have at least one 60 toon but are making alts at this point so lots of people working up the levels again. Pretty even between horde and alliance. Not a whole lot of drama between guilds and in general people just get along and have fun playing together :) If I was you I would stay away from pvp servers unless your okay with dying a lot. Its going to take a you a lot longer to get up in levels if your constantly dying mid-quest.
---
I have no dog in this circus. But reading through the comments, it seems like you're a bit excited. If you've been drinking, probably best to stay off social media...hic!
---
Sure, here's my whole WA setup, you can just pull the swing timer out if you want.
---
 https://wago.io/alGqNh1Pf
---
What's your gear looking like?
---
With Death Coil, Grenades, CoExhaustion kiting, Healthstone, Spellstone, Engi Net, etc., you still are getting killed in 10 seconds?
---
While you have dots up,  try spamming Searing Pain to ramp up the damage. If they interrupt that - perfect - use the opportunity to cast a free Fear or Drain Life.
---
Lock DoT damage seems to melt through people from what I've seen. Are you good in the spellpowe department?
---
Also people who casually raid log. It's not hard, I cleared 10 bosses back then with a super bad guild. Not a single naxx boss has complicated mechanics. Just don't try to pretend / expect naxx to be hard - it's not.
---
Yeah its ALT F4
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Youtube PVP guides, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids in Hillsbrad Foothills, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top stream sniper in the entire US Faeralina Realm. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of discord spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my unarmed skill. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal ADHD medication and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. Lok’tar ogar.
---
the hands are perfect
---
As long as you aren't a dire maul farming hunter or a mage, this is probably the best gph right now. If not, you're losing about 2 gold per hour as a mage (idk how much tribute makes you as a hunter) assuming you're farming zf optimally.
---
Overall this is a pretty good deal, esp if you're a warrior or something that has trouble grinding
---
My friend got a perma ban for RMT last year. He appealed the ticket. It was closed and they said they would no longer look into the issue. I know this friend extremely well and he also barely even plays anymore. I know this is 100% not something he did. He had to call customer service a few times before they would finally look into it and then they overturned it in 30 minutes.
---
Blizzard is wholly incompetent when handing out bans these days and I don't get how people have so much faith in them.
---
Well, you should use both,
---
but if for some reason you need to choose one (like you need to use Rune of the Guard Captain to stay hit capped) You should use HoJ. An extra attack is more valuable than a crit and the % chance is the same between both items. Also, because Sunder Armor can proc the extra attack but can't crit it's has a hidden higher % chance to proc than the straight crit from BB even thought they are both 2%.
---
What was your reasoning for the CTS prio to rogues?
---
I disagree. WoW hackers even as far back as BC would often try to change login info and make the account inaccessible. And they sometimes do malicious things while on your account. 
---
I ninjaed a guild bank in BC (dick thing to do, I know), and less than 3 hours after I logged for the night someone accessed my account sold absolutely everything I was wearing and in my bank. Then sent everything else via mail. They also disbanded the new guild I had formed and deleted one of my other characters altogether. I know it wasnt an inside job because I never used the shared info with others out of paranoia. 
---
I think it just depends on who is at the helm.
---
This is a good habit to get into early.
---
I love this. Thanks for sharing!
---
I started playing Classic wanting to tank. I did my research and did a pretty good job for someone that hasn't played the game in almost 10 years. Now I never tank and almost always refuse to. You pretty well summed up why in your post. I'll tank for my IRL friends only, other than that no way. The whole party expects the tank to carry them. All responsibility falls on the tank. Tanks are expected to know every single inch of every dungeon. They are expected to know every quest in every dungeon. They are expected to pace things just right for everyone else. If you aren't a hardcore player with years of knowledge and experience, tanking will not be fun for you.
---
Again, established by whom? There is no governing body that determines "standard" loot rules for the entirety of WoW. It burns *my* soul that you can't seem to see outside of your own personal experience. There's a whole world out there you know
---
I do the same brother.
---
Everybody in this thread is expecting the hybrid class players to stfu, perform a role that benefits the group, and reap no rewards. They don't understand that I'm only healing or tanking because it would take 10 times longer to find a group as a dps since every class can do damage.
---
Two reasons;  
---
Firstly, classic is the first time i've played WoW, and i rolled warrior. Not only am i retarded knowledge wise, I also just didn't understand what the fuck threat is for a while seeing as the game doesn't really teach it. By the time i hit 60 i was tanking strat/schol/ubrs, but i wanted to actually learn the dungeons and unique mechanics and shit without the stress of tanking and fucking it up.  
---
Now that I'm leveling my second warrior, i have a friend who is a priest. Tanking dungeons in comms with a healer is the equivelant of playing bot lane duo on LoL vs playing bot lane by yourself with a random support. It makes me want to slowly cut my dick off playing with a random healer who doesn't just littlerally right click follow me and perma heal, it makes dungeons take twice as long honestly.  
---
TLDR; No experience on game/not knowing what threat is/how to tank, and playing with random priests who are playing the most braindead role in the game but struggle to do it at a basic level.
---
He ninjad an item, talked shit openly about it, and lost money and a big sponsorship.
---
Damn dude, playing skeptic while having no clue? Lol
---
Yeah stuff like that mightve been on cooldown aswell, you never know
---
Fury Shill!!!
---
Do hunter pets have any particular benefit from eating food that's a higher level to them? I know the tooltip says "closer to the pet's level" but was wondering if that worked both ways. (Had been feeding my 34 pet 35 food)
---
On the flip side, as someone completely new to wow, I rolled rogue first and absolutely hated it. Got it to 60, did 1 raid and rerolled to hunter and haven't logged into the rogue since. Now my hunter is 60 and it's so much more fun for me.
---
Yeah honestly I think it might be, slightly inc crit and dodge is cool but if I’m doing quite a bit more DPS it seems to me that would be better from a TPS standpoint. Thanks for all the insight, and no worries, I’ll try asking the fight club guys, they seem to be experts on everything warrior.
---
amen
---
Ok I did some research. Non bosses only have a 3-4% chance of dropping key so I’m not sure whether it’s worth it to kill that first ogre each run. Even bosses only have about a 13% chance to drop.  However there is a mob called the Gordok Bushwalker who spawns after you loot ogre tannin and patrols the platform the tannin is on. He has a 25% chance to drop key but I don’t know how you would loot the tannin before finishing the dungeon and having ogres deaggro.
---
Foreal? Ive heard the chance on hit is so OP that its better than most.. this have given me alot of clearity cant wait to test next raid
---
This is the top answer imo
---
You should be able to get most of everything back. When I got hacked in BC, Blizz just mailed me back everything that was deleted or sold and my gold.
---
HoJ is BiS on warrior. Period. Spec doesn’t matter. If you’ve got it, you should basically never take it off.
---
(I don’t know much about later phases and if/when sometimes comparable could come along, but I know it’s true now and will probably hold for awhile)
---
lol called it
---
&gt;	How fragile is your ego?
---
I think you’re projecting bud. You’re bitching that the system is bad and other games have it right. Cool, those games aren’t 15 years old. WoW came out when those games didn’t even exist, yet your bitching blizz doesn’t have a better system. What part are you missing in all of this?
---
Priest looked fun to me as an alt but by level 25 I was almost dreading loging on to play. Once my rested xp maxed out I realized I didn't care and made her my bank alt.
---
their justification for not allowing 60%'s.. I've got my epic mount, but this sentence just made me laugh xD 'oh the little people don't understand.. we're doing them a favor by excluding them from our fun!'
---
Its not bad overall, but the music choice is pretty weak. And some of the editing seems a bit overdone. Its like you take away from the pvp combat.
---
Pretty much everyone uses them for solo runs because killing the last boss is never really worth it time wise.
---
Lol almost commented something similar
---
I played a Paladin to complement my IRL friends group. I thought that I would eventually switch my warrior alt or one of my other alts to be my main. I freaking love pally. So fun! I love the RP. I love the flexibility. I love the guaranteed raid spot for being holy. Paladin is a blast!
---
The game came out 5 months ago not 15 years and the conciously chose to implement the same system even though we know now it sucks.  What part are you missing in all this?
---
Seriously one of the best-edited PvP videos I have ever seen, great plays too.
---
I mean this with respect to the above, but the music is so bad man. I can't watch this with anyone around without explaining to them that I have no choice.
---
A lot of raiders want r13/r14 just for raiding...
---
Ok buddy. Whatever you say
---
Or a day...
---
I agree, and that's what I hope to achieve with this post (even though I doubt it as I've said a few times, lol).
---
Please people FOR THE LOVE OF GOD help the poor souls who are still tanking dungeons. Don't piss on them by not caring about threat and playing with your head up your arse. Be nice and give the tank a good experience and he'll keep doing dungeons which benefits us all.
---
Hey look, another thing /r/classicwow was wrong about.
---
I did DM:E jump runs as disc with a mage. We clear the whole instance in under 30 minutes. It's decent gold (~50gph each).
---
Spudz, Dwarf Rogue.
---
I really hated playing shaman outside of anything but 5 man's. Totem management was just annoying, healing raids was a snooze, PvP felt more formulaic than other classes. Only fun part was the burst AoE I could put out in 5 man groups. I could see someone enjoying shaman, but it wasn't at all for me.
---
I've since rerolled paladin which has its own issue, but at the very least raid healing on a paladin I find much more enjoyable, and considering I mostly raid log, that's what matters to me. Next alt is gunna be Warlock which I think I'll enjoy a lot.
---
What do you get out of mara, oozes, and stone guardians?
---
You're not in full raid purples then.  My repairs are well over 1g per death.
---
I do my best!
---
The answers in this thread are ALL over the place. 
---
From everything I have gathered from wowhead, the quest item (that starts the quest to get Blackhand's Breadth) should drop from the last boss in LBRS. That will lead to you having to go to UBRS and kill Drakkisath.  
---
I don't know why people are in here talking about Onyxia attunement.
---
I fish nightfin in AV.  Don’t @ me
---
Ret pally, feral druid.
---
Right side drink all the whiskey left sideee drink all the vodkaa.. strart to abuse alcohol slowlyyyyyyy... now drink it like u mean it.. you didnt get to the bottom?!! THATS A 50 DKP MINUS
---
Dwarf potato you mean. I like it congrats :)
---
I'm not 60 yet but I do have a guild and they don't mind off-meta classes. Everything brings something to the table
---
Op literally titled the post "classic wow RUNNING on switch" implying it was directly being played from the switch. Not "classic wow streamed to switch"
---
It is not from the ony attune, at least not for alliance. 
---
Source: am attuned to ony, need to get this trinket
---
i mean people do have alts too you know. so not very easy to get exalted on 2 toons in the first 3 days where it was easy af. rogue is already exalted now I'm trying my mage but God is it slow.
---
Can I delete my argent dawn commission trinket if I just completed the quest and received the OTHER argent dawn trinket with the attack power buff against undead?
---
Some one give this guy a gold medal for mental gymnastics.
---
Something that will send you to a concentration camp.
---
personally - even on phase 2 - I was fine. My guild stuck together when venturing outside, was still able to farm mats and have small 5man pvp gang. So I didn't suffer that badly in p2. Raid Nights - never lost our world buffs. 
---
Currently - getting sad since more alliance are leaving or planning to leave by end of Jan. I still have easy time in the world but the economy is getting worse unfortunately. 
---
my mind is baffle, why people left the server once BG opened up. Things got better and smoother. There was no real reason to leave, but a big exodus occurred and not the economy is getting fucked this time around.
---
Bunch of fucking pro-heartseekers cowards I say! May Shame come to all those "alliance" snowflakes who left.
---
It’s that band you listen to while cast frost bolts at Rag
---
Had to reflect my playstyle somehow!
---
This is really interesting. I've never considered warlocks able to tank dungeons before.
---
I do have a question though. From what I can read you need pretty good gear to be able to tank efficiently (like 3 pieces of t1 as you write), but doesn't that mean that your gear is already so good that you don't need anything from normal dungeons? What is the incentive to tank?
---
There must be a difference for allies then. We have to kill General Drakkisath in UBRS after we get the quest starting item from last guy in LBRS.
---
For Horde, it’s reward for the first half (not even) of the Ony chain. It’s given after you do the quest to kill Rend and turn his head back in (which will result in Thrall giving everyone in Org the Warchiefs Blessing buff if Rends head isn’t up).
---
Fair enough.

Currently leveling a warrior, level 45 at the moment and grinding quests and REALLLLLY starting to get to me seeing as it's literally all i've done so far. I want to make 45-54 or so as quick as possible before i end my life. Any tips on good training places 45-52 or so? 52-54 I love ungoro crater, i remember leveling there on my first warrior and it was very very quick, places like tanaris/SV i just get killed/corpse camped near any quest shit so I'm struggling a bit ;p
---
Is it the new copypasta? Idk
---
Since there is no gbank facility in classic I would imagine there is more leeway regarding the account sharing violation that occurred here.
---
The solution would be to implement some qol improvements to the game such as the guild bank.
---
Pretty much yes. The stats might be low, but the damage and speed are good. The Lobo has the best damage you can get outside of raids. More damage means more rage!
---
I am in full t1 or using t2 pants head... At most I get up to 75s
---
Collusion with opposite faction isn't?
---
Only blizzard knows what their confusion matrix looks like.  You’re just making shit up.
---
Yes. There's no reason to keep it once you get the better trinket. If you ever want the original trinket back for some reason, there's an NPC you can ask to give you a new one any time.
---
Warrior - shoulders, pants, boots. Mage - boots. Warlock - arguably shoulders.
---
Oh awesome thank you !
---
You got me!!!
---
You're either lying or not paying attention to your repair cost
---
The fight is fucking awfully programmed, just spam him with damage and run aggro to north until tank gets it 
---
If you have good damage the pain woman’s torture will be like 3 mins
---
queue time has nothing to do with one specific server
---
I think if you think that you havent actually played one to its leveling potential. You are tanking in cloth like a mage only have little to no movement impairing effects. If you need to fear in a bind you need to still be ready to knock the fear back off since it might run towards everything else. While still taking slaps from other mobs
---
Take a screen shot and prove it, because you are simply wrong...
---
This kind of situation is happening a lot now. Games starting with \~25 is when one premade group ditches the game, but I've seen  these really small games more often, I assume because there are way less games now. This is when multiple premades both queue into the same game and ditch.
---
lol I get SSI cuz I'm disabled dude
---
Well I heard the economy is jacked up... seriously make a lvl 1 alt on benediction, etc. and run to the AH and compare. It's sad, which is why I asked.
---
Bad bot.
---
My point is captcha has been broken for a long time. If a GM were to present a bot with a captcha, I'm sure bot writers would be quick to integrate into a service that solves them.
---
Get a new guild since yours is clearly full of shitty people
---
Yeah I’d rather get gear than get drunk and countdown from 10 at 11:59
---
This is excellent advice. Thank you!
---
I will edit it into the original post.
---
I was also unbanned, grats OP and others
---
What was the ban for?
---
I was really surprised to see how many prot paladins gave their 2 cents about this. 
---
Of course they can, your side only though.
---
You get 1 crit and 102 ranged attack power from 52 Agility. 
---
YOU NEED TO DO YOUR REASEARCH. 
---
YOUR CAREER IS ENDED FUCKTARD
---
It’s your best threat trinket
---
Alliance don’t bother with Rattlegore, head for open waters young and old fish alike.
---
Sure, but we aren't taking about a classes max potential, we're talking about easiest to level for a beginner. 
---
Locks are an extremely safe choice for beginners.
---
Yeah a good thing. Look at how much complaining we have of bots not getting banned. Its either automatic or nothing gets done is where the gaming industry is at.
---
Wowpedia and the vanilla wiki both list it as being a moonwell.
---
It doesn’t, and AFAIK you there’s always a chance for resist. Range/LoS is the best tool to minimize Feign Death fails and being considerate of what you can do post fail.
---
I do play on grob too and am familiar with those players. Yes I do see them av occasionally. But I see a lot of off server players having bad manners. Example. I had a great 1v1 vs a paladin, texashammer I think his name was. We had a good fight but 3 more alliance rolled in last second and I died. Texashammer then /spit on me 50 times. I thought we had a good fight but he had no honor or respect. Made me want to find him outside of the bg, but sadly I cannot. I feel people will act this way because they dont expect to ever see this person again. That is the retail mentality.
---
Boy needs to trim his nails too
---
Tough luck, everyone deals with this shit, some have it worse.
---
I used to tank a ton, now there's a shortage of healers on my server. I was happy to run any high lvl 5 man just to make gold and have fun but now groups can't find healers for over 30 mins, so I'm leveling a hunter alt so I can just solo tribute instead
---
I don’t agree at all. LET THEM POST. Let us feed on botter tears!
---
Pretty sure that was Jokerd with a staff of dominance
---
Find your servers discord for starters, they usually have a recruitment section. My server also has a subreddit for recruitment. You could also look at logs and sort by server/faction and see where you'd fit in (are you min maxxing pushing absalute monster numbers? Are you semi casual and just wanna clear content with speed not a factor?) and hit up some guilds in-game. Ask for an officers name or the GM and go from there. 
---
The good thing with starting now is that guilds usually have spots open as people have burnt out. Guilds who have been raiding since week 3 would almost have their members in full tier sets so you'd potencially gear up decently quick.
---
This post was broght you by the should have rolled on a PVE serveur crew.
---
Excuse me, but do accounts still receive a pet for enabling authentication?
---
That's not how that works it's 10% not 10 dura loss. Belt of might for instance has 55dura meaning 5.5 with your formula that's 9.2s for repair but if you are r3 and honored you get 20% off. So you pay 7.4s.
---
So if I do my math on the edge case just like you did 7.4x10 is 74s. Which includes all t1 and weapons.
---
All classes ive leveled to 60 or a few levels off.
---
Leveled a warrior to tank for my homies. Man that was a mistake. Feels super clunky and frustrating to play.
---
Druid tank has been alot smoother and just cruisy. Healing is mindless whack-a-mole which is a nice break. So the druid has been a tonne of fun. 
---
Rogue is great fun. But without a decent guild I find myself sitting around waiting for stuff to do. 
---
Currently leveling a mage alt to try out aoe farming looks like it will be an interesting skill to learn. Zf soloing at 44 just sounds awesome.
---
My friends name was changed... it was Intercourse. 
---
IF YOU LOOK IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY ITS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE
---
Shut the fuck up no one is acting surprised that the server is dying alliance side. You just sound like a salty alliance that is mad that he got killed too many times in pvp. Btw horde can switch too it's not like we're stuck here.
---
I got my same name, and did my same exact character model again. Then at about lvl 20 I remembered I hated red hair and always wished I had picked grey. Fool me twice, right?
---
I don't see what's wrong with someone stacking their dkp for one item. Seems like it's their choice to forgo the other upgrades because they want that one. I don't think it's the best idea but they should have the freedom to choose. I agree that if you are a casual player you should definitely find a guild that is more in sync with your play style. Like one that doesn't use decay lol
---
It provides a stealth bonus to rogues and cat druids
---
You're right, I will change the wording to "Tanking can be a very unenjoyable experience" :)
---
Also, I hope the thing with the cats being on fire is just made up haha :P
---
Thanks for the inputs man. Have a happy new year!
---
Tanks for a group of mid 50s to emperor, I only needed the tank trinket. I didn’t ask for Master Loot this time, but learned my lesson slogged through 3 hours to get this group to the end and I get paid with a ninja of the tank trinket I needed.  Who was to blame? Me, and now I just master loot.  I made the mistake of wasting my time for nothing too many times, and when it goes wrong all I had to blame was me for not taking the precautions.
---
I don’t tank for free anymore and it’s been great.  I don’t always get the item I need but I haven’t been jacked since.
---
Shadowmeld increases your 'stealth level' making it harder for you to be detected. It also gives you a secondary way to 'restealth', in the event stealth is on cooldown but you're out of combat.
---
It really depends on what your 'goal' is for your Rogue, since you picked Dwarf I'm assuming more PvP focused.
---
Human rogues have the best racials for pve, gnomes for pvp. Night elves are slightly harder to detect on stealth because of shadowmeld
---
Did this for like whole 2 3 weeks since launch, my account was allways on 24/7 , and my friends also  did this, to get ahead of the zerg.
---
Server discord or subreddit.
---
I think fresh has an allure due to people wanting to do things better than last time. 
---
Problem is they most likely will end up doing the same as they did before.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Excellent reply.
---
I don’t know how to tell you this bud, but Blizz ain’t doing that. He’s just mad his circlejerk got ruined and he wants to make ya feel bad.
---
Glad you got it back, though. I was skeptical of the reddit posts yesterday until one of my guildies got hit. His was overturned in like 12 hours.
---
all i see is people talking about posts of people getting banned but i see no posts of people getting banned...might be reddit hides them from me idk
---
He’s saying that because, historically, folks that come here with stories like yours, are lying. 
---
This is usually confirmed by Blizz CS themselves, in the thread.
---
So. His cynicism is based on precedent. 
---
Iirc there’s a blizzard CS rep name /u/Araxom that usually helps in these situations. If you contact them, and legitimately did nothing wrong, they’ll help.
---
Wat
---
Congrats man. Still waiting to get unbanned but seeing posts like this has me faithful that it'll happen. Really unfortunate timing since I have a light workload today/tomorrow with the holiday and was hoping to get some playtime in.
---
I've been really dissatisfied with customer support from Blizzard and their "guilty until proven innocent" tact. I really wish I knew what made me get flagged for botting so I can avoid doing it in the future.
---
Says the guy who thinks you shouldn’t have more than 2 tanks. 🙄
---
That's incredible, the first time doing that run is quite a fond memory of this game.
---
That’s depressing
---
it gives you an bonus to your stealth (harder to detect like the talent) and i like it because stealth has a 10 second cooldown.
---
i often use it to restealth when gathering for instance. and shadowmeld -&gt; stealth doesn't break stealth.
---
U r rattlegore
---
I was being facetious. The guy I was responding to thinks you shouldn’t have more than 2 tanks max.
---
Just say you will need on different role gear when you join, it really not harder than that to avoid loot drama. This is not rocket science you know...
---
I can understand the frustration with bots, I just got my third char to 60, a priest, and hinterlands was riddled with human rogues botting. I figured I should do my part to help the server and just started mind controlling them into more mobs than they could handle and repeated till they had red gear. Reporting the bots wasn’t working, so I decided to break them. 
---
Upon getting a ban for botting it felt very ironic.
---
If you can guarantee openers will when vs blind removal every single time.
---
So does FD fail more often when the target is closer?
---
ok
---
“Jiggaboo” is a racial slur
---
Darn, that's unfortunate. I know people who really need to get disability who have been trying for years and still haven't gotten it.. :\  
---
May I ask what your disability is? Don't feel obligated to answer, I'm sorry if that's too personal.
---
Personally I'd go with a swarm of thermonuclear warheads.
---
If you are not an engineer ungoro crystals offer a lesser sapper charge. I recommend any non engineer to get them.
---
Meanwhile on Netherwind the Horde refuses to communicate with each other at all. Every Ony head is a total surprise.
---
Like convincing people not to kill the prospector?  And what happens if they do, do you alt-f4 or would you like to know how to pull him alone regardless of the prospector?
---
https://youtu.be/SLMig9fTx6Y?t=65
---
PvE mage (in raids)... not fun, whether or not that is surprising is subjective.  To me, it's surprising I guess.
---
Not sure what I was expecting, but spamming one button on one target for however long a fight lasts, and just hoping for some crits but otherwise seeing essentially the same number over and over is pretty boring.  After two MC's I was dead bored.
---
People aren't getting that. They are getting rep for things like don julios
---
Dude.....be quiet and take a hint.
---
I'm dead!
---
Healing dungeons was fun, yes. But with my schedule I rarely had a consistent time to sit down and play. it would be like on and off for 3 hours throughout the evening.  
---
Leveling was just boring. Mind blast &gt; apply DoT &gt; Shield &gt; Wand till dead. Was not enjoying it.
---
Having analysed our cases I’ve come up with the conclusion that it’s a combination of the two factors: high playing uptime and reports of “cheating” on your character. Most people who got banned are AV farmers (who stay AFK but are not necessarily bots) except for me - I was just levelling my mage and people kept reporting me for cross-faction collusion (which is not fair from many people’s perspective, but is not against the TOS). There is nothing besides that mage on the account and I don’t even farm AV so I am quite convinced it was the amount of reports that triggered the autoban system.
---
If you didn't bot they will likely unban your account soon like all the others who have been unbanned, seems like it didn't take long at all for them to fix the mistakes, so just keep trying bud.
---
You made me happy and sad at the same time. That feeling man...
---
Love is stomping on a water elemental together.
---
I didn't do it!  It was the one armed roblox!
---
yeah it can take forEVER to get accepted. I believe it was my PTSD and constant suicidal ideation that got me accepted
---
i don't want to be rude but you said you take 3 hours to do molten core, that's just being absolutely disrespectful to everyone's time
---
wack ass reddit casual olympics at it again, dad division
---
As a Horde player, I greatly approve of this comment. What about the orcs though?
---
Whenever I join a group as rank I always preface it by saying I’m rolling on heal gear. 70% of the time it’s fine because groups don’t want to spend more time looking for a tank.
---
My tank is actually more geared than my heals despite me healing most of the time.
---
do they? now I gotta make sure I'm there for the midnight ones.
---
Man, I'm really sorry to hear this. WoW is supposed to have a great community - I mean, the community is the one thing that has always been highlighted as making the game special, however, there are just douchebags in this game hiding amongst us which ruin the experience.
---
Are you/did you tell people that you were new to the instance? I feel like this would have a big impact of how people would behave towards you. 
---
I'm sad you got discouraged from tanking.  These pricks will unfortunately always be in the game, and some times it's just necessary to kick them or whatnot. I can tell you that over the years my tolerance for idiots like these have really diminished - if I can tell rather quickly that people are jerks I'll instantly put them on my ignore list and I won't feel bad about it at all.
---
I hope you'll pick up tanking again when you feel at some point, and maybe got a bit more experience with the dungeons :)
---
Why should premades just allow everyone? That’s not the point of a premade
---
so...that probably has something to do with the joke... ;)
---
Ok. Maybe I just love questing too much. But for rotation they all feel the same.
---
They have a phone callback option on their CS site. I found it with a minimal amount of digging. 
---
They aren’t open now, due to it being a holiday, but that’s likely your best bet.
---
False positives occur in probably less than 2% of the overall cases. Humans make mistakes, it happens. 
---
I am happy for less bots
---
That's what I'm saying.
---
I did
---
a hilarious one
---
Speed on boots is great when levelling.  If you want to spend a little to speed up your early levels, you can enchant a skinning knife with +30 spell power and it will hugely speed up your early levels.
---
&gt; They created the problem
---
No. It was created by folks that chose to stay on those realms. Despite them being too crowded. 
---
&gt;yet they dont do anything about it.
---
They literally did everything short of forced transfers. But sure. Blizz bad. Everyone else good. I get it.
---
I work a full time job and do a lot of things around the house so aside from Fri/Sat and holidays I don't get more than an hour or two per day to play, I don't think playtime was a factor in my case. I definitely don't AFK in AV, although I've been actively farming AV in all my play time for the last week. I was one game away from exalted when I got banned, not sure how many hours/games it takes to get there. I suppose I got reported a bunch but I don't have any known enemies on my server so I'm not sure what I might have been reported for.
---
I do have a tendency to jump around a lot so maybe they just counted the number of jumps per hour and banned everyone thinking it was AutoHotKey lol
---
I exclusively play defense in AV and I have never been reported afk.  I bet this guy rides into a tower at the beginning of the match then goes afk for 15 mins and acts like he's way smarter than the people jumping in the starting cave.
---
What game you playing?
---
They only drop after 6pm with a 50:50 between nightfin and the sun fish. After midnight only nightfin drop. 6am it's back to 50:50, and finally from noon to 6pm its only the sun fish that will drop.
---
&gt;Sure, but tanking in a full fury spec is going to be quite difficult without some really good gear
---
well for starters it's a fury build.. 
---
Dps increase=threat increase. simple as that
---
Just started a new toon. Enjoying it more than in October.

Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt...
---
You're doin it wrong. Hunter was way more fun for me than Shaman. Winding shot patterns to get to the top of the dps and threat meters, then hitting FD and making the mages jealous. It's like dancing watching all the cool downs and piano making each one reset in the right order.
---
Also, the Rhok'delar quest will make you much more dangerous in Pvp.
---
Curious on any new thoughts about putting points into Improved Slam. It doesn't seem worth it to me as long as you're paying attention and the extra .5 cast time wouldn't get push back or you have to move like you mentioned. I don't think I'd risk even using Slam on any mobile fight which would make those points worthless during those times. Have you tested in a raid environment yet? I just acquired OEB last week and first heard about this Slam technique using the macro last night, but have been looking up any and all information I can find regarding it. It feels wonky in dungeon; I like having extra buttons to press so this is pretty cool.
---
Their CS is in Texas now iirc. Yes you would have needed to have contacted them before 12 central today. Since it’s a holiday. 
---
$15 a month only buys so much lol.
---
Realm discord, classic wow guilds discord, reddit lfg monday, blizzard forums
---
The guards were already bugged in a lot of areas of booty bay. So it’ll be the same 60s vs my 30 warlock griefing.
---
They are getting unbanned because they are harassing call center employees that don't work directly for Blizzard, have never played WoW, and speak pidgin English.  If getting banned doesn't prove they were cheating then having the ban reversed doesn't prove their innocence.
---
I was able to get my original name also! Kuney, Tauren Druid; originally from Laughing Skull PvP server.

Are external macros bannable? I ask because I have a targeting macro in wow that I use with a keyboard macro that I hold the button and it presses the key every 250ms.
---
It ain't easy eating green.
---
it's not even 61+ it's just 63 and raid bosses. 
---
With 300 weapon skill you only need 6% hit against 62 mobs and only glance for 70% damage 30% of the time or 91% damage dealt versus 63 or raid mobs you glance for 55% damage 40% of the time or .82% damage.
---
This could be studied by scholars  for comparisons to illegal immigration
---
If you fish in AV 20 hours a day then yes you should get banned.
---
A very, very slight advantage.
---
They aren't addons like DBM or questie is though. They are hacks that people call "addons" cause it sounds better.

Blizzigon is also mature language somehow, while Blizigon isn't.

They are examples of things that are not against the ToS and not bannable.

Nobody is arguing that and it’s how people tend to act. What people are saying though is that in 5-10 mans people will often play their OS just to get the group running. When I raid on my Druid I heal, so if I want to run UBRS and hope for a trinket off Jed but you ask me to tank? I’m rolling on the bloody trinket, you don’t get to have me do the be role you need while locking me out of the gear I’m actually after. 
---
And this is a common thing. A shadow priest guildie got begged to heal a live stretch run because “it’ll be fine please”. They then rolled on and won the hit neckpiece annnnnd everyone lost their shit. Did they not expect a shadow main spec to want spell hit..?

I miss hunter. sPriest was AWESOME.
---
Pretty sure shield slam can't. Everything else can though. This is the same as windfury and sword spec.
---
based, this thread really shows how smoothbrained redditors are
---
Every NPC has. 1 percent chance to resist any spell regardless of their level and your gear. Happens to vanish aswell
---
Happy new year =) great shot !
---
Sell tanking services is a good way, leveling alts like a mage or hunter are also good, fishing is very easy to do while watching netflix. Alts with crafting CDs. At the end of the day the best way to earn gold is to play the game.
---
After leveling an alt from 50-60 last week, on my server at least I would say it's as bad as phase 2 was before BGs. Everywhere was camped, trying to turn in a quest meant multiple deaths from people camping everlook etc. Every flight point was camped.

Watch out everyone! We got a badass over here! Look out! He’ll be condescending to you because you don’t spend every moment you’re awake engaged with a game that’s been solved for over a decade. 
---
Give me a break. 
---
Speaking of being disrespectful to everyone’s time, why don’t you fuck right off? Your elitism isn’t helping out the newbie. You told him to respec because he wasn’t being helpful to the raid. 
---
So fucking what?
---
Why don’t you help him get better at his chosen spec rather than looking down your nose at people who are actually addressing his question...
---
Or just simply stop wasting our time and fuck off.

👍
---
Any kind of automation is bannable.
---
I’d rather be ringing in the new year this way but I’m stuck going out...
---
It’s hard I mean PVP has it all if you search for it and after all these years the bare bones skill of the game to me is in PVP even if some things will always be unbalanced it’s really fun to interact with the other faction
---
I tank occasionally but much prefer dps because besides a second deathbringer I have the best current dps gear warriors can currently get so I only do strat undead to farm holy water and rep and dm n for tribute buffs
---
People are joking a lot about bots in wow but tbh I've tested some neural networks in wow and I'm quite sure in less than 5 years this game will totally die only because you won't be able to discern player from bot.
---
He's absolutely correct. Doing bgs with a 60% mount just gimps your team hard.
---
Dwarfs and their passion...
---
Druids are way better at generating aggro. basically, to catch up to a bear with MCP, a warrior of similiar gear level needs to dual-wield a Thunderfury and another epic.
---
Add adexplorata if you roll horde and I’ll throw ya some bags and gold ☺️
---
there have been other ban waves but usually related to bugs, not sure if this is first anti bot banwave.
---
I'm looking for a guild that is social and has an active discord. I tend to play Holy Paladin and Resto Druid. Any suggestions?
---
Helpful comment! I noticed you left out Maraudon, do you recommend not doing it?
---
How do you skip the last boss with invis pots?
---
Opinion : you're complaining about posts that no one saw
---
Sword and Board. However, if I'm in Arms I'll open with the 2-hander combo, then switch over.
---
I don't mind tanking 5 mans for friends/guildies but I'm not dealing with pugs as a tank.
---
I don't consider taking to be hard at all; I've tanked every non-raid dungeon at 60 as either arms or fury with no problems, and I main tanked in retail all the way up to mythic raids, even finding it easier to be a tank than a melee dps on some fights.
---
Main spec tanks kind of get the shaft in classic. Both deep prot and fury/prot are pretty miserable to play outside of instances. Retail largely solved this problem through stuff like dual spec, introducing more viable tank classes, and increasing tank damage/aoe so they can solo effectively.
---
When the imps spawn you jump up and reset on a little ledge by the broken rock they come out of and invis pot into the cave to mine the ore.
---
yeah if these ppl had bound jump to mousewheel and scrolled while watching netflix they would be fine but they probably had some kind of autoclicker going, like other people have admitted to using quite frequently, and just had the misfortune of being caught
---
Rogues are pretty awful to level but at max level they really shine. And with great gear they’re borderline overpowered. I can’t wait until I (hopefully) get misplaced servo-arm with hemo spec.
---
It's not a bug it's intentional. Submerge phase is a timer but you can trigger it early by killing all the sons. If not it would be easy to exploit by just keeping a son banished and letting the raid regen and reposition and wait for cooldowns before killing it. 
---
Same with Ony phase 2 its on a timer and she'll land and start phase 3 even if you don't get her health low enough.
---
It doesn't come up because most raids don't survive that long.
---
have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
---
I didn't get banned for multiboxing.
---
Fair enough, both people and machines can make mistakes. Don’t see why everyone is brigading the people getting unbanned. I guess innocent until proven guilty doesn’t fly in reddit land.
---
I've got some questions. 
---
Can you confirm whether or not Ravager's Bladestorm effect can proc Lifesteal and Crusader? I was disappointed to find out the Valor set can only proc from actual melee hits, based on my own testing.
---
What type of gear are you using - Plate DPS?
---
Hell yeah brother thats how I feel, thought Hunter would be a mistake but I felt like a god from 10+
---
&gt; If my coworker steals from someone my company is not obligated to reimburse the victim

Your company is absolutely liable if your coworker steals while acting as an agent of the company.

That's incorrect

I am envious of guilds that see the band. From our last 10 kills we have gotten:
---
Ancient Petrified Leaf - 5
---
The Eye of Divinity - 5
---
Core Forged Greaves - 5
---
Wild Growth Spaulders - 2
---
Fireguard Shoulders - 3
---
Gloves of the Hypnotic Flame - 2
---
Fireproof Cloak - 2
---
Core Hound Tooth - 2
---
Wristguards of True Flight - 2
---
Aged Core Leather Gloves - 1
---
Sash of Whispered Secrets - 1
---
Never seen a band. Our healers are sad.
---
Prime Alliance dickhead, should have kept  that nickname visible
---
Priest is a lot more fun than I remember it being. If you actually get wand spec, unlike me when I was a kid, you basically chunk mobs into pieces with it. Also following a guide that tells me which quests reward the best wands for my level has helped tremendously. A decade ago I always wanted a high level priest but could never level one because I was oom all the time and found it boring. Not the case when you just dot and wand. Also the healing is pretty damn fun too since they have a spell for basically every situation, so I'm very much enjoying the versatility.
---
I'm aware the submerge phase ends when all adds are dead or banished, or after 90s have passed. Check the video - all 8 sons were alive when he re-emerged.
---
Ehhhh from my personal experience just find someone who is selling the Blackstone Ring and pay them 20-30g to just get it for you. That's a really common hustle for hunters.
---
It's just an incredibly long dungeon and it takes forever to find people who want to do it. Then all the people you do find want the same ring, you could easily invest 3hrs filling and doing the dungeon just to lose your 20% drop to the 3 others rolling on it. 
---
You should run it one time tho if you plan on tanking. It gives the BiS mitigation trinket from a quest called The Pariah's Instructions which requires a full run.
---
wow and I thought our 22 warriors other day was a lot.
---
Not the commenter but:
---
- your healing power/hot is good enough to sustain yourself/heal others
---
- you have a big pool of hp in bear/mana
---
- If you spec in 1/29/21 you can even get 25% of autoroot, which is great, feral charge, instant heal, feral faerie fire (yeah, fuck you rogues)
---
Usually because it's more work to find a replacement. I just grin and bear it.
---
&gt; but I have been surprised by the number of feral/pally tanks I haven’t ran into
---
At least from my experience, anyone with an eye on the raiding scene is mostly only going to be seriously considering warriors as being able to play a tank role there. I HAVE seen feral off tanks, but "off tank" is second banana in all likelihood considering what gearing up a proper bear tank probably had to go through. Paladins doing any kind of tanking in raids is just not something I've seen be realistic (mostly because of taunt), so usually paladins are relegated to healing or rarely as a "why not" ret pickup. So you have class specs that you might have to work a fair bit towards optimizing, which are then not desired. And even if you DO come anyways, what actually drops might not be of interest or priority for you.

Thank you for posting ans sharing your thoughts about me. I  enjoyed all comments below and cheers from some of the Horde members.

Please note that I am not a scum bag ...I am THE SCUMBAG OF ALL HORDE!

Btw, when you died from that quest, I laughed so hard.  I hope you have learned a lesson to never trust me when I am around you. Like you said , I am a bastard so be carefull next time.
---
Hopefully you can tell all your nice friends to hunt me down in Burning Steppes while I farm. They always tend to attack  me when I have aggro on mobs at less 50 % health and laugh on top of my little dead Orcish body.
---
Love you always from Pickle :)
---
We talked a lot about PUGs, but I want to add a comment about guildies too. Please do not expect that a tank's playtime is at your beck and call. I have things I want to do in-game too, so I can't always drop everything and come tank for you. Zero respect for my playtime.
---
I had guildies who get  all aggro on me or other tanks if we are not available. And sometimes, I just don't want to tank. After a whole evening of tanking for guildies, I need a break too. So yes, I only run with guildies but if they are someone who aggro on me for not be available, I won't tank for them unless it's an end game raid.
---
And have some common courtesy, don't just throw me an invite  to fill your last tank spot the second I log on without telling me what's going on.
---
All these behaviour makes it stressful to be a tank even amongst guildies.
---
Yea it’s not a bug
---
Raids don't need 8 tanks (40/5=8) you might think that there are too few tanks but when it comes to raids raid tank scene is quite competitive, you might not get to be one of 4 tanks and there is only 1 main tank, 
---
Also primary dps warrirs might tank your dungeans but you can be sure as hell they don't want to give up rolling on drek main hands or Hoj or gladiator chest or truestrike shoulders.
---
As tank you really see the value of 20man 10man raids
---
Op will cry he didnt do anything
---
Tauren. I don’t mean the overall damage is underwhelming I just mean the prov rate in general. For mediocre dps compared to the cost to make I had hoped the proc rate would be higher. I can see it being good if more members have the wep to get 3 stacks but as the only warrior using it in my raid group it seems not amazing. Looks cool though DW with FB!
---
Somebody got killed when they landed
---
Actual people play this game too, it's not going to die because of bots.
---
What level were you when you did it?
---
Its not a rule.  Its a generally accepted practice.  The loot rules are based on the party lead.
---
If you get on top of dmg meters as a hunter your raid dps is very bad
---
whats the link to this discord?
---
you are incorrect in several assertions. deep prot is good for all levels of gear; your threat is simply less gear dependent since you're relying on high threat abilities like revenge and shield slam rather than raw numbers.
---
you will also output MORE threat as deep prot until you hit a certain threshold of AP/crit that requires full world buffs at all times and really isn't reached in the current phase.
---
being able to dps is nice but if you're an actual tank, fury prot is frustrating because you lose anger management and have to be far more deliberate in changing stances or risk losing all of your rage. 
---
the only use for fury prot at this stage is to increase clear times by increasing the overall dps of the raid for guilds looking to push clears under 45 minutes. you CAN use fury prot if you want because no dps can reach a level of threat in this phase that would require deep prot. 
---
the fight club discord has all of this information with a ton of logs and data to support it
---
When you have it equipped, undead enemies in WPL/EPL/Strat/Scholo drop scourgestones which you can turn in for Argent Dawn rep.
---
They are having fun weirdo.
---
Not like it matters anyways. Get ganked by 60 rogues on all days.
---
So don't pay.  Enjoy your search.
---
I like tanking on Druid and Warrior but won't bother trying with Paladin. The main issue is I see all these people looking for tanks while I'm trying to level other classes (altitis) and my tanks can only do each dungeon so many times before they're over leveled for it
---
Regardless of whether he's venting or legitimately wants to try to get it changed, he's clearly aware of the fact that it's not currently a bannable offense, or else he never would have made the post.

You can keep replying too if you want, I'll be around a little while longer before heading out to enjoy some NYE festivities

The real question is why do you care

Its usually only an issue when the entitled person doesn't get what they think they are entitled too.

So the people who didn’t got banned but are afking are cool.

How do you know BWL is early January?
---
I'm sorry, I must be missing something... What did we do that triggered the submerge phase to end early?
---
So don't do it if it's not worth it to you
---
&gt; I can't find any guilds that are recruiting tanks.
---
The awkward thing about warriors is that they tend to be in high demand for tanking dungeons, but in raids the amount and percentage of dedicated tanks is far smaller. DPS warriors are fine, and can often be desired, but raid tanking is its own beast above and beyond dungeon tanking.
---
Piggybacking on dr_thri11 - try ‘LFM need dps/heals’ you will fill up quicker than a hiccup
---
Meh, i was top DPS in T1 and T2 raids 15 years ago and i expect to be top DPS when i get my Hunter to 60 again ... 
---
With the right spec, gear and skill Hunter DPS rules.

All the b1 boys on my server logged in today to post a screen cap for stacking. Guess it helps having a server wide premade, its a lot of fun and glad non of them did something naught and wish them the best of luck.
---
I think people are grossly underestimating the number of false positives that occur. It's not unreasonable to think that they've pushed out automated systems before they're ready for the sake of 'saving money'.
---
Well said, especially since the edgy OP claims that those are wasting his time.
---
Classic look for a classic game.  I ran something similar throughout vanilla/tbc.
---
For Tauren BIS this tier is probably Daggers with a Mugger's Belt or Core Hound Gloves.  QS + Edgemasters is probably a little worse than daggers but you get what you get when it comes to loot drops.

UI's all about personal preference. 
---
For me, I'd hide the bags and menu-buttons completely. You rarely (ever?) use them. I've put mine at the top with 0% opacity, only visavle when I hover it.
---
I'd also put the xp bar under the action bars and make it the same width as the action bars.
---
Have fun and experiment with the UI!
---
I see what you're getting at, but druids actually have an extraordinarily easy time gearing up and there are actually several alternatives/backups that are suitable for raids. A lot of items are BOE and are dead simple to get. Very little gear has competition, and any Rogue joining a group would be expecting a feral druid to roll on the few pieces that do overlap. I was in all BIS or optional gear by the time I hit 60 just by doing some dungeons from 54-60.
---
But LHH lasts just as long as an epic mount as well, the entire games duration
---
Oh, I guess that makes warriors, rogues, hunters, and everything that's not a "cookie cutter talents, fuck your fun, tryhard 3 mage, a warlock, and priest aoe run" a meme spec too then.
---
Pack it up /r/classicwow, if you aren't AoE leveling a mage, you are playing this game wrong.

I gotta get on this train.  Just maxed cooking and got fishing up.
