If you press key combination once and your game closes, that might have just been a coincidence. When you press the same keys the second time and your game closes, you should see a pattern. The third time you press the same fucking keys and your game closes, you are an actual moron.
---
You talked about 'broken' in the title, none of these things are broken - they are all design choices and intentional. 
---
There are definitely QoL things in retail that are much more enjoyable, but your list would be different to mine, and both to a third guy's. Where Blizzard draw lines will always cause rifts and anger ('why did X class get this tweak and my class got nerfed'), and it's better they don't try imo. If they added new content I'd hope only for instances/raids/quests/reps and nothing in terms of balance or class mechanics. And if anyone disagrees it just proves my point.

He’s dumber than a bag of hammers. His interviews are retarded and he constantly interrupts to ask or say stupid irrelevant crap.
---
Hes thinking of the bigglesworth Boiz of alliance side probably. They're gettin a bad rep

This helmet looks dope af equipped. Need to craft mine still. Just made the mission out to azshara for the plans:)

There is the immensely popular VanillaFriends website.
---
best question zone at 51. Just run around kill EVERYTHING you see and turn your quests in!
---
I’m like 51% sure I checked there. You sure?
---
I don’t know man, there is a LOT of cement/mortar used in Stormwind. All that CO^2 released into the air...
---
the only annoying thing here is your selfish asses
---
It's not lame if it keeps on working.
---
you ask the tank to pull in to the room that was previous and clear.
---
I’ll google it!
---
&gt;  the first 20 levels have been miserable. 
---
Weird; I have a Warrior, and the first 10 levels were actually amazing (after buying some 2H sword from the AH). The "power" wore off towards the end of Goldshire and into Westfall though.
---
It's absolutely not growing, that's for sure. If you have altism and play multiple differently leveled characters you notice pretty quickly.
---
I'm sorry but this is hilarious
---
THEY.... MUG PEOPLE?
---
Ya but it isn't as cool! Loved it when you can almost 1 hit someone from a cool wf crit.
---
I too, hate when people say toons. I know they’re a boomer.
---
Last night I had to go to STV in order to help a few lowbies from my guild, Horde was chain-killing them and not letting them complete quests or do anything, as a level 60 I went to their quest camp and killed every horde (even the 60s) and NPC on sight, few hours after that I got an e-mail from Blizz saying I could get banned for doing this, and i'm not the only one who got this mail according to some 60s who were in the area at that time.
---
To be honest man I agree. Im only 45 but from all the comments / vids etc i was expecting way way harder time. I have almost maxed cooking / first aid / alchemy and it doesnt feel hard. a bit more time consuming, but not hard.
---
Got a warrior to 60, hunter is 10 and it feels 100% quicker.
---
I didnt know macros could be used for anything other than casting spells. how does a macro for buying something work/look like?
---
They will also have no value on patch release because hundreds of people will save up for them just like you.
---
They'll only be valuable after the initial server-wide stockpile is finally depleted. Which would take some time.

I was wracking my brain trying to remember what we called the player character in UO. I was pretty sure it wasn't toon, and I don't recall hearing char until Diablo 1.  
---
Seems so obvious now and I feel like a fool for forgetting.
---
This isn't even Ironforge which has A LOT more Alliance in it ATM.

&amp;#x200B;
---
7:50 P.M. on a Tuesday (raid night, I know) Heartseeker-Alliance. 
---
Transfers seem to be closing soon. Horde, please transfer over before it's too late. A LOT of Alliance to kill here.
---
Oh right sorry :S
---
True actually
---
yup! most random world mobs have small chances at dropping purple boes
---
Caution: Remember Windows Key+Ctrl+F4 before continuing. 
---
How about using Windows Key+Ctrl+D instead of Alt+F4? That's one most people aren't used to yet. Try it, I'll wait... It opens a new virtual desktop, so it looks like everything you had open got closed, but it's not. It's like having a whole separate login if you want to, oh, I don't know... surf the internet while you're supposed to be doing homework, so you have one virtual desktop with just your homework open like a good focused student, and another virtual desktop with more interesting things open. Then you can Windows Key+Ctrl+Right and Windows Key+Ctrl+Left to swap between them when dad comes to check on you and make sure you're working. The Windows Key+Ctrl+F4 thing closes the current virtual desktop.
---
The best is people glitching in the corner across from here where they can attack you but you can’t see or reach them
---
&gt;where you can fish all day, or dance on top of a mailbox if that's what you want to do.
---
In the end you are correct, people can enjoy the game has they want. It also happen that I enjoy mocking some of those ways and I am free to do so :)
---
What add-on is that to make the words all gibberish on the map and chat?
---
Google it. IMDB gave it 5.7/10 and it made me hate IMDB for ratings. Logan was also in The Thinning and The Space Between Us
---
Bro wtf? They told him to do it. He doesn’t know how to. Then is told to keep trying. You’re a fucking loser dude. Go away. He asked for help and got continuously trolled. You’re part of the problem you fuck nut. Go away.
---
Sent me a stack of Nightfin soup on my mage. Was very much appreciated all things considering.
---
I’ve played for years and leveled during tbc and vanilla and because of that era I had to have a healing set and a tanking set.
---
That being said, I knew my main spec is Ret. so I’m going to roll for Ret. my off spec is holy and prot. But they’re offspec. Meaning they are secondary. Meaning that if there’s a mage who needs the int neck then I pass even if I’m holy. I also state that I will be rolling on off spec if no one needs it for their main.
---
So far no one has had issues with the way I do things. I think it’s fair. If anything someone may be mad that I’m healing as ret and taking dps gear lmao
---
If you haven’t pretended to be a pet, are you even a Druid?
---
See my alt is a warrior and I feed him gear 
---
The first 25 levels were sooooooo easy.
---
He now has a stupid amount of blues from sfk and WC. I'm making him into a level 29 twink and remaking a warrior to level to 60.
---
Idk I agree with OP. Warrior isnt that bad at all.
---
If you just spam as a tank it ain't going to be that slow
---
his bottom right action bar on the right image shows no key modifiers.

[LMGTFY](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=classic+wow+warrior+macros)
---
Are you speccing fury and taking the slam talent?
---
Probably just a catch all. People reported the original grieves, so they just sent out a blanket email to everybody involved in the incident
---
It's not irrelevant, IMO - requiring 5 people to commit their time in order to balance out one person's power is bad game balance. And balance is actually important in PVP - maybe more so than in PVE. Power differentials are fine, as long as the person who has more power than you actually earned that power in a way you can aspire to. "Because they paid more" is not a good reason for someone to be more powerful than me in PVP.
---
Clearly we either disagree on what counts as pay-to-win, or on whether p2w is a bad thing. Either way, thanks for actually engaging me rather than just making another "nuh-uh" comment :)
---
What point are you trying to prove with your unbuffed mana pool of the gear I have zero concept of. Sounds like you need intellect from 8 pieces of tier gear.
---
How is me saying I’m glad that I’ve killed a boss after the games been out for a month ‘overselling’
---
lmao... i was tanking and did the same thing. He flamed striked the ground so I was like "oh, i'll just move over to the edge here so i'm not standing in his flamestrike" the second i got to the edge of the platform i got punted into the lava.... lul
---
Is fearing not considered to be an attack?  
---
Also, can't you put the whole process into 1 macro? Something like:  
---
/tar Qia  
---
/press InteractWithTargetHotkey  
---
/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)  
---
/run MerchantFrame:Hide()  
---
Sorry if the question is stupid, I am new to WoW.
---
No you didn’t. You distrusted a community. It’s not a simple “I went and PvP” because this happens every single night on Sulfuras that some town is raided for over an hour until it’s defended again by the high lvls. You distrusted game play some how that you’re not telling and trying to get brownie points for whining about it.
---
Does Lorti even have any configuration options? I installed it recently too and I thought it just made things darker and that was it. I’m curious if there is an option menu somewhere
---
Oh I understand now, I don't think bartender can do it, but haven't looked into that tbh, sorry that I wasn't of any help.
---
I can agree with that. But assuming they're not just looking for a carry and it is a kill quest or just farming rep, may as well group up.
---
Yeah what a dumbass trusting people fr 
---
This attitude is so fucking toxic holy shit
---
Its great for stirring up the hornets nest, as a 60 if your looking for pvp doing something like slaughtering everyone at nessings then waiting there is almost a guarantee that someone higher level will show up to fight you.
---
Putting a few people down in questing areas also keeps things civil for our lowbie allies :)
---
Also watching them try out run the dots is fun.  When it comes to camping lowbies though thats a shit move.
---
Just fight mobs 1-2 levels lower than you. You wont miss as much and you'll generate tonnes of rage through your fury talents and DW.
---
Now fighting higher level mobs DW? That's a death wish
---
Love these moments :")
---
If you’re a Tauren you can get away with 0 points in NG.  Warstomp, regrowth, rejuvenate.  Besides NG never procs at convenient times anyway.  It’s like windfury.  It procs when they have like 2% health.
---
Basicaly, they alow what you did but with a limit, and you went over that limit. At least that is what i  think it happened
---
Did you delete your post?
---
Look at the action bars, shortcuts etc. - you play way more efficient now. I still don't get how you guys are able to play classic. I died of boredome  like 15 lvl in. 
---
Maybe that's because I leveled up like 1-2 chars each xpac and know every damn combination of char and class from the ground and did the fucking quests a thousand times. Cataclysm was so epic in that aspect, as I finally got something new to see and play. Hell, the fucking quest giver quest with dumass, the pussy Dk and Jonny awesome still makes me laught my ass off. 
---
That's also the biggest problem for me now. Wow got to easy. Not in terms of playing the game, but in terms of complexity. I want my reforging, avoid, parry, soft/hard caps etc. Back. Also my skills trees. Give me the active skill stuff (the idea behind it is fine) and a separate passive skill tree, so I can select +3% avoid on my ice dk tank again instead of 3%hp, so I can feel special again, like the small, unique snowflake I wanna be from time to time.
---
You're doing it wrong. Since everyone is selling silk at vendor prices, you should be buying, not selling. Buy the silk for 1s51c, turn it into a silk bandage and sell to vendor for 2s.
---
Say sorry I can't dont have it leveled, come back later when they gone
---
The true way to RP a rogue lol
---
https://xkcd.com/242/
---
Yup, OP got BURNED!
---
Alliance scum.
---
The fact that he is dumb (?), his interviews are retarded (???) and that he interrupts (that I can see) doesn't mean that his, obviously extremely knowledgeable guests, are wrong about their respective classes, in this situation LMGD.
---
They're probably waiting for BG's to be released and helping the opposition get to level. The more 60's there  the better the wpvp is as well.
---
could solo farm ZF GY or SM wings as well
---
Something something lucky ten thousand
---
Not everyone, even WoW players, are extremely online NEETs, believe it or not.
---
We don't have trinkets yet.  Pvp will change a lot when we do.
---
Druids can tank everything.
---
Well, you can use 1 shadow priest to boost warlock's damage output.
---
Thanks for that man. Got me more pumped to get to high level. I'm gunna wowhead some info tonight on BiS gear
---
30 day ban here too using VPN. Figure I’d be slick leveling while sitting through 4 days of 10 hour video conferences for work.
---
Not to the second smh
---
The spec skill numbers do nothing except flavor as far as I know.
---
The weapon skill difference is pretty important for melee classes, especially since there's virtually no +hit chance gear until high level, and it's why races with weapon skill bonuses almost always try to use that weapon type. Same for party/block.
---
The talent point is self explanatory, though 20, 30, and 40 tend to be especially significant as most specs have a one-point major ability at 10, 20, and 30 points.
---
Hard disagree
---
Whatever horde...
---
This reminds me if Basin, in Razor Hill. They RP'd a magic basin. It was glorious.
---
Unfortunately NE!
---
FUNNIEST part imo is the fact he didnt even care to atleast mail it to an alt or something before throwing it up on the AH
---
Put your pet on passive and do dungeons.  Wolves are great passive pets because they provide a buff.
---
I've seen the pattern for Minor Beastslayer drop, it's available
---
Cheaper repair costs?? You will be spending quite a lot of gold in the AQ+ range for repair costs.. would suggest at least revered
---
I can’t really speak for the resto build but I’m rolling the Hotw spec (1/29/21) and I personally don’t need to ever change it. It’s allows me to play my Druid how I want to and I can do any 5 man dungeon as whatever I want with it.. I’m mainly focused on wpvp and bgs when they come out and will keep the same spec most likely
---
Weird they only mentioned NPCs in the email, sounds like bullshit my dude
---
he's right. Why should you be entitled to gear you can't even wear? Makes no sense other than greed.
---
This is almost a necessity for a warrior, gotta link the needed weapons with the specific stance in the macro.
---
Aww, would've been neat if they left that in.
---
you got me ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Cause when you get dismounted by the other faction you wont have your bomb dispenser ready to blow
---
Yes this, or there’s great grinding to be had in desolace.
---
Like I said, I killed every NPC in the horde STV camp and all players, killing NPCs is bannable now?
---
Combat is pretty bad for PvP, but Riposte can be situationally useful. Getting improved sprint instead is an option... but honestly even with imp sprint, you are still going to get kited and destroyed by ranged without Prep.
---
Improved Sprint is good in some Prep builds, like Sub Daggers.
---
I thought it wasn't bad at all too, until I started leveling a alt. Realized how much easier other classes have it.
---
It's not a solution, because there will always be people like me who would rather just buy a recipe on the AH and carry on with my business than spend hours competing with others while doing nothing. 20-50g is absolutely nothing to many people, and a price I'd be happy to pay to not have to idle in wintergrasp.
---
I’m out of the loop.
---
Is it because they are super easy to play or they take a lot skill to master.
---
Mages seem pretty easy. Hunters are harder to get down but are awesome if you know how to play one end game. They both can level pretty easily.
---
/target 87257life

Sucks not being a warlock huh?

Seems like there's a lot more horde, but maybe that's just stv...
---
thank you for your input but you cant make me hate myself any more buddy. but thanks for the help
---
&gt;I don't pay for bad nostalgia trips that aren't close to the original.
---
Implies you didn't play Classic. 
---
Explanation:  If you didn't pay to play classic, then you can't judge the game as a bad nostalgia trip which was the point of my reply.  If you did play it, then you did pay for 'a bad nostalgia trip' which means your initial post was unclear.
---
Should be SpellHit. You can't really gear for it effectively as a rogue.
---
That's cool. I love how many cool water facts there are.
---
dead server. no thx
---
Take a look at the list of mats.
---
That said, the numers are in the hundreds of thousands for some cloth, 400k runecloth. Assuming a bank alt has full 18 slot bags, you'd need 3,174 alts alone, for just that 1 turn in.
---
If you're alliance, need another 600k silk, so another 4700 alts for that.
---
But there's still 10's of thousands of a dozen other mats per side.
---
I get that it's 'lol classic players bad' meme and all, but there's just a sheer number of accounts people need to have and to coordinate to do this.  I don't think the coordination will be there for a literal day 1 completion. Especially not "most" servers, as if all servers are mega try hard like the popular streamer servers.
---
those are really good ideas!
---
Jokes on you, that’s not me. It’s from someone else’s image earlier but I capitalized on the prime meme format. 
---
But yes. I’m crying Druid tears right now.
---
Only opened thread to say this
---
Especially the Waffen SS
---
Welcher Server?
---
Well, what does it say then?
---
Your intelligence is showing....
---
Vanish my dude.
---
It depends. Are your groups wiping? If so I agree there is an issue. If not, you should adjust your  expectations. DPS who pull can go ahead and tank. Protect your healer but let the DPS die
---
How does OP's story prove that they're auto-clicking?
---
ehrm.. zulian tiger..
---
Mortal strike.
---
Found anyone with common sense.
---
Haha, other classes do not have to worry about all those things you listed and still level faster and easier. 
---
Nobody is saying it's impossible to level a warrior. But it's undoubtedly the most difficult class to level solo.
---
All it takes is a few bits of blue plate and a shield in your bags.
---
I use 1-5 and the button left to 1 for damage moves. Q, E, for CCs with shift Q and E for mod shift CC, f and g for aoe abilities, x for execute/killmoves, C and V for mobility moves, R for healing moves, T for taunt/small defensive. Shift C, V, R, T for defense, middle mouse scroll down/up for moves that require the green circle to aim, such as bomb or heroic leap, shift mouse button 4 and 5 for potions and regular m4/m5 for buff moves
---
Yes working as intended. Yes same for rogues
---
honestly, might skip that one. I think sfk is probably easier
---
Wichtigstes Makro für nen Tauren!

Maybe develop out The Ninja a little more in the first panel, make him say an off-color remark or make his presence known before the 3rd panel. It feels a bit quick to the punch. Well done though and thank you for sharing your art. Enjoyed it. :)
---
I could say the same thing to you too. You don't exactly seem like the nicest person either :)
---
"It's so strange though. If you like sex, just look up pics of sex. I just can't imagine how having sex could be sensual".

Everyone has their thing, man. Some folks like feet. I don't, but I ain't gonna kink shame 'em.
---
i thought you were making an anagram and read it as "hid a dim troll"
---
This has been a running joke for like 20-25 years. Chill out.
---
Yeah this was my issue with it too. I was like "wait they put the independent variable on the Y, not X axis." lol
---
Vanish is what you want to escape combat.
---
So yes is the answer to my question.
---
Oh alright. Yeah I'm going like a disc/shadow for now to see how it goes and if my guild grows nicely or I find a good raiding guild I'll re spec to holy.
---
U naughty boy
---
Can’t go re stealth while in combat, gotta use vanish or get out of combat. But vanish can be used at any time, as long as you don’t have damage over time debuffs which will just bring you back out of stealth as soon as they tick
---
The brain play play is sticking up on elemental earth. Shit goes for 2g a pop come aq. 
---
Plague bloom is always a good pick up for sure.
---
I'm not even kidding really, saved my life over 10 times, and a lot of the corpse runs are freakish long. And there is a simple elegance to charging, emoting and then casually mounting up.
---
The only caveat to this, I think (and please correct me if I'm off-base), is if your available time for playing is very limited.  For example, as soon as I had ~5 gold that I didn't mind sinking into mats/crafted items, I made a habit of dumping this into undervalued items at the beginning+end of every play session and placing back on the auction house (or crafting, then placing back) for a small profit or holding till prices stabilize.
---
However, over the last four days or so I haven't had any time to play the actual game, but I've had enough time to log on and reset the auction house. I probably don't make a lot of money, but it certainly feels like I'm inching ahead even though I don't have time to play the game.
---
I'm too tired to actually check if this checks out but it looks about right. But if you look at it like this it may seem like missing 7 times in a row is unlikely, and it is from one pov, but it's also bound to happen sooner or later.  
---
These numbers are going to be my rough estimations as we lack actual numbers to apply for this as far as I know. But here goes.  
---
Let's say you're a warrior and the avarage mob takes 15 attacks to murder. It might be more and it might be less it will depend mostly on what gear you manage to get a hold on honestly.  
---
Let's say you have to kill 25 mobs on avarage to complete a quest and that you have to complete 15 quests to level up.  
---
These are estimates but let's see where they take us, 15 attacks to kill a mob, and we kill 25 to complete a quest that's 375 attacks. Then we're gonna do that 15 times to level up, that's 5625 attacks for a level.  
---
Now we're gonna level up 60 times so that's gonna give us 337 500 attacks and 337 500 chances for us to get our 7 misses when we hit level 60 assuming we stop playing when we get there. Most people probably don't. And btw, if we dual wield this math is false and any off hand attacks are way more likely to miss just as well.  
---
But this is also just one player. there's also a few million players, hard to tell exactly how many but let's say 2 000 000 just to be on the safe side. Since at least I don't have any data we divide the player base on class equally and thus that get's us ~222 222 warrior players where let's say at least a third of them should be around level 60 by now, 74 074.  
---
That gives us from all the warriors that are level 60 according to my estimations (there are a fuck ton of estimations here but most of them I've been low balling) a total of 24 999 975 000 attacks excluding attacks after they hit level 60 and excluding plebs that are not level 60 yet.  
---
So my point I am trying to make here is, it's extremely likely that other warriors have been missing 7 times in a row, statistically it happens all the time and it's not THAT unlikely compared to how many warriors there are and how often you attempt to fight things. even though consecutive misses that many times in a row are in their own rare.
---
Is Moneystack your given name, or something that came with the crossdressing?
---
bs, when?
---
Man, it sounds like you wanna take the long way to casting a spell
---
"Priests - DON’T put a shield on a bear/warrior tank. They build rage from getting hit. Early fight threat is the hardest to get and it will inhibit their ability to gain threat. Also shields aren’t typically mana efficient."
---
As a paladin tank I prefer no bubble too. Bubbles prevent things like my Retribution Aura, and Blessing of Sanctuary / Shield Spike, and probably Holy Shield ( if I were high enough to learn it ) from procing. When pulling that additional 12 damage to the off target really makes a difference to me holding aoe aggro.
---
Have you done searing gorge and felwood yet
---
I first got Alt f4 trolled in Diablo 2 when kid me was convinced by some older player that he would show me how to dupe items.  He told me to stand the other side of town and drop my really rare gear on the floor.  I was nervous because I didnt want him running up and stealing it but he moved across the other side of town so I felt like the exploit was legit.  He then made me do another couple random steps and the last thing to do was alt-f4.  Of course, my game shut down and he took all my gear.  
---
That was the day I lost my innocence.
---
In regards to your spec, you should be fine tanking as an arms warrior.  Tactical Mastery and Anger Management allow you to stance dance and keep rage, so you can charge in, get some rage, pop your demo shout/thunderclap, and swap to defensive stance with some rage left over.  Ive been Arms since 10 and tank all dungeons I run with my guild.
---
At max level it would be beneficial to swap to Prot until you get geared to tank as Fury, but until then you should be fine tanking as Arms.
---
Nahhh just trying to organize a solid totem bar

Is retail without expansions is just like classic?

Not even close.

So blizzard told you not to use a name and you kept using it anyway now you want to be unbanned?  Poor todd he probably has to deal with people like you all day

I couldn't get details to work as a threat meter so I installed a different one and went to recount for damage since I was more familiar with it

MB5 is for Mount.

MB4 is for Other Mount.

For me it would be any world drop epic to drop while I'm playing solo.  I've seen them drop in groups but never solo... and I had 5 level 60's when I quit at TBC's launch.
---
My friend on the other hand has already had 6 drop for him and he isn't even 60 yet.
---
As a healer anyway it's my ocd to heal you, although you are still last on my list
---
Ahaha I see. Yeah, totems can be annoying af. I’ve always gotta macro them unless I wanna forget to use em
---
Play stupid games.  Deserved.

Can't Shadow use the Blade of Eternal Darkness?
---
The responses in this post is really interesting. Most times if there is a post about the opposite faction harassing a player by trying to kill them or insulting them the harassing behavior is praised or at the very least not thought of as bad behavior. However harassing behavior from the same faction is viewed as an asshole thing todo. This would mean that actions are not bad or good just by themselves but can be good or bad depending on who the actions are been applied to or from. 
---
Or reddit is just a big circle jerk of illogical opinions 😝
---
“You never go Axetomouth.”

So you wanna scroll through the totems in a pinch? Instead of having a small grid to see them all in any situation?

How can you tell?

so is your downvotes

Item level is only important when it comes to the DE table.

Do you wanna get pink eye?
---
Cause this is how you get pink eye.
---
So what? That's the whole point of the dungeon, to get items instead of buying of AH. I go to a dungeon to get this gear for my class.
---
You want to need on stuff you cant use and I can just because you're greedy. Horrible mentality.
---
Shit this hits me in the feels. Something similar happened to me in d2 way back when I was young and naive. A guy convinced me to download a link for something cool (cant recall what I was trying to do at the time) and it ran my guy into the corner in act 1 and started dropping all my gear. I panicked and didn't know what to do lol. Lost everything i had :(
---
Searing gorge yes, Felwood no. What does that matter? I did not intend to level through questing any further if I can avoid it.
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
Edited post, I’m in classic. Really just looking for addon advice though!
---
Maybe this would work if the gnomes stopped their engineering.
---
I believe thunderclap only hits 4 mobs.
---
Press F to say hello
---
No u
---
Maybe hydrocane?  Can be a great help when doing water quests.
---
Dont always buy all skills. Buy what you need.
---
No you both
---
Or incredibly uninformed, i.e I think I know everything because my limited experience. I have leveled 4 warriors in the last 2 years on classic and leveled a hunter to 60. Good hunters can have basically no downtime and can chain pull mobs. In the time it takes me to kill a mob on warrior and have to eat, I’d have killed 3-6 mobs as hunter...
---
i had and still have this same dilemma, Engineering / mining is probably going to win, consider this on a 16 slot quiver it cost over 1g to fill it with razer arrows, and when you are bored you can make arrows / shot to put on the AH, on my server thorium shells are going for over a gold per stack
---
Not only is it a dance-off, it's a nekkid dance-off!
---
Get that stick out of your ass dude
---
I dont mean Vanish. Look at this video where mage puts himself into ice block.

---
with all due respect AHing at a low level/this early to launch should be done for fun over efficiency. not saying that's at all a bad thing, but grinding is a lot more efficient
---
No fuck off. Stop treating new players like garbage.
---
Its not that bad if you use resources that werent available 15 years ago. TIL
---
A lock complaining about downtime? You are doing something wrong. I'm level 31 and I don't have downtime at all. 
---
You either aren't using your wand or are casting too many dots + shadowbolt(none). Succubus + corruption + wand sometimes immolation with drainlife + life tap = go forever.
---
I did not say there are no advantages. I multibox because it is fun. It is boring playing one character to me now. It can also be challenging and I also do not like grouping with others. Sometimes grouping can be great but retail is always bad when it comes to grouping from my experience. I would rather do dungeons by myself.

Might have actually been done

For straight up PvP, int/Stam is better. The warden staff is really only useful for damage mitigation in bear form, but you won't spend much time in bear form at all unless you need to be tanky for a few seconds or need the stun. There are other items that would be better, and most are just stat sticks. When it's released, the ranked PvP gear sets are awesome, especially if you can get the +movement speed set bonus. Take a look at engineering trinkets, boots, and hats for some other useful PvP gear. Admittedly I havent done my research enough to give a thorough list right now, but I will eventually.
---
The other thing to think about is your desired roles. The brilliant thing about druids is that if you swap gear, you can be reasonably effective at tanking, healing, or PvP regardless of spec. Also, since you aren't stacking spell power for damage, it's arguable that building your healing set and using it for PvP is a great idea. What I'm getting at is that for flag carry and AB defense, arguably a 8/12/31 spec is better. Why? Because you trade your hotw and feral faerie fire for improved healing and swiftmend, meaninging your instant heal ability is suddenly amazing, and you probably didn't lose tons of Mana since you were in healing gear with +int anyway. So you're doing the same damage as before, and your a bit harder to kill from self heals. The downside is that it does hamper your solo farming a little since your primary gear is healing and you'll have to keep up another set. Also, if you have cash to spare for respec costs, the 29/11/11 build is super fun for the highest damage you'll do in druid PvP, especially in the open world. (Notably you can also farm Mara princess for 35g+ per hour in this spec too). For reference, I am currently waffling between the hotw spec and the 8/12/31 spec for when phase 3 drops, but I'll probably be hotw until then.
---
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with this server. Or any server, for that matter. I wish people would just enjoy the game and stop complaining. Go back to retail!
---
I read fine.  You write bad.  Your writing indicates that you played original WoW, didn't play classic, and assume it's a bad nostalgia trip from reddit memes.
---
If it's different then it's because you suck at writing, sorry =/
---
The first one i think you can get its the chicken. Theres a cat lady. Theyre in westfall. Cookie can drop a cat in deadmines. The pirates can drop a parrot. Ive seen way more though.
---
It was maphack prolly, that happened to me too. I was 10ish years old.
---
Yeah, happened in Act 1 for me too.  I was stupid enough to fall for the manual version of the scam haha.  I remember being utterly devastated.
---
So im not a nice person for defending a new player who doesn't know the command to quit a toxic ass guild? Do you not see how wrong you are?
---
Your "reasonable people" argument doesn't even make sense by the way. 
---
By your logic, reasonable people wouldn't even play wow. 
---
Theyd be to busy learning how to optimize there actual life's instead of wasting them playing a game.
---
Same thing happened to me in D1.  "Run to Wirt. K now type "\~\~\~\~ADIRAx". K now alt+f4"   :'c
---
As a baseball fan I also laughed at the player in the bottom left named Adam Lind. I wanna believe it’s actually him playing WoW

When you get a request from covergh0ul that's me.

Dal rends set
---
Almost always beasts (I killed a lot of turtles) until I got to L50 then swapped to Satyrs whenever it wasn't crowded and Furbolg rep to honored. Then it was almost entirely BRD Arena/Anger runs from 52-60.
---
15 and 30 minutes? Doubt it, I have spent hours spamming the same macro as this guy and never even seen it once. Shouldn't priests(maybe just Shadow priests) be able to do the Mara solo run? Even if you have to respec, you should be able to farm a few hours and still do a decent profit.
---
Did you not read? I said it was funny the first time.. not by perpetuating the confusion of another player for your own enjoyment you twat waffle.
---
BFG from the Doom original soundtrack
---
I play a male Tauren warrior. I've played for 15 years. I can't convince my nerd husband to play with me. My entire guild thinks I'm a dude. Classic is a strange time and place. I love it.
---
i find that generally unless the item is broken (recently i looted a +11 int ring for 40 something) you should just vendor. most likely the item will not sell above vendor price, especially when you take into account AH cut on sale and on deposit
---
I'm loving it too!  I expected to enjoy it, but I didn't expect to be sucked back in like I was when I first played back in '05.  It's great.
---
You won't regret it.
---
I'm still a fan of 14/32/5.
---
Disagree. Ninja looters who go against previous agreed upon rules should be outed and people should know of them
---
I don't think I'd ever give a random person 16g and expect to get paid back.
---
oh hey, thats me in there! pyrewood represent!
---
I agree with you, there is much more information conveyed in the chart OP posted compared to the inverse axis. 
---
I don't look at an herb and thing "oh thats 8 seconds away" because its not 8 seconds away. If I use my mount is x seconds away, if I use my epic mount, its y seconds away, if I used travel form its z seconds away. 
---
It makes more sense to do it OPs way to determine what is most efficient for the **distance** you need to travel.
---
I guess the best way to put it is: 
---
Using time instead of distance is silly because your distance won't change depending on the method of travel you use.
---
I've got a question about action economy from a lvl 34 resto druid.
---
So far I feel I've been doing pretty good, baring just my lack of experience in the game.
---
What should I be doing in the early stages of when the tank pulls a mob when nobody needs healing?
---
Should I just stand around and wait, healing only when people need it? Throw out dots and damage while down at the expense of mana?
---
At the moment I'm struggling to find what to do during pulls, especially since mana is something I don't have in spades.
---
Yeah silk goes for 40s on my server.
---
People are risking a deposit to sell stuff for vender prices.
---
I had 5 stacks at 45s and only sold one stack in a 24hr period (and yes I do buy any under 2s just to vender).
---
Heavy leather is a bit better as it settles closer to 1.75 (when vender is 1s 50c) but if I don't sell one stack it still eats the profit of 3 sold auctions so I dont bother.
---
I was visiting SM on an extended vacation so I wouldn't know personally, haha
---
Just saying "reasonable people do this" isn't an argument. I can say "reasonable people" do anything. 
---
Why would a reasonable person waste their time on a game when they could do something actually productive?
---
Ignore him, he makes no sense. It's a tough call - do you have anything (friends, guild etc) tying you to your current server? Losing 5 days /played now is better than quitting forever because you've sunk 50 days /played later and refuse to re-do such a big investment. There's literally nothing to do but raid log and alts for people who rushed and are past prebis at this stage, so it's not like you would be at a huge disadvantage for p2/p3. Maybe it would be an opportunity to join up with friends, too?
---
I played on a tiny minority faction in classic, and life was misery. Questing sucked. Getting to raids sucked. Gathering sucked. Anything outside a city was difficult - and through no fault of my own other than a random server name selection. 
---
Third issue would be whether payed xfers will ever come? I don't think it's clear, and maybe it's best not to bank on them being introduced only for them to be deemed too dangerous to server stability.
---
With all that said, bear in mind that with layers and inaccurate data you may be tricked into thinking your server is much more screwed than reality. When you're questing to you actually feel outnumbered 5 to 1?
---
My 60 warrior was also 17d.  My alt priest and shaman were like 6 or 7d.  I always wondered what on earth I was doing to waste that much time.
---
It's not really up for discussion.
---
&gt;No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
How is health funnel a waste of gold? Nevermind the negligible amount of gold it takes to train it, its utility is quite evident while levelling and it opens up for a lot of fun times attempting to solo hard content.
---
I wouldn't mind achievements. It gives people something else to do with little to no reward, as in it wouldn't break anything currently in game.
---
I’m 42, still no mount lol
---
If the tank would let me get mana before pulling shit, that would be great 👍🏻
---
I had a LAN party for my bachelor party. A tribute to the our single days (I was the last of the group to get married).
---
Lol, hilarious this happens today.  Someone made a post a little bit ago, asked a question, that I answered.  Was the answer he was looking for, helped him out.  He deletes his post.  I asked him why and he said “I got my answer”.  A post that may have helped someone in the future isn’t there anymore now.
---
Mods may be deleting posts, but not always.  Sometimes people are just selfish assholes.
---
It is settled in that a program that inputs multiple actions based on a single user input is typically banned. Input broadcasting and remapping keys to mouse buttons are hardly comparable.
---
OP GIVING THE SALT HE CANT TAKE HIMSEF LOL
---
it happened to me like 5 hours ago. i didnt break any eggs but the mobs that aggrod me really didnt care bout their own eggs it seems
---
Some guy does the whole men’s wearhouse ad on my server for devilsaur set. “You’ll love the way you look.  I guarantee it.”
---
Yeah helping people out is fun. Most games really guide/hand hold you to PvP and it's so different to play a game where everyone is so friendly. The two faction system is new to me too, the bit of MMO'ing I've done before it's your guild and EVERYONE else is a potential enemy. You can also effortlessly team up with anyone by just momentarily swapping guilds.
---
I don't know how wanting the option to team up with enemies translates to thinking I shouldn't be on a PvP server. This has gotta be some nonsense that only WoW-shutins think. It makes no sense to me. Lots of the enemies I've gone hard on in games have turned in to great friends too.
---
Probably real simple. 
---
/target npc 
---
/buy whatever the recipe is
---
Is what it is. I would want to know if I was about to run with a ninja looter so I couldn’t be bothered. Glad he was outed
---
Questing is no issue, I'm on a PVE server. I have no reason to be on my current server other than a few level 12s with my fiancee
---
Maybe I read the conversation wrong, but I just read it as them giving advice. I could share some advice for potential ways to make some extra money, if you'd be willing. Some, or maybe all of them you've heard by now, but who knows?
---
Make sure to set your AH listing for 8 hours, get an addon like auctionator that automatically sets the items you list to undercut by the amount you specify, and that takes a LOT of time out of the equation when listing lots of items.
---
I list items en masse (anything i had sent to my bank that day) first thing when I log on in morning or afternoon, and I also list items again before I head off for the night.
---
Consider farming fire elementals that can drop 'elemental fire', the arathi highlands ones are popular, but depending on your level you may find a spot you like more. Elemental fire's can sell for 1.2-1.8g each on my server, you may want to see what it sells for on yours.
---
If you go to the goblin logging camp in STV, the "Goblin Shredder" type mobs have a small chance to drop 'fused wiring'. If you got an hour to burn you may want to farm those if it's an open spot to farm, fused wiring can sell for a few gold, depending on your server.
---
What a great zone. Nothing like getting dinostomped outta nowhere. So many good quests and Gadgetzan is close by.
---
You've called me a loser twice. You've insulted my views and you've told me to stop posting simply because you disagree with me. Also, you have made hurtful assumptions about how I treat most people and worst of all, you've called me boring.
---
You are a hypocritical imbecile and that is all you will ever be.
---
Oof.
---
Boss is taunt immune. He tried intercept, but it didn't go off. Melee range is very big, so not even needed anyway.
---
Lmao dude. Make friends who aren't bad at the game &gt; play with them. I'm tank and befriended a healer and mage, we have quick smooth scholo and strat runs. I hold aggro easy on important shit, let them drink, nice and smooth, everybody happy.
---
I've found in cases where I could have barely saved my VW would have been more effective to just sac the VW and use the bubble to finish off whatever was about to kill it. In that case the mob would be close to dead as well, otherwise I'd be running away and letting my VW take aggro until I was clear.
---
'till the light dies in your eyes
---
Ya thats because someone else bought it without you seeing it. Soloing mara as a priest is pretty meh. Theres tons of ways to get gold this is one that requires you to click buttons and watch a movie. Everyones farm is different. I buy tanks and farm BiS
---
&gt;Why would a reasonable person waste their time on a game when they could do something actually productive?
---
I don't know, chief, why would any reasonable person do anything they enjoy? Have you heard of hobbies?
---
Alliance dogs!
---
Come play on Sulfuras as Horde!
---
Before most of the census Addons were disabled, they also tracked unique character names and their logins. So if they don’t see a character name for 14+ days then it’s considered inactive.
---
Horde has a lot more inactive than alliance, and overall the active player count is slowly declining for both factions but it was fairly even lost time I checked.
---
Like 20k horde vs 18k ally
---
Would you value deilsaur set over epic mount?
---
At least get death coil before you reroll
---
As a 37 warrior with only 30 gold I feel this.
---
All thumpy thumpy

That well known Proclaimers song

Green mobs and quests are your bread and butter as a warrior.
---
Flask of the goose, flat dps increase confirmed.
---
Same. I have a 34, 24, and a 6. This is my first time ever playing, so im just enjoying it and testing out classes.
---
I didn't know there were so many of us.  This is wild.
---
No - DPS
---
havent you asked him why? and what was his answer?
---
It's not about raiding as such, it's quality of life that comes with faction balance. Why would someone put 100 days /played into a server when its 5:1 ratio (if actually true) and they get killed by groups of the opposite faction every 10 minutes, or entering every raid or dungeon takes 3 corpse runs, or it's horrendous to quest or gather? That's not a positive experience and it's completely out of the player's control due to an arbitrary choice they made on launch.
---
Life tap then bandage while your pet has aggro
---
What even is layering? I know there is a banable exploit involving layering but thats about it
---
I insulted your views because they are total horse shit. You're trying to defend toxic attitudes by saying its funny when in reality that player most likely doesn't want to play with the toxic people in said guild. Your character just here on reddit tells me enough about you as a person to sit there and try and defend this type of attitude like everyone around you will think its funny. Im not disagreeing with you. Im straight yp telling you that youre a piece of shit for defending this type of behavior.  Did i make myself clear enough for you?
---
F
---
Plus Druids in forms aren't less intelligent. Whether or not they're familiar would be irrelevant when they should be more than smart enough to figure something out.
---
Just poor in execution lmao...
---
that's awesome, glad you're enjoying it. honestly, druid is the one class I'm kind of afraid to play. there's soooooo many abilities and specs. Sure you will probably specialize in one area, but I feel like the reeaally good druids are able to utilize every tool at their disposal, and that seems a bit too overwhelming to me
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Most classes aren't as bad to level as people hype them up to be. Ultimately, it all comes down to the person. As long as you take it steady, you'll be a-ok.
---
Im a mage and I literally tell ppl this multiple fucking times a run and its kinda annoying that it doesnt get through
---
I have a similar opportunity this weekend, did you spam brd and lbrs or quest?
---
Nice style.
---
Haha what? Dude, you guys on reddit are too much lmao. I love PvP, I love ganking, I love raiding, and questing. I chose to quest to 30, SM Farm to 40, quest to 44, And have ZF farmed to 47.  If you think me doing some AOE runs somehow hinders my PvP ability or my ability to enjoy the game and understand the “vanilla world”, then you’re not fooling anyone and should go troll someone else. I didn’t roll mage to AOE buddy, I rolled mage to PvP, and I do it well. Literally you hopped on this thread to shit on AOE mages because you had a bad experience with them. Don’t take your bizarre logic and apply it to every single person who rolled mage.
---
you're about 55% of the way done. So a little slow but about right for first timers.
---
And why do people do hobbies again?
---
Dang that’s a lot of cloth haha. Thanks for the help
---
I need to post this because I see so many people saying things like "warlocks manage their own health, don't heal them". My God, this is just plain bad advice.
---
Warlock spells, all of them, are vastly less Mana efficient than a mage or other classes. It's easy in many groups, doing max dps, to go through more than half of your mana every single trash pull (often all of it). While warlocks do have tools for dealing with their health, the only one that can even remotely keep up with the rate of usage is drain life, which will significantly lower dps.
---
Warlocks should be life tapping anytime they need Mana and everyone else isn't drinking. If warlocks stopped to drink as often as they needed to, they'd spend every other pull drinking, and that's before considering that they often have more Mana than other classes and it takes them longer to drink.
---
The only time warlocks should not be getting healed is when the tank needs heals more, it's a very heal intensive fight and the healer needs to save Mana, or when the entire party is all waiting and drinking. Else you're just forcing the warlock to do less dps and slowing down the group.
---
One other note. As a warlock, drinking to full takes a while, because I have more Mana than many and because I used more of it on the pull than anyone else. As such, I often lifetap to 50/50, and then both eat and drink. This ends up being faster. Healers, if the lock is already eating/drinking, then don't waste your mana topping them off. Mages, please give warlocks food, in addition to just water.
---
Fair!
---
It’s not 15-30, I can be sure of that. I want to say it’s ~1 hour but I think it may be a bit more complicated.
---
Something like the turtle scale gloves pattern. Where the vendor stocks 1 of their limited supply patterns at random every 20 minutes or so.
---
WHY WE ALL DIE?
---
My voidwalker holds aggro perfectly well and I'm exactly level 25.
---
Possibly a random question but I'm super new to WoW. How far can you realistically progress in dungeons without a dedicated tank?
---
Started playing classic in a group of 4 with some friends.
---
I play a rogue and rest of our group are Mage, Hunter and Priest. So we don't really have a "tank" we have started running dungeons I guess we have done all the typical Low level ones. Deadmines, Stockades, gnomeregan and 2 wings of SM mostly getting through them using CC abilities like Polymorph, mind control, Sap etc. Basically we CC multiple targets and everyone bursts down the primary target. So far seems to be a viable tactic but I am guessing at some point this will cease to work.
---
On this server and I've not seen these guilds, only the 'Moon Tang Clan' sticks out. Horde or ally?
---
None of that is conflicting with the fact that you are a hypocrite and a moron, but okay. Anyway, I'm gonna go sleep now, good night :)
---
Girls don't have dicks.
---
Actually, most people DO play the game like this. You know why? Because it's the most fair.
---
Searched, found it! [Totem of Infliction](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1131/totem-of-infliction), its alliance only.
---
Comments on wowhead seem to say its endgame worthy, but I havnt seen anyone mention it elsewhere. I still have it banked just in case :).
---
Probably because the tauren racial bonus was calculated for the leveling step instead of afterwards for the overall hp. I dinged in 1.7 back in the days, now we have 1.12/1.13.
---
I'm so glad I started lanning in the early LCD days and not the crt ones :p
---
This has just made me want to role a tank even more! but i promised myself i wont role a tank until i get my first mount. which is making me want to grind even more to get my mount to role my warrior!
---
Transcendence
---
A progression raider getting back into the game? He absolutely will regret it, but that's not to say he won't enjoy it ;)
---
Like how you rationalize greed through fairness.
---
I don't get it, does the US education system hammer it into you that time must be on the X axis?
---
I don't care how far I can get in a given time. I want to know how much time it'll take me to get a set distance, that's what this graph tells you.
---
All of your recent comments are negative in the subreddit. Maybe WoW doesn’t bring you joy anymore, maybe the new player base. Regardless. I recommend finding something that does and let the rest of us continue enjoying it.
---
Goodbye gold
---
No you just don't understand context. It's different you suck at reading more then one comment and don't know what context is.
---
Do you believe that everyone that isn't 100% efficient in their *hobbies* is being unreasonable?
---
Azuregeese plural?
---
Because of the AP and the COMPLETE lack of any other trinkets its bis for all damage dealers, even ferals and hunters who get zero use out of the proc. It's a miserable situation because bis is bis, but obviously its much more useful to a melee weapon user.
---
As a hunter, personally I wouldn't roll against a guildie but I would against any pug.
---
Exactly, go away just like i said several comments ago.

Oh, mein Beileid.

So ya, people were getting sick as he said but they didnt go to the hospital. Have you ever had a 24hr gaming sesh? Ya you start to break down from lack of sleep but then you go to sleep and wake up and do it again weeks later. This was a pinnical of hardcore gaming, its going to take some blood sweat and tears. Im all for it. No one questions the athlete who destroys their body and crawls over the finish line and has 3 knee replacements before age 70 if it was worth it. So why not have insane gaming achievements?

You will walk by, do nothing, and then say you savagely wrecked someone irl on a reddit forum.

You are one sensitive and angry individual per your comment history lol
---
I would suggest going Ret 11 points for seal of command. It is a large upgrade from righteousness. You can then put the rest of the points into holy. Grabbing benediction makes your seals and judgements more efficient and reducing the cooldown or judgement is another sos increase.

make sure you turn off auto  attack, takes about 10s to leave combat
---
Tanks also love Windfury!

For all five quests you get a shit ton of xp. The actual stuff you get was only ok
---
/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)
---
A macro that buys the 30th item and in a quantity of 1. 
---
Macros can do so much more than just casting spells. Another cool use of macros can be to run a script that can check if you've completed a quest or not by its ID number.
---
Had a tank today in strat live who couldn’t understand that buffing/rebuffing takes all my mana and I have to drink as a healer between pulls... tanktard is a new word for it
---
Thanks for the thoughtful response. Really clears things up but ill look into all this further to see what spells benefit the most.
---
Cast blind hit escape a few times and run away. Escape is so you can cancel auto attack and actually drop combat. It’s an art to do it in 6 seconds you won’t get it every time on a gouge but you aren’t ever going to do it if you don’t cancel autoattack or combat via the escape key or a macro.
---
Too many times I have ran Dungeons and the Tab button can get me in trouble. Pull an extra pack or take too long to cycle to the right target...you know because I'm lazy. So a request of mine would have the Tab button unbind the action of cycling through nearby enemies. Instead use Tab with a macro that does the same thing but includes /stop attack. How would I go about making a macro such as this?
---
Is this 36% aspect or 30%?
---
It’s not exactly what you are looking for but try Opie. If you hold down a button a wheel of spells  will come up in the middle of your screen and you can move your mouse in the general direction of the spell you want to use to cast it. You can have multiple wheels bound to different hot keys.
---
Its a random spawn timer and ive never heard over 30 minutes. Unless you actually get the NPC to yourself for an hour, which you wont, you could test it. The other issue is if someone gets it, no other player even sees it. I run through thete fearing and going invis just to srive these guys nuts but i know some hc guys who farm WS and go back after buying the pattern every 15 mins. Im sure it CAN spawn that fast. Its also a 1/4 chance to be the runecloth bag pattern.
---
Thats what im rocking right now and its amazing
---
44, still legging it
---
The demons in that zone can drop Felcloth but those are around lvl 50...
---
I recently got the pattern. A macro doesn't work, unless you continually open trade with Qia. I sat there spamming the macro, but failed to buy anything as I didn't refresh my trade. It wasn't until I refreshed my trade with Qia that a pattern appeared. Less than a minute later, another patterned appeared.
---
My recommendation, do it late at night. Watch some netflix and continually open and close trade with Qia.
---
That's great drawing, but Im sorry, I thought it was something related to no fap november LOL
---
You do not need a tank for sm and most lower level dungeons . Honestly it goes smoother if eveyone just dps and shares aggro. Even then if the warrior pulls and everyone focuses the mobs will attack the warrior by dps alone .
---
Now THAT’S immersion

You're going even faster than me honestly, not sure what my /played is but it's gotta be getting up there and I'm only level 22 lol
---
I spend a lot of time fully or partially afk lol, as well as trying to rp (internally, not literally) and keep professions levelled

this totally sounds worth checking out, thanks

Atlas Loot.
---
... you do realise fury is a valid tanking spec, right?
---
I had never seen one until last night, when my party had 2 female orc warlocks, a female orc warrior, and a female orc priest.  It was weird.
---
I mean, part of classic is that certain classes are "best in class" and there are repercussions to that, and we all have to deal with it. It's been 16 years, we all should have gone into this knowing that Mages in vanilla are pretty much across the board the best  class if you strictly sum up all the areas where they provide a "t1" experience. 
---
Leveling, gold farming, single target ranged DPS, AOE, utility, PVP if skilled, CC, general QoL. We all have known this for 16 years -- we know that the wannabe bankers who plan to basically assfuck the entire server's economy always roll Mages, farm their 100g's an hr, and inflate the server massively by controlling the AH on a relatively young server. 
---
We also knew that classic would be a good 20% mages and 18% warriors, because this is how it had always been on pservers.
---
His role in the group was dps, he was not the tank.
---
I NEED that UI space you know
---
Pre-raid bis for Hunters though
---
Bruh. I’m telling ya. I’m 35 with 25 so I’m with ya.
---
I'll get there in 3 months just watch me
---
That's a good tip, thanks!
---
For me (back then) it must have been turning in grey quests, rarely getting good upgrades, almost never doing dungeon runs &amp; quests, maxing out the profs while leveling and especially doing/farming for the mithril/thorium plan quest. Also clueless questing in general. I didn't touch certain areas until late vanilla in terms of quests and grinded way too many mobs for xp or raw gold, got my first mount at 43.
---
Yeah... do me a favor and put time on the x next time
---
Your voidwalker is only useful for sacrificing.
---
I’ve been at qia for over an hour by myself just last night and didn’t see it. What I did see was other patterns spawn every 30 minutes or so. Also I think if you don’t buy the other limited supply patterns it can screw it up. One “supposed” spawn timer eclipsed without a spawn and I think it was cause an already spawned limited supplant pattern went Unpurchased and actually disappeared.
---
This is fine.
---
I’m actually going to do this lol. 
---
Thank you!
---
Lol I thought you were saying that you had to try twice to get the matching screenshot. Was about to ask what went wrong the first time. Grats!
---
I've already explained why I need it. Been playing the game since 2006 and never have I realized this was controversial. You're leaving yourself open to selfish people. If you want to greed after I say in chat ALL NEED, then you just played yourself. Leaving the group is of no consequence, because all dungeons can be cleared with 4 people.
---
You can blast me in /lfg or /2, but I'll have screenshots to prove the loot rules were established before rolls happened and nobody will care.
---
&gt;Greed means you're going to sell it.
---
report him
---
It still sucks up more mana and you won't be able to stay at full health. So despite being faster, there's a trade-off.
---
I dont actually understand what it does
---
No you are wrong. I’ve gotten people reported for need and greed situations and have had action taken against them.
---
I remember that post too. It was a Screenshot from vanilla back in the days.
---
Yes they share the same timer i believe so you must buy the one in there to get a new one.
---
It doesn’t suck up more mana what are you talking about? Also if you’re at full health you’re wasting your time.
---
After 6ish seconds of not attacking or being attacked by a player in ANY way (not just damage but effects, too) combat will drop as long as you aren't in combat with a PVE creature.
---
How about stop treating people like garbage? Ever hear of be the change you want to see?
---
The only thing I've seen you do here in this thread is be a tyrant and say some really mean things about people you don't know.
---
And here you are trying to defend someone from a toxicity that you yourself are so hell bent on perpetuating.

Gooey spider legs. spent an hour and a half killing spider mobs this morning. got 3 gooey spider legs. EACH SPIDER HAS 8 LEGS!!!

You just said loot was based on main spec, not his active role

Why would a reasonable person waste there time on wow as a hobby when they could have a hobby that improves their life?  Like working out, or physical hobbies, or crafting hobbies they could make money off of? Wasting time in a digital fantasy world, for digital fake gear, for higher digital fake numbers, doesn't sound very reasonable to me.
---
Awesome! Couple of us have been trying to run RFD
---
I don't feel particular sympathy for our overlords.
---
Somewhere (probably on photobucket) I have screenshots of the original AQ opening gate for the server I was on.
---
If you view them in order, about 1 every 5-10 seconds, it's likely an accurate recreation of what I experienced that day.
---
Does it just work for dungeon and raid mobs or world too?
---
Well it did get up to two patterns available so maybe it can’t have 3 and that was the issue.
---
Either way the pattern itself does not spawn every 30 minutes.
---
Hard CC like polymorph
---
I think it was more funny the second time.. Third time would have been too much but he fact that someone does the the same action twice with the same outfall is kind of funny. And chill out, there is literally no harm done.

What an appropriate username.

I like all the people trying to take the moral high ground in this thread over a joke while calling people names at the same time.
---
Hunters were super popular the first time around, and super trollzy if bad. This time most people just won't go hunter because "they fall off after BWL and no guild will take me" - every hunter I've talked to is someone who actually played hunter and is playing it for the fun. Because we all know, it's never going to be great DPS, and that's fine. 
---
I think mage meta will stay, because we do 100% know that Mages remain really fucking good -- and as a bonus, they are (IMHO) one of the best designed classes with a complete arsenal of cool spells that synergize and reflect the skill of the player. Because the class is actually deep and rewarding, and also really fucking good, I see no reason we'll shift from a "Mage meta". Hunters are great on fresh servers, as are Mages, but Mages age like fine wine and really hit their stride in PVE when they can spec fire.
---
Many people don't seem to understand this and for some it seems like they simple don't WANT to understand it.
---
One of the most frequent "complains" I see here is about having to walk/travel huge distances for quests. Well, maybe think just 3 more seconds about it. Those quests obviously aren't supposed to be accepted, walk over, complete. It's more about combining several quests so you actually have a "path of work" that let's you complete several quests while at the same time reaching that one far away point for that one quest.
---
The overall slower pace of the game is what helps to make it actually feel like your part of/interacting in a WORLD rather than having levels.
---
Noob
---
I alrdy stated its a random spawn timer, and they do in fact share loot tables. You cant have all 4 random recipes in there at once. The only way you wouldve been able to test it correctly is if u bought them instantly and stayed for a while to keep seeing when respawns came
---
ez thro dynamite is your friend.
---
I mean I'm not doubting you, I just remember also seeing that YouTube pulled it and the thinning 2 because of it. But I liked the thinning, decent B list movie, never saw the second though
---
You have an uneven stack in your bag, so it’s splitting the two made into another stack.
---
I'm a great priest though
---
The harm done is the people trying to defend the behavior of several people in the guild perpetuating the issue the player has with no help at all. Thats the problem. Thats what im posting about.
---
No, I'm calling him bad for very good reason.

Sorry to offend you because your favourite streamer is a hack.

---
The distance to an object doesn't change. The time changes depending on the method you use. They put the independent variable (distance) on the x axis, and the dependent variable (time) on the y.
---
What's the typical cost for a Fiery Weapon enchant?
---
Pretty sure it’s because you had 19 and it finished a stack and started a new one
---
Had someone in my guild in that spot, they buy all skills and buy gear off AH.
---
I know, that's why you gotta use a rotation. In FFXIV only tank I had levelled was DRK, and you could either use Abyssal Drain for ranged AoE threat or w/e the darkness one was around you. There was basically no end to the amount of mobs you could tank.
---
as a reasonable person, I'm going to stop replying to you. You're clearly hysterical spamming replies. I'm sorry you're a mental midget.
---
Warlock: is this some joke im to rich to understand?
---
Im bent on perpetuating it? Sitting here calling out assfucks like you and others in my comment chain that are trying to defend the toxicity by letting it continue more than several times. Help the player. Stop being a piece of shit.
---
My Paladin is 38.9 and just hit 4 days and 5 hours. The 30s bracket is soooo bad for leveling
---
That's the bitter truth. Lots of people don't like leveling and just want to raid and pvp at 60, but someone bored by 16 probably isn't going to get there.
---
Ya gear off the AH will do that lol.
---
Too alliance dominated don’t wna go there sry
---
what is this? ive never heard of it
---
wtf, that's not fair!
---
ROFL me too
---
Yeah, it's just an example of how you can take a player out of retail, but you can't take retail mentality out of a player. If you wanted to AOE cleave down an instance, reset it, aoe it down, reset it, and do this to negate a whole level bracket... I hear Blizzard made a game that lets you do just that.
---
I rolled on deviate delight one of the two RPPVP servers I had no idea if the other one needed to be merged into us or not but i haven’t noticed any change. I haven’t had to wait for a group to form for longer than 10 mins or anything what most would think a low pop server would be like. No idea why so many people decide not to utilize the RP servers but that is okay with me. It’s not like you have to RP, however it is pretty fun and keeps the grind fresh.
---
You dont need full mana before the tank pulls, and you can be drinking while hes pulling.
---
Cheers dude
---
They all know that...
---
Priest.
---
You can't engage in an honest argument, but I'm the mental midget. lol
---
Skeram? Or are there multiple geniuses doing this?
---
respect ur opinion but i gotta disagree, pre 40 a warrior is basically doing only auto attack damage, herioc strike is one of the worst attacks for dps. paladins out dps warriors at lower levels as they not only have seals that make up damage but also judgements, amd paladins arent exactly a dps class.
---
one really really bad thing warriors have for them is that they are 100 percent tied to their weapon, as other classes have abilities that dpnt really require a weapon to be effective (spells, evicerate, pets etc)
---
on top of that they have the most downtime of any class and their rage mechanic works against their own downtime. sitting down to eat wastes rage, meaning fights start at lower dps. you could use all the rage on execute but execute is often wasted if you dump more than the required rage
---
they are the only class that starts off with low dps because of how rage works, whereas any other class can unload immediately
---
God, feign death is the worst for me when I'm a healer. All I see is the hunter suddenly dropping dead and I'm like "oh god, that wasn't my fault, was it?".
---
Not true, you just have to manage it. Threat Meter and patience m8. If starting at full mana what you can do is send VW, give it a few seconds, apply dots, then engage a 2nd mob and fear + dot it, then just wand them both down. All depends on lvls and gear to be sure tho. Most of the time you simply plan the damage so that the void loses aggro right as the mobs about to die.
---
Every comment here is discussing an hourly salary of 16.50
---
HUnters in 2006 were just kids who thought it was a cool class (it was) and they weren't good at video games.
---
Mages this time around are people who just want to play the OP train and zerg down content like it's retail -- some are, I assume, good people, but the majority have to go back to retail.
---
yeah I would say rogue is worse

I was just wondering the same. I’m level 37 and have like 25g, and that’s training most abilities as a Druid and leveling all my professions (mostly recipes for cooking and alchemy). How can you have such little gold?
---
Of course it does. Drain Life isn't a free spell.
---
Better now than never
---
Tbh aff is all you needed so far anywho
---
I was looking for this exact thing yesterday, thank you!
---
yeah u totally won that bro nice one
---
i clearly have a lot to learn about wow macros. TO THE INTERNET TO LEARN MORE!!!
---
*flies away to learn*
---
5 people spend the same amount of time in an instance. An item that everyone can use drops. Everyone gets the same odds to roll on that item and benefit from it. And that's "greedy"? You're delusional kiddo.
---
is there a reason for all the gnome hate? it’s definitely a staple of the community, but why?
---
No
---
While in dungeons leveling you should use the best 1h weapon you have
---
I just trade for them. By the time you're ready to turn this quest in you'll have multiple duplicates. Trade the dupes for ones you need, gg.
---
I just hate that it has moved to other places too. There is a Shadowrun tabletop rpg subreddit and just the other day someone referred to characters as toons.
---
Seem pointless to me personally, will speed up levelling an inch then slow you down a meter at 40
---
Oh man it hurts my feelings you said something like that! Omg nice one duuuude. Nice comment. It sucks so bad that you got me here with that comment.
---
Since these are lower level mobs, would Elemental precision even help at this point?  they make it seem like the lower level mobs all just have 1% chance.  But there is a 100% definite difference between those BRD dwarves and the ZF mobs.  
---
In BRD, pulling anything over 10 mobs, I would bet you get resisted more than 35% of the time.  Possibly even more.  Rarely get a resist when pulling ZF zombies.
---
You’re toxic and unable to recognize your own toxicity lol.  Your sarcastic apology in lieu of any attempt at actual justification of your actions is also toxic.  You trolls on here deserve each other.  Enjoy
---
Zandlar Tribe represent!
---
It's /r/deepfriedmemes
---
Sounds like you're over-extending. Many classes struggle to survive 2 mobs attacking them, let alone handling three and only needing to eat/drink.
---
Why not just use the totem manager add-on?
---
I would def agree with this. I think it's pretty engaging too, and while my priest is a lot easier to level, I have more fun with my warrior. Although, my priest always has a lot more money than my warrior, but who needs money when you're the thiccest of them all (beef &lt;3)
---
The arguments have been made a million times already. You aren't running a dungeon for a random boe you're running for the bops. The boes are a bonus and can be used to get gear for anybody. Next time just skip repeating the same tired shit and just answer "the latter".
---
Distance in this case IS the independent variable. OP got this one right.
---
Time is dependent on what distance the question is.
---
You are asking if it is faster to go to the mail box by running or mounting up or in simple terms, which method of travel goes "insert distance here".  Distance is your independent variable. Maybe it is 50 yards, maybe it is 75 yards, maybe it is 100 yards. It doesn't matter. It is the distance between 2 set points. Time is your dependent variable, it is dependent on the distance you are looking for and it will be different for methods of travel.
---
In order for time to be the independent variable you would be standing in one spot asking "how far do I go in 10 seconds" to try and figure out if it is faster to walk or mount to go to the mailbox. At this point you would realize that you now need to use your Y-Axis as the independent variable (distance) because you made your graph wrong.
---
Bah you are definitely correct. Oh well, will leave it if anyone else should need.
---
I’m Horde on Smolderweb, it’s high pop but no queues.  Not sure what the faction balance is like, but I run into alliance every time I go questing, so that’s a good sign
---
Which addon allows me to move that little information window (currently popping up in the bottom right) when I hover my mouse over an NPC, Friendly or Enemy?
---
You can call people out without being a complete assfucknutprick piece of shit.
---
And yes, you are very clearly bent on perpetuating it as you have responded to almost every single person to respond to you with unnecessary toxcitity.

Do you not see that you are being toxic?

You shouldn't roll need on items you don't need but want to sell. That's what the GREED button is for. You are being a greedy asshole for needing stuff you don't actually need. That's the bottom line.
---
Only on white attacks. Yellow attacks carry the same miss rate.
---
&gt; No. Because gold didn't drop. An Epic item did.
---
If that epic item is a BoE, then it's literally just gold.  It has a free-market value, and that value is the same for every member of the party.
---
&gt; Are you saying that if there was no longer a such thing as BoP? If every item drop was now just a BoE? 
---
I'm really not sure what you're even trying to say.
---
I've been trying to explain the obvious difference between BoE and BoP loot rules.  So obviously I see the difference.
---
BoE items are just a bag of gold.  There's no wasted potential by giving it to whoever happens to win the roll.  That's why everybody should roll need on BoE items.
---
BoP items are different.  They lose a *lot* of potential if they're taken to be vendored, as opposed to equipped.  That's why need/green exists for BoP items.
---
I don’t do random dungeons with hunters anymore. Tired of their misbehaved pets and “needing” everything.
---
I was having a tough time finding one for classic
---
I’m still amazed that someone keeps screenshots  from years ago. Since then I had 4 different computers, different HDDs and I reinstalled windows dozen times.
---
SkarmTank on YouTube put out a video showing that dual wield tanking in Fury COULD be done if you are high skill and have the perfect balance of consumables and a raid team patient enough to put up with this special snowflake shit long enough for you to get it down.   That does not mean you SHOULD do it because at the end of the day it's high risk, high effort, high cost, high stress, and accomplishes literally nothing that traditional tanking doesn't.
---
He is an expert tank, probably world class, and has deep deep gold pockets.  Is that you?  Realistically, will that ever be you?  If not, stick to the original recipe.
---
I second fairbanks.
---
I never had a problem with my voidwalker holding Aggro all the way to level 60 (on 2 private servers and now classic) just make sure you level his taunt and do som occasional micromanaging. 
---
There is a strong argument to be made for succubus post 40 though and I think it’s more efficient overall.

I think adding expansions would defeat the purpose. I talked to my brother about this specifically when he made fun of me for not having my mount yet.

I go off this list here: https://progameguides.com/wow/wow-classic-dungeon-levels/

Generally if you're healing you can go in a few levels early. If you're tanking I try to be at least 1 or 2 higher than the lowest.
---
Phase two you’ll have insta bg queues. R14 ez

Why would you need the default backwards walk to position a mob? You can use strafe + mouse to essentially walk backwards at full speed while maintaining frontal mitigation. It's at an angle, but that isn't really an issue.
---
Using the same strafe + mouse and adding in jump allows you to go backwards while maintaining full forward speed + frontal mitigation. Takes a bit more micro than just holding down S but the benefit is good.  Very useful for getting through a bunch of mobs without getting dazed, like a cave.
---
Rektd.
---
Yeah not sure how that’s a shit guide
---
On the twitch mod page search for totem and you should find it, I would link but my internet is RIP right now.
---
Up until about level 20 it kind of like playing through a very long tutorial. You will learn new spells and have more things to do as you level up. The game really shines when you group up with people and do one of the dungeons or take out a tough enemy. Also at level 16 you probably haven't ran into any world PvP.
---
There is a lot to look forward to but you aren't quite there.
---
But you are close. Don't give up.
---
why would you even do that
---
... How'd you manage to log in?
---
Well there’s some items early on that were fetching good money at one point. Silver ore was MUCH more valuable than bars for a long time. At one point each silver ore was selling at close to 70s on my server while the bars were only 10s. Sold all the silver I mined and now they’re only 8s a piece on the AH. Same with lesser moonstones. They were 40-50s a piece but now they hang around 8s a pop too. I flipped a blue ring I sniped for 12s on the AH for 12g. I’ve probably made close to 20g so far just flipping blues on the AH with no addons, just watching the market. Picked up a level 25 bearded bone axe for 45s and decided to keep it and use it on my warrior tank because I’ve had good luck so far.
---
Classic is Classic.
---
It's identical to goblin helmet right?
---
Dual wield tanking is for when you are geared and your raid is fighting you for threat and your healers are geared and you can afford to take significantly more damage to do more threat. You need hit rating for a start, and you need enough crit rating that you actually crit, often.
---
Put your shield on. You will get stomped in Sunken Temple, BRD and the rest of the 50-60 dungeons.
---
At level 50 in shitty quest gear with your whole party in shitty quest gear, you just wear what you have and tank in the spec that you are.
---
People are dumb as hell.
---
Duel wielding means more times to miss which mean take more damage. Arms can spec into more 2hnd options that will help quicken combat taking less damage
---

The built in snapshot tool in Windows 10 might be pretty good now, but I’ve been using Greenshot for awhile and love it. I think it’s Alt+PrntScrn that takes a full screen screenshot, but I mostly just hit PrntScrn which brings up a crosshair so I can select a small section of the screen.
---
Just click and hold while you drag the selection, release, and the screenshot is saved to C:\Users\me\Pictures\Greenshot, opens in Greenshot, and is copied to clipboard so I can do a quick Ctrl+V wherever.
---
I use this ALL the time for productivity. It’s fast and easy to get lots of little screenshots of things I’m working on as a reference.
---
ERP is literally glorified sexting.
---
Stormwind is more convenient for accessing the zones the majority of the casual playerbase is currently levelling through. They'll all start trickling their hearths to Ironforge as they approach 60.
---
I can't hear your threat issues over my spellcleave.
---
Using immolate is not good I cringe when I see people spam it.
---
I remember seeing Taurens on the mechstriders back in vanilla. How do you get reputation for the opposite faction?

you're being dumb on purpose right?

Don't listen to him. Warriors are bad.

Dear tanks: Learn how to pull and equip a fucking shield so you don't melt like an ice cream cone on the sun. 
---
- Your healer
---
Really though, everyone needs to chill out. If the dungeon run takes five more minutes but isn't a shit show, how is that a bad thing?
---
Or you go full PvP and melt faces with honor gear
---
We all say that because we're right.
---
You can take the item to the AH and convert it to gold.   You can then use gold to buy something else of equal value.  The two things easily convert between each other.
---
Saying "BoE's aren't gold!" is like saying "Ice isn't water!"
---
So when gold drops in the form of a BoE, everybody deserves to roll on it, because everybody helped kill the mobs that made that loot item drop.
---
It's selfish and greedy to take loot from your party for no reason, when everybody in the party could use it.
---
&gt; it's a usable piece of equipment that a level 40, e.g., will likely use until they're 60.
---
And if the bow gets sold for an epic sword, that rogue could be using that item between levels 40 to 60.
---
Do you get it now?
---
Honestly, dude, you're part of the problem.
---
Lvl 50-60 zones are going to be an absolute shitshow in phase 2. I'm just hoping I'm 60 before p2
---
If you want to play that way it's fine. You'll just never convince anyone thinking logically that it is more fair than rolling need on lower level BoEs.
---
Do you mean omen of clarity? Because natures grasp isnt a proc its a self cast
---
I rolled orc for the stun resist in pvp. I find it way more useful than on a 2min cd. Seeing as warriors and rogues target casters first, its a huge advantage.  And i love the male cast animation over the male undead
---
It's always one of the most reliable ways, instance farms for vendor trash are just too consistent
---
As lock it rocks, you can VW tank bosses and hellfire AoE mobs
---
I lost my innocence in Diablo 2 as well.  I want to join a guild, but you had to download a chat program.  I did, and then all my items started dropping in the ground ☹️
---
Never again
---
I’d not thought of that one. As a kid I assumed it was because when you pressed return, you were often asking the computer to return a result based on what you entered. A URL, username/password, that sort of thing. Never gave it another thought :)
---
&gt; This is not against the rules because if I press the "1" button, all it's doing is pressing "1" on each client. One input to one action.
---
What you described is one input to five actions, though.
---
Yeah, a level 60 mace isn't really what I was getting at
---
Oldschool runescape is not RS Classic.
---
Worldchat spammer Hunting being useful finally
---
Im part of the problem for defending the player who doesnt understand what is happening while the rest of you laugh and think its funny that the players confusion is being perpetuated by toxic guild mates? Ya buddy im the problem.
---
&gt; Edit: To add, even if it is Rofo's run, and all 4 of his group mates are guildies, you STILL HIT NEED because you can then trade the item to the person that you think deserves it, and it negates any fuckery happening at all.
---
Exactly.  You roll need, and then if you win it, you can decide whether or not you want to be generous and give it away or not.
---
Hi. My brother can’t play much as he has a newborn, but we saw your posts and thought it could be a way for him to squeeze in some game time.
---
We got it to work on his iPad but there’s a lot of frame rate choppiness and game crashing issues. Do you know how we could go about troubleshooting this? This could make the difference of him being able to play or not,haha. We have a plan to level by dungeoning and he’ll heal on mobile! Thank you for the idea either way.
---
Congrats. How do you still have so much gold
---
It’s fine, the guy was mildly inconvenienced
---
Why would you get arcanite bars before p2. With dm release the price will fall. So I would say it can be too early to get the mats :D
---
Your argument defies logic of the game itself that literally has the need and greed buttons designed specially for this.
---
other plants\*
---
I think you should consider the damage before you start talking like that and getting so angry. I get your point honestly, but you are reacting to maybe a 3 minute interaction in a video game between anonymous people (not that it necessarily justifies it). You have no idea if one or more of the guildmembers helped him right after.  And its still pretty harmless. So what? He went to desktop a few times. You are overreacting in a very childish way.
---
goblin helm has a 20 min cd but yeah otherwise
---
Bro those T1 shoulders are sexy on orcs. I want people to see those and tremble.
---
It makes you a bad player to play with. The game is a team game. It’s not all about you. That is his point. What if I rolled a shaman and I refused to help heal in any dungeon because it’s not part of my class fantasy. Does that make me a bad player? Yes it does, people don’t want to play with selfish players.
---
Thanks =)
---
Runescape is not a new mmo lmao
---
Health funnel is great in PVP?
---
Just because it's not bannable (money talks) doesn't make it not an unfair advantage. Other games have banned it for this very reason, but Blizzard is too greedy to do that.
---
cool thanks for the help guys, I think I will go for the bloodrobes, will be cool to do a class quest and get a special item at the end! and after that ill just wait till i can craft myself some shadoweave.
---
Thanks!
---
:\^)
---
Haha, no prob. Enjoy it!
---
Oof
---
Don't lie. You cook mystery meat at the crib too, huh?
---
The worst are pally tanks who think that they can tank but they can't. I haven't met a single pally tank yet who can hold aggro from my heals.
---
Loving this. Thanks for sharing. Gz brudda.
---
Shit people do shit things.
---
What kind of garbage attitude is this? Tank is a god or what?
---
I bet you are a priest that shields warriors on pull and also shields warlocks the second they life tap, and then complain you have no mana.
---
I was considering transferring there. Now I'm not.
---
My advice from a super high pop server (whitemane) is stop grinding at the well known spots, or try to control the spawns. I'd always pick one section of the farm/murloc camp to basically pee on and lay claim. As long as I could get more than 5 in a pull I was happy to wait for respawns. You can also try layer swapping by asking guildies/trade to invite you, I've had pretty good luck going from a contested spot to an empty spot doing that.
---
Dude get another hobby. Like hobby lobby. You hate gays bro?
---
Saturation at low level might be true, but I'd be surprised if a significant chunk of those players ever reach 60. Even fewer of those are going to be tanks.
---
Exactly.
---
No, I press 1 button and it presses the 1 button. That's one action.
---
Honestly, the lengths people go to to try to make people seem evil or like cheaters for multiboxing while ignoring the plain facts that it's been stated over 15 years by Blizzard employees  that it's not is pretty ridiculous. You don't agree? Cool. That doesn't change the facts.
---
What arent you getting here? Im posting because the player forcefully made the player do the same thing when they didnt know what or why it was happening? Its those kinds of people  that carry that mentality to the real world. Excuse me for calling out toxic behavior with words that you may not find suitable for general conversation.
---
Holy shit, lucky AF
---
I'm mad jelly
---
RIP you.
---
Actually it’s both at the same time. Schrodingers Warrior
---
ya im pretty sure you got it all wrong bud.  It gets funnier each and every time.  Its an exponential function.
---
Ever thought about taking a gun to school?
---
Im an idot lol, i assume youre talking about if you dont get the improved version
---
I did the same thing. Was about the same level too when I realized I had tons of spells I should of trained for long ago.
---
That sucks. If you're nice enough to give 16g you're deffo nice enough to be the sort of person who would be extremely grateful to receive it. 
---
It sucks when you experience things that make you realise that not everyone is so nice. I passed on a BoE twink item to help someone towards their mount and they just left the group...its unfortunate.
---
Anyone happen to know which server this is?
---
Believe I used to play with this guy on Silvermoon EU.
---
Sure but then locks still lifetap to 10% health and start using hellfire on the next pack, there's some terrible locks out there, and they're doing less damage than the tank, it's like carrying a player sometimes....
---
So in classic the only want to get a flight point in Moon Glade is to be a Druid?
---
warlocks are just shit mages only useful for summoning dont ever think otherwise
---
forreal fam.
---
Every year.  ONCE AND FOR ALL
---
He stopped his auto-attack at 1:06 and restealthed at 1:13.  Can't drop combat (and restealth) if you don't stop your auto-attack.
---
2 different rings... ones for twinks
---
LOL!
---
If you create some sort of a complicated Arduinio/camera/emulated keyboard setup and use it to automate fishing for you, that's still botting and bannable. The exact same logic should apply here: it's irrelevant whether you're doing it through software or hardware, you're still gaining an unfair advantage over other players.
---
"But Blizzard tolerates it!" is a moot argument when the entire point is that Blizzard are a bunch of money-grubbing hypocrites for not banning multiboxing.
---
Wow, your are 60 and no mount with skinning and herbalism. I don't know where to start. Best bet easy way to get groups is tank, but tanking fury is hard unless you have some decent gear. Find a guild that needs fury warriors for raids and will help run dungeons to get pre raid gear. Or just look for groups running the dungeons you need gear from. On the money front I don't get it, I'm 53/54 warrior. I bought my mount at 40 and now sitting on nearly 300G. You can farm herbs and skin things then sell that on AH, also farm those skinnable things that provide food you can cook that's profitable. Lots of meats can be cooked and vendors for a good price, for example most things in top end cooking require one meat one seasoning and a stack of twenty vendors for 60s+. Good luck.
---
When I finally get my mount in 1 more level I'll be mounting up to go from the AH to the mailbox.
---
I’ve at least got my engineering up and have plenty of explosives to use, my main concern is hitting the bosses, but maybe being a human with a mace it will help a bit too. May put it off til tomorrow anyway though
---
I'm just scrolling down this thread, listening to people bitch at each other.
---
You're adding toxicity where it doesn't belong, therefore you are part of the problem. Context doesn't even matter here, being an asshole to someone is still being an asshole regardless of the reason.
---
I 100% agree with you that there's a bunch of other toxicity, but this kind of "they're being assholes so i'll be an asshole too" mentality is a lose-lose situation. 
---
Be the bigger guy. Call people out where they deserved to be called out. You can get the message across while still being polite. The people scrolling through the thread later, like me, will thank you for taking the high road. Seriously, watching two people bitch at each other is frankly disgusting.
---
How? You could have just opened the old screenshot first, to have it be on the left...
---
And if shit hit the fan, you can actually solo him as a lock if you know the kite path.
---
Note about HoT on tank while pulling, Does hots applied before pull generate threat after he aggro something?
---
If so, i guess why it was changed to not on retail.
---
Both.
---
Maybe there should be a button for “Need and Bind”. It still rolls, but it binds to the winner. Avoid ninja for sale. Perhaps “Need” should just bind be default, whereas greed does not. After all, a Need roll should mean you fully intend to use it, and binding make sense.
---
Greed would always be there for sale of items.
---
I just shove star rubies up my ass
---
What addon are you using that gives you that info bar at the top of the screen?
---
im 41 and have 23 silver so...
---
Yea, so much in fact that their comments are more of a joke and way funnier than OP's image and joke.
---
Lmao what the hell?
---
Get over yourself. You are wrong and you will always be wrong. Your argument was lost 20+ years ago when people were doing it in DAoC.
---
Goodbye
---
Amplify curse isnt a target debuff.
---
If the healer is drinking and the lock just stands there waiting that seems stupid too
---
Being called a toxic piece of shit isnt fun is it?  Either is laughing at some one else's misfortune which is EXACTLY what this thread is aiming to do.
---
Maybe, I don't know. It's a common comment at game subs. I remember while playing Hearthstone the sub had dozens of posts simillar to this one a day, and you always had people asking the posters not to clog the sub with trash. I think it really comes down to how people perceive what is desirable content.
---
yea with the same stats. thats nothing that special. There are items same quality that are better then the one that rec higer lvl. like  mail pants that give 5 stam and rec lvl 15 and mail pants that gives 3 stam and re. lvl 18
---
What professions have you sitting pretty at 500g?
---
This guy is too galaxy brained for me. I tap out.
---
I believe there are separate non-Druid flight masters to the south.
---
Iirc you still need the exalted riding skill of the city to use each specific pvp mount.
---
I think the most interesting thing about this screenshot is that you only have like 20 skills showing. Or is that just how rogues play?
---
I'm going Goblin and buying the Gnomish trinkets, cba to lvl Gnomish first then drop to re-lvl  Goblin which is necessary for the mortars
---
Same! I've got a 40, 34, 33, 24, 20, and three 11-13s. Going to level every class is my aim!
---
I feel absolutely fantastic leveling as an Ambush/Backstab dagger Rogue. Sure, I believe people when they say Combat is the 'fastest', or the 'optimal' leveling spec.
---
But oh boy I couldn't be more certain that I wouldn't have nearly the amount of fun with such a spec as I am having now.
---
I have no downtime against mobs, over half of the strongest hitting abilities i use crit, finishing the fight in seconds.
---
Most of all, the PvP side of things is flat-out amazing.
---
I've reached the point where I'm almost ungankable. To kill me, you really have to catch me already fighting to have a decent chance. Not to brag, I'm no PvP god, but I'm getting a shit ton of practice done in STV now.
---
Me, on the other hand, I can kill anyone I see pretty much. Only Mages aren't kill on sight as I'm afraid of them. The stars have to align a fair bit for me to take them down.
---
I pity min-maxing Combat Swords Sinister Strike spamming unhappy sods. I prefer playing my Rogue as a Rogue, not a Warrior knock-off.
---
Hands of power, 85kills still no gloves
---
Ah my bad. Does it trigger the global cooldown?
---
Not an argument, multibotter.
---
Shammys get it too, but ours requires fish scales. Soooo I guess I'm gonna keep a stack of that in the backpack until forever.
---
I got myself into an argument because I rilled and won a +spell damage item as a holy priest. +Healing gear is hard to come by and most BiS list I've seen include +spell damage gear even for healing because there's no alternative.
---
It was a definite upgrade for me but the 2 mages seemed to disagree with me. Who was right, then? I'm fresh 60.and I have no idea how to gear up if I pass on all the +spell.damage gear
---
Plenty of Russians fled the toxic community and horrible translation of the Soviet realms (which is forced upon them, you can't drop onto a Russian realm and switch interface to English). But then, all my German friends play on German servers, so I guess that's not a big deal there. Not sure about other countries.
---
Laughing at your misfortune; you're more of a joke than the alt+f4 trick OP posted.
---
Pretty rude to highjack his thread, don't you think?
---
I'm trying to say that spending an entire pool of mana to get less than 400 back is very bad mana regen, but I guess a little simple math is beyond you :)
---
Not sure why you got downvoted but this is correct. They both give the same amount of AP while the hinterlands trinket ALSO gives 1% hit.
---
Amazing thanks for taking time to share!
---
"look" more like randomly loot.
---
As a vanilla player all those years ago, your assessment matches mine. I was 20 years old then. 15 years later- now 35, marriage/kids, I find a lot to enjoy in classic and retail WoW, but yes, my hardcore raiding days are well behind me.
---
be glad you're not part of the competitive super smash bros melee community
---
How ever long it takes for two taunts, and i generally have him tanking 2 or 3 mobs at a time. Just get 2 taunts per mob. Corruption, agony, drain life, i cleared the tiger, and panther mastery quests in stv in literally 1 pull per quest, no down time for mana, proper health mitigation with dots. Voidy is strong, its just faster and more dps to use succi, i use succi primarily, but when i get to kill × amount of × i just pull voidy out so i can systematically deletw them with curses.
---
Except using CC to get backstabs in means you're getting damaged less which means less downtime.
---
Sure, Combat might be faster overall as a leveling spec, but I'm sure if played right dagger Ambush/Backstab specs are super viable too.
---
Wait till you find out how plate wearers benefit more from strength than they ever will from agility.
---
It actually takes longer. Cause grp xp is worse. It is faster than leveling 5 different toons separately.
---
My top comment in the chain is downvoted so no one else sees it. What are you getting at? You still have nothing to add to this other than "hAh YoUrE a JoKe!! LoL got him good!"
---
The internet is alright sometimes hahaha.
---
I literally type this every run to avoid problems.
---
Your beverages are more important than dps, finish them.
---
I won't pull something that will kill me if healer is drinking.
---
Yeah my chat was already muted by a GM pending review apparently. I was only doing it for like 30 minutes. I have a clean record so hopefully I don't actually get banned lmao
---
How often do the casters ever get hit in a dungeon if they don't have aggro? If I'm that low and taking damage before I can get any health back I'm going to healthstone. 
---
We are specced to be able to handle that. We can heal ourselves.
---
First off the Helmet from SM is BoP and dosen't apply to the topic
---
Second the reason people all should roll need on BoE's is it prevents ninjas but also (especially the case in expensive BoEs) whats the difference between a tank rolling that can equip it right there and a mage rolling to then sell and buy a BoE cloth item thats the same value? esentially both people are rolling for a BoE item just one has to go through the AH.
---
Also ninjas arn't always of a different class for example some people will take BoE's they already have in their bags or equiped and hope nobody notice so they can sell it and still look like they equiped it. In other cases people will take it and simply not equip it on the spot in which case people won't even care to check if it's a blue item and they don't know it has a decent value on the AH and just assume it's a cheap BoE.
---
horde retard
---
Actually being human with mace or sword does give you a bonus. Like you said, the main problem you'll have is threat generation and rage generation due to the misses. You'll also be getting hit harder, putting a strain on the healer. That wouldn't be too bad if they are a bit overleveled though.
---
FWIW i tried SM cath last night at level 37 and a 40 healer. We nearly got mograine and whitemane down even though I'm 5 levels under them and wasn't planning on going there until lvl 39. We had some low level dps that was also struggling to get damage through. It was close, but we ultimately failed to down the boss.
---
Titan Panel
---
yes, giving everyone a fair chance to benefit from work they've done is greedy. I actually can't tell if you're just trolling me now or not.
---
It's the circle of life, and it moves us all, through despair and hope, through faith and love, 'till we find our place, on the path unwinding
---
I genuinely thought you meant the Golden Joystick Award promo and was cackling. It took me a minute to see what you meant!
---
That hasn’t happen to me yet. Mostly because I’m the guy looting the chest
---
Could you please tell me what addon you are using to show your health and mana numbers over your bar? I've been looking for one like this for weeks.
---
27 years old here and played vanilla from 2006(?) and quit 2010 (when 85 was released I believe). My lock was 58 when BC came out and I loved that content but never got to do 60 raids. Then being young at the time wasn’t able to do 70 raids beyond pugs until WotLK when I was one of the first rogues on the server DWing the blue swords from Eye of Eternity. 
---
I think WoW was still good at 70 and to a lesser extent at 80 but the freebie epics and increased number of BoE high ilvl gear killed the feeling of “proud” players had in regards to hard to obtain gear. 
---
The arena gear at 70 was awesome though, and arena was my favourite pvp experience. So I think if WoW progresses at the same rate as previously I’ll stick around until prior to WoTLK. 
---
I really do want to have a Belf paladin though.
---
Yeah man. this is the bueatiful part about WoW, there is no right way to play it. I havent played vanilla. started at BC, and I want to try vanilla raids, but im also taking my time to get 60.lvling profs on the way (exept fishing. sleeping on that :(  ) and having blast with world pvp. and the only reason I  dont feel pressured to grind to 60 asap is coz classic isnt going anywhere. And that is the best part!
---
I train all of my skills! Anyone got some gold I can borrow?
---
This is the only correct logic, everyone saying "only need if you need it" dosen't understand that because of the nature of it being tradable it has to be treated as it's gold value and not as it's intrinsic upgrade value.
---
https://youtu.be/ELAgBaJHsn0
---
How! Do some research have a plan. I bought mine at 40 (barely but I got it done). Not at 54 I have 300G.
---
Doesn’t have riding skill yet
---
\*as any class. Ignoring tricks and special farming tactics.
---
the reason people all should roll need on BoE's is it prevents ninjas but also (especially the case in expensive BoEs) whats the difference between a tank rolling that can equip it right there and a mage rolling to then sell and buy a BoE cloth item thats the same value? esentially both people are rolling for a BoE item just one has to go through the AH.
---
My only beef with high level players killing me is when you kill the other faction over a period of time and they call friends to camp you
---
It's ok, your mental gymnastics are well understood and you've heard my opinion on it . There's nothing left to discuss.
---
r/woosh
---
Do you think youre examples compares to alt f4'ing out of a videogame? 
---
Yes it personally would find it funny to an extend and then i would feel slightly bad and tell him he was being fucked with and help him out. And he would probably laugh it off. No one was calling him names, they had a laugh at his cost for a second and no one got hurt. Maybe he will even remember what alt f4 does now, and all it cost was a slight humiliation. I learned what alt f4 does the exact same way (think i only fell for it once, but that is not the point) and I cringed and lol'ed about it. I guess i just dont understand why its such a big deal.
---
Multiple Sclerosis
---
Same here. 40, married, working on the kids part lol 😂
---
Did i make that claim?
---
It’s not really a dick move, it’s still money and exp so they can suck it up
---
You can figure out how many stacks you need by dividing the rep required by 50. If you are 6000/12000 honored then you’ll need 27000 (6000 in honored, 21000 in revered) divided by 50 = 540 stacks of runecloth. Every stack of runecloth at 60 is 50 rep.
---
Oh 100%. All it really does is sometimes cause rogues to open on another target, make it harder to CS your first cast, or prevent a charge if you're caught in a bad position. For Priests and Hunters its up against stoneform (and fear ward). The direct benefit of stoneform for those classes, remove/immune deep wounds, crippling poison, viper sting, blind, etc. Vastly better IMO.
---
Making every item perfect would kind of defeat the purpose
---
Double gathering and you’ll never have money problems. Occasionally I indulge in alchemy since flask-making and transmuting is very profitable, but otherwise no crafting ever- and stay off the auction house, get your gear from quests and dungeons always.
---
Achtually, you're wrong.
---
Considering how many people are replying, maybe/eventually/with enough comments you might reconsider your approach and realize that "maybe I should push down the stick coming out of my mouth this time?".
---
But that would assume you are capable of such.
---
&gt;Being called a toxic piece of shit isnt fun is it?
---
I'd assume not, but then you people dig your heels and continue saying toxic shit. You've made your original message very clear, and yet still try to use that as some defense to your own behavior.
---
How about you take a break and cool your head a bit. When you come back to type a response, try typing it into notepad first. After you're done figuring out your response, read it over a few times and ask yourself "am I accomplishing anything here or am I just spewing shit for the sake of spewing shit?"
---
Seriously, just think before you speak please.
---
Holy Paladin would be really good for those PvPs encounters you listed. You’d be super hard to kill as well.
---
I still wonder why so many self proclaimed libertarians nowadays have fascist ideologies. Do they hate the government *that* much?
---
I think he means the epic mount...
---
I would actually spec prot and tank dungeons for profit, like Strat with first orb reserved or something. Get the cash for mount, complete some fury bis, start raiding etc. 
---
Everywhere I see there is a shortage of tanks so if you find a guild and tank for members regularly you won't have to worry about being solo all the time.
---
Gratz on your first gold, and heres to many more to come.
---
Sucks doesn't it? And like you could play with them but then it sucks being carried through everything.
---
Luckily I’m the lowest level in our dungeon group, but I’ll leave it up to them. I’m not exactly looking forward to tanking ZF if I’m going to struggle. They pushed me through Uldaman when I was just barely leveled to hot the last boss reliably and it still kinda sucked. Although I always hated that place. Thanks for all the info
---
If you're bored you might try rolling some alts to test other classes out. Try dungeons.
---
God I hate this dungeon and everyone in your group so mutch right now
---
You can get to Moonglade through the timbermaw tunnel between felwood and winterspring. And there is a flight path there.
---
I'd assume it was bc one of the Horde 60's that rides the boat from Menethil to Theramore back and forth for hours killing alliance players 20 levels lower than them fell off into the water.
---
Lol and people yell at hunters for needing on weapons that aren't optimal. I sincerely hope you haven't fucking ninjad an epic just so you could sell it.
---
Definitely a shortage of tanks, I am focusing on tanking and never have issue finding a group. Finding a good healer and DPS however...
---
Okay mr Warrior I bet you're stacking up on agility to dodge all the bosses while blocking with your shield is of secondary importance.
---
If/when it's up to me, I view lockpicking similarly to any other profession the player has to level. If the rogue wants to be cool and let people roll and be a dude and unlock it for them, cool, but if not, that's also fair. I don't ask people to let me roll on their ore or herb nodes when I don't have the required profession to loot it myself.
---
But the popular opinion is and always has been to roll on chests, locked or not. I think it's a little greedy but if you don't want to run afoul of your group ask beforehand.
---
You're entitled to your own opinions but standard dungeon etiquette while leveling is that if the item is an upgrade for your toon then you can roll need on it, if it isnt you shouldn't.
---
The server overall is great this has been my only bad experience
---
Mage is good for the lvl40 mount you can start SM at 28 - 30 and hit 40 over 100g without auctioning anything
---
👍
---
Well said.
---
From my understanding pallys are just for buffs
---
No.  They can be macroed, mine are but I'm not aty computer.
---
No, but reading up on it before playing a warrior, I know that agility is just as good as strength. Both are beneficial.
---
They had proof before the roll. Not before the dungeon.
---
Well Im a mage so
---
I refuse to be silenced by the majority for them treating the player like a piece of shit. Fuck that mentality. If its just me sticking up for some one else's ignorance, than so be it. Instead of ridiculing some one else because they dont know, how about instead, ya know, being a decent person and helping them. Now that its snowballed into a reddit post making this player out to be some sort of idiot. With every other commenter saying its hilarious how they trolled the player several times with out helping them. How is that funny in anyway shape or form? Its not, its just plain cruel.
---
I wasn't going to respond, because it's clear to me that you're pretty inflexible and I'm kiiinda wasting my time here. But, it's slightly amusing so I'll just leave this one last comment. :)
---
&gt; You literally said the EXACT same thing. But you're working with me and I'm not working with you. 
---
Nah, I didn't. Us healers were giving you suggestion that literally make both our lives easier and bring more dps:
---
*Our argument:* If you life tap slightly more, you'll get both mana and all the healing we want to give you. Win win!
---
*Your argument:* I don't want your heals! Leave me alone! Don't bitch at me if I use my skills! My healing is better than yours!
---
&gt; I understand how the class works and I heal appropriately. 
---
(x) Doubt. 
---
Good luck though, eh? I know there's healers out there who don't care about overhealing, or maybe just don't want to have to worry about DPS. I'm sure you'll be able to find each other and mesh well together. I'll stick with the warlocks I know, who absolutely love my healing and the DPS boost they get from it. :)
---
what a pog
---
When I first began WoW I ran into a troll rogue named Morty. I was a young blood elf hunter since TBC had dropped 3 months after I began and leveling my warrior got too crap. I had really bad internet. So did Morty. We'd awkwardly teleport around. We met in Loch Modan, why I was there I have no bloody idea, but I was cruising around Thelsemar I think its called and spotted him. I lagged my way up to him and we partied and caused a ruckus in town for a while.  
---
Morty and I didn't really speak in chat but we spent hours together. We added each other as friends. Over the next month or two we hung out. We explored all over. Found a way up to a village meant as scenery in Loch Modan I believe as you fly around. We found a doorway that had no door. It was an empty space into which you can fall under the map. We called it Scary Door. We'd go into Scary Door and found out the rules of movement below the map. Under land you can only influence your direction initially and you'll go that direction until you hit water. In water you will go the direction you push until you push another direction. Together we went under everything. I remember going up the river to SW.  
---
I don't know what happened to Morty. I'm not sure what happened to remove him from my list, I never knew his name, but we shared this really weird bond with each other. We didn't need to express it. We just kinda... knew we enjoyed each other's company. I miss him. I'll never forget Morty, the blue haired mohawked Troll. I'll never forget Scary Door and I hope where ever you are life is good for you, Morty. - Xyrious.

I always keep my movement keys on V. No idea why. Charge, Shadowstep, Blink, etc

I like having a tank in the group, makes the run much smoother.

That’s a fair question!  The quick answer is that we don’t know how long these phases will last; there may be time to get every raider stacked and there might not. I hit 60 early, wanted to get started raiding and the clearest and quickest path to that end was to go protection (because not everyone wants to) and get myself and the others at the bleeding edge of leveling geared fast.  The makes me the natural choice for MT to facilitate raiding here and now
---
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy tanking and will continue to do so as long as the team here wants/needs me.  The post was a little hyperbolic, with the intention of driving the point home through good natured humor. 
---
... and the begrudging part, been a long-running joke as out leveled some of my other guild mates.
---
SAME. I swore my husband to secrecy.
---
I'm lvl 14 and have 2 gold. This is my first character, and my first time playing an MMO.
---
I rolled a Mage after to about 40 and didn't much like it (though ot became my main halfway through TBc).  I tried a Priest around TBC and found it harder than the Warrior and everyone says priest is easy. I gave it up around 26 for quite a while though it did get more fun around 40 when shadowform was available. I guess it also depends on the type of game play you like. I tend to like getting in the mix and "dirty" if I am doing damage.
---
How about these people think before they speak? They are defending toxic behavior and thinking its funny by trolling some one else's ignorance and perpetuating it to the point of frustration. Fuck that noise and fuck that train of though.
---
It was supposed to be mean, because this post is the worst type of post that this subreddit gets and it's all the time. Why isn't it being moderated? Why is a picture of a computer monitor of a troll in the starting menu something people upvote? It boggles the mind. If the mods aren't going to do anything, I might as well be toxic enough that they'll stop posting.
---
I have thrown pre shields on tanks in Ubrs before a big pull. My mana is back at 100% so it´s free and it helps to buffer the damage spike in the first second when every mob gets their first attack of. Shields gone instantly and the transition to sheep, offtank picking up stuff etc is smoother.
---
Spotted the mage player
---
You missed an orange markout.
---
yeah im lvl 14 with 2 gold. My first character
---
What about the Gurubashi Arena chest?
---
Oops. I’m that guy. I’m just trying to give away some Healthstones though. 
---
Sorry in advance.
---
 Code monkey like Fritos!
---
Any tips to getting it somewhat like this?
---
Warriors get a lot of crit per agi point and crits fuel rage so yea ago is super super good
---
Right? This story doesn't need to end here
---
Last night I had an ally spam polymorph with mama potions on me in a dead region, shit was great not being allowed to play and all for about 16 mins
---
Fuck really
---
That’s what they get for being Alliance dogs
---
Ninja would imply the group doesn’t have the same mindset.
---
I'm alliance on anathema,  low to med population. Feels a lot like a high pop server back in the day. Chill community on both sides it seems. 8/10 would recommend.

---
who heals warlocks? don't they have healthstones for that
---
I was running from a pack of mobs and another dude ran through just as they were resetting and aggro'd them. He died. Cussed me out via PM while I was casting rez and apologizing, only to find that right after spamming me with numerous threats and profanities over *an obvious accident* he'd /ignored me. I canceled rez and carried on, *not* dead like him lol
---
If that's what you feel, then that's fine. At least the other guy in this same threat that was arguing the same side as you finally admitted that he wanted it that way because that's how he "feels".
---
...with all the shitty flying, dailies and lfg?...
---
I never said I agree to reserve.  I said I let them go on the run.
---
Does this stack with aqua form
---
Okay coming from the outside here guys, looks like Exora was just trying say like hey guys this is a bit mean to do this etc. I am on the other side though, so it fucking once or twice or EVEN, but only if you’re fucking stupid enough google ALT+F4. It’s just a joke I think you took a bit personally man it’s only wasted that guy 15 mins or so until he probably figured out what was going on. All in all though made me laugh poor guy... 
---
Has happened to everyone, that’s why 99% of people know what this means
---
That works as long as the warrior can still get enough rage to hold aggro.  If they get little/no rage in the first few seconds due to not taking any damage, then that's bad.
---
But if you need it to keep the tank alive, then rage really isn't an issue at all.
---
Not sure what's the point of this comment but ok.
---
probably just skinning, but if you just plan on herbing, alchemy for the transmute cooldown.
---
Yes.
---
Most healers who bitch about warlocks are the ones not healing them actually. Because choosing not to heal a bad warlock causes this:
---
A) Inevitably that warlock at 40% hp is actually taking aggro and not life tapping this time and dies before a heal goes off IF the healer is perceptive enough to catch it as it's happening. Which is fine right? Warlock taps too low for healer to react, healer ignores warlock, warlock makes a mistakes and dies as a result. Yeah then the healer gets bitched out by the warlock.
---
B) Example: A quite serious post "It is healer's job to heal party members, whether or not they lifetap doesn't matter" that was seen here in the first week or two. Which is usually about during combat mana replenishment, because mana&gt;hp&gt;mana conversion is quite favourable. These bad warlocks view the healer's mana pool as an extension to their mana pool.
---
C) I've had a mageless group where warlocks had neither drink nor food because it was "too expensive" and wanted me to heal them while I had vendor food because finding mages was being a pain. I refused and they ended up wanding almost the entire dungeon.
---
And every time this has come up I've had warlocks vehemently telling me I'm wrong on all but point C.
---
I warned a mage about hostile mages in STV as I was leaving the immediate area to move on with my questing. 
---
He whispered me to fuck off.
---
You messaged him 2 times after finding out he ignored you. Twice
---
Netherwind is low to med pvp server. EST if that matters
---
Which one? "Titan Panel Classic"?
---
lol came here to say this
---
Nobody asked you to be quiet or remain silent - Your approach is.. to put it mildly, stupid and irrational as fuck. Which was the thing one can reconsider.
---
Lmao I’m siding with her/him.
---
K, you can totes be mean all you want. I was replying to a question, But i can see youre real sensitive about it so im sorry i wasn't more clear.
---
&gt;Yes you do,
---
It's almost like we record vehicle speeds in miles/kilometers ***per hour*** for a reason, or something.

Hunter
---
He kept sending messages to me. I figured he wanted to talk again.
---
What..?
---
You can't look horizontally? This is the caliber of response, lol
---
Gosh not on my server Thunderfurry.
---
There's a guy in NYC hat does this. He rolls in carpet and hangs out at shows.
---
Trust me that's way more fun than rushing prebis
---
Why hunter? Even though it has so many more buttons to use and binds?
---
Ok thanks!
---
The game is pretty much doing quests, running from A to B (sometimes several times), and doing dungeons/raids.
---
In the situation where the healer accidentally pulls aggro is it preferable for me as a Hunter to send my pet to try take the aggro and run it to the tank once it gets it, or should I just let the priest run the mob back to the tank and leave the pet to DPS the initial target?
---
Same question for when a Mage takes aggro, but the answer is much less important ;)
---
That all may be true, but everyone personally loves Stormwind more than Ironforge. All that stuff mentioned is for elitist who actually care that it takes 3 more secs to hit the mailbox. Nothing wrong with that too.
---
The 40 mount is absolutely free. 60 mount around 300 to 400g ish. Depends if you farm out mats and what not
---
I'm not at my PC rn, but whatever the default pet attack keybind is, I've set to G and it works on my warlock and hunter.
---
So basically I can learn rogue as I level and it will be smooth sailing compared to hunter Wich will take lots of practice to learn through and through?
---
And then you hit your next even level and were back down to 12 copper after buying your spells.
---
Eventually yes
---
Yeah you're wrong though. AGI means more crits (more rage) and also (if Fury DPS or Fury/Prot Tank) greater flurry uptime. AGI is pretty much on par with STR.
---
Lol
---
I bought a six pack of Vernors once because I'd never had it, but heard it was old school so i was curious how it tasted. Vernors had that same weird vitamin flavor that regular Monster has. It was gross but I kept drinking it.
---
I started playing a few months before Wrath, so I never experienced Vanilla. Glad I have the opportunity to and I am taking my time and enjoying it. 
---
I’ve always heard stories about AV lasting for days...not sure if that will be replicated but would be interesting to see how BGs are in classic. Seems like it’ll be awhile before those are released. 
---
Twinking will be fun/frustrating.
---
I bet killing mobs got considerably easier though :P
---
I've rolled an warrior alt and haven't had trouble getting low level groups yet.
---
Admittedly, I can tank which does make it a lot easier.
---
Yes the second time when he came back online they could’ve been more helpful, no wait. They could have been helpful fullstop haha
---
Me bear, me take what me wants

Only the bear necessities

As long as you dont group up with asshats.
---
The strangest claim I've read in a long time. An english server with only non english guilds at raid level? I kind find that hard to believe. Look around more.
---
Nice one bruv! Exciting content for sure.
---
Hoping to do mine next month :)
---
You're the greedy one tho
---
If heroic strike, cleave, or raptor strike are queued then your dualwield white miss penalty disappears.
---
Is there a tool that shows like a race + class with full armor?
---
I was constantly overhealing in Molten Core so I started using Smite and I got kicked.  Finishing a boss fight with extra mana because you can't find a healing target was tough on me because I wanted to help.  So I grinded 2 weeks to get the best possible DPS set I could.  +2 hit on spells and +10% crit later I thought I was ready to smite but i guess there is no room for Smite Priests anywhere.  The 30k damage I did on Ragnaros last week wasn't good enough either.  I was told if a raid needs more DPS they can get another mage.
---
&gt;Is the 7s an exaggeration for comedic effect or is this also your current state of affairs? Because i don't know how someone could only have 7s when they are lvl 39
---
I'm level 32, and the most coin I've had was in the 2g range. I don't even buy stuff off the AH, God knows I should though. I haven't gotten a real upgrade for almost 10 levels. I still have one grey piece of gear.
---
Even without training every skill, my purse averages around 75s, most times a little less.
---
Hunter is easier.  Rogue is less forgiving if you mess up your rotation.  Also, rogues are squishier and cant just into the fray like a hunter.  Rogues get the benefit of being able to choose their battles but if you get caught you're either screwed or blowing a long CD to escape and reset the fight.
---
Bravo to that raid leader.
---
I'd probably say it's more to do with the fact you had consumables (and a potion that put you back to full HP), evasion up and a Druid that wasn't smart enough to go bear/FF you/heal himself.
---
There's a cat lady in elywnn also sells 3 types for 50s each
---
T2 isn't a dress. It's a skirt. Or a kilt. However you want to look at it. But the chest piece doesn't have you the 'dress' part, so doesn't count!
---
Not sure what you're apologizing for or what you mean exactly, I just explained my reasoning for being mean in my negativity rather than constructive.
---
How though? What are you doing with all the stuff you loot?
---
I don't know I kind of agree this reddit since release has just transformed into a circle of sharing the same basic experiences we're all having
---
That might have been me. I've used that trick probably thousands of times on bnet west, I had all the cool cheats that could change your text color, map hack and other things and I would offer them to unsucpeted victims. Sorry for that but I was only 10 at the time. I knew every scam in the book back then.  And feel very bad about it now.
---
whats the difference tho! if you get an item from a boss or you trade one to get it from another person you still got the item.
---
Your only argument is "it' feels better if the item comes from a boss"
---
Fuck your feelings
---
That’s because those are yellow attacks.
---
what if they don't immediately equip it?
---
Looks like a draenei
---
Bind the two to mouse wheel up and down. Scroll your way to your epic mount
---
Righto so it's definitely just a default bind. Must be broken on his UI.
---
I expect to get my 40 mount around level 64-65. It was like that the first time around, and it'll be like that this time around.
---
WE  D E M    B O YZ!
---
100%
---
So laughing at others ignorance and purposely forcing it to continue for your own enjoyment is funny to you? My approach is "youre a piece of shit for thinking this is funny" is some how me being toxic? Youre a part of the "HE DOESNT KNOW!" club which is filled with elitists and garbage ass pieces of shit just like the others in this comment chain defending this type of toxic behavior and some how you think im the ass hole in all of this? Ok buddy, keep posting. Its making my night that much better with something to actually talk about other than mindless useless memes that get posted here all the time.
---
Unfortunately because it is streaming an entire screen and not just sending 1's and 0's for data.. it takes a whole lot of data, so with that being said, you will most likely suffer some pixelation, frame rate drops, and possible crashes/disconnecting every now and again. That's just the sacrifice you make.
---
I've yet to try a dungeon with people because I haven't trusted it enough, let alone the controls being a little clunky for dungeon and team cooperation. But, it is most definitely possible!
---
But I can't really help you with the performance, other than suggest you playing on a Wi-Fi instead of your iPad's data/Phone hotspot.  This kind of thing is mostly used for solo questing and simple things like Professions or AH skimming that doesn't require crazy good response times.
---
I have played directly in front of my computer on my phone's data, just to see the response time and it is remarkably quick though. So, like I said, it is entirely possible to group in a dungeon with this.. it just may be hard to keep up with actual communication and the possibilities of the problems discussed above.
---
Warlocks usuallu have more mp than mana, and little to no spirit. It is faster to tap to 100 and bandage or eat than straight drink
---
Same here. I havent seen a queue since they further expanded the server capacity a few weeks ago.
---
Why you care about what anyone thinks about how you or anyone chooses to express themselves is just silly😂
---
I was a mean demented child and would ask people if they wanted to join a hardcore guild they had to tell me their diablo and destruction rating. Then they would ask me how to do that and my answer would be “you put in /dnd acountname:(your account) password: (your password). Crazy how many adults fell for this. I would take all their stuff all the way day to 1 single health potion. I’m sorry if you’re out there &lt;3 I had a rough childhood.
---
If you suffer from astigmatism like I do, the pictures taken  on screen becomes very glowy and bright. It really hurts the eye resulting in the user (me) not wanting to even look at the picture.

Meanwhile they are one shot from dying.. drink boys it's okay we understand that you can heal up.
---
Doormat guy is a legend!
---
That's a great story!
---
No shit, yet every other person in this thread thinks its funny to be a piece of shit
---
Okay thanks that seems like a solid plan, yes I have my 40 mount I was referring to the epic mount, lol. I've heard fury tanking is hard without gear so I'll give it a shot. Tanking Strat.. Do you know any good tanking guides or at least pre bis gear I can grab quickly?
---
Today I learned that big strong bulls may look like teddy bears...
---
my main issue with warrior is that you have to pay attention almost all the time, on top of it being slower
---
you usually can't pull more than one creep, you should pay attention to reactive spells, irregular rage gains (HS rage dumping has to be of the most annoying mechanics in wow), irregular misses etc.
---
all of this makes warrior exhausting, when compared to my paladin, which I seal up, go afk, heal up and repeat. it's not faster, but the grind is enjoyable, because it is regular, repetitive
---
I can actually focus on watching that TV show instead of evaluating every little action that the warrior class requires to be effective
---
And use rank 1 seal of command. 70% is 70%.
---
Pls no
---
Guess im still being unclear, kinda drunk. Its all good, we dont need to understand each other
---
It all makes sense now, and for all the wrong reasons.
---
But why risk it?   Give me a reason NOT to drink besides flexing your ability to drain life?
---
Too bad it's covered up with some ugly looking numbers.
---
Podcasts. Really makes grinding mobs easier as I sort tof go on auto-pilot in-game while listening to what's being discussed.

I know the Rarity addon tracks kills for mounts in retail, not sure if it tracks dungeon drops in classic.
---
If you're horde SM has a great off hand quest reward that pairs well with the dagger.

That's kind of a dick move to the other 3 people, to punish them too without saying anything.

This image needs moar Chestnutz!

Still had flying mounts, still had dailies, still had dungeon finder and dungeons that were all shaped like doughnuts. Resilience, Blood Elves, alliance shaman ...

I have fond memories of WotLK too, but it was way farther down the path to retail than some people want to admit
---
2005? Maybe 06. Trocadero in philly.

I just use first aid.  Sorry about yourselves post fights.  I came knowing my life tap would tax someone and I'm here to accept that responsibility.

like others have stated just because someone is idle dosen't mean they are using a script

Exactly.  No thanks to the Alliance Fest.   At least we won't have to hear anyone from that server on here complaining about us ganking them in STV
---
I got 9 at 15 bc mining’s where it’s at

It’s rogues discretion to have people roll or not. It is nice that the rogue will allow it, but that’s all yours or a blacksmiths
---
&gt; perpetuating it? 
---
&gt; assfucks like you
---
this is just... perfect.
---
I mean for a raid to go that well, it's probably a fairly selective group no? Selective groups don't tend to look favourably on people not playing their assigned/meta role.
---
You are too kind for this world, but may your tiny light pierce the darkest corners of Azeroth.

Wailing Caverns, everyone just starting to get there shit together/ kits, but we’re all still in whites and greys. When you know the way through the twists and turns people definitely show their respect lol.

Should be around 30g. Essence of Fire will be \~10g, small shards should be \~4g, +enchanter tip/fee.

In pve yes.  In a dungeon you drinking won't slow anyone down.

why would they?

theres a macro that will buy that a specific item slot from a vender, the pattern is itme slot 30 so you can just sit and spam the macro to buy it when it pops. no need to open and close to refresh the vender.
---
If you want a laugh, look at this guys post history.
---
Kodo eats em, I get it
---
This is how vanilla wow played out the vast majority of the time. To such an extent that most people wouldn’t even bother asking to need on an item that was BoE because the commonly accepted practice was to greed that shit. Of course you’d get the occasional person who asked and the occasional nice group who would oblige.
---
Why? Because my handwriting looks like I write with my pencil in my mouth? Because it’s true that’s how I write.

You mean neets who care way too much about video games?

if they told you loot rules in advance, Blizzard considers is scamming. If not, this is your lesson to ask for lute rules in advance. good luck

As a long time Holy Pally I like to smack things in melee. If I can get str without sacrificing priority stats I'm happy.

Fuck I hope not

A kill list, nice!
---
"Most likely using scripts" that quite the assumption you have.
---
"Anyone who knows more than I do is a neet"
---
Your argument that accepting gold for a mount is grounds for lost respect is supported by almost nobody.
---
But there is a much bigger benefit to letting people that can use a BoP item have it than giving it to someone to vendor. The person who is vendoring gains very little. 
---
In the BoE scenario, the person who would be selling it on the AH would be missing out on significantly more.
---
Said who
---
It always fascinates me to hear other people's preferences for keybinds.
---
I place my most common abilities on Q/E/R/F, next most common on SHIFT-Q/E/R/F, then next on CTRL-Q/E/R/F. Defensive skills and buffs on Z/X/C/V, then SHIFT-Z/X/C/V, etc. CC goes on 1-4. Movement abilities go on the side buttons of my mouse (including mount up and toggle autorun). No idea why I use this setup, but it's the same for all MMOs I've played.
---
&gt;Is what people say when they can no longer argue their point and want to put the burden on the other person.
---
My point has been well argued above.
---
You made a claim, go ahead and support it.
---
&gt;You know what the word "greed" means. You know what the gold symbol means. You shouldn't need an official Blizzard quote to put two and two together.
---
I will if you claim its the "*This is the system Blizzard has implemented.*"
---
&gt;But I'm guessing you can't find a Blizzard quote to support your stance either or you'd be throwing it around like crazy.
---
I never claimed to speak for Blizzard, though. You made a definitive claim about Blizzard's truth.

The paper is old lol I used it for my like cups/foods etc so I wouldn’t get a ring on my desk lol. The list is pretty new.

I manage a QA team for a comparatively boring title compared to WoW. Our least useful resource is the content of user-submitted bug reports... the most useful resource is the sheer mass number of reports submitted in prioritization of what gets addressed first.

---
Because of the fact BoE's are tradeable you have to value them as if they are Gold.
---
The reason people all should roll need on BoE's is it prevents ninjas but also (especially the case in expensive BoEs) whats the difference between a tank rolling that can equip it right there and a mage rolling to then sell and buy a BoE cloth item thats the same value? esentially both people are rolling for a BoE item just one has to go through the AH.
---
I'll allow it.
---
I like this idea will start implementing in game thanks!

If no one's dying the raid is going well and if no one's dying him adding any amount of dps can only make it better.

If he published the names ppl would possibly msg her (or him, the friendzoner) about it.

My brother and I would run all rogue/Druid stealth groups through various 5 man’s with other guildies. Good times, but a lot of theoretical competition on loot (much of it downgrades).
---
You also need a button to interact with the vendor. I have camped this vendor for a few hours spamming 3 buttons
---
1) Macro to target / buy 30th item
---
2) Button to interact with vendor
---
3) Escape to close interaction menu
---
So, you fall into this category I sorta made up idk... WoW classic isn’t meant for 2019... games today are what they are because of games like WoW. Even retail WoW isn’t WoW anymore people can argue. I started the launch with about 10 brand new WoW players. Friends I met thru streaming or playing other games. The count is down to only me. An OG. I’ve been hearing/seeing other stories similar. As I’m sure there are Tons of new players enjoying classic it seems far more new players are getting to about your point and quitting. 
---
    Stick with it casually if you fear boredom is here cause it doesn’t get much better unless you want it too. Meeting friends/the social aspects 15 years ago in this game was really what did it for me. Now these features are offered in almost all games soo, Classic really isn’t exciting as it used to be back in 2004 when “joining a guild “ ment something. 
---
   My suggestion hit 60 casually. The PvP is this games bread and butter imo. Wait for phases to roll out with a class you can see yourself playing for PvP fun.
---
I would go blade + orb. There aren’t many spell damage items until later on and most people use that blade all the way to 55-60. Plus there’s another nice drop from Mara that you can use with the blade down the line.
---
Where are these tracked in dbm?
---
Quite literally “lit”
---
Your outlook is no better "that's worth a lot so fuck everyone else I should get a shot at it"
---
There's 3 or so non english ones, but have no space. One of them did, but is full to the brim with arseholes
---
I've used a vpn to play bnet games many times and never had a problem. Must be something you're doing.
---
Yo that dude from back to the future movies has that so I’ll take it as a compliment
---
Or maybe just don’t do the quest.  The quests were not designed with some completionist achievement title in mind.  I, for example, almost never finish the harpies and koklar in the barrens.  
---
One of the things I like about classic/vanilla is this feeling of a larger world where things are going on without your direct involvement.  Going to one area, staying there and draining it completely dry just in time to move on to the next area works against that.  Knowing there are more things out there to do than you will accomplish on your own is ... I dunno, immersive somehow
---
Personal computers have existed for over 20 years. At this point any adult can blame only themselves.
---
Yea "that dude"
---
Good, we need to call out people like this!
---
There is an addon you can get called 'spy' it tracks what enemy faction players are around you and you can right click their name and add them to an ingame kill on sight list, and it will alert you when someone that is kill on sight is nearby.
---
You're right.
---
It was a blast testing this for you! ;) I hope everyone likes it as much as I do..
---
Just saw this thread 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbux3x/my_profit_guide
---
Not an addon.  As you have said, you can probably set something up in TSM, but classic addons are relatively rare compared to retail.
---
I like the term Neet and Americans need to use it more. There sure are alot of them.
---
mad coz bad
---
in response to your points 
---
A) the lock is bad, if dps dies then it's dps's fault let them bitch while they enjoy a nice run back.
---
B) I mean thats fine if the healer is ok with that, such that the healer dosen't drink much or the extra dps would speed things up while the group still stay healed up. It really dosen't matter what the lock thinks because the healer can decide if they heal the lock. If the lock complains see point A
---
C) Any class that Dosen't carry food/drinks (if a mana user) is a bad player period. if they end up wanding all dungeon they will have shit dps to show and you can note it down not to group with them or kick/convince others they should be replaced as such for not coming prepared.
---
In all cases the locks should come prepared with food/drinks and healer should heal the tank first and dps only when appropriate after the tank. You arn't wrong to treat the locks bad if they are bad players and don't care either.
---
Gah. Not even playing and I just got pissed off.
---
Maybe an old model Sylvanas for the “like” part will be better?
---
Spread the word :)
---
Well I suppose I should do some research into them.  I don't personally know anyone that uses one though.  From what I understand if you are using WIFI or Mobile networks then it is more important vs connecting straight to a router?   
---
I have no clue lol.  I'll end up getting hacked now lmao.  😂😂
---
I have 69 silver...
---
1.5 seconds after this screenshot was taken, Roguetard got cheapshot - kidney shot'd to death by Udkillerxxx &lt;BLAZE IT&gt;
---
Make an alt you keep her level if she has way less time than you to play.
---
Yep and you’re no different just like I said. Thanks for proving my point.
---
Yo there is another cool trick you can screen shot things on your pc you don't have to use your phone crazy huh
---
It cost five rage lol.
---
That’s really smart. Good thinking bro.
---
You can't tracking both mining and herbalism at the same time in classic.
---
What it should be : greed if you want it, need if it's an upgrade.
---
What happens: wait to see what others do, if someone is clearly needing when they don't, I also need to spite them. If anyone else in the group genuinely needs it then we /roll.
---
Hey what would you guys suggest as the best 2 professions for gold making on my gold making toon? Tailoring/Enchanting, Herbalism/Alchemy, Skinning/Leathermaking? On my main I have Mining and Engineering so didnt want to include that combo
---
I had a warrior tank ask me to switch with him in BRD because the disarms were wrecking his threat. 
---
feelsgoodman
---
dps &gt; tank with like two or three gear pieces swapped
---
But when you're fighting a rogue and he dodges twice in a row and gets two shot it makes it all worth it
---
thats called theft, plagiarism and infringement.
---
yeah man, MC taking 1 hour a week must be so time consuming
---
And you are the one who called me a Boomer. Nice Try, young blood, nice try.
---
Phase 2 was 3 months after release (aka what they said they'd be following for releases).
---
Why is your warrior same color as rogue? That's confusing af :O
---
No cheating here I just leave WoW up on my laptop and check occasionally when I can at work. It's just supply and demand! Those recipes are going to pay for my basic mount.
---
Good troll.
---
Thanks! It was a lot of trial and error.  
---
I love the idea of making a unique one for every class - so I might get to doing that in the coming weeks.
---
The fuck is wrong with you
---
Thanks, I’m on Pagle and I’m looking for a laid back guild. Thanks for the read and glad you found a good time.
---
You can turn off error speech 😂
---
But locks don't do much dsp.
---
PS I'm just messing with you.  I understand how locks work.   😂
---
is he on a high pop server? my played is huge because I used jump methods for days to avoid queues
---
2. Try /spy show then /spy reset
---
Imagine thinking the greedy person isn't the guy that wants to equip a boe worth half their mount for 4 levels instead of letting the whole party roll for it.
---
It just seems like you're bad at the game tbh
---
Compared to what I've seen this is eloquent and tame.
---
because I'm only 39 lol
---
Swamp of sorrows. South-west, farm whelplings for skin and a chance at a rare pet
---
Experiences like this are what classic is all about for me. Thanks for sharing.
---
High...ly?
---
Rogue
---
Source: have played both in pvp
---
It's a rattle or be rattled world out there.
---
Rogue has lower skillcap.
---
Get an auction house addon line TSM or Auctionator
---
both will give you the AH price obviously, but also the vendor price and a DE average price (because sometimes you get dust and sometimes shards) so you will now instantly what will give you the most value
---
MC taking 2hours a week, wow whats outside!
---
casual reddit garbage at it again
---
So much
---
ELI5 Astigmatism ?
---
im pissed, dont even bother logging back in
---
That is literally only on master looting, and it also has never been enforced in the month classic has been out.
---
The argument is based on the idea that sometimes the gold price is worth more than the value of equipping and using the item. The Need Before Greed system is not designed to accommodate that assumption. It assumes that there is always more value in equipping than in selling it. 
---
If the way to get the most value out of the item is putting it on the AH and using the gold to improve your gear in other ways or whatever then it doesn't make sense to ask people to Greed so that another player can Need in order to **not** make best use of the item.
---
Fairbanks?
---
My BB/kargath hearth disagrees
---
How...do you know this?
---
idk for sure, but try it out and see. worse case, you lose...25s, a transmute CD (?) and AH fees?
---
What server are you on and why do you want to change to a PvP server? This late in the game restarting is gonna be rough. Having no friends and no 60 to back up your character leveling is no bueno. Also PvP servers are never fully balanced. Also world PvP right now is you getting rolled over by 60s, 3v1, or rogues when you are at low health.
---
&gt;The identity of a class is quite heavily influenced by the worst players in a class and how they can abuse their mechanics... Obviously healers get the shit stick dealing with warlocks because their "bad habits" are all in direct conflict with the healer.
---
Wait what did this say im interested
---
Oh yeah good point,  I lack the art skills to make one with OG Sylvanas though haha.
---
Sm: cathedral drops a +healing +spirit 1-handed mace that I’m still using at level 50.
---
Wait you got 60 in 8 days?
---
you should have done it. dont use HS but slam. that us pre 30
---
I was on a private server once where they had mispriced something to sell for more than you can buy it for, so I made a buy sell macro and spammed it until I had gold cap. That was one of the first times I learned about other great uses for macros. A lot of the more advanced stuff is still way too confusing for me though.
---
I love druid. I dps'd, offtanked, innervated, and then offhealed when the healer went oom again. it's such a good support class.
---
all of that spec'd full feral
---
Just hitting you back with your own shit. Nice try, bitch blood, nice try.
---
What a weak argument.
---
2g bop gear that you can only get by running that dungeon is not the same as 50-500g boe gear you can buy from the ah at any time.
---
You chose this when you rolled mage. Now give me food 
---
Also I usually tip a few gold so it can’t be that insanely bad
---
This
---
Whoa if you think things are getting stale at level 16 then I would honestly stop before you invest a lot of time into the game. It’s a lot of repetitive time consuming even once you hit 60. If it’s not your cup of tea it’s okay.
---
A kill list... the fbi are on their way
---
Thank you so much for replying with your results! Very kind of you
---
Yay! Tourist season is ending
---
Why does someone always have to go and mess up a good thing with their big mouth?
---
Get the auctioneer addon. Youd be supprised how many white items you are vendoring for 5 silver that will sell for like 50 silver on the auction house.
---
Sure, and I was tacitly calling the people running the raid elitist pricks who are likely to do overoptimized dick moves like this.
---
Of course with little actual knowledge about the event.
---
MOAR BLIZZARDSSSSS
---
Just WW.
---
Also, there are some guides that show how to get trinkets/important levelling gear and the like. There are some quests whose rewards are so much better than the other option, so be careful about what you choose.
---
Also, not every quest line can be done in one hit, at least, not without some grinding of level/s
---
It's funny how confident you sound when you're so wrong.
---
maybe, are you doing ah scans?
---
Is it viable going dps paladin on PvE? Will it be hard to find groups to dungeon/raid?
---
Oh. I open trade with randoms all the time to give them shit. Like a green level 7 bow I looted in Darkshore the other day. Was back in Darnassus to sell it on the AH and saw a level 8 hunter using some grey quality bow and just gave it to him.
---
Enchanting only if you are the guild enchanter and can get your hands on the best formulas.
---
Otherwise Herb/Alch. Alchemy is a profession that is highly used in every single phase of the game - for both PvE and PvP. Potions will always be a necessity in many aspects of the game both solo and group content.
---
Herbalism is great if you can log on for maybe only an hour or two a day. Having consistent routes and farming what is booming on your server is not difficult.
---
Eloborate? Why is rogue easier
---
Wtf lmao.
---
If everyone rolls need on boes everyone has an equal chance at gear they get from selling those boes.
---
Not to mention it balances it out too from selling big ticket boes and buying 3 or 4 other upgrades from it.
---
Tantrums? For not putting up with toxic behaviors? What point did i prove? You literally made none at all. Go the fuck away kid.
---
You are a reprehensible dirtbag and I love it. Upvoted
---
Layers are aptly named, each sever is made up of several layers that separate groups of players. joining a group automatically puts you in the group leaders layer, so you can use it to jump to a layer where the mobs you just killed are still alive instead of waiting for them to respawn. 
---
The exploit that people were banned for was using this in raids, since those bosses are once per week only
---
I love shamans so if I have a reagent they use like fish scales, I always throw it at them without saying anything.
---
It goes to 300...
---
its 50 dkp minus
---
Is this solely what you do in game?
---
I mean I found 3 instances of you being an asshole within 2 minutes of reading your comments, good luck finding anything on me.
---
Uhh a stack of herbs to make Major Mana Pots goes for a lot more than a couple silver. There is no market for low level potions in phase 1 but you can make a lot of money selling to level 60s that are raiding.
---
&gt;gaining wand skill at a faster rate are all useless for levelling?
---
im fucking dead
---
It was nickname given after he funded the Zepplin that now travels to Grom'gol. His full name is Zagrul 'Moneystack' Gorehands.
---
Is this just an echo chamber for you?
---
F's in the comments boys
---
Oh noooooo you got me duude. You spammed my threads and comments it hurts me omg im gonna delete reddit!
---
It is not a raid buff, it only affects your party group even in raid if I am not wrong
---
A warrior wanted to duel while waiting for the ship to UC.  He beat me and yelled EZ.  I asked for rematch as ship pulled in.  He didn’t make the ship.  People called me an asshole.  Oh well!
---
Lol ikr
---
If you play casters the way you advertise, I'm not surprised.
---
Lotp only affects your party not the whole raid
---
My previous comment makes no sense now. Bummer.
---
You don't know that though :) you would be surprised.
---
Didnt even know it existed. Much better for a warrior.
---
Un'Goro is filled with video game references. Is this a nod to star wars?
---
Who?
---
I took a transfer to Anathema on my Hunter from Biggles. I regret it only because the population on Anathema is so small. It's hard to form groups at peak times. I just want to get to 60 on my Hunter, man. 
---
Luckily, I still have a 30 Pally and 20 Priest on Bigglesworth.
---
Enemies attacking you doesn't proc judgement of wisdom.
---
I actually laughed a little lmao 
---
But yeah I kind of gave up on thinking about dps paladin. Just wanted to know if it's hard leveling up a healing/tanking paladin playing solo
---
Same thing happened to me my first run. Lucky we had a warlock!
---
There is really no way for any player to "prove" someone else is botting.
---
There are only hints. Some more distinct than others.
---
You report people you genuinely **believe** are botting and blizzard will then (hopefully) follow up with a more precise look using tools players have no access to.
---
LOL
---
Unfortunately most gamers are like this, myself included sometimes. Because we are classed as 'outsiders' to the rest of society who waste their time playing games people don't take them seriously which then leads to this sort of behavior, I remember the kids back in school i used to make fun of for playing WoW, now I'm one of those kids in my mid twenties! Anyway what I am trying to get to is that these people have been picked on for certain things and now because they may have more knowlegde game time etc that its fair to pick on others as others did to them. Really just a huge circle of picking on each other in public forums. Some people take it to heart others like me don't either care or don't have the spare time to argue or its just not worth the energy. (although here i am)
---
More water with the se amount of heateams a lower average temperature. Checkmate Vandrel!
---
If you are speccing affliction may I suggest going for a drain tanking build and running with a succubus. Ever since I switched leveling has gotten so much easier.
---
yea
---
Holding up a Camaro in your front yard?
---
Jack.
---
The arcanuums are available. Nobody is really selling them right now, it would seem
---
It amuses me that people thought this was just about Nostalgia but I have met so many people who have never touched WoW but joined to play Classic and are having the time of their lives with it.
---
i should probably elaborate on this. some are, +8 stats and some other ones
---
You get them through Librams, they are not a recipe an enchanter applies..
---
Isn't grinding mobs good for money and xp?
---
Deleted because "rant" followed by "post 1-3 lines and it'll be left up" might be the dumbest thing I've seen.
---
Because fuck context and evidence, right? If anything, accusations of ninja looting should be *required* to have sufficient supporting information.
---
Just downed rag today as a mage. 0 FR and received 0 heals. Use a greater fire protection potion 2 min before pull. And use a second one when the first one runs out. Use fireward and ice barrier if you have it on cooldown. 
---
And spread out! Remember if you get launched, you can blink back down to where you were if you are quick.
---
We killed him before submerge.
---
Ace of Spades...lol
---
Don't join loot council guilds. There is always a corrupt officer and people cannot control their greed. DKP is much more fair.
---
Who are the peeps to avoid? I remember watching some people from uwu arguing with people in another guild in SW so I have been very cautious on people in biggish guilds. But, the uwu on Alliance have been chill.
---
Because he thinks he’s some sort of white knight defenders new people. He’s really just an asshole with a superiority complex trying to make himself feel better.
---
Nah see the water was evaporating so she put it back
---
Stockholm syndrome ladies and gentlemen.
---
I've levelled to 60 in Vanilla and classic as a warrior, it's unequivocally the worst class, hands down to level. I don't know what you're trying to say here at all.
---
And to say marginally better than HUNTER and DRUID? You need to check yourself into a medical facility.
---
It's not hard, it's bad, no amount of "research" makes it less bad at a foundational level. The fact you said "as long you remember to have food and first aid" as if that's some kind of saving grace is hilarious, it's a requirement and it's immense downtime..
---
When a class flourishes on the strategy of killing green level mobs one at a time, there's no need to go on rambling about its strengths.
---
You are absolutely wrong
---
Its EXACTLY what its made out to be. Because its made out to be really freaking good if you have the spots alone. You dont, so ofc its not good. Lol are you for real.
---
Ain't Stalagg either but still fits the bill.
---
That’s my binding for stealth since Vanilla. Mount is shift F.
---
neat
---
Man just push to 42 get death coil and your life is amazing. Pick up curse of exhaustion and you are gold for PvP.
---
What if you hot before the tank enters combat? I can’t say for sure but I think if he enters with a hot you don’t get threat for it.
---
I played with 3 people in a St run who all had /train bound to all their abilities. Protip, if you ignore people, it silences emotes
---
Hey alliance smolderweb it's an awesome server and it's pretty balanced with it tipping in hordes favor !
---
One drops from a Kraul Boss that gives healing and shadow damage and +1 spirit.
---
You talk about convention but now you want to abandon the conventional way to read a graph in order to support your argument.  I've used and looked at graphs my entire life and career up to this point.  To think that time only belongs on the X-axis suggests you haven't seen many graphs outside of your high school physics class.
---
Blaumeux.
---
No ques, always high pop (except like 3am PST on a weekday) , and when the census data was out it was like the only 50/50 split server and it’s seemed like that to me as well. 
---
I started on a normal server on launch day, but 4 days later I rerolled to a PvP server and picked Blaumeux because it’s PST. 
---
I feel very lucky.
---
[here](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Companion) you go.
---
I like it.
---
Like retail
---
Nice, but holy shit switch those axes.
---
Ye it's called Wrath of the Lich King
---
Three of those dudes in my guild.
---
Does the pattern stock while you have the window open or do you have to keep reopening it?
---
I think solo mara runs would be easier with my Main with his better gear, no?
---
"Has an album's worth of material on a hard drive somewhere" doesn't mean "has an album ready to go", unfortunately.
---
the whole warlock class (affliction, thats what I tried) is broken.
---
Dark Pact does not work, only transfers half or less than intended mana (should be affected by spellpower as Life Tap). In MoltenCore, since the imp cant phaseshift, its useless being in the tank grp, since I cant park him, non-phaseshifted it dies after 5 sec in combat (all ability disabled, no fireshield or fire bolt cast)... cant dark pact because its dead. "ability is not ready yet". I reported these even in the beta and after release several times, nothing.
---
Nice one
---
You lol. I know you're teasing me but I managed to log back in and tell the player what happened. I hope you're having a fun time in classic!
---
For the last two nights I have been questing in Un'goro.  
---
I have seen King Mosh twice, and one other Devilsaur. The overfarming is real.
---
that's why you bind interact with target to one button and put the macro on another
---
That's gotta be the highest res 14 y.o. screenshot in existence, well done my guy
---
Got his quest done before him but didn’t wanna was around.
---
Does the window have to be open or can you just spam that while targeting the npc?
---
Fairly common. Took me like 10+ runs for force of will
---
If we're counting sap as a real utility here, very easy arguments could be made for any other class. DPS warriors: intimidating/demoralizing/battle shout, concussive blow, piercing howl, etc. All skills arguably better for the party then... Sap. Giving value to your party isn't necessarily about being the class that can 10%+/- DPS, over other classes, which boast much more supportive skills imo, it's about what can you do for your party that no other class can. 
---
And hunters... are hunters xD.
---
Did you just rip a joke off a post from last week...?
---
Username check out, strange as it may seem. From what I know, metalheads love Danny Brown.
---
Last time I played years ago it was like this. Other than mount drops, they were all BOE from vendors. Except maybe rep mounts
---
I remember getting aggro if it got attacked and killed then they would all run towards you. As far as people just seeing it and then aggro I don’t remember it working that way only when it was destroyed.
---
I am going sm/ruin. I finished the sm part I started with the ruin part is it the right way or I should split the points between them?
---
Every time I have seen a member from the guold toxic on kromkrosh they have lived up to their name. I regularly see people complaining about people from the guold toxic. 
---
Was in a pug brd full run. Showed up and a mage was in the guild toxic. I was the last person to show up and they had already been waiting a bit so I didn't say anything and figured jist maybe this time they would be chill and... They were for the first two hours. A little before the boss (or however far we were since we were killing every boss along the way pretty much) he mentions a side boss drops something he wants. Nbd. We clear the area and kill the boss. His belt drops we all say grats. The priest didnt even roll need because the toxic guild member had been the only reason we even did that boss. As soon as he gets the item he started hearthing out without a word and dropped party.
---
Moral of the story: when people tell you who they are, listen. As far as i can tell the guild toxoc are a bunch of rp players on non rp servers rp'ing jackasses. They may very well have actual guidelines on how to be jackasses.
---
Just had a drink in the Gallow's End Tavern in your brothers honor. [https://imgur.com/dnLZCQN](https://imgur.com/dnLZCQN)
---
I mean stalagg/skeram are basically horde pve servers so I'd hope some of them wouldn't want to actually do some pvp, since they chose a pvp server
---
&gt; I'm honestly trying to understand why you wouldn't give it to the person who needs that piece of gear
---
I'm a Druid, so if a 200g epic drops and I can't equip it then I can sell it and purchase a Warden's Staff. 
---
Everyone in the group benefits from the item equally, so why wouldn't everyone in the group roll for it?
---
No, you should read my comment before you post.
---
That's so cool! I always find jerks, as a level 20 priest i ran into a 60 mage in orgrimmar. He wanted 1g for a port to UC.....yup I ran.  1gold is nearly half my gold haha
---
Most recent one I can think of:  our group had been looking for someone to tank RFD for about 30 minutes, and ready to quit.  Someone in general chat jokingly says (I think it was a joke) that we didn't need a tank.  Nothing better to do so we grabbed another rogue (our group ended up being 2 rogues, 2 mages and a priest).  We made it the entire instance without wiping, and thenon the last boss we finally died.  Figured out what we did wrong and killed it 2nd try without issue.  Was a lot of fun watching rogues trade evasion tanking, and a lot of CC.
---
Currently I am going down the SM route as well but early on I out into stam and hearthstone in demo tree for quality of life.
---
Right, and distance travelled is the dependent variable.
---
Your distance increases as time passes.
---
Time will pass regardless of whether your distance increases.
---
The distance travelled depends on the amount of time that passes, you might say. Passage of time is wholly independent of your form of travel, or indeed whether you stand still.
---
Ok thx.
---
This one has more armor and stats but the active is the same
---
I rolled ashkandi and am stale of no world PvP basically, might go back when BGS come out, it’s not like I’m deleting my toon, just wanna swap focus to a PvP server. I’m not “sweaty” at the game anyways so being behind doesn’t bother me.
---
I have both a 60 Warrior and a 60 Rogue and the Rogue was significantly worse to level. Sweeping strikes makes Warriors pretty efficient but blade flurry really doesn't do much for Rogues.
---
They were running DM.  This man has class.
---
Agree. I use a side mouse button to have the pet attack. There's lots of times where you want to cast DoTs on enemies without your pet doing anything.
---
sorry, you can only have one.
---
I love everything about the Alliance.  Except the players.  Horde convert and never going back
---
Nost grizzly omegalul, high qual disband before BWL guild right there. Haven't been a complete mess since post SC1 or anything.
---
The poor man’s hearthstone method is a perfect opportunity for a nice smoke break. My lungs may hate me, but my eyes are thankful for a break lol
---
Screaming "STAAAAAABWOOOOOUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRNNNNND" is one of the most pleasing things to do in death metal vocals, right up there with "EATEEEENNNN" by Bloodbath.
---
Number three spot goes to any metal track where you get to go "ÜGH".
---
Happened to me in vanilla also, I passed on the OH as I had it and needed the MH. Raid leader rolled need and won as a DE (We were DEing all the unwanted loot). We were in a rush as AQ was opening, the raid leader was quite aploligetic about missing my roll due to all the russhing and I wasn't too salty... Next day I had a Kroll Blade in my mail from the raid leader; huge expense at the time.
---
I certainly do now lol, gratz op I was mistaken.

Big brain move

---
Thankfully one of my friends is an even sweatier nerd than me and was way ahead of the general population when it came to leveling. He managed to snatch up 2, one for me and one for another buddy.
---
Really is a great way to skill up and make gold, everybody wants 14 slot bags.
---
Cancer. The kind you have to deal with for a prolong period of time.
---
Wtf my guy, just R no need to complicate things
---
there are a lot of guides if you want to google it
---
your skills scale on the damage of the weapon, typically swords are slower and have higher weapon damage
---
You can write macros, that will allow you to change weapons mid-fight, and let you use backstab and all that stuff
---
Are you horde?
---
If yes, swords with sword spec and windfury.
---
If alliance, why?
---
I wouldn't call it pushing it back, considering you've become what you're "fighting". You are it.
---
Our guild left Bigglesworth because the horde was too highly populated... anathema doesn't even sound cool. What or who is anathema anyway?
---
As a healer, I get where you're coming from, but having a party member low on health and not doing anything about it makes me nervous. Back in vanilla I always used to say "*It's not my job to keep you topped off, it's my job to keep you alive*", and while I think that still rings true, I don't like leaving one person low.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
That said: I usually end up compromising and throwing out Renews.
---
Never heard anyone say it is a waste of gold. Please explain to a warlock newb. Leveling one now.
---
He teleports to gnomer from BB (Booty Bay).  It is an attunement quest of sorts.  He has looted 12 acidic walkers and sold them all to NPC vendors.
---
On the "get tank gear" for tanks. This tip is only really needed for 58+. You can tank everything up to like strat/scholo in just full dps gear no problem.
---
Younmean badlands? Blasted lands quests are 50
---
I've been ganked 3 times. And i've ganked others twice. 
---
As long as nobody spawn camps i don't care. The spawn camping thing is pretty ruthless tho and a dick move.
---
I am not in anyway making fun of some one else ignorance of the situation being asked a out.
---
Back in vanilla, one of our off tanks never had the gold for an epic mount. After a few months of us getting tired of ragging on him, several in our guild pooled some gold together and bought him his epic undead steed. The green one that he always wanted. We wrapped it up with some wrapping paper then traded it to him one raid night. He was truly blown away, and that was one of my favorite moments of vanilla. US-Bloodhoof Horde
---
This is what you choose to post about?
---
Who cares...
---
what do you mean if alliance
---
How dare you.
---
how would i write that macro
---
idgaf what you think the icons mean lmao.
---
But then how do you accidentally disable/enable nameplates?
---
Definitely ah them
---
Yeah. North East side of the zone with the goblins.
---
Nope, you'll be fine.
---
I mean feel free to do that.
---
You might get booted because nobody like you rolling need on every item that drops.
---
got it at 303 runs
---
Why aren’t you horde...
---
For others, this is a reference to one of Blizzard's earliest games, back when the company was called "Silicon &amp; Synapse". 
---
They're fantastic action puzzle games.
---
Yeah bro that 2c profit margin is WIIILDDDDD
---
I still don’t understand the gold problem.  I’m level 38 on my third character to 60 (2 on private servers before Classic), and have always had more than enough to get a mount when I ding 40, and the epic one at 60.
---
I currently have 98 gold, all skills learned, all 12 slot bags. First aid almost maxed. I estimate by level 40, I will have 130 gold.
---
Get gathering professions.  
---
Don’t bitch about low drop rate quests. 
---
Sell everything you can on the AH. If the profit is less than 10c, buy everything up and repost.  
---
Don’t suck.
---
Dude you're asking questions about a 15 year old game that have already been asked 1000s of times. Use the internet, my friend.
---
Oh to be a teenager again
---
Hey, Johnny Drama doesn't pay for it alrite?
---
At a point it's better to get agi for crit rating
---
No - you're just adding to it by being a "toxic piece of shit" (your words) in every regard.
---
dope as fuck, but bit hard to see health and mana.
---
| Druids have a very difficult time in this game being that it is worse than all the other classes at any role.
---
Lol this guy is definitely trolling. Or maybe needs to reroll
---
Server discords are cancer. They are owned by specific players on &lt;insert server here&gt; and they will always spin stories to benefit themselves. Do yourselves a favor and avoid them. You're not missing anything of legitimate substance or value.
---
This was my rule for a long time, until running as a healer in classic, seeing skullflame shield drop, tank rolls need, three of the party roll greed, and the mage needs, wins, and teleports.  
---
Since then it's everyone roll need.  
---
You also get the people who roll need for an item that's an upgrade, but decide the sweet call of gold is more important than stats, and they sell it anyway. So... everyone roll need.
---
It sucks, but greed is a thing. Once again, these are the issues that have let to retail being the game it is.
---
Tell her to stop buying gold
---
Which has nothing even remotely to do with why i am posting here tonight. Keep up bro, cmon you have tue most replies so far as is.
---
Wow, chill out, dude! You aren't winning any hearts and minds getting so emotional and lashing out at people. You should take the backlash as a sign you need to moderate your own vitriolic reactions.
---
The more you get upset and attack people here, the more people are going to disregard you.
---
No, i imagine there are plenty of people doing that to make money through the goblin AH
---
I prefer swords with hemo, use whatever nice slow main hand you find that'll benefit from the instant attacks Hemo and Ghostly strike provide. Using daggers gives you access to Ambush and backstab, however these imo are more situational abilities. You'll what to be using cheap shot more often than not especially if you pick up dirty tricks. Ghostly does more damage than hemo and you can use it when it's available, or save it for emergency situations against melee, it's effect stacks with evasion. All in all it is not a must have, if you're struggling to fit it into your build. Just my 2 cents
---

Bigglesworth!
---
Tbf, it was WoW in a perfect state. One of the best plots we’ve had, great community, fun questing/zones, great raids, the tournament, etc.
---
I will still always agree that flying never should have been in WoW at all, or at least have it be *much* more limited.
---
You shouldnt have to ring them to find out why you are banned check your emails or account page
---
Swords
---
And a summary execution
---
Sold a cooldown for 10 gold
---
&gt; imagine reading the above posts and thinking that the mage never looked at a video or stream of another person doing what they are described as attempting to do
---
This may come as a shock, but not everyone watches Twitch or looks up guides on youtube. The guy could've done that, but he just as well could have not. 
---
New players have no idea what they're doing, what may seem as completely obvious to you, with a lot of experience, is actually NOT the same to everyone.
---
&gt; "how can I passively aggressively shit on someone online in such a manner as to affect their cognitive reasoning abilities so they regret sharing their words on the internet ever again."
---
Funny. Maybe you should look at your original reply. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
---
Alliance on Razorgore. New WoW player and looking for a social raiding guild. Level 33 at the moment as a feral Druid and will respec to Resto once I'm 60. 
---
Can play at any time Friday to Sunday, but unavailable Monday (6PM to 9PM), Tuesday (7PM to 8PM), Wednesday (6PM to 9PM), and Thursday (8PM to 9PM) due to some very weird school schedules this year.
---
Ready to be as dedicated to this as my schedule will allow me!
---
Can't really use a mic but I understand English perfectly for vioce coms during raids and I'm active on discord.
---
It's actually more fair if you set the blanket rule of everyone Need all blue/epic BoEs. Everyone is bound to win something which they can then sell and do as they wish with the gold.
---
Using a Need over Greed system for high value BoEs opens the door for ninjas and drama.
---
+1 for Smolderweb
---
Wave to Rekta if you see him/me.
---
Slow high damage sword in main hand, whatever you have that is fast with level appropriate damage in the offhand.
---
Right now at 44, I'm using the sword from RFD quest, and the dagger from SM quest. I am consistently top dps in my groups
---
I'm not sure you're quite immature enough for Reddit. Do your grandkids know you're up this late?
---
Anyway, I know I have a helluva fun time when it comes with sexual gratification, especially when healslutting dungeons. I got myself off twice yesterday on an intense UBRS run, and I wasn't even RPing.
---
 
---
&gt; Are you on a PvP server? Go pick fights in Barrens. 
---
Being in the Barrens is no different no matter what server you're on. In all servers, an Alliance would be automatically flagged for PVP and a Horde would only be pvp flagged if they chose to be.
---
Met up with /u/FrostedJelly88 for a toast this evening :)   Thank you for sharing this with us and allowing us to join you in honoring him.

Yup! Several times a week
---
I dont care who doesnt agree with me. Im pretty much all alone in this comment chain as is because i called out the people saying this type of behavior is funny to them. Imagine how frustrated the other player was that even though he logged back in to ask for help, for the third time, they still trolled him? Ever heard of be kind to others or face the consequences? The consequences of continued trolling is getting some one like me who is now irrationally upset that they can treat another human being the way they are and still think that it is funny in some way or another. This chain of comments is way more out there in scope than just the interaction you see here in the game, and if you read any of the comments beyond one or two, you would understand where we are.
---
You'll get over it... with a step ladder.
---
my target starts at 14.50, though i think most stores it’s 13.50. the goal is 15/h by the end of 2020
---
nobody cares its ubrs
---
This has been theory-crafted to death on private servers, increasing your kill speed at the cost of downtime =/= faster leveling, managing VW properly and using it to handle mobs properly is far more profitable in the long run than running with other pets, using other pets = facetanking, which means you either burn your mana to kill it or sit there getting hit, you can cast fear but that also causes other problems with range and pulling issues.
---
You consume hp/mana far more using any other pet and that alone will give you a lot more downtime than the added kill speed, the leveling process is not about how fast you kill stuff but about how: your kill speed + your downtime + your travel time = total leveling speed.
---
Only considering kill speed is a horrible mistake a lot of nubs do, you can test this theory yourself by just triple dots +wanding while pet tanks ( without over aggroing), you 'll soon realize that you end fights with relatively full hp/mana ( almost) , so u can chain pull without stopping, the added 4-5 secs of kill time outscales the 20 secs drink/eating downtime that you'll have to do every 2 pulls without a vw.
---
I never heal warlocks other than the occasional rejuvenation when I'm within 5 seconds of casting and I have an abundance of mana. I've never had a single complaint.
---
Reading the chart initially I was fucking confused at why aspect was shitier than walking and why a normal mount was better than epic, than I realised the chart was graphed incorrectly
---
&gt; cmon you have the most replies so far as is.
---
Looking from your post history, I doubt it.
---
So, you're trying to stand up and discourage toxic behaviour by being exactly that. It's quite relevant.
---
There are abilities which don't require a dagger, such as sinister strike
---
Running quest together with 4 horde. 15 minutes and we didn't attack each other, and helped each other kill mobs.
---
Ha yes best AH buy.... When I turned them in I thought for sure 6 quests would make me ding but it only filled up three bars
---
It is a point of view (opinion) when you are just wrong though.
---
OP has it right distance is the correct choice for x-axis, because it is the independent variable. That IS convention, and that isn't even open for argument.
---
We can highlight this by the question being asked. I come up to you and say "should I mount up or keep running?" You need more information right? So you need to ask a question. Realistically you have one question to ask to be able to provide me with the information. Here are your options 1 or 2.
---
1. How far do you have to go?
---
2. How long do you need to go?
---
Well according to YOU the information you need is number 2.
---
Of course that makes absolutely no sense. How long I need to go is DEPENDENT on other variables...specifically how far do I need to go.
---
So after realizing you are an idiot you would instead ask "How far do you need to go?" At which point I could tell you, you then take that distance put it on the x axis of the graph and then use the y-axis (dependent variable) to identify what the optimal means of transportation is.
---
According to you, we would have distance on the Y-axis (indicating it is the dependent variable), which it turns out would get you marked wrong in pretty much any course involving graphing.
---
Why because independent and dependent variables are in fact standard conventions when it comes to graphing. You can be wrong with them, and in this case you are.
---
Damn you're stupid.
---
Prnt Scrn
---
They used me as a pinball the other day and managed to kick me towards the ledge even though I was hugging a wall. Landed on a few pixels of floor left. Wasn't even mad, that was fun.
---
Nope just confirmation bias and rng. You should be around 15% crit to recall notice it hitting like a truck every 4th one
---
They always had an extremely fast respawning rate
---
I'm so happy this mentality didn't exist in vanilla (in my experience) and I have yet to run into it now. I guess that's the value of building and maintaining relationships on my server.
---
&gt; Allways buy all your skills
---
No. There's a lot of skills who do fuck all.
---
Mind Soothe for Priests is infamous. Mind Vision is cute but, lets face it, also useless. Smite and Holy Fire ranks are also completely useless, unless you're for some reason leveling as Holy (why?). 
---
A lot of Warrior skills do xx damage + weapon damage, so you have Overpower (which is really strong early on) where you deal 15 damage + weapon damage, and you can pay 2G to deal 25 damage + weapon damage - no thanks, I'll have my mount instead. 
---
Every class has spells like this. In OP's case for instance warlocks can skip ranks of some grimoires because you can just buy the latest rank, you don't have to buy them all one by one. 
---
You buy what you NEED. Telling new players to buy everything is setting them up to have like no gold at 40 and still be walking for god knows how long.
---
Stack that
---
if you're alliance that's because it's horde only
---
&gt;  he’s the firm’s founding partner and only works the stuff that interests him, got tons of time for his youngest son

Literally read the comment you were snarking dude. Seriously.
---
Sunder tab sunder tab repeat 
---
if you have a ton of rage, weave in heroic strike/cleave, and demo&amp;battle shouts
---
Window has to be open, the function interacts with the merchant UI.
---
Eh, that requires effort.
---
Ill still sit here and defend the person to the bitter end. Its funny the first time. Not the third time. Its plain cruel and that's all it ever will be, and to have posters sit there and defend the troll to no end is perpetuating the toxic behavior and will continue to add to it all instead of having some one say no.
---
We got chased by a couple of the elite trolls in stromgarde keep to the main path in arathi last night
---
And 1% parry
---
The lack of skeletons on the ground tell me this is a PvE server.
---
&lt;Toxic&gt; From Fairbanks representing, We are the real toxic.  Toxicgaming.us
---
Yeh the mod of the Yojamba discord is an absolute waste of oxygen. The type that’s tells you to get cancer when you tag a mob he was next to lol.
---
You're not saying "no" though, you're spewing more toxicity than the original image and people laughing with/to it...
---
As I said, fire with fire.

I got a /w to tank Deadmines.
---
... While I was tanking Deadmines.
---
Vanilla WoW is a masterpiece of a game by itself.
---
Can someone tell me the macro I should be using for feign death / frost trap? Everything I find online is different and it never works when someone attacks me
---
So charge in?  And how do you determine the appropriate times for battle and demo shout?
---
This! I ran mining/herbing for a while then swapped to mining/skinning which is far more lucrative.
---
Stack Spirit as a mainstat at lower lvls and you have 0 downtime.
---
My favorite thing to do to my guild was "How do I quit guild?"
---
Inevitably, someone would type "/gquit" and end up leaving the guild. After guild rep became a thing, my GM politely asked me to stop. Lol.
---
One guy fell for it twice.
---
How is it not success? Just coz a raid decided to pool gear doesn’t mean shit
---
What if I have no rage?  If I pull a pack of three mobs Los, I'll have no rage when they get to me.
---
In vanilla I remember rogues using crippling poison on their oh to deal with runaway mobs. Now... nope. Not once.
---
"But muh dahmug metrs"
---
I mean whatever you enjoy. I just can’t imagine playing on a PVE server and regretting it. Especially for classic balanced world PVP.
---
Looks like shadowed unit frames.
---
Auto-correct :( ya boomkins.

I just noticed that I had STARTED to work on bleeping my potty mouth....and then...[well you know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzNwK7fzz38)

I got like 200 Runs and didnt even got HOJ, gg
---
Ashkandi is wonderful.
---
The Runecloth Bag recipe is only available there, and 100% of tailoring guides use this recipe to level the profession.
---
This is incredibly helpful. Also never knew about the 29/11/11 build or solo farming Mara princess. 
---
Think I’ll try hotw for this phase. Others are saying they went pure feral at 14/32/5 and wasn’t sure if you had considered that. Personally, i enjoy the hybrid and survivability  aspect of druids so that’s why hotw appealed to me.
---
I actually expected my enjoyment would be much more nostalgia-based than it has been. There's still nostalgia for sure, but the game is actually good enough to hold my interest again where no expansion really has since cata came out. I expected to play a few weeks and have filled my nostalgia, maybe remember that it wasn't all rosy and it wasn't as good as I remember. But instead I found that it in fact is as good as I remember.
---
As a priest, first thing I do on the game is look for mage water, last thing I do is give extra to someone else who can use it.
---
Slam is garbage while leveling. It has a cast time that’s interruptible and will clip your autos.
---
You get the deposit back on a sale. AH takes a cut and also mail costs like 2s. Low level greens vendor for like 1s but I’ve been selling them for 10s-40s depending on stats.
---
When did I ever say that?
---
Battle shout unless it's 5 or more mobs
---
Mobs will chase you pretty much forever as long you keep hitting them. It seem to vary a bit.
---
A tip for people that can't do elite quests like the giant spider Shandra is to pull it to a town like Tarren mill.
---
When your healer doesnt need to drink sure. (Even then I would argue that going 100to 1% is stupid) But what I see most of the time is warlocks tapping to 1% and then just standing there while the healer drinks :) 
---
This also happens during boss fights, where you risk your self dying if the boss has some ability it can cast on you. And you literally lose the same amount of time tapping you would if you did it gradually.
---
Wait he was in the arena and is butt hurt he was killed? What?
---
I have made at least 50G from doing this. I just buy the mats from the AH during peak hours for super cheap and vendor the grenades.
---
I'm digging that action bar on the left
---
Are you honestly saying that people will just listen if some one says... "no". They really dont dude, they will always poke again, exactly like all the other commenters did. I made my statement and instead of just moving on, they poked me as well... so nah ill comment if they comment. Its that simple. If they want to troll, cool do it. If they want to discuss whats going on in the picture instead of going on a rant of how much of a snowflake i am for defending some ones ignorance, than lets go dude, seriously i want to hear why anyone thinks the type of behavior in the picture beyond the first joke is appropriate in any way. Please enlighten me because honestly i cant see why. Educate the person so they dont end up on this board again.
---
Druids need to be in a very specific spec/gear to solo mara and they are unable to do solo DM trib, so no, the hunter will be better.
---
Watch the classic one too!
---
LOL

---
Honestly. I try to plan my moonglade trips around my hearth
---
Respect. Now if only we could use these for lightsabers.
---
Even if you know how to tank, just keep the taunt button hot and ready. People will just pick whatever target and go all out, ignore threat, pull shit for you, and if you get unlucky and miss a few times you lose threat anyway and mobs run off and attack the healer.
---
Sometimes you’ll walk up and hit an enemy and it will just run right past you and start hitting the healer who is sitting drinking and doing no damage or healing. It’s all wonky in classic. Basically just pay attention.
---
Zandalar Tribe-EU :).
---
Good stuff !
---
This isn't cheating.  It's a dick move, but certainly not cheating.
---
Look, certain allowances can be made for being on the spectrum, but surely you must understand that in general people expect the dependent variable to be on the Y axis. No amount of bullet points changes that, and there’s nothing wrong with people expecting that.
---
it is possible that someone's already bought that item but isn't wearing it (for this reason) so they roll need equip the item that they already have and then sell the one they just won.
---
and there'd be no way to tell...
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Back in 04, I played a priest and leveled slower than my friends (less playtime).  When I entered this area.  The friend group I hung out with said f this zone!  Take all our pages and gtfo.
---
So multiple people have suggested this to you? Weird!
---
Pretty sure you could just do it again, but why not just pick it back up from thrall? No downside and it's the safer option
---
Damage Meters are probably the 6th or 7th thing I care about on a run.
---
* Was it fun?
---
* Was it smooth?
---
* Did I meet cool people?
---
* Did we execute the mechanics well?
---
* Was it profitable?
---
* Did we get someone something they needed?
---
* How was the Damage Done/Overheal meters?
---
This is great and I wish there were more mages like you!
---
One suggestion I have for you, is that healers a likely going to use at least double or triple the amount of water than the other mana users in the group, so factor that in.
---
I can remember people saying ding in a text based mud.
---
yeah, idk, atm i'm not really running dungeons and no boe's have dropped. i think when i start doing 50+ ones, i will just double check.
---
Came here hoping someone would mention!
---
It’s easier and looks better?
---
glad you're backing me up
---
&gt; SUPPLY YOUR OWN FOOD if there is no mage in the group. I love watching everyone drink while the warlock sits there and life taps knowing that the healer will heal them after he refills his whole mana bar drinking his expensive drinks.
---
Stop worrying about the warlock's health and pull the next group. You clearly don't know anything about warlocks. We self heal by doing damage. We life tap between pulls to replenish mana and maintain our dps during fights.
---
&gt;That's different, people ~~afk~~ farm 24/7 at ~~Qia~~ [farm spot] not answering whispers etc are most likely using scripts. It takes 10 seconds to make or find a script
---
&gt;the only reason I dont feel pressured to grind to 60 asap is coz &gt;classic isnt going anywhere. And that is the best part!
---
You get it
---
Natural Shapeshifter and OOC are top tier talents for PvP especially niche stuff like flag running.
---
Under what circumstance if you're trying to kill a horse with a bladed weapon are you gonna go for the hooves
---
And don't give me some "in pitched battle with a horse you might strike the hooves!" bullshit, it's pure game logic :p
---
Tbh I'd only keep enchanting if you're going to get access to the rare raid drops. Enchanting otherwise feels like a sink as you're kind forced to sit in town and advertise to sell your services and doesnt provide any personal gain unless you're a tank druid for the trinket.
---
I'd drop it since its low lvl
---
The point is that there is no "right" or "wrong" answer here, as much as you think there is. Different people have different opinions on how boes should be handled. The only objective truth is that you should state your loot rules before the run starts. If you don't like somebody's loot rules, don't run with them.
---
I killed myself on public property and someone photographed my corpse, how could this happen to me?
---
You'll end up sacking that VW for a shield
---
My GM is max enchanting so he’ll have everything I need I’m sure.  I can’t force myself to DE greens that sell for so much gold haha
---
Oh now it’s sarcasm? Boomers learning how to back peddle now. I’m proud of you.
---
Don't have the distance for these hours
---
No you were just already aware of what was meant in the first place and therefore tolerated the term when it actually describes a different pattern of movement. I am also aware that you or anyone here would admit that. You are in too deep already.  
---
Wikipedia confirms that: A **zigzag** is a [pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern) made up of small corners at variable angles, though constant within the zigzag, tracing a path between two [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines). (There is also a picture, if you need that ;) )  
---
If she just runs clockwise around the coloumn, then counterclockwise around the coloumn, the criteria for zigzag are not met.
---
I need because I know there will be others who cannot contain themselves.
---
I just want an even playing field for all.
---
False. Goblin rocket helmet got only 20 min cd
---
Or anything at all that they want/need.
---
I'm almost certain using any ability that causes threat will keep the mob interested. Damage, healing, self buffs etc.
---
&gt;  and, like you, at best only have very rudimentary understanding of what they should be doing and how things play out. 
---
Is this you trying to say I have no idea what I'm talking about in a bitchy way?
---
Warriors are known to be a very easy match up for hunters that know what they're doing and you don't seem to be understanding my explanation.

You use the fact your slow is 10% more powerful to get some distance and THEN you use Cheetah to get out of melee ranged before they can react. Assuming you time it properly it is very easy to get out of melee range before they can get any ability off because you have nearly a 50% difference in speed.
---
Why don't you actually try using it before chatting shit. Cheetah toggling is an integral part of hunter pvp.

Yeah he was standing right next to the chest as it spawned with a flare on top of himself.
---
Does msbt not also work for this?
---
I'm curious as to how that score is derived.
---
If its e.g. gear, then this can easily be explained by RNG and that guilds loot approach.
---
weren't they banging each other's chick?
---
bind scroll wheel down to that macro you created. significantly increase your odds of clicking before someone else.
---
I suspect that there is a good chance they re doing something similar. They may be cheating or using an autoclicker, but i've found scrollwheel is just as effective as most clicker scripts.
---
&gt;  BoP items have gold value too, so I don’t see how that would be any different.
---
Do you actually not see a difference between 1g and 100g, or are you just intentionally being obtuse?
---
How does world PvP and a PVE server correlate? Am I missing something. Nobody in PVE worlds are flagged. Everyone does everything safely. I want more of a challenge and experience
---
well, idk. not sure how auctioneer works. i've heard about some AH addons that do market value i.e. what it's worth across all realms not just yours, so it may be that.
---
it may be your ah/realm is whack when it comes to DEing items i.e. enchant mats are worth a lot
---
easiest thing to do is to test:
---
- Note down vendor sell price (what you receive if you vendor item)
---
- DE
---
- Note down results
---
- Sell the mats
---
- Record sale price (enchant items don't have an ah fee so you can relist them w/o cost)
---
- compare the 2 prices
---
You should be aware that there will be fluctuations i.e. you can get between 1-3 mats per item and it's profitable on 1.5 items, so if you get a string of 1s instead of 2s/3s, you'll lose money
---
Now we are phase 1?
---
Yep.  2-3 minutes is way too short for mp/5 to be of much value.  It's better to front load int, and use +heal.  But there are a couple distinctions in current tier, and that's why pretending there's 1 bis is objectively incorrect.

A boomkin is 8th dps. Methinks the logs are fucky.

Are you cheetah flag running as a 39 twink or at 60?

The point was that it parried your attack with the hooves.

"Parrying"
---
It has to parry with something, in this instance the assumption is that it parries with its hooves.

Whats the map addon? Understand it is elvui but im using zperl and want just that map.

Can ima\_dreamwalker please do an art piece of something like this :O

Also how big is your screen if the text is that small? Is that a custom chat frame?

Sooner or later you'll need a tank. If you're a group of 4 you can just pug one anyways.

Lmfao they used to just stop but now they carry on is funny as fuck.

100g is more than 1g.

What's the name of the addon for those raid frames? I want them, too.
---
My homie is a hunter and has the opposite, he says it crits like all the time lol
---
You think killing low level players gave dishonorable kills? Lol.
---
Most people don't tip anything. It's especially bad when they hassle level 50s who can only conjure 2 per cast. 10 casts per stack... and they have the audacity to ask for 5 stacks.
---
Don’t rank up all your abilities. Only useful ones. That’s generally how most people waste gold before 40. Killing random shit for meat / vendor items etc.
---
I suppose it's just a preference thing then - glad you like the design!  
---
Since you're a warrior and I've got your attention, I'm interested to know what you'd prefer in terms of colour scheme. I'd love to make a variant of the UI for each class, but I'm unsure how best to handle warrior, as their energy colour is red as is the health.  
---
Would you prefer a class colour healthbar, or would you opt to change the energy colour to something other than red?
---
Daish, he’s a nutcase.
---
Razorgore EU? I think I'm in this bank guild too
---
I suggest getting over your irrational fear of group content if you want to do pvp. You need gear for that. Preferably with a lot of stamina.
---
staysafe was right, all zoomers
---
Fairbanks has the worst. @everyone is left on and the mods and admins are immature assholes and trolls.
---
I've never seen this. If someone wants to buy your item, you earn the gold regardless of their class. Usually people who advertise like that are letting people know it is an ideal item for that class.
---
I just try not to shit in my underwear and then I don't need to worry about weirdo inside-out methods.

what a weird perspective you have...
---
Personal preference but I have a separate binding for pet attack. The reasoning being that I'll often set my pet onto something and dot it up, then walk off to dot up a second mob and fear it. I don't want my VW to go chasing after a feared mob, and I don't want to have to start a cast on the original target then cancel just to get my pet back on the proper target.
---
Hit the mobs to build rage. Try to get your groups to let you land a few hits to build threat before they open up. If you have a targeting macro put a Skull on the first target and tell them that (after waiting) they should hit the main target at least once before they start AoEing. 
---
The thing that makes runs smoother is to finish fights with a full rage bar. Once you have the mobs under control don't spam your abilities and instead let your rage grow as the last of them die. Then your healer can drop one last heal on that tapping Warlock and then sit to drink as you move forward to the next pack of mobs. While their mana bar is filling up you pull and have the time and the rage to get threat on all the mobs before the healer needs to start dropping heals on you.
---
If you have one, try the same thing on another computer. Also, you can get a 50ft cat 5 cable for fairly cheap if you don't want to move your system. It's worth having one for network troubleshooting.
---
You clearly don't
---
Let the priest run it back. If they pull it back to the tank and nobody is doing anything about it, then do your best to get the aggro off the priest.
---
I tried this spot on my server at 39 and it was very heavily farmed, so I went back to alternating between Shimmering Flats and the basilisks along the coast of STV. Lower xp and gold in those two places, but I didn't have any downtime, so it felt more productive for me. You're absolutely right about the quest/grind win-win of Badlands though, if you can find a time when it's less populated.
---
I got my mount at 43 and don't have an epic at 60
---
Wow, newbies are face-tanking Wailing Caverns at level 17? 
---
I never saw that coming for Classic.
---
Honestly? Stop buying skills that aren't critical to leveling, keep questing. You'll get it by lvl 43ish.
---
I'm not going to claim this is optimal, but it's simple and stress free.
---
I think your conception of “retail” is wrong. Classic WoW is part of retail just in the same way as BFA is. What I described happened on a retail classic server. You pay for retail and it’s official, that’s the difference.
---
I hope they never change this. It seriously made my night knowing I could childishly fuck around and actually have good genuine fun. 2 of my buddy's got on just to watch just from hearing me geek in discord. We were all laughing for like an hour straight.

i love it

Yep, a few days ago there was another post with one of their members trying to steal devilsaur leather by waiting around watching somebody kill it and then trying to skin it faster than them (same faction so you can't do anything about it). Post was also removed.  
---
Pretty much a scummy guild, spread the word to your friends and guildmates and just avoid them.
---
It’s just in the regular settings. ‘Display raid style party frames’
---
That guy eats dead people.
---
As wholesome as this is, I can’t help but notice something off about the guys name..
---
Isnt it blizzards raid frames? I think it is.
---
This is to prevent spells like Hellfire and Blizzard from losing ticks if the caster starts taking damage during the channel. Its a huge dps loss if they start getting spell pushback.
---
When kill times are very short, all the managimped classes get to shine bright like a diamond my dude.
---
Can you name a specific gold amount where this logic kicks in? 
---
1 gold 100 times equals what?
---
There’s also an addon called VanKoS that does something similar. It notifies you if there is someone on your hate or nice list. 
---
I use the hate list to know who to avoid for X reason (I call it my ‘shit list’) and the nice list to know what was well... nice.
---
So even if you’re not on a PvP server such as myself, it’s still useful
---

Nothing wrong with multiboxing but he is right, 1 input 5 outputs. Not a big deal, that's how it all works but it is incorrect to say 1 input 1 output — not that it matters all that much.
---
Yeah if you get any + spirit hang on to it and equip it while you drink.
---
The guide you linked says 40, not 30, but there's no math to back it up. Also this is going to depend on your talents.  A prot warrior doesn't benefit from agi nearly as much as an arms warrior with their bleed proc.
---
So let's do an example. If you have 100 dps at level 40 (which you don't) and you add 20 strength, then you have about 103 dps. 20 agility would be 1% crit which is for a prot warrior is about 101 dps. An arms warrior with the bleed proc would get more benefit but it would still be less than the 103 dps from the strength. Rage also doesn't get multiplied any more by a crit, it's based entirely on damage dealt and as we can see strength deals more damage. I've read this and confirmed it myself. I believe crits were given a rage multiplier in an expansion but not in vanilla or classic. 
---
There is eventually a point where agility starts to surpass strength in offense, but it's most certainly higher than at level 40. I would guess not until 60. The defensive bonus to blocks vs dodging is harder to quantify, so an argument could be made there. It depends on a lot of factors like how hard the enemies are hitting and how often you use shield block. level difference between you and the enemy.  I really haven't done the research to say for sure. I can only say confidently that agi is weaker than strength for offense by a good margin.
---
Such a chore. No thanks. Im super fed up with people asking for ports and water already. Even if they offer to pay. Oh wow 1g. I already have an epic mount and 3k gold, i dont care about a single gold.
---
Grimoires make up for the fact we get a free mount, I think it's a pretty good tradeoff considering the combined cost of them all doesn't equal that of a mount anyway.
---
But you're looking at it wrong. Time passes as it always would, yes. But what you care about is "should I mount up to run to that herb?" The amount of time it takes to run to that herb changes depending on your method of travel. Time is absolutely dependant on distance in this case because at a longer distance, you would mount up instead of run, changing the time it took to do so.

Oh, you're a mage? Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich.

Is this actually true? I literally often see two nodes next to each other with 2-3x per node. I often get x5 lotuses in one go in tanaris. This happens in at least 3 different spots so can get 9 nodes in one ride around. 
---
For context, this is on felstriker realm oceanic
---
N    I    C    E
---
This is actually VERY misinformed. 
---
After level 30 fighting 2 mobs at the same time is actually FASTER than fighting a single mob because sweeping strikes doubles the power of your strongest ability, Whirlwind and also Cleave, so both of those skills hit twice for the amount of rage spent. You basically have on-command Windfury but only against 2 targets at once.
---
Cleaving 2 mobs at the same time makes Warrior leveling pretty easy and you can also handle large groups very effectively if you pop your big counter attack CD which I see most Warriors saving for when they're gonna die (worst way to use it technically, because although it might save you a lot of the potential damage it can deal is wasted due to your low hp.)
---
Even after you get MS, cleaving 2 mobs at the same time with sweeping strikes is the quickest way to level up and makes Warrior leveling a lot more fun imo.
---
We do? PM please!
---
I'm just glad I'm not alone in having a sensible position on BoE rares/epics.
---
During the buildup I wasn't excited one bit. When the game launched I didn't bother at all as my friends sat in those queues for hours. A few weeks later I logged in for fun. Now I'm completely hooked. Didn't expect this at all.
---
What I don't understand is Blizzards hardon for squashing census sites. That shit is public information for retail, why do they keep it secret in classic?
---
If your server is not ever “full” then yeah, it’s bound to be dead.

Is this the group that had to layer hop to get this done because Esfand and his crew were slaughtering you all on another layer?
---
Then just make the lower lvl ones....at lvl 50, I don't have time to hand out stacks of the lvl 45 water, that'd take forever. I'd happily hand out lvl 35 water though.
---
I was 35 then, am 50 now.  
---
Same perspective though.

As other users said, contact blizzard asap and let them know somebody has been logging into your account. This will be helpful for them and you, and gets rid of the chance that you could get banned.

Change yer password.

I did. I hit this bump HARD at the low 30s. It took me forever to get past 33/34. Ever since I broke through that though I’ve been hitting it good. Breezed right past and through 40. 48 right now and going strong.
---
thats why you dont suck at it and use just after auto. note that slam is viable only with slow weps.
---
A good place to go if you're up to brainless farming and skinning if you have it is the eastern coast of tanaris not far from gadgetstan. There are turtles there (42-43) that drop a grey item called "Speckled Shell Fragment" they stack up to 5 and a stack sells for 45s 90c to a vendor. They also drop turtle meat which you can auction and clams with clam meat and pearls which you can also auction and you can skin them too of course. The drop chance on the fragments are about 50%. Farm a level there and you can make like 6-10 gold every hour or so off of the loot they drop.
---
16 debuff limit IS the increased cap. Otherwise it would've been at 8.
---
If you equipped it after rolling need it’s not a ninja, plain and simple.
---
I was running rfk with a pug a few weeks ago. Feet of the Lynx dropped for us. Now even though Im a rogue and it was an upgrade for me, I under stand that those boots are a bis twink item, and that in a few months they could be worth upwards of 100g.
---
Because this it is known, it is understood by everyone that I shouldn't just be given this item to equip so I can ha e a few more agility for a couple of levels until I replace them with the warsong boots.
---
Everyone in my group understood this, because we all know the game. So we all roll greed. The mage won, and I whispered him and offered him 5g for them and he traded them to me, fair and square. Now they're sitting in my bank until I sell them in a few months for a large profit.
---
My point is, just because an item is an upgrade for my class at my level, doesn't mean I should be given an item that could be worth a hundred gold.
---
Everyone deserves a fair shot at that valuable item. If you win it and want to casually throw away that value to have a nice blue for a few levels, go for it. If someone else wins it, offer to buy it if you want to equip it so badly. It dropped for the group, not for you, the group deserves a fair chance to roll on it.
---
And of course some items are very low value and its not really a problem, you need to be aware of the value of items.
---
If I'm in uldaman and PoD drops, I'm not going to just give the level 40 warrior an item worth 2000+ gold just because he can use it. And it would be a sin to even allow him to equip it.
---
I LOVE learning fights blind. Its like a fresh puzzel to me. Relearning stuff ive forgotten a decade ago is great!
---
Wish I could find a raiding guild who shared my extreme journey over destination mentality... (Herod is any weirdos recruiting a lvl 42 semi casual :P)
---
I personally use questie and auctionator as my big game changers.

I also use classic aura durations and omniCC for dot durations

Thank you

Why wouldn’t you want the most packed server? Faerlina is the obvious choice in the US because this is pretty much the only server which is guaranteed to be alive throughout the years. Not to mention that whenever they open transfers as a paid service, everyone will just move to Faerlina, leaving all your heartbreakers and bootysail pirates or whatever you call them completely empty. If you naively think it’s wrong - check out the stats for retail server. One-two servers per region always end up being an accumulation for the entire community.
---
I thought the warlock and paladin mount was free? What do you need to pay?
---
You do you. Im lvling a sub rogue with dagger. And is a lot of fun. Getting thise ambush crit for half the mob hp is amazing. Is also fun in pvp servers. An ambush crit on an 30-50% hp unsuspected pmayer can kill him. And is not dificult to do.
---
You're already 51, you sure your playtime is low? I'd say you're in the top 30% of the population by level...
---
Just do a dungeon a day, you'll have your BiS in time and then you can raid pick up or something.

I think the boss that drops it (Uldaman) is friendly to Alliance (the trio of Dwarves on the left as you enter)

It’s a good idea in UI design to stick with the standard colours for things.

Health bars are green in every game ever. When they aren’t, you can’t see them at a glance.

I would stick to the colours that WoW uses if it were me, save anyone re-learning your scheme “just cause”.

I just hate the questgiver there, since you gotta run in there several times and you can't mount. And the first quest she asks you to bring 7 of each color crystal EVEN WHEN SHE HAS THE WHOLE FUCKING CAVE FULL OF THEM ALREADY.

Hehe! Well, you should invest your time into bind up alot now, and then just learn them before hitting 60 and get comfy with it. Then you can also use same binds on other chars. 
---
Use Ctrl and shift modifiers. G F T Y Z X V , ctrl+ G F T etc, Shift + G F T etc, for example.

Kick should be binded for fast interrupt, and every other ability. I have mine on V, Vanish on T,  Cold blood on G, eviscrate F . And so on :p

It’s so fun, won’t ever get old to me. One thing you can do is do it on the plank to the bait right when it arrives.

Also you don’t need to be in stealth and sometimes that makes it even funnier for some reason. They see you and just know lol.

Probably not, KOTOR came out the same year.

---
Comment from wowhead. people sleep on slam not knowing what they are talking about.
---
"1)Slam does reset the swing counter. It is best used right after a swing.
---
2) Slam triggers the 1.5 second global cooldown regardless of talents
---
3) Slam cast time (yes cast time) is 1.5 seconds but can be reduced to .5 second cast with Improved Slam talent. Slam counts as a spell.
---
4) Slam is not better than Mortal Strike or Whirlwind or any other instant attack. Why? It still takes time to cast and resets the swing counter.
---
5) Slam &gt; HS for 2hand rage dump, regardless of spec. HS has a hidden cost in that it causes your next auto-attack, which HS replaces, to not generate rage. Let's say you would generate 12 rage with that attack (which after the recent rage buff of 2.0.10 is roughly what you would get). HS then costs 15 rage base + 12 hidden cost = 27. HS also has an average delay of weapon speed / 2. It could be at worst case your weapon speed until the damge goes through. In other words, Slam attacks quicker and costs less rage. It is an ideal rage dump for 2handers.
---
6) HS has extra threat associated with it, Slam doesn't. If for whatever god forsaken reason you are 2H tanking, use HS as a rage dump.
---
7) HS &gt; Slam for 1hand rage dump. Why? Most 1hand weapons will attack faster with HS than Slam. Even with the higher rage cost HS is preferrable. Slam's utility is a function of weapon speed.
---
In short, use Slam as a PvE rage dump for 2hand weapons. Mortal Strike and Whirlwind are always better to use than Slam. Use Slam only when you have rage to burn and MS/WW are on cooldown. In PvP and tanking you don't want to trigger global cooldown (GCD) so use HS.
---
I hope this helps someone."

Blizzard sure put those items there to be used.

Couldnt help but notice you gain 95 hp in 2005 but only 90 in 2019 wtf #nochanges
---
Removed me from the group after they started the fight and managed to reset(vanish + feign death) when they were clearly about to wipe. They didn't try negotiating group looting.
---
They didn't talk about it in the recruiting, didn't really say anything during the dungeon except confirm that it's a quest run. After they kicked me from the group the hunter whispered me calling me an ass for not going with the ninja-master looting and throwing shade because of my nationality.
---
I made a copy and went from debating between leveling LW or getting my mount to making profit off of leatherworking while pulling out 60 levels.
---
Thank you so much for this, you've saved me a ton of time and headache.
---
Didn't finish part one of your epic tale. You participated in this.
---
Sorry but that is just silly. I mean, it is even called that a "need" roll because you have need in it for an upgrade and not because you are "greed"y
---
People overthink this stuff too much. 
---
If you need it, need on it, don't go roll greed on an actual upgrade.
---
If hitting 60 is most important to you then I would just continue with the priest and heal to your hears content. However if you want, alternating between characters while stacking up rested XP is also a very viable method at cutting playtime on a character virtually in half if you filled up on rested bonus the entire leveling process.
---
Ok
---
I don’t want you to feel bad. I just want you to take a break from posting.
---
i feel like the boss already dies so quickly it's pointless, but yes it's cool.
---
You can but I don't see why you would
---
At the end of the day, you can do whatever makes you happy.

group pvp*
---
1v1 even at 60 is a pain, even if you were well geared vs prepared opponents (IE not a gank) it isn't always going to go over well.
---
So your raid leader is a hunter?  I am sorry.
---
Not terrible of you do the first few quests where you kill level 28 mobs, then travel to another zone
---
I dont know that, you are right. I think there are less people who leveled up really quickly. Days played or even straight time. How about you?
---
This is why the culling of mages happened. Malygos was right.

*Ayy Lmao*

Yeah that's why OP put the dependent variable on the y axis, time. I don't understand why so many people in this thread can't fathom time being a dependent variable. Yes, time is a constantly moving forward. But the number of seconds to do something can change depending on how it is done, making the number of seconds dependant on the method.
---
If all need then the winner gets 5g worth of upgrades to use at any point. Would you buy the mace for 5g? If not why would you equip it if it is not worth 5g to you and it could be better used on someone else? 5g is still a good amount at lvl 30.
---
Max first aid for me and a bunch of points, almost max,on weapons!
---
It was surprisingly smooth for me, even playing on a pvp server. Nesingwary's was a warzone from time to time, but as long as I kept grinding the quest mobs in less traveled locations, I was mostly left alone. Even had all the Nesingwary quests done by lvl 38 or so.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought backstab / ambush requielred 2 daggers
---
You saved a repair bill!
---
You can for leveling, but typically you want a sword in your main hand if youre combat.
---
But having a fast weapon in your offhand is optimal, so daggers are good there.
---
Didn't mean because of pvp, meant because of efficiency. You wanna start STV as late as possible.
---
sorry but who fucking cares about the minute?
---
That's a lot of wipes! Or are thouse bones of mobs you drinded too?
---
*laughs in Paladin *
---
TL;DR
---
That's what I was doing
---
Ya always gotta do some warmup rolls before you join a group for anything
---
Is 2 swords that much better for leveling? Is 2 daggers way better for 60 pvp?
---
Flat Azeroth confirmed
---
If you know what 30 yards is, why do you struggle to estimate 2x or 3x that?
---
The mats are incredibly cheap until arcanite.
---
Yea, it feels so wrong being able to target people that I can't even see.
---
I tested out, and I was able to target a player inside a cave, I then targeted that player's target and put a raid sign on the mob, the sign shows through walls... Its like wallhack.
---
And the fact that you can never be suprised, no-one can ambush you. Its pretty awful.
---
Wish Blizzard takes a look at it, its too good.
---
Just report them for scam.

&gt; Changing the Loot Method
---
&gt;Should a raid commence under a specific looting system (i.e. Group Loot), and the Raid Leader later swap to a different looting method mid-raid (i.e. Master Looter), this is a direct change to the looting expectations set beforehand. A Raid Leader taking such actions would be considered to have breached the prior arrangement, and any items unfairly distributed in such a situation would constitute a scam case.

An american managed to determine language by a single phrase? Thought they could only speak simplified english
---
Thats awesome man really wish more players out there were like this.
---
new player here (rogue)  
---
and I have no idea about that trick until now, it happen to me a lot time and I was thinking about changing my mouse. lol
---
How is seconds to destination a known thing if it changes depending on the method you use to get there?
---
The whole "need before greed" system is predicated on the basis of BoP items being far more useful to the person equipping it than the people vendoring it. Its a huge upgrade for one person and it's 1g 20s for everyone else. So of course you need before greed.
---
BoE invalidates this logic. That item is immediately saleable by any member of the group. With the gold gained from selling the item, many more items, consumables, mounts, etc. can be purchased. It may be (probably is) a big upgrade for the person willing to equip it, but it also represents gold which could be used to purchase upgrades for any of the other members of the group.
---
How?
---
You dont get sword spec for a long while.
---
Valid argument though. I played for a couple days and got off, I love the game but it was really grindy. I told my roommate who plays that if they ever go to wrath that I’ll start up again. That was my favorite expansion and I put in many hours.
---
I got fucked over like this once. wasnt even mad its funny as hell. but im smarter i ddint swim back and run on dock. I swim in front of boat and wait  
---
till it pushed me. first you get dc. but  you can log back in and get to your destination. so yea.
---
PSA: Dont swim back to dock. Swim in front of boat so boat clips you and pushes you. You will get dc, relog and you will get to your destination.

 Blizzard doing something haha

---
I'm leveling like that. 
---
That's not why I play classic. I want to twink. I want to build a strong permanent twink community.
---
Does this mean I don't understand the classic experience? I started back in 2004. 
---
My 7 year old daughter has it figured out.
---
DON'T YUCK ON SOMEONE ELSE'S YUM.
---
If you need it, need it. Fuck this "loot etiquette" bs
---
Grow up
---
If I offered you a 5$ e-transfer right now OR a 500$ transfer if you message me 6 months from now, which offer would you take?
---
This is off topic, I'm just curious.
---
After you respec shadow the next 5 levels go back into wand spec. You don't have to but you're going to have a hell of a lot more downtime of you don't.
---
Nice, thank you
---
&gt;It dropped for the group, not for you, the group deserves a fair chance to roll on it.
---
by that logic everyone should roll on everything because it dropped for the group, not for you.
---
i dont understand what you're talking about

Three fifty.

You killed a mob nice lol

Awww man I just started my undead rouge the other day almost lvl 20 combat all the way cant wait to see numbers like that.

This site really isn’t a place for price checks.

Answer: more than 2 gold, less than 2,000 gold. Varies.
---
The main reason i open random trades is if i try to delete some shit in my bags an acedemtly click a player sorry :&lt;
---
Where is this?
---
I thought this was a fake cringe post bit it seems real towards the end. You are big baby. This is what pvp is about.
---
Only Death Ray and transporter
---
Same. Found like 3 pages, bought the rest. Cost me less than a gold altogether, easily.
---
Yeah, and this confirms is haha
---
Oh that's good to know - I had been thinking about starting to buy all mats for leveling engineering really since stuff is so cheap. But was afraid that is them have no money for gear, enchants, consumes, etc once I hit 60, but if I can actually profit from vendoring some of it, that might make it all much easier.
---
i am grown up and this is the reason why i just want to play the game. getting killed in pvp is ok, i would change my quest area afterwards. but this is just random kido bullshitting
---
Speed leveling or not, you don’t want to hit that wall at like 36 where all the quests you could possibly do are orange. Ran into it twice now.
---
Which addon are you using for chat? Does it allow you to copy+ paste things or shift click quest names into chat?
---
I just hope he puts it forward to someone else new to the game, and yeah it would be nice! Thanks for reading &lt;3
---
Yeah I was pretty interested in seeing what people had to say about this. Hadn't ran into an experience like this before, and I was mostly surprised that it happened, since the players in their respective faction are supposed to be allies with each other. I paid it back by helping an alli paladin that was nearly dead, and we had a nice emote conversation going. Funny that the "enemy" faction was the one I actually had a nice interaction with
---
Pretty unlikely you're the only person with it, if that's true the price is impossible to estimate.  I've seen it for a few hundred on multiple servers.
---
There are horde is to the west and alliance is to the east of the timber maw tunnel entrance.
---
I'm trying to follow [THIS GUIDE](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/arms-warrior-leveling-guide-1-60) while leveling my Human Warrior.
---
I just hit level 30, and I'm so confused about the talent tree for going Arms 2H... For some reason when I "slide" the bar to match my level, it just jumps from 19, 29, then to 39. I didn't notice this happening, so now I think I messed up my Talent Tree.
---
I already put two points into **Impale**, Should I get sweeping strike?
---
I know the goal normally is to get to 40 and get Mortal Strike, so should I just continue with this path until I hit 40 ? Or?
---
No, it isn’t a matter of skill, lmao.  Not sure how this is still so hard for you to understand.
---
Let’s make it real easy. If you have a warrior in pre raid best in slot dps gear, along with the rest of your raid dps in pre raid bis, and every one of them does their rotation perfectly, the warrior won’t top dps charts. It’s that simple. It’s math. Warriors don’t start topping dps charts until after MC.
---
Simp
---
I'm level 33 and have 61g. How do you people waste all this gold?
---
Bigglesworth Hillsbrad is a terrible, terrible place.
---
It doesn't trivialize things at all, [this](https://imgur.com/O2LZ3Yj) is the played of one of my 3 lvl 60 mages, leveled 95% by questing. 
---
During this journey I grouped up with at least 50 people, either to do dungeon quests or kill quests, just today on my final grind (only did this because I ran out of open world quests) to 60 I helped 8 other chars get a good chunk of xp and Timbermaw Hold rep. Way more than I have grouped up with my main on Retail.
---
Gandling Horde is cool, maybe we will meet each other as well at some time :)
---
Thanks! :) it took a while.  I've played retail for years and I've always used a website called Wago.io and they have import profiles for all the frame and ui add-ons. For whatever reason they have no classic ones. It's so dumb. I spent HOURS trying to find someone's settings. Nothing. I just answered the call.
---
the is no player vs player. its just a kido pushing players of a bridge wow.
---
its like stealing someones wheelchair
---
yea they're dead
---
There has been a bit of a bumpy transition to 'classic' releases of addons hasn't there. Wowinterface has skirted this problem by keeping releases of an addon simple: the latest release is always the latest release. Curseforge on the other hand have alpha/beta/alternate/classic/retail type releases per-addon. [Most of the addon managers](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman#other-addon-managers) worth following have updated their clients to support the Curseforge idiom now, but there was a good month there where everything was breaking in the same way ;)
---
What does it do?
---
Hmm chart should have "charge from critter to critter" for warriors.
---
Everyone does. We have a LAN party at the start of a new World of Warcraft Addon. But we don't play 24/7, we go to the cinema, eat, sleep 6 hours and play the rest of the day. Its more "getting older" friendly. ;-)
---
Haha the last one with the mages is very relatable to me as a tank. There's not much I can do to help but I'm quite happy to let a mage that knows how to manipulate a mob pack with their cc go to town. I just catch any runners with taunts and switch to an offhand and dps
---
Probably not any free ones but I think there's cheaper ones that let you set a local. There's definitely some that have locations here in Aus, most are paid though (if you want any decent connection that is)
---
The way to get it cheap is Amazon or monoprice if that's still a thing. Or, if you want, you can buy a roll of 500 ft and some rj45 ends and a crimper and never worry about network cable again. 
---
Please don't go buy a 50' network patch cable from Walmart or bestbuy. You'll pay 5x the Amazon price. 
---
If you care about gaming, go wired. I've yet to experience any wifi that didn't have something silly happening at some point while gaming.
---
Leveled warrior to 60 and it was miserable.  Had mostly up to date 2h weapons because I tanked dungeons and it was still slow.  Maybe I should've looked into fury, but I leveled entirely as arms.  I'm now leveling a paladin, and I at least have an appreciation for how easy it is, with even less effort.  Only level 21, but I don't even judge a lot of the time since seal of command procs often enough and is basically another weapon swing.
---
I'm sure after the experience you gave him once he gets the chance to help another like you did for him he won't hesitate 👍
---
I’ve ran brd for a chance of those trinkets over 35 times. I have full cleared MC, but still no trinkets from the brd.
---
I know this isn’t particularly related but I don’t really have anywhere to share it. I was in Booty, waiting for the boat at the very edge of the little boarding plank. While waiting, I watched a ?? Level Tauren Hunter jump into the water from the dock to try to escape the guards, who were chasing him for some reason. He ended up slowly swimming right underneath the dock/plank where I was sitting and then finally died from the guards. I laughed and spit on his corpse and then continued to wait for the boat thinking nothing of it.
---
After zoning out for a bit and still no boat, I notice the same Tauren swimming out into the water away from Booty Bay. I don’t really think much of it and just watch him swim and then stop quite a way out, although right in front of me. And then, he takes aim, fires a concussive shot at me, and then one shots me with something and I die right on the edge of the dock, just as the boat is pulling up. I absolutely lost my shit and busted up laughing. It was the most perfect revenge. The guards didn’t even aggro and it looked like he just swam back in and continued about his business.
---
I’m glad there are troublemakers/people who do shit like OP and that Tauren. It makes this game great.
---
Surprised the hunter wanted you to go along with it, and that the rogue didn't object too, that ring is prebis for them too.
---
Whateverasaurs is more like it!
---
And he hid its appearance! What a waste of meme potential.
---
Imagine if you could get such a feeling from doing something of actual substance. Do you have a father in your life?
---
Ppl need to be hording those twink items
---
Isn't that a bit greedy? You would rather equip something that is a small upgrade but not worth the price to buy it yourself so that someone else would not get an upgrade they gladly would pay 5 g for if they had the extra money? Isn't it better it goes to someone that would use the full 5 g value of the item?
---
As a warlock, orange is very doable most of the time ;)  
---
If I can Fear it, I can kill it.
---
It summons in the second boss from BWL to help you kill the drake. There is some RP that Nef has :)
---
Those mobs in that cave were always like that I thought.
---
Like 9 times out of 10 tanking is super fun. Most of the time when someone is messing up that badly they listen to me and stop pulling aggro, but there definitely seems to be certain type of personality. It even got so bad the whole group was telling him to stop. If it wasn't a guild group I would've left much earlier.
---
Someone who's doing well in life doesn't spend this much time trying to convince ONE person in classic wow that they have a great life. 
---
That being said. I think he's trying to convince both of you he's not a loser 😳😖
---
Download threat plates. The name plates will be red if you're top of the threat table, yellow if you're close and green if you're not close to pulling aggro
---
[Horde] [Herod] I and 4 other friends are level 60 raid ready, all MC and ONY attuned, we are 2 mages, 2 rogues, 1 resto shaman and all have experience. Looking for a guild with room for all of us that starts raids at 9-10 pm est, day doesn't matter, and does full runs (no splitting days for molten core)
---
Yup. Flight paths are smoke breaks. Everytime.
---
As a warrior main, thats so incredibly motivating to hear. Im 48 and I have more time logged than my buddies and just feel like quitting sometimes. I know a 60 warrior will be worth it, and thats what keeps me going. But, i'm so grateful to hear that my alt, a warlock lvl 5, will have a better time than this, haha.
---
Work, work.

like I said "max first aid for me"
---
I'm here for my downvote. Mouse wheel forward is charge and intercept.
---
Depends on class imo.
---
I liked Gnomish as a warrior because the Death Ray let me retaliate if I'm being kited to death but other classes would probably like the Goblin stuff better.
---
If you have thorns or any item/ability damaging the mob as they hit you then they will follow you like Arthas followed Mal’ganis, “...to the ends of the Earth!”
---
Yes you do. Through struggle you kept going. No matter how hard you did it on your own. There are many other things you can do as a team in this game but the mount is a special kind of achievement I think it's cool to farm it on your own. And I respect that.
---
My very first classic 60 in 2005 was a rogue, played days and some hours. I grinded 50 to 60 for days.
---
I quit shortly after, because for me, World of Warcraft wasn't fun anymore. It was a big mistake to grind and rush to endgame.
---
Enjoy the game, explore, craft, make friends, go to dungeons, take your time!

Someone watches youtube lion videos

do you know how to leave the guild finally? Or are you still logging in and out?

BoE is all need because of the gold, and so nobody fucks it up.

Tink tink
---
This post is a joke right?
---
Anathema is the shadow damage priest weapon that you get from a pretty challenging quest. It can be turned into Benediction which is the healer version.
---
I’ll second fishing. I did the up and down stv strategy and had 180g when I hit 40.
---
What is said without proof can be rejected without proofs. What you said is untrue and -60 downvotes knowing that there are only 360 upvotes on this post makes at most 360 people who disagree with me if we assume all people who upvoted this post also disagree with me. How many players on classic wow again? 1 million, 2 million? Hmm not even 10^-4% of the playerbase. That sure sounds like almost nobody.... That's not an argument. You would say, you don't agree though That I would believe.
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
You are literally whining in paragraphs
---
It tapers off at 50.

Trust me
---
I still remember when I climbed up there first time back in 2006 when doing Druid cure poison quest. One of coolest/spookiest places in Azeroth. I was pretty amazed when suddenly everything just turned into red.

Gonna make me reroll my warlock stop it lmao
---
Pick a server in a different time zone. How have you not thought of this? I'm baked as hell.and running on half a brain cell!

It would have taken you less time to combine two different screenshots on your computer and upload them through the desktop site than it took you to create this dual picture file for Reddit mobile.

Stop taking pictures of your computer screens. You god damn animals.

Deep dive helmet, recipe from southern azshara
---
Thanks I definitely go for a similar style but dont always prehot though i probably should. I'm torn with a spec at 60 but I think I'll end up with HoTW for a while at first. I'd like to run a full feral dps spec but it doesn't really leave room for much else.
---
There are some QoL things I would love to see in Classic.
---
This is one of them.
---
But rather than have the argument about what is QoL and what is a significant game changer, I would rather leave it the way it is.
---
Fuck I’m jealous
---
Druid is a meme class. Its sad but true. Truly only one druid is needed in a raid so he can buff MotW :( Of course it's super fun to play and even though it's not as good at healing as the other healers it still works.
---
I literally posted you logs of warrior typing charts.
---
Hi a little late but i am a 40 full enh spec and going to be making the switch to ele soon ish. But i have 0 ele gear I am in all SM arm stuff. Where should i start getting this gear?
---
I’m gonna make a horde character on a different pvp server because I want to. I don’t have a 60 yet but I don’t care. I don’t have the time to ever be a serious raider so if it takes me a year to 60 then that is life. Hell maybe I’ll never get 60! Still would do what is fun and try different things. I say go for it!
---
Sometimes world pvp sucks super hard and other times it is a blast. Sometimes you get ganked, and sometimes you get into a back and forth bloodbath in hilsbrad.
---
i hide them all and put them on titan bar
---
So basically, this is only OK if you stop putting them up for auction so often because every time you do, you lose the deposit. Just gotta wait a month or two.
---
How did you get ele gear or did u just start by using ur enh mail
---
Awww she's majestic.. we just gave away an orange fostered cat. I'm still crying over her leaving :))
---
Feels 55/45 or 60/40 horde.
---
That's super-intriguing. Thanks for sharing this inside look.
---
Same here only with the dishes!
---
Yeah II'm in the same boat, teetering on the edge of HoTW. I'm 54 now and would love to go full feral dps but it just limits you a lot and not having NS is a huge bummer if you're PvPing
---
Focus was in classic actually, but it was through scrips that you made it work.
---
After the macros 2.0 overhaul, they just made it easier by making the focus frame and focus system.
---
The fact that we are running classic on macros 2.0 right now and have no focus or focus frame functions is actually a missing feature that should be there.
---
And we can’t use the old scripts, because again, we are running the macros 2.0 system, which wasn’t a thing until sometime into TBC.
---
The real question is, where’s the #nochanges outcry on this? 
---
If we are going to run the new 2.0 macros system, then at least give us the full functionality..... right?
---
Oh I could see how you could think that from my comment now. What I meant is that if you read that thread, most people are saying that standard practice is to roll Need on BoEs. Yes they are talking about it in the context of ninjalooting, but there are also a lot of people talking about the fact that they always roll need for BoEs because everyone can benefit equally from rolling need which makes sense. I pointed out that thread to show you that it's not really standard etiquette to roll need on an epic/rare BoE only if you need it, it's the opposite.
---
That's a straw man fallacy make me say or do something I didn't do which is whining. I love druid. It's a meme class. But it's the most fun and of course you can still heal tank dps very well. Just not as good as any other class in the game.
---
I was pointing that it's not easy being a druid since which is true. And paying for my own mount felt rewarding. And I give my respect to people who do that too.
---
Yes, and normally time is the independent one, distance travelled being dependent on time and speed - hence the current axis are suboptimal.
---
3 travelers before lvl 60 economy is treating you well this time arround
---
Fuck yea, I could use a can of Schweppes right now!
---
bro.. using sunder while leveling is tha shit! you do more dmg and will have more proccs of overpower.
---
life gut so much better since i started doing this
---
you can also find other warrior guides up here, where they highly recommend it
---
Im willing to gamble on 5 dollars.
---
Will do :D
---
Can combat be viable for PvP?
---
You didn't lose your guild rep unless you joined another guild.
---
This guy Reddits
---
Well, sure it's nice to get the free mount but I don't think you truly appreciate it when you didn't struggle to get it. But it's just my opinion.
---
Yea Nathanos used to be threatening and now he’s the Warcraft equivalent of a college frat guy with an anime waifu body pillow.
---
Hell yea, Seagrams is good shit too!!
---
When you start main tanking raids...maybe. You can do strat/scholo/brd/ubrs/lbrs as arms or fury no problem, just throw on a shield. 
---
There's nothing in MC that I can remember really trucking tanks to the point that a deep prot warrior is necessary but I could be misremembering. I was a healer in vanilla the first time around and nothing in MC really comes to mind as an outright tank killer.
---
we kill ony with a shadow priest tank on a privat server, its possible.
---
Yes kid, it's a multiboxer. Is this the first time you see one? Do you really need to post this crap on reddit?
---
Honestly most of these people are trolling. The amount of times I've seen people ask when you get flying...
---
Wtf is this mindset? You need an item which is an upgrade to you. I run dungeons specifically just to get good gear, not to sell that gear. I'm not gonna buy a 5g glove from AH, I wanna earn that item by playing that dungeon and get it for free. 
---
I'm never rolling need on BoE items that I don't plan to use. If an item is an upgrade, I roll need. If I'm a mage and there's a druid in my party and the Warden Staff drops, I'm not gonna roll need even if I could sell it for 1500g. Plain and simple.
---
Appreciate the pointers! Guess I should get off my ass and make it happen. I typically have used a shift modifier before w/ bartender and it works well.
---
Also auto attack/ss macro is very useful, good stuff!
---
its not "hurting" when someone pushes you off a bridge 4 times and there is nothing you could really do about it?  you waste maybe 30mins of your time. and time is rare as a real grown up with a real life.
---
waste 30mins of my max 2hours gaming a day, does hurt indeed.
---
1x is ok, we all had a laugh. but 4 times = retarded
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking of. If you HoT him while he's in combat, then you enter combat and get threat. But if you HoT him before he enters combat, then sit down to drink from a safe distance, you're not going to cause any aggro and he can do his pull in peace. It is a very helpfull tool to master because it gives the tank more room to to position the group before he need to start generating threat.
---
It took me 100+ tries to get Second Wind. Good times.
---
Thus my username. Always funny when people don't get it
---
Does raising your fishing skill beyond 300 (lures etc.) have any benefit? Are there any fish that can only be caught if you raise your skill above 300?
---
If you use FD then mounting is always faster.
---
IIRC yellow strikes don't generate rage, only white ones do. So... if you just spam special attacks, you'll have no rage.
---
Though personally I don't think running out of rage when you kill a mob is a bad thing. Isn't that the whole point?
---
Why do you think my whole guild left thalnos
---
"It didnt happen to me so its fine". You got the moral comprehension of a 6 year old. Typical for todays society of misraised self centered egoistic brats.
---
And yeah its an ingame item, so the harm done is limited fortunately. But still a 450 gold item represents dozens of hours of grinding effort AND the fact that famous redneck beggar Asmongold approves of such behaviour sends a dangerous message to the kids who watch his content and will transfer this lesson to real life.
---
The fact that this was supposedly staged (i dont buy it) doesnt change one bit.
---
Thanks for looking out! Rough few weeks but getting back in the swing of things. Playing WoW again definitely helps!
---
Had a guildie get it over me on rolls. Then go on to get all the bis trinkets and replace it within a day lol.
---
Git gud
---
Ouch man. Are you buying all of your skills per level or something? Because that will keep you broke pretty easy. Many skills aren't worth buying until you hit max level since you won't use them anyways. (Like on my shaman there isn't a reason for me to buy higher tier revives since they all do the same thing but rez someone with a trivial amount more HP and mana.)
---
Loot everything. Vendor grays. Most white items sell very well on the AH and are worth looking into. If the AH is too close to vendor price you can either wait it out a day or two or just vendor right away. 
---
Elementals tend to be a good source of income because their respective element drops are often in high demand for crafting. 
---
For quests a general rule is weapons sell for more than armor. Especially swords, axes, and maces. (Ranged weps less so.) Plate tends to vendor for more than lower tier armor types. 
---
If you get a BoE check the stats and see if it is worth putting on the AH. If you are horde then plate armor with spirit or int is worthless and just goes to vendor since we don't have pallys. (Argument can be had for disenchanting but might be more time/effort than it is worth if you aren't an enchanter yourself.)
---
Keep up on your professions. If you lack a gathering skill you might want to reconsider that for the time being until you are level 60 and established.
---
Hope some of this helped. If you are on smolderweb I could loan you what you need.
---
Whats the robe u are wearing
---
First glance I thought their arms were crossed and I thought “How TF did I not know about that emote!?”
---
I have no idea how you run oom every mov. Am 42 with restto shaman, you just have to grind efficiently. With a good 2 handed staff with nice dps, you just slap on that windfury with lightning shield, deal a flameshock and attack. That's about it, the windfury does the trick on its own even with full rest gear and talents. Sometimes an earth's hock to interrupt on casters. Got no problems whatsoever.
---
There were only like the 10 most common once in mograin ah
---
Sold one for ~400 just a few days ago. The fact that it was bought off the AH just minutes after I listed it made me guess that this could have been sold for much more. I mean, it's pretty much the only viable end-game weapon for tank druids, so it's pretty much worth a lot.
---
Sweet thank you so much! i'll download it asap!
---
Yeah, when you commit to the HotW/NS spec you kind of have to pick a speciality when it comes to the feral tree, but just like when swapping gear to be efficient with resto, I also have a quest/dps set which keeps me pretty competitive when it comes to DPSing even if I'm still tank built throughout the feral tree. It's been an amazing spec for ultimate utility and then the only difference if you want to PvP is to take a point out of HotW leaving you with 4 in that and place the 1 into natures grasp and then picking up swarm in the resto tree. Either way, its a very versatile spec, where you can still be effective with a simple gear swap.
---
Pally's will always find a place in raids due to blessings. Being able to give everyone Kings + Wis/Might is great. Levelling as ret is the right call though, levelling as a holy paladin usually requires you to have a set of +healing and int gear for whenever you heal. Tanking as prot pally is kinda uncommon in Classic due to the lack of a taunt mechanic, you might run into some issues with it.
---
Hi there, could you tell me where you downloaded your Luna unit frames from?
---
How do I make an ad hominem targeted at no one. Hmm. It was a general statement. Please read again.
---
Stating that no one needs my respect is not true, how do you know? A statement given without proof can be rejected without proof. 
---
And to the people who still want my respect  well they can buy their own mount.
---
It would be difficult to get into a good raid if you didn't have devilsaur. It's like the biggest increase to your DPS for the most minimal investment.
---
40 hours is doable, what the fuck? Thats nothing.
---
Loool wow they actually posted about there layer  hoping  kill
---
There are a couple that require over 300 but I believe a max of 400 is needed to guarantee fish won’t get away. Number is probably wrong though might be lower or higher.
---
Nope. I’m doing the same thing I did on private realms I have no idea how I ended up 4 levels short of last time. 
---
I only train what I need always. Most skills are 1 minus essentials.
---
You generate rage when you hit(white hits only), when you get hit(so contrary to common sense things like dodge or Priest shield are bad for you) and when you block if you have the Defensive stance talent.
---
You just have to wait for a bit at the start of combat to "tag" every mob with sunder.
---
The main thing to note is that if you raid consistently, you will get items. Yeah you may lose a piece via loot council or dkp bid to someone else at some point but thats a one week issue , be there next week, officers of lootmasters remember you losing a piece and as you are almost always there they will gear you appropriately. Not being over greedy yourself or difficult to deal with gets you geared pretty easily, making the effort works. If you are low on the dos meter but getting the bosses right, you are a shoe in to gear up as it is more likely a gear issue etc
---
Hey if you scroll down past the tree during those 10 level jumps it gives you a level to level break down, just so you know.
---
I love druid, I don't feel bad at all. It's great. It's just worse at any role than other classes but not everyone is a min/man hardcore player. And druids will be super fun for BG. Specificaly warsong.
---
what is it?
---
As a hybrid feral (I can bear/cat) I have been going bear most of the time (unsurprisingly) and just got Force of Will. Should I replace Mark of the Chosen or Rune of the Guard Captain? Also I noticed Force of Will isn't listed as BiS for bear druids at all.
---
Mhh Sounds like a good idea. I was kind of unhappy with loosing the 2% krit from the fury tree.
---
What addons are you using?
---
That reminds me of a Gnome rogue i met. First i saw him and had a quick party with him and all i could think was that he was an immature little twat. He is not a good player and probably toxic. a day or so later I see him in chat needing party members for DM. I didn't want to party with him but I wanted the wand you get from cookie, so i party up with him. after a few minutes of spamming LFM he says a high level friend will be taking us through. again i thought 'great, little kid is getting big brother to help'. During the run i find out 'big brother' is actually one of his minions from work and the Gnome rogue is actually brand new to the game and still learning even though his work friend was supposed to show him everything. We also talked a bit over the course of the DM run and got to know each other a bit better.
---
Over the long weekend we grouped up a few more times and now i look forward to seeing when he is online and questing with him.
---
TLDR. WoW Classic is amazing
---
Look and customization.  It did everything.
---
What are your weapons and gear like? I'm a 46 rogue and I've never killed a caster that quick, I can see you got a few crits in a row but geez. Is the orc racial that good?
---
AARP crowd. Made me chuckle.
---
Class color or green/red health bar.  Rage is red!  
---
Warrior obsessed with custom UI here to test if you want
---
You can afford a mount as a warrior?
---
My #1 trick for not pulling aggro as a dps class is having trash dps.
---
Confirmation bias
---
Sunder is pretty much the only reliable skill which is useful while leveling, until around 40, where you get whirlwind and your lvl 40 talent. (Overpower is fine, too, but in best case the mob doesn't dodge at all)
---
HS is shit. It doesn't only cost rage, but prevents rage generation from the next weapon hit too.
---
Then why the fuck is there a need option at all?
---
I'm a resto shaman.  It's like pulling teeth to get water from some mages, and I'm not really sure why.  I'm leveling a mage alt now.  Whenever I see someone who's the appropriate level range, and a mana user other than mage, I give them a couple stacks of water.  Feels good.  More people should do it.
---
Gamon is a trust fund kid / philanthropist
---
King Mosh is insane.  I could farm mc with minimal effort, but king mosh was a pain.  Fear I think was the great pain.
---
It makes it easier to catch the highest level fish (Less likely to get away, shorter time between casting and catching), but I'm not aware of any fish in the game that requires you to use lures at 300.
---
Sharing is super nice. Materials, dungeons chatting etc...But buying your own mount is so cool. So rewarding I wish for everyone to experience that sense of pride. It's nice.
---
I did the same thing yesterday and the guy gave me a few enchants.
---
I hope I find a friend like you on my server. Maybe I should pretend to be new. 🙊
---
Yeah, time will tell they seem like a good group. Not super organised like I seen some but there's 20 or so that are lvl 40+. I'm really interested in this honour thing that comes in phase 2. Sounds like that's when PvP will be interesting
---
How does one find a group for a full Mara run with so many princess groups competing?  Is there a way to get Noxxion + Vyletounge down without a full group?
---
But theres atleast a few posts about this every day, when does it stop being creative?
---
For some reason my car mechanic always refers to me with "Ihr". Makes me feel royal.
---
Where do I go to train first aid past 75 (Horde)?
---
Asked a guard in Orgrimmar where the first aid trainer was and found out that they'll teach me level 80 and up recipes, but won't let me train past 75 first aid (apprentice level?)
---
&gt; I'm always rage starved by end of mob.
---
Yes, that's how leveling a warrior is. There is not much else to say about it. You need ~3 mobs at once on you and a healer backing you to have a very efficient rage build up while questing.
---
No one needs anyone’s respect. It’s not one of our needs as humans. It’s an a priori statement, it doesn’t require proof.
---
It only because of the racial, it makes orcs pretty op in burst melee dmg

Nothing you can do? You have no idea what you’re talking about
---
I quested more, augmented with a full brd quest run and LBRS quest run
---
Thanks for sharing! This guy was also talked into playing by a fellow Marine friend of his who also joined the guild, I'm guessing he didn't tell him much other than to get questie from my knowledge. So it's nice to share the little details that new players usually miss so they have the best possible experience.
---
Its funny how many 20 something year old edge lords I’ve bumped into while playing classic this round.  Is this a thing in the retail community?   I’m coming from a different game with a way more chillax community
---
Sounds like backpedaling to me!
---
Thanks for the explanation. I had no idea there was click to move! Gotta look into that.
---
So let me refer you to the classic druid discord. https://discord.gg/KpxxuNT 
---
This discord has a bunch of recommended builds and is run by all the classic druid greats like taladril and Skarm, if you've read their guides or seen their videos. I think Ebnflow may be an admin as well. They also have recommended BIS lists for every style of play. 
---
I'm not 60 yet and am still unsure of my final spec, but I can share some ideas with you (I'm on mobile atm, so I'll have to reattack later) about my spec. If you're into feral ideas, or tanking, Google "Taladril's druid tanking guide" and he'll tell you everything you need to know about the pure feral tank, hybrid tank/cat dps, and pure cat dps builds.  My general thoughts are that if you like tanking you should do a fairly pure feral build like you mentioned. If you want to be truly flexible without respec costs, I'd recommend the 1/29/21 or 0/30/21 with some minor changes in the middle depending on if you'll do more tanking/solo farming or more PvP/healing. If you don't desire to tank, then I'd recommend basically flipping a coin between the 1/29/21 and a 8/12/31, or trying both out and see what you like. And finally, if you just want to kill people in PvP, especially wPvP, then run something like a 29/11/11, realizing that building gear for this spec may be difficult (since no one gives balance druids a chance, rightfully so in PvE). My plan currently is to run a tanking centric 0/30/21 until phase 3, where I'll change to a 8/12/31 and look to only heal in PvE. I'm hoping I'll be able to get some healing pieces by volunteering to tank some end game instances, but that could backfire. If it does, I'll just plan on getting some quest and crafting healing gear to get me started and maybe switch to a full healing build a little earlier, while still keeping melee gear I've aquired for solo farming purposes. Or maybe I'll level an alt lol. We'll see.
---
&gt;It’s sad that this has to be said, but… let the TANK pull. 
---
Nope. Let's say you want a rogue to sap and mage to sheep. You, in that case, can't let the tank pull because rogues while lvling won't have imp. sap. 
---
Pull as a group so everyone is on board.
---
Sorry I don't like gyms. It's hot it smells and people are weird. Exercising outdoor is the most fun I have. And it allows me to spend time outside instead of in my house or in the office. That's just my opinion. Please don't take it personally. Keep enjoying classic wow :)
---
(and the hunter for racism)
---
In the upper 40s be sure to do the hairs captain of raventusk collage quest in the hinterlands. Think I picked it up at 46. Need a group and have to kill 80 elites, but you get a trinket that you probably won’t upgrade for a longggggg time. I’d say it’s a must.
---
Sorry, couldn’t read the whole comment, I stopped at the first sentence. Your mom plays and she rolled a warrior? That’s quite against the odd!
---
I run dungeons for loot, xp and money. And I will gladly pay 5 g from AH to get an item that is worth it. I enjoy being efficient, and getting gold is part of the enjoyment. Why is your experience worth more then mine? And if you win the roll from me that wants to sell the item you are free to give it to the mage. In fact if I want to sell it and the four of you want to give it to the mage then why not roll for it by all needing? If I win then I can sell it, if any of you four win you can give it to the mage if you want to. No one gets tricked, 20 % chance that I get my way, 80 % it goes your way. Why is that not fair?
---
Heh, that might trick somebody! But think about the karma!
---
Health Funnel is how you solo elites while Mages and Shadow Priests question their life choices.

The fastest way would possibly be to start your own group, there are many people who need the Sceptre

Lvling a rogue without even moving to 10 is indeed a challenge :o
---
I /lick them. I’m undead.
---
In leveling dungeons always prioritize leveling gear.
---
If you have a Warrior tank, he is going to roll on nice 2 handers as well, no questions asked. They spend most of their time questing so it's still a priority for them
---
If you have a pally healer, he's going to roll on nice 2 handers as well, exactly the same as above. If you are the healer then also feel free to roll on healer gear as well. 
---
Don't feel bad about being greedy in dungeons as a versatile class, if you're the only healer (which you should be) don't feel bad about taking healer *only* gear that is gonna be sold anyway, but remember you need dps gear as well for leveling. 
---
Where I would say it's taking the piss though is taking cloth robes away from casters for your healing set as you'll only be using this set for dungeons and they'll be using it for everything.
---
Not sure if you can't read, but the title of the post says the raid leader is a rogue.
---
Its not a final decision yet - it isnt even in the game. Think they will make a final call nearer the time
---

---
The amount of health vs the amount of mana we get depends heavily on spec, but even still, 10% of our hp is still only 3-5% of our mana.  Tapping all the way down is just to be sure you’re at full to be able to apply your dots and drain enough before tapping again.
---
I love having VW sac on PVP servers though. So strong.
---
Succubus seduction is good too though.
---
If youre the only one selling price it for more than 700g , its a Druid Tank BiS till phase 6 if i am right.

The economy are stabil and some ppl already got over 10k gold so dont be cheap with it

He's throwing shade because of people's nationality. Same thing that was done to you, unfortunately.
---
Don't forget the "Not-a-bug" entry:
---
"Offhand attacks that occur while on-next-hit abilities such as Heroic Strike are queued do not suffer the dual wield to-hit penalty."
---
So as a late game dual-wielder you'd want to keep up HS as much as possible.
---
You liar!  you are about 20 yards away from your original position in the old pic! 
---
Also in the past 14 years the solar system has moved 63.04 billion miles away from its original position. So the spot in space where the sparks of data representing your character in your computer and blizzards server occurred 14 years ago are astronomically far away. Literally.
---
Okay. Done with my silliness now.

Just to be clear, this will also purchase whatever pattern that is in that slot, and there's a bunch that are not valuable.  So use with caution.

If by big daddy you mean the helmet then yes. not sure what else is similar though? The posture.

Style gear.
---
This inspires me to play my druid alt more than my mage. Druids are so underrated! Who cares about recount dps charts, let me be an animal lol
---
It wasn’t the reason it was bad. The reason it was bad is because he was drunk and pulling too many. You’re fucking thick.
---
Stanford isn’t an Ivy League school.
---
I tested this out with my friend. When he tagged the mob and I burned it down, he would get ~40 xp. When he killed the mob all by himself he got ~230 xp. Keep in mind this was while we were not partied. So no matter what your xp will be gimped. Obviously you will finish quests much quicker however, so it's probably worth the trade-off.
---
Weapons are the #1 upgrade for warriors, any DPS upgrade is going to make leveling so much smoother.
---
If we stand out any more we would get ganked more so im not going to try this hahaha
---
Horde. I think they've since removed those guilds. Havent seen any myself in a couple of weeks now
---
Why am I doing such horrible DPS as a warlock? 
---
I'm a 38 warlock who's been really lucky gear wise. I have some of the best items for my level, and overall I think I'm pretty kitted. Yet in dungeons and parties alike, I'm usually doing less than half the damage most other classes do. 
---
This includes overall damage. I pop my curses on each mob we pull, not just single targets and then I just rotate between shadow bolt and my want. Pretty straight forward rotation but man my dps is horrendous. 
---
Any advice? What am I doing wrong?
---
Does this really work? And can this be done in raids/dung's?
---
&gt;Voidey doesn’t even hold agro at level 25, let alone 40+
---
Yeah if i could do it over again i'd just use imp all the way to succubus. For an aggressive non-multitarget playstyle void is pants. The amount of time you have to baby him to have him "keep" aggro didn't feel worth the ocasional tap/bandage i needed to do to maintain mana/hp levels of just tanking it myself.
---
I could see it being useful for 2 to 3 target consistent multipulls, but i'm personally just not comfortable with that playstyle. Too much can go wrong and waste more time than you gain.
---
Make a macro to post in party chat that's says something like "Just to be clear, we are going to be rolling on all drops and nothing is on reserve, correct?" . If they say no, find another group. If they dont answer after a reasonable amount of time, hit the macro again.  Maybe hit a few times. Wait till you get an answer. If they agree but later in the run try to pull a fast one you can now report them to GM with evidence.
---
You crazy son of a bitch you did it.
---
Yeah, but since the guy didn't even know there was a selfie camera, he didn't have this context. He is just hating for the sake of hating because:
---
retail bad
---
classic good
---
Pretty much same. I had no intentions of playing this really. I forget what exactly made me log on and try classic.
---
The best thing you can do is reroll shaman :D
---
Can't get Dreadsteed until phase 2 (requires Dire Maul), so you might want to save some gold if you want epic mount before that
---
There’s Atlas Classic WoW with dungeon maps and AtlasLootClassic with dungeon loot. Is there any addon that has both in one place? I know it’s just a QoL thing, but it’s annoying to have the map and loot in two different places. Maybe addon authors can work this out?
---
Level 1 Shadow Bolt until 22.
---
I would have uninstalled the game.
---
As a hunter, I agree. Aspect of the Cheetah + Concussive shot means I can kite almost anything. Killed Mor'Ladim (Level 35 Elite) solo at level 28 the other day.
---
Prot shaman
---
&gt; This made me also wonder what 1h specialization actually does as well.
---
It effectively increases the weapon min and max damage by 10%. This means that every skill which depends on the weapon damage deals more damage, too. I don't know if any Prot Pally skill scales with plain weapon damage, tho.
---

wtf he killed a mob I’m gonna reroll now I’ve never seen another class do it
---
Just wait for how satisfying Nef and Cthun will be
---
Wut, but you're not on Classic, you're wearing BFA gear.
---
They honestly shouldn't ban you for it anymore.
---
It's not like any of them use it for anything now. Almost all of the GM activities have been formalized into their overarching CS system.
---
I want to buy one so bad!! (Guild maintank druid). I check AH daily, but havent seen one yet on my server. I would pay around 850g gold-ish, but please dont put it lower than 500g..
---
Theres literally no way of you knowing if you were the first or not
---
Where does it say that it has to work that way? And even if it did why could not the system be improved upon by the players themself? 
---
The soulbound is a pretty good idea. But I still think that it is worse system then what we have. I for example want the Lionheart helm, everything I do will be a piece to the goal of getting it. I would sacrifice a lot of smaller BOE upgrades so that I can get to my end goal. I understand if other people rather want the smaller boe upgrades but I don't, I want the Lionheart helmet. But why not give me my 20% chance for some more gold so I get closer to my helmet and everyone else can get their 20% to do what they enjoy with their game. Why am I the greedy one in this situation? I think they way you propose is greedier, it forces people to equip things when they maybe would have wanted to do something else with the item. It forces people to play the game your way, when I propose that everyone can play it their way.
---
Can't be done sadly, things like GM Island and Emerald Dream have been completely removed from the Classic client, same with old outlands and other things.
---
There was a guy who get banned because he farmed some leather (i dont rememver exactly) and he had friend on other faction who killed any other player trying to farm that spot too. You are basicly monopol doing this.
---
Don't sweat it bro. People are impatient and most people feel too entitled to just say 'hey I don't want to wait any longer, so I'm off'. Don't take it personal. You'll eventually find a party with the right kind of people.
---
Not really able to "miss" the endgame. Dire Maul will have plenty of catch-up gear, guilds will need like 20 Onyxia kills to get through Nef, and if you're already 37 I doubt you'll still be levelling when Zul'Gurub comes out. Gearing is a lot flatter in Classic, some BiS' drop in Molten Core that last until AQ40 or even Naxx. You'll be able to find a raid group for something whenever you hit 60 and get geared.
---
Hard to believe that there wasn’t one guy/dps healing in a whole group since there are so many classes that can heal. Would only be common sense for one of those classes to put down some heals.
---
Wouldn’t it make sense to disable the ability to change the loot method then? At least in some situations.
---
The only way to reach the GM island was messing around with the game files (iirc!), which is an offense to the TOS, and will probably get you banned, tho.
---
But yes, there is no in-game GM interaction anyways anymore. I highly doubt GM island does even exist in the game at this point.
---
How stealthy is stealth for a level 19 rogue? I’m venturing through PVP areas where level 24 gank squads are wondering around. Can they see me at all? Do they see the semi invisible image that I see of my character? What are the limits and parameters of stealth? 
---
Basically I’m trying to make it through Ashenvale without getting ganked.
---
because it's like several orders of magnitude more powerful and featured?
---
It doesn’t matter what talents you choose because you are playing a meme spec. Just put your cloth dress on and start healing and you’ll be fine.
---
Charge on middle mouse button gang
---
Thank you for digging that out, that guy did a phenomenal job of researching it fully and providing evidence.

And yet nothing has been done about it, so far. And the #nochanges purists are trolling him, as he didn’t provide all the evidence and proof of the matter.

---
dont let the try hards get you down.  some people think they are "better at a game" based on how quickly they can aoe farm and ignore the games content.
---
Because when you learn a new rank of conjure water it can take around five minutes to conjure two stacks to trade someone.
---
Conjure Water (2) x5, drink and repeat for five minutes. When you have a limited amount of time and many people want water/food during these times it can be difficult. As soon as you start making 6+ at a time it’s not so bad. But you have to go through that process once every ten levels.
---
Why lie?
---
:(
---
are there any useful quests that can only be completed once you reach lvl 60?
---
Don't feed the troll. He'll die alone most likely. 🤙
---
I am glad for your happiness duder.
---
I dont know why people do such things. My guild ran princess runs for me to get the ring.
---
Effort pays and builds character in the end. Ninja looting gets you ignore and blacklisted... good luck with that.
---
What emote is that? /clap?
---
&gt; when the timer of FD runs out, you die for real.
---
What do they die of?
---
95% of things pre-60 aren't worth selling on the AH though depending on your server. Unless you've got a desirable statted green/blue/twink item or some other item, most stuff is still basically vendor price and you'd end up losing money via the deopsit.
---
Yeah sorry to be that guy, but deep down you know I’m right.
---
Can Orcs resist the stun?
---
No. Loot Master is fine. It's even ok in random groups - you just have to communicate it upfront, before the run starts. 
---
Runs with _Item X Locked_ aren't uncommon, and Loot Master is the only way to make that work. Usually it's switched on for the boss with the locked loot, and switched back afterwards.
---
This is that "immersion" that people talk about.
---
Not a warlock player, but did you ever try it without dotting everything? I could imagine that the damage payoff isn't really the best for trash mobs since they die so fast. Not sure what single target spells the kit offers, but you might be better off with them and giving your tanks an easier time. That being said warlocks usually aren't at the top of damage meters, but half the damage definitely sounds like a lot. I assume you always replaced your spells with the higher ranked ones :D.
---
You ARE blazing trails. One of my group is in a different time zone so we get on average 5 hours of play time together per fortnight. We are now lvl 27/28 and hitting up rfk next a week and a half from now. These are our alts for most of us due to the play time gaps.
---
Fun little friend dates :D

There is a goblin near the road from the village to orgrimmar, that is neutral to alliance

Hey I remember seeing him in IF, Zandalari Tribe right?

Does anyone know of any addons that can remove player frame and enemy frame and replaces them with floating health bars?

Oh wow, throwback to Eric from The Lost Vikings.

Nice one Blizzard! (Not you, Activision, you suck)

Not at my PC at the moment but it was either Curseforge or twitch app.

Hi, /u/Steeryeyes

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dc69o4/meanwhile_at_hillsbrad_farms/). 
---
Yeah, that sounds familiar.  
---
Except that I am  lvl 60 and waiting for my friends to catch up eventhough i didn't exactly rush to 60. They just dont have as much time.
---
I think it will take atleast another week or two until one of them hits endgame.
---
;'C this was a painful experience :C
---
I physically delete my water and food. I didn't play mage to be randos vending machine that wants to tip 10 silver for a full trade of water.
---
Fuck you
---
Ah, the good old [hotkey bug](https://i.imgur.com/LhdJt6Q.jpg)...
---
Strength is way better than intellect. Strength increases shield mitigation.
---
The only problem is if everyone is completely lost inside the dungeon - if one person knows the way I don't see why he or she would not happy to point the way. Having the Group leader thing often means nothing more than that you put the group together.
---
And yes don't sweat it when people leave randomly during group assembly - it often takes a while, and some people have things they realize they got to do or are just impatient and don't bother communicating it. Better they leave before the run than join and just randomly afk or leave there. You could also look at some full Mara run guide to get an idea of what to do and where to go next to bolster your knowledge.
---
You are basically a sanctioned hacker because you pay blizzard 5 subs under the table. Why not just cut out the payment and hack for real? Wouldn't it be more enjoyable for you to just run a trainer?
---
It's only a meme spec if you play with retards.
---
My warrior is 53.  The OP is 100% correct, you don't know what you are talking about
---
Rogue's name checks out, according to the meters.
---
Just bought a Great Horned Owl 😁😁😁
---
This. Exactly what I'm feeling...
---
Everyone knows that.
---
If I get traded 1 lvl 15 Melon Juice and you instantly cancel, I kinda understand.
---
Thank you for this I knew there was something bothering me but I could figure out what
---
For each boss he's assigned between 0 and 120 points based on the highest DPS he has done compared to other druid tank at the time, i.e. if he has had the highest dps of all druids at the time on one boss he gets 120 if he's the worst he gets 0.
---
I think everyone who knows this can agree it's a terrible metric of judging tanks and OP either has an agenda behind this post or is coming from a completely uneducated pov.
---
30 seconds iirc.
---
Not sure what you mean by "what do they die of". They die of FD killing them when the timer runs out.
---
It matters more as a warlock. They have the most spells in the game.
---
Did that today for fun to a 60 hunter. Dude was smart and just swam so close to the boat that it would carry him with the boat basically. I almost shit my pants when he appeared my pvp flagged ass in Ratchet. But thankfully he went his merry way.
---
A very old viral moment that happened in Deeprun Tram. A dwarf player was taking the tram and noticed two naked night elves sitting a corner being naughty. So he pulled out his Dwarven handcannon.
---
I feel like I have ten times as many spells as you and I'm also a warrior.
---
This is a bit long sorry.  First haf gives some leveling methods that might mix it up for you, the lower half explains why aiming for green quests will make everything easier as a warrior.
---
The nature of rage generation means that all warriors will feel clunky while leveling.  These help mitigate it but won't fix it.  Just don't expect to be pressing a button every GCD, pooling/managing rage is part of warrior life
---
**Methods**
---
I think your method is fine, but there are a few more advanced methods that you can try if you want to mix it up.
---
*Hamstring kiting* method has you applying hamstring and getting an auto attack off then kiting for 2.5sec before moving back to the mob for the next auto attack or special.  Use a swing timer add-on to track your swings.
---
The idea is that most mobs will have a much faster weapon speed than you, so if you're only engaged every 3sec then you're doing full damage but they're only doing 50-80% damage or so.  It was easier on p.servers I think, I've found it really annoying in classic.
---
Another option is the *2-1-2-1* pull method (don't know the name, I just made that up) where you maximise the value of your sweeping strikes cool down along with whirlwind.  The idea is that you pull two mobs and cleave them down with SS then pull one mob while it's coming off cool down.  Bandage if needed then repeat.
---
You don't need to try those methods.  They require a lot more attention and concentration than simply charging and smacking so you'll need to see whether it provides you with the leveling experience you want.  They don't meet my expectations as I'm trying to do a little RP in my leveling and I'm leveling to relax mostly, even though it's suboptimal.
---
**Rage generation**
---
As for being rage starved it kinda part of being a warrior while leveling.
---
Rage is generated in two simple ways (aside from talents, charge and bloodrage), those are *dealing white weapon damage* and *taking damage*.
---
During leveling, you're rarely taking enough damage to generate significant amounts of rage and if you were you'd have a tough time anyway.  This isn't the one we want to maximise!
---
Dealing white damage is one we can better influence.  White damage is affected by the weapon damage, hit chance and crit chance.
---
You want to use a slow 2h weapon because most of your specials deal weapon damage plus x so high weapon damage is useful for non-rage reasons, but the more DPS the weapon does the more rage you'll generate over an encounter. Keeping your weapons up to date while leveling will make your rage gen problems easier.
---
Crits deal extra rage so we could look to crit chance to gain more rage or talents that boost it.  Over the next 5 levels you'll be gaining 5% crit from talents which will help, but aside from that at 40 it's mostly just good to know when selecting gear.  Agi gives us crit and dodge so is a pretty decent stat for warriors, even if it only gives 1 point of AP Vs the 2 we gain per point of strength.
---
Hit chance is a big one.  If you miss you generate no rage.  If you glance you generate less rage.  If you're dodged or parried you generate no rage.  Hit rating can reduce the chance to miss or be avoided and ends up being our top stat for both damage and rage gen until capped.
---
You won't see hit rating on leveling gear though so we have to manufacture it ourselves by simply choosing to engage mobs a few levels below us.
---
At 40, if you look for quests around lvl 37/38 you'll be nearly hit capped for those mobs and should hit with most melees and specials.
---
More than that, the chunky nature of arms DPS means that you can get lucky and kill a few green mobs in a couple of hits without taking any damage in return.  
---
Finally, since the mobs die quicker you can use charge on cool down as an engage which pumps a lot of extra rage through if you can find a good rhythm.
---
Thank you for sharing this with us. I wager you probably didn't know how it would be received, but it means a lot to me when people share personal experiences, even in gaming environments. I still have a 7+ year old video on my youtube of a person I used to play with who took his life that I didn't take down because it is possibly the last record of his voice enjoying anything in this world. I think it's great to save anything memorable of loved ones and friends and to share our experiences. I think it helps.
---
Well you are a mage so you will get some money as tips for making water and what not, obviously not tons. If you're horde you can go to Desolace on the bottom left coast and do a quest called Fish in a Bucket which you may have heard of. It's an infinityl repeatable quest where you just have to swim around in the water around the dock and loot cages for shellfish. You can trade in 5 shellfish for 55 silver to the quest giver and also stack up as much as you want and turn it in a bunch. Made like 10-12g/hr doing this as an under leveled shaman, plus you can loot the Big Iron Fishing pole from the cages which will sell anywhere from 1-3g
---
No, it's just that he's being compared to other druids.
---
I killed him over 8k times over 15 years on retail and never got it to drop. I am convinced it doesnt exist lol
---
He didn’t even faerie fire you lol
---
Epic mount still costs $$
---
You can save over 75g by skipping unnecessary spells.
---
I'd value uptime over shield block value here a bit more. I mean, we are talking of at maximim Scholo, Strat and LBRS.
---
I was bitching about this back in the barrens on my warrior. Why the fuck can a lion parry. What is he parrying with, his face? Or a fucking plainstrider. Just parrying my huge axe with his neck or what?
---
This is totally irrelevant here. Its number one across all raid groups. He is not number one of sruid tank. He is number one of all tanks
---
Ya I already have Divine Int. 
---
I was wavering between STR and Imp. SoR. Looks like Imp. SoR is the way to go. Thanks!
---
Some people ~~just have a crazy imagination fetish.~~
---
You know... Youre actually right.
---
Thanks. I meant lore wise, or game rules... As far as I understand it, it's just faking being dead, lying down, I was just wondering how it's explained that it can kill you
---
&gt;"[[Your character wouldn't possibly talk to mine so casually, so you're either trolling or terrible at this. Blacklisted, reported and ignored.]]" 
---
Isn't the fundamental rule of rp and improv not to shut someone down? That's the worst kind of rp player, "you are below me so you should address me as such" don't tell me how to rp MY character.
---
Pocket healer is slower than pocket dps.  If it's a healer stuff takes too long to kill.  Bring a mage and they can go to town on your target, they can drink while you fight, they can make you food to eat.  
---
Bring a mage if you want to get shit done
---
LFG Gnomeregan
---
Bought mine for 250 last week, currently see them go for 300-400 on the AH.
---
Shazzrah Alliance.
---
Will this take him out of travel form tho? It cancels the form, so by the time you get to the cast you are always in human form, so it'll cast travel form again.
---
I would have helped with my hunter, but I'm grob mob so can't do much for ya.
---
I've tried this several times but no player has been slow enough to not react.
---
Maybe that's also because, even in a vacuum, a Selfie Camera in a video game sounds farfetched.
---
For instance, in LOZ: Windwaker it was just called a 'camera'.
---
Maybe you should calm down a bit.
---
I try this everytime i logoff. Only one time has someone accepted.
---
waaaaaaa
---
Good around 40, but you should be replacing it with better pieces along the way. BRD at latest should have nice upgrades.
---
You literally have no brain whatsoever dude. HE'S PULLING BIG PACKS, NOT LETTING THE HEALER GET MANA, WITH THOSE THINGS IN MIND, YOU SHOULD PRBLY HAVE A SHIELD SO YOU CAN AT LEAST LIVE A LITTLE LONGER. God, stop fucking talking to me idiot.
---
Easily accessible wands out dps shadow bolt until you start getting lots of +SP
---
So if Demo is a flat 43 and Battle is 55 per ally, as it always applies to at least you, even with no allies nearby Battle Shout is gonna be more threat than Demo?

Yea as a decent shadow priest w/spirit tap I poop my dude right in the middle of your farm and start going to town one enemy at a time... and usually... I keep up and last longer then the 25 minutes the mage spends there and gets bored.  It’s weird that mages are the majority of the ones ninja looting and asking for handouts/being greedy.
---
Things like this make me so nostalgic, and I didn't even play in vanilla. Can you imagine if you could experience the first time you played this game all over again?
---
What realm are you guys on?
---
I should have clarified...best realistically obtainable mount. My bad.
---
At 100+ now. Seen orc maybe 5 times. No hoj.
---
you dont get full rep doing grey quests unfortunately in classic. the only "efficent" way to do it is cloth turn ins
---
I took a video when I was dw'ing (full weapon skills) for a while where I started at full hp, charged a mob 1 level lower than me, and proceeded to miss/dodge/parry until I died. I didn't even get it below half. It was the most insanely unlucky streak of swings I've ever had in WoW.
---
Level an alt with skinning and another gathering profession. Sell the stuff you get and send the gold to your main.
---
Thank you.
---
It's not like you have anything better to use for a very long time.
---
&gt;tfw missing out on all the hot erp
---
i should have rolled alliance
---
True.
---
Aww : /
---
Not going to lie that’s pretty funny. I wouldn’t even be mad I woulda said just told him you don’t want the chest so there was no need for all the shady ness
---
What is the? A UI for ants!?!
---
I have some non-combat things keyed to 6,7,8,9 but anything I might use in a fight are usually 1-5 and 1-3 with modifiers.

Looks like crystal cave on dantooine.

Horde only item so we may never know

Stabbbb Wouuuuunnnnnnnd !  
---
\+props to his name
---
ESO was great until they did they scaled all the zones to your level and made the "you're max level but surprise you're not actually max level" thing.
---
What about r,t,f,g, etc? They are so accessible. Also, you just have to practice with A and D. It sucks for a little while but you will build the muscle memory quickly and then it's worth it.
---
Sounds like a big difference. Look up what the item can disenchant into, look up price for all possible mats and find out (if possible) the odds of retrieving any one of them. Also, look up what the enchanting mats are used for - if it's only crappy enchants (or the easiest way to level Ench from level X-Y), I don't see why anyone would pay 6g+possible fee for it. This is where you need to be a bit skeptical.
---
Despite multiple scans, it might also mean that only one or a few people are attempting to sell (not selling!) the item for that price. I can put up Wolf meat on AH for 1g each for a week, then advertise them in /trade as "cheaper than AH, only 20s each" - doesn't mean they're worth anywhere near that.
---
If that guy doesn't have a macro that /yell STABWOUND!!! every time he uses rend I will be extremely dissappointed
---
wow dude thanks for the detailed response. I grinded SM till lvl 40 and got all the blues the entire SM warrior set and WW axe and i was thinking when I hit the green quest zones I would roll face but it wasn't the case. Even farming lvl 35-38 mobs I had to sit to eat on 2 mob pulls. I was wondering if any of my rotation, especially the stance dancing was messing up my rage but I guess the clunkyness feeling was normal. Just feels weird switching to battle stance for charge after every kill for new mob, then switching immediatly back to zerk stance for zerk rage and ww/mortals. I appreciate the response
---
With enchanting, you would be losing out on all money you could get selling the gear
---
I give melon juice to lvl 10 casters, and they always thank me.
---
I wish I had time to play 8-10 hours a day. Also cool, my server is pretty horde dominant and full at peak hours. My experience has been different, crazy I know.
---
Back in vanilla I had charge on middle mouse. All I'm saying is one isn't that "crazy".
---
I prefer to just mouse up to the top right corner and click on whatever I need to cast
---
Leatherworking makes mail too, post-40. But all the leatherworking gear you could possibly need is BoE, you don't have to be a leatherworker to equip any of it. If that's how you want to make money then fine, but don't think you'll be at a disadvantage in raiding if you don't.
---
Depends on what your goal is at 60. If you want to heal, then herbalism and alchemy are good choices because healers have a hard time making money through farming and alchemy is one of the easiest and best moneymaking professions once you get your hands on a rare recipe at 60, and herbalism pairs well with it and can be done easily as a healer.
---
If you want to do a lot of pvp, then engineering is really good. Lots of gadgets and the only profession with a large amount of stuff you cant just buy from someone else.
---
Zandalar Tribe in EU feels balanced. I think it was 55 ally 45 horde last time census was working.
---
I didnt mean you oom after every mob, that was more in reference to trying to heal dungeons... Sure your fine if everyone does there job but often an add or extra pull can oom you pretty easy.. and i know that was my biggest weakness raiding with my resto shaman  in WOTLK was mana.. From what i remember reading when I leveled my last shaman flametounges actually better dps longterm than WF but I gues some of thats prefernce too. I actually like leveling a resto shaman because i can basically chainpull mobs my level while oom non stop because of how many oh shit buttons or ways to save yourself a shaman has .. its just a different play style and not as fast and fun as a mage.
---
Stole a very epic moment from him by giving all that gold tbh
---
Looking into the Details! it appears he did all the work.
---
p.s. its a joke.

Sometimes I feel like Classic was good by excident.
---
Reminds me of Starcraft personally.
---

---
I've spammed jed/rend 3-4 hours an evening and 8 hours weekends and I don't even have Reed yet.  Getting just ONE of these swords is worse, because it's the same run duration, a far lower drop chance, and an equal or greater number of opposing rolls.
---
There are only two ways you could not know what they're on about:
---
1. You didn't do the grind
---
2. You got insanely lucky
---
It is absolute cancer, no better way to describe it.  And if you do it for a while, you'll see it's the same sad sons of bitches every evening, shambling into UBRS like a pack of fucking withered lined up to get their zero loot.
---
Thank you i needed this
---
You are the first one I ever see use the word.
---
my point is its disingenuous to call it "this late in the game". when the majority of the playerbase is level 20-50 its not to late to start
---
While killing a quest mob? You bet. Why wouldnt you? The only reason not to would be to intentionally ruin someone else's day
---
or like a cave in the Un’goro area
---
I just soloed princess at 53 on my hunter got my ring first try was awesome!
---
It isn't a large amount of mp5. You can't even reasonably calculate it in terms of mp5. You have a chance to receive mana back **when you spend mana**. Meaning literally any second you aren't casting that spell (to completion, and spending mana) you are not benefiting from this "insane" mp5.
---
Moving for a mechanic? Cutting a cast short not to overheal? Spending a GCD on another heal, totem, etc? Out of mana? No immediate healing needed? You are receiving exactly 0 mp5 from the set bonus. You can receive a **finite** amount of mana from it per encounter based on your own mana pool and how much you *spend*
---
It's ok, I can tell you failed elementary school math by the fact that you haven't actually done any yet and just keep repeating the same "no really, it's so good" nonsense without actually providing any reasoning. You're only serving to make yourself look foolish in the way you're unable to back up any of your claims.
---
I'm no lore expert, but I would assume that the hunter stops breathing and slows heart rate nearly to a complete stop to appear as dead as possible. Not breathing and having minimal heart activity can kill you for sure
---
How it worked for me on multiple occasions in classic. Bought quite a few recipes without closing and reopening vendor.
---
I dig the fable reference
---
He was stating that the attempts had 14 years between them...
---
Till you pull an extra mob around your level which is a death sentence without health pots, if you have another account feeding you health potions etc you die far less often but let's not pretend you haven't died a bunch to a few mobs where other classes wouldn't.
---
x2 respect to him after reading his name :)
---
I bet you're the kind of person who puts tomatoes in the fruit bowl.
---
Yet I’m level 48. hOW Do pEoPle have full tier !!!?
---
Already doing that. Thanks though. Can't even move briarthorn at the ah for much over vendor. At least I couldn't last week. Slow grind I guess.
---
Try "full immersion mode" and click your spells right out of the spellbook.
---
Everyone says have to reopen but I have had multiple recipes stock instantly while I had the vendor open so idk.
---
in classic i get more social interaction than in real life
---
You genuinely do not.
---
All chests are shared and must me rolled for. The rogue is just the one to open it.
---
Also if I'm not mistaken being behind someone makes the detection radius much lower.
---
When considering art such as this, one must not be so judgemental
---
Yeah, I have a screenshot of these two outside AH that I sent to my Dnd group (one of our PC's is named Fortis).
---
Dire maul has the good bag droprate
---
But if everyone in your group understands that each person will roll need instead of greed on expensive BOEs, it's the exact same result as rolling greed without the possibility of someone ninjaing.
---
They are all under your level and you're still proud ?
---
So just like every hunter's shot?
---
Didn't you see the statistics? There are servers with 9:1 ratio, too.
---
CoA is only good if it finishes and in dungeons on trash it usually doesn’t. If your mana can allow just spread Corruption and spam shadowbolt (including nightfall, but don’t cancel a cast for it). Also but shadoweave gear even though it looks meh it’s actually great
---
fOr ThE hOrDe
---
I'd say that's a quite decent spot. If you ride by the goblin camp in central STV (near the Ogg'-something elite ogre area) you should always kill the few goblin Shredders patrolling the area, as they have a chance of dropping Fused Wiring. Those are needed for some popular Engineer recipes, and drop from very few mobs outside of specific ones in Gnomeregan, which most players hate. Depending on supply/demand, you might squeeze out several golds each. Managed to get 2-3 myself while killing/skinning shadowmaw Panthers and tigers nearby.
---
First thing I do when I log on is who 60 mages in og for a trades window worth of water for 1g
---
Should be easy to prove then. 
---
&gt;Bought quite a few recipes without closing and reopening vendor
---
Yes, you are infact able to buy recipes from vendors. No, vendors do not restock without you refreshing, that's not how vendors work. 
---
&gt;How it worked for me on multiple occasions in classic. 
---
Ah I see, you're the only one! Sounds reasonable
---
Same, but with most of the letter keys I mentioned earlier. I play rogue and it's not a complex rotation but there are a lot of abilities to bind. I don't want to click for anything besides professions or poisons.
---
Ok without sarcasm then : I don't think you're missing out on anything using questie. I don't even what you could be missing out ? If you enjoy running around on a map looking for mobs you aren't even sure and dead or not, following poorly written directions, then you would'nt have downloaded questie in the 1st place ?
---
&gt;No. Loot Master is fine. It's even ok in random groups - you just have to communicate it upfront, before the run starts.
---
Well, they could, if they wanted to REALLY fix it... just make it so that you couldnt change loot method inside a instance. Its not like they havent done changes in looting. Cant ninja the MC domo chest anymore, its masterlooted now.
---
Because you could not reach that chest on your own. You did it with a party, the fact that the party has an rogue in it means the party has an extra chest to roll for.
---
Mid-40s and there hasn’t been a quest elite I couldn’t solo as a spriest.
---

I just don't have the time for it /sigh

Im 55 with 6days played, Im just overall slow because I can play 2-3hr per day.
---
If you spec right you should have effectively zero downtime as warlock while not using vw. Using dots+life drain with fel domination talent, then using lifetap/dark pact spam for mana, you should have high resources while being able to use other summon
---
Wat?
---
Am I the only one who hates this cave? I don't really have a reason for it.
---
I'm not American.
---
Try not having pink hair and glowing with magical energy.
---
Cool story, doesn't matter what happened back then. You will get warned/banned if you do it on classic. It is an exploit.
---
If you know this much, you should know that private servers utilize a stronger vw with a much stickier torment
---
Also, being hit gives you rage, and rage allows you to do stuff that can save your group.
---
Holy Crap that's better then the One ring.
---
I second this - it's a great server! RP-PvP servers always have a history of remaining balanced, and don't tend to end up too much in favour of one faction or another. Just ensure to respect the RP culture.
---
Just wait until you get into Blackrock Mountains. Some sweet chains over lava there. :)
---
Not if you understand how to manage your Mana with drain life.
---
Hope ur hangin in there bud
---
Well now we know how you got the job
---
Except then you'd have to have everyone hike out of the instance, swap loot, hike back in for boss, then hike back out to reset loot, then hike all the way to continue the dungeon. Being able to swap loot rules in the middle of a dungeon isn't inherently a bad thing, it's just dickheads that abuse it that are.
---
I appreciate your civility, friend. It's the only good thing about you Horde-types.
---
For the Alliance!!

Just don't feel like having a text based argument.

I got hacked the same way, feelsbadman :(
---
ok, I will try this out. Thanks!
---
I was going to type out a whole section about how it didn't matter, based on Seal of Fury / Judgement of Fury ... but uh, are they even in the game, or have they been replaced with Rigtheous Fury on 1.12? (on Horde, so haven't played a paladin in classic yet).

Here's my personal hotw spec:  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxrrscMdxVxsoxo
---
I'd say the second tier of talents is entirely up to you. If tanking mostly, then you could take points out of bash and spread them out. Also, if you don't plan on doing much tanking at all, you could take the points out of primal fury and put them wherever you want. If you do more pvp than anything, put more points into feral instinct up to a Max of 4 over thick hide. Notably feral instinct is for the stealth benefits and from my understanding, every 2 points makes you a stealth level higher (if you're 49 and have 2 points there, mobs and players will detect you as if you're lvl 50) but there are no stealth benefits from a half level (as in 3 points is the same as 2 points as far as stealth is concerned). I could be wrong, so if someone reading knows better, please correct me. Otherwise, I think pretty much everyone takes the other talents I've selected.

Do you want the macros I use as well? I play with a MMO mouse and have it set up so I can do almost all of my play with just the buttons on my mouse and a modifier or two. I think macros really make a druid shine. For example, you can make it so you can't accidentally cast shapeshift twice and burn half your Mana due to lag. Or you can combine most of your abilities into just a few buttons and keep your action bars clean. Or you can have a macro that pops all of your movement speed cooldowns at the same time so you can run significantly faster than an epic mount in just regular cat form. I'm not a genius with macros, but I've certainly made playing easier for myself.
---
Why does everyone hit 60 in WS? I always do that in epl.
---
Boooo.. go away
---
I think it's fair since it's prebis for fury
---
What’s all the hype behind the ring? The black stone ring?
---
That transform trinket is only for horde?
---
The way I saw it with him literally have like 13g at 31 that'd he not be able to get his mount 'till like 45. Yes it is great for the player to push and push for that gold to get their mount and finally once it all is paid off they get to ride their mount. I gave him the luxury of having it immediately once he hits 40 in hopes that he wouldn't become demoralized by having no where near enough gold to afford it. I gave him the ability to literally be able to go learn and level gathering professions that he did not have prior. Now he's making a steady flow of money and is close to paying me back and he'll be able to experience an even more epic moment of getting his epic mount. Anyways what was done was done, maybe I robbed him of that moment I guess but he seems to not care. Now he's taking the stuff I taught him and using it to work towards his epic mount, he seemed very appreciative of this whole thing. Anyways, thanks for reading.

For a PvP server you have missed the wave of people solely interested in leveling. Now there are 60’s, people ganking for fun, and raids on smaller towns. Pvp servers are in full swing. It may not be late to start, but he definitely missed the wave. If you think restarting and getting ganked is a good time, go for it. I personally do not care for PvP servers, and I think anyone who would want to play on a PvP server has missed the easiest time to level on one. Again, unless you enjoy getting ganked and 0 of the “fun” of ganking, I don’t see the point.
---
You could say "______ is fine as long as you play correctly" for practically every class. Playing properly is going to boost your efficiency no matter what your character is. At the end of the day everything is relative. A person who specs, gears and farms properly will still level faster on almost anything else than they will a warrior.
---
Can solo the first couple of bits, yea you need a guildie to help you out but it doesnt take long. Yes you can also buy certain parts off the AH. I got all my burning charms for 90silver super cheap
---
in the same boat, but i'll go exclusively for pvp, cant commit myself back to hardcore raiding
---
Protip: you can catch the boat without being on board. Swim up to the side and jump until your head bumps up against the bottom. Try not to move too much once you're snuggled up. If the boat starts moving and drags you with it you're good, you'll transition along with the boat as if you're on top.
---
Did the same thing, was leveling cooking had a bunch of +stam food i didn't need, found the first warrior leveling, gave it to him, he was very grateful!
---
You got different amounts is "trefferpunkte". Where are #nochanges?
---
&gt; Except then you'd have to have everyone hike out of the instance
---
I dont see people doing that. And at least it would make the assholes waste few minutes (on some instance quite a bit), while you leave the group anyways. But now that i think of it, you might be able to do the instance reset thing with another account and change the looting at the same way.
---
Guessing its best option just to leave the party as usual.
---
Love how your skills are setup in first screenshot vs now.
---
I like Imp SoR for making JoR hit harder. That is your opening threat move. Ditto for why investing in +spelldamage is helpful. You want to prioritize threat generation. As a paladin, bring a lot of water, and drink frequently, not always to completion. You don't need the +Int. The +Str helps more with threat. It also helps a bit with mitigation, but that's just a secondary benefit.
---
And Fish Oil too, for Water Walking!
---
Your way incentiveses people to go for the smaller upgrades and in that way forcing them to play it the way you want it. If a Shadowfang drops it makes sense for all melee classes that can use it to need on it because they it will be an upgrade. Reducing a very valuable weapon to something that will be replaced in a few levels. Sure if everyone is rational and see the value of the weapon and all greed then it is fine, but then you could have all needed also and had the same outcome. 
---
With BOP it is something else and you know that too. Any warrior would pay more then 1.5g for the the Ravager so it is clearly more valuable for a warrior then it is for a rogue. I will gladly help people to get gear they want/need. It is not like I am an asshole needing on bop items that is not an upgrade. 
---
And the Lionheart doesn't cost 200g, it cost 200g for the crafting fee alone. Paying for the helm will probably be around 1500g and will require a lot of grinding. I can grind that money in dungeons as a tank and help a lot of people get their bop items but then I expect to have 20 % of valuable boe items so I can work to my goal or I can grind some other way that doesn't help anyone but myself.
---
They are shithawks.
---
Wow, despite this is a small sample, the amount of new players actually amazes me, thanks for asking around. As I said, I have no issue whatsoever with new players. They have interest in the game, they want to learn and I can easily accept their mistakes and talk with them about it.    
---
But new players are not the ones who will be sending you back to retail, after screwing up themselves :)
---
Guys I just don’t know where to go. I’m a PvP Elf Rogue, level 20, I’ve done pretty much every level appropriate (within 2 levels) quest in Darkshore, Westfall, Redridge, and some in Ashenvale (I get ganked and killed by mobs there). Every now and then a new quest will pop up in one of those areas but I’d like to explore the map more, find a new area with level 18-21 quests, and just generally have an idea of where I should and could be headed. I’m tired of running around to do one meager quest and then traveling back to another place I’ve already grinded to do another. 
---
Is there a map that shows a level progression route that I can follow? 
---
I’d like to do PVP but right now my character is a whimp and gets destroyed by mobs of horde players waiting around for me. So I want to grind up in an alliance area and then go back for some pvp. 
---
First time playing btw.
---
Whats that about? Group loot does not apply to chests
---
Bloody hell back in the day when I played D2 there was none of this online stuff (or I didn’t know about it or have it), but I’m talking about back in 1999/2000.
---
It's the Ironforge guard's helm.

Do get discouraged if you find a bad team. There are lots of people who thinks that they know everything and will try to tell you how bad you are ect. Just ignore them. We need more tanks. Thanking is not easy in classic ( not hard when you get a bit of experience )
---
Be honest with your team. Let them know that you new to tanking class. Don't be afraid to say that you don't know where to go. This is classic. People will help you. On the other side learn your dungeon. Watch a video on YouTube. Open a map on your cellphone. Help yourself as much as possible.
---
2
---
Try to read few guides and watch few on YouTube again. Learn from people that doing this longer than you but don't follow them blind folded. Learn your play style. If you think that something you do is not good for you change it. 
---
Make sure you set up your add-ons like for example cast bar so you know what mobs doing, what spell they cast.
---
Learn to write simple macros. Again YouTube or Google. You need to change your stances a lot so macros are very useful. I never done them before because I thought that macros are hard. No my friend. Very easy and you can learn macros in 10 min.
---
3
---
Now is time for rotation. This is how I do it.
---
When you attack a pack of mob concentrate on one with your sunder armour and other single target skills. Use shouts for the rest of the pack. If someone pull a mob from that pack taunt him. When you build your rage high enough you can poke other mobs in pack with your single target skills. Most of time you won't have a rage for that.
---
Use marks on mobs like skull for mobs you want to kill first. 
---
There are people who are don't care about marks and they will attack whoever they want. That's happening a lot. Don't worry just carry on. You can tell them once to stop but don't waste your breath for someone who doesn't want to listen.
---
In general warlock can generate lots of threat or you can have a hunter with a pet that's taunt everything around.
---
For single target or boss spam single target skills as much as you can.
---
Be positive. Tanks are fun to play. Good team will appreciate good tanks. Nothing better than someone says " good tank " at the end of your dungeon run. Very satisfied.
---
Hope you will have great fun.
---
Fellow Orc tank lvl 44 that never played tank class before. 😀
---
Sorry for any misspellings. English is not my first language
---
I remember when rogues could 1v1 anyone but warriors without issue. I mained lock when that was the meta and a naked rogue with a level 1 gray dagger could perma stun lock us and take no damage while we had no recourse. Seemed kinda bullshit.
---
Did the same to a rogue, straight up asked me if he could borrow 2g to get his mount. I said yeah sure, gave it to him, he ran off and bought it, kept saying thank you over and over. Day later or so he mailed 2g to me with a note similar to that. We've been friends since and he recently congratulated me on hitting level 60 :D
---
Yeah, pairing a warlock with a feral druid is perfect.  They can pop out and heal easily since they don't use their Mana for anything else.
---
Idk, my party member did it to all of us. He traded something to all of us, and we all clicked it.
---
Nope.
---
yibbida yibbida nice one mate
---
Time to make new memories!
---
&gt;Horde only S-tier utility item
---
no horde bias in classic btw :)
---
I like how you think.
---
Unfortunately the truth is that higher levels earn more gold. At higher levels, simply collecting grey items or cloth will earn you gold faster than anything a lower level can accomplish.
---
their reason to stack agi is because in early levels agility has greater scaling.  
---
str remains 2ap from start to end while in early levels 1agi gives you &gt; 0.05crit. 20agi at 60 gives 1crit. at lvl 20 its a lot more.
---
if you run an arms spec, which is slower leveling anyways, you want higher crit chance to constantly keep deep wounds up.  
---
on the other hand, str will make your deep wounds deal more damage.  
---
you'd have to sim it or do some fancy math to find out where the break even point lies, but saying that agi &gt; str by default is nonsense.
---
if you are fury then str holds way more value than agi. as your main damage spell scales better with str.  
---
luckily there are plenty of str/agi items while leveling so you really don't have to choose which is best as you can stack both.
---
&gt;restealth
---
On a warrior?
---
Why he was leaving tho? It didn´t even pop up need/greed window if you open a chest.. lmao
---
Same
---
Think he means the self stun
---
muh moms died gimme karma
---
There's a few quests in the Wetlands you can do, but that zone requires a lot of walking.
---
And I do.  If you are a warlock and the priest stops for water the you should as well as a lock.  They don't though.  They walk around with 20 health like it's cool.  It's stupid as a DPS to maintain low health.  It will slow down the group much more when you get plucked by a mob and die now won't it?  
---
So clearly I do.  Does it slow down the group to drink with them?  Not if you are smart about when you drink.   Is taking 15 seconds to drink really going to slow down the group, probably a very small amount.  Drink with priest. 
---
Go ahead and analyze what I just said so that you can let me know how much I don't understand about locks.   You people on Reddit just love to bicker about everything or that hypocritical of me to say that?  
---
Peace out.
---
I don't disagree with you, just to pile on
---
It's a bad metric to judge any role without context. a 30 second fight vs a 2 min fight has drastically different impacts on if burst or sustained DPS comes out higher, which is guild dependent.
---
For tanks it's even worse because it's Threat holding&gt;(slightly)Maximize Mitigation&gt; Damage.
---
wouldnt that be cathy?
---
Read op’s comment fully.
---
Aw man. I made a couple focus macros for my mage for ez re-poly etc and really neat looking action bar and was wondering why they did not work. It took me a while to realize that it was not in the game even though I remember using it! 
---
But yeah, I do miss focus.
---
/me wipes feet on %t
---
I never completed it before either, it was nice that people were willing to trade pages or give you spare pages instead of selling them
---
I am not ignoring the leveling aspect, I agree with you on everything you said concerning the difference between them concerning leveling.
---
At end game in a 1v1 a mage wins, but as the devs have said since WoW's release, the game is not balanced around 1v1. As far as 1.12 both mages and warriors vie for #1 in raid dps and in world pvp whoever has the drop in, a equally geared situation, wins.
---
Geared Warrior dps is better than geared mage dps the further into the phases/content we get.  My original point, the point you are ignoring, is that warriors were one of the most cared for classes by the devs and only received nerfs every patch because they were too good.
---
I am referring to the history of patches from 1.0 to 1.12.
---
Sorry about that...
---
Keep in mind that until you're doing end game dungeons, healing in ret is perfectly fine. Most Paladins aren't going to be questing in Holy.
---
Do not change stances if you have more than 25 rage
---
Oh honey
---
I'm aware of that as well. Was hoping someone was seeing something I wasn't.
---
You're piece of shit, I hope you know that
---
The de avg is broken in Auctioneer doesn’t give remotely real price
---
cant follow me around when i abondon them each time they died
---
In a 5man party, if leader tries to change it to Master Loot, then a box pops up for each group member with accept/deny it's not hard to implement.
---
Are you using a shield? If youre having threat issues, i suggest wielding a 2h or 2 1handers. I often find myself doing top dps as a dw tank in zf. Sure, you might recieve more damage, but it will make life easier for your healer since the mobs are always on you.
---
One thing I came to find out is sometimes there just aren't any good quests. Grinding mobs your level is honestly some good xp. The only lvl 20ish zone you haven't gone to off the top of my head is loch modan, though that is a bit below you.
---
That's Horde only, unfortunately.
---
You maybe have to speak to a different person next to your current trainer. From lvl 150 you will need 3 books to be able to skill up any further. [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13476/balai-lokwein](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13476/balai-lokwein) This vendor has the books, total price I believe is 1g60. And at 225 you can go to Arathi highlands where you can do a quest to learn up to 300. Here you can also learn heavy mageweave and the runecloths.
---
I'm the same! Really don't mind loosing my loot to someone. I just love running dungeons and love the social aspect of it. Always congratulate my party members on winning loot even if they beat me rolling for it. The only people I really can't stand in my groups are the people who get really fucking salty if they don't get the loot they want.
---
Modern problems require fantasy solutions.
---
Hey, whats the UI your are using?
---
I thought I was doing terrible with 67g today when I hit lvl 40.
---
Got a few good drops In SM that I can sell peak hours at the AH and make the rest :)
---
The first aid trainer in orgrimmar should train you up journeyman (up to 150), for expert you need to buy a book from the first aid vendor in brackenwall village (dustwallow marsh) this is also where you buy the mageweave bandage recipe.
---
Yeah it hurts to inspect people and seeing all those hoj and chests equipped :(
---
Western Plaguelands near Andorhal. Uthers Tomb
---
Troll bloods are also very good early on
---
Threat reduction talents are never going to stop you from getting aggro from an untouched mob if you are healing. It will reduce the requirements from a tank to regain aggro but the tank should be picking up adds as soon as possible so your threat lead shouldn't be too large. But that is a fair scenario where it would help slightly.
---
You will never be doing enough dps compared to competent DPS for it to matter.
---
I agree with you that threat reduction can be useful sometimes, I just disagree that they are anywhere near essential.
---
Me am that kind of orc
---
The badlands have some excellent areas for grinding. The Angor fortress, the rock elementals in the north and especially the south mountains, and the non-elite troggs in the south at Agmond's end
---
I believe this is the western plaguelands, the tomb of Uther Lightbringer
---
We have 4 French server i think, 3 PvP and one PvE. I'm not even on the biggest server and there is a LOT of players. Everybody just speak french (with so many enligh words)
---
I mean why else logically would they prefer not to have full health while they are running around.
---
I had a lock with me the other day questing with like no health, tapping constantly which is fine.
---
He dies once.  I say nothing since that's a lock thing.  He dies again and I ask.  "Why don't you just drink?".  He said that it's inefficient.  So I told him that it's also inefficient running to your corpse when drinking for 15 seconds could of prevented that.
---
Interesting perspective he had on playing locks I suppose.
---
I was running back to UC from running SFK with a huge grin on my face as I finally got a Shadowfang which would help me buy a BiS. Go past a priest and he buffs me with Fort (I’m level 50 and he’s lvl 14 and questing). I turn around and trade him a Felsteed Bag (unique 10 slotter from SFK). He thanks me and tries to pay me but I ride away and whisper “just sharing some good luck :)”
---
I get a message from him 5 minutes later asked where to get a wand. He’s clearly new. So I say come to UC and I’ll give you one. I then gave him 2 more 10 slots bags and a green wand his level off the AH.
---
Now I get little updates on his progress and continue to hear of his leveling fun as a priest. Also I get whispered “gratz on level x] whenever he logs in haha. It’s great! Soon he’ll catch up to mage and warrior friends of mine in their level 30s and I’ll be able to introduce them and run them all through SM.
---
OK. You go play like that.
---
Have fun !
---
Fuck me, if I didn't work so much, I would genuinely enjoy this experience once more.
---
1% hit which is difficult to get outside of the raids. It is bis for a lot of pre raid characters before molten core.
---
Ah gotcha.  Definitely sucks when one faction rules over the other.
---
You do share the coins in the chest.
---
I really love this sheet. Could you add a "profits" tab to the lists so its easy to see the potential pofits if buying at the minimum material costs?
---
Also, I'd love it if you added runecloth items and other items that could be crafted above 40 to make money.
---
There is a difference between incidental stats and seeing a piece of gear that is quite clearly more optimized for shamans, druids, or warriors and saying "I need that!" My comment was about incidental stats, but hunters targeting specific items with seemingly good stats even if the payoff for a hunter is significantly less than for a different class.
---
\+hit is a great stat DPS stat for many builds, and prior to raid's there are relatively few quality items with +hit.
---
Goblin rocket helm does the exact same thing.
---
Wait till you get to searing gorge, you can distract people into the slag mines for 85-89% of their life on falling damage.
---
Also, you get your last rank of Conjure Water/Food at level 60 so you're stuck creating two per cast forever...
---
Blessing of salvation and the onyxia quest by themselves are worth more than anything the horde has.
---
Because they removed them from the maps. Their omission was noticed during beta.
---
I've met way more nice people than unfriendly people in game so far.
---
I just started a warrior with my gf and a level 16 mage came over and gave me like 4 stacks of food. Was literally the first time a mage has given me unsolicited food/water. I have a 43 warlock and 42 mage, and on my mage I always randomly hand out food and water if I just happen to think about it while I'm waiting.
---
It's because they got told that good people roll greed in this situation and ninjas roll need, and it became part of their self-image that they were good people because they observed and enforced that rule.
---
They don't want to change because that would mean admitting the rule was always stupid, and by implication perhaps they are too.
---

---
prob a twink rogue?
---
I'm just glad the majority of weird people and role players go Alliance
---
I think it depends. If you're giving 3% crit to seal fate rogues, for instance, it's more valuable than a flat 3% damage increase minus miss/dodge etc.
---
Well...you got portals and stuff so I can see why a mount wouldn't be a priority lol.
---
Thanks for sharing, these are the things that make Classic WoW well Classic WoW! Gz on that Shadowfang too!
---
Significantly cheaper to beg mages
---
New on reddit?
---
That lootrole is pure greed and i would never accept that in my grps. So people have to miss out on items because you want to sell them? No thanks.
---
Hmm, pally is strong at generating threat. Only problem is when you run out of mana. Sounds like you've not run with a good pally tank yet.
---
Thank you for sharing as well. Loss is such a difficult part of life, it doesn't go away it just slowly becomes less prominent. As the years go by it's hard because there are fewer and fewer little things that I can vividly remember about my brother but this virtual place brought back so many memories. Anything that can do that is hugely important, I think. Whether it's a recording or just a bar in a video game.
---
Yup. This was my most successful scam too. My biggest score was an account completely full of hex charms. Which at the time was the currency of the game.

But it really isnt at that level gap priest will get 3-6 xp per mob

As a Healer this is Viable for a warrior with raid gear and a armor Potion.

The Armor Potion is almost like a shield but u cant block.

Nobo has ever said that wow was a hard game.  It's just a grindy game.

GM island and other places such as Old Outlands and the Emerald Dream have been removed completely from the Classic client, the "zones" are still there but nothing is actually there, guessing to save on resources and make the game smaller?
---
A GIANT gnome? No clue. A TEENSY gnome?
---
Welp, you use the world enlarger AND you drink Noggenfogger elixirs until you find the one that makes you shrink. Both stack together to make a teensy gnome.

If anyone helps you kill a mob and reaches x threshold of dmg on the mob then your xp will be gimped if the player who helped you would not get xp for the mob.

Yep. With my bankalt i asked where the transmog guys was and it was glorious. Fuck transmog tho

Im no master at rogue pvp so keep that in mind.
---
If you mean for some random world pvp from time to time then it works, not good but not like you will lose every single fight. For more serious pvp then no, you wanna go for something like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305300125011-3-500253000332121](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305300125011-3-500253000332121)

You miss out on improved sap with this build but you could take some points from elusiveness and 1 point from master of deception or opportunity to put in improved sap. Some also prefer to skip improved backstab and sinister strike for cold blood but that's something you have to figure out yourself what you prefer.
---
Building a your first Lightsaber eh?
---
Oh okay, well i'm pretty sure the EULA for CS:GO doesn't say anything about paying a friend to cut sabotage an enemy teams powercables before a tournament so hey, not "cheating", its just
---
1. Being a dick
---
2. not in the spirit of the game
---
3. makes you look like a bit of a looser TBH
---
But hey, have fun with your multiboxing bullshit, you're not getting in most of the guilds i know :)

It's a great tool for analyzing raid fights to find out what went well/wrong

Do engineering explosives ever miss? Even with a level discrepancy? If so, how is it calculated

They should log

Does HoJ work for druid ??!
---
Maybe it has something to do with the enhancement tree, enhancing your.. weapon.. skill..
---
Not trash at all. Game was not designed with "speed running" in mind. Add ons, opimization, and layer exploits have pushed the leveling experience to an insane standard that isn't reflective of the actual leveling experience.
---
Yes, friend! Deem it as a compliment! It is a achievement!
---
This would be a turn off for me. You get all those spells at once which you have to get familar with? Maybe I'd reroll if I find out but I do have plans.
---
I just went deep affliction to get Dark pact and use Succubus as a mana battery. From there, a few points in Demono for stamina and imp HS, then onwards to grab Shadowburn for the additional hmpf. It’s not the best for dungeons but you can just chain mobs without ever stopping
---
Or he hates trolls.
---
The extra weapon skill you get with axes means you miss less. This is a very valuable stat when fighting raid bosses. If you dont use axes, you need som extra hit% on your gear to make up for it. If you have this gear, you dont need to use axes.
---
Using axes gives you more leeway in choosing your gear since you need less gear with hit% on it.
---
(Hit% gear is the stat that reads: "Increases youe chance to hit with melee weapons by 1%" or something along those lines).
---
Here is an in-depth explanation of hit chance that includes the formulas and considerations for orcs axe-skill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLD12oUwJoE&amp;t=4m20s
---
Undeads could use some rouge though.
---
Should be noted that adequate wep skill+def is suggested for mdps, whereas it is absolutely mandatory for tanks.  If you take frequent crushing blows from the mob and can't hold threat then you can't tank, plain and simple.
---
Are you putting ALL your dots on all targets? What is it exactly that you are doing? When you say you do horrible DPS, what are you comparing that to? What Margin are we talking about?
---
MEAT CANT FORM CLOUDS? YOU NEVER SEE ORC SMASH PUNY HUMAN TO CLOUD!
---
People are atm focusing on green stats like crit, hit, spellpower and esepcially classes like warriors, paladins/shamans and hunters will rather take leather or cloth instead of plate or mail if it gives better stats.
---
I don’t even know. Felt bad though either way.
---
Thanks! I'll try RareAware this weekend.
---
Not for warrior lol
---
It's called Savory Deviate Delight, a cooking recipe of skill level 85. The recipe rarely drops in the Barrens and the fish can be caught around Wailing Caverns.

I didn't think you could transfer from pve to PvP. Its unfair to PvP players who must level under those conditions.
---
Is there any reason behind this change? I may have missed any lore between 2011-2019
---
Maybe he just didn't trust the casters. I've seen some really dumb things, like hunters rolling on rend blades. Sometimes you need to ML just so there can be a fair roll without someone needing for vendor/shard.
---
Then again, maybe not.
---
Oh classic! Just as I remembered it.
---
If only tanks didn't need survivability and it was all about threat...
---
Icy veins also ranks agility just above strength when it comes to survivability btw because it gives you armor and dodge however nobody seems to be taking into account how bad most of the agility gear is for warriors in this game.
---
You can check out all the BiS lists and you'll see how little items with agility are actualy BiS and those that have it rarely have it as the main stat.
---
Damn you are a sad human being.
---
arms is warrior offspec, can’t use mortal strike in raids, waste of debuff slot
---
100% bonus movement speed.
---
^ pretty much exactly that. Rant to other people (guild chat, discord, teamspeak whatever), and at least do it smart so people cannt just screenshot it and fuck yoz with it. OR ... just don't get angry over something that realy doesn't matter. This is basically a private server. Whatever doesn't happen today, will happen some other day. Someone didn't ninjaloot the ZG mounts from you. Calm down....or take your punishment like a fucking men, if you want to talk like one.
---
I had about 120g when I hit 40. Affording my mount at 40 was my goal from day one. Not that hard if you try.
---
No agenda here. I’m just posting a link to something interesting for community discussion.
---
Nice, will check it out!
---
Theoretically, you should use axes.
---
Practically, most players will use whatever they can get hold off. Aiming for specific weapons is a bit of a chore.
---
The life gained from drain life in the earlier rank costs more mana than the hp refunded, only at the higher ranks does the hp almost equals the mana cost, in which case what you're doing is just moving mana to hp then lifetapping to get the mana back , effectively moving you back to square one.
---
Even if you have 5/5 improved Drain L. which is a garbage waste of 5 points , you'd need a tremendous amount of shadow damage to while leveling to offset the cost of using it ( at least 100 shadow damage), which is more than most can afford below lvl 50.
---
There is also the argument about how fel concentration isn't 100% pushback immunity, if you get 1 unlucky pushback your entire drain life was a waste of time and resources, so I'm not sure why you would want to put yourself in that position in the first place.
---
Dont think it works in feral - Its not a weapon you are hitting with ...
---
Yes, apparently
---
No one on my server is fishing water essence so I have been making some decent cash just levitating over water.
---
I am starting to wish I had rolled a shaman.  Fish oil is so much easier to get.
---
Better RP if female dwarf, preferably the one that looks really angry
---
Rex hunt. What a mad man.
---
Someone's been exploiting
---
I feel this in my soul
---
Like I already replied to somebody you can check out the BiS lists for warriors and you'll see strength far outweighing agility on most items.
---
Theory is one thing but itemization in classic is such that it's pretty obvious.
---
My first 60 had 27 days played :D was such an adventure.
---
Dude, im amazed and i love you forever now &lt;3
---
So i try to explain it as best i can with the limited amount of info we get from the book.
---
The magic system in Warcraft, the books included, is kinda vague on purpose, because creating a good and logical magic system is fucking hard. Brandon Sanderson is a king of logical and well crafted magic systems and has done so in like 4 different book serieses and they are always created in a way that the reader can exactly understand the limitations and powers of a user.
---
In Warcraft they opted for this "Energybalance" Law of magics and basically just gave a few examples of how it worked throughout the books.
---
Your effort is highly commendable, but since i dont think they actually hired some theoreticals physicists and high class writers like Sanderson, they just winged it.
---
So mages in Warcraft are basically trained to harness and increase their "Mana", theoretically every sentient being with a few exceptions can learn to do that, but like with muscle mass, everyone is genetically different and some are better or worse.
---
And exactly like the genetic example, some are just better at utilizing energy more efficiently because their "battery" is lower than others, so some mages will just use their brute force and high amount of energy and others use as little as is necessary to accomplish their goal.
---
There are also different kinds of magic like fel, holy, elemental, nature and arcane that all function a bit differently so i now will just talk about arcane magic since that one has this big energybalance law attached to it big time, the others are a bit more wonky.
---
In Tides of Darkness, Khadgar uses his Mana (mental energy for spells) to alter the density, temperature and humidity of the air to create a thunder storm. Then he just "attracts" the lighting and becomes the lighting rod and aims it at the approaching horde army. After just two lighting strikes he is already keeling over from exhaustion, looks pale, sweaty and "older" to onlookers. And he didnt even "create" lighting, he just changed some small variables in the air to create a storm and then just directed the natural lighting.
---
He is only using small spells like "mystic bolt" which is basiclly just a small air shove like a force push in star wars, because he is so exhausted. The thunderstorm persists though throughout the whole battle.
---
This shows that they must have incredible amounts of energy to be able to affect such a big amount of air to create their own weather, but it also shows that this has to be less energy expenditure than just "creating" lighting from the surrounding static energy or converting the heat around him into static energy and improvised lighting.
---
It also shows that the limitations are kinda there but not directly specified.
---
In another example explained in the Warcraft Chronicles Volume 1, the elven mages of Quel'Thalas use magic to create a runestone barrier around Silvermoon that blocks the tracking of arcane magic of the Burning Legion, so they can use their spells without being seen by them. 
---
They do this by forming and lifting a huge chunk of stone into place, levitating it with their magical prowess.
---
In Tides of Darkness Orgrimm Doomhammer and Gul'dan encounter these Runestones and try to use them against the elves, but notice that they are almost impossible to lift. It is explained that even the Ogres (which about as strong as 5-7 Orcs, where an Orc is about 2-3x as strong as a normal human, so an Orgre should be about as strong as about 12 human men) can hardly lift that runestone with 7 full grown male ogres but grudgingly accomplish it. So 7 ogres converts to 12x7 = 84 men to lift that stone.
---
&gt;The guidelines suggest that the maximum weight men should lift at work is 25kg. This relates to loads held close to the body at around waist height. The recommended maximum weight is reduced to 5kg for loads being held at arms length or above shoulder height. 
---
For simplicities sake lets go with one man can carry 25kg for an hour and the stone was placed on the outskirts of the forest surrounding the city, so lets go with 5h of walking.
---
This means 84 men could carry an object that is 2100kg heavy for an hour. 
---
[Here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Runestone_Falithas?file=Runestone_Falithas.jpg) is a picture of one of these runestones in WoW, the small red speck in the lower right corner in front of the stone is a blood elfe mage, blood elves are a bit shorter than humans so about 170cm. Therefore we can speculate that the runestone is atleast 13x170cm == 2210cm tall, lets say the width of a blood elf is 50cm at the hip, so 8x50cm == 400cm and the depth which you cant see here but i just checked ingame because now im really into it, is the circumference, i suck at math but the circumference of a cirlce was 2*pi*r, so the diameter is 400cm so the radius is always half that therefore: 2*3.14*200 == 2 512cm or 2m and 512cm.
---
* Hight: 2210cm
---
* Circumference:  2512cm
---
* Cone Formula: pi*r^2*h/3
---
* Volume: 92 525 333cm³ (rounded down) == 92 525,333m³
---
An online calculator i found says the density of granite is at 2700kg per cubic metre, so that is 2,7t/m³
---
Now this would mean that that runestone is 2,7*92 525,333 == 249 818,4 tonnes heavy. Thats a shitload of weight if my math isnt awfull wrong or atleast kinda close.
---
So a single elven mage can levitate almost 250k tonnes of stone with his mind over a 5h walking distance and be tired at the end. 
---
So if we remember 84 men can carry an object that is 2100kg heavy for an hour, so they could carry and object that is twice as heavy for half and hour and so on. But this weight would be impossible to lift for men without any kind of help of machinery, pulley system of whatever so im kinda stumped in my calculations here.
---
What i was trying to get, but am now kinda confused by, was that mages have a huge shitload of energy at their fingertips, but they also suffer a lot of consequences from it like bodily frailty, early aging, while they still live a long ass time thanks for magic, and generally being kinda weak. 
---
They can also use the ley lines, which are Azeroths (the World and the Titan soul) literally blood that is running through the planet/bodies "veins" in form of these ley lines. They can tap that to some degree and extend their capabilities.
---
I will stop here because my head is dizzy, point is, its sadly literature magic that wants to resembles physics but in the end is only limited by narration and not physics rules :(
---
This is one of the funniest PvP stories i have read so far.
---
Maybe it's faster if you're soloing, but when the rest of the group is drinking, a warlock should tap to equal hp\mana and drink\eat like the rest of the group.
---
If you're not at 100% mana and health after the group has rested, you're doing something wrong.
---
There's simply no excuse for not resting when everyone else is, same shit applies to Rogues and Warriors, just because you don't need mana and I can heal your health doesn't excuse you from this.
---
TLDR; you're simply a cheapskate expecting others to give you resources if you refuse to eat\drink when everyone else is, and you're slowing down the entire group.
---
Oh brother, don't you remember? The horde is NOTHING.
---
Please update if you find out how to do this.  I am wondering sane thing.

I love you both

We did an all guild UBRS (till beast) yesterday with 60 priest, 60 feral tank, 58 rogue, 58 arms warrior, 56 mage and 56 rogue.
---
Only one wipe at Beast, we stopped there was we were already pushing our limits. Felt good to run it, really brings back memories.
---
So do I.
---
I also got my HoJ from anger and so has other guildies. :)
---
It's my alt, I'm saying plenty of people have enough g to bankroll an alt in all greens
---
I currently use nordic vpn. Do you have any recommendations or should I just stick with nordic?
---
They might remember this from vanilla and run accordingly.
---
Absolute dick move...but funny as fuck, got to be honest^^
---
I personally do not think the racial weights up the  higher value of available swords compared to axes. 
---
And if you really go for that high tier of raiding/pvp where it all matters, you will anyway go arms/zinrokh or better in the end...
---
Unfortunately you can't resist the stuns that knock you on your ass

The real bonus is reduced glancing blow damage reduction. All in all it doesn’t matter much if you get edgemasters.
---
Not ELI5, just light sources are very bright and all appear to have a halo effect around them. More apparent if the environment is dark such as night time or dark back drop due to contrast.
---
AND THE HUNTER FOR RACISM!
---
w8, is there water essences in this patch? Could not find any in Azshara
---
What about two more lines for mount and epic mount with carrot on a stick + mithril spurs + riding enchant on gloves?
---
its a joke because hunter roll on every item in the game.
---
Sadly, because of the way the sheet works a lot of the recipe aren't viable.
---
I use recipes where you buy one item from the AH and the rest are from a vendor. If the recipe uses multiple AH bought items, like cloth, elemental bits and enchanter dust, it makes the calculations way too complicated and subject to huge amounts of change.
---
My way uses items that are effectively a fixed price and change only based on your reputation with the faction you are purchasing from.
---
Another poster has said there are addons which can do this for you based on current market value for your server though.
---
Good Profit? Only for a few specific herbs, leathers and ores/gems. But you'll make more than out of crafting.
---
Lorewise kodos were always domesticated. In War 3 Kodos were a Orc race unit while Thunder Lizards were neutral Jungle mobs to kill.
---
Can't believe people get anal over x and y axis...
---
I am simply going to disagree, plenty of people who are 60 are working on bis gearing and money grinding. There is also no point to world pvp right now (no material benefit). I agree with you once phase 2 hits it will be a bloodbath as people are trying to rank but right now I have been ganked by a 60 exactly once. Plenty of 1v1 2v1 1v2s of roughtly my level but no one on my server really seems to want to gank low levels right now. And there are still plenty of out of the way locations to quest/grind. As long as you are not following the more popular leveling guides you will be just fine. 
---
And again less then .1% of most servers are level 60 right now. That is far from the norm to expect 60s to go arround ganking.
---
The friends you made along the way?
---
They should of kept flying mounts only in outlands and northrend
---
Now I know what I'm doing when I hit level 20
---
I feel kinda bad i got the ring at 45 lol
---
Sounds like an awesome uncontested farm
---
totally fine tbh.
---
It's okay man, you can give up at this point.
---
Just accept that agility is also really useful for warriors
---
Not sure if these are all how they are commonly used.
---
Not sure what else there is but the berserker buff from battlegrounds stacks with the firewater. Did that all the time with my gnome warrior in vanilla.
---
Imagine if you could post conjured water on the auction house
---
And with a deceptive AFK flag.
---
Same. It's literally never come up that this could be a possibility. Need=going to wear, greed=going to sell. Maybe we're just lucky not to play with greedy douche nozzles?
---
It's not your job to heal him anyway really, generally if a dps dies it's their own fault.
---
Uptime shouldn't be a problem. You put talents into cheaper seals and judgements anyways, and you have blessing of wisdom or seal of wisdom if you're wanting to spend a bit more mana.
---
If those tools aren't enough to keep mana up then 5 talent points into strength are not the problem.
---
You consider that an achievement? Strange world we live in. Thankfully he was 10 so he shouldn’t be ashamed.
---
I like grouping for these quests with mages in my tanking gear...I may not contribute much damage but you can safely nuke em from orbit without getting agro.
---
I think it's a bug, the animation gets screwed up but the players see nothing wrong with their characters.
---
That's pretty legit, good on that person. Good thing you asked.
---
Consider making more characters and trying to get them to at least level 10. Try out each of the starting zones and different classes. That way you get to see more of the world of Warcraft that you wouldn't see if you stuck to one character.
---
There are no quests in Darnassus.  You have to go to further in to the starting area.
---
It does
---
Yup, burn those 90s early so you can get those sweet single digit rolls for the real loot.
---
Nice fake man ;) 
---
Or should i rather nice: interesting tabart, shoulders and chestpiece you wear there? Which ones are those? :P
---
I hope so. I can't find a group for anything on Ashkandi at 60. I'm going to give it a few more days and if I can't get into a group for something I'm probably quitting until they add paid transfers.
---
have you done the DM quests in westphal?
---
redridge is a 15-25 zone, there are plenty of easier quests here as long as you take 1/2 mobs at a time and avoid the castle with elite quests
---
some quests in loch modan and westphal are for like 17-20 level range
---
duskwood also has some easy level 20-23 quets like killing spiders and wolves near the river between duskwood and westphal/elwyn
---
if you feel confident you can try the elite quests in loch modan or redrige, the former can be done with like 3 ppl if you know what you are doing, the later requires full party and level 20 may be 2 low
---
My gf is playing on her imac and has the same graphical glitches from time to time. Sometimes even the spell icons in the game client look like pixel-mess
---
Or a ... gnome
---
Wanted to pinpoint that you can sell any gold to an alt and make this low effort meme, but your comment is better.
---
You clearly have not seen the barrens chat
---
Minor correction: CoA ticks every 2 seconds (12 times in 24 seconds)
---
=)
---
You are missing the point they are making.  The point is that if a group is running, say, BRD and have HoJ on reserve, then the ONLY way to guarantee that is to master loot it.  If you prevent the change of loot types in a dungeon, it will be practically impossible to have reserve runs for the reasons that /u/LizzyKitten described.
---
Keep it up mate, i hope i'll find someone like you to travel around. :)
---
Don't forget charge does no damage. So if you're unlucky enough to be at Ravenhill Cemetery trying to kill those God forsaken skeletons that the person on the other side of the map told you to kill and no one wants to party, you can charge in and miss miss Dodge overpower miss only for a rogue to take the tag from you.
---
I have that fucker on my friend list. Or as I like to call it, the blacklist.
---
when he respecs hes probably gonna do more damage than you unless you are also a fury warrior
---
I mean for me its the fact that they play the majority of classes that fuck me up in pvp. Like I won't kill on sight but I don't trust the little buggers.
---
&gt;It was just an example the average raider got 1k-3k Gold
---
Yeh, i dont have a epic mount and i have like 20g. Cleared MC since 2nd reset. So no, people dont have 3k gold saved. They MIGHT have materials bought that EVENTUALLY are worth 1-2k gold.
---
What? So i need to Do the grind now.. Fuck me
---
Probably still will though.
---
What? So i need to do the grind now.. Fuck me
---
Just be glad you don't have to go through life being this greedy.
---
With improved aspect of the cheetah it takes 14 seconds before the mount catches up.
---
What add-on do you use to get your party's nameplates like that? Been trying to find it's name. It'll make healing easier
---
dfefo not faster to fly
---
Here's a cool trick, sweeping strikes seems to copy whatever attack you did.  If you're pulling two mobs, get one down low enough with rage built up, pop sweeping strikes, then execute to hit both mobs hard.  Or for a larger group sweeping strikes with whirlwind for several weapon hits on everyone.  But that'll be dungeons.
---
There is:

I just used it to tame Lupos today. It worked fine.
---
That's not what the implication was.
---
The dopamine hit for every turn in, level, skill point is just a perfect reward system. If WoW was a gambling game I’d be fucked
---
The opening is like COME AT ME BRO!
---
I ran improved voidwalker when leveling, the big sac was nice to deal with gankers and my void walker would hold aggro for at least the first half of an enemies healthbar if I went all out. In hind sight I should have went drain tank with succubus at around 36 but it worked for me, had decent uptime and damage output and the voidwalker wasn't complete shit once I got rank 4 taunt.
---
Much more fun until you hit the raid and have to swtich to frost :(
---
95% of the time I level with my friends, so no probleme with mobs here.
---
If I had to solo level, I would have used frost.
---
I first got alt-f4'd in a game of hunger games minecraft like 10 years ago. Was told that was how I made things spawn in chests, needless to say I lost that game.

---
Yeah people will just tell you what to do to who.
---
45% cause every class has 5% innate stun resist.
---
Well, its a tool to analyze data. But you have to understand what you are looking at for it to mean anything.
---
Myself and a buddy were doing the quest and were a little too under leveled to two man it, like 36 and 38 at the time. There was an alliance there around our level and we did the wait and point thing too, and he helped us! We were so happy, I think I did cheer emote 20 times on him. Then we all start walking back towards hillsbrad together. While we are walking back next to the alliance guy we see another alliance killing some of the mobs in the river and proceed to brutally murder him right in front of our new friend. We then waved goodbye to our new friend and went about our glorious day.
---
Since ive gotten mortal strike i stopped pulling 2 mobs at once, also i usually go to zones where mobs are 1-2-3 levels lower than me, and go one by one with no downtime as i kill them so fast they dont have a chance to cause much damage.
---
My rotation at the 1st mob :charge(i have 1 point in improved charge), bloodrage, mortal strike, berserk stance, berserk rage, mortal strike, if one of those mortals or autoattack crits the mob is already at half HP and i just finish him with auto and mortal. Never use any skills if the mob is one crit or 2 autoattacks from dying so you dont overkill him and use all of your rage , if he is something like 100hp i just rend him and Inttercept next target.
---
Next target, key is to have atleast 15 rage in the end of the 1st fight, you can charge and mortal strike and autoattack, if one of them crits, the mob is already at half HP... Just autoattack and mortal steike, if 1st 2 hits dont crit, sunder armour
---
Keep the battle shout on, keep berserk rage on, never use all your rage, never overkill targets with skills, when soloing i try to stay in battle stance to not get extra damage= less downtime. sharpening stone is your friend, +dmg enchant is your friend
---
I can go like 10 mobs before i have to eat, or if i have 2/3 HP i use bandage to quickly replenish so i dont loose much rage... I started to LOVE my warrior after lvl 40,1st time playing Warrior :D
---
It most certainly does and is their pre-raid bis dps trinket along with Blackhand’s Breadth. HoJ is even more sought after than usual by ferals because many forego Blackhand’s Breadth for Mark of Tyranny when choosing a quest reward, as that is their bis tanking trinket.
---
I agree.  It should be distance over time.
---
If the axis were reversed, this would look more intuitive.
---
If you whisper someone something like this and instantly ignore them, you are stupid and deserve to have had whatever misfortune that made you mad happen.
---
At 40 it gets much easier with mortal strike, it gives more dmg than HS and does not prevent rage generation from autoattacks
---
I love Westfall because it's always harvest season there.
---
Me and my 2 friends are leveling together as well. We are 37-38 and just started questing in STV together. They have more playtime than me so they also have some alts they play when I'm not there. Works great, altough drop quests can be a pain sometimes when you are 3 :P.
---
The phone pic meta has been taken to the next level.
---
I don't understand how people can be 4+ levels past 40 and still not have enough money for a mount. You get several gold per quests at this point.

Yep and yep. Rogues are pretty flexible in PvP, but to some it's worth going further into sub if you're going to really focus on just PvP. Improved stealth can be a game changer, especially against other rogues.

I've only played warrior, but why do misses/dodges/parries and especially having an incredibly difficult time against higher level opponents only seem to be a warrior complaint?  Do the other melee classes gain access to some hit chance buffs or are warrior combat rolls made in a different way to them?

My point is that leveling up is reached by playing the game while getting power by multiboxing is acquired by playing the game.
---
Good advice is, don't level up all your abilities, only the necessary ones. And get gathering professions like skinning and mining / herbalism.
---
How tho.
---
Yea any Horde Hunter rolling on HoJ is an idiot. Saying this as a Hunter player myself.
---
Noticed a guildie camping it for 48 hours, when i called him out he logged off and has not been back online.
---
Wrong choice lol
---
I personally believe everything I read on the internet. 
---
You know all you need to do to fact check some text is highlight it and press Ctrl-W
---
how does improve stealth make a big difference? also what talents would i sacrifice to go extra stealth?
---
This is War, there is nothing else to say.
---
Conveniences ruin the game.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is that a new one?

Should've told him to also delete System32
---
Question for the raiders.
---
Do you intend to sell runs/items?
---
All I really want is Eye of divinity. Happy to pay for it in gold instead of comitting to a raid team.
---
I hardcore raided vanilla as well as doing the pvp grind but those days are well beyond me. The nostalgia is strong though!
---
My alternative to raiding is farming gold at my own pace so theoretically speaking if your guild were to sell eyes of divinity/hunter leaf what would you price them at? 
---
Probably a silly question because by the time I hit 60 it’ll probably be December and MC should well and truely be on farm
---
Orc stun resist is 25% more effective. So orcs have base stun resist of all races x1.25. When an orc puts on an item that gives you 1% stun resist, orcs get 1.25% stun resist. Etc. Orcs do not have 40% stun resist outside of private servers.
---
-I am an orc, I resist less than 1 in 10 stuns, certainly not 1 in 3.
---
Dwarven District are simply not hitting their agreed carbon emission targets and it's a growing concern.
---
Respiratory illnesses are up 35%.
---
Unlock your bars and move them elsewhere so that your attention isn't fixated to the left edge of your screen.
---
Most people don’t, it makes much more sense just to keep questing and get it at 42-43
---
Ugh, why settle for something that's 1/2 as good? All the BoE swords are so garbage compared to these bad boys.
---
I always knew those filthy Alliance beat their wives.
---
This makes me happy
---
Do some dungeons dude
---
I agree with this for the most part, but let's be real. Firestones aren't getting used for example.
---
Theres not too many options, engineering bombs are the best answer for initial threat.  Demo shout is pretty worthless now, you'll be better off just tabbing through with sunders and revenge procs.
---
Right? Like I mean if they hadn't fired off at me for just participating in an OW event I would have been civil, but damn.
---
what makes more money, alchemy or leatherworking?
---
Rerolling time?
---
Are you not collecting BiS gear?
---
Necrophagist - nice
---
what
---
the
---
fuck
---
;D
---
Needed numbers that run and I’m more concerned about the chain chest than HoJ
---
&gt; Icy veins also ranks agility just above strength when it comes to survivability btw because it gives you armor and dodge however nobody seems to be taking into account how bad most of the agility gear is for warriors in this game.
---
Shifting the goalposts a bit now huh?
---
It must be hard to admit you're the kind of person who can't ever admit they're wrong. But at this point you're definitely too pot committed.
---
I would hate you for not finishing the trade and drink my milk.
---
Just buy a Reed. 4Head
---
Call me crazy, but I don't believe that when a Warden staff drops in ZF, or a Dwarven handcannon drops in LBRS, that any random feral druid or hunter in those groups actually deserve these items simply because they can use them and they are BiS.
---
Warden staff is BiS FOR THE ENTIRE GAME, ALL PHASES. Dwarven handcannon is like 200g. These items are BOE world drops however...
---
I believe that the Recipe for epic priest\mage\lock robes are a little bit different, since these drop from a specific boss\mobs and people might go there SPECIFICALLY for those. Should always be called out, I'm here for the recipe or whatever, if people don't agree find another group that does.
---
A random BOE epic dropping in a dungeon should be needed by all, all the time. You can argue that it's not fair, but it's also not fair for 4 people in a group to pass 500 gold simply because the group as a whole got lucky AF.
---
The two examples I referred to above actually happened to me. Warden staff dropped when we where spellcelaving ZF, everyone needed. The Dwarven handcannon dropped in LBRS, hunter was in group, everyone needed, hunter thought that was fair as well.
---
BOE blues are different, BOE epics can give you a fucking HOURS or even DAYS worth of grinding gold in one roll....fuck you for thinking you deserve it over the rest of the group, selfish fuck.
---
Could you link me some good sub builds with imp sprint?

&gt; I've been tanking up to Scarlet monastery and wondering if anyone has an experience tanking at higher levels or think it would work for 5 man content at 60. (I know I'll be either totem bitch or have to respec to raid. )
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Yes, I've tanked as a Raid Shaman Tank up t'ill Naxxramas a level 60 raid instance on pservers.
---
Shaman Tanking is viable and has been for years. Shaman can tank raids if given the right amount of effort. I've been playing as a Shaman Tank for +8years. Shaman Tanking in Classic is more possible than ever (pservers are considered harder than Classic, so make of that what you will...)
---
Every downside of a shaman as a tank has been rectified (mana, taunt, threat, etc...) over the years. If you have any more questions feel free to let me know. By no means is tanking easy, [so here's something to help you along.
---

Warlock Raid Tanking is also a thing: https://classicwow.live/guides/718/caperfin-s-advanced-warlock-raid-tank-guide
---
Did they just get rid of day night cycle in retail?
---
The Sharex source code is public and it's not a random program. 
---
It just seems that you don't really know how to work with a computer.
---
Cheers man, i also struggled but then i heard that "warriors are gods in killing lower level mobs" so i tried it and man, the xp goes so much faster even with 5 levels lower mobs, as far as the mobs level is green and give XP, its much better and faster to level in that zone. Yesterday i met a guy that was killing mobs 1-2 levels higher than him and he had to eat after each fight :( poor guy, i sent him to other zone thats better for him
---
Alsp on Razorgore-EU Alliance, and same yell in Ironforge, haha...
---
I might be wrong. But I always thought you were supposed to greed if people with main spec needed something. Might only apply in guilds. 
---
I've seen it a lot in normal dungeon runs though, people asking if they can need for offspec
---
Then after you're done with the run, he sneaks back and opens the chest himself
---
Exactly.   Its like fishing or hunting.  I'd you take too many they will all be gone soon.   
---
You must gank ally in a sustainable fashion.
---
It is actually much faster to click on those small, movable dot and draf it down to quickly scroll down :)
---
I'm ashamed to not have thought to look in the settings lol
---
They did that in retail with personal loot. LMAO
---
So what? But I'm a rogue, not sure how it measures
---
&gt; Okay just tested it, I'm using Spiderfang Carapace , it has 13 damage and healing. Wraith Scythe gains 13 shadow damage so yes it's 100% scale. Sorry for the false info before, and thank you for posting this otherwise I probably would have overlooked the scaling!
---
lol for a moment there I panicked. Thanks for the confirm :)
---
On my mage alt, I had someone get mad for giving them "bad water". Thing is, it was the highest I could make. 🤷‍♂️
---
Damn I remember running pindlebots and other mf bots at night. It was like Christmas each morning checking my stash what I got when I was asleep.
---
&gt; You can't cast heals while in shadow form, but that's easily fixed by not turning on shadow form.
---
Woah
---
I use TSM exclusively for this. I Made a Macro to Toggle the TSM Addon on and Off and Once or twice a day i turn it on, scan the auction house, take a look at the crafting report and turn it off again. (Because it changes way more Windows than i am comfortable with)
---
Tanks too.
---
&gt;Oh I know it pisses you off. Instead of getting to your body in a minute of running you have to sit there.....for 10 ish more minutes and watch me laugh and point emote over and over and over. Throw a few rasps in there and a couple quick jerky weapon unsheath and resheaths. I know it pisses you off.
---
You getting bullied in school or something? Doing this to strangers you don't even know is not normal behavior.
---
You can also click the item in your bag to pull it out onto your cursor and "drop it" by clicking it onto the persons character and it will auto open the trade window and put the item into trade. 
---
I'm glad the game managed to get a bunch of new people involved. Funny thing about games like this is there are no doubt a bunch of helpful people around willing to struggle with you while you learn things. But the other side of that with literal elitist jerks is a thing too more often than not. When you run into those scenarios don't let it discourage you into feeling like you won't ever try to group again or whatever the case may be. Hell, don't even feel like you gotta rely on someone else to make groups and all that. Just make them yourself and find other people that want to learn too and better yet someone to teach. The game has a lot of depth but I guess its up to you to be interested enough in whatever aspect of it you want to get good at. Exploring, Dungeon running, playing the auction house, Professions, macro building, PvP, Battlegrounds, or just a cool place to chat with people like any other social network site only you're playing a mmo while chatting.  
---
Thinking back, being a noob was probably one of the funnest parts of my entire wow career which is way longer than I want to admit. I don't regret a bit of it. I met so many people from all over the world many of which I'm still in contact with today even though I rarely get to play anymore. Got to raid at some of the highest levels got to pvp with and against some of the best. Many many world events, launch parties, the great Blackrock exodus while being there before "Blackrock is full gtfo" was a thing.    
---
So yeah it's the journey for sure. As for the destination... I don't know I haven't made it there yet.  
---
I do wish you the best on yours though.

---
Ench and alch is useless if you are not going to grind recipes. LW &amp; Tailor can be useful because of cooldown on leather / mooncloth math.
---
For me, LW is a must. Imagine you are going to kill 1000 dragons for epic/blue boe's. Waste of 1000 skin-able corpse.
---
And I choose mining over herb. Only ach people use herb. But people going to powerlvl engineering etc. will going to bust on mined materials.
---
You must have been seriously paranoid about not meeting the deadline, gaining too much exp, server crashing etc.
---
Pet skill books don't require all the previous ranks to learn, which can be quite a gold saver. So if you finally buy other skills, only get the highest rank.
---
I just don’t want to throw away gold on enchants etc it it’s something I could end up replacing in a week ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
*Refreshing* wizard piss!
---
Brother, stop while you're ahead.
---
What a bitch. Luckily I've not had any of those people in my groups yet
---
The LFG tool should be turned into a lobby system tool that you can filter by dungeon so you can see who is LF what. Everything else still has to be manually done like inviting to group, walking to dungeon etc etc
---
How much does BIS matter? Only thing I’m missing is mage belt from arena wanted to get that before moving on to lbrs and such. But it’s starting to drive me nuts. Been doing arena runs since 55 I’m 1 bar from 60 now.... I did farm a few elementals in that time but arena has been my life for 5 whole levels now
---
I was in the same boat - I was wondering why the hell my wand was better than my Shadow Bolt this whole time.
---
maybe at level 10 a rare BOE lasts 4 levels but FOH if you think  people don’t use some BOEs from their 30s until their 50. 
---
bitch i literally used a green BOE from 38 until 51 and i’m sure people have even bigger stretches theyve used rare and epic gear longer than that. 
---
you really think that the only people using BOE rares and epics are the people who buy them off the AH? 
---
you’re probably one of the same dumbasses that think people buying gear off the AH makes them a reckless fool with gold.
---
Well i'm sorry to tell you, you're not doing it right. What proffessions do you have? Skinning and mining are easily to best to grind gold.
---
How do you ban that which has no life?
---
Thanks for the old reliable Reddit armchair psychologist analysis.
---
I don't need to be commited to anything or move the goalposts. Strength is the superior stat and all the BiS lists prove it.
---
That's understood and there's nothing wrong with it, IF he communicates it up front. If he says nothing when they group starts and then changes it to master looter right before the engagement, it's shady.
---
Hello all,
---
Currently maining a Warlock with Herb Alch and I'm interested in levelling a Shadow Priest alt because It's my second favorite class. 
---
I intend to go hard on PvP and be a complete menace on my server, I'm interested in Tailoring and Engineering, likely to funnel resources from my main to my Priest so I can level smoother. My question is, do you guys have any tips? Specifically about healing dungeons and levelling alts.
---
This is me every other level. Hey, I'm getting a good amount of gold now. Ding! Oh, yeah right.
---
Think of the resons why you like it and you'll know the reasons why i dislike it.
---
Dungeon finder was the last patch of Wotlk. And flying mounts were only common for the level 80s who had a ton of money, typically when they had already experienced like 99% of the world. 
---
I am not for widespread flying mounts like they had in Cata, but I do support the idea of flying mounts for those who really invest in them.
---
with a shield you have a lot of revenge procs, which are one of the best tool to keep the mobs on you
---
i thought piercing howl would be a great escape tool. instead i got chased by a gargoyle halfway across epl.
---
Jeff would be so proud of you!
---
Just do some dungeons then...
---
I got mount at 42 and did not even need it until I started Zul'Farrak. 
---
You can skip on different ranks but you should buy all abilities so you have an actual toolkit. You need your skills at least unlocked - they don't need to do that much damage. Sitting there with actual utility skills untrained just tosafe some bucks is retarded. Especially after you got your mount.
---
You fucking buy your skills! All of them!
---
Then think about if you go for rank upgrades.
---
Derping in BRD with a Warlock who can't banish is so stupid, all that just because his "guide" told him not to learn banish. WAT
---
Read the passive, read the wiki, and read the reasons why Blizz nerfed several times the racial in the expansions to come.
---
I love you &lt;3
---
No need to feel sorry, this is war. I used to leave alliance players alone if they were working on something (killing mobs, fishing etc). But yesterday i left alone an alliance fisherman to kill some quest mobs near him. The moment i i turned my back and started pulling 2-3 mobs he killed me. No more mr nice guy. From now on red is dead.
---

---
I do love a good "blegh." Hell, I sometimes add my own to songs that don't have them
---
Very likely because basically every Priest wants Benediction, as the more casual players start hitting 60 the demand will spike and guilds will react accordingly. People rarely turn down an opportunity to make good money if they can see it.
---
Exactly, he KILLED A MOB. Holy shit I almost came. Playing Rogue watching this made me cry. He's a super  star!
---
Some people need the clarification. Some people need explicit and detailed instruction.
---
Thanks for the belly laugh this gave me.
---
Shadow bolt is pretty useless once you get a wand.
---
Whats that strat and how long does it take?
---
Because your damage depends on Rage, and you get no Rage if you don't hit.
---
Also most warriors use slow, chunky weapons.
---
So a single miss from a 3.8 speed axe means you lose out on -both- a big chunk of white damage and rage, as opposed to f. example rogue who's 2.7 speed weapon miss is annoying but does not impact generation of energy or combo points, and thus does not impact the pace of combat as much.
---
Of all the party members to try to screw over, healer is the one you really can't go without
---
*sitting on PC playing wow*
---
Man I should totally pick up my phone for that photo. Way more convenient.
---
The game is giving me so much more joy than any of the expansions ever did. I've always been more interested in the leveling process than the end game anyways. It feels like leveling is a mix of questing and instancing, while end game is mostly just instancing, which gets boring.
---
the group was great btw :) mage also gave me shit ton of water so he is well forgiven
---
Because NPCs start selling better water sooner. But it costs money, so theese players only show how noobish they are, not knowing that.
---
Interested for my Rogue.
---
Darkmoon faire is an event on a constant schedule, people know when it is held. You could say the same about when the fishing contest or chest spawn in gurubashi arena but it would just be a waste of space, everyone knows it spawns every 3 hours.
---
there is no argument... its DM
---
Nice try but this is how you end up in a bathtub full of ice wondering where your kidneys are.
---
Never again.
---
Does it actually make that big a difference? Rolled a dwarf warrior last night and plan on pvping a lot but might consider rerolling if I can do fun burst combos.
---
Would be easy to limit you to ignoring someone a maximum of twice per day. There's no good reason to ignore unignore a person more times than that.
---
You need your toolkit!
---
If a tank in BRD, LBRD etc. calls for sheep, sap, banish, etc. you should have those skills unlocked at lvl50+ 
---
Buy your skills!
---
No you absolutely don't. The rend weapons are only BIS because of the set bonus. If you only have one, they're really shit.
---
For just one item, the BIS would be Bone Slicing Hatchet.
---
Yes there is - it’s 5%.  Orcs have 30% base stun resist.
---
&gt; I’ve been doing this now to random people before I get off. 
---
Uhm.. ok!
---
Skinning and mining lol
---
&gt;I don’t see info about Diablo, Overwatch, Starcraft or Hearthstone when playing WoW because it’s not relevant to what I am currently playing.
---
Because it is not related to WoW, if you have a sub for classic you are guaranteed to also have a sub for retail.
---
I just couldn't find higher resolution of the icons than 64x64 and up-scaling them to a size where text is also readable turns them into mush...

I remember telling someone to do some command in an Arma 2 mod of DayZ which was basically an alt-f4 and it worked.
---
I was then permabanned by an admin about 5 minutes later with only a message that said "not so funny is it?" And I lost a loooot of hours of progress.

Think the ruling was a bit harsh over a harmless joke but whatever. Hella worth.

You dont NEED to do anything, play to have fun comrade

I tell my friends “haha fuck you” all the time jokingly. Just playing devils advocate.
---
I mean, rooting is still valid as it takes druids longer to break it and get back into form than it takes a mage to nova.
---
Probably both. MC aggro carries over to the MC'd typically, and I've heard stories from a Shaman friend of mine that guard aggro seems especially rabid in Classic. He got attacked for grounding a spell cast at him, as well as simply healing himself when attacked by another player.
---
Am I allowed to blizzard say the spiders in Lbrs? Would be able to get the whole channel but I definitely took aggro I couldn’t tell if it was me or because of pally tank. There’s so many that it seems I should be aoeing though
---
Some warriors do this when we don't even have AoE damage and then we are close to wiping multiple times. Pull as few mob at a time as possible if we don't have AoE, how is that a hard concept to understand? The time we gain by not drinking and not wiping &gt; the time we lose from pulling mobs one by one.
---
And I'm fine to agree with that when I see some tests confirming that, do you have anything?
---
/spit after killing them while questing is pathetic
---
There's a bunch of ways to try these things out.
---
If it's been like this for say just one day or even two, it might be an ISP thing.
---
If you dont have an ethernet cable at the length you need, google powerline networking, that might help out a bit, can read up on it as well not always a good thing.
---
Try other games too, a reason why youtube or twitch works is cause they buffer a certain amount of content that you can watch if even if your internet drops for a moment.
---
Might even be that they wireless receiver on the new comp is wonky or not as good as your laptop one. Wireless has so many factors to it that it's hard to say. If you can establish that a wired connection works without hickups, then you at least know that it's not your network that's having issues.
---
How have you been that fast as Warrior? Did you use a specific guide? That's pretty cool!
---
Just a random question but who thinks Blizzard should of tuned up the overall difficulty before releasing 'Classic'?
---
That voice...
---
I miss them.
---
What a surprise :D :D : D
---
Was gambling 20s a roll with my party while waiting on the tank to get to us, lost 2g I said that’s fine I’ll win rolls in the dungeon. Didn’t win shit lol
---
Literally go farm Rock Elementals.  You will have the money in no time.
---
Jeez, and I thought I was lucky getting the ring at 48 and the Savage Chain at 52, but you went ahead and got HoJ as well.
---
you can get around this by writing a "only petattack if pet does not have a target already or current target is dead" into the macro... I think it's something like /petattack [noharm][noexists][dead] but I can't check my macros rn.
---
At times like these, hit them with the Astral Recall.
---
Why not VC?
---
Aw, poor guy. I legitimately had to ask how to gquit the other day (15 years is a long time, okay?!) because I got a guild invite while I was LFG Ragefire Chasm and accepted without looking, thinking it would be a dungeon group. :'D
---
Gratz , me and my Mate are only LV 30, but the mount ist near :3
---
It's fine untill a hunter shows up and shows you how slow and shit you are. As long as nobody is around to compare yourself to its a fun experience.
---
Our users are blocked to install any programs, and since my team is implemetating some new software, I  really don't have time to play at work, unfortunately =(
---
&gt;Specifically about healing dungeons and levelling alts.
---
Keep the tank alive above everything else. Especially as leveling as a shadow priest your heals are going to be mana intensive and inefficient. You'll often have to choose between keeping the tank alive, or trying to save a DPS who pulled aggro. Toss a renew on the DPS and wish them the best, if you can even afford the spare mana for a renew.
---
As for leveling an alt- try going to a different started zone. I'm leveling a human warrior alt, and my priest is a human as well who I leveled in the human starting areas, so I've gone to darnassus so I'll have new and interesting quests to do instead of grinding the same exact ones over again.
---
Good to see I’m not the only one! It’s comforting to know there are others in my shoes who see WoW the same way
---
There are plenty of dungeons and world pvp to supplement leveling.
---
If that’s all not doing it for you this might not be your game
---
Blauyux? Blaumeux!
---
Also North west of desolace in the sea around the nagas are a loads of boxes that you can open.
---
As a priest can you please convince me to level tailoring? I already started it and cannot see any benefit in it...
---
Hey fellow players!  
---
I just bought Taran Icebreaker for  38g(47 wep 2.3 speed 49,6 dps). I am a lvl 52 enhancement shaman, is it worth using it all the way to lvl 60 or will i find something better? I havent equipped it yet, as i got second thoughts wether or not its worth it..   
---
Hope some enha nerds can help me out!   
---
Cheers
---
Yes, 100% agree
---
Do you know you can loot grey and white trash and sell it to the vendor?
---
Because sometimes when I see VC I mistake it for WC or think it's 'Virtual Console'. 🙃
---
And we're disagreeing with you mate
---
After buying my mount, I'm constantly running into town and having less than 1g to spend after I spend my money.
---
It's usually: get these abilities that you've skipped 1.62g smth at this level.
---
Learn these alchemy recipes: 1g \~225level
---
Buy these recipes from AH: whatever you can afford
---
This is sound advice - while I do enjoy creating these, I feel as though I've spent the past week playing World of UIcraft. I might take a minute to play the actual game.
---
You will get there mate, start doing SM, it helps a lot on the financial side, some weapons dropped there can be selled for 1g, you just need to have luck on the greed roll =D
---
Like seriously, fuck off. Your BiS is an 18% drop in Strat that you'll have very little competition for. Instead you're willing to need on a 4% drop from UBRS that is actually BiS for Warriors and Rogues. 
---
People like you are the reason the "hunter needs on everything" stereotype exists. It sucks that I have to quiz every hunter I want to invite to a dungeon group with "are you going to need on melee weapons that aren't even really good for you, just because you can wear them?". I don't have to do that shit with melees when there is a hunter in the group, I've never had a melee need a ranged weapon when the hunter needed it because "it has slightly better stats".
---
I took the Zeppelin to Grom'Gol Base Camp in STV, jumped out over the ocean before we got to dock. The AFK swim to Westfall was only 5 mins. I killed about 25 smugglers and trappers at Jangelode Mine (45,25).  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7997/red-defias-mask](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7997/red-defias-mask)

Hi shoutout.
---
What kind of pathetic human being would lie on Reddit for karma? jfc
---
&gt; Devalues gear/appearance 
---
How so? There is plenty of good gear out there that looks ridiculous. Why shouldn't I be able to make it match the rest of my gear? Additionally, if I want to change my gear to look like a hard to acquire piece of gear, I still need to actually acquire it before I can transmog to it, so how does it devalue the gear? 
---
&gt; Reduces immersion 
---
If anything, I feel the opposite. It feels much cooler to be raiding alongside people who have matching gear rather than bits and pieces from lots of sets, etc.
---
&gt; Cheapens new content 
---
Don't understand what you mean by this. 
---
My 2 cents is that I shouldn't have to choose between looking good and wearing the best gear available. (Of course I will always choose the latter, but with transmog I can do both). 
---
To be clear, I don't actually think they should add Transmog to Classic, as part of the vanilla experience is everyone looking funny. I'm just curious as to why people think its a bad system in general.
---
for the helm yes, for the rest rather not. I just like to complete all quests ^^
---
Oh, the guy I killed was a hunter.
---
I used to always do it when playing warlock. Back the it caused amazement in people. Clearly back then not enough locks did this. I have similar experiences now.
---
yes, there was no way to defend all of the poor Magnis.  Yall just eluded. No credit this time. About time for layering to be gone imo..
---
That's nice of them considering they can't use it
---
Lookin at your post history is upsetting. I hope you find help man. Positive
---
What mod are you using for your group bar and the 5sr bar above it?
---
Sweet, that was fast I guess! :)
---
I'm at 240 or so. Takes like 8 fish for 1 skill. Not bad, since you're pretty much guaranteed to level up the skill.
---
I'd say if you're low level or often doing 2-3+ pulls speccing into voidwalker is the better option, because lifedrain with fel concentration looses it's value with the high pushback chance, but when facing 1 enemy at time speccing lifedrain is better because not having to manage threat plus being able to use a higher dps pet t just makes things much faster. 
---
Also regarding dark pact if you're using succ/Hunter you're not really spamming their abilities (at least I don't), so factoring in their Mana regen you should have enough Mana to use their abilities when needed unless you're constantly draining their Mana to zero or leaving abilities on autocast. I will agree though that it's bad with imp/vw as they both rely on Mana much more.
---
Weakauras.
---
Necrosis.
---
&gt; What if I'm melee-weaving while my pet tanks and having him pull a new mob when I melee to finish off the last? That will be at least a couple hits. 
---
Think of health as a resource that doesn't matter as long as it's above 0 in PvE. If you're taking hits, fine (ideally, you work out a kiting and pulling method where you only melee for the very final blow), but even then, your armor value is not going to be a deciding factor. Oh, and you get armor from agility, too! 
---
&gt; Also, when you say "AP", ranged and melee are completely separate stats right? Something that just says "attack power" won't affect my ranged damage at all, will it? In that case, the only things I've seen that increase ranged are my hunter's mark and aspect of the hawk.
---
Well, yes and no. Attack Power does affect your Range Attack Power, too. There are very few items that specifically only give ranged attack power, that was a design choice in order to keep these items off of rogues, warriors, shamans etc. So if you see an item that says "Attack Power", it's great for you.
---
People didn't know that as they bitched and screamed about it in discord though.
---
That made me laugh. 
---
But how does it apply to them not having intact hooves when hunter shoots them? 
---
I understand mages magic be it frost or fire will likely make them crack or burn. (No one kills them using arcane only right?)
---
I use CCC on my rogue to monitor stunlock. Works a charm. It tracks all debuffs as a cast bar and also tracks diminishing returns
---

---
&gt; So my silk that id only make a 5s profit on goes unsold and I'm out the deposit. So i stopped bothering and just sell stuff for vender price to guildies or use trade
---
If you don't already have it, get first aid. Take all that cloth that you are vendoring and make bandages. And then vendor *them*. I constantly see people spamming in trade that they want to buy Silk Cloth for 35-37s / stack because they can vendor the bandages made by a stack for 40s. 
---
Same works for Cooking aswell, plenty of weird food-stuffs can be bought crazily cheap, turned into meals and then sold off for profit (either to vendors or through the AH).
---
Huntards are the new huntards change my minds
---
From a 1-20 perspective warrior is one of my favorit classes to play tbh. You just need a weapon from the AH or a lucky drop and you faceroll through everything for the time.
---
Played every class but rogue to 20+ now and warrior is in my top 3.
---
Be quiet. Don't speak again. Beta.
---
Only 8 hours to max? \*Laughs in RunesScape\*
---
&gt;guessing to save on resources and make the game smaller?
---
Classic mobile version confirmed.
---
we could use focus target in vanilla though.. so he has a point. I really miss it too!
---
To be fair, if he expected you the second time, he could've prevented blind using Abolish Poison, and Sap using Bear Form.
---
"Thanks, go fuck yourself."
---
Why at level 60 do you still have the xp bar?
---
you need rage to deal dmg, you get less rage if youre not taking any dmg.
---
Why is this nsfw??
---
Others have answered you already. Im just gonna say this
---
&gt;I've seen some people say it takes away from the achievement aspect of acquiring gear, but I don't understand that argument because you still need to acquire the gear before you can transmog to it.
---
This would be a valid argument in classic but you started in cata and in all the time you played retail that was never a valid argument. Someone who never raided in their live could be running in cata looking like a demigod with tier 6 because you could just go back and solo farm it
---
It works in forms for sure, just doesn't do much since cat form white damage is ass.
---
Yep
---
I recommend replacing standard spells with a /cast "spell" macro as it always uses the highest rank and saves you remembering to exchange for newest spell rank.
---
I have petattack attached to my normal attack as well - not just engaging spells... I don't always want to dot something (e.g. when the tank can't cope with my threat levels) but this saves me from having an additional pet attack key bind and/or having to remember a modifier ;) 
---
some ppl macro a /petfollow into drain souls to make sure they get "last hit" on a mob... I have not had the use for it, yet... I never have an issue getting a soulshard.
---
apart from macros - if you play with addons - get one that shows you when your dots/fear/banish will expire.
---
Feign desth on 9 :S
---
You're right. I always had a dream of dinging to give me exactly 1337 xp over 60, because I was just THAT cool back then.
---
For survivability, yes. The crit trinket is good if you overgear the content and just want to output more threat.
---
Ah gawd, these clowns.. please come again and say (pretend) they do not exist.
---
wait we get new skills next phase?
---
Ofc main specc &gt; off spec in a raid. But in a dung? Nah.
---
You can craft Truefaith Vestments later, or various other things to wear if you ever put some effort into tailoring.
---
Aw, that's a bummer, I am not in IT just your average office worker but we are blocked from installing anything as well sadly.
---
Stay arms/get sweeping strikes and farm mobs in SM/ZF. Also aim to get ravager axe off Herod.
---
🤙
---
Looks like the standard raid profile enabled for dungeons, not sure about the bar above it though.
---
He's specifically talking about being in a group of 4 who are doing this together to win all rolls. They will just kick you immediately and replace people until someone doesn't roll needs
---
I train all of my skills too. 46 rogue with tribal leatherworking, 300 cooking, and a decent amount of gold
---
Warlocks are not mages, and there are some pretty viable spec builds based on the concept of you tanking for a DPS pet.  If you're not familiar, search for "warlock drain tanking" for an idea.  Might not be your playstyle, but it's totally viable to succeed with you tanking for your pet rather than the other way round.
---
You’re one of the best classes for soloing the demons in Winterspring for Eye of Shadow. It’s a lot less consistent than Mara, but has a big lotto payout when it works, and it’s way less mentally demanding than Mara farm.
---
Had a run today where the Holy pally needed it and said it they need to get 60 too, it was a good "leveling trinket." They won the roll and our tank cried.
---
I met a completely new level 20 mage in Stonetalon while I was getting my brutal armor at lvl 30. He was doing a quest in the same mine I had to get my ores. I noticed him struggling when he accidentally pulled too many mobs, so naturally I saved him. I could tell he admired me, the same way I always admired higher level players when I was new. His first words to me was "hello" "I am new", and there was something so endearing about it that I decided to take him under my wing.
---
I asked if he needed help and we grouped up, he had to protect a goblin miner doing his job, and after the first wave of mobs I sat down perched behind the miner looking outwards. This is something I just like to do because I like the way Trolls sit down, especially above ground level, they look like they're scouting. So everytime we finished fighting i went back and sat down, and every time he came running after and sat down next to me. Asking me a bunch about his class and spec, if frost mage was good or not, which professions to pick. Naturally I answer that mages are one of if not the best class in the game and all the other questions he had. After the quest I escorted him out of the mine and told him to add me and to whisper if he ever needed help or if he got any questions. So far he hasn't whispered me, but I have him on my friends list, and every day his level is higher and I just take a silent moment of pride for him, like a father watching his son grow up.
---
*facepalm* In an instance, you are meant to be a team. A druid wouldn't refuse to buff you, a mage *shouldnt* refuse to give you water, a warlock wouldn't refuse to summon you and a rogue *shouldnt* refuse to open chests.
---
Or put the loot limiter to blue and do /random rolls on the couple blue items that you will get in the run, when you are killing like 2 bosses.
---
You can combat distraction by holding down your right mouse button and moving your mouse left and right rapidly I think
---
Hit rollim dad?
---
Still using it at 50, but only parts of the set. You can buy most parts in the AH though
---
The biggest bitch move in WoW
---
That mage is nob
---
BIS gathering trinket :D
---
This brought my memories from 2004s. Damn...
---
By the same token, had Transmog not been a thing in Cata, I could still be running around looking like a demigod in tier 6, I just wouldn't be doing anywhere near as much damage. 
---
It seems like your issue is more with the ease of acquiring gear that was once hard to acquire, which I can understand.
---
Silk routinely goes for ~38s on my server, and you can almost always find Silk for 40s / stack. Haven't AH'ed Silk in ages personally. Mageweave still sells for ~1,05g / stack, so profit can still be made there compared to bandaging the cloth. I guess the insane amount of people farming SM helps drive down the price of Silk.
---
The highest rank of water is from a quest in Dire Maul. That dungeon won't be in the game until the next phase.
---
That's ok. You rely on 2 things when it comes to damage - gear and rage. You'll get better gear later as well as talents/skills to help build up rage.  It's normal for warriors to feel a bit underwhelming at first but they are an absolute beast in later stages..
---
tldr
---
Try Grid2, similar layout but shows debuffs/threat/hots/whatever as different coloured borders or squares.
---
This is why I’m levelling a rogue, this kinda shit.
---
 I like to meditative grinding mobs or resources.  
---
You got me there :)  
---
May I ask whats the most worthwhile to grind in Un'goro?
---
do note he did so much damage because he crit and got a sword spec proc. Looks like his mainhand procced 2nd hit, and both attacks from MH plus offhand crit.
---
Totally new guy in wow with no friends to show him the ropes. (And MMO's in general it seems based on the tale). Seems to not know the basics of the game, has to be toured around the world, but is still lvl 60 and is tanking UBRS 1 month after release.
---
Your story does not really add upp Mr Hunter.
---
Getting ooked in the dooker
---
He basically LEEEROY JENKINS that shit
---
It's not. 
---
Given you're the one throwing out insults I don't think you're in a position to teach me about politeness ;)
---
I have downloaded Luna from several different sites now and I'm doing something wrong. It's always an old version. Do you happen to have an updated link?
---
dwarf is still good PvP, its the only race that can get rid of bleeds.
---
"flight of slippery stairs" oh well, I suddenly remember where the scar on my shin comes from. Carrying those beasts of monitors and towers up into the attic was a nightmare but the lan party was well worth it. Even the scar.
---
Indeed the clear speed is much faster and better, personally i only do this with friends or guild mates.
---
Probably the best that could happened. The most comon reason for being friend zone is not being straight about it.
---
Yeah but unfortunately for us kitties, there really aren’t any better options for pure dps. I’ve taken to wearing tanking trinkets for now however because the group won’t mind if I do slightly less dps without dps trinkets and I’d rather have the added survivability for the times when the tank goes down and I have to go bear and tank.
---
For starters, the crabs are passive. "Already going" is deceiving. Second, this isn't some stupid decision pull that left you clueless, you gave them permission to try this beforehand. 
---
&gt;"go"
---
*waits five seconds before standing up*
---
&gt;"Dumb mage"
---
Yeah ok.
---
This, but also because I don't want people to message me or my guildies in game. I just want to be a player like everyone else. Though, I doubt anyone would do it over such a small post, rather safe han sorry.
---
Na, hunter is a counter to rogues if both are played correctly. That’s pretty much a accepted vanilla fact.
---
Doesn’t mean rogues can’t win against hunters.
---
Also what good will it do for the rogue to sit in the deadzone? He won’t be able to hit either. Deadzone=Too close for ranged to far for melee
---
[Hunters are stand users.](https://youtu.be/pMwTZ6HuwLY)
---
I saw a streamer reset his ressurection sickness by gaining to many debuffs. Do I guess it still works.
---
I like the class-intern balance of speccs, they just suit in certain situations.
---
Furry warrior: PvE
---
Arms Warrior: PvP
---
Tank Warrior: PvE
---
Heal Priest: Everything
---
Shadow Priest: PvP
---
Heal Pally: Everything
---
Prot pally: No
---
Ret pally: No
---
Which is great for aoe tanking no?
---
You should be fine, but you need good dps and/or a dedicated healer. Did a run yesterday with a 44 fury warrior, 2H axe, deathless run thanks to high damage and resto shaman
---
I shit you not, I came to the comments to write this exact same response.. phrasing and all..
---
I don't get it, he ask ready and someone says go, what am I missing?
---
the panels are made with Vuhdo,
---
the timer above is fivesecondrule (to show mana cooldown timer),
---
and above that I have showmemyheal
---
I find the lack of Horde camping at Heming disturbing... On my server this camp always belongs to the Horde.
---
Not trying to offend you but u need to make some gold how are u able to afford consumables for you raid
---
One extra tip for this is to only use rank 1 of the curse. All ranks stop enemies fleeing, higher ranks just give more AP/armor reduction and cost more mana.
---
Im new so Im also intrested in the answer,
---
early on (1-150) I kinda saw some benefit but it still was hard to keep it up to date
---
other than that there is truefaith armor and the wraps with mana regen
---
but i would also love to see some good elaboration
---
Colored by health value
---
Perhaps spamming Bloodrage is not always worth it, as it costs HP.
---
So hilariously mean. I love it.
---
you take this too serious man, the mage was fine this was just a funny thing that happened.
---
You will probably find something better as you want slow speed high top end damage for windfury, for pve though taran is probably good dps proccing flurry
---
nah, he was pretty good actually, he just took more than he could handle
---
The goold days... Back then I was playing D2 with a friend once but his brother kept sending death pings over the LAN to crash our PCs. Good times (Yes, we crashed him back which pretty much started a local cyberwar).
---
i cleared mc since the second week too. Got my epic Mount and 4k Gold to spare but literally everyone in my Guild got that much gold
---
but he got 3 crits in the first attack
---
Look at Mr. Sherlock over here, doesn't take that long to get to 60 and the game is so nerfed being 1.12 talents it's a joke. I helped the dude quite a bit to get to max. Believe what you want.
---
warrior dps 29, RFK, got 2 super high rolls greed on 2 random shitty greens right before  overlord ramtusk,
---
corpsemaker drops.
---
warrior tank,shamy and I rolls need, got a 9.  FML.
---
was gonna replace it anyway with the WW axe in a couple of levels , but until i get it, i dont hit as hard as i would with corpsemaker
---
Wasn't meant to be a brag just sharing something that happened recently that put me back into the early days of WoW and making friends...
---
Yeah you right. All in all it is still pretty hilarious, cheers
---
Hey, I plan on pveing mostly, even for grinding pre bis I would like to be useful as enha instead of being forced to rest
---
why are shadow priests healing in dungeons/raids?
---
I know that its mostly solo/pvp spec but it can do some decent dmg too so why not queue as dps?
---
Why is it cut weird so that it looks like someone other than the healer said go? It is indeed Grom that said "Go".
---
Nerd
---
Okay and I thought it had to do with my HoJ. Turns Out it was ret aura all along.
---
You need her scales to make a cloak to survive a 1-shot mechanic in the next big raid, BWL.
---
You also need +320 skinning to do it, requiring a knife off the dog boss in UBRS and the skinning enchant to gloves. Every guild needs at least 1 full time skinner for that reason.
---
They are not, get Peacemaker
---
Not really. If the healer started healing you can be sure he would die. The tank pulls, they can survive it. They get abit threat and the mage SLOWS with blizzard and aoe it down. Not fucking arcane explosion
---
I would recommend a guy called Nobbel on youtube. You don't even need to watch them as the content is mainly just ingame content re-hashed. (I usually just listen podcast style) But this guy does Warcraft lore vids on almost any notable character, location, event, etc in the WC universe.
---
Nobbel actually cares about Blizzard's lore more than Blizzard, considering he has tried to do a chronological video on the entire lore of Warcraft and chats about lore points or topics Blizzard has never even mentioned. Plus he does a decent job of explaining the retcons / chnages to the lore too.
---
My tag should answer your question. But i guess for warriors yes. But thats not the problem. The problem is they only have holy water. While the others have the same amount of holy water, like a stack of food. Around 5 heal and 5 mana pots, some scrolls and greys worth like 2g. This is guaranteed i think, there can maybe aldo be some green gear ir better but im not sure on that one
---
I always loved being parried by a hunter Feigning death
---
I have proper consumes atm for raiding and materials for future raids too. Getting that +55 healing enchant on my mace drained me. Other than mana pots and runes, i have stuff for 2-3 resets (MC+Ony).
---
So im fine atm, just need to restock that mana stuff each week. Or get gold to buy em.
---
You can macro any rank of the spell and put it on your hotbar.
---
When I see a player of the opposing faction, his gear tells me a lot about my chances of survival if we were to engage eachother.
---
...You can easily clear that room like that. All you need is a mage with a little bit better movement.
---
Damn i forgot about this.
---
This is on Un'Goro right?
---
I’ve always been a fan of everyone rolling need on BOE’s since it can benefit everyone in the group if they sell it. As long as when the group starts everyone agrees to roll need on all BOE’s beforehand then it’s fair game. I like doing it this way because then you don’t have some people greeding and others needing. It completely takes out the ability to ninja the item as everyone is going to roll need and has equal chances.
---
Or wait until 60 and go with 1/2 max level friends. Princess runs take &lt;5 mins and you skip all trash.
---
You mean missing three times and therefore not hitting anything for 10 seconds?
---
typical alliance, cant evem markout every line :D
---
Thank you for taking the time out of your day to do this! I was overwhelmed with replies for a while so I hadn't gotten around to thanking everyone but thank you both!
---
I’d take 1% crit over 13 agi as a hunter.
---
They aren't even bis stat sticks
---
:P
---
Hey. We're on Shazzrah
---
**Hunters** (and Warlocks I guess)
---
I am guilty of some of this too on occasion.
---
- If you jump down somewhere, watch your pet and make sure it doesn't run off the long way around the drop and aggro 5 packs en route. Dismiss and resummon.
---
- Watch your pet if you're trying to squeeze past packs you don't intend to pull. Put it on stay, get past the pack yourself, and then position yourself so the pet runs to you when you put it back on follow such that it won't run into or near the packs you're skipping. If you're not confident it can do that, dismiss and resummon.
---
- Unless it's agreed as some sort of strategy (eg having your pet temporarily OT something), turn growl off.
---
&gt; but it would be easy to simply take player sdoing such a quest out of the PvP system for the duration of the quest.
---
It would be easy to simply play on a PVE server since it taking you out of the PvP system if you dont like it.
---
And carapace spine does more damage
---
Aha, I didn't remember those having so much stuff in them. Haven't been in Stratholme in years.
---
You know what how about I just delete this post to make you happy! Fuck it, tried to share a story that took me back to 15 years ago with you guys. Anyways and seriously have a good day
---
Ah, yes. The Classic WoW community.
---
Thank you! It's taking me a while to get to thank everyone but it really does mean something to me.
---
Hell yeah, Horde on Bigglesworth here! I love it here, everyone (on Horde side at least) are great and super friendly.  
---
Also, yeah, if anyone knows of some late night/early morning raids that need a PUG, hit me up, ;)
---
Are any high level fishes sellable?
---
See that's what I like about being a tank and my RL friend being the healer. People start acting like dicks and we just stop healing, or taunting mobs off of them....
---
Good
---
Definately sounds like the A.S.S. Company here on Firemaw
---
Now try doing that to an elemental mob
---
2 druids ez?
---
i dont know, i think its a waste in Dungeon to let the Priest Spirit Tap, too much effort and the mob might aggro other mobs. Just let him drink thats my experience.
---
If you are Questing yes do it,
---
but Dungeons? No.
---
Yeesh. It's gotta suck being that toxic. I pity you.
---
works... to the point! Say it again when someone will ninja 500G epic and you wont be able to do anything about it just because you thought the system works perfect.
---
Still 3 useful items to have. Why would I miss out on it. It’s not difficult or insanely expensive to relevel engineering
---
I was hoping the tank would pull, as expected. But yea it is a bit on me too :)
---
It's Cookie's Cove.
---
Honestly if I get a Hunter in my lbrs group I warn him that I'll reserve blackcrow.
---
I have noticed there have been a larger number of horde seen just in the last two days. I think horde on Skeram and others are realizing some PvP is better than no PvP and moving over.
---
Hahaha, rotation checks in wc, some people are really the saddest.
---
Him inviting you to group could have layered you away from brokentooth. Bold move.
---
Sure let's have it your way encourage unhealthy behaviour all the time.  
---
Only trying to give advice because I've been there.
---
Thank you! I know it has taken me a while to get to saying it but I appreciate it. The response to this was completely unexpected but it has been amazing to see all the screenshots.
---
Deleted?
---
Sunken Cost Fallacy - just because you have already "wasted" time doesn't mean you should keep wasting time. You had 5 days of some enjoyment. Great. Now get a new character and have 5 and more days of even more enjoyment. :)
---
Nice
---
I think it's better to get more buffs and such, like a shaman stoneskin totem is really strong early, or priest buff.
---
I'd rather do 2 different classes tbh but if i have to then i will play 2 druids
---
I have a better idea. Give us the option to hide all transmog. Everyone would be happy? People who like it would see theirs and others and people who dont like it could disable it and not see any transmogs. How is thid not a perfect solution that makes everyone happy? Why does it have to be forced on everyone?
---
I'll still say it when that happens. I'll also say that person is an absolute asshole and I'll never group with him or her again.
---
Smolderweb holler!
---
Not everyone gets jealous over pixels.
---
That was thoroughly enjoyable to watch.
---
They don't stack, one removes the other.
---
Chips.
---
No...you want a screenshot?
---
Occulus isnt worth a SoJ anyways
---
if  i see a warrior in full epics i stay away from him, if hes transmogged into some matching set from lvl 40 dungeon i cant tell his powerlevel.
---
Those are the same people.  
---
When you read his post you see that he just really enjoys pissing people off.   It's just like the ganking. I don't have a huge problem with someone ganking a lowbie, but if they procceed to camp lowbies that's just pathetic. Some thing with the distract. It's funny once. If you do it as many times (4) as you can to one person to piss them off then there's something wrong with you.  
---
Nobody wants to play with those people and if they are anything alike in rl then he probably doesn't have a lot of friends in rl as well.
---
What makes a pvp server exiting is the constant threat of the enemy. Will they attack, will they help? Getting a free pass will ruin that.
---
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me four times, I'm a dumbass that probably should find a different way to Ratchet. It's not like he's guarding the only way to change continents, and it's not like there is no simple solution to this - don't autowalk like an idiot again if you've gotten pushed off.
---
I don't think it's cool behaviour, personally I'm more in the "once is fun, more is mean" boat, but this particular thing is 100% avoidable without having to do anything except walk like a normal person.
---
Fair, I thought so too until I saw: [https://youtu.be/WnML22UxR1I](https://youtu.be/WnML22UxR1I)  
---
I mean, the shoulders are clashing everytime he jumps and the gear (especially the robe) looks so bad. I'm getting the big bad wolf vibe of Orc's in robes lately haha. Idk man... But thanks!
---
Not sure why you didn't.
---
Changing lot system mid run is considered a scam anyway
---
If you have a Wand that does shadow damage (BFD quest reward) then you can actually switch at 40 straight away cause your shadow weaving boosts shadow damage and not only spells. Something to consider :)
---
Honor ranking starts in Phase 2. Just no BGs. Don't miss the market.
---
Honestly just be a teamplayer and run to him earlier. If you wanna be a dictator then roll tank. We healers deal with it
---
Thank god as ele shammy lvl 50 and with no aspiration of going ench , i already have that ring..lol
---
True!! Good tips.
---
You can probably set a focus target with an addon
---
Lok'Tar Ogar! Thank you. I'm slowly getting around to saying it to everyone now that the responses have slowed down. I am in your debt!
---
It's a matter of preference I guess, personally what I do is respec at 45 and go soul link with improved corr, the VW becomes immortal and you become a fullblown tank too, the added damage from the demo tree gives the VW much needed threat and it can hold more than enough to warrant slight more aggressive style of play.
---
The upside with this spec is you can also run a non VW pet and facetank well enough without feeling like paper, you're also an un-gankable monster so no one will mess with you.
---
No it doesn't. It shuts the game down just like alt + f4. Idk if it's a bug or what, but I tried it the other day, and boom game insta closed.
---
Thank you for this
---
Trying to get short term benefits without thinking long term results. If this is what they actually do all the time soon they do not have anyone to play with.
---
get the '5 second rule' add-on for that.
---
Is there an addon to highlight certain words in chat? Could be handy within the massive spam in /world and /lfg.
---
Yeah it'll go WAY up for flag carriers though
---
Wrong! Read the previous comment to see which race are the best warlock.
---
Fair point. I guess I didn't think of this because I can't recognise gear by sight. To me its all just armour.
---
Instead of "mages move in" it's scourges.
---
Ah I see. 2 druids with engi seems 'duoable'
---
And Huntards are still Huntards.
---
To the ends of time
---
Arcane explosion, if you have shatter, does maybe four or five times as much damage. This mage needs to learn to make better use of nova and cone of cold, that's all. You don't nova and stand there like  a stiff.
---
Should have rolled female orc bro sorry for your loss
---
Acer XB270HU
---
Had it for years, great monitor. Luckily I missed the batch with edge light bleed(or whatever) and dead pixels.
---
Seemed like about the nicest way possible. Did you want me to add a smiley face? I'll confess, my ulterior motive is to get more people googling the Law.

I don't see how in anyway its on you, there's not a single class or spec that can heal stupid.

Seriously, I have been to some pretty crazy concerts and metal heads were always far, far more polite and approachable than anything I’ve ever seen at a country concert.

Didn't know about that addon, gonna give it a try, thanks mate

Can anyone recommend a $400 laptop to be used for classic?
---
Your guild may want you to use https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169 Nightfall, Enhance shaman is a good carrier.

At least he didn't blame anyone

Literally Google classic warrior pre raid bis. Wowhead has a guide.
---
True words were said, thank you!
---
I never really bothered too much with thunder clap since you are not in your def stance and the damage is minimal, but if demo shout is that worthless that's probably a great idea. So mostly single target spells it is, good to know :). Thanks.
---
You don't need a mount, only group with warlock to summon you to the next instance. Besides who needs mounts in dungeons, unless you are in ZF?
---
That phone quality tho
---
I don't even know what happened there.
---
The recipe is boe and if you want it as alliance, check the neutral ah.
---
Swiftthistle (often gathered with briarthorn) is selling for 5-6g a stack on my server.
---
Ah thanks guess I’ll keep vendoring then then
---
well he should pull from the other side to u guys.. not away from you guys lmao
---
The guy lost a bet at a tavern but then he couldn't pay. So the other gnomes told him "either make like a rig and let people step on you all day or we're gonna hog-tie you and ship you to the Forsaken"
---
He chose to live in she Instead of dying in agony.
---
Yeah, those are my favorite because I wait on deck like I normally would, and the person in that room knows exactly what's about to happen when I walk in. Unfortunately I have a 5 second silence, so there's not much most people can do to avoid it.
---
Cheers! And thank you.
---
Depends. I was hit with a distract in regular pvp and I didn't autowalk and I still walked a couple meters in the wrong direction.  
---
Yes I'm bad at pvp, but so are a lot of people, but if you're walking only a couple steps next to the water it's really hard to react before it's too late.
---
Didnt have Any screen recorder installeret
---
Isn't Moonglade the Druid only zone or am I misremembering?
---
I can't blame him for being misinformed, that's how I myself did interpret that Orc racial for a long time.
---
It's hard to know when games use additive or multiplicative percentages.
---
but couldnt you like queue HSan then cancel it to get the no penalty proc w/0 using HS ?
---
Elvui includes this function alrdy, which I think is what op is using cuz I use the same thing
---
... why exactly you have problem with that? You are a paladin, healer, only 1 other caster in your group (and its cloth) you have no competition for items for your role... ah right, its obvious, you wanted to need on the dps ring, while also needing on all healer/caster items that dropped from the run. Who cares about rogue that comes only for the specific melee physical dps items, you will need all because u can use them, hmmm? 
---
You are exactly what they wanted to protect themselves from. 
---
And now you play victim.
---
Pathetic.
---
The only bis item here is hoj, still nice though

Definition of transmute : to change or alter in form, appearance, or nature and especially to a higher form.

Hey you know what, I've been looking around right now and I can't confirm that the 3 sec internal CD is here.
---
I can confirm that windfury can't proc windfury, but the 3 sec thing seems to be TBC.
---
You can make bags. You can make greens to feed your enchanting profession/alt/convert cloth to higher value before vendoring. You can make resistance gear for other people or your self. You can make a best in slot item that will last you for the next 8+ months of content.
---
Ha! That ended up quite a journey for you. Thank you so much for taking the time. I know it's taken me a while to respond but I was overwhelmed by the response for a bit.
---
Truly, thank you!
---
If you tap to 20% hp and I have my guaranteed crit, I will Push my hps thank you very much.
---
Hard to get a mount 4s at a time, but you do you
---
I find playing without focus target more fun tbh. Now I use alot of mouseover macros to make up for it and I think it fits wow better.
---
But thats personal.
---
Neutral AH :O?
---
Sucks when modern WoW players only look at logs. Just makes for very boring and sterile runs.
---
Phase 1 content is cake anyway, you could 20 man MC/Ony easily every week
---
Bodypull as many mobs as you can into their AoE, if you time it right you'll kill the mage and hopefully your quest mob survives.

You're a good grandson. I'm sure he really appreciates it

Es ist beeindruckend, dass Sie diesen Screenshot zehn Jahre lang aufbewahrt haben.

as a rouge i need to back this up.

You also get wrecked by guards if you ress someone they had aggro on... even if you ress someone who got killed by a player and didn't fight back. Guard rules are all kind of weird
---
&gt; Alright what are you doing fo Future Phases
---
I have mats for 50-100 greater nature resistance potions, greater frost resistance potions and greater shadow resistance potions in bank.

So, i think i have a leg up on those.
---
You know how long it takes to walk from the auction to the mailbox on foot, but you probably have no idea how many "yards" it is.
---
Just popping in to say MC is one if the most powerful ccs as it can guarantee a trash mob to die while chunking another and even providing obscene buffs. (Bloodlust to your fury warr anyone?) Also shackle has its place. And for aoe for little trash mobs like bugs in lbrs and spiders aye, throw us in the trash. But 4-5 elite pulls that let us multi dot puts us right next to a mage spamming AE and CoC.
---
But the gear thing is a solid point. Other healers are wary of spriests that can justify taking either type of gear. I heal and just hope for dps drops the party doesnt need ohoh.
---
fuck your greed
---
No it isn't, even with imp VW it still sucks on classic.  On pservers, sure, imp vw fixed agro but not on classic.

It's also stupid good for cat form because it's a flat 2% proc rate and druids have a 1.0 attack speed.
---
Thank you! Please don't mistake me taking a bit to say it for me not meaning it. I appreciate it!
---
Oh no, what ever should people do against this 3 second, very obvious cast. Pro tip: Every single class can counter it at least on the first try (not even counting items). 
---
Yes I hate the spell too, but if priests can pull it off they earned it, so it's fine in my book.
---
If you're not having agro problems with the VW then you're not doing good damage to the target - which in itself is a misplay.
---
Had this dood who joined guild and wanted to ask how to switch from Guild Chat channel back to General Chat. Some guildie said "/gquit" and i wasnt expecting him to actually try it (but he did) and left the guild.
---
We invited him back and he cussed us out before laughing...
---
Triggered by a joke? Christ.
---
I did rfc at lvl 15 with a friend, me healing as a druid. He tanking as a shaman. Went really easy with Thorns, Mark of The Wild and Stoneskin Totem. we used leatherworking for armor and gear, and alchemy for like 5 buffs and hp/mana pots
---
There is an auction house in booty bay close to the bank (and maybe gadgetzan, not sure that was in at the time) that is cross faction. Takes a higher cut of the profit, but you can post stuff there as horde for alliance to buy and vice versa.
---
13 agi is nowhere near 1% crit
---
I mean, the loot argument isnt strong because spriest will roll on both, healing and dps gear, right?
---
As a loyal member of the Alliance I ask all members on the Horde to take up action against the Alliance of Faerlina until Royson deletes his twitter account and on stream donates 1000g, not 400g, to the guild 7.
---
They're on when you're on, therefore botters?
---
If you have to manage it, then that means you're not doing good damage and you'll level slower.  It's like yeah, sure, he'll hold agro if you just barely do any damage to the mob - and it'll take you twice as long to kill as if you went imp -&gt; succ instead of VW.
---
I tought Who was the tank, but he is the Hunter? Now I'm confused.
---
Absolutely not. Typing a title on your phone already takes more time than posting via web reddit, and the copy paste after winshifts is a single button press.
---
Druid's the only class I can stand to grind on because you get into a nice rhythem and then suddenly it's been 2 hours and you're out of inventory space.
---
Contrast with most other classes where you have to stop and eat/drink/bandage every few mobs.
---
It's not a free pass. It's just during a very specific time that happens maybe every 5 levels? (Escort quests are not that common, so far) because of very specific a-holes. It's basically the equivalent of someone trampling over a child's sandcastle, just because they can.
---
beautiful
---
then you're not doing enough damage.
---
Thank you! It took me a while to get over the initial response and start thanking people individually but I appreciate it. You took the time to not just go there but to go through extra trouble explicitly to do so. That's awesome!
---
It's much worse than the standard cold blood/preparation build, but if you pick improved sprint, less CD on evasion/sprint and improved kick you'll have a bit of an easier time against the harder classes such as mage.

Problem is, if no rules are made clear beforehand. There are no rules.
---
Had that once with a friend. Us 2 lvl 20ishs against a lvl 60 Priest.
---
We hid inside the boat but he still found us, and from then on it was a battle of whether or not we managed to get a fear or sheep off, before he managed to MC one of us off the boat.
---
The closest my char got was literally one step off the edge before my friend finally hit the sheep.
---
Fun times.
---
Thank you. I'm slow in saying it but I mean it. It's really cool that you took the time to do this.
---
What the fuck are tatertots.  Sounds like some stupid american shit.
---
&gt; It’s not really hurting you
---
I thought this thread was pretty funny, but I disagree with this. Wasting an hour of someone's time by knocking them off over and over, especially if that's someone who only gets, say, an hour after work to play? That actually hurts worse than getting ganked and moving on.
---
When the huge ass crab you are fighting dodges the attack, you overpower and still miss the huge ass crab, meanwhile the crab is somehow hitting your tiny gnome body 100% of the time
---
Like I said, I don't mind the PvP in general - but if you condemn someone basically stomping on a child's sandcastle just because they can, you might just be one of those people I detest.
---
Daaamn i didnt know that :D
---
ah yeah i agree with this too to an extent. i do think there is a reason you can’t hide things on other players in a lot of mmos and it’s mostly because of the RPG aspect and people wanting to distinguish their characters but i think it would be fair to have an option to just see the gear the player actually has on. 
---
seems like a no brainer to me.
---
Any you’re probably the rogue in the group lol
---
You do you!
---
I don't think so. Would they just give away the first level of the expansion?
---
&gt;you are paladin
---
“In the year 252525...”
---
But questing alone, wont get you to 60.
---
Grinding is an essential part of lvling up. 
---
Hordes just needs to be less pussies, and try pick a fair fight.
---
Im saying there is a "Less" chance of seeing rogues in SM as all the Cleavetards are out in force
---
It took 3 times around to realise it was on loop and not mage doing this EVERY pull on repeat like I witness in game 😁
---
As a 60 healer in dungeons the dps go oom more than i do. 
---
I get more than enough chances to drink and could be spending those points on much better talents.
---
Heh, you'd be surprised how many of the new players don't know about shit like autorun, mouserun, etc.
---
It is and always was. But only if rules are stated and agreed in group chat. (edited my post) But thats not the case for Boes ofcourse.
---
Schadenfreude.
---
If you don't like the appearance of the character then reroll it's better playing with a race you enjoy then having something you dislike in the back of your mind

Idk, the last person to ninja need on me was a friggin mage.

Thank you! I'm sure where ever he may be he is having a damn good time and probably having a laugh at me for being so sentimental, haha.

Actually it’s the mage’s fault he died... spotted the mage, I guess...

---
Is this considered rude? When I’m levelling my enchanting or tailoring I’ll usually randomly gift throwaway wands/cloth armour to low levels who look like they need it. They always say thank you but now I’m a little worried I’m being obnoxiously intrusive...
---
Does it stop the running  if the mob has already started running away?
---
Why the hell does this makes me emotional?
---
Had a strat undead group with a warlock yesterday who kept running in and hellfiring 0.2 sec after the tank pulled a pack.  First time he did it I bopped him and all was well.  Second time, bop was on cooldown from the first time and he died.  He died another 4 times from this until he learnt that agro + hellfire + bop on cooldown = dead lock.

 Silence-&gt;Fear-&gt;MC. Its unlucky but we priests have quite the tools to be douchebags.
---
My god I didn't think of that at all 😀 I would have really looked like absolute troll. Good point.
---
Oh nice that sounds pretty solid.
---
You male gold for your 60 epic mount.
---
You save gold for tour 40 mount.
---
Dont buy proffeccion recipes you dont need, dont levelup abilities you dont use, dont buy stuff from the AH early on etc.
---
But you are already at 50 gold. You could farm some emerald whelping if you have skinning mining or herb. That is a decent farming spot if you sell the red venom sack thingies on the AH. Also a pet can drop there with is 30-50g but it does not sell fast. Undercut and spam trade channel to sell it.
---
Goodluck
---
Yeah they will turn around and run back.
---
This is probably why so many people spam Trade looking to bulk buy cloth for a very specific price through CoD. They just craft it into pure profit. 
---
Why haven't I been doing this...
---
Never to late to reroll!
---
Shaman obviously, 12 years on retail does that to you. Argument stands though.
---
What else do you want me to do with that passive aggression? Eat them?
---
Right side is wank side, got it :D
---
You willing to try it?
---
Doesn't matter if he ninjas 500g. It can easily cover his rename/migration costs and still he'll be in profit :D
---
Future-proof is fishing/herbalism/alchemy.

Skinning only if you get the dagger from The Beast and you would be able to skin The Beast/Onyxia/MC doggies... still herb/alch is better ;)

You'd have a point if they had ever put effort into gear pre-transmog.
---
I;m thinking about thos gleams
---
What talents are you running when dual wield tanking at zf level? Every time i see this topic discussed it's for level 60s, so they have access to some defensive protection talents, as well as defiance. I'm wondering if respeccing to fury will be beneficial for tanking. I'm level 47  running arms build, but I haven't gotten any new two hander since whirlwind, so I'm thinking fury with thrash blade and a shield might be better?
---
Sure. Couldn't care less.
---
The damage ok if you use mindblast, but then you run out of mana in ~2 minutes and generate tons of threat even with all the reduction talents. More importantly, spriests use 2 debuff slots at a bare minimum, and 3 if you want to use shadow word pain. Why bother when you can bring a mage that does more dmg with 1 button and has great aoe to boot.
---
The only point is shadow weaving buff for warlocks, which becomes worthwhile with 4+ warlocks in raid.
---
What level should I spec resto shaman and buy/need on healing gear. I am 49
---
Clathic
---
Proc is confirmed  working for feral in form
---
Robes will be replaced, and you can raid successfully without them. Mount won't.
---
6 mains and 14 alts with 3 hours to play almost every day!

Dunno...

I thank you selfless crusaders.
---
But not the cheeky sods buying all the pages on the cheap and then reselling them at 500% the price,  fuck those guy. Darkdreamer or whatever your name is on Skullflame horde - I hope you run a dungeon 40 times without getting the specific loot piece you want.
---
Pet attack to mouse scroll up, pet passive to mouse scroll down. Great control at all times.
---
Mount hands down your increased speed will increase efficiency and cause to make gold faster
---
So everyone should roll on a BoE that vends for 1g and will auction for 2g?
---
It shows the tool tip of the spell when you hover over it on your bars with your mouse cursor. If you don't include it in the macro and just type /cast Corruption, the macro on your bar will only show the name of the macro when you hover over it. It just more convenient, doesn't affect the functionality.
---
its quite easy to see check. you can see your exact crit chance in your spellbook.  
---
this crit chance even factors in lvl of the target and weapon skill.
---
take any warrior below 60 and add 20agi. see how much crit the warrior gains.
---
you can also see your crit chance go down if you level up although you gained some agi.  
---
if the factor was constant all the time this would not happen.
---
You know...backups. :)
---
And at the same time she would be allowing China India and Pakistan to continue playing wow as they always have
---
Cikex13 spit on you.
---
That mail has been waiting to be read for a long ass time
---
Iirc mouseover that we have right now in Classic didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
If you are both in pre bis gear you will do more dmg single target than a fury warrior even if you play bad.  
---
And yes I agree with you it is a dick move. I knew looting in classic would become a shit show from the start.
---
Hybrid classes are biggest pain tho, "I need for healing!", "I need for feral!", "I need for Tanking!", "I need for enh", "I need for elemental!". Then proceeds to sell to vendor...Gotta get that epic mount.
---
After a certain lvl (55-60) you should have picked main spec and then that's what you play in grp's and what you roll for. If no one else needs the item, then fine roll for offspec.
---
only way to beat the ninja is to be the ninja.
---
Could be one of those people that refused to buy into it, thinking it was just another way for the government to track you.
---
Because we can, good luck beating an orc woman.
---
As I’ve been levelling a warlock I disagree with your statement to virtually every class quest.
---
I had a swim from Theramore to Ratchet at level 20, had to knock down some centaurs in Thousand Needles at level 30, and fight the horde at Southshore.
---
On the bright side I got Booty Bay flight path early I suppose.
---
I’ll just say that running through the Barrens as a level 20 gnome isn’t that much fun to be honest.
---
No matter what is people's opinions on health funnel is, the real wastes are:
---
* Curse of recklessness over rank 1.
---
 The main point is the "not flee" or fear yo-yoing. Not the armor reduction later ranks.
---
* Curse of elements.
---
 While leveling it's waste, you should be using curse of agony
---
* Detect invisibility (and greater, lesser maybe ok).
---
 Mages don't have invis (it was in BC) and there is literally **one** mob you use it for.. in stratholme (eye of naxx). In PvP you'd use it for people using invis potion(rare) and locks with succ.
---
* Drain soul over rank 1. 
---
You use it to get shards, not damage. You probably don't ever cast it over 3 seconds (the dmg tick).
---
* Firestone and Spellstone
---
Unless you really want the miniscule critical rating (or fire dmg) and replacement to offhand.
---
After having leveled a lock 1-60 in classic already, I can say from my own experience that CoR is something that I and many people don’t pick up while leveling because it just isn’t a spell we use. Even for a majority of dungeons, mobs die fast enough that having a dot in place of CoR is preferred. Exceptions are low dps groups that just can’t deal with killing low hp mobs within a few feet of them fleeing, or BRD and higher dungeons, since humanoid mobs start becoming very condensed. 
---
It’s only about 20 silver to buy rank 1 of CoR, but locks (like most people) will only buy skills they need for solo questing. Not because we need it for mounts.. but because everything in classic costs money. Gear upgrades, leveling your professions, upgrading your bags.. etc. Warlocks just get to have priorities over paying for a mount.
---
Or he will send all gold to his alt and group with you again without you knowing it! :D

How is that even possible?

Depends very much on the server and on demand.

Could you explain where/how? I'm pretty new with Auctioneer and am trying all the little quirks out.
---
Can you explain more in detail. What’s really the problem? Only that they won’t wait in queues? And what did you do to try to save it?
---
Maybe. Or maybe he'll sell his gold to his friend's wife, gets a bottle of expensive whine, throws it all in the ocean and poops copper while whistling the tune of Ironforge and shooting pink butterflies out of his ears.
---
Here you go:  [https://imgur.com/a/7LryUqJ](https://imgur.com/a/7LryUqJ)
---
Yea as pointed out and indicated in your edit, I'd say this was added in later too. I've had back-to-back WFs when hitting faster with Flurry or using SS after my first auto which procced windfury, deleting a mob more or less instantaneously.
---
Pot kettle black.
---
The robes are about 85 gold on my server...
---
Epic mount is not a priority, it's something you get when you have everything else you want to buy.
---
That’s the recipe, the matts cost a lot
---
So far questing, I've had horde square up once, the rest of the time, they attack when were killing mobs, or they call the higher level friends lol. But I enjoy it. We usually beat them
---
I'm not sure but I think you might be right. There were mouseover addons for friendly unit frames like healbot but not for enemies on your screen.
---
This isnt a raid though
---
the one on the left is doing the le happy merchant pose
---
Shadow power. you gain health based on the damage your drain life does. So +healing doesn't affect it.
---
Because healers never reserve loot? lol
---
1 Main (Hunter - 32) and 1 Alt (Warlock - 16)
---
Tbf it's toxic af to call everyone "retail" and imply they cant possibly play classic if they think something is tedious or unhelpful. Its blind fanboyism to pretend this isn't a flawed version of the game that could use some polishing.
---
Osrs has tons of qol updates to remove unworkable/monotonous aspects of play. This should be no different. I think theres stuff that needs changing too, no auto dismount on cast etc.
---
Okay, loved this because I'm a big fan of Bioshock but then saw your name and loved it even more &lt;3
---
According to the guidline from 2010 (which hasn't been revoked or changed since), the group leader just have to state the rules. Agreement is done by, well, running with the group. 
---
If you set up Master Loot right at the start of the raid or dungeon, before any boss was killed, and loot everythign by yourself, you can pretty much take all the loot you wanted or distribute it like you feel about it, since everybody agreed on the master loot by staying in the group, and no further loot distribution rules were made (at least this was what a GM told me once). If loot is FFA and you take everything from a boss, Blizz won't do anything either.
---
There is a difference between PvP and someone stepping on an ant... there is no way for the ant to fight back or escape and it can literally ruin gameplay. It's not just 5 minutes of running back to your corpse.
---
Im on NA, and still going hard on my main. Sounds fun though
---
There's far more groups looking for damage than for healers at 60. At least on my server, but I don't see why it would be different on others.
---
I was saying that the Horde has easy access to all of the class quests, because they do.
---
Hahah that is me taking the drink!
---
Or he's going to college later, or he's known her since before they started officially dating, or he's making shit up to stroke his epeen.
---
How much did either of you pay for your runecloth? I got mine at an average of 1.25g/stack or so, but it usually sold at around 1.4g/stack.
---
It's valid for regular groups, too.
---
Tailoring has (or will get in later phases) some very nice pieces that only they can craft and wear, as the item is BoP and binds to the tailor when created. 
---
Not sure how lucrative leveling with bags is now, but at least the first weeks any tailors who leveled fast enough could get really good markup on selling bags - probably not quite as good gold anymore but should still be profitable, although this will depend on your realm.
---
Not druid only, but it's a zone for them specifically. A Maraudon quest takes everyone there at least once.
---
Cat is easier to say lol
---
Well that just isn't true. Plenty of petty fragile ragers existed in Vanilla. Just because you don't remember, or never ran across, them doesn't mean they weren't around.

Level on stalagg/skeram alliance, get better loot, transfer to faerlina/herod and crush late game. Nice idea but doesn't work sadly \[plus it would require a ton of work for blizz and #nochanges\].
---
Ahh cool, didn't know that. Thanks
---
Haha I first thought I was the priest in this group, the exact same thing happened me some days ago..
---
My alt is now my main due to a massive influx of priests on day 1 and a lack of rogues on Westfall.
---
Agreed. I like to stand in the corner and kill the enemy faction and often it takes over 5 minutes before they release their spirit. That means they are not sitting at their computers.
---
Which it is...?
---
So its wow for people that don't want to spend time playing wow?
---
Which is a boon of being Shadow, you can fill both roles quite comfortably assuming you have a backup pair of healing gear.
---
Elvui highlights the class colour of a character name, Op is a mage called spellcleave, hence its blue.
---
You can skin the devilsaurs in ungoro, that sells very well but is fierce competition.
---
Me trying to find the new dungeon in my questing zone
---
IDK about shaman but I'm going holy at 53 since that's a good level to start running brd, which has a lot of good pre-raid gear I need anyway.
---
They can retaliate. Work out how.

Blizzard broke the census addon functionality weeks ago. If you're going off of  [https://wowpop.appspot.com](https://wowpop.appspot.com/), they rely on census addon data and focus on 'active' players. Don't think that data is reliable at all currently, best to use an old snapshot of it found here:

Honestly bud, you sound like a bit of an immature bellend. What if he’s struggling to have kids? What if there are fertility problems or mental health issues with him or his partner whereby they’re slowing things down? Get some appreciation of other people’s situations - some empathy. And grow up.
---
Damn some people need to learn to read in these comments, gz man.
---
The movespeed does seem to be a huge upgrade considering how much time is spent traveling
---
Depends, if you mean to level only in dungeons you could respec already, but if you are questing I would wait until 55-58 atleast.
---
U will still be avle to raid in a pvp spec just not high end speed run raiding
---
I'm in this clip and I don't like it :c
---
how would this ever work, claw will not go off if you're targeting yourself
---
Paladin ... Soloing... Instances... damn what dope did you smoke? :D
---
Bc it's easier to find groups as a healer and the gear is somewhat similar. Endgame pve forces priests into healing anyway, but shadow is the best leveling spec. People don't want to change to group play oriented specs that slow down solo leveling.
---
I am leveling an Enhancement Shaman and have healed every instance up to (and including) Maraudon with zero healing talents. Having a full set of +int/spirit/mp5/heal gear is perfectly okay and enough to heal - even if your tank is a warrior without shield - as long as everyone knows what they are doing.
---
As a healer, you can also join dungeons a few levels earlier because you dont have the problem of trying to dmg enemies 3-5 lvls above you - no resist/evade/parry bullshit when you just pump out green numbers.
---
if you're looking for something cheap you might be sacrificing a graphics card for a laptop. Luckily the demand for classic aren't huge, but as well the new Ryzen 3 3200G processors have some graphics processing built in which helps when gaming.
---
N I C E D A M A G E
---
Did this afflict your leveling?
---
Well we're talking about the game right? this whole subbreddit is about the game.
---
Using the definition my lvl 5 can transmute Rough Stone into Rough Sharpening Stone but this is of no help for OP.
---
As he has an higher level toon, he could level alchemy to do the in-game-named transmute and make money with it every few days without leaving Orgrimmar
---
I sometimes wonder if axes were reversed on some graphs because they were designed to be put into textbooks or handbooks for quick reference, and you can fit to a portrait page easier if Time is on the Y-Axis.
---
I think it's entirely reasonable to make time the Y-Axis if you have a good reason like that, and if you are presenting information to an audience who would appreciate it.
---
As another example, I've seen [S-N curves](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/BrittleAluminium320MPa_S-N_Curve.svg) with multiple materials also show Log Time on Y, but that often seems to be that the resolution of the graph requires it.
---
I think because Time is SO often the Independent variable, the familiarity feedback loop of seeing Time on the X-Axis means it actually supercedes the Independent-on-X-Dependent-on-Y rule of thumb that we use in Science because it's just so much more helpful for humans to parse time as a left-to-right progression.
---
At least in cases where you're presenting information for wider distribution. It doesn't matter so much for characteristic curves which are used for highly technical applications.
---
Noob question about layering: If I stand in a spot where a mob always spawns at but its currently not there then get into a group for layering, there is a chance that the mob suddenly appears next to me?
---
Nope. Its exactly like clicking the logout button.
---
And so now, 25 years later they decided to compromise their safety just so they can play a video game that was originally released 15 years ago? Seems plausible.
---
Yesterday in ST we got the Epic BoE ring for frost mages drop, and we all greeded to give the item for our only mage. He did equip the ring after he won the need and was super gratefull for the rest of the group. Made my day :)
---
Go take your level 60 and gank some 20's in Westfall. Show them what manly man PvP is about!
---
Hunters finally gets it
---
This is what they did in bfa and it
---
1. Didn't help
---
2. Just fucked everything up royally on rp servers giving the majority faction the buff.
---
Hi, /u/Swobodny
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dc7pzx/sunset_over_desolace_such_a_beautiful_15_years/). 
---
So should the alliance
---
I mean, in theory it would predicate Claw on whatever im attacking be targeting me. Not me targeting me.
---
What is even the highest rank of water both conjured and purchased?
---
It shuts my game down. I have to startup battlenet to get back in.
---
You seem upset.
---
It's not even that I want them to look more human. Gnomes, Night Elves and Dwarves all don't have any features showing through the gear and they're still perfectly distinguishable from humans. I still want to play a Troll but I don't want my feet to stick out the bottom of my boots!
---
Again, your mistake is to think that pvp servers somehow are only for fair pvp?
---
Pvp is pvp. Always. That’s what makes it interesting. You can get screwed always not matter if 20 lvl 60 guys kill a single lvl 5 while he’s on an escort q. Pvp is pvp and once you start watering it down with „if“ and „when“ it won’t be the same.
---
I ran into the same problem as you did, couldnt find a good 2hander after rockpunder so i respecced at 48 and went full fury with only a few points in arms for stancedancing with tactical mastery, using thrash blade(mara quest) and sangthraze(zf drop) rn
---
Yea like the others pointed out, everytime you did a concussive shot you reset the leash
---
If you wing clip it and run away you will drop aggro nearly immediately
---
Nobody like having their quest ruined. But look at it this way: You get some friends to help you, and kill them if they try. Then they might come back with their own friends, and so you ask for more help in chat. Next thing you know you have started a open world war. These social and dynamic events is why everyone wanted classic back. Getting frustrated and making enemies is what makes this world alive.
---
It's those damn grandchildren, trying to get them to get into their interests!
---
You can by his hp numbers.
---
Can make the best robes you'll be able to get for a while and can drop tailoring affer you get it.
---
lmao a hunter getting any of that shit LOL. youre the reason we dont inv hunters too dungeons.
---
Cool, they made it work like that for you only. Unique!
---
Robe won’t be replaced until ZG.
---
Get Robe, makes getting mount easier. 
---
Economy is low, robe price may increase. Mount will always be the same price
---
&gt;Calling playing correctly
---
I think the only way you can play a game correctly is if you're having fun playing it. If you have fun min-maxing more power to you but if you have fun playing balance druid then that's also playing the game correctly
---
I was initially so overwhelmed by the response this got that my replies were unfortunately superficial. Thank you for the link. I'm glad that it was helpful for you and I've saved it for myself. I'm sorry to hear about your loss and you are absolutely right about how easy it is to get the wrong impression from what you see in game. The response to this has made me look at everyone I encounter in game in a far more positive light.
---
I can have multiple outputs from 1 keystroke through macros tho.
---
/gquit and /aquit sit on a tree. /aquit falls off, who's left?
---
Its 10% per mob. Its not even that unlikely
---
You could dupe items in the original Diablo by dropping an item on the ground, moving a few steps away, click on the item then click on a potion at same time you picked up the item, the potion would become the item.
---
Is there fishing level zones? Tried In a level 40 area with 0 skill and got none
---
Ugh, stay there, you're fine.
---
I've played on private servers with 200 players on during the weekend. There were 2-3 raids happening at a time at some point. I should say that it was 15x xp so most of the people got to 60 like super fast.
---
Bottom line is, You can really work with even 1k players of your faction online. We're still quite early so not everybody is lv 60 yet.
---
When 20-30% of the server is level 60, you'll have no problem raiding.
---
Sue them!
---
Don’t get mad when people play differently than you
---
Speaking as you're Average Sys admin. There are reasons for this unfortunately. I'm all about you having the tools to do your work / have fun. Viruses even exist in Excel sheets now. :(
---
Saying this, we're totally not using the GPU cluster to multibox our accounts at lunch.
---
You can't have 3 consecutive times the same letter in your name so this story is clearly FAKE
---
The whole concept of this macro would never work anyway because what castsequence does is alternate between the two spells.
---
Macros also cannot do what you're trying to do (which is automating your play). 
---
They can use a specific spell on a mouseover for example or on yourself but not positional or conditional parameters(like stances or stealth).
---
I have a feeling we're on the same server. Blaumeux?
---
he ran before the guy said go (see "already running"). Thus he is out of range for heals
---
And then, when the imbalance has vanished there will be one faction with OP gear because of world drops and low BOE prices on AH.  
---
Maybe balanced in amount of players but it will definitely not be balanced in strength. there are a lot of BoE BiS world drops.  
---
It will possible ruin the AH aswell.
---
It will solve one thing, but other problems rise.
---
Always depends on the one who wants to sell and the recipes you have, but in general id say alchemie, because every class needs pots but not every class needs leather
---
Same for stealth, mages blink or warrior heroic leap in later expansions.
---
Hit 60, follow doing quests (like WPL, EPL, BRD, BRS), do instances - you will get few hundred gold from quests, plus junk and income from runs, plus gear from runs and maybe also the pattern. When you get the pattern you will need those essences and thats where grind starts or few hundred gold on AH ;)
---
for the love of god dont join a "spellcleave" group
---
I liked how he didn't flame you, that crap they hurt was actually really nice of mage to admit a mistake. Well he didn't say sorry i did it, but knowing mage these days, this would do it.
---
*playing mage myself, never apologize.*
---
I guess humor is lost in this subreddit
---
Hell yeah im fucking loving it, just hit lvl 58 on my alt earlier today.
---
As a healer, when I say "go" I expect the tank, whose sole reason to exist is being tanky, to pull. The reason the priest waited before standing up is because tanks can easily take that time to get aggro and not die. The priest said go slightly before he was done drinking to maximize group speed while still getting his mana.
---
Maybe, as others have said, mages pull in that room. But then they should probably use ice block.
---
Can you skin in bear?
---
The only bad part is the pacing. You can know everything about warrior leveling but you cant stop the health problem. You need to eat alot so you’re better off killing just greens and so the leveling is way slower.
---
All the hot air goes into Nathanos....
---
How can alchemy make me money? the potions i can make at the moment dont really make alot of money. i make more money just selling loot, so am i doing something wrong?
---
These rules are so hard to enforce tho, as peoples definition of what is RP enough will be different.
---
&gt;RP-PVP is not RP server
---
But it literally is, regardless of your opinion on it. The RP tag isn't just for show.
---
While most of my interactions on the server have been pleasant, I do find the lack of naming policy enforcement really annoying and immersion-breaking. If people don't want Rp in their game, why the hell did they pick this server out of all the others?
---
epic mount is THE single most important thing to buy. the only thing that will help in whatever activity you do in-game, while spending hundreds for a BoE item which is marginally better than what you can get in dungeons/raids is completely unnecessary to finish any Classic content... other things people spend money on such as pets, no comment
---
came here to say this
---
I have 2 level 32s, priest and rogue, not sure which is main yet
---
Giving to shadow priest prio instead of heahling priest, i hope for your sake they dont change guild lmao :)))
---
Swear this is getting played out already. It was funny 3 weeks ago when we first saw it on the sub.
---
Every day now there’s hero stories about the same thing.
---
/yawn
---
Haha why not?
---
I like this version better
---
Why would a group bring a healer that wants both healing and dps gear when they can get one that would only roll on healing gear? If you were invited as a healer and start rolling on dps gear (unless it is also best for healing), you won't last long.
---
Stonescale eel will probably get a bit more expensive once people start finding flask recipes.
---
I'm in the best Horde guild on Golemagg, I think I'll manage.
---
The editing is making this :D
---
I think the answer to both your gripes is simple.
---
Stop going to STV.
---
If course I tell him beforehand, I wouldn't string someone along for nothing
---
Will this let you put player names in?
---
I would love to be able to put the names of people who have ganked me into it for next time i see them :P
---
&gt; says go  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;still drinking at half mana.
---
That's normal, and good healers do that.
---
The tank can easily pull adds and survive for a few seconds while the priest still drinks for mana. Calling go before you're done drinking lets the group pull again faster, thereby maximizing group speed. And you don't need full mana to heal anyways.
---
But mages can't pull adds and survive while the priest drinks, unless they use ice-block, which I would've expected that mage to use considering he pulled so many adds.
---
WSIPW, my favourite!
---
I’ve been asking questions for a while now, apologies if it gets a little too much! I’m new, and super into it!
---
I’m looking for a class that’s always ‘safe’ to log in to. Something that feels like home. Where you don’t have to try so hard in order to do well. A class that’s just good in what it does. Nice to PvE with, nice to PvP with. Farming some gold here and there, farming some PvP ranks et cetera. Without having to try too hard. 
---
A good, solid main class. 
---
My friends play Alliance, if that helps! Thanks guys!
---
I mean... He does pretty good, and that was before Anathema.

Surprised there are no Greta guilds yet
---
Cookies Party Boat
---
People explain it by "just first-aid lol". Now **THAT is costy** and you can't really bandage in combat as effectively. 
---
One downside on it is that you get massive healing aggro from it.
---
But just use it tbh. Specially if you are new and don't know locks limits time to time.
---
I liked fishing in retail wow, but honestly its so boring in vanilla. In my entire fishing up to 300 I found like one mana pot and otherwise zero rare items.
---
Always do that! Source: I'm a rogue
---
true
---
thanks for example, makes sense
---
Yes that is true. Tbh if you get a group that's happy for you to heal then there won't be an issue
---
Lol this happened to me in MU Online way back in the day
---
Yesterday I did BRD, and both the epic chest off gorosh and hoj dropped... and a hunter won both. Still no sign of my belt though...
---
What? All you have to do is melee a single scarab and run around the pillar while they chain aggro.
---
You’re not wrong but you’re not right. All nearby scarabs will aggro if you hit one - you don’t have to tag each one to get it to hit you as you normally would with a neutral mob. A warrior tank could pull half of the room in less than 10 seconds using just melee attacks.
---
A mage pull also shouldn’t include ice block because then the healer will get aggro. A proper mage pull should include mana shield - which this guy didn’t use, Frost armor - which this guy didn’t use, and blink - which this guy didn’t use.
---
Isn't the raptor in un goro available yet?
---
Yeah, that's not entirely true.
---
Ignore ingame only ignores the hooplehead on character level. That means, if you have an alt you'd have to ignore the player on the alt as as well.
---
If you ignore someone on battlenet, then yes, its account wide.
---
the ToS, Blizzard didn't enforce the ToS on its own server. I signed the ToS, it's the warranty I'll abide by the ToS for Blizzard and the other players but also that these ToS will warrant that I have a gaming experience in conformation with the ToS and protected by the ToS, which is clearly not the case here.
---
That's what I calculate for when I send money to people...either round numbers or all the same or whatever.
---
I did a version of this when I was like 12 except it was /dnd accountname(password) or something like that. Was less obvious with a dnd since you didnt see it yourself. 
---
Damn 12 year old me
---
&gt; They are teabagging my corpse as I write this.
---
 And I couldn't be happier.
---
We don't kink shame here
---
People are missing out on the **multiplayer** part of my comment, I think. 
---
Of course anyone can play anything however they want. I'm not saying the fun they have isn't real. They just **shouldn't expect other people to often want to play with them if they intentionally do sub optimal things in a group environment.** 
---
For example, you can play basketball however you want. If shooting underhand with both hands is fun, I'm sure you can have tons of fun doing it in your backyard. But don't expect to be on the school basketball team, especially if you're unwilling to play the best way.
---
The population cap in vanilla as about 4K people. They have said the current cap is about 5 times that or 20k. Considering many servers had que times it not unreasonable to put server populations in that ballpark of 50k. 
---
I guess we are just having very different experiences. I am still having an easy leveling experience. I would argue more so because I am not fighting everyone for mob spawns.
---
I’d say it’s because the servers are still quite new. Not many people need to buy low level potions, they’re classed as nice to have but far from a necessity. 
---
You’d probably be better off selling the materials used to make those potions on the auction house. Most players will swap professions at level 60, meaning they need to buy/farm materials to level up said profession. 
---
Selling all unwanted loot to a vendor (referred to as vendoring) is good. With skinning, you can skin beasts that have been killed and sell the leather you get from that too. It doesn’t make you too much in the early levels but can prove quite profitable in later levels.
---
TBC
---
Then you would have to do the whole run with master loot even if it's just for 1 item. The way it is works perfectly since you can just report someone if they do what happened to OP.
---
I always buy all the pages before going to STV. Then I just sell everything I get from drops while questing there. I just want that 8k xp straight off the bat.
---
I bought a bunch of shit I don't need and I hit 100 gold at level 41 with just questing. You'll be fine.
---
Theres a necrophagist in wow ?
---
I often accepted such runs, even as a warrior tank when a warrior dps making the group reserved an item I want. It's upfront, I know where i'm going and there's no treachery involved
---
Wow I'm seeing a lot of passive aggression in this thread. Do people actually hate RP this much? Why does it bother you?
---
Reroll. You can use the gold you've made on him to give an alt leveling gear / consumables and it'll go by waaaay faster the second time around. And if, while leveling, you think ahh fuck it idc that much just hop back on your orc. It's a game, do what's fun.
---
Hunter redemption arc is complete
---
Nice timing
---
Yikes dude.
---
Did you... did you just post a list of quotes of yourself to show everyone how funny you are?
---
High level potions are necessary for raid and end game dungeons, also potion you make into expert and artisan will be highly sought after, also the herbs you gather in higher zones will be able to be sold easily on the AH
---
As a druid we also have that sweet  prowl. Lured more than a few over eager horde into skirmishes with it.
---
Last night I spent a good while of time haunting the burnt down inn on the edge of Barrens. Just sat perched up on the hill above it while shadowmelded yelling gibberish at any horde that came by.
---
That was barely any scarabs - all non-elites. He didn’t play this well at all.
---
Spiders in Swamp of Sorrows are very valuable, especially if you also have cooking. They also range from (I believe) levels 36 or so all the way up to 42
---
&lt; is for flying
---
Ctrl &lt; is for ground
---
Shift &lt; is for transmog yak
---
( Alt &lt; was for water striding )
---
I haven't gotten my mount in classic yet (I'm a poor ass 43 hunter, so I don't mind, and actually think I'll want the mount on my mage first), but I know I'll place the mount on &lt; :)
---
Oh yeah! I forgot all about that. Gotta do me some uldaman runs. Even at 60 this item is great for pvp.
---
Okay so you're an experienced insurer. That wasn't really my main point. 
---
And I'm not sure why you're saying you didn't link it. The point of my comment from the beginning was that it doesn't really matter if you linked it or no because you're still perpetuating the idea. It's not hard open a new tab and type two keywords.
---
What a sad country you live in without tater tots
---
Alt+F4 story here. 
---
My friend used to play Guild Wars 1 in 2006 (bc wow sub was too much) and after i visited him, totally fell in love with the game. (imo still the 2nd best mmo ever made)   
---
Needless to stay i wanted to play the game so i went to the local game store but only collectors edition was available.. it was a tough choice but the game looked so nice, i bought it.
---
The collectors edition came with an ingame effect, you hands were glowing during /dance or any other emotes. 
---
One day we were playing arena with my friend and during waiting for matchmaking i started to /dance. One random guy showed up and asked me how to get the glowing effect. I told him to press alt and f4.
---
We were speaking on skype with my friend and there was silence after i replied... we were waiting. After like 3 sec the guy disappeared and we burst out laughing.
---
Still one of my favourite trolling moment.
---
I have a similar monitor and it's awesome. I never play WoW in fullscreen mode though, just keep it windowed in 2560x1440 resolution, then I can watch/google/do whatever on the other half as I play.
---
When you mine notes they can only give minerals.  Chests can give you BoEs. Thats why almost no one rolls on mine/herb and skinning but roll on chests
---
"uncontested"
---
Vaping priest check-in!
---
This is why I go inside the DS corpse, put down a freezing trap and then go for looting and skinning it. Trap is invisible from outside the corpse and rogues/warriors love to step in them
---
A 3 man party can run those for 5 runs a hour. Did this to farm Hojs for warrior and rogue with me healing on paladin.
---
You won't make much money off it till later on but things like transmuting will bank you good profit with 0 input but can only do it every couple of days iirc but also things like flasks when you get to them are a requirement for most raid groups so will make decent amount off them as well eventually but alchemy, blacksmithing and 
---
 leatherworking don't really come into their own until later in the game when you get some nice recipies
---
Warlock, u can pve and pvp with DS/Ruin just fine, u can solo mara with, not as easy as a hunter but still. Warlocks become beasts towards the end of Vanilla.
---
Damn im gonna roll a Warlock!
---
Most professions in the beginning will drain your money gaining but will greatly repay you in gold and or loot when you get the above 250
---
Yeah, and the print screen button takes a screenshot!
---
I got someone who asked how to leave group by telling him to /gquit. He did it.
---
That would've been something if afterwards he said 'wtf heals??'
---
Good luck, let us know how much they pay you in the lawsuit!
---
what's your damage font ? looks good  [https://imgur.com/a/0IbcdmF](https://imgur.com/a/0IbcdmF)
---
Simple answer is you cant and should just spec into it if you want to aoe
---
At least we have straight backs!
---
I generally don't tank for gorups which lock an item I still need or want (because, basically, I can find a group for any dungeon without a lock fairly easy). 
---
But yes, communication is the key. Tell the people what you are all up to, and everything is fine.
---
Found the mage.
---
Wow you must be new on earth
---
I totally agree and didn’t buy the highest rank gouge and kick while leveling.. but there were a few times I’d get fucked and the mob ended up surviving at like 1-2% and couldn’t help but think about upgrading lol.
---
Is Improved drain life worth it? It really doesn't seem to make much of a difference for 5 points. I am draintanking currently.
---
(I know Dive says to get it)
---
I think a lot of people know the difference between roughly 30, 45, and 60 yards, honestly.  It’s natural to have a feel for if you’re regularly using ranged spells or attacks.
---
Just in case you didn't know, you can use distract while not in stealth too. Great to stop patrols in dungeons
---
What i imagined when clicking this post was that some crazy mofo had made an complete ui made with only weakauras. Unit frames, action bar, damage/healing numbers, chat window, quest tracker. Everything.

Hey, I remember him from that video about the scarab lord questline.

Thanks for the tips I’ll get started
---
Just hit lv 22 and until I read this... I hadn't picked up any abilities in other trees since i made this character...! Tanked a dungeon frantically swapping to battle stance for mocking blow taunt and thunderclap, little did i know I was supposed to also have demo shout, higher tier spells, shield block, shield bash and revenge...oops!
---
I asked this late last night so I figure I repost it today:
---
I’m new to Wow and I’m enjoying classic. I’m a human warrior, lvl 34, and I like to clear an areas quest line before moving onto the next area. I’m not following a guide to level efficiently, nor in a rush.
---
To my question, are there any quests I should accomplish along the way that most warriors deem a “must do”? 
---
I did get my whirlwind axe last level and that was worth the journey.
---
Naah. I have seen multiple on the AH between 350-450 so 400 is alright 😃
---
I have one main with multiple personalities. Sometimes he is a...
---
23 Priest or
---
18 Warrior or
---
14 Druid or
---
12 Paladin 
---
and most recently a 6 Warlock has emerged.

And thats how it should be. Unfortunately, we have dishonest people in Classic. So I'm working on a set of rules I can post at the start of a PUG stating
---
* NEED roles on alle BOE items / plans/recipies/patterns/schematics
---
* NEED &gt; GREED (for role in group &gt; specc) on BOP items
---
By the last part I mean, if you join as a tank, dont auto roll need on DPS gear, unless no DPS needs it. Same goes for healers rolling on DPS gear, and DPS rolling on healing/tanking gear.
---
Agreed, gnomes produce most of the world's methane emissions, it's why I never stand next to one with a lighted match.
---
That's fine - that just means you can re-bind ASD to skills instead.  You never need to run backwards as opposed to just turning 90 degrees and strafing and you shouldn't be keyboard turning with a and d anyways.  
---
That is my exact setup - I use QWE for movement and 12345RTASDFZX for skills.  Everything in reach of my left hand without moving my hand away from my movement keys.
---
Male nelf shadow priest. Why?
---
This is not the reaction I was expecting. Yikes.
---
This reminds me of rogues, but it's even worse with dual wield. A mob 2 levels below you makes you feel like a god. 2 levels above takes like 1/4 the damage. Don't get me started on rock elementals that are high armor, immune to poison and bleeds. Badlands was a solo nightmare 1-2 levels lower than the mobs.
---
But it is his fault? Left BEFORE he replied go and was out of reach of heals almost immediately. When he asks if he’s ready, he should’ve waited for a response......like how all questions work. Also, should’ve obviously ice blocked way sooner.
---
Be me doing BRD. Two 100 rolls on Black Diamonds (a few silver on our server) last night. Didn’t win a single essence of fire (8-10g).
---
Also the armor pots.
---
Priest.mp4 using renew in levelling gear when stationary
---
No lie, I’ve been farming for this, pretty easy at lvl 60. Today, after maybe 25 attempts over the past 1-2 weeks, the Viking Helm and the Parachute shield both dropped same run. Feelsgoodman. 
---
Side note: Eric always drops a swiftness potion! So even if you go and get locked out after your tries, 30 min max to get locked out, you have a bunch of swiftness pots!
---
The damage sucks but if you have free gold, just upgrade gouge. It's not like it eats more energy per level.
---
Does that work only for you, or do others see how you set it? I never got that. I mean, it'd make sense for it to be seen by others, but the fact it's in settings leads me to believe it's client side only.
---
Not from my experience, simply  because there's very few of them, and whenever i group with one they usually know what they're doing.
---
Actually the only huntard i ever grouped with in classic was in Hinterlands elite area. The guy's pet was pulling half of the place all the time and we just kept wiping until he left, then it went smooth.
---
it's not how it works in my country. it will be blizzard vs the customer association and the french administration (service de la repression des fraudes) that protects its citizens so the money will go to the customer association and the french government.
---
The honor system only entices people to gank and avoid having fair fights. You cant risk to lose if that means less honor per hour. Rather camp flight paths.
---
A most tragic tale.
---
The earlier tiers are some of the coolest, most iconic looking gear in the game. Bloodfang, Netherwind, Judgement, Dreadnaught, Frostfire, Tirisfal, Avatar, etc...  all pre-transmog.
---
The statistics were bad statistics in the first place
---
He doesn't have to learn to strafe with A and D - if hes already used to Q and E strafing he can continue using those and re-bind A, S, and D to skills instead.
---
What tank? ZF is easiest with 4 mages and a priest for GY.
---
Nah, miss me with that cheap american processed food shit.
---
Ok zoomer
---
Im new to WoW as well and I just dinged 50 last night as an orc warrior, so take this with a grain of salt. I liked the master Armorsmith quest. Obviously not required but cool. You can start grinding a bis ring in your mid 40s. But after ww I haven’t done anything that felt must do.
---
It is faster but if the healer and mage are drinking anyway you aren't speeding anything up you are just adding to others' stress. Healers mana is not yours to utilize. If you don't get healed don't cry about it because this argument falls on deaf ears in the instance.
---
assuming that he is on my level.. this is what pvp really is. fair chnaces for both ;)
---
No one on the server is bothered by RP, but there are a few people who have unrealistic expectations of how much RP is going to go on, not everyone is gonna take it as seriously as they do.
---
Just report the egregious names and move on, you cant sue blizzard because other people are not in to RP as much as you are.
---
These kind of posts should qualify as low effort "oh look another guy who sold something on AH for 69g4s20c HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA SO FUNNY"
---
Hi, I'm a prot warrior, and Im looking for some bis lists for the various phases, both for fury prot and just in general tps gear as a tank. I tried googling, but somehow came up short.
---
I mean, the guy is German..
---
Sure, but he didn't ask for that in the Macro. The Only thing the macro is supposed to do is check wether the target of the target is the player himself.
---
Discord wasn't a thing when guild rep was implemented in Cataclysm though.
---
Nothing wrong. There's such an abundance of potions and reagents on AH that the prices are super low. And low level potions aren't really in high demand either, except for things like swiftness and free action potion (used in PvP) but even those won't really sell until phase 2. Once you get higher level it will be a bit different, but tbh it's just really helpful to be able to make potions yourself and it's also nice just learning what possobilities exist with potions :)
---
tbh that's the healers fault. He said go and didnt follow the puller
---
I always make 200 water when I log on amd hand it out to every caster I see on my run to FP to start questing
---
Also, Mages, please give food to warriors and rogues! 
---
I often stop and conjure some up for them when i see em soloing
---
For starters don't compare yourself to a Mage. Mage's do insane DPS especially at lower levels. Also your rotation can differ depending on spec. If you're running with affliction like most warlocks then your two main dungeon spells are corruption and Shadow bolt. That said you do have some variety with different situations. 
---
You stated you're using your wand a bit. In that case it kinda sounds like you may be running out of mana on longer fights. even in dungeons you can self manage health and mana with mana tap and drain life. If you take all 5 levels of Improved Drain Life then using mana tap and drain life in between shadow bolt is a more viable option than wanding unless you have a BiS wand that is close to your level. 
---
Curse of agony is best on longer fights but can still be used if you are managing mana well and want to max out dps. Immolate on the other hand is probably your worst mana for dps spell you can get and a waste of a cast on faster fights. Searing pain whilst not being your best spell unless you're Destruction can still help boost a little bit of DPs when the mob is about to die and you don't have enough time to cast shadow bolt. 
---
Also are you calculating your pets Damage as well? mages and rogues don't have pets and they really are part of a warlocks DPS ability. Running with an Imp is the best thing for the group because of the stamina boost but if you want a higher DPS then a Succubus is better. 
---
Do you have a dot timer addon? you need to make sure you can track your dots so they aren't falling off to maximise DPS. i use Nug running which i find useful, especially when you are spreading your dots around.
---
Do lower level potions sell well in the AH?
---
It's not possible to accurately infer mood from text.
---
Or nova so u can just walk away from them. No idea what the guy was doing.
---
I'll play around with it for a bit when i get home because now i'm curious and want to fiddle around with this
---
This, if they opened an RP server and and RP rules exist at least they should keep to it. Oh wait...they fired most of the staff who could enforce this, I am afraid there won't be a solution anytime soon, if any at all.
---
You'll have to take whatever the vendor offers you...
---
The UK has shit food lol
---
Thats why you reserve items.
---
What you are saying is how it worked on various private servers. It does not work that way on Classic. Get a paladin to HoJ you over and over for an hour and count the number of resists you get with 1 or 2 fingers.
---
I really like dwarves in those pointy wizard hats, got that gandalf look going on. Unfortunately no dwarf mages in classic, even though they were in beta.
---
You're joking right?
---
Has to actually be humorous to be a joke.
---
Sounds like you want to play mage. Mages are incredibly "safe" to play. While you are bound to play a dps class you won't have problems in soloing content even in raid or pvp specc. You have the utility of providing yourself with water and bread (something that is crucial for most classes) and alot of other things dungeon groups thirst for like bombing (I'm thinking about the first packs in Stratholme), very reliabe cc..    
---
The mage does one thing: Damage, but they do it very very well with a good chunk of utility and support for groups.    
---
The tradeoff probably is that you play a relatively squishy class (you have a lot of utility to solve that problem to a certain degree tho) and you have to "compete" with alot of others for groups and loot in general (since mage is very popular right now and "cloth" classes are really common).
---
He should have blinked rather or nova, no need to waste IB on scarabs.
---
Grats! Side note, I read "summons and dismisses a rideable piano"
---
Are you dual wealding? What lvl are the mobs you are fighting?
---
Cause that is vanilla, it is low weapon skill.
---
This isn't what cat was posing for.
---
Okay, let us know how it goes.
---
I would say only the third is open to interpretation. The first two are pretty self explanatory.
---
Yea i love making potions and gathering the herbs. You said phase 2, what is phase 2?
---
You need 2/3 Imp Blizzard
---
Healing pots are incredibly cheap and make the life of a warrior so much easier. Like 80% of questing deaths can be avoided by having one of those bad boys in reserve, and supply from quests, drops and chests is always a little behind what you would need.
---
For the rest, follow the advice in the other comment. Check the AH for stuff "of the tiger" and "of the bear" (agi+str and stam+str) and buy equipment that is useful (as in, it's a decent upgrade to what your warrior currently has or can easily get through upcoming quests) and is listed barely above vendor price. A 47 mage isn't going to be rich, so I'd stay away from way more expensive blue BoE leveling items, the markup isn't worth it if your gold is limited.
---
The biggest thing is probably getting him the Whirlwind Axe at 30. You can farm the charms on your mage, buy the life root, and find a 45+ willing to help with the summoning for a tip. Then all the warrior has to do is farm 33-34 trolls in Stranglethorn, where you usually can find groups doing those for other quests, so you can just tag along and loot your stuff. That axe can easily last him through to Maraudon at 48+ and makes leveling 30-40 an absolute breeze.
---
Exactly my thoughts! Just started out on my undead guy, feels way better already haha. Shoved in some gold and crafted items for him to wear. This will be interesting! (Not looking forward to the 30-40 grind tho)
---
You say /s but I hope you are aware that they are BiS if you decide to go for Dual Wield weapons.
---
I was in shimmering with my early 30 shaman, kill a basilisk, loot, start to skin, 60 mage one shots me, skins my mob... i have so many questions
---
&gt; But it also floats 
---
To be fair, down here we all float.
---
well said
---
This exactly :D You are like "nah, no honor yet, lets leave him" at start. Then you get ganged while killing multiple mobs or jumped by multiple alliance (im horde side obv) or killed by high level. That turns you into similar mindset = "no mercy" :D And it's snowballing with more and more people :D
---
I soloed princess but it was a bit slow, did not get the ring before a rogue mate joined and the kill speed picked up. To us Angerforge was faster considering we never really got that logout-go-back-to-instance-beginning to work. Granted we could stealth all the way to Angerforge but as we had no problem duo:ing him it would hardly take much longer to go there with a full group.
---
That's why he said "seem".
---
You cant sell it
---
Nah screw it, keep being randomly nice. Randomly giving people stuff is what makes the game fun for me.
---
Yeah, it wasn't working for him for some reason. The base pet attack button just didn't exist and the macro what you wrote didn't work either. I'll have to get him to try turning Addons off or something.
---
Dual wielding comes at the cost of a high miss chance. This can be counteracted with +hit chance talents or gear, and weapon skill. The former is usually only obtained im the endgame though.
---
Additionally, higher level mobs will have even higher chances of doing this.
---
So yeah, it is normal, and will be a part of dual wielding until endgame gear kicks in!
---
Blink and iceblock save lives.
---
Well, for the moment at least.
---
He could have gone bear form after dotting you up, then warstomp-&gt;roots+FF after you used your vanish, heal up to full, and then it's GG
---
Luckily you got hit by a PvE tunneling druid who doesn't know how to play his class yet
---
Many people don't bother because they take up so much precious bag space.  :)
---
No screenshots showing they hadn’t said before hand ring on Rez ? Just your word to go by these witch hunts are getting out of hand
---
Those are some super good points! I hear a lot of people suggesting warlock, too. Would you say they’re close to the same?
---
A fellow rogue asked for some flash powder and wouldn't accept the trade without giving me 30s
---
The community on pve realms. Every single freakin person is so overly polite that i feel like Teletubbies are forcing down sugar coated cakes down my throat when i have to interact with strangers.
---
Layering going bonkers?
---
those scarabs actually hit quite hard on a cloth user although they are non-elites but they don't have that much hp
---
Pls no kill, I am but a friendly rogue.
---
higher level mobs mean greater chance to miss-attack mobs your level, weaponskill, debuff perhaps
---
I got a better solution. 
---
If the faction imbalance is greater than 40/60 all new characters on creation get a "gay if play this faction" warning. 
---
Imbalance rates fall to 0%.
---
No just vendor them, classic wow is brutal in keeping low levels poor. Having a lot of gold at a low level is nearly impossible. As a new player I highly suggest you spend an hour watching YouTube guides on leveling to set yourself up for where you want to be later on. GL new adventurer
---
I lost my innocence playing RuneScape back in 2006/2007. Never really played an online game before so I was excited to make friends.
---
I met this higher level guy and he said we should check out the wilderness and it was scary but he said he’d have my back. We keep going out further and further. We get our far enough until he just kills me and walks off. Never played it again.
---
I haven't gotten to the cleaving levels but I actually find Warrior to be one of the better classes for breaking apart groups of mobs as long as enough of them are melee-ers. Hamstring is cheap and lasts long enough to take down mobs 1 at a time.
---
You are from the UK? Lmao don't talk to me about shit food. Want an unbaked potato?
---
Different layer for the cave
---
also lack of kidney shot
---
 **Deepdive Helmet** from engineering.
---
That's the whole point of the rules is so people don't have differing opinions on the matter from a business standpoint, it's like saying everyone's opinion of work is different I mean sure it is but your employer sets expections for everyone performing the role so opinions are irrelevant here. Guidelines have been breached and something should be done
---
Fyi I play on a standard PvP server and couldn't give 2 shits about rp in wow but I play a lot of dnd and I know how I feel about rp there so understand the concern and/or disruption of immersion expressed
---
You seem to have poor reading comprehension too.
---
As a rogue, you want to get hit as little as possible in order to receive as little dmg as possible, so as to minimize your downtime or deter enemy faction players from attacking you.
---
Obviously, when you are low level and you have 0% +hit, hitting slice and dice and missing, missing, missing, missing, missing, missing, missing is not quite optimal, is it?
---
SnD is for later stages of gear when you have got TOO MUCH +hit. At level 60, I have 310 Wep Skill , 5% hit from talents, 1% from ring, 2% from Truestrike Shoulders and 1% hit from T1 Gloves. I hardly ever miss. Still, I don't use SnD outside dungeons/raids, because I waste combo pts that should go towards 5cp eviscerate.
---
I recommend, Sinister Strike X 3, gouge, eviscerate if combat. In Sub/Asssas, Ambush, sinister strike, gouge, backstab and eviscerate.,
---
Yes i know that pain, but ensuring u always outlevel the zone is a perfect tactic and XPs goes really fast as you dont have so much downtime.
---
i dunno man, thats kinda over the top
---
the rule is if you gona use the item you "need", unless its someones bis while its not yours, at least as far as I know
---
I can see ppl being triggered by the situation you described but there are no alternatives so ppl have to get over it
---
I’m well aware how hard they hit. If he had been using mana shield and frost armor he could’ve pulled twice as much without going down.
---
C.O.D. :)
---
Yeah this is a stupid way of thinking, when I say go it's obvious I'm talking to the tank... and that's not being a dictator, its letting your tank know you're ready.
---
Thank you! :)
---
i dont get it
---
Not sure why people bother with the patterns if they just want to level their tailoring.
---
It's super easy to just buy some other pattern like runecloth boots and use that from 285-300 yea you might spend a few gold extra in mats but that's easy to get back and you don't need to camp a vendor for hours.
---
You'll face a hell lot of competition though if you play a mage. Mage is great in every aspect of the game in vanilla wow and everybody knows it.
---
no it's not difficult and all stated above: no out of character communications in /say and /yell, that leaves all the other channels plus the ones you can create. naming policy is clear too. there's no interpretation in this, it's all clear, no definition needed or feeling or whatever. it's you can do all what you want as long you don't do this and that. period.

Hi, I'm a 53 Warlock and I was leveling with the Affli/Demono spec, and I wanted to know if SM/RUIN was viable to finish my leveling since it's the spec will chose as soon as I hit 60. Thanks!
---
38 Warlock which is kinda retired after 2 weeks of playing and 49 Warrior
---
I never had "alts" - I'm rather changing my main..
---
3/3 is better tbh. 2/3 is fine.
---
I mean it doesn't hurt your single target damage that much when you put 2-3 Points into imp. Blizzard.
---
Otherwise you will have to try and AOE them without Blizzard IMO just CoC and Arcane Explosion with Frost Nova could do it. Or try Flamestrike to begin with and then CoC/Arcane
---
I thought so, but last i opened one, i got it all.
---
&gt; A mage pull also shouldn’t include ice block because then the healer will get aggro
---
Only if the healer has actually done anything. If no one but the Mage has done anything, and aren't in the immediate vicinity, they *should* continue hitting the Mage during Iceblock. 
---
I fully agree that the Mage in the clip clearly had no clue as to how to properly do it.
---
&gt; UBRS, LBRS, both pretty easy but the mobs 60 and above. There's no reason to ever get a non 60 tank there. And the competition is high for gear so people would take the 60 that need less gear over you who need all the gear. 
---
I assume you mean UBRS for that. LBRS is pretty easy unless you want to do Urok and we did it easily with a 56 warrior tanking who didn't know the dungeon. Only the last boss is 60.
---
This is the same for me. On retail it is about the phasing of the session. In classic it is about the layers. 
---
That is in Darkshore and a copper vein too - I have had the same problem. I just ignore it and move on
---
God I miss that band. Haven’t listened to them in a long time... well I know what I’m doing today.
---
I'm leveling as a 2H Arms warrior (lvl32 currently). I decided not to pick up Slam because I don't know where it fits in my rotation and whether it even makes sense to use without the talent for it in Fury. My current rotation is: Charge -&gt; Sweeping strikes (if 2 mobs) -&gt; Rend -&gt; Hamstring Kite -&gt; Heroic Strike spam. It seems to work pretty well. Does slam have a place when leveling a warrior?
---
Is your case "blizzard not enforcing harassment"? I don't see anything specific to roleplaying in their license agreement.
---
perhaps it’s time you respeced to destro
---
Yes. The price listed in the 'Cheaper than' column is the absolute maximum price you should pay for your cloth/leather/meat/metal etc if you want to make any profit. If you pay exactly what is listed, buy the rest of the needed materials at the Revered reputation listed prices, craft that item and then sell it to a vendor, you will break even (give or take a copper or 2 because the calculations use Excels ROUNDDOWN function). The further under that price you can get, the more profit you will make.
---
Silk Bandages for example. Sell to a vendor for 2 silver each or 4 silver for heavy silk so heavy is better purely for a reduced crafting time. If you buy silk cloth at 2s a piece, you can craft a bandage, sell to a vendor and break even. This isn't great for making money but it is great for levelling first aid cheap or free and you can use the same principle for other professions. If you buy it at 1s95c, you will make 5 copper profit per bandage. Doesn't seem like a lot but if you are making a few copper per item and crafting 200-300 items at a time, it soon adds up. I bought out all Mageweave under or at 4 silver a piece and crafted Mageweave Bandages till it turned grey, even though I had the recipe for Heavy Mageweave, because Mageweave Bandages are more profitable. I actually made money levelling my First Aid Skill.
---
The auction add on I have is Auctionator. It scans for your chosen items and then lists them in order of 'price per single unit' regardless of stack size. It may list a stack of 20 items as 'cheaper' than a single  item just because the stack of 20 is say 19s80 (99c a piece), where that single item at 1 silver. It makes it real easy just to go down the list and buy everything under your needed price.
---
Auctionator saves your previous searches but also allows you to create 'Shopping Lists' so I have my items sorted under different lists. I have a list for 'cloth and first aid' which has all the cloth types plus the different sizes of Venom Sacs used to create anti-venoms. I have one for 'leather and hides', one for 'cooking ingredients', one for my 'potions and reagents' (Shaman uses Fish Oil and Shiny Fish Scales for water walking and water breathing). I can then select the shopping list and search for individual items from the list, or search for everything on that list in one go. If I search for my full 'potions and reagents' list, it will show me every single type of healing potion (from those tiny level 1 square ones, right up to the biggest ones available), every type of mana potion, Fish oil and Shiny Fish Scales without having to look for each one seperately.
---
I'm actually not even sure - if that's not default then it's probably ElvUI's default.
---
I mean we will never really know I guess.
---
I start fights with literally no one. Still get gangbanged and ganked about half the time I run into Horde.
---
This guy is still level 20 and never run Zf so he is abit jelly 😂

---
I see your point - a bit picky though? Please refrain from mentioning anything bad in your reply or people might know it exists?
---
Playing the game for 18 hours per day since release tends to make you a very miserable person. Case in point.
---
Wow, Thats something i havent seen in a long time!
---
... Yawning
---
Guess most people here are more used to english/imperial system, but could be wrong.
---
Might be worth to spend some time mining. Iron and mithril are rather expensive at the time. I think iron is 125 and mithril 175
---
I don't think it would work. Really, there's not much to be done if a server has a severe faction imbalance. If they implemented something like this, it still wouldn't be a very strong incentive to completely reroll on a different server, leveling just takes too long.  IMO probably the best things they could do, IF they wanted to interfere, is limit the amount of players online by each faction ie. if its 65/35 horde/alliance horde players get a queue and alliance players wouldn't. AND/OR decide transfers by faction population. ie Skeram, massively horde dominated, can only receive xfers from alliance characters.
---
So basically if i put my character in an inn and leave him there but once a while play him it'll level really fast?
---
I knew dungeon had good random boss drops, but didn’t know they was a main quest that provided a blue. Definitely will check it out, thank you!
---
You know, I can understand some parries. Maybe a staff, a sword if it has some kind of horn or claw.
---
But when I'm wearing a big-ass 2h mace and I swing that bad boy to deliver a Mortal Strike, and some bug successfully parries it, that just makes me go, "Naww..."
---
Yes. You are correct. IF he is not behind the target, the Macro will Fail. Just like Claw usually does. Nothing i said contradicts that, nothing in the original post contradicts that, and nothing in the original Post indicates that he wants to work around that. All that is asked is to use One Ability, or use another If the Target is targetting you. If the Target ISN'T targetting you, you should be standing behind your target anyway, so it can't parry you.
---
Because the slow effect will overwrite coc if you do. They will be slowed more, but for a shorter period of time.
---
Nice data! I found another site a while ago called classicinfo or something along those lines, but i cant find it anymore.
---
Russian servers seem to heavily favor alliance &gt;95% in 2 cases. 
---
Does anybody have an explanation as to why this is?
---
&gt;Without a healer or other form of support, you basically can't fight 2 mobs of your level at once without a heavy chance of dying in the process. 
---
just unbelievably not true.
---
This is the definition of nerd rage.
---
Get over it dude..
---
I'm a level 35 warlock and I have yet to obtain any sort of necklace. If one were to drop that had, let's say stamina (useful) and agility (not so useful), would I be a piece of shit for needing?
---
It's amazing right? :D So basically one shouldn't take any of this personal, it's just how war is in this game. No sympathy for the other faction. Doesn't mean that one has to be an asshole to the opposite faction 24/7, but they can definitely choose to be. WoW is all about consequences though, so people should be aware of how far they go. Like, if you see a hunter taming Brokentooth, and you decide to kill it before his eyes, you will surely land on this hunter's list (and probably everyone he knows, too) until the end of days.
---
Just another point to this - you can actually control the target you cast your Fear on. If the target is running wrong direction, you can curse him with recklessness (Fear will still have its duration active), that will turn it back to the highest aggro target. Then you switch the recklessness with another curse and the target is Feared again.    
---
Despite it's not so effective method (many gcd and some extra mana spent), it can be lifesaver for "oh shit" situations especially in dungeons.
---
I wouldn't use heroic strike, but sunder armor. It is way more rage efficient and you get a lot more OP procs from it
---
^this one. +1 for mount.
---
Tells you a lot about the people that boast then.
---
This one. +1 for mount.
---
Sounds good and will do. I plan on doing the armorsmith quest chain once I get to the minimum level, 35 or 40.
---
Fellow Zandalari here. The first day was pretty fine in so far as names went. But once people caught onto the queues and how we had it pretty easy, it was like the floodgates opened.
---
I think it's still a fairly chill realm insofar as how people treat each other and the lack of malicious PvP... But it certainly doesn't feel like an RP realm.
---
Everyone is to blame here.
---
The mage is moving poorly and not using the right abilities.
---
The healer is being slow despite giving the go ahead.
---
The tank is nowhere to be seen although he should be gathering scarabs with piercing howl.
---
Wasted 10+ hours with rather unsuccessful dungeon runs, but I guess 7-7.5 days played are possible with mostly solo questing and each dungeon once for most quests. Just go through most areas with yellow/green quests. Hinterlands &amp; Un'goro i.e. can be done in one round for 90% of their quests.
---
OP makes useful graph that answers a common question.
---
Top comment and all of the discussion is “but ACKSHUALLY” one-upsmanship trying to look smart by nitpicking half-remembered conventions from high-school stats classes that were only ever simplified rule-of-thumb versions of the actual conventions in the first place. It’s not like the axes aren’t labeled or anything approaching that magnitude.
---
Thanks for the graph, OP.
---
At level 60 they're really not making much money doing that. It costs 20 silver for the reagent every time they make a portal. Surprised they're not just farming dungeons or something.
---
No, you're straight up wrong, healer isn't at fault here at all, all good healers can understand what the tank should be able to survive and when it's safe to give the tank the green light, when a healer says go he means the tank, not a random crazy mage jumping around and taking aggro from so many mobs that no heal in the game can even save him in time, half my dungeon runs I tell the tank he can keep pulling while I'm still drinking because I know the tank can survive those few extra seconds it takes me to get my mana back, but in no time am I ever expecting a dps to go ballistic and literally Try to kill themselves.
---
Alternative is to kick you and find another healer. It is expected that mainspec &gt; offspec unless you state otherwise and the group agrees. Mainspec being the role you're participating in, not your actual talent build.
---
Different calculation for tauren racial (+5% hp) bonus I guess.
---
The main hand attacks are, yes. But any off-hand attacks that occur while a main hand-based yellow attack is queued ought to still be a white attack, and therefore it makes no sense that they'd use the yellow attack formula.
---
I got mind controlled as the boat was leaving and just before load screen they jumped me off the boat, took me 2 minutes to swim back
---
So the mage can create matter from thin air? That would require an absurd level of energy, if we use E=mc^2
---
A note on BoE's.
---
One way of doing it is everyone rolls greed on BoE's *unless* they're going to equip it right away. If you roll need and don't equip it, then you're a ninja and get put on my list of people to not group with ever again.
---
Got to give people a chance to show you what they're all about.
---
This happend to 13 year old me aswell, alltough things went diffrently at the alt+f4 part... at that point I just wrote "fuck you" and left the game.
---
To be honest those scarabs do hit particularly hard, but that mage learnt a tough lesson.
---
I solo'd the whole scarab room on my ZF farms but it was difficult, needed to be pre-bubbled + ice barrier + have mana shield ready as a back up.
---
Spam the fuck out of Frost Nova when all shields are dead and blink away, Ice Block if/when required.
---
HealComm
---
As much as I hate stuff like this. I hate the need to pubilcly post stuff like this, makes me feel like im under constant survellience. Just report it privatley on move on, no need to tell the whole world.
---
I've been fishing in bay of storms for 4+ hours. Where do you fish?
---
Thanks! I'm excited to make one for each class - I just need to learn how all these other classes work, haha
---
&gt; But mages can't pull adds and survive while the priest drinks, unless they use ice-block,
---
Step 1: Drink oil of immolation. Step 2: Shield up (Ice Barrier + Mana Shield). Step 3: Run around willy-nilly aggroing everything nearby with ease. Step 4: Herd the mobs into a tight group. Step 5: Profit!
---
the essence of waters, theres 6 pools in azshara.  as druid its kino because i got aquatic form.  then theres also the extra blackmouth pools and wreckages.
---
Only about not logging in at the right time. Basically woke up with these thoughts in the morning :D
---
I'm in the same situation except that I've already committed and I gotta say it's viable and more fun in dungeons as well. Though I did go with a build that trades amplify curse and CoEx for more drain tanking abilities.
---
Wasn't that added later or an 8 mistaken?
---
Cookie's Cavern
---
I would say that it's worth it imo. 10% increased health + the scaling with spell power means that over long periods you'll be stopping a lot less frequently when levelling.
---
It's more fun for my new friends if they win gear from the dungeon we're running. Taking that away is not worth 2g to me.
---
Yea when your "rested" your xp bar turns blue and killing mobs you get double the xp but from what I know not quest but it only gives so much xp per rest.
---
Pirates in tanaris for sure.
---
I understood that reference.
---
Agreed. Was kinda pissed when I realised how much 4x mage 1x priest worked. Biggest cheese tactic to get me from 44-60.
---
44-52 - ZF
---
52-55 BRD Prison/Arena
---
55-60 Torch Room
---
What is my druid doing wrong then? :/ Also fishing in Adzhara
---
muh immershun
---
Maybe say you’re not ready then. Just because your not at 100% mana doesn’t mean people can’t pull. Make it clear, this dude isn’t even really given you a hard time about not being on top of shit.
---
Completely different gear lineup. The chest (quest reward from Badlands) i.e. has only 2 stamina &amp; 24 strength.
---
Iceblock Nova blink blizzard
---
I thought it was r,t,f,m?
---
A good spellcleave group actually doesn't need a tank. IIRC the popular 'meta' composition is 3 mages, 1 warlock, 1 priest; but i've also heard of 4 mages, 1 priest.
---
Dick move to invite the tank in the first place, though. Everyone going in should agree what they should be aiming for, especially since a run with a tank is quite different from one without.
---
Is this ink or marker? I can see pencil sketch marks underneath here and there, but the black is so strong and consistent that I just must know how? Or am I going to be disappointed and it's just because of the lighting or slight editing.
---
In the lvl up text.
---
I mean, except that your run is still ruined lol
---
Potions, elixirs, weight/sharpening stones, stam food, and scrolls.
---
Consumables can add up in expense, but I think they're worth it. The stones should be super cheap and last you 30 minutes each, for a significant damage boost; more damage, faster kills, less down time, faster levelling.
---
Stam food can be purchased, or if you pick up cooking on your warrior, you'll get plenty of materials on your grind.
---
Scrolls are cool and cheap but limited stock and usually on out of the way vendors.
---
Elixirs are AMAZING, last for an hour, but are lost if you die. Only get elixirs if you're also getting health potions.
---
HEALTH POTIONS HEALTH POTIONS HEALTH POTIONS! If you want to be cheap, keep a stack of level-appropriate potions in your pack for emergencies. If you want to be FAST, chug them while you chain pull, and eat food when potions are on cooldown. At 60, I'm still excited when I find Greater Healing Potions or better. Don't clog your bank or bags, though. Keep stacks in your mailbox and pull them out as-needed.
---
Lastly, bribe money. Buffs are a huge help, but begging doesn't always work. Incentivise that priest or druid with a few silver. LFG doesn't always get that Elite quest done in a timely manner, but "hiring healer for Elite Quest, 20 silver" almost always does.
---
Hunter is right up your alley.
---
Super easy PVE in solo due to your pet tanking so you never take damage, your pet deals half your damage. You can solo elite quests or red mobs even. You also get aspect of the cheetah for 30% (36% with talents at lvl 22) movement speed at lvl 20. You are not gear reliant, you can use gear 20 levels below yours as long as they have +agi/+att power, and your only must upgrade item is your bow/gun/xbow, which up to lvl 30ish can all be bought from weapon vendors.
---
In PVP you are safe from every class but warlocks and priests, and you can basically destroy and melee class such as shaman/rogue/warrior with a concussive shot and rapid fire spam. A fast attack speed pet will make mages never go near you. 
---
Very good at farming, kills enemies fast, you can never have your shots dodged/parried/glance, just miss. You can just stack agi/int gear and farm like a madman. You can even solo farm Maraudon and Dire Maul (P2) to make hella moola.
---
Spellcleave.
---
Make sure to let us know when you get 225-300. Grats on 225.
---
Mage is pretty bad, was able to do this on my mage with a 4x mage 1x priest combo countless times. Mage didn't use ANY utility to help him survive. 
---
A decent mage can pull every single scarab in that room and not die
---
Haven't macroed that much from other stances, could do it and 10+ more bindings would show up.
---
&gt; You consider that an achievement?
---
Do you not?
---
I know, right.
---
The good thing is this can be done from almost no money. I wasn't paying attention and just spam purchased skills from my class trainer and left my self with about 3 silver because I forgot I wasn't playing retail ... I went to the AH and bought strider meat for a few copper each, bought shiny red apples and made some Strider Stew. Sold it back to the vendor for a tiny profit. Went back, bought more Strider Meat, rinse repeat. It was slow going, but it worked.
---
The more money you have, obviously the easier it is to bulk buy stuff, but it absolutely can be done right off the bat with almost no money. I have even seen me use an item in my bag as a deposit to buy materials when I've gone mental in AH and just bought everything and not watched how much I have to buy materials and left myself short. I had to sell 'deposit item' to vendor, use that money to buy materials, craft item, sell item to vendor, buy back original deposit item. Haha.
---
The mouse pad behind you one made me laugh so don't feel bad.
---
This is like the 5th time I've seen this, and I'm sure plenty more that havnt been posted, it's far more common than I atleast thought
---
It took our group's rogue 110 kills to finally get HoJ. Then it dropped on the next run too and went to our warrior tank's OS. RNG gotta RNG.
---
Probably the best plan I have heard yet for rationalizing the avoidance of raids
---
I still remember the guild disband weak auras people uploaded. Those were nasty.
---
And he stood still using Nova so ye big nob
---
Less involved, which means you can watch a show or talk to a lot of ppl. Also let’s you wand, saves mana - drinks - money.
---
I went mining for leveling and sold of everything I mined, farmed mithril a fair amount, got mount at 40.5.
---
I could almost see your point, until you said finding a mage was a pain. I think I've been in one single dungeon group where there wasn't a mage.
---
But what if your interrupt fails?
---
Woah we have a keyboard warrior here. How do you slay those?
---
It must be hard to understand why warriors use leather :) hint: its not for pvp
---
So lets say you have decked out druid with tanking gear, you gona force him to heal if he wants to roll on healing gear?
---
I mean it makes some sense loot wise but other than that its pretty stupid
---
*First time meme*

I dont think there is a global cooldown on amp curse, so it would just be like.

Farming runecloth is faster than trying to quest for rep, though not quite at level 40. Why are you worried about it now, that rep won't do anything for you until 60 (and even then only if you want the ram as non-dwarf).
---
aoe tanking abilities on warriors ... sure ...
---
It's skewed toward horde if you only count PvP servers. It's less relevant for PvE servers because world PvP isn't an issue.
---
I personally haven't had much issues in stv. A lot of fights but most of them have been fun.
---
I saw a video of a hordeguy asking people for help questing in winterspring, and he'd just lure the helper to his alliance priestfriend starting by acliff who would then MC the guy off
---
I enjoy hearing stories so much like this. Im going to give someone who looks like they need it 5g today in hopes that all the do is return the favor for someone else in the future.
---
They do enforce the name one but only after enough reports. And a bit of time. I've kept tabs on a few I've reported, specifying the RP making policy. They do get changed after a few... Weeks, but it happens. Likely faster as more people report them for the same thing.
---
How much was the tip!? I news to know, nobody is asking the important questions
---
I was waiting for my friend to come home from work to continue questing. I honestly don't mind the waiting because I like coding, it's fun. I usually sit in IF when I'm working on it.
---
I had hopes I get runecloth bag pattern to the both of us during that time but... yeah.
---
Definitely go with Robe first - you’ll see a substantial damage increase and less drink time with the use ability.
---
I think I spent about 500-600g for my Robes, I don’t have an epic Mount now, and I probably won’t for awhile. 
---
It’s just not really worth the 40% speed increase for a reduction in damage
---
Found the fire mage in MC.
---
Hey hey us warlocks are just mages with dark humor, not assholes.
---
This is the soul reason im levelling a rogue
---
The snatching tab does that iirc.

It took me a while to get a working version too. I tired a few where /luna command wouldn't work so I couldn't config it. I'm at work atm so I can't check but drop me a PM and I'll have a look when I'm home
---
Silly people, trying to eat on a PVP server.

Because it’s very bad damage. Rather save the rage for mortal strike/OP

---
Everyone else here is trying to help, but why you are so negative? Just because my spec is not AOE focused doesn't mean I can't aoe at all. I am looking for tips how to AOE occasional group mobs and there have to be a way.
---
If you run with a guild then you should be able to arrange it quite easily. Otherwise why would a healer join a run where the tank is rolling on healing gear? It's possible, but you would have to discuss it beforehand and not everyone is going to agree.
---
Most 60 dungeons are ran for specific pieces of gear, and due to how long it can take to get that particular drop, you want as little competition as possible.
---
That is not at all what is going on here lol.
---
Levelled to 60 on countless private servers, the levelling isnt part of the journey for me, it's the end game.
---
I replied to my self maybe you all will see. I just wanna make it a swords.rogue for bgs in phase 3
---
You’re a mage.....
---
Teleporting and Flying are essentially all the traveling you do....
---
You also have blink if you happen to have to walk, 40% is fine
---
&gt;from a horse perspective.
---
Copic or what? Can you achieve that in one go or do you go over the lines a couple times to get it so bold? I love my Sakura markers, but they leave a clear tone difference in between thicker lines.
---
Won't load for me. Do you have an alternate link to check it out?
---
Hunters are the kings of farming gold. They're efficient and chill to boot. It's my honest belief that every single healer should level a hunter just to grind money up at 60.
---
If the Lich King's mount is named Invincible, why can we see it?
---
Im horde though haha. And no worries everyone hates on that invicta guild so its kinda funny!!
---
Omfg...was questing on my warrior in Hillsbrad and this fucking ass clown mage killed Farmer Getz in AoE pulls TWICE! Dipshit even declined my invites and wouldn't respond at all. I seriously wanted to reach through my monitor and Heroic Strike that dude IRL.
---
Ye that happens. I was clearning a cave in STV with Dwarf priest as a Shaman and in the end he mind control me to give me his buff.
---
&gt;Give even more time before you AOE. Maybe don’t open up with blizzard, or multi-shot, or chain lightning. This isn’t retail WoW where every tank has great AoE tanking abilities.
---
Also because this isn't retail, mobs don't do any damage so if you pull threat it doesn't matter anyway
---
The amount of locks that have died after they stop getting heals in dungeons disagrees with you
---
I've done around 20 total runs between the first 3 dungeons and have 3 pieces. So I'll keep my grind up and keep killing herod until I have him fully farmed.
---
I'm a high school teacher and in Australia we don't teach it that time is on the horizontal axis, we teach how to identify the IV and DV and graph them appropriately. Time can't be the IV in the case as the time it take depends on your distance, not vice versa
---
I think tablecloth is famous enough to be a possible inspiration for this.
---
Ouff! Thats just plain wrong. Fucking with the people that go out their way to help a random with a quest.
---
no.. the spell cleave levelers got the realm first kills. these are the people with jobs and dont have much time trying to emulate spell cleave groups because they saw how effecient they were. What they don't realize is an effective and efficient spellcleave group is a group on comms playing together for 7+ hours a day. not randoms trying to scrape together doing it.
---
I mean... No? Lol. Have you ever been in an aoe dungeon run? The xp is ridiculously fast.
---
Its a 30 second CD, it lasts for 6 mins
---
"would you folk like some fish?" is the best response to having a woman almost beat up, haha.
---
Literally the worst thing about classic is that the respec costs so much and most classes pve specs are trash in everything but raiding
---
Let me hear you scream if you want some more..
---
Thank you! tha changes things .. Just another way warlocks are awsome!
---
What are the unit frames on the left called?
---
Crocks and tigers are skinnable too, so that's some added profit on top of that.
---
Using Eyes of the Beast as a hunter after taming a beast in a super low level zone, where low level players aren't flagged for PvP. Give it the same NPC name that it had(MottledBoar, YoungWolf, etc.) and press the walk button(/). Path around in jerky movements like an NPC enemy and wait for someone to attack it. This forces them into pvp and allows your character to kill them.
---
I only did this once to see if *anyone* would take the bait and someone did. If anyone decides to try this please don't be a piece of shit and do it all the time.
---
I could farm maraudon with a WL to.
---
With a druid gathering should be faster (stealth through caves, travel form from vein to vein)
---
The reduced armor really adds up, but the real benefit is that you get about twice as much overpower procs as before
---
That's usefull!
---
Pretty sure the point is that since the playstyle those people seem to enjoy is similar to the retail experience, why not go play retail instead?
---
Works the same IRL.. you can't fake your death forever.
---
BS you have to value BoE epics as some kind of a gold token you can trade later on for a different item/mount/anything else. It's an item, and as with any item that drops in a dungeon - you need it if you're intending on using it and its an upgrade for you, or you greed it if you want to sell it. End of the story.   
---
You made an argument of there not being any difference between mage rolling on a tank's epic BoE because he can just trade it for an epic BoE that he can use later... lol ok, imma extend that brilliant logic and now imma gonna roll on every green because it will help me get my mount a wee bit quicker, right? No. Need if you're going to use the item, greed if you're not (I mean its in the name - you're just being greedy).
---
Just tag the mob and drag it in, they'll get aggro and you'll still have the kill.
---
Hmmm Mage’s raiding is even worse. Rogue actually has a pretty cool pve rotation to do perfectly. But I agree it’s trash in everything but raiding
---
Roleplaying just means you do improv acting using your characters as puppets. Basically Dungeons and Dragons with less dice and stuff. Nobody believes they are their character or whatever (and self inserts are discouraged).
---
But people are desperate to find a crowd that's a bigger bunch of nerds than they are, and do everything they can to shit on roleplayers to make themselves feel superior and "less nerdy". Not helped that people assume "RP" means cybersex in Goldshire, something you'll see sky rocket to the front page of both subreddits while actual RP events are lucky to get a dozen upvotes at all.
---
Very well explained! I find this to be faster than to have to sit down and drink and eat, also the fun part about a warlock ist to constantly be fighting and managing aggro, mana and health without having to drink and eat most of the time.
---
What if transmog was only visible to the player themselves. For everyone else, it'd be the regular gear.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Haha she actually started playing about a week before I did in 2006. She likes tanking even if she’s old and slow lol.
---
If you make your char on Gandling Horde. I have a 55 warrior there but just made a 6 priest yesterday :-)
---
I don't invite unknown mages anymore to groups. Takes twice as long
---
Bruh
---
I didn't knew MC is a 30lvl instance.
---
sounds like one of those shithole guilds that people join until they find an actual guild
---
Sole
---
If Warrior rage was directly equal to player rage they would be the most overpowered class ever.
---
As you get closer to 40 (like 38/39) you could fight mobs that are grey and sell their drops - won’t gain XP and will get stuff that’s at least not a complete waste to sell
---
They do that for some of the more prestigious skins. If you have the Mage Tower artefact, the Challenge Mode Appearances, the Gladiator PvP armor etc that means you must have only have gotten it when it was live.
---
Dropped first run...but i am not plate user QQ
---
I think for alliance there is a quest in sm that gives an axe that is even better than the whirlwind axe
---
1.dont use slam.ever.
---
2.sunder vs heroic depends on the situation, but usually its best to sunder, especially when you have multiple melee fighting the same mob
---
I think most people call them Tankadins instead of Palatanks. Never heard that one before lol. 
---
That said, leveling one is fine. You may just have trouble finding a guild willing to take you as a tank in raiding. Not saying it’s impossible as there’s some how may like the challenge, but it’ll not be the norm. 
---
Main issues with Tankadins is they are crushable and have no taunt. Aside from that they can hold threat fine as long as dps and heals give sufficient ramp up time.
---
Could work both ways depending on level of memeing
---
Then at least you tried 😢
---
Lol. Also, fuck off.
---
What is a spellcleave group?
---
How do I redeem the 110 boost for hitting 60? I hit 60 but I dont see a level boost at all in the menu? am I blind? do I need to do anything special? I already own bfa
---
As someone with a 73 y/o dad who's playing, this was my first thought.  I'm sure he will have fallen for this at some point... and probably still does, I always feel really bad for him.
---
Redacted red is goin on my KoS list.
---
Some of these people take their RP seriously.
---
Well done internet pedant
---
1) enable hardware cursor or try disable it 
---
2) re-install your mouse driver 
---
If that shit aint fixing it, try changing between borderless/fullscreen and see if the issue is there.
---
Whatever that means, I reject your reality and substitute my own.
---
I made a small comment in a classic streamers chat, about liking a minor QoL (not even adding it in, just liking it). Oh man the chat jumped on me for that.
---
In my experience it's been a mix of both, you get a few people being dicks to people that want to RP, but I have seen just as many people being dicks about not enough RP.
---
Overall I am really enjoying the atmosphere of the server, and there are definitely quite alot of RP heavy guilds if people want to avoid non-rpers as much as possible.
---
Nuh, pulling is always the hardest part of AOE. Pulling all of them into one big blob is no simple matter. If one of them gave you a critical hit that slows you for 50%, you know, the kind that dismount you, you're done there. You must steer clear from them all the time.
---
Because for a lot of players the game starts at max level. And the max level in classic is different to retail.
---
Not even close to being a realistic solution.
---
Of course time can be the IV, you can choose whether you're measuring distance with respect to time, or time with respect to distance.
---
OP chose to measure time with respect to distance.
---
It's just so unusual to measure time with respect to distance that people find it confusing when time is the DV, and therefore on the Y-Axis.
---
Seeing as the breakpoints are coordinates on a graph, and therefore reading either time or distance would be equally easier whichever axis orientation you use, why not make Time the IV in order to conform to every expectation we have about graphs?
---
My friend ran me through Stockades until 32 and then every wing of SM until 45.
---
Some would say the robe is BIS until well past Tier 2 raiding gear. The mount is less important for a mage, your teleport spells plus taxis will make up any time saved by epic mount.
---
Go be honest, as long as you dont spend the money on the ah you can make 100g without trying in a day just finishing up available quests when you hit 60.
---
Gonna camp all those assholes that ganked me when i wasnt 60, private healer in back and camping those fuckrs till they delete their acc!!!

I played vanilla from the beta all the way through to TBC. All that time, I was a 5-man-oholic. I was pretty much always either healing or tanking those 5-mans. I've tanked every 5-man lots of times, both on warrior and paladin.
---
In my opinion, paladin tanking is absolutely fine in guild groups. But I always hated it in pugs. I like the say you said it:  
---
*" It's like building a house of cards. When it crumbles, it crumbles, but when it doesn't it feels great. "*
---
In a guild group, you can set up the clean pull (usually a LOS pull if possible), get them all gathered up, get DPS to start on the right target and everything is cool from there.
---
In pugs, you're always going to have some mouthbreather DPS who pulls while you're driking, or refuses to polymorph, or refuses to hit the right target. Messes up the pull from the start, and you're screwed.
---
Warriors and druids run into the same problem, but they have a wider array of "save this dumbass from his own mistake"-tools. Which makes them more popular along the dumbasses in pugs.
---
Quests give same xp unless they are grey.
---
Aren't ranged supposed to only do white damage in phase 1?
---
24 camp for a 40 gold??If they are actually playing they are better farming.Bots prob
---
Will do!
---
On a single mob:
---
* Open with: Charge &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Berserker Stance &gt; Berserker Rage
---
* Apply 1 or 2 Sunder Armor (depending on mob armor)
---
* Mortal Strike &gt; Whirlwind (only use WW when &gt;1 mob, or when you have enough rage to use both MS and WW)
---
* Overpower whenever a mob dodges (make sure to dump your rage below 25 before switching back to Battle Stance)
---
* Execute under 20%
---
On 2+ mobs:
---
* Open with: Charge &gt; Berserker Stance &gt; Berserker Rage &gt; Battle Stance &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Sweeping Strikes &gt; Berserker Stance
---
* Apply 1 Sunder Armor on 2 mobs you're focusing (if rage allows)
---
* Whirlwind &gt; Mortal Strike (only use Mortal Strike when WW is on CD or you have enough rage to use both)
---
* Demoralizing Shout if multiple mobs will be up for a while longer, or when you think you need the reduction due to incoming damage
---
* Overpower whenever a mob dodges (see normal rotation)
---
* Once Sweeping Strikes wears off, switch back to the normal rotation and focus a single mob

Indeed, even with very experienced private server players (that were in that first weeks rush), it took few clears to get the kinks figured out. And then they made it better over the next 8 hours. Then there was a youtube video made of the last runs that were super smooth. :)
---
I respect the meme spec hustle.
---
Nice meme
---
Interesting to know! I had never heard that before. I’ve been playing since vanilla, which never came across a paladin tank, and in BC I made a paladin tank and everyone on my server had always called them Tankadins.  I played BC thru retail on Arthas and Mal’Ganis.
---
I can't speak about raids but palatanks have many tools, like sure warrior taunt is cool but if more than one mob is attacking your cloth wearer taunt will only grab 1 of them, a paladin can divine protection the clothy while you grab the agro back. You also have buffs for casters not just the attack boost a warrior brings, you can res and you can throw out an emergency heal or 2 if the healer becomes oom. You have a ridiculously long stun. A paladin might not be the number 1 choice as main tank for a guild but they are certainly not useless like many people make them out to be.
---
You sure it wasn't your ctrl-c from your internet searches shining through? :p
---
Not a duel, tho.
---
Oh damn nice
---
None, i hate leveling. Enjoying high level content farm &lt;3
---
Thats cool as shit.
---
I started like 3 weeks ago (lvl 46 now) and none of my RL friends play this. Joined a guild at lvl 11, out leveled most of them. Feelsbadman
---
Exactly.  This whole pre raid BiS craze is just nonsense considering MC was cleared by a bunch of 55s in SM gear within the first 4 days of launch.
---
I think we all know what the real answer is.
---
It's a HUB of dungeons with multiple wings. Some people complain the linear design of TBC dungeons, but in vanilla it already existed. SM is the prototype of all of them, then there came Maraudon and DM. STM is a two-winged dungeon two. BRM as a whole is also a gigantic hub of both dungeons and raid instances.
---
Back in the day, yes. Nowadays I know better :)
---
Maybe I'm just a bit dumb, but the fact he decided to reply directly to the above comment meant I took it that he saw the sort of materialism and fetishism of electronics as cringy. Perhaps my bad.
---
I still think my comment has comedic value.
---
That's not a critical hit, that's Daze. Separate mechanic.
---
Whichever you find thats highest dps, while levelling it doesnt matter too much but swords are the most popular as there's lots of them around. Daggers are fun for pvp but kill speed on mobs will be lower. Maces are fun.
---
*[laughs in Paladin tank]*
---
Do you really wanna be the guy who's like "hey guildies, I screwed you over for my own benefit" ?
---
Because that's the message it sends to show up to raid on an epic mount while missing boe bis gear.
---
Does it stack with druid form?
---
Use both for more DPS
---
People have hit the true rage cost of Cleave and Heroic Strike, but they haven't hit the reason WW is better than both.
---
When you use Cleave or Heroic Strike, you only gain as much damage as they add to the attack, minus whatever is lost to armor. As people have covered, the true rage cost is also actually the rage cost plus the lost rage from the replaced auto. For Heroic Strike, that comes out to be about 25-30, while for Cleave, that comes out to 30-35, I think.
---
For Whirlwind, though, you spend 25 rage to do as much damage as an auto attack. Since Heroic Strike's bonus damage will never equal an auto attack, it always loses to Whirlwind in damage, even against a single target. 
---
This is why Whirlwind is used even against single targets as a Warrior. Once you hit 40 and get your strike, whether it's Mortal Strike or Bloodthirst, they become better than Whirlwind. But if they're on cooldown and you have enough rage to use them when they come back up as well as use a Whirlwind, then you should use a Whirlwind.

Hey,
---
I've  got 2 wow accounts on 2 different Battlenet accounts and I wonder how  to add a 2 factor authentication on the SECOND account. It's easy to set  it up on the first account, but I can't see any option on my phone in  order to add another Battlenet account to the Blizz authenticator app (  Andriod ). Once again, it's very easy and straightforward to add the  first account, but after I set that one up, I can't see any option on  how to get back and set up a second account on the same phone
---
Blizz  is claiming you can add up to 3 Battlenet accounts to the same mobile  authenticator, but I could't find a way to add the 2nd and 3rd account.  So, if it's possible as they claim, how can you add the 2nd and/or 3rd  account ?
---
You probably curl in the squat rack.
---
Whatever rocks your boat I think. Hope you're getting the most out of your sub.
---
Lol yes
---
You'll hold threat better and clear instances faster if you just tank as Ret and use a 2h. Respec around 50 if you still want to tank to pick up holy shield and cons. It's good enough for 5 man's but a lot of people will prefer a manaless tank.
---
[Apparently targettarget cannot be used as a conditional like that](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dc7kwt/macro_help/f26hsox)

Wow what a entitled little shit you are. You really expect to have your own rainbow flower server all to your self? Go fuck off man. To think your more important then the rest of the population is sickening. Sue blizzard? Good luck idiot.  We got the president committing treason left and right and this nerd wants to sue a gaming company cause they didn’t make it nerdy enough for him. Mad cause other players don’t share his views and thinks there not allowed. Go to a private server and have at it man.
---
Is spamming demo shout still as good as it was pre nerf? I recall them specifically nerfing that a couple weeks ago
---
This was a great link.
---
Shadowmeld doesn't matter as it will break the moment you start casting MC. I think they would aggro onto the priest but I'm not sure.
---
So good.
---
wc lvl?
---
Pala tanks are great for healers. You actually have time to drink between pulls, because ... the tank is drinking too.
---
If it were a little slower pace that would be cool, but dungeon grinding is much faster
---
I'd love to tank (and I always play a warrior as an alt). I don't want to hear "sorry mate, already got our mt and ot" when I have leveled to 60 and gotten gear from normal dungeons and am ready to move into raiding. Playing a tank is a dead end for most, as you only need so few for raids compared to dungeons. From what I've seen, a lot of guilds have their tanking team set before they even get their guild charter.
---
I play on Zandalar Tribe, I've only ever really played on PVP-RP servers (Defias brotherhood, The Venture Co, Sporeggar I think?) and honestly it is literally no different to any one of these servers. I don't know if pure RP servers like moonguard are different, but PVP RP servers are basically "you can RP if you want". I'm sorry if its not what you were expecting, but this is literally the way it's been for 15 years.
---
Yeah, guess I was a bit too eager to get started this time around. I thought it looked fine when I created it but the more I play him the more I hate his crossed out face and broken jaw :(
---
“Exploiting is fine, ur just mad!!!!!1!1!1!1!”
---
Mine too!So much more exotic !
---
Yeah he didn’t do anything correctly. I just meant he didn’t even IB so the tank could get it since he was ready to die. Then again, he went on his own and I don’t know if the tank was even ready.
---
Whatever, hopefully the guy will learn from it or it could’ve just been a mistake?
---
My point is there's no authority or governing body on wow slang lol
---
Reason I used this method is I have literally levelled 1 or 2 characters to 60 on most big private servers, including Northdale which came out a month or 2 before classic.
---
I've had my classic experience, I've done the questing, I know all the quest locations without using addons and the best way of completing them - So to me, it's just as mindlessly boring as running the same dungeon over and over again. So why not just run the dungeon over and over again if the XP is better?
---
He's right though, classic could use qol changes. The only argument against them is the slippery slope fear. But stuff like zooming on the map, fixing flight paths (no I don't enjoy having to alt tab for 10 minutes because the fucking bird is doing 5 laps around the continent), and highlighting new spells in the spell list menu would be cool.
---
It’s not as crazy as you think!

---
While Slam resets your auto attack timer, it costs 15 rage, and if used right after your auto goes through, it only delays your next auto by 1.5 seconds, plus any pushback. If you don't use it against dual wielding mobs, you can pretty much expect it to only get interrupted once, since the default swing timer is about 2s for enemies and the pushback for the first hit is 1s, up to the maximum cast time of the ability.
---
That's a lot of qualifiers, but the simple takeaway is that Slam's cast time maxes at 2.5s. If your weapon is slower than 3s, and it should be, Slam will never delay your next rage gain by as much as Heroic Strike will, making Heroic Strike worse in every case.
---
I concur, never did I say there was.
---
Agreed. So Rogues can use distract all they want. This is what PVP really is. Fair chances for both.
---
I couldn't say for sure 100% but no I think it was always like that.
---
What's the enemy plates mod?
---
Funnily enough I really like Male Undead for Warlock because of the end of cast animation is this cool looking lurched point, great when you're spamming DoTs. I think Undead in general have great animations, Femundead flips on Rogue Eviscerate and that's reason enough to make it the only race I'd pick if I wanted to level one lol.
---
Ok. Didn't know, just took the opportunity to throw in a monkey island reference
---
Saw that nobody mentioned pvp, if you plan on doing world pvp, having an epic mount can help you chase someone down/run away from others, while the robe won't do much for pvp.
---
\- Dont read reddit, play the game instead. Wow community INGAME is far better than in reddit / other forums.
---
\- Try to make friends while levelup, these can be invaluable later on.
---
Seriously, this is so funny to me because I've done the *exact* same thing. We killed like three and I thought, surely we can take some more. I arcane explosion the entire room and think I can be greedy to fit in a CoC gcd before Ice Block.
---
Instant death
---
So I did end up finding a solution for phase shift: Zoning in and out of an instance with your imp summoned.
---
This seemed to cause him to suddenly be able to cast it.

As for dark pact, I'll have to test that one.
---
One is a dot you throw on a target, the other is a channeled spell.

I've had a bunch of silly horde try to gank me while I collect my flowers out in EPL

I just sheep, let combat drop, and keep moving

I like to think completely ignoring them is a greater insult than getting into some belligerent, time-wasting scrap

Come phase 2 they're all getting bopped. I need my ranks, yo
---
I like how, in classic, Mages are the new Huntards.
---
Im level 28 mate.
---
healer wasn't even standing/ready when he said go. Did he not expect the mage to move?
---
Hmm, I play on Zandalarian Tribe and like it a lot. There’s always some unlikeable persons around, but I’ve never heard anything about any rules or that there has been.
---
maybe you are looking at a list of items with all expansions.
---
Because many "low" level items were added with oder expation packs, 
---
the other posibility would be that they are coming with a later phase because they were added later

There is not a single person on this earth that will not get it man. The most overused and TBH not that funny shit there is when it comes to wow.
---
But if you go there at lvl 38, then al the many first quests involve killing greyish-green mobs, which I find rather boring. I usually go there around lvl ~31, do everything I can, and then move on to Arathi and Badlands (or something like that) and then return around lvl 37-39. 
---
Most guides I've glanced at also seem to recommend an early entry into STV, followed by a trip to a couple other zones before returning and doing the rest.
---
The patrician male undead choice is no jaw. I play on RP-PVP and I had an Orc run up to me while I was fishing and say "What happened to your face?"
---
"Hogcycle accident"
---
He grumbled and left.
---
Your last post contained the word “everyone” mate.  I don’t think everyone is level 28
---
Mate.
---
So what's the point of your comment
---
Thanks for your thoughts.
---
Thought the same as you.
---
Would prefer WL because it’s more fun to me but as a pure Gold farming char I think I should choose efficiency over playstyle.
---
Male Undead casting animation is alright but I just think femundead casting is even better :)
---
But I agree on Undead &gt; all other races :D
---
Fun thing about those wolves is I think they actually share spawns with the spiders. So if you see no wolves but a lot of spiders, you should kill spiders.
---
Then you're talking out your arse, 'every class' aka 3.
---
You are doing God’s work old friend
---
Then you get 2 other people and kill them.
---
Pally is already pretty good for farming due to their durability, especially if you've taken some prot talents. Maybe warlock or hunter?
---
It's more efficient to dungeon level from 45 to 60 then do all the quests from 45-60 to earn gold instead of XP. You'll be making 2-6 gold each quest.
---
Even being offended and actually reporting them just cause someone didn’t make a perfect RP name is sad. You can’t control a whole server, and especially how kids want to play/talk.
---
Well, if he wants to reroll, might as well make gold with the current toon. If hes ~L40 now (mid way to 60), might as well re-roll now.
---
I have created a quick spreadsheet to calculate the gold per hour for these crafted items. I've just plugged in the figures for Strider Stew - if you buy at 6c a piece (32c per 5 stack), you make a 86s 40c per hour.
---
It's not major money, but it's something to do whilst AFK and more importantly, it's easy and uncontested. I am going to use this spreadsheet to try and figure out what's the best GPH based off OP's purchasing figures.
---
While I agree that almost every WoW player gets the reference, that shit was funny as hell when it first came out.
---
But did you read them all?
---
Rules are rules you mongoloid
---
.....what?
---
You just dont know how much gold you can make by aoe farming.
---
That's hilarious :D
---
ThreatPlates I think.
---
Found the mage
---
Questions like this is why moving the game to BC or adding progressive, linear content in Classic+ is bad. Don't change the game or don't increase the power levels. Let people play slow without feeling rushed, or that they're going to miss something.
---
OP should reroll and keep the orc as a mounted bank alt and mooncloth whore.
---
I went for mount first, since i think travelling speed is of higher priority intially. But as of now i have both, since the robe is bis until phase 3. So it will serve you long time.
---
Yeah it sounds like 12 year olds scamming 12 yr olds just from reading this thread.
---
Thanks
---
That's the reason I dislike spellcleave tbh.  
---
People see streamers running countless spellcleave runs with good/equipped players and tend to think that its a cake walk.... until they enter the dungeon and actually have no idea what to do besides spamming AE and blizzard.
---
With so many mobs around how long he will keep it on himself? 2 second maybe?
---
Be level 20. Go to westfall. Most things will have green levels. Be level 20. Go to stv. Most things will have red levels.
---
Even though you're Alliance, I approve of your methods.
---
Good job referencing one of the most referenced moments in gaming history.
---
It shouldn't be visible to opposite faction period.
---
In retail I'd also make it not visible to other people in LFG/LFR/BG groups (unless premade).
---
I'm in the middle of the country, so probly not going to help much. Also I'm already pretty committed to this server.
---
I was coming here to say that. Clear out some spiders and in a few mins you’ll find a bunch of wolves.
---
Holding their breath kills em
---
Who levels as fury, though?
---
It's slower than the best, but not as slow as the worst.
---
If you were to listen to the commentary, it apparently is the slowest most painful shit ever, but it has nothing on Paladin. And where Paladin is the same slow speed from 1 to 60, Warrior picks up dramatically in the latter half, once you have access to actual abilities to speed things up.
---
Level 40 rogue here with mount, 40g and 4 runecloth bags. LG, life’s good!
---
And he has a 30k car!
---
Is it a quest chain? Anyone got a link?
---
This stupid cave is posted once a day for karma farming.

DAE LIKE COLORFUL CRYSTALS?!?

Yeah but higher level quests award more XP.
---
Paladins say hi.
---
Is there any new place to erp? Asking for myself.
---
Hahah back in the days, i got kicked out of a raid because i used snowballs on healers. So the heal got interuptet from him.
---
also staged.
---
I guess I'm just wondering how referring to paladin tanks as palatank could possibly be "incorrect" lol maybe I read or interpreted your comment wrong
---
Well yeah, but I shouldn't have to. They're one person, I'm one person. The fact that they've empowered themselves using third-party software to the point where it takes multiple people to bring them down is a problem.
---
Two of my guild mates were 2 manning it today and hit lock out in like 35 minutes. They'd have another player reset the dungeon after logging out at anger.

Except Paladin.
---
Go Female Orc!
---
You sound like you're PvP focused so may I direct your attention to the Destruction tree.
---
Affliction is mainly for levelling, once you've got Talent points under your belt you can spec full Destro for the infamous Soul Fire nuke builds while also having powerful dots available to you. The idea is you use Succubus Seduction -&gt; Soulfire -&gt; Immolate while it's travelling -&gt; Conflagrate -&gt; Shadowburn and maybe sneak in a Searing Pain to 100-0 most classes if you land a juicy crit in the space of about 4 seconds while they can do nothing but watch.
---
If you cant find happiness in it, I'd strongly consider making an alt. Note that others may come with tips and builds to make it more engaging, but consider that, at 38, you're not even half way to 60 afaik.
---
Oh okay, good to know. Thanks!
---
I joined one because someone I was playing with regularly invited me, but since they haven't logged in again and I haven't joined them for raids, I've got no attachment to sticking with them. They have enough mages anyway.
---
Uldaman. Horde-only, though.
---
Reading this just seethes me with rage. I'd like to make a good comeback to that admin but honestly that's not my forte.
---
Everyone and their mom is a warrior dps
---
Laughs in druid forms.
---
Unless anything else has been specified before the item even drops, you roll need to equip (or learn, in case of a recipe) and greed for everything else. Just because there might be some ninjaing asshole around doesn't mean, everyone has to turn into one themselves.
---
Everyone rolling need on some item to sell it without having laid down rules at the start of the dungeon, will end up on the server discord as ninja looter with screenshots to prove it.
---
Now if you do win a roll on some very expensive item, in my opinion it would be a good idea to spread some of that good fortune to your group mates.
---
Fishing. Fishing for Oily Blackmouth or Firefin can really bring you some good gold on early levels.
---
I don't care about the person in the anecdote, this is just a really shitty attitude that I see a lot.
---
You are not BORN GOOD at anything. You really need to be conscious of the fact that any skill you have at the game (or anything, really) has been built up by putting time into it, and I'm not just talking about this game, but all the games you've played form a base of experience you can draw from. 
---
So next time you see someone who's being bad, maybe instead of thinking "This person doesn't know as much as I do - they must be stupid!"  you could try "This could be a new player - they still have a lot to learn." 
---
I will dare say that when you were level 30 on your first character ever, you weren't actually playing it as well and efficiently as you could have. 
---
Now imagine someone who's played like 10,000+ hours of the game coming to you and saying you're stupid because they know the optimal way to play and you don't. Yeah, you're that guy.
---
You can use distract outside of stealth.
---
Classic brd quest guide
---
Siphon is a DoT + needs to be talented, and Drain is a channeled spell.     
---
For leveling and solofarming, you have Siphon talented (extra DoT that leeches you life back so you can life tap more), otherwise it's not worth to go so deep in affliction talents.     
---
Drain is used commonly in drain tanking leveling build for the same purpose as Siphon, to have life leeched back and you can life tap more to sustain you killing speed and minimize downtimes for drinks. Drain can also proc instant shadow bolts (if Nightfall is talented).    
---
TL:DR Siphon for leveling (or solofarming). Drain for leveling, solofarming(depends on build), life sustain (tick of Drain is twice more hp than Siphon, but needs to be channeled) and with SL/Nightfall build could be used in PVP situationally.
---
Sadly when you equip items like this, the item starts on cooldown. See alliance in the distance? Equip the helm and wait 30 minutes. Then engage.
---

It takes me a solid 40 secs to kill a single mid-50s mob, even in str/ap gear.

I feel you brother...

Do you work 7 days a week? If not what is keeping you from finding a guild that raids late on your off nights?
---
Happened on my Server (Theradras) a few times: 
---
A Group invited random People (preferably lowlevel) to their group. Then "offered" them a Warlockport. Some people just accepted ( i can't get why they did it, i think most of them were new players) and were ported to the blackrock, most of the times in front of MC or directly into the lava.

BRD Lyceum, the dwarves respawn infinitely and are very easy to gather and AOE down. They no longer give any XP.
---
Yeah, I think we’re arguing about nothing. Haha. I never meant it to be taken as calling him out as wrong. I meant for it to be interpreted that it was a term I had never heard and found interesting. That’s why I tried to clarify in a reply comment to him that I didn’t think it was wrong.
---
I can understand people bashing others across different topics but i have never seen creator himself so proudly showing his mistake, editing it and calling out someone else in header of the post. :D
---
&gt; You can do more with full, it's really that simple.
---
You don't have an reply to that so you focus on the fact that we're not talking about duels.
---
This does not change the fact that a Warlock will perform better\longer with 100% mana and hp, PvE or PvP.
---
I was expecting this type of reply though... Winner of the damage meter gets 50 gold, you wouldn't want the tank to start pulling unless you had 100% mana or hp, correct?
---
1% hit on the finger slot also allows you to not lose armor or wear leather or mail as a warrior, therefore being not only one of the only hit% item, but about the best one with Blackcrow (Crossbow).
---
I suggest you find another guild then of like minded players. 
---
Once you find a guild you mesh with it’s not going to be an issue with what class or spec you bring to raids.
---
From my experience a lot of people get offended when you ask for payment, they believe they're entitled to free help. No one else is going to help you with your obscure elite quest, so why not pay a little to get it done?
---
Never played WoW b4 and i rolled a combat rogue atleast for leveling, i plan on respeccing after i complete t1 set.
---
Anyway im fine in PVP thus far (lvl 46). If you cant facetank them and sustain, and remain close up on your opponent then you are dead - and quick.
---
Thats my experience
---
Going from Undead and their Brisk pace to being a giant lumbering tower gliding across the floor definitely felt weird the first time I rolled cowman.

There are two faction flightmasters, horde one is on the left side as you come out of the tunnel and the alliance one is near the southwest corner of the lake.
---
When we had MC on farm and had too much raid time vs available content I'd time the cleave from certain trash mobs in MC and taunt half a second before they cleaved and kill all the Rogues (was fury Warrior, survived with about 15% life).

Also whispering random people during Geddon with "YOU ARE THE Bomb!" and watch them run away in panic.

If you were playing the game correctly, this wouldn't be a problem for you.

Why would he pull anyway?

Makes sense. Humans must be parrying with their head cuz I’m not getting any skulls.

Broken Tooth has a respawn of ~8 hrs right? So 3 tames per day.

Consider he gets tamed immediately after every respawn and 50% of created hunters want to get it. If the server has ~1500 hunters (not really unrealistic) and 750 want to get it, the first truly free spot is after 250 days. Now reports are conflicting, but say he spawns on every layer (some say specific rares do not spawn on every layer). This means with 5 layers (many servers have less) those 750 hunters still need 50 days of non-stop taming until everyone has it.
---
Think about it. Some servers have upwards of 10.000 hunter characters. Phase 1 will probably last less than 100 days.
---
I would not bank on getting Broken Tooth. Numbers just say it's very unlikely.
---
Right on!
---
It isn't ninja proof. If someone actually needs the item to equip it but the player who won the roll won't give it up, you are back at square one.
---
its not about the dmg for thunderclap, it’s about the debuff/threat. I always open with charge&gt;demo shout&gt;berserker rage&gt;thunder clap&gt; demo shout&gt;sunders.. or you can just charge&gt;demo shout&gt;sunders.
---
if you stance dance to get berserker rage and thunder clap off you have to be quick so you’re not nuking all your rage you get from berserker rage and blood rageI also have a macro that uses blood rage/berserker rage at the same time so that’s also useful.
---
Nope, till level 60. Than Drowning Pool's - Bodies start playing.
---
Is magic dust in the game? If so, hope you didn’t leave before getting some of those.
---
I wonder why speaking/writing correctly is becoming a bad thing lately...
---
He asked if they were ready, they told him to go. Looks like the healer didn't react. Should have been no problem keeping him up, Grom had 75% of his mana.
---
Are you asking for free water?  Maybe that's why.  Go to the vendor and see how much 6 stacks of level 45 water costs and next time you ask a mage for water say something like "Excuse me, can I buy some level 45 water please?" then pay him/her a fair price like 1g for 6 stacks.
---
Sry copper
---
Lol if you die when a mage casts frostnova you were out of position. Dont blame the mage or tank for your own mistakes.
---
It's true! The rule of thumb they teach with improv is "Never say no." When you get better you learn there are exceptions, like any of those, but in general if someone has a thread they want to follow you should let them tug on it for a bit rather than immediately shutting it down. 
---
And yeah, it makes for really bad RP too. But I don't mind, I've only gotten stuff like that a handful of times throughout the years and it was always by the exact kind of people I don't care about RPing with anyway.
---
So this happened right before Legion dropped. He was given a stronger body from an experiment involving the val'kyr and his cousin's corpse (Stephon Marris) to better fight the Legion. I think Blizz was trying to make him more powerful/relevant within the lore, but it ironically made him way more unlikeable.
---
R-HUB remote support is one of the best tools for remotely accessing computers.
---
Found the mage player.
---
My hunter got finally 60 this week and im around 18% crit and i dont think aimed shot crits less than the auto shots. Maybe get yourself an dmg addon and after a fight you check the stats? You should clearly see how often aimed shot crits and how often you crit in general.
---
I play alliance - now - but I identify as Tauren.
---
I don’t think so, your gear is part of your personality in classic, like if you have dreadnaught gear and thunder fury people will be like “oh that’s (whatever name)”
---
Zandalari-Tribe?
---
Really? That alex model took me places. I'm still waiting for them to add dragons as a race that can look like that.
---
Mages are the worst
---
&gt; are there plans to remove layering from the game?
---
The plan is to combine layers as soon as possible. Also the plan is to not launch phase 2 with any server having more than 1 layer. We don't know if they just wait until every server has only 1 layer (which might take a while for large servers) or if they wait until most have only 1 layer and then just put everyone on the large servers into 1 layer (which won't be fun at all).
---
&gt;This is the same for me. On retail it is about the phasing of the session. In classic it is about the layers.  
---
&gt;That is in Darkshore and a copper vein too - I have had the same problem. I just ignore it and move on
---
Not Layers, the Copper node in Darkshore with the same problem is in the same spot in an identical cave. It's something going wrong with displaying nodes in that particular spot for that particular kind of cave it seems.
---
I prefer strafing with q and e, ONLY have movement on those two and forward with W. asd is used for keybinds.
---
Dude, I need it
---
Having ghost Wolf is super nice, that’s just one little thing you should’nt underestimate. Movement speed increase is such a relief to leveling. I have a 14 priest and i am already tired of running :D
---
Imagine a mage being stingy with the water
---
If I want the item for my character I would need it EVERYTIME in pugs. If I want the item for gold I would greed instead. Unless I see someone else need on it who is not going put it on the character the one is playing with, then I would also need for the item. If it's a worthless drop for me gear and gold wise, then I'd pass. 
---
Isn't this how the system is designed to work anyways? Why people try to make stupid rules in pugs and then start crying when they get bamboozled? Don't really want to victim blame here but isn't this the truth?
---
&gt; They no longer give any XP.
---
Didnt know they werent meant to give XP. When did they patch this?
---
Hello!
---
I've taken it upon myself to get exalted with Ravenholdt, I've currently got about 2,200 heavy Junkboxes and was hoping that I could kill mobs to get from friendly to revered as many of the guides online (that state specifically classic) say I can. However, killing Syndicate mobs seems to yield no reputation at all.
---
Am I going to have to get another 1,500 heavy junkboxes to complete my task!?
---
Thank you,  
---
Callidus.
---
He is right you know. These cringe-posts have been growing like weeds lately and if you're not gonna be the guy who points out that this is low quality content, at least let other people do it instead of downvoting and trying to bury it. 
---
Your life must be real sad if you can't live without these overly positive cringe posts.
---
Was this too harsh, do you need your safe-space now?
---
Its fun getting BIS? What is the point of playing if you are not suppose to get gear?
---
51 hunter, 34 druid, 25 shaman and like 3 level 10s
---
&gt;	easiest with 4 mages and a priest for GY,
---
Easiest? Definitely not. 
---
I’ve leveled almost exclusively with spellcleave on my mage and having all 5 people use even a few braincells is a fuckin feat to say the least. Literally all the other mages have to do is cast blizzard after I nova and they still somehow fuck it up.
---
Ahh yeah I just saw the comments down below. I’ve seen doormat too!
---
Yeah people are overdoing it. We could blame the BiS list but no It's useful sometimes. It's this min/max mentality that grew in 15 years and we cant backtrack this.
---
What makes me laugh is people not understanding stats and blizzard shenanigans and wearing BiS when they come with another item to be BiS (like 1% hit does nothing and is ignored if you're not human with sword/mace or orc with axe). Having a blackstone as your only hit item if you're not one of these 3 races using the correct weapon is USELESS. Blizzard stated in a blue that the first hit% is ignored, but hey whatever, keep acting like sheeps.
---
Except pure dungeon spamming is not the fastest way to level on retail. The best way is to be doing something that gives you XP at all times.
---
Generally that does mean you should be in dungeon queues all the time but you only really want to do every dungeon once because dungeon XP has been nerfed, so without quests, repeated clears don't give all that much XP. So you should queue for specific dungeons instead of randoms. That makes queue times longer, so you spend the time questing in dense quest hub areas.
---
and yet, funny.
---
Now your luck quota is depleted for the rest of vanilla, prepare to roll 1 on all drops ever
---
You go into BRD with 3x mages 1x warlock and 1x priest and head to the Torch Room where the dwarfs have an insane respawn rate until you kill the torch bearers and like the 2 pyres in the far corners of the room, after lighting the pyres the door opens revealing a Fire Giant boss before the final boss room.
---
The point of the run was to do a Lava Run (Fast, skip all bosses) and get to just before the Torch Room, you get the Warlock to CONSTANTLY spawn Eye of Killrog, the priest will immeditately bubble it and it runs into the room and gets as many mobs as possible.
---
One mage spams R1 Blizzard on the entrance to slow the incoming non elite adds, 2x mages spam Frost Nova + Cone of Cold + Arcane Explosion as the mobs get into vacinity. They only gave around 10-15 XP per mob, but pulls are about 50 mobs per pull and it's a constant flow of mobs.
---

---
The enchants to make them BiS are not out yet.
---
it sounds like you're forcing yourself to play the game
---
I mean, I already got him. I got really lucky and it only took me about 45 minutes after I server changed.
---
It’s a tight rope you guys are walking and some of you don't get it so right. 
---
UD holy priest here, at your service. 
---
my leveling buddy is actually a lock and i'm a vanilla vet.
---
here's my perspective: 
---
i don't like to see significantly less than full healthbars to start with, that's my trade. 
---
however during a fight, especially one that's not so straightforward it becomes difficult to judge if the lock is at 20% because he is OCD lifetapping or  because there are mobs pummeling his clothie arse. 
---
demon armor or not, you ain't gonna last long.
---
I know, right, JUST LOOK, but in a hectic situation, my esteemed lock friend, you are far down the pecking order. 
---
the tank has my full attention, 2nd is myself (a dead healer heals no one) and everyone else only after. 
---
facts of life and all that.
---
just the other day i ran with a random lock, he was good, doing his thing lifetapping like a crack addict. I said nothing, business as usual.
---
until he hung back too far one pull, a patrol behind us got to him first and he was pretty much one shotted because he made a point of staying at around 20% hp no matter what. 
---
i saw his healthbar disappearing on the raidframe, could have PW:S-ed to gain time for a heal, but, since he is a lock, I hesitated one wee second, lamenting if he just took the lifetap a step too far this time or what. 
---
that second cost him his life. 
---
we didn't wipe, i ressed him, no biggie. 
---
shows the constant dilemma any healer has when looking at you. 
---
fun fact - later the same run we had a very hairy fight, everyone was OOM, dr00d tank periodically came out of bear to Rejuv himself between times I had just enough mana regen to cast a single Heal on him. 
---
this same lock was near full hp, OOM, but now he was wanding the boss. literally the one time he really should have lifetapped.
---
Still love you guys, though, no hard feelings!
---
Like a week ago.
---
What’s BB?
---
I've ran a few SM Lib/Arms with 3 mages 1 lock and myself on my priest alt. God it was beautifully efficient for the few runs that I did do.
---
While I do wish I got something similar going on my warrior tank now that I'm primarily focusing on him, I frankly enjoy the lax chill standard groups I've been doing lately.
---
Hi
---
May I ask how long it took per level?
---
RP-PVP, surely you can be one or the other? Or both?
---
Prat
---
dude should have abolished poison before skinning, it could've cleared blind and if he skinned in form he can't be sapped.
---
The loot rule would be selected by the Group Leader the moment the party enters the Dungeon so any nonsense is dealt with right away.
---
When you grow up... you will learn the world has a plethora of things to deal with that are actually important, and not even a fraction gives a shit about your Dancing night elf. It’s just a game, don’t like it? Move on.
---
You sound like you need to take your own advice.
---
I wouldn't have. Without prior clarification it's generally expected that the tank should pull, not the mage.
---
It's about being the person who points it out and corrects someone. Rather than knowing they made a mistake and going about your day.
---
The former personality is annoying as fuck to most and usually isn't invited to parties.
---
To be fair those scarabs hit surprisingly hard for non elites. My group left after finishing the instance and I pulled a pack myself to AOE down so that I could complete their quest. nearly died instantly as well.
---
suree, because it matters so much with the current super hard raids. as was already literally done, you can clear the entire raids in leveling greens.
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
Robes. Until P3 when BGs come out your epic mount doesn’t really help with much besides gold farming and us mages do all our grinding in instances.
---
5 minutes into my paladin's life on Bloodsail Buccaneers, I had some guy trying to add me to friends so I could be his healslut. All I did was say hi to him in a chirpy way and he got so hard. 
---
I feel bad sometimes, I told him I'd accept his friend request when it came through and it was just lagging. I imagine he's still sitting at his computer, clutching his limp peen, waiting for me to log on so he can finish what I inadvertently started all those weeks ago. 
---
But yeah I don't know what the other guy's on about. That gnome is loving life as a doormat and we're all happy to be a part of it.
---
This sub if you get camped : "omg its not pvp what a loser what's the point of killing low levels you are a plaggue to the world"
---
This sub if you distract people into water making them waste 3x more time : "lmao"
---
Faerlina... enjoy the queues and intentional server crashing
---
Ah, finally, we can settle the ancient dicussion.
---
Do Paladins wear Robes or Dresses?
---
Pally tank is best for AoE aggro. Warriors are the worst I\`d say.
---
Psst, there is a 100% crit chance while you sit down. Temptation is too strong .)    
---
Disclaimer: I'm not a rogue
---
....exploiting?
---
Fair, I just kill everything, skin everything, sell everything.
---
In Retail, /follow breaks in PVP.  Unless they are running melee, fear is highly problematic.  You need some advanced macros to adjust and even then it’s not great.
---
In Classic, /follow doesn’t break.  You can recover in less than a second.
---
Which damage meter is that?
---
Can confirm...
---
I think it is zperl
---
Yeah I like how random it is and how frustrating it is.
---
It looks like a problem before you start raiding and see that epics are now almost always an upgrade cause they're mostly better designed (let's not talk about Tier Armors, some are awful). 
---
Blues are blues and they're here to help you get into endgame, they aren't endgame. Them being random af makes epics even more better.
---
Why such a fine man should wear a dress?
---
I never said it wasn't? The fact that it is staged is still unknown to some people...
---
Can we have special flair for posts indicating scammers?
---
Dresses, ofc. There is no discussion here.
---
Mad lad with mad mspaint skills
---
I was a nelf spriest when I started playing wow. I started the same combo here again but I rerolled to human after learning shadowmeld didn't work in combat. Then I learned humans dont have any pvp trinket racial in classic and now Im sad i didn't roll a dwarf
---
9/10 times I get those stupid leather boots instead of the Manual Crowd Pummeler.
---
You, sir, are an uncultured swine.
---
Thanks, mate!
---
And will hopefully never be a thing.
---
Mail them to your bank alt and back? Put them in your bank that's accessible from a city that's in the same zone?
---
Int also has yellow glow
---
We have 4 friends in a guild alliance side and some horde side, us allies do dungeons that suit our lowest level so it boosts them faster and slows us keen beans down. We help out the lowest leveled people and craft gear for them, get their elite quests done etc. The fun is in playing together, not racing ahead for us. The higher leveled people tend to fish or do professions, class quests etc when they are online without the others.
---
It's not even a case of too many people not RPing. That doesn't bother me and I don't expect everyone to want to RP all the time. But whenever anyone voices their grievances over legitimate disruptions to RP gameplay, like OP, it's always met with derision by the very people who picked the RP server with no intention to respect the rules of the server. It's honestly selfish, and OP does have a case here
---
I do all the time thanks.
---
Sorry, but the warlocks you have to tell this to on reddit are not gonna be quick on the draw with it
---
Which dungeons did you do if you dont mind me asking? I'm lvl 38 and I'm just questing or doing SM arm
---
Hunters are ranged too.
---
I'm not a rogue and I'm still waiting for your evidence of what 'utility' a warrior or hunter brings.
---
HoJ can be farmed easily, 3 man party of semi-geared 60s can do 5 runs per hour. 
---
The chest isn't worth farming in my opinion, 16% chance for the right boss to show, * 20% chance for the item to drop, * 50% (or worse) for you to win the roll = 1-2% chance per run. And the runs take longer.
---
Like 5k xp and some boots
---
Tyvm. Thats the cuttest thing i heard in the past months :D
---
Because what matters is whether or not you complete a raid?
---
&gt; If everyone has more gold everything will cost less hence gold is less worth.
---
Wait what.. if gold is worth less, everything will cost *more*, not less.
---
Pretty sure Torch room got patched. Used to be around 120-140k exp/hr in there but last time I passed through at 59 the dwarves were giving 0 exp.
---
Why would you name yourself Bormann?
---
You didn't those 2words that I put in "quotes". lol
---
Your sarcasm detector is broken. :)
---
Facepalm
---
You can also change the loot to master loot then you can hand out the loot from princess to people who haven't finished the quest.
---
That was me in 2006. Now i just have 1 lvl 60 mage, don't even feel like playing alts. Before it was all about trying out other classes.
---
This. I spent twenty minutes clearing spiders and everyone else just killed the wolves that respawned :(
---
You’re not wrong but you’re n... nah you’re actually just wrong.
---
Healer won’t get aggro after mage iceblocks unless the healer has healed the mage... obviously. Power word shield. Ice barrier. Mage grabs everything and ice block for a neat little bundle ready to be AoEd.
---
Get a job man
---
I will try this now. Happens to me too. Sad to hear there is no actual fix. Thank you for this!
---
im not, im complaining about people who have no intention of following the rules
---
Ah I see, thank you.
---
We had an excellent warlock who used this and saved our underleveled group a lot of grief in an emp run.
---
It IS the healers fault here my dude. I'm a healer. I am leveling my second healer to 60. These scarabs are NOT pulled by tanks, they are pulled by mages. 
---
Honestly, at 60 it is easier for me to heal 4 dps than it is to heal a slow tank.
---
it was a very wholesome group, this gif is in good fun
---
I was already thinking about that yesterday. I probably shouldn't leave the house either, just to make sure I won't get hit by a piano falling out of a building.
---
Nah just find a mob 10 levels lower and you should be able to kite it for several minutes
---
can you understand that most people don't have to have all BiS no matter how much it costs? that's what the top 0.1% of guilds/ players does, but for 99.9% of population epic mount will be the more useful and better choice than spending hundreds of golds for items that are marginally better than readily available BoP items. for elitist pricks such as yourself, spend all the money you like on whatever you like and run with aspect of the cheetah for all I care
---
I was keeping up with the tank, not the dps
---
You really framing the issue here. Warriors and druids do have more  "save this dumbass from his own mistake"-tools. Thanks for your feedback.
---
I killed every target within 20 seconds or less, it’s called managing Aggro and doing chain pulls.
---
Don’t make baseless assumptions.
---
This applies to wotlk. In classic when it comes to loot disputes it's up to the players to figure it out. Nothing inherently wrong with switching to masterloot for a boss as long as you allow everyone to fairly roll on items.
---
Dwarf with a belly full of drank.
---
If you want to reroll, recycle this character into a profession alt : since you've already got tailoring, use the char for the Mooncloth cooldown. For the 2nd profession, pick up Alchemy or Leatherworking, and use a cooldown as well.
---
Maybe a druid? 30% speed increase at lvl 22, shapeshifting out of cc’s, surviving those oh shit moments with Bear form and relatively fast killing speed in cat form.  If you’re thinking more of endgame i don’t know much :D
---
I'll check it out.
---
Its so dumb with these mages sometimes , I asked this mage in brd while doing bael packs not to aoe and sheep moon. He said "ok" and proceeds to aoe and die.
---
The biggest obstacle you'll face as a dps shaman at end game is guilt.  Your dps in 5 mans is pretty fantastic while leveling, but once people around you start getting geared up at 60 you'll start to stall and fall behind.  It's still usable in raids but even if you play with people who are willing to bring you along, it'll be hard to convince yourself that you're contributing equally to the group.  
---
It's really a shame, because I find both dps specs to be so much fun.
---

Props to the dudes name. Their a sick metal band.

I was undead warlock and rerolled to human rge at 26, 46 now and no regrets.

Low 40s, idk - id probably still consider not rerolling. to me playing warlock also felt bad and they look terrible (dat mount tho) so i bailed early on and had a much better experience this is my first wow play through.
---
Always carry mana pots that give at least enough mans to shift once. Always.
---
I dont see why they cant just offer realm transfers for the overpopulated faction... Offer horde on a 70%horde 30%alliance realm free transfers to a realm where the imbalance is 70%alli 30% horde.

I personally wanted to roll paladin when classic was announced, but then did my research and everywhere i read, said pretty much the same &gt; Paladins are only best a healing. I was little beaten by that, that such a hybrid class is only viable at one spec..My wish is that paladins have atleast 1 more spec to be competitive, Tanking would really fit the bill, lore wise and it kind of make sense, they are the protectors of light. Also they should be highest dps against undeads, also lore wise, but then again maybe that would give them too much leverage. So since ret paladins just don't do viable damage because lack of abilities, i hope someone can atleast make paladin tanking work.
---
Interesting test and gz on the time you spent for that. 
---
Although this blade is 39. It is a very good twink item (since up to lvl 40 you rely on heroic strike which is not an instant attack and it’s based on weapon speed, even though the dmg calculation requires slower weapon for max dmg output) but at lvl 40 warrior gets mortal strike so the weapon speed and max dmg become crucial in choosing a weapon.  Thus making it a inferior to other warrior weapons that are slower with speeds up to 3.8 or 3.9 or so.
---
It’s level 40 for quest and I think you need 35 to get blacksmithing high enough. Best of luck.
---
As a hunter, should I level fishing and cooking?
---
Gtfo with your logic and good arguments
---
I didn't expect mage to pull aggro rather than the tank ;P
---
Thats because you are doing it wrong, you use an opener then immediately use slice and dice you ate taking longer than you have to to kill.
---
Wait. Why are you spending time to comment on a comment on a post about classic wow mount again?
---
Bro plz spellcleave bro plz
---
Found the real life warrior
---
I'm curious. What's your talent build exactly?
---
names like shatlord is just plain stupid and instead of blaming us for being offended, why not just join a realm where there are no name rules.
---
Why priest specifically?
---
The only time I enjoyed running it was when I did it our pally tank for this reason. Otherwise the gauntlet hallway always ended with me tanking at least one mob as a holy priest trying to keep everyone up while running.
---
 Pally tanks really came into their own around t6, me and a buddy of mine would sell karazhan runs every week with him solo tanking, me solo healing and 8 DPS. we'd blow through it in a couple hours and keep anything that wasn't a main spec roll as payment. Split a few stacks of void crystals at the end. it was good money.
---
leveling enchant will do that to you
---
Thanks for your feedback :)
---
Because if you are going to hard cast a spell you should just cast shadow bolt. 
---
If you are relying on dots for damage you can usually do more dps with a wand then you get from casting immolate. I never used immolate from 1-60 once I got pst level 20.
---
If someone needed 500g to buy Lionheart helm, would you give it to them? That is what you're proposing when you say that a BoE should go to someone if they need it. It's a fine mentality for guild runs and the such where the sum of the parts is greater than the individual, but for a random pug?
---
I'm willing to help others and often do runs that have no possibility for loot for me. I'm just not so charitable as to pass on 500g for a random player. That's hardly being greedy and runs stay happier when everyone has a fair chance at the lotto.
---
Apparently my thoughts are not as original as I imagined.
---
Is it as good as combat for pve or prep cb for pvp?
---
Probably not. Is it bad for either? Far from it.
---
Seal fate is not much worse than prep for pvp, and its allright for pve, just a bit harder to get going gearwise.
---
But thats the point of having a focused spec
---
I stopped healing warlocks because im not your mana refill... I think most ppl choose wl because he has the 1g mount and dont understand how to use the abilities correctly. Sure you can lifetap but if you dont drink or eat between pulls dont expect me to heal you.
---
All of its hooves are already mangled from the previous warrior it parried and killed.

Looks terrible on a dwarf tbh

They poach players from other guilds, especially 60s. Four of my guildies went to Invicta the day after they turned 60.

True, but I don’t mind when someone points out the mistakes to prevent those things from happening again
---
Hunters had a bad rep in vanilla for 3 reasons:
---
Easy leveling (made worse by the fact that one of the top leveling guides was made by a hunter player)  
---
Weird stat requirements (leading to memes about how everything is a hunter item)  
---
Bad pet control (+ feign death) causing issues in groups
---
Mages are popular because they have the fastest leveling speed if played well, but the high population means most don't know how to use them.
---
could you fax those photos to me?
---
I farmed the rock elementals in Arathi for 2 levels from 37 to 39 and made around 50 gold from drops. Just remember to sell elemental earth at AH.

You actually don’t.

If it was 5 levels in I wouldn't care, but now it's 34 levels :(

But those ambush crits for almost the total of the hp mob tho &lt;3
---
Or we can just sue the whole company... like what an extreme! Just a video game.
---
crunches, burpies, star jumps, many things to do instead of smoking
---
The more you know
---
Any fight where a healer ends oom and the pull started with the warlock below 100%, there's wasted mana that could result in a party members useless death.
---
Any life tap out of combat needs extra drinking time for a healer, it doesn't matter if it's before or after the next pack, they still have to recoup that mana.
---
You assume it's drain life spec, at max level that doesn't apply. You also aren't regenning health in combat and if the tank is waiting for you after the tap then you aren't saving time.
---
&gt;cat form white damage is ass

\*Laughs in MCP\*
---
How much do Arcanite Bars normally run for once server economies are fully established?
---
Yeah, I've been gaslighting myself I think, I was sure this used to be a thing, but since it's not in classic, maybe it wasn't.  
---
I started in Vanilla and stopped playing during TBC. I remember /focus being a thing that I used a lot in raids and I miss it.
---
Right in the feels mam. Ouch
---
I come from toxic pservers. It’s so damn nice to see that the community blossoms right now. People don’t feel that serious and just want to play and have a good time.
---
Level 25 Orc Warrior  
---
Level 20 Tauren Warrior  
---
Level 17 Human Warrior...
---
At 38 you should be able to do SM cath runs, or continue SM arm until you are maybe 39\40.
---
SM cath until 43-44.
---
ZF 44-50
---
BRD arena\exp runs 50-54
---
Torch runs 54-58(these runs do not exist anymore, nerfed)
---
At 58-60 you get by farming your preBiS\BiS items.
---
ace
---
Vuhdo, very customizable but can be a bit confusing at first
---
Should have been an elf or human.
---
Makes sense! There is too many warriors and they can't damage zhevras because they parry.
---
And i, the OP,  acknowledged your reply, explaining the reason for my mistake. I don't know why he's here either.
---
Oh I thought Arm was higher level than cath lmao
---
Idk maybe a big pvp guild? We hate ours too, no idea why :D
---
Just pick up as much int gear as you can. Turtle scale gear should be quite cheap to buy. Once you've got int gear for every slot, make the swap. Quest rewards are good, but take a long ass  time to get a full set. Don't be afraid to spend some gold, you'll earn it back quickly when your kill speed doubles.
---
Thank you so much!
---
the more i thought about it the more what you saying makes sense
---
so far I wasnt paying attention to this but it annoyed when ppl rolled on my stuff but obeying the mainspec rule or talkin about it beforehand would prevent it
---
thanks
---
thanks!
---
&gt;It’s just not really worth the 40% speed increase for a reduction in damage
---
Not getting an upgrade isnt a "reduction in damage".  You would be chosing a 40% speed increase instead of a damage upgrade.
---
Not gonna lie, I saw that shit when it first came out back in the day and had no idea it was staged. I guess it makes sense. Did the original people say that it was?
---
yeah it's the name that sounds retarded
---
Kinda weird considering you can't do just about anything else. Opening doors in strat/scholo? Nope. Popping a potion? Nope. Using sand on chromaggus? Nope.
---
You really haven't played an insane amount. Not even close.
---
A fair opinion. Thanks for the feedback.
---
I can imagine it. When a mage gets new water they can only make two at a time. So takes a LONG time to make it all haha. Stingy might not be the right word but yea.
---
&gt; name checks out
---
If you're in a leveling dungeon, nobody is going to care. But when farming max level dungeons for gear as effectively as possible...
---
Life drain is shit dps and SM\ruin is the right pve spec for high end content.
---
If you Life Drain instead of eating\drinking when everyone else is, you're going to get replaced with someone that actually does dps during fights rather then regaining resources.
---
I just hand out one level down and give them a fuck ton if I just got my level. No one wants to wait 15 minutes for me to conjure them 2 stacks.
---
Half of my bis as prot warr came from the AH. Now I’m lvl 59 with 5g to my name...
---
Mage is my absolute favourite class. So much fun.
---
My tips would be:
---
- Try to run every dungeon once at least. You may find you prefer questing. But playing in dungeons is essential to learning your class. You don’t want Strat or BRD to be your first dungeon.
---
- Play single target damage dealer. I find spell cleave stressful and much less fun.
---
- When in dungeons, let the tank pull, give them time to build aggro, then dps down the one that is marked or the one with the least health.
---
- if the mob is marked with a moon, that means the tank wants you to sheep it.
---
- don’t be scared of battle grounds when they arrive. Mass pvp is so much fun as a mage (AV particularly).
---
- think about picking up gathering professions to get cash. You can prob switch to tailoring at a higher lvl.
---
- everyone will tell you to spec frost and it is probably more efficient (and early raid content resists fire) but fire spec is also a blast, so don’t feel you have to.
---
Have fun!
---
I feel for you, no one wants streamers on their realm, but this:
---
&gt; before I, we sue the company in court with the support of consumers associations. 
---
Is one of the most retarded things I've ever read. You have no case in the slightest.
---
lol do you even read? I dont multibox you shitstain, im just explaining that its not cheating to all you dipsticks who think its against the rules
---
DPS is too low when every dps is level 50.
---
The scarabs don’t aggro so it actually makes sense to do this to grab a bunch. He should’ve just been quicker with frost nova.
---
What's the squid drop rate like?
---
But digging out herbs with claws is completely fine.
---
It’s a chick
---
This one worked better before that extensions that tells you the title of youtube links 
---
nice try though
---
If they state in the TOS that they will enforce rp realm rules and don't, then yeah dudes got a case.  Blizz wrote their tos, they either need to enforce it or change it
---
Ah yeah, I remember that, she posted it on craigslist and I think the guy who responded ended up becoming her sex buddy IIRC.
---
A few things with this
---
One, you can tank without having the tag "OT" under your guild roster. Tanks die. Tanks have date night. Tanks get burnt out and don't show. Tanks want to not tank. Get in there and tank even if you aren't the official MT/OT
---
Two, you'll soak up tank gear, you just get 3rd dibs at it. So you're stuck with blues for the first few weeks. Not great, not terrible
---
Three, you don't need MC epics to run any dungeon
---
Four, you could probably create a guild out of thin air if you want to tank. Tons of dps and many healers are homeless or in guilds without any ability to raid because of the absence of tanks
---
Nice input dude !
---
I rarely shift in / out into bear due to the mana cost so I just travel form most of the time. If I shift in bear I try to stay there for as long as possible !
---
I leveled engineering recently so I can now use some juicy bombs but I dunno when is the best moment to !
---
this can be useful too, if you accidentally pull and extra mob (as a warrior), then you can hit 1 mob and move backwards until the other mob resets and you have no issues
---
Thats a lie. Cant pull 3-4 mobs because if you do your vw dies. You can only fully dot 2 mobs before you need to lifetap. 3-4 is you needing to be on emergency mode, probably need to fear one for sure. Being able to pot+hs can probably get you to 100% but doesnt mean much when you need to immediately tap for mana multiple times to throw out dots again.  
---
Warrior is pretty much the same thing. Currently on my 38 alt i can easily pull 2 mobs and kill them without going below 70-80% maybe even higher hp if i get lucky crits. 3 mobs is annoying but not impossible. 4 requires the use of fear &gt; bandage after killing 3.  
---
Honestly i think a ton of warriors are just bad or below average in skill and these are your typical reddit posters which is why these "warriors need to eat after each pull" posts are so common.
---
okay bro
---
All this BiS bullshit is ruining the game. You can probably raid right now if you wanted. Guilds have proved that. Spending that much gold on one item is pretty asinine.
---
Hi, /u/Pyrotundra

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dc906o/anybody_else_reroll_a_bunch_and_finally_realize/). 
---
Is this avoidable if you aren’t auto running but instead holding both mouse buttons?
---
How do you steer clear from them if you get dazed? Mobs already move faster than you when in combat. Suppose one mob right beside you has dazed you, while at least one another mob is still out of frost nova's range yet, how do you handle that situation? You could ice block then blink of course, but that's highly risky. If you react one millisecond slower when ice block wears off, and all of them hit you at once, you're surely done there, even if they're all green. I've been there and done that.
---
The story is obviously fake. Just think about it.
---
New player, total noob. Still lvl 30 two weeks ago AND add to that, took 30-60 in two weeks. The guy barely knew the basics, and had no fucking idea that Ratchet existed. As a horde. At lvl 30. That is as big of a noob as you can get.
---
And he is TANKING UBRS one month into the expansion. The story was just a badly crafted lie in a failed attempt to farm some futile karma points.
---
There is a reason why its been deleted you know. It got him gold however, so I'd say it worked.
---
True and a lot of people run out of quests becUse they ignore green quests . Not saying you do just in general
---
yea, you are right, took us some mins to find out, but when we started to clear all spiders, spawns were nicer
---
Makes sense.
---
This is amazing, I love the style with the thick lines.
---
Your turtle cat is adorable.
---
Yeah, they just super jumped backward, must be a new player ability /s
---
How do macros work? I have no idea where to put this code and I just want fishing to be easier
---
 "Before I, we sue the company in court with the support of consumers associations. "  
---
You had my full support in this and i would agree with you right before this statement.
---
All my friends rushed to 60 and I’m left behind leveling on my own
---
This post makes me happy^^
---
Shadow panther. You’re welcome. Make sure to thank him profusely on discord.
---
It’s not much but it’s honest work.
---
[beached as](https://youtu.be/ZdVHZwI8pcA)
---
You need an off tank, and the two of you have to be top threat at all times.  When one of you gets banished (and deep slumber is a banish), he will go to the next highest threat and eventually banish them.  
---
Your DPS will have to throttle themselves to stay out of the top 2, because they will otherwise get eaten pretty quickly.
---
Wait why would he use mana shield rather than frost barrier?
---
Need at least one dps at 52+, possibly need and offtank or someone with great kiting ability.
---
Wise words. The BiS is very much blown out of proportion. Having BiS helps ofc, but is not that vital as many wants to paint it.
---
If i just upgraded and can only get two waters per cast, I'll just ask the healer if he's ok with the lower rank drinks in order to lose less time on preparations.
---
9 times out of 10 they agree and we save like 5 mins before pulling.
---
i’ve remade my character and started over for so many stupid reasons. Hell I re-made my level 46 rogue because I wanted to be a human female. A lot happier now but just got back up to 33 last night. I’ve also remade because I wanted to change server, class, etc. I’d be 60 and geared by now if I would’ve stuck to my first character. I’m also so so so tired of the 1-30 grind lol, i’ve done it like 10 times now. 
---
If you’re not happy then absolutely remake your character. Classic progresses pretty slow. It’s not even phase 2 yet. You have PLENTY of time and you’ll be playing that character for a long time so you’re gonna want to make sure you’re happy with it.
---
The other day I was questing peacefully surrounded by 4 horde players who were non aggro in STV until one shaman decided to attack me. That resulted in me getting camped and forcing me to rage quit for the afternoon. Later that night after a nap and a few beers, I logged back on with the sole purpose of exacting revenge on the horde.  I rode through just about every inch of that zone killing every horde I saw. 10 lvls lower?  Don’t care. Blame the Shaman from earlier.
---
Thats why voidwalker shields exist. Bad lock
---
Voted by who dipshit? Brits? Lmao.
---
It is avoidable but it happens so quick most people would still fall off the chain
---
Because a mage that isn't braindead would know how much he can handle, or at least have ice-block ready. If he priest had run in and cast a single heal, he would've been next. Especially if it was PW: Shield.
---
Better to let the mage die and wait for the tank to pick the adds up.
---
29 undead war 47 rogue 38 hunter
---
Yeah they're cheap as fuck atm, I bought a few cheap stacks and made 40 stonescale oil out of them to sit in my bank for a few months.
---
had a mage give me 14 water and was told to split it with the group
---
Wow amazing, you're a healer too? Wicked man! I guess you're right then!
---
/s
---
No, you're still wrong.
---
No, its way easier if the tank just pulls everything.
---
kirtonos?
---
Stop trying to give water to Rogues and Warriors and you might get more people accepting. ^^^/s
---
Leeeeroooy Magekiiiins
---
If you’re pulling 6 mobs at a time you’re going to get your ass beat like every other class in the game. If you want to be able to do everything with a spec you can go play BFA. If you want to aoe farm in classic then you go aoe, and if you want to single target focus then you do that. There’s no double dipping in classic unless you’re fury tanking, or blowing loads of gold on engineering.
---
Assuming prot warrior? because prot pally can farm really well :P
---
Level 60 classic WoW accounts go for a lot more than 200 USD. Atleast on Firemaw EU, they sell for 400-700 USD
---
I farmed it for like 3 Hours killing every Defias is see and didn't get it.
---
Later that night I ran my first dungeon ever with an amazing group and it dropped after like 10-15 minutes in :)
---
Congrats on your fashion upgrade m8 :)
---
It's...... Beautiful.  :')
---
Healcomm allows you to see the amount of incoming heals on a player before the heal is complete.
---
The library may be packaged up inside of ElvUI.
---
I see you play on whitemane. Fuck SMOrc
---
HMU when you have 69.4.20
---
Why would you ever run away from a mage? Get in close and go cat form to deal damage and spell pushback.
---
I agree. I was completely new to wow, started "late" about 3 weeks ago (am now lv 37) and didn't know non-pvp was an option. I was expecting people to play "fair" for the most part. Naive, I know.
---
I don't mind the occasional random ganking by a passing lv ?? player (it's maybe a 5 minute run back to your corpse but when they purposefully make you fail quests that only spawn once per hour and camp quest NPCs and/or corpses in low-level areas it's just a level of unpleasantness that I don't understand. Even if you have lv 60 friends, it takes a while for them to get to you.
---
Do those people really have such sad lives that they don't have anything better to do?
---
Not sure I will reroll on a PvE server or just stop altogether.
---
It might be different for different servers - I am/will have been on Stonespine.
---
Not good enough, I’m going to need the whole incident drawn in a series of MS Paint bitmaps, printed on pelts, and turned into a flip book.
---
&gt; since you can apply curses to multiple enemies, you can hit them all with the curse of (recklessness?) and just AoE them down without worry of them trying to make a break for it.
---
1.5 seconds per enemy. 15 seconds for pack of 10 mobs.   
---
Mage can aoe down two packs in that time or something.. 
---
It's good to put CoR on mob, fear it. CoW/CoA when you want it to run, CoR when you want it to bounce back. Because warlock fear sends the mob flying to the other continent at flying epic mount speed.
---
They do, I know plenty of people who have had names reported and changed.
---
What do you expect them to do? Trawl 10000s of chat logs and ban people talking in the wrong way?
---
You guys have absurd expectations for how these rules can be enforced.
---
It\`s a good dungeon tank who can turn into a half-decent DPS and has brez+inervate+can heal if shit hits the fan.
---
you miss the point. if its a boe, everyone needs it since you can simply change it into another boe you want via auction house.
---
The only time I get slightly annoyed is when everyone is stopped to drink and the warlock is life tapping and doesn't use any food afterwords while remaining a 100 hp.
---
Technically I'm only 34, because I started leveling a mage (got to 38) when I hit 29 and then some other low level characters, but I get your point.
---
Unique comment, it gets better after the 300th time seeing it.
---
But that idea is contradictory, and you're getting caught up in semantics and missing my point.  There isn't really anything intrinsic about high single target damage and one cc... Trying to talk about class-specific utilities that benefit a party, and whether or not you use that as something to provide value to the group dynamic. So there are some classes that don't have special skills, bummer. 
---
So then let's talk about those classes from earlier that do. 
---
By your logic (post history), every mage should sell their food/water, warlocks should only soulstone themselves, and rogues get to open all locked chests in a 5-man group dungeon? This is the idea which I'm trying to speak to, and it is the idea that I disagree with that I believe makes OP the AH.
---
Sounds like you’re good to go!
---
The only solution is going full soviet and moving people against their will. And blizz is US-based so that wont happen.
---
What was your party composition? Having another melee DPS in the party simplifies this boss, a rogue or a DPS warrior can off tank it whilst you are asleep.
---
I’ve been struggling with making a new alt for a bit...hopefully you guys can help. I main a rogue/mage in retail and my first character is a level 38 mage. I am going to be mostly focused on PvP/BGs at endgame and the occasional dungeon (very little raiding if any). I’m torn between a warrior, priest, hunter, a shaman. 
---
I think warrior would be fun because I’ve never tanked before and I think I would enjoy that while leveling/they are strong in PvP. Hunters for ease of leveling, although I’m not sure if they get boring just auto shotting? Priests I like healing and shadow looks interesting but I already have a clothie/undead...and that leaves me with shaman which I’ve never played before so I’m kinda lost here - they look interesting and are able to heal + DPS, but are they good in WPvP/bgs? I also want a “fun” leveling experience which I know hunters are easy but feel a bit boring
---
Mages, generally, see to know better.
---
Probably comes with the glass cannon territory, lol!
---
He's a warrior and warriors can talent an extra 15%...
---
It comes with the territory.  We're used to this stuff.
---
Pretty funny, I haven’t come across this at all. Everyone’s been super nice
---
Glad to see corpses not despawning like in beta
---
So long as your characters don't run farther than 28 yds or get stuck on the way back I guess. That happen often?
---
Yeah, basically what have been my thought process as well. Thanks for your input :)
---
They’d have you heal anyway. Either way you wouldn’t get loot except the scraps from hunters.
---
Lol, quite a niche hiding spot for hide and seek in Azeroth. PS whats that minimap addon?
---
None of the boss items are worth anymore than vendor value because you can't sell them to anyone! Sounds like you are best left out of the raiding scene tbh
---
Damn you stopped pretending WoW is a hard game real quick.
---
In EVE Online when you die you permanently lost your ship and everything equipped on to it, and ships can be worth several times what an epic mount is. Hell there's mobile MMO's that are more punishing and have permanent consequences to getting attacked. Lots of games are much more difficult, Even in Minecraft you can suffer permanent consequences for dying. WoW is as carebear as an experience as it gets. Please dude
---
Fish along coast of STV  for mithril trunks and sell the contents. Maybe an hour for one round trip making an average of 10g it felt like.
---
Just have a hunter do distracting shot and run back to the main room. Feign death once the tank is back up.
---
Yea, we did the same with 3 people. It's pretty fast, but it gets tiresome when you have to do it for three people. Took us about 85 runs to get it for all three of us.
---
Orcs respects women as equals in their culture afaik.
---
Dont invite mages when your 60 to run scholo,ubrs,lbrs etc..tell them to go spell cleave the boss’s
---
It's always a UD rogue, too.
---
Yea your clothes looking different to how they are, wild wacky.  How silly to fight a dragon in  dress that's actually a shirt pfft, literally destroyed immersion. 
---
I use noggen fogger and deviate on my orc warrior when I get sick of looking at my big green ass  but changing a peice of armour to look like something else? **unacceptable**.
---
You have 300 negative posts on Reddit? Sorry bro.
---
At this point I literally have mules for
---
Just for $$$ fish
---
Just for cloth. Will need a second cloth only mule at this rate...
---
Just for metal/stone
---
Just for herbs
---
Just lvl 5 to DE all my cheap greens
---
I like knowing I can instantly switch professions on a whim or meet market demands for shadow oil or winter squid whenever it happens
---
I've made 10 chars on my server, out of which:
---
1 is a bank
---
1 is my main
---
1 is a lv 10 alt
---
one is a lv3 that might become an alt
---
the rest are for name reservation.
---
So basically, 1!
---
Do you have any clue what having full rage al the time does
---
You're goddamn right it is.
---
Interesting. I'll have to look up a guide for more info, thanks pal!
---
No but a lot of groups your xp/h in arm is better than Cath. I was trying to only do Cath with level 40+ people. If you have 3-4 mages though you can get away with lower levels and still speed clear. Just cause you can pull so much at once.
---
I think QoL comes in two parts.
---
Shortcuts and interface, most gameplay shortcuts should be avoided (other than keychains), but ui improvements could be good.
---
How much gold and how long?
---
I know yours was just a dream but it definitely does happen in game.
---
I'm doing some heavy mithril / iron farming ATM and people get so entitled over a node that they think is theirs. 
---
I've had level 35s rage at me becasue as a level 60 I can mine areas without aggroing any of the mobs. This is completely not allowed according to some lower level players.
---
And then there is the classic when you are fighting a mob and someone steals your node. Infuriating, but as a farmer, I do have to say that gathering etiquette is optional and there are no official rules about whats allowed and what isn't.
---
WHY DIDN'T HE FROST NOVA??
---
We didn't poach anybody lol, your 60's left because they wanted to raid
---
LGBT people wanting more representation in fiction led to a minor change in a warlock spell in a re-release of an old MMO? A change that has absolutely nothing to do with “PC culture”?
---
This is some of the more extreme mental gymnastics I’ve seen recently, wow.
---
Yeah that or what I'm a bit more worried of is just always being in catch up mode. I.E. I get to 60, friends have already cleared MC a few times and are nearing the next tier, and effectively I can never catch up truly.
---
I've done it the other way around, actually.
---
In actual Vanilla I was the most meandering, easily-distracted, unmotivated leveller you ever did see. I'd explored the entire world before level 30, because I wanted to go wandering; I stopped levelling entirely for about a month when I discovered STV PvP; I stopped to help friends who started later than me catch up; I levelled several professions by abandoning and learning new ones as I found out more about them.
---
I don't remember my /played to 60 but it would've been *outrageously* high.
---
This time round I took it fairly seriously and was 60 after a little over 8 days /played. Not mixmaxed efficient by any means but certainly efficient enough to be reasonable.
---
That's not called tanking. That's called, a dps getting aggro.
---
🦀
---
I don’t know if if it is  in our version of the game but there used to be invulnerable mobs in the zone south of swamp of sorrows
---
If you played vanilla, you're a old man.  Were the geriatric player base.  Were the guys who take forever to cross the street.  Sure there are some genetic freaks doing yoga but us normal people are on the slow roll.
---
Had a rdruid as our healer and we made it through unscathed though there was a couple clutch moments but overall everyone did really well.  I mind you most of us were 52+ with one person being 50.
---
Oh god I was running ZF and a warlock kept hellfiring as well. I wouldn't have aggro and he just kept spamming to our priest "shield"
---
I felt so bad for the healer. Also life tapped and kept mana at 80%+ the entire dungeon
---
A decent chunk of the gear you get disenchants for more than it vendors for.
---
I do it because i know it makes them unbelievably mad. They cant escape, i have an epic mount. They have to log out or take res sickness. 
---
The appeal is to make someone else really mad. Because thats super fun. Its a pvp server after all. That doesn't mean just fair fights.
---
You've also gotta remember a bunch of rogue skills require daggers. I'm a swordboi.
---
Yeah, you’re going to be hit by 3 separate meteors the second you step out of the house.
---
Also, was this a guild group?  I would imagine this could create some animosity.  Next time you log in:
---
You:  Hey guys!
---
Guild leader:  What’s that supposed to mean?!
---
*Removed from guild*
---
I actually met a gnome mage in pirates in Tanaris who tried to pull half the camp and tried to do classical icemage. I dont fight alliance unless provoked nor do i kill lower levels but that gnome mage got a proper cheap shot with some stabby stab and /spit at the end.  
---
Then again not all mages are bad. I still 100% firmly believe that spellcleavers are tiny minority of server pop, just the loudest one. I never had problem to do classic dungeon quest runs and such. And you wont believe me but i actually met a firemage! :-O
---
Booty Bay missed ship distractions look like innocent funfair now.
---
Weird how everyone in this thread thinks they arent the problem yet every group has at least one of these guys...
---
*Time to start my gaming session. "Hey friendly mage, could you make couple stack of water"*
---
*Plays game. Be really careful with water as I don't want to run out.*
---
*Session ends with 40 mage waters in bags*
---
Every... single.. time
---
Literally because we're the only guild currently raiding on Benediction
---
Is there a race/class combo that you know for a fact that you prefer?  If not, no matter what you choose might end up bothering you in some way.  My first character was a tauren and I hated how boots/helms never looked right on them.  They also have that weird hunch back maine thing on their back....   
---
You could also hold out hope that they may allow race changes and recustomizations in the future.  I can definitely see them offering that, and paid character transfers sooner than later in classic.
---
Yeah, that's a definite worry. I'm too addicted to quit, though, I believe.
---
Same reason Horde does it I assume.
---
Yeah no, I'm not drinking from zero every pull. 
---
Shield is for damage mitigation, you cannot skip it until t3.
---
It was a pug, and everybody rolled need. 87 is now my lucky number.
---
Also, I am the GM of my guild :D
---
You did a killer job man, weakauras is fun and the more you fiddle with the better you get. I always get jealous of Birgs designs. Grass is always greener!

I’m a level 33 rogue, coming up on 40. my professions are Mining/engineering. (Sort of wish i would’ve went Skinning/Mining instead but oh well). What’s some good farming techniques or efficient ways I could start making more gold? Mining of course, but anything else? Any mining tips, or certain mobs to farm/pick pocket? etc.
---
Do you have any clue what your original point was
---
brilliant
---
I think this is a fair point. Some classes can fill too many roles xD where would you draw the line for priests or warriors?
---

---
Would force him to come to me rather than going for an eternal chase that I feel like I would lose. 
---
If the mage would just stand there and tank me that’s fine but I don’t expect any to do so. 
---
I believe most mages would be able to kite me to the point I’m oom faster than he dies.
---
Stealing resources from a max level player on a PvP server - that's like the least dick-ish move you can do. Literally everyone who ever killed someone who's just leveling and had no chance of fighting back for no reason (so really, most people probably) are far bigger dicks.
---
Pay those people no mind.
---
&gt; 1.Is it fun to play holy priest at lvl 60? I only healed in Legion as a druid restoration.
---
Personally, I liked healing as a Disc/Holy spec in endgame.  Depending on how often you raid, you may get burned out though, which I think most of the hardcore raiders would have happen.  They'd have excellent healers who were always in the main raid group, and eventually, they'd get burned out from going day after day for the sole purpose of DKP accumulation.  We had a few turn shadow, start Pvping randomly, then just disappear for months if not for good after a while.  
---
&gt; 2.How is the wpvp for a holy priest?
---
Actually pretty good.  When I played in vanilla, I actually PVP'd as a healing spec, and would be able to beat most other players.  Granted, it was me trying to keep my health up and kite, while letting my DoT do it's thing.  In group PVP (World of BG), expect to be the 'tank'.  Flat out, sometimes it's really not fun to be stunned, feared and other means of CC'd in a wave as they try to DPS you down to nothing in 10seconds, but if you got a good group that protects you, makes it much better.
---
&gt; 3.Is it really easier to find a group as a healer?
---
So, if this was a question about Retail, I'd say yes.  Though, with classic, people who are more aggressive tend to get a group.  I knew DPS who would be back to back groups with ease because they were putting it together and were aggressively getting people through chat, whisper, trade, whatever means to build the group.  It's not a Q like it is in retail where you get racked and stacked by position.  So, reality, if you want to build a group and put in the effort to get people, probably a little easier than a DPS, but if you expect to just be picked up, there are days I receive no whispers because other healers are more aggressively advertising themselves, and I'm not that motivated when I'm questing.
---
&gt; 4.Are hunters really bad late in the game? What does this imply?
---
No.  All the times I raided in endgame, we'd have a hunter pulling mobs and running CC.  Their reset on agro is nice as well, so they can go balls to the walls.  They have a lot of good utility for 5mans, 10mans, even up to 40mans.  To be fair, there are a lot of stupid hunters out there, which give the whole a bad name.  Don't assume you're the puller, sometimes the tanks prefer to do it.  Communication is key.  Oh, and dismissing your pet before you jump is also recommended.
---
&gt; 5.Is it really difficult to find a group as a hunter?
---
Goes back to my comment about healers finding groups.
---
&gt; 6.Do you have any other comments that could help me make a choice?
---
Playing a clothie can be rather aggravating at times, but of all them, priests are pretty solid due to inner fire.  PVP, it can be frustrating, but in PVE for dungeons and such, they're fun to play.  It's more of a regen game since you tend to not want to heal nonstop, and instead do it in bursts.  I'll heal my tank when the heal will be used entirely to prevent overheal, then instant cast renew on him for added effect, then sit back and regen til the same situation comes up.  it's a more passive playstyle, but, you are on point for group survival.
---
Bubble yourself just before the sleep goes out and you'll avoid it.  As you know, you can't bubble during it.

Go into your spellbook. Look for a racial ability called "Hardiness". Take a long hard look at that ability and try to tell yourself a sexy looking robe beats that.
---
I was happy to. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
It's impossible to get it by 40. There are just not enough quests, and the repeatable Runecloth turn-in is available at the late 50s
---
The whole item drop system is luck based. Do you pay others in your group a fair share when you get lucky and some bop you desperately need drops? No you don't, you get lucky and get your item or you don't and get nothing. Hell, some bosses don't even have a chance to drop stuff for me, but I do them anyways because some other guy in the party needs something from them.
---
One of the main attracting points of games like wow is getting that drop that you need. It would be much less interesting, if every boss just dropped some amount of gold and you'd buy your items from a store. Which is one of the main critiques of badge systems.
---
So no, I don't think getting that epic drop is the same as getting a check in the mail.
---
From my experience just kill emp without killing princess and its good.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Both
---
lmfao
---
what a goober
---
That’s some damned odd behavior right there.
---
Can someone explain me what is this "focus target" thing ? I don't remember such a thing (or was too noobish).
---
Mage can pull then ice block to nicely group everything to be AoEd, perhaps the group wanted it.
---
Cries in feral
---
That's wayy too high of a level range.  Our group stopped cath by 40 because the experience was ass.
---
There are a couple good quests in ZF. Especially Ancient egg questline. And that +15 agi ring.
---
Level 18?
---
I wanna make a Tank Paladin, does anyone have some kind of guide for it? Like talents, what stats to prioritize, which skills to learn etc.
---
Why not? I wouldn't kick a night elf out of bed just because Busty McBooze and her Fear Ward showed up.
---
it is in classic.
---
its my last name why
---
??? Why would I start a boss fight without 100% of each? If a tank pulls enough mobs to die on trash my slight difference in hp or mana won't matter. Your hypothetical situation doesn't exist unless I'm running with a bunch of idiots, in which case I probably would've left before the first boss
---
I am on Zandalar, he is part of a minuscule micro minority of RP fundamentalist. Thanksfully almost no one view the "rules" the way he does.
---
For the record, I don't RP but I really enjoy the friendlier atmosphere of the server, and I love stumbling upon and watching people RP.
---
This guy's just some nutcase.
---
We had mouse over

Casters are very gear dependant.
---
The least gear dependant class would probably be Rogue
---
Get the addon Immersion and read all the questlines before doing the quest itself! Makes you really immerse in the world!
---
Just continue leveling.  
---
Higher level -&gt; more money earned.  
---
I got money for mount at 43, was left with 7 silver. ~5 hours later I had 30 gold in my wallet.
---
I'm using [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uoxZVGdIxzVo) build. 
---
* I've found that I barely use Seal of Righteousness, so the extra strength (=block-value) makes more sense. You could take pushback-protection if you plan to heal dungeons too.
---
* Illumination is core to healing as Holy, while Divine Favor is more "nice to have".
---
* You'll be using BoP quite a bit to save over-nuking dps, so Guardian's Favor is very useful.
---
* Reckoning vs. 1H-specialization is a bit wonky. I don't trust something inconsistent like Reckoning, especially since more Def means less getting crit, so 1H is the safer choice.
---
The build is basically a fully functional tank (you only miss out on the small improvements from Ret), while being ~90% of a full-Holy healer. Divine Favor and Holy Shock are nice to have, but your default healing rotation doesn't include HS anyway.
---
If you're a rogue, two man it with another rogue for easy 5 minute runs
---
Robe
---
Some rogues were successful in 1v1 and 1v2 situation while quite literally being naked with white vendor weapons.
---
Poor hunter
---
girls are gay cus they like boys
---
Not very high.
---
While it might seem like abilities such as Improved Totems would be worthwhile, they really aren't - they improve the totems to such a minor extent that no one cares.
---
Enhancement Shaman are also mediocre damage. Even more so once you realize that they can't use Stormstrike (debuff slot limits). For this mediocre damage, they have to risk melee range with none of the tools that standard melee dps classes bring for survival.
---
They also have significant gearing issues because Shaman gear in raids is almost strictly focused on healing. That gear which isn't strictly healing-focused buffs Elemental, not Enhancement.
---
How are people so retarded in classic? Is this because of how retail is stupid easy?
---
It does have a lovely cathedral, and Boomtown fair.
---
I like his use of zero cc
---
Yep! Think it was a couple of years ago that they said it was staged. Perhaps even earlier, but I think I found out about it then. I am terrible with flow of time but I do remember it creating a bit of a buzz when it was discussed.
---
&gt; I personally think that everyone rolling need on Rare/Epic BoEs
---
Wow, I'm very surprised to read this. I'm from a french server and I think most of the player here will not agree with this statement. But you're right, the best way to avoid this is still to discuss about it before the run.
---
Yup.
---
Have someone else tank for the first 10 seconds, then you take the boss. Ez mode from there.
---
I used my voidwalker in my group to take the sleep.
---
I would follow him and eat bread over his dead corpse and not heal that wild forgotten toenail.

I know a number of people that want this add-on banned.

So many people in this thread are worried about Pre-BiS when it's not even necessary.
---
If you're running BRD/UBRS 100+ times you gotta find something better to do. How you're not burning yourself out of the game is beyond me.
---
I love this server and the higher I get, the less stupid names I see. If I see offensive, appalling names or nonsensical ones, I report. I would love to rp more , just I don't see it much. 
---
-Whittington human holy paladin .
---
If you start to dislike your character at 40, he will never make it to 60. Just reroll. It is much better to start over and enjoy your character than force yourself to play character you dislike. Playing will become chore, you fed up and quit.
---
That's crazy, I see people saying this but after 2 ZF runs in our very early 40s, we were getting next to no XP and decided to switch to open world questing.  I couldn't imagine what it would be like in there at late 40s or even early 50s.
---
Add him to your friends and wait until he joins a guild and show them this later down the line to show them what a toxic moron he is.
---
My group 3 manned it until it dropped. You can do super fast runs of the dwarves and the trogg boss right after in about 12 minutes and you wont hit the reset timer. Took about 2 hours but I got the helmet and slow fall shield.
---
Raid Laider of 10 people, 1 Rogue, "Won".
---
I'd be curios to see if anyone else actually rolled against him.
---
IMO warriors are the worst choice for you, they need a team to shine in PVP and they require a lot of gearing up, if you don't plan on raiding or grinding dungeons at 60 this will be tough for you.
---
Shaman are an offensive support class or an RNG slot machine depending on how you build them, totems, healing, and high damage magic abilities make them fairly versatile. Not sure how much gear they need to pop off in pvp as I mostly play alliance.
---
Hunters are probably the best without gear. They take a lot of skill to play against people who know what they are doing. The pet hits like a truck and leveling is easy.
---
Priest is good, healing fine in greens and face melting in blues. Fills the support roll your factions unique class doesn't. Swiss army knife heals and support abilities.
---
Oh, is that the problem? Thank you so much for this great tip!
---
Now that I don't give my water to a Warrior or Rogue the Priests and Paladins will accept my water..
---
I've played wow for many years and have never used focus target.
---
What is this
---
I find that fair enough since it's not a need for them and they're getting something out of it. Refusing to give the healer water slows the group down and is just cunty.
---
I tried this to give a rogue who hadn’t done the quest the boots and it didn’t work at all. Just gave an error message along the lines of that player is not eligible or can’t loot that item. I’m pretty sure that rogue thought I was trying to scam him but he didn’t even know you needed the princess Q.
---
Have you actually confirmed this?
---
By questing I found all the pages and I usually only miss 1 or 2 I just buy off others it’s pretty easy imo
---
Same with the shredder pages
---
Look who is whining about someone making a reasonable request. The only exception I ask for is when you have no control and no way to mitigate it.
---
In front of a dungeon? Take your guild buddies with you.
---
AFK? Go to a safe place.
---
Alt char? That doesn't even make any sense.
---
You can't really expect a low-level player to always have a squad of lv 60 players around as bodyguards just because some a-holes have such sad lives they have nothing better to do than continually make someone else fail a quest.
---
But you do you. People always have the choice to be dicks. I guess you made yours.

I really hope this post was made in satire, but something tells me it wasn't.
---
Hello,
---
Aimed shot can crit, and it will.
---
Maybe your weapon skill was very low, and then you get a penalty of crit, but I don't think it is this.
---
You take your melee critical strike chance and you add any crit bonuses from gear.
---
Assuming around 318 agi (6% crit) , +5% crit from talents, +10% crit from gear, +2% from mongoose, you will end up with 23% crit. Crit from gear can get even higher, in the 13-15% range, while your agi will rise to around 500 during naxx. So expect crit to go up to around 30% endgame.
---
I’ve had zero problems tanking as a Paladin and I’ve done every dungeon except Scholo/Strat now.  Protection all the way to 58 and will keep going until 60.  My guild said I’ve done such a good job tanking LBRS/UBRS that they want me to tank raids as an OT instead of switching to healmode.
---
It’s not like you need 40 people to do MC or Ony right now anyway.
---
Exclusing the fact that they have hands-down the worst racials of any priest race...
---
Terrible melee animations, terrible stealth animation, 2 terrible casting animations.
---
They can look decent in some armour sets while standing static. Thats about it.
---
What's up with all the retarded post with people taking a picture of their monitor? What the actual fuck? Assuming you're on Windows 10 like everyone else, press Shift+CTRL+Windows, take the screenshot, open reddit, post a new link and press ctrl+v...
---
Wow...meanwhile, over here on Pagle, we get free food (if it's a mage), buffs, "ty", and all other manner of positive vibes when healing or buffing randos. :\\
---
Hell, even the opposing faction players will lend a hand.
---
Fishing truly does bring us all together. :D
---
Tell me about it. I'm not really a fan of other class choices in retail for dwarves like shaman. But mate should absolutely be an option for them. Choice of human or gnome for both mage and warlock just turns me away from those classes. Priest is about as close as you could get I guess. If classic+ introduced race /combos dwarf mage for sure!
---
Why would a mage ever come to you though? They want to nuke you at range. And unless your a balance druid, you have to be up close to do damage to them.
---
All's fair in Farm and War.  
---
As a UD Mage/Rogue I support your Rouge ways.  Did I say Rogue, I meant Dickhead.
---
&gt; Why would I start a boss fight without 100% of each?
---
That's my point...? Unless you're expecting the healer to fill you up, we are in agreement.
---
Do you?  Forget block values, just the raw armor will mitigate a big chunk of damage.  
---
They’re not necessary until about Mara/ST because before that enemies hit like wet noodles and you WANT to be taking enough damage so you aren’t rage starved, but it is coming at the cost of the healer’s mana.  
---
There’s a lot of confusion going around because everyone realizing you want to not be using a shield 10-47 doesn’t then realize you need to dial back your incoming damage at 50.  Going full arms/fury and then picking up the threat talents in Prot doesn’t mean you can keep using a 2-hander/dual wielding forever.  
---
Managing your incoming damage is a balancing act, and you have to adjust one way or the other.  We need fewer people going to BRD saying “I’m a fury tank” and making life difficult because they didn’t figure out they still need mitigation when they face tank 5 dwarves or two of the big elementals.
---
It's DM and DiM to me, always has been ;s
---
LEROOOOOOOOOY!!!
---
Don’t drink to full. I get you were probably paying attention to chat but the positioning was too bad (run up further and then drink) and be rdy to stop drinking.
---
You want to have the party on a leash. Your heal range is pretty big, deaths like this can easily be avoided on your part.
---
But yeah, ideally a warrior pulls these with demo shout.
---
If that's happened on my feral bear druid I'd just found another group in less that 30 seconds. Why even post about it, unless you want some spellcleave AoE mage haters karma?
---
To aggro the non aggressive scarabs. I’ve had to do it too (Frost mage) depending on the tank
---
You definitely can do damage to her.  We usually have someone offtank: I (healer) stand in the middle, and tank has emperor at max range one side of me, and off-tank has princess max range on other side of me.  
---
If your dps is on point and can kill him fast/counterspell her it's fine without an offtank too.
---
Good job. I also returned to the same place to finish level 60 at, which is winterfall furbolgs.
---
Fury tanking is closer to smth like this: [https://de.classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/2-05050104405010051-052501005](https://de.classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/2-05050104405010051-052501005)

Wrong, I have specifically said I give it away just like lockpicking in trade cities and my complaint was the fact most people don't even bother to say thank you. I also said that a tip would be nice now and then even if its 10s compared to the 3g+ you're saving.
---
Don't try to misconstrue what I say to make me look like an arsehole, I do plenty for my server while expecting nothing in return. What my post history says is:
---
1 . I invite so people don't have to wait for named mobs to respawn
---
2. I have stopped questing/skilling to provide food/water plenty of times and barely get a thank you let alone 1c tip 
---
3. I advertise and unlock lockboxes for free whenever I'm in a trade city even though I'm maxed, once again, often for people who can't even be bothered to type ty after I wait 5 minutes for them to come to me
---
4. I roll for chests even when I unlock
---
I still fail to see how a rogue and mage being able to prune two mobs is not a party benefit, sounds to me like you only consider something that either saves or makes you money to be a utility.
---
Thousands players have done this.
---
Downvote me if ya want but OP needs to hear it.
---
No one cares.
---
Don't worry. He got triggered and he won't admit to it. I've re-read your conversation and there's nothing wrong, rude, or misleading in what you said.
---
That was before 1.12 patch they cant do it in classic
---
\+ spell power &gt; spirit &gt; int &gt; stam for leveling.

 /moo
---
Insta sb procs are here to disagree with you
---
As a tank, I'll let a few aggro pulls go with some taunts. But if I keep seeing someone pulling aggro with a bunch of high threat skills .01 seconds after I pull, I just let them die. Sometimes they learn, sometimes they don't.
---
POTENTIALLY GAMEBREAKING BUG DISCOVERED IN WOW CLASSIC!!!
---
r u upset?
---
Never jump on Elevators.
---
What raid has an elevator up front?  Is it AQ? Serpent Shrine Cavern? I don't remember anymore. I spent the whole first part of whatever raid it was rezzing people. EVERYTIME.
---
Not to be a dick here, but the kind of post OP is making is precisely the reason this discussion never leads anywhere.
---
The space between bank and AH is quite literally one street in one of the most busy locations in WoW. It's absolutely reasonable to expect that people aren't RPing there. RPing next to the auction house is *literally* like trying to have a sunbath next to the London Stock Exchange.
---
It has always been the case that there were certain high commerce and high traffic areas where RP just wasn't a thing. And certain people would do the occasional "lol" when they saw people RP try between a metric fuckton of traders and chat spam. 
---
To complain about toons at the bank having the name "BankX" and referring to the Naming Policy is *literally* the type of pedantic nonsense that makes roleplayers seem petty and insecure. And I am saying that as someone who has been roleplaying for 14 and LARPing for ten years: if I see another conversation about something someone does for fun that might be slightly OOC be discussed to death because *technically it's not RP*, I'm going to throw up.
---
That's how it's always been. You always had small areas where RP wasn't done and OOC business was more prevalent. While saying what I am saying might be selfish, and I completely agree, reporting a gnome who is called "Bankgnome" who is standing around in the bank and minding his own business "to enforce the naming policy" is literally just trying to be a dick because the rules allow you to.
---
I mean sure we're in agreement about that, but keep in mind that you never said anything  about "before boss fights" or "in case shit hits the fan" . You sounded just like another healer whining about 70% lock hp in between random trash mobs that are zero threat
---
There's literally a section of the ToS and EULA concerning RP server rules.  Just because you might not have read them, it doesn't mean the rules aren't there.
---
Even with that gear some boss’s are not going to be a cakewalk for sure
---
The amount of wrong in this comment is strong.
---
ZF is 43 MINIMUM, as in mobs will be orange if you are 43. No way in hell you started ZF BEFORE 43 and then found it to be a waste when you finally started getting close to the actual level of the instance.
---
Complete bullshit.
---
I am sorry but this is wrong. Most top guilds run it with nearly blue equiped tanks.

Damn right, it used to be a rite of passage among newbie rogues on my server back in vanilla.

Went and got ours with my rogue leveling buddy soon as we both hit 10.

Came here to say the same thing basically. As tempting as it is to switch back into kitty and finish them off quickly chances are you'll end up dead long before then. 
---
Charges + Stuns combined with travel form shifting and constant healing will usually be enough to outlast most mages.
---
Most of the enchant mats are worth more than the components. The exception generally being weapons and certain plate pieces

Hey! I have my druid tanking main at 60, which is mainly bis besides 2 items. (Got super lucky with raid and dungeon drops) I do only have one profession, but really don't feel like leveling a profession to 300, especially as I suck at making gold. So I was thinking of making an alt, the thing is, I've always played a druid in retail, but hybrids in retail and in classic are very different. That's where I struggle to pick an alt, I'm contemplating mage or warrior, because mages are pretty nice for pvp which is the main reason I play classic, and so are warriors in a group environment. Mages farm gold pretty nicely too. The issue is, I don't really like casting, and I love mobility. Could you guys help me out here?
---
Priorities:
---
1. PVP, I love all forms of pvp, including wpvp in small groups.
---
2. Mobility and general fun factor, I enjoy being able to 1v2 a bit, which is why im hesitant about warrior for example.
---
3. Viability, I'd love to play boomkin if it wasn't as scuffed as it is. (Hybrid resto balance it is for my main, for example)
---
4. You may have noticed I came across slightly hardcore, I don't know what happened but god did I go through stuff for my main quickly, not that I mind, but I heavily slowed down once my guild went raiding, I won't play this much anymore. I'd like it to be a good char for long term enjoyment.
---
6. I NEED GOLD, aka, I need to be able to farm decently well.  
---
**Please help me choose an alt**
---
Unfortunately, that is wrong.
---
Mage is the new huntard
---
MadDog is spot on.
---
A BOE is gold, and the entire group is entitled to roll on gold.
---
If you need a BOE, go buy one.
---
Could be rping that she knew him before becoming Forsaken... they all used to be human, remember?
---
I must agree with this. I was told the community on RPPVP servers are more mature but so far I have only observed the opposite. I keep getting harassed by others and most don't even RP.
---
The community is extremely toxic in zandalaar tribe and I'm going to quit soon if it remains that way.
---
because we finally have enough servers without a queue? its blizzards fault the non rpers went to a rp realm, they should fix their own mistakes.
---
I have about 6 days of played on this server, on alliance and horde
---
I have seen maybe 2 instances of people harassing or insulting people who RP
---
If people harrass and insult you, report them and block them
---
You have absurd expectations that people should all play just like you, not every one is going to RP super hardcore around the clock, this is true of all RP servers . 
---
Is your experience really miserable because not every one is RPing hard enough? Block those that harrass and find an RP guild and you will have a good experience.
---
Whats wrong with people wanting to have a revenge of class’s that didnt need invited you in the leveling process because it was not optimal?
---
For firering Wand 😂
---
You can do 5 man's just fine, raids maybe as an off tank on some fights. But prot is a bad talent tree, As you need to get crit.
---
You know who else was the GM of their guild?  Julius Caesar.
---
What? Leeroy Magekins? Just no.
---
But not really.
---
the idea is to level together from scratch, I have a lvl 60 on Shazzrah so i can pretty easily buy some cheap gear for both of us. If you wanna try this I'd recommend going on Shazzrah from scratch
---
Sounds like you got jebaited. No, Syndicate mobs never gave rep for Ravenholdt. Dont know why the guides would state that.
---
&gt; I don't think you would make it even with a mount
---
Can't mount on the Booty Bay docks. But you can on the ship for some reason.
---
The more rage a warrior has, the more threat he has. The shorter the fight in raids.
---
Nearly every top guild runs with a fury tank at this point, since it's a lot easier on your healers due to the fight being 50% as long.
---
Just as an example.
---
There are rules, and for the most part they are enforced.
---
OP just has a very out of touch expectation of what Blizzard can/will do to force people to RP in a way that is satisfactory to them.
---
You horde or ally on Pagle!? Tis my residence as well
---
Also great for boosting melee dps on target through armor reduction.
---
You are not sorry.
---
However I don't care what top guilds do, you turn up to 5man without a shield to tank, either you or me will leave. I'm not spending an hour for 30 minute run
---
People pay for tanks/heals all the time lol
---
Hellfire agro is insane. I swear a mage can half health the mobs and I do 2 ticks of hf and still pull agro xD

Sometimes we have to remember the knowledge of the ancients
---
Don't use renew, it sucks.
---
Oh, nice, devilsaur leather, that will be around 7g on AH on Horde, 5g on Ally.
---
but...no ice block
---
This, so few people think about it, but it's viable.
---
Magetards are the new huntards
---
&gt; Warlocks just get to have priorities over paying for a mount.
---
Would you argue that someone who joins groups but only buys spells useful for soloing is a good player and has good priorities?
---
If you only want to buy solo skills, then stick to soloing where you won't be a liability to your group compared to someone that made some effort. And there's really less excuse for a warlock who has 100g to work with that most other classes don't.
---
People who "prioritize" like that are hurting themselves too. They aren't going to get an opportunity to learn where and when to use those situational skills. That's part of what differentiates the good players from the mediocre or bad ones.
---
I feel like I’ve only ever been kicked out of groups for this same exact situation *by* mages.
---
And here we see, the greater spotted Common basement dweller. Sporting a neckbeard as large as his stomach, this feral aggressive keyboard warrior views itself as some kind of deity. In all truthfulness though, the world just /pity these creatures.
---
Also just to be clear, I can absolutely 1000% guarantee the this guy is dogshit in a fair fight, hell even if he had a major gear advantage, he would get violated In ways that would remind him of that time with his uncle.
---
That's fine but if done properly, the recipient of the pointer could be grateful for having been told about the correction. 
---
Imagine being kind enough to help make sure an internet stranger never makes the same mistake again!
---
Was it a Hunter on his Elite Quest?
---
I wish I had recorded our runs just so I could make you look ridiculous right now.  We had one member who was 44 as he levelled up getting the mallet quest, one who as was 43, and myself and one other were 41.  I don't remember what the one pug guy we got as a tank was, but yeah, it's not bullshit.
---
IIRC to make it work you need to be constantly moving your mouse left/right, even if just a tiny amount, to keep the camera pointing in your intended direction.
---
It was shawn of the dead reference.
---
This. Couple weeks ago I was grinding in that harpy cave in 1k needled. I think I did the quest in there where you break some chests and a couple of waves of harpies spawn with at least 5 different groups. Gets them outta there faster and I wont be surprised by their waves spawning on top of me
---
"The healer let the hp of the party hit 0"
---
“Goddamnit Leroy...”
---
Being forced to role-play at all times would be terrible. Akin to power gaming. Sometimes you want to play casually, maybe watch a movie and not have to give full attention all of the time to WoW.
---
As long as you don't disrupt anyone else's role-playing, this should be fine, if not the standard.
---
alliance gets so screwed over in classic no flight paths long as runs to sm missing items from dungeons.
---
He can voice his complaints all he wants.
---
The guy thinks he can sue blizzard because they arent forcing people to rp to his liking.
---
I wish him all the best.
---
I see a lot of people rping around crossroads etc. Sitting around campfires talking in character. And I see it in some of the major cities as well.
---
General Chat / Trade / LFG are pretty much a "no rp zone" but that kind of makes sense since there isn't much RP reason for them to exist.
---
I certainly wouldn't describe the server as hostile to RP. It's just not the main focus.
---
DREAMS FADE AWAY AND ALL HOPE TURNS TO DUST!
---
Yea, I guess it's better to complain about something that's 100% within your own control and only happens because you insist on doing things wrong.
---
*cough*
---
Omg. I think it's you. Alamak?
---
Spec prot with consecrate, ret aura, good shield and aoe 5+ mobs at a time with as many thorns effects you can find. You need the gear for it though.
---
This will only write the name of the quest

WHEN MILLIONS BURN
---
It's about the only way to get devilsaur. I approve.
---
Lol what? Rogues are literally made for pvp
---
isn't that at least lvl 25 or something? He was talking about up to lvl 22
---
wtf I haven't heard that place mentioned in about the same amount of time. haha
---
Trust me, i wish i could do wired too, it’s just my computer is set up in my bedroom up stairs while the router is a whole floor below me. I’m going to try to just move my computer next to it for an hour and test the wired connection to hopefully narrow down my range of issues.
---
I actually had no idea that Reddit's submit page let you just paste what you want to post directly. TIL.
---
That's quite subjective. I prefer all of those visual quirks to the human male versions, for example.
---
That's your opinion, but I personally find the millennial "pull 3-5x as many mobs with proper aoe coordination" extremely boring when you can instead play with your friends and not sound like a total jackass.
---
Think about it as follows: you primarily quest, and when you get an invite and your group is ready then you stop and run to brd.
---
I had fond memories of that place from back when I started playing. Last night's run was a nightmare, 2 hours long wipe fest all because of a warlock and mage that could t keep it in their pants. Well it was mostly the warlock, the mage wasn't quite as bad.
---
Goodbye gold, my old friend.
---
The amount of Runecloth this will require is just insane and since I refuse to buy this fugly Ram I think I will just walk forever. Do you know if the Wintersaber quests already exist?
---
you will also need about 1000g extra (or farming a few hundred stacks of runecloth) just so you can buy the 900g mount. 
---
1 stack runecloth nets you 50 reputation.
---
you now still need 31660 rep, so this will be 634 STACKS of runecloth, just sain
---
Took me like 70 runs to get my mainhand... I saw felstriker drop twice and the carapace once before o got the mainhand or the offhand. I managed to snag one felstriker tho.
---
I don't ask. I just give lower level. Once I can do 4 per cast I'll ask
---
The richest of thorium veins
---
Yes, I was able to give loot from princess to my healer during a run I did a few days ago.
---
THE CURTAIN HAS FALLEN
---
Was this on Atiesh? If so, he's in my guild!  Good dude.
---
Definitely a bad Warlock.
---
What I did when tanking in TBC is friend any dps or healer I like running with. After a while, you don't need to join any random groups.
---
Night elves. Their men just sleep all the time.
---
Oh okay, mis understood what you were wanting. You want it to give an actual link..
---
LOST TO THE WORLD AS THEY PERISH IN FLAMES
---
Lol I only post phone pics because I don’t have to open reddit on my comp in the middle of gaming possible missing more...I only have 1 monitor
---
This right here. I quit around 44-45 as a healer, just can’t stand the amount of toxic bad players who think they’re better (skill wise) than everyone else in the party. If I can spot your mistakes as a brand new player to WoW, you probably shouldn’t be a drama queen.
---
Ok and how does it impact my % exactly 2 3 4 million that's still in the 10^-4% range? Also just typed it on good and the estimate players was 2 million at launch globally.
---
Fear and respect are not the same.
---
No, do execute immediately, don't save it up.
---
Popping CD and potions on execute phase sounds good to me! But don't forget to prepot as well (to then wait for tank aggro, but _then_ dps).
---
The hamstring thing I thought was only with improved hamstring and for arms warriors.
---
&gt;Looks to me
---
big assumption based off 2 chat messages lol
---
10 year vet of WoW RP-PVP servers.
---
The roleplaying is used to incentivize and spark World PvP. Roleplaying is critical for the foundation of largescale WPvP, giving meaning behind it. Obviously, you can roleplay as much as you want, like on a normal RP server, but the end goal here really is PvP. Multiple guilds allying to form massive military campaigns and so on.
---
As such, there will be plenty of people who just PvP and do not RP. There is no way or point to stop this, its simply the nature of RP-PvP servers.
---
I can’t simulate every aspect of a fight. 
---
I just believe that if a mage decides to fight you, and you run out of range chances are that he either decides against it or tries to get you back into range. 
---
If he tries to catch up, there’s a chance he uses blink to which it’s easier for me to get back into melee range with him having that one tool less to get distance. 
---
With the HOTW build I would go for outlasting rather than a long chase. Melee if I’m in range but otherwise let a moonfire and swarm slowly eat them down with perhaps a wrath to finish them off. But it’s all situational.
---
This is why I have to say "mana" after every big pull.. which the group usually runs off anyway and then I get blamed for TPK
---
People do it in MC already. So does my guild.
---
Obviously too late now but there's no need to buy any weapons in that level bracket. WW axe takes you to 45 easy and at that point you can get one of the 2 weapons off the last boss of Uldaman.
---
They do have rules but they aren't "you must be in character all the time".
---
It's pretty much "don't harass RP people" and "don't make names that aren't rp friendly" etc etc.
---
OP is asking for an RP only server with RP only rules but such a thing doesn't exist.
---
Was coming in to say how classic is so much less toxic than retail vanilla was... but, I was only let down instead.
---
Fuck all of YOU, you beautiful amazing garbage people! See you in the raids.
---
Badlands whelps. They are level 41-43. If you can kill those fast theres money to be made. They are skinnable and drop coins.
---
 People have picked up on it though. The place is kinda contested now. It has 6 mithril spawn-points aswell so mining/skinning is very good there.
---
ohhh so toxic aahh
---
bump   
---
Looks like healbot but I couldn't make mine work. :(   
---
I'd love it if we could get the source.
---
The fact that I am (Honored) 1,341/12,000 hardly even matters, right? Or am I getting the math wrong?
---
how is asking for enforced naming policies and a proper cs unrealistic? blizzard could easily solve at least half the issue, but it seems they just don't care. there was never any love for true rp servers from blizzard, they probably won't get their shit together now.
---
Nethergarde Keep. a) quite behind in progression, b) full of small non raiding guilds, c) not so huge pop, less hardcores and preplaned accounts (added before launch), d) has Alliance dominance, e) Devilsaurs are quite freely available.
---
Dear God. He didn't even prntscrn
---
Yeah man, tank aggro and healer mana are infinitely more important in classic. The dungeon goes faster if tank keeps aggro and healer only has one target to heal. Conserves mana and sanity.
---
This is so funny. I haven't even thought about that place in like a decade, but I saw your name just now and it suddenly all came back to me.
---
That is more fun than people realise. It's even better if you can get the same person more than once. I've entertained myself with this for hours as well.
---
I mean, you're still going to need that gold for the epic mount chain.
---
He started running before he said go, which is why he was halfway out of the healer’s cast range and heals wasn’t at full mana by the time he was in danger (though, I agree, the edit makes it seem like he started running after he said go, despite the text).
---
In my experience as heals, I try to say “go” when I know I’ll have full mana by the time I’ll need to heal, accounting for reaction times. In cases like these where they’re going no matter if I say anything or not, I gotta gamble for every ounce of mana I can get so I can actually have it for that pull. It’s not uncommon to need to spam some really inefficient spells to stabilized the legendary arcane explosion face pull, so the mana can be worth the risk.
---
I need to level up my rogue just to do this
---
it wasnt the healer who said go though
---
Holy is very useful.
---
&gt;they don't use their Mana for anything else
---
\*laughs in powershifting cat\*
---
He's got a point. But I do love the wild west aspect of Classic. This is like an event, something big that only comes along once (or twice) a lifetime. I'm appreciating Classic for what it is and I'm sure I'll love retail again for all its QoL once I get back in in like 9.0.
---
Do you happen to know if it stacks with the 8% movementspeed from the boot enchant? 
---
As much as I'd hate to say it but if it does it would probably be an amazing hunter weapon for kiting lol.
---
So happy I’m not on a pvp relm :)
---
Starting to think you ARE fbi.
---
If you want to prove something why dont you just list all the possible information first instead of just stating "go to wowhead"
---
thought i did guess it didnt go through i dunno, anyway here haha
---
But the water I use isn't Conjured, but usually store-bought (unless in the lvl X0 - X4 range), meaning it's still there when I return. Yes, as a Mage, obtaining higher level water once you reach the X5 breakpoint really is a gamechanger in regards to efficiency.
---
Oh lol, the guy I was talking about never saw neither Felstriker or the carapace from all those runs. :o
---
Quest won't be available for a while, so no need to stress about it now.
---
Paladins.
---
it matters, you need 12000-1341= 10659 rep for the next step, and then the this step has 21000 points, 
---
so 10659+21000 = 31659 point
---
divided by 50 = 634 stacks
---
That's not his fault if he started his journey as soon as he got invited, though.
---
I'd ask for nothing less!
---
Pistols at dawn it is.
---
Wouldn't be a world first. There was one in a post about a winterspring sabre [a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d89sda/a_long_grind_with_60_mount_is_finally_over_reins/)
---
Well, that makes it even better!
---
They do enforce the name rules, i myself had to change my name.
---
You realy think they are gonna hire a whole new cs team to trawl chat logs to punish people who dont rp enough?
---
C'mon.
---
Helps you catch-up the longer you’re away, gives you a boost to xp to start your play session etc
---
It’s a meme. Relax. No ones complaining lol.
---
Let’s pull a negative from a positive. Good job.
---
Ah okay, thanks for clarifying the Hamstring. I'll look into it a bit more and try to work it out.
---
And yeah one of my main questions was on the execute. Usually I just spam it rather than building it up.
---
Pro-tip: let the tank tank, the healer heal and the dps dps once the tank has aggro. It's a time-honoured formula for a reason.
---
No, there isnt. 21 to get divine spirit, 31 to get shadowform.
---
That pull should’ve been easy to AoE clear.
---
Pretty much anything that is melee and don’t have a billion hp is pretty simple to AoE if you have the room which in this case there is plenty of. 
---
Mages are so shite 😒
---
You misspelled "best"
---
Damn y'all need some guild members then. Why pay when they need you just as much? Am I just too new to WoW to be familiar with that culture?
---
It does exist, but you will get the runecloth farmed faster
---
Twitch streamers? You new here kiddo
---
holy fuk
---
Not sure if it still works. But there was a trick to kick other players from a bg with the /me emote.  
---
Something like:  
---
/me has listed you AFK. Type: /afk remove  if you don't want to get auto-kicked from the battleground in 2 minutes.  
---
So when people are typing /afk remove, they will go in afk-status which kicks you out of the bg. Pretty nasty, especially because it only works on your own fraction but ....
---
Reminds me about scene in The Incredibles where guy jumps from roof, Mr. Incredible saves him and then guy who jumped sues Mr. Incredible.
---
Or the Goofy yelp
---
Yep, my first and highest-level guy is 28 and I (probably) made a mistake of taking Enchanting as a profession. So after my latest level up I am left with like 50s. Skill costs hurt too :(
---
Impressive. Taking the solo challenge very seriously.
---
Outstanding!
---
I’ll tell you the truth, but you may not like it. Ready? Ok, here goes:
---
You’ll be absolutely fine, lol. I started a warrior toon on a pserver server right after fucking Naxx came out, a server where I had no connections, no main, totally fresh. Levelled them up, joined a guild around lvl 58 saying I had intention to fury DPS, and started raiding shortly after. Do you really think guilds are all going to be full? Or at the same level of progression? 
---
This was a Naxx server, with new guilds still forming to progress through MC, then BWL, then AQ.
---
The longer the game goes, the easier it becomes to catch up with a fresh toon. Fire Maul will come out, which will streamline pre-bis gearing. Later on, ZG comes which makes it easier again. 
---
Just do it. You’ll be fine. You can level a toon, find a guild, and start raiding with no trouble at any point in the game’s lifespan. You could do it a year from now. Do you think there won’t be any warriors levelling through the 1-60 range who get to start raiding in the whole of 2020?
---
Yeah, seems like most of the ones I have seen with time on the Y were dealing with multiple plots. I would agree that it has become an unspoken convention, it seems people are more or less trained to look at line graphs like a timeline. I feel like scatter plots or any kind of point data format tends to be alittle more flexible in that regard though, probably because there isn't as much of an implied progression. 
---
Considering it now brings up memories of signal theory in college; having to convert from the time domain to the frequency domain was so difficult to conceptualize at first, after having been trained for so many years to consider things in terms of time progression.
---
Im L38 Gnome Mage. When should or can i start farming my pre-raid BiS gear? 
---
Is there anything that can drop now or in the next few levels?
---
Classic RP servers barely have any RP because of this. Non rpers flocked to those realms for low queue times, better community, but because they dont contribute to what makes them good servers, they fucking ended up ruining it. Bloodsail Buccaneers has the least RP Ive ever seen on a WoW RP server, yet the most non rp guild/character names
---
This response is the exact reason why I can waist hours doing stuff like that. It's the little things.
---
I'm fully aware of that. But the are people that play 16 hours a day, and manipulate the markets.
---

I like being able to have a tabard look cool on me as a cloth wearer, and I like to use some of the cooler pieces visually that weren't good upgrades so they get passed by and hardly worn.
---
Idk in my anecdotical experience 9/10 people can react in time and I gave up on doing this out of boredom
---
I don’t do this with my soul shards as healthstones, that shit ain’t easy to farm yo
---
Don't forget that this essentially hides whatever items he got out of the chest too, most likely just greens at that level but I have had a blue before.
---
In-game you open the chat and type in "/macro" in order to open the macro window.
---
You press new, choose a fitting icon for it and press ok. Then you paste in the macro text/commands (and change the stuff regarding lures or fishing rods to match what you have).
---
You then press save, and drag the macro icon to your action bar. Pressing the macro button or the key that it is bound to will use the macro.
---
Can't you macro ambush to switch to dagger and then switch back?
---
Somehow we’re talking about tanking leveling dungeons and you go off on a tangent about fury tanks in raids lmao
---
they will despawn the moment the player who made it dies again.  :(  BUT it is nice to see that happening :D
---
Chickenchaser! That makes you a true hero !
---
Yes but it's not bis for feral, either dps or tank.
---
About 60% of the mages I've played with so far have been so stupid that I've audibly laughed during a run. Are mages the new Huntard ?
---
I believe the Wintersaber does not require it.
---
Don't you stop leveling every time when fishing if the water isn't a high enough level? 
---
And how are you leveling cooking without more fish recipes? Or are you AHing them?
---
Reporting these names doesn’t change anything at that point, I personally stopped doing it.
---
The grass is always greener... I have a horse and wish it was a ram.
---
Still totally an asshole move to MAKE your own party members pay for conjured mana/food. If they decide to tip you, that’s cool, but keeping your healer at full mana benefits the whole group so by making them pay you’re hurting the group.
---
Here’s another solution. Join a PVE server
---
As someone who is leveling a shaman right now, I can tell you it's got a lot more variety than Mage. Shaman is great in pvp in enhancement, elemental, or resto. I leveled as enhancement with a 2h until 40-42 and then switched to ele with dagger and shield since it's stronger at higher levels, and is less rng dependent. It absolutely melts in pve, pvp, and I can always heal a 5-man since i have int gear. 
---
Your one enemy will be going out of mana but there's always ways around it. Beg a mage for some water, or learn how to fish and cook sagefish delight and you wont have to spend a dime on mana drinks ever again. Let me know if you want me to send you some great shaman resources I found online.
---
This was also about a week ago for me. Did he confirm he hadn’t done the quest?
---
Yes it does because without speccing into aoe build you are t getting increased damage for blizzard and decreased mana usage. Plus when aoe it should be frost nova , cone of cold , blink, 2 blizzards and a cone of cold at the end
---
Nope. Making you "look" isn't a hostile act. It's fantastic.
---
I keep making and deleting toons because something will annoy me like the voice, a particular animation or a problem with the model and armour. Eventually I find one I’m happy with the look of and level it to 20. By then I get bored and move on to something else. May have done 30 odd toons so far and haven’t got past level 23. I do feel like I’m getting left behind but the whole point is to enjoy yourself. I’m playing most of these as part of a duo or trio with friends (depends who’s online at the time).
---
Im happy to repeat content if it means playing with people plus it works with my altoholic nature.
---
It absolutely would not take that long for it to be posted on the AH, and they're saying to farm it yourself not buy it.
---
Better to chain pull that with rank 1 frostbolts. You can frostbolt 1 and get 3 or 4 that will tag along. Prevents a lot of damage
---
Had a guy in this sub tell me everyone should pay for water because it’s a limited resource...
---
Bro. This hurts. I healed ZF from 44-46, but respec’d to shadow last night because I couldn’t take elitist mages in spellcleave groups constantly rushing and blaming others when something went wrong.
---
I don't join guilds I plan to leave. Usually the guilds I join have raid teams or want one and are going to make one once everyone levels.
---
Well, I only started in TB. [I've been using this guide](https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/fishing-and-cooking-leveling-guide-classic-wow)
---
T2 full set bonus is amazing, though.
---
Probably doenst know what spellcleave is.
---
You're shit content, with your mouthbreathing weeb porn. Why don't you just stop posting?
---
If you're still spell-cleaving SMGY a month into the game, you're slow no matter how big, fat, and juicy your precious xp/min is. The rest of the server isn't going to sit on their laurels waiting for you to start fucking up the devilsaur market.

---
Finally big shout out to all the Grob Mob because everyone one that server makes Classic the best possible experience.
---
I just rerolled my Undead 43 Warrior to join my brother as Human Warrior on a different server. I had 250 Alchemy, 250 Herbalism, 250 First Aid, 230 Cooking, 123 Fishing (neglected that one), and a full bank of "Insert-prefix Fang" for future rage potions. I'd only done about 6-7 dungeon runs, the rest being solo questing.  
---
It was a tough choice and boy oh boy does it hurt to have to start all over, but not I am back to lvl 18 on my Human, being able to play between 6-8 hours a week, and I honestly am not bothered. With the Classic leveling experience, it doesn't feel like it does in retail - with how "the game doesn't start before max level" - so I am still having fun. In fact, I have learned from my previous mistakes, so I am no longer buying upgrades from the AH at bloated prices, buying every skill and rank up, and I already have all of my keybindings, muscle-memory of skill placements, and macros setup for future skills.
---
In the end, you need to consider if it is worth continuing on a character that you will not feel happy with, or just doing a fresh run learning from past mistakes. If you decide to reroll on the same server and same faction, you can practically transfer your bags and valuables to the freshy, making it get a great start.
---
TL:DR I rerolled a Human warrior on a different server, despite having an Undead Warrior at lvl 43 and I am enjoying the game just as much as before, especially since I now feel comfortable knowing I won't regret it at 60.
---
That’s awesome! It’s my first time ever playing classic (currently level 42), and I love absolutely everything about it, you should definitely give it a try. Btw, knowing that I can make someone laugh just by posting a comment, really brightens my day.
---
1 or 2 weeks ago the first reddit posts here started to apear of people how have achieved it \^\^
---
but, yea, they were probably nolifes i guese
---
It will still make him stronger.
---
if they change names, they are super slow about it.
---
and of course they won't do that, it would cost them money and we are talking about activision here. and yeah, thats exactly what they should be doing. if someone pays 12€ a month, he can expect a certain level of support for a service that was advertised as rp, but derived from that path because blizzard is too dumb to put up enough servers.
---
I get parried by ony's backlegs all the time.
---
Does it really matter though after seeing such a sexy orc
---
&gt;  Why does it have to be the highest rank?
---
Well I've had plenty of people get mad at me for offering them such things, like I was purposefully trying to insult them or something.
---
Hahaha I love it!!!! I wanna get the admirals hat!!
---
There's a 16 slot bag from a horde chain quest in blasted lands that nobody fucking does. I'm on the last part and I wont ever finish it, because you need to kill a boss that's immune to almost all magic, and I'm a warlock.
---
It _was_ more mature, until word got out that RP servers are chill, so thus the hordes of crappy people came running and ruined it.
---
Holly shit man youve got a gift. Awesome video keep them coming pretty please

Back in vanilla I was a rogue and my cousin was a hunter and we would grp up and he would revive pet and I thought he was hearthing so I would burn up my hearth cd.
---
I love doing this
---
So what's the problem? You're jealous that they have more time to play than you? Ultimately your rationale just smacks of being envious of what others have / are able to do / are able to sell things for. 
---
Focus less on this and more on enjoying yourself ...
---
Warlocks need food too. 
---
I lifetap down to 50% life and mana, and eat and drink so I can be ready in half the time. The healer will appreciate it too.
---
Thats not a dick move lmao
---
Typical DPS.
---
Improved hamstring doesn't provide any damage or reduce cost. Hamstring spam is also used for 2h fury on horde side. I don't know about DW though.
---
Rolls on a PVP server.  Can't hack it.  Whines on Reddit.  Sounds about right.
---
Pro tip: As a healer im not gonna waste endless drinks by breaking them early because the dd decides to pull. In this case it might be mages water but in most other cases its self bought and this will be costly over time
---
&gt; to get into the main world after the tutorial area
---
To go from Ascalon pre-searing to post-searing yeah
---
Yes, everyone in the group were my friends who had finished the quest except the priest, and the princess spawned instead of the high priestess which means the healer hadn't complete the quest.
---
Just lol @ your butthurt ending. God some of you are pathetic.
---
Arcane Crystals on Mankrik are between 24 and 30g a piece.  Arcanite goes for 30-35g per bar, usually towards the lower end.  I try flipping my transmute buying arcane crystals around 24g a piece and selling them at 30+, but for the last 24 hours arcane crystals are selling for the same amount as bars.
---
I don't care if I'm right or not... this whole conversation is an opinion and ultimately a player can do whatever they want regardless. 
---
It's not a minor point because your original question was 'what do you think your utility is' and stated that all we can offer is lockpicking, I am saying that sap is a utility that benefits the party and that is my perspective/opinion that you are asking for.
---
I have answered your question about how I feel on it, I don't expect those who can open locked chests to automatically offer a roll to all party members just like I do not expect herbalism/miners to offer me a roll on their nodes. 
---
Having had to spend a few hours leveling lockpicking myself and having engineering for PvP on most characters, everyone expects to benefit from my time and/or money but do not offer the same for their gathering professions. Almost all of the time, the locked chests will offer about the same money as the nodes that gatherers but I don't get a piece of that. 
---
However I do offer rolls because I would still feel like an arsehole despite this opinion. Even if I did not offer rolls, I would offer rolls on anything of value like blue BoE's or more, because that goes beyond the value of a node that gatherers get and would seem unfair in comparison.
---
I was woundering how far id have to scroll before I saw this refrenve. Glad to say not very far! This was my first thought.
---
First things first, do whatever you want, enjoy the game how you want to enjoy it. 
---
That being said, imho, the only absolutely "must-have" disc talent for leveling is wand spec. Deep shadow is very good. Meditation and divine spirit are much more effective in long fights where you're always casting and will almost never land a killing blow (like raid healing). During leveling, near-constant spirit tap procs are going to regen wayyyyy more mana than either of those disc talents.
---
you know forsaken treat people like they got treaten, just fair to me.
---
&gt; We can conjure 3 stacks of 20 in sub 10 seconds.
---
That's very situational, depending on level and the quality of water being requested. I've encountered multiple people that got offended if they were offered lower level water to save time (like 1 high and 1 lower rank water). 
---
&gt; If someone tips me, awesome! If someone doesn't tip me, who cares.
---
It's not that I need the gold, it's more the mentality behind it. I don't really feel like validating the "GIMME MORE" attitude many people seem to have.
---
A BoE=gold, as stated before. This is exactly like finding a cache of gold and giving it to one player so they can buy their needed item.
---
Fury tanking in dungeons is the best option anyway, that's out of question.   
---
The armor from shields below lv 60 is so minimal that it wont make a difference. Fury/Arms getting twice as much rage and doing 5 times as much damage will be less taxing on your healing.
---
The difference between having a shield and not having one at lv 50 is 5% damage reduction.
---
Too much time on my hands
---
Would you want to group with him tbf?
---
Lock counters mage lol
---
lmfao this thread is wild
---
Not all Forsaken are like that.  Remember when originally the Gathering that Anduin asked Sylvannas to allow families to meet again and ince the Banshee Queen saw some of those family members meeting and joyous she reined hell down on them during the ceasefire that was happening during this meeting.  This killed not only living but also Forsaken which is why there is a divide.  That's why you still see Forsaken in the Horde but Sylvannas also have her loyalists that want to plunge everything in Death.
---
&gt;Stormwind is a big RP hub if you're on a RP/RP-PVP server, but otherwise there's no good reason to stay there over IF.
---
No good reason ? Onyxia buff, anyone ?
---
Palatank has a really nice toolkit for tanking Dungeons, at the same skill level you will have a better time then a warrior.
---
As a raidlead myself i will not take a palatank into raids though simply because you do not have a taunt.
---
This single fact alone disqualifies palas as raidtanks completly. Sadly.
---
I like a good palatank in my dungeon.
---
A lot more than one in twenty will say the same thing. Within higher tier dungeons a dw tank will take noticeably more damage and put a much more noticeable strain on your healers mana. In the event that a healer has to almost oom themselves each pull, it certainly is better for everyone if the tank puts on a shield and does things properly.
---
I feel like at this point people are just taking photos of their screens for the meme. Which if so... amazing.
---
Twinkling is fun as long as you have money. But lvl 19 twinks are usually pretty cheap compared to higher level ones. Level 29 and 39 twinks can be fun as well but I don’t recall twinks higher than 39
---
Focus on not trolling people for exaggerating speech. No jealousy. Just don't like scrolling thru crap to buy a stack of wool.
---
Fishing can be very handy if you have a pet that eats fish.  Cats, boars, vultures, and bears eat fish...surprisingly wolves don't.  I've run into a bottle neck at level 48 with my fishing at 250 - nothing I'm fishing up and cooking right now satisfies my pet so I've got to buy food from a vendor anyways.
---
Incendius server? I've seen that name before! Nice one
---
Are you referring to mashed potato or something? 
---
I don't understand anyone who would eat unseasoned boiled chicken.
---
52+ none of the gear you can get right now matters for endgame

There's a comparable 2H from dire maul tribute, and a great 1H from AQ40 if we're just talking about mitigation
---
Looking for an add-on that simply makes a (louder or customizable) sound when Nightfall kicks in.
---
I have scrolling battletext and I know it makes a (low) sound but I feel it´s easy missable when doing dungeons etc.

Thank youuuuu
---
NARRATOR: Kids are so desperate for attention that they will ruin the night for others just to get it.
---
Right? Took at least 30 mins to an hour for me in dustwallow to get from 180 to 200
---
Same, I do it at least a couple of times a play sessions.
---
I'd be interested in those resources!
---
And any Shaman-specific addons you might use?
---
I accidentally got a poor Warrior killed in Windshear Crag last night near the cave full of Kobolds. Too many instantly respawned so I booked it thru the poor guy which he got trained on lol I felt so bad. Did a battle rez with an apology on him and he was chill. Poor dude had rez sickness tho :/
---
Yep that’s me ;)
---
I'm pretty sure there are several attempts at realm discords.  There isn't much traction on those but at least it's already out there.
---
Or its peoples' second or third toon they're leveling?
---
Gnomish shrink ray can "misfire" and make every one in the party Large(with increased attack power). Not sure If stacks with firewater or any other size increase buff.
---
I was getting 35-40k xp/hr with the average group, and as high as 50k. It also just gets better as you level up, as having a decently level'd party in ZF can easily get to GY in just 3 pulls. A dedicated group in just 2.
---
Most importantly though, is that apparently **you could** open world quest. I was stuck on Mograine until I transferred off at ~54 and questing was near enough impossible unless you played early in the morning.
---
Trust me, I would've if I could've. I actually really like questing, optimising routes, etc, and with a good route you can absolutely compete and even surpass ZF spam. But before I transferred over, I would've been lucky to get 20k xp/hr at typical hours due to the sheer volume of players.
---
Read up on the classic WoW 5 second rule for casters if you havent already and you'll see why hots are so nice
---
So you got an alt to 40. Best thing in the world. Now you got bags for days for your main. The trill of the rebirth is gone you can focus on real power leveling. 5 days will be 3. And you could choose another profession to lvl to real use the opportunity. Or just redo it again, it doesn't matter. 
---
The end end game won't be there for ages.... It's not a race.

spellcleave = mage aoe dps group.  usually 3 mages, a priest, and 1 other depending on level.  sometimes another mage, sometimes a warlock, sometimes a tank.
---
Gnome rogues do a backflip when they use kick.
---
looks like rwanda
---
When I tanked this area is have a mage run one way and I'd run the other, we round up the scarabs all at once then meet on the other side.
---
Most people don’t use logs for Classic atm. So the few people that do have very skewed rankings.
---
Example: his 100% rank on Shaz. He was the best of a whopping 9 total parses.
---
Thumbs up to you of just putting them on ignore and moving on.
---
LFM SM GY SPELL CLEAVE
---
that's why, just change the dungeons to the appropriate level one and it's a common sight in /1 spam all across the world. Apparently giving private servers *years* to figure out a static game meant that mages are stupid broken when it comes to AoE potential, so now everyone is trying to powerlevel by stacking clothies and just hammering down AoE
---
Weapon swaps trigger a GCD.  You could but you would have to press the button twice.
---
Thats why warriors will wep swap with stances as changing stances do not trigger GCD so we can do both at the same time.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7668/servant-of-razelikh](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7668/servant-of-razelikh) is what all the cool kids use to level weapons skill in late game.  At some point they go invulnerable and you can just afk while auto attacking.  They're like level 57ish though, and I don't remember if the stop doing damage when they go invulnerable.  If you're level 50 and they quit doing damage when they go invulnerable, you could get a higher level to help you get it down to invulnerable then go from there.  There are roaming mobs in the area....so maybe it's best if you save this one for later.
---
Your first piece of gear I think would be in ST, but ST is so horrible I wouldn't even go for it. Just wait until BRD ~53/54 to start grinding for pre-raid BiS.
---
Great trolling. Nice try.
---
I would recommend to everyone. Some foods will be useful, some will make you gold, and the fishing is excellent if you ever need to cool off for a bit.
---
Yeah you are correct, I was thinking more about dungeon leveling when you're drain tank spec.
---
Indeeed, but unfortunately this only works from neutral until friendly :(

Oh wow, you caught on to the obvious intent of my reply. 
---
Congratulations!
---
What mod do you use for the bar across the top!?
---
Enhancement isn’t taken into the raids for dps, getting mp5, spirit or intel would have been more beneficial, him taking a warrior BiS bracers hurt the raid and guild rather.
---
any other suggested warlock weakauras?  i have this addon as well specifically for this nightfall prompt and it's great.  wondering if there are others I should be using
---
As someone who just healed ZF for the first time in a decade...
---
YES!
---
awww, but there is no greater feeling! lol. 
---
Note: I've only kicked out Alts of people who left the guild, but its still an amazing feeling!
---
This is all correct, However Emperor runs can also be referred as Lava runs/Lava skip, where you jump through a window, kill Incendius and run through lava till you hit the torch room, thus skipping 70% of the dungeon. 
---
Other 60 runs you should be aware of are Strat Live / Strat UD, which refer to which part of Stratholme you want to do. Live side has lucrative Righteous orb drops (depending on server usually selling for 20-30g), and part of the dungeon is mainly humanoid mobs. Strat UD is all undead and has a couple pre-raid bis pieces for casters as well as other classes. The last boss also has a small chance to drop an Epic mount. 
---
Scholo is pretty straightforward, though groups may opt to skip certain bosses like the gallery room or Jandice Barov. 
---
LBRS can be split up between full runs, or just farming the first 3 bosses (The first 3 hold gems for the UBRS key, and pre-bis pieces for multiple classes), and UBRS is similar where groups opt to farm Jeb/Rend runs or the full dungeon. 
---
Once Dire Maul comes out, the different areas are usually referred to as DM W, DM E, and DM N/T (where DM T is Dire maul tribute, skipping all the bosses and only killing one of the final bosses in order to get a world buff and access to an extra table of loot). DM E has some farming options (for herbs, usually by holy priests), and DM N/T is often farmed as well by classes that can solo it (usually hunters) and can become a decent money farm.
---
Oh, so Bite has CD, good to know :)
---
Titanbar classic
---
I've never seen a commentor talk so long about being so wrong.   
---
The only mistake here is when the healer tells the tank to go, the mage thinks he's the tank.  Lmao Derp 😂
---
cant say that any of those names you listed are any good.
---
I remember people saying "char" rather than "toon".
---
I'll definitely work on making some extra scratch and snag a few months or whatnot when that opportunity comes back around. Thank you for the hype and encouragement
---
Thanks. How do you explain that every person here gives a different answer?
---
On average you need 7 minutes to kill Princess.  
---
If you only farm Princess 5 times an hour you'll earn about 14.5 gold.  
---
If you choose to kill goblin as well as Princess, and are fast enough to do it 5 times an hour, you get extra 14.3 gold average.  
---
You should be able to kill both princess and goblin in around 12 minutes, which is the time to aim for. Since that is the fastest you can farm (otherwise you'll get locked)  
---
So only princess = 14.5 gold per hour.  
---
Princess + Goblin = 28.7 gold per hour.  
---
From what I understand, the shaman in the video, isn't killing her to farm gold, he is trying to get the Epic Dagger that drops from her.
---
Absolutely, just like I wouldn't play with a healer.
---
10% is literally the difference between 40 and 50 (plate without, plate with shield). Ok fine it's percent-point, whatever, too close to argue over.
---
My experience is relevant because that's a lot orlf dungeons, one might even say a statistically relevant amount.
---
You don't agree, I get that. But why invalidate the others that were fine? Was I super lucky to never have people complain but one? Even if so, that's a heck of a lot more than you brought to the table. Show me what backs you up, an argument, anything but a personal attack or rambling about who you play with. Prediction: you won't or can't. You're just stuck up. Good day.
---
If you're not the tank, don't pull shit.
---
The mage didn't use his abilities to survive. He had options available that would have kept him alive for another 5 to ten seconds but he obviously didn't think they'd kill him as fast as they did
---
I'm pretty sure it's agreed upon that Troll is the best warrior when it comes specifically to end game tanking.
---
Is that a better party view mod? I have several issues with the standard one ...
---
orc just cause of the weapon racial, but yeah a troll would be nice just to be different
---
Id go mage. Seems like you don’t have much play time so the utility of portals and free food/water will help out alot. You wont have trouble finding groups for the occasional dungeon, and you will be strong without needing a bunch of gear. If you wanna world pvp its a no brainer for mage since they are top tier, especially considering you hard counter warriors who are by far the most popular class.
---
Orcs for +5 in axes for better chance to hit and therefor more reliable way to generate threat.
---
Trolls for an actual usable active Racial and the passive Racial of health regen.
---
It was a leaked Brazilian promo - so it may be a real thing there, but certainly not in EU or NA.
---
Trolls are the best PvE race for any class basically.
---
Axe spec is nice for orcs but the problem is that there's barely any good axes out there.
---
Tauren's stamina racial is basically useless.
---
Robe is better upgrade for farming ZF than epic mount
---
If you do reroll and are ok with a new name get this guy to 35 and max professions on him so you can use cooldowns like mooncloth ect
---
I'm trying to find out if a guildie of mine is what everyone is talking about: mage being the new huntard.
---
We were in Uldaman last night. Tank was 49, this mage was 42. It didn't matter how many mobs there were. Even if it was just two Stone Keepers. He would run up and spam Arcane Explosion. I believe I put more heals on the mage than I did the tank overall. It seems like he just wanted to flex his DPS but he kept pulling aggro every single fight. To me, that's not good damage dealing.
---
To keep things pleasant, I simply said, "Wow, you sure hate doing single target damage huh?"
---
And he says, "Yeah, I'm gonna respec to Arcane so I can have a combo of good single target and AoE!"
---
If he's an idiot, I'm not grouping with him again.
---
Trolls are actually the best PVE Warrior
---
Healer said go, but wasnt actually ready.
---
Crusader is the best
---
Some people have created macros to dance while pressing certain skills. It makes for a funny animation.
---
Are you locked into healing with the Druid? Maybe try a Feral spec and see if you like it better. Cat druids are fun :D
---
Do we get a different cat for each day of Inktober?
---
Doesn't really matter (especially for mage) but there's not much to do at 60 atm anyway.
---
Tauren have more HP and an aoe stun.
---
Orc have stun resist
---
Troll regen HP but I doubt that matters end game. They also have berserk which is great if you want to dps or generate more threat.
---
Perhaps, but you never know.  There are some factors working in my favor.
---
1) Guild still needs to do rep and quests to summon Rag
---
2) They were gonna do loot counsel, but changed their mind
---
3) For some reason, I'm the only 2H Fury warrior in the raid, everyone else went DW
---
but to transmog stuff into something cool, you need to have the cool thing first.
---
There is no difference between a guy in T1 and a guy who transmog into a T1. Both obtained this set.
---
Tauren is the best because they will always have more hp.
---
I farmed the crossbow hard and then got the bow from killing nathanos and i end up doing more dps using the bow and clipped rotation than the xbow, pretty salty.
---
no you want 3 points in improved rend even if rend is not in your primary rotation.  You want them so you can get deep wounds.
---
Zerk v battle, for questing and grinding you should really be focusing on mobs a few levels below you so you can chain pull 8 to 10 before needing to heal up.
---
it took me so long to setup and is very close to what I used years ago. thx

As a Rogue with Mining/Engineering, I've been making Gyrochronatom's and Target Dummy's (for the Fused Wiring) to fund my mount.  Both sell for a nice profit on my server.

Sorry in Classic you have to work for it
---
If I found a spot I was planning on giving it my all, leveling up alchemy so I can get max stats from pots and if raid members needed etc, basically how esfand said he was gonna play Ret just gotta try hard and dump money into consumables haha
---
This names are trash... not uniqe. Its like with such a name everyone knows ure a 12yo retail kiddo.
---
There’s many ways to make money everyone has there own go to place/grind for gold.
---
The only time I felt similar to this was back in early Legion killing a rare on my own and nearly killed it (felt like an achievement, took me 15 minutes on a prot warrior) then a warlock appears and helps finish off the remaining 5% of HP.
---
BUT leveling a warrior again in classic and fighting a mob for your quest when you've overpulled,  you know you're going to die and it's too late to run with the potential daze that follows and your ass gets saved by a healer and you kill ALL the mobs saving you approx 20 minutes of corpse running and killing the mobs again to finish the quest..
---
It is honestly one of the better feeling experiences out there and it would encourage me to check the health of players as I'm running to the next quest, can I help them kill it, do I thunderclap and hamstring as many as I can as they're running away? It's the little things

Undead because they easily look the best in warrior gear.

Jesus fuck, thanks. I didn't take any of the page quests because my quest log was full, so just thought "I'll just wait until I have all the pages."

Crusader is the BiS enchant for a sword spec rogue.
---
It's not a cheap enchant though.
---
I went with Tauren for the increased health and war stomp is pretty useful when you're starting to lose your grip on some trash mobs. 
---
I thought about orc, but as a healer main, I couldn't stand when orc tanks use their racial which cuts their ability to be healed by like 50 or 75%. Can't see any reason to use that as a tank. Undead might not be bad since they get WOTF, but they're so tiny I always think it looks weird when I see a little skeleton getting pounded by a bunch of mobs 5x their size.
---
I've hear it before, but couldn't cite the source, that committed food and water tastes terrible. That's why it's only used by adventurers.
---
Ahhh My bad man. People get a caught up in their own bubble and don’t think about that stuff. Didn’t mean to come off rude or anything with my last comment. Anyways it just means I’m taking a lot of college classes right now. A normal full time college student takes about 12-14 credit hours.
---
Consider how stupid the average person is, then realize about half of them are even dumber than that.
---
Wanted to say I haven't done this.
---
I'd be lying
---
For the sake of argument, you could also bring a “real” dps and kill even faster, while ensuring getting as many healing priests their bis healing weapon since crap luck can result in loads of Leafs for months with no Eye drop.
---
As someone that’s had months of trouble getting a new weapon to drop, simply saying “we have months before it’s a factor” is silly.
---
Wrong. No can hold agro in this situation but they are not supposed too. The work is entirely up to the mage to control or warlock if there is one but the mage has the aoe slow so the warlock has to be careful of that.
---
As a heal, and not related to just mages, wtf is up with almost everyone I've ever played with immediately running away from tank and LoSing heals. It's like an automatic response every time a DPS pulls aggro.
---
Sometimes I have a similar thought, but I never felt the need to tell the other person, or put them on ignore so I get that last word in.
---
No it's not. The bank especially so.
---
Yeah what Silithid said, the issue is that the mage is probably at range and you are in melee. Anybody at range has to beat 130% of a melee range person to pull. So unlike when you are dpsing with a real tank tanking, you only have to get 100% of the threat value to pull. And yeah hellfire probably just has a high threat per damage ratio.
---
Eh like it was a little annoying don't get me wrong. I mainly felt bad for the guys I was playing with as I was the main pilot and also decently geared. 
---
A lot of servers to choose from back then so no problem re-rolling. The early game is extremely fun.
---
: aaahh.. (takes a huge inhale and a sip from your coffee)
---
: oh man this is so amaz.. *gets stabbed by a rogue*
---
Yeah those people are easily avoidable. Just skip any ground where someone writes “gogo”. 
---
I had a Druid dps spamming LFM tank and healer ZF gogogo
---
Like how the hell do you think this works, guy? Pick a mage next time if you want to gogogo.
---
- Have a warlock who can summon and 2 others
---
- Get under Stormwind
---
- Move to the edge of the floorless pit
---
- Whisper level 25isch to join Stockade, rdy to summon
---
- Summon him right on the edge of the pit
---
- When he accepts the summon he falls down
---
Back in TBC you did not die when falling in, but instead you fall infinitly. You are slowly moving in a direction. If that direction is north he keeps on falling untill fatique kills him... somewhere north of Eastern plaguelands. 
---
He was falling for 3+ hours.
---
You can also summon people on the edge of a mountain and when they accept they fall to dead.
---
I was like the worse person ever...
---
I've had issues with addiction to WoW in the past. You absolutely have to force yourself a bit sometimes.
---
I've also had this issue in the past (even with BFA) and found that either a Logitech or Razer utility was causing issues. As soon as I killed the process - it would go away.  
---
Unfortunately I can't remember which process/service it was :(
---
Right, but Paladins still actively hunt the undead. I guess that RP would make sense. I'm sure a lot of them miss their family. I've never really understood the lore tbh. If 90% of them still want to be with their families, why did they join the horde? Surely they weren't all rejected by their relatives when they turned UD.
---
When leveling do whatever you want, hybrid, off spec whatever.
---
But when people invite a warlock for UBRS at 60, they have expectations of you brining the best your class can offer. 
---
Most raiding guilds will not even consider a non-meta specced anything in their guild.

---
I play on a PvE server, so for me it's all about group content or soloing.  For group content, an owl or wolf offer the best utility.  Owls doing an AoE debuff on mobs, and wolves doing a buff to the physical damage of your group.  
---
For soloing I like the Gorilla for their aoe ability and tankiness. 
---
For raiding, if you are the designated pull hunter, a wind serpent is usually best for their ranged ability, which allows you to pull just one mob out of a pack if you know how.
---
If I was a PvPer, pretty much all of the above pets would be wrong... for example if you were a night elf, you might want to use a cat for the stealth ambush abilities.  Or you might want a scorpid for the poison dot to keep rogues from stealthing.  Or maybe a spider or boar for the root/stun.
---
It's all in the eye of the beholder...
---
Same story for me.  Ever since the demo shout nerf warriors and druids are moaning about aggro while the pala tanks are just getting on with it.
---
As a priest, no. This is not the groups responsibility. I apply pain, wand or Mind Blast bear the end and I get my tap about half the time. I stay mana neutral through most dungeons unless it was a shit pull and I have to save people.
---
Force ractive disc is best :D 
---
What makes druids better then warriors? Both can only demoshout for (real) AE. Thorns ofcause but those can also be applied on a warrior and the warrior ca use a shieldspike and has access to more "Spike Items" atleast in P2

Please already know the spellcleave! 
---
(This is the new thing on Whitemane. Elitism coming back and we're  only weeks in)
---
I have gotten that spot to myself. Once. For about 4 pulls.
---
Combat Rogue (swords) question.
---
Just won Brutality Blade in MC last night. My offhand options are bad right now. They are Thrash Blade and Vanquisher's Sword. Which of those 2 should I offhand?
---
Imagine ignoring someone for simply "wasting" your time. As a healer/dps if I ignored everyone for simply wasting time I'd have nobody left to make groups with. I guess that's just the privilege you tanks have. Why even be upset when you can instantly make a new group and have it full within minutes. You sound like a whiny baby.
---
Little bastard won't be leeching off of me much longer!
---
Cats offer literally nothing for PvE
---
Captain, we have a stow away on board.
---
Right, this makes sense. Also, my main hand should be a slower weapon. However I've seen a mix of Fury warrs having slow OH and fast OH too. A fast OH generates more rage I imagine, while a slow OH will deal more WW dmg?
---
Use a cat or an owl.
---
Had a run yesterday without any plate used and the chest dropped from gorosh... such a waste.
---
Any side at this time of the day is going to be quieter than normal.
---
Another thing to consider is that without a shield you get hit for 10% more damage roughly and can't block. That means the healer has to heal more and could potentially pull aggro.
---
You could always go watch Disenchanted on Netflix.
---
You host restaurants from other countries’ cuisines that are the best in the world. And I’m not trying talking shit just saying that most of those excellent restaurants are not serving British cuisine.
---
Demo shout
---
My intention is not to impress anyone, just to share how to divide sm cath to 3 pulls and get some nice XP. Not everyone rolled mage:)
---
Poundedbybears was taken :(
---
0/10 comeback
---
I'm an arms warrior right now (Who tanks all the time), and having trouble holding threat at level 55 with well geared dps.  Granted, they AOE a few seconds after pull if I'm luckly. SO often My 'tanking' is just regathering mobs, or dragging strays back into the AOE.
---
So, part of me has considered switching to the high threat protection build 17/3/31.  Having a near 50% chance to stun on Revenge, and Concussive blow, both sound really nice.
---
Has anyone made that switch for dungeons?  How's it been for you as Protection?  Do you like it? Has it helped or made things easier?  How was soloing in the world after?
---
Early WotLK was the worst with all the death Knights having "/y GET OVER HERE!" bound to their Death Grip
---
You can get a mount enchant to gloves + carrot on a stick. That would give it a noticeable add
---
sounds like you play more than him
---
Guilds will be running MC forever
---
It’s not like retail where a new tier will make the old one irrelevant, people won’t have all their pieces from MC when BWL comes out, and the main tank will want to run it until they get thunderfury, which can take more than a year. Rosters aren’t static either, people will come and go, so guilds will need to keep gearing up fresh 60s and alts. The usual thing is to keep one raid night dedicated to MC + Ony well into later raid progression.
---
You might not be in the foremost raid team on your server, but there is always a place for a fresh 60 to raid in vanilla. So don’t worry.
---
Looks like they killed him before he blocked, thus the "crap they hurt".  I am assuming they hit way harder than he was expecting.
---
Ya honestly I'd like a client side Xmog, doubt it's going to happen , but theirs likely a mod for it.
---
No. Why would you pay for that? There's plenty of free guides online and even at that you shouldn't stress about leveling fast dude.
---
yeah i rarely see one on screenshots that I like. it's a highly individualized thing. and blizzard did an amazing job allowing this customization
---
There are plenty of free guides.  Don't pay money for one.
---

---
vanilla-questing.me
---
Thanks for your feedback.
---
I don't disagree with palatanks being disqualified for raid tanking. I'm happy with healing once I'm 60. I guess my main concern is "why is everyone applying raid mentality to dungeons tanking when it comes to paladins".
---
But i got a lot of constructive feedback on this thread, with a lot of people agreeing to the difference between raids and dungeons.
---
Another mage spellcleave thread and video.  Yay Classic...
---
Yes , we can read too
---
Shadowed Unitframes is pretty clean. You can customize it quite a bit.
---
How do you actually kill a mage in open world pvp as a lock? 
---
I have no problem killing them if they don’t run away, but the moment they ice block and blink the fight is just over for me since my dots are gone and I have no way to close the gap?
---
Lmfao this is a very well done video.
---
I leveled with imp VW to 60just fine within about 7 days, luckily classic threat meter displayed the threat of my pet. Although I gotta admit that he had more trouble holding aggro towards X6-X9 levels since he’d only get a new torment rank every 10 levels.
---
He didn’t aggro until the priest said go, so it’s not really his fault.
---
Yeah I kept popping out of bear form if the healer was drinking while the lock was life tapping. I know that was kind of encouraging the lock to keep doing it, but it made my healers life easier I hope.
---
Spellcleave...
---
That sucks bro. Hope you can find a nice group of people to play with. They are out there.
---
Thanks mate! Nearly finished my next video, we made a fresh level 1 and walked from 1 side of Kalimdor to the other, drinking each time we died haha
---
I but them all on AH before my first trip to STV, easy xp
---
Wow, and I thought playing some anonymous avatar would help people hide from their insecurities
---
Even if you do level as arms piercing howl is worth getting. Although at ZF level you can't have both PH and MS so I guess that is an excuse not to have it. But in that case you'd just use demoralizing shout.
---
Did you try and switch to ML after the boss was already dead?
---
With this in mind, how possible would it be to create a viable aoe build for warriors? For example there is a chest that heals upon being hit that may work with this.
---
Either bad players or strictly main hand weapons
---
Good thought. Must be the case
---
If you know you are going to be main tank, then troll. It won't matter in dungeons but if you're raiding Berserking is better for threat.
---
Orcs are more consistently better in PvP (hardiness) and dps.
---
no one cares + no one believes you
---
Those hurt even for tanks
---
yeah it's the exact same as any other profession.
---
 at least level 10 to get above 75 and at least level 35 to get above 225.
---
Ive had mages that blow their ENTIRE mana bar on every single pull.  Sometimes it works great and they basically solo every pack. Sometimes they get people killed.
---
It's really annoying, I finally moved to the new spanish server, and found more RP respect (Spain has aleays been very RP-friendly)
---
I know a lot of people moved to ZT due to the long queues in other server, but please, if you are in a RP server, respect the RP rules.
---
When you try to RP there's usually someone like "wtf dude what you doing gtfo", then you ask why are they in a RP server: "MAYBE COS THE QUEUES :)))))))", or "I went here to avoid queues, not to fucking RP" c'mon bro, respect the RP server rules, really annoying
---
I was RPing in Ironforge with some other dwarven, talking in dwarvish (we have modals in kings lands) and someone come like: "hey wtf, isn't that against ToS??? You bothering me!"
---
When you ask in world/trade chat looking for some RP guild, or seeing someone recruiting RPers, you can see a "this server is not RP, only PvP" 
---
Also the name problem, I was tired of reporting names everyday. And I think that if "stabyoface" gets a forced name change, the next name will be like "stabyoass".
---
The problem is the infestation of non-RPers (and also RP haters) that bothers other RPers, then you  see that everyday and get tired of try to RP in that environment.
---
Well it's hard to look back at other classes once you tried aoe lvling with mage:D
---
I don't care about the all star score. It's the other statistics that are useful and the fact that you can replay the whole fight and see exactly what everyone were doing.
---
Clearly the tanks fault
---
Use whatever pet you want.  The damage is similar enough to not really matter in the grand scheme of leveling.
---
Try turning your farclip up even more, it supposedly has no cap.
---
Seal of Wisdom becomes a must once you get it. I usually judge righteousness on skull then wisdom the rest of the fight so I can continue to consecrate without ooming. Most consecrates are down ranked after the first also.
---
Not every tank is a warrior
---
Mage.. the new hunter
---
I tried that website no luck
---
Perhaps he expected to have PWS. Like I said, who knows.
---
Look up the quest for Razorfen Kraul.  It might be worth it if your shield hasn't been upgraded in a while.  You'll be a little overleveled, but you'll be able to stick around and do the Shimmering Flats quests in the area which are perfect for your level.
---
I wish I was recording yesterdat, 1 raid of alliance was waiting at ony gate and hostile. They were not prepared for the 4 horde guilds who arrived simultaneously to do ony
---
ElvUI
---
Can already tell from the way they're talking this is a ZF GY farm group. People that do this are fucking yikes.
---
That’s when you abandon your son
---
priest, you said go. Also mage should have nova/blink or iceblock.
---
why do you need a guide to look at a list of recipes and determine what gives you skill for the least amount of materials?
---
I'm more impressed by creative lore-friendly names than a Gnome called "Gnohomo".
---
What did the DPS meter look like? How was the flow? Did he need to drink after each fight?
---
The tank might have been struggling because single-target tanking is so much easier when you don't have AoE like that.
---
Aman
---
Grats! Go do the quest for Mirah's Song.
---
Yeah it sucks. I usually tap down to where my health and Mana are equal, then eat and drink to full..or use a bandage if our group is really chugging along. I also always tell the healer I'm not trying to use them as a "Mana battery" - one healer was still super salty about me lifetapping though.
---
Sure, only if you communicate that to your group as the mage. Fuck you if you're just going to do it and expect the group to be able to keep up though
---
Hunters.
---
Yes it was.
---
Aye, that's the only rational explanation I could think of myself. But then I remembered that humans don't necessarily act rationally, so you never know.
---
lol at the suing blizzard bit. Get out of the fursuit you're a grown man
---
That was it! Thank you very much!
---
but is it reserved?
---
It does, at least for yourself. Not 100% sure whether it shows up on players who can't see you when used from stealth, though.

---
I don’t know if I replied in the wrong comment thread.
---
Yeah... It does sound pretty unlikely, I'll give you that.
---
When I started playing wow I didn't really know any lore. My friends wanted to play horde and I found every other horde race to be boring (orcs), ugly (trolls) or not able to play the class I wanted (tauren + priest).  
---
I also just liked the look of the forsaken and I'm skinny in RL (I'm a skeleton.. get it?..)
---
On the other side: who cares. It's a role playing game. Playing the role of a bad guy can be interesting and doesn't mean you're necessarily a bad/edgy guy in rl. I personally think the most boring thing to play is the human paladin. Just the whitest all-good guy on the planet.. the good and honourable prince on his white horse to save the princess.  
---
Of course the stuff the forsaken (and sylvanas) do is terrible. In rl I would hate those guys and I would want them to be taken care of (they are pretty much terrorists). But I will still shout "FOR SYLVANAS" when I ride into battle in game. Because that's who I am in wow.  
---
People who just hate undead (players) and kill them on sight just because they're undead and think undead players are bad/edgy people should come back to reality. We're just regular nice people who happen to play a bad guy in a game for fun.
---
I was thinking that too. 
---
I expected to get a Fear and lots of DoTs for my efforts.
---
He just Seduced me and 1v1ed my pet for most of it.

Good thing the opinions of others doesn't effect my life eh? Happy wowing
---
Mostly because different servers/communities had different names.

Im with you on DM though.
---
Going on 20 runs now without seeing it drop.
---
Basilisks (lvl 39-40)  south of Grom Gol in the barrens along the coast and a little bit in-land, if you have skinning. It's especially good if you also have fishing because you can fish the little junk piles and get Mithril Crates which often have green BoEs and valuable crafting materials. I grinded them from lvl 38-40 and went from 30g to 80g during those 2 levels. I stayed there a little longer and got to 100g (enough for mount and lvl 40 skills) before i hit lvl 41.
---
What? if the warrior is tanking with a two hander or dual wielding he's going to be in def stance.
---
Got my priest twink ready!     Priestigious
---
How do I make a mouse over macro for healing when I mouseover raid frames?
---
Your weapon skill goes up to an acceptable level in a few pulls, just do ask people if they can carry you that long. Usually they can.
---
Thank-you for your time/info.
---
All the best!
---
You ever been to a shitty Walmart? This is the type of person you will find there.
---
Has anyone had issues with Summoning Shadra? I solo'd with my hunter by kiting for 10 minutes but once dead I was unable to loot.
---
Nothing you do even with engineering will out threat people that AOE within 5 seconds of you starting a fight. Like even with engineering explosives and dumping rage into battle shout, whirlwind and cleave, you just don't have enough global cooldowns available to out threat them. 
---
Seriously just tell them to wait if they don't want to die.
---
Why bother with that when you can just download more?
---
 [https://www.downloadmoreram.com/](https://www.downloadmoreram.com/)
---
no, not at all....
---
it's a cool break from raiding and grinding money with my mains :)
---
&gt;Also, for the left handed people out there! Do you have to do any kind of keybinding switches/etc to make the game more... natural I guess?
---
I'm a leftie and I just use the mouse in my right hand. You can save your son some trouble if you tech him to use the mouse in his right hand.
---
Once the tank has more gear it will be easier.  Won’t be full ham until you have 40 geared out.
---
Just buy some Savory Delights or whatever they’re called bro! Be a ninja or pirate forever
---
Yeah but you just double missed your cleave (right after they dodged your white attack) which cost 20 rage so now you're at &lt;5 and your next white attack happens 3.5+ seconds later for it to miss again.
---
you told him to go... you let him down
---
Okay this sounds reasonable. I asked because Im considering going out of my way to get a wolf from sfk with 1.2as which sounds like a really good option in both pvp/pve in the endgame so I can roll with one pet from the start.
---
I’m sorry
---
I’m one of those guys and I’m not sorry. I wanted to play on a pvp realm but I’m also a father, a husband, and I have a full time job. I don’t have time to sit in queues when I only get an hour or two to play at max a night, if I even get to play that night. So I went to an rp-pvp realm. My name isn’t an rp name because all of my names use the same word at the start so guildies know it’s me without any effort. 
---
I’m not here to stop anyone from rp’ing. I also don’t want to deal with streamers or some of the attitudes that exist on normal pvp servers, so I did what I think would be best
---
much obliged :))
---
for the horde!
---
It is that bad, until level 36. 
---
I was at a crisis around level 32, I was seriously considering switching to rogue.  I couldn't take it, any time an add shows up, it is a death sentence.  Hamstring kiting works until you \*miss\* 
---
Now that I am above 36, with whirlwind, cleave, sweeping strikes, I do a lot of 2v1 now, and it is awesome.  Leveling isn't so bad anymore.  I solo'd vorrel's revenge while both of the elites were green.  I felt like a badass, I had to use intimidating shout, bandage, potion, but I 2v1'd 2 elites!!!   I can actually do combat now!
---
Bu... you cannot solo orange mobs.  I went to swamp of sorrows, and decided to attack a dragonkin 3 levels higher than me, it is orange, it will be a tough fight I said, but 1v1 I can burn it down.  I might end up using 90% of my health, but I can do it.  I kited, I bandaged, I healing potion'd, but I couldn't get him below 60% health.  Why?  
---
He brought his friends, Miss, Parry and Block to the party.  Dodge was nowhere to be found, I like Dodge, I can get along with Dodge.  Warriors are so dependent on hitting mobs, because you are missing rage generation on auto-attacks, which lowers your dps, it is a death spiral.  So, stick to green-yellow mobs only.
---
Warrior leveling is probably the roughest grind in WoW.  You just don't have any options to save fights when they start going south.  I leveled a hunter in vanilla, and this is basically the opposite end of the spectrum.  But I love playing as a warrior, being able to get into any instance group to tank (which is funstrating, like herding cats) and those SWEET SWEET Execute crits keep me going.
---
What would you suggest for a rogue 55? I got that purple dagger with a +3 and the maraudon dagger. Will be trying for shaker soon solo
---
remember, as stated below, wait until later, a hunt has nothing, literally to get rid of dots etc.. against a Warlock, at best you'll die both.
---
I don't strip for free 🤑
---
probably just your luck
---
Counterpoint: I've never had trouble finding a rogue to open one for free becuase they get to skill up. If I get something good then I'll tip. If its some shitty 30s green then nah
---
A lot of the best grinding spots are popular and full of people so they are no longer efficient grinding spots. So people find other 2nd tier spots that work well.
---
The frenzy meme is unbased, with 4/5 frenzy you won’t find  any noticeable difference in frenzy uptime between a 1.0 and 1.2 attack pet. BT is pretty much only used for the pushback, you can go 2/5 with BT though so you can get some advantage of those extra talent points.
---
Undead rogue "bakkustabbu", tauren "Milkme"
---
pull rage and use shield slam
---
Ring
---
Doesn't do anything.
---
Someone already mentioned the SM quest line that rewards a nice tanking weapon. In general you'll want to farm SM as a warrior, Herod is a warriors wet dream for gear and ravager is great for dpsing dungeons. If you enjoy tanking you'll want to do Cathedral as well, Mograine drops a shield that you'll use well into your 40's. 
---
RFD is another one you'll probably run multiple times as the chest piece off the first boss is pretty nuts and there's a nice helm off the final boss. There's also a quest for a decent one hander that does more DPS than the SM one, or a decent 10 stam neck. There's also a quest in the dungeon that rewards a 10 stam ring. both of which are useful if you're a tank.
---
Haha, I actually go to low level areas and ress people in far away locations. I get a lot of thanks
---
It's funny how u say you can't empathize, seeing how you didn't even try. Take Jimmy for example, he ate some bad looking corn and next thing he knows his own family is chasing him out of the city w torches. No wonder they hate the living and no wonder that the orcs, sympathize because the alliance wants to chase them away too. And how else but raising more undead could sylvanas keep the undead alive? Their soldiers fight in the name of the horde and that same horde wants to prevent them recovering from losses? Get your close minded alliance propaganda outta here mate.
---
Have him use the right hand for mouse. I'm left handed and it's the only way to go for me.
---
Yeah buts more of an ironic thing. Is that how the rp servers are?
---
His overall damage was low but his DPS was very high. My issue was that since he’s so squishy, I didn’t feel comfortable throwing an efficient Greater Heal on him; I needed to Shield, Flash Heal, etc. to keep him alive!
---
Me trying to heal people in Overwatch..
---
So, for a warlock?
---
The ones I’ve seen only use this recipe for 10 levels. If you want to use it to make gold, you can do more with it, but you don’t need to. 
---
I leveled my tailoring without the pattern. I have other ways of making money.
---
Oh sweet summer child. ToS isn't enforceable legally
---
The masks are cut to fit?
---

---
handmade by a friend, i'll let him know you like 'em
---
Don’t worry. Getting to 60 is what matters, and theres plenty of warrior gear at level40 and above!
---
It all comes down to the player... After 3-4 runs in the same dungeon you pretty much learn when and where to use the racial, AS A DPS, as tank I don't think you should ever use it.
---
If there's a mage in your party you ask for food/water, everyone's in the dungeon together. Rogue in party with a locked chest they can open you /roll. BS is different, you can ask for compensation if you want to let people roll on it since you have to use a key, otherwise it's yours. Rogue LP is free, so you roll.
---
18 mage with nearly 2 gold
---
Even though all he had to do on his keyboard was hit  “r ty enter” ?
---
You can't really quibble about whether fury or arms is better for leveling.
---
Arms has its mid 40's power spike where it's dominant, and Fury is much stronger early and with gear at endgame.
---
If you want to tank and stance dance you want to be Arms. If you want 5% crit, Piercing Howl and some regen you go Fury. Either way you don't want to dual wield with rage as a resource and no hit. Leave that for rogues.
---

AoE grinding isn't viable right now.  It was the way to go at launch if you could get ahead of the curve.  You were golden if you could.  It will also be viable again in some early areas as the game get more top heavy.  Some of the biggest hot spots in the 30-50 range though are completely over camped at this point.  The alliance farm in Arathi Highlands for example is just PAINFUL to watch.  I was running through just yesterday and watched 3 mages fighting for pulls.  When you are "AoE grinding" 2-3 mobs at the most then you're wasting your time.  Go quest.
---
It's not even a 40% increase in speed, it's 25%.
---
my buddy has had like 50 characters all named debby with different accent marks. our alts are both named debby too

Macro dagger in mainhand to stealth for ambush purposes.
---
Macro swap to sword to hemo for hemo spamming.
---
One issue is since he was level 42 he certainly wasn’t soloing these packs of level 45 elite mobs. Just pulling aggro.
---
What you will be missing out on isn't really the abilties, bite/growl are the big ones even on cats. Claw is just a focus dump, and swapping for howl isn't the worst thing in the world; and you're right the SFK wolf has 1.2 which makes it as good as deathmaw.
---
What you are actually missing out on is the 10% damage modifier from cats. As a BM hunter, that extra 10% base gets compounding effects from frenzy, ferocity, unleashed fury, and bestial wrath; which further increases the damage difference.
---
Is that the biggest deal in the world? No, you'll level fine with a wolf, it's slightly un-optimized but it'll be at maybe 4-7% reduction in clear speeds.
---
I was selling arcane crystals for about 30-40g

I’m not demanding r14 under no system would I ever get r14.  We don’t even know how hard r11 will be to get. Probably still a huge grind. Maybe what I should clarify is it’ll be horrible in the overpopulated servers.
---
I think he meant he only got to 30 when he played in vanilla.
---
Who said anything about suing? The players who troll RP servers need punishments
---
Druids get talented movement speed in cat form starting at 20, then travel form at 30.
---
A free Mount at level 40 is still a mount at level 40.  Up until then, warlocks have zero movement speed increases, and paladins get...Pursuit of Justice? Or was that not a thing until TBC? Anyways when I'm creating an ALT, I'd much rather have the ability to Blink or Sprint every other minute or so then save 100 gold which is maybe about an hour's farming at level 60.
---
It's an iceblock pull, has nothing to do with healing.

toss a knife after them

I also got my Saber when I was level 20! It was a hard pet to tame because there are lots of people in my server grinding in that area and will be quick to kill one as soon as I summon it T\_T

That and I don't really have any reason to save up gold, i aint never getting 1000 for my epic so I just buy shit willy nilly now.  
---
Plus I'm leveling lw up to craft my Devilsaur set, so I've been buying leathers when they are cheaper than others in the AH.  
---
Will be mostly leveling in Un'Goro once I finish Tanaris and Hinterlands.
---
Lol this doesn't make me feel better
---
He.. life tapped? Surely you reported him, that's a perm ban I'm pretty sure.
---
We used me (a mage) to tank her but LOSing the mana burn and running back and forth between the balconies. Then the other 4 people killed Emperor.
---
Your logic doesnt make sense. You can farm 50g an hour you said but you dont want to pay 50g to respec. Youd rather spend weeks leveling another character. Pally is the best aoe farmer theyre unkillable
---
A smart tank will sort of kite mobs who are mass slowed via hunter trap or mage blizzard, especially if taking critical damage and the healer is CC'ed or just struggling on mana. 
---
Just standing still is when your group is in complete control and you have all the aggro.
---
If you stand there while your healer is asleep for 15 seconds (this happens in Sunken Temple) you will probably die.
---
Only bosses lock you to an ID
---
The Forsaken follow Sylvannas and do her bidding, it may not be their political view but they do what they must for their race to survive. if you play a Forsaken, you are in control of that character and it is your mindset that is in that character, so your views and your personality depict if they are evil or not. I know that somewhere is was written that once Sylvannas turns you, you will share her point of view but not 100% sure if that is set in stone. Getting a bit heavy role play here but you are playing your story, as we all are and all our little story's play alongside the grand scheme of things.
---
Yeh, found nothing even blue valuable...
---
Rogues are so gear dependant though.
---
Someone knows which levels the majority of the playerbase are at? I heard someone on a podcast talk about it, but couldn't find anything with google
---
There’s a lot of really terrible people who play this game
---
More threat = shorter fights = healers don't run out of mana = who cares what your max hp is.
---
The biggest comment chain on this thread is some salty bloke from across the pond that’s butt-hurt over 1 inch fried potato nuggets.
---
I love it
---
Nah, I don’t even know all the commands and how things work. I just started. Just healed him when he ran away from mobs and got this.
---
My kids go to bed at 7-7:30PM, I get up about 5-530 AM and need ~6-7 hours of sleep to be functional.  The 7:30PM-10PM window allows for ~1 hour of WoW, sometimes an hour of work (manager, our business never stops) and maybe an hour with the wife watching an episodic TV show or otherwise doing household chores (dishes/laundry/cleaning the house). 
---
I can play *some WoW*, but MC/Ony at classic speeds in blue gear, not that feasible.
---
Blizzard built retail where a dungeon run is 20 minutes, the queue for DPS about the same... it's not a coincidence that a dungeon run is the same length as a typical TV show...
---
Cool, thanks.
---
What's that theory? Okrams razer? Something like that. "Never attribute to malice, what can't be explained by stupidity"
---
Normally I get annoyed if my drinking time is interrupted for a pull, since this is classic, water is expensive. But if there’s a mage in the party, it’s free. So just react to what’s happening, and go heal.
---
In World of Magecraft does it matter which Horde race I pick?
---
Is the baron mount much more common now than it was in vanilla, to the point of worth farming? I've already seen 3 or 4 on my server.
---
Also an app on iOS and android called WoW talents. Let’s you play around with all the Classic talents of every class.
---
I have yet to get that response from one of my random heals.
---
Leeeroyyyyy jeeenkins
---
I'm really hoping people take to hanging out and dueling in Goldshire again once people get done leveling. That's one of the things I miss most.
---
54 Warrior, 90g :-(
---
Mortal Strike is great in PvP, and even in dungeons as a good way to generate a solid hit between auto attacks.
---
But in the open world its just wep damage plus 85 for 30 rage.  The extra attack is nice but it's not earth shattering.  Meanwhile overpower costs 5 rage and does wep damage and is easily triggered by sunder.  Not to mention sunder causes all subsequent attacks to hit harder as the mob has less mitigation.
---
At level 40 with a good axe and a few sunders I am hitting ordinary mobs for 250+ white hits and nearing 600 crits.
---
If I save my rage by not using an execute I can charge the next mob and put 3 sunders on it between my first white hit and my second.  On an equal level mob that typically reduces its mitigation against my damage by nearly half.
---
Oh i am talking soloers, in parties everyone gets food/water :) 
---
Though ill start giving lockd food too!
---
But I've come out of GY (all 5 runs) each time with less than 8 new things in my bags.
---
Givin them 13 years to try and change my mind but agian and again the Forsaken only seek to eradicate all life. BTW I main Taurens.
---
How it has gone so far for all my groups.
---
100g, on me and around 70 on my bank alt, and i just got to 60 so i still have to learn a bunch of abilities
---
Another leftie using righthand for mouse.
---
Priest is better for this. You can mind control people off the edge.
---
It's a short flight to wetlands to use the boats.
---
This is why I'm glad we're back to single realms. Mages who do pull this shit quickly get put on blast and blacklisted from pugs and/or get shit from their guild for besmirching their name.
---
Good luck farming Strat for your preraid gear, you stingy popsicle!
---
That lock must have been shit
---
1v1
---
Are there pumpkin candies in Classic? From the Halloween event?
---
The Keychain was in Vanilla. The fact that it's not here now is an oversight.
---
No way, Blessing of Salvation doesn't even come close to making up for how much better Horde racials are.
---
People don't realize that you remember their names when they do this kind of stuff. 
---
In BFD I had a healer who was rolling need on everything, greens/blues it didn't matter. So we killed the first boss, and once again they need on the tank chest piece, which was a massive upgrade for me. Immediately booted, but they still won the roll, and then they start typing in /say, begging to be let back in. 
---
Fast forward 25-ish levels to Maraudon two weeks ago, and I'm running with a group of players in the same guild other than me, and all we need is a healer. They get a healer from their guild, and it's the exact same person. I almost left, but decided to stick it out. They weren't needing on everything anymore, but that was the single worst dungeon run I've experienced in any game. It took us over 3 hours just to get the scepter done. Both the mage and the healer died multiple times to the slow moving slimes, we ended up with the two warriors using their ranged weapons to kill these groups while the ranged DPS did a corpse run. 
---
Now I'll remember both that guild and that healer, and never make the mistake of running with them again. Your reputation matters more than people think.
---
Because of convenient location - it's in the middle of continent.  
---
Also it's close to Menethil Harbor, from where you could take boats to Theramor and Darkshore - giving you nice access to almost every part of Kalimdor.  
---
Compare, how long it will take to reach BFD, RFD or FZ from SW or IF?  
---
SW is only close to Stockades, DM and Temple. IF is close to Uldaman, SM, SFK and the all Kalimdor dungeons.
---
Not if you're not single target focusing. But its not hard to build rage while tanking especially with Anger Management. And revenge is the best threat ability. If you're going one target at a time you shouldn't have a problem holding aggro.
---
Under 20 gold at level 46.   I don't horde it though, I buy most of my spells and I have been using it for level crafting faster.   Gold doesn't do anything for you just sitting in your bag.
---
Is there a handy spreadsheet for how to set up raid groups? I absolutely love how this is a factor in Classic and I'm excited to lead raids in a couple of weeks and need to know how to optimize groups.
---
13-40 judging by lfg spam
---
That feels even more torturous, having the training but no mount! I'm just going to get them both at the same time
---
Okay good im level 32 with 30g. I thought I was behind the curve.
---
Lvl 60, 808g, so many people have installed ah add-on without properly using it, it's easier than ever to make gold.
---
cunt
---
Azure silk belt for anyone looking
---
Um... no thanks.
---
Oh god he just went in
---
Thank you for not locking loot.
---
That shit is cancer.
---
Hopefully some nice people you run with will join you again and help you get your items too.
---
No!? Dungeonmaster!
---
This only worked on servers and hasn’t worked in wow in a very very long time
---
Yes you do - kickboxes all the way. This was part of the Insane in the Membrane achievement in later expansions. 
---
Painful grind.
---
yeah i was bout to say i remember having focus targets and macros to utilize it in vanilla because i played mage and have focus target macro for sheep was amazing
---
Those Crystal's emit C02. Let's protest!!
---
THIS. IS. WARCRAFT!
---
This happened to me after being in a group for 20+ minutes while questing in Tanaris. At the very end they just said sorry we're going to bring in a mage actually and removed me.
---
This aoe mage being the only viable way to dungeon mindset is actual cancer. If you're reading this and don't think you can clear things just as fast with good dps/windfury melee groups you're 100% wrong.
---
Being level 31 I didn't know about SoW (38), but I see your point. Damn, this whole palatanking deal is getting more intricate than I thought.
---
Given how populated STV and Arathi are, a majority of the playerbase is likely between 32-42.
---
This makes me think back to Vanilla, lvling in Un'Goro with a couple friends.
---
We were running one of the quests, killing a couple of mobs, when I turned around and saw one of these creeping up behind us.  They made so little sound.
---
So, I said in party chat, "inc"
---
Didn't help.  We all died brutally by the jaws of the devilsaur.
---
Afterwards, while we were all laying there dead, one of my friends was like All you could say was inc?  I said yeah, there really wasn't much time to react.
---
He said something along the lines of Inc does not quite catch the urgency of the fact that we're all about to get mauled and eaten by an OFUCKOSAURUS.
---
I died laughing.  To this day, every time I see one of these, that's what I call them in my head.
---
&gt; I don’t know about this particular spot, but in others it’s still optimal experience. Even when other mages are farming the same area or people are ganking.
---
Even with *SEVEN* other Mages competing for the same mobs? There would have to be an absolutely *insane* amount of mobs for that to be viable, and that's the context i was replying to. I'm not stating that AoE farming isn't in any way usable, and I hoped that would be implied by what I wrote, but in hindsight I can see that it can be interpreted both ways, so I apologize for being ambiguous. 
---
&gt; Big AoE pulls can be challenging as well and they’ve forced me to get better muscle memory with my CDs when things go tits up.
---
Aye that is a valid point if you are (also) doing it to improve your general skills as a Mage. But for the XP alone, it isn't worth it unless you can find uncamped spots.
---
had about 600 or so when i dinged 60 made the rest from dungeons and mining for epic mount. Bought a Mature blued draogn sinew for 150g and im sitting at 150g again XD
---
Ah yes the bugs. Not even elite wcgw
---
But you lose agroo if you do that
---
I'm on a pvp server, but my head-cannon is that my Forsaken mage is doing everything he does for the sole purpose of getting revenge. 
---
Of course, in story, he doesn't know that Naxxramas will eventually appear, but my story is that when it does, he will be consumed with hatred against Kel-Thuzad and do anything to get revenge.
---
i too thought i was lucky with his Runeblade hehe
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/5uhBTuV](https://imgur.com/a/5uhBTuV)
---
&gt; wait an ENTIRE 5 seconds
---
That's like 9 hours in mage time....
---
Including vendor trash and mats? That number doesn't sound right
---
Can't confirm, but I 3v1'd a shaman, a rogue and a Frost mage as a dwarf warrior and came out on top so... We're at least 3x as effective. That much has been proven out in the field.
---
&gt; Plus I'm leveling lw up to craft my Devilsaur set, so I've been buying leathers when they are cheaper than others in the AH.
---
&gt; Will be mostly leveling in Un'Goro once I finish Tanaris and Hinterlands.
---
Same here. I *can* buy the set now, but it's just not the same as busting my balls to make it myself. Best of luck! (unless you're on Westfall, in which case I will fight you)
---
38 hunter, 61g
---
So... how is that name pronounced?
---
I have suspicions that most of those players were on private/pirate servers for years and it's the only game they know and any suggest changes threaten their very existence.
---
I've never seen anyone so buttmad over tatertots before.
---
I bet he's fun at parties.
---
Yeah, you even get a quest to kill one.
---
Thanks for the tip, hadn't thought of that. It'd have saved my ass  a few times if I'd known that.
---
Ahh..you are a “round down” type guy.
---
I just moved my hearth from SW to IF last night.  My reasoning is, closer to SM and Uldaman, not to mention easy flight to menethil to get to theramore which is closer to RFk/d than ratchet.
---
If you miss a boat because of that, it's 100% your own fault though. The boat stays long enough that you could fall off and swim &amp; run all the way back to the boat before it departs.
---
If you care about raiding then the helm is the way to go. It's BIS for a long time. Not having a mount won't gate you from content, not having the helmet will (not getting invited based on lack of gear).
---
Dont tell him people sell runs for it for like 50g
---
regrowth &gt; wrath &gt; bearform
---
Quit the game scrub
---
It's closer to Menethil harbor, which gives you access to two separate boats, it's got similar FP times to/from most zones as SW does, the professions are all centrally located, it's easier to get to the flight path, and it's full of lava. It's a no brainer.
---
Are you Brazilian or Portuguese?
---
This will never stop being funny to me.
---
Why does my game look like complete ass compared to this and I’ve got all my settings maxed out. This is a beautiful shot
---
WHAT ARE THOOSSEEE?!?!
---
I think those guys qualify for the endagered species list on US-Skeram. Right up there with alliance players.
---
Craaaaaaap missed that part.
---
With one target, I agree. But that is very, very slow and overly cautious for low level tanking. You could be smacking things in the face for 30% of party damage while keeping aggro while costing the healer less than its overhealing %. It's all about managing expectations imo.
---
Ive been farming these in the beginning. Iam at 10% per mob...
---
Shit i die to my own Hellfire and blame the healer...
---
&gt;Blizzard should .. before I, we sue the company in court with the support of consumers associations.
---
Let me know how that goes for you...
---
60 priest with epic mount 1300g with about 3k worth in items. If you’re looking for advice the word of the month is invest. Buy cheap now sell high later phases
---
Sad, but true. Best to just laugh it off I guess.
---
I had two warlocks in a stocks group (tankless run) last night, and I got to tell them to lifetap their brains out... They were excited (and were previously tapping gently). I had to use my own water (no mage), but the hunter pet that was tanking was barely taking damage so it was fine. I also wanted them to lifetap to 50% health so my big heal would heal them up entirely (vs. dealing with overhealing). :3
---
That said, lifetapping is a skill that needs to be mastered. I don't mind healing up lifetapping when I'm not worried about mana, or when I have tons of mage water I can sip at between pulls, but I'd rather not blow through a stack of water just to heal lifetapped dmg while also struggling to keep the group alive, y'know?
---
Are dal'rends pre bis for orc fury warriors or are there any dungeon drop alternatives?
---
Eventually you reach a point where you're not regenning enough health to replenish your mana bar by tapping periodically. If I'm in a dungeon and my mana gets super low, I'll wait until we're between pulls, tap my whole health bar and use bandages. 
---
It has literally never failed that my healer will heal me even though I'm actively healing myself. It makes no sense. It's a waste of healer mana and a waste of my bandages. 
---
Food also takes less time to replenish your health bar than water takes to replenish your mana bar. So it's quicker to tap and eat than to drink.
---
I lol'd
---
Never had any sort of encounter with them I don't think. Maybe had one in a dungeon run once but was unmemorable.
---
Ah... An older meme, but it checks out.
---
it's /equipslot, no?
---
Say wut...same
---
Warlock def falls behind mage in pve dps. Later on they catch up and do crazy damage, but are at all times limited by debuff limit and threat most of all. In pvp warlocks are very very strong. Once they get AQ and Naxx geared a SL lock not only pushes out very high damage in pvp, but they are pretty much unkillable outside of 3v1 encounters.
---
Warlocks are a long term high end goal for most players. Limited by spell hit and threat for a good chunk of vanilla. Very useful with high utility.
---
This doesn't seem to work anymore.. I've tried this countless of times, but nobody ever auto-walks off the boat (or to the boat) anymore.
---
I think Blizzard went back and forth on the idea, a lot of people were proposing a toggle between the two styles, however until Blizzard fully updates the world in BFA ( log in and look around it's pretty neat) I don't see them implementing anything like that. It was a good move on their part regardless for not having something like this at launch though.
---
I'd support it as long as they didn't screw it up.
---
idk :D dont have minning
---
At the risk of putting a target on my back, shouldn't there be a qualifier on 'streamers'? Im on Stalag in the big streaming guild and it all seems p chill.
---
Obviously thats an insider perspective but all the stuff i hear about streams seems like a bad fit for the ones on our realm. Unless im missing something. Queues?
---
I’m just waiting for them to role a new class that can’t participate in the cleave and they’re forced to play the game the normal way.
---
Oh, well yeah, that'll do it
---
I believe for pve trolls are the best for threat so they are the best
---
You still might get an upgrade in MC next week. Safer to wait until your MC BiS drops.
---
I have always asked first and people are more than willing to explain which has been great. But being LVL 35 I havnt come across anything super lucrative. Last night I got a very lucky drop on Holy Shroud soloing shimmering flats. Found out it's a big  twink piece for healers. On this retail wow website I seen it goes for 2200 gold so I was like holy fuck lol. But my guild leader says it goes for 2-3g on our server so I don't know to hang on or AH it. I need that mount money, I only buy the pertinent spells but man is it expensive to learn upgraded talents.
---
Devilsaur Gauntlets would like a word with you.
---
Lol, it is the first time, but when it delays the raid because the person dies again, everyone gets antsy.
---
Why would you handicap yourself out of spite?
---
If this is on Skeram I’ve definitely seen you around in general chat haha
---
I'd like a Mc Trash with coke &amp; fries please
---
"UR PULLING WAY TO SLOW SO ILL JUST DO IT FOR U TO SPEED THIS UP"
---
I'm trying to set up a 19 Warrior twink as a sidechick. I know what gear I need (and which Dungeons/Quests/Events to do for it). What I don't know is what I should explore before leveling. I'm a dwarf. All three cities, Strangle for Arena + a bit of fishing area for the hat. Westfall for Defias+Deadmines, Barrens for Wailing Caverns and Ashenvale for the Warsong entrance and BFD. Anything else?
---
From where can I enter Warsong? Only Ashenvale entrance and the cities or can I queue up anywhere?
---
Even more than that since he should be in melee hitting you. Not worth to scare him without a scatter shot or a trap.
---
But those are the reason *why* Un'Goro is nice :)
---
Or in the same amount of time I could kill 2 mobs and make twice as much.
---
Then there's the few of us who only look for names without retaliating at random enemies.
---
Because if they complete the dungeon a tiny bit faster they're going to earn money man, that's why they're doing it they need to feed their families you know.
---
For its Lego Rock Raiders
---
The guild I am in raids 9-12 pm Friday and Saturday night, horde side. But we already have a full team and don’t pug at all so people probably don’t know about us
---
I reserved Imahunter on my server lol
---
49 warrior 100g
---
Level 40, 
---
I got 60silver 
---
But I have a lovely mount ;)
---
Yeah i'm with you.   
---
I had one caster bitch out a rogue for winning truestrike despite not having the greatest dps and the group ended up falling apart before Jed, so he didn't even get a chance at his trinket.
---
Group loot is a hell of a thing, so if you're gonna take a loss personally, I don't want you in my run.   
---
So far only 3 people on my "No more invites" list.
---
I really want to get my loot but if someone else wins over me, then oh well. Especially as a key holder, I can throw these runs together anytime relatively quickly. These guys sit in LFG spamming for groups for what could be hours before they get a run, so who am I to say you deserve it any less than I do.
---
Did you watch the clip??! LOL
---
Don't you need the leather for leatherworking?
---
&gt; And yeah hellfire probably just has a high threat per damage ratio.
---
Is this a thing? I know some abilities specifically say "causes a high amount of threat", but I assumed that outside that, all damage was equal.
---
There's an Alliance &lt;Toxic&gt; guild on Myzrael too. Same advertisement and also a bunch of jackasses.
---
Druids are very good raid offtanks.
---
Dungeon leveling is good money, tons of greys, coin drops from mobs, and you have to plow through shit tons of mobs since you basically aren't questing so its that many more chances for greys/greens.
---
For me its Lego Rock Raider
---
This happened to me today
---
It's a meme in the gaming community from what I've seen. A "boomer" is a type of player, "millennial" is another. It doesn't actually have to do with how old a player is, or what generation a specific age range belongs to.
---
Reality is a large segment of the "older" playerbase in classic are millennials, while a lot of the "younger" ones that get called "millennial" are the gen after that.
---
Sweet Christmas, how'd you get in debt??
---
The battleground took hours to finish 15 years ago because we didn’t know what we were doing. 
---
We will see how that plays out this time.  It’s not like y’all lost EVERY match, either. But I will admit it was favored for us.
---
And y’all still get honor out of it. It’s not like you get nothing. This doesn’t really compare to the fact that I can’t get the best fishing pole in the game simply because I’m Alliance.
---
"before I, we sue the company in court with the support of consumers associations."
---
This is why people make fun of RPers.
---
You could say that about almost any addon, or QOL improvement that Blizz has made and thus ruined retail with. It's a better way to (insert QOL change) yada yada. All of these things add up and eventually you have BFA.
---
imo the most important part of macros is noise over. So for example my lesser heal macro looks something like
---
/stopattack
---
/cast [@mouseover] lesser heal
---
This lets you be able to hover over the spell to see what it does (not the most necessary but it will be when you start getting deeper and doing downranking stuff), stop using your wand and cast the spell wherever your mouse is at. So typically I use custom raid and party frames so that they’re close to center screen and I can just do it with a simple click of a button and never target off what I’m attacking. To change ranks it’s spellname (rank 2) for example. 
---
Doing this via mobile so there may be some formatting issues or something that got grabbed wrong from autocorrect. Let me know if something looks dumb
---
I play from 7pm, high pop but I'm levelling in STV ATM and it's not too bad. Maybe I've just been lucky with layers
---
Jumper cables failing was icing on the cake
---
Does this order look correct on your screen?
---
Health funnel wastes your hp, hp you need to life tap. I would just sac him and then resummon a new one after the mob is dead.
---
It's just a prank!
---
Gawd damn, found the high roller. Early bird?
---
I think he means that lots of folks incorrectly list stuff where it's undervalued so it's easy to buy it up en masse.  like listing a stack of 20 for a price where you intended it to be stacks of 5, or whatever.
---
Keeping her alive results in no loot at all from her, just the loot from emp.
---
Wrong. He can easily die to inquisitor and the elites before the RP event (I tire of this...) and the quest will not complete.
---
I thought it could be done the way you describe and had to redo the quest twice. Let me tell you, not fun as Alliance on PvP server.
---
Bullshit.
---
Playing warrior too so I'm trying to get my gear, especially weapons, as relevant as possible.
---
Got to do damage more than a wet noodle can do.
---
Blaumeux US has a few.
---
I wouldn’t farm Black Lotus unless you’re on a server that’s like medium. I had 300 herb for a while and literally never saw a single BL, even after a few hours of farming. Imo anyway.
---
Big fan of scamming assholes, are you?
---
It’s nice to see all my biggle bros in the comments, love to see everyone enjoying this server too!
---
Should have said something about wanting the shoulders right away.
---
I mean he's not wrong..
---
Blue troll with green mohawk... 
---
Bet you never seen that.
---
That is ahead of the curve. Median level is like 25 at this point. Roughly 70% of characters are below you.
---
I'd say out of all the runs I've done lately, half I received no water from the mage. Out of the remaining 50%: 40% of the runs I received 1 stack of water. The other 10% I received more than one stack (one time, I got three). It's wild.
---
Only if you cast tremor before you are feared :D
---
My question relates to gameplay for holy paladins and their use of Judgements/Seals in raids and 5 mans.
---
It looks tempting to keep Judgement of Wisdom/Light up on a boss - especially in a longer fight.  However, I'm struggling with the mana efficiency and practicality of this. 
---
Let's summarize a couple of facts to start with.
---
**Judgment** \- Cost: 6% total mana (estimating 6k to 8k mana pool, though this could be very  wrong) -  360 to 480 mana.
---
Judgments last 10 seconds, 40 with 3 talent points and refresh when paladin *hits* the target. 
---
**Seal of Wisdom** \- Cost 200 Mana 
---
90 mana per proc (chance depends on weapon speed).
---
 *Judgment* ***-*** 59 mana approximately 50% of the time. 
---
**Seal of Light** \- Cost 210 Mana, 
---
94 hp per Proc (chance depends on weapon speed). 
---
*Judgment -* 61 Hp approximately 50% of the time. 
---
With that out of the way, lets begin with seal of light since it seems a bit more straight-forward to me, and it comes down to do you have enough rogues / warriors that will be taking damage.  If yes, 600 mana heal for a group heal is definitely worth it.  If no, the tank gets healed, so this end up being an inefficient HoT. 
---
But now lets look at seal of wisdom.  At face value this looks amazing - I can get mana back and provide mana for my entire party / raid?  Sign me up!
---
Woah, woah, pump the breaks there, kid.  Let's look at the returns. 
---
For the paladin himself, it costs 550 to 700 mana.  To get that back, assuming the 50% proc rate, you have to auto attack the target 10 to 12 times.  Sure that doesn't sound too bad but you are the healer. You are going to be busy spamming Flash of Light, you know, in order to keep everyone alive.  How in this economy are you going to find time to swing your hammer?  And every time you let that debuff fall off, it takes another 600 mana and a GCD to reapply it. 
---
But what about all the mana for everyone else? Well, let's take a look.  As far as I am aware, this only procs on auto-attacks, not spell casts.  Hunters are going to love you, but who cares about them.  They had it too easy while leveling.  Let them suffer a bit.    
---
How about mages and warlocks though?  They will only get the mana back when wanding. So this won't come into play until well into the fight, and they should have brought potions anyways. 
---
The priest and druids, your partners in "keeping the green bar full", might like it.  But just like you, they have more important things on their minds, such as the gnome next to you that was just crushed into sticky red paste.
---
But hey,  Ret pallies will love you, so you got that going for you, which is nice.
---
Overall, I just don't see the practically, or the returns of using judgments as a holy paladin.     
---
Does anyone have any advice in using judgments as a holy paladin?  How much return do you get from them?  How do you maintain the debuff?
---
so long as the mobs dont hit you from behind, standing still shout be fine. abusing the ai to miss doesnt work as they turn at the same speed as you move, then mob parries dps and ends up tripple striking you in short succession which leads to death :(
---
Surprised they invited a level 7 Rogue to BRD
---
&gt; If it was itemized for healers, it would be specifically itemized for heals or mp5.
---
And if it were itemized for both (like it is) it'd be omni spell power.
---
SkarmTank is on Fairbanks, but hes not a huge streamer
---
50lvl warlock, 0boes, 380g. Mostly selling crating goods (long elegant feathers, shadow spider silk etc)
---
6% of the time it works every time.
---
You could have always done it then just reinvited later. We used to have a guy in guild that was a meme for getting kicked. Turned into a pretty funny situation actually.
---
yeah its on classic. I use it for emotes so I can give that quick /wave when people buff me or /pat to my pet when she is being a good cat.
---
Always a git gud reply
---
Yup, reflects on his true character... shame.
---
Pala tanks drink after every pull though....Zzzzz
---
EU.
---
The sad thing is there might be a case and it'll set a horrid precedent.
---
Nah, that item has a sub 5% dropchance and he wanted to use for leveling or what amounts to an offspec.
---
Thats a greed roll, you can shove the rest of your stupidity where the sun doesnt shine.
---
Lol, I started on time and I'm only 49
---
It happens. I did arm and lib last night and barely had 10 things to sell. I had a couple stacks of silk, 2 or 3 grey items to vendor, a couple greens, and a jade or something else useless.
---
Meanwhile I go in gnomer and my bags are full in 15 minutes.
---
Perspective really is something.
---
If the dps is taking damage while kiting you know it's a bad mage.
---
Is the ring valuable? Stats seem bad
---
That's, really sad.
---
There's basically nothing work making other than devilsaur leggings if you're looking for something to sell as a LW (may vary based on realm, but I doubt by much), so unless he's still in need of materials to level it to 300, skinning is safe to drop. Of course keeping it around for Thorium Dongerhood rep is not the worst of ideas.
---
&gt;Enhancement isn’t taken into the raids for dps
---
Hunters aren't either.
---
&gt; Well, considering how elitist and gatekeepy this sub can get I'm going to place all of it being the way I said it was
---
So you like making blanket generalizations regarding people you know nothing about? I don't, but hey, that's cool. 
---
&gt; But hey you can think it's not like that, that's cool.
---
This doesn't exclude the point I made. I simply asked if it wasn't at least a possibility. You then reply with "No", without really giving any arguments as to why it's not a possibility.
---
Lvl 44, 90g
---
I usually just run with autoloot, and have no issues in dungeons looting the pockets if needed. Healers/casters usually need to take a break sometime. 
---
Of course, I'm usually just picking everything on a pull, and not using an opener macro. This also gives the tank time to get a little threat too
---
Lvl 51 human priest, shadow specc’d with some discipline. That being said I’ve always been running as healer. 
---
Last night I ran Mara and we had no wipes, only death was the tank during princess. Can I hold off on switching to holy until 60, or should. I switch if I want to heal for ST and Scholo
---
Troll shaman named Trolliosis.

Great for Sillithus demon on Stave of the Ancients quest
---
I haven't experienced this before, but I often wonder when I step in and assist a random stranger if I'm overstepping my boundaries.  While killing mobs is killing mobs to me, some times I *wanti* to see if I can take down a particular mob - knowing that if I fail I am going to have to rez.  When someone comes along and helps wipe out the mob by being far more powerful than me, it might frustrate me.  But then I can just wait for it to respawn, assuming it isn't a rare.
---
I don’t agree nor disagree with you Bc I don’t play retail. But keep allowing major addons or game changing mechanics and over time you’re left with trash. That’s why we’re here. That’s why there’s Classic. 
---
Is classic the same as BC now?
---
you don’t seem to realize that logs aren’t an argument. I can post a video of a Honda Civic beating a corvette in a race. It doesn’t mean the civic is faster or has higher top end speed. 
---
Again, your logs are shitty evidence because they don’t show whether or not people used optimal rotations and they don’t show the gear differences.
---
I pity the people who have to deal with you on a regular basis.
---
Fellow rogue here, I bought the devilsaur. The next day the price spiked 80g for them. I bought them when I hit 60 2 weeks ago, and without serious farming I'll be able to get my epic mount today. imo getting your prebis if you plan on raiding, especially with how many rogues there are, gives you a better competitive edge than getting your mount does.
---
I'm not talking about pulling just one mob at a time either. Just single targeting one out of the pack. Just making sure were on the same page. Thats not always feasible though I agree especially in randoms. Then thats where its easier to hold aggro with the two hander.
---
Can’t wait to see you getting around in your Ford Pinto!  Just don’t crash it or you’ll have to walk back to your corpse!
---
Unless it’s in another characters possession. Just wanted to clarify :)
---
Reason being Horde has better racials. PvP attracts tryhards more so than PvE.
---
buy the pants
---
Quite the opposite happened, If you’re gonna gank me while questing 5 levels higher or kill the quest giver. You’re gonna get the /spit, I give the same energy I receive.
---
This has been my experience. Wanted to play a ranged class, but the downtime with drinking made me want to pull my hair out. Locks are nice but I ended up feeling like every encounter was very same-y. 
---
Hunters have super strong pets, so they can send it in and auto shot if they want. If they want a faster pace, I'm pretty generally able to chain pull groups of 3+ mobs depending on their level and whether or not ive upgraded my bow recently. Lots of abilities to use, lots of pet micromanagement, aggro management. Multidotting, aoe, direct damage, cc, kiting, strong focus on positioning and distancing, melee weaving when you're dealing with multiple mobs. Traps are kinda gimmicky but powerful and pretty satisfying to use well. Aspect of the cheetah is amazing and convenient, and using it well in and out of combat makes things so much smoother. 
---
You can run with no Mana with decent efficiency by melee-cycling if you get slow weapons, which is awesome. I easily topped damage in a WC run by melee cycling when I realized halfway through that 1600 arrows want nearly enough lol. 
---
Cool flavor stuff, too. Found a few dead bodies a few nights ago and used track humanoids to find a levelling warrior and gank him. 
---
Ammo and pet food will totally take over your bags and the pets can be a pita to train (when you're going for a new rank of claw or bite and have to run around with no pet for a while things can get sketch) but overall I think it's more than worth dealing with. Hunter levelling is like cruise control, but also you can turn cruise control off and blow quest mobs to hell if you want.
---
100% agree, so far of their guild mates I've run instances or done group quests with, 4/5 were entitled arrogant pricks, who were not even good at their jobs.  The one dude was super nice though, so you can't just assume based on the guild I suppose.
---
Just listen to where majority of LFG messages go.  
---
On server where I'm playing it's SM, so I assume that it's around 35-40.
---
This because both keys and lock picking require leveling beyond just your class.
---
Then you’d be correct
---
Now this is some good highbrow comedy
---
I was out in shimmering flats yesterday. I got 4.5 gold in an hour of just killing whatever I seen I was legit surprised at how much stuff I got. This doesn't include this dagger or Holy Shroud head piece.
---
Because we cant see the rest of the conversation. 
---
OP could have easily whispered some retarded shit like "WhAt nOt eveN a ThAnK yOu?"
---
My point was I rolled a blue male troll with green mohawk and everyone is exactly the same.
---
I soloed her as a feral druid while trying to get the ring.
---
Should have been a rogue
---
I gues... But still, you REALLY should be playing with a guild and making friends... Otherwise you're gonna have some intense pain.
---
Awesome m8, good to hear you're having a good time. Love to see players who never played before, still enjoying the good old wow style. 
---
I still love that they brought back vanilla(classic) wow. I did play during vanilla and all the way to legion (with brakes in between), but this is so mutch better. Loving every moment of it!
---
Enjoy and have fun!
---
Wolves aren't PvP pets anyway, they are raid pets for howl, so that .1 is extremely insignificant.
---
If you are asking "should I level this wolf for PvP" I'd say no, get a cat later on or level one with you. If you are asking "If I plan on doing primarily PvE is it worth it to level this pet for a slight PvP bonus" the answer is probably no, it's likely not actually worth it.
---
If you are saying "I want to have the best wolf possible and deathmaw is hard to get, should I just level a sfk wolf or will that be too much of a detriment to level with" the answer is that the wolf won't be too bad, you can level fine with it but it will definitely be slower.
---
As a healer I can do fine with only 30% mana in most fights, VERY few fights require 100% of my mana and some dungeons I can in it's entirety without drinking.
---
That doesn't mean I don't try to fill it up as much as possible to reduce downtime, which is basically what I expect of my group\raid.
---
You are missing my point and I give up trying to explain it now.
---
&gt; Get off your high horse man.
---
Says the person demanding free shit.
---
Ya u might need to defend flag in wcg alot and sometimes in ab but its not like rogue is the only class doing that and if you do it its most likely cus ur in a premade with assigned roles tryharding, other than that rogues are made for pvp, specially out in the open world.
---
I remember people using the term back in the day as well. Also [google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=tankadin,palatank) shows tankadin as the more popular term.
---
Level up first aid fool
---
Layering isn’t going away anytime soon. There have been no announcements as to the end date. Until there is an announcement, prices will continue to decline as more people hit 60 and farm skins to oversaturate the market
---
Of course I'd make it clear, and I'm sorry I'm not letting someone take a BoE worth 500g to "equip". That's just not fair to the group
---
Kay
---
Lvl 53, 445g.. looted and sold a freezing band xD
---
It's to be expected, especially from a rogue. 
---
I personally think pots are dishonorable, but it should be agreed upon before starting.
---
&gt; I have always asked first and people are more than willing to explain which has been great. 
---
You are one of the good ones. Keep doing that! Just don't get caught with your pants down if you can help it :)
---
&gt; Last night I got a very lucky drop on Holy Shroud soloing shimmering flats. Found out it's a big twink piece for healers. On this retail wow website I seen it goes for 2200 gold so I was like holy fuck lol. But my guild leader says it goes for 2-3g on our server so I don't know to hang on or AH it.
---
Aye there is likely going to be a distinct difference between what the price is on retail and now in Classic as the markets are substantially different in a myriad of ways. 
---
&gt; I need that mount money, I only buy the pertinent spells but man is it expensive to learn upgraded talents.
---
Indeed it is. It's a bit late now if you haven't done it, but I usually level with at least 1 "gathering" profession (Skinning, Mining, Herbalism), and often 2 of them. Then when I have money for my mount I'll go back and learn a profession I want. This time around I initially went with Mining/Enchanting (to disenchant the early green items and sell the mats on AH) and then unlearned Enchanting at level 40 and started skilling up Engineering.
---
you only replace devilsaur once you get both nightslayer gloves AND bloodfang pants
---
Seriously, who eats tater tots with anything besides yellow mustard
---
I saw a Druid named “Shreducation” and complimented him on a well-crafted name.
---
Sub Daggers (probably the strongest pvp build overall):

---
You can swap a talent from imp ambush into camo depending on how often you use ambush, your crit rating, and how important maxing your stealth speed is to you. You could also swap points from ruthlessness into remorseless attacks for more 1v2 potency.
---
I beat him twice, once without bandages and the second time with a bandage. I'm pretty sure he is just new at the game, there was nothing discussed before the duel he was just salty I guess.
---
For this reason I'd support RP xmog, essentially if you aren't flagged, your gear would look however you xmog'ed it to, but as soon as you flag you pop back to how your gear looks by default. Reading gear by look is too important, I've been able to assess many a threat by item model alone.
---
The benefit is the player would be able to look how they like when in home territory but it would be purely cosmetic and not effect them in the outside world. When you're in town you're relaxing, gaining rest bonus, that sorta thing. Perhaps the paladin wants to unwind a bit without their plate on. This is the only way I support it though, any other way creates issues imo
---
I also understand people carried RP sets, this would be purely QoL that doesn't effect gameplay. Still incredibly unlikely but it's an idea
---
&gt; For example, you MAY use Poison Cleansing Totem ONCE before 40 if you're lucky, so just skip it and spam Cure Poison instead if you must. 
---
The thing is if you don't have situational spells while you're leveling, you aren't going to learn to use them in those situations. It's probably not going to occur to you. 
---
You're right that there's a balance and it makes sense to skip some stuff that's never going to be useful (I didn't train higher ranks of wrath or starfire on my feral druid until I hit 60). Some spells actually are useful for groups though and it makes sense to train them and start trying to find ways to use them.
---
I had a similar interaction where I ran into someone else fishing in the bay of storms and chatted with them briefly and when I went to tell them I was heading out and good luck on their fishing they had ignored me
---
Til ty dude
---
And corruption have a chance of triggering Nightfall.
---
The mage mana cost reduction talent also reduces frost spell threat.
---
Dude's having a day, best just leave him be.
---
Is there any reason to not go tribal leatherworking? I am a 35 Hunter so I have a bit to decide but I'm at 220 leatherworking right now, leveling as I go.  I'm on a normal server, alliance.
---
It really does surprise me how ungrateful a lot of people are for you saving their ass or helping them out. I've rezzed a warrior, healed him to full, buffed him, and all he did was target me, de target, then run away. I have a lot of stories like that unfortunately.
---
I’d more readily take the stance that devilsaur will get cheaper over time as more people hit 60 and start farming it.
---
During the server debacle I was was one of the players that rolled on an RP server with the intention of griefing the RP players. Unfortunately when I got there, there was just a bunch of people like me who didn't have time to sit in a queue. There wasn't any RP at all. That's when I realized what had to be done- I started trolling the server jumpers by RP-ing...
---
If it makes you feel better I was in the exact same situation as you with my 40 troll hunter. I only picked troll because it's the best choice for PvE but I wanted to reroll an orc hunter for PvP. After not playing for a week I started my journey as an orc hunter last friday and I'm already level 28 and having a blast. It goes way faster leveling up the second time because you know exactly where to go and what to do. Also as you said you got a nice bankroll to buy op items for lower levels which helps a lot. DO IT! =)
---
I understand, but mana control is important. If the healer and all the dps have to drink after every pull we aren't being very efficient. The healers job is to keep people *alive*, not necessarily full, if a warlock is consistently lifetapping down to &lt;10 %HP he's wasting healer mana. At that point he should just drink or balance his health and mana, like warlocks can and should. I can pull while the dps is drinking, gives me time to build aggro, but I'll wait for the healer.
---
Ele shaman is super bursty and has a pretty big toolkit, but enh probably not unless you like rng
---
Keep it up, alliance.  You'll get yours.
---
I did the same thing til like level 20
---
Well I started playing day 1 and took 3 weeks off work. I hit 60 14 days after launch.
---
I've found most groups to be chill.
---
I've actually never been in a dungeon group with a legit toxic person yet and I'm level 58 and have run everything up to BRD multiple times.
---
Gravediggers :)
---
you're kill on sight for 90% of the alliance pop on our server
---
Uh yeah first aid is fine
---
Yes it does, because your threat bottleneck becomes a DPS bottleneck.
---
&gt; picking 'Greed' because I want all to like me
---
If it is Bind on Pickup cloth gear and is an upgrade for you, no one worth worrying about will like you less for hitting need.
---
*Purely* subjective there on when you boarded the boat.  Not everyone's timing is perfect to come aboard the second it arrives....
---
if you want to just get to 60, the lemon addon is pretty good
---
but if its your first character, just get questie and go at your own pace. if you rush to 60 youre likely to get burned out
---
I declined his duel to begin with but he kept asking so I dueled him, no rules were discussed
---
Fucking stud over muffin over here!
---
How many girls do you fuck a month?
---
It's too early for this internet, I'm going back to bed
---
My lock is lvl 39. 
---
Now I want to reroll mage again. damn it.
---
I buy items from people in SE from the Trade Chat, and i usually sell it for 20%-40% more than what I bought it for. Usually I bargain my way down to a lower price as well. I just finished buying a wave of new spells from level 25 and up
---
I wish they had an age restricted server, like 18+, 25+ and enforced it. That would weed out so many plebs.
---
This is almost exactly how I ended up forever maining a NE Hunter - except I started a Hunter then decided to give other things a try.  Didn't take long before I noped right back to my bow and jungle cat.
---
Gotcha!
---
I was talking about it with a guildy last night and he brought up something that I had forgotten about: Scouting near raid bosses with the eye, having the boss aggro on it, freaking everyone out, only to kill the eye and go back in place.
---
Stealthed opener:
---
Garrote (+ pickpocket)
---
Slice n Dice
---
Sinister Strike until mob is low (should be 2 to 4 sin strikes)
---
Evis
---
I'm a Tauren and love it. Aoe stun is pretty good and I have survived pulls with &lt;1% hp plenty of times. Love  to stump when mage spams aoe spell and takes all the aggro, I stun them and let them burn.
---
The ol' "waiting-for-AV-gates-to-open" special. I haven't seen this one in a long time.
---
Open world yes. But very cool down reliant and susceptible to dying if you don’t get opener. They aren’t amazing at anything in PvP and have hard counters as well.
---
level 40 hunter, 63g - havent bought mount yet QQ.
---
I'm leveling with max shatter and max imp blizz. Make concessions elsewhere in ur talent build.
---
That would be great if you could!
---
I was really wanting to roll troll mage because of how over represented UD are in general but knowing I was going very pvp heavy I ended with UD. Turns out, I have come across many fights where wotf saves my ass and troll mages are very plentiful on my server, plus the animations are cool.
---
"Most people"
---
That's why you killed a lvl 36 and a lvl 40
---
While "most people" didn't moved a finger ?
---
And only a 42 reacted way after most of the fight
---
This was sort of a joke but thanks for the info :)
---
Is this opposite to what BiE means? Bind on Equip?
---
Glad you're enjoying it and getting the Vanilla experience as well.  You will love the priest, great healer and shadow is insane for PVP.  I've noticed quite a few new players come to Wow, which suprises me but really glad they get to enjoy the game :)
---
Your threat will not bottle neck if you get the dps to wait a few sec.
---
Onyxia dps ia kinda wierd, since alot of classes need to wait alot before attacking since onyxia's threat is wierd.
---
Lvl 24, 22, 22. About 450g.
---
If this is the best offhand you have at hand, then yes. Dal'Rend is a very good MH weapon. For the offhand, I'd try to farm the Dal'Rend Offhand too. The set bonus is very good. In the mean time, Mirah's Song from the Scholo quest chain would be a solid offhand upgrade that does not require any loot luck.
---
What does the ! Modifier do?
---
I have a Razer Orbweaver so the binds are just free keys that work for the format of the keypad
---
I’ve had shadow specced priests healing in UBRS just fine.
---
Having at least 1 enhance in raid for enhanced weapons totems for warriors/rogues usually isnt a bad idea. Once nightfall axe plan drops in phase 3 you'll be primarily stuck totem weaving and auto attacking bosses with it to debuff the boss for casters. If you want a solid raid spot however, resto would be the go to
---
Thats amazing. But also omg luck more scrub
---
That's the type of guy who has a tinder and the bio is all about how he owns a house.
---
Nice, was it hard?
---
Roll on it.  Just as if a rogue had picked the lock. 
---
You spend resources crafting the key, the rogue spent resources leveling his lockpicking, the rest of the group spent on resources that allowed you group to reach the point you are at.  
---
Each class / profession brings it own unique abilities and everyone is contributing, so everyone gets a shot at the rewards.
---
Note - people often forget that most other classes have reagents they have to buy in order to buff / battle res etc. - You don't see those classes asking for people to bring them reagents in order to be given the buff.
---
Yes your in the wrong place. Your threatening to sue unless things go exactly your way in a MMO game. Completely brain dead RP nerd. Because of this post I’m making a zandalar non RP character to troll on. Ty for idea
---
Well I was in Ulda and the tank/heals wiped twice at the start of tash mob areas fights for some reason. The warlock soul stoned and res'd himself after both wipes. Even after the first time I asked why the healer wasn't SS'd and got no replies or backup on that concept from the group after the first wipe nor the second one.   
---
When shit hit the fan the third time I left because it was over an hour and we weren't even at the final boss yet.
---
I'm giving up on it. Its burning me out , I'll just wait on T1 chest
---
You get less exp if someone heals you i think. Can’t think of any other reason.
---
Sundering all the mobs allows the extra adds to stay on the tank and not go to the healer.
---
Trying to sunder balance all the mobs won't help keep the aggro off of the DPs if DPs is trying to DPs more than one mob. 
---
Also it's best practice to DPs one mob at a time as it's more efficient .
---
My fav is / was Tauren named Milkhunter
---
Can you? Last I checked you can't use them in forms so it would be silly if you can make them in forms.
---
well i mean, did you heal him without his consent? that could land you in some serious trouble. "his health bar showed he was asking for it" isn't gonna fly in court buddy.
---
Trunks stopped at 39 because mounts ruin the experience of that kind of play at 49, then at 59 you might as well be 60 to do other content. 
---
The 19/29/39 scene was pretty crazy back in the day.
---
How much work would it be to make an alert when a devilsaur is detected? I used to have an addon in woltk that would alert when a rare was spotted, would be very useful farming devilsaurs in case one is walking behind you, or spawns and you miss it.
---
I am not mixing up anything. The mage has not pulled a single mob until after the healer has said go. It’s a split second after, but it’s after regardless.
---
Frost barrier goes first. You can milk it by using frost barrier and waiting ~30 seconds before entering combat, that way you can use it twice in one fight
---
There's a green sword called Dimensional blade of agility that's far better than anything else right now for your offhand
---
Overhealing can pull aggro. 
---
But for the most part 90% of the dps playing classic atm are zoomers from retail who go all out on different mobs at the start of a pull. When I tank I always mark targets but it never works. Kids will blow up the X then get asshurt in chat about it. 
---
Basically if you play dps classic there's a 90% of you being a tard.
---
HOW is this something people DO NOT know ? fucks's sake read the tooltip , idiot
---
Too obvious man, try again.
---
All warriors tend to struggle until they get their level 40 tree-topper. Below that they're limited in damage abilities.
---
Your low level AoE is Thunderclap. It tickles the enemy feet, and hits 4 of them. You can also try to hit everything with Rend, but I generally only ever use it in pvp vs rogues so they can't restealth. Once you hit your 30s and get Whirlwind, and Cleave (and if Arms Sweeping Strikes), AoE gets better.
---
Hamstring is useful utility. If you don't have a mage with frostbolt, a rogue with crip, or a pally with justice, spread it liberally on anything that might run away.
---
Heroic strike hits hard, but costs 15 rage plus what you'd be getting off your next swing. Cleave is similar, costing 5 rage more, causing less threat, and not refunding rage on a failed attack. If you're in a group and fighting more than one thing, cleave away. Once you get your 40 point talent, you'll basically never use heroic strike until you run out of other rage dumps as a dps warrior.
---
Slam resets your swing timer, but if you have a full bar of rage and nothing's hitting you or moving anywhere, dump it into slam. You get that in your 30s, and it's always a good idea to use a 2-hander if you use that.
---
Overpower and Whirlwind are also options; however Overpower has the dodge requirement trigger and whirlwind costs 25 rage. They're stance locked.
---
Arms is suited to swinging a 2-hander around. If you expect to be running a specific 2-hander weapon then Arms will be your go-to. Mortal strike hits like a truck with a big slow weapon. If you're Human, Sword Spec means more rage when it procs.
---
Fury is more weapon agnostic. Hell, i've used staves as a Fury specced warrior. Bloodthirst doesn't hit quite as hard but is independent of your weapon since it's 45% of your attack power. Mortal Strike by comparison with a 1-hander hits like a wet noodle. You're limited in stance dancing until 45+, and that's if you go down Arms as your secondary tree.
---
That's a very good point, I'll aim for that one. Thank you.
---
Because DM is Dire Maul too.
---
No, they are multiple characters working with less efficiency than multiple character being independently controlled.  Number of people behind the keyboard has no relevance at all we are talking about effects cause by in game characters.
---
Me and another dude both rolled 69 the other day 😋Winner rolled 96
---
Youl have better luck finding groups as a tank.  Youl quest a lot easier too
---
Oh shit... So no changing actual targets.  Just hover over a portrait and don't click anything?    If so....nice
---
I had a similar thing happen. Guy convinced me that he could dupe items and all he had to do was kill me 10 times. (For anyone who doesn’t know: that makes you drop all your gear!) then log out and back in. Logged back in to all my stuff being gone. Ah to be young and stupid.
---
Hmm I don't know, the video isn't mine, maybe try to post a comment on the video?
---
Maybe stole his leather on accident? The guy could have Thought he just ran up and skinned the mob he had just killed. I might would be a little mad also. Just an observation, no clue what happened.
---
Lol this almost happened to me yesterday but I survived with 1%
---
I just like the female animations.
---
Run speed 100
---
Reg mount speed 160
---
Epic mount speed 200
---
25% faster
---
This to me is false. Even when I was alone, the pattern took hours to respawn. I went through 2 server restarts before I found it and it didn't respawn from the restarts either. The pattern is on a timer, but to say it's 30 mins tops is misleading. You can spend hours there and still come out empty.
---
Why would you post this again?
---
*pop*
---
&gt;If the dps dies, it's their own damn fault.
---
Caveat to this. If the dps dies because they stood in shit or pulled aggro it's their own damn fault. I can't count how many times I've died because the tank couldn't handle facing a mob properly.
---
It definitely won't be anywhere.  I don't remember when the battlemasters in the cities were created, but it will probably only be from the battlemaster out in the world.
---
I think you've outlined yourself a good map.  Just keep in mind if there are any quest items you want, to also open up those areas.
---
Yeah, but I don’t want to tank. I’m not good at it and quite frankly I hate doing it, so I’d rather not.
---
Probably has more to do with how social dynamics have shifted in the last 15 years. People remember the internet of 2004
---
Just advertise your group as ZF full run and you will be fine. I ran it twice and managed to form a group in 15 minutes just from Tanaris general. Everyone was chill and we did all the quests.
---
Can you roll on mounts you don't have the riding skill for? Like when rolling for the Deathcharger's Reins in Stratholme.
---
What streamers does Zandalar tribe have? Been playing on there since launch, haven't seen any shenanigans.
---
I'd like to know by how much so I can practically make use of it, ie make a real judgement from actual numbers when the crossover happens for agility to become better/worse or equal to strength/stamina.  You can't really do anything with the knowledge that it's slightly better at lower levels.
---
Or maybe it's only legal in contested zones?
---
fuck off
---
&gt; have dispell
---
I don’t think you understand. Locks can dispel the mage’s shield off. Mages can only remove a curse (and can’t do shit about Corruption and other dots). 
---
Mages can’t reset the fight since you can dispel poly from yourself. 
---
Add those to the ridiculous tankiness of warlocks and locks have a hard time losing to mages.
---
Unless you take damage from them it’s difficult to know exactly how hard they hit. It’s all good bro lol
---
If I had a gold for every time someone pulled a large group while I was sitting drinking with less than 20% mana and out of range, I'd probably have my epic mount money already.
---
Don't forget to hot the lock too
---
Better logo too. https://images.app.goo.gl/bokkMVX4QVnWHJ4z6
---
[Just walk away...](https://youtu.be/XPY5P0TaC4k)
---
Because i wanted to play with my friends.
---
For gold making 100%, PvP depends who you ask, warlocks are better duelers and 1v1, but I'd say mage is better in group PvP but that's my opinion 
---
Personally I'd go warlock because everyone and there mother is playing mage and I just find them more active tbh....
---
What QoL did you miss? I honestly haven't missed a single thing from BFA.
---
Be like me, see 3 bindings 2 from garr 1 from baron. Be a shaman :(
---
It's Classic. The game is literally telling everyone they all suck and can't do it solo. No one is excluded from that, which is what makes soloing things that much more precious.
---
I was just thinking the same thing.  I didnt use most of my healing spells while leveling because it was a waste of mana (and after 40 a gigantic waste of mana because of having to go back into shadowform).  Guess ill just use PW:S on all those warrior tanks, right? :)
---
What UI is that?
---
\^ If the warrior cannot keep threat on a few corrupted mobs, he is in arms or a bad tank.
---
They can't change the Official LookingForGroup channel name as it is moderated by Blizzard.  If you're in a channel moderated by a player it isn't official and whoever has ownership can change it.
---
Made me giggle
---
Does autocarrot addon do anything with mithril spurs or riding skill gloves?
---
LFG is player created.  Join LookingForGroup instead.
---
You can’t trinket trap.
---
OK first if the Mage is pulling he needs to be pulling with PW:S AND mage bubble. Second, you should start casting heal when he's at 100%, and focus on cancelling it if he doesn't need it just before it completes. 
---
Most of the time you want to efficiently use mana but AoE pulls are survival sprints. You *want* to be oom at the end. The mage certainly will be oom and you'll be waiting for him to drink anyway.
---
Without knowing the tank's aggro in relation to the dps' damage (generating their own aggro), it's hard to answer the question. From the sounds of this specific issue, it certainly wasn't your fault, the healer. Either the tank was shit at generating and holding aggro, or the dps were shit at scaling themselves to allow the tank a reasonable chance to obtain said aggro. 
---
I would even argue that as long as the tank was doing something tank-like, it was on the dps to scale their damage accordingly. I've been in runs where the tank was using their abilities, but was terrible at it. Our choice was find a new tank or dps smarter. We chose the latter, utilizing CC's more (lower leveling dungeon, not normally something we'd have bothered with) and doing less dps. The run was longer, but we felt it was better than finding another tank and risking the same problem anyway. And hopefully the tank learned a bit more for next time.
---
It’s not better. DW is better, check logs.
---
I have no idea, why you ask me?
---
32 rogue, 45g.
---
I got lucky in SMGY and nobody wanted to roll on a chest cause they were in a hurry.  I rolled, asked, looted, got 2 blues from it.
---
The group stopped pulling for 1 straight minute trying to figure out what had happened.
---
Level an alt up to 5 and park it at the bank/AH.  Whenever you get stuff that you can auction for more than vendoring would give, dump it in the mail to the alt.  Log that guy in every once in awhile to sell stuff.
---
As a healer myself, I don't care about dps health you should be focusing the tanks target. If I do heal you be happy otherwise shut up. Hell after fights I don't heal dps they better have brought food lmao
---
Monkey is BiS for tanks on Taladril's.
---
Read some of his other comments, dudes just a dick in general lol.
---
Awesome thanks for your help !
---
Damn dude. I’ve been 6-8 hr/level since like 35 and I’m 47 now
---
I said Jesus lmao after seeing him running from 5 razormane things
---
Will do thank you !
---
If i am RPing in a room in an Inn and i have a guy barge in, strip buttnaked and dance on the table in the middle i feel like this is something Blizzard should handle on a RP server. Not much to "police" there from a community side.
---
Skinning and herbalism work in form but not mining.
---
I remember them removing FD + drink during vanilla at some point and I remember FD+traps being a thing. How sad that they don't work anymore
---
Yeah you should respec feral.  It is orders of magnitude faster leveling and you can still heal dungeons.  You'll have Heart of the Wild soon and that will really help your ability to heal dungeons reliably.  
---
It sucks that there is this bias against druid healers, but the reality is that tanks are more in demand and apparently there are enough healers for groups to be picky.
---
I would suggest joining a guild and building a reputation as a reliable healer and you will be asked to heal for groups that way.  But yeah, respec feral and go back to resto (or do 0/30/21 Heart of the Wild) later.
---
This somehow isn't correct b/c obviously XL cables are already out.
---
It was channel 4 looking for group.  I have been logged into it since launch.  The name was hijacked
---
Yea I am in a guild with a couple buddies from high school 1 of which ran naxx in vanilla and got server first glaives in bc. They out leveled me due to work. But it’s not running pugs because it’s refreshing to meet people who are good spirited. But it’s donkey meeting negative nancies. But it’s fun asking people if they are interested in joining. Need to get some bodies
---
It's like when someone is like "Pulled the SSR on first ticket, F2P BTW." in gacha games... ah the pain of envy!!!
---
CONGRATULATIONS!!! X,D
---
I think he was attempting suicide and you interfere
---
No, I'm saying that doing something solely because you want to make things worse for random people is a psychopathic trait. Doing it for the challenge, for the rewards once honor is turned on, or doing it to protect your faction members that they've been killing is all well and good but when you find a random low level from the other faction and camp his corpse for no reason other than "ruining someone else's day with 0 repercussions to yourself is sometimes fun and stress reducing" then yeah, that's bit psychopathic.
---
it handles carrot on a stick only. if you just have it in ur bags u dont need to think about equipping it ever again. as it changes back to what u normally use when u dismount
---
Well, if it is the "LFG" channel, that is a private-server-player-created channel.
---
They won't be able to change the "LookingForGroup" Blizzard official channel.
---
So, a player changed a player-created channel. Nothing can really be done about that.
---
Both of these guys are shit heads lol. I stopped reading at "I'm better than you in life". Yeah...you posted it here....sure you are.
---
disagree in my experience - ungoro has a few quests that take you to winter spring, and there’s a felwood quest you get in IF. made more sense for me to do ungoro first and then stop in felwood on the way to winterspring. I also found there were less quests in general there so being higher was helpful
---
Cooking is optional if you've got friends or guildies who will cook for you, but I recommend it.
---
Fishing is a must. Right now, winter squid is available to fish (some fish are seasonal) and can be cooked into food that increases agility. The buff stacks with potions and at least one other buff that increases agility. 
---
The squid will be very expensive once the period it's available comes to an end, so you're best served stocking up on it while you can with your own fishing skill.
---
Hang strong the pay off will be worth it.
---
How does anyone write a novel in the World of Warcraft chat window?
---
Emp typically drops 2 items, you might double check the loot table.
---
Yeah, I neglected feral tanks even exist.
---
At least he has chicken
---
I’ll look into it.  Thank you for the help
---
If you’re fighting 1v1 in wpvp, and your opponent wastes time trying to kill your pet, they aren’t going to kill you, too.
---
Me and my gf with matching names are lvl 34,no regrets yet. Why regrets?
---
I usually toss a shield on them and if they somehow keep aggro a renew, maybe a heal depending on how hard they get hit. But it's all relative to how much mana I have left.
---
What healing addon is that?
---
Trolling is an internet tradition. People being flat out assholes over nothing wasn't as common.
---
That’s only because I never play mage so I don’t make water for the 20 minutes I’m waiting for a tank to become available.
---
I use VuhDo for healing.
---
I find that ot seems like the OG realms prior to launch have no issues but all the extra ones that Blizz spit out after seeing the demand for the game are the ones that seem to have a struggle.
---
Maybe not from BFA, but the added linked flight paths in some areas, more forgiving graveyards in some zones, lowered respec costs, instance summoning stones (added in TBC), just little things.
---
Okay this should work, thanks mate!
---
Very true.
---
Chaotic Good: I would follow him around and keep healing him
---
You'd be surprised how easy it can be to see stealthers, particularly in close quarters like BB.
---
This person isn't asking a serious question.
---
Haha amaxing :D
---
Fuck you, haven't even seen single Slaghide drop, let alone useful roll. Had to settle for Spirit/Stam Ata'lai shoulders too, after like 50 clears of ST.
---
Get leatrix addon. You can max zoom out. I dont know if im helping....
---
There are a few golden rules to following when DPSing or Healing to manage agro:
---
* Do not attack or heal during a pull. The exception is, if the healer broke the rule (and pulls agro) and the tank can't (or isn't trying to) get agro from the healer, a dps can pull agro to save the healer; preferably this would be a dps that can kite the agro or tank it because they wear heavy armor. If it's a single mob that can be CCed by you, you can CC the mob to save the healer instead, just don't make it worse by fearing the mob into other mobs. 
---
* As a priest healer, do not PW:Shield a rage based tank. This robs them of much needed rage and will drastically affect their ability to hold agro on mobs. Exception: if they are going to die, then shield them to buy time for a good heal. 
---
* As a healer, if the damage on the tank is manageable and predictable, you can let them get to about half health before healing them on the initial pull. The longer you can safely wait before dropping a big heal on them, the more time they will have to build threat. HoTs are good to not pull a lot of agro, but the rule still applies. The longer you can wait, the better, just don't let them die. One way you can more safely do this is by casting and cancelling heals until you need to let it land. So you could start casting a heal at 75%, and if the tank doesn't need it by the time it would finish, move a little bit to cancel it. Then start casting again and repeat until they need the heal. 
---
* Whenever new mobs join the fight, make sure you follow all the same rules mentioned for a normal pull. 
---
* It's best to wait to see the tank throw out 1-2 attacks before digging into mobs. 
---
* It's easier to pull agro when you are in melee range. Don't be in melee range if you don't need to be. 
---
* As a healer, your top priority is to keep the tank and yourself alive. I would then prioritize anyone you see actively trying to save you from agro. Don't run out of mana saving other people and let your tank die because you worried too much about a DPS that isn't managing threat well. 
---
If you are following all the above points, you are doing awesome! If you are STILL pulling threat, then the tank might not be doing that great of a job (/sob).  
---
Another thing that can help is marking a target with Skull. Anyone in the group can mark, although typically it would be the tank. If he isn't marking, feel free to mark something. Hopefully the DPS will focus on that target first and buy the tank a little bit more time to get agro on the rest of the pull.   
---
Have any other questions or concerns? Happy to help - ask away.
---
same. was the only one to need, actually
---
I have been pally tanking since deadmines at 17 and I just did Maraudon last night at 48. Having your group understand that consecration needs to tick for a second helps, because when enemies hit you with ret aura (always use ret aura) you passively generate threat. I use salv on high level dps and AoE dps to just help the run move smoothly. People complain about Mana, USE BLESSING OF WISDOM AND GET YOURSELF SPIRIT. Simple as that, after a while you can use seal of insight to help with Mana I'm combat cause tbh, seal of righteousness is not your aggro generator, it's consecrate and ret aura and holy shield. I use judgement of righteous as a taunt when threat is switched off me. 
---
They honestly are the best dungeon tanks for AoE combat, and that helps dungeons run faster. I've never encountered a problem yet, and if that dps rogue takes threat, they have feint and evasion, tell them to use their skills. Worst case scenario you blessing of protection them, but honestly save that for your casters/healers since they can still cast inside of it.
---
I'm already tanking on my warrior, otherwise I probably would go Druid. I might give hunter a try, sounds interesting. Is it worth it to go mining/engineering, or should I go Skinning/Engineering and just buy my engineering mats?
---
You dont.
---
It’s only a 30 second cool down when you equip it, but thanks for proving your own point anyways i guess
---
So if I'm healing in a dungeon and I get aggro, should I move? Go towards the tank? Stay still? 
---
Should I be doing something aside from "fade" to avoid or lose aggro when that happens? I'm playing a priest btw, just to be clear. 
---
I never know the protocol and feel like I'm usually wrong. If the tank is nearby then I stay where I am but if they're pretty far I'll try to get to them. 
---
Also I shouldn't be super far back, should I? I tried staying back with the casters, but then the tank is out of range and I'm panic healing as soon as I run up to them lol. 
---
I'm sorry for the noob questions. I've never really healed before.
---
Get a grip ya nerds
---
I sort of understand all that. What I tried was to turn off the heal prediction function hoping that the system won't call upon the library or perform that action - yet no luck. Hmm is there a possible work around that may be used? Perhaps inserting a short code somewhere?
---
That's often not an option when there's other packs around.
---
kinda the opposite happened to me.. the other day i was playing my rogue on retail and doing the war campaign stuff, for some reason there were like 20 max level alliance just hanging out in redridge in warmode, there was one horde demon hunter doing the same quest i was. we got jumped by 2 pallies, and shortly after a mage and warlock joined in. i vanished and ran off to turn warmode off cause i just wanted to do the quest. the DH calls me out in general chat for not helping him and "leaving him to die" and im just like "dude it was 4 on 2 and there are like 15 more over here by the inn, it wasn't gonna happen."
---
people love their rage.
---
(if you're not up to date with retail, warmode is your pvp toggle option, there are no pvp servers anymore, and you can only turn it on in org/sw and off in a rested area.)
---
I didn’t realize that it would work differently between p-servers and classic. I guess I’ll have to do more research/testing. Thank you
---
Don't post if you have no clue, save precious internet space, ty.
---
In Vanilla, DPS needs to manage their threat level.  That's why there are abilities to do so, such as  the Rogue ability Feint. 
---
Just heal the tank, let the DPS die, and then tell them "learn how to play Vanilla and manage your threat level".
---
Maybe just focus on level up professions and farming while she is low? (and boost her? )
---
you didn't know? he is trying to graveyard hop.  You screwed him out of 5 minutes of running.  Now he has to find another monster to kill him.
---
&gt;  Leveling is painful with a holy priest.
---
On PvE servers they are basically the same. On PvP, shadow all the way.
---
I've been pretty self sufficient so far which is nice. Got the green whelp armour pattern so I have been making some money off of that. I like the idea of making for myself.
---
taunt 10 second cooldown. I'm talking if the dps are attacking different targets/ using aoe spells. They're generally going to pull aggro.
---
I bought a few things that were lower buyouts than vendor price.
---
What are some must have and great addons to have while playing the game at all stages and leveling as a warlock?
---
Why would you choose dirty deeds as a dagger rogue? You're not opening CS unless you have teammates near that can continue the CC ie the enemy is dead anyways.
---
In what part of the rules does it say that non-rpers cannot make characters on a rp server
---
:thonking emoji:
---
Are you 100% sure about that? Maybe it’s only if someone does damage to it then hehe.
---
I do go to the AH with my main to buy stuff from time to time.  
---
But your bags fill constantly and running around takes a lot of time.  It's nice to just dump stuff off.  Otherwise you'll end up destroying or vendoring things that are could get you much more profit.  It's nice to leave stuff in your bank alt's inventory or mail.
---
meanwhile rogues in the corner picking lockboxes/pickpocketing mobs
---
Split up then ask that same question.
---
ah there it is. makes more sense in context
---
Ok, not really in a guild right now but I might try to be and see what is better for the guild.
---
None of the BiS lists get close to 9% hit which is doable. Which is why I am asking...
---
He's the Druid in the screenshot...
---
More slow than hard I would say since I had to fight her in bear form.
---
Fishing or stripping?
---
Imagine paying that much money to dumb the game down. I guess it's cheaper than retail but still...
---
People like this really be walking amongst us in life
---
Ah I see what you mean
---
Hey there!
---
I’m Horde on Grobbulus (RP-PvP), and as long as you’re chill/willing to contribute to a positive atmosphere, certainly!
---
A bit about our setup:
---
We have standards we all uphold as a team - we offer what we can afford to lose to guild members first, we help each other when we can (quests/dungeons/PvP), and respect each others’ time by only asking for help when we need it. 
---
Real world politics aren’t a part of our guild atmosphere, and we try to keep it that way.
---
We aren’t the biggest RP guild, but we enjoy occasional RP events and have a few killer ideas for the holiday seasons. 
---
We plan to start raiding with a few allied guilds soon (we have 4-5 60s with 6 of us in our mid 50s) and I’ll be honest - I’m not sure how, if it all, that will affect our dynamic. 
---
There will be less time for helping leveling individuals, I don’t know what loot system will be in place (DKP, Loot Council, etc), we’ll be grinding  necessary resources as well, and so I can’t make future promises of time allocation in that regard. Most of us will still help counter-gank, but rotate in as our schedules allow.
---
We’re all chill/relaxed/reasonable non-dramatic individuals on varied work schedules. I think most of not all of us are eastern time zone, so raiding will likely be based around that schedule.
---
We’re small; but apes together, strong.
---
One guildy gave me an epic BoE to use at a 60% discount, I gave our head enchanter all my gold at the time (75g) towards Crusader/lifesteal when I was the only player online and he was lucky enough to find a great deal. Another guildy put up 10g to help a 40 get their mount, and all we ask of each other in return is to pay it forward and help each other with what we can, when we can.
---
If you think we’re a good fit for you and you’re a good fit for us, feel free to send a PM!
---
When does warrior get bad? I'm levelling an alt and 1-15 has been fun as hell. Considering I get WW in my 30s, is it 20-30 that's bad or something?
---
Do my mount speed increases affect gryphon rides? I just took off about 10 yards behind someone on the same flight and ended my flight about 10 yards in front of him. Any thoughts?
---
To be honest, BoSalv = Retail-mode. Normally you'd have to let a tank build aggro for a few seconds, but the Blessing just means they can dps as soon as the pack is standing in Consecration.
---
Trinket won’t be in game until P3 which is a ways away.... (marginal regret in my choice of warrior), intimidation and scatter shot also serve as distance reset tools. If you are PvP spec, you have both.
---
Honestly, if that happened to me I'd just leave. There are so many groups running stuff it isn't worth dealing with those people.
---
Trolling is being a flat-out asshole. But, I digress.
---
&gt; I'm a priest so I went tailor/enchant. 
---
Aye, been in those exact shoes myself. Those two professions really do eat up your savings as you are missing out on cloth-sales *and* the sales of greens. 
---
&gt; I just need so so many mats but I've gotten lucky more than a couple times with people listing items wayyyyy below value. Plus I have collected alot I started making 10 slot bags and selling them on AH. Got a stack of leather for next to nothing so I'm making nice big profit off of it
---
Aye, keeping an eye on the AH prices combined with professions can usually be profitable with some practice, seems to me you are going to do just fine. Keep up the good work :)
---
True. Maybe "stupid good" was an overstatement. Definitely better for threat gen in bear form.
---
I choose to play with sub optimal strategies and get picked up all the time! 2h fury warrior at 35 tanking? Alright bud let's see what you got.
---
I played with 3 shaman off heals last dungeon and a fire mage in SM library. It was a goat rope and we loved it. There is a place for all playstyles and it does not require you to play "correctly" in a group. I personally just laugh at the groups that will only take another cloth DPS/off heals druid in general before the start the dungeon. Bitch we went all DPS and got 3 runs in before your party was full. I get that some people want the elite experience and only want the best and that's fine, but generally most of us are just bombing around having fun.
---
Azeroth Autopilot is great for efficient leveling.  It only goes until level 40 right now though.
---
Because if you are willing to tank you get into just about any group instantly. If you are DPS fury in PVE you top the charts, and if you are Arms you own the battleground field. 
---
Worst levelers in the game but at 60 they are one of if not the most op class in classic.
---
That is exactly when you are trying to die.  You want to die to save a lot of time running back, by paying like 40copper for the repair bill.
---
Can someone tell me what healing add on that is please? Would love to get it!
---
Yeah so far peeps on Mankrik are pretty chill, everyone said we would be the troll server.
---
Facts.  
---
I played alliance as my first character ever (a human rogue) but rerolled horde for a shaman, and a pally in TBC.  
---
I went alliance in classic to relive the old days.
---
Bandages???? WHAT A SCUMBAG OMG!!!!!!
---
You'd be fine up to Angerforge i think. Everything past him is 55-60. Def 58+ to do Emp runs
---
lock or Spriest
---
Why are pots not? They are weak and have limited cooldowns
---
Beanflicks.
---
Orc women have equal rights because they can throw equal lefts.
---
I sat in Shadowmeld for five or ten minutes on my hunter while I watched a Troll Hunter clear all the tigers and panthers near Bag'Thera. I waited until they had her down to 5-10% and ganked / stole the kill. 
---
I'm sure that I'm KoS to that person now and I couldn't be happier about it. :D
---
Rage gen scales of weapon speed. Why are you two even arguing? Yeah it’s essentially same thing, and yes people use speed more often because they are used to it. What’s wrong with that?
---
Dude.. You know you can use distract without being stealthed right? All you need to be is not be in combat.. But then I guess the guards would kill you? I'm just making sure you know cause you said in stealth we have this ability.
---
Addons are pretty much qol type things you can add to your game. I use bagnon(makes all your bags 1 big bag) , vendor price ( shows hm something vendors when not at a vendor), details! ( for damage done  in your group), questie ( shows you where to go for your quest), auctionator ( auction house type addon, can tell you how much stuff auctions just by hovering over it). I hav more but i would suggest those to new people
---
It can be nice to be able to go fear immune for 50 consecutive seconds.
---
I generally ride in the ship's cabin and if I see any priests start things, I remove them from the boat.
---
Horde created what situation?
---
If you're doing the first half, to get the key, I did it at 52 as a tank. We had a 58 hunter who was giving me fits on keeping aggro, but other than that the rest of the group was 52/53 and we had no problems. And we got ultra lost and ended up clearing way more than we needed to, we did Lord Incendius and then the entire hallway up to Bael'gar. 
---
The second, I've done up to the Lyceum as a 54 tank but it was getting difficult. A lot of resists.
---
Are you planning on spec'ing in mail? Or sticking with leather? Then choose dragonscale or tribal depending on your armor goals, that should be your answer.
---
People are just so goddamn weird sometimes lmao
---
BRB rerolling rogue
---
You're both retarded

30 Druid, Like 10g.

You're clueless. There might be different reasons to resist a stun that people can take for 'base resist'. It might be lack of hit, a talent. Not only orcs resist stuns.
---
Not if he accidentally pulls and I see him running from a group. I know what graveyard hopping is, saves me lots of time.
---
Holy priest lvl 58 I have almost 400g
---
Even tho a party can't unlock a locked chest without a rogue or a key, it's also fair to conclude that the 1 individual with the ability to open the chest would not be able to if it wasn't for the party's collective effort to clear to it(ie chest in dungeons).
---
This is the main reason why I feel like the party should always roll for the chest. But to be honest, It's not a big deal to me either way.
---
HerOMEGALULd
---
Thanks for the detailed response. Will try this out tonight
---
Wow, thanks! I PM’d you :)
---
Unless it's a gsync/freesync monitor, which most 144hz monitors these days are one or the other.
---
And its amazing that people who claimed to love classic because Blizzard wasn't the fun police and you actually could play the way you wanted are the one blaming people doing their thing.
---
15 seconds after this was taken, Roguetard lived up to his name was was killed by three Horde. At least we have this picture to remember him by.
---
Last night I got into a PUG gnomer group. Before going through the instance portal we wipe a horde group that just got off their portal (they were all present, didn't kill them one by one or anything). We snag techbots brain and are heading to the instance when we see the the horde group has respawned. Without a word our tank rushes in. In an attempt to escape their shaman heads to they teleporter but doesn't make it. Tank or Hunter (I forget) yells out "THEY GOT NO HEALS!" and we wipe them again. Lol felt a little dickish, but I told the group it was a legit wPVP, nobody ganked anybody and it was 5v5. Felt good
---
Main 55 Warrior, Alt's 33 Warlock, 25 mage. Leveling a warrior kinda did a blow to my ego so leveling a Warlock helped beef it up again and then playing a mage made me realize the reason why mages are the way they are.
---
I got lucky and an AotDW dropped in live strat during a guild run but unfortunately flurry axes are 200g+ on my server right now. I'm torn between it or getting my devilsaur gear
---
No.
---
Yeah mine is neither but runs at 144hz set in Windows so I'll bump it up in game : )
---
I switched to and basically bought 300 tailoring and mats to get truefaith vestments. Also gave my guildie 100g. Basically just not smart with my gold, but I’ll get there.
---
To be fair, there are two generational naming conventions that overlap. Gen x,y,z is one,  Boomer and melenial is another.
---
It is when the warlock threshold isn’t met, which iirc is 4. If there’s less than that, the raid spot is better used on a non-meme spec.
---
Are edgemaster's handguards still worth getting for a human warrior tank?
---
I didn't realize sword spec procs reset swing timer.
---
I really want to learn my class well (and from what I can tell, I do well enough) - do you have a few good resources with nuance info like this ?
---
I tried looking a few times, but finding accurate information, about this particular version, and patch, has been difficult.
---
I have a level 46 Warrior on a PvE realm and I honestly can't be bother to tank anything at this point.  I just don't run instances for the most part unless I absolutely need a quest from one.
---
I have some friends playing but they are back around the mid-30s for level so I have just been leveling a character on another server for now while I wait for them to catch up.  They know how to attack the same target, respect threat, etc.... so I'd rather wait and have nice, clean dungeon runs than go through the issues of grabbing a PUG group - especially since I am now at the point where a full set of repairs can run a few gold.
---
I had a weird experience kinda similar to that last night Horde side on Ashkandi US.  I was killing gnolls in Feralas and pulled more than I could handle.  A random priest invites me to group, heals me, opens trade and gives me a stack of food.  I put the vendor price of the food in trade and he declines and reopens trade so I just accept.  He then dropped group.  I whispered him "Thanks" and found out that he had put me on ignore.  I just sat there scratching my head lol.
---
You should always be within range of the tank.
---
If there isn't risk of being aoe'd or cleaved by other mobs in the group, bring the mob to the tank so that he can grab aggro. 
---
As a prot paladin I'm not going to move the entire group of mobs out of my consecrate just to try and pull a single mob off of you; a warrior or bear may be able to move towards you, but at the risk of losing aggro to overzealous aoe dps.
---
You should never just run off with a lone mob as a healer. 
---
That means you aren't in range to heal anyone, nobody can see you to know that there's a mob on you, all we see is your health bar dropping and now we have to search for you; and making the entire group move to you means possibly missing runners and pulling even more mobs.
---
The healer said go. The healer can see where the enemies are. Poor planning on the mage and healer. I think it’s mutual shit play.
---
Which blessing do you use on yourself?
---
You shoult start a new char. It takes like 10h to get to 15, but may take well over 70h to get from 15 to 40+
---
I don't play on a PvP server because of the exact experience I described back in vanilla. It almost made me quit the game. I'm not salty about it. I just moved. 
---
You didn't even answer the question you just pointed to something else...
---
Is there an addon that let's me save some info about other players so it will pop somehow when we are at the same group or etc?
---
I go instances alot as I'm tanking and sometimes I don't like how some people act in my party (for example I had a rogue that was constantly opening, dpsing and trying to tank not the mob tagged as skull). I would like to save some notes about that player like 'ninja looted some item in some dungeon' but I don't want to ignore them completely.
---
If the warlock is lifetapping in a way that he needs more than a renew, or hell any healing at all until the fight ends, yeah, they're doing something wrong.
---
those two gnomes look very dapper with their red hats
---
I don't think the ignore was about wasting the time but more about the terrible attitude regarding the group members.
---
&gt;You sound like a whiny baby.
---
The is not whining though.. He is replying to a player that is admitting the other members are assholes.
---
He is ignoring in order to avoid going through the same situation again, which is fair, more than fair. In order to prevent the same from happening.
---
Actually whining about ignores seems more like something a whiny baby would do far more than just ignoring a player without adding any more drama.
---
In my very first dungeon on classic, playing as Tank (Druid) for the first time in my life in RFC, clean run so far, and we got up to that ramp that goes around a lava lake and ends in a small side room with a quest. I didn't see the small side room at all.
---
Got up to the ramp, looked around, looked down, a pretty steep fall that ended on a dead end corridor with like 20 mobs. Monkey brain took over, Moonfired the very last mob down there hoping to pull it around to us. "What the hell dude". Cue mob running down the corridor and into other mobs that also joined the aggro, turning into a 20-man conga line of death running through lava to get us. Fought bravely, but ofc everyone just ate shit and died. Truly expected people to curse and kick me, but after I apologized, they just said "yo, there was a room to the left there, but don't worry, we were doing fine", and we just carried on to complete the dungeon. One of the funniest experiences I've had with Classic so far, and I don't think I've ever had a bad dungeon group yet.
---
Like warm butter on hit toast. Smooth.
---
That's because those guys are still playing Genji on Overwatch.
---
I’m not sure if this is legit but I feel like fire generates more threat
---
LOL @ basing decisions on breakups.  Enjoy it while together, roll a new toon if you breakup.
---
They had us on the first half, not gonna lie...
---
Must be from retail
---
Yeah man the pants on the AH are like 270 on Herod, I’m guessing with the general horde of people going for MC they’re going to be high if not increasing. Unless there are a lot of people trying to get in on the fun which will increase the supply.
---
Bye
---
It exists in a higher superstate where it is in the loot table but the table randomizer notices that you're in the party when you port in, and will subsequently drop it from the loot table.
---
TLDR: This game just hates you
---
How is that a victory exactly? And over what? The fact that blizz aren't banning people fast enough? Imagine what kind of precedent that would set if you ever won that court battle (by some dumbfuck miracle). Companies would need to be incredibly ban-happy to over the slightest offense because otherwise some triggered idiot would sue them for not "enforcing their rules" in a timely manner.
---
You’re wrong. Warlocks can’t have 100% health up otherwise they do not get regen from Siphon Life, Demon Armor, Drain Life and Deathcoil. The comparison to Warrior is stupid because Warriors get no benefit from not being fill health. Whereas not being full health as Warlock is optimal because it is more resource efficient.
---
Clearly forgot to use Arcane Intellect.
---
Palatank here. There are dozens if us!
---
Tbh I rushed to 60, and I havent had to deal with all this spellcleave bs as much as yall have to now. I certainly did a few, but not to the extent I see them posted now or just a week after launch.
---
&gt; It's Classic. The game is literally telling everyone they all suck and can't do it solo. No one is excluded from that, which is what makes soloing things that much more precious.
---
But they often have a leveling guide to do super min maxing effiency leveling!
---
And this guide, clearly states that if no, you do not need heals randomly, so tell every healer/buffer to fuck off and ignore them.
---
Pretty sure it even has 'run from razormanes, and most surely die' in it too.
---
The biggest thing that helped me was to make sure you’re kiting wide. Stay near the wall because if you stay near the inner part of the water ring she’ll cut you off.
---
Make sure when you kite around the big rock that you don’t let her cut on the inside to get to you.
---
Send your pet in every 30 seconds (dash) and immediately back out again to get her to use her knock back channel. I auto aimed auto or sometimes mend pet if he needs it.
---
UC elevators are no joke. I'm always serious business and high alert in those things. I'm happy to have not fallen victim yet this time around!
---
Lol I thought this was me for a second. I go by grim usually but my mage is named grimwrath and I recently made a mistake similar but not as bad as this at the same place. Yeah we love our bugs.
---
See, stuff like this wants to to start leveling a priest or a rogue just to do stupid shit like this...
---
How hard is it to wait for a shield before pulling?
---
What addon is that for the extended stats?
---
Spellcleave?
---
Weapon damage and weapon speed are hard linked, together with item level.
---
The two are fully interchangable. There was no need to nitpick.
---
Lvl 54, 110g. Have spent maybe 50g on items while leveling and my biggest sell has been avoidance boots for 40g. Am skinner, so I make okay money while questing and sell thick/rugged. Don't really need anything but would like a warden staff.
---
Druids are somewhat unpopular in general because they suffer from Jack of all trades, master of none syndrome.
---
If anything, be a bear, they are great 5-man tanks since they actually generate AoE threat and have a ton of HP.
---
And how long with two item drops per boss and 8 mages in the raid will it take you into phase 3 to get a full tier 2 set???? Get the damned robes!
---
So true. I did this exact same thing at 24 and went from 11G to 7G.
---
Hahahaha, fucking awesome.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/nightfalls-wow-classic-horde-leveling-guide/

This will have you plowing through levels
---
people on the sub are seriously delusional when in comes to pvp. "player vs player" not "fair duel with rules between two evenly matched players"
---
To add my own thoughts in a more visible place.... Time really should be on the X-axis here. If you look at the graph, flipping the two axes would still have the result of showing total distance traveled in a certain amount of time (which is the first argument for why since the derivative of the graph would then be velocity if we treat time as the all powerful independent variable that it is) while still allowing for easy and intuitive comparisons between each category based on where the lines intercept each other. In my opinion the graph is much more intuitive this way

---
I’m a warrior tank and my buddy is a Druid. Never had problems getting groups. Try and find a tank you trust and the lack of Rez shouldn’t be an issue.
---
These are some kind words and they are appreciated :)
---
It is possible that they assume you're Feral for leveling and heals will be soft? 
---
If they assume they'll be wiping regularly in SM, you really don't want to be in that group dude.
---
If you feel it is that much of an issue, lead your own groups or buddy up with another hybrid class who can res.
---
Had a rogue try to do that to me yesterday so I death coiled, dotted, then he tried to run away and I just wanded him to death.  xD
---
No, I am Dad!
---
If they're both going really, REALLY slow, then no, you won't really see the difference until they travel for a while.
---
Seems like a sweet soloing sword!
---
\*loud banging on the door\* CITY GUARD OPEN UP!!!!!!
---
Jokes aside yeah... it takes too long to get so high in Classic.
---
You could play together with her with an alt since I think you can get a character up to her level relatively fast depending on class, and switch back to your main if you want when she's caught up to it.
---
Ran into the same thing just yesterday on a quick check before work, had 3 recipes (Bag, Gloves, enchant) pop up on her all within clicks of each other. There was another person sitting there but I guess he wasn't there hitting his macro keys.
---
Yeah I'm rolling a mage alt and at lvl 25 I still find single target way better to level with than doing any AOE grinding. If I happen to come across a spot that I think I can pull a bunch and kill them all I'll do it but that's like once or twice a level at most usually.
---
Also most of the mages I see AOE grinding die like at least half of the pulls they make, no way are they even being remotely efficient. 
---
Also mages rolling up on spots and assuming they get dibs for AOE grinding lol, like 12 people trying to kill raptors in Arathi and this mage is throwing a hissy fit because they can't AOE grind.
---
WTF.  I'm glad I haven't run into any of these fuckos. The other day my wife and I were questing in Arathi.  I saw a priest getting absolutely destroyed by ogres. I checked their health and they were almost dead.  I charged in and dropped those ogre fucks.  As I was running away the priest /w "Thank You!".  Felt good man.
---
This is never not funny
---
Yes it takes apparently 22-25 minutes.
---
PvE or PvP?
---
Mage NPC's are not affected by casting pushback, and cannot be delayed or interrupted without a stun/silence.
---
PvP is a little different, though most frost mages are going to slow your attack down, which gives them a chance to cast with little interruption.
---
Thanks - did not know! :-)
---
Minor speed enchant on boots.
---
How is "oven crunchies" any better than tater tots?
---
Trust me, I understand. I know it's nitpicking, but this is downright misleading for new players, and I don't understand how/why this convention of looking at weapon speed even became a thing. It's silly.
---
Sekiro
---
In WotLK, "cleave" became synonymous with "has more than one class that does similar things."  Cleave was originally a TBC 5v5 arena comp with 3 melees and 2 healers, then in WotLK people starting adding variations: shadowcleave, wizardcleave, beastcleave, etc. and it just stuck.
---
LOL @ rerolling because of a breakup when you could just not be whipped and choose a name you won’t regret later.
---
That's fair enough, my response isn't towards people like yourself but rather the players who haven't played classic before and end up spamming dungeons.
---
xD was especially funny the hunter just sat there like they admitted defeat
---
Are there any good Warlock streamers? PvE or PvP
---
People like Nathanos?
---
Necrosis is the perfect addon for working out of the box. Weak auras is definitely better but takes more work.
---
It turns out that many adults are worse than children.
---
My ignore list is huge.
---
nice
---
Sometimes it’s easier to let the dps take aggro first because they will get slept instead of the tank. That’s how our group did it in the early 50s.
---
Stand around doing nothing and ask them to position the mob better.  If they refuse, kick the tank.
---
If you're going to let the way other people play ruin your time MMOs aren't meant for you I guess. I play rogue and I've had no trouble finding groups or people to quest and play with, even toward higher levels I've found people are more likely to help me than to not. I hope you can find a fun community within the game that helps you enjoy it more and to play the way you want to play. Blizzard will not be stopping people from farming or grouping the way they want to, they will only remove layers at one point and that will make fa zones even more contested. I wish you luck and hope you'll join us in Azeroth again soon my warrior friend, you will be missed.
---
You can tag at level 1 and your 60 Buddy kills it and you get full exp? Even on the new engine? Gotta try it then. Guess i was wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah, I downloaded Character Notes last night and it's super legit.
---
yea mirahs is the best option besides a high level green with good stats, dalrends is also solid but you gotta win that and song is a quest reward
---
Can't wait to see this done to a raid crossing by.
---
You could add them to your friends list as odd as that sounds, but there is an add note feature for the friends list so you could do it that way. And no add on needed
---
Can you enlighten me What is bis in current patch? Thanks
---
Alright...my druid is 50+ and I'm in the slow grind to 60.  I plan to have a hybrid tank/heal spec for endgame, so I want to level a pure dps alt class.  
---
I'm a filthy casual and won't be running two raids a week, so probably nothing in the endgame beyond gold/profession grinding and maybe some endgame dungeons.
---
The options I'm considering are hunter, mage, warlock...all seem to be easy to level, which of them is best for leveling and endgame mat/profession grinding?
---
Fire mage drrrrp
---
I'm becoming superstitious
---
&gt; you getting bullied in school?
---
sounds like dude is just projecting. people in this sub are strange
---
Nothing like spending 30m assembling a group, having one little mistake lead to a wipe in the first few minutes, and your healer just bailing without saying a word.
---
If someone else does the majority of the damage on the mob, you get reduced xp.
---
Idk I just stand about 20 yards away. Not too far and I don't get in combat but still get credit.
---
You don't need to stress about healing a warlock using Life Tap until they are 20% health. Heal them if you have the mana, but if you don't, just make sure the tank stays alive. Warlocks have the ability to heal themselves. Any good one will use those abilities and need very little from you.
---
Well, as a decent pala tank you'd put salvation on mages if they get threat too much.
---
full resto with 1 talent point at level 10 xD sounds goofy
---
Starting you point of they can't procreate, why should they? They are an abomination to life, stated throughout almost every race and even the tits and dragon aspects. Procration of such a race seems to defy the will of everything. Things are meant o die and stay dead on Azeroth.
---
Being said abomination, killing them is only natural which is why I understand almost every race, esp the humans killing them at every turn.
---
I never said the undead are evil and I am sure there are good ones among them, All I said is throughout thier history they clearly want to kill all life on azeroth so why are they not purged, why does the horde protect them? 
---
Maybe look deeper than just throwing insults and trying to sound superior with a lack of facts.
---
I'm a rogue and I hit 40 last night with 102g. Here's what I did to make sure I had enough for my mount.
---
 * Didn't level my professions
---
 * Didn't buy every ability at the class trainer
---
 * Used poisons in PvP and dungeons only
---
 * Pickpocketed every humanoid enemy before I opened on them
---
 * Took skinning to also make beast enemies worth more gold
---
 * Quested a ton
---
The last 3 are really the crux of my gold generation while leveling. The combo of pickpocket + skinning means pretty much every mob you kill is generating additional money for you. It's hard to skin/pickpocket in dungeons, so questing is the best way to capitalize on it. Quest rewards are also a solid source of income in their own right. That said, if you're desperate for money you can stealth through a dungeon solo and pickpocket everything (SM is good for this).
---
All that said, gold generation is slow until you can farm a resource that's valuable at the AH. Until then you should try to save money if you're hoping to buy your mount. Leveling crafting professions costs a ton of money, and poisons start getting expensive too. Depending on your spec there are a bunch of abilities you just don't need, and rank-ups in utility skills are often useless (they increase damage instead of utility). Read the fine print on abilities you're buying and consider how useful they actually are.
---
Do wc see how she levels.
---
Im not sure but I think renew is a huge waste if mana. I usually just put it on the tank after he pulled so I have a buffer to caste heal. I would never put renew on the dps because for less mana I can just caste heal for more hp anyways.
---
Glad you demonstrated my point.
---
Nah
---
After level 10, and especially after level 20, Druids level incredibly fast. There is zero downtime, and you can take down multiple mobs at or near your level with ease. Plus, you can tank, heal, or DPS in dungeons from 10-60.
---
New characters should always be new characters. I shouldn't start up a level 1 to be some richie rich bitch who is already geared while everyone else is wearing torn rags.
---
Repeat stolen joke for years ago.
---
I think we've found a keyboard turner /s
---
In all seriousness though, you can prevent this by using your mouse.
---
&gt; but that's kind of impossible while playing a game that's only enjoyable while grouping. 
---
This is a bit of a sweeping generalization. I quest by myself whenever my wife isn't available and I have a blast playing wow on my own.
---
I wanna tell you to forget tanking and find a better use for those points in Righteous Fury and Shield spec, but honestly there's not a lot of better options. Build seems good for what you want out of it.
---
the XL cables sre available from the Golem boss in BRD and are BoE so they can be sold on AH
---
Can’t you tell he’s RPing as a lawyer?!?!?
---
They may have killed you in the end, but you already won.
---
i r8 8/8
---
If you mean random green weapons and armour to use as disenchant fodder, you’d still roll greed, same with miners who roll on nodes in dungeons. I may need them for my profession; as much as someone who sells the bars for others, so my reasoning is that we both stand to gain something outside of improving damage or stats, we roll on the same playing field.
---
I remember back in the day, if someone was running with guildies and farming specific loot, you’d roll on the disenchant item for gear everyone had, once the enchanter had disenchanted it? That was usually late game when people were farming for pre raid enchants.
---
The only reason I could think of to be pissed off by that is if you’re doing an IronMan challenge.
---
But considering that it’s really unlikely I don’t understand those people
---
Was hoping to see everyone charge forward and all get knocked back at once.
---
No.  The low level enchants are worthless.  You'll be giving them away in order to skill up or simply enchanting the same item over and over for a loss.   Enchanting makes you money via DISENCHANTING or via rare end game enchants pretty much exclusively.  And for disenchanting, you only need a character at level 5, so many people get this on their bank alts.
---
&gt; I havent had to deal with all this spellcleave bs as much as yall have to now 
---
There is 1000% more complaining about spellcleave groups on Reddit than there are actual spell cleave groups, it is easily avoidable...
---
Because it is botting?
---
A while back I saw a 44 warrior running and he said he still needed 60g to get his mount... I gave him 10 gold, cause that shit is tragic.
---
Its stated in the lore that many wear down over time. They are only decayed bodies. Ergo why Sylvanas had to get valkyries to make fresher more sturdy corpses. In the end most undead go insane or just rot out.
---
Awesome. Ty! 
---
I have been leveling cooking alongside with fishing so ill be right on this once Im the level för Tanaris. Im 38 right now.
---
I ran SM Cath with 3 rogues and a pally faster than I’ve ever ran it with 3 mages last night.
---
You don't know what's gonna happen regarding queues in phase 2 when they remove layering. Big streamer servers might just be unplayable.
---
We've all aged 15 years from those nights when we could level 3-4 hours per night.
---
My vote for snutz as well. Very chill and will answer questions. Very high skill as well, has won many tournaments for arena.
---
go into the camera settings
---
This is shameful and saddens me greatly.
---
Hallow's End was in vanilla but Horseman was TBC.
---
Dungeons are boring for you as a Warlock? What? Is it not the dungeons themselves? Warlock is probably the most involved class there is.
---
Yaaaaaaahhoooo hooo hoooweeeeeeeeeeeeeddr *splat*
---
Perfect build for raid healing and off-tanking/farming on the side.  
---
Got the BoK in case your raid needs that
---
10/10
---
Lol nice one
---
There is no imo.
---
DW is objectively better.
---
The problem is finding a guild that will let you run it. 
---
It's not the worst it's just a spot that can be filled by much better classes.
---
Still baffles me how people have trouble leveling a warrior.
---
Does a handful of deaths really discourage you this badly?
---
I remember the discussions about events still being active, there will be some kind of Halloween event apparently but I'm not sure which one.
---
Make a second toon and only play with her on it, you’ll love it. My gf and I leveled to 60 together and she has loved it. Have had an awesome time thus far.
---
For the most part it depends on your group comp. Angerforge might be a little tough but if you pull him back a good bit and have a mage or Hunter to slow down the medic spawns you should be able to get him without too much hassle. You can probably do the grim guzzler bosses as well if you can get him. 
---
Past that, it's going to be really rough unless you have dps who out level or gear the place. Did an emperor run last night as a 54 tank with a 54 healer and warlock, but we had a 60 rogue and Hunter to balance us out. It was still tough.
---
Yes and no, some bosses have AoE auras that cause spell knockback (think the mini boss in scholo) and a lot of raid bosses/raid trash also have aoes that can cause spell knock back
---
It's all relative to what you're doing. Sometimes mobs do 360 cleaves. Sometimes they randomly attack the 2nd person on their threat table. Going into it with a 100% mindset of "DPS taking damage is their own fault and they can just die" is the mindset of a shitty healer. Learn the mechanics of fights. If the DPS is dying because they're being idiots, sure, let them die.
---
My rogue friend farms SM Graveyard.  I farmed elemental fires in Arathi.  Kept the elemental fires and gave the shards to warriors trying to get their axes.  The rock ones are also good, they have great trash drops that add up.
---
Haha it does, I was more referring to a bit higher level.  Just saying I committed to it at 10, not that 1 point means much .
---
It still works. Just need to use the proper consumable
---
Thank you for that valuable feedback.
---
Spellcleave: Oh no. We are too late. These Spellceaves have all been infected! They may look fine now, but it's only a matter of time before they turn into the Spellcleave.  
---
Spellcleave: WHAT?!  
---
Spellcleave: This entire Spellcleave must be purged!  
---
Spellcleave: How can you even consider Spellcleave?! There must be some other Spellcleave!  
---
Spellcleave: Dammit Spellcleave! As your future Spellcleave I order you to purge this Spellcleave!  
---
Spellcleave: You are not my Spellcleave yet Spellcleave nor would I obey that Spellcleave even if you were Spellcleave!  
---
Spellcleave: Then I must consider this an act of Spellcleave.  
---
Spellcleave: Spellcleave?! Have you lost your mind Spellcleave?

Spellcleave: Have I, Lord Spellcleave? By my right of succession and the sovereignty of my Spellcleave I hereby relieve you of your Spellcleave and suspend your Spellcleaves from service.  
---
Spellcleave: Spellcleave you can't just...  
---
Spellcleave: It's done! Those of you with the will to save this Spellcleave follow me. The rest of you... get out of my sight!  
---
Spellcleave: You just crossed a terrible threshold Spellcleave.  
---
Spellcleave: Spellcleave?  
---
Spellcleave: I'm sorry Spellcleave. I can't watch you do Spellcleave.
---
Alright Im just gunna tell him to sell it anyway. Some guildmate trying to get more than full price for a bis item for me
---
# AGE IS JUST A NUMBER
---
You get barely any reputation if the quests are gray though
---
That’s your opinion, and it’s a wrong one.
---
When you’ve leveled *once*, there’s not else you’re going to see that’s different.  BoA’s allow you to focus less on keeping your gear up to date and more on just playing the game.

I was thinking /r/Libertarian

&gt;you can get 100g pretty quickly.
---
*cries in poverty*
---
I hate my server economy.
---
Wrong in many areas.  The mat sell price seems to be incorrect.  Often times you are better just selling the bolts of cloth rather than making tailoring items for instance.  Just because the base mats sell does not mean you should keep processing them to their most final product possible.  Really need to rethink your method before doing more work on this.  Should base vendor price of mats based on the most expensive form of an item in that crafting chain.

I’m a 58 warrior I recommend making a macro to swap to sword and shield to give yourself mitigation against multiple mobs during questing. You got this. It’s not so bad. Find friends to quest with.
---
You probably had a lower rank of bite or claw on your previous pet.
---
From quests alone? Not even remotely close. You can't even be exalted from quests alone at 60.
---
You need to do Runecloth turn ins which I believe you need to be level 50 to do.
---
30s cast. Average fish caught halfway through. 15s per fish. 8 fish per level. 60 levels to go. 
---
Roughly two hours to go! Not bad
---
If I ask for water, I always tip. If you ask for water, please tip your bartender.
---
Also spending money on drinks vs tipping. One will take money out of the economy, the other will recycle it. The more money in the economy, the higher prices people pay in AH. It’s a win win for everyone, to tip for water from mages.
---
Why u casting mana burn LOL
---
Yea I’m only BM for leveling I’m going MM in to survival at 60
---
What about d07RiV's comment? Thoughts?
---
No way
---
I've never been in a position where I was looking for a tank or healer and turned someone down because of their class. I trust anyone who's willing to put themselves into the role.
---
I don't pvp much and I'm not sure what to do in that situation. Throw down a ice trap? Conc shot and make sure you dont get close?
---
Seeing fog like that would require venturing outside where there are no tendies or hunny mussy..
---
You know legal is more broad than just literal laws right? 
---
In football, “that wasn’t a legal hit.”
---
In baseball, “that wasn’t a legal pickoff move”
---
But yeah keep being a moron.
---
I'm a total newb to WoW and still don't quite understand all of the mechanics and etiquette, especially in dungeons. Like when to pull, if to pull, when to stop attacking to not get aggro.
---
I'm always so anxious because I don't want to cause a wipe but so far I've only had really good parties though...
---
It feels like all escorts take a ridiculously long time, I wish they'd update the timers.  I waited for a good 15-20 minutes for NPC of the Darkshore &lt;&gt; Ashenvale one
---
It's the dungeons
---
By questing alone, no it is not.
---
It is possible to be exalted at 40, but it will required purchasing a bunch of Runecloth from the AH.
---
I helped out a mage fighting a warrior, literally just fireblasted once to finish off the warrior. Mage replies "Respect the 1v1" and goes on to explain how the fight was fair until I came in and how it's common knowledge to respect 1v1 battles and "now i know"...
---
Is this really a thing? I expected i would get bitched out if i just ran past and did nothing while he died..
---
I'm having a hard time getting this to work.  How would I get SYC set up?  Tried /syc and got nothing.  AddOn is "enabled" but I don't see an icon anywhere for it.  Is there a specific version I should be looking at?  I grabbed the one from your link and still nothing.
---
PSA: you can dispel the scarlet disguise if a member of the opposing faction is camping the spawn.
---
I went Mage to play something different, and already regret it. I miss being useful and high value. Tempted to reroll as my trusty Druid and go back to that healy lifestyle.
---
Yeah yeah I'm rank 1 on all classes too! It's good to know that the main bulk of your diet consists of tram dwelling rats, nice! PH. D. candidate? Who calls himself Satan? FoH mate you're just a narcissistic peice of shit.
---
It's been a pleasure.

---
This is the stuff I love about Classic. Last night, a rogue grabbed a mob I was about to hit with a spell. He apologized, and I said, "No worries! It happens". I get a trade request and he gives me a nice wand upgrade that he looted on the next mob. It's great to see rando internet people being nice to each other!
---
Yeah that’s funny. If they’re boring to a lock then it sounds like vanilla dungeons just aren’t his thing.
---
If other people playing efficient bothers you that much you shouldn’t play mmos bc that’s just what people do and have done in the past
---

Fingers crossed.  Never did get that dam mount in retail

Shaman is fun but it's not as good alot of RNG.
---
?? I dont think you get what im saying. I was talking about boost in retail.
---
Except the feral (druid) ones, my experience has been that the males are almost always hostile. Must be mating season or something... Idk, I'm just a holy man, you would have to ask a hunter or maybe you can find a mage that has read a book about it.
---
Content phase
---
Are you using reshade or sweetfx?
---
I get so happy reading stories like this!
---
I just don’t even get the whole begging mages for water thing. Why the hell would I track down a mage for water when I can just go buy my own? Like yeah it costs money but I would never want to rely on others like that.
---
I hate the whole bloody zone but this subs full of masochists that like getting pounded for days on end in stv and ungoro
---
Clips that end too soon.
---
If you show up on time regularly and play well, there will always be a spot.
---
Very informative. So can I take this as if I don't have enough weapon skill, let's say more than 2 levels short (10 weapon skill) short of an enemies defense, that this will impact my hit%?
---
Therefore if I become effectively a level 61, I will have the same hit chance vs a lvl 63 no matter how much more weapon skill i tack on? 
---
I only need 6% to softcap my yellows? Is that how I should interpret your second sentence?
---
Sunder is going to be most of your globals for single target threat, it is second only to Revenge. A leveling or fresh 60 tank is very far from having the gear to make Bloodthirst outscale two sunders, but it's better damage to start using it once you have threat established. You should never be using HS unless you have somehow extra rage on top of that.
---
Must be weird to see the hearthstone cards ingame ^^
---
So basically if I have taught my cat Growl and Claw (Cower came automatically) I can teach it 2 more active abilities, right?
---
As a warrior tank, I couldn’t careless about you having a Rez as long as you heal well. I’ll do my job and keep agro on me. If you keep me alive we don’t need a Rez. And as far as SM goes, that’s the shortest freakin walk in the game from the spirit healer. If someone dies, it hardly matters.  
---
Just keep looking and put together your own group if you need to.
---
I haven't had much trouble with it since they fixed it.
---
Noggenfogger has been great so far.
---
Done every available quest for the gold? That's easy money people forget about.
---
I mean, you weren’t a douche so you’ve got that going for you, which is nice.
---
Blurry photos or it didn't happen.

Are you playing on a potato with view distance set to 1, or is it just a crap area?

Works on the side of the boat too, just give the boat a hug and you are good to go.
---
Tons. There's guides out there, I'll just leave it at that.
---
Didn't even know ibb has ads. May I ask why you're not using an adblocker?
---
What did he say? It's all deleted
---
Yeah like most QoL implements it's not necessary at all. This is just the only way I can think of that wouldn't create issues elsewhere in the game.
---
Weekly reminder to **not play mages**. Overcrowded as fuck.
---
*Ironically my guild is recruiting at least one more, but we're the exception, not the rule*
---
I see from other comments you want to mostly heal but tank 5 mans.  This is what I'd recommend-  30/0/21
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVAuMxoxVGzI0u
---
This is a build focused on PVE healing, with enough points in tanking to be a viable 5-man tank assuming you have a bit of gear. 
---
Divine intellect is way better than divine STR5/5 improved SOR is pretty good for tanking, single target threat is a weakness of paladins and improved seal/judgement of righteousness goes a long way towards ensuring you keep threat.  keep in mind that +15% damage may not seem like much, but the righteous fury component of boosting threat from holy damage makes that 15% damage be more like +50% THREAT from those spells. 
---
3/5 spiritual focus along with 3/3 improved conc aura makes you over 90% resistant to damage delays when casting, and a very good silence resist for your group members as a healer
---
3/3 healing light is obvious as is concecration.  Personally I like the extra fear resist here over stuff like longer judgment duration.  You can simply 'refresh' the judgment on the target for very little mana, and you're unlikely to have to do this more than once or twice in a longer fight.  It's irrelevant as a tank because your melee strikes refresh the duration.
---
Similarly I don't like improved BOW- hopefully some other paladin that isn't trying to tank on the side can take it!  You get BOK so you can always buff that, or light. 
---
5/5 holy power + 5/5 illumination makes you an awesome raid healer.  Holy shock is high mana, high cooldown, and heals the same as Flash.  It's a PVP talent IMO. 
---
Prot tree is pretty self explanatory.  I feel that toughness is not as good as shield spec, improved RF, or improved conc aura.  If you have enough +hit gear, you can take points out of precision.  I love the reduced cooldown on BOP, BOP is an extremely helpful spell as a tank because it can get the monster focused back on you if you lose threat.  
---
Sanctuary is mandatory as a tank, without it you simply don't do enoguh 'reflective' damage IMO to keep that AOE threat.  Ret aura is good, but redoubt is intended to work with blessing of sanc and the damage reduction is also very helpful.  
---
Not in my experience, or any of the other top guilds on my server seem to follow this
---
There are other cloth turn ins no ? (Or are they just one time things)
---
Wow this was a train wreck of a comment
---
Blessing of Protection.  It is a pally spell that prevents physical damage on the target and usually drops Aggro.  3-5m cooldown.
---
I downvoted you for abusing the overused word "toxic." Because people don't like playing the way you like does not make them toxic. Sounds like you might be that person you claim to despise.
---
I'm not sure why you're stuck on the axes being labeled. I should have labeled them for consistency, but the units were discussed in detail and it shouldn't impede understanding. 
---
The Y axis is arbitrary distance and the X axis is time in seconds.
---
Gen Z
---
Incendius is very balances.
---
    
---
     /run SetCVar("name","value");
---
Sounds like my experience with &lt;RUIN&gt; on Whitemane. They have a terrible (and supposedly well-deserved) rep on the server but the 2-3 members from there I’ve ever played with were perfectly pleasant people and competent players.
---
I play tank. These are my friends. Then I get yelled at for not tanking like they didn't just pull all the agro. They seemed to think tanks have an AOE agro at low levels.
---
I'm kinda hopefully blizz sees how popular classic has been and starts toning retail back a little.
---
You only get locked when you kill a boss, or enter a raid where any boss has been killed. Best way to check is to open your raid menu (O -&gt; raid tab) and check the Raids button on top right. If it's disabled or MC is not listed there, you're fine. Though note that it sometimes bugs and shows you as saved to some ID when it shouldn't, and that can be fixed by a relog. Had that happen on onyxia once, was pretty scary.
---
mmmm... I actually got it on the first kill, but thought for weeks that it was just a 100% drop. It wasn't until one of my friends ranted at me that he had been trying the past 3-4 years trying to get the mount that I realized it was a rare drop.
---
hmm other posters said to go for int mail ala turtle gear
---
Well, yeah.
---
What would you say the most “in demand” role is?
---
Only in the non 55+ dungeons.  
---
In LBRS, UBRS, BRD, it's still toxic as hell if you're the cause of any issues. Even if it doesn't cause a death.  Killing a pack that isn't absolutely necessary and some groups will just rag you for wasting time.
---
&gt;I want to hear why anyone thinks the type of behavior in the picture beyond the first joke is appropriate in any way
---
Dude you are acting much worse than anyone in this picture. Everyone is telling you so but it’s going right over your head. I wish you could stop and realize how you’re acting but I know you’re just going to double down on how everybody else is being toxic, not you. If you run into one asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you’re the asshole.
---
Lol. Came here to make this joke. Take my upvote.
---
VC*
---
I play retail only but even when I'm tanking I really don't like blaming anyone. I just learn to laugh it off if I die
---
What?
---
I'm saying that since we don't know our movement speed, we don't calculate the time by doing it's X away and we move at Y so it takes Z seconds.
---
Instead you just have a feel for how many seconds away it is to run, from running all over the world all these years
---
As long as it's only trash, you won't be saved to anything and are free to join another group.
---
A common (and admittedly unfair) criticism of libertarians is that they want to abolish age of consent laws.
---
Tank
---
A world where we don’t eat egg snot thanks
---
Mayo is food lube, it’s only use is to make too-dry food edible
---
The lower the speed, the higher the damage on the top end.
---
My mom has a 60 mage and everyone always whispers if she could make them a portal to some place.
---
Questing for money is maybe 10g an hour for me? I mean it's money for sure, but I wouldn't call 100g in 10 hours "quickly".
---
But yeah, high end quests are in cramped zones and I'm not a great mob killer.
---
Im level 21 on my warrior and so far its not that bad so long as you keep your weapon skills high
---
Retail is a hot chick, and classic is the girl with the cool personality
---
You really should google, or search the sub b4 posting a question.
---
The biggest issue will be to have both, the mining and herbalism detection enabled on your mini map. Because you can't. 
---
So you will miss all those resource nodes or plants that are not in plain sight.
---
Ok ok good to know, I was going to level arms and then probably go fury tank spec for end game, cause I am on a PvP server and I do like PvPing in open world and I don't think going full prot tank will be good in WPvP?
---
&gt; and even TBC it was still palatank.
---
The main resource for tankadins was [maintankadin.failsafedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070312144121/http://maintankadin.failsafedesign.com/) during TBC.

Am shaman-

I SWEAR TO GOD THE AMOUT OF MAGES WHO GIVE ME LIKE 15 WATER FOR A RUN IS INSANE 
---
LIKE BRUH
---
So tilted...
---
It’s worse than this. This above guy is lying to you because he got scammed from his transfer. Reports are closer to 80:20 the server is one of the worst in the game.
---
Benediction has a better balance for example.
---
Blizzard would generally do it themselves, you didn't need a ticket for it
---
&gt; Blizzard should .. before I, we sue the company in court....
---
Lmao... jesus christ.
---
They can, but will be subpar on harder fights and will most likely require more mana breaks. Tanking is however very much possible. Skull marking and being a few levels above the thrash helps with aggro
---
I bought my epic first with 0 regrets because getting raid loot is super easy
---
&gt; Just heal the tank, let the DPS die, and then tell them "learn how to play Vanilla and manage your threat level".
---
This is how I'll be conducting business from this point forward.
---
This is a solid answer.  Instead of blame, look for a solution, and in this case, I believe the solution is in the dps.
---
Once aggro breaks, it becomes harder to re-establish and maintain control.  So if the dps says “heal through it,” they’re continuing to contribute to the problem instead of trying to help.  So you’re healing them, they’re continuing to build threat, and then that breaks to you, and is continuing to get harder for the tank to manage.
---
People who don’t believe threat is dps responsibility to manage, just don’t realize how much control over aggro the dps has.  Almost every threat problem can ONLY be fixed by cooperative dps.
---
Blood and thunder!
---
I completely discarded everything happened till 1.12 sinc it was discarded by Blizzard themselves.
---
I need to reconsider my ignite mage statement since fights now are so shorter than they were before it allows fury to excel. I mean if you have your death wish up for the entirety of the whole fight which is 30s you parse like no one else.
---
It's dominating group formation from ~28-50 and contributing to a massive population imbalance for mages.
---
If you happen to not fit the Spellcleave/Zombies mould pulling together a ZF run is brutal.
---
Wow. They took a clip of killing who they are colluding with.  This somehow implies they never collude? Lol
---
Yep I have that done too ;p
---
Have you considered elemental? It's actually doing reasonable damage in raids for now and supposedly wrecks people in pvp. It can heal reasonably well, too.
---
If you die with everyone ready pre-pull, zero heal and don’t blame anyone, that’s kinda cool.
---
If you are surprised that your party member is OK with running in yellow mobs without damaging them until you say ready, and when she/he dies you put the video capture as “Mage.mp4” that’s not as cool.
---
I’ve played since May, am hooked now
---
If I didn’t have to leave for my lectures I certainly would’ve
---
Once i hit 40 i feel like the guild might be able to dungeon spam me so that's still great thanks!
---
Just hit 40 on my Druid. I'm a bit short on gold for my mount.   
---
   
---
I mob grinded the past few levels and did pretty damn well going from about 3g at 37 to 62g at 40. To break up the monotony; are any of the lower level dungeons lucrative enough to grind out the rest of the gold i need? I've been in the Badlands fighting the lil' Drakes in hopes of a pet drop, but no luck. If not; any grinding suggestions that are good for a Druid (good at quick, single target stuff) with Leather Working (225)? 
---
Hunter levels in a similar way. Both can take on multiple mobs and fight higher levels. Hunters are more involved though as you get to pick a pet from all the tameable animals. Also you have to carry ammo. Its an easy transition and similar though.
---
duel wield furry warrior
---
It wasn't to burn mana it was more of a taunt/BM. He was already dead at that point.
---
I also do this with any Healthstones and/or Soulstones I may have left before logoff.
---
I would say you could definitely find one on a RP server
---
&gt; Your average player may be just totally confused by it. The problem could be solved by making the y axis time saved vs. running.
---
Or hear me out, you correct people so they are more literate in reading graphs, so in the future when they come across graphs they understand how to read them.
---
A fluent Spanish speaking teacher is technically correct when they point out someone is butchering pronunciations as well. They don't shrug their shoulders and go "well I guess I pronounce it how they do now, because there are so many more people in the class butchering how it is pronounced."
---
I really can't support any form of idea that pushes education in the direction of producing less science literacy, hence it absolutely being worth arguing for.
---
If the expectation would be for an elementary school student or middle school student to understand independent and dependent variables on a graph, I think it is not too low of a bar to set for reddit. In particular in a thread about a graph.
---
Have fun in retail I guess. No one is forcing you to play classic!
---
Alright good point, tho in most of these cases none of the other healers really need a concentration aura efect, Outside from AQ? I think. So my point here is how often is this really going to benefit you noticably over how often does having better threat for tanking benefit you.
---
I'd wager going for the threat will be more noticable, but I'll admit that I am going on gut feeling here.
---
The maraudon trinket, at least for warrior, is top threat and top tanking assuming you're tanking multiple mobs and still ranking very high when tanking only one. But honestly I don't know how it stacks against druid armor trinkets.
---
Blackhand's Breadth gets outpaced by the Dragonfang Talisman.
---
It's a PVP server. The Alliance are scum. Under the right circumstances if I was just there to turn in or I was on my way out to group with friends or head to a group waiting for me and it happened I would be pissed. Which is what makes it all funny. Recall every moment in your life that you were super pissed at something stupid and I bet if it was long enough ago that you think it's funny now.
---
iirc it's slightly different color but I could be wrong
---
Completionists
---
People did do it back then. Just not to this extent.
---
May I ask what's the boss I have to kill to have this mount? :)
---
There is an event but no HH, aka no mount. That wasn't until BC
---
You must understand that so much of what you wrote is subjective, right?
---
So many things are not black and white.
---
People wanting to know a distance, that's subjective, it depends how far the distance is, do you know how far 270 yds is in game, no, but I have a good handle on how far I travel on my mount in 24 seconds.
---
Even the convention to put independent variables on the X-Axis is, on some level, subjective, the scientific community decided to do that, and since time so often is the independent variable, a new convention emerged, and this graph has both of them conflicting.
---
I think it's ok if we abandon the Independent/Dependent for the sake of clarity, the main goal of a graph is to convey information, and I think people get too hung up on the IV/DV correctly being assigned.
---
It also strikes me as quite ironic that someone so keen on science would fight so passionately about something that is convention but not beneficial, when science's is role has historically been to challenge conventional traditions, to see if they have validity.
---
Today I say the Independent/Dependent convention should be challenged because by the looks of this thread, it's not working very effectively.
---
Technically, the /focus command was added in the tbc pre-patch when they moved to Macro2.0, prior to that however there were add-ons that's utilized the /script command from Macro1.0 that functioned to create main tank/main assist windows. The /focus command was added to keep this functionality, while removing the ability for "one button macros" allowed by Macro1.0. 
---
Classic wow uses Macro2.0, thus should include /focus to preserve the functionality of focus from Macro1.0
---
Your comment is trash.
---
They are only one time
---
Not only that, that stupid fucking Disguise is on for only 30 minutes. So you wait 15 min, just for another group to snag him, forcing you to go down south to get the buff reapplied.
---
You probably missed the "reply" button on the comment you were replying to.
---
Oh absolutely, it’s just not better lol
---
You're very knowledgeable. I have another question for you, if I may: Given all this information about weapon skills, when is it worth swapping out sword/mace for a non-racial weapon (human warrior)? How big of an upgrade does it have to be and is it ever worth it? I do see a lot of human tanks sporting daggers and the like and it's always confused me.
---
Shamans are one of the worst farming classes out there. Vendoring grays/greens is roughly 6-8g an hour for me.
---
They have this built into the client. Go into your Interface Settings and you can enable it.
---
Fair enough. Good luck on the next 3 levels
---
I'm a lefty and until age 26 used my right hand for the mouse. After long gaming sessions I would get this really aggravating feeling in my brain that felt like it was connected to my right hand...hard to describe but it felt frustrating and I had to stop, often put me in a bad mood for a while. Particularly if the game required precision. 
---
I switched to an ambidextrous mouse and used my left hand out of curiosity, it was awkward at first but I never got that nagging annoying feeling in my brain again. After a few months it was more natural than my right hand had ever been.
---
They used to force lefties to write right-handed and that practice is connected to all sorts of mental health issues. I wouldn't be surprised if continually using a mouse for precision-work had a similar effect for some people. Probably not a huge issue with WoW, but certainly online fps. Just a theory, but in my case I definitely felt a lot less frustrated when gaming after the switch. Personally I wish I'd always used my left hand.
---
This doesn't make sense
---
Oh god, the post title needs an Alabama joke but I'm going to resist.
---
Just reroll. It's going to be more fun if you level up together. If you end up playing more than her (I'm guessing that's likely), you can play your 47 when she's not on.
---
Bruh you're a warrior this is the only way to kill you.
---
You should be using Leatrix Plus anyways which has this built in
---
I got enough gold for my warrior mount by L37 from farming fishing spots and floating wreckages on Eastern coast of Dustwallow Marsh. Killed neutral turtles (L36-38) and skinned going up and down the coast too. Sold all at AH and made about 6-8 gold per hour (more when selling greens that dropped). There are no hostile mobs for a large stretch and barely any competition. I did this in the morning, though. I'm sure there are faster ways but I'm on a PvP server so farming where I'm less likely to get ganked was nice.
---
QQ
---
Damn multi boxing is OP haha
---
Victory in the sense that enough people think there's a potential case, and giving blizzard an incentive to settle the case. Personally I don't think it's going to court and probably op is just fuming. But why not take it forward? It's all about business and consumer lawsuits aren't good for any business, you literally can not win, best outcome is to not lose and it's still bad PR (although I'm not sure they care at this point).   Triggered idiots are free to waste their time suing companies, it's better to let a consumer protection agency do the heavy lifting. TBH I haven't read (and so cant know if it exists) the exact contract term and  rule op is trying to act on but there's literally no harm done by forwarding this case to some consumer protection agency and let them figure out the details. While I personally don't care about rp servers rpers should have access to the service they have paid for.
---
Yeahhh, and we are pretty friendly, but we get ganked alot by alliance, they really hate gravediggers u.u
---
Many people think they’re entitled to everything.
---
When you have to ask IN GUILD CHAT how to leave the guild I'm in, I am glad you're leaving.
---
Yeah it’s entitlement. Locked chest nodes have stuff they want but they don’t want to have the professions required to get those nodes so ‘gimme gimme gimme’
---
I think he is only talking about pre-raid BiS,.
---
Aww whittle boomer upset?

Dont ask for a group spot.

Say "LFM SM run, need // 3 DPS // 1 Tank"

Into trade chat.

Invite the responders.

Yeah I main Hunter as well, try to tell people about ranged attacks not having glancing blows but they usually don’t know what that even means.
---
That's fair. I only have a couple years of experience in vanilla rogue v Hunter. I trust your assessment. 
---
When I said dead zone I really meant melee range.
---
I dont think stamina is important in aoe set. So probably just intellect and as much spellpower as possible.
---
Right, I re-read my comment and it's really not clear that the second paragraph was about pre-30, my bad.
---
240 hz monitor. Simply set your foreground fps to 239, &amp; your resolution/fps on your cpu to 240 1920x1080 or w/e resolution. If the resolutions dont match it tends to screen tear/black screen occasionally. For. 144 hz monitor set to 143 fps. Because things are always rounded up for sale. Its not true 144, is 143.99. Same with “60 fps” its actually 59.99 or 59.49
---
 I dont have pathfinding and I do just fine. You have to kite real wide around the room and it takes a long time. Literally like 10 mins, maybe 8, something like that. Just stay out of boulder range, 20 yards,shoot arcane shots and pop off an auto shots when you get the chance. A swing timer helps with this.
---
Thanks I hate it

Isn't it what truly matters? He perseveres no matter how much may he suffer from  the lack of QoL changes.
---
This is a common phrase on Bill Burr's podcast
---
It’s 3rd pre-BiS but two quest items are much better. I’d never take it from a melee, that’d just be rude.
---
They have a live chat web service function as well. You select the options on the help page that warrant the “live chat” response because some of them won’t trigger it
---
I'm a 60 mage, where should I go to farm gold? I've been trying to farm ZF zombies and while I can manage it sometimes, I can't do it well consistently. I don't have full pre-BiS gear yet (got quite a few, like all out of BRD), perhaps SM Cath is a good bet?

Lel

My plan was to swap between the two tracking methods, maybe macro it with space bar lol
---
Now gtfo before the giant group of horde come and kill you
---
All of them
---
*"Them be vampire trees."*
---
ilvl  wasnt a thing till cata. Our earlier incarnation of it was gearscore from addons in wrath
---
Not sure, but it works because we all know what it refers to. Sounds catchy too.
---
It is incorrect though as a cleave in my mind refers to an ability that is single target that has an AOE splash of some sort. Generally in a cone behind the original target or a small immediate area.
---
Lmao you only have 1% hit? That’s trash
---
Your outlook on my life is subjective. Things are great.
---
Absolutely!  
---
If I'm only able to make 2 waters of my highest tier at a time, those are reserved exclusively for party members in dungeons (mostly healers before anyone else) and those who specifically request it.  
---
Once I can start making 8+ waters per cast, then I have no problem giving out that water.
---
I had a warlock in my BRD group who ONLY used Hellfire, at least according to my Details, 97,5% of his damage came from Hellfire . Didn't Soulstone, didn't have pet, didn't use healthstone or first aid when lifetapping and he didn't communicate with us. The Lyceum was hellish, and after our fourth attempt he thankfully went offline.
---
Is this strictly true? I always thought that rage was generated by damage and that faster weapons just provided smoother generation as opposed to chunky generation, i.e. 20 rage in one strike vs 10 rage in two strikes in the same time span.
---
&gt; Today I say the Independent/Dependent convention should be challenged because by the looks of this thread, it's not working very effectively.
---
I agree lets all be illiterate because people are not taught to read.
---
I agree lets all not be able to speak a language because people are not taught to speak it.
---
I agree lets all become easily confused by graphs because people are not taught to read them.
---
This graph is perfectly readable. It means EXACTLY what OP wants it to, because they made it correctly.
---
The graph also would be perfectly readable if time was on the x-axis...unfortunately it would serve a different purpose than what OP intended.
---
There is a reason why the convention exists and it IS beneficial, and it is extremely prevalent in science.
---
When you go to a standardized table/graph in ANY field, say for tolerances, it is set up this way with X being the independent variable so there is no confusion in WHAT THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS.
---
When you set up a study the reason why time is the independent variable, is because you need to know what happened at say Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 3. That standardization is important.
---
In contrast if you want to display in what substance a reaction happens faster, time now goes on the Y axis, because it is the dependent variable.
---
The convention IS beneficial because it removes the possibility of confusion WHEN IT MATTERS. Just because in a casual setting the convention DOESN'T technically matter (like here) or you don't see it being beneficial here, doesn't mean it isn't worth addressing so that when it DOES matter people are able to read it.
---
So the question is should this convention be challenged? That answer is no. Because the REASON for challenging the convention isn't actually a beneficial reason, it is one that is pushing for less clarity.
---
It is along the same lines of showing your work. I get it, I hate it too, but it is an important and worthwhile convention to have, because the ability to replicate is important. You don't teach people to show their work on the project that really matters. You teach them to show their work for the stuff that doesn't matter.
---
People getting confused because they never learned the convention isn't a good reason to drop the convention, if anything it is a demonstration of why it is important to TEACH THE CONVENTION.
---
A graph should NEVER confuse someone who is literate in reading graphs. In this thread there are people confused by graphs because they are not literate in reading graphs.
---
You don't tell someone who can't read that, maybe no one should no how to read because they don't. You don't decide all books should be picture books, because text confuses illiterate people. No you push to increase literacy, because even if often times it isn't important...there are times it is extremely important.
---
The same can be said with graphs, and following the conventions for graphs. There is a difference between challenging a convention to a beneficial end and challenging a convention because you are lazy. This is definitively the latter.
---
Not if they've already started the pull when you arrive :(
---
You could probably knock out the essences pretty quick as a mage, I'd suspect. That being said, on my server (Kirtonos H) essences are pretty cheap. Living 2.5g, Fire 4g, Earth 4g, Water 3g.
---
Yes it was the only one back in vanilla.  AH in all major cities were added in patch 1.9
---
Herod is most definitely not balanced. It’s like 60-40 horde. Maybe even as bad as 70-30 in high quest hub areas.
---
Hah, that's crazy. I remember finally getting that set on my rogue back in vanilla. Took forever and a great guild to get them.
---
Hardcore, elite gamers.
---
If someone is suffering that much from a video game and can’t handle that, they def have bigger issues and WoW isn’t the reason.
---
Currently playing a druid - love it. Fav class in the game. I want to make an alt alliance on another server, i’m thinking HS. My question is, i have no clue what class actually interests me except druid, but i am worried about end game parties not wanting to take me as a healer. I want another class that have a couple options for what they can do, and preferably solo. i’m tempted to just make a hunter but i dislike the idea of a ‘pure dps’ character. I’d like to be able to do 2 roles pretty well, but in vanilla it seems that isn’t super common. 
---
completely lost on what to make next
---
Headbands need 5 leather, tunics need 7.
---
Both require 2 Silken Thread which are 4s 50c each.
---
Headbands sell to a vendor for 44s95c. Tunics for 59s 71c.
---
Buying thread for 9 silver leaves you 35s95c from headbands and 50s71c from tunics.
---
35s95/5  = 7 silver 19 copper per piece of leather for headbands.
---
50s71c/7 = 7silver and 24c per piece of leather for tunics (actually 7s 24.4285714c, but we round down for this purpose).
---
Dunno, just trying to imagine a scenario where his reaction is justified. 
---
Maybe he was a hunter fighting a Demon for his bow and you just fucked him royally by healing him?
---
You should try sapping people when they jump, when sap ends you fall straight down.
---
All of my friends eat and drink after every pull even just to top off... obviously you want to top off before a boss or some shit but if you're playing close to full mana or health you're not using your resources effectively.
---
&gt;I'm not saying that it's necessarily worth it, but it is *technically* still the best wolf since attack speed is only a positive. Some people just like having the best, even if it's marginal/insignificant/irrelevant. 
---
&gt;
---
This.
---
Yeah but non miners shouldn’t rill for mine nodes just as non blacksmiths and rogues shouldn’t roll for locker chests
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Exactly, but why being reasonable about it when I can threaten to sue blizzard ?
---
It’s still very different from retail, you’re just being distracted.
---
But how others approach the game shouldn’t affect as much as you are allowing it. If others don’t mesh with your playstyle, there’s thousands of others that you can meet and mesh with. The min/max, rush to the finish players are and have always been a vocal [severe] minority.
---
I'm really bad at tanking. I'm playing warrior for the first time and I haven't done any dungeons til now (lvl 38). I tried tanking and I have a really hard time holding aggro when there's a mob of 3+. 
---
We're not wiping but I find myself chasing after mobs to keep them together. I'm wondering if there's a guide I can read/watch that doesn't only focus on end-game content so I can understand the basics of tanking.
---
you forfeit her loot for the run when you do the quest. Youd have to come back after completing the quest in order to get drops from her
---
What does that have to with streamers? You just look at realm population, avoid the high/full realms.
---
&gt; and people instead of saying "SHOULDN'T HAVE PICKED A PVP SERVER THAN HUUUUUUUUUUR"
---
Wait.. I might derp and type this on reddit,  But do people actually say this shit in /1 for calls of help of being ganked? If I've the free time and they happen to be nearby. I'd be coming on down to help.
---
Who has the least "downtime" when levelling? 
---
* Hunters/Warlocks because Pet tanking?
---
* Druid's because they regen mana when in Bear/Cat form?
---
* Rogue because their only downtime is their Healthbar?
---
I have a short attention span and constantly reroll alts. I figure if I am not sat there watching a resource regen I may have a better time leveling!
---
As long as you're actually still healing I think 0/30/21 is totally fine. I just wouldn't bring an actual dps shaman since they'll be a country mile behind basically about other "real" dps class
---
Will have to take a deeper look in to it, swear I didn't see it. Cheers mate.
---
I don't get Spellcleave? Mages don't have abilities that cleave.  Cleave means an attack on a main target that hits additional targets.  CoC is a cone attack and blizzard is AoE.
---
I wonder if a shadowpriest could do this with a survival setup.
---
I like pvp, spamming the same dots, aoe and shadowbolt for 10 years can get a bit repetitive.
---
For non-plate wearers that are engineers, the Goblin Rocket Helmet is a BOE helmet crafted by Goblin Engineers (but can be worn by any Engineer) that has a similar effect.

---
Two main issues with a pala tank, coming from someone played a paladin in classic and a warrior now is that paladins just aren't as fast as warriors, and they don't have the same threat gen for single target as us. Which disqualifies you as raid tanks, fine for dungeons though as long as people are cool with your speed.
---
Literally any stranger asking for water without paying for it.
---
Obviously groups (dungeons, group quests, whatever) are different, and it's normal to give people water in those situations. But I'm not going to stop what I'm doing in the middle of Tanaris to summon water for some random guy walking by.
---
I have a good life. It was complete until I saw that sword just now.
---
There has been a lot of HS propaganda from alliance trying to say the server is balanced lol
---
It depends, there were a few cases where I was wearing something 20 levels behind because I just wasn't getting luck with drops, then it could be time to hit the AH.
---
Thank you, I was really confused:)

Well you better go back to retail for it cause it doesn't exist in classic.

The other day I was 40 mins into a Stratholme run when the lead goes "Sorry Eddietwang, my friend just got on and wants in for Rivendare." and kicked me. Immediate add to my ignore list.
---
Watch me. Mouth the handle and swing my head.
---
Stamina gives you more margin for error when pulling large packs. I'm pretty terrible at AOE farming and regularly dip below 20% hp with large pulls in Int/Sta gear.
---
I'm more of a pvp guy, but in general spamming the same spells is very repetitive for me.
---
Is there addon to right click party member icon and get assist? I hate left clicking his portrait and then clicking elswhere on his target.

How to change the font on it? The default is unbearable.

You can though. Over by the shipwrecked crew there is a gnomish lighthouse type building. If you are good and clever you can climb back up there

imagebb, I'm guessing, but I don't know what it is beyond an imgur competitor.
---
Private servers were wrong with just about everything value wise
---
I wasnt really interested until the suing part. Blizz getting sued for abandoning RP servers seem hilarious to me.
---
And the miner can’t mine that node without the party so by that logic all mining mats should be rolled for
---
I had Cunninglinus until it was flagged so I went with Harryseaward
---
Why are you trying to make it about the person being targeted rather than the person doing it?
---
I see a lot of mentions of "scales with spell power". It seems self explanatory, but could someone please explain how it works? For example, would my warlocks new shadow damage boots be better than my old int boots?
---
Ya, I agree with you. 
---
PvE - Go for it.
---
PvP though... Definitely feels like an unfair advantage.
---
Yeah, by hunting for the arcane crystals I've already randomly farmed like 800 plagueblooms, made 150 mongoose elixirs due to the mountain silversage shortage. 
---
Tank a dungeon or two for an alchemist and he's more than happy to craft 500 potions at supper on a saturday.
---
Shadoweave
---
Well my guess is if u want to aoe farm effectively u will learn how to do it right so if ur doing it right no need for stam at all. They wont even touch you
---
That’s ... racist ?
---
Clique can probably do this.
---
but keeping your gear up to date is the game.
---
How do BOE rares/epics effect your play at all?
---
You're correct.
---
Kraure creating those bracers was so random.
---
What add-ons do you use? Looks so clean!
---
Yeah, I guess I could see the stable slot argument if you also wanted a serpent and tank.
---
I didnt have an ignore list until this quest. So many people who would just come in on the respawn and try to snatch up the escort from the group patiently waiting. Took nearly three hours thanks to the same people coming back after they fucked up the quest to try to snatch it up again.
---
If you’re an herbalist/miner, you can also obtain ghost mushrooms and mithril ore on your routes, netting you higher gold per hour. Blackstone Ring from Princess also sells for 25g-30g on some servers, but you can only sell runs to lvl 60s or lvl 50+ stealth classes to skip trash.
---
Find a rogue friend and tank mobs for him while he melts them. You being able to keep stuff turned towards you increases their dos dramatically and makes the pairing very efficient.
---
Wow what an asshat.  A druid saved my skin in STV yesterday when I was pulling a few too many mobs.  I thanked him a bunch, moved on, and saw him like 15 mins later.  He was struggling with mogh (sp?).  I charged in, killed everything for him, and he got to thank me.  Be kind to strangers peoples
---
On horde there are. Does alliance have anything similar to guard captains rune though?
---
If PvP is your focus, I'd say go Paladin. Their toolkit is absolutely fantastic.
---
Lol no all stars are based on how good you are relative to others playing your class . Hes just alot better than average bear tank. Every warrior on this list out parses the druid. Hell the top 100 warrior tanks out parse him.
---
Who said anyone wants to wipe on purpose?
---
Understandable point of view. Personally I don't go about ganking anyone unless:
---
They attack me.
---
They're attacking other horde.
---
They play mage.
---
A few of the BRD PP guides I saw factored in the solo'ing of specific bosses. Were you geared enough to do that, or were you solely pickpocketing? I'm thinking you're right, that for the fresh 60s, it would probably be better just to grind mobs.
---
Nope not in the context of a video game.  
---
If a game is literally ruining your day because you didn’t get your way in that game...your life must be pretty comfy for that to be the thing that RUINS your DAY. Lol.
---
As a healer I’ve just been making my own groups typically. That way I won’t have a douche leader who feels like he’s in power if one thing goes wrong. Wipes happen. It’s a game.
---
It was highly satisfying to just CoR those humanoid right before they drop to "run away in fear" range. X,D
---
Meanwhile others have to suffer with desperately trying to CC or slow in any way possible and pray for the mob to die in time.
---
Well not like I need it anyway most of the time because things just melt from dots.
---
Everyone tends to agree that if dps is pulling agro off of the tank, its at the fault of the dps for dying.  There aren't many enemies that can &lt;4 shot level/gear appropriate dps - so /assist \[tank\] and start over and the tank will take it back as they rotate through the mobs or through passive aoe threat generators.
---
tip for tanks - raid markers are your friend!  Skull &gt; X &gt; ffa is typically appropriate.
---
tip for dps - macro it or manually do it:  /assist \[tank\]
---
tip for healers - heal for the mechanics, not the mistakes.  if there is incoming aoe dmg or a threat reset it's fine to heal dps, other than that it's generally selfish dps.
---
This mount would be sick if your ally scum pally
---
Tons of guilds are still forming rosters.  "Good guilds" are subjective, many people are not yet 60, so maybe the top of the line tryhards are already raiding MC for a few weeks, but currently tons of guilds on my server are still running half pug groups as they fill out their guild roster.
---
So cringey.
---
False, because you can drop heals and bring more dps based of the abilities of your healing team. 
---
Any person getting offended by collected data probably needs to be removed regardless.
---
Mages...
---
That is extremely awkward. It amazes me how there are actually people like that.
---
Unbalancing the AH
---
Regardless of intended efficiency, oopsies are made.
---
There is a limit to how far money will get you. Spending hundreds of gold on boe gear only gets you a slightly faster leveling time. The biggest boost is having to farm less for a mount.
---
Well it's not interesting because the top tanks are still warriors.
---
Nope still bugged an blizzard has still not acknowledged the bug exists.
---
I told him if I'm going to play with him, he needs to make sure the house looks halfway decent before we play. I usually put the baby to sleep and he does dishes. :)
---
I was very skeptical of the graphics overhaul, figured it'd end up looking like retail. But damn did they do a good job, game actually looks amazing on high settings. 
---
In my opinion the new water is trash though. Everything on high and water quality set to low so it looks like the old water, looks best
---
Yeah my brother said the same although he still gets frustrated when he tries to come help in the zones and it's us vs 15+. It's just really shitty to let the server balance get this out of hand imo. They should open up transfers from servers that are horde sided and servers alliance sided.
---
 I can't say it'd work for sure but it's worth a shot to try and bring more Ally here and horde there.
---
True dat, I always keep a healing set on me when doing a dungeon. You never know, the healer might leave or what ever.
---
I've been getting fairly lucky I guess with most of my groups then. We tend to recruit optimal classes and levels for the dungeons we run though so haven't really wiped yet. We are at RFD level 40 right now. Will update once reaching BRD lol
---
Yeah he definitely should have casted something else, that priest was on the very verge of a comeback. After all, he is 6 levels higher than those *checks video again* uhh 4 affliction warlocks
---
When vanilla came out many people were all 15 year old edgelords scamming to get ahead, nothing is ever their fault. Most of these players are 30 now with a kid or two and are much more patient.
---
Not sure how it's the healer's fault at all, ever. Healer just heals. He doesn't have any sort of even accidental ability to pull mobs off a tank and towards a \*different\* player than himself. Not sure what that warlock was snorting.
---
I've had it pointed out multiple times in our groups how bad my roll luck is. I ran SFK 8x as a healer to get the robes. I ran WC 4x to get the ring. I've run SB library 4x and no staff yet. 
---
I'm level 40 with the WC staff.
---
TLDR CS working like CS always has
---
All of the GM's had access to the same information.
---
Yea, definitely would not buy that for 550g. Way too much for something that will absolutely drop in price as time goes on.
---
I mean a group of 5 people will always beat a multibox playing as 5.
---
Main healer here. People never watch my mana bar before they pull, and they always waste my water because I'm only 5 sec into drinking. People don't slow down for they guy responsible for your life, lol.
---
I thought so?
---
To be fair, you thought it'd be bad parenting to let a 9 year old play a game with such names as "Cleavagelovr" and when I stated my opinion on bad language, replied with "why bother parenting mirite".
---
Don't feel bad for my little guy, he's having a good time.
---
I whisper people a lot for that, although we always offer to give the reagent plus a tip.
---
got full blues and around 5 bis already. Still using Trash Blade tho.
---
What's the difference?
---
Had a hunter scatter shot freeze trap me on the chain and I fell straight down in to the lava.  It was pretty funny. I lava jumped over and killed him at the bottom.  Definite going to have some fun with the chain distracts before MC tonight :)

59 mage \~250gold.  Was at like 350 last night but had to buy mats for a guildie to make me the [Robe of Winter Night](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14136/robe-of-winter-night).  I should have gone tailor instead of herb/alchemy, oh well.
---
Herod Alliance here.
---
Yep.
---
Looks like healbot, could be different same premise tho
---
You're mad at people creating mage groups in dungeons?
---
I’m level 25 but I just now added a second profession—skinning—and don’t know where to start as all the mobs I encounter are too high level to skin.
---
Is it not even worth it at this point. Should I just stick to tailoring and selling bags/cloths in the AH?
---
Actually i can confirm as a 60 lock that shadowbolt spam in 5 mans is actually doing it right. Especially if you’re SM Ruin. ST on bosses and Multi pulls just shadowbolt and sometimes corruption for procs. You do 200+ more dps than multi dotting or dots + shadowbolt.
---
Most enemies in 5 man dungeons dont stay alive long enough to justify dots. I reserve that shit for bosses.
---
LMAO
---
Warriors should find a leveling buddy
---
Never use an AoE stun? Why not?
---
It's petty, since in all likelihood those are not the same people, just the same class.
---
That said, only a few classes fit the aoe/cleave comp, so there's always groups of other people forming, or even cleave/aoe classes who don't want to play that way.
---
Yeah but how many other methods allow you to stand in one spot and press the same three keys over and over? Laziness is a factor.

A group that not just can handle an additional group of adds, but knows exactly what to do when one is encountered/pulled.  What happens in that moment dictates how much extra work everyone has to do to stabilize.

Kinda freaky timing....

Last night i was questing in the charred vale (or w/e it is in Stonetalon.  Fuck that place) and had the curse on me from some type of mob there.  I actually liked the additional AP, but got reading the tooltip and saw that it mentioned not being able to flee.
---
I was wondering how useful that might be on my warlock once i get it that far.
---
Thank god it's Alliance. I've only ever played Horde, but it is such a waste to see it drop our side.
---
Impossible to do when not a single dps player I've seen yet has waited for me to get any threat at all before popping all CDs and blasting away with aoe skills.
---
I should make a Rogue called Spellcleave. Then I'll spend the whole day replying to people who look for spellcleave, saying "here I am".

This seems like a very unclear situation.   
---
On one hand, it did seem casually nonchalant how the leader just took the neck without really doing my explanation, then with the classic ‘I put in hours of work’ line... 
---
 On the other hand, literally everyone except for who I’m assuming is OP in the discord mention they had discussed the specific issue for hours.        
---
Either way, IMO this isn’t a worthy post without more context.
---
It's hard to be positive when you feel like trash everyday of your life.
---
Mmm. Yeah. I'm a Priest so want to see healing I'm doing on party members.
---
I’ve been leveling an enhancement shaman as an alt. I haven’t run as dps once yet.
---

---
Honestly at 55 it's probably easier to just go balls deep in BRD
---
Character Notes add-on. It still works for classic.
---
Paladin? DPS? Wrong expansion.
---
Damn, you must have no life or friends
---
Way easier to let the mage pull all the scarabs at once and blink out than for me as rank to hit one at a time
---
Can't you just Ctrl+S and Ctrl+M when you log onto your bank alt? That'll mute sound effects and then music. Then just do it again on your main to turn them back on.
---
Well. If he levels tailoring a bit more he can still make mooncloth every 4 days. And doing that is technically transmuting felcloth to mooncloth. So I think it's fine to say transmute.

And everything is permaglued to me after a few sunders/revenges.
---
Exactly the same for me, I normally game from 7ish to 10ish
---
You could go back and farm some beasts to catch up, but yeah it's something you should've considered earlier. Depends on how you value leveling time vs income.
---
Someone asked me if I wanted to heal an aoe SM cath the other day. I responded "spellcleave you mean"?
---
No response.
---
Well, if that's true then you can disenchant anything on a level 5 alt.
---
The basilisks in Southern shimmering flats would prob be perfect. They drop high value grays, you can easily interrupt the stun as a rogue, and they skin into heavy leather which is decent money
---
Still better than not useful and low-valued.
---
seriously, OP crying about it on Reddit is miserable.
---
I'm at 12 hours and lvl 15 :-D
---
5 of those hours are from launch night the rest here and there
---
thanks friend
---
Same. I stopped inviting them to groups.
---
I’d recommend earth elementals in blared lands, the SW spot has a good amount of them and the loot is quite profitable
---
All I’m saying is just because you can doesn’t mean you should
---
Is that the dude from Sekiro?
---
dude u might, that ground is deff just straight up brown and not green at all
---
Bears are actually incredible off tanks in raids and people are beginning to be much more accepting of it being part of the meta. They easily surpass warriors in threat generation and have higher mitigation at prebis gear level. Many guilds will opt to use at least 1 bear tank in raids.
---
I definitely agree with you on cat dps though. It is sub par overall. You would have to put in way more effort than other raiders through the use of consumables and manual crowd pummelers to even keep up. You would mainly be taken to raids as an off tank if you are feral, not dps.
---
Pick up cooking at the same time and stack leather and boar/ wolf meat from a starting zone. That way you'll lvl both at the same time
---
Gathermate and Classic Codex. 
---
Classic Codex shows herb and ore spawns with a very high accuracy (couple black lotus spawns are missing)
---
Gathermate shows where you already found your shit.
---
Then bind ores mouse wheel up and herbs mouse wheel down.
---
After a week of farming you pretty much know all locations and know your travel routes.
---
Get stone talon mountain all the way up north for the flight path. Easy honor farm in front of the horde town, people running in from barrens, as a twink during phase 2 so you can have your pvp trinket as soon as BGs come out.
---
He posted it because people in similar situations make these claims on this sub saying they are innocent, and get shit on by everyone calling them liars and cheaters. 
---
The whole post was to point out not everyone's a liar and maybe not just shit on people. 
---
I'm not saying it wasn't a long ass post...cause that was long as shit. But, maybe read the post  entirely if you're gonna criticize them.
---
I heard this rumor that some of them even get paid working wages for it?!?!
---
Should be fury until you are one of the main tanks in raid.
---
I tend to meet these people a lot in classic
---
Oooohhhh ok, i guess i was mistaken on how it worked. So really they didnt lose health the bar just got "longer" so it shifts the health over to adjust
---
Low angle does wonders to capture the lighting effects, and just like real life, shortly after sunrise and before sunset provided the best lighting effects.
---
Many thanks for your suggestion.
---
I wish you good luck also.
---
Ooh...i put this in the daily questions, but maybe it belongs here.
---
Druid main, going to run the 0/30/21 hybrid that allows endgame tanking as well as endgame healing. (Unless I'm force to pick, then probably just heal).  I'm doing herb/alch on my main.
---
Once i ding 60 this week, i'll be looking to an alt...I know hunters, warlocks and mages are all easy to level.  I wouldn't be planning to raid with them.  I'm trying to figure out which class and which professions for my alt.
---
Hunters seem easiest to grind with at 60, but it does seem like a pain to deal with pet management for an alt.  Mages seem pretty easy to level, although it sounds dull.  Warlocks I ran in TBC and enjoyed thoroughly, but also I haven't heard they do anything great for grinding at 60...mages and hunters seem better.
---
Any suggestions on which DPS to run for leveling ease and end game professions/grinding?
---
Warrior was a pain in the ass to level in my experience, but I have loved leveling a rogue. They have an amazing toolkit for getting out of jams. If I'm taking heavy damage, boom, evasion. If it looks like ima die, boom, vanish. Makes it a lot easier to solo content because for like killing bosses (world quest bosses, not dungeon, though it probably works for them too) all you gotta do is stealth in, go balls out on him and kill him quickly, then vanish and drop all his minions' aggro. It's amazing!
---
Stun resist is the best pvp racial in the game, change my mind
---
I mean if healers have no trouble keeping you up, you build threat faster, boss dies faster...why not?
---
Have you done it or been in groups where people have done it?
---
Gratz! My friend and I actually talked about this yesterday and how he farmed it in vanilla. He said you need exalted in Agent Dawn for it to even drop. Is this true? What is your rep with Argent Dawn atm?
---
So a problem I had was I didn't realize defensive stance was from a warrior quest.  Hopefully you don't have that issue, but that was embarrassing for me.
---
I have a level 20 Paladin, 20 Warrior, and 19 Hunter.  Can't decided on a class to main.  I'd really like to take up tanking in 5 mans, so Paladin seemed like a good choice(AoE tank 5 mans, heal raids, bubble/hearth PvP...).  Then I rolled Warrior when everyone and their dog told me that Paladin was just a poor man's warrior.  It's been fun, but I'm already finding it a challenge to level solo....but I *might* be happier playing a real tank in the long run.   
---
My Hunter was on a whim and it's fun and thematic, but maybe too passive?  I love how easy it is to level, but I'm worried I won't be useful or needed at 60.  
---
Finding a dungeon group was a lot harder on my Hunter than on my Pally or Warrior and time is money friend.  
---
Help?  :)
---
12 hrs gaming a day is nothing. Especially if you are a student in university. (Yeah obv not a normal person, but it is not that hard either)
---
Is that the mithril spurs? I thought it was like 3%
---
Theramore is one of those places in WoW where the limitations of the game really hold it back.
---
In game it's just a little fort with 5 small buildings.
---
In lore Theramore is *the* Alliance stronghold of Kalimdor. It's like the Stormwind of Kalimdor.
---
Shame they couldn't represent that in WoW.
---
This, even leveling as shadow if the tank keeps threat and is actually using a shield instead of ravager my mana stays near full. Wand until tank gets low then 1 cast greater heal and a renew to follow up let's me go back to wanding until I'm full mana again. Rinse and repeat.
---
Can confirm this actually happens. My great uncle was sued by a guy he pulled from an overturned car before it caught fire and he sued him claiming the injuries left him in a state where hed rather be dead, and he won the suit. Guy only had some broken bones but claimed he no longer could smell and had hearing loss.
---
Whirlwind axe is your friend, it's very common for lvl30 warriors to fine a group for that quest. Do it!!
---
Can't count the number of times I've helped the horde on my server only to have them thank me, walk away, come back 5m later with friends, and collectively destroy me. I'll keep doing it though.
---
Just smaller groups, pull outliers via rank 1 fireball.
---
Thanks, will try all these spots
---
I've stayed on par/ahead of the gear curve on my warrior, have generally had good weapons all throughout, am currently lvl 42 and warrior generally still feels pretty bad to level as solo.
---
I wouldn’t bother reading into this. Even if people are trying to lowkey flex who cares?  
---
The reality you are seeking though is that there are many different people that play wow. Some can play 1 hr a day and make it to 60 week 4, some play 12 hours a day and are still at lvl 20. There are tons of factors and personal preferences that come into play when it comes to wow and playtime, and no one should be judged one way or the other.  
---
 My viewpoint is - don’t judge someone on their hobbies unless they are neglecting something more important in their life. And no, work doesn’t count :)
---
In the range of 7-10 thousand cloth, depending on your rep level.
---
I've done a few dungeons with you mate. GZ!
---
I can't really comprehend why you're asking on Reddit instead of just asking in game to find out for yourself if people would be willing to go out of their way to help you
---
Lockpicking is a rogue utility to the group..
---
I do remember using something like focus in late vanilla, during the TBC prepatch.  I know it was then because I was still leveling my warlock and had the felguard.
---
Carefully. [This](https://youtu.be/hqKjds4LqQU?t=320) is a timestamp from an old, well known guide. There are many new ones made for Classic, though.
---
Not the BoP's that you get from dungeons boss drops.
---
That sounds like an awesome time tbh
---
Most people like to exaggerate and seem more efficient than they are. I've found over the years to take *everything* with a grain of salt. Gold per hour claims are usually doubled, leveling is definitely exaggerated, and DPS is often exaggerated. People just like to claim to be better than they are online.
---
What you’re doing is giving them +stam, let’s say for example, 8 stamina. If their health was 400/720, and you give them
---
8 stamina, their health is now 400/800. So their actual current health doesn’t change, but their total % of health goes down, because you’re increasing the *capacity*. 
---
You can troll people with Fort though, when they’re jumping off of a zeppelin, since fall damage is based on % of your HP. Knocking their total % down, even though their current health is the same, can kill them when they’re about to take fall damage.
---
Unless you're doing ubrs, lbrs, ony attunelent, any quest outside of black rock spire, or going anywhere in azeraoth besides brd or MC :p
---
You will get it eventually, just keep grinding.
---
I really don't want to think what will happen with epic mount speed though
---
I have mine bound to mousewheel click personally. Cause there really aren't any other actions that I feel make sense on that button.
---
Engineering is the only profession that creates things that generate threat in a fight, so even with the use of consumables and/or engineering shields it's not enough if dps don't let you have the global cooldowns.
---
His question was "what can I do to fix this problem" and my long-winded answer boils down to: it's the dps fault for starting too soon it's mathematically impossible for even the best tank to hold aggro zero time to generate it.
---
That robe will be replaced, the mount will never be replaced.
---
&gt;But that's not quite the same as being a full fledged tank.
---
Was this comment directed at the bear?
---
Fixing to link you a bunch of skarm videos that prove you very wrong, but want to make sure i interpreted you correctly first. :)
---
I dont think that weakauras can do that at all, apart from just displaying shard count.
---
They automatically go into shard bags, but I swap bags often, and necrosis will move stuff for me which is convenient.
---
Broken tooth for pvp is nice bc cast pushback (highest atk speed)
---
What would you consider to be the appropriate hit, crit and stamina range or minimums?
---
You should get the cheap ram so you can farm the gold at least.  Walking around until you have like 2k gold is going to be a huge bitch.
---
For what it's worth, I play Horde on Mankrik which is supposed to be 75%+ horde and I see oodles and oodles of allies around.
---
Not usually, will hop on when I get home, what's your handle?
---
I usually spend the first few hours of wow on FP to bank, AH, boat while I cook breakfast, water the garden, clean up around the house.
---
Can anyone in your guild make the devilsaur stuff? You'd probably get a much better rate off of a guildie than Johnny Auctionhouse
---
No guild just one real life friend and a few people I’ve met online. We are not hardcore but we try and play when we can.
---
If he opened a ticket then yea. But if he didnt no.
---
Sub rogue :)
---
So it was announced, you knew about it, and still choose to join the raid. I dont see the problem here
---
Blacksmithing would like a word with crafting times haha. I routinely afk for 20 just to create 5-10 bracers in the iron/mithril range. 
---
This is good info, thank you for the detailed responses. I appreciate it. 
---
The mats for FAP are just 2 oily black mouths?
---
I met a random dude following the same guide as me and we had a freaking blast questing. We even got lost on a road and got stuck multiple times just laughing. There are truly fun people out there.
---
If you're not on my server I can PM you the deets.
---
Sure that might work in SM, but that wont work in ZF where you have to worry about mobs who can regenerate from their fallen comrades or about getting frogged every pull.
---
I didn't actually.  I actually don't go on the official forums much, but I'll check it out!  To be honest I've only been using reddit really and added my info to the find friends spreadsheet thing that was created awhile ago.
---
Does every class pull 15 elite mobs at a time and kill them all at once? Apply your logical to the context of the conversation, maybe?
---
Eh, a lot of pulls have multiple ways they could go, multiple targets to CC, different thoughts of priority targets, etc.  Making a good group into a great group comes from making sure all are in agreement before the pull, which can't happen without good communication.  Great players don't necessarily make great groups, we've all been in groups with very competent players who refuse to communicate or work as a team and cause more grief than necessary.  What makes progress smooth is when great players are also great communicators.
---
If you buy mage food, you’re paying another player and that money is still in circulation.
---
As a rogue who is completely new to wow and really wants to learn everything about the game and mechanics so I can be as useful as I can to groups, thank you.  Made some mistakes in dungeons recently because I don’t know any better and people can sometimes be pretty rude instead of trying to help, so thanks for these tips I appreciate someone trying to give pointers instead of just shaming for being bad/new
---
:3
---
You want to sue blizz over this? Lmao. Are you rping as a lawyer in real life? Pathetic
---
I commented on it [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbqtq5/help\_with\_aoe\_farming/f23o26h?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbqtq5/help_with_aoe_farming/f23o26h?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Also Frostlive covers this on his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHwwqkcca50VLT3yrGhKSw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmHwwqkcca50VLT3yrGhKSw)
---
Ok awesome thank you.
---
No but only mage can kite them without being touched wtf man you really dont see it?
---
Is this not a meme spec when it comes to raid DPS?
---
\*wags tail\*
---
Herod best server :D
---
5 from base, 25 from racial, 15 from talent.
---
5+25=30, 30+15=45.
---
checks out
---
Do tell
---
I was with you until the WE WILL SUE line lmao
---
Good luck with that
---
Can’t even be mad
---
No communication tends to be just as toxic as being toxic imo. You had every right to leave. "shit happens" usually involves people talking and smiling after a fail. Multiple fails can get very tedious if it's the same person doing the fails though.
---
Some people are collecting preBiS so they can get into a guild who regularly raids.
---
Have you tried adjusting your gprahics settings?
---
is the badlands good at 38? i just dinged this morning and was getting tired of grinding around Theramore.
---
I just said I've seen the guy spamming in LookingForGroup for 2 hours straight looking for the ideal comp AOE group.
---
Are priests just preferred because they can bubble the spellcasters?
---
awwww. what a cute tsundere :)
---
You had one job
---
It is
---
Like in any game, if there are more enemies you are going in the correct direction.
---
The intelligent mages out there aren't farming spots with tons of competition for sure. There are tons of great spots out there to AOE farm. But the spots that people naturally gravitate towards are the ones placed in guides. And the people who are following those guides are generally inexperienced and don't know better. So they read their guide that says "The fastest way to level is to go to x and aoe farm y mob" and they go there and try to do that without a second thought because they don't know better.
---
If this is serious... Those dwarfs are friendly to the alliance. You have a quest to go talk to them as alliance but no option of attacking or looting them.
---
Last night I repeatedly killed a tauren prot warrior trying to farm my elementals.  Sorry but it had to be done
---
No, it's just the ultra graphic settings.
---
Me not keeping up with the story and getting to know this way that Tirion dies later on.
---
Hi, I’m looking to play a high skill cap melee class for PvP, I’m stuck between warrior and rogue, any help?
---
\#showtooltip Ambush
---
/cast Pick Pocket
---
/cast Ambush
---
change ambush for Sap, Cheap Shot, Garrote, or any other opener.
---
Get loots (sometimes you have to loot the corpse a second time to get the Pick Pocket loot if you don't have a quick loot addon. but the macro works)
---
You're welcome.
---
Yea, no problem on my end. Full greens. I do think early game warrior is one of the easiest. Solo'd hogger no problem. 
---
tho obviously its nothing compared to a hunter that can kill 5 lvls above him
---
And this is why the majority of rogues are KOS for me.
---
Are there none on your AH? I sold one for 30 but it can vary a lot from server to server. If there aren't any on the auction you could take it as an opportunity to "reset" the price to something higher.
---
Even if you don't get into a specific spell cleave group most mages I group with still try to AoE spam the entire dungeon. 
---
Joined a ZF group last night as DPS. I'm shadow and super excited to be running as DPS for once, but oh no, they see I'm a priest and they kick the other healer without warning invite a mage and only then do they ask if I'm cool with healing. Whatever, I've healed every other dungeon, what's one more? 
---
The dungeon goes fairly smoothly even though the tank is using ravager the whole time meaning I'm drinking after every pull. But oh boy when we got to the temple event... this mage tried and failed to AoE spam them all at once three separate times blaming our group for his inability to kite properly and wasting everyone's time. 
---
If we just did the event as intended we would've finished 45 minutes sooner, but nope his stubborn ass just had to keep trying the AoE pull.
---
Level 55, about 250g
---
Pre lvl 40, I made a living selling Swiftness potions and Savory Deviate Delight. Had 90g+ at lvl 40. Haven't had a steady income since hitting level 40, but made a few gold "here and there", selling Goblin Rocket Fuel and Invisibility potions to mention some. Found Taran Icebreaker, that I have yet to sell. Other than that, haven't really found any items worth selling on the AH.
---
What bow is that?
---
Just switched to ele myself post lvl 40 and it's a definite improvement. If you're at 37 now, start hoarding int gear, ele shamans are thirsty bois.
---
I made macros for myself to do most of what you asked for. I don't think you can do the cooldown part with a macro, but otherwise these should get the job done. Hope this helps you out!
---
Safe to spam shapeshift: 
---
`#showtooltip
---
/cancelform [nostance:1][mod:ctrl]
---
/dismount [mounted]
---
/use [nostance:1] Bear Form`
---
This macro will shapeshift you into a form and will never take you out. You can hold down ctrl for a powershift into the same form. For a cat version replace Bear with Cat and change the number 1 to 3. 
---
Unshift and cast a spell: 
---
/cancelform [nostance:0]
---
/cast Healing Touch`
---
This one will return you to elf/tauren from any shapeshift form and will begin casting, in this case Healing Touch. You can replace the name of the spell at the end to Regrowth, Rejuvenate or whatever you want.
---
If you are pick pocketing you need to kill easy bosses with high profit items.
---
May I recommend a feral cat bear druid? I dont know how meta it is for classic, but it's really really fun and combines both of your interests and has even more utility. 
---
Most will tell you cats are not good, but most cat mains will tell you it just takes more effort to get similar result. I like the skill cap because it feels rewarding.
---
Honestly I kinda wish I did. I didn’t expect the pot to blow up.
---
Yah. My guild has the opposite luck. 5/5 on eye drops. Us hunters in the guild are pulling our hair out without there being any leaf drops. Grats on the drop!
---
I'm confused. What's wrong with these people?
---
My understanding is that it's not even very powerful until the 30s/40s when you can max out both Piercing Ice and Shatter, plus it's important to have enough INT to not oom yourself, and enough stam to not die before gathering all the mobs up. 
---
Not to say people can't do it, but there's so much working against you, and it makes you that much weaker for regular questing and single target/dungeons.
---
I'm just into revered, nowhere near exalted. And I don't believe it has anything to do with it. The stars just have to align :)
---
Udkillerxxx has an uncle who works at Blizzard.
---
Both. Your utility and diversity is desired. You'll switch between both roles in a single raid oftentimes.
---
I'm seeing a curious amount of druids with +3 spirit enchant on their warden staff &gt;.&gt;
---
Biggest reason I don't bother is because there's no reward/consequences for it. If players dropped a portion of their gold I'd be all over it gimme gimme
---
What sort of skills have you skipped so far? I’ve read about skipping some skills to help afford a mount at 40 but I’m new to the priest class and first time back to wow since The Burning Crusade.
---
It might be better in the sense you're not going to get your 1h weps that you need due to the competition. If i had to choose between using OEB and using random ST 1hers I'd probably go with OEB.
---
Nah but I’d guess somewhere from 5,000-10,000 worldwide...so 1-2 a day
---
Are you in raid?
---
Did I hit a nerve or why do you sound so butthurt and have to make it personal?
---
Honestly I have no idea.
---
I'm a holy pally and I'm going to level a mage alt. I played a mage through naxx on a private server, so its something I know I want to do already.
---
I don't know why spending money on entertainment is confusing to you. Does someone follow you into mc donalds and tell you that you could cook your own burger and food at home for half the cost, and 5 times better quality?  
---
It's just money, some people have more than others, and some spend it differently than you. It's weird.
---
Just a minor quibble, DS\Ruin is better for a lot of the high end content. There's only 16 debuff slots, and you can't have warlocks taking all of them up with DoTs, so a lot of Affliction is useless relative to Demonic Embrace, Improved Healthstone, and having the ability to instant-summon VW and sacrifice (the VW ability, not the talent sacrifice). It'll depend on the raid group, though.
---
I also think this is more about leveling instances rather than end game.
---
Nothing wrong with that. It’s a PvP environment.
---
How are we all going to get to the raid dungeon without warlocks. Surely you don’t mean to imply walking?
---
-Herod.... must’ve been a warrior
---
If you are thinking of rolling a druid, roll one - you wont regret it. Classic is my 5th druid and i have no idea why more of these aren't played as they offer so much variety of playstyle and something for everyone.
---
Almost every group i have been in has said they prefer bear tanks in dungeons over warriors, in raids you will be able to fill any spot aside from MT as 0-30-21, they are fun with a high skill ceiling in PVP, and they are great to level.
---
Had a Rogue follow me like this once, when I was in my mid 40's as a Arms Warr. I purposely was doing a side strafe and right about as he realized what I was doing he dodged a hamstring attack proc'ing my Overpower, I critted him for damn near half his health, he paniced blinded me and ran off vanishing. Best part was he aggro'd a basilisk, as this was out in Tanaris and it took him out of stealth. I charged him rended him, disarmed him and with in two hits executed him. Difference between me and you...I moved on and didn't camp him as I like my PvP fights at full health not when I've alrdy killed you and know your gonna be low on health but maybe its just the Alliance scum in me that likes a good PvP fight.
---
Big negative - have to be in raid for that to work huh?
---
Sounds like a good thing to me
---
Say NO to typing and riding.
---
Thanks man! Shadowed Unit Frames for the character target frames and Dominos for the actionbars :)
---
They’re of equivalent value actually.
---
That's why I as a warlock, an at your services to eye pull safely. PST - sulfuras.
---
I see you haven’t even touched legion
---
This, but macro it to say "wtf noob healer"
---
The one that increases the mana pool will be the one that sells the most.
---
Maraudon
---
Ayyye &lt;Free Folk&gt;! Best guild ever!
---
Bigglesworth was rough at first but has turned into an amazing server.
---
Neither are considered super high difficulty cap. I'd say both are rated moderate.
---
Of the two, from a pvp perspective, rogue is usually more fun from what I've heard.
---
Yeah. "Peaceful class" my ass. I've had more druids ganking me than rogues
---
Are you a tank? Fire resist is only really "needed" for tanks on ragnaros; it's good for dps on ragnaros as well but you can get away with a couple fire protection pots.
---
Had a rogue roll on a 2 hand sword on my run when I ran bfd. We both opened tickets and they won't do anything
---
I guess I didn't realize that Bear Form was so useful for PvP. Would it be reasonable to (or even optimal) to spend most of time in PvP switching between caster and Bear Form?
---
Not the same place. This is up the river separating Ashenvale and Azshara.
---
I'm kinda scared to run Strat now
---
Too bad he doesn’t know the difference between an average and a median
---
No, he was running from a pack of razormane things and I healed him while we ran away.
---
Yeah, no. not with 1.12 itemization. Classic is way easier than vanilla was
---
I didn’t roll a rogue to fight fair.
---
If you want an easy leveling experience and tanking in five mans have you considered a druid?
---
You can use distract without stealthing! :)
---
Really? I should’ve known
---
Tempting
---
Alive yes but I wouldn’t say he’s doing well.
---
I ran my first MC last week and made 400 water and 200 food for everyone before I got there. Arrived and everyone already had some :(
---
As a pug healer, I’ll tell you how it goes...oom.  Pretty damn quickly. 
---
It’s a shit way to tank and the rest of us pay for it, esp when there’s no mage and I’m drinking water I have to buy.
---
Tell that to me back in Cata farming it non-stop like a madman :(
---
Im not 100% sure but i think that you need to be.
---
I hope you don't plan to write a fucking novel every time you win a wpvp encounter.  
---
Subreddit's been full of this lately. It's nothing special, it's nothing entertaining, share this shit with your friends, not here.
---
I don't get all the hate for OP in here... Sure, the sueing part is ridiculous, we all get that. But still, he does have a point.
---
I personally don't care about names, and you can ignore people that spam /s or /y, but people actively disrupting RP events by jumping around, spamming emotes, spells, etc.? That is being a grade A asshole and it affects RP tremendously, as you can't do anything about it. 
---
/ignore should just turn the ignored players completely invisible for you or something...
---
Some people are just awkward, especially the sorts of people who spend too much time playing MMO's. I never read too much into that sort of thing because I've probably made some boneheaded moves that I didn't even realize.

My usual strategy is to invite people who look like they are on the same quest I am on unless I already have a party of five.  Afew times these have evolved into dungeon groups and we did a dungeon or two. That's how you meet people. Some people are fucking cruel when you offer to invite them and party up though and I don't get it... it's a cooperative MMO game. You don't get a big dick merit badge for soloing up to 60 on quests with no help, matter of fact doing that (while possible) is boring, not fun, and far more difficult than it needs to be.
---
Ahh, gotcha thank you. I was debating druid as an alt but as someone without that much time I don't think I wanna be farming Gnomer.
---
I've dropped pretty substantially after a few fights where I either pulled aggro, or got lucky on Nightfall procs and threw out a bunch of extra insta-shadowbolts, but I can usually go through an entire instance while leveling only needing to drink/bandage once or twice on trash.
---
Usually bosses, I'll sit and Shadowbolt spam, though, and that shit drains me.
---
If this is how you plan on getting honor, I don't think it is gonna be very impact.
---
There were a lot that were not linear though...those ...mercy.
---
A single target mage?
---
At this time of year?
---
At this time of day?
---
In this part of the continent?
---
LOCALIZED entirely within this zone?
---
I think you dropped this \
---
You can stop the procs by right clicking the buff in the top corner. The proc actually increases its dps as well as making it hit multiple mobs and so it's more viable than ww even against solo mobs.
---
How'd you manage to fuck that up? All you had to do was read.
---
Hey, just so you know, you didn't actually respond to a comment :)
---
It's like 217k out of 1.5 million xp, not a full level.
---
Can't spec in Arms for PvE raiding.  Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot on the target.  Would have loved to try Sword Spec (SS) though.  SS + HoJ + WF = lot of potential that could get you killed.
---
I was farming 50k/hr in SM cath, and ZF and up was 70-80k minimum. Those numbers are common with 3 mage groups.
---
You obviously havent been in any spellcleave groups
---
I would suggest holy paladin. You get some flexibility in how you spec for pve so you can probably get your required pvp talents without having an angry raid leader. You’ll be in high demand for both pve and pvp
---
Fucking tell them
---
Oh jeez
---
Not saying it's bad to use life tap, but life tapping instead of drinking in between pulls, or life tapping to consistently stay above 80% mana and below 50% health, sucks for the healer. If you are communicating with the healer, sure, but this healer had to keep repeating "please stay at least above 30% health"
---
I'm in this comment and I don't like it.
---
Also, there would be more of us but we're either dead or in a dungeon (or dead while corpse running to a dungeon)
---
On my server I auction both of those things. Not a huge profit but worthwhile. Sry, I dont know any addons that does that, though.
---
You could also try out druid. Honestly, they are the better mid-tier tank option. You get superior 2-3 target cleave when compared to warriors, so in dungeons I'd rate the tanks as Paladin&gt;Druid&gt;Warrior. Of course, a lot of people are looking to AoE grind dungeons but I'm not factoring that in since a lot of those groups don't even want a tank.
---
Druid leveling is definitely going to be easier compared to warrior. You can spec cat and only be a few talents off from an optimal bear spec, plus you can drop form to heal yourself as required.
---
If you purely want to pick between those three classes, I'd go warrior unless you want to become a full-time healer. Paladin has a smoother leveling experience (but arguably more passive than hunter) but Ret is a poor man's Arms warrior, so you just end up healing. They are very good single target healers but really that just means spamming the same heal over and over again.
---
I wouldn't shy away from trying other classes just because you have a few at 20. The time required to get to 20 pales in comparison to the time required to get to 60 (44 is roughly the mathematical halfway point to 60, when you factor in experience gains and experience required per level). It's better to figure out something you really like now instead of when you are 4 days of /played into a character. That being said, a lot of classes start to feel better around level 40. Warrior, for instance, gets Mortal Strike and becomes much more fluid for leveling (although still a rough solo class).
---
Yeah, it is a hassle, but still druid is fun.
---
Still doesn't make Kodos cooler than Thunder Lizards, thus I keep my opinion.
---
Sell those two items in the neutral auction houses
---
Not in a way you've interacted with oyur uncle
---
You’re calling me a retard but you’re named after catgirl butts. You alright?
---
We're also friends irl, but yeah you should offer at cost pricing or discounts to guildmates, it makes the guild as a whole better and more alluring come raid time. Im not asking him to give it to me for free, but asking 400g for a 500g item is hardly taking advantage of him and his "epic mount fund" as a warlock mind you.
---
Find a guild and buddy up to a healer. If it’s a decent guild, you should have no problem finding someone to help you.
---
There is no way to catweave because of how expensive it is to shift forms in Classic. If your tank barely needs healing then you can spend a bunch of time in cat form but shifting back and forth during combat will never be a reality.
---
cool youre an internet badass who is godly at everything they do, doesn't mean the majority of the population playing the game is
---
Lol yeah starting banking int gear at 36, I think I'm gonna go for it.
---
I thought about that too. But why not just say “oh I’m graveporting. Ty tho”?  That’s what I do.
---
If you aren't fishing anything in particular, the tanaris coast is generally the best. Lots of stonescale eel, oily blackmouth, and firefin snapper. Plus junk pools with vendor loot and gold.
---
Firefin snapper is worth peanuts at the moment, but hold onto it as a long term investment. It will get WAY more expensive once AQ40 gets close. Easily 10x the current value, if not more.
---
I'd want to make a rogue specifically for this. Can distract be resisted?
---
It is great when it is criticism and pointers and not someone laying on the abuse even after someone takes the criticism to heart and admits fault. Too many toxic assholes in this game. Luckily I can kick them a lot of the time since I have a warrior I tank with sometimes.
---
Its probably the lack of diagrams that makes it hard to be clear, but let's see if I have it right if I have a tank beating the snot out of something, and I'm in melee I have to have 110% of threat to pull, now if the aggro Target is not in melee and I am, do I have to have 110% to pull off the nonnmelee aggro Target?
---
That editing is perfect!
---
How did you have the gold for an epic mount upon hitting 60?
---
Tell me that you love me more.
---
The biggest difference between the two is in PvP and tank role. If you want the option of tanking, you obviously know that you need to pick warrior. In PvP, I'd rate rogue as a far better 1v1 or solo BG character (once BGs come out) but warriors are absolutely top tier once they get excellent gear and have a pocket healer. But without both of those things, warriors can get pretty dicked over in PvP.
---
Leveling wise, rogue is slightly less of a pain in the ass than warrior because you get more tools to skip mobs or deal with adds/large pulls. Both are probably the worst two leveling experiences in the game though, so it's really not a big enough issue to consider imo.
---
So I guess it comes down to whether or not you want the beefiness of a warrior or the tools of a rogue. Both do great melee dps in the end game but rogues are always going to be squishy (for a melee). Rogues stun lock and burst during stun lock and warriors just get up in your face and swing meaty crits at you while you bleed.
---
Exactly, that's why I backed up on the term BoA and thought of something else.  The fact that we have unwritten rules in WoW sometimes baffles me.  Some make sense, others not so much.
---
For example, if I agree to switch to my Tank so your group goes when my main is a Hunter, and the item I wanted comes up, I sure as shit will roll for it because this tank character only is used when others need me.
---
But I am referring strictly to things like the mount.  Not gear.  Things that have no true value to our characters other than a cooler looking mount.  I personally would hate passing on the roll.  It would drive me nuts because I know I would never see it again most likely.  But I would have to pass if it just doesn't look quite right with my character being a Hunter, for example.  I guess more power to the others.
---
UD has always been the abbreviation.
---
Thx =)
---
Probably better to ask on their personal Reddit or discord
---
Exactly this
---
Of course it is a priest named candystore doing the sniffing.
---
This is mostly because you've got a healer who knows how to heal correctly and a tank who knows how fast he can pull.  
---
If your healing is constantly topping off everything then he's going to be oom fast.  If he waits until the tank is at around 50% then burst heals to full and then waits for the 5second rule (if a shaman) to get mana back you'll notice him not going oom as much.
---
Tbh, while leveling, enh shaman with decent gear do great dmg. I was often in the top.
---
it's ok. These brain-dead mages are unlikely to make it to 60 before BWL and if they do they aren't going to get into raids
---
&gt;But they often have a leveling guide to do super min maxing efficiency leveling!
---
Those guides are the sort of thing where if you pull one too many things, or they hit you for slightly more damage than you can handle, it's all over very quickly.
---
The long leveling process is when you meet people, get to know your server and it's guilds, get to know your class and abilities, learn how to make gold, make social connections, and so on. Getting to 60 is fantastic, but you aren't getting into a raid unless you know the right people. If your goal is to get in by "being good at your class," well good freakin' luck, because classic WoW theorycraft is a known quantity and there are going to be hard limits on what even the best can accomplish.
---
That's rough.  I don't know why but mages seem really high strung.  And paladin gearing is rough even without the drama.  As a tank they still need a fair amount of int to have the mana to keep aggro, but they also need more conventional stats to actually survive.  It's a bit of a mess, really.
---
Wool cloth x2 lol
---
How much worse is Arms in PVE content compared to fury? 
---
Would be nice to stay arms for the PVP potential, even in raids.
---
Yeah the idea of being able to dps and heal with one spec while leveling is definitely attractive. I'll have to look up your build, thanks!
---
Well where a druid shines is stopping caps and running flags.
---
You'll be switching from caster to bear a lot.
---
It’s also a deterrent often times. I’ve been running around with it off and saw some alliance decide to come toward me, but bolt away as soon as I kick on shadowform.
---
Because you're literally handicapping yourself for no reason. Unless some medical impairment prevents you from doing so, turning with a mouse is objectively better.
---
Every man for himself when it comes to upgrades unless you’re guildies lmao
---
Probably meant RFK
---
Oh wait...is this not the appropriate response...
---
Had a party leader in ZF pick a fight with literally everyone in the group one after another. Two dps got kicked at two different points of the instance. It was eventually my turn and I completely ignored him. He sent 5-6 hostiles messages and I just.. kept playing. When he gave up I instantly said something that was completely unrelated just to show that I wasn't silent, I was just not having any of that shit lol
---
That dude's body language says it all.
---
Yeah, on alliance side theres a quest where you have to go collect some stuff from the ruins in Searing Gorge then you get a quest to go into BRD
---
Warlock SM/Ruin for both PvE/PvP
---
No. People just want a server where they can keep playing Vanilla as long as they wish, without changes. Period.
---
If you want progression, that's fine, but if it evolves beyond TBC or Wrath it's just pointless. 
---
I don't want QoL changes and no new stuff. Unless they make separate servers for Classic+.
---
I have been trying to get someone to notice me doing this for like a week and no one will even stop and look at me lol.
---
About to get Shadow form on my Priest. How does it affect leveling speed? Is it much faster?
---
Dont dual wield tank before raidgear.
---
Anal Spellcleave
---
Agree with all this.  I did it a little different — I found the trolls in STV to be extremely difficult for a couple of reasons: 1) they were a bit higher than I was at the time (which you mentioned) 2) there were so many people farming them for different reasons 3) there were so many opposing faction players there destroying me for tagging mobs.  Because of this, I recruited a 60 warr guildie who just came and mopped the floor with the whole place.  I know there was a lot of REEEE in the ally general.  I used AH for the charms and then just spammed Alterac/Hillsbrad general for help with Cyclonian.  Having a higher level person with you just makes it a lot smoother farming tusks.
---
You use dual wield to kill mobs but use sword and shield, sunder, go back to battle stance etc. I also recommend tanking dungeons and going protection talents so you can just grind dungeons and when you quest have more survivability
---
this is dope and its cool with big numbers, but i still have laintime as my most enjoyable warrior pvp video to watch
---
Well if my sideways answer invalidates his main reason for switching does that help or make it worse?
---
Ha genius.. too bad devilsaur is hideous looking armor on me
---
I didn't even notice that. HAHAHAHAHA
---
But none of them as good as smoking
---
Is a skinning knife required for a druid to skin in form? If so, how are they holding it?
---
I found an online tool just like wowclassicbis.com but it saved ur profile and could check every lvl. Not just 60. It was named something quite long/silly. I've googled but cant find it at all. Anyone knows which one I'm talking about?
---
Troll shaman, lvl 9
---
well atleast you dont have to deal with this shit later on. So one more idiot less to heal :)
---
Yea, I'll make'm back easily.
---
Moreso than a wolf for PVP, at least, because even if you're getting a 1.2 wolf it only knows bite. That alone isn't effective focus dump which is why cats are better, also having claw, and of course BT has both 1.0 and is a cat making him the champ. 
---
Again, it's minor, but if you're already making the effort to go 1.2 and howl I personally would just have both and lose the "solo" pet, at which a cat would do fine.
---
Reminds me of the time I was skinning and killing mobs next do a warrior. He stopped looting his kills all the way so I whispered him if he would mind looting them so I can skin and his response
---
"Fuck you"
---
Started ignoring me lol why are people like this
---
Azshara is probably the most poorly designed zone in the game, and that river between Ashenvale/Azshara at Org W exit should have a sign saying "No Entry". Can't change my mind.
---
Back in Vanilla, we downed Jeklik, and the Animist's Spaulders dropped, which were pretty rare. They were 1 of 2 items left in ZG I wanted on my druid (Will of Arlokk, for the looks), and I got them... and a few minutes later there was a massive outage in the USA and WoW went down completely. The shoulders were gone, and the boss was dead, and no body.
---
I opened a ticket, and the GM said "Sorry, can't help." I was crushed.
---
A week later, I get them delivered as a letter - one of the friends of the guild that filled in also made a ticket, and somehow convinced the GM to fix it.
---
So there's always hope.
---
Beetlejuice
---
Nobody cares about your opinion. People who do some groups will continue to do so. Why? Because in an MMO they can do whatever they wish. They won't listen to some boomer crying about it.
---
WoW Fans: Want WoW Classic
---
Also WoW Fans: WoW Classic Sucks! Balance your game!
---
Everyone else: Wait, what?
---
That’s the level where it actually gets good, but it is possible to do at a lower level if you fancy trying it out, even if it’s not the best idea for efficiency. What I was getting at is that as a general rule playing based on the principle “my goal is never to get hit” is not necessary for a warlock, unlike other clothies
---
I'd rather have you than a overconfident asshole :p
---
100% paladin if you plan to focus PvP. Priest is the best all-around healer in the game but paladin takes the title for PvP healer since you have more tools to survive the focus that will 100% come your way. Even just being able to wear a shield helps a ton versus rogue ganks and it gets even better if you can get some good healing plate gear (although at first your paladin will likely be healing in mostly cloth since there's a lot better healing cloth than mail/plate at first).
---
And paladin is still really good for PvE healing, they are just a little less dynamic than a priest.
---
Legit what taunt and growl do.
---
It's a "my dps was a fucktard" button.
---
One sacrifice... and several Forsaken-in-training.
---
Right?  It's pretty much considered BIS for every melee class.
---
Very viable, the meta pvp build is 32/19/0.
---
\*snicker snicker\*
---
Have you tried Alt+F4
---
\*giggle\*
---
Hitting 40 was awesome for me too, as a warrior. I waited to Respec until 40, so now my talent build is optimal with mortal strike, and I can burn through mobs like a true warrior should. Got my mount at 41, and it makes the game much more enjoyable. Not that I wasn’t already enjoying it.
---
Angry shaman
---
Does feel like coming home
---
usually happens to new ppl like me who doesnt know what they're doing lol
---
There was a level 60 Alliance Priest all the way up at the Horde village in Thousand Needles MCing people off at the elevators.
---
Killed me once, the second time I luckily found out that MC gets broken by Will of the Forsaken...
---
Amazing QoL shit Undeads have, damn.
---
Burn it
---
It was, but there was 'more to the map' than there is now. It's surmised that AQ was going to be like The Tainted Scar with either the 'dungeon [raid] entrance' deep behind enemy (elite) lines.
---
Originally, there the flight paths were at the 'base camp' you get sent to (that gives the quest to investigate Southwind Village); Cenarion Hold hadn't been "built" until nearer the AQ War event.
---
That's also when the rest of the quests were added. So we have (I think) pre-1.8 questing but post-1.8 map. It's just a shame a bit of history was lost.
---
WC you have to go all the way one way, backtrack, go all the way the other way, backtrack again to the entrance, talk to the guy, and complete his escort event to get to the final boss. And there is nothing that indicates this unless you talked to him initially and actually read what he has to say from the start. Anyone who didn't read that probably just assumed the giant swamp beast after the 4th leader of the fang was the end boss.
---
therealz1ggy has died
---
rip
---
he was ganked mid thought
---
Many items that aren’t tied directly to quests released in phase 2 (I think there’s a few class quests that will release in p2) or p2 only areas (like DM) are all released.
---
This is why some recipes and MC loot that came in 1.3-1.5 are already out.
---
That's why I always watch people die because people always watch me die
---
It's a viscous cycle
---
I saw it and was like "oh the puns!" XD
---
That was already mentioned. Thanks for parroting the exact comment that was already made. Bit of a woosh there huh?
---
&gt;life tapping to consistently stay above 80% mana and below 50% health
---
I would bet any amount you're lying/exaggerating. Be nice instead ❤
---
Haha I knew someone would bring that up. I shouldn't assume WoW players get enough sleep
---
So was it discussed briefly right before the roll only, or was it discussed the day before?  
---
If the latter, then unfortunately during the roll isn’t the right time to dispute rules.
---
As their bags gently stroke your face, remember, you won!
---
What a nice guy
---
Ya that's a good description of what's going on. The software is actually playing those characters.
---
Key to making it manageable is to 2 LB + flame shock before finishing off with melee. Try to keep your casting in a burst and then let your mana regen during the rest of the fight. Shocks being spammed keeps your mana regen off the entire time.
---
I hope I don’t have to be heal a bunch
---
I’ve always played ele in retail . Now lvl 44 in classic and enjoying enhancement
---
You have great aoe burst every 30 seconds....your sustained dps though...not good
---
lol moons
---
Assuming I have at least one other melee in the group, and we’re missing a shaman: my healer rankings go like this, from most desired to least:
---
Resto Shaman
---
Either healing spec priest
---
DPS shaman in full healing gear
---
Resto Druid
---
DPS shaman in meh healing gear
---
DPS priest
---
DPS druid
---
It’s not that I think Druids are weak healers, it’s that I really want Windfury and the ability to rez people if needed.
---
Youre.my kind of stuff bor
---
No there is a view distance in Classic, it's the same engine. They probably have it set down.
---
I have such a hard time getting groups for RFD. Definitely recommend advertising this quest if you ever have a problem getting one together. Nothing like the promise of a blue to get people to make the trip (Alliance)
---
Hahaha, wow what an escape. Y'all got bamboozled.
---
Gnomes have by far the best pvp racial out of any race. 
---
After that stun resis/war stomp/fear and charm purge, but escape artist is just too good. 
---
Also paladins FTW
---
How hard is it to shield someone by the time you say "go"?
---
Thats unfortunate -- 
---
But is that even with the 30% mana reduction from the balance tree?
---
I know at endgame this probably wont be accepted but -- is there a way to move the points you would have into Cat talents vs Bear talents so you can heal endgame, but your day to day doesn't absolutely blow?
---
I tend to shift/dps while healing in three situations; 
---
* to Bear; when that pat comes in and I want to give my DPS that last 5-10 seconds to finish the first group
---
* to Cat; when the group is topped off and the second to last guy is &lt;25% health/help burn the last guy.
---
* to Cat; when I know I can stay there for more than 5-8 seconds (enough to recoup my shifting cost)
---
Its alot slower healing in Classic -- the pace, the shifting, the general gameplay as a Resto is just slower in Classic. Healing Heroic EP vs Healing a Classic SM is like 1/20th of the effort.
---
You're saying two people can skill up off one node?
---
Quite a bit actually.
---
ELO isn't even in the same ballpark as an EVE capital ship.
---
I think that’s only normal WoW
---
I don’t think the shield talents would be that helpful for pvp. You’re more concerned with magic damage or physical damage when you’re stunned or from behind.
---
Why is being a "spell cleave nerd" inherently bad? For my 2nd 60 I levelled mage with 4 other guildies who were levelling 2nd toons too (2 mages, lock, priest, warrior) mostly thru dungeons and it was way faster in time played than questing on my druid main. Now all of us have farming alts or raid mains with much less effort than our first toons
---
you can shift out at the end of the hibernate cast and they just wasted a few seconds casting lmao
---
Fake news he didn't G kick him.
---
ok dude
---
Where do sign up?
---
Stockholm syndrome
---
I dont get how people can do nothing but aoe grind until 60. I'd blow my head off
---
&gt;most show up and say "group" kill the monster or whatever get item then degroup which i like.
---
Yep, this is basically what I do. I actually enjoy the interaction with people. It's kinda the point of the game I thought, but maybe that's just me.
---
Welcome to Herod
---
I believe you're correct I'm the person you speak to the escalated complaints at my place of employment and chances are the people OP were speaking to deal with dozens of complaints of this nature a day where the complainant is lying and they don't have access to the complete details of the case to resolve the complex issue even though the OP laid out the issue on front of the previous people. It sucks but we'd have given you a Visa gift card at least for the inconvenience lol
---
I don't play WoW private servers. They're tuned totally wrong and I never enjoyed them.
---
I was doing wailing caverns this morning.  I am a lvl 20 Fury warrior that was tanking the dungeon.  The Living Root staff drops and I needed on it.  It is a 21 dps weapon with Spirit and Stam.  My current weapon had 13.5 dps.  I won the roll and was shamed by my group.  
---
To buy a similar weapon from the AH would cost around 6 gold for 1dps lower.
---
Was I wrong here?

I just checked and it says I have one. Click the shop on the character screen.

It's really not as dire as you think. So she's immune to lightning and earth shock. That leaves fire damage wide open, as well as physical damage granted from rockbiter or windfury.

---
I put a group together for SM armory recently and had a mage join who I could tell didn't speak English well, that's okay. We get going and then he starts going "pull more."
---
"Bigger pulls."
---
"Faster."
---
Then he takes it upon himself to do the pulls because he wanted to do spellcleave even though I made no mention of that when putting the group together. So he starts making giant pulls and when the warrior, who is the lowest level in the group, can't grab all the aggro - he's yelling "TANK" "TANK "aGGRO". 
---
Then he calls the tank a noob. I told him to stop pulling before we're ready.
---
Next pull does it again. "Tank noob." Booted right then and there. Not in my fucking group. Not tolerating utter bullshit where you can't just sit back and play and MUST spellcleave even though it wasn't discussed prior. Why people insist on being assholes is beyond me.
---
Gotcha
---
To jump on this comment, is there a hybrid build for healing/soloing, or do I have to go almost all in for resto?
---
I have to admit classic has given me a really negative impression of mages when vanilla didn't.  Not sure why it is so different this time.  Mages seem a bit entitled and over half of the dungeon groups seem very unwelcoming for dps other than a mage.
---
I can see this happening in DM/WC/RFC, but by ZF you'd think they've learned their lesson by then...
---
That one blows my mind even more, I've seen it too. I've joined groups where its 2 warriors and they're looking for a tank for upwards of an hour. Even if tanking isn't the most exciting, surely *running the dungeon* is more fun than standing around and spamming Trade for that long.
---
Ooo, that sounds really cool! What's the name of the addon?
---
I'm 51 right now, what do you think? I just linked it better
---
Are there any other of those images for other classes?
---
raiders have already learnt to jump :D
---
Its funny how many people don't know about hunter deadzoning. As a frost mage, I make hunters look real useless.
---
Yeh, I like that too, bonus if we get chatting a tiny bit. I can honestly say the vast, vast majority of interactions have been positive for me, the one above was definitely the exception to the rule.
---
Haha
---
I started out as a lock because they seemed fun and then felt a calling for a warrior. Not because they are OP but just because I like a warrior. I'm level 25 and I'm having the time of my life.
---
If you really are not enjoying it then reroll. Seriously just because something is powerfull does not mean you will like it or that you HAVE to like it.

Remember that this is a game, if you are torturing yourself then you arenot having fun, the goal of a game.

Nope. Ranged DPS
---
There is no directory folder. "Warcraft\_classic_\" IS the directory.
---
No Agi until phase 3, unfortunately. Also, counterweight is better when you can get it.
---
Good exp tho
---
They vendor them for mount gold
---
Probably so they don’t see any loot you get. Say there’s an epic BOE in there. If they loot out of group you won’t see it. If they loot in group you’ll see them loot the BOE.

The wounds are still fredh
---
Watch youtube runs imo
---
Can you transfer from PVE to PVP servers? That would be kinda OP
---
Why do people ask "LF 1 Melee dps" when really they mean rogues only?  I'm level 60 and have been allowed to dps as a warrior just once.  I have tanked every dungeon in the game at least once at this point
---
My only guess is it's tanks afraid of competing with another warrior for loot, even though every other class in the game has to deal with that.  Or they all just mistakenly assume warrior dps is bad because it's the tank class.
---
Enjoy every part of it. The good and bad. Also the OH MY GOD they disenchanted a shoulder i wanted.
---
That was a meme.
---
I wish that were true - Those greasy bastards pop evasion and you can't touch them. Plus they always initiate the fight when I am at like 40% HP.  Granted I get them to 20% in that time but damn them!!!! Haha!
---
Lvl 55 warrior...feel the same. Cant do it again though.  No way.
---
&gt; You're the one going off on a tangent about who you think is a good and bad player.
---
I actually asked you what you think differentiates good players from bad ones if not using your class abilities to their maximum.
---
&gt;  Even though I was the one saying that it becomes useful by the time you are running BRD.
---
Knowing that it can be used when you're talking to random people on the internet is not the same as using it without thinking during combat. Curse of Recklessness is also just an example of an ability that that is situational and people might not train. There are others.
---
&gt; But I wouldn't know any of that since apparently everyone is like you and needs their entire leveling process to learn how to use a spell effectively. 
---
You still don't get it and I doubt anything I say will help.
---
Mind Blast, Power Word Shield &amp; Fortitude, Inner Fire, and Shadow Word Pain are always trained. Healing spells should be taken to for group/dungeons. I held on Prayer of Healing, but ended up buying it since I do still heal dungeons). Train Fade as you see fit, I personally took all ranks, but you can probably hold back depending on how much you dungeon. 
---
Didn't learn Resurrection after Rank 1.
---
Skipped Shadow Protection, Mind Vision, Mana Burn, Levitate, and Mind Soothe (this can be taken if you like, it is actually helpful when you're in cramped areas with lots of Humanoids).
---
I won't bother with Smite anymore, I probably didn't need to learn Rank 5, but oh well.  I definitely wont buy Rank 6.
---
After I get my mount, I will go back and start learning everything as I have the gold.
---
Made me remember the episode where homer designs a car and he's lost brother company goes bankrupt.
---
Use it for a keybind?
---
Alliancebrain
---
Those rares and epics don't generate more gold for the economy. It's the vendor cloth, greys, greens, quest rewards etc that add gold to the pool and lower the value of it making prices rise.
---
If it helps I'm  in the same position, I love the enhancement playstyle come PvP but ele is fundementally more reliable, sticking with enhancement though I think, comes down to I have always loved melee centric style that can use long/mid range, rather than long/mid range who's melee is eh
---
Don’t trust the mages in that guild. That’s not water they’re conjuring.
---
Linked it properly.
---
exactamundo. I make as much use as possible of auto walk.
---
You forgot the part where he provided an accurate and verifiable explanation for the imbalanced trades to the 3 prior GMs, and they failed to even address it, simply saying "there are reasons for your ban and we can't tell you what they are."
---
Also you are a warlock, so you get a free mount; don't look a literal gift horse in the mouth and shell out 90g take your cool free flaming horse and don't worry about it.
---
Queues are non existent at this point. Server crashing is gone and done. Grasping at the past as it's defining the server.
---
Yea you done goofed son, have fun starting from nothing on a new server
---
It’s for a quest. 0/8 diseased wolfs need to kill. Only like 8 individual spawn spots in the area.
---
Just move on, nothing worse than same faction dicking on each other.
---
Now, as a priest, I do enjoy mind controlling a mage trying to AOE grind :)
---
I think the cost of master shapeshifter (5 tier 1 points + 3 to max the ability) of 8 total is really what kills the viability of Catweaving. 8 points to save 30% mana is a trade off, but one you can get more value for those same 8 points elsewhere. 
---
welp, thats disappointing. LOVE Catweaving.
---
Yes true... what is this about Curse of Reck? Does it prevent enemies from running? I haven't even bothered to add it to my keybinds haha
---
This kind of shit is a hunter's worst nightmare. Sorry you are having to deal with this.
---
I've had a hard time finding groups as a 60 Resto Shaman. Lots of healer competition on my server. I can imagine things are even harder as a Druid since you don't have totems or even a regular rez.
---
Things did get better as I grouped more and people started to recognize me.
---
Just gotta be careful. OSRS fell in to QoL being big upgrades and buffs and not just simple QoL with some things. Last months QoL month was mostly just straight item/xp buffs and even polled adding a new item. That shit was confusing.
---
Overall I'd love some QoL changes. Maybe a set of LFG channels for the dungeon your looking for. So like...sub channels of LFG chat.
---
I go out of my way to be nice/polite to people in WoW. I’ll never understand people who behave like this
---
I’m not sure I’m already in a pvp server. I don’t see why not considering it’s just 1 you get free. All the rest are paid.
---
"I want the full vanilla feeling"
---
They aren’t trying to avoid drama, they’re straight up ninjaing the chest and making sure the others don’t know what loot was in the chest.
---
Wow, people are downvoting this like crazy, lol
---
Not only that, but he's running back to his body. Clearly the run went south and they all thought he was at fault.
---
sm ruin is pretty bad sustain for grinding.  You dont even use ruin on any spells you are regularly casting.
---
Despite that, I find myself with some severed head or another in my bags an awful lot more than I'm comfortable admitting.
---
Yup, he said i "can stick that wand right up my ass" and he even had the gaul to tell his guildies to harrass me lol
---
Obviously not, otherwise the words 
---
&gt;UTILITY 55+ REQUIRED SoL!
---
Would instill PTSD flashbacks.
---
Maybe even more sense it's on alliance. Looks exactly like Undead Epic Mount.
---
I think "below 1%" is an understatement. It's so rare that it is legit not worth farming. Servers were lucky to have a single drop by the end of vanilla. God forbid that drop go to an undead character.
---
All depends on whether the DPS is retailing it up and going full blast from the start, or if the tank is just losing stuff mid fight.
---
I'm scared there are too many people hoarding those now that there will be much more supply than demand in phase 3.
---
The whole left side is completely separated from the whole right side, you have to backtrack to the middle (yes, jumping down and then following a path you already cleared back to somewhere you already were is backtracking...) after one side and then all the way to the entrance after the other side. None of the quests reference the actual last boss (the murloc). If someone completed leaders of the fang quest and assumed that was it, they missed the boss with the good loot pieces as well as a pretty xp-lucrative quest-starting item, the glowing shard.
---
I'm not saying it some incredibly complex maze, but back before there was atlas loot, it wasn't immediately apparent and it certainly wasn't "just keep going the way that there is more mobs to kill and it's linear".
---
https://youtu.be/sp7Ofgpfxoc?t=189
---
I dunno why you're so invested in what I think. Here it is, easily broken out.
---
1. Servers devoted to unchanged classic
---
2. Servers that are devoted to TBC
---
3. Servers devoted to Wrath. Wrath is where the game permanently changed, and Death Knights damaged the core classes to me. So I would prefer if Wrath is just never revived.
---
I don't really care if it's a nostalgia run or not - if new players want to play classic, they can, if they get tired of classic and want changes, find a new game I guess?
---
Less competition for weapons, more weapon drops, and the raid isn't hard enough for the dps difference to matter.   Also, this guy is 2h Fury.
---
I can argue that Sword Spec is a hell of a lot of fun to use, being a huge boost in damage for a leveling warrior like myself.
---
10% of your main skill is nothing to scoff at.
---
Understandable. I read through wowhead a lot while trying to camp out the pattern and it's always just personal experiences that are...unusual.
---
Such as farming the Big Iron Fishing pole. Someone said "VERY LOW DROP RATE!" and it took them an hour to find 3. After multiple hours farming it, I found it easier to just buy it on the AH.
---
Same with the pattern, them saying it's a 30 min pattern that rotates with other patterns but I've found no patterns for over an hour, while also getting multiple patterns from Qia in under 30 minutes. I'm convinced nobody really knows how it works other than the devs. It's all speculation.
---
I remember back in vanilla I would get annoyed if people helped me. I found it funny too, like /yelling in all caps "I DON'T NEED HELP" as I almost die to one mob.
---
There's so much random toxicity from people it's killing my vibe
---
Frost will still give you more survivability and is the spec for raiding until AQ. The only dungeons you will have an issue with leveling would be RFD and then some specific bosses that have high frost resist. You can also stay AoE and just spell cleave SM at this point too and there is no competition for mobs  inside a dungeon.
---
Its 12m.
---
Hah, yea! See what I did there¿
---
My tank buddy Gave me solid advice
---
ALWAYS run toward the tank if your taking on Aggro, never run away from healers and tank
---
Couldn't you charge? When I fight warriors they always back up and charge me to interrupt whatever spell im in the middle of casting. Like I still usually win, but I know I get charged at least twice per battle.
---
I dunno how warriors work.
---
&gt; You’re so lucky I saved you 
---
Yeah, god forbid you have to spend a few minutes running back to your corpse with zero other consequences.
---
Rogues in STV.
---
See my guild is excited to bear tank because it's one less warrior we have to prioritize gear on especially since bears can armor cap in blues.
---
burning steppes, not searing gorge.
---
A team with healers will be better off then a team with zero healers. Your statement makes no sense because any pvp class will do way better if they have a healer. Giving warriors a "pocket healer" was only a thing because they were already the most powerful class on the field. Better to let everyone else die if it meant keeping the warrior alive.
---
They're the ones in lfg chat spamming for princess and angerforge runs so they can max their dps for easymode MC that was cleared weeks ago by sub-level 60's.
---
You will want to farm the arena for the Ban’Thok Sash, and Golemlordc for Omni Cast boots. 
---
You then will want to do the quest to get Eye of Orgrimmar ring.
---
None of these are “heavy grinds”.
---
As for the Archmage robes. I HIGHLY suggest it. I bought the pattern (150g) and it’s even cheaper now on my server. I farmed half the mats (took me about 2-4 days of a couple hours a day farming), then bought the second half for time purposes.
---
However this chest piece is BIS until AQ/Naxx. So it’s a worthy investment.
---
good. rp servers are a waste of servers. this makes me happy :)
---
Brings back memories of “type /camp for instant win!” In battlegrounds... those poor souls 😄
---
Didn’t go human :( wish horse had sword racial. So many more swords than axes.
---
I wouldn’t take it too seriously, the guy claiming you “poached” is just being overly dramatic. I’ve been horde 60 on the server since the second week and had nothing but good interactions and runs with your members.
---
Thats where 4.1 point comes in!
---
I carry salt for this reason lol!
---
People who volunteer to be a tank or healer but actually have no idea how to perform that role. "I'm a warrior, that means I can tank, right?"
---
Proceeds to "tank" with a 10 level old two hander, double pull a pack, try to spam thunderclap but fail because they're out of rage, die in battle stance, and blame the healer.
---
So weird lol. Good to know ty
---
Gratz! 8 bars into 39 with on 55g. 
---
Ain't hapnin for me!
---
Layering. It makes the game not true “classic”
---
Leaves the party so you can't see the loot
---
*burning steppes
---
Honestly I’ve been thinking about my salt about Invicta today because of this thread, and I’m just upset because some guildies left when I felt like we had a community.  I was so excited for a bunch of us to hit 60 together and start raiding.  I get that Invicta is the guild for tryhards, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
---
The Path of Glory.
---
Thrash Blade from Mara should be top priority next. But also just a question, you do know that you can be Fury with a 2hander right? The only reason I ask is because leveling with dual wield is super difficult you miss way more. 2 handed fury or arms is way better.
---
Heh I saw you guys trying to line up the other night. 
---
Grats.
---
Threat is what matters. 5% hp don't mean shit.
---
8g50s on Kromcrush Alliance. 52 Pally helped me kill one yesterday that I skinned and through up the devilsaur leather in the AH for.
---
I suppose I could, but I'm going off BIS gear lists.  
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKD1SXeQWfoZKHO7zZUnQk3iixzfYF_BqkzQ-V_Pj6U/edit#gid=1890428553
---
Oh ok that makes more sense. Thanks!
---
I'm on it boss.
---
I don't understand... what's the issue here?  If the Druid was healing and damaging effectively that's hard to do but awesome for efficient runs.   Even though I'm full healer spec I often start fights in cat form with my energy bar full since a few backstabs can do a shit ton of "free damage" before I shift out and heal.  It's more work but there's no downside as long as I don't build too much aggro and don't get tunnel vision.
---
I play a mage and I approve this message.
---
Just curious, how many people do you need to farm the trash?
---
Zero minutes to a half hour.
---
It trivializes threat but you out-threat warrior tanks as is.
---
Can't you trade BoP items in a raid?  or is that in a formal raid only with an ID  Ony, MC, BWL, etc...
---
I'll probably want to go mail. Thanks!
---
Oh sorry, I had originally misread. For nameplates I use (I'm not 100% sure this is what it's called but I think it is) KUI nameplates
---
Maybe. I’ll let you know when I get there.  May be awhile cuz these aoe farm levels take soooooo long /s
---
People's entitlement. Had someone bitching last night because another warrior outrolled him on HoJ. Went on a big tirade in guildchat. It was a fellow guildie that won and no loot rules were discussed. Dude wasn't even max level crying about not winning a roll. Fuck that type of player.
---
No I'm no misunderstanding. You can word it differently.. or rehash your opinion, but leveling faster doesnt mean you are a better player. One just simply has no effect on the other.
---
This is extremely homosexual.
---
So the problem is fitting in all those talents at once. HotW/NS is the truest hybrid spec, but you're missing natural shapeshifter so the mana loss is too heavy.
---
You can run Moonglow balance/Resto hybrid but you're missing all of the feral skills so you don't really contribute all that much to damage.
---
Natural Shapeshifter + HotW full feral is the best for constant shifting but you don't have any Resto talents and your healing suffers.
---
And most of the time in dungeon groups it's the healer's mana that dictates the pace of the pulls, so using your mana to contribute a relatively small amount of damage is just slowing down your run rather than providing any real benefit.
---
Are you on Dreadmist (EU) by any chance?
---
It just sounded like you were trying to sell the fish but not the food that is easy to make.  You might see different results.  Anyhoo, happy fishing.
---
When I see a Horde mage AoE farming, I specifically go gently remind him that it may be a dangerous affair on a PvP server by showing that person to the graveyard.
---
Yeah a handful of our guildies went Herod at launch to play evil horde and they ditched it quick because they couldn't even log on.
---
If you’re on flamelash, 10g to my good self..... I joke haha
---
Move with your mouse while typing.
---
Reminds me of Stephen Gammell's work somewhat. (That's a good thing)
---
My husband bribed me with Pier One. One item I’ve been dying to buy for one dungeon tanked. If I hated it, zero pressure to do it ever again. 
---
We shouted at each other through it, I was worried I was terrible, but now I tank regularly and we’ve got a tanking rug in the hallway. I needed a lot of support in the early days (huntards and bad DPS had me thinking I was a rotten tank) but now I’m tanking in a guild full of veteran players who are shocked to hear I’m a newbie. It’s been so much fun to learn to  tank with my husband’s support that now I’m obviously lurking on reddit lol
---
This.. WoW is not a difficult game. Communication and human interactions is what make this game challenging and rewarding.
---
Yeah only the normal raids
---
I almost spit out my coffee at work to this comment. Well done sir.
---
Cool so there is no Dev blog saying that thanks.
---
I hope they add brand new content to the classic framework and I'll be there to slurp up your juicy tears if they do nomnomnom
---
on the other hand, it might be better to have to wait longer, than him tanking for you.
---
Ah, missed that, mb.
---
Warrior definitely has a high skill cap.
---
I got it then promptly replaced it with Perdition's 2 weeks later.
---
Yeah u just suck I’ve never died.  Sorry just the truth upgrade your strategy
---
There was a day where blizz bugged warriors and gave them an extra talent. It lasted about only a day or so before being hot fixed.
---
36 mage. 44 gold. Nothing crazy bought.
---
Heroic strike is garbage right? When should it be used if at all?
---
once hes done leveling 8 characters to 60 he will be having a hard time finding groups to run dungeons to get the pre raid gear
---
Except most people aren't finding new ways to play. They're just repeating the meta they see all the streamers doing. 
---
I've had one group that used a shammy tank to try it out and that's because I recruited him and wanted to see how it'd go. Any group I've joined that wasn't a guild run or group I put together myself it's been an AoE/mismanaged threat hellscape because everyone is trying to do the AoE meta even if the group comp is terrible for AoE.
---
Lmao, pathetic
---
Level 40 warrior, Alliance side, and am 30 gold short of my mount. I have mining and skinning. What is the best way to get that last 30 gold?
---
Druid wpvp is the most high skill ceiling class there is. Requires good spell damage gear and lots of consumables.
---
Pure classes are always the best bet
---
I mean, the ZF spellcleave groups boggle my mind too. Ran a handful of quests while just watching this one guy spamming for a mage, a warlock and a healer for ZF GY. 
---
Not only is that run insanely boring, if you can't put it together then I promise just doing the actual instance will be more XP per hour.
---
I don't even understand the XP/hr obsession. Why are 50s doing ZF when they could already be farming Mara for their endgame items?
---
what blows my mind even more is you dont even need a shield to tank pre 50. I've had so more tanks rock a 2h for small-medium pulls and bosses the whole way up so far. Shields are for doing massive pulls and aoe.
---
Zooming on the map! might as well add dungeon finder while we're at it. I'll have you know back in vanilla (which I never played, but the internet yells so I agree) I could grab a mountain dew and ~~bowl~~ bag of doritos thanks to the long flight times. #NoChange  MY CLASSIC EXPERIENCE WILL BE RUINED BY OPTIMAL FLIGHT PATHS. /s
---
As a tank I think you'll be wanting a Warden Staff over mcp. Ideally getting an agi enchant on it when that drops next phase(?)
---
Mcp is if you're feral dps as it brings you somewhat close to rogues who have slice n dice as a class ability. I could be wrong on this, I've never raided vanilla as feral but I have known a few MT ferals on the nono realms who only used warden when tanking
---
it isnt wa
---
Would like to trade.
---
Skeram + Sulfuras - have Gnar, Sudo
---
Kromcrush - want Gnar or Sudo
---
One of many reasons I play RP-PvP.
---
People are more chill IMO, and when they aren't it's usually entertaining or for RP reasons so still fun.
---
Nothing wrong with the GMs response here imo. 
---
What is wrong, however, is your expectations from the interaction. If it’s not a confirmed bug, there’s nothing really that the GM can do. There’s a lot of times where people think something is a bug but it’s not. (I have not done this quest so I cannot comment further on it)
---
GM provides you with the appropriate action to take at this time, which is to report it as a bug. He/she cannot just complete the quest for you because you think it’s a bug with no actual proof.
---
i dont have quartz
---
I would consider them to be nearly equivalent. They do almost identical damage, but you are trading 5stam for 5spirit. Stam is usually considered better for warriors, but both are useful for solo leveling.
---
In Vanilla I knew a Naxx geared forsaken warrior that would tank groups through UD strat with the charger on reserve being his only stipulation.  He eventually got it IIRC
---
I use Nightfall's WoW Classic Horde Leveling Guide. Am Level 37 and so far it's been very helpful, accurate and imho efficient
---
dont have it
---
I apologize - I don't think spell cleaving is inherently bad. When applied with a group of competent players, it's definitely a more efficient way to level. My comment, which I did not state in any clear terms, was more related to the people who solo-level as a mage, but expect every group they enter to accommodate spell cleaving - even when the mage doesn't know how to do it well, either. This leads to them blaming the tank, the healer - everyone else - for their consistent aggro.
---
When leveling with a group of competent friends/guildies - especially given the makeup you outlined - it is, of course, a faster and more efficient way to level.
---
What is wrong with you?
---
It also will put a raid marker on the mobs you pickpocket which I find to a nice addition when doing a pack of mobs. 
---
 https://willitclassic.com/view/UxZdFZEE1sZ4E2w3yDvv
---
Try to focus on 2-3 max and rotate them according to your rested XP
---
Druid is a super cool class but sadly doesn't have too much of a place in the endgame in class, if that's your goal. You're mostly just around for innvervate.
---
I'd say stick with the shaman. They have the only real AoE healing in classic and are the most unique. Paladins are probably "better" thanks to their buffs but that's not really a fun/interesting reason.
---
Seems the choice of faction is WAY more important than the choice of class, you really don't have any more compelling reason to pick a faction?
---
Yeah... Every *every* legit pvp group had a bear fear druid / resto minor.
---
A median is an average. Mean, median, and mode are all different averages.
---
When most people say "Average" they actually mean "Mean"
---
When dps waits before a pull threat is a non issue. 
---
5% hp means you don’t wipe because you can take more and bigger hits. 
---
If a boss can kill the tank it doesn’t matter what his threat is, because he is dead...
---
Haha wow, that's very flattering! I could only ever dream if being as good as him one day tho :D
---
Was it henry? He's always pulling that shit
---
Oh hell yea.
---
Thanks brotha!
---
Currently it is for sure. No point fury tanking until you have threat issues. Then it lets the dps go nuts and the fights can end earlier
---
People doing it currently have no clue why you do it
---
I would flat out not heal anyone who did this in a group.  I get that it's annoying to spam mages for free water in IF.  I always tip them a Health Pot or cash if I don't have any.  But in the dungeon?  It's part of your job.  No water = no heals.
---
Looks like static +5 may be the best.
---
Where do you use curse of tongues?
---
Got my druid to 56 and almost regret rolling Druid. Played it majority of my wow career and not sure how I feel about it anymore. Wish I would have made a hunter like I first did back in the day. To reroll or not ? 😂😭
---
You can AoE half the pulls in LBRS. And it doesn't take some specialized AoE group. It just requires that you know what the hell you're doing, and a competent group with at least one other mage or warlock who understands how to coordinate with you. The tank doesn't need to hold threat on everything if it's dying before it seriously hurts anyone.
---
haha.  Love this.  If I'm going to be playing all evening and have some questing and such to do as well, I'll run a dungeon first so a nice Mage loads me up with goodies.  lol
---
your ability to evade damage is balanced by being squishy. A high health's toon ability to soak damage limits how much they can evade. 
---
If you play both the same it'll be a moot point.
---
Key Ring. Of all the changes (layering, flight paths, whatever) they made to Classic vs Vanilla. Or all the #no changes crowd.
---
I could have lived with them adding the key ring from day one.
---
The ones where the melee target skull and hold cleave for 5-10s are great. Especially mages that let me build just a second more threat.
---
you write a TLDR then.
---
If you count the money spent on talents and actually used it’s not far off. I don’t have hundreds of gold in my purse but I’ve definitely spent that on talents, repairs and was able to funnel extra into professions.
---
Are they crushable? They get just as much defense from talents as warriors and can wear the same gear
---
I'll never forgot the first time I was murdered by a OEB. I was in Arathi Farming the elementals for the Princess chain quest when all of a sudden I hear a loud charge.
---
Within a milisecond the sky goes black from this massive shiny black form over me. It's a Male Tauren holding the Obsidian blade. The blade doesn't glisten in the light, nae it seems to be pulling light into is cold dark empty soul, noting escapes it. I stupidly attempt to gouge the Might Tauren Warr upon me, he almost laughs shrugging off my gouge, as the OEB rips into my leather armor I feel my life force drop to around 5%. Instinctively my body goes into evade mode, pointless. I dodge an attack and feel my spirit leave my body.
---
Waking back up I'm standing infront of a Angelic Ghost who tells me, "You got knocked the FUCK OUT!"
---
Long story short to a mid 40's rogue who didn't know shit in Vanilla a Tauren w/this sword is Terri-fucking-fying. Grats on getting the sword.
---
Guy in the guild I'm in while leveling started spamming chat trying to sell his cloth. Told him to try trade chat and I get a "mind your own business" response. Alright then. Only real negative interaction I've had. I don't understand why people gotta be so damn mad all the time.
---
2004s? How many were there for you?
---
60 priest. 600g. No epic mount. Power leveled tailoring to craft truefaith. Bought 3 orbs and a couple mooncloth and pearls. I've probably netted over 1600 gold on my character.
---
RIGHT! i actually did this exact same thing as in the clip lol! Havn't run ZF in years and was with some buddies and just ran in like oh snap i can pull these so we get a nice group! SIKE. They went right thru my barrier and i was ded before it even started :( 
---
haha! But shit it was funny and we kept moving. good times.
---
Why does XP/hour matter at all to anyone who isn’t streaming competitively? And if they are, that’s fine, but they probably have been 60 for two weeks now. No one who is lvl 45 has any reason AT ALL to care about xp/hour. It literally doesn’t make any sense.
---
He probably won't even die from that, he's like 10 secs away from getting out of lava
---
I'm gonna be honest, I have played every single expansion since BC and just now realized that Tirion is dead..
---
If I could remember what it was I’d post it lol. I just copy pasted it from somewhere in this subreddit
---
Fairbanks PvP - Quest Boss had 3% life when we stole aggro!
---
No clue. I just bought the whole set for 15g.
---
Blaming blizzard that you died to an npc with no possibility of it being your fault
---
Looool yeah I’m in the wrong for letting you know. Reality sucks
---
Fake and boring. Put in some effort next time, like Leeroy's guild did.
---
SMOrc has become a nuisance for the alliance. “PvP guild” that just camps low levels and thinks they’re good.
---
And don't have to spend 30 minutes choosing the best mount color.
---
Found a rando in a dungeon and we paired up. He pulled agro on a mob and starts running away. I text "Run TO the tank" and he dropped the group. He was 2 levels below the mobs, so that was probably a fun decision. I was just being helpful.
---
God I need to stop playing this game. I saw your edit thanking people for your first silver and my first thought was, "How tf do you only have 1 silver by this point if your mage can make food and water already?"  lol
---
I am thinking of making a character on an RP server not sure of horde or alliance. I have always been a horde guy but I am not sure what type of RP there is for horde. I main a mage and would be looking at something completely different maybe a warrior, pally, rogue, or enhance shami. Any thoughts or ideas?
---
raid boss tanking.
---
Everytime someone does that to me for no reason other than being a mage, I make sure to follow him around and ruin his day :D
---
Yeah I have pretty solid gear too BiS in a lot of pieces with about 7.5k life fully buffed and armor capped. Also farmed 6 pummlers for that extra juicy threat when needed. I am not respeccing resto so...just innervate and decurse and do what I can do help heal.
---
It sells for less. Either I sell the raw squid or use the cooked squid for myself and guild members. I’m not desperate to sell them, but if the market is right then I will.  I tried selling some earlier to see if they sold, I have over 200 of them and tried selling a stack, which did not sell, so I’m going to hold on to them until I need them in raids or the market goes crazy for them
---
RIGHT SIDE. MANY WHELPS.
---
it is, but, going to go with, that's hard coded into the skill. But it made sense to allow druids to do skinning and herbing in forms, cause, digging and slashing.
---
His death was so anti-climatic anyway. So much so that I had forgotten that he died.
---
Longtime Druid player going Rogue for classic here, would recommend. Don't reroll just because you think it isn't the best though.
---
At 34 do you have any world PvP experience to base this on? If you feel like others are more powerful then sure, but if it's just hearsay I wouldn't put any stock into it.
---
Two 2004. Before Christ and after Christ.
---
So just ignore the entire middle paragraph, which was the point I was trying to make?
---
Wonder how much a standard GM is paid?
---
Also how are they graded for performance?
---
Dude i feel you. I made a shaman because I liked the idea of a magic-using melee class. However its just grown super stale to me. Relies so much on crits &amp; windfury procs. I think I'll swap at 40 just to taste the other side. Maybe dip into healing as well.   
---
But I know at the end of the day, I'll have fun in pvp and group content no matter what spec I gear up for :D Because shamans are rad dude.
---
There is a further 10% at exalted
---
I'm not entirely sure, I got that from a Warrior discord called "Fight Club", there may be other class-specific discords that have made similar.
---
I 100% use it if I know I have to take a quick break, it's the perfect amount of time to use the bathroom. I was grinding out levels after I decided to reroll classes two week in so I figured out the fastest route haha, it wasn't about saving money, just time lol.
---
I had someone volunteer to tank arena/Angerforge runs. A bit of the way through, after dealing with him unable to hold aggro, he remarks "lmao my 1h sword skill is low can't hit anything"
---
Mortal strike adds a useless debuff that has higher priority than warlock dots.
---
Yeah that's what someone else said and if that's the case then they can go get fucked
---
Night elf hunter with a cat is godlike solo pvp. You can kill any class if you get the opener at a range.  Including locks and priests if you drain mana by spamming viper sting and staying max range. After stirring up a shit storm by ganking a ton of people, you can just shadowmeld and stealth your cat and wait for people to pass by. Or break stealth and pick off stragglers.
---
Thanks for your reply! I suppose then overall balance is best ;) Since my dots hit 5 times a cast, you would "expect" that a 20% crit would proc once per dot, but because the damage per tick is so low, even a crit isn't all that much damage. But that 200 spell damage (assuming a 1:1 replacement) in lieu of 5% crit would be much more consistent damage. So long as I have enough mana to manage downtime, I should probably look to better optimize for damage over time.
---
Show original picture or it's not legit
---
One more question though: how do incremental rank costs work?
---
For example, Bite 1 costs 1 TP, Bite 2 costs 4 TP.
---
If I train Bite 1 then 2 it costs 5 TP, right?
---
What if I train Bite 2 directly? Does it cost 5 TP as well, or only 4?
---
Curse of the Moonfire Spam helps raid DPS significantly
---
How do you know he was also fully looting non skinnable mobs? There is no way to tell iirc.
---
And that's kinda my point, if he wasn't a skinner it doesn't justify that response at all.
---
Funny...did my dues in STV on a pvp server and never once got ganked!
---
I banned a friend from my discord server because he plays CSGO. I was also blasted drunk and just got done playing a round of CSGO and uninstalled it. When I woke up the next day I saw the server log and was like "oops". People do silly shit.
---
Before anyone ask I was healer not the one who took the screenshot and mages name who took the handguards is Xcakubur
---
&gt;  i never see any rogues
---
That's a compliment for us
---
At least you gave everyone a good laugh! You can always take that with you. And thanks for not blaming the healer when a death happens, that's so rare haha
---
One significant issue with druid healers is that they do not have a regular res. They only have a once every 30 minute battle res. This means groups with druid healers and no paladins/shamans/priests have to be EXTRA careful in dungeons since it means everyone who dies needs to do a corpse run. Obviously, the battle res needs to be saved for instances where a critical group member drops, for example the tank or if the main healer if the druid is not it.
---
This is why I go full Feral spec on my druid. Cause while healing might be touchy, I have zero problems finding groups as main tank.
---
How exactly did I insult you? I said to get over it and insinuated you're overreacting which appears to be accurate. I'll say it again get over it and you filthy multi boxers are what's wrong with the community.
---
Yeah the metric of success is not "did you pull aggro", it's "did shit die before it hurt anyone".
---
I wasn't aware this was a problem for anyone. If there isn't a guild group advertising at the time I just make my own group so I generally always am doing something if I want to be. And I get random whispers from people asking for a healer most of the time anyway. Outside of that I'm usually busy solo farming for gold for my mount.
---
Depends on the situation, i guess. I typically won't engage a fight i see happening unless a group member is being ganked or the horde is actively griefing alliance near me. I had an alliance spit on me last night because i didn't help them gank a mage. I have a live and let live attitude though.
---
If I were the one organizing, I'd reserve the mh.

---
Pro tip, use ice block :)
---
Yeppppp.  /r/rosetintedglasses but recently turned into /r/wontadmititsabadgame
---
I’ve even been in a group with some shammies who were dps. Some dope healer gear dropped, they asked if they could need. The healer doesn’t say anything, so they roll need against healer and won. Then healer leaves. Like the hell? If you really need something then you also need to speak up about it before hand
---
Also the more veteran/informed players "know better" than to re-roll or start on a fresh/new server with low population unless specifically playing there for that reason, whereas newer/inexperienced players will just play wherever and only realize later down the line that it may not have been the most prudent choice.
---
The way skarm put it always stuck out to me "for your bis threat weapon you can farm a 30s level dungeon or farm Bindings each week on raid lockouts, your choice"
---
PLS BRO PLS SPELLCLEAVE NEEDS U BRO
---
Ah yes, the "bad mage," I have seen this a few times when pugging on my druid the first time around. Usually they would say "shit tank tbh" or "where is heals?" after planking due to their own mistakes. As a mage player I apologise for these people, but there will be shitters from every class.
---
What I did was just explain to them what they did wrong, make fun of them in party chat, make them run back and then kick them after they ran back to the dungeon entrance (to make the death hurt more and reinforce that they need to change their playstyle) while whispering guildies to fill the spot. I have like 6 mages on my ignore list haha
---
why not go out and help?
---
I play on Herod. Thank you for giving me someone to block in advance.
---
Had 700g at one point, im down to 600g or so, split across alts and stuff.  haven't farmed in a while.
---
Fashion, obviously.
---
Original picture of what? xD Like proof that I drew it? If that's what u mean I'm delighted u think it's worthy of being stolen, haha
---
Yeah you're right I just assumed but regardless I asked him nicely and he responded like that.
---
My favorite weapon in the game. I went on wowhead or something and set my sights on it back in Vanilla. Raided MC with my guild every raid for about 6 months and never saw it, everyone knew I wanted it and when it dropped our vent channel went nuts. Still have it on my retail warrior and wouldn't sell it for the world. Congrats man!
---
&gt; You do realize multiboxing had literally no involvement in this entire process, right?
---
Well actually, it had kind of a major part. You farm 5x the normal amount of money/mats and then pool them into huge amounts that gets you caught by their automated detection system.
---
Doesn't matter what you think is common or not.
---
low level, usually no.  But mid to high level materials often have decent demand.  When dungeons become unsoloable by most classes (SM Cath) is where the value of enchanting materials goes up.
---
Herod is not balanced... A lot of people in 1 sided servers say it's balanced because of ego reasons.
---
Imagine telling this story to a normal person and being like "Haha isn't that funny? I made him so angry by ruining all that work that he did. He wasted all that time because I was able to cheat him out of it and I stole the leather haha. Isn't that great, I made the innocent random person so angry" and your new beautiful girlfriend at the restaurant on your first date is like "yeah thats real funny they must have been super angry" great job
---

2004 2 - Warcraft Boogaloo
---
I thought the boot enchant was 4% though.
---
You can farm mats for black dragonscale tunic or chest or whatever it's called. Or just do the dungeons more. I've been 60 dry of even seeing Savage gladiator chain, had two friends both level 53 see it separately on their first run of brd
---
This is why I was never a fan of boosted characters.  You don't get the experience in the lower levels figuring out how to play the class.  All the sudden you have this mountain of abilities that you haven't experimented with.  Reading a "do this rotation" guide isn't the same as playing the class.
---
Download guidelime on curseforge
---
Yo Kromcrush = best server NA
---
Why is multi boxing allowed? IMO an imbalanced trade is an imbalanced trade. Doesn't matter if you're one entity, it tilted the balance of the economy.
---
Tanking is quite difficult. If DPS complains, IMO, they should STFU and go make a tank. Not only is PVE a pain in the ass for warriors, but then DPS complains when they don't tank well, its a lose/lose.
---
Sick of this spellcleave crap already. Also what is the obsession with only having certain classes in an instance, I remember back in the day if you could get 5 guys together and aslong as you had a healer and half a tank you would give the instance a go.
---
It shows up as floating combat text
---
More like: Someone says in chat that he's getting ganked, but no one cares
---
When moving my character doesn't cancel my wand attack. Movement cancelled the auto-wand attack in original classic. Nothing is more frustrating to me when I can't throw a heal or shield myself because my dang wand just won't stop firing and I die because of it.
---
Fuck ALL of you who are giving this man shit on any level for this post. Especially those of you giving him shit for being a multi boxer. He enjoys this game differently than you. Doesn’t give you the right to look down on him. Y’all do realize that most people IRL give you the same reaction just for playing WOW at all that y’all are giving him for being a multi boxer, right? Take this post for what it is and quit being a bunch of cock bags .
---
Not Kirtonos. Nothing but trash talk and assholes on this server.
---
When dps waits the fights take longer, healers run oom, ony stays in the air for more than 15sec, ragnaros summons adds, more people get geddon bombed, etc.
---
Even at 10k hp, which no one has yet, it's only 500 extra hp. 5% extra hp ONLY ever makes a difference if you tank falls under 5% hp which should basically never happen.
---
You can make up for the tank by improving your healing, the only way to increase your dps potential is to have more threat.
---
The days of tanks stacking defense and hp are over.
---
It’s not. You’re asking him to just take a 100g cut because you’re friends.
---
Some people are still stuck in retail.
---
What would your rotation of you needed to keep aggro on 2 mobs?
---
Yeah you can’t transfer from PVE to PVP. That would allow people to hit 60 with a smooth PVE experience and then transfer to a PVP server and destroy people lol
---
Lol and bubbles before you pull.
---
A lot of abilities are shit so suggesting people just frivolously waste cash to "try them out" is really, really bad advice in Vanilla WoW. You should know which ones are useful ahead of time so you don't get screwed with huge training bills while leveling when every gold piece matters a lot.
---
relax they will fix it , just use a different pet in the meantime and stay calm
---
Citation required.
---
You made an assumption, a few people told you were wrong on your assumption and instead of accepting it you call OP pathetic? Hmm, funny that 😂
---
I should clarify, I have 0 trouble finding groups.  The only issue I've had is being invited to groups as a healer, only to find out it's spellcleave, then being dropped once I've made it to the dungeon because they found a priest instead who can shield the eye for warlocks.  It's only happened twice to me but very annoying
---
According to the black pill Hot = personality
---
Been mortal striking everything I see after being destroyed on my way to 40.
---
Wow, you should really be able to load this guy up with gear!
---
Thanks! Appreciate it. It's only cus I'll see a tank when I dps and they seem to handle aggro on large mobs a lot better than I do.
---
Hey can you tank armory? Just need you and we're g2g!!
---
How do you make a fifth tab? My fifth tab always removes itself from existence when I relog.
---
Should not be still using that wand @ 40 lol 
---
25% is still more damage because shadow weaving you have to proc and stack 5 times.  If you made 5 casts on every mob you would be oom real fast.
---
Both feel pretty weak at the start but get strong with gear. Both are fun and viable though. I’d just pick from a fantasy perspective. What sounds more fun, sneaking around and assassinating people then quickly escaping, or charging in head on and fighting hard until everything is dead or until you are?
---
Demon Slayer, he's a stubborn jackass.
---
Doesnt warlok have fewer counters than shadow priest? S priest is 50/50 vs mage, slightly unfavored vs lock with felhunter and unfavored vs shaman. 
---
Warlock is weak to rogue but annihilates mage and is even to slightly favored vs shamans
---
It's just weird because there's 3 locks on my guild complaining about the same thing, It might have been a coincidence tho, Idk.
---
Yes, I'll take one large spacetime continuum break please.
---
LPT you bank won't organize it self
---
Yes, but not all skills. Save your gold and buy what you need.
---
&gt; I would never want to rely on others like that
---
Do you manually click off all class buffs in MC? You probably should if you truly feel that way.
---
I don't disagree that they are and should design their system for the majority, but when I send in tickets saying "I was trading my own accounts", and nobody checks that information or thinks that "Chubby traded 1000g to ChubbyBeta" is probably his own account, seems more like being lazy and not doing their job properly.
---
This is what I've started doing. It always shocks my party members when I'm able to say, "Hmm let's get a rogue." 2 minutes later a rogue joins. I'm able to find whatever class at w/e level I want.
---
All I do is /who class level-level
---
The key with pickpocketing for gold is in a level range where you can reasonably get through without being seen, and the junkboxes give more than just a broken watch. You're probably a bit low to comfortably pickpocket most of SM without being specced into being sneakier. Really, I'd just macro your pickpocket to your opener and farm humanoids around your level.
---
I’ve never tried the Lyceum farm actually. It’s always been the entrance.
---
And the Lyceum just keeps regenerating without having to reset the instance even. Amazing!
---
It's not. You can't roll if you're not in the the instance. If you release you're not in the instance.
---
Glad to see your bar setup has evolved since vanilla 😁
---
Hey I know that guy! Does that mean I’m famous?
---
The only reason there is a Horde and Alliance is because the Alliance is hugely, massively, overwhelmingly racist :p
---
I get that, and if you don't want to, that's fine.
---
But it isn't always about what's most efficient. Is it worth it to get to 60 with an empty friends list and nobody who can get you into a good guild?
---
I have 20-30 people on my friends list, and I made a guild that I and my friends have recruited another 50 people for (or so). All levelers right now, but that will even out as people get to max level and as the active recruiters get to max level and can start recruiting in higher level dungeons. I talk regularly with 2 other GMs who are doing similar things that I am. One of my characters has people saying "oh shit it's that guy..." when I start talking in the Barrens (OK maybe that bit is a little less positive, but he isn't guilded so it's less of a big deal).
---
It's a social game. Grouping up for at least part of your leveling is how you get better at it.
---
it was the healers fault though. didnt even shield you or follow you so that youd be in range.
---
honestly, it sounds like you either want them to build a time machine to refund your 2 days banned or you want them to somehow never make errors when writing programs.
---
neither is realistic.
---
They made a mistake. It took a few days of correspondence with a few, probably underpaid, support personnel before you got your resolution. But you still got one. I don't think I can fault Blizzard for that and neither should you.
---
Also judging by this response and plenty of others in this thread, you are an extremely disrespectful individual and you should learn to treat others with more respect before you go around making unrealistic demands of how Blizzard should treat you.
---
SM library and Armory.
---
From the inital rogue quest you can go from 1-90 easily.
---
From there do pickpocket runs in SM at 40 to go from 90-170, then get 5 points from picking the SM doors.
---
At level ~50, pick pocket run ZF.  RFD is also profitable but won't level pick pocketing as much.
---
Then at 60, go straight to 300 from BRD pickpocketing, Dark Iron, coffer runs.
---
Enjoy easy mode 1-300 pick pocketing guide that somehow no one knows.
---
Yeah. This is why I said wait untill after the dungeon then go back and grab it. Because people like you will cause the drama...
---
Pressing X for doubt on this,
---
&gt;You could always do this if you had a paladin.
---
Yeah, my regular group used to consist of a pally tank, a healing priest, 2 mages, and a lock (me). Pally would pull a large group, we'd give him a second for consecration to gather threat, then we'd all AoE as hard as possible. Things went really, really fast. Yeah, modern AoE groups do it faster, but this was early vanilla and I skipped the vast majority of leveling content because dungeons were such easy experience.
---
Man, here I am running SM Library for the blade and getting staff drops 10/11 times. I guess you’re the one taking my blade drops :D
---
I was surprised it wasn't in the game. The legitimate server I played on before Classic even had it.
---
Tanks may be few and far between but that's not good main tank behavior. If he couldn't tell he was a dead man without your help and then gets upset he's prob just a dps warrior anyway
---
At 52 you should be fine look for groups running arena runs or obtaining the shadowforge key runs. That will cover up to finious darkfire. You would have to come back later to the second half
---
Your art is very nice. I like the line work a lot😉
---
Thats basically it, theres an old saying in wow that i believe applys to most situation:  
---
If the tank dies , its the healers fault  
---
If the healer dies , its the tanks fault  
---
If the dps dies , its their own fault.
---
Threat is very important in vanilla and sadly alot of players that never played when threat was important dont know about it.
---
I play a rogue, i know i do alot of damage in a short amount time and  i generate alot of threat, I will pull no matter what, even if the tank has aggro established , its not uncommon . but i know this , im okay with this , i have alot of dodge/parry , i have evasion and if it comes to it i can dump aggro with vanish, ill be okay.
---
Eh... in general I think it's in poor form for a warrior to need a staff over a caster. But that staff is pretty much just as good for them as it is you. And there is also the quest reward (Crescent Staff) they can easily get. If you went into the dungeon knowing you might roll need on that staff, you probably should have brought it up with the group before running the dungeon. If only to avoid any of the shaming and bad feeling at the end.
---
But he couldnt have prevented gouge.  
---
Theres literally nothing he could do to prevent this from happening aside from trying to fake out the rogue by bringing another mob over and killing it on top of the devilsaur and then the rogue wont know which corpse he actually looted and you could bait him out that way.
---
Im a level 59 gnome mage on a pve server. I only did this because 4 irl friends that barley play talked me into playing on pagle. My original plan was to roll pvp server horde mage and a shaman alt. I feel your pain brother i kind of want to reroll aswell but i already have 10 days played on my gnome mage. I just want to world pvp :c
---
?
---
Good to know. Im taking my time to level my boomkin and just wanna know the numbers really look like.
---
Most people who play almost every day are in the 30-50 zone I would say.
---
I like how that was supposed to be the best server for a variety of reasons but all indications are for it to be the worst.
---
Don’t bother till lvl 60. With each level the gold per hour you can earn increases so there’s no point gold farming before lvl 60
---
It doesn't stack but its still really good since you don't have to run speed on boots and you can equip it in combat
---
It's like Vegeta when Goku saves him.
---
[Look at the bones!](https://youtu.be/TnOdAT6H94s?t=82)
---
Man, use nvidia experience and turn on instant replay. It's these moments we always wish we recorded to share.
---
Pay a mage like 1g for 6x stacks of water before you go out and about.
---
Very cool! I would have never guessed. I just assumed it was the first successful attempt at mining a node. I love reddit.
---
Teach meeeeee
---
I'm level 58 and have never had to make blind powder bc I get so much of it from lockboxes.
---
Too real dude, too real.
---
Had a mage in SM spam aoe as soon as I pulled hound master. Died immediately... "wtf, I said I was going to aoe, heal me"
---
Hhahahaaaa dude funny lol, never heard of this happening
---
Yes! I dunno what i was thinking... but i went there at lvl25 because i was gung ho on getting my fishing up as high as possible as fast as possible, and i specifically farmed the cages for the Fishing Pole :)      
---
You're exactly right that as a Druid it was super easy. The only other classes i would even see were a few Warlocks with underwater breathing.   
---
It's specifically thanks to trying to raise my professions while leveling that i got to 37 and realized i was broke, lol!
---
Lol at Watercup, I'm guessing mage? I do love the people who commit to their class like that druid.
---
K
---
I played a protection paladin in vanilla and BC and most of what has been said here is true, though I disagree about them being not raid viable. As a main tank, certainly not. But there are plenty of off tanking duties in MC, Ony, BWL and if I recall ZG and AQ20 you can tank very effectively. You will be asked to heal when you are not needed to tank, but I was fine with that. Being MT is a full time job and not fun imo, at least in vanilla. Plenty of warriors do not want to tank every second of the raid. 
---
Gear is the hardest part. I ended up using bits of the T2 set, T0.5, PvP gear (those shoulders are the bomb), and the deathbone set mixed in with non set tanking plate.
---
I would have disagreed. Garbage for casters is just ignorant. The stats are similar and spirit is a very valuable stat for casters at lower levels (warriors too).
---
Sounds like it could be a translation issue.
---
How do you farm bud?
---
Yeah, the Murloc Cave is a neat little extra. I really liked the spiders when I was 40ish, they paid for my mount aswell :)
---
Except it is, but whatever.
---
&gt;wamp jaguar so you can claw+bite on CD
---
claw and bite? dont they share cooldowns so u can only do 1?
---
Witnessthis. I kinda hope he sees this and rekindle. Execute order 66
---
I charged to open the fight, and iceblock was used on my intercept. Generating the rage to use intercept (which is on a 30s cooldown) is also hard if you can't get the hits in.
---
Where is that extended character stats window from?
---
I didn’t see anything overly “friendly” about this interaction. The absence of negativity is not positivity, it’s neutrality.
---
Generally given the amount of time required to form a group it is in the best interest of all to let people work out their issues rather than summarily remove them from the group and try to find a replacement. Even if said replacement is deemed necessary, there is no guarantee that newcomer will perform any better.
---
This behavior though is textbook codependency and the antithesis of healthy social interaction.
---
It’s also the same reason that people flocked to Group finder when it was implemented. Because people no longer had to choke down your poor behavior or poor performance. If the group experience in vanilla had been such a positive experience group finder mechanics would have been DOA.
---
If you’re enjoying classic or you had a different experience in vanilla good for you. But i would urge you to think more critically and not jump to the conclusion that “everyone was nicer in vanilla” a lot of the same people who played retail are playing classic, or who played vanilla continued to play retail. All your comment does is perpetuate a “us vs them” or “retail vs classic” conversation... which is totally ridiculous btw.
---
I can tell you that my experience in classic thus far has been far less forgiving, and that most groups are requiring levels much higher than is necessary for the content, making the group play totally irrelevant.
---
Well he got a 91 roll on the thing. He probably would've won it anyway.
---
It interrupts I think? At least it does for the ele sham I play with
---
Lmao nice one. What font are you using btw? Love that ui
---
Same, someone mentioned him on retail and I was like “weird he hasn’t had anything to say about Sylvanas” then I was like “wait... is he dead?” He joins Vol’jin in the cool characters that died for nothing club
---
For rogue: How does the +5 Swords Human racial change how much hit I need? I have a total of +10 (5 from racial, 5 from talents). So what hit% should I aim for?
---
Oof that mage flair. Let me guess no tank can hold agro from you when you aoe so demo must be trash.
---
If a tank has a 3-4 gcds head start on you they should be able to hold agro on them long enough for them to die (I'm only referring to the scarab room here). This is only given if you're not playing like a monkey and running in and CoC before the tank has the mobs rounded up, or youre running into melee with arcane explosion. 
---
If you do that they're not going to be able to hold agro because you misunderstand how agro works.
---
It's a little wonky for certain. I had one of the elites outside BRD follow me all the way up the chain, out the mountain, and to the fp in burning steppes. No I never hit him to keep him engaged, aside from the one gouge I hit him with as I first ran by, and I have no thorns or heals as a rogue.
---
There are a couple offhands with armor, and one for alliance with a chance on being hit: does damage, but unfortunately not any other stats. It's a suitable set if you don't have warden staff, but definitely not on the same level.
---
Melderon's testing confirms that the two theoretically output around the same average damage increase. However, Melderon also points out the situational things to consider, like the fact that Rockbiter adding smooth damage is probably better for grinding because Windfury's damage increase is often wasted when it procs late on a mob and causes overkill. There's a whole section of Melderon's video where he speaks about smooth (Rockbiter, Flametongue) vs spiky (Windfury, Frostbrand) damage. Basically the conclusion is that all 4 enhancements at appropriate ranks add close to the same amount of damage increase that personal preference can be your determining factor, but situation should highly influence this. Windfury and Frostbrand are better for PvP where it's more valuable to output burst to beat an enemy that needs to react, heal, etc.

You're not the brightest, are you?

He said GM's start as interns and temp hires, and typically make about 13-14 an hour, which he says for the cities they are located in is horrible wages. After a certain period of time you can get directly hired and can get bumped up to something around 15 to 16 an hour.
---
He said that player surveys are how they are reviewed. You must get all 5 stars on a review to have a review considered "good", anything less than 5 stars is considered a bad review, and you've failed that review, even if its only a single 4 star in one of a dozen categories.
---
They also use average tickets handled per hour as your hiring metric, which means if you're not getting tons of 5 stars and pushing out tickets as fast as possible, you will most likely not get a direct hire.
---
(Please note, he has not been a GM for blizzard in years, things can change, but its not likely)

It’s not so bad here

Use the same stratagy as ele/resto shamans for soloing princess.

Moonfire, cat bleeds, insect swarm, faerie fire (feral/non-feral). In most PvP matchups 1v1 in world, you'll be switching between forms **a lot**. In OG, I used a [24/0/27](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/51005030015013--555500100015), with some obvious min/max omissions to help with PvP survivability, and it was a lot of fun. Super fun against melee classes, especially rogues and warriors.
---
have you read his other responses in this thread?
---
he's being very disrespectful to most people he is communicating to right now.

He's brought it upon himself.

The graph wouldn't be 'wrong.'
---
Maybe its because of my line of work. I'm in finance, and oftentimes we have to take our complex models and find a way to succinctly present them to investors or other bankers. If the numbers are correct, part of the job is presenting them in a way that doesn't confuse people. 
---
A graph isn't right or wrong, because think of the PURPOSE of a graph. So long as the numbers are correct, the only way your graph can be wrong is if you're presenting them in a confusing manner. Because thats the purpose of a graph. As long as the data is right, the job of the graph is to show those numbers to a reader. 
---
You're here saying I'm telling them to make the graph wrong. I'm telling you that the only way a graph is 'wrong' is if it confuses readers. I'm not saying the graph has to 'look pretty.' You can have the best looking graph in the world, but if it doesn't present the numbers in a way to help the readers comprehend your point, you have failed to make an effective graph.
---
I don't see the point in attacking me and blaming me for this. Your example doesn't fit--a more fitting example would be this: You are speaking Spanish as they speak in Spain while you are in Mexico. Sure, you're technically correct, but if you really want to connect with the person you're speaking to you should speak it as they do there. You don't tell them 'they're wrong.' 
---
tldr; don't be arrogant, its more important to understand the needs of your reader and present the information to them appropriately instead of telling them they are 'wrong' for being confused.
---
Nah that’s too low. The middle of the bell curve is around lvl 40-50 atm.
---
The average toon might be 18-30 but a lot of those will have been abandoned. The average player is much higher.
---
Dungeon xp sucked and it wasn't as easy to just aoe everything in private servers. Funny enough, the most OG classic experience I had was in private servers. Classic is just easy? Mobs are easier to kill, as well. Seems like pservers had armour and resistances way higher than blizzard did.
---
I haven't taken any time off work, typically work more then 40 hours a week, have gone entire weekends without playing, had no plans or leveling route, and I am 46 with 4 alts.

Welcome to WoW
---
On my server I thought hmm, wonder if /join layer would work. It did, writing 'layer' there got instant invite from some people, who had set some addon (?) to auto-invite for keyword. I've used the channel many times when being on overcrowded areas and have got instant invite from maybe 10 different people. Worth checking if such "service" works elsewhere.
---
Welp, there's a mob in Silverpine called Thule (level 24 golden elite) who has a curse that can shrink you and majorly reduces your attack and spell power. I don't know if it stacks with the world enlarger.
---
Yeah, I’ve made the swap to Heartseeker with friends and it’s pretty crazy how many alliance there are
---
Assnectar, 29 UD warlock.
---
You like totally forgot shamans!
---
Awesome to hear it's not as bad as people say. Thank you
---
SM run back isn't even that bad lol
---
Pretty sure it's due to them thinking there will be a lot of deaths.
---
Lol like they get invited to parties.
---
yo, i'm on judgement eu, and a weird thing i'm noticing is that almost nobody is asking for late-game dungeons in trade chat - tons of SM, gnomeregan, uldaman and ZF, but anything above maraudon seems to be missing from the chat
---
What gives?
---
Nice you found one
---
Again, you don’t seem to grasp that people have to choose to submit their logs. The game has been out for barely over a month. The data you have is garbage, as is your stance on warrior dps.
---
Yeah I also get to cheat at it since I'm GMing and if I only get 1 perk from a volunteer position that doesn't come with many benefits its that I can decide to main bear tank if I want to.  lol
---
Ah, I'd read somewhere on wowhead from a comment that it works, but I certainly never tested it.
---
That makes you a glass cannon though. You’ll be face tanking mobs most of the time and it’s got significantly less survivability than Soul Link or Drain Tank would.
---
Yup. That fucking sucks.
---
Yikes
---
I am soooo with you on the speedrun thing. I would so much rather rhe challenge go up and take my time in that sort of content. In particular it destroys all social aspects of pugging and drives people to toxicity a lot quicker.
---
I think you're a level or 2 from it.
---
Rogue - BackStabbith
---
Warlock - McDotalds
---
Monk - Accupuncher
---
Female Tauren - MisSteak(All alliance person that made his first horde toon)
---
Mage - Damnage
---
Yeah I was thinking the same with the wind serpent as well. Don't they still melee auto attack though?
---
&gt; i rp an accountant working for my main who is too scared of war on my bank alt, but you really shouldn't complain that someone with a non-rp name logs on for 5 minutes a day.
---
hey man, i dont care what'cha do. you do you fam. o7 i don't personally care if someone has a non-rp name, it's all w/e most rp'ers that're serious have a rp addon that they can apply a name other people with rp addons can see. char name shouldn't entirely matter
---
Just keep it dropped?
---
I'm getting closer to completing the armorsmithing quest. Can people complete it and become an armorsmith if I sell them the ornate mithril items? Would that be a good way to make money? Or does everyone need to do all the recipe quests?
---
Not hard to do when you're wearing leather...
---
Maybe someone can help clear this up - Would they have been able to loot the item if the mob died when the rest of the party was  released and dead?  Looks to me like he was the only one who had loot privileges on that item, so he likely killed it after the group had died and released.   I'm fairly certain in that instance, nobody except for the mage would have been able to loot the gauntlets.
---
20g on Fairbanks alliance last I saw
---
I'll take leveling as Prot over Arms or Fury any day. Guaranteed dungeon spot and half the food requirement when questing.
---
this is why im very glad i play with my guild which is mostly irl friends
---
Support industry in general completely incapable of reading/listening to what I say when it is factually relevant?
---
My expectations are a little higher. Yes, some companies are like this. But far from all.
---
You are an idiot.  Do you not know how tabs work?
---
 /facepalm 
---
Scroll up and check yourself before you post false shit dude
---
Well, a lot of warriors have whirlwind axe by then which they'll use over ravager. In my experience, it's the 2h enh shaman that usually want it.
---
Pop Ice Barrier before pulls you know will need AoE.
---
Yup... I don't blame the people who do it, but I definitely blame Blizz for allowing it.
---
Go make some of your own then instead of complaining on other people’s posts :)
---
Yeah look at the bottom of the post
---
Hi, /u/LukaMrk

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dce5lp/looking_for_a_solid_pvpleveling_spec_on_my_warlock/).
---
lmfao oh no I do that except it's worse because I'm spec'd fire
---
&gt; only guild currently raiding on Benediction
---
&gt;left because they wanted to raid
---
well, yeah
---
My bad then my experience with warrior is from pservers so I guess that’s not reliable. Especially since you can’t proc crit talents with a /sit macro.
---
The higher you get, the faster stuff usually dies.  You can't multidot because tanks wont hold aggro, and the focus is going to die too fast for anything else to be very effective.  I am 60, but as you lvl you'll use less and less dots.  
---
I like how your snap judgement is that I dont know how to play lock though.  You can fuck right off with that.
---
I'm leveling fishing in STV running from Grom'grol south and around Booty Bay looking for pools. I had no idea how good mithril bound trunks were... I've gotten enough bolts of runecloth and mageweave to give bags to all my bank alts...
---
Shadow priest here. You're gonna melt mobs much much faster. Without looking at any resources, I know you get 15% damage increase on shadow spells, and with 5 points in darkness you get another 10%. You're looking at 25% more damage. Stack shadow weaves and it's another 15% more damage! Rarely will you get to 5 stacks of it on a single mob, but with all this combined it's 40% damage increase than without shadow form. 
---
Being able to heal is definitely nice when not on shadow form, but if you apply Vampiric embrace (with the improved 2 points in it), you get 30% healing from your damage as well. Along with spirit tap (100% spirit boost after a kill), you'll be able to roll from mob to mob quickly while remaining at full health and good mana. 
---
Tldr: ~40% more damage, plus heals, plus Mana = much more enjoyable and efficient leveling experience vs a holy or disc preist solo
---
Should definitely level as arms.
---
I often do dungeons with two mages from my guild, and I encourage them to go nuts with aoe on small guys while I hold the elites and drag mobs off with Frostbolts so they hit no one instead of me. It’s all abour coordination.
---
Ever since dinging 60 on my paladin I found the need to tank dungeons as there is just a shortage of them. I have been 30/21/0 for a long while but just today switched to 21/21/9 to aid in my tanking career. I still have illumination and divine favour, I just lost the 5% crit for holy spells. 
---
Although I am generally not better at tanking solo targets compared to a warrior, I am better at 3+ mob packs, and as my gear has improved I can see my guildies even like rolling with me. I usually only heal dungeons, but I enjoy tanking Stratholme and Scholomance as Exorcism on undead is a pseudo-taunt due to the high threat it outputs.
---
I typically open with a judgment of righteous and then use seal of wisdom to sustain mana whilst using consecrate to hold threat. I found a balance of spell power and defence is nice as spellpower helps you hold threat better.
---
Although we are not the best tanks, we are tanks when they are not available. And putting salvation on all the DPS isn't really a problem imo, it just allows them to not hold back!
---
I wouldn't expect to tank raids, but leveling and 5mans are amazing.
---
This. You can do this build and tank all dungeons while being the Blessing of Sanctuary bot for your raids as well as healing in raids. 
---
Then as time passes by you can push the raid tanking like the theorycrafters do.
---
&gt;This is one of those subtle errors that will really screw up a new player, and possibly make them quit because they're tired of spending half their game time drinking.
---
It's pretty common to not value spirit at all. Mostly because you level as Enhancement for at least the first 40 levels and your damage isn't primarily from your spells. By the time you're post 40, you've transitioned into healing and start picking up Mp5 gear. 
---
So no, that guide isn't particularly off base with common meta for leveling or endgame. Feel free to disagree, but it's not just that guide that says that.
---
&gt;Looking specifically at the tier 1 and tier 3 picks. Unless you intend to level 1h+shield, shield spec is vastly overshadowed by Ancestral Knowledge (+5% max Mana).
---
Yeah that guy's smoking crack.
---
I bet he walks funny with that stick up his butt
---
Tried that still the same thing it resets to the question mark on launch. 
---
Macro is 
---
\#showtooltip Sunder Armor
---
/cast Sunder Armor 
---
No extra lines between them reddits being weird.
---
So you're looking to tank your way through 5-mans into endgame healing?
---
I'd just go a proper tank spec for now, then flip to a proper healing spec at 60. If you find yourself healing before 60, you can probably get by with a simple gear swap. 
---
For now at level 51, I'd recommend a straightforward 11/31/0. Get holy shield and consecration and tank the shit out of those dungeons.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Look at the bottom of the post.
---
Lifetapping and then getting healed is just outsourcing your drinking to the healer
---
Vanilla =/= Mists of Pandaria
---
Keg Smash OP
---
We did, it was called Cataclysm.
---
My parents said I used to behave like this when I was THREE years old.
---
You wrote that huge novel to show people how much of a loser you are to corpse camp... strange.
---
It's in the interface settings somewhere.
---
Needed more spell cleave. Easy mistake to make.
---
Can confirm. Had a GM back in WotLK who loved to do this. He'd kick someone from the guild/raid for not pulling their weight and then he'd /ignore them and the proceed to tell them how much of a scrub they are.
---
Bears will do about 1/5 of your overall DPS and cats will do about 1/3.
---
It’s true. Alliance is op.
---
Mind
---
Blown
---
also people who abused layers and got no repercussions.
---
And if they actually sell. If it doesn’t sell you lose the deposit.
---
Ohh look, another reason rule 3 exists
---
Correct, and no one knows.  Theory is that they may announce it during blizzcon.
---
Is there any advantage to a fishing skill above 300? Asking because you seem like you know your shit and can't find this info anywhere.
---
There are exceptions...tank dying isnt always the healers fault.
---
From what I know, Arms is considered better for pvp because you can more easily utilize multiple stances ("stance dancing") because of the Tactical Mastery talent. 
---
You're fine. I'm also leveling as Arms, level 22 so far.
---
I am reactorfour, the hunter that is ready to blow his top anytime someone breaks a trap.
---
What do you mean lines in between?
---
It’s easy to smash up pretty places that people are used to to try to elicit a cheap emotional reaction. Theramore, the Vale, Darnassus... it’s one of the writings’ favorite tools. But it’s harder to bother rebuilding any of it anew afterwards, so they just never can be bothered.
---
Literally just did it, doesn’t seem changed at all
---
Let us know when you actually look at the picture and understand what happened.
---
Makes sense, if a full spec'd cat was like a top 3 dps spec in the game -- contributing a small amount of DPS would be worth it, but like you said, its really not even worth it. I might stick to the bear/resto hybrid spec so I have Bear to at least quest/farm in.
---
Thank you for 'getting' me. I would not Death Coil you.
---
Easily angered players (Ironic, yes).  Usually either people who expect others to know things yet refuse to explain, or people who get extremely angry if you give them any advice.  
---
The first case can be solved by something as simple as "we don't have to pull this group if you hug the wall." 
---
The second isn't so simple because even something like "tank the mobs a little farther back, we have a low level dps" can set them off.
---
That looks fine, so not sure.  Possibly an add-on conflict then?
---
Still doesnt justify his behavior.  He could have easily remedied the situation by telling everyone he isnt a ninja and they can roll when they're back.  They may have quickly accused him being a ninja but he quickly confirmed their accusations.
---
 &gt;  It's not up to [..] for me to have to defend them either
---
Then stop doing it?  A character could be logged in for 7 days for 24 hours a day, and you'd still be saying there's no proof its a bot. You're asking for proof when proof is impossible to provide. Minus an incredible malfunction of a bot, there's no way for Player A to ever really know if Player B is botting. All we have are clues on which to make a determination, and the clues here point in a obvious direction. 
---
This isn't a court of law. This is reddit. Stop conflating the two.
---
Anyone struggling that hard for gold is doing something wrong. Everyone I know had more then enough gold. Outside of epic mount at 60 gold should never be an issue unless people are pissing it away on the AH for gear every 5 levels.
---
Playing the sh!t out of it since launch day and almost 30.
---
Magic numbers are "hard coded" in the sense that if the variable needs changing, you'll have to modify each instance of the number to reflect the change or else run into inconsistency.
---
Macro it....geez guys it's on like every hunter guide.
---
As Warrior Tank, if i put 3 points in Improved Shield Block, will I get 3 additional block charges or is it only 1 block charge? Currently I only put 1 point and contemplating on putting 2 more points.
---
It might seem weird but some people do actually like to do things by themselves.
---
All the wowhead guides are pretty garbage dude.
---
4 manned it last night np my Warrior friend he tanked both Emp and Princess insuring to interrupt her as much as possible while myself and the priest dps'd Emp down asap.
---
yeah that part of the flight... its so high up and far from anything, so the result is this
---
People. 9/10 conversations are immature, rude shit. A general, and accepted, lack of politeness and curtesy. People think it’s cool to be a complete dickbag to other people because they’re safe behind a computer screen. I wish people spoke to other online as if that person was standing right in front of them because they’d be a lot nicer to everyone.
---
You had to make a second post, because your first one got downvoted to the point of being hidden. Nothing you've posted has any merit or value.
---
"Esepcially when you are multiboxing and trading thousands of gold around between accounts lol.  Like cmon. You're asking for trouble at that point." - Ah yes, girls who wear short skirts deserve to be raped, they were asking for it. Good one.
---
Yeah i think people are retarded. I've been having much better luck selling/buying only on trade. Today I was selling heavy leather for 40s a stack. Asks me if I will cut him a deal and sell him 6 stacks for 2g 60s. Sure man let me help you out.
---
Infected wounds? Are you referring to the snare added in like wrath?
---
The keyring was added in 1.11, so it has nothing to do with nochanges.
---
It did have an involvement. While the multiboxing itself did not trigger the ban, it seems like it resulted in your accounts being flagged as "suspicious" and thus under more scrutiny than other accounts.
---
Aight, we all have different playstyles. 
---
Don't suggest bad ones, though, like "just play without reading"
---
Happened to me too as a rogue, after waiting for about an hour with a holy pally to do BRD. He randomly adds another warlock when we're already full on DPS (we had a mage and another lock already), then I get the boot. This shit has brainwashed people.
---
If there was a priest or a druid who were needing, then yeah that's pretty poor form.
---
A warrior gets better rewards from the WC quest anyway, no?  15dps 1hander if I remember.
---
Probably not super helpful, but I've noticed with the release of classic and the "weekly guides" it seems clear that people at wowhead have jobs to release x number of "news/guides" per week or something because they post the stupidest bare bones useless stuff 90% of the time. 
---
I wish the wowhead space would try to recreate the content level of theorycrafting that elitist jerks forum had, without all the bad drama.
---
Not all rogues know the glory of macoring pick pocket to all stealth abilities
---
Use the priests mana to determine the pull; if you have other melee or a hunter in the group it's a non issue to put a mage in the position of wanding.
---
Think about it this way:  On multiple mobs, tanks have to manage their rage, and balance using it between raising threat or keeping it to be able to spam abilities on the next pull.  Hunters have to manage their ammo, their pet health, and mana pool.  Rogues and DPS druids, their energy.
---
Why shouldn't mages have to learn to manage their mana pool?  The biggest measure of success for a dungeon is running it consistently, and smoothly with minimal downtime.
---
Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.
---
SM until you can do ZF
---
That is good. I've also seen Banksy that I liked.
---
What addon is that your using for you nameplate/health bar? I really like how it shows when mana regens and really want this.
---
Aaah yes I member.
---
You can tank 2h arms in Vanilla until the 50s.
---
Exactly this.
---
The ones that are locked out of the “LFG” channel because someone set a password, not realizing “LookingForGroup” is the real channel.
---
So many people don’t know there’s a difference and that one is player-made and the other is official.
---
"lack %hit"
---
only need 6% with appropriate race/edgies, you have that easily on pre bis
---
also Heroic Strike/OH interaction has made DW even better. on trash is not even close.
---
Nope!
---
I’m having trouble settling on a class, I never got to 60 in vanilla, I played from around the Zul’Gurub release and only got into end game in Wotlk. Apologies for the upcoming wall of text.
---
I started classic with a troll mage on launch day, it became apparent quite quickly that there would be a glut of mages, and I got sick of playing the flavour of the month class by level 20, so I rerolled troll shaman, he was more interesting, but I’m not that keen on melee dps. I did enjoy healing the odd dungeon though, so I decided to roll undead priest (priest was the first I ever got to cap, but I raided as shadow in wrath).
---
Priest ticked off a lot of the boxes I like, cloth caster class, ability to buff random strangers, ability to Rez, possibly to coolest weapon in game in benediction (which I managed to get before it was removed in cata) but I was worried about healing raids, and didn’t want to be gimped at end game.
---
Then I completely rerolled and made a human paladin (the first class I ever made was pally, got him to 50 before BC) but again, melee dps wasn’t thrilling and the 5 min buff duration really annoyed me, so I went off the healing classes and rolled a gnome warlock, which also ticked a lot of boxes for me, caster dps, lots of utility, good end game gold making. But once I hit 20 it didn’t feel right.  So I rolled a female undead warlock, then a female undead priest and now I’m sitting on a male undead warlock.
---
Here’s what I know, I want to be useful to groups, so having a buff or a Rez / heal or some great utility would be good. I prefer range to melee, want a class not gimped at end game (preferably with good gold making ability). I also have no friends, so I’m mainly playing solo.
---
That's actually hilariously pathetic of him.
---
I have yet to encounter anyone that complains about a wipe in any of the dungeon groups I've been in so far while playing Classic. Perhaps it's just my luck though.
---
The last time I played WoW was during the release of Cataclysm, and tank/healers in Dungeon Finder groups would frequently quit after one wipe. It was quite frustrating.
---
?? wut u talking about
---
There were very few mounts in vanilla. Even fewer rare mounts outside of race specific ones. This one was very rare. It’s an undead horse just like the undead’s racial mounts so it’s cooler and more noticeable when another race is riding it

Not my video, but that's pretty much what I copied.
---
Yes, you can spec 0/30/21 and be a hybrid that can basically do anything pre-raids.
---
As far as end-game tanking goes, you'll still be second to warriors. BUT you'll be ahead of paladin. Any smart guild will want a feral druid tank to offtank because this means they can gear up both tanks simultaneously, and as a druid you barely compete for gear. So yes, you'll be considered inferior for main tanking but you should be able to find a guild (if they are smart) that values you as an off tank purely for the fact that it will ease the gearing process for the entire raid.
---
At level 38 you are still quite a ways off from "halfway" to 60. Level 44 is the "halfway" point in terms of EXP required while also factoring in the increased EXP rewarded for quests/mobs. IMO, it's always better to find what you like then it is to try to force yourself to play something. The whole sunk cost fallacy is in full effect here - no matter what, you've already "spent" the time that you spent to get a paladin to 38. You should choose to spend future time based off of what's fun now, not out of commitment. At least that's my opinion.
---
Do dps warriors purposely try to pull aggro from the tank in dungeons for rage gen? As a tank should I allow that to happen or taunt immediately?
---
In that same quest there is a 15dps 1hand sword.  Why do casters have to take the shaft because they have an alternate quest reward, when warriors are in the exact same position?
---
Leveling a mage, 58 currently, pretty burned out with BRD tbh. When can I start running LBRS/UBRS/Scholo &amp; Strat? Everyone I see spamming to go there is 60.

Pre raid Bis is temporary, speed is forever.

You could argue that if you are doing a simplistic guide for leveling, then excluding spirit makes sense because a newer player wont fully understand the 5 second wait time before regen kicks in.  But then the guide starts talking about Shamans tanking ... lol....
---
This is a hotly contested topic and general rule of thumb is you should talk about it before a group or assume Need before Greed rules apply. This can lead to things being ninja'd though. 
---
Someone said something yesterday that made me change my mind on this subject. They said something like "If everyone always needs on BoE's then that means that the only way to get BoE would be off the auction house." That just doesn't seem right to me.
---
There was no acknowledgment of understanding or attempt to process the information. They could at least say that they are unable to consider that information, to prompt the user to ask for a supervisor. 
---
Like if you can't help me, don't pretend like you've carefully considered all the facts and are doing all that can be done.
---
I don't know I've never played with that healer before but he was a shaman so I didn't think more of it. The Warlock did way more than just tap though, he was really annoying in general and caused many wipes because he wanted to max our his dps.
---
That dagger is so nice for elemental.
---
Extra damage and mana recovery.
---
Luna unit Frames! :)
---
Check the quest log. If the quest says "bring me 6 &lt;item&gt;" then you can probably make and sell but I'm pretty sure it says something like "craft and bring me" so you'd have to do it yourself.
---
Now selling all the mats as a kit for the quest is an idea
---
He dies in the lead up scenario to legion lol. I guess you just weren’t paying attention?
---
I think I offended a couple people because they are trying to belittle the point and issue I made this thread about. I appreciate your support. The point of this post was the point out people like them, and that its unfortunate for the community, the irony is I point it out directly as being part of why this thread exists, so they flock here to do exactly what I said is an issue. It's also to point out that of course, as with all systems, that there are huge flaws in how blizzard handles and deals with their customers, but of course I can only go off my experience.  
---
Thanks for your post!

Telling someone continuing a bad habit is the same as beating your newborn? What kind of drugs are you on?

Pretty casual player.  Married and still go to college.  I get .pdfs of my textbooks and do voice-to-speech and just fish while I "study".  been making free action potions for a steady income.  It's not great.  If I was higher level I'd be making a lot more, but I find fishing in non-contested zones less distracting.

But Dire Maul came out *after* the Deadmines.

I hate so much how properly skipping trash has been embraced by Activision as a mechanic instead of designed around and eliminated like the unintended bug it really is.

It's troll for purely pve.

I really help people, be Nice and try to keep a healthy community but these kind of people are the reason I added to my current /hi /thanks macros and /bye a /spit macro
---
this is bearly funny
---
And I can only assume you're enraged at someone having a differing, yet supportable, opinion. You think there's only ever 1 right answer, and you have it. 
---
You've got a lot to learn.
---
Tbf, bashing the class "learning their limit" has always been a favourite past time of WoW players. I've always played a hunter, trust me on this one.
---
For tanking it's absolute garbage, but that's not a secret. For solo and DPS roles in groups it's awesome.
---
The Cadaverous chest is a REALLY low drop rate. We've seen dozens of belts, boots, and pants in Scholo, but never the chest. It's been Bloodmail for the most part.
---
People have been doing some theory crafting in the Rogue and Warrior Discords and 6 piece (for the energy proc) + Devilsaur is pretty close to pre-raid BiS at this point. That BiS you linked with the Rogue talents puts you way over what you need for +hit.
---
&gt; Mostly because you level as Enhancement for at least the first 40 levels and your damage isn't primarily from your spells.
---
I agree with this, but surely it's not controversial to say that Spirit should be higher than int and probably stam too?
---
My personal weights are STR &gt; AGI &gt; SPI &gt; INT &gt; STAM all the way to 60. Shamans don't need to transition to healing, they can heal fine all the way to 60 with enhance and a proper healing set. A full transition to endgame resto should be done after 50 for sure, and should come with a respec.
---
Sounds good I’ll check it out! My main alt is a warrior so I’ll definitely need to freshen up on some information regarding warriors in Classic.
---
its juvenile teen pride
---
You're trolling at this point. And badly at that. I just said I wanted Classic+ servers to be their own thing, but leave Classic servers alone.
---
“Crap they hurt” now equals “atleast I have chicken”
---
there are a shitload of healers and you only need 1.  way easier finding a group as dps
---
That’s..not really RP. Talking in /s doesn’t make it roleplay.
---
Who hurt you? What in the fuck...
---
Stop justifying keyboard turning, it's not comfortable, it's just fucking bad...Jesus Christ.
---
Shame!!
---
Good hunters weave melee hits into their rotation.
---
They cant get rid of sacrifice. You easily outvalue them even without fear.
---
From what I’ve seen, a lot of those classic guides on Wowhead are hilariously bad.
---
had a world blue drop the other day and we both rolled 99 on it, and the other guy won it...
---
It's almost imposible to cat weave in dungeons.  You can get away with it a little bit in the lower level dungeons. But higher level you simply won't have the Mana to keep up with the group. It just makes more sense to toss out FF and moonfires.  
---
  I've tried specs that involve the Mana reduction from shapeshifting and the talent that gives you energy when shifting forms. Along with the helm that gives you energy too.  I feel like if you can get a big enough mana pool it might be possible. But it still won't be anywhere near as effective as it is on retail. 
---
I've switched to a 0/30/21 build for the panic nature swiftness button. But I still catweave a bit when it's a smaller pull. Or maybe il start in stealth and try to help nuke skull before starting to heal. Stuff like that.
---
You can tank as 2h arms just fine from 10-50.
---
I will call that shit out immediately when I see it. #Notinmygroup.
---
I was endlessly amused watching a paladin and warrior spam Westfall with "LF Tank DM then G2G!" for nearly 2 hours last night.
---
If it makes you feel any better I spend 6 days trying to get broken tooth. Finally got him, immediately hearthstoned back to org, sold some stuff, chatted with friends then the gf came over and I afked the rest of the day.
---
Signed on the next day to see my broken tooth had ran away cuz I didn't feed him when i caught him an apparently sitting in town for 2 hours with an unfed freshly caught rare spawn pet is grounds for it to run away.
---
I haven't touched my hunter since.
---
You are conflating one character with one person.  The number of PEOPLE isn't at all relevant. 
---
If you are solo and a group of 5 people controlling 5 characters comes up, you will die.  Likewise, if you are solo and 1 person controlling 5 characters comes up, you will die.  The outcome is the same regardless of how many people are controlling 5 characters.  I don't hear anyone complaining about dying to 5 other characters in game when they are controlled by 5 people, but you are complaining when you die to 5 characters controlled by 1 person.  
---
The number of people controlling X characters is entirely and utterly irrelevant.  I agree 5 character are more deadly in PvP than 1 character.  That's 5 v 1.  If you went 5 v 5 you'd have a much better chance at winning.  It's just not even a factor to consider.
---
If you don't complain about groups of 5 independent people killing you in PvP, you can't really complain when 5 characters controlled by 1 person kill you.
---
there have been no less than a dozen videos posted of this since classic was released. the only difference is, their posts actually happened lol.
---
How do you parry a big blob of fat?   That would be like trying to parry a charging elephant.  Physics aren't on your side.
---
Oh man EQ, I still remember once I timed myself regening Mana and it took like 12 mins from going oom to full mana, that sure was a game of patience!
---
Bring the mob back to the tank.  They need to be in melee range to get it off you, which is hard if you’re running in circles. 
---
If it’s melee heavy and you don’t think the tank knows they’ve lost one, try jumping as you run in ... otherwise they might not notice you in the crowd.   
---
But in general you should be healing from a mid distance.  Say a tank has 100 threat.  He will lose agro if someone in melee range hits 110 threat OR someone at range hits 130 threat.
---
If your tank is always running off on you, try healing at range for the start of the pull, then running through to the other side when the pack is nearly dead.   By that time the tank should have plenty of threat built up.   You just don’t want to be standing by his shoulder at the start of the pull.
---
the only wasted mana for a healer is unused mana at the end of a fight or overheals.
---
I just right click to mouse turn and have A and D bound to strafe...works great.
---
I do mousewheel scroll up = autorun. Scroll back = stop

Super intuitive and easy with the old “play with one hand while watching tv”

Wasnt there the guy who was mind controlled for an hour straight and they used him to kill quest mobs?

What's a decent gold farming strat for a lvl 46 affliction warlock? I have skinning/engineering and engineering is taking up a lot of gold, but I really want to have it capped prior to 60. Should I try to solo low level dungeons, or is there a nice grinding spot out there somewhere? Up till now I've been grinding skinnable mobs in dustwallow marsh
---
I havent had that issue on Grob. But there's a lot of posts about children like this... I always thought a study would be cool to see what is actually wrong with people like this.
---
Hahaha that's awesome. My buddy was complaining that a critter parried his mace. Held up his little rat claw and the thing just bounced away :D
---
No, some people are just assholes. It’s not like they were invendted by the Cataclysm or something.
---
And the warrior gets a 15 dps 1h sword, which is even better than the staff.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't just go up to any Tauren and just moo at them. That's their word.
---
Definitely a dumb criticism since there are about zero of us that think that.
---
I dunno who you know but as a Rogue and Warrior I struggle making enough gold for my mount at 40. Buying a bunch of skills I won't use for 1 gold each sucks.
---
Some warrior and his buddy charged a devilsaur I was casting at. He got the tag before my frostbolt hit. 
---
So I started laughing at them. I said "y'all need to due these? Lol" and they started replying. Jokes like "yeah we are trash"
---
So while he was talking I was able to get the skin and I just said "yeah me too". He laughed, said "I see" then offered to sell me devilsaur leggings pattern. Good stuff.
---
Thunderclap is a decent opener on pulls with a few mobs but I would skip it against the larger pulls in BRD since it can be a pain to target the mobs it didn't hit right away.
---
It sounds like you are missing Tactical Mastery and Anger Management. These talents are very important for your rage and they're the reason Fury/Prot is not recommended in dungeons. You're better off as 11/5/31 or even full Fury 17/31/0 spec.
---
Try something like this sequence for a large pull: Charge -&gt; Defensive, Demo Shout -&gt; Shout -&gt; Berserker stance, Berserker rage -&gt; Defensive, Taunt skull if needed, Bloodrage, Sunder/Revenge main targets
---
If there are casters/ranged and you can't LoS them, stay within 20yd of your group and use Battle Shout instead of Demo to keep them off the healer right away. You'll need to run over and tag them eventually. With bigger pulls, do more shouting especially at the start. If DPS pull aggro on two targets, taunt the one that's dying slower and let them tank the other.
---
If you're not committed to professions, pick up engineering. Solid Dynamite is dirt cheap and very helpful.
---
Yes please.  
---
Even as a [Prot Pally](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/500501-05005132) with Consecrate at 36, don't immediately summon the freezing winds and volcanoes.  I need 2-3 seconds to secure aggro.
---
I can almost guarantee all you have to do is ask. Most people seem almost eager to help new players.
---
Vuhdo, fivesecondrule, showmemyheals
---
Huh. I figured it was something bigger than that. 
---
I have also heard some people farm Ghost Mushrooms. Do you have any idea if that is actually profitable?
---
Yea I tell my healer not to panic if they see me tap low because I have literally everything that makes self healing more efficient for leveling. They still panic
---
Gen Z. Millennials were also called Gen Y before they came up with a catcher name. We'll see if Gen Z is lasting.

I believe it I just wasn't sure
---
- You can't really multidot because of threat, and multidotting single target is 90% of the time not an effective use of resources.  The higher lvl you get the more true this is, as things die faster.  If you get 3 dots rolling on 4 targets, your tank will never keep up, and if they are not hitting him he'll never get enough rage to pull them off you.  Goes to the next point though:
---
- Part of #1, but threat management is a component to every class so I wouldn't call this something warlocks have to worry about exclusively.
---
- fair enough, but I think that life tapping becomes an automatic reaction when your HP is approaching full, it's more habit than anything in my opinion.  Quite simply, you lifetap as little as possible, in order to not waste HP regen or in order to cast your next nuke.  I find the higher lvl I get the less I lifetap early based on HP regen, because its too little of your health pool.  This has a little merit, but generally I dont ever have to think about it.
---
- You should have imp out, so why are you microing anything?
---
The big thing is that once you respec into xx/ruin, if you arent casting sbolt you aren't going to be critting as often.  Might as well go SM/DS or some other weird funky spec and just blow your mana on dots.

I set zoom to control plus scroll bar personally. But I use the mouse wheel on my hunter to send my pet out and in.

Nah, I haven't actually seen one yet, this was from Vanilla days. It was reserved on my server (Thunderfury) before I started, wanted to reserve it for my alt but oh well.
---
I was speedrunning princess with guildies. 3 warriors in the group all looking for the ring. We had 3 rings within 6 runs. Pretty hawt

Problem with her is that she heals, so an undergeared group might have problems to kill the emp before oom.

Skinning turtles in theramore and fishing all the pools in that area too. Doesn’t hurt to cook the Turtle Meat as well.

Easily made my mount money from about 33-37 from here.
---
What's an AOE spec mage? 15% crit on flamestrike and 6% on AE?
---
Anyway pretty much what you wrote, the best aoe threat tanks have does roughly an equivalent of 200 damage so they basically have to build threat on everything by tabbing and with the help of shield spikes and/or thorns.
---
Does Feign trigger GCD?
---
I don’t usually pay attention to dialogue while playing WoW I’m just there for the grind.

But if you've already finished the quest you shouldn't run with a group that wants to do the quest, if you need anything from her.

I'm going to argue that this is way more in the spirit of PvP than the BB bullshit.

In booty Bay, I can't really solve the PvP problem with a PvP solution. I, or anyone else, will just get shit on by the guards. It's frankly tantamount to griefing because *you can't fight back*.
---
Here?
---
Fair game. You can find this rogue and snap his fucking neck if you try. No guards go stop you.
---
Going from Ashy to Classy
---
Because you're taking significantly more damage than you have to.
---
Crit isn't everything, and when solo, you want to minimize downtime. It diesn't matter if you can kill a mob 5-10% faster if you have to eat after every couple fights.
---
Generally people are hunting some bis drop for themselves. Also most groups dont only do princess. For example the goblin drops a spell crit sword thats tied for bis with one from scholo for warlocks.
---
Nope because unless "greed on all BOE" was stated before the dungeon he could claim "we discussed it before hand that I would receive all BOE loot and distribute it evenly over voip."
---
I can tell what type of shithead you are with the use of the term “white knighting”.  One of my good friends IRL is a multi boxer on retail. Married and works 50+ hours a week at a high paying job. Sorry not everyone fits into your box.
---
That's a better analysis, but you're still only picking numbers that favor your argument. 
---
Why did you compare 2 ranks of Chain Heal but only 1 rank of Healing Wave? HW5 is not the most efficient rank.
---
Oh yeah. I agree completely! I’d rather they never lifetap below 40% ever just because it’s an accident waiting to happen. I regularly let people sit at less than 100% health but sometimes other dps heal (I guess they’re worried?). It doesn’t bother me but I’m also not sure if they realize it’s intentional.
---
I use Miks Scrolling Battle Text, but I believe it's possible to do without. Try poking around the interface options?

Nope, Blackstone Ring is a pre-raid BiS for a lot of class specs which is really the only reason to farm Mara at 60.
---
Third guy did nothing wrong. It's quite impossible to find anyone willing to come just for that boss, even if you only missed 1 person. The run was over when the 2nd one quit.
---
Honestly, in that situation I don't think you could've done much more than say let's try to 4man once by doing a lava run to it. It's just so much less work to get few more to do the full run to there, or arena/golem/anger rather. The afk eat guy can suck dick, the dying guy should've participated in follow up plan but once those two were gone, you were bound to restart anyway.
---
Yes! Even as a beginner healer I was able to heal dungeons with a shadow spec and no point in holy. Wand away friend!
---
Questing is the best way to get gold.
---
Oh ya terrible. Or the odd warrior who doesn't know and uses recklessness. They must have fixed it by now tho. It's been a while.
---
Priests shoyld aldo just fade as soon as they pull aggro. Hell, I usually know as im winding up a greater heal if it'll pull or not and i just fade right after the cast.
---
&gt;I don't see why thousands of customers like me who subbed to play specifically on a RP-PvP server have paid and should not obtain what we paid for.

Do know, I wanted to be a tank at 60 and rolled warrior. I was able to tank the whole way to 60 in dungeons. But finding a guild that is looking for a main tank or off tank has been hard and I’ve had to go dps in raids and just tank out. Doesn’t mean you can’t, just wanted to let you know.
---
Mmm... no you can heal everything as a resto Druid. I never have problems finding a group as one. I play A LOT of Druid on p servers as well as classic now. 
---
If you are having trouble finding a group first I would suggest making your own.

Eranikus' "Sleep" is a Banish, like the Warlock skill Banish meaning it cannot be Dispelled while making the target immune to interaction.
---
Grounding Totem eats the magic effect while not being consumed, turning Erankinus into a mechanicless Tank &amp; Spank.
---
I tried it out randomly after wiping several times instead of dropping WF and noticed nobody got Banished before looking it up and finding out intended.
---
Awesome thank you
---
I open with multi-shot and feign.
---
Possibly. I have heard bears in Naxx are godlike, and really start carrying their weight in some parts of BWL/AQ40. But as a whole, bears got a bad rap during vanilla due to taking crushing blows, which ignores all of that beautiful armor, no?
---
Check out ridosaw on twitch, dude often runs 36-40 accounts at once using a program that sends the keystroke to all of the different windows at the same time
---
Still not even close to the value a melee gets .  And you cant reliably weave on like any MC bosses except maybe luci sulf gole. Garr slows you, you have to stay out of fire, you get feared.
---
There is 0 reason to be taking this from melee. You wanna be a dick in a pub fine but I'd honestly gkick if you took from a guildie.
---
But what if you're Human
---
&gt;Not sure why everyone insists on being passive aggressive all the time.
---
Because by level 45, you're done being the teacher all these folks feel entitled to. You start to feel a little bit resentful that you come prepared and knowledgeable about your class because the group fails entirely without you, and your DPS can't be bothered to do anything except literally run away when they draw aggro in a dungeon by blasting mobs the instant you charge. 
---
You'd think the 45 levels leading up to this dungeon would have taught these players the same organic lessons it taught the tank about aggro and damage, but then you have people like this 
---
&gt;FYI, I was a MT in Vanilla. I never experienced all these woeful trials you guys whine about. Then again, I just communicated with my party/raid.
---
Yeah... 1000000000% don't believe you. There wasn't a tank alive in vanilla that "literally had no bad groups".
---
Boomers aren't gen X though, gen X came between boomers and millennials. It's all the same naming convention, millennials were just called Gen Y before the media came up with a catcher name for them.
---
Who is Tabetha (the Mage/Warlock questgiver hermit woman in Dustwallow Marsh)??
---
She seems so significant and mysterious and is my favorite NPC^^ Does she get any story later on?
---
Doesn't seem like there are any quests from her after Tiara of the Deep ...
---
True, there were more servers with lower populations per server back then. Even if the odds of getting it are the same, there is a higher chance to see another one on your server, which makes it less impressive by that fact alone.
---
I had some rando follow me around UC for 10 minutes the other day after they sent me a tell saying "stam buff plz" which I didn't notice because I was running around tailoring. Then they sent another tell "HELLO?!" and started lecturing me about it like some kind of Undead Karen wanting to see the manager, so I put them on ignore instead. 
---
I buff the shit out of people when I'm running around usually, but I had to laugh at the absurdity of following someone around for 10 minutes in a city expecting a buff instead of just asking someone else.
---
Key ring was in vanilla.
---
That's when they get a /rude and a /fart for posterity.
---
The cash drop rate is pretty good considering you can pull like 1/3 of the dungeon at a time, and with Consecrate/Shield Spike they all just kill themselves. Cloth is an added bonus, really, and I don't think the disenchant value is very high so vendor is preferred (except maybe blue items). I recall that once you get a Skullflame Shield, many Paladins were able to pull literally 100% of the dungeon at once.
---
1% was in wotlk
---
Mobs can dodge attacks from behind, players cannot
---
I don't know, guess I just had an unlucky night. I don't really like the pressure of putting together my own group so I prefer to join others haha, but I asked at least 7 or 8 people that were advertising last night looking for healer and none of them wanted a Druid heal.
---
Omg
---
On my priest, it depends. Generally hunters, druids, and paladins. Warlocks can be troublesome, too.
---
On my rogue, hunters. Hunters are the most frustrating shit to deal with. Hunters mark lasting 2 minutes is so frustrating and the speed at which they can move means no escape or catching up to them.
---
3 No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.

Holy spec'd priests.
---
As a resto druid I feel stupidly confident against every class. But a holy priest? Ugh.
---
There aren't enough hours in the day to win that fight.
---
But nothing else bothers me.
---
Thanks, I got it.
---
I also grabbed a tracker for Revenge. However, the icon shows in all stances. But I'd like that one to only show up when I'm in Defensive Stance. Do you know how I would go about adding a trigger such that the icon only shows up in Defensive Stance? It's not an Aura, so I'm not sure what type of trigger I can use.
---
Yep started at launch, going at dad pace, level 46 now.
---
I still don't know what to play. I played mage for a bit, but combat was super boring for me and also another dps isn't my cup of tea. I was thinking about priest, shaman and druid. I want to heal, but also don't have a problem while playing alone in open world. I want to be useful, but also I don't want to just click 2 buttons and that's all I have to do. I didn't play original classic WoW, so if there are any interesting class quests or anything with "that's cool" effect, that's even better
---
Take the sword bro!
---
from the situation it honestly seemed like you were the only person who wouldn't be to blame.
---
if the tank is keeping aggro for the most part and he dies it is the healers fault. but if threat keeps bouncing around between different DPS and the tank (like it sounds here) it is def not the healers fault for a wipe. a great healer can still pull the group out of it with cooldowns/pots, but it should definitely not be expected and the DPS/tank need to figure out the aggro situation.
---
some overall comments for when this happens in the future: 
---
focus on keeping the tank alive. if the tank dies everyone dies. 
---
if its just one DPS who keeps on pulling it is almost certainly their fault. obviously try to keep them alive, but not at the expense of anyone else and don't go oom keeping the alive, especially if they don't stop attacking and run to the tank. 
---
if multiple DPS keep pulling aggro it is probably a bad tank. 
---
and in both cases the solution is the same, the DPS just need to do less DPS and give the tank more time to get threat.
---
We don’t deserve tanks
---
Thanks. I got one! :)
---
Price for stonescale eel is trash on my server :( I hope it improves
---
Just had the privilege of having two ud rogues try to kill myself. A pally. And a hunter doing a quest in felwood. In their 3 attempts they got the hunter twice. With zero deaths for me. And they had the jump each time. 
---
All 3 encounters ended with their deaths or the surviving one running away with barely any health(cept the time I popped my nifty stopwatch and caught up for a nice hammer of wrath finisher)
---
Looks like u should be babes for multi boxing.  I think that it BS that u can control 5 toons at a time gives u an advantage over some who dosnt

Ran a dungeon with a warr tank named Kapwn. Coolest dude. Actually used a shield and sunder armor. Definitely kapwned at tanking. We even had a mage aoeing and pulling and he would still gain aggro back and hold. Kapwn if you are reading this thank you for being a great tank! Hope to run something else with you!
---
Ahh the daily, look how unique I am for taking it slow post.
---
I can run 10 bosses in about 10 minute runs. No competition, so if you’re ready to grind you can make money. And yea there’s a bunch of mirthril ore and herbs in there too
---
It's been that way for 15 years, if the items are in someone else's inventory they stay if the mage logs off.
---
"Man I really wish it didn't make you select realm every time you log in"
---
"GO BACK TO RETAIL YOU CLEARLY CAN'T HANDLE THE HARDCORE PACE OF CLASSIC"
---
Or the tank got gouged, banished, or ported away...
---
Problem is that it’s the loud and dumb folks who want to have confrontational political talks in WoW, at least in my experience. It’s generally not brilliant points delivered eloquently; it’s talking points and slogans rife with spelling and grammar errors. It’s not an edifying experience.
---
Makes sense then
---
I've reported this bug three times to blizz now, good to see it's still not fixed...
---
Back in the day my response would be
---
"This is World of Warcraft not world of welfare"
---
But it's not "literally 20 ap".
---
In lower level dungeons it is optimal to just let all the dps focus skull and not even bother tanking that one because it usually dies before it can even do anything. 
---
Thunder clap doesn't work in defensive stance so it doesn't generate that much threat so you are basically left spamming demo shout/battly cry and both don't do as much threat as tab sundering everything.
---
I've seen it 4 times. First time I was leveling with a friend and he got it, then I got it a week later from those Misty Satchel bags that dropped in MoP, and then I read in trade chat that the mount was bugged and had a 100% drop chance and being dumb I told my friend to go with me and I got the mount and gave it to him (we ran it again afterwards and as expected it did not drop), and then I got it again while leveling an alt and gave it to the person in the dungeon that was being nice throughout the run.
---
I leveled a warrior to 47 and just started a Paladin today instead. Starting from fresh, here we go!
---
Well, thats an easy report right there
---
Right. On a per-instance basis, multibox software is a 1:1 input ratio. You send one input, and it sends that same one input to each other instance. Blizzard has already been explicitly clear in their stance on the matter, this behaviour does not violate the ToS.
---
And then you'll wear cloth. Lol
---
48 Rogue, 100g, Skinning Lvl 300 and first aid 280, Lockpicking is 235 atm. Got my mount, basically only upgrade evis, ss, and stealth. Have most of the rank 1 and passive abilities atm. In almost all blue too, doing pretty good :)
---
&gt; He enjoys this game differently than you.
---
And hackers enjoy the game differently than me. Does that mean they should get a free pass for disrupting everyone elses gameplay?
---
EXXXX DEEEEEEEEE
---
People be angry
---
1. Spell batching. 
---
2. Servers inability to handle large groups of players. 
---
3. People doing mental gymnastics to justify meme specs.
---
If they get stun lock on you,  kind if hard to fear them.
---
Clearly it's your fault.
---
Gorgeous
---
I know this is off topic, but I had my name reported in retail “Chubbie” and I tried to appeal it, but Borroq said it was slang for penis and then went through my account hitting any other name that could have been “offensive” to him. Glad he was there for you, but that GM sucks. Im happy he didn’t start flagging all of your “Chubby”s names.
---
I was once in a group with 3 warriors and we looked for a tank for 30 minutes lol
---
Oh yeah, I absolutely love the druid so far. Only thing I am probably going to miss is the trusty warstomp + heal combo ^^
---
A girl walking around in a bikini does not deserved to be raped at all.  BUT she will draw tons of attention to herself. 
---
 Multiboxing does not mean you should be banned at all. BUT you are going to draw tons of attention to yourself. 
---
  Is this really that hard to grasp?  Be happy you're unbanned lol
---
I never experienced it in vanilla
---
Just reroll. Don't play a character you don't enjoy.
---
That's the plan, and thanks for the rest exp advice. I certainly try to use any advantage I can with my unique play style.
---
spam blizzard all day every day
---
even if theres only one mob, just fucking blizz them
---
This is a frequent annoyance of mine as a tank. Losing hate on the thing I have marked for you guys to attack first is kind of embarrassing but sometimes it's just easier to let you get hate and taunt after the fact than to fight for aggro on skull and end up losing hate on the others. 
---
Demo shout isn't enough to hold hate on its own even from the healer and thuncerclap doesn't seem to really help at all. Granted, I've been tanking as arms, maybe it's easier if you're actually prot specced. Either way I would much rather lose hate to one enemy than four.
---
I like it!
---
That’s not how tanking works. 
---
Your goal, and the reason you tank, is so you don’t eat consecutive crushing blows. 
---
To avoid a crushing blow, you either need to dodge, parry, or block an attack. 
---
As a face tank, you can only dodge and parry. 
---
Block, with your shield block ability up is something like 75% chance to block. 
---
So while yes, face tanking with consumables offsets the armor loss, it does nothing for crushing blow avoidance, which is what gets people killed. 
---
As a healer, if I have mage water - whatever. If I don’t have mage water... I’m noping the F out of your group.
---
I just listen to them beg for water, and leave them thirsty.
---
Can you kill The Seven when doing lava run? Afaik, the door to The Seven doesn't actually open from that side unless they're dead.
---
Some background: 
---
This guy walked by me while I was alt tabbed, and said something along the lines of “I’m sick of your shit Vrin” 
---
I came back to the game but he was gone, so being the MLG player I am, I challenged him to a duel. He was a few levels below me so he said “let’s duel when we’re both level 60, should be there by December 20th”. So we both agreed to that and a five USD bet. We continued to talk for a little while and he was actually a really nice guy. Hopefully one day he’ll return and we can have our duel!
---
Who is telling you everything is fire resistant from 30 on? The only major concentration of fireproof mobs is in molten Core, and you don't have to worry about that for ages
---
death coil once you’re not stunned
---
Yep, the only compromise seems to have people advertise if they use the "All Need" system so normal people can avoid them.
---
More likely that other people haven't said: it takes you out of combat if someone in the group pulled something
---
Yeah, this is one of my few real gripes with classic.
---
Respecs for lower level players ought to be *significantly* cheaper, specifically to allow people to experiment a bit as they learn the class
---
Maraudon is suppose to be close to 50 gold per hour. One person would be able to make as much money as all four of us\~
---
Hunters honestly.  If I get jumped, I want the fight to end with my death or theirs.  Hunters can just peace out.  Without a mount, I can't get close enough to finish the job.  They won't kill me, if equal level.  But they can keep me out of range for long enough that they can leave whenever they want.
---
It took ~3hrs for the runecloth bag pattern to respawn with no one else around. Within that time frame some of the same patterns would respawn multiple times before runecloth bag did.
---
It's what makes healing so fun!
---
Are you sure with this level of hit% gear available is it better? I read in different guides 2h is ahead right now, but I'm not that experienced
---
Its literally 20 AP on 7/10 bosses in MC and not even 0.25% more damage with perfect weave.
---
Agreed, even Skarm didn't use fury/prot until they  beat the world record for fastest naxx 40 clear, and even then he equipped a shield quite often.
---
This isnt entirely true. There are a few fights bears cant tank.
---
Yeah. Even at endgame warrior dps have BiS items that are leather.
---
&gt; and bind its howl to a macro with your aimed shot
---
This is objectively worse than simply having it on auto cast.
---
Says the guy playing a game that was solved 15 years ago :P
---
Only if you are sure they aren’t casting wrath or healing touch.
---
Currently at 32 and rising
---
Is there a bigger brainless statement than "you seem upset?". 
---
Run the dps tests for yourself if you want. Go ahead and spend 12 days played to get full pre-bis gear so you can run MC for 6 months though, I'm sure that'll be fun.
---
I'm and idiot for letting you troll me this long. Sit and spin in a discord with other 60s and jerk each other off.
---
"I guess I just suck, you should either stop doing that, leave the group, or enjoy a big repair bill."
---
hilarious in the wrong way that i know people that have sold gold and never got a ban, yet you did.
---
Are you a paladin then?
---
Maybe it’s that all those gy lib groups were doing spellcleave or meleecleave?
---
In which case for spellcleave priest is the best and for meleecleave a shaman or Paladin will be best. That’s kind of a specific minmax comp, it’s not representative of dungeon groups as a whole.
---
Don't know about you, but my druid sure as hell can skin and pick herbs in shapeshift forms.
---
Its one of the best. The first few seasons anyway. They went off for a few years and were picked back up by netflix
---
Although the pattern is BOE once made the robes are BOP.
---
The problem is that the prices are scaled for level 60, and extremely punishing for lower level new players trying to explore options
---
Druids are solid raid tanks too. Crush immune unnecessary when you take 75% reduced Phys damage.
---
I guess I'd just disagree that there are hundreds of shadow priests who are doing more right now. We've been in MC since week 2. He's got some of the highest gear in the world. But thanks for your comment.
---
Played a Holy Priest in Vanilla, can confirm this is a 95% authentic vanilla experience.  The only thing that was missing was waiting for the healer to get about 3 seconds of drinking while OOM, and then running around a corner.
---
No. Coming back to wow I get reminded just how bad dungeon groups can be. I do the exact same thing and adjust my speed as necessary for each group. I let the group know that I go slow at first and if the group needs me to speed up just say so. Been doing this since WOTLK as a raid progression tank. But, over half my dungeon groups have been DPS who don't understand threat, don't listen to me, and will wildly kite mobs all over the room and then get mad that I didn't pull the mob off of them. They always spam AOE in every situation except for single bosses.  Then at the end of the dungeon, when a weapon that will make my entire WoW experience easier, some hunter always needs and wins the roll. My last SFK run Meteor Shard dropped and the hunter instantly needed. Now I try to stick to guild runs.
---
He wanted to help but didn’t want any fanboys following him around
---
Just dinged 33.... and it's my main :-/
---
Druid. You have different forms, you can tank do’s and heal any dungeon. Lots of play styles
---
Wow, thanks a lot!
---
Just hit level 40 last night, I can now use howl of terror. Every bit of pvp I've had in classic has been without an instant cast fear
---
Mograine*
---
Razorgore
---
I keep seeing that action bar add on. What is called and what is the general benefit?
---
That's the biggest wtf of all of them. Unless there's an auto ignore function now where everyone except friends are ignored?
---
Last night I experimented with Oil of Immolation while pally tanking Gnomeragan.  So many yellow numbers with concecration &amp; ret aura.  I was easily top damage most pulls.  Going to try some dragonsbreath chilli tonight. :D
---
Video did say he started running before he even said go.
---
Yeah. Main's 37 and I got a half dozen 20-somethings around.
---
I feel like you could have handled this better with the supervisor, especially the part about him keeping you from dinner while also barraging him with questions.
---
Of course, that's ingame gold as well.   
---
Not only is selling gold agaisnt the rules, but ya know, if it was four people doing gold farming, it would be more effective for us all to be doing mauradon and getting 200gold an hour than a roleplay guild of summons.
---
Wow, sounds like a great tank. Which dungeon was this? I've had 2 warrior tanks, a shaman, and a druid so far that I ran dungeons with. All have been pretty good so my experience has been pretty solid.
---
By no means is Shaman Tanking easy, if you want to do it properly read up on it first https://classic.wowhead.com/guide=7995/comprehensive-guide-to-shaman-tanking a whole guide devoted just to it.
---
That's fine!
---
But make it a Classic+ server. Leave the Classic ones alone, and if someone wants to migrate from Classic to Classic+, they can.
---
I am in the same position, recipe in hand. Trying to decide if drop my 300 herbalism in favor of levelling tailoring and crafting the robe, before getting the epic mount.
---
yup, our server was full at the start.  Now it seems mostly dead.   Blizz fucked up and made too many servers.
---
Herod and Bigglesworth seem to be the source of all of the horror stories.
---
One of the highlights for this game to me is when the team "gels", knows their roles, and we surpass overwhelming odds.  
---
Fighting a big pack, and a pat comes by and crashes the party? Everyone knows what to do. Tank grabs aggro, targets are marked, DPS focuses them down and the healer paces heals to sustain through the fight. It's a real "Work together or die" mentality. After the fight is over and everyone is OOM but alive, thinking "we did it!" is awesome and I love it.
---
As a warrior tank I do cherry pick who will come to a run simply so I can make sure that if my stuff drops I'm the only one who is going to roll need on it. But I don't care about spellcleave and such.
---
On my lunch break and I joined layer
---
If it tells me when people join the channel does that mean I created it? :o
---
Haven't had the need to change layers
---
I play on a 4glte mifi exclusively no problems but pick a server close to you.
---
I have mostly happens in caves.
---
But mage one is solo farmable by mages and rogues &gt;.&gt;
---
If your main concern is 5-mans, Paladins are more than fine and in some cases, ideal.
---
&gt; If you don't complain about groups of 5 independent people killing you in PvP, you can't really complain when 5 characters controlled by 1 person kill you.
---
I dunno dude, I'm pretty good at complaining.
---
I'm conflating one character to one person because that's the ratio the entire game was designed around. No matter your feelings on it, multiboxing is by definition an exploit (despite the fact that Blizz tolerates it), and can be used by ONE PERSON to gain the single-target killing power of FIVE PEOPLE, if you feel like burning a truly dumb amount of money. You don't see a problem with that, balance-wise?
---
The number of people controlling X characters is absolutely relevant. Five separate people playing five separate characters don't have the level of coordination that one person cloning commands to five characters has. Plus there's the fact you're not addressing: multibox WPVP is so low-effort that it literally takes a boxer 1-2 button presses to kill an equally-leveled opponent. Press one button, cast five spells, and your target is a fine pink mist. No effort, no skill required. All you need is enough money to sustain X subscriptions, and access to keycloning software. These players are only killable if multiple other players gang up on them, and no one player should have all that power if you ask me - not without actually earning it through effort and skill like the rest of us.
---
Look, all due respect, we're not going to agree on this - it seems like you're probably a multiboxer yourself (either that or you've never been repeatedly corpse-camped by one), and like I said, I can respect the level of skill it takes to run PVE content like that. I just think that they're an extremely toxic presence in WPVP. You're probably not going to change my mind on that - I've seen the level of trolling they can get up to first-hand, and it fucking sucks to play with.
---
Extended Character Stats
---
Uhh if I’m in a pug and an upgrade drops for me, unless I’m feeling incredibly benevolent I’m going to be rolling for it. 
---
Exceptions would only really be for pre-raid BiS gear for someone else that I don’t really intend to use. 
---
If HoJ drops, I’m rolling. I don’t care if someone in the party still has carrot on a stick on in the dungeon because they don’t have another trinket lol. 
---
If an epic boe drops and the group has decided that equip&gt;everything, if it’s better than what I have equipped right now I’m gonna roll.
---
Are you lost or something? 
---
The clip I'm talking about is rogue warrior lock priest mage. That isn't spell cleave. Yeah, if you're running spellcleave in ZF a tank might be unnecessary, but at no point have I said anything about spell cleave. Rules in spell cleave runs dont apply to normal groups, and if you think they do your tank hates you and probably will have blacklisted you from ever joining any run they go on again.
---
Druid. You can tank dps and heal any dungeon easily. Lots of play stiles and forms to keep you interested
---
Blows my mind that they are allowed.  Have a couple on my server. One was 5 lvl-42 rogues. He can one-shot even level 60s with backstab. Absurd.
---
If you are equipping the shield at the same time as the stance change you trigger a gcd.  The stance change by itself with no weapon/shield changes and no other abilities being activated does not trigger a gcd.
---
Could be he's also just wanting a nap, and is reminding us to wake him up before we gogo.
---
Honestly as someone who ran a shaman in Vanilla, they could tank up until level 40-45 ish. Multi-target was tricky but I remember easily tanking RFD. That was around patch 1.6-1.7. We're in 1.12 and after all the class buffs (which started with warriors in 1.6), and changes to everything that isn't as viable anymore. It could be the guide creators played it years ago and had that same expectation but in reality 1.6-1.7 and 1.12 is a far cry from 1.12.
---
Yes I knew I needed training/ quest for next skill cap. Didnt know from which npc though. Thanks!
---
My buddy made a guy named TwatWaffle. Not very cleaver but made me chuckle
---
Bear down for midterms.
---
You can

Atiesh Alliance
---
Absolutely evil...
---
...catch me at 60 pulling this shit
---
Warlocks only get renew
---
You must be in some pretty bad groups if stuff is dying so slow that dots are outdpsing shadowbolt spam.
---
100% this, I'm a rogue and won't pick a fight with a pally. I'll go at it if they start it but other than that, nah
---
I healed this random rogue when he was low health so he said "thx." Next pull he pulled 5 then typed "heal" and I left the area. We weren't in a group. He whispered me "rez" then cuss words after he died lol. No thanks.
---
Frost Mage
---
And even beyond that.  My buddy is a 60 warrior who has tanked everything except for Ony and MC as Arms/Fury.  He has a sword &amp; board for tougher packs but mostly it's just an AOE fest... and it is beautiful.
---
I'm pretty sure beast leave is a BM Hunter, enh shaman and holy paladin. The shaman has the 2 wolves and the hunter can enrage his pet. It was truly a scary comp with great cc, burst cooldowns and overall tankiness
---
Strikes me as a Gnome Mage for some reason, am I close? They don't have to be clever names to get a laugh and be memorable, just catch you off guard at the right time, lol.
---
Some hermit mage, her story was never expanded.
---
The biggest theory was she was Aegwyn in disguise, its been a long time since ive read the lore, but i think she "died" in or around Theramore and she seemed to fit the description. I think theyve since rewritten it and confirmed they arent the same person though
---
if you want to tank, don't go pally.  it's doable, but not sought after.  10 is not a good level to get a feel for the classes.  My general suggestion in this case:  go druid.  You can do all things, just not the best.
---
Neat, my guilds bear is #70
---
Keep scrolling you will see it
---
Oh no. I think you damaged his ego. Rip ego
---
Alright man aint gunna keep trying to get it through if you dont understand what im saying. Its literally no different than greeding a bis boe that a guildmate can need, so he can use it even though I could use the money as well. You make sacrifices to make the guild better, not just yourself, if your guild doesnt do that then you may want to find another
---
That is a demon hunter in D3.
---
I'll cross they bridge when I get to it. I have no doubts that someone will ninja an item eventually. But I need to have some hope.
---
" 5 people playing 5 characters would take less time. "
---
lol and you call my argument ass? that's 5 independent people doing the work of one dude with a credit card.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Maybe.
---
Holy paladin
---
Honestly, I forget what level you get mocking blow, but I had the best luck in vanilla when I was able to bloodlust, charge (obviously in battlestance), t-clap, mocking-blow on skull (which is a battlestance-only taunt-strike which is often parried/dodged but forces a target to attack the warrior for 8 sec), switch to defensive stance, start my tab/sunders, once everything had one sunder, demo-shout/battleshout, keep tab/sunder, then IF anything ran off, I could still taunt it with a mouseover macro, and I usually never lost aggro, especially if I had enough rage to dump heroic strike on skull.
---
In later levels, once I got shieldslam (I went prot around 56 iirc, to farm BRD/LBRS), and if I could hit skull with that I would almost never lose anything, so long as everyone wasn't blasting AOE right off the bat.
---
Fact is, a lot of warriors are terrified to use battlestance while tanking. This is because it generates less threat and they take more damage. The upside, though, is you get more rage, you can use t-clap for AOE threat on 4 targets, you slow their attacks, you can still use overpower (if the add dodges) and you can spam cleave/heroic strike if you have the rage to dump. This isn't AS effective as defensive stance, for obvious reasons. However, if they need to hold aggro on multiple targets, this is actually sometimes better than sitting in defensive stance, rage-starved, hoping for a chance to become the hero.
---
shamans can run on water but yeh its trash unless you only go for the water essence pools,  i think later phases the price of other stuff like blackmouth and stoneskin fish will go up but on my server theyre almost worthless.  definitly a more druid favored farm method however
---
&gt; only shaman would make any sense because they can use a shield, have increased armor from talents and fire damage reduction from talents also.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They also have melee attacks while the hunter has effectively 1 and also rockbiter increases their threat.
---
&gt; Hunter would never be able to hold aggro even if somehow they survived a breath.
---
I've been a Hunter Raid tank successfully making my way up t'ill AQ. So I know a great deal about this and can answer your questions.
---
Hunter Tanks tend to gravitate more toward agility and stamina.
---
Hunter Tank are suggest on Alliance (BoP, Devotion aura, etc...). Threat/aggro isn't a huge deal if you put in the right amount of effort. If you manage to get tfury it enables you to keep up with threat with others in AQ.
---
im a female dwarf, enough said.
---
No shit
---
Honestly I'm just starting to avoid all mages.
---
From what I’ve seen, even if they use Tuk/Elv, most people still disable the built in bag system and use a different bag addon like bagnon or adibags.
---
Judging by your post, no, you aren’t alone. People are everywhere
---
If it is then I am wrong. I don’t research much but I know armor is one of your most important mitigation stats as a Druid. 
---
I read 75% or just over 17k at 60. 
---
Maybe it is higher for mobs that are higher level then you, don’t know my dude.
---
If you know jackshit about this game, shut the fuck up.
---
Oh sweet boost my odds. ;)
---
Running BFD as healer priest with my wife who is moderately casual and still learning her hunter. Warrior tank is pulling 4-5 mobs at a time and staying in the entry instead of pulling back. DPS Warrior is attacking everything except what the tank is. Admittedly my wife is still learning to control her pet and needs a bit of practice but when it pulls a group because of a fleeing mob they go completely toxic on her blaming her and asking me to find a new dps. I tell them to chill and maybe give a little pull back and concentrate on 3 mobs instead of five. They listen for one fricken area and then do the same thing and the same thing happens. They start cursing, blame us, and quit making my wife feel like shit. We’ll see if I get her back into BFD.
---
Thankfully though most of the PuGs have been ok. These bros were just dicks.
---
You could summon him at any level but he is level 60, I remember making the walk on like 12 alts and parking them outside SM so for a group you get 5 chances 1 summon per group member then I would drop group and be invited on my alt the whole group gets another chance at the mount and you get a chance that you otherwise wouldn't have based on level.
---
Yep, finding the guild will be the hard part since very very few people will look for meme specs. Having up to date professions with valuable patterns makes you more valuable, though the established guilds will probably already have people.
---
Esfand
---
The floorplan is released a month before always. Which is first week of October. More specifically, on a Tuesday or Wednesday the last two times. October 2nd and 3rd last time.
---
I'm actually not sure myself, so you could be right. If this works, could be insanely good for healers trying to get the mace &amp; offhand from Seven, while rest of the group has good loot from Emp/Princess.
---
Quite possibly.
---
Pretty sure in raids you are a healer, and maybe maybe an off tank depending on raid comp. I play a Prot pally to tank which is a very dumb build to some people, yet I do fine in what I do. In raids I heal. You can do lots as a Druid but every class has its best and worst spec. Finding a raid group that will let you dps Druid is hard. Play what you want, how you want and you will find a group that will raid and pvp with you.
---
Spinal is the second best weapon an orc warrior can get in phase 1. Only thing better is Deathbringer and its not exactly dropping like candy. I'd take a spinal in a heart beat and never look back on my orc. And I would top meters with it guaranteed. 2Hander is very, very close to DW right now horde side. 
---
It takes a long time to get the gear you need out of MC for all your melee. Just because MC is easy doesn't mean we shouldnt prepare our raid group for harder content that we know is coming. Also, loot is already very scarce for melee in MC, as you pointed out in your post. If people start giving melee BiS to enhance shamans "because content is easy", good melee players just leave the guild. 
---
As for the whole "I am a try hard enhance shaman thats better than a flaky resto", well you are assuming we have flaky restos. Thats more an argument for replacing your troublesome resto shaman than for taking an enhance. I don't have issues finding enough competent resto shamans that I need to take a meme spec and give him gear so he can still do 0 dmg.  But yea, you can take an enhance if hes a good guy or whatever. He just shouldn't expect to get equal prio on melee dps gear as an actual melee dps. Hes a support.
---
I'm in the opposite camp. I leveled the warrior to 60 and am struggling to level my alt, only 7 after 2 weeks.
---
So glad I'm not playing this game
---
I hit 60 with 1162g as a rogue who mob grinded almost the entire way to 60.
---
Lol these are all so great.  Like an intimate look into the mind of an idiot.
---
Every other pull.
---
What is AoE?
---
You'll hear mixed messages about druids. Someone more qualified could tell you about viability, but I'd only listen to actual druid mains. What I can tell you is that druids are suuuuper versatile and suuuper fun.
---
I think focus target would be a HUGE qol improvement. but i dont want it. even though it would be so nice to have
---
Layers are the size of servers in vanilla. This is the vanilla experience
---
&gt; I also realized that the Big Iron Fishing Pole also auctions pretty well, on the Neutral AH, since Alliance can't get Nat's Extreme Angler. 
---
This as well! An easy Gold per, though I guess that depends on your server. Even if you don't want to AH, it's ~33-38s per, which is fine or a quick vendor.
---
[Every time I see comments like this.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/242/949/b91.jpg)
---
Oh nah I didn’t say that. ~90% of raid boss fights they are very competent tanks (aside from fights like Nefarion and Chromagus and such). But this idea that they are ONLY relegated to being offtanks because they’re just “worse” than warriors is just blatantly untrue
---
Mine disappear on their own. Try toggling move UI on and off?
---
I'm really surprised it doesn't automatically turn off when in dungeons or even just in a group, that should be really easy to do.
---
No for more than like 2 mobs because then you might pull the one you are frostbolting. Just sit and wait the extra 3 seconds
---
Evil :(
---
Mage is the new Hunter... Hunter is the new Mage
---
Of all the possibilities in the universe, that's unlikely. Going with the odds here... it's an odd person.
---
That stop watch is great, helped me catch a mage that blinked away
---
You can, you just won't be as effective as a non shadow spec.
---
Thunderclap isn't a good threat generating ability in Vanilla. It requires battlestance and generates 180 AoE threat at max rank. Battle Shout is better since it can be done in defensive stance and will generate 385 AoE threat at max rank.
---
Any idea about the clock?
---
Strength gives 2 AP per point.
---
Agi gives approximately .05% crit per point, among some miniscule armor/dodge.
---
Obviously you can draw your own conclusions, but you should be prioritizing secondary stats before either.
---
But it wasn't released without any changes, and they picked patch 1.12 over any others. Stop pretending like there is a definitive/singular definition of what classic means.
---
I ran into a hunter named Dangeroushah a while back. I don't know why, but it struck me as funny.
---
So you connect to your phones hotspot? I am doing this atm and the connection seems very spotty I am wondering if getting a hotspot device will make a difference. Thanks for the tip will do
---
Absolutely, that guide is complete trash.  I'm almost to 60 and used the same stat priority that you've outlined in this thread.
---
This was hilarious, stop downvoting.
---
I've heard it's changed (at work can't verify) but the old warlock guide, prior to launch and for a few weeks after, suggested that players skip both the Felhunter and the Succubus quests and almost exclusively use the Voidwalker to level with.
---
Which is absurd to anyone who played Vanilla.  When you get the Voidwalker, he holds aggro.  When you get gear and talents (like 5 levels later), he holds aggro like water in a wet paper bag.  Meaning not at all.  His only use is to buy you time between applying your dots and either shadowbolt/wand/drain life spam.  DPS as a warlock means your voidwalker is crap.
---
Additionally, there is this 'build' being suggested that warlocks should favor spirit and spec into improved drain soul, like you are some sort of priest with spirit tap.  Which completely ignores how a warlock plays and values his gear.  Not to mention that to gain value from imp ds, you have to rely on your dots and blueberry to massage the last few points of damage from the mob.
---
Finally, the guide had zero mention of drain tanking.  Which was one of the most popular leveling builds in vanilla.
---
The author had zero idea of what playing a warlock on a live server was like and never thought to question the 'experience' gained from private servers.
---
Warlocks
---
Thats some damn good advice, thanks bud!
---
About respeccing at 60. 
---
I've been a Holy Pally Tank since level 10 and haven't encountered any issues at all.   I Heal raids and Tank 5 mans during the day.  I even Tank 5 man Rend runs in UBRS for friends.
---
[Here's my Talent build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/50450120521051-05320133) Those last three talent points are unspent because I'm not sure which I like more between the +6 Defense, -15second cooldown on HoJ, or +12% Holy Light.  All seem really useful to me so I haven't been able to decide...
---
People say that "You will never be a Warrior." And that's true, but there are a lot of options that give you an advantage.  Switching to Concentration Aura then giving myself a Divine Favor Holy Light is a formidable "Tanking Cooldown"  And I never have to stop to drink in Undead dungeons because 1 Exorcism and a Rank 1 or 2 Consecration is enough to hold aggro on any Undead mob until it dies.  
---
The only times I really feel limited are when a boss has a threat drop mechanic that other tanks solve with their Taunts, like the Butcher in Scholo, but with Blessings of Protection, Sacrifice, and spot healing I can easily keep whoever has to offtank him alive.
---
So intentionally picking a spot that looks crappy is bad, but intentionally picking a spot that looks nice is fine?
---
A lot Of Epeening
---
They had 13 years, patch notes and stored patch code to fix this.
---
Don't give the devs any slack.
---
Intellect so you can totem twist for the real DPS Mr.Nightfall.
---
What is perfectly fine about being the only class required to spend a talent point on the only weapon sets that make enhance viable? Why is that okay to you? You’d rather have that than be like any other class and pay a small one time fee?
---
You will always remember this as the day that you almost caught captain. jack. sparrow.
---
We don't deserve priests
---
silver, gold, and truesilver keys are all around 10s each give or take (on Faerlina-Alliance at least) and will open up to lvl 224.  But for 225+ you need an arcanite key which costs about 20g each.
---
I think for the first 3 the cost is low enough to just roll and call it a day but for arcanite I think the BS gets it if their going to use that key or the group needs to pitch in at least 4g a piece if they want to roll on it.
---
\*Might also be worth noting that keys do take up an inventory space and need to be restocked
---
Humans at the time were killing undead on sight and made no difference between mindless zombie and Forsaken.
---
Sylvanas also pushed the narrative of they are no longer human, no longer alive, and have no need for emotions anymore. All they need is purpose, which at the time was vengeance on the Lich King and eradicating the humanity rejecting their existence. However it is clearly bullshit, to which many of the Forsaken were getting more and more aware.  
---
At the end of BFA Sylvanas too stated that despite her efforts the Forsaken held onto hope and life.
---
I honestly farmed the earths, airs, and fires and bought the waters I believe and some of the earths actually. I spent about 300g total between parent and materials.
---
It does not.
---
Thanks for the response, so do you think it's worth it if I can to get a mobile hotspot device? Or just hotspot through my phone
---
Be a real man and take the hammer!
---
Multi boxing should be bannable anyway. Suck it up
---
I agree, but I feel like pallies get some good talents pretty early.  By level 30 you can take 3 Healing Light, 5 Illumination, and Divine Favor. That's a lot of help.
---
Though to be fair, most people don't level as healing specs.
---
I am nowhere near 60... on my 2nd alt.
---
But from what I am aware Felwood.
---
I think I was remembering from TBC. Google says 20.7k against a raid boss (lvl 63)
---
I thought druids needed the AQ gear with bonus armor to hit cap, maybe it's easier than I remember
---
This should be bannable on pvp servers.
---
As a combat rogue, I can say you're missing the second mob, which is required for TRUE satisfaction.
---
You haven't grouped with anyone from &lt;Sabotage&gt; yet apparently. 😂
---
If I remember to.
---
&gt; Fuck you if you're just going to do it and expect the group to be able to keep up though
---
Mages clearly said Ready which meant the party knew he was about to pull because they talked about.
---
Fuck you retard.
---
Hunters who know how to work that deadzone give me nightmares.
---
Unsure about alliance, but you can/should be running  dungeons around your level. Run them at least once in order to do the quests. You shouldn't need to buy gear off the auction house especially if you are doing dungeons. Maybe you could buy gear after you get your mount but you shouldn't need to buy it in order to play the game. it will usually be replaced within 5ish levels unless you are spending 30g+ after level 45.
---
Saw a guy spamming trade in Grom'gol for a portal to undercity....

Not having enough time to play! 😁
---
What do you do against warlocks? Those are my only problem as a druid.

I guess so . I wouldn’t know the timescale though.

I don't know what that has to do with anything.

Defcamp and Melderon Youtube is a gold mine of information for shamans. They break down all the numbers if you'd like to watch. I'm linking you to the advanced shaman guide that came out a month ago.

Warlock is dying, warlocks fault. The lock needs to learn how to not pull threat from tank.
---
Sounds like the group didn't decide, as the OP had no say in it, the others in their group simply needed on everything. They're scum.
---
Which is exactly what you'd do if you wanted to GY port?
---
Yeah, been testing 2H vs 1H warrior skills, and the cost is pissing me off. I'm at about 30g thrown away on getting things right, and they're still not right. :(
---
Holy shit dude thank you so much. Clique is so great I can’t believe I was using Vuhdo this whole time.
---
Has it been affecting your gameplay or are you going off the statistic only? I'm Ally on stalagg and I'm curious what everyone thinks
---
From Google it sounds like it was changed in 1.12.1. As for why they chose the way it was prior to that, we don't know. That's just the way they decided it would be. There are a bunch of other similar decisions that they made. Whether they will later add a patch to change how mounts work to the 1.12.1 version, we also have no idea.
---
I did this! Had a gnome rogue originally, had fun. Needed swiftthistle but took up my fav prof. (Mine/eng) so couldn't get myself and the AH price is insane. Around lvl 30 I realised nobody wants a rogue in their grp so I made a pally with herb/alch to farm swifthistle.
---
Fucking loooooooved pally. He is now lvl 41, 245 alch / 250 herb, mounted (obv), pretty good gear too. Still sending swiftthistle but the rogue has now become a twink awaiting battlegrounds.

People are learning with how servers are so large, reputation actually doesn't mean as much as you think. This isn't the classic you remember.

Seriously! I've had a shitty afternoon and just LOL'ed at this.
---
Should be more than powerful enough to handle the game... tried a fresh install yet? Tweaking some of the graphic settings ?
---
Your kind makes me sick, have an upvote
---
This feels the exact same for us on the alliance side too. My entire levelling experience I never had fair fight once. Either a) Im tanking 3 mobs when I get ganked, b) get ganked by a full 5man group, or c) get ganked by someone 10+ lvls higher than me. 
---
If I ever encountered another player my level and neither of us were half dead, we would always just /wave and keep questing. 
---
Now I'm a heavy PvP player and I pretty much only came back for PvP, but I don't care for it at LVL 38 in STV when it's already a struggle finding quest items. 
---
Some people just NEED to quench that thirst of feeling better than someone else, even if the fight they picked was heavily swayed in their favor (or completely impossible to lose) so they can /flex infront of their friends.
---
Apparently OP created an alt to post about this but is using his main account to reply to people who disagree. Wow...
---
"Patch Day, no play!"
---
Perfect

Im stuck between playing a warrior or a rogue  , i know both of them are really hard to level , im looking to play pve as well as pvp . For the rogue i was wondering how durable will i be in pvp (i know they are super op in open world pvp) and how easy would it be to find a raid compared to the warrior (i dont mind tanking or offtanking
---
As for the warrior i kinda enjoy leveling (im lvl 17) but i can see its kinda slow so i was wondering when will it get better , also how well do they do in world pvp and bgs compared to the rogue . Thanks!:)
---
Oh?  Which one?
---
Why?
---
I multibox two characters.  
---
I've never cheated anyone out of anything; unless you think you get to demand my time or something.  
---
I do the same things other players do, and more often than not, I'm more inclusive of bringing other players into a group than a lot of the "fuck you, got mine" crowd, of which doesn't get discussed here, but certainly exists.
---
What experience am I cheating you out of?  I don't PvP, and when I do, I certainly won't be dual boxing as a result.  I'm not contesting your position in an instance group because anyone worth doing the instance with; is going to prefer two people focused on one thing rather than one person focused on two.
---
Do I contest resource nodes for you?  I don't any more than one person with two gathering professions does.  
---
Do I "took ur jerbs" to ya?  
---
No, no I don't.  You don't sound like the type of person I'd group with for long anyway.  I'd prefer the silence to be honest.
---
"It's Cheating"  How so?
---
"It's P2W"  Again, how?  It doesn't do anything markedly different (and almost always less efficiently) than a group of players.
---
Me rolling a healer/warrior combo while leveling does absolutely fuck-all to you.
---
I mean yeah, that’s what talents are. Specialized class skills, *not* the ability to use weapons. No weapons are locked behind talents for ANY classes....except shaman. Yes, I have. It’s trash after level 30....lol
---
Thank you. So you suggest I go with TMobile? I also am looking into the Verizon LTE 4g Broadband. But I don't know much about this stuff and I don't know if you need an ISP for that
---
if you are in a serious guild you are gonna be pissing all over these raids anyway, that debuff slot is not going to matter
---
I know right !
---
What makes arms better in phase 2?
---
His thoughts on how taunt works is what triggered me.
---
Ret Paladins are ok at PvP, but remember you are still a support role. You wont be destroying people with damage, instead you will use your blessing, stuns and healing spells at the right moment on the right target. 
---
The problem is that Holy usually does this better than ret.
---
Yeah, I heard the "clique" referenced from our guild from a hunter who is constantly asking, for groups already underway and often at the end, if there's any room for him. Like yeah dude we just did this run with 3 people just in case anyone asked. And then when you're done and try to see if they still want to, suddenly they don't anymore. It's really bizarre.
---
Whether or not the team is capable of spread pressure has really little to do with whether or not it's termed a cleave. I honestly don't know if there's a distinction between a cleave and a comp with a "real" name. I *think* it originally denoted a team with melee dps and the rest of the names came after. 
---
So yeah, a "cleave" in common WoW vernacular just means "a group with this specific comp, or something pretty close to it"
---

Is there any addon you can use that will show mining routes in game?
---
Shamans in theory can tank just fine. The real issue is lack of a solid taunt and mail itemization for tanking. They would have operated kinda like blood dk's higher dmg but squishy tanks that would benefit from shields considering the high threat from spells and autos.
---
Dominos and Bartender both do that. I'd guess Bartender from the beer icon on the minimap. They let you customize your action bars - move them, change their size, page them (so one bar switches to the abilities of a different bar based on some input like a keypress or a form change like shadowform), change how many abilities can be held in them, etc.
---
The only weird part is that they kept the default action bar UI despite its lack of filled slots.
---
Yeah you’re right I’m fairly positive. Can’t sell containers with objects in them minus regular lock boxes for rogues to pick
---
I learned that the hard way. I thought to myself, hey these guys drop both the items I need for two different quests. It's gonna be Super Efficient! NOPE! lol.
---
Also 5 days of learning the ins/outs of another class makes it easier to fight them in PvP!!
---
A Dwarf named “Classic” who was in a guild called &lt;The Wait Is Over&gt;. I got on the menethil harbor boat with him and everyone started throwing emotes at him like “X loves Classic”.
---
In non-terrible groups I can get away with drinking while the tank engages the next pack, then cast a big heal on them while spamming drink, then start drinking again.
---
That sounds delightful. Please tell me they have to tab over to each account and line them up together to play again.
---
It's solid in PVP. It usually procs pretty quickly.
---
Except when you try to settle on a 1H dual weapon spec, but then a really good 2H weapon drops and you're dropping another pile of gold on re-specs.
---
Feels good to play on EU RP, it feels very busy in the cities, group finding is fast but no queues, farmspots are still not too packed and no ninjas! Ofc the server is the first one to die, but no overpopulation problems atleast
---
In my experience there's no difference in signal strength between a phone and the mobile hotspot device. They both rely on cell signal and will be good or bad depending on the quality of that signal. If your phone plan allows a good amount of hotspot, I'd use that because it's cheaper. Be wary of "unlimited" and read the fine print. My service throttles the speed waaaay down (unplayable) if I exceed my monthly limits. So that's why I'm on the 30gb hotspot plan. I play a lot and average around 20-22GB a month, but I don't use hotspot for anything but WoW.
---
You don't know that its 70%
---
An excellent swap if you do PVP, but if you're not, Nature's Grasp isn't all that strong.
---
Yeah I turned it on in interface options yesterday. You can check what types of things you want to pop up and which direction / color etc. There’s probably ways to get better info with an add on but it seems to work just fine with the built in version
---
It isn't possible, I tried a couple days ago
---
I've stuck an ice teap in front of the tank and used that for some CC, but the duration on ice teap is so short it's almost not worth it.

I find it more reliable to just swap cower for growl and send my pet to off tank stray mobs if they're chewing on me or the healer.

How many hours would you guess 111 trunks took to acquire?

Any good sites for addons? All i can find are curse and legacywow. Legacywow is pretty limited and curse doesnt seem to filter for 1.13.

Agreed. 
---
&gt; Hunter is the new Mage

Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Hunters are still taking plenty of loot that probably shouldn't go to them.
---
No reliable slow, no gap closer and and no mortal strike. I find rets are just a special breed that dont support anyone around them, ie freedoms, dispels etc.

If you hold shift when you mine, you won't even loot the first ore.  Infinite number of people can level up off the same node.

If you have all BiS, what gear could you possibly want?
---
"you think you do, but you don't." Really kinda seemed like they had zero idea people actually wanted classic wow, tbh. Even the lack of servers was a huge indicator that they had zero idea how many people wanted it.
---
You might be healing too soon, then. Someone should have a little threat before you have to heal. If the tank is going down so fast that you have to generate that much threat that quickly then the problem isnt you.. Its the tank.
---
You mean AoE groups that are giving people the wrong impression of how to actually do a dungeon? See how well those spell cleave refined skills help in a BWL raid. It's better, especially for newer players, to learn how to do dungeons the traditional way because it sets them up to succeed at raiding.
---
Yea IDK what that dude is on you definitely shouldn't be buying every skill as you level up.  That's just garbage advice lol.  Like I'm gonna keep buying ranks of ambush and backstab while I'm leveling up as a combat rogue?  Or higher ranks of kick which don't add anything except for an extra 15 damage?  Bro c'mon.
---
Be frugal with your skills until you get your mount then you can go all in on them after and experiment all you want.

Charge - BLIZZARD - challenging - retaliation - defensive - tab-sunder spam until everything dead, then kick the mage.

I want this experience again so badly it hurts. The fact that not only were the quests useful, they were almost necessary - made everyone feel like they mattered. Hell, even capturing a mine early could make or break the game!

You have to dip into it as Feral for Omen of Clarity.

Balance as a tree is good, it's just not that good by itself. It modifies the spells that it's supposed to quite well, just the actual moonkin form kind of sucks. It's better to do like Elemental Shamans do and go 30/0/21 for Nature's Swiftness
---
Unless by down you mean up the chains, which at that point you need to ask, am I running across this chain just to jump down and take a bunch of damage anyways, and just wasting 30 seconds of my time? That's also the exit so I dont know what the fuck your on about but being a sarcastic dickhead doesnt make your point any more valid

That's basically what the job is. Healer keeps tank alive. Tank keeps healer alive. DPS keeps themselves alive.

There was a [Joe Rogan interview](https://youtu.be/6G59zsjM2UI?t=2284) that talked about a subset of the population, usually males, who are predisposed to aggressive behaviors upon others. At a young age, you can easily identify them in a crowd of children. They are the ones who kick, attack, harm other kids. These aggressive behaviors give them pleasure and make sense in the context of evolutionary biology (cave man alpha males, or soldiers for the warriors caste).
---
In modern times, these children are socialized by society, their parents, and the education system. They learn at a young age to behave "appropriately" as dictated by the majority who are not like them. By the time these people reach adulthood, they have been taught how to channel their aggressive behaviors towards productive goals, and many are found in leadership positions. The vast majority of them know that their aggressive instincts against other people in society are not tolerated. They know that they cannot do certain things even when it brings pleasure to them.
---
Then you have a portion of these people who start playing WoW (or PvP games in general). They quickly find that not only are these anti-social behaviors permitted, they are encouraged. It's like a miracle to them, a place where they can finally indulge in something that was denied to them their entire life. A place that they can finally be themselves. 
---
I don't fault them for being what they are and what they do. They had no choice in the matter for being born that way. The game system actively promotes said anti-social behavior (taking pleasure in the suffering of others). I blame the system for not allowing feedback from the social-empathetic players (who make up the bulk of society) to enact punishment and negative reinforcement upon them. On top of that, Social-empathetic players are outnumbered in pvp servers, because of selection bias. Further still, the horde always outnumbers alliance in pvp servers, because the horde attracts "aggressive" players with their backstory and monsterous races.
---
So it comes as no surprise this horde player on a PvP server indulges in schadenfreude.
---
&gt;God he must have been seething. Now that is what PVP is all about.
---
This very candid testimonial clearly shows the nature of the player. PvP is about honorable duels and sportsmanship, but he twists it to serve his own needs of enjoying the suffering of others. The more suffering, the better. This is confirmed by his ignorance of how shameful this admission is (by posting it on reddit and publically touting his "glorious" acts). At the end of the day, I'm happy he can find an outlet in WoW for these socially-negative urges. At least hes not kidnapping people off the streets and torturing them in his basement while reveling in his victims screams of pain.
---
Seems like they meant to post about Princess in Mara lol

I wouldn't admit that in public.
---
well at end game, min maxing and setting goals is what makes mmos fun imo
---
Yeah I didn’t consider the PvP side of it arms is definitely better. And having rage while stance dancing can’t be beat especially to switch over to defensive for a shield bash.
---
Personally my favorite to play was the Ret pally with a minor in Holy. You were constantly dropping small flash heals and could never be taken below half health. Dropping the hammer on them was the best too.
---
If they’re bad. The health required for blood rage is negligible at worst...
---
As a priest though, sometimes people with good intentions really do mess you up.
---
This is mostly due to the talent Spirit Tap, which most priests take for leveling and gives you a *big* mana regen boost if you get the killing blow on a mob that yields experience. Meaning that you often don't have to drink for a long time if you use a proper dps rotation. So many times I've had a mob at really low health and then have someone come by and "finish it off" for me, making me lose my spirit tap proc and making me use more water.
---
Once had to whisper a hunter to stop doing this as we were questing in the same area and it was happening repeatedly. Like most people, he had no idea though and didn't know that he was forcing me to miss my mana regen proc.
---
As a warrior tank I disagree. I essentially type up a damn symphony every big pull and I'm more used to instant AOE from the entire group which then ragequits after two wipes. I haven't had a group last in any dungeon after a 2nd wipe. I always get blamed but 2 stacks of sunder + taunt don't even pull off 1 mob off.. for reference I'm well geared for my level, have more macros than I have spells, and I'm an experienced player..
---
I’m on Grobbulus!
---
Oh ok that looks like,  61.46g
---
Just did this quest 5 min ago with a homie I got into the game a week ago. *wipes tears* they grow up so fast.
---
Yeah, theres a lot of good alts though :) seems the people of reddit just love using their phones to take videos and pictures of their screens lol
---
Ah, pretty clever. I do love when people combo their guild names with their character name as well. I've seen people paying for signatures then kicking everyone that signed just to get a funny guild name to go along with their character name.
---
Hahahaha
---
You can’t whirlwind in defensive stance...
---
Druid, Priest, Mage or Warlock
---
Lock - I used to life drain tank back in the day and loved the survivability and multi-tool demons. Plus fear and mount. Leveld to end game content in wotlk-mop. 
---
Druid - ive leveld 3 of these to end game content in tbc, wotlk, and cata/MoP. Always a special place in my heart and can literally do anything 
---
Mage - love the travel and utility and love the idea of stringing together the perfect chain of spells to unleash hell (novs, fs, coc, blizzard) but it feels a little less dimensional and over populated
---
Priest - never played one to lvl 20. Kinda want to try something new, love. The idea of MC and shadow pwnsge but not sure it fits with what i wanna do right off the bat maybe an alt
---
Ultimately i want world PvP and do AV with the ability to dungeon relatively easily. And maybe a raid or two.
---
Thoughts? What should i start as?
---
My druid is calling my name for its sneakyness dungeon utility and versatility, but i feel like he's lacking firepower to nuke someone or be able to easily PuG raids.
---
It's been allowed for literally 15 years I think it's safe to say it's not changing.
---
When a tank charges and hits one mob, he has about 100-200 threat on that one mob.  He has ZERO threat on the other mobs.  Even 1 hp of damage or healing will pull those other mobs.
---
Demoralizing shout puts about 50 threat on all the mobs.  So if you do 65 damage, you pulled the mob.
---
If you wait for one sunder on all mobs, you will pull mobs off the tank at about 500 damage.
---
&gt; I have definitely punched people for being blatant assholes.
---
Never our best moments, are they?
---
That said, how many of those punches do you regret?
---
HIGHLY recommend skinning while leveling any character, especially right now while the game is young. Lower tier leather is usually just vendor trash, but those coppers and silvers really add up. Then when you get to higher tier leather you can make real money. Skinning is also easy to level and adds very little extra downtime while grinding.
---
Oh I agree with you, but unfortunately those are way too rare to "counter" the hatred, that honestly spreads very easily. For example simply tagging a mob that has a long respawn time can be perceived as an act of aggression - the game just enforces a tug of war by its core design, basically everywhere. It doesn't really enforce being nice to the enemy, except if you care about your reputation/the consequences. Which not everyone does.
---
Yeah I agree on loot prio. You just won't get far if you think you have equal prio as the warriors. Definitely not for the armor pieces or rings. If you play a meme spec you have to practice good diplomacy and be friends with the pumpers. The real big brain self-interest is keeping the guild healthy so you don't have to find another one.
---
However, out of all your warriors, some are just going to be DW and some are going to end up getting OEBs. You also might see a BRE before a Spinal reaper- actual competition for a 2h may only be between 2-3 people unless your raid is over stacked with warriors and rogues, or you've been extremely unlucky with drops (or lucky with an early spinal reaper drop). Unless you are very strict with loot council an enhance does have a decent shot at weapons since any upgrade you give them they will use for a very long time.
---
Its different on Alliance (fairbanks) right now. Demand for Holy Pallys is very very high. We discussed looking for another ret just to ensure we have reliable buffs since we only have two steady hpals. We aren't doing that since we have another pair of pallys that are RL friends with core members hitting mid-50s... but we did talk about it. My understanding is that Shamans are more common on horde than pallies are on alliance, but it illustrates a situation where memes become reality. I can see ret being viable or even desired in a lower-tier guild right now if they can't attract Hpals.
---
People are just odd. I ran by a Priest and buffed her with Wisdom once, and got a angry "Fuck you" whisper right after. I replied "Well that was uncalled for" and got met with "No one else wants to fucking help me so eat shit. I'm not accepting help now."
---
Like... All I did was give you 5 minutes of Wisdom. Calm down.
---
People don't understand that our aggro is almost entirely auto attack based :(
---
I exhaled air through my nose.
---
It’s to the point that I don’t heal groups with warlocks in them. They bring zero utility and mediocre dps, life tap, pull aggro, and die.
---
It is better single target. But 2+ targets its better to use ravager. Also "LF WARRIOR FOR MELEE CLEAVE MUST HAVE RAVAGER" was spammed a lot on my server so i felt pressured to get one to be able to group. Even at 60 I keep it in my bags since it scales with AP even at 60 so its really good dps in lyceum and 60 aoe content like strat/scholo rooms.
---
34 Shaman troll, 18G
---
Retailer...
---
There you go, that's also an argument I was making. If people want BC just make it a separate server and you can copy your character ID to the BC server ONCE
---
I used a razer naga for about a year in Cataclysm as a tank and my wrist has never been the same. Careful with those things, I don't think there's any real ergonomic certification required to release any mouse you want.
---
Could have just been age and bad luck instead of the mouse I was using at the time. I remain concerned.
---
Usually if I'm bunkering down for a long night I'll advertise in Org offering 1g for 6 stacks of water. If they're already hanging out in org, they're making money, I'm saving money and we all win.
---
That's my DPS warrior coming in and aggroing everything
---
Just lightly toasted ;) likewise bud!
---
The dummies keep miscategorizing Auto loot with AoE loot.
---
I’m just not sure if the price will go up or down on the matts
---
ya just for your own sanity i would recommend marking targets in PUGs just because people do get confused and aren't really sure about kill order, even if it doesn't really matter. My tank doesn't like to mark really so when we bring pug DPS with us that aren't mages I usually do the marking for DPS target.
---
Huge tip tho that my tank didn't know lol was that you can keybind marks. I have f1f-f8 bound for easy markings and i try to keep all pats marked and any healing mob marked.
---
BTW rereading my comment I wasn't trying to say like "you're a bad tank" but just teasing like "thatsa bad tank! no! bad!" but i do get that some people are literal mongs and will yoink mobs in all sorts of directions. My feint is keybound to shift + mouse button 3 and I hit it instantly after any big openers or crits.
---
I’m on Grobbulus, you?
---
some people see saving or buffing as a sign they want to group. the selfish dps in me/them says, no I dont want to share!
---
If they were going around and killing players that would be a maybe but theyre just PvEing they wont bother.
---
I think the hardest part about this whole situation is that if I even raised a little bit of doubt to any of the first tier GM's, why didn't they escalate it themselves? This is simply an assumption, they literally could of just been like "Nope this all looks right, move on", but with the information I provided I should have easily of raised some eyebrows on if the system messed up.
---
My favorite troll move from WAY back in the day was on this game called Ultima Online. 
---
In that game if you wanted to learn magic you had to buy a magic spell book, which came empty, and you would fill it with spell scrolls throughout your journey. These books, like everything else in that game, we’re not bound to you so you could trade them to other players if you wanted. There was a market for “full” spellbooks which went for about 300g. The only thing is when you put it in a trade window the other player could only see the book and could not open it to verify it was full of spells. 
---
I took this chance to buy a bunch of empty spell books and advertise that I was selling full spellbooks for 250g and got a lot of people to buy my empty spell books. Not very ethical, I know. I’ve had some growing up to do.
---
you can already turn on auto loot
---
Are you thinking of Blood Fury?
---
Wrt the MCP, I think you want to take the "back door" entrance and just stealth to the boss. Rinse repeat. I cant speak to the second part, but Ebbnflow on youtube has a video of doing mara run.
---
Yo what the fuck is wrong with people.
---
You definitely can.
---
Think of it like your bride cheating on you week before the wedding. Sucks ass then, but would've been bigger disaster on a long run. It's blessing in disguise to instantly learn a person is an asshole, or the group is.
---
They may mean AoE loot
---
Imagine thinking one dude controlling four characters is somehow better than four competent players.
---
Good news! shield bash is available in battle stance!  I usually fight casters with a dagger and shield on so I don't have a delay when shield bashing macro spamming.
---
Right click your general tab and create a new chat window. Name it whatever you like. Then right click the general tab again and go to settings. Near the top, you should see tabs for each chat window you have available. Go through each tab and enable/disable whatever you want to show/not be shown per tab.
---
Ex. If you want a guild only chat tab, create a new window, name it Guild or whatever, go to chat settings, select Guild at the top and disable anything that isn't guild/officer chat. Then go to General and disable guild/officer. Click okay or save in the bottom right and then you're done. All your guild and officer chat will only be displayed in your guild chat window now.
---
&gt; DPS ~~keeps themselves alive~~ tries as hard as they can to kill themselves.
---
FTFY
---
I'd imagine it's the Vanilla 0.1% rate but won't know until more data gets sent into drop tracking sites.
---
Dumb druid should have put an abolish poison on before skinning
---
Me: I bet you're very judgy. Her: You butter believe it ;P
---
I'm playing hemo with daggers, macro idea sounds good but I thought daggers were so you can go into assassination and apply poisons faster. Meh
---
and spurs of course
---
Questie addon helps a lot. Really saves you time looking around for quests, which mobs have what and spawn where, etc. Probably the #1 contributor.
---
Leveling professions only when it's convenient. I haven't ignored them but I usually stockpile materials and bang out next tiers of cooking/tailoring/first aid, haven't touched fishing.
---
Mostly knowing what areas have level appropriate quest chains/mobs. Played during BC, so I remember the general "flow" of zones. For example, Silverpine has a few good early 10s quests, then Barrens is stacked for the rest of 10s and into the 20s, then Ashenvale has a few horde quests for the early 20s, etc.... Even if it's not optimal, just knowing when to go to a new place is huge. 
---
Lastly, mostly just murder everything in your path if it's in your level range. Quests give middling experience, it's the mob killing that really gives the brunt of XP. Just killing quest mobs will be inefficient and leave you without good level appropriate quests.
---
&gt;30% speed increase at lvl 22
---
21, if you wait on Feral Charge (I did)
---
Area of Effect. I know its not WoW related, but AoO means Attacks of Opportunity too, if you ever see that.
---
Yeah my fucking healer friend does that when he decides I haven't pulled enough (which is generally when I'm trying to pool rage for a larger pull) and it angers me, I'm always just like "... God dammit dude"
---
So what is the play style like? Not familiar with the elemental shamans
---
What server?
---
4 meters is a pretty small sweet spot
---
TIL that ignoring someone notifies that person!  Awkward.
---
I've never seen it drop in person ever.  I have seen the Onyxia mount drop however, that was amazing!
---
Imagine if the second rolls 1 and it goes to the first guy
---
So what you’re gonna wanna do is erase the last month of WoW from your brain. Log onto your character, send all your gold and mats to Stonewall, and then delete the character. Then and only then can your true journey start.
---
As a mage, I’m not stingy with water, but understand that if I only gave you half a stack the first trade, it’s because I just learned a new rank and only make 2 per cast. I will make as much as a healer wants.. it just goes something like, make 2, make 2, make 2, drink 1, repeat 3 more times - for one stack.
---
But TBC increased it to 1%...
---
99% of the time as long as you acknowledge it's your fault, nobody will care. Just accept it, move on, and try to do better. Your attitude about fucking something up is miles ahead of plenty of other players.
---
It's not a tangible benefit, but your efforts on one character should be mostly isolated to one character. It's not about the benefit, it's about not funneling effort into the character you don't play. More of an RPG flavor thing.
---
This entire comment just reeks of someone that hasn’t actually watched streamers, but only been fed the snippets of twitch clips that get posted here. Someone that’s taken in and embraced the anti-streamer propaganda wholeheartedly, without a thought of their own.
---
I must agree I'm playing a similar way. I'm focusing on 2 characters for a change up in playstyle, Warrior and Priest. And it really does make s difference. I enjoy trying to be self sufficient as you said, sending items or gear to another character feels good. 
---
I'm worried anymore than 2 will slow me down quite a bit though!
---
dungeons go faster when you AoE everything down (if you don't count corpse runs)
---
The number of people out in the world on each layer is around the same as a standard high population server back in 2006. You don't see more now than you would have seen back then.
---
Dude. Ran UBRS last night and we pull the first room after entering the locked door. We clear the rooms then we get to the last room before the next door opens that leads to the stairs and the first boss. 
---
Now the last little room has like six adds in it and I’m solo tanking with solo healer. I’m waiting for our healers to get mana. Then I see it. A rando mage starts to cast at the adds while everyone is drinking. They all come at him and I have to try to pick them all up with almost no rage and no aoe taunt up yet. 
---
He dies. He yells at me. 
---
He is removed from the group. 
---
We happily wave goodbye.
---
This bug happened to my friend's pet that they have had since level 10.
---
Alright, this 'blame everything on DPS' trend is starting to piss me off.
---
I know this is a hard pill to swallow, but there ARE bad tanks and bad healers out there too. Yet if the group wipes from bad tanking .... the DPS gets blamed .... and if the group wipes from bad healing ..... the DPS gets blamed. Its about time bad healers and bad tanks started to take their fair share of the blame.
---
And this is a sad trend that transcends reddit, and into the social aspect of the game itself. I hear tanks and healers bitch/moan about DPS doing stupid things all the time.... yet everyone bites their tongues when its clear that the tank or healer is absolute trash. I had 3 conversations last night alone with 3 fellow guild m8s about how bad one of our priests is, yet not a single one of us was willing to say anything to him about it, because for some reason its taboo to ever call tanks or healers out for anything.
---
I saw a priest and mage combo to MC and poly in between to take an alliance player prisoner. They took him on the zeppelin from STV to Org. I want to level a priest and find a mage to do this now.
---
&gt; I kept "/who Zul F"ing and the group disbanded after 10 minutes.
---
You... What? I don't know what this means
---
There is a guy on Whitemane named Orgasmdragon and I died laughing at 3am when I saw him.
---
I do think it needs to stop at TBC, however, a lot of people started during Wrath and that was the era that saw the most players join (up to 12 million) so it could call a lot of people back.
---
Shhhhh, dont share our secrets! These trunks are worthless!
---
Why? If you're not a dick, and can tolerate a few random dicks in the sea of great people, it's a fantastic time. 
---
In short, it's 2005 all over again, only this time I'm more mature and more patient overall. Less forgiving of shenanigans and dickery, though....the amount of time I spent as a GM patching up guild drama back then? Shit. I shoulda just kicked the troublemakers and moved on.
---
Stun them and run away
---
Basically the same but there's tests I would do to see if would work that you can google.  If you get decent service within a mile or so you can get a directional antenna to point towards there, it depends more on congestion of the tower and throttling of the plan but if you are rural it shouldn't be crowded and there are 3rd party plans that use all of the providers that have better data cap and throttling plans you might wanna consider.
---
In BC we had a few miss clicks that lead to gear going to the wrong person, and the GMs always fixed it for us.  Not vanilla, but BC.  So idk.
---
In retail, you need the tank tho. ZF gy farming groups are very common.
---
What are peoples thoughts on 13-16 pts in ret and rest holy? Max out first tier, then get Pursuit of Justice and SoC. Debating adding in 2 pts to Imp Judgement and another 2 int Imp. Ret. Aura. The rest go into Holy. I mainly use 2h but recently got the 1h mace and shield from SM cath so been using that.
---
That guy would fucking hate me. I always keep an eye out for others in trouble. I’d fucking hope passers by would do the same for me.
---
All of it. That hasn't been a thing for SO long, it sounds like a terrible idea. Also, we're so dps focused that they don't want to sacrifice their personal dps
---
based
---
what are your thoughts,
---
because mine was to report it.
---
bot + multboxing should be banned.
---
&gt; We don’t want the game reworked for more specs to be viable 
---
I mean, I do, but in three or four years when everything has been cleared. I'd love to see a bunch of new low level dungeons and raids made so specs that need gear that simply isn't available could be viable.
---
But I keep those discussions to r/classicwowplus, where they belong. The game, right now, as is, is great.
---
Where’s ur trusty pet?
---
Not if you're wearing freaking learher.
---
RNGesus giveth, and taketh away.
---
The similarities between it and elemental shamans is shallow, just both of their resto specs have the Nature's Swiftness talent and they both happen to put the same number of points in their caster/healer trees for the specs I'm talking about.
---
It's just boomkin without the moonkin form except you have the extra versatility of having an instant-cast for a damage or healing spell. It's just a caster that can also heal, more so than normal boomkin since you don't have to do like a spriest does and drop your spec-specific form to heal (the combat animal forms and moonkin form are all rather costly to cast). Ofc though, a couple of your animal forms retain use. Travel form for kiting and bear form for the stun or if you need to wait someone out with some extra durability.
---
There's this sick PvP I saw of someone using it along with a couple of other specs that I can link to you later if you want. I can't remember the dudes name and can't really search around right now since I'm at work.
---
Ok, then please do.
---
Is there a way to find top guilds on your server ? I recently got a Warden Staff drop and while I have it
---
on the AH I’d like to see if there’s any serious raiding guilds on Benediction US that may be interested for their off tank. I’ve asked around and all of the responses I get are “popular” guilds that just go for big roster numbers. I really feel like the only hope I have of selling this thing is to a Hardcore Raid group.
---
Counterpoint: when using a 1h+shield for farming while it's slower it's nice not having to eat/drink between every other pull and the bonus block chance+power is sweet.  Also the shield block talent is worth more than the 5% mana if your group is ever looking for a tank (which it will be), not to mention 5% mana isn't even equal to one shaman spell unless you're stacking int but then why dip into enh at all then. 
---
Yes leveling as a tank shaman works - both enh and resto can do it.  I've tanked dungeons up to lv51 so far, and once I ding I'm gonna tank Sunken Temple.
---
Can't you make both an Alliance and a Horde character on the same server? That's probably why they can't offer free transfers to "only" one faction
---
So what if the character Dwight Schrute from The Office bragged in an episode about ninja looting. Then, actual WoW players justified their looting with this?  Would you be made at Rainn Wilson the actor?
---
you call frost mages "AoE mages"
---
yes, it's a regional dialect.
---
what region?
---
uhhh Stranglethorn vale
---
Well i'm from booty bay and i've never heard anyone use the term "Aoe mage"
---
oh not in booty bay no, its a... rebel camp expression
---
hmmm i see
---
Pull, mage immediately runs into melee, cone of cold, dies. Mage: ???
---
Yeah if you’re multiboxing you should be banned
---
I hope this story has a happy ending. We all deserve a bit of happiness every once in a while.
---
49 twinks do exist and many people prefered this as lvl 40 is when most classes become complete. 29 was what i preferred tho
---
Have water yourself, wait to be offered.  Enough with the gimme gimme.
---
my mains a tauren war, i would love to win this
---
People who play enhancement shaman are by default bad at the game, and thus their theorycrafting sucks, and is therefore conflicting because it's basically guesses.
---
How much gold we talking tho
---
Trying to quest in the charred vale last night was damn near impossible, and im on a more medium-pop server.  It goes to High at night for a bit, but i dont think its ever touched Full.
---
Its crazy how even on one of the more 'average' realms how freaking busy it is in the leveling zones, and its really getting that way in the max level zones as well.
---
Ok, I see what you mean now.  If it was intentionally left out to be added in later, yeah, that's annoying.  If it wasn't quite ready, that's another story.
---
You can be as hypothetical as you want but you're only gimping yourself by not taking the talent that completely nullifies pushback when something's beating on your ass. The icy veins guide suggests 3/5 Reverbation instead for christ sake. That talent is a massive waste of talent points no matter how you spec.
---
And why would you skip a potential +25% armor bonus to your tank just to save an extra 12 mana when you cast a totem? You can always get a bigger mana pool through getting better gear, but there is only 1 way to make your tank 25% more tanky and it involves specing properly.
---
I'll repeat what I said, this spec is the STRONGEST you can make your class.
---
Just don’t be a spellcleave nerd LOL play how you want and don’t be jealous that others can do shit you can’t
---
It kinda reminds me of the comical hunters in children's movies that are all boastful then get eaten while posing.
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
It can be resisted, yes
---
Massive congratulations. It's exciting when someone gets a super rare drop. :)
---
It'll be epic to see the first person on a server getting Reins of the Swift Zulian Tiger.
---
The problem with locks in raids was the limited debuff slots on bosses. I'm not sure what the limit is for the 1.2 patch version that we are playing now, but they were great once Blizzard added a lot more debuff slots. The raid gear will be warlock specific, minus things like rings, trinkets and weapons. So you usally are only competing with mages for those items and the occasional + spell damage gear.
---
It means he ran the who command to see who was in ZUL farrak and they were no longer in there after ten mins. Meaning they died and gave up
---
If you MC a hunter, will his pet turn hostile against him? If yes it would be awesome to see the hunter getting shredded by his own pet
---
Yesterday I made a quest group with another priest me as a shadow and he holy or disc. Soon I realized that my damage meter says I am doing more than 85% of the damage and I told him no offense but that he is seriously lacking damage and he responded that he doesn't really use his shadow skills. I then checked again and. Saw that my sw:p was ticking for 120 DMG or something and his for 22. I asked him if he is a new player and that he maybe has not out his levels up skills into his toolbar and he is pretty grateful and we had a lot of fun questing :)
---
You can advise people without beeing a dick and that I like doesn't matter if beeing in the recieving end or not
---
There are a variety of reasons why.
---
1, your level. If I remember correctly lvl 42 puts you at the bottom bracket of how soon you can do Ulda, which means your attacks will miss/be dodged/parried/blocked far more often which means less threat generation.
---
2, if dps attack before you have aggro you'll get rage starved. Once you're rage starved you wont get threat back unless it's only 1 mob and you taunt it.... realistically therefore for trash you NEED to be the one attacking first.... and it's the DPSs fault they're attacking too early.
---
3, do you pre-HoT yourself before pulls? Casting regrowth+rejuv on yourself and ensuring you have thorns on yourself is a GREAT way to build that initial threat on all mobs.
---
4, remember swipe isnt the BEST agro generator. Your best threat generator is maul. So ideally you would pre HoT yourself, maybe swipe ONCE or twice just to get enough threat to ensure the healer doesnt pull off of you, then you normally would just alternate which mob you use maul on (plus faerie fire)
---
Some people really don't want any human interaction outside of the game ui.
---
How screwed is someone who wants to play Mage but is only just starting out? Obviously there's a bit of saturation on the mage front apparently... Is it even worth it when knowing you'll need to compete with a lot of people playing the same class for gear/spots?
---
All good, we're tracking the same thing, I wasn't clear.
---
&gt; Alliance likes to dungeon level, horde are out there in the world. 
---
Youre making assumptions on millions of people based on which faction they choose? Think about how retarded that is lol
---
My guildmate paid a lvl 60 20g to run him until it dropped. Took him an additional 8 or 9 runs just from that not including the ones he actually ran. Dont feel so bad.
---
Yeesh, looks like I picked wrong this time around. Main is a mage, because I never played it in vanilla or retail. I don't even AOE farm or use it in instances unless everyone is on board. 
---
Here's hoping the Mage bad bandwagon or the Spellcleave addicts dont screw me over when it comes time to find decent instances.
---
Outdated 2+ week old statistics from census addons. Blizzard broke those addons a few weeks ago so this data is not accurate. The ratio is probably worse now since so many allies have left.
---
I remember back during TBC our guild's main tank would always remind us to let him build threat before DPS got going.
---
Myself, a dagger Rogue, and one of the officers, a swords Rogue, enjoyed trash talking each other and comparing damage meters to prove definitively (despite being in an exceptionally casual guild who barely cleared Kharazan), which style of Rogue was best Rogue.
---
Goes without saying, the sword Rogue would always dive bomb bosses as soon as the tank landed his opener... He and the tank would be battling for agro throughout every fight. I would always laugh, wait for the tank to build up his threat, then jump in when I knew I couldn't pull agro off him.
---
Can't really remember who would win those damage meter comparisons. I suppose it didn't really matter so long as we downed the boss without wiping. Good times... wherever you are in the world Josh (Myrmidon guild main tank), hope you're doing well.
---
It won't because blizzard makes that phat sub money
---
Yeah, that’s what I’ve heard is best. I may just need to go at weird hours when other players are sleeping.
---
At no point did I treat GM's like shit. Roflmao. Get out of here with your insanity. You're just lashing out like a lunatic.
---
I used to do this with my priest and rocket boots in wotlk. I could hit almost any zone from dala.
---
Hahahahaha an ofuckosaurus
---
In my eyes for PvE the only good ret Paladin is the one with a nightfall
---
36 priest, 15g (alch 225, new elixirs and spells ate all my money)
---
Have you really had a bunch of bad experiences personally? And if so what were they?
---
I play a mage and don't seem to be doing any of the things that are annoying folks.
---
And you made a thread because why?
---
I don’t have the answer on hand , however I can suggest looking into Macro Conditionals to see if something there may help. There should be a wiki on it.
---
No, warriors benefit from healers more than other classes do because of their high HP pool and damage mitigation.
---
You're mistaking them for dwarves. Dwarves are all good. Fuck gnomes
---
It's cheating in the same way that binding two actions to one button is cheating.
---
Blizzard allows it. Not sure why. I can't think of any other game that does.
---
This is why I love rogue. I am incentivized to let the tank get aggro. Pickpocketing ensures I don't attack too soon.
---
In terms of Mana per second, of you reach friendly with the Argent Dawn, then Enriched Manna Biscuits are better. I think that's the only better Mana per second drink available right now, since mages don't get level 55 water until DM and AV isn't out yet for Alterac Manna Biscuits.
---
In terms of price, don't use vendor drinks except in emergencies. If there's a mage in your group, get them to give you some free water. If there's no mage in your group then get a random mage in a capital city to make you some water before you head out to a dungeon, most mages will be quite happy to give you six stacks for 50s, far less than the cost of vendor drinks.
---
Nothing I said was sarcasm. Go read a dictionary.
---
Ran ST the other night and the priest would only heal me while I was eating or cannibalizing(eating, i guess :P)
---
The census sites weren't very accurate to begin with.
---
Keyword was "might" but your argument definitely looks stronger when you leave that point out.   
---
Took me 1 month. Whats your point? It's 200g out the window on a barely noticeable dps upgrade to clear two insanely easy raids for half a year, and you could realistically replace them on your first MC run.
---
Actually kind of prefer this over the "world tree" that is just a stump
---
cringe
---
wow that's awful. hopefully a GM fixes it for you.
---
Leeeerooooy
---
Also humans not needing respect is very broad. To what extend? For survival? Without respect it could be anarchy. So maybe we do need respect. I don't know. I wouldn't be so sure of myself saying things like that if I where you.
---
Oh interesting, I wasn't aware of that command, sounds pretty handy
---
Not OP, but they’re basically identical in their in combat use. Their settings ui is the only real difference, and if you prefer healbots look, there’s a vuhdo skin to mimic it.
---
Frost focuses more on slows and AoE damage.
---
Ridiculous comment, and I am not anti streamer. There are even big ones like sodapoppin and shroud who don’t engage in this nonsense and seem to authentically and genuinely enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Are you joking ? You have the rookie numbers, i have ran SM Armory over 30 times now, maybe even 40+ but Ravager has not dropped once. I have seen dozens of helmest, shoulders and so many pants, but not once the 25% Axe. It´s stupid.
---
I was expecting one to pop up sapped.

Got to 47 now I’m back on BFA

Multiboxing is not reportable, but botting is.  You would need concrete evidence to report botting though, a single picture would not suffice.
---
Or the launch fresh servers and start the cycle over.
---
&gt; Maybe he ignored you a long time ago for an unrelated reason, and you just happened to bump back into each other. He could possibly be thinking it was rude of you not to say thank you, totally unaware he has you ignored.
---
This is entirely possible.  Honestly this seems like the most likely scenario.
---
Try gaining aggro and the healer not drinking against 4 ghouls. The healer has to jump up after the first 4 swings land.
---
What do you expect to happen, not engage in PvP so they can stick around so we can PvP later?
---
How have I never thought about this....
---
Plus the odd time you need something from the Dwarf District. Turning in gnomer quests to Shonni you'd be an idiot to fly lol
---
any idea how to build these into your control scheme. I'm liking the idea of using these and have created all the macros but I am lvl 40 warrior and just switched to arms to use Sweeping strikes and mortal strike.
---
 **Mortal &amp; Heroic Strike** \- if you have the rage..  
---
**Mortal Strike &amp; Slam** \- get Quartz swing timer mod – Slam immediately after a white swing, then Mortal Strike with the next white swing then immediately Slam again = **pwnage**. Best with imp slam. As with all castsequence macros make it with the “?” macro icon to see what is next  
---
**Sweeping Strikes, Mortal Strike &amp; Cleave** \- /startattack is there to change targets when they drop o.O  
---
**Sweeping Strikes, Cleave &amp; Whirlwind** (use ctrl to change to battle, use again with 30 rage for SS, then spam)
---
I agree w all that but I think a enh shaman should reasonably expect a OEB or Earthshaker, not a spinal, at least this early on. Sure maybe loot works out in a way that you get it, but dont expect it.
---
Another thing is warriors spend 2k+ on gold on their prebis. They earn that gear. An enhance sham really should build arcanite reaper. There's no excuse not to. 
---
Solution to other problems : Dont be a low tier guild.
---
I get 2-3 sec lockups when Outlook sees an incoming mail. Always. (Mojave, 2016 iMac)

I use lockups as incoming mail notifications, thx Apple, or Blizz, or Microsoft.

3am is a magical time to find most things funny. Too bad there isn't a bard class in wow to seduce that dragon.

They're linked
---
&gt; Currently, everyone is poor  
---
nah
---
&gt; turns out OP has a really shitty attitude
---
I didn't see that.  What made you think that?
---
BiS lists are almost always raid dps oriented, making them in most cases fucking terrible for solo or PvP.
---
Example most bis lists for shamans recommend taking an offhand rather than a shield which is suicide in PvP and makes solo or grinding significantly harder.
---
Honestly, a PvP gear set for locks with high stamina and spell power would make solo'ing her a breeze in comparison.
---
GUYS I JUST LEVELED TO 50 TO SEE THIS CAVE AGAIN AND AFTER 15 YEARS IAM STILL IN AWE
---
^^go ^^fuck ^^yourself
---
Yeah retail’s current specialization system really strips each spec of what used to make it meaningful as a whole class.
---
I’ve been playing a druid on classic and I feel a lot of the same as what you’re saying. I’ve been playing feral but I can also heal because of heart of the wild, and I can tank because feral goes both ways. Too bad the end game gear is a bit limiting for spec choice.
---
Fellow tank here, I understand what you’re talking about. If you’re ever running a dungeon and you feel like you’re losing threat and DPS is aoe/attacking mobs that aren’t marked don’t be afraid to slow down and reiterate to your group to attack/Cc correct mobs so everyone’s on the same page. Remember you’re the tank and you hold an important role so do be afraid to stop and call shots sometimes (if you feel like it’s something your group is doing or course). I know how DPS can get sometimes though, people can get too focused on meters and just can’t wait to aoe mobs but in vanilla aoe threat isn’t as easy and things take a lot longer to tank when you have to run around the room and get threat off mobs running away from you.
---
hey we found the cool kid, guys.
---
Lmao thanks
---
Potentially, but I highly doubt he was going to be able to heal that mage through all that damage before the mage either kills them, or the warrior takes aggro.
---
Easier to just let the tank do the work and not run in like an idiot. If the healer says go, he's referring to either the tank or the designated puller. Not the AoE spamming mage.
---
If you know how to play you’ll have no trouble. I’m lvl 52 and have no issues finding groups or whatever.
---
Every mage worth a damn carries around feathers.
---
Huh, I might just try that charge, serk, ww, defense combo...
---
Work full time have a wife got to 42 before I went on vacation.  Brought my laptop thinking I'd play but its just too damn nice up here in VT to be playing wow 🤣
---
keybind Tab to press a button on your action bars. Put a macro on the button that says this:  
---
/stopattack  
---
/targetenemy
---
It's cute that you think it's easy, and that you simply download a program and *poof* you magically are a top multi-boxer. Talk about a waste of breath...  ROFL.
---
Thanks I'll take a new one for you ;)

a rogue appeared out of nowhere?  definitely speed hack.  what else could it be?

lmao
---
I used to absolutely hate when people steal herbs right infront of me. Now I have the Piccolo of the Flaming Fires. Nobody has stolen an herb since.
---
But telling people not to participate in PvP so players stick around doesnt make any sense. The only reason I care if you stick around is so i can participate in PvP
---
As a warrior tank I would kindly tell people to fuck off if they said I could only roll on tank gear.  Why would I ever tank for pug dungeons if the gear I get isn't going to help me outside of pug dungeons?  
---
I don't know how much this goes for other tanks, but if I see a DPS warrior organising a party for a tank I stay away or even start creating my own group rather than join as the 5th man.  It's not even the loot hassle, although it does crop up on rare occasions with a DPS warrior telling me he wouldnt roll on Herod's Shield and I shouldn't roll on Ravager, I've found that it's the only retard magnet spec.  Even though this sub loves to shit on rogues, hunters and mages, I have very very rarely had any issues with them in comparison to DPS warriors.
---
Nah, I don't take pleasure in abusing people who can't defend themselves. I'm not a psychopath.
---
Yeah ganking isnt the same as straight up pvp. Who ever get the opening decides the fate of the fight. And many classes can "reset" a fight in their favor.
---
Hehe thanks, correct! :D I never got why you should disenchant items if you’re not lvling enchanting. Do the mats cost more than the greens/blues themselves?
---
Paging u/SoupaSoka ,people seem to like it so time to flag it as Low-Effort and remove it buddy...  
---
Everywhere i see people saying the ele rotation is LB, Chain Lightning, LB until it gets to you then melee it down with while doing 1-2 shocks. How are u hitting it down? mobs have 15-20% hp by the time they get to me and my 1H mace swings do 10-40 dmg yet my 1H mace skills are where they should be and im fighting mobs the same lvl as me. am i doing something wrong?
---
This. 
---
I have been way too busy with work and I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
---
Unless you have made it to 60 numerous times and really enjoy the endgame, different strokes for different folks
---
There is no one right way to play the game
---
Tag before you pull and enforce that shit! My tank tags, we stick to his calls, and we're all the better for it. Skull, Cross, Square (or Moon if you have CC).
---
Rattlegore!
---
Eviscerate, except for when you're healthy enough to chain pull to your next mob and it's close enough that SnD won't expire before you get to it.
---
How do I get my healing spells to float over my target like damage does?
---
Cleave hits only one extra target on next swing.
---
&gt;fivesecondrule
---
As a mage, I've been looking for an addon that does this. If you drink while running, right before the tick that you'd get mana back, it acts as if you sat down to drink. I'm really bad at the timing however. So now I can drink and move at the same time! Thanks :D
---
Just want to say for anyone in the water near their departing boat, you can just attach yourself to the side of the boat. Plenty of videos, essentially just jump near the boat, especially against corners in the hull and voila.
---
Moral question on need rolling: 
---
I am a combat rogue and was in Ulda with irl friends last night. We get a drop for a blue ring that is 50 armor, Strength, and Stam. Clearly an ideal ring for our warrior tank, but still a very valid ring for any melee character. 
---
At the time one of my rings was garbage (3 str, 5 Stm), and that ring would have been a direct improvement for me despite not being my main stat, Agi. So I needed, which my tank friend wasn't super happy about. Ultimately my argument was "I intend to equip it immediately because it is a good ring for me at this point, therefore putting myself in contention for the ring was justified." His argument was that it wasn't my main stat, and was clearly better for him than me. Im not arguing with his logic, just that I had a right to roll for it. Luckily we are all good friends and it didn't really get heated. He won the roll and that was that. 
---
I wanted to get opinions on it. Was I in the wrong here?
---
I laughed way too hard at this.
---
That's +50 dkp actually.
---
Nothing wrong with your wife having a boyfriend! In fact, she even allows me to be in the house when he’s over, as long as I’m on the computer and don’t bother them during their alone time! He’s a pretty nice guy, keeps me wide happy!
---
Because it's fun.   If it wasn't fun people wouldn't do it..
---
I'll outplay you any day in WoW, i just happen to have a good job and friends irl on top of it :)
---
I've heard it said to keep slice and dice up all the time, not sure via what means. I have a lowbie rogue and I just pop slice and dice at one or two combo points (right at beginning of fight)
---
No he was on the top of the cliff with me - i jumped to the other side at the bottom with slow falling and appeared at the bottom 1 sec after i landed without any buffs
---
Thats obviously the most reasonable explanation lol
---
haha you're going to have a really hard time in life if you're projecting this hard
---
Pew pew or rip rip. You decide.
---
I too refuse to heal when they pop that. I’m not going OOM for that shot.
---
Why would it be a speedhack? It sounds like you fell down where a rogue happened to be.
---
The door is not open from a lava run.
---
Me here just waiting for the gif to load....
---
Still waiting
---
I think you've misunderstood the ban. Economy manipulation is NOT gold buying and RMT stuff. Economy manipulation is one person throwing around huge amounts of resources and manipulating the flow of the economy. IE: buying a huge  amount of devilsaur leather and removing it from the economy all at one time. You making multiple large purchases like that could easily be  considered manipulation.

R. Kelly has access to internet in prison? Did not know he’s into WoW.
---
Thanks brotha you are the man, I need to check out the discord. 
---
Interesting that he takes Unb Wrath instead of BV because it looks like a 2H spec tree since it ends with 5/5 in 2h spec. UW seems counter intuitive since you usually want a slow atk speed high dps weapon for more damage on your abilities. Unless UW is just the better spec in general regardless which could be the case. Appreciate the help.
---
Go pvp just don’t camp people 20 levels below you.
---
I feel like if you've not gotten the answer or resolution you think its appropriate you should always ask for a higher up, because short of speaking to the owner of a business, there is always someone else to speak to.
---
However, I am not sure if this is an escalation issue, or if its simply a GM doing what they should do. It's hard to say, because without being there, and seeing how they are trained and taught to do their job, how do you know what the norm or expectation is?
---
This also isn't the first time I have had to have wrongful bans overturned, its the third time. Every single time it was for RWT too, but this is the first time I was multiboxing and had the RWT ban happen.
---
How long ago was your ban, and what information did you ever actually get from them?
---
Yep, you nailed it. If you need to be thanked every time you do a good deed, that's fine, but then just stop doing the good deeds so you don't put yourself in the position of not getting thanked.
---
Now I'm wondering if the person that sold the devilsaur got fucked, too.
---
If so, I hope they cleared that up when they cleared your account.
---
Nope, I have to try to make that happen if a GM can't/won't fix it for me!
---
Right?! Like, this dumbass shit is exactly the kind of mentality that has turned retail into such a shitshow
---
But not all 39 are fighting over the same gear you are.
---
&gt; Do the mats cost more than the greens/blues themselves?
---
It depends. The answer is sometimes. If you use Auctioneer it should show the DE value of greens. It pairs well with Tailoring because you can turn cloth into Enchanting mats.
---
Sorry i miswrote the text
---
Most mobs have at least 4 monsters. Charge, bloodrage -&gt; zerker stance, rage &amp; WW -&gt; defensive stance and demo shout -&gt; sunder &amp; tab target requires 5 seconds to get decent aggro on all monsters in a mob. The problem is that hunters open with multi and only FD as the mob reaches them, or the dps warrior charges whirlwinds, or the mage goes 0-100 before our charge even reaches them. All of this pulls the mobs off the tank and reduces their rage as well as spreading them out. Even worse, when hunters FD after a multishot it often results in the healer taking aggro if they let off a single cast.
---
DPS need to learn to wait 3-4 secs before opening up if they want clean and fast kills.
---
Who cares if you're ripping threat on trash though, how does that affect your parses?
---
He said on an internet forum talking about a 15 year old game.
---
Found. R. Kelly’s guild. It seems he has access to internet from the prison.
---
I like that you threw in the druid as well, quality OC
---
No, 61 gold and 46 silver. Other formats for writing currency exist than what you are used to.
---
Do you mark your targets before pulling? I find it helps focus DPS a lot if the primary targets has a big KILL ME skull over their head.
---
Just bind the heavily used marks to keybinds and mark up the targets before going in, it only takes a second or two, max.
---
Must be one of Asmongolds cronies

Multi boxing works and it doesn’t work.
---
For a group of five it works for the fact you can dispatch a group quick enough 
---
I’d say anything over 10 multiboxers vs a group of ten players would not work.
---
For the fact that if the ten players used aoes on the multiboxers it would be a quick kill.
---
This doesn't really matter at all, but when did people start referring to AOE-based groups as Spellcleave?  It seems like a cool but useless term to me.   I assumed it was a Frost Mage talent or something, but seeing as how it's not, I'm left confused.
---
I've had 3 out of 3 warlocks turn me down for food and water because, "I'm a warlock, don't need it."  Well I guess that is one way to do it.  I don't make them refreshments blindly anymore, I will wait for them to ask.
---
Bite has an inherent 10 sec CD.
---
Claw doesn't have an inherent CD so it's just on the pet GCD.
---
I tanked ZF at 46.
---
The trick is Stoneskin + Healing Stream as turns all non-clothies into offtanks.  No AoE required - just initiate, wear a shield and help peel for clothies.
---
Yep lol not sure what happened there
---
Are you sure Melee / Rogue is your thing? I've talked to many people over the years who've learned that there are certain playstyles for them...and some that make them feel sick of playing. Maybe try a caster or Hunter.
---
Honestly you’re still too low level to really play the developed forms of those classes
---
Hunter is absolutely FUBAR. Feign Death, our most important skill, if horribly scuffed
---
I’ll decide if you tell me what that means LOL
---
Yeah that was what I was thinking too. Pretty weird
---
I try to think ahead with my quests, grouping together the ones I know are in the same areas. Running pre-mount can be very time consuming, so making the most of each trip can save a lot of time. And like saving quests to turn in until you've done all the others that are being turned in the same spot, if that makes sense.
---
And even then this for some reason assumes the mage HAS to be face tanking. You can just let the tank gather everything up then run in and Nova...
---
I main a warlock. My alt is a shaman (only 35). I have played every class to 60 other than warlock in vanilla. I have healed dungeons, tanked dungeons, and dps’d dungeons. I have done all three roles in raids as well for content on farm (main was a mage in vanilla) 
---
Warlocks are responsible for their own hp management outside of when they have agro. An occasional heal or hot is great, but don’t freak out when a warlock goes down to 60-80% health. It’s part of our kit. We have to do it to be efficient. Only heal us if you have the mana to spare. We are responsible for our own health management. 
---
Now, do heal us when we get agro. It shouldn’t be a common occurrence, but agro does sometimes get off the tank. This is especially common in AOE pulls. We should not be AOEing pulls where the group is not expecting it, but agro does sometimes get on the DPS. 
---
Do heal us when we hellfire. A shield is awesome too when we hellfire or rain of fire. Rain of fire is our standard AOE spell. We will use it in groups that AOE down mobs. We should not use this in groups that are CCing or targeting one mob at a time. Hellfire is our highest damage AOE spell, but it involves sacrificing our health for damage. It is situationally great, but has very little room for use in a PUG. A warlock should not be using this without notifying the healer and getting the OK first unless the warlock is confident they can manage both agro and hp while using this ability. Personally, I don’t use it outside of guild groups in voice comms. 
---
Many warlocks are new to the class and don’t know how to play it. Similarly, main healers are new to healing and are uncomfortable with seeing health bars that are not topped off. Let the warrior get down a bit in health before healing. Likewise, don’t freak out if a warlock’s health is not topped out unless they have agro of course. 
---
Things will get better at end game. Warlocks will play better. Healers will play better. While some will suck more than others, most will have a basic understanding of their class and other classes. But while leveling, newbie healers can be annoying as a lock and newbie locks can be annoying as a healer.
---
I think it only changed to that in TBC. In Classic, you can disenchant any disenchantable item with 1 enchanting skill.
---
Used to be rogues that would drive me nuts.
---
Now I love them (the few I run across).
---
Best dungeons for rogue gear Alliance levels 40-50?? Seems like dungeons are severely lacking in leather.
---
More than likely. I was at 63g as I dinged 40, but I made probably 20 of that around level 39. It ramps up pretty quick starting around level 40.
---
The annual ["Running of the Gnomes"]( https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcrafts-running-of-the-gnomes-fan-event-gets-1794880791) event organized to raise money for breast cancer on retail.  Maybe check out that event to see how it was organized for information.
---
INCONCEIVABLE!
---
You're wrong. Manipulation of the market is not against the rules. Any single user can buy everything off the AH if they want, its not against the rules.
---
They even state it in the GM's messages that it was RWT and gold sales that the ban refers to, so I am not sure why you'd try to say otherwise.
---
I did a sunken temple the other day where the tank did nothing but sunder armor. The amount of adds in each pull meant that I could basically only attack his first target.
---
Every other pull he'd go "Warlock, please hellfire. This is taking forever".
---
Meanwhile I'm pulling aggro by just putting Siphon Life on an add.
---
60 mage, 400G with epic mount. Alch/Herb trying to farm for Flask of Supreme Power.

No aoe farm and no spellcleave groups at all (was fire from 1-59)

I just spammed dungeons to 60 and sold everything I found on AH, vendored the bad greens. Got lucky with Axe of the Deep Woods drop though and sold that for 275g.
---
Trying to save for a Pristine Hide of the Beast and Arcane Crystals for Cap of the Scarlet Savant
---
I thought about a new class but im fairly sure Rogue is the best class for me personally. 
---
\-Actually has a combat rotation and buffs to keep up. (Unlike warlock/mage which i was thinking of playing which just spam one spell)
---
\-Interesting pvp (I do enjoy ganking a little bit)
---
\-Good damage throughout all the phases
---
Honestly I wanted to play warlock but seeing how weak they are the first few phases and how few are wanted compared to how many there are...Probably wouldn't end well for me.
---
Don't drink the yellow conjured water

Did u got the 2 swords from FRD and SM Cath?

Grab those 2 beasts and go ham grinding as Combat.

NO CHANGES
---
 You said yourself it took you a month of raiding, that's alot longer than 4 days.  But you're just looking to whine.
---
Wow interesting that all the good players come on here to be whiny bitches. So interesting and convincing when you tell me that you are good ;0
---
I don't know exactly. But point is, if you want to multibox pay more and you can. Everyone has the option, just have to pay more.
---
You can progress through questing without resorting to pure grinding, but you have to be willing to jump back and forth from zone to zone.  Doing dungeons does help make some of the more difficult transition periods go a bit easier as well.
---
Is someone who is currently leveling a warrior. No. Just no. Pulling two mobs is already risky business at level 28.
---
Maybe he wanted to play a Paladin all of a sudden and re-rolled without telling anyone to surprise them when he's 60. 
---
In all seriousness though, hopefully they are okay and are back to WoW soon.
---
I ran an expirement last night on my mage to see how much money i could make in an hour running portal sells. I did two different sale tactics. WTS Portal on /2 or WTS Port FREE - your mats.   
---
In my findings the word FREE made more people run to the reagent vendor - buy a 20s reagent and come give me a 50s tip. Probably made 16-17g off not worrying about buying the actual reagent.   
---
I would just stand next to the reagent vendor in ORG and shout/ trade chat. It seems people are more generous when they think they are getting something for free lol.
---
I do find it annoying anytime someone else waits to hold the door open for me - that being said I usually just stand there smile and hand wave them on and they smile back and usually walk away
---
I was told BGs don’t come out until phase 3. Maybe I am misremembering, but I think we bought the PvP trinket with warding gulch marks.
---
Wow man that was super helpful, thank you! I’ll try it out as soon as I get on tonight.
---
Here is the cooking recipe and 5 spider eye cookies.
---
And wasn't focus *technically* in vanilla if you used macros to set one? I remember being able to fear yo-yo a focus target through vanilla dungeons. Although in classic I haven't found a way to set one yet.
---
Thats why i am trying to confirm if that person speedhacked
---
Thanks for the info so far guys. Also I can't believe someone would downvote this post :]
---
Wait... tauren shaman can use that lock set piece? Thats cool as hell i thought it was class locked.
---
Ok sorry What’s the difference between dungeons and raids.  Noob question
---
I think most of the trolls in hinterlands are mage/ranged (could be wrong).
---
Oh yeah for sure, I’m definitely not under any delusion that I’ll be out there like a frost mage farming half a zone at a time.
---
My thinking is mostly just a very basic “pulling 4-5 mobs at a time consistently is better than pulling 1-2”.
---
That's solid graveyard/lib territory.  You are also smoky top enter the rfd territory.
---
You can tell that its beautiful because of the way that it is.
---
I am aware it is a really good skill, but I would not recommend include it in the macro for Mortal Strike.
---
Come home!

Some of the nasty comments I've seen in pugs are just so terrible. And so far in classic, it has always been DPS talking shit on other DPS in the group. If we clear the dungeon and the pace was pulling a new group immediately after the preceding group, what does it matter? You're making enemies over a DPS dick measuring contest.
---
You have a handful of dungeons between 40-50. RFD, Uld, ZF, Mara. 
---
There's definitely leather gear in those dungeons.
---
Whatever they ask for.   Barring that, whatever you feel.
---
Lol this literally happened to me two days ago but I was the beneficiary of it. I literally lost the roll on boots but ended up getting them as the rogue who won them hadn’t done quest. He was pissed
---
As a mage I've had ppl walk up to me, ask for 3 stacks of water and then just walk away,  not even a thank you or a buff. I play a vendor class sure, but when I oom myself for you a little gratitude isn't too much to ask for.
---
Or just kill the lead.
---
Yeah I solo'd this as a holy priest no problem.
---
Keep your disguise on until just outside of the gate, when he fights the 4 level 60 elites take your disguise off and help him or he will die (at least in my case, first attempt I did nothing and he died). Once you make it to the tower at the end you're good. Even if you die, just stay there and DON'T release, you will get the quest completion regardless once Tirion shows up and murders those fools. 
---
As soon as you get the completion, release and walk back and you can turn in to Tirion.
---
My gripe is ppl don't want to do anything about it. A good dozen ppl complaining in general that a UD rogue is ganking in Duskwood. I say well a bunch of low lvls can take down a higher lvl, lets make a raid and hunt them down!!! Only 2 other ppl joined... the rest continued to whine until I called them out with a *put up or shut-up, if all you do is whine instead of fighting back you deserve it*
---
IMO you have 0 right to complain about getting ganked if you aren't willing to do some sort of countermeasure / organize a defence. It's the same as people who complain about the government but can't be bothered to vote.
---
 "Ohhh but I don't have time for that I need to leeevvVVvVveeEeeElllLllll...." in that case I tell them they should have gone to PvE as clearly that is all they want. I bet the reason they went PvP is not to actually PvP, they probably just want to be able to ride around Hillsbrad at lvl 60 in their MC gear feeling all high and mighty killing lowbies. 
---
As for my gripe it is the people who say PvP doesn't start until 60. Or worse, that the game doesn't start until 60...this is how retail happened! To me that is a PvE attitude, PvP is as much as part of the game as leveling on a PvP server, if they want to wait till 60 then I honestly think they belong on PvE. The whole poing of a PvP server is to PvP in contested areas as you level. Running from higher lvls is a thrill, and if they camp just go do something else for a bit. If you just want a 60 rush / BG only then why go PvP? It is ignoring a huge part of the game and you only open yourself to griefing if you don't do WPvP often.
---
It's not possible to get BiS without doing the dungeons. However, BiS is not really necessary if you raid with a decent group. Knowing how to play Priest will matter more than gear in PVP too.
---
Wouldn’t pay more than 50s for that.
---

@L50+ your looking to start farming BIS gear for your end game spec.  Follow the guides available.
---
Yes, but how much?
---
Because the inviters are inconsiderate assholes
---
I had a weird experience myself a few days ago. I stop by Theremore over leveled to hand in a quest and some guy asks me to escort him across the zone to that burned down house with the badge. I'm not doing anything so I say sure. We get 90% of the way there and he boots me from the party. I pm him to ask if he's sure he know the rest of the way and I've been set to ignore. Darndest thing.
---
Even as a tank, I’ve had some great groups, and some just ok groups. I had one where we can SM Cath and everything seemed to go really well. I was pulling quickly and the dps was doing great dmg, yet not pulling agro off of me, the Druid healer didn’t need to drink once throughout the entire thing. 
---
Other groups I’ve had, the dps pulls off of me constantly leading to the healer having to drink a lot because of unnecessary heals. I can get the mobs off of dps, but warriors always have to be aware of missing a taunt then having to spam sunder and waste a lot of time not building threat on every other mob.
---
It's not about getting honor or even killing them. It's about trolling them and making them run all the way back up to just get distracted off the chain again, and getting a good laugh out of it. 
---
A little before that warrior I distracted a warlock off that chain 3 times. LOL. He just didn't learn.
---
If I have a 38 warlock and want to level an alt mage to mail food and water to my warlock, do I need to bother a random player to hold my conjured food and water, log out of the mage, then log in to the warlock, then trade the water back from the rando? Is this the fastest way?
---
Do all bosses have same armor? Also in later raids?
---
I mean if you can get to 58 and you're willing to tank you will get pretty much instant groups for anything you want to run.
---
If you don't want to tank Warriors are also monsters in pvp and pve dps
---
You're fine. It's not super great for you(it is for the warrior), and you should have maybe passed, but it's whatever. That ring will be replaced by either player in the next 10 levels.
---
I had a similar situation: +4 defense, +8 agi +8 stam ring dropped. This is great for a warrior as agi gives crit, armor, and dodge, and defense skill is awesome for tanking; perfect ring for damage and tanking. It's also great for rogue's (the defense skill is almost a waste, though).
---
Those boss drops with random suffixes are always iffy, but don't stress it. Later gear is much more clear in its purpose and intended user.
---
So I'm currently at level 38 as a Priest and trying to get up enough money for my mount. I'm at about 49 gold, so i know I'm behind here but I want to get it as close to 40 as possible. But I keep seeing so much conflicting information on what is best for gold.
---
If I have the idea of EXP and Gold in mind which should I do? Grind SM cath, be doing quests for the monetary rewards, or be grinding mobs? I also really want to level up tailoring and need about a million silk currently, so I'd like to also be getting silk if possible. 
---
Really appreciate the help, thanks in advance!
---
if you're human then the higher weapon dmg of BRE is likely better, also OEB is better on non humans for the wep skill.
---
I know that the magenta plus family plan or Plus up feature for individual lines comes with about 20GB of 4g LTE hotspot. They also have a Consumer Global feature I think it's called that offers unlimited 4g LTE hotspot. It's about $15 for plus and $50 for consumer global.
---
same.  Wowhead guides are ass cancer.

Wait a second...
---
Have we all forgotten all the jobs/relationships/marriages that got trashed by people's obsession and excessive with WoW over the years?
---
I want the guy to be okay, but I also think for some people, not being a part of this world is the best possible thing for them.
---
On hunter: pet attack and pet stop
---
On mage: blink and arcane explosion
---
On warrior: charge and hamstring
---
Those are my main classes and that is what I use the scroll wheel for, but I'm sure I would find a use on the other ones if I played them :p
---
Not very many actually
---
I'm in stalagg, i'd consider that a pretty populated server
---
Good news- one of the shittiest ones just got unbanned!
---
high respect
---
you said shaman so i assume youre alliance. just keep a pally with you at all times and youre good to go.
---
What the hell are you even rambling about
---
Classicdb, maybe?
---
Not really, unless we're talking about Dwarf Priest's Fear Ward. And it's not really make or break, but having 2 Dwarf Priests (or more) is very helpful for Alliance who don't have access to Shaman's Tremor Totem.
---
I love how he was like "Wellp, I tried. Peace."
---
Yup
---
I just recently picked up mage and I’m hear a lot of discourse about them ruining dungeon runs or something like that. So my question is, how do I avoid being a bad mage in dungeons?
---
You are wholesome.
---
You didn't save my life you ruined my death!
---
Talking about fury warriors.
---
Really really really(x10) wish MCP's use was remade into like a super long cooldown, or something. Why charges??? Whyyyyyyyyyyy ugh.
---
yep, and the content is so easy, there is no reason why every guild shouldn't run an off meta spec. There is no progression content in the game. It's all figured out, and even bad players can clear it.
---
You’re not in a competitive guild so that communist mindset of the best item always going to the absolute best character doesn’t hold true, especially since it’s still a big upgrade. Definitely wouldn’t say you’re in the wrong.
---
That being said, it may set a precedent with your buddies. Don’t be surprised if your warrior friend rolls need on a BiS item for you that’s only a standard upgrade for him.
---
You're a GOOD tank... that's an important distinction to make.
---
I love how well the game works with role discipline though. My instance crew occasionally draws adds, but we keep our shit together, don't panic, and stick to the plan. REALLY need to be in over our heads to wipe.
---
&gt; Just frost bolt target of tank ~~for a few seconds before AOE~~?
---
As someone Pally tanking through low-mid levels... fixed it for ya.
---
Can someone explain what is happening here? I feel like this is supposed to be funny but its going over my head.
---
Yeah.. I lose aggro all the time and not once has anyone blamed me.  They know why they're getting aggro, they just don't care (unless we all end up dead and then they'll dial it back.. A little bit.. For a few pulls)
---
Good luck, comment an upvoting for visibilty. Hope he's ok.
---
You lucky sod, I do that and they still attack the cross or blue Square before the damn skull.
---
Your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend's boyfriend is a cool guy
---
If all DPS are nuking the skull that mob wont need a tank as it will die in 5 seconds.  It's the least important target to have aggro on as a tank.
---
The important part is selecting the correct mob as the skull.  It should be non-elites or the most dangerous caster.
---
*Blissful ignorance intensifies*
---
The “Show your booty” Booty Bay Race
---
Chiming in from Kirtonos-US. We don't use the LFG in place of trade chat, we use the LFG in conjunction with trade chat.
---
Dungeons require 5 people to clear them 1 tank that holds aggro on all the mobs, 1 healer that keeps everyone alive and 3 dps that do all the dmg and kill the mini bosses and mobs in the dungeon. 
---
Raids normally take 40 players and are much longer to clear and the bosses have a lot more health. This is why boomkins cant really dps in raids because they will run out of mana during the boss fight and become useless during the fight.
---
It isn't that subjective. I'd bet that the true "#nochanges" people are just a vocal minority of players motivated by nostalgia, but most people actually playing are probably using a lot of addons, and probably used even more addons for those QoL features back in vanilla, when the addon API was less restricted than classic's.
---
Automated group match-making to remove LFG spam would be a very welcome QoL change that DOESN'T change how the game is played. You just replace a lot of generic spamming with a tool that does it for you, and keep on chatting if you want more control over your group as you do now. What impacts gameplay is the teleport to dungeon feature, which isn't required for the rest of the tool.
---
Auto-looting without pressing shift is already in, and I doubt anyone is really complaining about it.
---
Everyone is writing /dismount macros, so it wouldn't be really game changing to make that a menu toggle.
---
You just need to know how to differentiate UI QoL from gameplay QoL.
---
I work in chat support for another company and one thing I think people forget is how much is lost when sending text versus speaking directly. Things can come across far more cold or aggressive without the inflection of your voice. Maybe I’m just sensitive to that as I deal with it a lot lol

Rogues are a labor of love in Classic, but damn do they let you have some good clean family fun.
---
Shamans can't use swords, otherwise yeah OEB would be more suitable. Earthshaker or Spinal Reaper.
---
We're on the cusp right now with one night MC clears and killing rag before submerge, but have had 2 hpals leave.
---
Seriously, part of the reason there isn’t a direct cost on the Felsteed is because we buy skills like everyone else and then have to prioritize those damn Grimoires for an ever growing list of pets. That being said, take rank 1 CoR, it’ll save your ass more than once. But the need to prioritize is always there.
---
I am leveling balance myself. Who cares if its' not 100% optimal. It's absolutely viable for leveling. All specs are. Balance allows you to utilize the hybrid aspect of the druid to the fullest - you'll be using all animal forms and caster form (i.e. open in cat form, apply bleeds, wait for nature's grasp to kick in, switch to caster, finish off with spells).
---
Or hit Num Lock which is the auto run's original keybind.
---
Either be polite or deal with people being impolite to you.  Nature of social games.  They're just as obligated to let the AoE mage safely farm as the AoE mage is to let them get named mobs.  Hogging named mobs is an active form.
---
An MMO death in a game without XP loss is not a big deal, and the walk back will take  *far less time than what he was making others wait*.  If the mage was hogging named mobs from someone screwing up his aoe pulls, it would be the person screwing up the aoe pulls in the wrong.  In MMO games you have to fight your own battles, there isn't a spawn police going around divvying out mobs equally.
---
Been using wowhead as a new player (came from runescape) because it was the first hit on Google. After reading these comments ill think ill try icy veins

&gt;You have no idea of what's happening to the person on the other side.

No they have different armor values
---
On my warrior i like to keep mana pots that i get while questing and trade those for mage food when i request it.
---
Your most recently trained weapon buff will be hotter dps.  Once you have talent points in flurry WF will always be best.
---
Keep them both available, you might need to tank (go rockbiter) while world questing with pugs or friends, but you don't want to be tanking in an instance (go flametogue).
---
Don't have any locations specifically, but yes they surely exist. Throw a Curse of Tongues on them to make their cast speed even slower.
---
Oof on a dwarf, RIP. Deviates for eternity! Still gz!
---
Spoiler alert, it can be.  Remember that farming simulator on Facebook 12 or so years ago that got reaaaaal popular?  Used to buy weed from a chick who's mom would suck dick for meth and play it all day whacked out of her tweeker fucking mind.  
---
Trailer parks man.
---
50 armor will go a ways when soloing/levelling, and in the overall scheme 50 armor is NOTHING to a warrior, when his chest is giving 400+ and his shield is giving 2k+.
---
It's not useless for the rogue, especially when levelling.
---
You are so wrong. So very wrong. There are PLENTY of quests to get you to at least 55 without ever having to grind or do dungeons ever.
---
At your level i skipped entire zones because i was overleveled for them. And before some smartass be all "you are a mage lol aoe aoe aoe". I didnt aoe farm untill much later.
---
Honestly just seems to me like classic is not for you. If you dont like how grindy it feels, just quit now and find a game you have fun with.
---
6 stacks of water! I could never use that much
---
Multi-boxing is a joke.
---
Sickens me that blizzard allows it.
---
Hurrr mage bad get it guise?? Cuz I don't lyke new meta
---
The main thing is let the tank do their job. Don't ask the tank to go faster so your AOE is more effective. Let the tank establish aggro before you AOE. Don't bother AOEing on pulls of less than 3 enemies, and even with just 3, it's usually more useful to the group to spam frostbolt on the primary target instead.
---
Also, give your healer and any other mana users water. They'll probably ask if you don't offer it first, but doing it without asking is a nice way to endear yourself to them.
---
Not on our server it seems, haven't seen anyone offering those runs at least. And I think he was just determined to get it his way. He's probably netted at least 1k gold in vendoring trash through all his runs through UBRS in hopes of that single item.
---
Can confirm, am dummy, did make that mistake
---
Hey, you're one of the more civil people so far to post about it, so what is it that concerns you about multiboxing? Can we chat about it?
---
I'm about to go to dinner with some friends, but I will respond as soon as I am home!

Rattlegore has has groups of horde brigading Scarlett and Stv for weeks. Supposedly horde don't out number is that bad, but damn.
---
Stv wrecks will drop the Mithril ones
---
Individually, no, you can't. Which sucks, because this is a massively singleplayer online roleplaying game that we play, after all.
---
So right now I’m at lvl 38 with my paladin
---
From my point of view 
---
I’m staying with my two hander and seal of command
---
It hits hard and using rank 1 of seal of command is very mana efficient. Always use blessing of wisdom and judgement of wisdom for mana regen.
---
I found fighting demon/ undead mobs “because I’m grinding” to be the best.... exorcism is a godsend because it allows a far better rotation 
---
My leveling has been about 2 hours level 3 if I’m goofing off or going back to SW to get skills. 
---
I have 4 days played and almost at 40. 
---
The early 30s were brutal for me.
---
Its 2 dps higher, that's better.  15% increase.
---
How do, exactly? By just farming mobs quickly for gold/cloth etc?
---
54 shaman around 150 Gold

---
View distance is the distance at which it renders terrain, not players/NPCs IIRC.
---
You have to sometimes take your eyes off the healing UI and look at the actual mobs and players. Also, lifetap will mean a steady loss of life as every two is the same Hp loss. While mobs don’t do steady damage. 
---
If you are a newer healer and everything is overwhelming, focus on the tank and yourself first. Let the DPS fend for their own when you are overwhelmed. When you have a handle on what’s going on, heal the DPS as appropriate. 
---
Some people here think DPS should never pull agro. That is true in some instances. But fast clearing groups sometimes cannot keep agro off the DPS all the time. The important thing here is to communicate and be on the same page with the group. And if it is a PUG, lean towards taking things slower until you get a feel for the group. 
---
The bottom line is that like anything else, a healer gets better as he or she gets experience. But your two top priority jobs are to keep yourself and the tank safe. Everything else is secondary.  And at times you may have to make the call not to heal a DPS to save mana to keep the tank or yourself up.
---
Not on faerlina? You telling me you don't know who clc is?
---
I didn't say I do. You also don't get to decide the definition of abuse. Repeatedly treating someone cruelly is literally the definition of abuse.
---
Apparently things don't change. This has always been a thing. At one point I had a macro that I ran at the start of each dungeon run, basically saying "Tank = tries to keep mobs entertained. Healer = tries to keep the tank alive. DPS = tries to not die before the mobs. If the healer dies, we all die. If the tank dies, we all die. If a DPS dies, it's usually their own fault. On a pull, please count to 5 before joining after the tank."  
---
Occasionally someone felt offended (mostly DPSers), but most of the time it worked and it sent a clear message right at the start. I guess some might've felt I was patronizing them, but after I started using the macro I rarely ever had a bad run. 
---
P.S.: Vanilla to WOtLK as healer, WOtLK to MOP tank, then alternating between rDPS and healing. Used to RL/GM a hardcore raiding guild, now I'm older, slower, and just relaxing in Classic at my own pace.
---
The topic hit close to home for you?
---
You want to level as feral. It's fun and it's really the only good option
---
Mutiboxers should be against TOS.
---
yeah spr regen really drops off after 30 i've found, esp. versus the mp i'd use to go all out DPS on a quest mob 2-3 levels higher than I. You can definitely save mana with a slower kill speed, but i'd say its less time to burn a mob or two down very fast and drink a few seconds than to kit around your earth totem for longer.  Really the cost of drinking mana is the silver, not the downtime.
---
I roll 1s constantly. I’ve had multiple instances where I got no loot because I lost every. Goddamn. Roll.
---
Well put it back on.
---
Actually, that was not your point. Your point was that blizzard would never forbid multiboxing because of sub money. To which- I am expressing doubt that multi boxing makes up a significant enough percentage of their overall subs that their hands would be tied if they wanted to ban it.
---
In 20 days played, not once has anyone I've played with looked at the race of a player. Only their class, and occasionally where relevant spec (ie enhancement shaman).
---
I'm sure it happens, but play what you want it won't limit you.
---
As a mage, you have access to some of the most potent AoE spells in the game.
---
Tanks in classic take a little time to build aggro, if you come in guns blazing on each pull you are going to take aggro, which puts some degree of stress on the tank and the healer.
---
Additionally, you need to be cognizant of your AoE and make sure you don't pull additional mobs.
---
Conjure some water/food for you party members, don't make them feel like leeches for asking for it. Single target dps until the tank builds aggro, then blast away.
---
The key to any successful dps character is to manage threat, and do damage. If you can do that, you'll be fine.
---
The things inside `[]` are conditionals, the semicolon is basically an "`else`".
---
You could simplify the macro by using an "`or`" condition:
---
`/cast [@mouseover,help] [] Lesser Heal`
---
Which means cast on the target I'm mousing over if it's friendly, else use default targetting rules as if you casted the spell directly.
---
Yeah, I am a warrior
---
Wasn’t that the name of a live action porn parody movie?
---
I thought for a sec it was sylvanas with a gun. Crossbows nice too. I want more art with wow characters wielding reimagined weapons
---
I think that this is pretty normal behavior for WoW Classic. I once just gave someone Underwater Breathing as a joke and they told me that the buff was useless for the zone we where in. They proceeded to kick me from the dungeon group.
---
You're not wrong. Ignoring rares. off the top of my head there's nothing in SM: Cath, a helm in ZF, shoulders and boots in Mara, shoulders and bracers (random stats) in ST.
---
Yea this website has a much better layout than the wowhead guides I've been reading through
---
Aw, hope you find him :(
---
And that is cheating...how?
---
So that happened to me when I was like around 35-40. Started leveling an alt got to level 15 went back to my lock main and pushed on. I’m enjoying the heck out of him right now but he did get stale for a few levels.
---
As lame as some people think it is, you can always make your own group and communicate to the group that it’s reserved for you if it drops. People have strong opinions on both sides of this argument so expect to get some rude messages if you decide to go that route.
---
Ran into a few groups in private servers that were like 4 hunters and a priest.  It was brutal to have 4 pets and 4 aimed shots hit you at the same time, lol.
---
That's what addons are for yes.

Ah okay that's not so bad then hahah
---
How do fleshy claws parry a giant 2handed mace?
---
Is it just me, or is this cell phone picture look like it was painted on a canvas, it looks like it has texture.....
---
Yep. I’ve made a deal with myself; I only tank 55+ dungeons now. For my mental health.
---
DPS doesn’t even give me a single GCD to get aggro, then says “wow, bear tanks suck.”  Fucking enraging.
---
You do a fantastic job of shading!
---
&gt; ESPECIALLY when you have low amounts of mana.
---
Sap probably won't be used as unless the rogue is spec'd into it, pulls you outta stealth so in a non coordinated group you would just die. Even when spec'd there's 10% chance it won't work
---
Obviously, but you clearly THINK you do hence all the bitching to change people’s behavior lol. 
---
I can indeed argue with your use of the word of abuse. 
---
I think I’ll gank 20 lowbies tonight just for you. See what you did?
---
Exactly, I'm at 49 it will be a relief to hit 50, it's smooth sailing from there
---
When they throw a fit at you then you can tell.
---
We had a dude, friendly, nice, playing every day....out leveling everyone else in the guild those first couple weeks, was even made an officer....3rd week starts up, he's not on...a week goes by, haven't logged in once.    Suddenly, his name disappears from the guild entirely and he hasn't been spotted on the server since.   
---
He either migrated or deleted best I can guess, he told nobody, no idea what actually happened to him.
---
It's not real, it's a copy paste
---
Maybe I’m a bit unlucky, but I’ve farmed around 200 thorium and never having seen a single crystal. Once more people hit 60, I figure prices will come down a bit and I might be able to buy crystals to have friends transmute for me. 
---
I’ll have to load up on FAPs! Thanks for advice.
---
Arms tanking UBRS is no big deal. Throw on a shield for packs between rend and drakk maybe
---
I'm a super "safe and slow" tank... I love having a (cooperative) mage in the group.  Sheep CC + slow of chill if target breaks aggro is my friend.

Doesn't matter - I would give it back twice over to know my buddy is okay.
---
you wife's boyfriend? bought the gold?
---
Dreadforge 100%
---
Can i heal the likes of scholo or strat while shadow spcd?
---
how much gold did he give u
---
How much do pendulums of doom usually go for once twinking starts being a thing?
---
Generally no. 300 ensures 100% success rate in areas like Tanaris, so once you get to it there's no longer any need to pop baubles.
---
I read something about wanting to hit around 365 skill to get the fish needed to summon the boss in ZG, but that was changed at some point to only needing 1 skill in fishing and I have no idea if we're getting the old or the new once ZG opens. 
---
Outside of that as far as I'm aware there is no advantage to having it at 300 save for the bit of silver you don't have to spend on baubles or the occasional miss if you're below 300 and not using them.
---
Same thing to me. On a flight. Made some food. Come back to whispers - "want to heal ZF? Have mallet" I missed it by 10 mins. Tried to respond. Ignored. So dumb.
---
This is exactly my point, anyone who would go through the trouble to setup and actually do a multibox is EXACTLY the kind of person I do not think the wow community deserves. Read this guys whining crybaby post and how he treats people that disagree with him because he is a terrible person IRL not just in game. Do not want people like this in game interacting with my avatar.  Not at all.
---
Damn that sucks. Also; do you have any tips on leveling a pet? Just got BT the other day and leveling him seems like it's gonna be a pain
---
Nah I got a Kang's world drop I'm good on Enh at least to 50 :P
---
My guess is that he had to quit cold-turkey to take care of RL and didnt want to even have the opportunity for his guildies to try and get him to stay because he'd be too tempted.   
---
I am sure he's fine but probably had to cut ties completely to stay in control.
---
Well, if you're LFG, you're in the wrong channel.
---
If you're in Trade, it's fine I suppose.
---
Dear DPS who take t upon themselves to start the fight before the tank can generate any threat:
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
Thank you for attending my TED talk.
---
Yeah. Check the comments section for just about any of them, it's hilarious. The top three comments are always two calling the guide flat-out bad and here's why, and the third is being polite about it instead.
---
My priest is 29..........
---
Though my lock is 60, so maybe I'm the wrong person to ask.
---
I don’t follow... what’s the numerical equivalent to “doesn’t matter”?...
---
People say it's fair that a level 20 gets one-shot by a level 60 but also say it's unfair some multi-boxer one shots them with their 4 hunters and a priest group?
---
??? Addons were a thing vanilla bud
---
Do you like your Orbweaver? Been thinking of getting one ..
---
a shitty multiboxer still beats anyone solo, please neck it...
---
This time I rolled a warlock but on Vanilla I ALLWAYS had a stack of feathers on me. It was mandatory on heavily alliance dominated PvP server. It helped me escape so many ganks, invaluable. I even did a flying fight with another mage one time as he followed me with his own slow fall (well, he did but his friends died like idiots...).
---
That run (or swim) back though. I really hate going there and hate ending up hearthing to kargath just to get out.
---
They were a Shonen anime rival in real life.
---
I ran into a multiboxer back in the day with ~35 ele shamans and 5 prot or holy paladins. They would just setup in the AV choke point leading into frostwolf and no alliance could get past 35 earthquakes and 5x consecrations. Was simultaneously impressive and annoying enough to just leave the game and take the 15 or 30 minute penalty.
---
I dunno, but I've read people saying /s is much shorter range than expected.
---
Yeah if you want to get more creative with it, make whirlwind equip a 2h with a macro so it hits harder, then make your defensive stance equip sword and shield.
---
Fuck me i have some disenchanting to do
---
Informative post at the bottom, never change reddit.
---
Upvote to you sir
---
ZF has feet as well, from the rare spawn.
---
 No, you’re not wrong. Even without a skull placed if they knew they would at least request it. 
---
Its the quickest way to reveal yourself as a new player. Never played with a veteran that did not understand this.
---
I dont agree with this thought process. So in order to save 30 min you have pissed of one player by kicking him and annoyed another player by having him switch roles. You wouldn't treat people like that in real life. Why would you do it in a game? Common human decency should prevail here.
---
Yes, that's how it works when you look at the statsheet, however a faster pet:
---
Gains more benefit from gift of arthas
---
Will survive longer due to judgement of light.
---
And if you're one of those wierdos who raid as BM has higher frenzy uptime.
---
Faster attacking pets simply deal more damage despite there sheet dps being the same.
---
For what it’s worth, I’ve done this EXACT same thing with WoW before. Just ghosted the game and guild due to RL issues. I wouldn’t worry too much about it.
---
Rock
---
Oh didn't know that, thx for info!

It’s the internet. He probably didn’t care about you or the game as  much as you think
---

---
Yea most people are dicks like this and won't bother to respond if they don't want to take you.
---
What is that add on?
---
Thank god you’re not me.
---
Rogues: Band of Accuria is rogue prio
---
Also Rogues: Why can't tanks hold agro in BWL?
---
I played the first month with graphics setting to 3 (classic) and just assumed that's how it was supposed to look. Not until my friend mentioned horde that I couldn't see due to view distance did I check my settings and cranked to 10, wow! Really made the game pop. I just turned down ground clutter to 1 because it was a little excessive and sometimes lost corpses to loot in
---
Yes you are probably bad good observation
---
You're acting as if the spirit and stamina has no purpose for me when that's not true. A lot of warrior recommend Spirit as your secondary stat.

What’s that portrait addon for the cc timer? Is there a dot timer too?
---
That could add too much sentimental value to leaving. Sometimes it's best to just vanish.
---
I play on a PvP server, but I refuse to gank anybody that's green or lower.
---
After leveling my rogue through Hillsbrad, I have decided that I will go out of my way to gank every single AoE farming magetard I see.
---
mid 2000s video would of been blasting LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR to this footage
---
[I had a similar view](https://i.imgur.com/tqb1CNc.jpg)
---
I’m saying you’re a liar. Now go away.
---
Just FYI, blizzard used to return currency/items in vanilla... and do so in BFA as well. 
---
It's just for classic it seems.
---
That’s called nostalgia
---
I suppose you could literally take every single talent in one tree but even then I think you'd have a couple points left over. And realistically you'd never want to do that because every tree has some talents that are generally bad or at least extremely situational. 
---
Most non meme specs will have between 5 and 20 points in a secondary tree. Or they may even venture a tiny bit into a third tree.
---
Talking about priests specifically I highly recommend taking the disc talents I mentioned earlier as well as 5 pts into spirit tap in the first row of the shadow tree. It will boost your mana regen while questing greatly and you can use mind blast or your wand to try to last hit mobs to proc it in dungeons as well
---
Indeed it is.
---
Perhaps Fainaru Furasshu (Final Flash)?
---
it's a waste of rage bro
---
Tl;Dr: 
---
* Multiboxer gets picked up by whichever anti-cheat/auto-ban system. 
---
* Reminds blizzard how much he pays per month. 
---
* Unbanned.
---
Still a better love story than Twilight.
---
Bag space. My mage is an enchanter and I was actively disenchanting greens I got while running through WC just to be able to further loot.

fairbanks
---
Today you, tomorrow me.
---
At those lvls its just 1% chance to miss, so that sounds like a 0.01% chance of it happening if I understand math correctly.
---
Comp in RFD was a hunter, a warrior, a shaman, and a druid as heals. hunter was doing multi shot pretty shortly after I pulled, and had their pet attacking unmarked mobs. (I mark skull for attack first, and "x" for attack second)  
---
Comp in Mura was mage, rogue, cleric as heals and i forget the last dps spot. I think I was probably just low level to hold aggro. I wiffed a lot of my attacks so it was hard to gain rage.
---
What a load of crap.
---
Probably the same people who click on abilities
---
While I know we are talking about WoW this is the exact opposite of what you want to do if someone IRL has the behavior that the OP describes.
---
Next time capture it on video.
---
That shit made my day.
---
He just stepped out to buy some smokes. I’m sure he’ll be back...
---
I hope the massage I get from your mom later tonight has a happy ending too. ***;)***
---
A couple other handy tricks for pulling like you said with dynamite I use are a trinket called cold basilisk eye, the effect is terrible (5% attack speed reduction for 15 seconds) but it has a 35 yard range, usable once per five minutes.  
---
Also, magic candles that you can get from kobold geomancers at jasperlode mine are a fire ball spell consumable with good range. Again, terrible damage, but they're ranged pulls.  You can get a similar thing from a repeatable quest in ungoro, don't remember the specifics but it's basically dynamite.
---
Keep on tanking man, have fun and play what you want!
---
Like I said, I know you're never going to accept the fact that abusing low levels makes you an asshole. It's not my fault that you took it personally when I said it's a little psychopathic to do something only because you want to ruin someone else's day. Kinda makes me think you might be a psychopath.
---
Yep :)
---
I'd try to look for a fast dagger and throw flametongue on that bad boi. That long with lightning shield (mana pending) should help burn mobs down. Maybe you can throw down earthbind as well to help kite/joust.
---
Yeah the Frostwolves seem like they'd be chill even back then.
---
Seconding asking Blizz. Was suicidal teen, guildies I confined in told Blizz, french police called norwegian police, who then called my dad.
---
Perception.
---
The fact that he both sent you his gold AND deleted his character is a clear indication his departure was voluntary. I don't think you should be that concerned for his well-being, I'd be more concerned if he suddenly stopped logging on with his characters untouched and no explanation. I would agree with others that he probably just quit cold turkey. It would've been nice if he had at least sent you a goodbue message.
---
I wish haha. The closest thing I saw was one that raided on Friday but it wasn't even on my server.
---
I think this is one of the very few scenarios I do not agree with all need because of purple BOE. Any lvl 60 who needs on this with a 300 Tailoring Warlock for the 75g-100g is extremely petty.
---
Sometimes people have it coming 
---
That’s the shadiest deal I’ve heard of lately
---
He might have moved to the opposite faction. It makes all sense if you are an Ally.
---
no fireshield?
---
Called you a nagger?
---
And did your bodyweight change?
---
I’m happy you posted this. I’m like 9days+ at 58 and I felt like i was slow but for a warrior I felt i went at an okay pace
---
You know damn well he ain't going to be a tank later.
---
I was going to comment on the alliance suggestion pointing out its a tab table that also has horde and shared zones but then I realized what you were getting at...
---
Yea and if you care about endgame, locks begin to scale to well it's wild.  Then add to that all the fun world pvp and soloing utility you have.  If i was to go back to a caster I'd do lock for sure.
---
The dagger is more reasonable, because weapon damage can be super important for some classes.  Still a dick more 9/10 times tho.
---
Dude play it!
---
It’s been amazing
---
I only played burning crusade got to 46 as a Druid
---
Classic is amazing
---
It’s everything I been searching for in games that are lost in today’s games
---
That’s because the tank is concerned with healing threat ripping the 2nd, 3rd, maybe 4th mob off him and losing his healer. Whereas skull will at worse go after a dps and then if he taunts, all that threat belongs to him!  I intentionally barely touch skull until the moment a dps rips it off me.
---
Just as many dumbass tanks and healers, when you account for population. Maybe healers are even the worst (not factoring in people who didn't sign up to tank and got pushed to do it..). I see a bad healer every other run and a bad tank every 3, it just works out that for dps this means almost always 1 dumbass and often 2.
---
You got to 48, yr good.
---
of course the good lion is Alliance.
---
sodapoppin is still streaming though?
---
Sad but true.
---
DC is a horrify not a fear, so you can't WOTF out of it.  But they can break the follow up fear, and then you are screwed.  Your best bet is to hope they are far enough, curse of exhaustion, and then kite for the 5 second duration.  If they sprint, amp curse coex, and burn a swiftness pot or stopwatch trinket or whatever you have to stay ahead of their sprint.
---
I strongly believe that Ulda is the first reality check when it comes to tanks. The tank makes or breaks an Ulda run.
---
What do you expect when playing horde? Bunch of Walmart trailer park people over there.
---
I would agree for the most part, but there are some communties that are being built by a good wowhead guide. Say what you want about Protection Paladin, but take a second to look at this guide. Its updated weekly (if not more), loads of supporting math, and generally a really good resource to utilize.
---

---
Maybe. I'm about to quit because of them. Most guilds I joined are full  of loud 4chan memey cringe bois who live in bumfuck country. And everyone else doesn't socialize.
---
Open a ticket if there is a legit concern about self harm. Blizzard has reached to this before by contacting local authorities with address and and the concern. 
---
Can recall about a story a few years back where someone was threatening suicide and went offline. Some guildies tried texting and calling him with no success and open up tickets. The GMs contacted local police with it and they drove out and checked on the guy. 
---
The guys was depressed, but otherwise fine. He eventually came back and thanked the guildies for showing concern.
---
I have played quite a bit of shaman from 2005-2006 and now again with Classic.
---
I also played SHaman in the closed classic beta.
---
For the first time I leveled primarily as elemental starting in the closed classic beta. 
---
 (even tho it is possible early on to effectively level enhance with heavy intel gear )
---
I think I like it better and I will explain why....
---
There are alot of open world elite mobs that you need to kill for certain quests... those mobs are mostly melee. I can drop an earth bind for a safety net... a mana spring totem for some mana regen. a searing totem for some passive dps... 
---
and then i begin circling the mob repetitively frost shocking them. (clear casting procs ftw / mana potion if needed)
---
As an enhance and relying mainly on auto attacks... even if i at best use earth bind and only come in range during my swing timer, killing a melee elite is a dangerous feat for the enhance shaman.
---
Right now for straight LOL my build looks like this...
---
[https://i.imgur.com/sTu7ReY.png](https://i.imgur.com/sTu7ReY.png)
---
\--- if anyone is curious as to why I can break it down in a reply.
---
I'm new too and really enjoying my time. I enjoy running dungeons as heals too, but I'm a druid so sometimes people died on my watch. Lol. But as I level I'm learning more about Mana efficiency and down leveling spells. So I haven't had a death in a week or so :) people have been patient to my face, so that's been helpful.
---
This is definitely what is going on;  I did this yesterday while making sure I was attuned.
---
We locks appreciate you
---
Alliance trying to 2v1 and getting out-played? 
---
So what's new here?
---
Hold the door closed when he tries to get out
---
&gt; and intentionally control markets by buying and selling items at agreed upon rates
---
Can you expand on this?
---
Not what I heard but I'm not a druid so who knows ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Not palatank here, but prot warrior.  We exist but reddit and other forums like to shit on us with "ArMs WaRrIoR iS bEtTeR aT tAnKiNg"
---
You’re a good man, if it was me I would have just stood there and watched until they frantically /y help! Lol
---
people on reddit are too sensitive i really dont understand lol
---
I have been playing a ton due to having some time off work and my rogue is currently 57. I took my time and read every quest and took everything in.
---
I've now rolled a mage as I'm tired of waiting forever for groups that only want mages and locks and I only really plan on pvp with the rogue anyways so I've plenty of time to get those last few levels and should be able to bang the levels out with a mage
---
I purchased the Mara ring from Princess from a warlock (since they can solo it) and wasn't scammed.
---
Some people are just shit.
---
I legit had somebody say ‘but it’s an upgrade from my white gear.’ 
---
Yeah, so would almost any quest reward.  I didn’t spend thirty minutes running BFD so you could save thirty silver on the AH.
---
Why? [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowcirclejerk/comments/dbjju1/can_we_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_the_825/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) had me cracking up.
---
No it doesn’t.
---
PSA: there is no “live support” in this game at all. If your quest is not working they say “they cannot solve it and you better off asking devs directly”. If you have been scammed they say gold won’t be returned. They don’t handle reports either - they’re all being processed automitacally, resulting in bans. I can’t think of a single example how they could help you in any way without just redirecting you to other people/sources. I wish they just fired the entire live support department and lowered down the subscription price accordingly.
---
Becauser we can't sap so they're not afraid. Though a good Ravage crit and they'll pop the vanish.
---
/join LFG is ok but the official global channel for Clasdic is /join lookingforgroup (spelled out) and has a LOT more traffic. I use both.
---
Shimmering flats mobs have good gray drop returns, and if you can skin, even moreso.
---
He fits in great here on Whitemane with that attitude.
---
Source: am on Whitemane allaince, too deep to change servers now. The elitism and douchebaggery is off the charts.
---
Holy crap are you still going on about this? 
---
Lolol
---
Very good advice all over, and that unpopular opinion is also completely right - epeen stroke that ooms the healer and adds more risk to the clear by doing so.
---
Nah not really. I'm a warrior tank so I would normally be laughing at this. There's just so many of these threads every day that it gets exhausting. I miss the front page being filled with joy and concern for each other rather than hate.
---
Nobody stopped to think that he realized it’s not worth spending 15 minutes plus to finish quests? 
---
This game is a serious time investment. You can’t do much in an hours time.
---
Special characters yikes
---
You should consider using auctioneer instead of auctionator
---
Yeah relying on auto attack is good actually, we want to do that as much as possible. Also I forgot to say, only heal if you think you may die. Heals cost mana, so they'll stub that five-second rule too. It's good that you're relying on first aid. If you need a little more HP than your bandages can heal, throw a heal between fights alongside refreshing your LS or totems.
---
I know what you mean, enhance is really fun when it's sort of set-and-forget, you just get to chill and watch those sweet windfury crits roll in.
---
Unlike most balance druids, I am going hybrid with feral for early levels (feral up to Feline Swiftness before starting balance). This reduces downtime because of increased movement speed when questing and gives you extra viability as tank/dps role in dungeons. Going pure balance and refusing to use animal forms  when soloing (most leveling balance druids) is just unnecessarily handicapping yourself IMO. Embrace the hybrid role. 
---
When questing, you'll be in caster or a mix of caster/melee gear, so your feral will be somewhat weaker than pure melee. But the difference won't be huge because at least you're speccing into Ferocity for dps and Feline Swiftness for survivability.
---
Walking backwards is useful when you want to draw mobs somewhere as tank while still hitting them.
---
I actually decided overnight to quit too after hitting 60. Probably not that uncommon.
---
Who cares.  It's a crutch you don't need 99.9% of the time.
---
They don't give me coins, never, not a single silver
---
As promised I've implemented cast times and Gold per Hour rates in your sheet.  I also went ahead and applied the fancy format that u/artofthenunchaku suggested (thanks to him for that :D).  I hope this helps people decide exactly what price is their cut off to buy and not buy.  I thought adding the gold per hour rates adds perspective, since most methods of farming gold are measured in gold per hour.  This of course only takes into account time crafting, and omits everything else such as time buying from the AH, looting from Mailbox, running to the Trade Vendor, buying/selling items from the vendor.  
---
My take away from this, at least on my server, is the main watch items are Thick Leather (for leather workers) and (Mageweave cloth for Tailors).
---

---
What does giving all his gold have to do with this?  Makes it sound like you are concerned about gold.... Why?  Why not leave that out entirely?
---
Guilty.
---
I wouldn't think too much of it. I've done the same thing in the past as well. It doesn't matter how well you're getting along with your guildies or how enthusiastic you are about gearing up at that specific moment in time. When shit pops up in real life or you have a slight realization that you're spending way too much time on this, you can just up and quit. You're not obligated to inform anyone, sometimes it's best to sever it without a word.
---
My guild has gotten 6 leafs for hunters from majordomo and not a single eye of divitny for priests. Are we cursed or is it so much lower drop rate?
---
I am the only priest atm with eye of Shadow so I would be first to get it and I'm extra salty!
---
I do think OP have his Bnet so thatll be seen immediatly.
---
Laughs with Faerie Fire
---
How dare he voice his opinion on a public forum. Better just email blizzard privately and take it up with them. Wouldnt want any discussion happening that isnt between them and blizzard
---
I've been playing since release.  I've seen maybe 10-20 dual boxers, and 2 multi-boxers.  
---
Furthermore, you have absolutely no data to back up your claim of "not acting in good faith".  Nor do you have any data to backup the "most multiboxers do it to level accounts for selling."
---
There's an activity you don't like, and you're throwing a fucking paddy because your trip down memory lane wouldn't be complete without you bitching like you used to.
---
Meanwhile, I'm over here enjoying something I did in vanilla when I rolled on a U.S. server and was living in Korea.  That's my trip down memory lane.
---
Yours apparently is just whining like a bitch and throwing out strawman's.
---
I actually had a welfare check called on me back in '09 because one of my guildmates did just this. I don't know if modern Blizzard would do it, but they did it for me back in the day. I know I've heard other people say they had the same thing happen as well.
---
forgot about the BWL boss. But that's in a "high-end" raid environment where the bar is set higher for main-tanks.
---
Yeah, 8s Divine Shield at rank 1, sucks.
---
But, I wouldn't be bragging about killing a paladin 2v1, either.
---
Yeah I've never heard of that ever.
---
Is there an addon or a built-in way to display percentages instead?
---
Price is Right rules?
---
Wtf is this palatank bullshit. It's protpal or prot pally ya damn goof.
---
How do you not just look at the screen? I get this argument for raids but for a 5 man? Lol
---
farm some gold and buy DHC tbh
---
Vaping is XP waste... Quit smoking entirely.
---
Yeah this is definitely it. Also can be enh/bm in 2s.
---
I miss maintankadin so, so much.
---
Pro's of that staff as a warrior, in order of importance.
---
1) One of it not THE highest dps for lvl 20 2h Weapon
---
2) 2 stamina 
---
3) 12 spirit 
---
Pro's of that staff for Priest, in order of performance.
---
1)12 spirit
---
2)2 stamina 
---
How you are weighing these things I don't know, but to say that the comparison is not AT LEAST equal is absurd
---
It does look fucky, don't it?
---
Pick it up and take it to org lol
---
10 days played to 60 is really normal
---
If you are concerned about mental health and/or suicide you can contact a GM and tell them that. I had a friend who stupidly threatened to kill himself to a GM back in TBC, 15 minutes later the police came knocking on the door asking if everything was ok.
---
A small percentage of addicts that will spend 1000/yr on their product is absolutely a market they'll target and exploit, what are you talking about? You get 30 multiboxers and that's justified a single low-tier employee's yearly salary. 
---
1000 5 man multiboxers is $1M/yr in profit. You don't think there's at least 1000 multiboxers doing 5 man multiboxing? What about the 40 man multiboxer, who rakes in 7200/yr to Blizzard? 100 of those 720k in profit. 
---
Out of the millions of WoW subscribers, fewer will quit because of multiboxers than there is revenue brought in by multiboxers, so the math is easy that Blizzard allows clearly cheating behavior because yes, money. If we estimated there was 50,000 5-man multiboxers worldwide, that's still $45M USD/yr in profits.
---
Every mage? Pretty pointless not to, saves time and lives.
---
Yeah - that's what frustrated me. Every run I did, someone always needed the quest it seemed.
---
They will go up. Warriors are among the slowest to level and you will have more and more warriors wanting to craft gear that stays BiS throughout the entirety of the game (lionheart).
---
Prices will be crashing once Dire Maul east comes out and people can farm rich thorium in a dungeon.B Before that prices will rise. Maybe go down abit when p2 gets announced and people get to know how long they will have to hold out until DM:E.
---
I'd rather lick the toilet seats from a truck stop then spend the amount of time it took to find and fish those trunks out.
---
Even if it paid out 1k gold, I still would never spend my time fishing in WoW. It's the most boring thing I can do with my time.
---
You can do 5 instances per hour.  When does the countdown start though?  When you enter the 1st instance, or when you leave?
---
That's not sociopathic. It's sadistic. An actual sociopath wouldn't really grasp or care about how their actions are making others feel, but OP clearly does understand.
---
Try not to use medical terms flippantly.
---
Actually made chars on every EU server and faction to look them up. Found 2 of them (or supposedly their name) but they're never online. And i check regularly. Sorry for using your post for something else, but i really liked his name :)
---
Blizzard definitely used to replace gold and I feel like they still would in certain scenarios.

But I'm pretty sure they don't approve of selling runs for gold. So they definitely won't do shit for you here.
---
Wonderfully done. You need to a make an MC macro that says "Smile for the camera!  ... I said smile, or prepare to find out if you can fly."
---
The *mage already running * kills me everytime
---
Haha it’s the cool guys 😎
---
I feel like I’d agree with this answer if there was intellect or an ancillary effect that benefitted casters. The staff in question is just statted with +stam, +spirit, and +resist. All three stats are usable by warriors as well. 
---
In the case of THIS staff, I think he is fine to have rolled (it’s a melee weapon and there’s no loss of stats).
---
Completely ignoring the rage cost of sunder, there is still the global cooldown to deal with. You can't sunder 4 mobs in 2 seconds.
---
Bro I'm sure his gf or wife made him get rid of wow due to prioritize his life.
---
I do but I definitely need kore time with it. I have the Orbweaver and a Naga mouse, using them together you get the same “3 across 4 down” pattern which is nice and partnered with the Bartender add on you can set your bars up in the same pattern. Being a level 23 rogue I don’t have enough moves to make use of it yet which is why I haven’t set up bartender properly haha. 
---
[This link](https://youtu.be/kXoLNd0v-mU) sold me on it though and hopefully I’ll be able to utilise all the buttons with shift modifiers at 60
---
There are plenty of places where people are able to understand a simple point.
---
Druids are tough to get the hang of, but if you’re looking for world pvp they’re one of the most rewarding classes to play.  Cat form is great of solo ganking and catching people off guard, and if a group materializes you can basically provide whatever everyone else is missing (heals, cc, damage).  Also, the combination of healing, cc, and insane mobility makes you really tough to gank.
---
I like the guys in Thunder Bluff that want a portal to Orgrimmar when it's a 50 copper flight.
---
In a good group the healer makes the most out of the 5sr, the tank pulls at the right time (watches everyone's positioning and their ability resource), and the DPS engages in a threat balancing symbiosis with the tank, and ensure the healer remains unharmed. Following marks, interrupting enemy spellcasts, focusing runners, nuking non-elites first etc. comes naturally to everyone.
---
This is the point from which greatness can emerge.
---
In a great group people pay attention. They do not panic. They use CC at the right time, based on their perception of the tank's ability to stay alive, and the mana keeping him alive will cost the healer. Every member of the group immediately knows which mob is CCd, and adapts to the newly created situation, of which they - the great group - are still in full control. Time lost from not being able to cleave or aoe is balanced against time needed to recuperate after the pull. Efficiency is key.
---
Members of a great group have keybound utility spells like mind soothe, earthbind totem, and curse of tongues and of recklessness, and utilize them well. The press of a key can change everything. In a great group this just happens, everyone notices it, and adapts to the current circumstance. They subsequently enjoy the feeling of being in a great group. Some times they praise each other outright, while other times the praise is indirect, and manifests itself through additions to friends lists, and unfortunately for many a non-great player, less need for the LFG channel.
---
A good group may wipe to an unfortunate event, such as a patrol adding. In a great group such unfortunate events will mostly never happen, but if they do, it only means the healer may have to drink for a few seconds for the first time in what seems like for ever. Not because the warlock pulled aggro with rain of fire the second the patrol entered their screen, and had to be spam healed. This, of course, never happens. It is only beause the time spendt outside of the 5sr while keeping the tank alive was enough to make the mana bar reach 60 %. Being almost at the halfway point feels weird for a great healer, so it is best to make use of the premade water the mage had already provided, without question, the second the healer came close enough to open trade.

I don’t think either is fair. That’s why I’m on a PvE server. Do wish BGs were a thing, though, I do like organized and evensided PvP. Just not onesided bullshit PvP when I’m trying to get other shit done.
---
Why?  They're only good for farming mats and maybe carrying ppl in dungeons. PvP all you need to do is identify and target the lead character, use fearbombs, etc. To disrupt the following characters. 
---
As long as 1.  No automation occurs (keystroke broadcasting isn't automation when used for one keystroke, one action) and 2. These individuals are not engaged in RMT/RWT which even someone with just one account can very easily do. And 3.  All the accounts belong to the same person and are paid for in full. The last part is big for blizz. As long as they get the money..
---
Up voted and hope it turns out the dude is ok contact the GM’s worst they can say is sorry can’t help and best case they call the cops no harm in trying
---
Nah, but it will make it easier.  You can rank one frostbolt multiple groups and then blink directly away from the ensuing mob to get them to congregate in a single line.  It's much harder to get the nice groups that you normally can by mount circling, but its doable.
---
Hi Anoob, I'm dad

Why is it that I can't get another boe ring if I have it binded already? Tried putting it in the bank, taking it off but it still wouldn't let me bid on an auction and would say you already have one equipped.

Interesting, never heard about that.

I have nightfall, grim reach and CoE already, even with 1 point into improved COE. Tbh I'm just deiciding if those 5 points (and more) should go into Drain life or instead something completely different like destro or to top up 5/5 stamina in demo
---
And it appears to go down at roughly the same speed as I fall. My group watched me hover a metre in the air with them before dying.
---
It's possible until profession level 50 (or around that), however I'd very much advice against that! Enchanting doesn't get you much at the beginning, but vendoring those items helps a lot with gold for mount.
---
What the helllllllll?????
---
It's tag wars for some quest mobs. There's no rules in who has right to tag them if we're talking of zones like north Blasted Lands where every quest is about looting. At least on high pop servers none of the mobs with quest loot remained untagged for more than 5s.
---
In 10 hours a Mage can farm ZF and make at least 10X that.
---
Azshara is amazingly beautiful. Unfortunately it also feels entirely unfinished in vanilla.
---
Do you talk shit in trade a lot?
---
DPS warriors will only increase from here on out because they start out on earth, and blast off to the fucking moon through vanilla. When AQ drops, etc, lots of people will want to be dps warr.
---
why gotta bring race into this
---
Think about it like this. Back when Vanilla was it, server caps were around 5000ish.

My entire experience with BRD in vanilla was:

Chromie. The hero we both deserved and needed at the time.
---
Let's be honest: We're talking about WoW here. We all know the issues it can cause in players personal life. Let's not lose sight of the context. 
---
This is not a co-worker who stopped showing up for work, or a friend that stopped attending social events that were regularly held. This is a known commodity that has incredibly adverse effects on a segment of the player base's personal life because of the imbalance to responsibilities and social responsibilities. 
---
Yes, of course, know one knows for certain and we're all just spit balling, but again, context matters. While it's only an assumption, if we're being honest, it certainly has all the *classic* (no pun intended) signs of addiction-related issues.

I've played mmos for 20 years I've seen folks come and go.  Some people have no idea how to play in moderation.  Its entirely likely he was neglecting something in RL and knew nothing short of deleting his account would allow him to prioritize.  I've seen it before and I suspect I'll see it again.
---
Making tailoring items for 1. Yourself to use, 2. To sell on the AH is a very good way to make money (Tailor/Chant here).
---
Gathering profs make ok money as people always need the items - EG: Mining RTVs
---
It removes the awkward "thanks"/"no problem" dialogue. Some people can't really handle it and others just want to do a good deed with no thanks necessary. I bet if he could have given the food anonymously he would have.

For rogues though its special, people just don't want to share meele dps loot with them. Tanks don't want competition on 1h swords/axes, and druids don't want rogues because of leather competition.
---
Exactly this. Yes it's just a game, but there's people on the other side of these avatars. They care about you too.
---
RL is always more important, but your guildmates can be your friends. Take care of yourself, but don't leave them worrying.
---
Rip your account for RMT...(per the other large post)
---
It's thinking Parry this you fucking casual
---
It's gonna be quite a few months before that's a thing :(
---
yeah, my first thought was parents or whatever.  i could see an angry dad doing it
---
Yep, exactly. You really never need to drink like a mage, and you never really need to eat/bandage as much as a normal melee class does since your pet is an absolute beast. Frost Mage is also pretty good but there's a lot more that could go wrong, and it's a lot more attention intensive. A Hunter is like a person driving a lawn mower, the pet being the lawn mower, and the mobs being the grass. It's relaxing and easy.
---
2.3 dps isn't very much to begin with, but comparing 1.2 to 1.5 makes more sense (deathmaw/sfk vs bloodaxe worg) -- pretty sure that math works out to somewhere around 1-1.3dps\*. I would consider that insignificant. 
---
\*i'm not a theorycrafter so don't quote my math
---
Shadow Priests are so strong 1 on 1 with the exception of fighting against a Warlock.  But my vanilla experience as a shadow priest was I could easily beat ever class except Warlocks.
---
I don't touch Shadow Priests and I laugh anytime I see my fellow Horde trying to gank one.  I had a warrior flame and then ignore me after he tried to gank a shadow priest.  I even tried to help but was immediately feared about 50 yards away while he melted the warriors face.  He proceeded to call me bad and ignore.  Not sure what I'm supposed to do when feared for days.

HAH good one.
---
Note to self: Inspect the Tank/Healer before each PUG run.
---
I (priest) joined an sm run with 2 warriors and a paladin and we still were looking for a tank.
---
It took a while to convince them to just take another dps and each of them to tank one mob. The rogue that joined ended up tanking the most.
---
+1
---
That set drops at phase 4 right? I feel like waiting a year or more with tailoring doing nothing isn't really worth it. Cause leveling tailoring again from 0 to 300 will be 100-150g max. Which i would probably make that x10 with a better profession for over a year.
---
There are games you can accomplish lots in 15 mins, like mobile games. Just because it takes you 3 months to get to the end stage of the game vs your buddy's 3 weeks it doesnt matter. It matters that you enjoy yourself. Guarented that person who got to 60 in 3 weeks is looking at someone who got to 60 in 2 weeks. Ect.
---
Don't you usually take 1 point in improved Blizzard so it doesn't overwrite the cone of cold slow? Or was that a private server thing?
---
While it's true that Dire Maul came out after, more people farmed Dire Maul than Deadmines. The more popular dungeon gets priority on the nickname, and so Deadmines lost DM to Dire Maul and picked up VC.
---
Yeah RIP my inbox
---
Had a warrior tank using it last night as soon as it was off cooldown... in SFK... the place that already has a 75% healing debuff I have to deal with when the mage is busy fecking off and isn’t decursing.
---
Yes, when I was the closest to killing myself, I did things like that in what I thought would be my final days.
---
I mean if you are 5 boxing shamans. Or undead mages yeah it would be easy. But why would it be easy for anyone else?
---
Because it's a lot easier to get a simultaneous backstab with one press of the button, than organizing 5 rogues to party together and timing it perfectly.
---
You can climb around on the ropes of the boat and get to positions where you're hard to see and hard to get to.  Easy to attack or mc from there.
---
With several of my other guildmates, that is what I would suspect. He wasn't online every day though - he hadn't even hit 60.
---
&gt;Some people here think DPS should never pull agro. That is true in some instances. But fast clearing groups sometimes cannot keep agro off the DPS all the time. The important thing here is to communicate and be on the same page with the group. And if it is a PUG, lean towards taking things slower until you get a feel for the group. 
---
It depends when the aggro is pulled off the tank. If the mob is a second or two away from dying or running, no problem. If it's constantly early in the fight, then it's the DPS opening up too early. Every so often is understandable, sometimes RNG blesses/curses the DPS with a few big crits when they open and sometimes the tank will have a few sunders in a row miss... but that's what taunt is for.
---
12. Do you guys not have phones?
---
I am looking forward to DI on the Asus ROG II though. As well as everything at Blizzcon, cause Blizzcon.
---
Up until the 40s staffs have comparable damage. Really, you just want a high dps 2hander that is 3.0 speed or slower; the type of weapon is irrelevant.
---
How are you farming that gold as a warrior? Not a traditional class to have earned such a good income
---
I think if you lag it's  best to play a dps class or specc. As a healer in a group with lag you would have trouble keeping up ^^
---
The ones wanting to avoid the rogues at the bottom of them?
---
What are they doing this for goldfarming? Selling premade accounts?
---
Also specced resto and leveling goes fine, certainly not slower than a priest at least :D
---

Face to face trade, he was originally asking 350g and said "I know what I have" and I was like "I know what you have too, so I'd be willing to pay you 300g right now with 100g on loan to secure the deal" and he agreed.  
---
Paid the 100g a couple days later. I have only seen one other pair being sold besides mine.
---
Great to know. To the average person walking for 15 minutes is fucking useless time wasted.
---
His fiance is in the guild actually. She hasn't logged in for some time though.
---
Basically, use whatever weapon has the highest DPS, unless the DPS is only a really minor upgrade to your current weapon and you know you'll be getting a different type of weapon soon and don't want to invest the time in getting your weapon skill up. Just be sure to train up your weapon skill once you get a new weapon before taking it into a dungeon or trying to fight anything tough.

---
Damn....That's smart.
---
This is of course server dependent, but there's plenty of money to be made with tailoring, you just need to look for it.
---
This is pure speculation, but it sounds to me like you're falling into the trap of "craft stuff everyone needs because it sells the most", and while that's technically true, it leaves out the important bit which is a lot of people think that and as such the competition is fierce.

&gt; pull when healer is oom, LOS the healer by no reason, let the healer take some damage or have a mob on him preventing proper healing on tank or having to heal himself at time or even being hit by a silence / disable that shouldn’t in case the mob was proper tanked. 
---
As a long-term healer, almost all of those are the healer's fault, and he's a lazy ass if he says otherwise.
---
Got a mob? Run to tank.
---
Got hit by a silence? Almost always, don't stand in stupid.
---
Tank LOS? Anything past SM, you losing LOS on tank is your positioning. Move your lazy ass to the tank.
---
OOM? Fucking call that shit out. 
---
While pulling too much or not using basic abilities is "the tank's fault", so is not being a brain-dead moron. If your tank is a brain dead moron, get him replaced.
---
I think bears work well with mages. It's hard being a warrior with aoe mages because i have to sunder each guy individually, so single target dps is a lot easier for me. But my understanding is that bears are much more suited to holding aoe aggro. So maybe give it a shot.
---
ill take a stab as to why - but do not support it because you should be allowed to ask anything you want.

People are upset that you are seemingly not caring about the person who deleted the account and think youre an asshole.

He may be depressed and losing interest in hobbies. I did something very similar in eve a while back. Normally I talk and joke a lot but I started getting more and more depressed so much less talkative and not really making jokes anymore and people started asking about it. Finally I told them I was extremely depressed and getting worse. They were supportive, but I eventually just quit playing due to losing interest from my depression and mailed my 2billion isk (eve money) to a guy who was always really nice to me the day before I quit. That night I told everyone I really appreciated talking to them on there and really appreciated all the support they gave me and then I just never logged back on. 
---
I probably scared some people, but I just wasnt thinking clearly because of how I felt. I really hope that's not the case here though, but if he sees this somehow and he is depressed, hopefully it'll help him know he's not alone. Also, it really helps to keep doing the things that used to make you happy even if they're not anymore especially if you have good people to talk to. That can really, really help. And it does get better over time!
---
Anyways, I wish you and your friend luck, and I hope you have a good night!

What's that health Mana bars add-on unare using?
---
What in the world is your problem, dude?
---
Had a healer the other day in a SM Cath group who went oom legitimately every pull. Come to realize he was using all of his mana on dpsing and when called out he called both the tank and I "fa**ots", whole group reported him, swift kick from group then found another healer mins later and finished with absolutely no problems.
---
Honestly the toxicity of that player surprised me. There will always be those few unfortunately
---
Which realm / faction are you on? I need you in my life
---
Right? Giving away valuables is one of the telltale signs of an impending suicide attempt.
---
It's not much, but how much of a difference it makes is not what's up for discussion, what's up for discussion is whether or not it's better, which it objectively is.
---
About the same on Horde side
---
&gt;As you say, you're always going to buff everyone else with salvation, its almost mandatory except maybe on the healer, so they miss out on their precious kings, might or wisdom (which they wouldnt have anyway if they had a war instead of a pala).
---
I like to tell groups that those moves are for healer/dps paladins. They are better positioned to use their abilities for support. As tank I gotta tank, and like you said, if I was any other tank they'd get no buffs.  
---
Controlling the field through buffs is a huge benefit to the Paladin tank. Example, you can Salvation everyone except the Hunter's pet, and let the pet off-tank if a mob gets pulled to the squishies. Tactics like this require more coordination than most players are used to, though, so it's best used with players you know or whom seem attentive.
---
Wow this is crazy, I hope you can contact him and that he's okay :/ good luck

But the top comment says otherwise....
---
Did you ever PvP in vanilla?  1.2 or 1.0 attack speed is just ferocious in PvP especially on a cat with Bite/Claw.
---
If you follow the cookie cutter builds then I wholeheartedly agree. But I have been running soul link/master demo with intensity in the destro tree for pugs. It allows for me to hellfire a lot and even if I gain aggro from a mob or two I'll survive and even be able to hellfire on.
---
That being said, my build is pretty shit on single-target and 2-target cleave since it doesn't run Ruin, imp corruption or suppression. But when it's 4 or more mobs, og boy does it play well!
---
This is something I think about doing sometimes, just watching to find the right flavor bleach before I commit.
---
Only if your tank (and to a lesser extent healer). Otherwise you'll be in LFG doing LF1M Tank for a while. Good tanks always make their own groups (sadly).
---
Bummer
---
.  Thank you newsboys
---
It's a *Shaman* guide. There should be no 'Alliance Only' tab.
---
That depends entirely on your auto loot settings. If you auto loot by default, then you hold shift by default to keep from auto looting. If you don't auto loot by default, you hold shift to auto loot.

I checked for “weapons” the other day and only had a handful  was pretty sad that’s when I knew and found out it was different then faction specific AH lol
---
Any advice given to the masses is usually generic. Hellfire can be fine to use situationally. But don’t be the warlock who hellfires and expects heals when the healer is struggling to keep everyone else up.
---
But only on Tuesdays.
---
Hi there, thanks for the kind words. You're on Pagle? Ally or Horde?
---
Former GM here.  I've seen people let WoW do some crazy fucking shit to their lives.

That's why you don't 1v5+ (whether it's 5 players or 1, it's still 5 characters.)

Isnt this place felwood?
---
All cc against players caps at 10-15s, then gets halved for each successive use. The maximum duration will not exceed the standard duration, so a 6s cc still lasts 6s, but a 40s one is reduced to 10-15s. 
---
After suffering four hits from the same diminishing returns category, the player is immune to further debuffs from it, regardless how long the previous uses lasted.
---
They are what the game presents as the best gear for that gear level, even if I. Actuality they aren't great.
---
 You wont get threat from a renew if you cast it before the tank gets into combat and you stay out of combat.
---
Had a team of 4 looking to do Mara, we are all new to wow and hadn't run Mara before and wanted to do all the quests. Of course in 2019 it's not hard to find a guide but still we kinda acknowledged that we would have to take it a bit slow. 
---
We advertised it accordingly. The guy that joined kept trying to convince us to do a Princess Run though. I was fully expecting this guy to quit despite the fact that he joined knowing the circumstances. But in a rare case of common decency he actually stayed the whole time despite what was probably a frustrating pace for him.

I’ll do a sales pitch for the classes:

Shaman: Big Numbers in any role

Druid: Play literally any role

Mage: AoE and control for days

Hunter: the chillest class by far, great farmer
---
Warrior:  Because no kid grew up wanting to wear robes
---
Rogue: Ganking is fun, don’t lie to yourself

Giving things away to friends is also an indicator of people who decide to kill themselves.

I feel like those levels are just bad for leveling.

I'm at 53 on my hunter. It's the point where you grind high level zones or dungeon, but ~50-54 you're to low to do BRD runs for most groups but to high for any decent dungeons.

For real if the people you play with are that important to you as people and friends connect outside of a video game. Facebook, personal numbers. If you are friends and are close, connect in other ways!  
---
Hope they are ok
---
They rebuilt it, instead of taking the easy way to give us a true classic.
---
I know WoW gold isn't 'real' in the tangible sense, but giving away possessions can be a sign that somebody is contemplating or planning suicide.
---
I'm not sure if publicly reaching out is the best solution, but I applaud you for looking out for your friend! If you can think of any other ways to contact them (eg if you know their address, your country's police may be able to do a 'wellness visit' to check on this person) that would be ideal.
---
And remember to look after yourself during this process. Helping somebody who may be suicidal can be draining and impact your own mental health, so be sure to treat yourself, keep up your self-care, and be kind to yourself. And remember that while it's good to step in and try to prevent this, ultimately their decisions are their own, and you are not to blame for anything that may happen.
---
And... we. Are. Here. For. You. Too!
---
Pretty sure it's Felwood, yeah.
---
Please do not mock sexual assault you disgasting man.
---
Yes it is lol.
---
You both actually seem to be pretty on curve. Gold ramps up quickly in the 30s.
---
Respect the tank and the healer more than the DPS meter. 
---
* If the tank puts up a skull, focus that target instead of AoEing
---
* Give the tank a chance to sunder everything or build AoE threat before going gung ho
---
* Try and use Frost Nova for when the healer gets mobs.  Don't just default to using it as a saving grace for when you pull aggro from AoEing
---
* Give food and water
---
The stigma comes from mages who want to just spam max DPS, and make it a headache for everyone else.  Do this in a spell cleave group, not in a normal group.
---
Vampiric Embrace is a straight percentage of the damage dealt. The only way to increase its healing amount is to increase the damage you deal.
---
You can sell shadoweave set for leveling locks. And the frostweave for mages. And if your already that far might as well make a profession alt and go that route with like alchemy and herb
---
Really? Hmmm. My experience has been alliance pops up and 5 horde jump on em lol
---
I don't want to rule out the possibility I have been a complete ass at some point that I do not remember or did not realize at the time either.  I am human.  I have probably fucked up.
---
Turning in useful quests on that island. Blood elves to the north are a great grind for melee, drop some nice stuff occasionally if there wasnt 6 mages there blowing them up always.
---
Same here at least a dusin times through out wows history.
---
I think it's not efficient in a raid setting where the hot damage will most likely get sniped. 8 piece transcendance becomes bis for a lot of fights later but in dungeons renew is very strong.
---
Seems like most people on this subreddit don’t have a realistic grasp of how much time they spend playing this game. Anyone with a job and six days /played at the moment has spent about 50% of their free time since release playing this single game. That is an INSANE amount from the average person’s perspective.
---
Honestly, a good portion of the people on this subreddit do not have a healthy relationship with this game
---
It's because the game thinks the ore node is outside, and when you go into a cave the game stops rendering anything in the outside world, so the node disappears.
---
Made popular by twitch streamers, experienced vanilla players using discord. Noobs try to immulate, then blame one another when it fails in chat. Often faster to play it safe and single target. A few wipes, make the run take far longer.
---
The rave cave!
---
NPC mind control is weird right now, yes. Got m
---
MCd by Oracle in EPl a few days ago when the guy who pulled her died and instantly released spirit. The mobs reset, I was still MCd and out of range to re aggro when released. I still had no control over my character, instead I ran a weird route to the graveyard.
---
The spellcleave only types, and the antispellcleave elitists? You guys look absolutely the same to me.
---
I'm right there too.  Got pally up to 26, switched to rog and got that to 29 then started a warrior the other day, that's up to 17 now.  Don't know if I'll ever cap a toon but so what, i'm having fun.
---
Come home friend
---
It's a Line of Sight pull. Melee mobs will run to you when you pull them, which is great because you can move the pile wherever you want. Casters will just stand there and cast at you from a distance. The way to make these caster mobs move is to shoot them / face pull / Faerie Fire / etc and then disappear behind a wall or rock or whatever else to break their line of sight. They won't be able to cast at you anymore since they lost line of sight. This causes them to chase you down and run until they can see you again.
---
This is particularly helpful when dealing with humanoids who run away before they die. Yes you can try to slow them or stun them or whatever, but the best practice is to pull them back just far enough where a stray runner won't get close enough to another pack to mess up your day. The tank shoots the mob he wants to pull, ducks behind a wall, and the pack you're working on comes directly to you. Nice, clean, efficient, and quick.
---
Problem happens is when the tank shoots the mob, ducks behind the corner, and some DPS decides it's time to go in and start attacking before the pack moves. Then the mobs are no longer interested in the tank and just stay where they were.
---
You could set up 2 accounts.
---
But at that point I'd rather spend in-game gold on food and water.  Which is what I do.
---
Yeah sometimes out in the world I see people being attacked by 2-3 sometimes 4 mobs, can they handle it? Maybe. But I try to lighten the load by taking 1 off them. 
---
I never know if what I'm doing though is a good thing, ie, saving their life. Or "mobstealing"
---
Are you the hunter?
---
What am I looking at here?
---
Sounds to me (given the outleveling) that his real life was suffering significantly from his playtime and probably decided to give it up cold turkey. As much as we all love the game, good on him for doing so, it can be a real issue as we all probably know.
---
Lets say you enter the instance #1 at 19h05 , #2 at 19h15 , #3 at 19h25, #4 at 19h35 and #5 at 19h45 then the first reset will be at 20h05 , then reset #2 at 20h15 and so on
---
I had a similar experience the other day in the hinterlands. I died near a priest and asked if he could rez me because I was clear across the map from the gy. He rezzed me, whispered "asking people for rezzes while questing is fucking stupid of you" and put me on ignore before I could even say thanks lol
---
To join in with the noise, joining in later actually means gearing up faster.
---
Let’s say you’re the eight mage on a raid team and the raids been going for 8 weeks when you are ready to join them. That’s 8 weeks of drops they already have and will be defaulted to you.
---
This world as in planet Earth?  Interesting perspective, but not one I will be personally exploring.
---
The monthly renewal could of been coming and they didn't want to re up. It's a game and for people with time consuming lives it's not a priority.
---
But hope he's okay regardless.
---
I don't think we were on the same server. My warrior was certainly not "well above half HP" unless you only have 174 HP at level 37....and I didn't whisper the war I saved. I used /s.
---
I also passed on a bunch of mobs that were clearly taken and ended up punting on the quest as I didn't get a single Stone Tablet to drop after an hour of shitty grinding. That said, on my server, there were a pair of priests mobstealing every spawn...but I don't think we were on the same server.
---
Is there anything else as rare?
---
3 bars to 58 - 1,430g
---
replace `[@mouseover]` with `[@mouseover,exists][]` and enable auto selfcast in settings.
---
Muh karma pls
---
if a warrior wants to change between a 2h and a 1h+shield in a battle they will pair the weapon swap with their stance change.  that way they only incur one GCD.  if the equipement change is paired with an ability it forces 2 GCD.
---
*feeling cute. Might do some dungeons with my new guild later.*
---
"Cleave" as in hitting multiple targets at once.  Spellcleave because it's spells doing it.  It's just the name for the strategy.
---
This shit really only happens in the low level SM or ZF newbie spell cleave groups. You can entirely avoid them by A) Making your own groups B) Making sure you don’t join such groups C) Waiting until your past these dungeon level ranges to join dungeons again. Don’t get discouraged by them. As a tank, I’ve went through the same BS but it really does get better once you smarten up and level up.
---
I had a paladin friend in BC named Davedweling who I played with every day for about a year and a half. One day I logged on and noticed he was not on my friends list anymore. I looked him up on the armory and it was gone. Never heard from him ever again. :(
---
LMAO death drop redefined
---
Why vpn?
---
MAGE GO FACEFIRST WITHOUT EVEN SHIELDING YOURSELF GO GO GO
---
This is what I had to do. I couldn't see the hunter pets in non raid profiles.
---
Maybe, we still had queues around that time, so maybe he just got fed up and transferred.    Last thing he said to me before disappearing was "We need to start running BRD" (few people were JUST approaching the levels to do it) to which I told him "Yup, pretty soon".
---
The fuck is a ‘damage’ healer

This is definitely Felwood

That may not be his style but I understand the concern.

When AQ patch Cenarion Hold becomes a fully fletched quest hub.
---
I disagree. It might no be for the same reasons as with 60 but still. When i get to like rank 8 healing touch why would i use that all the time? It heals like a full bar and i will either be overhealing all the time with it or letting the tank get too low and risk him dying. I know priests have all kinds of heals but as a druid where you definitelly should downrank

---
What I meant there is sometimes we run groups where the understanding is that agro will get pulled off the tanks. It works well when you over gear the content more so than when you are barely geared enough for the content. But in you average PUG, DPS is responsible for not consistently pulling agro. You don’t want DPS to hold back so much that they never pull agro as that will slow you down a lot. But DPS should also not go crazy and pull agro every pull. In most standard groups, DPS should rarely pull agro.  
---
But not all groups are standard groups. I was in a group a few days back, where the warrior had 700+ DPS on some AOE packs (60 warrior with pre-raid BIS and some Raid gear). The bear tank could not consistently hold agro. The priest healer was geared enough where healing the warrior was not a problem. I was the scrub newbie lock in the group who did insignificant damage. The healer, tank, and warrior understood that damage would not always be on the tank. Given this, it was totally acceptable for the DPS warrior to pull agro. But unless the healer and tank were on board, the warrior would have had to hold back damage some. 
---
This is a long way of saying, that damage on DPS is not always a bad thing. But unless the party as a whole is okay with it (especially tank and healer), DPS should chill out and rarely pull agro.
---
Dont you need to hold a certain rank to get it?
---
that's straight up wrong.
---
Farclip is hardcoded in the classic client at 2112 (and horizonstart at 777). Sliders or changing them via cvars does nothing. they are at 2112 / 777 at Graphics Quality slider 1 or 10.
---
Original wow had farclip max of 777, but it also had several other deprecated cvars affecting distance eg horizonfarclip going up to 2112.
---
The three sliders in current client each control multiple cvars in a way that's not intuitive at all. Many cvars also remain static no matter where the sliders are. This is important practically - for example putting the quality slider to 10 then manually changing the other two sliders plus all the dropdown options to exactly how they look at Quality 7 is NOT THE SAME as actually putting the Quality slider on 7, many (hidden) cvars will remain at their "10" setting.
---
There are few cvars you can change that actually do something visually - the four "lodObject" cvars are the best example. In general just setting all three sliders to max will achieve 99% of anything possible to achieve via cvars, since again many of them are simply hardcoded to static values or are already maxed out at slider 10.
---
Practically the only thing people need to worry about is "groundEffectFade" which for some insane reason is static at 70, while groundEffectDist and groundEffectdensity change depending on where you have your Ground Clutter slider. So at clutter slider 10 you will have distance 320 and density 256, but fade still at 70 which causes little pebbles and grass to pop up right in front of your face as you're going forwards. Simply set "groundEffectFade" to match your groundEffectDist (320 at slider 10, with a cvar max of 500) to get rid of this annoyance.
---
lodObjectCullSize is 14 at graphics/detail sliders 10, but you can set it lower to 5 or even 1 to make small crates and such appear from further away (lower number is better). lodObjectCullDist is static at 30 but goes up to 200 for a similar effect. lodObjectFadeScale maxes out at 150 with sliders, but can be set up to 300.

All the above is easily done with the AdvancedInterfaceOptions addon.

Last time I quit WoW I got myself banned so that I knew if I came back I'd have to start from scratch.
---
I see, good point. I wouldnt have thought to bind it to another skill.
---
Hey man I’m just being honest. I have no problem with anyone looking at that post and this post. 
---
I’m not going to lie about who I am or how I play. If anything the post you linked gives people better insight into whether or not they want to play with me. 
---
You’ll get punished for being honest but praised for being fake as fuck.
---
I don’t actually write any scripts. I can find what I need online.
---
What’s difficult is juggling around playing 5 toons at once, especially multi-comp teams where you’re playing 3 dps 1 heal 1 tank.
---
If you have ever played a minute of wow, you would know that juggling the abilities of one character is hard enough for some people that they fail at the game.
---
It’s an entirely different experience running 5 toons at once. 
---
I got a Hunter to 38 before I started multi boxing in Classic.
---
Questing is an easy joke. Since I was leveling with my buddy, ganking wasn’t bad and we avoided many gank attempts. Finding a dungeon requires me to wait 5-20 minutes for me to get in as a DOS and the majority of runs are smooth and easy.
---
Questing on 5 hunters is an entirely different game. I need to keep 5 pets happy. I need to micromanage 5 bags. I need to micromanage quest completions across 5 characters. I need to fend off the people who want to attempt to gank me, especially when they’re higher level. They are often left surprised that it wasn’t as easy as they thought.
---
I can’t join a dungeon group, I need to go into the dungeon with my 5 hunters and strategize to take the dungeon apart without having a healer which results in long Rez runs. Some bosses and trash packs require strategy and planning or they will tear through my pets and eat my team alive.
---
It’s an entirely different game with a different set of challenges. But it isn’t loleasymode arcane shot x5 ded.
---
No, the orc bastards cut our trees down. We love our damn trees!

I fuck around with taming rare hunter pets and world PvP for my #'s to be relevant.

Man when I played private servers I'd still utilize the wayback machine recordings of the forums there so much good theorycraft and math.

This is practically an AMA. OP keeps insisting his psyche is stable.

LEEEEROYYYY JENKINS
---
This happens regularly with Gnomeregan. Underlevelled and/or inexperienced groups tend to wipe in the long corridor to the final boss, then group disbands and one guy has the genius idea to form a new group for final boss, but not tell anyone that everything else has already been cleared.

I know

The action his friend took mattered, not the amount.

Were you on aegwynn? When I was playing WotLK, there was a guy running around with 40 accounts. It was always a relief to see you him in AV

See it’s been so long that I forgot how long it actually takes to hit 60. Reading these makes me feel a bit better about my pace. Considering I’ve been playing more or less casually(same hours spent playing as I was spending playing other games prior/ not slacking on real life stuff)

call in your guild, your friends, and even your parents. I want to wake up to atleast -50 on both of these comments or I will be seriously disappointed in you reddit, finish what you've started

[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-dps-pvp-classic-wow) guide states that an important part of PVP'ing as a Hunter is using Feign Death to remove yourself from combat followed immediately with placing a freezing trap. This is important for opponents who are in your dead zone. However, I've used feign death several times now against an opponent out in the open world and when i immediately after try to drop a freezing trap it says I cannot do that while in combat. What am I missing?
---
Hope this has a happy ending, come home!
---
If upgrade - roll 
---
If not upgrade/instantly equipping- no roll
---
Thats pretty good.
---
They do, but it's more to get a lead on threat. You can pop a single charge on a boss and that should be sufficient.
---
Ooohhhh....I bet you've got some stories.
---
Easy solution. Add all rogues to your shit list
---
On the plus side, phase 3 BGs will be instant for the alliance.  Some more bad news is that the alliance will also lose all of those instant BGs.
---
I've personally done this a few times in the past myself. When you realize you can't control your addiction, the best way is to remove the temptation of that addiction. That means deleting your games, canceling your account,  unsubbing from everything  related to the game (like reddit and YT). I send my gold to my friends too, because that was a way for me to burn my bridges. I knew it would be less tempting for me to return if I knew I  had given away most of my stuff and had to work to get it back.
---
If this is the case with your guildie, the best thing you can do is let him be. Even you remind him of what he is trying to escape. As hard as it may sound. 
---
Either way I hope he is okay.
---
I'll drink to that!
---
You should get another monitor.
---
When you are 15 and only played private servers you just blame everything on retail.

Reminds me of the time I got silenced for a week and when I asked the GM why I got silenced, it was because I told someone to uninstall Overwatch 8 months prior to the silence and because of that one small instance they wouldn't remove the silence.

Absolutely same! Been gone for a while and currently

Working on my dissertation... then the old guild returns so here I am :P

Yeah people seem to treat terms of service as if they are stating a legal definition.  Yes its botting, but blizz lets it slide for money.  That doesn't mean its no longer botting, its just "approved botting".

Bad bot

God DAE HATE multiboxers? Me &amp; my 4 friends that play together constantly &amp; gank everyone find it so annoying when we fight 5 people and it turns out instead of 5 individual players it's 1 guy playing 5 accounts  UGGGHGHGHGHG BLAZZARD PLS BAN
---
I like using the dungeon guides to make sure I have picked up all the relevant quests. I defintely don't use the leveling or class guides though.
---
Yeah, I stopped playing it at 18 because I was doing the Bristleboar quest for the 60 tusks, and I would kill the mobs so slowly in bear form that they would respawn in 1v2 or 1v3s and I died constantly. Being out of bear killed the mobs quicker, but I would have to drink as well. I don't know what level exactly that cats get their abilities, but I figure it's probably not all right away. While I know every class has their struggle points, I don't think I could stomach another 10 levels like that current gameplay without doing it 1 level at a time every few days or something.
---
To get rid of the grey boxes I picked the tukui17 the not 18. Right clicking on the x when bags open you can see all bag slots. As said previously, tukui DT to change data texts by right clicking and selecting clock over the map text. Do tukui DT again to close.
---
Playing a lvl 36 warrior with my wife. Playing a lvl 32 warlock when she doesn't want to/can't play. Not a lot of play time but I want to play more. That mount grind is rough.
---
What you're describing is a literal bot. Some multiboxers might be doing that and it's against EULA, but real multiboxing just uses a combination on in-game macros and a program/macro to send a keystroke to multiple windows.
---
So pressing Alt + 1 might cause character 1 to press 1 in-game which might be a /follow macro on the main character. Then 2 to set focus/assist targets, then whatever else to do your actual rotation/use abilities.
---
They don't literally play themselves. You still have to target, cast all the abilities, follow, accept/turn in quests, loot quest items, etc... on all the characters individually.
---
Exactly what I did. Sent gold and all items to guildie. Said goodbye in chat and deleted.
---
Yeah, and when you do take damage it's hard to get back into the rhytm again, at least for me!
---
&gt;we were close
---
Do you know their real name and surname, phone number, home address? Did you talk on the phone or in person regularly outside the game? People sometimes think that because someone 'opened up' to them on Discord or Wow it means they're friends.
---
I have fun with my guild mates in-game and sometimes we talk about real life, but when I log off I don't even think about them. I consider them part of the game and not my personal life. I've done exactly what your guild mate did, reason being I just decided I wanted to play on another server.
---
There's also the possibility he might feel like he overshared his personal info and wants to disappear and forge a new clean identity on a new character somewhere.

One of my best friends at the time and I played vanilla together - he got me into it. I joined his guild and got to know all of the members... they knew we were connected in real life, and any time we “partied” we ended up in ventrilo at his house BSing with our guild. We were super cool... 
---
One day, he told a mutual in game friend he was done. He was going to take his life, which supposedly he had said before, but this time he sent all of his gold and valuable in game items to our mutual friend.
---
By some miracle, I was online at the time and he reached out to me. I called my friend a few times and he didn’t pick up... I got pretty concerned. It’s one thing to say that, and even then it’s serious, but to give hundreds of gold we worked hundreds of hours for was something he’d never do. I searched the white pages for his parents’ number, ended up calling and mentioning I was concerned with a bit of the back story. Turns out he had an attempt on his life that night, and his parents found him and got him to the hospital in time to prevent the worst case scenario... this guys message to me in WoW saved my friends life.
---
I’m not exactly sure why I’m sharing this... the last thing I want is for you to think this is the situation here, but I will always remember this story. The day World of Warcraft, and our mutual friend Sneakykitty saved my best friends life. We’ve since grown apart.. that’s just how life works I guess, but I think about him often and hope he’s kicking ass in classic somewhere.

Chill some more. In the coming month or two a lot more will hit 60 wanting to raid. Try finding one of them young guilds with ambitions of raiding

Not too bad if you count all the fish you caught that can be cooked into raid food

Its the gaming equivelent of sober october
---
I have been summoned. Check my comment history if you want to see what I had to say the other day but I would agree it's probably a good idea to stick with that 18 druid and level it to 30 or at least 25 or so before you dismiss it. Once you have cat form and a few talents in feral (and probably a few of the balance/resto talents that are incredibly useful for feral) the gameplay can change somewhat drastically with a much heavier focus on melee if that's your thing. A lot of the feral talents are useful for both bear and cat form too, so there's no respec needed for switching between tank, DPS and solo play. If you keep a set of healing gear and don't mind drinking a bit then you should be able to heal lower/mid level dungeons without respeccing either, though I can't speak for the later levels as of yet.
---
Overall it's a ridiculously versatile class with tons of utility and I'm having tons of fun with it. While it's not the best alt choice in terms of gold farming/PvP or whatever, given that you already have one I would say see it through another ten levels if you can to see more of what the class has to offer, because it really is a lot.

Wow Classic is kinda boring sometimes, and it's fun sometimes. The differing "wavelengths" of the game for lack of a better word make it fun. Even when I am doing something boring and repetitive, I have to remain mentally engaged, aware of my surroundings, aware of runners, ready to spell interrupt, aware of patrols, etc. The boring mob grind very quickly evolves into me coming up with some zany way of juggling to 3 mobs that just aggro'd -- then, we are back to a relaxing long boring drink, refeed, revive pet, etc. It's all about that "delta" -- the shifting tempo and ups and downs in mental engagement makes vanilla fun. Whereas retail is always just sorta "mildly stimulating at all times, mildly easy at all times, same quick zerg pace at all times".

druid is tank or heal specced?

Do people really think everytime someone points out a person is being callous that they are "offended"? 
---
No one is offended. The guy making the joke just isn't funny and acting a bit like a jerk. No one is clutching their pearls.
---
let him explore the world at his own pace , just do the quest with him and answer any questions he may have.
---
if you have done the NE started zone before dont rush through the quest , let him figure out where he needs to go and what needs to be done and you just follow him (unless he asks for help), IMO the NE starter zone is the best  ,
---
also you should kill your own mobs , and dont help him kill his, he needs to learn what to do by himself
---
I believe it is a bug. It is supposed to take you out of combat
---
I'm a hunter, if I'm hunting you, it doesn't matter what class you are, you're dead.

But If I'm caught off guard by a mage or a rogue then I'm dead.

I came here for the Night Elf model of Sylvanas, not the post-Wrath model! 
---
All jokes aside. The painting looks awesome.
---
Mate when I found that shortcut yesterday I almost broke down in tears.
---
I had been walking around the long way for most of the zone
---
I ground beasts and vendored hella leather as a warrior , mostly in desolace and stv with a bit in Arathi... if you don’t have skinning just look up what near your level has the most expensive vendor trash drops and hope for some boe weapons or mail/plate to vendor off
---
I'd add to this, the biggest mistake I've seen bad healers make, is not downranking their healing spells and as a result massively overhealing and blowing all their mana.
---
I was gonna call bullshit on your 50%. But I wanted to back up my claim and did the calculations and you're right on point lol. 
---
I am sitting on 3 days played and it doesn't feel nearly as much as 25%.
---
Is skinning really worth the time? Will I be able to sell anything on AH for good profit once Iam skinning 60 dungeons and raids?
---
Does your key disappear after one use? 3 uses? Never? Depending on the uses I would charge the person with the win the amount so if costs 1g to make and goes away in one chest then 1g please sir. If it’s 3 uses then 34 silver please. And if it never goes away then just make friends and open for free letting everyone roll.

He's probably in a mental ward somewhere
---
He is trying to say that people who say they took time off work to play a video game are just hiding the fact they are unemployed.
---
I am glad you are alive! I hope everything is okay with you friendo.
---
How viable is leveling 48-60 as a dual wield fury warrior?
---
Seriously. If you can reach out to a person that has gone cold do it.
---
If the person intentionally has gone cold, nothing changed. I would even argue going completely cold in such an important part of your life is bad.
---
But if there's something more going on - that reaching out might pull people back from the fringe. 
---
Deleting people from contacts. Deleting people from friends. In WoW terms: deleting characters. All those things point towards "cutting contact" with all social contacts. "No one cares about me". Reach out to those people. Drop a simple "Hey, haven't seen you online in a while. We miss you". It might help those people.
---
OP is incorrect, you can read my reply to him for details
---
Am I missing something? Honestly... priest said “go” and he knew mage was trying to pull... he dropped the ball on that one. Not even a bubble.
---
Cries in priest. Lol
---
Back to it!
---
thats how i got called a ninja looter when i got my BiS Rogue boots and this other rogue didnt : )
---
Similar thing happened to me but I discovered it on my own I was almost about to cry.
---
Fucking bullshit I spent the entire zone walking around
---
My ex-girlfriend had a minor "thing" with my video gaming hobby due to a previous boyfriend of hers who was one of those WoW stereotype players. She said he actually, in real life, pissed into soda bottles rather than pausing his gameplay.
---
Not that im aware of , you can just take note of the time when you first enter the instance and when you enter for every other reset .
---
As a tank, I always state it simply: If it doesn't have a sunder on it, it won't stick to me.
---
Damage gear without crit is in your lane. Check out Ooze spriest on YouTube/twitch. He’s thinks there should be, at most, 1 shadow priest. He made a guild around it.
---
Yeah but good luck trying to get blizz to enforce it.  People have been trying for over a decade and blizz has either stayed silent or outright supported it.
---
Nice bro you proved my point. I see the snowflake comment everywhere.
---
I donated an expensive item (worth around 100g) to a Guild Master who seemed like a really cool person. He/she was always donating gold to guildies through some games / competition. I thought, why not? So instead of selling it at the AH and make my mount gold, I just donated the item to guild. A week later I find out he deleted his character and all battle net friends. Nobody knows what happened.
---
I hope this person is OK but I’m upset.
---
Ikr, I see this argument pop up on every multibox thread. It's like there is a club for being a fucking idiot that goes around looking for multibox threads.
---
I hope everything is okay with your friend. Even if he doesn't want to get back into WoW I hope lets you know he is okay.
---
Working in games here, can confirm, this is standard procedure for customer support in online games, at least in the MMO sector. We actually DO read your tickets.
---
IMO hunter.
---
I found mage to be unbearably dull to level. I don't blame them for wanting to AoE grind, it's the only remotely interesting way for them to level and even then it's tedious.
---
Hunter isn't as "optimal", but it's more interesting IMO despite having a get simple "minimal" mode of play (which is actually nice if you want to zone out while playing a bit).
---
Pet happiness and arrows aren't nearly the pain in the ass msges' constant need to drink is. Just remember to keep stocked up on food/arrows
---
And I like that you can play both simple or advanced - eg simple questing you can just shoot till dead with pet on it, or you can go all out kiting to solo a powerful elite.
---
Plus getting that 30% movement at 20 is a godsend in classic, and makes gathering professions easier especially pre-40.
---
I thought you were close?
---
thats why u gotta do LFM BRD Princess Runs
---
&gt; To me it's the non-RPers who scoff at them that are actually cringey
---
It's not at all scoffing at them *roleplaying* or the act thereof. It's them saying "lol" at people who are trying to roleplay in a busy OOC hotspot.
---
As much as "roleplay everywhere and anywhere" on an RP server does have it's appeal, it's an *ideal*. The reality is that even on an RP server, the *average* roleplayer won't engage in full time RP. Not in dungeons or raids, and certainly not in busy hotspots like the Great Seal on retail.
---
As much as I like RP, and trust me when I say that LARP probably takes too much of my time in general, there's a "time and place" even for roleplay. Even roleplayers like me have alts we don't RP and who run around between AH and bank.
---
I can't ever remember a time when locations like those were RP-able to begin with.
---
It's this kind of "forcibly trying to RP in the one location where RP shouldn't be done", and then complaining when someone suggests there are a thousand other quiet locations to RP that's a tad annoying. Even to RPers like me. 
---
You have three capitol cities to RP in, so do you really need/want to RP in that one location where everyone is always OOC and spamming?
---
I mean, if you're peeling mobs off the healer the run has already gone sideways.
---
Wow rewards variety though.  In a 10 man raid, 1 Druid + 1 Priest &gt; 2 Priests.  It doesn't really matter which individually is better.
---
I actually still think that a Druid healer with full Raidbuild (i.e., not full resto, but ultra cheap HT and properly downcasting) is a better healer than a full Holy Priest when you consider they bring innervate to the table to re-up the Holy Priest.
---
The Joker is about to premiere, just saying.
---
Honestly yeah I kinda could, have you ever done it? It's goddamn exhilarating, you're on edge from start to finish every pull. Watching the mobs health slowly tick down and finally watching them all drop, then a minute of downtime for loot and regen, and off to find another massive pull, it can be a lot of fun
---
Very, as long as you have a few pieces of Crit gear or high Agi.
---
I'm a level 57 combat swords rogue still rocking Sword of Omen in my OH, Thrash Blade MH. Feeling like I'm way past the appropriate window to be using Omen, but haven't gotten a better upgrade yet. After 20 or so runs I'm tired of farming Angerforge just for his sword drop, but I don't think the next solid upgrade is until I can farm Rend or get Mirahs. Should I drop the gold for Assassination Blade (40g on my server) or just stick it out with Omen?
---
Yeah they do take this very seriously. I once joked about killing myself after a wipe. Few hours later i get the Norwegian suicide hotline on the phone cause they got a tips from Blizzard.
---
I've played more games than a anybody I know and yeah WoW is by far, **by far**, the most toxic community. Hands down, by far, the most toxic.
---
New server - 104g. Highest level is 34 hunter. 
---
I'm part of the "second wave" of levelers (which includes peoples alts) since I rerolled servers recently. I've been tracking what I've been doing and how much gold I have each play session. Here's a rundown with some numbers:
---
From 6-15 I proritized farming over questing, only completing quests when my farming had me wander into the quest area. I farmed a lot of low level mats and sold them for a surprising amount relative to how easy they are to farm. Selling this I had 3g at level 9 and 12g at level 13. At that point I paid for my guild to have a tabard designed and bought myself a tabard. (I'm not comfortable sharing what this is for fear of competition)
---
I picked up herb/skin and fishing and spent a lot of time 15-25 going up and down the coast fishing oily blackmouth and herbing stranglekelp. I kept the oily blackmouth and sold a lot of the stranglekelp. Stranglekelp is approx 4s/ea (+/- 50c), so a stack is 80s. This was about equal to the prior farm. I had 27g at level 23.
---
I also prioritized leveling an alchemy alt to craft Free Action Potions and Strong Trolls Blood elixirs. I used the oily blackmouth and stranglekelp to make the FAPs (approx 10-15s worth of mats) and sell them at 25-50s/ea. Trolls bloods are usually around 8s for mats and are consistently 20-30s ea. Almost all other herbs I collect when actively playing are sold outright. I had 85g at level 30 and proceeded to buy my final stable slot (5g).
---
Since then I've diversified a little bit. I have a lowbie enchanter that's got a presence in the wand market. It's not much money per day since I only check my listings twice a day (when I log in for the day and when I log off). 
---
I have a legion of alts in the teens. Most have a gathering and production profession and I'm skipping skinning unless I'm dual gathering. Herbs are sent to my alch alt and ores are sold (either as ores or bars, depending on which is more profitable). Mining makes the most consistent money but herbalism makes the big bucks (at low levels). Copper Bars blow away anything but briarthorn, stranglekelp, and swiftthistle in the 1-20 market. I'm continuing to do the lowbie mat grind I started with but only doing them on alts until they're around level 12.
---
I have sold very little of my leather (to a vendor or the AH). Almost all of my extra cloth goes to a tailoring alt, including bolts from fishing boxes.
---
This happened years ago. Things are still a struggle, but certainly a lot better than that point in my life.
---
It's been a long time since I've laughed that much.
---
Details clears data after bosses by default. You have to go into settings and tell it to not clear the data after bosses if you want to see the total for the entire raid.
---
That’s probably it. Thanks
---
That's rough. One in a million.
---
I just tested it. The stopcasting macro command doesn't stop it. At least not for me. 
---
Once I even had it continue trying to fire while I was casting mind blast. 
---
It's hard to believe that this wasn't reported in the beta. Or maybe it was and it just hasn't been fixed yet. No idea.
---
You're not taking into account the gold made from the actual fish being turned into raid food
---
This is kind of a dumb question but... I am a combat swords rogue. I was using a knightly longsword for offhand for the last few levels but I recently got a dagger that is faster and has better dps (6.5dps more). Do I switch to it or do I have more benefits using the sword? I am a human rogue.
---
No, I checked the WoWWiki list of Dwarf characters, found a name similar to this and changed a couple of letters.
---
I had all three on an alt. Herbs sold for more to the vendor than the AH. Some skins are in that same boat, but later in game there are some skins that sell really well (like Devilsaur Leather).  And there will bee a lot more Devilsaurs than herb nodes. You might even find yourself running around behind a guy who doesn't have skinning.
---
I dumped herbs and went mining instead. Even Copper Ore sells really well. Heck, the Rough Stone sold fast and for more than the vendor. Two professions use ore, so always demand for it.
---
Why delete his account though?
---
I've seen some things.
---
The Fate of the Kingdom, or The Royal Rescue (Horde version)
---
Yep. I’m at 4.5 days /played and I took a couple days off work to play. I have kept the important aspects of my life going and have remained social on the weekends. And pretty much every weekday evening hour of spare time I have, I’m playing WoW. To think that other people have more than double my /played time and think of themselves as “casual” is literally insane
---
It's 'could have', never 'could of'.
---
Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
---
No it can not drop from a level 5. Where do people come up with this nonsense.
---
average person or average gamer person
---
cuz most "average gamer person" i know goes to work then if they cant play while at work they do research/etc and when they go back home they play until they go to sleep and then weekends go ham 
---
but i guess thats just my circle of people  who are like that
---
no, i got my addons from https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/ and i install them manually , but the source shouldn't matter
---
Why brag about being a beta male? Its one thing you are letting the dude pound your mrs, now you let him buy you a mount so he owns your ass too.
---
Yeah it’s usually just used for damage, rarely interrupts in my group experience.
---
If you have a concern about wellbeing you can open a ticket and explain all this to a GM.  They have his billing information and can reach out to local law enforcement to do a wellness check.
---
I know a lot of people with tons of /played time simply from signing in from work and keeping their character logged in so they wouldn't have to wait in the queue during the first month.
---
Grats! What was you $ grind method?
---
Is that a warrior solo farming for Crusader pattern? 
---
He chose...poorly
---
They’ve been using it for damage not interrupts AFAIK. Probably due to storm strike
---
The 50% attack speed bonus on MCP is 1 time use?
---
Not gunna lie, I’ve thought about doing the same.  Hard to tell people that want you to stay around that you need to quit.  I really hope he is ok.
---
Go look at logs from any top guild and tell me if they are using gift of arthas.
---
It takes up a debuff slot and provides negligible damage in return. You claim it gives “several hundred dps”...do you realize that in order for that to be true, &gt;42 physical attacks would have to land PER SECOND. Consider that raids are usually only running ~15-20 physical damage dealers, and that’s me being generous to you. That would require each of those players to land *more than 2 attacks per second.* That’s *three times the GCD*. 
---
I’m sorry dude. You’re wrong. There’s no way around it.
---
No breaks allowed!
---
I have no idea, just say it’s fucked and move on with your life.
---
AH flipping
---
&gt;Ah yes, my 2000g worth of devilsaur.
---
Yeah, we alresdy lost Gnomeregan cause of this. It was supposed to be  linked to IF by an elevator. But giving the alliance 4 cities while the Horde had 3 would be unbalanced.
---
One of the reasons I've played a vanilla mage for 4 years now. Killing a giant group of mobs at once, all by myself, is fuckin fun!!
---
It's not as bad as you might think. 6/8 shadowcraft with 2/2 devilsaur is preraid bis for daggers (and possibly swords). 305 weaponskill gives you 3% hit, with 5% talented you only need 1% on gear. The procrate is insane in classic too. I was world #8 rogue on lucifron in mc with 6/8 shadowcraft like 2 weeks ago.
---
Thoughts on Mage, as someone who started with one, I never realized just how much convenience the class really was giving me. Teleports and being able to make your own water make major pain points of vanilla a nonissue. As far as gameplay goes, it depends on what you mean by one-dimensional. You either go Frost (AoE), Frost (Shatter), or Fire. I didn't touch Fire once, but for AoEing youre rounding up mobs and trying to keep them controlled. Guides can give you "rotations" but there can be fun in figuring out the depth of how efficient you can get by knowing why you do things at certain times. Shatter is what I mostly leveled with, as it was much more crowded at each spot and AoEing wasn't really a possibility. This is mostly using 3 buttons in single target scenarios, usually after snagging a mob with fire blast if it's busy. Cast frost nova when the mob is close, and save fire blasts not used for tagging for when the mob is frozen. 
---
The main thing is you're going to be facing downtime. For AoE, after every pull, you're drinking your full mana bar. For Shatter, I found I usually got 2-3 pulls before needing to drink a full mana bar. AoE is pulling as many as they can, which can be a minigame in and of itself figuring out at each spot. Shatter is pulling 1 at a time and killing them quickly. 
---
Playing a Mage can feel like playing a Druid in that you have so many tools for any situation, especially once you're past 40ish. Ice Barrier and Ice Armor give you pretty damn good tankiness for your armor type, Blink can be used offensive or defensive mobility, Evo gives you a free mana bar every 8 minutes (Which is really nice because while you can conjure your own water, you're either spending a long time making a stack or drinking that full 30 seconds), and Ice Block is an excellent oh shit button. Then you have Cold Snap, which gives you Ice Barrier, Cone of Cold, Frost Nova, and Ice Block AGAIN. The only times I ever died leveling my mage were from ganks, or when I wasn't paying enough attention. Not once did I die to a normal situation because I was out of tools.
---
Just as a quick point about people shitting all over the concept of innocence:
---
Remember the guy who posted pictures of his passport stamps to prove he was in eastern Europe at the time, and people still took a crap on him and said that he is probably guilty/lying/trying to get sympathy and should sit out the ban since the case was reviewed and that was evidence?
---
That guy was unbanned aswell. So there's that to the people who posted "coming back in two days for the guilty smackdown".
---
Guys, systems can fail and produce false positives. It happens.
---
Ok, I thought you said yall were close.  Maybe just wow buddy's.
---
I see your problem for RFD.
---
You had shit-tier DPS.
---
If you're whiffing a lot of attacks, it's going to be very very difficult to gain rage and therefore threat.
---
What I'd advise is to find a healer, then carefully select the DPS, asking questions like 'How do you do crowd control', and 'We're planning a slow and methodical run, what's your view on that ?'. Select DPS not thru LFG but thru asking in guild(s) first, then finding individual players of the right level (ie 1-2 below the tank).
---
It has been easier but yeah, I always get a party within 30 mins.
---
You sound fun.
---
Bugs get categorized into priorities, things like this would definitely be categorized into a high priority, and bugs get fixed in whatever amount of time it takes. Some bugs don't get fixed ever, some get fixed within HOURS, depends on a lot of factors
---
Its just idiots who think everything that makes them feel inadequate or bad at the game is cheating.
---
Holy fuck, I had no idea the neutral AH had a 30% cut.
---
They pretty much just do the opposite of what we do.  So 300.000 = three hundred thousand
---
Or 300.000,99 would be 3 hundred thousand and 99 cents.  They also just sometimes use space instead so 300 000,99
---
I'm just assuming all fishing spots are being taken advantage of here. Not simply wreckages and nothing else. That would be a waste of time imo
---
I hope you find your friend :’( 
---
Best of luck to you and your search for Tenths.

Pumping more money into the economy without a money sink always lead to inflation

Stonks ✓^

&gt;The problem I perceive is that there aren't enough players out there for whom this combo is the secret sauce to keep a big AAA MMO afloat
---
I don't really agree with that -- there has been an explosion of "chaotically hard and punishing games" in the 2010-2020 indie game explosion. Lots of people are enjoying these games that are basically forced encounters with failure, and this is across multiple genres. Not to mention Souls-like games. 
---
I think a lot of players report feedback like "I want the game to be more difficult", but what they really mean is "I want to feel like my brainpower is required. I want to feel like me, my own skills and intellect as a gamer, is necessary and utilized."
---
This doesn't necessarily mean tuning retail to match classic pacing and difficulty. But it does mean adding content throughout the game (and not just the end of the game) that actually makes players feel like their unique skills and learnings as a gamer are being used. Like them applying their mind and making decisions and reactions in the right way is necessary. 
---
I think Blizzard acknowledges that players do need this, which is why they make really hard content too. My problem is, they just make everything with challenge as "end game content" and new players / returning players will not see a challenge until after a few days /played.
---
Don't worry, I'm not following that logic either
---
It's not a bot and it's not automating keystrokes. There's a big difference between automation and passthroughs.
---
Multiboxing software works by running a standalone piece of software that selectively passes arbitrary keys to pre-defined windows. Typically the way this works is you do not pass the movement keys to any of the slave windows, only to the master character. You play the master character directly, and make macros on all of the slave characters. All of the slaves have macros that basically incorporate /follow and /assist commands. Then you bind these to keys that you may not be using on the master character. You end up with basically this:
---
- You drive your main character, all the slaves are following
---
- You do whatever attacks you want, and you have a button which is passed through to the slave characters for an attack like fireball or whatever that is bound to /assist the main character
---
There's no botting or automation. Just selectively passing certain keys to different windows. It's effectively the same as having 5 different keyboards in a row with each other. One key press still activates a single command in each client.
---
It's obnoxious when these people choose to gank you. But not botting and not against the terms of service.
---
I've never seen one of those in Un'goro. What are they? Are they skinnable?
---
Dwarf priests are so common for this reason, I can imagine a world where other priests are actually more in demand

Passive speed increases do not stack.
---
Honestly, I am not sure. But i  am pretty sure that it has been recognized as a bug. It may also be true that they are able to target you again as soon as you feign
---
I always tip the rogue 50% of the lockbox's loot.
---
Suicidal people tend to do the extreme. Part of it, from what little education I have in the matter, is there way of “I’ve done this, there’s no coming back anymore.” So in a way it helps solidify their mentality.
---
In addition to your edit. Warriors have the biggest health regen per point of spirit compared to any other class (I believe in an effort to make up for not having mana regen). The math is a little more complicated in the comparison of how valuable spirit is between classes.
---
Yeah, that's fair enough but not very mana efficient. I have a lot of trouble keeping mana up while also using 3 totems (windfury, strength, mana spring) and find that my DPS is great even without stormstrike / earthshock combo. Granted, I'm level 44 and have very little intel and spirit so maybe that's my problem.
---
Also, do not be afraid to use the big hammer, which is to private message the healer and ask if you want to reform the group with different DPS.
---
Bad DPS don't deserve to waste your time.
---
I've had to do it in Eve Online, for obvious reasons. I've had to do it to a whole friend ground and move back home once. And I've done it at about every party I've ever been to lol.

At this point in the game, you are correct, but once he's able to get some tier 2/tier 2.5 and a good 2 hander, he will literally be able to 1 shot people with reckoning spec, or kill people in 1 HoJ with 2 auto crits/soc crit/judgement crit combo.
---
This being said, he likely won't get a chance at any of that gear unless he is raiding as holy.  If you want to be a godly ret paladin, you have to put the time in as holy first...
---
Was there one thing in particular that made you say "Ok,  I'm done here." or did you just move on in life?
---
Can you provide a link? This would be useful to other research I’m working on.
---
I try to pull back into totems when I can. I know that stuff kills your mana, sorry shaman friends but I appreciate the windfury
---
Make sure you don't pull with a healer's HoT still active on you. It will give the healer mad aggro. Right click it away if you have to
---
Sure is fun when you get a proper group together and camp them though
---
BGs are p3, but there are honor quartermasters in the cities that sell tabards, trinkets, and other pvp stuff based on your rank. I think a pvp trinket costs 2g or so.

OP was flaired as a Priest, didn't think he would want to double up.
---
I did it in PoE. Shit got way too addicting. It was like having a second job.

I’m trying to get into WoW on the urge of some friends but have barely played because of the fear of it Happening again. Something about my personality doesn’t click with games like this where there is an economy.

I don’t think you can delete a character if you have sent mail to someone and they haven’t opened it yet.

And then there was that Casey Anthony girl.....
---
I can see that. The salty tears seem to be overflowing. Which is weird, because my post was the help the community as a whole. Again, the irony that people just come into threads to shit on people rather than listen and have any level of constructiveness to their posts, and here it happens to a post pointing out how bad it is. Yet they want to say I am the issue.
---
Oh well.
---
Oh, child.
---
&gt;So this is a rhetorical question and you expect the answer is no (although if taken literally, the answer was yes, which shocked you and noone else).
---
No it was not a rhetorical question.
---
How is **any** graph without any labels of any use to anyone at all? If you can't tell what is being plotted, it isn't communicating anything.
---
There also isn't any need for your attitude. A graph not having any labels being useless would shock nobody with any background in maths.
---
&gt; Translating the rhetorical device into meaning, you are saying you don't believe a chart is at all informative if it doesn't have axis labels. 
---
So you made an assumption that a question was rhetorical, then straw manned a meaning from it. Wonderful. Don't you look a bit silly.
---
&gt; We can agree the purpose of a chart is to convey information 
---
And without labels, how can anyone tell what information it is?
---
&gt; Putting that together, your statement is "all charts without axis labels are useless." 
---
Not what I said. I said it wasn't informative. Not that it was useless.
---
&gt; This is like communication 101. If you're going to scream in all caps and bold, at least know what you're saying. 
---
Maybe you could try reading 101. Where have I used all caps **and** bold?
---
Maybe he went outside. Just like all of you should.
---
I've confirmed this is a visual glitch for the other party, as me and my friend both noticed it when leveling. I reported the bug to Blizzard almost a month ago when we first saw it.
---
LMFAO you must be absolutely awful if you find yourself constantly dying to alli on stalagg. I was in gadgetzan an hour ago and there were about 6 alli and 50+ horde
---
Congrats! I set the same goal myself for the same reason and did similar things on my warrior! Basically ground beasts and vendored skins.. as well as AH playing on an alt and literally sending him anything I could possibly MAYBE make a profit on
---
10 boxing is still fine
---
Anything more and it gets hairy unless you have mass instant aoe (nigh impossible in Classic, maybe with Engineering bombs?)
---
Source: I had some fun multiboxing in Gurubashi Arena back in when the PTR's still gave you free char copies. In fact I built my current rig solely with multiboxing in mind. Lining all my dead Hunters into a singular row to all cast Barrage was hilarious.
---
Some other things I did was put like 9x Druids with Ysera's gift glitching under the arena then PvP with warlock on the edge of the arena, using portal to get back to safety if things got too hairy. Some mechanics like that were pretty hilarious and fun. Ysera's Gift is a pretty dumb talent (forced healing smh) but when coupled with multiboxing it can actually be pretty hilarious and powerful.

Sadly Cata and flying really ruined the Gurubashi Arena, it was never as popular after, but during WotLK it was still populer with the Arena packed full.

Yeah, it was pretty disappointing considering time invested, wouldn't recommend doing it if you need gold. I do not know what's the best item you can get so I did it for that 'jackpot' recipe or something but seems like I didn't get lucky

Devilsaur is trash. I stopped using it long time ago. Shadoecraft is the way to go and you can get enough hit from other gear.

go to his place and grind his character while he is at work or sleeping
---
They definitely can. Priests are clutch in ST. Shaman have a harder time because if everyone piles onto the tremor totem, the ghosts that spawn after you kill some of the trolls just murder everyone.
---
I'd love you as a tank lol. Even in SM where its relatively normal to "pull back" mobs, I still end up needing to plop str/wf almost every fight heh.
---
But I see it as my main utility in a group. That and interrupts.
---
How much mitigation does that much armor give you?
---
It was more like 6 hours straight every opportunity I had significant free time, which was like 4 times.
---
Healers have a great deal of agency over their resources and throughput.  I'd argue strongly that outside of warlock who is demonstrating reckless disregard for game state, it is largely a healer skill thing.
---
While you're not wrong, there is always a much deeper underlying problem when somebody gets so sucked in that it destroys their personal life. Gaming addicting is pretty much always more a symptom than anything else

Thank you so much. I was going back and forth on whether to report this to Blizzard because there were no outright mentions of self harm made - just general sadness and worry that was expressed to me. I really appreciate you looking into it - I'd rather know he is okay even if I never find out what happened. My own curiosity does not mean anything compared to his well-being.
---
Took a lock to 20, rerolled hunter to 36, rolled paladin to 16, now I'm on a priest about to hit 30. Honestly priest feels comfy to me, gonna be loads of fun when bg's hit. That will be my first 60 for sure this time *help me*
---
My girl and I rolled Shaman and Warrior. Its her first time playing WoW and she does a great job healing. This way we never got problems finding Dungeon Groups since we're a Tank/Heal Bundle.
---
It makes Questing much more chill too, since (as soon as I got Wirlwind) I could masspull the mobs and nuke them whilest she healed me.
---
Haha that's true, you gotta be in the right mindset for it
---
When it actually came out the first time back in 2005 it completely derailed my life and upended everything. I mean. It was fun. I literally still remember experiences in it like it was yesterday, people I met and achievements. But yeah, technically, I would be much better off.
---
Level 32, have done a lot of quests in hillsbrad, stonetalon, and ashenvale, and several of the quests in desolace and STV.
---
the quests that i do have in the latter two are a bit higher for me right now, should i grind a few levels and then quest there, or quest elsewhere?
---
I *nailed* the jump :D
---
I'm not going to say that no guilds will take a ret paladin to their raids, but finding ones that will take you as ret will be very difficult.  Ret damage output is atrocious in PvE.  You basically have to have BiS gear to reach a mediocre position on the damage meters.  Literally not a single guild is going to allow a prot pally to come to raids.  Paladins have no taunt in Vanilla and are therefore completely useless for tanking end game content.  Holy is definitely your best bet for getting into raids.  They are literally the best single target healers in the game and every alliance guild is going to want AT LEAST 4 Holy Paladins in the raid.
---
Yup, because GM's are slipped kick backs to not ban multiboxers, got to protect that bottom line.
---
Are druids underplayed on a lot of servers? I am considering playing a Druid on a different server since my friends all quit and I want to change factions. I noticed during my Classic experience so far that out of the classes I enjoy, Druid seems to be one of the least played classes. I personally like Balance Druid even though I know it is a meme spec but I would also play Resto because I have always been a healer and it is something I do enjoy. Just curious what those druid enthusiasts think about their class population.
---
If molten core can be cleared sub 60 in greens then anything should work. Will you be able to get into a min max guild as a ret paladin? No. But anything else is on the table.
---
It's only going to get worse now with all the bullshit 'e-sports' stuff happening even in PvE content.
---
Thanks I'll take that into consideration
---
Also turtles in shimmering flats
---
"Oh you'll get your booty"
---
Thanks! I did not know that. I set my chats up the same way every time, so I'm just used to the aforementioned routine. That's a great tip though!
---
I'm looking to do pretty much the same build all the way to 60. If I need shock I might go to a 34/17/0 build to retain some tankability and AOE farming.
---
I dont want to sound rude but.. why the heck do people put a banner with their name in the middle top of their stream? I dont get it. Its the same with all the "TV" , "Gaming" etc. channels.. Can you answer me that? :D
---
Judging by his username he's Dutch. Our police are actually amazing and are there to serve the people 99% of the time.
---
And another big reason we can now (besides better understanding of the mechanics) is that we're on the easiest pre-TBC patch. 1.12 nerfed all content which now more readily allows non-tanking tanks.
---
In my own defense (I'm a lock), I am always paying attention to my healers and do everything in my power to help ease the load on them. I will wand and use spells that help conserve Mana, if I grab aggro I run to the tank and allow him to regain threat before attacking again, I use my wand, I would NEVER use searing pain in a dungeon, and I keep my minion on a tight leash. I also SS my healers and keep it fresh. Drink water if I have to too. So don't think all locks are bad, there are good ones of us out there, may just be very far and few between.
---
I clapped my hands and laughed when the tin whistle came into the mix.  Well played, good sir.
---
nah only things i click are the extra bars for minor things..
---
my main actionbar is all keyboard unless im lazy af and wanna just click away
---
it helps i dont aoe grind
---
Any number of things. Sometimes I want to type but I'm playing one handed since I'm petting my cat and I have a mouse with tons of buttons for my keybindings (logitech g600)
---
Indeed this shit is on rattlegore
---
Lifetapping during a fight is good. It means max dps. That's how their kit works. Lifetapping AFTER  an encounter? Rude just fucking drink
---
I'd err on the side of "passing in favour of waiting for your actual BiS" then, but please do discuss this directly with whomever handles loot, or your GM (whichever applies more). The Aurastone Hammer may be better, but it could take _months_ to drop, whereas a Sorcerer's Dagger could drop tommorow and you could use it for those months. If you're allowed to roll on it, it's still better for you until you get the next upgrade. Especially playing an "off-meta" spec.
---
a couple of priests/warriors with lesser invis potion getting off a fearbomb? A bunch of mages AoEing that fat blob for quick honor?
---
I main warlock. I wont lifetap below 50% health unless I absolutely have to. I'll drink in between battles or any pauses instead of spamming LT. Some people are assholes, and some people just cant let things go. Dont group with him again.
---
With tricks of the trade and misdirect WotLK raids could go balls out within a global or two of the pull.
---
Yeah I mostly use fire blast since higher dmg and less mana
---
&gt; Ugly retail behavior brought to Classic, assuming some non-existent dungeon finder will fix their abandonment.
---
Yeah, I played a few retail dungeons before classic came out to check out changes.  First one in after 30m wait tank logs out halfway through(we were basically clearing as fast as we were running in to things and had no deaths, so clear speed shouldn't have been an issue).  Ended up tanking rest of content(including 2-3 bosses) with a voidwalker because retail is that faceroll.  
---
Decided to do the rest of the dungeons on my tank for quick queues.
---
Those things honestly do hurt, definitely did this exact thing last night lol
---
&gt; Most of us have been playing online for a long time and if your experiences are anything like mine you've seen plenty of people log off and never return
---
I had a gaming buddy who disappeared for a good while then came back one day.  Turns out he had cancer but had beaten it.   Then he disappeared again for awhile.  The next time I saw him pop on I said something like "Hey! Thought you died, good to see you man." or something along those lines.    
---
It was his wife logging onto his accounts to let his friends know the cancer had come back and he had passed away.
---
That's wild. You basically won the lottery in getting your account stolen. Kind of a weird outcome.
---
Same thing probably happened. He quit!
---
This isn't really exclusive to WoW, there's a lot of people who like to demean people as being unhealthy because it makes them feel better about their own shortcomings. Not saying you are but I see it a lot when people talk about games and WoW.
---
How in Classic are you punished for not logging in daily? If you're levelling to 60 there's zero rush. At 60 there's zero rush either, there's no mandatory weeklies/dailies/dungeon farming each day that you're going to be left behind for not doing, claiming there is is a myth by people who've spent little to no time at max level.
---
The argument about taking a break is stupid as well. Why can't you take a break from WoW after 15 minutes? If your going to say you can't in a dungeon, well how many activities outside WoW can you just randomly get up and take a break from? If I was playing a sport can I just remove myself from the field because I need a break, letting down my ream? No. This is an argument not at all exclusive to WoW designed to demean it as "insane".
---
Darnassus is also supposedly, much larger in the lore.
---
Probably spending his time in a more productive fashion, or at least hopefully.  Good for him
---
I only get the whiskers once every 6 mobs at best
---
Sounds like you should try Elite Dangerous, where the economy is made up and the currency doesn't matter.
---
What a multiboxer does do in PvE is it makes the people who are "enjoying the journey" run into a wall.  
---
Trying to quest in an area, but if there is a multiboxer there, odds are you aren't going to be able to do much. One multiboxer with 5 characters will keep an area dead than 5 individual characters will.
---
Also, a multiboxer will drive up prices on stuff on a server, which from the multiboxers perspective is fine, but for everyone else it just increases grind time because they can't get stuff themselves because you can't compete, and the prices are higher because the multiboxer will control the supply. Increased grind time is what droves a lot of people away from end game vanilla.
---
And your "It’s not like I can steal your herbs four/five times." comment is crap. While most people are clearing to a herb, you don't have that problem. Especially as multiboxers seem to treat other players are friendly npcs and ignore they are there. Someone is fighting on a herb, they will just run up and take it. I have also never seen a multiboxer communicate with someone out in the wild, help someone with a quest, or any of the many other things that people have celebrated classic for being amazing about.
---
They remove themselves from the community.
---
So they do hurt PvE, unless you are a multiboxer.
---
Ok so I’m just getting into wow and I’ve only ever played on private servers about 10 years ago. I want to jump into classic but I don’t have an account/subscription. I had a cousin download it onto my laptop since I slow internet with caps. So he downloaded classic for me, but when I try to run the game it takes me to battle.net app. I figured it’s because you need an active sub to play it. I want to sub and it looks like I can buy it straight from the blizzard app. My question is, if I buy the sub and start running classic will it let me log in? Or will it force me to download retail?
---
I keep CoA, Corr, Siphon Life up the whole time.  Doom is good on rotgrip since he takes a minute to get to you but it's actually lower dps than CoA over 1 min. When I was using doom it would take about 2.5 mins to kill her and with CoA (1 amp) it takes almost exactly 2 mins.
---
Yeah I've run into a set of 5 shaman and been blasted with 5 near-simultaneous shots of lightning. Pretty much insta-gib.
---
But the thing to remember is these multi-box setups involve a master/slave configuration. There is a guy driving all 5 characters, but he's only directly driving one of them. The others are running behind him with /follow, and attacking through key passthroughs using /assist &lt;main character&gt; /cast &lt;name of spell&gt; macros called in from a specific key on the guy's keyboard.
---
The keyboard passthrough is going to be configured to pass movement keys to a specific window. If you kill that character then it's going to take the guy a significant amount of time to reconfigure his passthrough software, macros, key setup, etc to directly control one of the slaves.
---
The multi-boxer has a lot of single-target firepower but is still just a single person and will get overwhelmed easily. Since the slave characters are set to /follow, the master character will be the one at the front of the pack. Cut off it's head and the rest will be more or less crippled without anything to follow or assist.
---
This got me in the feels. Here's to more adventures once things are settled.
---
Man, this is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen on the internet. Good guy blizzard.
---
Why can't it be thought of as a keyboard with a 5 way splitter. Each split wire goes to a separate computer, and one keystroke gets split and sent to each computer. You individually sent commands to each of those characters
---
he ded
---
Leave the poor guy alone, OP has no right to investigate this persons life. Everyone has a right to quit the game and never talk to our ingame friends ever again. I don't want police showing up at my place just because I deleted my character, lets be real here.
---
Had something similar happen back in SoO. We weren't this close (never talked about IRL stuff) so I actually have no idea what happened to the guy. All I know is he was a cool guildie.
---
Had a tank in SoO that was feeling sick. We were in voice chat for raid and he was coughing all the time and sounded like he was dying. We told him he shouldn't feel obligate to raid if he was feeling bad, we'd have to PUG half the raid anyways, one more person wouldn't matter. Dude insisted on raiding anyways so we dropped it. As we were raiding he was talking about how he puked multiple times that day and if he went AFK that was probably what happened. At this point we were realizing shit was way worse then he was letting on, so we told him to go rest and we'd find a tank no problem. He insisted on staying again.
---
So we were doing Fallen Protectors and close to the end of the fight he starts taking a ton of damage. Someone said something in voice chat about it and he didn't answer. Boss dies and his character is just standing there, weapons still in hand, completely AFK. We thought he had to puke again and agreed to straight up kick him from raid and tell him to go rest when he came back. We make our way to the next boss, clearing trash. Half the way there, tank still isn't back. We get to the boss. Tank still isn't back. After a few minutes, we find a replacement and get him to where we are, ready to pull. The guy still isn't back. At this point we're very worried, he's either puking his guts out or worse.
---
Raid goes on, we close up the night with him having DCed at some point and still not back. Next day he doesn't log in. The day after that, it's raid night again and he doesn't show up, which isn't normal for him at all. Now we're extremely worried about him. I remember anxiously checking the guild roster multiple times a day to see if he was on even though I didn't even know the dude's name. A week goes on and he's still not back. At this point the jokes of "lol he died" are not jokes anymore and are an actual possibility. Eventually I gave up on checking all the time. Couple weeks later I remember about the whole thing and check again. Still nothing. A month later, still nothing. The guild kinda fell apart, a raid tier went by, an expansion went by and he hadn't logged in again. Checked in on his armory page at some point in WoD and he was still with MoP gear, same level, never came on since then. Just checked again and now his character isn't even there anymore. Probably got his name claimed after being inactive for too long.
---
No happy ending on this one, that's the end of it. So Siff if you're out there, I hope you're doing well (and alive).
---
Better question is: How can your character be so bad at fighting, he gets parried by a blob?
---
money isnt necessary but bags would be a great help without breaking the experience
---
Thats a lot. Thanks for the formula :)

Get this twitch shit out of here. Real vanilla wow only had youtube

I hate that you have the main bar on your screen but dont use it... Just get a bar addon Christ -__-
---
It's a limitation of the game because they simply can't make everything to scale, it just couldn't fit. Goldshire is supposed to be a small town and not just two buildings as well.
---
Sounds like you should play Elite Dangerous, where the economy is made up and your career doesn't matter.
---
Drain tanking is what I'm planning.  There are tons of good guides out there.  I like how this one breaks down the spec and different spells.  It gives lots of data points for you to make the comparison and expand upon their work for your own playstyle.
---
I am not doing exactly the same as their build but that's more because I am wanting to play with curse of exhaustion a bit.
---
Most priest guides are a bit misleading.  Going shadow isn't that much stronger than discipline, especially as you are using a wand for a good chunk of your damage.  The two mandatory talents in my mind are wand specialization and spirit tap.  After that, disc is able to provide more utility for your limited mana pool while shadow just buffs a few of your spells in rotation.  At 40, going shadowform is the highest dps spec by far.  And your wand starts to fall off around 35.  So shadow is definitely the faster build.  But as disc, single pulling, I never have to stop to drink, eat, or even bandage.  I can only make wool bandages, because all my cloth is used for tailoring and I don't even notice while grinding.
---
You don’t use leader of the pack? Seems like big feral talent? I’m still learning Druid.
---
At first I was like no WoW
---
But then I was like now ow :(
---
Was this recently? Like did you receive a 30 day ban during classic?
---
Honestly in that type of situation I don't know how you could prove it was you, without you actually having a GM work with you to prove you have access to all the IP's that they've shown you in your logs. Using more than one IP seems like a witch hutch for them to claim a ban is valid on.
---
That tin whistle is epic. Well done!
---
I don't know if that's good either, but I think I'll give it a go. I started a priest with the intention of dungeoning to 60 - but even on a full server I'm having trouble finding groups because I'm so far behind the pace being a casual player. 
---
I'd love to find out some sort of indication of how long each level should take
---
Auction house
---
Several = more than 2. Bare minimum 300. 300/7=42.85. It’s really not rocket science. 
---
Crits and % damage increases factor ZERO into gift of arthas. It’s a flat damage taken increase applied after all of that sort of stuff. 
---
A rogue has maybe 0.5 hits/sec, and if we add one instant attack per GCD (more than is actually sustainable, but I’ll allow it just to illustrate how brittle are the straws you’re grasping), that’s 1.133 hits/second. A warrior hits even less. 
---
Again, go take a gander at logs for top guilds. You’re wrong.
---
Some countries have sane policies on this sort of thing. For example a woman reporting a rape won't be charged for weed use if discovered during the rape investigation. Not all crimes are equal, and some "criminals" are more important to get off the streets than others. When you do shit like this as police you discourage people from reporting serious crimes.

There were a few.  The culture there was something that I couldn't wrap my head around.  I had always considered myself something of a gamer nerd.  I've played D&amp;D, and other rpg's, and video games my entire life.  I had never played WoW before becoming a GM (first mistake).  When I got there I was shocked to see the 400 pound Mountain Dew slurping GMs there.  We had soda machines that were on free that we just went up and pushed the button for another can.  I'd drink like 4 Mountain Dews a day tbh, before I realized what I was doing.
---
In the end I wasn't a match for the culture there.  I realized that I wasn't nearly as much of a "gamer" as I thought, I was going through a change where I wasn't as much of a hyper liberal anymore so it was harder to get along with all the hyper liberal people working there and I just got worn down from being Blizzard's meat shield for whenever they fucked something up.  You might, or might not, be surprised at how people would talk to GMs, like it was our fault that your addons made WotLK unplayable at parts.

That however didn’t account for roots, blinks, slows, fears etc...
---
The only thing they are going to raid is your wallet.
---
I feel a similar yet opposite way. I love responsibility. When I play, although my main is a mage (and has been since actual vanilla because of the aesthetic, not a bandwagoner :( ), I constantly feel the draw to tanking and MT/raid leading again. It feels good to be needed.
---
He got tired of playing with a shadow priest with no key binds
---
thatll teach you to text and ride lol
---
Downranking in leveling dungeons is very important even without +healing gear. Because it isn't about sustain healing or even HPM, it's about not overhealing, because overhealing is wasted mana. And wasted mana is more downtime and less "oh shit" buffer. And if I'm firing up a max rank healing touch, that means shit is hitting the fan.
---
Had a guy in guild complain about there not being a LFG tool....
---
Hm.. That doesn't work either all that does it causes me to dismount and gives the you must be in car form error then if I click it again while I'm dismounted I start mounting up again
---
Lol no. But a geared shadow priest attacked me and a warrior today. We are both 60. I was unloading on him and draining his mana. He still wiped the floor with us. It’s pretty well known that shadow priest and extremely powerful in pvp during vanilla.
---
When I quit ragnarok online I gave all my gold to people on the street so I would never come back.
---
Thank you for sharing your story. My thoughts go out to you and Siff. I hope wherever he is that he is doing okay.

Whoah, thanks friend - I hope it lives up to the expectation!

You're playing the strongest 1v1 class in the game.

And if you can only make 2-8 at a time, just give em a lower tier you can pump out in 20 each

Ugh my problem right here. I'm fine if I'm doing small shit like mats or ah, but once I get started on bgs it's over, I'm lost to the world for as long as I can possibly be.
---
I\`ve read about a guy who was multiboxing in Eve Online using several PCs and a mechanical device that bacically allowed him to press buttons on several keyboards at once. The fact that it was a mechanical device allowed him to stay within ToS.

I've told myself that I'm quitting heavy time-sink games like WOW for good when I'm moving abroad in December. Sure I'm enjoying myself, but I know I'm not getting out of my live what I can get out of it playing this game so often. I'm never quitting games altogether, like I got to play The Last of Us part 2 in February, but games with no clear end like WOW, man they can be the worst.
---
Just from what I’ve seen, gold-wise Priest is totally capable of doing Princess farming now and at least in PS they could do Lashers in DM so we’ll have to watch that space.
---
Nice!
---
Yes! Blizzard does have his RL information. If he was acting out of character and OP is worried for his safety, asking Blizzard to contact the authorities for a welfare check is a good thing for everyone involved.
---
Can someone tell me something? What if I simply feel like giving a lot of gold to my IRL friend for nothing? Like what rule is it breaking to give a lot of gold to random people for no reason?
---
Classy response. You actually looking out for your player base
---
Good job. Fuck they whiney ass bitch tho
---
Okay. I’ll upvote your comment
---
It’s not about that ,but posting a pvp video of 3v1 and than going on a mage ,you’re sure a great player mate. 
---
I know it’s a PvP server and such ,but get yourself other excuses
---
You got cucked
---
What ever was underpriced and usable.
---
is there a real difference between a multi boxer and a group of 5 players ganking?
---
Except most people don’t report it. I reported like 60-80 people already. I still run into many of them 3 weeks later. So now I don’t bother most of the time, especially since reporting some guy while he runs out of view distance crashes your client. If the whole server is invaded by non RPers not caring about names, and the server is sharded, most people won’t get enough reports to get forced renames anyway, and that’s exactly what’s happening. Outside of completely obscene names which lead to forced renames even on non RP realms, most people are fine despite not abiding by the server rules. And that isn’t okay.
---
It's pretty weird that some people are defending literal cheating in the wow community, in any other gaming community this would be cheating and a clear cut ban.
---
I’ve almost always been top of dps in dungeons as ele . Only thing that slows you down is mana pool.
---
Doing the lord’s work.
---
Eh, I just dot and wand unless too many mobs have been pulled or we're at a particularly nasty mob or boss - then I may burn through my mana a bit and either drink or lifetap + drink/eat.
---
I think you're only going to remember the bad times and forget the groups that went smoothly.
---
Where do you go at 30? Just dinged and not really sure. I can finish up hillsbrad (maybe 5-8 quests?) and the few quests left in shimmering flats. I usually go to desolace around 32 iirc? Kinda killing my desire to lvl cause I don't want to go to any of the areas where I have like 3 green quests left such as stonetalon or ashenvale
---
I like your swift judgement, you must be an amazing player. Like I said I had one second and hesitated because it was the lock. Also, fuck right off

You're assuming he called them, then judging him on that assumption....

How many hours per day based on his level do you think he played since launch? One can get surprised how much theyve actually played

What bar and unit Frame UI Addons are you running? Love it, looks super clean.

Haven't been able to get my Domino set up like that at all

I was questing with 2 warriors a few weeks back, and one of them died. The 2 of us both used our jumper cables on him, and they both failed. Shit works so rarely it is a huge pleasamt surprise when tou actually rez someone with them.
---
Quote fail.

Lol and?

Fuck are you to say how people should spend their free time

Isnt it easier to just press print screen or use snipping tool than using the phone, take 2 pictures, edit them and then upload it to reddit? :D

Permission granted. Execute strike immediately.
---
All he said was that the police are called, and he was the victim. So then who called? I highly doubtful this instance happens out in wide public.
---
Yeah, I’m describing what the multiboxers in question are doing. They don’t have 5 sets of key binds. They have one, and a program like AutoHotkey relays those commands to their other 4 clients. That’s botting.
---
I don’t play WoW but this comment kinda bugs me. I’m not saying games are a drug, I play them all the time. But if I wanted to quit and do something else with my time, I wouldn’t want to see this post at all. It ain’t gonna be popular but man this is just like grabbing your boy from his most recent rehab stint and using peer pressure to get him to use. 
---
Granted, all of this is assuming a lot, from the OP right down to my dumb ass.
---
I’ve ran 15+ UBRS Jed/Rend runs for the trinket and I’ve lost every single time or it just didn’t drop.
---
I’ve also done around 10 or so Strat UD runs for the healing necklace off Rammstein. The first run it dropped and I lost to our Druid tank rolling on it since he was actually a healer main spec. Since then I’ve not seen it drop once. 
---
I get shit on all the time for my roll luck...
---
Just to provide the other perspective, I did this twice back in the day, once when WoW was new, and once in the BC days after coming back on a different server. Both times I was fine, I just wanted to quit cold turkey because I could tell I was playing too much and expending too much emotional energy on the game.
---
Not proud of just up and leaving my guildmates without a word, but at the time it just felt too hard to explain everything and say goodbye to people. So I told myself "it's just a game, it doesn't really matter" and pulled the plug.
---
Because jokes can get you jailed in 2019

If they would just ban companies from doing business in a country for tax evasion this shit would end real fast.
---
Appreciate the post! I not only agree, but I would go as far to say that of the false positives that do happen, my situation really emphasizes that many may never even be unbanned. It was very possible to just continue to have GM's blow off my appeals. I got lucky because I own all the accounts in question, what if I didn't? What if it was a group of friends pooling gold together for item flipping and stuff?
---
The generic emails I received were funny though, because every time a decision was made, I would get flooded by 5x of each email to the same email.
---
So, my goal is to viable hybrid spec and unfortunately LotP can't be had. 
---
I suspect at some point I'll have to fully choose tanking or healing and if so...LotP is certainly valuable. 
---
But it's not critical for the tank bc feral druids have such great threat anyway, it's just really good for the other party members if they're melee.
---
Thank you, I was hoping to find a sane adult here.
---
I have seen your kind before and you are a rare breed sir. That warlock actually used SS on the tank too lol.
---
It depends. I'm in somewhat of a similar situation. Hit my lowest about two weeks ago and keeps on getting worse. Luckily with Classic I rekindled the joy of gaming which I lost years ago. Not sure how since I'm the most solo casual scrub out there (just reached 50 today) but the game really helps me even if it's only for an hour or two a day.
---
Don’t jinx yourself bro

someone's life could be in danger and you're concerned about them playing on (I assume) the opposite faction as you? oof, sorry but that's kinda sad

I grinded out 50g for my mount along the western shore of STV. Took me like 4 hours of afk fishing while watching Netflix.
---
Some people don't feel that way, my sister was suicidal and texted my other sister she was going to kill herself, she was living far away and couldn't get a hold of me because my phone was off ( I did live with suicidal sister at the time), the only option she had was to call the police. She ended up just talking out of her ass and not trying it at all but the cops still came and took her to the hospital for a mental evaluation, she was very upset about it and didn't talk to my other sister for a long time because of it.
---
But to be fair the cops were kind of assholes about the whole thing and didn't give the vibe of "we are here to help" but more of this is a waste of our time, hurry up.
---
This is such a lie that is not even fun.

Jesus, that's fucking creepy.

I figure by the time DM comes out, Ill be mad geared, and will do it once in a while for the cashola. but right now, is riskey

random question: was tenth on dunemual as a HWL warlock?
---
Grats on pre bis. That combo will last you till aq easily and then u can replace fel with aq40 trash drop mace. Iron foe is nice but man it's kind of lame at the same time. I used that combo for a long time of a server and it was kind of a curse. We had bad luck with weapon drops so anything half decent obviously went to the people that needed them. 
---
I didn't replace my iron foe till naxx KT weapons.
---
That’s exactly what I’m describing. They are passing one command to 5 clients at a time. That’s 3rd party automation.
---
If they didn't tell you then they didn't want you to know. Just move on and be happy that you meant enough for them to wanna give you a little goodbye gift.
---
Hoping for the best
---
Also, another question if you know.
---
Is there any specific steps I can take to increase connection while tethering? It seems to be roughly the same connection vs WiFi hotspot for me
---
Exactly how it was meant to be when the game came out. IMO, new players need to be primed extensively before they hop into classic.
---
There are SO many ruthless punishments doled out to even experienced players that classic will NOT be fun for anyone unprepared.
---
I really think you're missing the bigger picture here.
---
Is this really how it works? Seems unintuitive, I thought it would make the best spell you queue crit, ie only chain lightning in that example. Does it treat multiple spells cast at once like one spell?
---
I think you might be surprised
---
Looks like you’re in the US which might be where the confusion is coming from. That type of policing is different compared to the rest of the first world
---
i will never complain about hearthstone again. 😖

ty Blizz, super cool.
---
As a mage.. nothing ATM. That'll change when PvP trinkets are about
---
So the directions from the driving account are automated into the slave accounts?
---
You people are so stupid, like sovereign citizens arguing semantics. Say whatever you want but literally it is an automated process that blizzard has decided is OK.... i mean seriously look at the words you use **autohotkey** the fucking root of the word is auto.... **automated** **robot controlled** jfc.....
---
Honestly, stepping away from the game for a bit doesn’t sound like a bad thing to me. Maybe he’s just taking some time to think about life and what he wants

Yeah I play warrior....
---
Saw this from 2007scape
---
Yeah, it was on my birthday of all days - September 20th. Turned the Dirty 30 and received a 30 day suspension. The first thing I did was open up a ticket, after that I found out how to actually request a phone call - Took some digging to find this. And the original GM I spoke with told me "I was lucky to receive a 30 day suspension and others are receiving permanent bans". I asked for it to be further reviewed and she mentioned that she will escalate it however, after it is reviewed a second time the decision will be FINAL. After around 10 minutes I received an additional e-mail basically stating that my account was not compromised (not sure what this had to do with any part of the issue) and the 30 day suspension will remain in place.
---
I left it at that - However, the following Monday I was drinking some of, one of my birthday presents, and decided to open up a live chat with an additional GM. Again no proof was given. I just received the same response - the Suspension will remain in force.
---
This is when I discovered that I could request my whole account details on their website. I ended up doing that and reviewed the logs and again, I don't know much about ISP's (other than reading previous posts stating that minor digit number increases / decreases aren't that critical) but only noticed substantial increases (40+ digit increases on the first set of numbers). And that was on Sept. 18th and 19th if I recall. I was sitting down on the couch with my significant other and wanted to use the steamapp to log in and check out how it played.
---
Hey if wow is the world you like to live in enjoy it.  The memories are real and the friendships can be just as deep or shallow as the real world.   Thoughts and prayers for your safe return.

All undead rogues should be slaughtered. It's about punishing them now for misdeeds they will do in the future.
---
Intermediate healing tip offering. When cast big cast time heals on a tank. There is a nice tactic where you cast the big slow heal... then about halfway through if the tank doesnt need it... move to cancel it, then start it up right again.
---
This way when they take a huge hit, you already have a heal partially casting that you simply let complete.
---
Dont spirit mana regen can continue while doing this, only stops when a spell goes off.
---
If other people need heals not worth it... but great if tank is taking huge hits randomly.
---
Yeah, I didn't even consider rolling on dagger when it dropped, and I talked to them some already. I'm wondering about some things that seem good for everyone like ring of spell power, totem of ephpemral power, Mana cord, ragnaros necklace...
---
Np!
---
Just shows you what your effective life pool would be, or how much damage you could take before armor reduction.
---
maybe he did it bc he knew his dad was about to delete his account? idk
---
Jesus...I can't imagine the toxicity that GMs go through. I know the gamer community can be pretty bad, going so far as to tell developers to kill themselves and what not. I imagine it's pretty taxing on anyone that does it long enough. It's too bad that they don't promote more healthy lifestyle choices considering your job is to sit at a computer all day. It's kinda crazy because most of the time GMs get pretty good publicity. I guess there's always a darker side to things.
---
I tried multi-boxing briefly on a private server before classic launched. Good lord the overhead of managing 5 characters at the same time was a pain in the ass. Tabbing to each window to accept quests, complete quests, keeping all 5 of them equipped over time, etc, is ridiculous. Yeah you had nutty single-target firepower but it was clumsy and sucked to play.
---
He met him ingame dude, they are not friends.

When I quit, during Cata, I went to say my goodbyes and it's exactly that, people will try to get you to stay because they don't see it the same way.

My guildmates and arena team basically had the same responses and it was just tiring since I was already struggling. Game was interfering with my college and social life and I knew I needed to quit cold turkey.

Sounds like work, do you have any methods to get rich that don’t require thinking?

Multiboxing scum

You didn't even read what he said did you. Christ. People like you are the worst.

That's assuming the commenter knows even how to use weakauras. OmniCC is probably what he's looking for

Locks see the heals mana pool as an extension of their own.  Don't heal them and they will figure it out.   :)
---
&gt; Several = more than 2. Bare minimum 300. 300/7=42.85. It’s really not rocket science.
---
It really isn't and 300/8 is 37.5, sorry I rounded.
---
Also, again you're ignoring crits and % damage increases.
---
I love being a healer but I also now hate everyone
---
Added a comment.
---
there were hundreds of addons back then for everything. fucking autolooting was originally an addon. by the end of vanilla, blizzard had incorporated about 65 addons into the base game as "features"
---
We fuck this asshole. You’re exactly the kind of person I let die in dungeons. Maybe after all of your gear is broken you will wait for party members to get full mana.
---
Well I mean the intention would be that if I was casting a heal on the priest, I wouldn’t be performing any actions on my warrior as I would be controlling the priest on my second monitor. 
---
It doesn’t sound ideal but I’m also not interested in setting up a multibox environment with synchronized key presses across the two games.
---
This was my first thought as well. Plus, Elite is kind of self-limiting. By the time you get a decent pile of money you realize that there really isn't much to do that doesn't center around getting money, so you leave the game.
---
Except the skybox can be clear as day
---
What spec was he?  As mentioned
---
Game valuables are not the same as real world valuables even as highly as many of us value them. Worth checking on, but I wouldn't say the level of general concern should be the same. This action isn't uncommon when someone decides they're done with a game.

Maybe he played 15 years ago and simply got his nostalgia fix.

🦀🦀Blizzard actually cares about its player base 🦀🦀
---
If your pet is still attacking or you have dots up, you'll stay in combat.
---
Contact someone who can check up on them. Giving away possessions, even things like WoW gold and deleting their account could be a sign that they’ve accepted that they are going to kill themselves. It’s not necessarily that bad, but still, it’s important. You can never over react when someone’s life could be in the balance.
---
Multiboxing is explicitly allowed by Blizzard. It's not botting, it involves passing keys that you press on your keyboard being sent to specific windows on your computer.
---
Most of the original blueposts have been lost due to blizzard changing their forums, but Icy Veins has most of them archived here:

While I agree there is ton of stuff that makes sense to buy early, the pattern will only drop in price and it's basically a guarenteed drop (and most groups will give you priority on it if you prove you have tailoring), while you farm for the pants and especially gloves from LBRS anyway.

How do you stop an outside software company from selling to US individuals if they are completely outside of US?  We have no jurisdiction to go after said company to stop them from selling the product online for US residents. Do you go after consumers from buying the product at that point?

I agree with you on Toughness. I've seen this suggested on many guides, but after calculating the benefits based on real numbers while leveling, with 5/5, it yielded ~2% mitigation at various levels and gear setups. For comparison, you gain roughly the same physical EHP via agi-dodge from 2/2 Enhancing Totems, or 2/5 in Anticipation (also via dodge). I'll keep it in my mind, because if my EHP begins to fall off, I may need to take any benefit possible. However, presently, at level 40, EHP has not been a problem at all (with PuG healers--no organised groups).
---
That's a good idea, ty

People like this with tiny tiny mentals should not be playing classic because they are going to break their keyboards.
---
While omen indeed is a bit out of level, it doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things, the vast majority of your damage is unrelated to your offhand, so take comfort in knowing you have a solid main hand.

I gave my wow account to a friend when I thought I was going to do it.

Most country's pay there waiters and servers a livable wage so they don't need tips.

I don't know why your country does not consider a livable wage a basic need.

This is the problem I have with tipping the only place it exists is America and it's simply because you all get payed slave wages.

So the restaurant expects you as a citizen to pay the wages of another citizen...

If something in that chest was useful for the mage (since he was nearby) I generally offer it up to them, or the first toon I see that it could be useful for, if it's something I am just going to vendor.

Exactly - if we had an AoE combo group, or even if the tank is pulling a large group, then SURE.  Give him 5-10 sec to get aggro and then AoE to your heart's content.
---
Blizzarding the two mobs he pulled half a second after he pulled them is just stupid no matter the circumstance.
---
I swear some DPS players get off pulling aggro from the tank thinking "omg I did so much damage, the tank couldn't hold aggro" or something similarly stupid.
---
Every time I see a NPC bear parry or block me, I cry a little inside.
---
Beast mastery hunters probably, since in a pinch they can just pet+shoot, and reduce use of active abilities if going through mana too fast. Decent ways to get out of a bad situation / pull but not as much as druid.
---
Druid close second if feral, because mana regens in forms. Plus fantastic mobility to get out of a bad situation.
---
Warlock close third if affliction. You have two mana bars with life tap, several ways to recover health (and can always bandage while things are feared), and once you get dark pact mana might as well be unlimited

I’ve never played WoW and the last Blizzard game I played was Diablo 2, but I just wanted to thank you and the entire company (short of knowing specifically who to thank) for having this policy and for taking action on it. Independent of video games, you’re good people for doing this. It would be very easy to wash your hands of something like this, I don’t think many people would have even expected you to already had such a policy taking events like this into consideration, since it is rarely something considered in the scope of your responsibilities.

Bless all of ya.

---
I do this every time I quit an MMO so I don't go back.  I deleted several max level characters on WoW, Gladiators in full gear, etc.  I was done with the game.
---
I'm going to have to disagree there.  If someone is fighting a mob next to a chest, they plan to open the chest after the mob is dead.  If you open it after they did all the work clearing to it, that is definitely a dick move.
---
Proof?
---
I do this everytime I quit SWTOR. Head to Lowbie zones and dump cash.
---
I stopped deleting my chars because when I came back 6 months later I'd end up spending 15 for  sub and another 20 to boost a char to 70.
---
I hope your buddy is ok. Im back to SWTOR sadly, but I'm off weed and alcohol so i have that going for me.

Couldn't you just work until 5, pick up some take out on the way home, and have like 6 - 1130 free every night? Then get caught up on chores on the weekend?

Nice to hear the company say this, honestly wouldn't have expected it.

Thanks for being a good human being Blizzard guy.

So you're just a bad healer is what you're saying.

That's equally dangerous, not sure a druid wants to go out of bear form to dodge a fear when he lowers his armor by a huge margin.  You can just trap him and crit him down :)

The mithril trunks can have some very valuable stuff. Greens worth 2-3g, cloth, the black label drinks can go for 20-40s, I also fish blackmouth and stormscale pools which can go for decent money. I'm saving up the blackmouths for when the demand rises in P2. 
---
Sometimes I got a green worth 2g, and cloth worth over 1g from a single trunk.
---
Oof, I pulled 7 from a bad link. Okay, so 8. I concede that point. 
---
Did you miss the part about crits and % dmg increases being totally irrelevant to gift of arthas? Or the part about logs?
---
Wtf! Hope all is well OP
---
With the new economy in Classic, and good greens and blues going for cheap, gearing up a warrior as you level is very fun and easy. Just avoid sinking money into professions while leveling (skinning/mining will support your AH buys and mount purchase).

Honestly the only people defending multiboxers are multiboxers and streamer ball garglers.

You're not taking care of RL if you're isolating yourself, deleting your source of entertainment and giving stuff away is a pretty good possible indicator of suicide.  Unless he gave guildies his personal contact information then how would they even possibly try to get him to stay?

Cutting ties doesn't help you "stay in control" of anything unless you're cutting ties to people who hurt you.
---
Personally I'm thinking this situation is more serious than someone just quitting the game, especially since OP said that the person was being overwhelmed with mental exhaustion, cutting off your friends and your stress relief entertainment is NOT helping someone who is being overwhelmed in a stressful living situation.
---
You're a smart. My favourite thing though is going around low level areas and buffing priests with 22 int
---
Thats cool its just not really relavent to my earlier comments which was talking about hunter itemization and equipping gear that isn't efficient. Also, you would be stupid to pass on good agi gear for something with spirit. Most people are leveling hard in dungeons, and agi is the only stat that really matters there. Especially when they get to SM. When you get some armor and hp for your pet, it easily tanks two mobs while soloing so you shouldn't be losing HP and you shouldnt have to use that much mana either. Agi also increase chance to dodge and armor which should result in less damage being taken, and its scaling for atk power and crit which results in quicker clears and less dmg taken for your pet. If saw a hunter who was using a mix of stam/spirit/str and their gear I would assume they are stupid and noob if they were beyond the level 12 region.

Says the guy who's never been asked by a federal officer who they voted for.
---
Says the guy who wasn't given a warning for "attempting to speed" when their late-night bullshit stop yielded no PC for them to cite me. (FYI, I was below the speed limit, the 'attempting' was accelerating out of a stop light.)
---
And I'm a lucky guy. If I start bringing in people I know, it goes to:
---
Says the guy who wasn't given a permanent shoulder injury telling police they couldn't enter his residence without a warrant when they went to arrest his (adult, had moved out years ago, wasn't living there) daughter over a speeding ticket.
---
Says the guy who wasn't held on charges because an officer lied that a field test had found drugs (it hadn't, it was an innocuous substance).
---
etc.
---
The police here are *awful*. Avoid encountering them if at all possible.
---
And there are NUMEROUS cases where people who had mental or physical issues and encountered police were injured or killed by the police responding to calls for "help". Including a guy who realized he was decompensating and called them for help and was killed by them sitting on him until he suffocated.
---
Don't tell people that everything is rosy just because you *personally* have not had one of these encounters. You'd have to be willfully blind to ignore the number of them at this point.
---
Calling the police is a *risk*. Ignoring it would be stupid.
---
if they talked and corresponded outside of the game he'd not be here with this lame ass sob story about not having a way to contact his "friend"

acquaintances aren't friends, they're people who are civil enough to be polite but have no urge whatsoever to do more than that.

Strikers mark should never go to a hunter. Warrior Tank first then melee dps. 
---
Hunters get the leaf basically free of charge and it’s a better weapon.
---
Addons are third party software as well. The fact that code running on your computer was not originated by blizzard does not make it a bot.
---
A bot is software with an AI component that makes decisions and generates input to the game client.

Multi-boxing software passes keys that are pressed by a human to specific windows running on your computer. There is no AI component and no extraneous input generated. One key press for each action, all generated by a person at the keyboard.
---
There is a very clear difference here.
---
If Blizzard cared about their players mental health they would have stopped releasing store mounts. /s
---
But seriously this is insanely frustrating for collectors. Reward wallets, not gameplay and dedication.
---
I started a flame war in STV general because I stole some guys chest full of bread. To be fair he was a dirty mage who was hogging all the spawns
---
On the RP server, so I said "Hey man I'm just RPing a Rogue" knowing full well it would trigger him
---
I am SO glad I was a dick to him. Made my night lmao. He was raging in chat for like 2 hours. At the end of it I say "oh look another chest" and set him off one last time
---
My ultimate fantasy is if Blizzard treats WoW Classic like an experiment they can learn from, and later on with retail classic they burn it all. Make up an in-game-lore reason where everyone loses everything and everyone starts over. *(and of course think of a way to compensate long-time players and all their stuff)* And from there on it's a massive event that's a new start for everyone. The influx of new players like me trying out Classic could easily get translated in to permanent players and it'd be another opportunity to rake in even more players. And it'd be wild.
---
Did you sub for a month hit 60 an quit or are you on retail ?
---
Thanks, by one dimensional ish ill use other classes as foils - warlocks have a cc demon. Tanking demon. Anti caster demon. Curse of toungues. Exhaustion. Soul stone. Summon. Doomgaurd. Infernal. Etc...
---
Do mages have different rotations or strategies for different niches? Can you easily solo elites and harder content? Etc...
---
It's been a superlong time since I played a mage when arcane was the best meta
---
You clearly didnt read my comment, i said i have a problem with that when they dont sunder what they skull so they jave no aggro on skull
---
The God Mode was always on, not that we were ever allowed to use it.  We could "nuke" or "dm" mobs, sometimes even bosses in a bugged raid.  But GM's can't "fight" any mob.  We couldn't do much in game honestly, not anything that would ever be seen by any players.  Sometimes Senior GMs could meet up with a player or even a regular GM could appear to a player (with permission).  All the rules had been put into place from previous rogue GMs that would do mess with players in game.  I saw GMs repeatedly teleport annoying players way up into the air, dropping them into the ocean etc, and that was with all the rules an monitoring in place.
---
Why is it that along with classic, it seems like Blizzard made their customer support give a damn again like before they got bought by Activision?
---
Classic magetard
---
Are you gate keeping being close to people in a game? You're a piece of trash aren't you
---
Yeah not many things scarier in pvp than a Naxx geared lock.
---
I'd imagine benediction has priority over anathema... (They are the same item)
---
I'm not sure why you think they are so bad, I've seen several streams where they are towards the top and last night I was 4th highest caster dps across all encounters.
---
I mean. If the chest isn't locked, then everyone should have a chance at it.  If it is locked, then why should everyone have a chance at it?  If there was no one to unlock it, then no one would get it.   So if you CAN unlock it, and if you want to be nice and let people roll, that's cool. But that's your choice, the chest belongs to whoever can unlock it.  Literally all the leverage is in the hands of whoever can unlock it.  
---
 It's not the same as food or casting heals because those both speed up the run. Not healing means people will die and that doesn't make sense to do. Giving the healer water means they can spam it without worrying about wasting their own and makes the whole run smoother.   If someone doesn't open a chest, you just walk by it and that's the end of it lol.
---
It's not cheating to play multiple toons. Botting is cheating, multi-boxing is not. They are two completely different things.
---
No pulling more mobs than others around you isn't griefing if your clearing all the mobs.
---
tyvm
---
Ya that's hilarious. An abornormal amount of people already have their epic mounts.
---
Yes. And now you gouge one while the other one daze you. Fun times.
---
I don't know how people do this. My ISP took a shit 5 minutes into an RFC no bosses yet, and I still sent mail message apologies to the 2 names I remembered when my internet fixed itself an hour later.
---
You should stay banned. You're a cheater. Justify it to yourself however you want, but [you're cheating.](https://i.imgur.com/Jd0AMdY.png)
---
I didn't say it wasn't a dick move. But it isn't Ninja'ing.
---
Maybe I'm just bad but it seems like any time i face a lock or priest on my feral druid it is almost a guaranteed loss.
---
Why sticky the link to the comment and not the comment?
---
TL;DR just run to the fucking tank if you get threat. You’re not that good to be able to kite in BRD. Just run to the tank, please.
---
*sigh* I was afraid that was the case, but was hoping against all hope. Thanks!
---
*undue
---
Well established in your head-canon but in reality it's not botting or against the EULA.
---
Think he may mean the older one, but I used to love this show.

What a wonderful world we live in. This story was heartwarming, and I needed it today. Thanks OP
---
"all real vanilla mages"
---
I really hate this way of viewing things. I was a mage in vanilla and raided and did heavy PvP. Never ever ever carried lgiht feather and didn't even have slow fall on hotbar. 
---
Guess im just not a "real vanilla mage".
---
Got rank 11-12 in PvP before quitting. 
---
It was just a question though. Light feather drops in low level zones so you have to buy it off AH and I just never did. Was curious if most other people did carry it. 
---
Why even worry about slow fall when you can blink at the bottom?
---
1 month in. Can't decide. Tried everything a bit, most things to 15-20.   
---
I want to PVE, mostly. Some PVP later on in BGs. I enjoy the farming ability endgame of say: mage, hunter, prot paladin. I like knowing I can make a lot of gold, and having it and such. I like the free mount of paladin, as well. I like the leveling of mage and hunter, but end game PVE? Not much. Maybe ignite mage later? For end game PVE? I like Rogue, DPS warrior, ret/prot pally (Yes, I know...), etc.   
---
I enjoy questing and exploring a lot, too. 
---
I want to play Alliance, mostly. I don't really have much interest in warlocks, nor care for the playstyle. I'd like to be able to find raid spots, but am not worried about fast progression. Just being able to do it.   
---
I like DPS and tanking, but more so dungeon tanking and off tanking in raids. Healing I could take or leave.
---
We laughed at spellcleave, thinking they would hit 60 and have no idea how to play their class. Little did we know that all that spellcleave practice was perfect for killing multiboxers.
---
The issue is you cant control a massive community. Its a problem with the system not with player behavior.
---
Way to stick it to the bot dude.  That'll show 'em.
---
You shouldn't. Most people coming to reddit to dispute a ban are full of shit. Yes, false positives happen. That's obvious. The vast majority of them are not.
---
Notice that he got his ban overturned *before* coming to reddit. That's how most false positives are handled.
---
I was going to go with White Claws but let's be real, they ain't even on that level right meow.
---
It seems like every other expansion is below expectations. So the next one will be good. Right?
---
I'm way more interested in your healer's opinion.
---
&gt;Automation is the removal of the human from control of the application.
---
This is not an accurate definition.
---
You will surely get the Karkland
---
Maybe the dude just realized he'd already spent enough of his life playing this game 15 years ago and didn't need to do it again...
---
That's not meant as an insult to anyone who plays, but as someone who used to play wow back in the day, I certainly get nostalgic for it, but I can completely imagine myself taking it back up thinking It was going to be childhood all over again only to catch myself in the mirror two months later and think, "Wait... Don't I have other things I could be doing?"
---
I think you misunderstood me. It makes your next damage ability crit. In the example I used chain lightning because it is our hardest hitting spell. Queuing a shock spell at the end of your cast will roll the shock in with the chain lightning and cast both at the same time, so elemental mastery procs  on both spells, guaranteeing a crit on both
---
!remind me 7 days
---
Haha yeah. He s'ure s'howed you!
---
&gt; Did you miss the part about crits and % dmg increases being totally irrelevant to gift of arthas?
---
Well then okay, I was wrong, wanna call it 100 dps?
---
Care to find me a log where they don't have room for such a debuff.
---
Hahaha, that's awesome. Well thanks for your time! Super cool of you. I hope the OP gets the answers he's looking for. Sounds like Blizzard has gone above and beyond in situations like this before. And hopefully you're in something now that fulfills your life a bit more.
---
If you have a 1v1 fight with one person using multibox and one isn't, who is going to win? It's not cheating in writing but is in spirit of the game. It should have been banned when it surfaced so it would have been accepted within the community, because to everyone outside of wow community this is cheating.
---
For sure bro. I will let you know what they say
---
Turning your character 90 degrees let’s you strafe backwards, still hit your target and not expose your back. With how enemies positioning seems kinda wonky in Classic I usually strafe until right before I get them where I want them , then I turn back to them and backpedal the last few feet.
---
The obvious answer is of course shaman, but they can't be alliance.
---
Paladins can heal well and have great utility, but they're not good at tanking as bears/warriors except for AoE, and the lack of taunt hurts. They're not good at DPS either even as ret, and the playstyle is considered dull by many players.
---
How do you contact live support?
---
Finish gearing out I guess. Eye of Rend, SGC, Sadist Bracers, Painweaver band, Riphook, can't see the rest of your items.
---
It’s fucking horrendous game design, which is why I didn’t think I would like wow classic at all and why I thought that a majority of players would quit after a month.
---
Yes I discovered a multi boxer on my rppvp server, and it feels especially out of place
---
Agreed. This stuff is cringe from OP
---
Relax buddy not everyone farms gold and plays the same way. No need to be condescending
---
Idk it sounds nice and all but rarely do I find myself near a giant cliff while in PvP getting ganked. And if so, rarely will it be a cliff I'd be happy about having to jump off. 
---
I just use blink when falling from a far distance anyway.
---
&gt; that's pretty much limited to pvping and solo content.
---
You mean most of the game for most people?
---
&gt;The hybrid taxes in vanilla are real, and even with the crowd pummelers, you just won't be as good as the top-performers with best in slot gear. 
---
Sure, if you pidgeonhole "good" to mean "top spot on meters in raid content".
---
Never gunna see a player with nightfall topping the meters either, yet a lot of raids will want one.
---
You gunna bring 8 cat dps to a raid? Probably not. That doesnt mean that it isnt desirable, or even that it isnt optimal, to be bringing some ferals along.
---
Maybe he was frustrated that he was outpacing everyone and looked for a more hardcore guild
---
They're also really dull to level unless you're okay with crazy amounts of downtime
---
I used it to fear yo-yo while still maintaining DPS on my lock. It was invaluable for doing so safely since a miss-click when fear yo-yoing can mean a wipe.
---
Why post that picture over and over when it shows how ignorant you are?
---
DPS warriors that are trying to gear up but are tanking to make the process faster, what spec are you using for this? Just your standard fury spec and throwing on a shield / some defensive gear or what? I honestly don't recall how we did this 15 years ago, pretty sure it was just that, but wanted to make sure there wasn't a better way that I'm missing? Thanks.
---
How are you going to get off cs ss ss gouge on a dr'd (2s) cs?
---
Looks awesome. Ima have to get this one. Is I thought to play with and set up your own settings?
---
Is the boot enchant 8%?  I thought it was less than that.
---
I’ll give it a go tonight, thanks!
---
Aw. I love you guys.
---
I like joining these groups without improved Blizzard. You should see their reaction.
---
I had the same experience two days ago. I didn't even know that they existed until I saw a huge foot fall in front of my screen. I let out a very loud "WHAT THE FUCK?" and died shortly after.
---
Sadly Westfall is pretty casual by leveling standards, there's barely any 50+ items on the AH
---
Probably the best video series from Vanilla is called World of Roguecraft. Funny banter between a rogue and warlock about class dynamics with PvP played to Rammstien intermittently sprinkled in
---
Are you aware of blink ?
---
Everyone has their own methods, but when you can blink which is a 20 second cool down and take zero damage while still going the way you want and not having to slowly fall, why not?
---
I jump off large cliffs when I will save time doing it... Then I blink.
---
Imagine thinking you're good at a game because you can afford multiple WoW subs.
---
Yea, tbh 5 talent points for 5% mana is complete garbage. Shield spec is useful if you like.. keep a shield + 1h around for pvp or something idk.
---
You are reading way too much into the simplistic system that is Pre-BC player versus player combat. The only mandatory thing for being competitive is Engineering for the stuns and utility. I mean, when I run across a mage I know exactly what is going to happen. He uses Frost Nova and Blink, I will use intimidate for 3 second stun, he ice blocks then blinks again and casts frost bolt. I meanwhile try to time Aimed Shot for the end of Ice block duration. 
---
Classic WoW PvP is a game of chess played with Rooks and the winner is almost always who shot first.
---
I get it, and even a 40-hour course doesn't seem like enough. That's only 5 days at 8 hours a day. Sure some of that info might stick, but it's not going to be something that will turn the tides in the aggregate especially if only 15% of departments utilize them. 
---
In terms of fatality by cop I see your argument and while I'm typically one of the ACAB types I do believe that most cops are either just genuinely trying to be a decent public servant, or they're just trying to do their job with as little hiccups as possible. In either case, those cops are fine and I don't have a problem with them. It's the ones who get a hothead cause of their badge (or they were already a hothead who wanted the badge as a shield) that concerns me because they typically are very quick to resort to violence. And what concerns me even more is that there isn't an effort inside police departments to reform the image of police officers at least not an effort that's obvious to me. I get that there are strong bonds formed between these people but come on when it's gotten to the point that the police are seen as disfavorably as they are, then you'd figure more of them would be out calling for reform.
---
And as an aside, shows like Cops and LivePD are not helping here. They're turning the darkest side of law enforcement into entertainment, and frankly that's dangerous as fuck. Not only cause it makes the hotheads feel like they can be famous for being the "good guy" on Cops/LivePD but moreso that they skew the public perception of what crimes are being committed the most. The vast majority of the crimes shown are drug related, but drug related crimes have been steadily falling, as have most crimes, over the last couple of decades. Why can't these shows follow cops while they, idk, direct traffic when a traffic light goes out or in front of a major school crossing? Why can't it show the police respond to a break-in and the subsequent investigation? Or maybe a gang investigation? Or doing foot patrols and speaking to the community? At least shows like First 48, despite the reality show feel, portrays cops doing honest police work. There's nothing honest about busting meth heads in the trailer park. That's just sad, but goddamn if it isn't entertaining I guess.
---
It’s open world if your not in a group don’t worry about it.
---
But you said 4 hours of AFK fishing though? wouldn't this require moving around and searching for the pools?
---
Anywhere near 60? I still haven't landed on a toon I want to play! Doesn't help that I got this quirk, that if I leave a character for long enough, I feel disassociated from it and can't bring myself to play it again... Always been like this with saved games in singleplayer games, etc. 
---
Never had so much issue before though tbh, I think it's some core design philosophies of Classic and my desires that don't gel together... and yet when I'm playing, I love the world itself.
---
I dont want to see bad fan made art of a non part of the game (honestly a d3 demon hunter?) It ruins the sub
---
Nope, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Frustrating maybe, but reasonable.  
---
I'd hit a renew before each mob just to keep moving the priest from canceling casts of heal spells. Should keep her mana, and your health up enough.
---
If you have two screens, one per screen would allow easier management - particularly if you use an addon to make a couple really big panic buttons on the priest screen.
---
It was a rhetorical question.  The only reason to post a picture to an obvious text post is to karma farm...
---
Basically you turn \~60 degrees and strafe that way, then the other way and strafe that way too.
---
Lets you zigzag backwards without putting your back to mobs.
---
Practise on open world mobs and make sure you can still hit them while you're doing it. If you aren't hitting them, they're "behind" you and you can't dodge their attacks.
---
Ravager reserved tho
---
Like I told others, my reasoning is blink. 
---
Slow fall only use for me would be to get to a spot you cannot without slow fall and that's due to added horizontal distance. 
---
If vertical distance is the concern, blink near the bottom. Problem solved. Much faster.
---
Oh, is not being whipped up into a fervor of hatred against people who don’t play the why I want them to considered apathy now? Then I wear the mantle with pride.
---
"They have to greet you with a smile and pretend they enjoy filling your drink while you harass and demean them. I don't know why you think they don't deserve a tip."
---
This is everything wrong with Amercian tipping culture go anywhere else and you will see it's not normal for wait staff or customers to act like you describe
---
How you describe how customers act is fucking disgusting tipping seems to make people act worse.
---
Wait stuff should not need to smile and pretend they like filling drinks or be fake . And customers should not harras or demean wait staff..
---
This is all comes from your tipping culture wait staff have to kiss ass for tips and customers have too much power to treat wait staff like shit
---
If you get rid of tips and pay wait staff more fair wages they will not need tips and the customer has almost no power.
---
Sorry tipping triggers me because there's no point and in most cases it makes service alot worse.
---
I level as Fire for the fun burst DPS even though frost is the conventional wisdom.
---
&gt; Otherwise you'll be in LFG doing LF1M Tank for a while.
---
I deal with it. I play a lock a fair amount  right now.
---
He probably killed himself because hes a gay nerd
---
really hope he comes back . i know what your feeling . literally same situation the only difference is he came back. The reason was he needed a break but didnt want to tell me . hopefully its a situation like this and not something drastic . we wouldnt want that for anybody.
---
1 tick of effective healing after the tank is in combat will definitely put you in combat and create threat.
---
Except highest damage
---
Elementals in stonetalon charred Vale
---
Yeah that’s what I thought you meant, I was just surprised that queuing up a shock at the end of a cast makes the system treat both spells as your “next” spell. Even though the spells resolve in the same tick, I would have assumed that an ability affecting your “next” spell would only trigger for a single spell, not the combined spells which resolve simultaneously.
---
That’s how I quit WoW back in 2005, clean break. Deleted account and moved on. I didn’t have the energy for both my work life that paid me as well as my online life that didn’t. While fun, WoW was ultimately too large a time sink for very little reward for me personally.
---
Hope he is well though, I did at least tell a few folks before I left so the thoughts of self harm wouldn’t be there.
---
So everyone on the opposite faction new what they were doing and went to a different later to avoid it, or was there just nobody from the other faction around?
---
Same as the last 15 years of the game and the hundreds of post asking this same question in subreddit.
---
It's pretty easy to set up, hardest part is deciding which frames to disable.
---
The drop rate in vanilla was .2%, but was bumped up to 1% since then. It's not a fast farm because you have to kill all the bosses before you're allowed to even  attack Baron Rivendare because of event triggers. So even though you can mop the floor with the enemies you still have to walk through the entire dungeon. So no it's not odd that it would take a long time to get the mount.
---
Wiping in any of the blackrock instances multiple times strains my patience as well. Of all the places to fuck around and not focus up, the instances with 5min runbacks are not the best.
---
Farming shit happens daily on Reddit. People endlessly post a picture with some sob story attached to rake in karma.
---
They are definitely the least played class. My guess is because they are just OK a lot of things.  
---
Personally, I love druids and all the specs are fine (it just takes more work and experience to play things like balance instead of resto). The issues you run into with Balance is mostly mana management at end game and with the 16 debuff cap in raids, you can't really do more than just spam wrath.  
---
To be totally honest, modern mmo players are good enough at clearing and commanding the end game content that I don't think it matters too much what anyones spec is anymore. People are out there clearing Onyxia with 25 people, some under 60...So as long you learn how to handle the spec you want to play and find others who don't mind too much then you can do whatever.
---
I'll give myself a few months, but talents being so important and being so difficult - sucks
---
Not if he sold it with no gold and sent it to you.
---
Don’t think layering is going anywhere...
---
No, and those people are being babies about it. 
---
Had you been in a group or the mage been right next too it, maybe it can be considered ninjaing if someone really cares that much. But even then, its a level 30 chest that has no more of a chance to drop something worth while than a level 30 mob does, so it really doesn't matter. 
---
And as you said, you didn't even mean to take it from someone else, so I'd just go about your day and let them be salty about something so trivial.
---
Umm if I was botting I could grab a beer and go to sleep while my character levels or farms gold, your correlations are very ignorant and off the mark.
---
: (
---
Which works great until you have 2 people doing it.
---
This is so comforting to learn and I can’t believe I didn’t know this considering how much time I used to spend playing MMOs.
---
Honest to god, one of my ex-GM friends had to link it to me, because I couldn't find it. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful in this situation!
---
Sounds like my cup of tea! Thank you
---
Idk I just use blink to avoid fall damage. Never had to use slow fall for anything except adventure exploiting to unreachable areas.
---
Most botters run 10-40 clients at once and still get banned..
---
That's the thing, op's friend didn't say any goodbyes whatsoever, which is worrying.
---
It’s a pretty fucking serious set up, monitors out of the movie swordfish (or the matrix if you’re not familiar) and I believe two PCs running the system
---
It would mess with the economy.  Talent respeccing is a pretty large gold sink that is built into the game.  This is one of those changes that sounds little and a small QoL upgrade but could have larger impact.
---
Plot twist: mage blinks and never agros
---
This is some Black Mirror level weirdness. Dude probably just wasn’t down with the game anymore and wanted out without a big fuss. No need to freak out this much.
---
Yeah, I wake up early and would take a tour down a beach and find a couple that would be a good yield.  Now farming/running back and forth?  Probably not worth it but getting there and every pool is up is profitable.
---
DPS rate for activity time is quite favourable. But if you look at total DPS Ele is pretty garbage (even if we sort it out to being single target only). While mages might need to drink between each pull, they're rarely completely oom. Ele running full tilt will need to drink up fully.
---
I've found R7 LB + clearcasting R10 or Chain is the best. This keeps me roughly with hunters/mages, and keeps my mana use in line with what mages spend per pull. And on either dangerous fights or boss encounters I know the duration of I can top single target charts by pure R10 LB.
---
Overall I manage to keep equal performance with pugs from most classes, so it's not too bad. DPS warriors/rogues that are geared make me look pretty useless, but I get to "claim" a portion of their DPS via windfury procs. Mwhahahaha.
---
whenever i make someone take res sickness i know i pissed them off so much. And the fact they can do nothing about it makes it even better. Its even sweeter when my friend and i decide on a target to gank. i kill him while my friend waits at the graveyard for him to take res sickness ^^
---
That's the downside of having the game mined and analyzed over and over; I was in a semi-HC (raid 3x/week, killed twin emps/raz, MT xferred cos we weren't really getting anywhere/people were burning out with BC coming out in 3 months) and the 3-4 dps warriors we had were arms because we all pvp'd too much. Nobody cared about min/maxing.
---
As someone has levelled to 60 as a hunter in classic, PvP is hard. I need to get way better at it. Every single mage knows how to just sit right in your deadzone and nuke you.
---
And of course you are outside playing in the park with butterflies and puppies while writing that right?
---
Yet one of your latest posts on reddit is "Gay people don't deserve a whole month".  Guess there are good guys and shit people at every organization. The fact you aren't there anymore is probably a good thing.
---
You said you were close... Maybe you don't know what close means.
---
ilvl has always existed
---
It makes sense they drop when you move but that's pretty drastic. Have you tried anything to fix it? Disable addons, change various graphic settings etc.
---
What spec are you?
---
It doesn't show edit unless it was more than 3 minutes after you posted.
---
As a wow vet of 15 years and a person who has battled depression a good portion of my life. Never stop doing this. If someone, ANYONE, you care about is acting strange to them. Always check on them. Sometimes they just need someone to reach out, sometimes they want some space. Both are fine, but never stop caring.
---
Literally every single mage I have fought has done it to me since the first one in Ashenvale at level 23
---
It's pretty weird that you didn't mention that, especially since it would help you find him.
---
Definitely as long as you keep a set of caster gear, though the lack of normal rez if you don't have a shaman/pally/priest in the group is annoying if/when anything goes wrong.
---
But you'll probably be asked to tank more than heal, since bear tanks are great for most 5 mans and you're the only other decent tank besides warriors (paladins can do AoE tank well but struggle otherwise especially with the lack of taunt).
---
You offered nothing but insults and no evidence to back up your weak claims. I gave fact and lore examples to back up my point that the forsaken are a terrible race and should not be in the horde. Get off your fake high horse, pull your head from your ass and learn to read an opposing opinion before you spout more nonsense
---
Why did you record this in your phone :|
---
Bc it’d be worse without it
---
Lot of people who don’t know how good RoA is for mage and how long it’s total BIS responding here.
---
Pretty easy to indicate that, so people don't try to track you down.
---
Where does this one command, one action rule come from?
---
Well, ever since citizens united, corporations are given the rights of people. So I would say that I generally agree, the non-human people are the ones you gotta watch out for.
---
No shit....... Try farming for years. Not days. Years.
---
Classic's talent system is more engaging and more fun to level with, but retail has WAY more viable builds. Furthermore there are different builds for different situations. It goes beyond just talents but things like gear too.
---
Ever heard of a Metaphor?
---
Last time I did it I was arms and still did well with def stance and shield. As I got more plate gear I even tanked with 2h and an armor potion. Obviously not tanking raids, but 5 mans.
---
Free money for blizzard, so they don't touch it. Even when the multiboxer on tich was blatantly griefing on multiple occasions...
---
Does hating retail players get you off?
---
Adrenaline Rush my dude.
---
Just type it to them, hit enter, unplug internet.
---
Same at the goshek farm in arathi for alliance
---
You have no idea.
---
Did you jump off the diving platforms?
---
I'm not sure what your point is here. I added it as an afterthought because blink is a 15 second cooldown, which is significant.
---
Mufasa definitely wasn't immortal

&gt; field because I need a break, letting down my ream
---
Why do you think substitutions exist. Terrible analogy
---
Remindme! 1 week
---
Yes retail sucks as far as having a lot of talents to pick from. But classic sucks as far as having talents that actually do stuff. You get to pick 51 talents that barely do anything vs like 7 in retail that mostly all have a big impact on your character.
---
There is a big argument to be made about limiting choices and blah blah blah in retail.. but using vanilla class design as a base for what it should be is totally wrong. vanilla's class design and balance was total garbage. Most of the specs don't work or are so broken they aren't worth playing. They designed a tank spec that can't taunt. The 31 talent for paladin's dps tree is a CC. Paladins don't press buttons during their dps rotations. Druids have a choice of being a healer or a tank. Most classes optimal dps rotations are boiled down to pressing like 1 button over and over again. The list goes on and on. At least in retail, each spec functions the way it is meant to, lol.

25 minutes exactly from when the last person started it.
---
What level did you start soloing her?
---
im a druid level 47, at the current rate i have to be grinding mobs for another 60-70 hours before i can get to 60.
---
While I obviously don't know if its true or not I would imagine it isn't entirely unlikely that your connection to a certain website which is sometimes used for rwt in different games could be what might have triggered the flagging of your account aswell. Glad you got unbanned though, I always thought you were a nice guy even when alot of people didn't.
---
Nothing but insults? I claimed that you never even tried to see their perspective (which everyone can tell from your post) then gave an example of said perspective, put it in relation to the orc's perspective and then spiced it up with a little banter. You decided to ignore everything but said banter so you can claim I am the unreasonable one but you are doing quite the bad job of convincing anyone
---
Actually it is possible, it's called you actually pay a human to review automated bans before they go out.
---
IMO you can go 0/31/20 and tank pretty dang well, so long as you take Imp Shield Block and 5/5 Defiance. Did that back in Vanilla and I think it works well now too - tho I'm not playing a warrior in classic atm.
---
I once protected an afk guy in shimmering flats until he safely logged out. 
---
He never even knew I saved him a death.
---
It would be bad and you should feel bad for even asking this question.
---
Honestly it will probably make me quit the game before i reroll.
---
There's usually a break
---
1 000 000
---
It is the responsibility of a dps to control their threat level.
---
The debate here is that it should be against the ToS. Bringing up the fact that it isn't against the ToS is irrelevant.
---
Cool
---
Honestly I would worry more about your well-being in the next few moments but okay
---
Good guy blizzard man kudos.
---
I had 10g at 24ish. My main (27 sham lul) paid for 4 10 slotters and that was the only head start I had on my lock (new main). Made a huge did defence n questing speed and income. 
---
Spent some on cloth to lvl tailoring. Went down to a out 6g. Then back up to 12 at 29. Just hit 30 last night and didn't freak lie questing after training so I spent another 6g on silk. Planning on making my own shadowweave set as the lvls come.
---
And yeah just read the last part of your last reply again after my reply and treat as if I wrote that to you since it's kinda the truth you are projecting there
---
We will see what happens but, judging on Alliance performance in PvP on my server so far... I am not optimistic.
---
You need to stop thinking of multiboxers as one player. They are exactly however many players they are playing. It's not a 1v1. It's a 1v2 or 1v3.
---
&gt;If you have a 1v1 fight with one person using multibox and one isn't, who is going to win?
---
So instead, ask yourself, if you are in a 3v3 or 5v5 vs multiboxer, who's going to win?
---
Legit or quit!
---
It's not that Spirit is useless, it's that all of the other stats are better. Maybe it's better than Stamina on PvE servers.
---
I agree that the talent suggestions are terrible. Shield Spec is close to worthless even if you're actually using a shield because block values are so low. Like, look at Marbled Buckler, a shield you can get as a quest reward in Razorfen Kraul at a minimum level of 29. It has a block value of 17. With no additional block rating, 5/5 shield spec raises your block value to 21 and your chance to block to 10%. Before shield spec: average mitigation per hit from block is 17 * .05 = .85 damage. After shield spec, average mitigation per hit from block is 21* .1 = 2.1 damage. Looking at it one way, it more than doubles the efficacy of your blocks... but in absolute terms, having the talent makes a difference of less than 2 damage per hit. Most of the extra mitigation you get from your shield actually comes from its armor value, which has jack all to do with Shield Spec.
---
Improved Lightning Shield: Lightning Shield is a tiny portion of your damage even if you are hitting it every time it falls off, which will basically prevent you from ever regenerating mana. Increasing it by 15% is useless.
---
Not taking Improved Ghost Wolf: With a 1 second cast, Ghost Wolf is a flexible ability that can be used as an escape or gap closer in addition to a travel power. With a 3 second cast, you will never want to cast it in combat.
---
Also what the hell is going on in the Resto tree? We're skipping Totemic Mastery to take... what, that third point in Improved Lightning Shield? Tidal Focus adds up to one extra heal per 20 heals you cast, and they took it over Improved Healing Wave which shaves half a second off your mana-efficient heal.
---
That’s the best part
---
I genuinely think you should talk to a professional. This comes off as innocent at first, but it's abnormal to have this kind of apprehension and indecisiveness in a video game to the point you're worried about your experience.
---
People will flock to downvote me and call me names, but surely you understand it's not "normal" to level every single class simeotaneously WHILE BEING WORRIED this behaviour is holding you back from something. It's not an issue until it affects you negatively and it clearly is.
---
It's crazy this was posted today.
---
I am a guildmaster of a small guild of maybe 30 people in a classic server.  
---
One of my officers who has been more of leader since the guild was made, someone I was willing to purchase their mount for when they hit 40, completely vanished from my guild and the server today.  I am completely confused what happened, they showed no signs of this and are a 51 year old adult with a stable job and life.  They aren't on my friends list anymore, they aren't on the server if i type /friend Qbal, completely gone.
---
I'm so heartbroken to be honest.
---
Possibly a game master? Basically a moderator of wow that works for blizzard. But I have a hard time seeing a scenario where you would threaten to kill yourself in front of a game master since you really never see one.
---
That's kinda shitty. If someone I played a lot with told me they had to quit because it was affecting the rest of their life, I'd say goodbye and sincerely wish them luck, I guess some addicts need to drag other people down with them. I've heard similar things from people who have been addicted to drugs and their friend groups
---
What is osrs?
---
I've spent hours watching swordfish about 15 seconds at a time...
---
Take my fucking money
---
Sounds like those people aren't true gamers
---
I have 8 days played. Although that is quite signicant chunk of time IMO it was well spent. I haven't felt this happy, passionate, or(oddly enough -sociable-) in a very long time. I did not ruin my life at all by  playing this much. I still eat well. I keep to regular routine. I exercise. I am running multiple high profile projects at work. Its not like played time is a direct correlation to a an issue. I think its dependant on the person and where they are at in life. They can be the judge to when its unhealthy. And its their responsibility to fix it if there is.
---
Now, do I consider myself casual? No.
---
Do I consider myself hardcore? No.
---
I'm a good mix. I don't mind being silly and having fun. I'm not all about min-max life. I like to do things naturally efficiently - But that alone doesn't stop me from playing the game for the FUN of it.
---
People need to realize its a game and that there is a life outside the game. You can't rely on a game to solely support yourself and your well being
---
For sure it exceeded their expectations but for what the future hold , other than the announced phases , who knows
---
This response is exactly what people are saying as to unhealthy behavior. You right away are trying to nickle and dime your life to maximize gaming time. You would chose to clock our of work at exactly quitting time, eat unhealthy and then get 6-7 hours of sleep just so you can have more time to game?
---
Im from Firemaw-EU , tried to farm some leathers just now and the same two guilds you mentioned are still doing this. They would call a warlock named Attom and his buddies to gank everybody else.
---
Well people better get used to it. Layering will be removed from the game, sooner or later.
---
The only way they should add things is if they add new servers that are forever locked to a given expansion. 
---
Let classic get to phase 6 then open up some TBC servers and let those get to the equivalent of phase 6 and then do the same with WotLK. 
---
The point of classic is to reexperience old content as it was (more or less) when it was fresh and relevant.
---
Old School Rune Scape
---
The real difference: most European cops don't carry guns.
---
&gt;You're not the type of person that does well with reason
---
That's an ad-hom attack and not a response to an argued point. Hypocritical as all hell, too.
---
I'd be overjoyed if you could put together literally **one** rational response to justify the personal attacks you're throwing around because you're seemingly incapable of defending your position.
---
&gt;Luckily, I've never been with... any group with you're [sic] ignorant position.
---
You haven't, because I make loot rules known at the start of the run and ninjas generally leave when they see they can't waltz with free patterns they can't use and BiS items they can't equip that people in the group actually need.
---
Imagine being so terrified of confrontation you fling shit online but absolutely refuse to stand your ground when asked to explain yourself and your position.
---
I've been nothing but open with my views and you've done nothing but act like a twelve year old lmfao.
---
Have fun, ninja.
---
There is a spot where a huge rock keep wiggling on top of a stone pillar. A short video clip recorded at that place will work much nicer.
---
Most of the mitigation from your shield comes from the extra armor though, block values are so low on leveling shields that buffing your blocks is almost meaningless.
---
Keeping up shadow weaving is extremely easy without mp5, you can use rank 1 mind blast on CD if you start the fight with 0 Mana. In general priests don't really want mp5 that much since they regen Mana while casting thanks to their talents.

Story goes, in order to hide the height difference between the two actors (Diesel at approx 5'11 and The Rock at anywhere between 6'3 and 6'5), they shot this scene with the actors standing next to eachother, while angling it to attempt to give the impression of the characters being face to face. It ens up with two scenes where whichever actor is closer to the camera ends up looking abnormal, especially if you look at their heads in each shot
---
They look like crab and walk like ppl...we ducked!!!!
---
The min/max mentality will be on every server.  Can you find a lot of good groups on an RP server?  Yes.  Grob has amazing RP.  We also have great pve and pvp groups (most guilds do both.)  As a member of Grob and a life long RPPVP server player who has never actually seriously RPd I feel like we bring the best of both.  If you want more info check out r/grobbulus
---
Maybe he wanted u to get a mount really bad
---
Taste like crab, talk like people
---
You macro character actions on each account: 
---
Ctrl + 1:
---
Main character - Whatever spell they have
---
Character 2 - Target leader focus, cast frostbolt
---
Character 3 - Target leader focus, cast Smite
---
Character 4 - Target leader focus, cast Charge
---
etc etc
---
Then you use a program to mimic your keypresses on each instance of the game. You press ctrl+1, its inputs to all wow windows
---
I’m not sure why they say I’m wrong, I’ve multiboxed myself a 2nd account when I got the game again for my birthday from someone.
---
I never found the quest... I'm sure I had all the pages.
---
Tween?  That's exactly the type of person I'm imagining would post what OP did.
---
You can do what you like as long as the emp dies before her.  She can’t be CCed though and she will try to heal him so have interrupts ready.
---
All I know is the population will be big for a good while. I have no plans on stopping. Taking forever for me to level with just an hour or two a day. I know there are many others in the same boat.
---
Get to level 10 pretty fast but then it slows down for me. I must be doing something wrong. I’m sure there’s a more efficient way of leveling haha
---
In retail like 90% of talents are either never used or only have a single use case.
---
Also most of my point was that they actually restrict abilities that used to be defining for each class to only be accessible in a certain spec. Like how we used to have all our abilities except some talent abilities. Now if you’re a resto druid you don’t get all the abilities for feral or guardian or balance. At best you can get a watered down version by taking 1 of the affinity talents.
---
So just my two cents but in the middle of wotlk I got sick of my dk and tanking, sent all my gold to a friend, deleted my char and stopped playing for 3 years. So it could be that your guildmate decided that wow is dumb the way I did.
---
Because its allowed, a non-issue and you guys are whining about it.
---
That is not core strength man that’s rigormortis
---
We're talking about a general break here, getting that in depth about it is just weird. If you want to go down that road you can quite as easily just say "hey guys need to go" and log off. 
---
The lengths people will go to to sound superior about this game is just odd.
---
It started with all the posts about people demeaning anyone who wasn't taking their time to get to 60 and if you're a certain level you must be a loser with no life, while the people saying that were supposed winners.
---
What I think happened? He probably realised that all this was getting out of hand like it possibly has before. But I hope you get an answer so you don't have to worry.
---
This wasn’t changed until one of the more recent expansions (wood maybe?).
---
Just a thought, and apologies if anyone else has raised this, but when you click on the link to report a 'real life threat', the language on the page doesn't lead me to think (had I not seen the above post), that this would be the way to go about raising a concern. Maybe an extra paragraph might make it clearer?
