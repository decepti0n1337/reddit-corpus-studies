Macro won't work as well in classic as unlike in vanilla, /run (or /script) is disabled during combat.

---
---
No way!

Shazzrah - Alliance

Golemagg - Horde

Sadly, as a long time user of reddit and being a gamer most of my life, it takes a lot of time for people to realize things that would benefit themselves.
---
Agree! I hope they can compromise and let the skeletons stay, im not fussed about the corpses.
---
Nice
---
Disabling Discord Overlay fixes it.
---
&gt;Obviously the full ones are better
---

---
Why is that obvious? The quality of a server isn't just the number of players.
---
funny thing is, if they DID decide to change either of these it would work better as a surprise.  If they wanted it to be a surprise, they'd have to say "nochanges" when asked about it.
---
Have nothing better to do on Monday.  Gonna give this a shot.
---
Looking forward to our STV adventures again my man &lt;3
---
The former. He is implying that the talents are irrelevant. Your provided healing spells are enough. Just make sure you have +Intellect gear on when healing.
---
How many hours for his first WC?
---
What would you do if a natural disaster destroyed your internet on launch day
---
Your hash from the image doesn't work.

And i just did a scan of the same file and found nothing suspicious.
---
place /giggle as the last command and you are Gucci
---
You'll find groups just fine. Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise
---
Played since classic, my man.
---
Not surely. Oldschool runescape hasn't gone anywhere be near rs3 and classic wow community doesn't want this to be anything like retail. I do say there would need to be precautions and limitations though.
---
There was a bit of a fuzzy answer from the AMA today, but with them saying that Bindings are dropping Phase 1, I think that means Domo chest will be available in Phase 1 as well possibly?  Should be able to get both parts and have the bow/staff quest then?
---
But if it won't be available.  But I'm not 100% on hungers, but isn't 3.0+ the sweet spot for a weapon?  So Blackcrow be best?  But I'd think Blastershot Launcher would make up in the fast attack with the better DPS and damage per shot?
---
Yes, I care about people behaving negatively against an accomplishment. That doesn't equal a need for people to react positively to it. There is an in-between neutral where nobody cares and nobody reacts negatively, and that's fine.
---
This just sent my nostalgia levels through the roof.
---
Oh really, that's very interesting. Could have just saved me rerolling! Where are you getting the info from?
---
Cool factor.  Not a character sheet stat, but it exists.
---
You're a waste of computing resources.
---
What?
---
Think he's referring to [this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJAkOZ4lXk) which overturns a lot of conventional wisdom about Shaman weapon enchants. Even on the slowest of weapons, Rockbiter comes out on top. You can always get lucky with Windfury, of course. But Rockbiter's better on average.
---
You can dps as any spec in dungeons if you start the group 😬😬
---
the right answer is: The rogue dude had a binding. He should of gotten to complete it as it could of been months or never till the other one showed up again for the tank.
---
&gt; But Kevin Jordan confirmed there was special code that overrode batching/heartbeat for things like interrupts and traps -- spells that needed to be executed immediately.
---
This team has access to the original source code and is in a greater position to speak about it.
---
Don't downplay it, rights that erode slowly can be hard to notice, and there was no reason net neutrality should've been taken down. There's no positives, and no apparent negatives yet, but it allows only for negatives (or the current state) in the future.
---
This is why the servers get fucked.
---
then you get over-zealous developers that implement shit changes that eventually lead to retail-like gameplay because it's literally impossible for a single human to gauge the needs and wants of a hardcore community.
---
HAHA. My thoughts exactly! That must've been horrible /u/ogronz
---
Lol!
---
So when I was there(which included wrath) GMs were still very much a thing. They had two departments, one that was just Game Masters, the other was more technical/billing support. By the time I left during WoD they were working to combine the two into one department, everyone was trained to do both. Even in that situation though the GM wasn’t going away, just expected to do more tasks, but a much more corporate call center environment feel to it by the time I left.
---
Didn’t you hear him?  Some guys ran the numbers!
---
Same here, yet I never saw you.  Coincidence, or layering?
---
Lmfao at all the people about to get banned because they don't want to take 15 minutes to set up addons.

Remote desktop!
---
you mad?
---
Yup I'm running 4k @60
---
I'm just kinda going on luck, I feel like some people on a realm will drop off and some are gonna thrive like you're suggesting, so I'm just banking on the more full one to be the best chance of staying that way\*
---
Because no one will let the druid tank?  ;)
---
Seriously, warriors can be a little more selective with groups because they are in demand.  You need a tank for most group content, and the numbers mean usually dps need the tank more than he needs the dps....same with healers.  This is compounded by tanks doing less group content as they get geared, and since they share less gear (1 tank instead of 3) it means it happens quicker in general.
---
That being said, I have met some amazing tanks who were happy to go out of the way for groupmembers.  Just make sure and be friendly with the good ones.
---
Found the eq player
---
Why are you leaving out Mila Kunis?
---
Where ever you play it’s going to be fun I wouldn’t stress it too much
---
I agree, over healing during lvling is going to a huge waste of mana. 
---
Know your spells and how much they heal, this will help with not over healing. No need to heal every if they are at 95% health.
---
Use different ranks of heals,  if rank 2 works fine no need to use rank 3. You'll save mana.
---
My favorite holiday was Halloween event due to the Scarlet Monastery turning into a giant WPVP area. The floor was just a blanket of skeletons. I really hope they fix this by then.
---
Somebody take note, this was the first day of the #changes movement
---
That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm coming back to the game, and having maintained any connections to my old party. I'm just going to show up on the server with the shortest line and play. I'll make friends and find a guild along the way, just like I did back then.
---
I'm trying to make classic WoW as new to me as possible. I'm playing a Tauren druid, I've never played a Tauren or a druid before so it will be an all new experience.
---
YES! LOL! Especially because they used Everquest in almost every way as their baseline to create WoW, they ripped off it REALLY hard.
---
I know this is a week old, but...
---
I think you're both right and wrong. Percieved hassle will stop some people. My wife doesn't want to play warlock or hunter because of the "hassle" of shard and ammo, and losing a bag slot for it.
---
But having soloed warlock 1-60 back in classic, I'd say you're mostly right. It's really not a hassle. You keep some on you, replenish as you go, and destroy them as you need bag space, because it's pretty simple to get them back.
---
To say you're a bad warlock if you run out is wrong, though. My friend mained warlock and she was part of a raid group. Providing for everyone was expected of the locks, so she'd have to farm extra. And if a raid group is trying to prog and learning a fight, and keeps wiping on a boss, it's easy enough to run out.
---
It wasn't uncommon for her to go in with nothing but soul shards and a few empty spots in her bags. Not because she was bad, but because they'd get to the boss they were wiping on and she wanted to be able to burn through shards without having to leave the raid to get more.
---
Granted, that's not a normal situation. That's 4+ hour raid nights while learning fights (or maybe undergeared) and hoping one of 39 other people don't fuck up. In general, I agree with you. I just feel you're drawing too hard a line on "if you run out, you're bad", and ignoring the percieved hassle of the classes.
---
Shit, piss, and cum. Not in any specific order and possibly simultaneously.
---
I have that old google chrome extension that changes "SJW" to "spooky skeleton" and for the first time in like 5 years, it actually made a post confusing! Go figure
---
Nice isn't the adjective I would have went for.
---
His arse
---
&gt; will it have it's own expansions that it'll go through?
---
Wouldn't that mean having a second WoW team creating an alternate universe-Azeroth?
---
I mean, the work involved in creating more story to play in an expansion is already a lot, if they had Classic-specific expansions they'd essentially be doing twice the work in terms of creating separate stories and experiences. Hell, it may even get worse for them if suddenly Classic exps are demanded to be in current-WoW.
---
Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but the idea just seems unfeasible unless they actually want to start having to refer to WoW-Classic events and maintain clarity when people (or they) speak about lore from one version or the other.
---
I love you.
---
I was set on rogue but now considering paladin LOL
---
darn it!  how'd you figure me out?!
---
Also, research 1 handed wow players. There have to be a few notable ones out there.
---
I have no experience myself with classic paladin past level 28. I would think though that it shouldn't be any problem being ret and healing non endgame dungeons.
---
 Played a lot of feral druid and should be pretty similar. As feral you can heal fine up until BRD at least. You just need to have a +int gearswap set and some mana potions as backup.
---
I was thinking classic macros would run on the same set of commands as retail, since it's built on the retail engine.
---
So can someone clear this up for me: How much hit does a Swords spec Human need? The racial bonus is 3% effective from what I've heard, the Precision talent is 5%, and isn't Weapon Expertise Talent another 3%?
---
interesting...
---
We can't have nice things because all the kids can't play nice together
---
10 days/played seems pretty excessive. I was around 7.5/played as a stupid 13 year old back in the day.
---
Classic wasn't exactly great for diversity in builds or playstyles. It's not even just stats (although that didn't help), but fundamentally missing abilities and mechanics that weren't really part of the game until they changed classes significantly with BC.
---
There's a limit to how much they're going to be able to play around with the same handful of stats (and Classic has fewer stats to play with in the first place.)
---
Cum? That escalated quickly.
---
There's a high chance that 1) vanilla will have MANY hardcore minded people playing, 2) a higher requirement of a poll (80%+) makes it so that the casual players could not overwhelm hardcore players in the decision process.  
---
That, and we already know where many choices lead.  We can see this because we already made a set of choices that led to retail.  We can now think things through with more examples.
---
Try Grobbulus. Its a RPPvP server. Going to be fun.
---
unless this was a lie amd they actually do have a few tricks up their sleeve but can't tell us right now because that would ruin the effect :P
---
herod is the horde server
---
THE RACE TO WF IS 14 YEARS TOO LATE
---
This isn't the whole truth.  You want them to *not* say anything negative about what you feel is an accomplishment.  You are asking them to be quiet and not express their opinion if their opinion doesn't support you.  Their opinion isn't any less valid than yours just because you don't agree with it, and they shouldn't be forced into silence just because you don't like what they have to say.
---
Look at oldschool runescape has 3x the player base as rs3 this is be the exact same for wow classic upto atleast phase 6 and dependent on how they go about updates either they do same sort of polling system as osrs or create new expansions with the help of devoted players wow classic will have a long and healthy life just like osrs
---
vanilla brain activated
---
Im sorry that i don't personally know multiple people per vanilla class so that the quick, for fun noobie guides can be up to your personal standard of depth. If anything that seems like it would lead to even more bias than simply reasearching the general consnesus on classes. 
---
But hey, please continue to be a complete dick to someone just trying to do something fun for the community because you disagree with a rating that absolutely no one can confirm, considering no one has played the game for 15 years. Im sure your just a blast at parties
---
haha we used to intentionally do this to piss of the GL , it was all cool we only did it on stuff like geddon and try to kill the most with bombs.
---
Although I intentionally took agro on patchwerk once, as a shaman and pushed the healers to the max-core. Didn't die either! 
---
This was also a good way to get guild kicked if you fucked around on a hardcore day or progression raid.
---
Dear MJ aka Alliance Scum, you should avoid world pvp. - The Horde
---
You honestly think Skeram won’t be just as full?
---
If you want to know what you'll look like with this gear: https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#sz0V0zJ89cckRqc9m8cYZ808cXI808c4Q808mbM87kcq5808mqW808cxs808cyU808cte808ctC87c
---
Skeletons are not a core gameplay component. No amount of kicking and screaming is change that fact. At the absolute most, it’s a fringe QoL piece. It very minimally affects immersion and frankly, I wouldn’t have even noticed they were missing.
---
Their answer this in the AMA was literally, we can't because there's potential that people will be offended...
---
This guy heals.
---
Oh... I'm not sure how much I trust that data :/
---
I thought dutch were tall?
---
Yeah. So wait as a ghost for a couple min, swap layers, avoid pvp.
---
Lol, no one there has any chance other than that 1 guy that is from progress
---
It's just bullshit that developed on the private servers from dudes who haven't played anything else in like 10 years. They exhausted all the normal ways of playing the game and having fun so they developed this speed running meta thing to stay interested. Speed running is really one of the only reasons you'd put in the retarded amount of time to stay fully buffed with every consumable and shit every raid night.
---
I’ll be 7 next month
---
Im all about WoW, I always played horde, but a huge epic world of fantasy, I never understood people that played human, why would you want to just be some dude lol. Im sure human has a lot of memories for people, but I never understood it.
---
Fuck ajit pai
---
how about grow some thicker skin since words hurt you so much to the point you want to change how a video game is played.

I don't know what the demographics of Everquest would have been like but in WoW there was always at least 1 guild on the server that was a known harbor for trolls. I played EvE Online in 2008 and a commonly used strategy was universally called a "rape cage", the largest organization in the game had 30,000 members and was famous for lying to non-members about recruiting them for a chance to rob them blind which was officially sanctioned by their leadership, and one of the clans founded by Reddit users with 10,000 members was "I whip my slaves back and forth" to make fun of the Willow Smith song. I don't know about Quake either but I played Halo 2 in 2003 and heard constant abusive talk. If someone sounded black and someone was angry they would certainly have been called the n-word. Games like Runescape had so many players that could hop worlds whenever they wanted that no such consequences would be found for being abusive. I remember being ninja looted in WoW during TBC in the 40ish range and the guy who did it got me kicked from a later group. I played an extremely obscure MMOFPS in 2003 called Endless Ages, and I was targeted for griefing because it was known I was very young despite the community having an even smaller community than Everquest.
---
One of the reasons I'm playing Classic is that I won't have to put up with the half the Horde being flouncy little elves. It would absolutely be more than a cosmetic difference.
---
lol my point is just that restokitty is very doable. you don't need greater movement speed to do it, and besides, I pointed out predatory strikes (which implies getting speedykitty). Not sure how I upset you, but it wasn't my intent.
---
General advice from other guides on this is to level as Ret talent spec, cache a separate set of healing gear (int/sp/+heal, any armor type), downrank healing spells to conserve mana/not overheal, beg friends to CC groups and not break said CC too early, and have some food/drinks handy
---
GotDAYUMMM
---
RP just means role-playing ofc, on both RP and RPPvP you're meant to be in character like you would in dungeons and dragons, normal rp server is usually a bit more hardcore, and RPpvp is usually more casual with focus on world pvp. A lot of people come to rp pvp realms for a '' more mature '' pvp experience, generally a lot less campers and griefers and more event based stuff
---
Get leather and cloth items. Keep both in your bags. Switch to cloth on all raid bosses, leather on raid trash + dungeons + PvP + everything else. Never know when you might need to take a few hits in bear form.
---
He literally posted a link that shows that file is safe (when checked by 67 different AV softwares) so i do not think he has anything to worry about.
---
NICE!
---
Awesome man. It's great to have something tangible to remember it all by too, our guild site is long gone.
---
Yes, I agree. Unreal Tournament is amazing too.
---
I'm not asking for people to care, I'm asking for those who don't care to just stay out of it, and for those who think that the argument in the title of this submission is a legitimate argument, to stop using it.

Yeah. The kid misbehaving does, not every kid in the neighborhood.
---
My high school had a webmaster role that passed down from senior to senior.
---
There were comments for upwards of 7 years, heart felt signoff messages from each senior before they logged out for the last time.
---
You could still read it in the HTML years after you graduated, and was a really cool little Easter egg we would commiserate on.
---
That is, until the website was taken over by the town administration and wiped it out. 
---
I would love to have that html again. All the terrible marquees included.
---
Call me a gay nerd but I could not care less about this change.
---
Yep, vanilla was always about account-sharing.
---
I'd love to see the stats on the amount of R14 who account shared.
---
It will be even more of a requirement with bigger servers

Doesn't look like they plan on changing it!
---
dont think its going to change , content unlocks not patches
---
they 100% will lol
---
Man reading this stuff makes me want Classic+ instead of TBC even more. Being able to wipe threat from allies as a Priest or feign death as a Druid sounds incredible (feign death to drop combat reenter stealth swap active trinkets then apply another pounce stun)
---
you don't have to have sympathy, it's just a fact this is happened. Most GIRLS on the internet are Guys In Real Life did no one tell you that? ;)
---
PvP - You only automatically flag in enemy territory. You can flag yourself for PvP but it's entirely optional. You won't be attacked during PvE raids except for world bosses like Kazzak, Azuregos, and 4 Dragons.
---
PvP - Opposite, you automatically flag outside your faction's territory, and can be attacked pretty much anywhere outside of 1-15/20 zones.
---
RP/RPPVP have similar rules as above, with added Roleplaying rules pertaining to things like having a lore friendly character name, not disrupting other players' roleplay, and not talking about things in /say or /yell that wouldn't make sense in Warcraft context.
---
That is the most california thing I've ever heard
---
Lol no one wants to spell anything. We just want to see a huge sea of skeletons after a big battle or a long gank. That's it. The skeletons warn you that something's up.
---
That wouldn't be in line with the CE pet decision, though.
---
I dont remember. It was 14 years ago
---
This here is a guy who went through some tough times on a PvP server
---
First rare was a Deanship Claymore that I couldn't sell, dropped off a croc in wetlands.
---
First epic was a Lei of Lillies off a trash mob in Sunken Temple.
---
Yes, I said that. Read my post again. I hope they ban chat too considering gold sellers will be exploiting that medium to advertise. And this is easily fixed by randomizing the skeleton location to within 5 yards of any direction of your corpse.
---
God I did this all the time I'm such a scumbag healer
---
Fun fact: when you have Atiesh equipped in Karazhan at the Shade of Aran event, he exclaims "Where did you get that? Did *he* send you?"  
---
I actually didn't know that wasn't a standard line of dialogue for Aran until I cleared it on my alt.  
---
Atiesh kind of feels like the wooden chalice in the Raiders of the Lost Ark -- unassuming but powerful. Also only available at the end game, when others are doomed to die.
---
Very nice
---
That, or slightly randomise the corpse/skeleton spot (e.g. 5-10 yards), and randomise the orientation of the body.
---
Almost all of the abuses involving corpses and skeletons, come down to placement that's just too precise. Take that precision away, and it can't be exploited in any meaningful way.
---
so probably super late / necro, but I really want to see the rest of the data from P3 on.  I can assemble and play with it myself.
---
The CSV link doesn't work either :(
---
Gratz! I feel you.
---
I keep getting anxiety when a new PvP realm opens. I delete a char on another just for a chance.
---
Luckily I have got my name 3/3slots and 5/5 attempts.
---
I'm not a dude, I never claimed to be smart, and I can't even with you.
---
I believe under net neutrality that Disney would still pay more for more traffic, if you're objectively using more bandwidth they are allowed to charge more to Disney.
---
That joke is like 20 years old by now and exhausting, but I appreciate the attempt at humor. ;p
---
Censorship is ruining everything. Soon they will remove chat cause someone might say something that slightly offends someone. Deal with racism or whatever as it happens.....
---
You're already automatically wrong because nochanges doesn't even exist in any form at all. Classic is already VERY far from vanilla, because "nochanges" never meant no actual changes to the game. It meant no changes to the spirit of the game as it used to exist.
---
1.12 is NOTHING like 1.0.
---
But it's an arguably better version of the game.
---
The war effort should not be something that is over in an hour of hand ins.  The spirit of the game was that it was a lengthy effort between everyone on the server.
---
The way you’re over reacting to this makes me think you were barely a speck in your Dads nuts when classic was out... 
---
This has no significant baring on world pvp whatsoever. 
---
Banning everyone who tries to do it.. how exactly is that a remotely effective use of &lt;GM&gt; time combing through potentially thousands of reports... 
---
Get a grip.
---
Play a rogue , they’re always needed and honestly every poll I see there down in picked class. Arguably best pve and PvP class overall
---
PVP -&gt; U can attack enemy when you see them. You will die alot while trying to lvl but it makes the game way more exciting.  
---
Normal (PVE) - &gt; Get to 60 faster. Easier time lvling, no world pvp, chill vibes all around. (cant remember if you can flag yourself for PVP for 10 minutes in Vanilla. In which case u can still do some pvp here and there, if they attack you first. or they are also flagged for pvp) These realms are for Raiding with 40 men mostly, so more towards PVE content.  
---
RP -&gt; Just good old fun. Roleplay your heart out. These realms are strictly good vibes with naked ladies and no PVP, unless flag option is available. You have to speak to people as if your are in character or at least behave properly cause other people are making stories.   
---
RP-PVP -&gt; Best of both worlds, pvp struggles while lvling and people making weird stories, but the option is less populair so as well as with RP, this is for niche players, thats why you will only find one of each on every realm list.
---
Yeah apparently you didn't witness gold seller spam with corpses before 2010.
---
Haha, sniping a spirit tap proc with mind blast is an amazing tip. I thought it'd be completely useless in dungeons.
---
Play a pvp server. It may seem like a bother getting killed while you level but with layering etc it should not be as bad as it originally was. Some of the most fun I've ever had in the game was world pvp. It adds a whole layer of things you can do.

I have actually. It’s really nice too, you can’t go wrong with either. Just personal preference I love the 144hz...it’s so damn smooth. And the resolution is still high enough to look amazing. For me, I just struggled to consistently hit 4K @60 on every game.
---
There are many more douches on the internet today then there was 2004. People are going to be doing stupid things just accept that Blizzard doesn't want controversy to something thats not in their control (players being idiots)
---
My work has hit bottlenecks where I need someone else to do a task or wait for a 5+ hour process to run. Of course next week it'll all run perfect and I'll have less downtime.
---
troll my dude
---
They cant do that without fixing the problem from before...  Which they're likely not going to do, so no thx.
---
When people are complaining about something as dumb as skeletons a week before release I'd say the team did a pretty good job.
---
can u name more than 10 quests in wrath that phase you out tho? wasnt cata the point where realm identity was lost with all the new phasing quests and marging servers? or mop? dont think it was wotlk
---
This isn't normal but on Method it is
---
Orc if fury tank
---
Tauren if Prot tank
---
The health boost is only around 250 health.  Roll orc if that's what you prefer.
---
Probably cause you've never played vanilla at a semi-hardcore level.
---
Questie is the only addon you need.
---
Krol blade here.
---
does it really matter? the total amount is still the same
---
Hint: The milk expires on release day.
---
I remember mine... it was Edgmasters Handguards on a hunter. Dropped for my Maraudon group and nobody wanted them, so I ended up needing/equipping then selling them afterwards because they didn't have any agility. 
---
Whoops.
---
What we need to do is ban campfires! They can make crude things on the ground as well! And delete that quest in WoD where you can draw with the fuse for the TNT!
---
I quit in 09 but I'm almost certain I never saw that. Would been kinda neat, actually.
---
Is this wow free
---
Pick a pvp server for some of the most fun you will ever have.
---
\&gt;Retail players arguing that Classic is too easy and a waste of time for top Retail guilds. 
---
Those two things aren't mutually inclusive. It isn't a waste of time as long as it has a following and gets people to watch Method streams. Many times sponsorships are to an org, not a team. They have a monetary reason to do it, but that doesn't change the fact that it isn't difficult content.
---
They estimated it'll take them 11 days from launch to be leveled, attuned, and clear the raid. That's far from difficult when you consider a majority of the time is spent outside of the raid. In fact, it won't even interfere with their retail race.
---
We aren’t undead... we are FORSAKEN!!
---
:)
---
Haha this doesn’t help! I like troll too. What’s their racial? Berserk? Can’t remember.
---
Add corpses to rightclick reporting and just ban the accounts.  Seems like the economic incentive to do it will fade pretty quickly.
---
You can tank early on with a 2H just fine. The only reason to go sword and board before level 40 is if you're getting your ass kicked.
---
Troll has the best animations, hairstyles, dance and tusks. This is a no-brainer to me
---
All addons should be banned.
---
Nobody can predict your potential fun
---
I don't really care that much about it, but it does seem hypocritical considering that they answered several other questions with #nochanges.
---
That's the question, if it wasn't easily doable then they could have at least told us what's preventing this solution.
---
Disabling skeletons completely now just looks lazy and wrong.
---
I sure hope those gold sellers don't pick up the cooking profession and drop campfires...
---
What he is saying is true for the most part. Let's say you and I link up in deathknell day one and quest together all night. You log off but i play another 2 hours. I choose to go to silverpine, you go to barrens. I play more and am level 30 while you are 20. So on and so forth. The chance of seeing the same people over and over is low, and was even in vanilla. I made friends and leveled with them regularly, but we grouped. Which is still possible!
---
You can just ignore gold sellers in chat, not even close to the same thing. But I don't disagree, the random skele is a good idea if they care enough to spend the time to code it. 
---
I just wanted to point out that your original comment was partially wrong, and it's not just a PC thing, as much as you clearly want it to be.
---
But if you have the rig for it, and prefer resolution to refresh rate, you won’t be disappointed.
---
Know how mp5 works.
---
It'll help to also have the addon to automatically track quests.
---
I didn’t notice until reading how much each stat increased when I levelled. 2 int, 1 stam... blah blah  “You gained a talent point.”
---
Wait what. 
---
I got laughed at pretty hard when I asked what they were.
---
Lol i hear ya
---
Please does any one knows in what server he will play?!
---
&gt; CE pet decision
---
Can you explain what that decision is? I'm not aware of it.  
---
When I mentioned classic exclusive codes, I mean code that can only be used on classic that doesn't affect retail.
---
 Female Tauren are the cutest Horde race. Change my mind.
---
Getting corpse camped by a level 60 for 5 weeks and realizing that pvp servers are only fun in the beginning.
---
This is a dumber complaint than the name change for the nicker, impressive really
---
They only answered the questions they had good answers too. Many other questions they just danced around.
---
Tell me, will trading gold from bfa to classic be allowed? Let's assume I don't have the ToS memorized. How about a straight yes or no answer?
---
Is it okay for me to use a RMT to buy a wow token, trade that for bfa gold, and then trade that gold for classic gold? Is this blizzard sanctioned gold buying in classic?
---
Remove the ability to comment on fb, reddit youtube etc and make it so you can only "respond" with smiles and rainbows while you are at it.
---
*nice*
---
You just made me feel old, thanks!
---
Grob mob!
---
When you lack the guts to tell somebody something, vague call out post it is
---
You should probably look up on google images some of the Method streamers listed if you think they are physically inactive.
---
I’m all for supporting people getting their hustle on and if he’s making money, I’m happy for him.  But, do people actually pay money just to learn how to level a character, the most basic part of any RPG?
---
If you’re a thoughtful dude or madam looking to make new buddies, I’ll be on Grob too! 😁
---
I expect it regardless. Always did.. 
---
Still doesn't bother me tbh.. was fun to make messages but such is life, i'll get over it I'm sure ;)
---
It just came off as a rant the way it was written I guess, at least that's how I (and probably others) interpreted it, it's hard over text you know :)
---
Wtf are you on about srsly. It's launch day/week hype. Everyone knows exactly what to expect. It'll just be fun having a community following people poopsocking to 60 and clearing MC first week.  
---
  
---
All the nerfs/changes are completely irrelevant. If they remade it exactly with all the shitty items/talents/mechanics it would slow down a rag kill like 12 hours at absolute most. No one cares.
---
&gt; That's pretty much how games die when there's no way for the average player to even start raiding.
---
ok?  Games also die for people by constantly changing, do you not understand that's what happened in retail already for a number of people?  You don't give a shit about those people though...you just give a shit about yourself, even though your own personal favorite style of game progression is already being done in retail.  You're wanting to kill a game for some people in order to keep it alive for yourself, when there is already a version of the game for people who think like you do. 
---
Stay away from classic if that's the way you think.  Don't ruin it **again**
---
There’s better quality guides out there. His routes aren’t even the fastest.
---
Yes, cause this is what is important......skeletons.
---
+1
---
Entitlement.
---
I'm well aware of why they didn't do it, since stacking multiple Ironforges on top of one another is such a monumental task for launch WoW to have been able to handle. Didn't mean to imply it was dev "laziness" or something petty lol.  
---
But I agree, they could do whatever they want now. Boralus and Zuldazar are essentially zones in and of themselves, so there's no telling what they could do with Classic stuff.
---
Though, if they were to do it, it should be done in the hypothetical "Classic+" way that people are hypothesizing. Some people just want to stick to regular Classic forever and that's fine, shouldn't try and mess with them.
---
Get in the new servers early if you want to play. People will log onto their "main" server, see a queue, and might try one or two other servers to see before settling on one of the newer ones that might be medium/high by release. If you go for them off the bat you should beat the rush.
---
You're a gay nerd.
---
Me too brother, me too. Classic is about the journey.
---
I've been debating this for MONTHS... and still undecided. I am taking all three roles (Tanking, PvP, PvE dps) into consideration because I enjoy all three. Let me know if I've missed anything important worth mentioning. Here is my analysis for Tauren in order of most important to least important: 
---
* Male Tauren Only: Extra 3 yards melee range I think. Huge deal. This makes it way harder to kite, deadzone, or escape from Tauren. It is excellent for tanks too. For example, it increases your taunt range by that amount as well. However, does not increase range of shouts.
---
* 5% HP is better than most people give it credit for. It cannot simply be boiled down to, “it is only useful if my health drops below 5%”. If you take a big 2k crit from a boss, and you have 2100 health as a Tauren, you live. Any other race dies. Having a phat fucking health bar also makes you as a tank, and your raid / group feel more confident and gives healers a little more leeway when healing you.
---
* War Stomp is killer utility for dungeons and some raid trash (like ZG for example), and also wrecks in PvP. Tauren are debatably the strongest race vs. for healers in PvP with the combination of MS and War Stomp to interrupt heals when Pummel is on CD. Unfortunately, War Stomp resets the swing timer, so you take a slight dps loss when using it.
---
* If you go herb/alchemy, they get the +15 skill to herb, which is a nice bonus. This is a common tradeskill combo for raid tanks, since consumes are massively important for the tank.
---
* 10 Nature resist. Nice bonus to have for AQ. Also occasionally causes Nature spells to resist in PvP, most notably, Roots.
---
* Tauren lack the passive +5 weapon skill that Orcs and Humans have. Look into dagger +skill items and dagger tanking. Mugger’s Belt, and Aged Core Leather Gloves are good items to raise your skill to 305. (You lose a bit of armor, but if you restrict your tank set to just one leather piece, it won’t be an issue). When using a dagger, Aged Core Leather gloves are the best gloves for threat in the game.
---
* Aesthetically, being a giant Minotaur gives you a sense of power and authority when tanking in raids that isn’t quite the same when playing an Orc. Tauren is the ultimate alpha-chad race.
---
But a very close copy of those times. It will be different but also very similar.
---
Most guilds, sure, but Naxx will fall really quickly for many guilds once it's released. Top guilds will have everyone itemized to the teeth before it drops. They can also really easily practice and prep for the fight (private servers) if they're not already from pservers already.
---
This video is oddly close to one I made 7 years ago in the dota 2 beta haha!
---
[reference for fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HpbIpaIZMs)
---
Yes Blizzard has confirmed that there will be a couple hour queues on most realms.
---
I remember my first time exploring the Barren and coming across a field of bones.  Turns out this was near the WSG entrance and borders Alliance territory.  Avoided it until I got stronger and more comfortable.  Went in and kicked ass when I saw it.
---
Literally a lot of people.
---
How'd the rogue blind the hunter, and the pet at the same time?
---
RIP
---
Once upon a time I used to have write pain, too.  I want to second this.  I have a razer naga chroma and it’s the best mouse I’ve found so far in part because it’s fairly large so i don’t have to scrunch my hand into a tense shape.
---
The other great peripheral is any Microsoft ergo keyboard.  They completely eliminated my wrist pain.  I particularly like the fact that the keys slope down as they move away from me.  That’s critical for not kinking my wrists.
---
Unfortunately i still have some pain, but at least not also at the wrists.  We’ll see how long i last in classic...
---
I’m not in a rush. I’m going to enjoy it and make some gold along the way.
---
Depends on your ui. I spent 3 hours during the stress test just setting up add-ons.

---
Soooo, I was gonna make an addon, my first ever, that would combine the "Vendor Price" addon and this data table, showing what you'll probably get and its value, but I realized I don't know what I'm doing and I'm not ready to learn a new programing language 5 days out from classic release.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That being said, if there are any addon gods out there that know what they're doing and want to do a collab, hit me up. I'd love to do a profession addon for classic that helps you collect all the recipes and adds functionality to disenchanting and such.
---
Dwarf or Human warrior for me. I love Dwarves, they are my spirit animals. But those Human racials...
---
Amazing!
---
I'm pretty sure the ability to skeleton spam was removed from retail before the recent trend of using racial slurs to be "edgy" existed, so perhaps many people weren't given the opportunity to use skeletons to their fullest potential, but don't think for a second they wouldn't abuse it if it was there.
---
I've seen skeletons used to paste penises all over major cities on RP realms, just because some PvP tourists popped in to take the piss. I don't RP and I had a decent chuckle at the first one I saw, but around the time I saw the 7th one I realised that Blizzard were basically forced to soft reset the server to get rid of them.
---
Dude why are you posting under every comment in this thread. If you don't want this in the game, you only need to say it once and move on. Or ya know. Ignore it.
---
Not only that, but phase 2 wont be for 3+ months and phase 3 won't be until 2020 lol
---
Why are some people making a big deal about this?  So one person can't have multiple skeletons laying around, so what?
---
Big fights will still be obvious as there will still be skeletons on the ground, and your skeleton won't disappear when you res, it just vanishes when you die again.
---
People complaining about this are doing so because there is nothing else to complain about.
---
You’ll benefit from some good decompression playing a few hours here and there.  Go gently and without regret. I am. I’m taking time off at my defense intel job for a couple qjjy

Looking to trade the name Jerk on Herod for Jerk on Stalagg.
---
Ziz's only weakness is that he cant read. Thankfully Spell Reflect was added in TBC so he'll be great for Vanilla.
---
Seriously though the guy is a grinding machine. They need over 40 people so it makes sense to use him considering he's already apart of Method. This is more about having an event that attracts viewers than it is about winning though they'll certainly try to. They're not oblivious to the fact that they're behind on experience.
---
Wow classic isn’t released yet. You played vanilla. Different game bud
---
But rises again harder and stronger
---
Imagine being this insecure about your masculinity lol
---
Haha that’s awesome! I remember it was at the crossroads in the barrens. It happened to an undead warlock he kept abusing the gm. Then boing he went
---
Where you playing on Dragonmaw or Frostmane? I was in a Guild &lt;Civilian&gt; with Strafbomber and Proxima, my little warrior was so jealus over their rank 14 gear :-D
---
How cool is it to get to play with one of the original 3 devs? Seems like a dream come true to me
---
Plus, people are better and most of us aren't likely to be clickers, which means faster button presses and a different playstyle + being a bit more efficient.
---
I got my Epic Mount by pickpocketing the Arena and Bar while waiting to form EmpRun groups :)
---
Okay, that’s legit! 😋
---
Well.
---
Horde females kinda look like shit
---
They have said they are going with the cheap training expensive mount system for Classic with no indication that will ever change.
---
As hard as it is right now in classic. Keep it that way and never make it simpler or easier.
---
What's it like to have negative karma?
---
No one is expecting a challenge for dedicated players from these raids, this was known when 1.12 base was confirmed with no custom raid scaling years ago. The challenge lies in time spent.
---
I don't understand why you consider this event a "passive-agressive attack"?
---
This is why I'm playing druid. all that sweet sweet mobility for that long leveling experience
---
Most? Select few i thought. Maybe they only mentioned exessive queues
---
Feel free to recommend others.
---
The question was a joke honestly.  But what do they do? I never played Vanilla.  But have pretty good knowledge of the game. Will the books help? Or just for nostalgia?
---
Sure thing. Right after these esports organization actually have to follow moderation rules with their forum manipulation and blatant advertising like this. How stupid does Method think people are?
---

---
Watching this get a "miracle" influx of 100 upvotes like this advertising post got. The comments are almost all negative about this, the upvote score was negative and then a MIRACLE happened.

---
The forum moderation here is disgusting with he favoritism showed towards certain streamers and organizations. This is like their personal reddit now. This is why content creators (who are moderators here) shouldn't be allowed to have control of a Blizzard IP. They are looking to make connections or friends for profits. They are just as unethical as Method.
---
Big thanks to Blizzard for robbing us of skeletons to save me from potentially seeing some naughty words, fortunately there's no other way to exchange words with people in WoW so this really nails that problem down for us.
---
True, I guess it depends on what you enjoy doing.
---
The issue this change supposedly addresses isn't even solved by it, the main reason given players can spell bad words with skeletons, they can do the same thing with player corpses that will stay there until you run back to your body and res. If player bodies in the world aren't changed at all I fail to see how this solves the problem of spelling bad words, people will do it with their bodies before they res. Personally I've seen more advertisements spelled this way, I mean if the whole body is there it will never disappear until you res, this would just be a better way of advertising than the skeletons left behind. Very weird change that just seems unnecessary.
---
Once you are in though 18 hour stint boys
---
And get this, BWL doesn't come out until phase 3. No new raid content in phase 2.
---
Granted, phase 2 does bring the honor system and no battlegrounds, so high level leveling zones will become a camped bloodbath...
---
Links?
---
As a soon to be hunter main, I want to thank you for all the hard work you and the team has done to re-create them!
---
I would totally bring a shadow priest. Fort buff, Vampiric Embrace and eventually shadow weaving (if there is a warlock) are all great in 5 mans
---
Most have been before my time although I rarely checked the forums back then.  Sounds interesting
---
From my experience tanking they do not.
---
You know what the he means asshole

holy fuck you are mad online

From the depths of my soul thank you.

FOR THE HERD!
---
This week is insanely busy and my team is operating at like 1/4 strength due to traveling. So my days have been going pretty quick luckily, what’s going to be slow is this weekend and then Monday being at work waiting for the hours to tick by for me to get home.
---
@spearmints i made an effort to accommodate your requirements!
---
Yeah, I'm tempted to do it just to make my life easier in the future. First few hours of classic is going to be chaos anyway
---
45 whole minutes? bruh
---
I think Classic is Coke and Retail is Pepsi. Pepsi is sweeter, in blind taste tests, people prefer Pepsi, when they're taking sips. Coke, having a more complex and less sweet flavor, is the drink you can have back to back to back.
---
I have started to book meeting rooms 12-1 through the next several weeks to be able to sit in a quiet room to play WoW classic.
---
Got to keep people playing somehow
---
There won’t be any lack of level 60s that’s for damn sure
---
It doesn't go away when you res, it goes away when you die AGAIN.
---
Stop spreading misinformation and trying to make something out of nothing.
---
🥰
---
They'll add new servers when the servers they have added fill up.
---
[HEAVILY disagree](https://i.imgur.com/4ZpTQH8.jpg)
---
Why are people spreading the word on this?
---
Nostromo and the similar ergo pads work great.  I strongly recommend the Microsoft ergo keyboards.  They have tended to be the best for my wrists and hands, but they do take a little training to get used to.  They’ve totally spoiled me for any other keyboard.
---
this is the main reason i want to play hunter just so i can laugh at the rogues ganking me.. ofcourse then when they still kill me despite me picking my class just to beat them will probably be the new worst feeling in classic
---
Simple yet detailed and relevant.

Good work fellas.
---
Surely the "normal" server in a game called World of **War**Craft would be a PvP server?
---
the player "gets good" rather than the content and accessibility "gets easy"
---
its ok if people dont complete everything too
---
there are a lot of different players , not everyone needs to complete everything in the game
---
these things come to mind
---
got my names, so I hope so!
---
Especially at the Inn in Goldshire.
---
BfA isn't Classic, Classic will be very different from what Method knows. It's not their ballgame.
---
Anyone got an alternative? I wanted to mess with my UI before launch. Like a lot of others I think.
---
Well, according to the AMA it seems like the queues top out at some point and it just plain rejects people. So going by that it seems like the 10-12k we saw for the first name reservations might be the top end.
---
That....actually sounds kinda rough lol
---
That makes no sense at all, a skeleton doesn't ever appear UNTIL you res.
---
Hard to take these pointless pickets seriously when you don't even know what's up
---
Hell yeah! Ty!!
---
Mage for sick dps in pve/pvp, free food and drinks and portals. Priest if you want to heal
---
We could play against each other
---
The entirety of the world is useful. Low level items are useful, the world is whole and one as opposed to each expansion creating irrelevant content.
---
Thanks for the tip friend
---
Here is the question:
---
&gt;Q: What is the stance on people trading gold from Classic realms for gold on BfA realms and vice versa? I hope this will not only be an unsupported trade, but actually against rules and a bannable offense. If people can trade gold between the two versions of the game, then they can still effectively buy gold by selling a WoW token on BfA servers and then trading the gold.
---
Here is their answer in regards to trading gold from bfa to retail. The question also brought up using real money to buy wow tokens and then trading that for gold, they completely failed to acknowledge that, so let's just move past it. 
---
&gt;A:There is no direct means for characters in BfA to transfer gold to characters in WoW Classic. This would be highly disruptive for Classic as the economies of these two games are very different.
---
&gt;Gold exchange between players in WoW is subject to our terms of service. Purchase of gold from 3rd parties could lead to suspension or banning of accounts.
---
Would you classify that answer as vague or direct? Let's break it down with the question in mind.
---
&gt;There is no direct means for characters in Bfa to transfer gold to characters in WoW Classic.
---
Okay great, that has nothing to do with the question, he wasn't asking if there was a direct way.
---
&gt;This would be highly disruptive for Classic as the economies of these two games are very different.
---
I'm sure we can all agree with this, but still not addressing the question.
---
&gt;Gold exchange between players in WoW is subject to our terms of service.
---
Okay, and? I don't have the ToS memorized, how about actually quoting the ToS, is there a part that says if you trade gold between different games is a bannable offence? Is blizzard actively looking to catch players who do this and give them the banhammer?
---
This is what we need an answer on, not just a vague reference to the ToS.
---
&gt;Purchase of gold from 3rd parties could lead to suspension or banning of accounts.
---
Well of course, that would mean other people are making money off blizz. So does this mean that player 2 player gold selling is perfectly fine? Just as long as we don't use a 3rd party?
---

---
BTW corporations like Sony, MS and others pay huge fines for this often. If you think a laughable, failing esports organization like Method is immune I got some really bad news for you.
---
Hahaha! That's a horde attitude for sure.
---
You'll be sure to find me walking around in the aftermath resureccting those slain and healing those who survived so you will always have a citit's ready to meet you in battle.
---
This is exactly like the guy that sat on the stage and said "You think you want to look for a group but what you really want to do is push a button and be in the dungeon."
---
This hurts retail how?
---
The more popular classic is, the more popular this rebooted content is, both with players in Esports, the more impetus blizzard will have to release the expansions that come after. And we will go through it all again.
---
At some point in the next two or three or five or 10 years, folks will stop referring to this as classic versus retail and just call it all wow. And they won't feel like lumping them together is somehow an insult to one of them. They're both going to the same place after all.
---
This is what I want.  Not an expansion.  A continuation....
---
Nah, saying "no" means they don't exist at all and is just an exaggerated title that is factually incorrect. It's fear mongering and doesn't promote good discussion. 
---
In no way did Blizzard say "No skeletons" and OP even quoted it directly in the post...
---
I agree I would most likely bounce!
---
Hell yeah.  Thunderlord was my server.  Kali Swarm for life!
---
The devs estimated several hours so anywhere from 4+ probably on Herod
---
Here is my analysis of Orc now. Orcs have fewer objective areas to look at, but each one is more impactful:
---
* Let's talk about Hardiness. The most OP racial in the game, primarily when it comes to PvP. It's still awesome for tanking, because being stunned as a tank is always bad news. Orc’s 25% passive stun resist adds on top of the base resist of 5%, so they get 30% total (I believe, 99% sure). The unpredictability of it, and the fact that it’s passive (always active) is overpowered, and really messes up the math for classes and specs that rely on stuns. Here’s a list of things that it screws up in PvP:
---
   * Rogue: Cheap Shot, Kidney Shot, Mace spec stun
---
   * Paladin: HoJ
---
   * Warrior: Charge, Intercept, Mace spec stun
---
   * Druid: Bash, Pounce
---
   * Shadowpriest: Blackout procs
---
   * Fire Mage: Impact procs
---
   * Engineering grenades (These are going to be big in Classic, due to the PServer meta that will migrate over)
---
   * Tidal Charm trinket
---
   * Unstoppable force proc
---
   * Warstomp (duels) 
---
* \+5 Axe Skill. Another big boy heavy hitter for the Orcs. This reduces your chance to hit level 63 boss mobs from 9% down to 6% when using axes, allowing you to prioritize crit and other stats sooner, and giving you more options with gearing. In a way you may feel restricted to axes, but tbh, you can still use all the other weapons just as well as any other race. It also improves the damage your glancing blows (40% of all white hits on lvl 63 bosses) deal from a 35% reduction, down to a 15% reduction. A 20% improvement on 40% of your is an 8% dps increase on white attacks. This is a big deal to both DPS warriors, and tanking because the threat difference is significant.
---
* Blood Fury. Obviously awesome for DPS and PvP. Increases your AP based on your base strength by 25%, so if you stack strength through the roof, this can be really OP. Murders in PvP, and using it on cooldown in raids allows Orcs to out dps all other Horde warriors. HOWEVER, it is almost useless for tanking because of the debuff. In some encounters where mind control exists (like the Hakkar fight), Blood Fury will be popped right away, outside of your control. This will make it really hard to heal you for the next 25 seconds. I recommend getting a different tank for those encounters. I don't have a list, but there are a few. Not enough to not be a great raid tank though.
---
* Orcs are also pretty alpha-chad, cosmetically. Second most in the game, next to Tauren. Don't worry about their hunch. It's just bad posture from years of deadlifting. Females are cool too. You could grind human skulls to dust on those rock hard abs.
---
Nah the internet is more restricted now than it was back then.
---
Hey! Thanks for your input! It's more of a limit based on making sure we have room for everyone who wants to join. I have a hard time balancing my gaming time and other aspect of life at times. So it's actually not a bad thing for me to try and impose some boundaries for myself.
---
So is their going to be a q like 3 hours before launch to get into character creation?
---
Thanks for the heads up, clearly you cant save everyone so if people insist you are a liar at least you did your due diligence warning the people and provided receipts.
---
Damn bro you tryna get yoked
---
I really want post 60 content, but in the same sort of old design style that classic has, until we've exhausted the pre TBC+ lore up to that point. I'd ALSO like it to look as good as live, but i doubt that'll happen.
---
As in 4k?
---
There is no way those servers will fill up, its not like only small percent of classic playerbase bought sub to reserve name,better dont roll those dead servers!

Orc’s 25% passive stun resist adds on top of the base resist of 5%, so they get 30% total (I believe, 99% sure). The unpredictability of it, and the fact that it’s passive (always active) is overpowered, and really messes up the math for classes and specs that rely on stuns. Here’s a list of things that it screws up in PvP:  
---
   * Warstomp (duels)
---
Yep.
---
ITT and OP: Kids who don't understand anything.
---
We can't have nice things because people with nothing better to do feign outrage over the slightest 'offense.'
---
I found the guy that believes streamers have a priority.
---
People that don't have much to complain about will find something to complain about because they have nothing else to do.
---
If you really cared for them to hear what you have to say you would link their names and summon them forth, LOL
---
But then you might end up having 8 different debates going on at the same time in this thread instead of that thread.
---
Is that a Nightwish  song?
---
No witty reply? HIT THAT REPORT BUTTON (cus I sure as hell am reporting this reddit and Method to the Federal Trade Commission).
---
Sigh. It's like the wall of no all over again. PLEASE YES!
---
haha, it's not priority, their fans just saved them a spot at the front of the queue!
---
I won’t be watching this shit at all.
---
The PvP changes to Burning Crusade were honestly the healthiest changes this game has ever had, I'll let Arena go, but the changes they made to the honour system in Burning Crusade were long overdue.
---
The PvP rank system in Vanilla, and soon to be Classic, promotes such an unhealthy amount of farming that it's an absolutely insane undertaking for a single person. I'm not gonna tell Blizzard to change it, but I won't ever deny that the change made in TBC was a good thing.
---
I dislike the pools as well, the floating piles of debris were cool though, fishing a box of supplies from the river is awesome.
---
I love that POE is leaking in here.
---
Yikes
---
So now I'm confused.  Is it a limit to the number of people you can put in that guild, because you sounded like they cared about how many characters you had on that server.
---
I have plans for four characters, so it doesn't help you much.  Also, you didn't say what you enjoyed doing, so we can't really give you advice.  If you love to heal, me telling you to play a rogue, mage and warlock isn't helping you.
---
I'm currently debating Orc Warlock and Undead Mage. Both are excellent choices which makes deciding so difficult. Mage is very controlled, very powerful, you really feel like you can do anything, and the more skilled you are the more you can show it.
---
Warlock is slightly less controlled, but exciting for it. You have great tools like fear and Voidwalker tanking, and you're much sturdier. Watching stuff melt is tremendously fun.
---
Nvm, it seemed the post that was created about it was totally fake, and i apologize for stating such a claim beofre having all the facts.
---
Imagine getting worked up about someone using the wrong color to describe a button in a computer game. Fuckin dweeb .
---
No disrespect to the dev team but even small things are not "non issues." We fight for little things that made the game special because we still have memories, a decade later mind you, about these parts of the game. Don't throw aside the little things that made the game special to us. Yeah it was a good AMA. But things like this need to be addressed
---
They should just switch the horde and the alliance goods. They had separate goals and with no warning it would complete stretch the effort out.
---
My boss has been gone for 2 years. I don’t have to make eye contact with him.
---
Azshara was one of my favorite farming zones! I would hit up those demons all the time just for Rune and Felcloth farm.
---
Wouldn't expect that to be popular hrmm.
---
I mean, in that regard it's worse then WoD. You could pretty much neglect everything in the garrison if you were okay with missing out on achievements and gold income. Or set it up where you just make use of the passie income by sending missions out once a day, seeing as you had a hearthstone that put you 10 steps away from the table. 
---
Even the legendary chain's missions could be done without effort. 
---
Imo they should've either just let the system retire gracefully or carried it over *fully*. The issue here is the half-assed attempt to make it a core thing.
---
does it really matter if you are pressing 1 1 1 1 or 1 2 1 2 ?
---
any rotation is boring if you look at it tha way and its not really hard no matter what you play
---
See you there horde bitches
---
Rogue because I love playing combat then 
---
Mage for the hopes of atiesh at the end of the road
---
Then shaman for meme widfury oneshot
---
Nah, I'm not playing paladin.
---
Bannerlord then
---
Long enough that she got a Warcraft sword tattooed on her forearm!
---
That doesn't apply to anything that's happening here at all.  What portion of your supposed "astroturfing" do you quantify as "Endorsement and Testimonial" exactly?  And even if you find some backdoor way to say that Method is using r/classicwow for that, AND can prove it beyond "I said so", feel free to tell me what part of the act you feel it violates.  Come on armchair lawyer, I'm waiting.
---
As long as it is a place holder!
---
Thanks for making it harder my friend
---
&gt; No more than three characters total **on the roster.**
---
How would this help with queue times?
---
Here's his old guide. he removed the cached versions for new one.

If your buying potions while leveling up you'll probably be broke all the time
---
OP, make a petition to keep skeletons in classic with the given idea of randomly orienting them when you respawning so everyone can upvote it and get Blizzards attention. They said they are listening to our feedback so let's make it clear this is a change no one wants.
---
That's the second new realm on EU.
---
&gt; Blizzard simply needs to take this reddit down
---
Blizzard doesn't run this subreddit.  You really have no idea how Reddit works.
---
It's a classic item, from a classic raid, so, yes.
---
I never know whether to do 3 into gouge or 3 into dodge.
---
Yeah Nugiyen and Zizaran both have ample experience with marathon racing. Any lack of research or experience with speedleveling in vanilla wow would be mitigated by being in a team with (presumably) ample knowledge. And who knows, maybe they are and/or have been practicing off-stream.
---
Will be interesting to see how this all goes down.
---
Sounds like your getting pretty worked up. Tourist.
---
Ah very lucky, we had a hybrid dkp/loot council thing. Mainly because we ran into issues with players wanting to use gear on gear that didn't make much sense.  They would let me use dkp on Ret stuff but if a warrior needed it they usually asked me to wait on a later drop.  Our group was warrior heavy though so there is that.
---
I love the tournament, can't wait to turn into a fish!
---
Posting from phone to remind me of this on pc.
---
I remember in wrath i would have to log on 3 of our raiders accounts so when they got home from work they didnt sit in a que when it was raid time. Id really like to avoid dealing with that kinda stuff again.
---
All it will do is change who gets the queues haha
---
Burn
---
Probably keep in mind that most of the players that are on this list are associated with Method organisation rather than the actual Method guild.
---
I 99% believe that none of these guys will be World First and I think they know it. This event is more like a fun community event that they want to showcase rather than their competitive Mythic races.
---
Not really the wall of no. I'd be ok with both but although I love tbc I think classic plus is the better option. Also I know that if we get tbc the chance of classic plus is incredibly slim.
---
Sweet
---
It was initially main hand only but changed during vanilla to 1h, not sure which patch
---
What is it spelled Wagabo sux
---
Even 200k is less than the number of people who fought for it and signed the petition when there was all but no vote and 90% haters, and that was years ago. #yourewelcome
---
they are 100% missing an opportunity and valuable live streaming exposure if they do not do something like this on launch. That time at the start is the moment so many people have been waiting to feel again since vanilla first came out. If this was broadcast to the world via their twitch channel there is no doubt they would gain some old and new players.
---
Yeah I saw that, but "on the roster" didn't really help me out there, because it is in no way preventing you from having more than three characters on the server.  I guess it should have been more like "what three characters should I raid with with my guild" and my brain would have figured it out.
---
To be honest, I believe this is being blow out of proportion. 
---
First I will address Mankrik's wife location: The community advocated for no changes in classic, and blizzard is doing their best to adhere to it. Mankrik's wife location is not in the slightest integral to game play whatsoever. All it does is revive a meme, and let it live on longer. What people don't realize is that many people will be new to the game, and many returning players have not played any version of classic in over a decade. What this means is that essentially very few people will know the location of Mankrik's wife in the first place. So this change and the endless posts about it is repetitive, pointless, and honestly I don't believe they should entertain it in the slightest because ultimately most people will not know the body's location and barrens chat will be filled with the same where's Mankrik's wife question and jokes, so people need to relax here.
---
Now onto point two: Materials for the AQ war effort. I believe that there is a solid argument to be made here in favor of changing the required materials, but again most people have not played any version of classic in ages and thus don't even remember what's required. All I personally remember is that cloth was required. The same people arguing for changing the materials will be the ones hording the materials for turn ins upon content release. Also the war effort required a lot of materials, so what would they change it to? Temporarily created new materials? That genuinely goes against the whole no change aspect. If the community feels this strongly about this subject then perhaps each server should have an agreement where none of the top guilds or guilds in general stock pile any form of materials until the content is released. If the community truly wants this then the community can make this happen.
---
There's a lot of things I would like in classic, dual spec, arenas, etc. But guess what, it was not in vanilla so it should not be in classic. Same thing for those  two points mentioned above. You wanted no changes they did their best to give you no changes. Now its up to you as a community to do your part in making the classic experience as authentic to vanilla as possible. If that means making a server wide pact to adhere to certain agreements then so be it.
---
I would share this with my friends if it didn't start out so quiet then jump to ear-rapingly loud
---
It wasn't uncommon to see wowgold.com scrawled in skeletons at the entrance to org. I am sad they have gotten rid of this but also understand that they don't want it in their games.
---
Yea everyone here knows servers are going to fill up but their plan is the right one.
---
The goals is to rerelease all the old expacs until you guys are caught up to retail.
---
Gotcha bitch!
---
They also advertised gold selling websites with corpses so its in their best interests to remove them.
---
looks cool but idk how much these items really help out these less viable specs
---
'Play Dead' comes with a 50% chance of not getting back up.
---
It's not any different from someone cursing in whispers, general chat, trade chat, etc.
---
If anything this takes way more time, resources and isn't directly targeted.
---
Said the same thing. Must have been the gentleman from the video
---
Most of the games content is pve. Roll on a pve server and you will be fine.
---
Looks like the answer is yes
---
You may want to look into the difference between Method, a guild, and Samsung the multi-billion dollar producer of a product.  Method isn't Blizzard.  Feel free to address my exact questions in a legal manner.  I'll wait.
---
And I’d spell out universaltube7 chokes frequently on cocks through the middle of the trade district. Neither one of us should have our messages removed.
---
Spot on man. I'll definitely reach out if/when I decide to pull the trigger and try to play. It would be a lot more fun playing with people that have similar responsibilities. Cheers buddy, and good luck!
---
If you like everything as prescribed, by default, you're right. Some people read their screens different than others. Also, way to be a dick.
---
The only way to trade gold from BFA to Classic is by 3rd party traders, which get you banned
---
Except that was literally just one reason among many that they posted. I wonder why you've purposely tried to obfuscate that there were several other reasons mentioned. Its *almost* like your argument depends on attacking an agenda and that attack doesn't work when some of the reasons provided have nothing at all to do with it.
---
I don't like the skeleton change, I don't think any of the reasons they mentioned for the change are particularly compelling, but I find arguing with a private company over in game conditions which it finds to be unacceptable to be even less compelling.
---
@Blizzard wtf you really selling out like this? Lemme guess you taking out the blood orgies as well in the plaguelands. Please don't ruin RP for me #notmyblizzard
---
You can ignore chat and now with skeletons removed you can ignore them to.
---
What is layering?
---
Lol, guess so.
---
who cares lol
---
I understand that for PvP because of the debuff, but how good is it leveling?
---
Hi, /u/Rushfan1123

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread. This is thread is the best place to ask questions regarding class, professions, and race choices.

My point is that if I can find 9 redditors spouting this opinion in one single thread posted today, then the real amount of people who hold this opinion is far larger, making a post addressing everyone instead of specifically replying to everyone is more effective. I'm not as interesting in arguing with these 9 redditors as I am in presenting my counter-argument to everyone. Thus, a submission is hopefully more effective.

Correction: Gremlins **was** an extremely famous movie, just like The Burbs, Mac and Me, Top Secret, The Neverending Story, Fletch, Splash, and 300 other movies that this generation has never heard of.
---
Gremlins didn’t have a lasting pop culture impact like Back to the Future and Ghostbusters. If not for the toys and the sequels, it would have faded away faster than Robin Williams’ *Popeye* or *Porkys*.
---
For the record, I’m not trashing Gremlins. It’s a fun movie. It’s just that newer gen kids don’t go back and watch older stuff on their own. Why would they? Literally a billion seconds of new footage to consume on YouTube every day. We didn’t have new stuff all the time, so we watched what we could...like the Gremlins sequel 🤢
---
Not at all. Warrior leveling IS challenging before level 40, but it's not impossible, even to a casual. Focus lower leveling areas, dont fight orange mobs, stack spirit, etc. will help.

Exactly. Blizzard wouldn't do well with it. Games like Classic can't really exist today. Do you honestly think Activision would allow Blizzard to create a whole new game (which is what Classic + would be) without a cash shop or WoW tokens or any of that other modern day mmorpg garbage?
---
We didn’t have talents in closed beta so this wasn’t a thing. Pyro was baseline.
---
So of people don't use a third party, it's okay to do then?
---
This is my concern.
---
you can ignore skeletons, go somewhere else it's a big world there's even personal instances where nobody else can hurt you all the way from 8 to 60
---
I haven’t found a game that takes longer to grind than OSRS. You’ll be fine.
---
That makes two of us. Checking this reddit literally every day has me like a kid waiting for Christmas to arrive. I can easily dump that much time into the game as well, but it would destroy my career since I'm no where near in a stable place yet. It's horrible timing for me!
---
rogue druid shaman probably.  I'd probably have to give up the priest.
---
I intend to level mostly by questing, probably solo or through organic grouping. I probably won't ever raid and will mostly just enjoy the world and professions, dungeons, etc.
---
What 3 classes are the best for me and for what reasons. Thanks!
---
&gt;Having 
---
Oh but wait, read my Orc analysis. Lol, I hope I didn't just make this more difficult for you.
---
This is exactly why I am still undecided and am having difficulty. I'm at a point now where I'm like.. maybe I just make 2 warriors? Orc for DPS and Tauren for tanking, haha.
---
What were those other reasons exactly? You’re the only one obfuscating here.
---
Added to the queue, cheers!
---
&gt; cus I sure as hell am reporting this reddit, the content creators and Method to the Federal Trade Commission
---
LMAO oh boy!  I can't wait to see them take swift and decisive action against a fan run forum, a Guild, and some Youtubers...
---
&gt;poopsocker
---
This. This right here is how you know you're in vanilla WoW.
---
damn, well i guess we log in at 5:31 lol
---
&gt;Starting to feel guilty for accepting my salary for sitting around watching twitch all day and compiling spreadsheets for classic wow. 
---
At first i thought you were saying your actual job was to sit around watching Twitch and compiling classic WoW spreadsheets. I was gonna ask if you're hiring.
---
Perhaps. Maybe the game will only attract 800,000 players, instead of 850,000 players
---
Came here looking for this.  We had 5 Hunters killing Chromag for a year.  I think we saw 2 Xbows.
---
Method doesn't have 100 people in their guild and 100 people instantly upvoted a post that had a negative score. Try again.
---
So if 2 players just trade gold on the Honor system, that's allowed?
---
I find that concerning.
---
Full [Eskhandar's set](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=261/spirit-of-eskhandar).  My guild doesn't compete for world bosses; alas.
---
A bitcoin miner in of itself isn't necessarily harmful. So people not having issues isn't indicative of anything. The issue would be the lack of disclosure.
---
There's no rush to do anything.
---
it will help with queue times...... for me
---
Every point you made is only valid if you have a healer babysitting you. 
---
Solo warrior will loose most 1v1.
---
On the other hand, warrior is the best class in the game. Lok’tar Ogar brother.
---
Quest helper was around in vanilla IIRC
---
What about getting gear endgame? Will I be uber gimped since I won't have the time to farm dungeons and raids like other people?
---
You forgot a period at the end of that sentence, genius.
---
i don't think it's a terrible change, but removing an entire mechanic because some people abuse it is just stupid. might aswell remove chat because people can slur. might aswell remove character names because those can be offensive. that's a really dumb principle to follow through on.
---
Yeah, I don't get it either really.  I mean, sure you "save time raiding" but at the same time you're spending a decent chunk of time gathering buffs and a lot of times you're staying logged out to save your buffs.  
---
Why I'm glad the guild I'm in has a lot of ex-vanilla Naxx clearing raiders.  So we know what's possible and what we don't need world buffs for.  We were planning on running 20 man raids just to get a little bit more of a challenge too. Might have to buff/consume up for 20 man stuff though, but we're going to underman content and not really intending on recruiting a big guild.
---
And add my phone number, coward
---
Came here to say they already explained why not. But this ain't bad. Probably not gonna happen though.
---
I suppose it depends on what you mean by casual.
---
If you mean casual in that you can't commit much time to the game, then you really shouldn't have any problems, it'll just take you a long while to get to 60, which is completely fine because the classic leveling experience is phenomenal. Hopefully you have some sort of time to commit to dungeons and stuff though every once in a while.
---
If you're casual in terms of attitude and expectations, then I'd probably look elsewhere as solo leveling a warrior can be very tedious and frustrating and will take you longer than other classes.
---
Ya I feel ya. The human racials are nice but I plan to play a male character and the human males are god awful. Their running animation is so doofy and their melee animations make it look like they're hitting a kid in the pool with one of those styrofoam noodles. Pathetic. I would hate staring at my character for hours and hours on end. I'll take a hit from not having those racials and go with something I know I'll love 2 years from now. Dwarves on the other hand? Straight mountain men badasses.

# Sigma - A Guild that slays together, stays together.
---
Sigma is a guild founded by experienced guild leaders. We are looking to stake a claim in World of Warcraft Classic and create a friendly environment for a small group of friends. We are a PvE-focused guild, and will therefore be recruiting for raids.
---
**Raid Times:** (tentative) Sat/Sun/Mon 12am+ BST
---
**Contact:** [https://www.guilded.gg/Sigma](https://www.guilded.gg/Sigma)
---
Id rather just ignore you while blizzard takes the correct steps for their game.
---
I didnt really play back then, but I remember the challenging era of mmos. I just dont want stuff handed to me. I want to be amazed someone is 60 again, not amazed someone isnt.
---
They are gonna be on a PvE server I'd assume
---
came to wow from doac
---
immediately missed daoc pvp which was 5 levels superior to wow
---
learned to love wow tho after growing in the community
---
&lt;shrug&gt; wow was kinda cool because it allowed people a clear path to endgame, but i guess thottbot/wowhead/etc could also be contributing in that sense as well
---
You can log on really early and just leaving it waiting rather than trying to login at the time it officially launches is my understanding. So me, Uk based, can logon at any time on Monday, leave it on the character select screen and then when 11pm rolls out, press enter. That’s at least how I understand this! 🤣
---
WORSE BY THE DAY - was here under 15k
---
Only if they use a third party, I want player2player gold trading banned too.
---
He probably assumed that OP simply added the percentages together to get 9%. Doing it that way would still get you close enough to the actual percentage though, even if it is by accident.
---
I’m going to go ahead and call bullshit on this. But I’ll take a look at the files and see for myself if you really will provide a link.
---
Corpsemaker is 28.9 dps with 15 strength from the first boss in rfk with ~60% drop rate and the ravager from Herod is dank as heck. I’m leveling through dungeons with 4 warriors and 1 shaman and I’m definitely not doing the whirlwind weapon quest
---
So you're admitting it ISN'T Method doing this... huh, well that's funny.  Ok then, now we know it isn't Method.  You still haven't said WHO is in violation of the law then and how.
---
I'mma take it you weren't on 4chan in 2004. I just think it wouldn't have been political meltdown 15 years ago because we all just knew they were trolls.
---
Dude!! Troll next troll next!
---
Lack of what disclosure? The OP is literally lying with his post and people have already proven him wrong / called him out.
---
As a holy priest and a huge fan of BRD I am looking forward to a fantastic grind for pre raid gear.
---
Use the twitch client, make sure the addons are version 1.13 not 8.2

The politically correct nomenclature is "people of real life" or "porl".

I think you’re my favorite person on Reddit.
---
they rebuilt tons of systems for classic, including pretty much the hunter class as a whole.
---
u think they can't add a way to target individual corpses for deletion?
---
People on those servers really need to get great video footage when the layers go bye-bye. I'll be on Fairbanks so I won't be experiencing it but I would love to witness it on a few YouTube videos.
---
No one knows who those people are. No one cares.
---
No, but it's dumb to refer to yourself as a casual when we all have a slightly different definition of casual. Do you want to be reassured that you will find the fun? Then I reassure you, you will find the fun.
---
Must be nice to literally never have to leave your house or have any real life responsibilities.
---
You literally don't have time to do anything else if you're streaming 580 hours over a 30 day period, all of your downtime is basically eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom.
---
You played both?!? Are healer expected to dps in 4man and 40man?!?
---
Can’t get epic mount till phase 2? That’s kind of disappointing. Might have to rethink my first character.
---
It's not worth getting LW at all in my opinion. You can just farm the skin and have someone else make the devilsaur set.
---
As to mining, hunters use track X, which you utilize a lot. Not having it on feels weird. You would be constantly swapping from track mineral to your own track. Very annoying.
---
Single target drain tanking is for noobs. Pull multiples.
---
Better get new friends. Lok’Tar Fucking Gar!!!!!
---
250-300 hours of your doing professions and battle grounds. Well it did for me back in the day. I’m thinking at 15 hours per week hitting 60 around Christmas.
---
For instance if I said hey dude 1000g on classic for a wow tokens worth on retail I can create someone on their server take the gold buy token give them classic gold , as long as no one scams each other and you don't pay with real money yes you can do this legally
---
If slouching is comfortable, but majes your body sore then why do it? there's plenty of ways to comfortably sit without making yourself uncomfortable after. so why slouch/sit in a way that only makes you temporarily comfortable, unless you're just dumb?

Honestly, probably just browse this sub. I get a lot of my news from the good folks round here.

That makes me think of pearl with an enormous face and a big mouth
---
Seeing websites spelled out in skeletons is unsettling, im happy with the answer they gave.
---
In the original thread wasn't there talk of 3 different fishing zones inside Azshara with different numbers to "Avoid Get-a-ways"? Some like 400+. XiliumR said they'd been fixed but maybe that new map hadn't been released yet.
---
&gt; I want
---
Maybe stop your feet more and hold your breath.
---
I've noticed when it comes to this topic people tend to forget about the people posing the questions in the first place. The Classic team have approx the same ideals as the community and they want Classic to do well; they aren't just gonna turn around and put up a poll saying "Do you want LFG in the game?".
---
I’m playing on Whitemane because of west coast, but I second this, great community sofar.
---
Machinima is who was doing the false testimonials and social media manipulation. Samsung was manipulating social media which is exactly what Method is doing here. You aren't allowed to have false testimonials and support on public forums and places. It's simply illegal. The fact they did it in an advertisement post is even more incriminating.
---
I use Winamp since like 20 Years, do people not use it anymore?
---
Nah I think it’s your eyes that are too small
---
So, you’re blind?
---
No tree form back then. I was just a badass cow. I love the Healing Touch kind of heals
---
Sorry your personal experience will be ruined by the choice blizzard made, better uninstall the game.
---
Are we gonna have to find inventive new ways of spelling out hate speech to prove a point now? That is just a bullshit answer.
---
It's still such a different game from what it was back in 2007. I loved when they came out with osrs. But I quick a few years after due to the gross amount of Qol changes they made cause it was polled making every achievement insignificant. And I am on the #nochanges team. Or well the team that says the community atleast dont get to choose. Cause they always end up taking quality of live changes over looking at the bigger picture
---
Once in a lifetime.
---
You know what to do.
---
There are simply too many factors in this equation that are suspicious to me. For one I dont trust that whole "data collecting" statement once you launch the downloader, also there is no reason at all to not upload that project to github.   
---
I removed the entire thing once I realized how shit it were. Good thing I'm wiping my entire system just before classic comes out, I don't want some fucking miner slowing me down.
---
I'd encourage everyone else to do the same. 1. Most addons I've encountered that needs in-game tweaking are in testing stages atm. 2. If I'm not mistaken it's entirely possible to get banned for altering with blizzard files? (If they somehow found out).
---
Theres a very high probability it's been referenced around you. Specifically the "dont feed them after midnight" joke I've seen more times than I can count.
---
Dear god.
---
What if people write mean things on the internet?
---
God help us all.
---
Classic wow is the perfect place to have this discussion since it's about the future of the game we're all gonna be playing.
---
&gt;Probably not gonna happen though 
---
Why? Seems like it would be kinda easy to do
---
Sometimes running somewhere and there are skeletons scattered everywhere adds some awe and mystery to Azeroth.  
---
I hope Blizzard will eventually reconsider their stance and work out a solution.
---
Na
---
You're reading too much into it.
---
Put rmt purchasing of gold within classic or retail aside. No changes there its always been a breach of tos and can/ will result suspensions/bans.
---
Do you reallly think that trading gold from retail to classic in anyway would ever be allowed ? I think the notion is so outlandish that the response they gave in this context could be considered direct, cause its so ridiculous. It would destroy the economy even if they had some equations that reduced the value to fit the eco of the realm it was going to.
---
Maybe i am just ignorant to the corporate beast but thats my take.
---
Two people making a trade is not what I think of when I think about a third party. If gold goes from player A to player B how is that not 2 parties. Blizzard doesn't even get a cut of the transaction.
---
Tell me more!
---
Haha for real
---
Nah you'll be good man, maybe not that God warrior invincible running around with a pocket healer but there will be people with more gear and less gear than you and you'll be fine

Don't say that out loud!!

&gt; 100 upvotes don't magically appear instantly on a forum post

You don't understand how Reddit works.
---
&gt;They or someone they hired to do it are doing it. 
---
You said it couldn't be them,  so it must be someone they hired.  Who'd they hire?  You have proof?  Where's any of this coming from?
---
&gt; Both are the same level of illegal.
---
Neither are illegal.  This isn't a contravention of the law.  They aren't advertisers or the owners of a product.
---
&gt;Time for Method to learn they have to obey some laws.
---
They haven't broken any...
---
&gt;Think I will track the bots on their next twitch world first as well.
---
Please do.  I'm sure somehow that's illegal also?  Link me the law.
---
&gt; They have ZERO social media interaction on their twitters, web page or streamers, yet these people come out of nowhere to support them and then all go away the next day.
---
So it's illegal to watch content on Twitch and not comment during it?  I've watched streams before and never said anything, I'm not a bot.  Most of us have Twitch open while we're doing something else.  Only you seem obsessed with it.
---
They’re just skeletons? Not a big deal.

Wow's Appeal on release was different and specific to each person playing, and also dependent on the games that player played before wow. Grand statements about appeal for everyone are silly.
---
I was in the Discord this morning looking to get some support because my download wasn't working. Someone joined and proceeded to demean the developers and state they were incompetent because the downloaded wasn't working. After a good deal of immaturity, and back and forth with the mods, that user was banned.
---
I would imagine that OP is the person that was banned from the discord and is seeking to discredit them because they are upset.
---
&gt;Yeah, fuck that. Absolutely no mention of a miner running without the user's consent, it runs even after you close the software down, was added recently after the hype, and he banned me from the Discord when I shared the VT results. Fabian is a shitty fucking individual and you are too if you try and defend him.

If you sign a contract whwn you rent that house saying i can kick you out for any reason at any time, you sure as fuck dont have any such right.
---
You're talking shit.
---
Not to be rude, but it sounds like you're responding to this out of jealousy and unhappiness from your own life. Is everything okay with you?
---
I get it, I really do. It is absolutely ridiculous that somebody could stream or want to stream for nearly 18 hours a day, but he set it as a personal goal and that's something to be admired in my opinion. From what I read, he's not going out and telling people "Hey, quit your job and be a worthless human to achieve these goals." The guy has said that his girlfriend is extremely supportive that cooks for him etc. and he takes his health into account when it comes down to it.
---
Trust me, I'd do anything for a decent job right now. It's not "nice" to never have to leave the house or have real life responsibilities. Those things absolutely terrify me with out any solid job prospects lined up.
---
It's a valid comparison. People have bad posture because it's comfortable or feels good at the time. Later on you realize you erred, but while you're doing it initially, it feels fine.
---
Just like eating that chili cheese burrito from Taco Bell might seem reasonable initially, but then, later, when it liquefies your intestines themselves and you shit out fiery, magma-like pustules of hate do you realize it was a bad idea.
---
If you're unable to comprehend why millions, if not billions, of humanity have poor posture then...good for you.
---
Alright.

I do vaguely remember something about it being too easy to snipe players in PvP with Invis.

Would you be interested in weekend rating hours from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday? We are a semi-hardcore guild that is in need of another warlock to fill out a roster. If you're interested send me a PM.

Just a quick parody i made out of one of the most legendary memes from back in the day. Hope ya'll find it entertaining!

No lol

It's their IP buddy. They are now having their IP's reddit run by cybercriminals and content creators who suck up to those cybercriminals.
---
I played on a low/medium pop servers at launch and honestly always wished I had been on a higher pop one. Hell, even my characters on retail are on servers with abysmal horde balance, wish I'd looked I to it more when I chose it and my guild.
---
Ziz only has 1 fatal weakness, his inability to read may slow him down
---
If it makes you feel any better, years ago in DotA 2 a weapon drop came out for Faceless Void (popular hero in the meta for a long time) called Timebreaker. This was back when you got items just for playing, and I played a lot so I had collected like 4 or 5 of the damn things. There was no point in duplicates and storage space for cosmetics was limited, so I purged all but one of them during an inventory spring clean.
---
A short while later it was discovered that the design was a blatant reskin ripoff of a model from some Asian MMO, so Valve changed the design and removed the item from the loot tables. The item was instantly valuable, [MFW it peaked at around $150USD](https://i.imgur.com/9TK7zZv.gif)
---
They didn’t remove skeletons. You are ranting on a false premise. They made it where you can only have one skeleton of yourself in the game world at a time.
---
Finally!! I was really hoping someone would edit this video for classic somehow but I don’t have the time to do it myself
---
You have to spec Combat though
---
This is mostly true but they can send guildies who are high but falling behind.
---
blizzard made the game that you're transferring it ON
---
blizzard is ALWAYS the second-party in anything you do in their games
---
I too wish this is possible.  
---
In FFXIV, it doesn't matter which region you bought you game, you can play on any region, any server.
---
You can get your Imp at Level1, at least as a Human. You can also train Immolate right at Level1 if you sell all your Gear straight away.
---
Complete with period-appropriate soundtrack.
---
horde equivilant? 
---
(not that it matters, i'll just get Zygors from grey sources.)
---
Yes. Originally the requirements were really brutal and didn't scale well for differently sized servers.
---
They then changed it to be a little more forgiving so you could have multiple R14s in the same week.
---
But this time around is going to be even more competitive. Servers are bigger, honor farming strategies are more intense, it's easier now to account share than ever before etc.
---
But hey that's vanilla, rank isn't skill-based. Unless you're actually good then getting R14 is more of a signal for pity than praise
---
Warrior leveling isn't that hard tbh.  It's harder than all the other classes, sure, but it's not insanely difficult to the point where you need hardcore gamer skills or something.  Just be careful about pulling too many enemies, bring plenty of food, and level up first aid.  Also, don't be afraid to find a group for tougher quests.
---
&gt; You aren't allowed to have false testimonials and support on public forums and places.
---
I am.  So are you.  So is anyone who isn't a business producing a product or a paid advertiser for said product.  Method is neither.
---
It was because the cast didn’t break the invis, only finishing it did. Was stupid in STV you could gather a bunch of mages and just insta kill anyone.
---
Bro I had no it was a hand until now
---
The only thing you are doing is shitting on people that are passionate about a game they once loved playing. Blizzard seems to give zero thoughts to the little things.
---
lol neckbeards pretending to be good at video games. Put them in any competitive game and watch them get annihilated.
---
I pity you for missing out half of the game
---
Hahah, I'm least interested in Trolls. I had these two already written, just edited them slightly here for this post.
---
I'm only debating between these 2. Trolls just boil down to having slightly more threat generation than other warriors because of berserking. This only matters for the top 1% of hardcore guilds, and speedrunning guilds.
---
All their other racials suck or are useless otherwise. I think the plethora of stuff you get with either Tauren or Orc outweighs Troll's one ability. Also if you go DW fury prot with an Orc with two super high end axes, you'll be ridiculous on threat anyway.
---
Thanks for all the responses guys! Best of luck to those using none, you're the true grinders!
---
Im kinda surprised the internet and apparently even Blizzard hasnt figured out the age old counter to trolls: dont feed them.
---
People are literally going to find new ways just to spite them for this.
---
i can deny it cause that's how it was in vanilla.  as blizz answered twice in the Q&amp;A, "nochanges".  (except when blizzard wants to change things, apparently)
---
The shocker?
---
just jealous, mechnostrider game too stronk
---
Same with Shaman and Storm Strike.
---
Finally after 40 levels you have 1 melee spell as a melee class lol
---
Lol lol lol
---
&gt;Make it a perm bannable offense to write slurs in skeletons and enforce it. People abusing that was so incredibly rare and the skeletons are frankly an integral part of classic. Such a slippery slope type of change. 
---
Lol.... I'd really like to see them try and enforce that. Gold sellers used to do this shit all the time spelling out websites and whatnot, don't know why you'd say it was incredibly rare. Felt like it happened every single day in IF. I get that it sucks that you won't be able to see all the skeletons in certain areas but it's not that big of a deal. If anything it makes the game a ganker's paradise because nobody has any warning where massive battles or ganks are taking place lol.
---
Also, pulling out the "slippery slope" statements eh? Lol, haven't seen one of these in a while. I think the last time I saw someone using "slippery slope" they were talking about how having an improved mailbox was a slippery slope to LFR.
---
Who?
---
As in you are allowed to say way less today than people did back in the past. Nowadays not only do companies restrict your speech but now other people are more liable to freak out as well.
---
I’m going by hours haha idk how many people
---
Was there not some kind of quest that ended at scarlet monastery?
---
&gt; It's their IP buddy.
---
Blizzard does own an IP yes.  Fans are allowed to create communities around that IP.
---
&gt;They are now having their IP's reddit run by cybercriminals 
---
Jesus fucking Christ dude... the level of troll in you is insane.
---
"In the minutes leading up to launch". Doesn't sound to me like they're gonna have the realms up all day. Even if so, pretty sure you'll just get booted to the login screen if you're idle for too long.
---
As a rogue, this makes me moist
---
What realm are you on so I can farm you?

That just makes things worse.

What are you saying here?
---
Better to wait until they are low enough to use max rank if possible.
---
No. They’re saying that you can get banned for doing that.
---
There aren’t any low pop servers. And medium+ are all several times the size of original vanilla servers. So basically as it stands, the risk of a dead server is minimal for all launch servers.

What is wrong with players trading gold? Can I not give my friend gold to work towards his mount? Tell me how this is an issue.
---
Life after 30 is the same as Horde, just you get to kill the weirdos. And BRM at hand from Capital city
---
I think these kinds of changes can be done later. They're too controversial for people to agree on and actually change the game rather than just picking a certain version of classic and going with that.
---
For now let's just get standard no changes classic wow. Then we can decide later on what to do.
---
I have this memory of being a teenager and having it drop on my first run, selling it for the gold to buy a normal epic mount, and then having a lot of extra gold...
---
But it's bind on pickup, so this memory is impossible? WTF brain? Was it like, wish fulfillment I convinced myself happened in hindsight?
---

---
Ok
---
Warrior casual is actually a great idea. You can join any of the countless groups looking to a tank the moment you log on. I strongly recommend leveling with herb and alchemy. The numerous hour long buffs alchemy provides makes a huge difference for melee classes.
---
This is false - there will be skeletons in classic.
---
Nah I'm sick of people using a Blizzard IP reddit for their personal advertising through illegal means. Not about to have some two bit cybercriminals try to harm what they perceive could hurt their laughable esports company. They should have known better than to put 100 votes in within a small time frame on a old post with a negative score. BLATANT.

You mean the 5 second rule?

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Corrupted_Ashbringer/Scarlet_Monastery_Event
---
I agreed its kinda dumb I do lots of gold making and think tsm is gonna be worse for the economy than this stuff  for classic but if people do this it'll be with people they trust or like a friend of a friend for a small catch-up amount if they have the gold to blow on retail or a one time chunk for mount or something if they don't have alot of time to dedicate to Classic
---
&gt;conform to the temporary"woke" fad
---
or you know, they actually agree with the underlying reasoning.
---
If you are worried about queues just roll on a low pop. Me and my friends have full time jobs and took time off next week for release. We moved off of a full pop into one of the new ones. Blaumeaux. We want to enjoy our limited time playing. Not waiting in queues for all 3 of us to get online
---
Same brotha
---
This is fucking amazing.
---
You're aware that people played this game when it first came out right? And not just on private servers after everyone already knew everything about it?
---
Most rpgs before wow were obtuse and unclear and it was an accepted part of the genre
---
Damn genius, you know how many fools are gonna pay for this!?
---
keylogger don't click
---
Which is why you posted? Sweet logic. Irregardless, I made the reports and am not going to continue with a post that will be removed from the wannabe Method shill moderators on this laughable reddit. I expect a shadow or perma ban like they do to everyone else who calls out their laughable moderation when it comes to Method and Classicast.
---
The funny thing is if they actually like Classic WoW, they are supporting people who are going to try to harm it, because it can harm them and their esports business. If Classic succeeds then Blizzard will take this reddit over anyways and assign them a "classic wow fans" reddit instead that doesn't look as official. 
---
These dumb moderators already lost either way and they don't know it. It's what happens when you are stupid and support people that use and manipulate dumber people. Least Sco has that going for him.
---
You dont know but you still go for it
---
Dm me!
---
Joana’s world record stream time is 4 days 20 hours of wall clock time which includes sleeping four or five hours a day.
---
Objects such as the skeletons cost basically nothing to the server. Even if there were hundreds in the same space.
---
They work similar to PoE’s items dropping on the ground. Despite literally thousands dropping each minute per player, at the end of the day, the resources they use aren’t even worth mentioning (despite a lot of players believing otherwise until devs explained)
---
In previous comments on this issue you've complained about "the SJWs" censoring everything.
---
What exactly is there to "get"?  I have a feeling that you're looking to fight against a bogeyman that doesn't actually exist.
---
Different games, RS3 never had anywhere close to the population of retail WoW, it was never successful, where believe it or not WoW retail has been at the very least with legion...
---
I think you just won the internet
---
Have you don't have 10+ hours a week to do raids or dungeons or bgs then you're not getting good gear or seeing end game in Vanilla regardless of class.
---
Eh, I think it’s cool that people are creating businesses out of video games now a days. Especially those who aren’t the companies making them. That being said I’ll avoid streamer servers at all costs and many watch a little while leveling.
---
That's been a staple of the game from the beginning, horde players are super proud of themselves while people who play ally or both just look on in confusion. It's a tired meme, and has been for a long time but it makes some people happy I guess
---
I admire Joana for this.
---
&gt;People abusing that was so incredibly rare
---
It's also 2019 now.
---
Good point.
---
its not the same thing at all, truestrike might be a 50 dps increase for hunter and 50 dps increase for a rogue as well, HOJ is 20 dps increase for a hunter and 100 dps increase for a rogue/warrior therefore it's kind of a dick move to take it from a melee as a hunter. Numbers are made up.
---
Vanilla and Classic are two different games.
---
Why?

He's not wrong about the fact that, compared to every other mmo in existence at the time, wow was MUCH more casual friendly, and that's a big part of the reason it was so successful.
---
are you me
---
Did they confirm 1 physical server per layer?
---
In shaman vs mage for example you try to jump the novas
---
Its more than we now have tools to cut the toxicity faster, so they cry a lot more since they cant get away with it anymore.

You'd all be able to be AFK for the majority of dungeons.

An EU version please? You can resuse album covers, just incorporate the EU realm names.

There ain't enough server space for the two of us undead warlocks... We shall settle this in the starting area on mankrik!
---
Cloth turn ins. No, I'm not talking about AQ turn ins, each capital has an NPC that takes cloth turn ins (stacks) for rep. It's EXPENSIVE. LOTS of runecloth. As you level, you can turn in a stack of each type for a decent bit, but I think it follows the same rules as other quests, so you have to know when to turn in to get credit.
---
Heil Blizzhart.
---
Yeah hope it gets to the high population mark before launch. I want a healthy population.
---
Video is incorrect. Rockbiter is a flat +atk power, it does not scale.
---
Windfury is 20% chance for 2 atk, it will scale based on weapon dps.
---
/thread
---
I would say you could easily make a case for feral strength vs feral agility gear if you played as a feral hybrid (meaning you can tank or dps). Saying you can use both even if your not tanking or not in cat dps in that run, that’s a lil more of an argument
---
saying a Druid gets priority on all Melee leather and any spell power leather and cloth, just because you can use it: I get your point but people will revolt when you first bring this up in a pug. 
---
But if you want to make that case just try to play with warriors and hunters, &amp; paladins or shaman.
---
But i will say Ive been seeing different BiS lists going around and I think more people are awakening to the idea of gear outside your class. Like that maybe be a holy paladin might wear some cloth on an odd piece of gear for the stats one the way up to gearing. It was true then but you really had to make a case to some people.
---
Like good ol Leroy Jenkins and the famous shoulders. 
---
All in all once you find your core friends things like this are easier to handle in the long run. 
---
Best of luck. Druids are awesome.
---
Not gonna lie I skipped most the read because the first part is so full of misunderstandings. A ton of classes roll multiple specs. Priests/warriors/druid/shaman/paladin all can roll for multiple specs while playing all of them without respecing. Not only are most of rolling on multiple sets but multiple armor types as well. All warriors/paladin BiS have leather and mail. Priests need completely different gear for shadow and healing sets. The cost benefit though is up in the air depending on who you play with. If you aren't upfront with rolling for almost everything then people might kick you and you could end up with a bad reputation. It's all about transparency otherwise your a bit of a ninja.
---
Should have waited until Monday at 2:30 PST
---
Would have gotten that panic money
---
What the hell? You don’t own anything you rent either? Are you joking? When was the last time you rented an apartment and they said “here it’s yours now”. 
---
Rent is the perfect analogy. Just like how you pay rent to temporarily use an apartment month to month, you pay a sub fee to pay WoW from month to month. 
---
You’re falling apart man, maybe you should get some rest. 
---
Also nobody is saying you should be able to do whatever you want. The TOS has nothing against me sharing my opinion on this issue. You either must be a troll or mentally ill.
---
come on man, at worst it happened once every few months it was hardly out of control.
---
hard pass on destroying something potentially awesome to minimise the impact of something that was already uncommon.
---
Who, me?  I'm spot on.  There's a reason Blizzard keeps saying they want to get down to a single layer as soon as possible.
---
Ah man, this had me laughing. Was half expecting the soil song to start playing on top of drowning pool.
---
There is a reason blizzard is telling people to gtfo Herod, if people insist on all going to one server that's on them.
---
Just buy a sub.  No need to go out and buy the game.
---
I agree but it seems like everyone only talks about Herod and shaz. Just dont see any love for stalagg.
---
Lol I hate HoTs. Downranked HT+ swiftmend is my jam
---
Just sub
---
just the sub, because the base sub comes with world of warcraft (the base game up to the latest xpac)
---
this is the exact same agrument people are making against classic.
---
Hey, I'm that guy! I'm currently streaming and will be ending at 566.
---
The system itself encourages account sharing, the addition of this encourages it even further. They literally just removed skeletons to prevent the promotion of third party transactions, and yet their introduction of zero downtime honour farming promotes multiple users per account.
---
Bit of a backwards message.
---
Terry! i would freak!
---
Yes you do thats why your landlord cant just show up and barge in whenever they want you tit.
---
It's such a minor thing to complain about.
---
The amount of player allowed in the world is the same on all servers, so when layering turns off all servers will probably look exactly the same. The only difference will be how big the queue to get in is.
---
Someone else mentioned this like an hour or two ago. Good for him tho imo.
---
This streamer is me. I didn't just ditch responsbilities. I still do chores on my breaks or shower during them. You can check my profile for my post on the 2007scape reddit to know more about my work situation (inbetween jobs, had extra time).
---
Typical sjw behaviour scouring through peoples internet history.... the skeletal remains of fallen heroes adds a sense of immersion to the whole rpg feel. Removing that to appease sjws and censorship as a whole is so sad to me.
---
Not sure about Ziz but Nugi played WoW for many years, still seems weird though.
---
Scarlet set from Scarlet Monastery, the iconic red helm and shoulder pad come from Herod in the Armory wing.
---
Well there goes a bookmark. Pass
---
Who the fuck levels as arms?
---
Oh hey guy! I don't follow your stream, but you can PM it to me and I'll hit you with a free sub or so next month if you do! Plus I'll give you a follow and at least stop by to say hey. 
---
Hope I got most of your information right! You're switching to WoW once release, aren't you?
---
Me too
---
Seeing this was would give you a nice warning that your about to get ganked too.  Nothing is more frightening then getting off a flightpath to be surrounded by a hundred skeletons as a lowbie.
---
Of course a fact can be pedantic.  I don’t think you can be pedantic without using facts, otherwise it’s a matter of opinion or just plain wrong.  Oh god, did you just set me up to be pedantic?
---
If only there was a place where things like this were saved...   like an archive of things on the web.  A web archive, of sorts, or a machine that could bring you way back...
---
How is your gold shire not full of half naked night elves dancing?
---
This is not in p1
---
They made it 1 skeleton per player, resurrecting a second time replaces the first skeleton, they didn't completely remove skeletons.
---
Straight up false info to create drama.
---
More like silver. Gold is hard to come by in vanilla
---
Because we now have automated systems to punish them for doing\saying stupid shit, if ur afraid to say something its probably because its not a good thing to say, and it never was, it just was easier to get away with it before.
---
Majority of our moderation team is EU based. The ‘Americas’ servers also encompass two continents. We just understand that the surveys give a small, very biased, look into the demographics and shouldn’t be taken to heart.
---
SkeramSquad!
---
I like you thinking outside of the box. Now one with Druids. Now one with Shamans.
---
yeah dude ur right lets remove a game mechanic because 1 person out of 100 might do something that offends 1 person out of 100. top meme
---
Your good friend Fabian here!
---
First you might want to learn how to sniff traffic because it doesn't look like you can get 2 simple web requests out of the downloader. Actually these two (First on is a simple version check, second one is the nice HWID that is being sent to create the PC bound sandbox for you) which is actually stated by the accept/decline window on first launch.
---
Just in case you are still trying to remove these checks inside the sandbox and fail because your skills are basically non existent here is a help picture that shows the 3 functions that check against the sent HWID. These are called at different places (really simple stuff)
---
For people who don't understand what is REALLY going on here: The thread creator seems to be mad that he got banned from our discord after shit talking too much and not being able to share the sandbox with others since it's HWID bound. In addition to that it looks like that he can't accept the fact that he isn't able to remove these checks because it's packed with an obfuscator.
---
His screenshot on virustotal shows a random tool that is/contains a crypto miner. He just edited some values like the file name file size, etc. to match his sandbox download so it looks like it contains some tools like that. IT DOES NOT of course. You can ask all normal not mad users that will prove that with their own scans :)
---
Info about the download server for the sandbox: It's failing in pretty many cases at the moment because we got flooded with requests (thousands at once) instead of the usual few and we are still getting pretty much in (not that much tho). Not sure where these came from...
---
A fix for that and a sandbox update will be released together with that later.
---
Back then when we started the sandbox downloader one of the other admins nevo wrote a nice 'blog post' about it to tell you why etc.
---
Here is the picture: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/270637902885552141/613533862219481110/Y9JVKNI.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/270637902885552141/613533862219481110/Y9JVKNI.png)

I mean, I used to game for 16 hours a day for literally years straight, now I work 10-12 hours a day working construction, and if I had the choice, I'd *much* rather be gaming all day long instead of busting my ass.
---
If it was terrible and awful, they'd go get a normal job and not push themselves to silly extremes for views to support themselves.  The fact that people do that shit on the regular tells me it isn't as awful as their fans love to jump to their defense and say it is.  I'm not saying its "easy", because I certainly don't have the personality to build and maintain a following, but don't sit here and tell me that playing video games all day long is somehow a difficult job.
---
I don't think so. I followed a guide and didn't mess around much on nost and it took me 6 days to get to 44 and they call like 42 the halfway point.
---
Lol iron grenades are the most impactful engineering item and they're daaaamn cheap
---
Not accurate for Classic though. Itemization isn't as bad. In PVP 1.12 talents are stupidly better for Lock. With 16 debuffs they get the spriest debuff they didn't until much later. But yes, Locks sucked until later in real vanilla. Also Peach seems to be one of the only WoW streamers/content creators with any ethics whatsoever so a good vid.
---
Make a female Orc Rogue, they're not oversized or too wide. Plus there's one in the lore already. :D
---
I never knew you could get so many of my fav songs just by knowing my wow race (tauren)
---
No they can’t barge in and show up because that’s common decency and enshrined in law in some places. Landlords surely can come and go through their property at will at any tome. You don’t “own” the apartment just because you’re renting it.
---
If your landlord for example wants to come and take pics for example of the house or something they can do so.
---
Their reasoning was lame, gold sellers don't even use skeletons to write messages, they use unreleased bodies. At least I've never seen skeletons used.
---
Edison was 541 but the most was 551. I say was because I'm about to hit 566 in roughly 10 hours. check my profile for more info ^^
---
So, to add to the earlier point. They started doing legendaries that individual raiders/players could obtain by doing basically all of the expansions storyline content and most or all of the raid tiers. 
---
Those were available in MoP and WoD. 
---
So they kinda moved it from the model that could be exploited by split raiding, to one that assumed every raider would have their legendary by, say, the middle of the third raid tier. 
---
Of course they then turned that system up to 11 in Legion, and just made Legendaries drops. Then balanced around that. 
---
So, yeah. It feels like they’ve tried a lot of solutions for the problem Aquatic pointed out above. They’ve all kinda failed.
---
Thanks man, was a lot of fun to make too lol.
---
It adds more flair to your guild's Rag kill screenshot.
---
Classic and Vanilla aren’t the same game.
---
You can't summon people into instances in classic from what I heard.
---
Why the hell was mankrik’s wife named ‘beaten corpse?’
---
bgs aren't until phase 3, with av and wsg
---
I thought the layers were confined to specific servers. The way you explain it is that you can end up cross realm. Is this true?
---
Removing it is far easier. I'd rather they not spend the time and money going overboard "fixing" it. This time and money is better spent elsewhere.... Like you know, working on P2 or spinning up more servers.
---
Eh i think its just because those realms came out first.
---
If you don't find anyone here throw a blessing or heal on someone people will flock to you lol took me like 5 mins on stress before I had someone invite me and we went all the way to 15 chatting and chilin , warriors are just waiting to snag you up
---
It seems most people have forgotten Diablo immortal and the other bad bee’s knee’s activision blizzards been up, and are now to willing to forgive because of classic, its not even out yet, still they now seem to have infinite goodwill again
---
Nah, its likely because desecrating corpses is considered sacrilegious in China, so [its been censored in Retail Chinese Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/49x7m0/chinese_wow_censorship_comparisonlots_of/).
---
Tencent owns a 5% stake in Activision, but *Im sure* this is all just total coincidence ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Id disagree.
---
Part of the reason I like Transmog in retail WoW is that I can show off old accomplishments.
---
For example, my Mage Tower transmog, or my tier 3 (BMAH not original naxx)

---
**About Us:**
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players with high-end experience from Vanilla, private servers, retail, and  every expansion in between. We’ve played many MMO's at all levels of dedication and leadership and look forward to returning to the MMO that has defined our gaming experience. We continue to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together to establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Mission:**
---
Our primary goal is to establish an organized raid core capable of clearing content quickly and enjoyably. Our member expectations and in-depth plan for Classic can be found at [http://celestialborn.com/charter/](http://celestialborn.com/charter/).
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesdays:  6-10pm PST
---
Wednesdays:  6-10pm PST
---
Wednesdays will be eliminated as much as possible in early phases.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details within Charter).
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions, including non-raid core members whom prefer our environment but may not fit perfectly due to experience or schedule.
---
If you are interested in learning more please refer to our website at [http://celestialborn.com](http://celestialborn.com/).
---
Thank you and best of luck in your search for the perfect guild!
---
This just makes me so sad that this even exists.
---
What a friggin joke LOL.
---
Then just include them yourself.
---
How much
---
I heard him mention something about “tips magic sugar” on his stream.
---
As someone that will main a druid, stop. Roll for your role. Think about how ridiculous it is that one person can roll on three sets of gear just because they *could* use it. The only instance I would be ok with this is if the group knows before hand. For example, the same druid tanking but rolling on offspec items.
---
I don't really understand this change. Whenever gold farmers spelled things out, they didn't use corpses. They just died and then didn't resurrect, logged out, and the body would still be there. Even with this change it's still going to be possible for gold farmers to spell out whatever they want to say because the bodies stay.
---
You need to bite the bullet and roll the illustrious mythological female dwarf rogue
---
Play what you want.
---
u/vaendryl LOL yeah...definitely one in the same...but at the same time...it WAS the current president that said we don't want classic wow...
---
"yOu ThInK yOu Do BuT yOu DoNt"
---
What exactly is he talking about?  Sandbox downloader?
---
 whatever makes them have fun
---
Tfw you go arms omegalul
---
Leave him be. He just wants to play like you and me. Go and roll on asmongolds server if you wanna join someones fanclub
---
RFK &amp; RFD are okay, little bit samey to me (especially when you've been doing Scarlet Monastery around the same time).
---
RFC is going to be a wake-up call for Retail nublets!! Lots of packs that require delicate pulls + a few patrols.
---
I personally run Sunken Temple as little as possible, it's a long maze and not all that interesting.
---
Maraudon is a treasure, easily top 3 dungeons of Vanilla. You'll love it.
---
Thought they scrapped it
---
that's the thing, giving money over with nothing being exchanged is a red flag for the CSMs
---
they're going to look into these easy cases, see that the one person transferred a large amount of gold in retail, and got gold in classic and ban both seller and buyer
---
at the very least they'll suspend the accounts and ask the perpetrators to explain themselves
---
Should be on twitch app under classic.
---
&gt; Having to transfer layers to group up with a player
---
This is done automatically. I'll concede it's strange (immersion breaking) to phase if you accept an invite.
---
&gt;having less players roaming the open world initially, 
---
Each layer apparently has the same number of players as a vanilla server. So this is a non-issue.
---
&gt; where you may cross paths with someone in a non-layered server, but never seem them with layering
---
As above, if you consider your "layers" (each the size of a vanilla server) as separate servers... The player you never see due to layering, you would have never seen because they were on a different server. With layers, you are able to interact with them via chat and then party. With separate servers, that would be impossible (in vanilla).
---
Which means limiting skeletons to 1 per player, as they did, does literally nothing to help this problem.
---
Almost 10 years of playing Vanilla between retail Vanilla and pservers, and I've *literally never* seen anyone spell out things with skeletons.
---
It's done with unreleased corpses, not skeletons.
---
Typically a single level 1 character is made, named "Iloveurmom" or something, and ran to the opposing capitol and killed in mid-air.
---
It's really simple. Over the years people have become emboldened to act like douches to random people on the internet, mostly influenced by even bigger douches.
---
The likelihood that you ran into toxic assholes in Vanilla was fairly small. The likelihood that you run into shitheads today is a near certainty.
---
The likelihood that someone bothers to carve out a swastika with dead bodies in orgrimmar in 2004 was next to 0. The likelihood today is a near certainty. Being a shithead on the internet in 2019 is seen as "cool," in 2004 it was just an inside joke.
---
There are two **fucking enormous** examples of the change in culture on this very sub. 
---
A) the overall desire to avoid streamers like a plague (because of their following), and
---
B) blizzard's unwillingness to allow people to easily carve out dumb shit with dead bodies/skeletons
---
It's not a huge leak? Gold in retail doesn't create gold in classic.
---
It was addressed in the AMA.  
---
Newsflash:  People bought gold in Vanilla.  Gold farmers were in Vanilla.
---
My memories about heroics being hard was literally at launch when everyone was a fresh 80.
---
Hold on, so we get promised a bunch of free guides and stuff, he has a patreon and hes profiting off of a 24/7 stream with thousands of viewers, and he just wants to capitalize old guides he has had up for 13 years just because of classic launch? And I thought I liked Joana. Thats fine there are other websites and ingame addons with better guides anyway
---
any working for classic?
---
finishing up ni no kuni 2 atm, it's pretty great if you like jrpgs/farming shit/fairy tale style story. Tons of great solo games exists tbh. 
---
I also strongly recommend Amid Evil if someone wants a fast fps before doom eternal drops.
---
before i got a desk pc i used my laptop as the second monitor, and my real monitor as the main one, never really liked laptops keyboard anyways.
---
It’s open heart isn’t it? Insurance never covers enough it seems, and then he’ll be laid up a while after. I agree with you. Five bucks is chump change; don’t pay if you don’t wanna. That all these people are reading it/want it for free means there’s demand for it lol... god forbid they pay for the service, though.
---
Because the debuff limit is just that; a limitation.  Raids were designed with that limit in mind.  The game was not designed with wall jumping in mind, that is a bug.  It’s pretty simple stuff.
---
Looks great! Too bad it's such an unfinished zone. Lots of potential.
---
you have to draw the line somewhere and hunters use all the stats on truestrike and even if the item is a little better itemized for rogues the difference isn't as substantial as HOJ
---
To save money.  Point blank.  Activision Blizzard is going through a cost-cutting phase, and it's less expensive to dynamically spin up/spin down instances of the game world to meet demand than try to maintain a larger number of discreet realms.
---
It is not because they don't want to have to merge dead servers later on.  If a server is dead, who cares if it gets merged?
---
They're real. They're not mine, but they're real.
---
One might even call it a neutral thing &gt;.&gt;
---
But we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, like world PvP which can utterly upset and dismay some people.
---
He makes good content and deserves the income from this.
---
Just wish it wasn't a subscription model... I'd gladly pay some flat price.
---
Geeze that was painful to watch. Kinda hard to believe that guy was a dev...
---
Yes those were. They are very low that’s the only way I’m going to be able to play.
---
There were definitely shamans and druids that tanked all 5 man content quite successfully, however, 5 paladins feels like it brings all the gimp aspects of prot and ret out of the dark. This of course sadly wouldn't be good with raiding, but i feel like it could really stomp 5 mans with every improved blessing and aura, and having vindication, crusader, light and wisdom on target, whilst it barely effecting anyone personal rotation. I don't think I have seen it before, and am kind of considering playing 5 pallies over a warrior. 
---
Would pre raid BiS 5 boxing dungeons yield insane gold per hour?
---
Same , do like me tho excercise and tire yourself out enough to sleep it'll pass time sleeping and your body won't go into shock when u don't leave your computer for days
---
There’s always going to be somebody that out gears you unless you’re one of the few no-lifers in R14 gear. Fortunately I am rolling mage which isn’t super gear dependent to be effective.
---
The world first is probably going to be a team of people account sharing...
---
Well, I will freely admit I haven’t tried lol.
---
Blizz come on find a way to make it work
---
&gt;  There was a map that showed it to be a level 60 zone with a raid inside it aswell and with named locations, can't find it again though so it was probably faked
---
Most likely. If you check Hayven games YouTube footage of the ED map files in game, I don’t think you’ll find anything resembling an actual raid instance. 
---
&gt; its just speculation that it would be used as a level 60 area
---
Yes. Metzens comments indicate that. 
---
&gt;However what this dev says doesnt quite match what Metzen says though https://clips.twitch.tv/HumbleObservantLegWoofer
---
1) Nothing about that statement indicates it would have been a level 60 zone. Quite the contrary. He basically says that when you died you would have gone there and basically been stuck. 
---
2) I’d love to see some official documentation of that actually being a planned idea. Just because it seems so bad from a gameplay standpoint. Especially with classic. A new player would get stuck in the Dream like 10 minutes after logging in. That’s not a realistic gameplay option.
---
3) What he mentions was never in the FFAlpha, or the Beta. So. Clearly it was scrapped early.
---
4) Really go back and listen to what he says. It’s more of a “we’re drunk at 4 am and it sounds good. Then you wake up...” idea. I legitimately doubt it went past the (passes the blunt) “cool idea bro” stage in that format. 
---
So. I tend to believe Metzen in this case
---
It was hilarious to watch in Ironforge.
---
More layers than a lasagna lmaooo
---
I heard that 10% of the gold you make in retail goes to your classic character if the name is the same.
---
Same! I‘m so glad I have to work so much this week to keep my head somewhere else.
---
lol I have and I will, thanks for the ignorant comment though :)
---
Because nobody wants to play with fucking streamers. This isn't a goddamn surprise!
---
Wow, what a lazy ass excuse.
---
It felt so good to free up the ssd😄
---
&gt; https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0  
---
It was apparently patch 1.12.  So August 22 2006- basically 4 months of WoW's 26 month life had it as a one-handed weapon (as opposed to main hand only).  
---
Honestly, that does make a better argument for giving it to a rogue- but I doubt it would be BiS, especially over weapons that don't require not having a top tanking weapon for your guild.
---
I read a few weeks ago that it's going to be the watered down version that doesn't have the summonable giants.  It'll be a race to the final boss.
---
They already explained why they don’t want to merge realms, have you read the AMA?
---
&gt; Truth here: I never did any single raid in BfA in normal or heroic or even mythic difficulty. But I did each of them in LFR. How am I even supposed to be motivated to do them in Normal or Heroic if I can simply experience all of that content and get the transmogs by pugging it with the click of a button
---
I mean the only reason i raid mythic is for the fun and challenge of it and not the gear.
---
You certainly wont get any challenge from LFR.
---
Dead baby jokes were standard. Being called racial and sexual slurs on voice chat was a daily occurrence. The internet is far more tame now, due to corporate control.
---
yeah, thing with this weapon is that no1 wants it, i remember when it dropped and no1 wanted it so i thought hell why not. most ppl just settle on bre/ashkandi, or later on dark edge of insanity/might of menethil.
---
But that wasn't the answer they gave.
---
I was torn too. Ultimately I’m going to do both, but I’m going to work on a Mage first. My reasoning is that it’s a strong class in Classic all around. Viable in both PVE and PVP. I can travel the world of Azeroth swiftly with teleportation, and can help my teammates so the same with portals. Speaking of portals, I can make some extra gold from tips by providing them to players. I’ll have Slow Fall, which will help in the overworld and eventually Arathi Basin. Can conjure food and water so I’ll never run out, and can save gold by not having to purchase it. Polymorph is an amazing crowd control ability, and other abilities allow for minor CC and thus being able to escape close calls. Tailoring is a big money maker and directly benefits mages by providing really strong gear near end game. Farming will be easier. Raid wide Intellect buff. Easy to level with AOE grinding.
---
Bonus if you have wow dreams but you'll be depressed when you wake up
---
You should have listened to this angry child.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMp-DjAjuAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMp-DjAjuAI)
---
Gonna need more than 7 days without account swapping.
---
Is this their reasoning for why they won't implement it? If so that's absolutely ridiculous. Is this really the world we live in? Where people are afraid of someone getting offended for spelling something naughty out of skeletons? fuck me man what the fuck
---
Precisely!
---
It's not a leak at all. The gold on classic is not being manufactured out of thin air. Somebody earns that gold and chooses to trade it to somebody else.
---
And you could have chosen to address it in that person's thread but clearly you wanted attention.
---
The only way I see polls working is for major updates, and even then the desicion should not come down to the poll, and ultimately still decided by the devs. It can at least be a good tool to gauge interest in certain areas, but should not be beholden to the result.
---
The issue with gold selling is it creates a market for gold farmers (non-players who create gold but don't spend it) who impact the total supply of gold.
---
Making a trade between retail and classic does not impact the total supply of gold.
---
not really that hard just make a rogue and and stealth in some high spot near the spawn to watch the players login, and get some ppl talking sht.
---
but u forgot they are doing that Las Vegas 24/7 streaming of worlds firsts race
---
&gt;  It's all about transparency otherwise your a bit of a ninja. 
---
Yup as long as people say what they intend to roll on before the run it's all good. I have no problems with someone creating a group and saying "items x y z are reserved" or whatever. Ok cool, don't want to join most probably but since it was clear I have no hard feelings at all. 
---
 If however it is stated when I have traveled to the dungeon, or even worse halfway into the dungeon then I would consider it extremely bad behavior. Would leave right then and there. If items are reserved or people are rolling outside their role then it should be stated right away at the invite phase. Unusual loot rules should be stated to those joining the group without them having to ask about it.
---
Go Herod
---
Wait, its a terrible idea to release a version of the game loved by like 100x more people than vanilla?
---
I’m curious to find out! Let me know!
---
Clicking on the map vigorously to move for hours because I only ever played Runescape before...
---
I was a very sad kid thinking my shiny new game was broken before it even started.
---
2 boxing a priest/warrior, will be farming the cindercloth cloak and 53 then will farm the crusader enchant. Once that's done I'll grab any willing DPS and start farming the shit out of/leveling to 60 in BRD
---
H O LY FU CK
---
I agree, I was calling them out on their bullshit, not defending them.
---
Didn't notice a tl;dr. So what are they selling?
---
Seriously.
---
That's what I thought too, but the event only runs from Aug 26th to Sept 2nd.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room)
---
you can see what they look like here
---
In the name of babying the players we can’t have skeletons lmao. Who knew, a skeleton can be used to spell out hate speech so we are going to limit skeletons. This is hilarious.
---
Or you can do stuff at the menu to refresh it so it doesn't time you out.
---
Lol, could you imagine.
---
Anyone interested in watching it is going to be busy playing the game.
---
Your right it doesnt create more gold, but it doesn't stop people from trading gold in one game for gold in another, which in itself, is buying gold outside of the game. The last thing we need is the gold sellers finding different ways of getting it around. If the example i put above rings true, then the race to farm gold for classic has already begun.
---
Redbull streaming world first level Sixtyne.
---
i always liked the feeling when you enter places like blackrock mountain and there was justa ton of skeletons and it made you hope that theres an alliance group rather than a horde one.
---
You think you do...
---
#GANK GANK GANK
---
Well that fuckin blows.  That was primarily the whole reason I was even going to level.  Classic AV was the absolute shit.  Now... Boss Race Time?  God have mercy.
---
No Skeletons.  No AV.  What else?  Realm Transfers next month?
---
yea maybe in 2005, it's 2019 most of our computers are monumentally better than what we had in 2005
---
Got mine approved the first business day after launch.
---
Mine was Nightblade. Just outside of Booty Bay, on the coast from a naga. I was stunned. When epics were epics.
---
Isn’t that pretty subjective? Female orc rogues in tier gear look kind of bad ass.
---
&gt;Like this we avoid two things:
---
thinning out the vanilla playerbase
---
creating another loot spiral that people have to chase
---
Adding new content at the lvl 60 cap would do both of those things. 
---
I don't want classic to be changed so I would 100% quit at the announcement of new content. New content would also create another loot spiral because gear is going to get crazy at lvl 60.
---
Any server is gonna have more than enough horde and alliance on launch
---
Whoever said NE wasn't the best choice for a priest was wrong.
---
God I hate org so much. I wish horde had alliance cities so badly. Stormwind music and ironforge bridge are what I need (just without all the alliance).
---
Why would that affect non-Chinese versions of the game? There have always been differences in the Chinese versions and they have never affected other versions.
---
can't remember seeing it, no
---
I'm rolling Horde on Blaumeux. It says "Low" pop now, but people on other servers will get sick of the queues and hop onto low servers like this one. Some people can't get over the name. They're calling it "Blow me" lmao.
---
What is this, BFA?
---
Damn, feels like it’s rare for people to admit they were wrong like this. Respect
---
There's no gems in Classic!
---
Roll on Skeram
---
If you're really, really, really nice to them and you show up to all the raids... you just might!
---
Wow
---
what's up with this /u/joana_wow
---
How come some neckbeards in a Russian basement can run a server with 10,000 people and no layer shards, and they can manage the skeletons fine?
---
I did address it in that thread. i was able to have a decent discussion with him about the matter. I feel that this particular issue does need more voices talking about it though. I dont want attention, i want a discussion. Im willing to have that with you if you're willing too.
---
This strawman is hilarious.
---
ThErE wErE aSsHoLeS iN 2004 tOo!
---
Yeah, and now there's more of them, and they are everywhere. People weren't making swastika's with dead bodies in 2004 in WoW. They would be today. It's not fucking rocket science.
---
Maybe if you're constantly on the target, but when you're only catching them in bits, windfury has way more potential to get cooldowns
---
you guys really worried about fps of some corpses on this 15 year old graphics game
---
Where we’re going, you don’t need resources.
---
You need neckbeards.
---
But you can't do this without flyhacking. Theres no way to line up skeletons like that in a city without falling to your death in a perfect scripted location with a hack tool.
---
And if people are spelling things with corpse character names, they can be reported just the same as anyone elses bad name.
---
The best part was... many times their body would clip a tiny piece of the mountain sticking out and they would die and their body would stay there. When they tried to run back to their body, they would jump off the cliff but end up flying way past their body and not being able to rez. Then they were stuck in ghost trying to climb a mountain to their body which was impossible, so they would need to contact a GM to get a reset or run all the way to a different zone along the water in spirit mode... Man that was evil... ;)
---
Oh right I heard about that but don't really care lol. I was thinking more like how they do Arenas in tournaments with overhead view camera would make for easier access to any zone.
---
Player A is buying gold from Player B in retail.
---
Player B is buying gold from player A in classic.
---
They're both buying gold from 3rd party source each in their respective games.
---
Wait why not?
---
Yeah it's going to happen and it doesn't matter.
---
requires dire maul
---
I get that, because I suppose I'm in the same boat. I love playing video games and hanging out with my wife and drinking. That's.... pretty much it. I cannot stand the twitch chat culture and the people that it entails. I'm not gonna say MonkaS every time something happens in game. I see you're more coming from a "this is a dream for me, and that's all" type of vibe. I actually don't think I'd want to do it anyways. It would literally take the actual fun out of the thing that I do for enjoyment because it would turn it into a "job" and more of a "this is what I do today" type of thing.
---
If only there was a market for early 30's gamers that have lives and social skills amirite?
---
”here roach” fick
---
7-8 days was the average for normal leveling. 10 was slower and people who would help out things out of their way often, etc.
---
D:
---
People can deal with it or transfer if and when that option comes.
---
They have asked repeatedly for people to leave full servers, it's not up to them to cater to you at this point.

It has no effect on the economy at all. There is no inflation of the amount of gold because it isn’t farmers out farming gold 24/7 involved in these trades artificially inflating the economy. It’s merely transferring gold from one regular player to another.
---
I rather read about classic than play another game.
---
I believe it was in the game up until WoTLK, so you might still be able to obtain it in BC depending on how Blizz implements BC. (which it's looking more and more like they're going to do)
---
When I started my current job I told them I needed it off and it was a condition of my hire.

you right tho

The issue is that its being paid with for currencies outside of the game. Gold stays on server yes, but the items being traded for them are not. this is not equivalent exchange

Transmog shouldn't exist in classic, but it sucks earning Bloodfang, thinking it's the best looking gear, and then half to switch to the shitty ass looking AQ gear

So yeah, all.

daoc was more free-form

thottbot was just starting to establish itself when wow came out i think. it was hard to get information about things in daoc. you just kinda winged it mostly

Females cast left handed and males cast right handed... As a righty, I can't long term have a left handed casting animation lol. Small quirk but something to gnaw on.
---
Youre right. The way my guild is setting it up (im the GM) is that one of my officers will host the guild bank. That officer is someone i know personally and can get face to face with if theres an issue. The way we will manage our guild bank is when our bank officer logs on he will screen shot the bank and post it in the bank page of discord. They will then do what they need. Log the changes in the bank channel. Ans post another picture of the bank afterwards. This still leaves potential for missuse but its our best/only option in classic. Anyone that needs something will put a request in through discord and it will get mailed or traded. Anything that needs to be on the guild bank will get mailed. Like i said its not as good as a legitimate bank but thats classic

I also love the idea of having achievements in Classic. I always play a game I already like longer if there are good achievements.
---
No, but there was some indication that they may have been working on it, and that it may have originally been slated as Vanilla content.
---
Just a heads up my brother printed me the same Keychain and the pointy tip poked me in the leg constantly and after about a month and a half, the keyring part of the print broke off
---
Which is what their post pretty clearly said you can't.

Those on Grobbulus can role play being sad and alone!
---
We are hoping that an addon will be made to automatically log the guildbank changes etc
---
How so?
---
Questie works
---
It is exactly what the name implies, it is a sandboxed server for classic wow (or ptr / retail) that allows you to enter a empty world without any npc's, etc... very useful to test addons etc...
---
But gold is not harder to acquire in classic. The server economy places gold at a certain value based on where the content is and play activity on the auction house. Gold is easy to acquire in at Classic. You just kill things, you grind. Now it is more monotonous then in current retail, where you have daily quests and Dungeons and retail tokens and whatever else.
---
But each server places gold at a certain value and no matter what server you are on acquiring gold has the same difficulty, how much time you choose to put into it.
---
El's Extreme Anglin' can't be beat as a fishing guide. It's been revived.
---
Skeram is almost 70% Horde based on Discord and Forum numbers... fuck that. I rather take a que than deal with an imbalanced server.
---
Well best of luck brother! I applaud your level of dedication. OSRS has been very very fun, but as I sink further into endgame I dislike the repetitive actions less and less, as it becomes less and less rewarding.
---
That being said, I actually like certain aspects of it much more like being able to afk things, and play from my phone.
---
Thats not an issue, nor what im pointing out. the trading of gold from players in retail for the gold in classic is the issue.
---
Yes!
---
How can that possibly matter?  He could trade me a stack of iron bars for a gold and immediately delete the iron bars and the goods have just left the server.
---
You are just looking for things to cry about.
---
Yeah I'd consider a flat fee but not a subscription.  Certainly put a lot of effort into the guides though so don't have any issue with him asking for $$$
---
Agreed, fellow Chinese citizen. Skeletons are not good for the public.
---
best thing is to wait, i bet that they will ad a lot more servers in launch day, pick the least populated one to avoid infinity queues later on.
---
They've already said why they aren't and it's a 100% valid reason.
---
You forgot cosplayes, reposting fanart and gf did this thing.
---
Game devs and society not bitching about hate speech or negative messages was part of vanilla wow, what happened to #nochanges?  How come its acceptable to change skeletons?  The implications of the answer they gave to the skeletons persisting question shows that this will not be classic wow chat that brought long nights of trash talking entertainment, this is going to be the same sodomite loving modern circus blizzard of retail that is going to police what adults type on the internet.
---
Nice.
---
Adolf Hitler impersonating J. Allen Brack? Good job on this one.
---
Because people are lazy. Everyone can just type in the filehash on virus total to check the scan. Then they would see that the filehash does not exist. Many people probably don't know that they can do that. 
---
In general every virus total screenshot without a link to the actual scan is super suspicious.

Go to Skeram Alliance

Yep lol, I even made a reddit account for wow classic something I said I'd never do.

&gt;That's really, really, really sad that you gain happiness from ruining other peoples enjoyment. But there are many pathetic souls like yourself around these days.

Haha! This was 15 years ago, but sure, thanks! Also, I was 100% the biggest PvP griefer on my server. Whether you were horde or alliance, I was able to kill you.

It looks like an upside-down hippo face.

Lol it’s a game this is the reason why people do it for the reaction git gud
---
Just make the skeleton limit 3 per player. Not enough to spell anything, but enough to give a sense of carnage in STV.
---
You only need to level once to 20 and you can write whatever you want. You’re crazy of you think chinese gold sellers wont do this.
---
Method announced a 7 day stream to world first downing rag and ony.
---
They are very coordinated, but they probably need a full day at 60 to get attuned, gear/consumables, and get through the raid content.
---
Great Idea, pretty much any resources collected before the event cant go towards the total.
---
Ran a [Malwarebytes scan](https://imgur.com/a/npgorzr) which only found the adwares Whiteclick and Microleaves. I much doubt these are related. If others that used the Arctium downloader/server/launcher could provide reports with what their scans found on their PC, we could start mapping this out to check for possible patterns.
---
Bro I envy you. I wish I could experience it all again for the first time. I suggest only looking things up if you get stuck, I know in osrs min/maxing is the way to go but in WoW you don’t lose out on much efficiency by having fun
---
It looks to me like that is what they are saying.
---
eDPR?
---
I definitely miss vanilla, but my favorite Era was WotLK. Honestly, anything before the shit show it has become is fine with me.
---
Well bad news, in the next few weeks at least, every server currently created for classic will be high pop and will have a wait time to get into. The only ones that won't have a wait will probably be the ones that blizzard has to create the day of
---
Couldn't they just spin the skeletons orientation and randomly place it somewhere nearby so people can't spell anything out with them?
---
thanks for the tone argument!

honestly it wont matter when the Hunter rolls on it all. so you'll get nothing and the hunter will enjoy that staff with +int and spell power.

---
We are all patiently awaiting the release to find out how it pans out and you take joy in believing Blizzard will make you wait hahah.  They CAN have the ability to open up the server as wide as they want, so I dont see them not scaling up on launch.  No one is waiting to get onto the same layer, you dont see that?
---
True. I've been deep in multiple gaming communities and everywhere I've gone I've always seen BM as bad manners. Been using the phrase "that's so bm" for years now.
---
Gotta sucker their followers into thinking this is a real 'world first' to get those advertising/sponsor bucks. 
---
Unless Blizzard has completely changed the abilities of every boss in classic the real world first rests with the guilds who spent tons of gold on repair bills while having to come up with the strategies and discover the items needed for every boss fight in classic. Someone coming in using their strategies and claiming a 'world first' just because it attracts attention for $$$ seems pretty pathetic.
---
Relax man
---
If they even breathed on this question, there would be 100 Youtube videos with baseless speculation that they now have to contend with.

wrong. while they may have been paygated in vanilla, they were certainly free as long as 5-6 years ago when nostalrius launched.

I’d like to see a different route taken after classic. A whole new expansion without flying mounts and not go the way of TBC. (Even though I enjoyed TBC)
---
I mean yeah without those 2 things specifically then it won't even be the same game! Literally everything else about it isn't worth experiencing because of those things
---
/s
---
It was also annoying though going into org and seeing WWW.BUYMMOGOLD.COM spelled out in front of the bank/ah
---
Racials are actually impactful in classic, well most of them are, Starshards isn't.
---
Just like the devs said, they'll follow the community closely, so I imagine if the community wants Classic+, we'll get Classic+.
---
It's still so far out so I won't put too much thought on it.
---
So what do we need to do to rally together and change their mind? Reddit post or official forums?
---
&gt; edit: ok i get it all the servers will prob have a long q, but I'm currently on a high pop and I'd move to a lower pop one.
---
I don't think you're understanding still. Every server will have a high pop. They're whole goal is to not create dead servers, so they're going to have too little instead of too much. You won't have a good idea on server population until a month or two passes
---
So did my first guild.  The leadership raided Strat, UBRS, ect... to practice raid leadership, organization, execution and just see if there was anything they needed to change(or people that really stood out as needing to be addressed) while we were gearing for MC.  I remember being lucky enough to win the roll for briarwood reed in a raid in UBRS
---
After having to quit due to school and then later coming back I rerolled on Horde on one of the last new realms to come out.  It was around when Naxx came out and you could no longer 40 man most of them.
---
Just like with the fact that we aren't getting the pre-class review talent trees and abilities for that matter(mages used to have to spec for Evo &amp; instant AE, WC was worse frostbite(slow increase only), ect...) and we are getting 1.12 AV instead of OG AV we'll have to live with 1.12 dungeon caps
---
Which is why we'll never have a true vanilla experience, RIP Barrens Chat.
---
This picture would have been relevant 2 years ago.  Not today

Looks like it's PITCHFORK TIME. Here's the thread the poster I am replying to made earlier today- https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct6o06/beware_that_sandbox_software_running_around_today/
---
Scroll down a bit and you'll see a comment from the developer explaining the whole thing, including several other comments from people who tried to replicate OP's results and couldn't, because his 'proof' is fake.
---
Level 60 and also a certain /played **at** 60 and possibly even area specific experience. 
---
ie, "should we add a new raid"
---
To vote you must have cleared bwl.
---
Or "should we add another battleground"
---
To vote you must be rank 10 or higher.
---
Whether this would tilt the game towards hardcore players or give a balances view of what the classic community wants, I don't personally know.
---
This is a huge misstep.  By far the worst way to monetize his work.

It's the fact that all the NE racials are worse than dwarves. It's not just fear ward vs starshards.

Epic , I would even laugh at myself for falling for this  it's deserved lol but only once ..

Hence why I said “legit”. I also asked if they’d be banning account sharers on the QA and never got a reply.
---
&gt;I like how you call everything I say a strawman then dO tHE coNdEsCenDinG TeXT fONt.
---
It's condescending because that's the level of respect your argument deserves.
---
Because this is the realm of law, where precise verbiage and obtuse verbiage have equal utility.
---
This goes against the entire point of classic. I guess you guys figured out a way to ruin classic, good job Activision.
---
Skeram gang! It hit medium at some point in the last few hours.. I know a few more low key streamers have moved there, and quite a few guilds as well. Spreading out will do everyone good.
---
Arms is great. Sweeping strikes is the MVP. If you have a healer you can constantly be cleaving mobs doing crazy dps
---
That's beautiful! Did you use gold foil? And what did you use for the black lines, they look so smooth and clean.
---
war effort is just a waiting game for most people anyways, they dont contribute and just wait for it to be done and the gates to open.
---
you're so nice. i would never do that. i've been clean since a couple months after blizzcon announcement. it gave me something to look forward to. and im finishing my degree in 3 semesters. everything else that was so bad in my life is pretty much all resolved too. i also kind of "woke up" and realized how many years have passed and how long i'd actually been in that dead end cycle. the biggest factor was losing the only girl i really loved. then classic gave me something to look forward to because i felt like giving up on relationships after that
---
This. Either you have to be outside the dungeon, and summon them to right outside of it, or you summon them to where you are inside the dungeon if they're zoned in. No summoning to your spot in an instance from the outside world.
---
I wanted to go NE Priest too, but ended up choosing Dwarf.  If you really want to go NE, it's for Shadowmeld, not Starshards.  Starshards is a 6 second channeled spell which is basically completely useless in PvP.  Like completely useless.  People are going to interrupt you, line of sight you, or just beat on you.  It is very good for damage per mana, but pretty bad damage per second.  On top of all this, your talents that improve your holy spells and shadow spells do nothing to help it out.
---
For PvP, yes it is THAT bad.  For PvE, you can make it work if you really want to.
---
It's for people who get mad that they aren't doing endgame 2 weeks after launch.
---
People were banned for using the Arctium custom file launcher and sniffer. There never was a ban for using the sandbox. The sandbox works without any Blizzard service (Battlenet, Warden).
---

Ye, I misspelled it intentionally

People aren't NPCs...
---
Also, what OP described is downright malicious behaviour.
---
The thing about probability is it tells you the odds you need for a 100% chance at seeing a drop, when in reality it could drop on your third run. This math is pointless, if you wanna farm it and see what the universe has in store for you, go for it - because that’s what you’re doing.
---
It’s 1 - 1/e
---
You can only auto attack with the fishing pole, no mortal strike or anything like that. It's not bad for ret pallies though, since most of their damage comes from seals/judgement/auto attack anyway, and you can still use magic abilities while using the fishing pole
---
If it’s ever regarding pvp, and orc is an option, you choose orc
---
I want to be right for all of your sakes, because if I can do it with MY hardware, then Blizz certainly can with theirs.  I definitely agree that they probably underestimated/are underestimating how many will stay to play.  So scaling up the realm hard cap was a bad idea
---
lol
---
I find Shadowmeld over Starshard more useful personally.  It seems like Starshard acts as an additional spell school in case you get locked on shadow and holy, but the damage isn't that great.
---
Uhhhh, that's a great idea.  Nice.
---

Just curious why sponsoring tips would make their race a "joke"? Last time I checked, tips wasn't a comedian.

Its not a problem, so therefore already fixed.   Stop whining.  Also, what happened to no changes?

---
Shaman tanking till 55 is a breeze.
---
Was warrior leveling really as bad as everyone says? Was a toss up between Warrior, Rogue, or Shadow Priest for me. No real plans to raid, just level and have fun gearing at 60.
---
And yet again, the fact that you "experienced" assholes seems to mean there must've been just as many and they were just as widespread!
---
/facepalm
---
No.  See, I don't actually care when anything shows up.  Just like in Vanilla.
---
Actually, that's not *quite* true.  I care when AV shows up.
---
They make a blue post the morning of a new server launch and the launch happens at 6pm Pacific time. Just keep your eyes peeled for the forum post. When Blaumeux was announced it's what I did. Deleted all three of my characters on Whitemane and zerg rushed to get my three names on Blaumeux the minute it opened.
---
Her voice is *very* recognizable from just her roles as Jackie and Meg. both series were incredibly prime time throughout NA back when television shows were the primary form of  entertainment for many households.
---
It didn't I checked. Then I asked the mod to restore my thread. Told me they only allow questions on Sunday's in a specific thread. He also wasn't entirely sure he was giving me the correct answer.
---
So not a good vibe at all and definitely room for another sub with crap like that. 
---
If you are wondering what my thread was about. I was asking questions on what version of DX Classic was running. I know it was not 12. However, I couldn't find details beyond that.
---
It definitely costed money in vanilla.
---
God, the US is such a shit hole. Get proper healthcare already.
---
BuT I wORk FuLl tIMe
---
This won't be an issue long term because it will still need to be an equivalent time trade, or close to. The time invested to farm gold in retail will be similar to the time invested to farm the gold in classic. If you knew the conversion rate you could convert farming retail gold to classic gold per hour, and then farm based on that.
---
Exactly. People keep acting like "Full" is a set limit when it's really a spectrum. Every server can be full pop but Herod is still gonna be the most fucked
---
Super welcome. I for one would subscribe to this man's newsletter if he had one, or, failing that, steal something from his underwear drawer as a memorabilia.
---
Although I want to level relatively fast, I certainly don't feel the need to spend money on a guide to do so. I'm just going to use some useful addons, try to minimise downtime, and apply what I learned playing a private server earlier in the year.
---
Let me blow your mind for a second.
---
Fishing in Classic + beer.
---
This is such a bullshit cop out excuse. "Hate speech".
---
Should we disable in game chat too? I've seen hate speech in that, too.
---
My mate got one the exact same way! He didn't even realise until I screamed and pointed it out.
---
I’ve seen no hard data provided by anyone; ergo the argument seemed anecdotal
---
&gt; But totally not looking forward to being a crayon disaster.
---
You're thinking of TBC :P
---
I seriously feel as if it was 135k just a week ago, am I crazy?
---
me too!! but i started wod and left almost instantly.
---
let us conquer azeroth for the first true time my friend.
---
#nochanges is still a thing, hence why people want skeletons like they were in vanilla.
---
no, not really. 
---
OP is full of shit because he photoshopped his picture.
---
Read the wow dev AMA. Majority of servers will have "hours" of queue times on launch day. 
---
Launching new servers post launch is a proven failure of an idea. Go take a look at Everquest, Wildstar or the hundreds of wow private servers that have failed because they underestimated popularity and created servers post launch. Players will wait in queues over re rolling their entire guild/group of friends. 
---
This isnt my opinion this is how it has happened multiple times in the past, those servers created post launch will ALWAYS be lower pop than Whitemane, Faerlina, Herod, etc and will inevitability be the first servers closed/merged. Feel free to do your own research though, there are multiple real word examples of MMO's creating servers post launch and those servers dying.
---
It's a friggen name. Jesus
---
Oh, I know this one!
---
One is sneaky.  One is ranged.
---
Looks like classic is releasing in China then.. Mobile version coming soon
---
WoW Classic*
---
But the AV is the nerfed one... so I'm actually not very excited about it. The old one was the best..
---
Oooo I see. That's a good guess!
---
Rogues have a high skill ceiling, low skill cap. You spam a couple instant attacks, stun, and hope they die or do it again.
---
Oh I have everything at 80 in XIV. But no mana is too tight in classic. And they’re 5 mans in wow.
---
Why? There is an ocean of free IN-GAME step by step leveling addons already
---
N69e
---
A+ - i laughed harder than i probably should have
---
*Slow clap*
---
are there more guides like this for other classes?
---
I believe how successful classic is will largely determine what options we'll have in terms of what comes after phase 6. If Classic does exceedingly well and brings in 3-5 million subs, then there's no reason they couldn't make new content and make Classic into its own game, rather than just replicating the past.
---
I think for Classic to be long term successful, they really do have to make it into it's own game. If we take OSRS for example, they left the game as it was for awhile, and after 5 months it lost 70% of its playbase, but as soon as they started making content for it and made OSRS its own game rather than a legacy project, the population sky-rocketed, dwarfing the launch player-base and the "modern" RS player-base.
---
Theres a post on the Skeram sub about names.
---
I do the same. Do not take it every night. Do it a week or 2 at a time at most and only use it to adjust your sleep schedule. If you constantly use it your body will eventually get used to the melatonin and you'll have even more trouble falling asleep without it.
---
I suggest picking a set time you want to sleep and as you get an hour or 2 off of that set time take the pill an hour before your original set time for a couple days ina  row and see if it adjusts your schedule back to the time you want. If it doesn't then take it for a week straight an hour before your original set time.
---
Trust me don't get your body used to melatonin nightly, use it to only adjust your sleep schedule back to what you want it to be.
---
my opinions
---
PVP: mage might have higher skill ceiling but hunters are also beasts and have a huge skill ceiling as well, both are good at solo and in groups, comes down to preference imo
---
PVE: hunters fight warriors and rogues for pre raid bis gear, but later on you wont have as much competition for gear because there wont be many hunters (tier sets)   mages are more looked for but also more mages = more competition for gear, mages perform better dps wise but you need hunters for certain things
---
40+ isnt saved there unfortunately.
---
My only issue is how pigeonholed many classes are into certain specs/roles. And increase in viability for specs beyond meme specs treated like children with special needs.
---
I think it's cooler this way, now you know a bunch of skeletons actually means there was  a giant battle and not just a few players getting camped.
---
I find shadow priest, soul link warlock, ret paladin, and arms warrior to be exceptionally easy.
---
3 names per account for early reservation
---
10 characters per server
---
50 characters per classic account
---
50 per retail account

Down vote it then up vote it. Boom.
---
Same here, surprised there aren’t more Krol blades in the comments.
---
There shouldn't be a cap on characters after launch they are doing that because of name reservations and because of bots
---
Ah excellent thanks for the info
---
The more people you have in the market the more fair priced it should be.  Arguably.

I’d expect layers to be assigned after we click Enter World, during the loading screen. Otherwise, yes.

Sorry I lack vision.

Nobody levels like that. If you arent solo youre just plain slowing yourself down.  Try fury to 40 and youll see the light. Switch when you get MS.
---
id rather wait in queue than roll on a server that will be dead by the time p2 hits and I lose all my progress, just saying, ive experienced this too many times in MMOs releases

Exactly, I was a day one WoW player back in 2004 and I seriously cannot understand why this is the hill some people are itching to die on.  I can't even remember the skeleton mechanic being meaningful other than some funny idiots spelling out simple words with corpses in Org.  Who gives a shit, really?
---
Wow, what awful sites! I can't believe sites like that exist! What are the names of these awful sites? So that I know to avoid them, of course.
---
Lol. The people from that discord are bigger scumbags than I first thought. 
---
Multiple dislike for a rather innocent commemt regarding if I personally think they can be trusted/why it’s a waste of time using that absolute garbage.
---
Id say OP was on to something in this case.
---
I understand the want to not have hate speech or advertising with corpses again, but maybe reducing the time it takes for them to despawn would be better than completely removing it.
---
Ah thank you

It sounds like its 1 player 1 corpse,  I have no problem with that.  I mean how could one person leave 10 separate skeletons across the world
---
Is Questie actually working now? I thought I remember seeing that it was working in the most recent stress test.
---
Sounds like a keeper to me.
---
That's the best part about pvp actually using spells you wouldn't otherwise and situational , only thing I can think really is if ur chilling healing refilling bars  but even then you'll need to make decisions on cleanses n stuff
---
Are you bringing back classic non armored mounts?
---
Nothing until I possibly start raiding. Then it will be DBM and possibly outfitter if I raid as a dps warrior.
---
You think half a level is half an hour's play? And I said I'm leveling a druid on the side so I'll obviously be playing another char in the downtime.
---
Warlock Mage or Warrior for me. I loved tanking in classic but want to try raid DPSing. Not sure what I want to do at this point.
---
It's certainly more productive than having a conversation with someone who constantly edits their posts. I'll have you know I wrote that comment in the spirit of camaraderie, to let you feel absolved of your unwarranted cretinous jackoff comment to AmputeeBall, but I see you don't want to be consoled here. And furthermore, a personal attack? For the record, sir, you called someone who potentially has less than four limbs a "failure."
---
First sandbox came out in 2005 didn't it?
---
 Shall see you in STV
---
haha yeah and they could even buff hybrid classes a little bit so the are relevant dps in raids, and maybe dual spec xD 
---
no LFD or LFR of course just little things like this
---
The AV bridge says otherwise.
---
I hope those of you on Grobbulus like roleplaying as sad and alone. Comedy gold!
---
Kind of a buzzkill but it 100% does. If someone cared enough, op would easily catch 3-7 days ban for this, if first offence.
---
Do you prefer priest or shaman for pvp?
---
Same. I'd poke back in every now and then with a free trial, but each time it felt so distant from what I loved about vanilla. I never felt any accomplishment or excitement earning something new. It seemed it was all just handed to me.
---
Sorry if I wasn't clear- no sign *as of now* that they're adding a new server.
---
I mean... they can see the numbers. They've known how close it was to 'full' for awhile. They keep urging people to transfer off of high population servers (did it in this AMA about a dozen times), but there aren't any options for PVE. At all.
---
could just use this. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/edit#gid=87065170
---
These are opposites. A cap and a ceiling are the same thing.
---
During vanilla a pet (hunter or lock) could kill a mob solo and the player would get xp and everything as though they killed it. This was done away with later in the game though I don’t know when. Will it be in Classic?
---
It cost money in vanilla and at one point it was made free. It's been free for quite a while and it looks like he's trying to cash in again.
---
Even though it was previously free and easily piratable I'll throw him some cash because I've definitely gotten my money's worth from it over the years.
---
Shaman for most things, Priest for the luls.
---
Totally would have loved for Druids to have play dead but only in bear and cat form.
---
Does this math include rested xp?
---
These are both... ancient wallpapers, wow. I wonder who the original creators were.
---
Oh no. That ruins the whole classic.
---
when that 1 guy in the group starts skinning the mobs before the combat is even over.
---
Classic org is comfiest org. None of that multi-level airbase shit
---
Hey, what's up, it's ya girl Danielle.
---
That's great to hear!
---
The modern neckbeard is too strong
---
Yeah I got that vibe also.
---
God I’m harder than a diamond in an ice storm with this news
---
Laughs at the question.. answers it anyways
---
No they don't. Anyone who was at Oondasta release will confirm that.
---
That's why world quests and dailies made me quit. You HAVE to log in everyday to do the same 3 quests until exalted. It turns the game into a chore. 
---
Every new patch is literally just dailies for the first few weeks until raids come out, then you gotta grind the same islands, dungeons for more azerite.
---
will warlocks be able to summon their faction members off cliffs? that was also awesome
---
*have made against it.  and the "oh remember the 2 hours looking for a group".
---
&gt;Whoever is in the lead will be sniped the most
---
How are people competing for world firsts going to get ganked that much? They'll be way ahead of the curve before anyone even gets in their zone. Anyone at their level will keep their eye on the prize, not corpse camping.
---
make it a video setting, it's purely aesthetic anyways
---
Who knows! Dungeons have a lot more XP gain than was intially expected/in private servers
---
Did you have to check each toon individually or is there another way?
---
twitter.. might have it.
---
Oh its true lol i've spent many hours in an AV match
---
White hit only arms warriorman
---
Hunter probably an overall better starter experience but mage is great too both have fun and strong pvp kits and any class can pve just fine
---
Yeah like, isn't all his best routes imported into a thousand addons by this point?
---
If assembling Atiesh really requires a C'Thun kill barely anyone's gonna have that shit again this time around unless the fight's tuned differently.
---
To give some context, there are 730 hours in a month
---
The undead male one is pretty high tier too tbh. I really like them both. It's a shame that humans need to die to have decent casting animations.
---
On what planet is 3-4 months 150+ days? lol That being said, that it can be done is not a reason to believe everyone is going to be doing it. Thinking a ton of guilds will be smashing endgame a month in is what is delusional. Some might but overall normal people work, go to school, have relationships. Yeah, the shut-ins without these concerns will go quicker, but the majority will be likely going at a normal persons pace. Because L I F E.
---
even better!
---
Thanks for clarifying for us.
---
I'm guessing the flood of requests came from people spreading it on places like this subreddit - as a method to prepare addons for classic launch.
---
I suppose the world login server is more crowded than the local server. That is how it was with the name reservation. Took me 14 minutes to get to the server and then 2 minutes to access it. Avoiding a dc is priority.
---
Comments you can hear.
---
No, they are referencing Glee.
---
Orc. Good racials; Stun reduction for PVP is huge.
---
But for me it's because they look great in all armour, big shoulders and tier sets look wicked!
---
Not for a warrior
---
What are you talking about?, You know people knew slurs back in 2004 right?
---
I shouldn’t have even brought it up due to how insignificant it will end up being. Have fun with it not affecting you. If you never cared why bother responding, what a joker you are
---
Order what it blue sits by Guild Wars 2 play alliance. Thanks
---
That means they will be put in the game at some point. They were in vanilla.
---
Except they DIDN'T do that, you still leave a skeleton and it is only removed if you die a 2nd time.
---
Tauren. More health and warstomp helps ele combo. Plus tauren subjectively looks cooler.
---
Yes. Skullflame Shield was a world epic drop in Vanilla
---
Thanks what good info, seems like pointblank aoe like frost nova and AE just have a 3 yard leeway and it isn't race based?
---
1-60 was free until today.  I don't remember him mentioning that he was going to move outside starting areas behind the paywall.
---
Oh Thank you! 👏
---
meet me at the ice cream truck i'll buy you an ice cream
---
This is hilarious I think you are correct, I should fix this haha.
---
who gives a fuck what people can do with their corpses. players can also much more easily speak hatespeech in the chat channels. 
---
and even if someone does manage to spell out the n word or something on the ground, who gives a fuck. it’s a stupid kid being a stupid kid. just ignore it and move on.
---
Ah ok good to know thank you.
---
My professional goal is to maintain my RL profession as I nose dive into the abyss that is classic wow.
---
Fair, I suppose. As someone who sees playing a pve mmo as pointless without eventually raiding, it's hard for me to remember that. 
---
Related though, on everquests progression servers, their rates of participation in raiding is FAR FAR higher than it was when current. I expect something similar to happen in wow.
---
Your delusional if you think their wont be a que for a pvp server. Especially the one that almost sounds like skyrim.
---
This time we have leveling addons so it shouldn't be too long.
---
Confirmed encouragement of breaking terms of service? Have fun in prison.
---
Blizzard said there are still skeletons though, just one per player.
---
It would be like a couple feet. It would still represent the spot you died in, but it would prevent farmers from spelling websites. Win/win.
---
Your doc has been a great study over the last months.  Thanks for the dedication.
---
Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?
---
Sandbox
---
I'm OK with this. Sure it isn't the same but it does make more sense to me.
---
You can set up keybinds either in retail and copy them over or just editing the config files manually. Just admit that people want to run/fly around the world before the game is out and don't pretend there's some other practical reason for it.
---
This would have killed the goodwill he’s spent so long fostering
---
/cheer :)
---
You ripped all this content from https://www.joanasworld.com/horde-1-12-durotar.html
---
At least credit the creator.
---
I don't know that it was called a sandbox then.  But we 100% had a "cracked" version with 0 mobs back before the open beta on original wow.
---
imagine the mental gymnastics required to convince yourself changing things is "in the spirit with nochanges"
---
Same! Although I chose to take the week after off instead. Just to avoid insane queue times, server issues etc. want allll the issues out of the way before I start my journey:)

This is Joana’s guide. Give the man credit, he deserves it.

Lmao good luck.

oof my guild is insisting on sticking with Herod and I can already see it being a nightmare
---
Keep that filth on retail mythics, vanilla isn't some E-sport like modern games revolve around
---
Same, looking forward to chasing Perd again. Praise RNGesus.
---
It’s the 27th for most of the world
---
I wouldn't say getting someone else and the map to kill someone was "you" killing them.  In fact, anyone killed by you had the headache coming to them for being so stupid.
---
Most people killed others by being better at PVP.
---
That's too bad, I remember how fun it was when I discovered you could stand on the auction house torches in Orgrimmar and make permanent auction house ghosts like "Spookyghost" "ouchitburns" and "Imonfire".
---
It's really not. Just do it in retail and copy them over.
---
Damn that was intense. Well done.
---
Literally impossible
---
I’d believe you that you were reported and never banned, but claiming you were reported 100+ times is ridiculous. 
---
Seeing as how the vast majority of people wouldn’t care enough to report, you’d have to do this to basically your entire faction to get reported that many times.
---
Between the options you gave, this is a no-brainer. Go with the Asus TUF gaming laptop. It's the only one with a discrete graphics card. Not a bad price either.
---
&gt;These are players that might be doing a quest and are in need of help, I  assist, and a new kinship is born. Now, that will never happen, all because of layering. 
---
Except of course it will, because there are still ten thousand other players on the same layer as you.
---
This line of reasoning is absurd. Do you complain about people being offline when you happen to be playing? Do you complain about all the people in the world you don't see in a given play session? Someone being on a different layer than you is functionally identical to both of those scenarios.
---
Ok. You all do that while I get a 5 minute headstart. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
fax monkey did 95\~ mobs in vanilla, I'm just aiming for 8-30, some mobs can just be walked through when you have ice barrier. When lvling my mage in a PS I was able to gather 3 lasher groups in DM and walk through them with ice barrier and survive, 3 groups, 24-36 attacks. Unless PS got the damage WAAAAAAAAAAAY off (they didn't) it will be perfectly viable, you just have to watch out for the daze mechanic, and it will be incredibly efficient if you can find the time to grind alone.
---

Gotta level them professions. Need me some potions for my warrior.

Oh great, here come the sensitive basement dwelling old people that get heart palpitations from inconveniences in an online video game.
---
The standard balance/resto pvp spec is 19/11/21. There is more points into resto (because of NS), so it's technically reasonable to categorize this as primarily a "resto" spec.
---
mongoose is not a flask, it is an elixir and you would stack that on top of all the other elixirs you would use.
---
1. Wands are hard to come by early game as not many quests offer them as rewards and your first wand a lot of times is a lucky green world drop or dungeon drop.
---
2. Wands are used in addition to staves and don’t occupy the same slot.

The shit story since WotLK is one reason I have no interest in every playing retail WoW. I considered attempting to get back into it with the launch of BFA, but reading up on the pre-BFA story and watching the cringe-y cutscenes made me give up on that idea immediately.
---
Guidelime is just a tool. You need to have a guide already and have it formatted to the addon syntax for it to display locations and recognize progress.
---
The questing adding didn’t work in a world with no NPCs to give you quests? That’s a brain buster.
---
The warlock cheat sheets keep looking better and better! Thanks for doing this.
---
Just waiting for the final revised version that is as close to ideal as is possible.
---
Classic!
---
That would be absolutely idiotic if they didn't track it by account.  I know people like to shit on Blizzard, but c'mon dude they can't possibly be that incompetent.  I am also still of the opinion that early sign ups are going to be a drop in the bucket compared to the deluge of players signing up come Monday.
---
Need someone on the other faction stealthed to make it work it's less "git gud" and more "git GM" because that is some rule breaking baddy circumventing legit PVP to exploit while cooperating with the other faction.
---
Then again, I doubt that matters to a simp.
---
It's not being "afraid" it's "not want to see". On my server gold farmers would constantly advertise their website this way. I can see how Blizzard could get sick of it.
---
Name checks out
---
If only new horde guilds join a server and ally guilds dont, the faction ratio drifts more to horde. 
---
But atm it seems that most guilds have planned to stay at Luci.
---
&gt;I wouldn't say getting someone else and the map to kill someone was "you" killing them.  In fact, anyone killed by you had the headache coming to them for being so stupid.
---
Wrong. I would duel them, beat them, then have them mind controlled by NE Priest waiting behind a rock, then I would give them 1 sinister strike and kill them completely.
---
Oh much better. Thank you!
---
Admirable, I sense you'll need all the luck you can get so... Good luck, friend.
---
Yeah. They could even go a little crazy and add an item slot or something later on. But I like the idea of quest gear.
---
I'd rather win an actual fight.
---
I really can't thank you guys enough for using it :)
---
You have a point to a degree but it would be pretty broken if guilds could just finish day one.
---
You say original experience, but getting a certain amount of a certain item isn’t an experience. The experience is the grind and activities. Doing something as a group, horde and alliance.
---

This might be it....?

Retail bad, classic good
---
Plenty of easy solutions to this, I like how you guys just pick and choose which changes you want to make to the game while trying to come off as hardline no changes.  It makes it look like you guys are losing sight of what we are trying to recreate.
---
Leaving things like aq resources alone and certain spawn locations (wife) alone with the reasoning of nochanges, yet keeping the corpses despawning, the trade delay, etc in the game as if it doesn't effect it at all... it's clear you are just taking the path of least resistance.  "If it is gonna add work and there isn't a giant uproar about it being in or out of the game, fk it, just leave it as is.", seems to be your philosophy.
---
According to  [WowLevelSpeedCalculator.com](https://wowlevelspeedcalculator.com/) I'll be 60 on my rogue in 1.5 months if I play 49hrs a week. Not sure how accurate it is, though, will be interesting to find out!
---
It's actually been one of my more productive weeks, keeping busy to make time go by. My week ends on Thursday and won't have to go back to work till the 4th
---
Back in 2005 or today? Because back in 2005, you're 100% wrong.
---
that was plan B :p
---
Sorry never saw the movie
---
The servers are going to implode because you're going to have tens of thousands of people bypassing a queue of any sort by waiting on the character selection screen.
---
This has nothing to do with layering, it has everything to do with a bottleneck of processing and loading people into a world simultaneously
---
An item slot would probably trivialise all the content unless they rebalanced every item around its existant
---

Kind of a dick move to have the guide available for years for free and then at last minute pay wall it with no additions. I could see if he created a nice addon user friendly UI, but he didn't get it done in time so instead he just throws up a pay wall to something he had for free already.
---
There was an enh shaman on stormscale that wrecked with it jn vanilla
---
I was thinking about this, sounds difficult to judge.
---
Yeah, I was watching his stream a lot lately, and whenever he's on talking to the chat he was getting a shitton of subs (although mostly prime ones) and many donations. I wonder how much it will affect those.
---
so, alt+z toggles automatically my ui whenever I enter combat and I finish my combat?
---
Sandboxing also means putting a program into a protected section of memory so other parts of your system can't see/access it, and is literally something WoW bots have done for like a decade. It's an overloaded term but he's using it correctly.

No, roll for what you are playing, not your other specs. Anyone that doesn't, is kinda a dick. If nobody wants something feel free to roll, otherwise, accept that you get as much gear as anyone else, not free reign to roll on literally anything.

HOW LOOOWWWWW CAN YOU GO
---
That is painfully pointless information. Tech geeks waste their thoughts on shit nobody else cares about.
---
He's just trolling
---
I see what the goal is, and this is where the method of macros gets a little contradictory as I understand the goal. I think you're talking about action bar slots and not keybinds. Alt-F, Shift-F, and Ctrl-F are three different key bindings, even if they only take up one action bar slot.
---
You might be able to get all your class skills in under ten key bindings, but this is Classic WoW we're talking about. Consumables, tinkets and gadgets are the meta.
---
Grenades, reflector and pvp trinkets, racials, bandages, racial abilities, ranged attack, potions, gear items like 'ornate mithril boots' and 'spider belt' or 'skull of impending doom' should all be keybound so that you don't have to move your hand or click to activate them. That's nearly 10 keybindings I just listed and that excludes any class skills or weapon swapping keybinds.
---
If the goal is to have everything keybound, then I would pass on macros. However, if the goal is to activate your skills faster and group these abilities together, then yes, macros will clearly achieve this, but either at the cost of additional keybindings or at the cost of not being able to activate abilities individually (because you didn't have room to make more keybindings)
---
The truth is that stance dancing isn't just to activate abilities only usable in other stances, but it is also for the passives bonuses. The difference between being in zerker stance and defensive stance with a shield is ~30% damage mitigation, and it only takes one second to put a shield on and switch to defensive stance. One second, and you are taking 30% less damage (or 20% if it's only spell damage). That is HUGE. Considering that the main way warriors win is by outlasting their opponents (see: Laintime). 
---
I hope you see my point here

That was an issue on a private server.  I believe it was Nost where they had to reduce the amount of skeletons.  It shouldn't be a problem for Blizzard's servers.
---
Droods demand respect
---
Just need MMO glider to come back and I’m gonna be good
---
99% of people posting here never played real vanilla and only private servers but act like they know everything. The guilds that play P servers basically do it in greens and other garbage gear. AFAIK they dont even use resist gear.
---
We will finally see if we were bumbling morons for using resist gear and actually having to gear classes in stuff other than crap quest greens. I don't see how potting up fully negates that stats you'd get from gear and still allow them clear stuff. I hope we see guilds getting destroyed in raids because they thought they could just zerg it in greens because that's what they did on private servers. I played private servers and thought they were utter garbage. They looked and smelled like vanilla wow but that's where it ended.

Is it confirmed what phase fishing pools will be introduced? Is there guides anywhere as to where to catch special fish before the introduction of pools?

---

---
Nice downvotes ;P
---
It's common sense, and basic math you can do off the top of your head, casters have HUGE manapools in Naxx, and many consumables, you don't want more mana regen you want more damage.
---
Keep in mind mana regen is absolutely useless until you pass the threshold where you are actually using mana regen'd from the staff, that means unless the 20 spell power it doesn't contribute for most of the fight.
---
11/5 is 2.1 mana per second
---
that's 126 mana per minute
---
33 spell power on a fireball is 33 dmg per cast
---
lets go with 30% crit chance and a crit multiplier of 2.1(not counting rolling ignites) so 69.3 dmg on a crit 3/10 crits is 207.9 dmg
---
7 casts non-crits x 33 = 231 dmg
---
207.9 + 231 = 438.9, the warlock staff would add 438.9 dmg to one mage per 10 casts
---
the mage can cast 20 fireballs per minute if they don't have to move, that means 877.8 per minute
---
You honestly think 126 mana that you might never see is better than 877.8 DPM? Do I have to go and find out how hard a fireball hits, divide it into damage per mana and calculate the effects of the mana regen, figure for movement cutting fireballs down to 16 per minutes (this is a trick because it would increase the value of the regen, but would cause other regen to kick in and you consider the regen from this item LAST for all intents and purposes)
---
fireball tome
---
 [**Fireball**](https://classicdb.ch/db/?spell=25306)  
---
**Rank 12** 410 mana  
---
35 yd range  
---
3.5 sec castHurls a fiery ball that causes 596 to 761 Fire damage and an additional 76 Fire damage over 8 sec. 
---
so that regen is 30% of a fireball per minute........ Even if it turns out to be a better "value" it is not frontloaded value like the spell power, it is backloaded value that contributes absolutely nothing to the fight until you reach under 252 mana at **TWO MINUTES** or 378 mana at **THREE MINUTES.** It's hard for me to explain why, but I know intuitively that if a mage went oom in 2 minutes and started to wand while regen was at 100%, it would devalue the 11/5 because it would become such a small contribution to a larger overall pool which you want to take advantage of by having large amounts of spell power to increase DPM.
---
Any questions?
---
This, lol.
---
&gt;World server
---
This is probably accurate, and it's such bullshit that it puts you back in the queue when this happens.
---
Cant unterstand why blizzard insists on #nochanges but do things like that
---
The solution is to add a command to remove a corpse. This way anyone writing messages can be erased but battlefields would remain littered.
---
Easy solution, a couple lines of code tops.
---
Yes, we used to summon people into the lava in old ironforge
---
How does a person donate for the effort put in to this if I end up using it?
---
Maybe not even every skeleton - but maybe 20% of skeletons move 5 yards or so. It would still largely ruin the gold farmers and people making swastikas or whatever.

Got first 2 launch days off, cant wait to blow em waiting in a que.

He has worked everyday, sometimes 15+ hours a day, for 2 years revamping, updating, and creating new content. He is not holding a gun to anyone's head and forcing them to pay. He knows people will pirate the guide. But he also knows many people will see the value in what he has worked so hard on and will pay a fair price. He has the most integrity of any human being I have ever known. And yes I know him personally! He is my brother.
---
This was one of the things I was REALLY looking forward to. I sent so many bug reports, and multiple forum posts about this. They could really just make it so only level 5-10+ can make skeletons or something.
---
I’m asking a real question. How is classic different than vanilla? I thought the whole point was that it was the same ...? Like this is a dead ass question please don’t downvote me.
---
So, how long would it take to go through a queue of 10k?  I never played on any release day, vanilla or expansions, so I don't know.

Hijacking this comment to state that the 57% reflected only the Reddit population.

Red Dragonscale Protector. The shield that drops from the second boss in BWL. I once saw a pally donning it outside Strath. I made myself a goal that day. I remember the feeling when it dropped for me and I had enough DKP to buy it. my heart rate was through the roof.

Stalagg has enough people now skram to skeram

Gandalf just fell down to Naxx and got geared up

You need to make an EU account. Just search it on google.
---
\*highfive\* damn right. Screw getting ganked.
---
Interesting. But there must be a way to extend the DC times. Do you get disconnected even while creating a new character?

We should probably not be sharing this information

I'm probably just going to be doing dungeon spam for that level range lol.

The actual Quest Helper add on cam in TBC. There were no quest helper addons in Vanilla.

I played Alliance from Vanilla through WotLK. After that the game was never great again. I'm 45 and looking to live the other side of the coin this time. So if you are Horde PVP, please let me know the server and guild.

I once made a lvl 1 troll named "Burnswhenipee" and left it's corpse in Org.  I'm sorry to anyone I may have offended.
---
So? Shit ton of accounts get hacked regardless.
---
You can't really stop that unless you make 2FA mandatory. Even then, people are morons and will get hacked.
---
You can't stop hacked accounts, it's just a problem that will happen.
---
Also you can also sign up to like a web service with the same password you use for WoW, then whoops they got hacked and their PW and email is practically public.
---
Like that happened to me recently, cause I'm not gonna pay for a password manager that will probably be hacked or have a vulnerability at some point.
---
Getting hacked in the internet age is a when, not an if for 99.9% of people.
---
In your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account, in the games and subscriptions you can add a starter account for world of warcraft. When you click "add" it will allow you to choose America, Asia or Europe. Than  you just add time to your new European wow account. In your games you will be able to see which account is NA and which is EU.
---
Okay this is epic
---
Create EU account, buy a sub for that EU account, login and reserve your names.
---
Fun little boss fight to unlock it too. I got to rock that shit as a boss Rogue dps king.
---
Was always Horde when i played when i was younger. Making the switch this time round.
---
For the Alliance!
---
This is sad
---
Sure, that’s the goal. But it’s not the same exactly. It’s on a new engine, in a new era of gaming with immense knowledge about the game that didn’t exist before. There are other differences such as layering and autoloot. It’s a separate release and there are many differences. Many of the bugs that existed back then are gone, you can’t walk jump now etc.
---
agree
---
Druids are literally the most op class in the game and can't be CCd like at all
---
Random spawn near where you die, not exactly where. Not a hard solution.
---
Not only that but the +5% parry rating talent is one of the best tanking talents available in terms of taking less damage.
---
The 40+ content does not work
---
Skinning/herb until I have my epic mount
---
Then dropping skinning and grabbing enchanting
---
Power level enchanting to get smoking heart of the mountain
---
At this point I may just keep enchanting because it’s already 265.   But I think I’d prefer alchemy.  So, that’s still up in the air.
---
I'll be playing on Chinese servers this time! I'm more or less in your position haha

So fucking stupid.

"Xo" on Stalagg and "Won" on Skeram.. PST. I want retail gold only!

There's not really a whole lot they have to hide when going for world first like they do with retail wow

Yeah I subbed to him specifically because his guides were free and he just seemed to really want to help the community. He would easily make big money by streaming and other revenues. I'm assuming this is also why he says his add-on isn't ready, he's trying to find a way to charge for it......
---
Mentally I believe it.
---
Grow up and pick a legitimate name.
---
Was thinking the same thing, just don’t upvote the post. Even if a bunch of people from this sub see it, that won’t be many compared to how many people are gonna be there at launch
---
very close to shaman leveling gameplay honestly lol, spell spell melee until dead.
---
BAHAHAHAHAHA YESSSSSS
---
But retail doesn’t support multithreading either? BFA runs on one thread afaik.
---
ELI5 what I’m looking at?
---
Random aside. But what gets me excited about classic is feeling actual progress because shit took forever to do. I remember seeing a level 60 undead priest and thinking how fucking cool the dude was. He killed me, but he deserved it
---
This happened  in classic? Lol I don’t remember even spam being noticeable  in chat until almost tbc?
---
Me too also. Though I would still make chars on TBC as well.
---
thanks for letting us know!
---
That’s hawt
---
Corpses or skeletons? I never saw skeletons.
---
Me and my guildies are all going horse this time as opposed to alliance
---
my starter edition only has america and oceania
---
Ive only EVER seen unreleased CORPSES used this way. Never once in thousands of hours skeletons.
---
Ran great on my base MacBook, so your pro will do just fine

---
Semi-related story-
---
I was fortunate enough to get into the TBC beta. Shortly after you go through the Portal, just north of the road there was an area that had like a large military rank of demons, including the all new shivarra (the leggy females with 6 arms) and a bunch of succubi. One of those two, possibly a named or elite, had a channeled drain ability that was pretty nasty, so naturally I did what Warlocks do and enslaved one for my own bidding :]
---
I quickly discovered some weird behaviour between the spell in question and Enslave Demon. For some reason the hostility flags were reversed, and I could only cast the drain ability on *friendly* targets, including myself. I could park my new friend up on a fellow Horde player in Thrallmar and kill most within two casts, and there wasn't anything they could do because the demon wasn't attackable. I did this....quite a lot (for testing purposes!) before submitting a bug report.
---
To anyone who died at the hand of Shaankylld and his sexy friend back then, sorry! ^^Also ^^sorry ^^to ^^TBC ^^Warlocks ^^for ^^spoiling ^^the ^^fun
---
Horde scum.
---
Ok, I’m gonna play around with it and see what I come up with. Maybe there is a way.
---
375 pushups first day lets goooooooooo
---
First time I’ve ever said this. I wish I was in Arizona during August!!
---
Why leave Stalagg?
---
there is no real answer
---
there is how you choose to have fun
---
Check out [SoulSort](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25115-SoulSort-EasySoulShardManagement.html) instead of using a macro. Way more flexible and you don't need a soul bag.
---
None. Most likely what I will do.
---
You will be able to buy classic shit for retail wow gold. The existence of WoW tokens and them covering classic makes this assured. Blizz really doesn't have a problem with that, it's only if you buy gold from non blizzard sources do they give a shit.
---
Also method has reputation. Reputation means you can borrow a ton more from people who will trust you to pay it back. They went into a shit ton of debt to do the world first BoD. They were able to go into debt cause the borrowers knew they were good for it.
---
I feel like the whole skill ceiling argument is a little silly, I feel like every class can be a pvp monster in the hands of an exceptionally skilled player.
---
The easiest class I'm going to have to give to rogues though. Unless the enemy sees you go into stealth you have the option of picking and choosing your moment 
---
In the case of a dagger rogue this means you can drop an ambush on a slightly damaged clothie for a quick 1 or 2 shot.
---
You can wait until you're at an advantage to strike in team pvp battles.
---
Rogues don't have a very large rotation. You're mostly going to open with cheap shot or ambush, do your main damage with sinister strike or back stab, and use your cp on eviscerate or kidney shot. 
---
Sprint, vanish, and blind are all very useful high cooldown abilities 
---
My runner up would be mage though. Shoot frostbolts, nova and blink away from melee, sheep where necessary, aoe where necessary, try not to blow all your mana
---
What art is that from?
---
Don't you get something like this when clicking on "create starter account"?
---
Even as a mage you have to run your first time. The portal teacher to any town is located in the town that the portal is for.
---
\+1  
---
I played though of vanilla and private servers and I have seen that.  ofc Skeletons would be coold, but saying " Making QoL changes like this takes us down the path all of us have been warning you about for years. " its kinda yikes.  
---
Hopefully Blizzard can do something like random skeleton orientation or something like that

What? I can't wait to go crazy berserker troll and shoot blue lasers from the hands, it isn't hard for me to take my gear off and back on, or use a macro. It's fun for me. I like frostbolt spam because I always want to see the max crit possible so it's like an rng slot machine.

oh man i laugh every time i read this
---
Horde befriends an Ally, wait that's Illegal.
---
My plan:
---
Herb/Alch to 60  --  Drop Herb for Enchanting -- Enchanting up until Smoking Heart of the Mountain -- Drop Ench for Herb again.
---
If you know what gear to look for, it's incredibly easy to gank an unassisted tank.
---
Your in the wrong reddit for it. They don't even have abilities called cyclone or typhoon.
---
If you keep the mats for a little while and sell them when the market gets hot, or even keep it and make wands for the starter casters. You can make some decent money early on.
---
Best bet would be to just message them day 1.
---
Yeah, he can change his mind.  I guess he couldn't give a heads up for  fear of someone ripping a copy of the website.  But there was never an intent of putting the guide behind a paywal.  People subbed to him on twitch to show support since he wasn't charging for it.
---
This is just a bad PR.  He's still going to make money from the guide though, but he's burning some bridges to do so.
---
He didn't mention addon development. He only mentioned "setting up keybinds" which is pretty bullshit. He's just too proud to admit he wants to fly around and explore.
---
I always wanted to play Horde but my friends at the time all played Alliance. This time around I finally get a chance to play my faction of choice.
---
...shit. That really sucks. According to the big write-up, that scenario is impossible. Yet here we are.
---
there is no problem
---
Ya this was my thought process. Truthfully I wish they normalized pets to prevent that but I digress. I just seriously hope lupos doesn’t do shadow? If that’s a thing that will blow. 
---
If they normalized but kept animal specific abilities it would be perfect imo. That way every pet is balanced in a way that you could get what ascetically pleases the player. Obviously certain pets do less dmg and have more armor etc but considering the pets stay with you basically always it would be dope to get the pet you enjoy looking at the most instead of BT and Lupos only basically.
---
every "free" guide is just a ripoff of his work someone else is trying to make money out of somehow.
---
rather pay the original creator a fee
---
They probably didn’t address Classic+, because it’s up there for quite possibly the dumbest idea the community has ever came up with.
---
This one is actually really close to the original dialogue, well done!
---
Won't be hard if they do the final version of the pvp system from vanilla.
---
It's up to what you wanna do there are decisions like getting to a certain travel form or mount for speed but besides that or if there's something specific you want from your profession at a certain point ONLY U CAN MAKE THIS DECISION
---
I've always played Alliance. This time around I'm playing Horde with friends.
---
I'm sure you're a reasonable person with a very well rounded view on things and we should take your opinion very seriously.

Hurricane still applies, they're all in the same category.
---
Also it's not like the work stops at launch. He is going to continue to work for years keeping updates and fixing bugs and things. I am sure no one likes to work hard for free. He has bills and expenses too
---
That's because they need to jump 200 ilvl an expansion.  Pendulum on retail needs to start swinging back towards bc or wotlk
---
Hey thats capitalism... or are u a commie?
---
You the real mvp!
---
Planning mage, want to go warlock now. Those sets look bad ass.
---
Cross-faction collusion to grief members of your own faction in a manner which renders characters unplayable and often requires GM intervention to resolve. If he's not full of shit, the GMs were about enforcing ToS.
---
Under games and subscriptions, game accounts, I see my old account (has my account name, wit the US and oceania) and World of Warcraft wow1 starter edition, also US and oceania
---
Maybe if they ever fucking dropped it would be an issue. You talk like it's common or something
---
Because I assume most people are ignorant of the terms multiple usages and the probability of one of them going back and reading a different reply is pretty low and I figured I'd educate some people so they wouldn't shit on someone for mistakenly only being aware of one of the multiple meanings of "sandbox".

There is lots of differences. A few obvious big ones - Classic is only 1.12, Vanilla had patch progression (I realize we are getting phases, but there was major class and talent reworks throughout the patches for example). The clients are totally different, 1.12 vs Legion 8.X base. etc.
---
Alright man lmk
---
His lore question is just as valid with just hurricane.   Not sure why you're being a dick
---
Right. If you can’t have your time utterly wasted then you’re just a nerd. I’m pretty certain it’s the opposite you fucking mongloid.
---
[And then you scroll down and see this scenario which should be impossible based on that write-up.](https://streamable.com/9hq2r)
---
It's not bannable, however blizzard has not given a statement about it as far as I know. I have been using it for years without any problems, or even heard others having problems with it.
---
I work nights. Will have to work Monday and Tuesday 6pm to 6am but took the rest of the week off so I’ll have 6 days to play non peak hours and get to skip the woes of release day. Pretty happy with my decision.
---
I can't believe I didn't know this until today... thank you so much
---
sounds like the plan of action.
---
Haha, okay buddy 👍
---
You can do that with any race you know... Fear Ward isn't some magic "I win" button, it has it's uses sure but it's not the be all and end all of fights, besides, Horde have a very nice racial called Will of the Forsaken, perhaps you've heard of it? Since you seem to be the min-maxing type I'm sure you have. Well WOTF negates your precious little Fear Ward ya'know.
---
Sometimes you pay to not be one anymore.
---
People even buy whole leveling.  
---
Why? Why would some one who makes 50-100$ waste 100hrs to grind mobs if he can just buy leveling for like 1-2hrs of work?
---
Honestly, I'm over these types of comments. Classic for MANY players is about the nostalgia. While not game breaking, omitting features like this devalue that experience and diminishes it's authenticity.
---
It would be interesting to see Monks and DKs added to classic. Rune management could be fun if it was actually part of the class. Classic Monk would probably be the most fun class I could imagine.
---
In games and subscriptions there are game accounts first with the list of your games and accounts and below that you should see Start Editions and Public Test Regions where you can create a new Starter Edition for WoW
---
Same here!
---
Why is that?
---
Your focus should be to get gold secured for your mounts at 40 and 60. Your toon will run slower in Classic than it does in BfA and it really sucks. The other thing should be to get as much bag space as possible.  
---
Other than that, spend your gold on anything you want.
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Wow, same dude that claimed he played Vanilla but said a bunch of shit that happened in MOP right?
---
This is good shit
---
Try having the problem of being unable to play for at least a week after release due to work travel and school... sheesh.
---
If your day is ruined by something like that, that shit is just sad.
---
What do you mean by the last point?
---
Epic video
---
Damn, blizzard really is out of touch with their community. They just literally have no fuckin idea what they're doing, do they? Anyone wanna take bets on how long until they force raid finder down our throats and people still defend it?
---
Extra bandage tick is nice too.
---
Oh I just saw it! This is what I will need for going EU? Would there be an issue with billing due to my address not being EU?
---
&gt;They also have mana problems, mainly in long boss fights
---
LF1M Stratholme must be Druid with innervate.
---
I support unique changes that fit in the realm of vanilla WoW as long as the core game stays the same.
---
If that ama didn't easy the nerves of the most hardened blizzard critic nothing will unfortunately. There will always be the doomsaysers and the nit pickers. Seriously how incredible was the answer to layering after everyone cried about it for months? If skeletons are the worst thing we have to complain about at this point then mark this game down as a phenomenal success.
---
There using layers as an excuse to not create enough realms because *tourists*
---
...yes they do???? Am I missing something
---
Honestly it’s not even worth thinking about at this point. Wow classic will be lasting for probably a good year and a half or two. Before a lot of people get to finishing most of the content.
---
I think you're confused
---
Thanks for the video!  I've binged all your videos and was pretty sad when I ran out.  This made my day!
---
no wonder QA team couldnt finish raids
---
You got a mana bar right?
---
The servers wouldn't crash, it would just be a clusterfuck and there would be no mobs for players to advance their quests.  
---
I remember back sometime in 2005 when the server I played on went down for a whole afternoon for some reason or another. What happened was "Well I would like to try a Horde character." and "Might as well try a Shaman while I'm at it." I rolled a Tauren on a low pop server and there were literally 200 other Tauren Shamans flooding Mulgore. I've never seen so many noobs spamming Lightning Bolt!
---
We used to find people in the barrens and summon them to the waters in stv, claiming we needed to have a 5man group for some quest and they could tag along and take the loot we didn't need so we could do "the quest"
---
since you had to load to a new continent, most people would have lost a significant portion of their breath meter (which starts draining without you being loaded) and would either drown or aggro the murlocs nearby because they were like lvl 11 and die that way. 
---
then we'd rez them and let the murlocs get them again and keep rezing them until they spirit rez'd and gave up. which is also hilarious because if you spirit rez you're at that shitty graveyard in stv and have to hearth without someone killing you, which i like to imagine probably happened.
---
the snowballs in alterac valley BG were the best thing to happen to team trolls.
---
we'd snowball people off the bridge before the alliance base and they'd fall and die, or snowball the afk people in the tunnel into the portal and make them leave. good stuff.
---
Noob here. How is the way you play? I am still  deciding on a class and I'm stuck between a Rogue and Druid.
---
&gt;People that want classic+ want something sustainable over time, that avoids the mistakes of the past.
---
You've said nothing. This means nothing. These are just words. What does it actually mean? What is your proposed content schedule? 
---
I literally already addressed this in my post, there is no "solid argument", why did you even bother to reply if you have nothing to say? Think before you post.
---
No I think you are. Blizzard is adamantly telling you people this and no one is listening.
---
Imagine being an adult and bawling over $5 this much.
---
Thanks I know what a sandbox is

The same Agramon from &lt;DOOM SQUAD&gt; in TBC?
---
SP in ZG! otherwise you are healing my friend!
---
&gt; I don't know if Sunken Temple was a particular favorite, but alongside Maraudon, Blackrock Depths and Highmaul it's an exemplar of how differently dungeon design used to be approached. They were all wildly architecturally distinct, and sprawling, intended to be approached in chunks or delved into during one mega session. The scale of everything was enormous, and there were a lot of twisty side routes and optional sub bosses and hidden corners to discover.
---
I have to agree. I'm not sure exactly why I have a dislike for ST, in theory it should be a favourite but I've just never enjoyed going there.
---
Why would you post this?! We’re already at medium after one day!
---
Hakkar server?  Nice.  Me too
---
Having some strange deja Vu ..
---
Can you explain why... this seems like the most reasonably interpretation of what blizzard has told us. Especially with Ion stating that each layer will hold an entire server's population.

Take a tylenol PM and go to sleep before launch. Wake up after the rush is done and play all night.

It's true, I told my boss I was gonna raid 3 hours a week and he laughed in my face so I quit and got a new job and told my new boss that I was going to pvp 3 hours a week and he gave me his job right then and there. Chris Metzen also gave me a hundred dollars and started a slow clap.

What is up with this nonsense of claiming you buy stuff in the cash shop? You don't have to pay for anything in the cash shop to play retail. It's only stuff like mounts, pets, and the usual stuff like transfers, race change, etc.

Vanity items doesn't mean they are trying to nickle and dime you. It's just there in case you want to look somewhat pretty on the new shiny. Or you can go do hard content and get that mount and show off the actually-took-effort-to-get shiny.

once you hit lvl 15 dungeons are way faster leveling anyways
---
Is there ever going to be a na sever named after hogger?
---
Also what was the toughest part about developing for classic?
---
Is he trying to pass it as his own? I don't think so. He screenshotted before it was taken down and saved it. If Joana didn't want this to happen he should have used the paywall from the start.
---
Get 20 of your closest mage friends and have a target marker.  Circle is aoe skull is fireblast.
---
Is that the Canadian kid who murdered people?
---
Bro no one has been working 15+ hour days for two years on Classic WoW guides, let's get real here. Lmao.

The reality will be closer to this:

Pick your battles

grobbulus x obituary pleaseeee
---
None of those two things have ever happened with this. They just added it because it gives them more of a excuse to remove them. They were always abused by gold advertisers and that's pretty much it.
---
My plan is to start skinning and tailoring, get 30 tailoring, craft greens, drop tailoring for enchanting, DE the greens and craft a wand. Then drop enchanting for mining. Mine/skin to 60 and then drop skinning for engineering
---
Context matters.
---
Not in classic.
---
Wife #4 is gonna love this
---
Yeah, I wanted to do it right this time. I've always either downloaded all in one packs that I never fully utilise, or I get a ton of random shit and half of it's broken. I spent a good 6+ hours over the stress test trying all the add-ons, trawling through every little setting, getting my frames pixel perfect. Countless logouts to update stuff.
---
It's something I want to do once and never have to touch again, aside from updating them. With the couple weeks of add-on updates since then, I actually would love to get into a Sandbox to get everything updated so I'm not relogging 50 times during queue periods.
---
Such wimps....
---
\*laughs in warrior\*
---
Boy this is some good cringe shit.
---
Muh precious classic experience. BALD MAN BAD
---
There's still a Max population that a server can hold the layers are there to spread people and make it playable while at capacity , it never had any effect on the maximum number of people it can handle at one time total it has no affect on the queues ...
---
you don't think so?
---
So, what do you mean by this? That Blizzard should just delete half of the reserved characters at random? People would just re-roll immediately.
---
because \[you have to buy subscription to view this reply\]
---
xD
---
Fuck sake that makes me not even want to play WoW. They really ban for reasons like that?
---
Yeah I bought a sub because I saw some streamers playing the beta thinking it was already open. Blizz wouldn’t give me a refund sadly :( wait till a day or two before the launch.
---
For sure there were less kids, there's no way you could make that statement, 2012 CSGO compared to 2015+? Join matchmaking games, mostly teenagers, before that era CSGO wasnt as popular and there were a lot of the community left over from 1.6 era, so older obviously.
---
Even, that entire case gambling madness, that attracted tons of kids. You're either dishonest or you didnt play outside of ESEA or smth.
---
Spend a little more time on this and you'll be as pathetic as the OP.
---
Shadowguard op with blackout. Hex of weakness is good too. Troll bis for priest imo
---
Or, you know, google.
---
And the dude plays a girl character. Ok lol
---
I didn't before, I don't intend to buy a mount at 40. travel form is just as good for me
---
Since you would probably have to wait for people to log off on launch I would guess 8 to 14 hours
---
It's gonna be a game to see how many/much of my quest routes I remember.
---
It's only been like 10 years...
---
I don't remember the grind being all that long. Or maybe I just had a lot of free time.
---
I thought addons would be cheating, WoW was my first mmo and I was bery little.
---
See the cavernous dungeons you listed right there are almost my top picks! I know many people hate BFD, but my first character was a NE so it was first instance experience and I still really enjoy it. I'd put it as my 4th favourite, only just pipped by SM.
---
The Emerald Dream.
---
&gt; The real problem is that if you tried to level using only rested XP, and you wanted to log out at an inn or capital every time, you'd be wasting a bunch of time traveling to/from leveling/questing areas every time you burned up all your rested XP
---
It could actually be really interesting to see a group try to optimize the lowest possible /played.  Since rested exp doesn't impact quests, I would think the most efficient exp/hr would be dungeon grinding.  And obviously they would use lock summons to get the character wherever is best for that.  I hope we find out what the lowest possible /played is some day... like a year and a half from now maybe, lol.
---
He didn't snap tho
---
Oh snap! You are funny. Great job. High five!

"There is no direct means for characters in BfA to transfer gold to characters in WoW Classic. This would be highly disruptive for Classic as the economies of these two games are very different.
---
Gold exchange between players in WoW is subject to our terms of service. Purchase of gold from 3rd parties could lead to suspension or banning of accounts."  
---
Is this the dev answer you were looking for?
---
I feel compelled to play "Fortunate Son" on my Spotify when entering this place again for the first time...
---
You GOTTA have something better to do with your time than call people pathetic over reddit
---
I think you you didn’t quite understand my post.
---
I was talking about new content in the strength of naxx and AQ that just makes different specs viable. You wouldn’t have to do those raid progressions as your naxx gear would stay equal.
---
Im not for new content either, but if they do some thing I’d prefer this.
---
Had to walk to a spirit healer, so if they tried the run to their corpse first, which is likely because Rez sickness eats dick, then they were super screwed.
---
I did! You, sir, are a God.
---
Tbf, they will not be proven wrong for a few more months.
---
Awesome art
---
I don’t care if this is buried I just have to say great job every step of the way. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and to be disappointed but you guys stayed true to the original and that’s all I ever wanted.
---
It does work.  People just don't understand that what comes in the brackets are conditionals (basically if-statements) based on your **current** target, unless you specify a different target using @mouseover, @player, etc.  
---
That last bit confuses people because they see macros like:
---
    /cast Taunt [@mouseover, harm]
---
and think that what goes in brackets is always supposed to be the target of your command.  
---
    /targetenemy [noharm][dead]
---
This will only run the command "/targetenemy" when your current target is noharm or dead (so either friendly, dead, or you don't have a target at all).  This means that if you have an enemy targeted already and hit your pick-pocket macro, it won't switch your target to another enemy.
---
Fist itemization didn’t exist in vanilla. You had the mainhand from BWL and the offhand from naxx. I can’t recall anything in between.
---
Thanks. Since Joana accepts donations and subs on stream and has a patreon on top of it, and said it would be free I think this is fair.
---
If I were the type I’d be looking it up online not randomly going to either spammed or skeletally scribed messages lmao

You have to go oceanic otherwise you’ll be dealing with aids ping

Everytime i hear this one i feel sorry for that ladies son, she must have been terrible to grow up with.

[So, how do you feel about this video where an entire raid of people phase out mid-PVP?](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exi97n2/)
---
Wow this is a huge douche move for him. He's said for months and months now it's all free and he's going to work on in game addon guides. There are dozens of other full guides out there he's just got a big name behind his. Check out the ones Defcamp and Melderon's crew put together over at classicwow.live. They have guides for solo, duo, and trio for all races and classes.
---
Brilliant. Reminds me of hanging out near cliffs when people weren't aware of knockbacks. Was in bc or wrath, I remember doing it while leveling. Invite to duel, and away they went.
---
I personally feel like the best solution to the problem would be to randomize skeleton rotation. People could get their skeletons (which I think would be cool but far from mandatory) but the randomized rotation would disable manipulation in the form of words or images.
---
I have a bike setup like this.

Corpses should last 72 hours, or be removed after a new death

Noobs are supposed to be owned. And he just owned them. Assert dominance
---
I can make him snap for $3.50
---
Get anyone more than once?
---
I think what OP is saying is how is it calculated if one person reserved their name on three different servers, would this add the same load to each server as if the player were to create all three characters on one?
---
It's a needless change, and everyone should be able to get behind saying no to needless changes.
---
Even if that was true, which I really doubt, it barely has anything to do with the topic at hand. I was talking about how the community turned incredibly toxic in the 2010-2012 period.
---
Of course there are more kids playing the game in general, but that's only because there's much more people in general who plays the game.. not because the percentage of kids has somehow increased.
---
You're right, I rarely ever did play on ESEA. I'm not American, so I never had to bother with that horrible service... although ESL wasn't that much better.
---
I hope it also includes a cat-tree/snowboard keyboard tray.
---
But ... but disappearing skeletons, no DX12 and multi-threading!

How could anyone have fun?!1

10g this site says. Honor is not a currency in vanilla.
---
I'm sensing some projection in this post.
---
I agree with that. But if they believed that, endorsed it, or supported that statement, they would have said, unequivocally, that there will be no name changes, and no realm changes allowed. Outside of high pop servers free-xferring over to new realm servers, or low pop servers.
---
He misunderstood something and I explained that to him. Since when is helping with a question being a dick?
---
Ardent custodian i was shocked at the sight of something purple
---
Two of them don't exist but that's what I nicely explained.
---
Um no they definitely happened, but that doesn't justify it.
---
Those abilities not being in classic is 100% irrelevant to his question.
---
Why does the cat have more living space than you?
---
Sounds like the opposite, but that sounds like an edge case.

That is awesome!!!!!!! Goals!

im pinning this comment and going to copy-paste it back to you on launch when the servers shit themselves. God knows i'll have the time to.

They can be put to sleep
---
We want our skeletons back. WE WANT OUR SKELETONS BACK! LISTEN TO US BLIZZARD. we pay your bills
---
this was awesome to go through and read. a huge thank you to the dev team and the people in charge of this subreddit who put it together.
---
It’s like it’s trying to speak to me, but all intelligence must have left this husk a long time ago
---
I swam from menethil to westfall on my lvl 14 NE warrior when the game first launched. Wanted to avoid dying in wetlands and thought i could just walk into dwarf lands from the coast. It was a long swim to the human lands.
---
This is some pretty high level trolling. High level trolling and low level griefing can be difficult to distinguish.
---
Because it is fun?
---
Honestly, no.
---
this game is 15 years old, there are no "World Firsts....." cmon keep this shit in retail ....
---
You’ll get a que every time you switch
---
I never got a BOE epic in classic
---
my first ever epic was a staff from ZG, kinda looked like a spatula lol. it wasn't that great but I kept it till I got my benediction.
---
What the fuck am i looking at
---
Seriously. I don’t care if someone hates retail, we all like or dislike different games. But World of Warcraft is not a cash shop game. You don’t have to buy silly mount to progress faster in the game. It is a stupid empty argument neckbeards throw out there to try and make their personal opinions feel like objective truth.
---
I don't understand why this can't be resolved with 1 GM ticket. "There's a swastika next to the bank." "Oh, I see that. I've cleared those skeletons."
---
Play where you're going to end up. 1-4 years is nothing compared to the rest of your life.
---
They don't that's why I posted to help. Hurricane is a real ability for druids though just not the other two.
---
Have the name Battle on Blameux will trade for some retail gold.
---
They really didn't, it was only used for advertising.
---
Leather belt, leather belt
---
[Here's a good example. According to that big write-up, this scenario should be impossible.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exi97n2/)
---
Honestly, even if it means we see corpses everywhere advertising gold sellers, I'd be okay with that if it meant we got to keep persistent skeletons and corpses.
---
Seeing all of the skeletons littering the world really added to the game. Not only did it add to the immersion in the open world, but it also served as a warning of pvp being active in the area, and warning you that you may be ganked. It also looked fantastic to see skeletons littered everywhere after a major battle. And as the ganker, seeing your victim's skeletons piling up really added to the satisfaction. Honestly, it added so much to the game that I'd be perfectly fine with seeing gold advertisements. It's worth the trade.
---
As for the corpses spelling out gold websites, I honestly don't even mind them that much. It generally happens in the major cities, so it doesn't really affect combat gameplay or immersion out in the world so it's not a big deal. Plus seeing countless bodies fall from the sky and die was actually pretty funny to see. And since many of us want no changes for classic, it wouldn't be the true vanilla experience without it. Just another aspect of nostalgia.
---
In short, with regards to the corpses advertising gold sellers, I don't think many people mind them, and at best some people even find it funny, amusing, and nostalgic.
---
Losing something that people want to keep and has genuinely good features that actually have a gameplay aspect and serve a purpose of warning of world pvp, and a reward for those who killed players, all to remove something that most people don't even care about doesn't seem like a good trade.
---
Honestly, even if they do remove the corpses, it just means we're going to have people spamming the chat with advertisements anyways. And I'd much rather keep the advertisements to a pile of dead bodies instead of having my chat spammed, and I think most people would agree. A billboard of corpses that I can just walk away from is far better than not being able to use my chat because it's being spammed.
---
If blizz does it this way, it'll be even harder to use trade to buy/sell stuff, and to use general chat to find people for a party, which are also much more important in vanilla.
---
Hell, you know what? At this point, it's not even just about the skeletons. Please allow the corpse advertisers just so I can find parties and not have my chat spammed. The skeletons are just an added bonus. And the corpses will just be funny and nostalgic.
---
True vanilla experience/s
---
Some are dookie some are pretty good wowhead classic will show you the stats/ set bonuses
---
I'm hearing a lot of walls you put up for yourself. Also, they do cuddle. There are subreddits for this info.
---
Yeah like wtf is that setup
---
Nice.  Horde or Alliance?  I was in the Alliance guild Last Chance until it fell apart.  Had a lot of fun on that server.
---
God, not this again
---
Yep, AB shoulders kinda compensated for it, it's probably my 2nd favorite design in the game.
---
unless you could get her to play too!
---
What do you mean by "does not scale"? Attack power literally scales with weapon speed. 
---
In another comment I did the math, and on Nightfall max rank Rockbiter adds 163.1 damage per swing, which is nearly double it's minimum hit. That's not a great comparison because Windfury will give you higher proc uptime, which is why you use Nightfall.
---
Let's use Sulfuras, as it's pretty unarguable that it would constitute a "high quality" weapon. On Sulfuras max rank rockbiter adds 172.4 damage to every swing, around a 50% increase to it's average swing.
---
Comparatively, Windfury's extra attacks will each average 385.5 per hit. Multiply by 2 to factor both hits, then by .2 for the 20% chance, and you get 154.2 added damage per swing.
---
I've thought about it carefully. Do you understand?
---
_In T cells
---
You're right you're right... so you'll put up five bucks they won't add a new one?
---
Or how bout ten, easy money for you _ you're just robbing me basically.
---
Unironically, in the case of priests.
---
it does suck. when i go to STV, i want to feel scared. with 3-4 skellies, that isnt scary! when you see 15-30 skellies, it forces you to imagine what kind of sh\*t went down there! how epic it probably was! and if you are fighting a filthy horde, you want to see how many times you kill him! make him see his own skellies!
---
Thanks! Good to know.
---
No blood clots here.
---
Its okay, some of the individual pieces are really good.
---
Can't agree more.  Skeletons will help players know Hemet Nessingwary does not play around.
---
&gt; RFK &amp; RFD are okay, little bit samey to me (especially when you've been doing Scarlet Monastery around the same time).

Excuse me? RFD has *Mordresh Fire-Eye*, the fucking skeleton mosh pit fight.

the only thing awesome was arena. Lvl 60 arena would be amazing. Wouldnt even need a gear set, just bragging rights or titles/tabards

And there are PvP functions in the game for you to do that. OP went beyond the scope of intended gameplay for no purpose other than to hurt others. There's really no need to be assholes to other human beings just because all you see is a sprite on your screen.

Haha nope.

The burden of proof isn't on me, it's on you.

No one did this kind of stuff for multiple reasons.

1: It gets you banned and no one is going to make and pay for a new account just to write naughty words

2: No one cared about politics back then online like they do now

3: GMs remove it in 5 seconds

They are being lazy and don't want to hire more GMs, they want WoW to make tons of money will little overhead.

I’m not gonna be paying $15 a month to have my life wasted on this crack cocaine of a game to begin with. What other game do you play where you get griefed at every possible turn and are expected to enjoy it? Lol what’s pathetic is the people who pay to play this game. Literally salivating at the thought of it releasing. While blizzard just laughs in their millions while they serve you a 15+ year old game for the same price it was then. You’re just a loser.
---
It’s the monthly thing right? I’ll check it out then! I appreciate it.
---
Troll. WoTF is unnecessary as a priest, because if you are getting feared as a Priest you’re either ridiculously out of position or you’re about to die anyway, and WoTF isn’t going to save you.
---
Good luck knowing which zones had appropriate level mobs without someone helping you or looking it up on allakhazam (ew)
---
I honestly don't know. I wanna play as a 2H shaman but at the same time there's not much cooler than playing as a Dwarf hunter with a bear
---
Ahh yes, because there's something else going on we are not allowed to talk about changes that negatively impact our immersion.
---
Who would even benefit from such a mentality? The community wouldn't be able to voice their opinion and the devs wouldn't know that certain changes negatively impact the immersion of many players.
---
But I guess it's easier to sh*t on legitimate criticism, even if minor, despite the fact that the devs seem to be actively looking for feedback and making changes to things the community doesn't like.

Do like moat people qill likely do. Pick skinning and either herb or minning(cant track both at the same time on classic) save the mats(migth want to sell the skins) and in 60 chose your profecion and drop the one you dont need(like droping skinning and geting alchemy or blacksmithing)

Nope. This is an heirloom item from wotlk
---
If people want to kick up a fuss about something, make it something actually important.  
---
The AQ war effort having the exact same items at the same quantities as 15 years ago for "authenticity" is a problem when we have the foresight to know what will be needed and how much of it ages before the event happens, thereby making the experience not-authentic.
---
A WF extra attack also scales with your character's stat. You don't swing Sulfuras for its base weapon dmg alone, but it scales with your str/agi and atk power equipment.
---
This is what I meant. You forgot this basic fact when you did your calculations.
---
Rockbiter doesn't scale, and I am not talking about weapon speed. But don't worry, if you don't get it, whatever.

“We're absolutely committed to reaching one layer per realm by Phase 2. This is why we need to have upper bounds on the number of players connected to the realm at one time, and queue players past that point. That, of course, is why we're willing to open new servers if necessary, and we've even started doing that in response to the incredibly positive reception we've had during the name reservation period!”

I tried to make money to buy a mount by grinding Coarse Gorilla Hairs (to vendor) from the gorillas near Booty Bay as a prot spec warrior on a PvP server at lvl 40... And no, I wasn't prot spec to tank instances. I just thought it was an efficient grinding spec...

After the Major Domo fight in MC I used to run into the fire pit as a paladin and then rez someone I didn't like in the guild, they would accept the rez and then instantly die again.

Yes

😂🔥🔥💯💯🔥😫😂😂
---
Unlikely.  Not because you can’t, but because you’ll be expected to heal.  Any class that can heal will heal.  At least in pugs.  It’s pretty rare for the class that is the best healer in the game to not actually be healing in the dungeon.

This is absolutely beautiful!!!!!!!  I need a copy for my own! I am doing shammy for the first time :D
---
Just by making gear tailored for the weaker specs would go far. They could even make a trinket with active Taunt if they felt like it.
---
Ya.  And the Eos guild.  Thats cool that classic is bringing people together this way.  I wouldn't be surprised if we BG'd together at some point in time.

Make sure you check out the official WoW forums for the Hakkar re-connection if you haven't.

20 ms or a 0.005% chance to drink the bath water of henry cavill's toon? HMM

Yeah, no one ever said racist shit in game either, or exploited mechanics that resulted in a ban either right? No one *ever* does dumb stuff. Certainly not when we're talking about a population of over 10 *million* individuals. Certainly no dumb racists in there. Certainly no one on a stolen account. No siree, just 100% ads, never anything negative or derogatory.

Also I like how we've both made claims and the burden of proof is somehow on me. If I told you "I remember when people used to hop around on the beach at Southshore" and you said "That 100% never happened and I am **certain** of it," you really think the burden of proof is on *me*? Your claim warrants just as evidence as mine does, if not more so given how ridiculous your claim is.

Is it even possible to have slow enough internet to not be able to play games online this day in age. I mean, streaming video takes about 4x the resources... are you sure your internet is that bad OP? The initial download might take a while, but playing online games does not take “good internet.”
---
I disagree I think ret paladin need to farm more.

Horde for 14 years...its time to play dwarf. Finally :)

Splitting them in two like that suggests they are two seperate things, it's what you'd do when talking about the UK/Ireland or UK/France

Add option to hide em, there we go, already solved.

Hey man I tanked AND healed scarlet strath as a shaman in a 4 man group it went suprising well, but I did have quality  players with me.
---
Sharding. 😐

This is the correct answer

Did this in outlands too
---
I made my reddit account strictly for the wow classic content, to be honest. And what a ride it's been. I love you all.

US credit and debit cards sometimes have weird conversion fees and stuff like that. I’ve been living here for just several years, but I see that most of cards don’t have any fees when I pay for my European sub or buying a new game on battle.net. But to be sure I always use only one card that I know for sure doesn’t have any fees and just converts any foreign currency to dollars
---
dude you are gonna have reverse texters neck
---
Classic would get little to no benefit from multi-threading. Even on Retail, you are only gaining about 15% performance in ideal situations.
---
You are asking for something pointless.
---
Lol. I'm not the guy you've been responding to, but you seem to be completely ignorant to the fact that teenagers have been drawing swastikas to be edgy for like eternity.

You need to build up to buying a hooker. Start by masturebating at your local ATM

Why not the elevator from Barrens to Thousand needles? That was my jam around the same time, catch them coming from 1k and then trust fail to their death.

Or about 5GB

What does ret need that feral doesn't
---
Some of the stuff you list as cons are plusses for me.  I love the class fantasy of obtaining/crafting poisons and reagents.  I love actually having to take care of a pet and gain their loyalty.
---
Best BG in my opinion for all the reasons you said. Can’t wait for Phase 4
---
Why are you exaggerating so much man?
---
You really think this was a widespread issue back then to warrant banning it more than 10 years later?
---
Awesome! Come on up if you are free. We are about an hour north of Tucson.

such a troll for putting years of work into something and wanting to get paid for it all of a sudden /rollseye
---
But this isn't just dealing with Mind Control. This is an alliance and horde player colluding via a voice chat application outside of the game for the sole aim of completely wasting another player's time. The entire point is to cause misery in other players for their own personal enjoyment. I am not arguing for or against a ban, but I can definitely see why a game master would view a ban as justifiable. This is in a different category than just "PvP".
---
I still think this is hilarious though.
---
When one thing drops everything drops, and then you spend 3 days setting up a new computer?!

Bring a few stacks of fire protection potions, chug them on cooldown during Rag, you should be ok

No one who takes the game seriously thinks r14 is impressive in the sense of requiring skill. It's all just grinding against low honor players for weeks straight.

Druids did end up with "Play Dead" (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Play_Dead) during MoP via symbiosis, but that went away with WoD :(
---
God I can'tfucking wait to play WoW again
---
I honestly miss and loved that from WOW Vanilla. It felt as being an Alliance low level there was a bonafide threat in the area and I had to be on my toes.
---
No, as I've said multiple times, I do not think this is a big deal, and it certainly does not warrant the changes they've mentioned. Have you not been reading my comments?
---
I'm saying your argument is fallacious and requiring me to provide some sort of evidence for something like this is absurd. Do you have screenshots to back up every memory you have of WoW? Should they be required to tell someone "Yeah I remember that"?
---
I remember people doing all sorts of shit with skeletons, like peace symbols, nazi symbols, words, giant congo lines, you name it. And claiming that you are **100% certain** that that **never** happened is simply absurd. You want me to prove it? Nah, you're making up ridiculous shit. *You* prove it.
---
Yea, but wow is still so far away :((
---
Is it possible to download these in a zip in some way ?
---
Yeah it just skips the for loop in that case. If it were `for i=1,-1,-1` it would run 3 times though.
---
I don't have much to recommend besides the wow wiki, they have a lot of pages on the wow api. Doing a lua tutorial for the basics might be helpful too. I learned from [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/), but it's not oriented towards beginner programmers so I don't know if it'd work for you. If you do a tutorial I recommend the addon WowLua for running lua code.

It's 25 + 5% base, I was meaning to say that you have about a 1 in 3 chance of resisting a stun and my sleep deprived brain went "LOL JUST TYPE 33% INSTEAD".

Reminded me the 2005 player who ran to MC and priests used to stand on the chains mc everyone and drop them to the lava! XD

I really hope to experience the same moments and memories on this release! :D

The real reason is way more boring: It's for China. Keeping a single version of the code for all regions is easier. China doesnt want skellies.

Herod with 15-20k queues and 5-10 hour wait times. Faerlina will start out with 20k+ queues cause of all the twitch viewers wanting to "INV TO ASMON LAYER" at the very start, then will die down to well below Herod's queues and wait time.
---
I think you both meant to say *The Office*.
---
I'm using Classic for an excuse to drink more....
---
But for real, I wish you all the best. Addiction is a harsh mistress.
---
I do.  That's why it actually took me time to reply.  :D
---
One of druid's problems is that they don't scale with gear well. They get armor capped in bear form pretty early on, and gain no benefit from ever increasing weapon damage.  Whereas warriors are probably the class that scales with gear most, so they got way better toward the end while druids just crept along.
---
There's like 3-4 full 1-60 Alliancr guides for Guidelime available already for free + many people working on Horde ones.
---
Kudos for that Skism friend. Hadn't heard that filth in a looooooong time.

Ret needs all melee consumes and all spell caster consumes to completely min max.
---
Arugal is looking to have a real healthy population and to be fairly balanced. PVP is gonna kick off.
---
Good good
---
Oh, interesting.  Didn't play Legion so I missed that.  But yeah, like you said, I don't think it'd be an issue with classic.
---
It went up to +21, but that was nerfed way before 1.12. It was reduced to a maximum of 11 spell damage, which no longer makes it BiS. Healing is capped at 18
---
In addition to randomizing the x,y of a corpse.. You could also set a level cap on your method of dealing with spammers. Make it so they have to be level (10?) before they can leave more than one skeleton after death. All the spammers I saw would march the same character in and die, or 20 accounts in a line from spawn. If they wanna spell stuff they will.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor!
---
Iirc the healing chest off Rivendare is the next choice
---
The UI leaves a little bit to be desired, consider looking up an add on set up for classic. You dont have to use ones that may spoil quests or anything like that, but things like health and casting bars, cooldown timers etc can be a bit dated in the original style.
---
&gt;Nice edit.
---
I didn't edit any of my posts, why are you so petty to reply twice and then accusing me of editing my posts lmao
---
&gt;vastly overpopulated servers
---
AKA all of them
---
Oh no it was for trapping people not preventing people from doing it.
---
Also you wouldn't happen to have the name carebears on Fairbanks would you? :P
---
Liters of blooooooood. Liters of blooooooood.
---
Actually watching the button turn active to log in is going to be a hell of a feeling
---
Depends what that thing is, being average at the amount of time you sink into a video game that doesn’t  give any productive real life value? Not the worst thing.
---
Well done
---
6 and 1/2 hours to level 20 would be very very quick, especially for someone who hasn't leveled like that before
---
Forks up baby
---
Photoshop &amp; a Wacom intuous tablet.

---
Do they have any idea how big this is gonna be? I feel like we're all gonna be posting "RIP servers" threads for a few days at launch. Do you think they're aware how many fans are super excited? I'm curious.
---
i mean, I have only been bitching about unarmored mounts since the start, so...
---
Zip ties man get a lot of them....
---
There legit needs to be another sub, the blizzdrones here are suffocating
---
I work until 30 minutes after launch. I just want to go home, eventually get in, and have fun.
---
The last part there is important. That's a feature WoW's been missing since patch 6.0 for me.
---
&gt;a bunch of skeletons from the same handful of people dying over again
---
God damn, I forgot that huge fights didn't happen in classic, thanks for reminding me.
---
And who says it has to be a hundred or even a handful? *One skeleton* can be meaningful.
---
You absolutely did. And nice of you to respond to this instead of addressing my main comment. 
---
What, embarrassed that you didn't notice we're in agreement on this being bullshit on Blizzard's part? Oops! Helps to read the posts you're arguing with!
---
Yes they are, and honestly the devs reason is just plain stupid. You disable skeletons but have unlimited chat? Like other people have said, you can either limit a char to x amount of skeletons or better yet just randomize rotation.
---
&gt;peace symbols, giant congo lines
---
How are these harmful? Even words that aren't vulgar should be allowed to be there
---
&gt;wow someone did something bad with a feature lets ban all of it for everyone else instead of moderating it
---
Great work dude.
---
link the post i edited
---
Hunter would probably be easiest I am using a mage though as I will actually play the mage for more than just farming.
---
I'm an uptight pussy because I don't think it matters whether skeletons show up in the game when people die? LOL
---
Whatever you say there kiddo.
---
I've been playing since 03/04 open beta, and I HAVE seen this. Mostly during Wrath and Cata.
---
Yes.
---
How to shoot yourself in the foot lol. Goodbye!
---
I have Colossus on Herod, thats funny
---
Dude real talk.
---
I’m with you. When I played Vanilla it took me 6 months to hit 60. I want to do it fast this time, I can always screw around on an alt if I want, but I want to have a 60 ready for end game content.
---
People talking about going slow this time, since they went fast back then. Well I’m doing the opposite of what I did back then just like they are.
---
I won’t get into the tanking part of it...but pvp is about connecting on your target and doing big burst. MS + HS followed by a whirlwind does that
---
Hi, /u/Bubsm8

How do you get 10x demand with layering? 
---
The AH is the same on all layers.
---
I'm not disputing the fact that there are stupid people who get hacked but it's nowhere near 99.9% lmao. It's 2019 and people aren't as stupid. On top of that the people who will play Classic will most be in their 20s and 30s who have been using the Internet for well over a decade and have learned basic account security.
---
Do you honestly think Classic+ will happen, or is a good idea?
---
The Classic team does not have any Game Designers. If Classic+ were to happen, then Blizzard would have to hire more Designers, which won't happen, or pull designers from retail, which you really don't want.
---
Haha i love it bro
---
Oh I get you. 
---
Nah I don't. This name came much later than my wow names. My bank alt is Scam though.
---
Warlock. Don't have to worry about pet happiness and upkeep like hunters, and you still get the benefits of being a pet class. Makes stuff a lot easier to solo.
---
1. Log in
---
2. Play as long as possible up until about midnight
---
3. Have fun!
---
One possible solution is to let any players in the area when a skeleton appears handle placing it client side. If they ever unload that area and return, they will get the server's randomized position.
---
I say make them available to everyone via some kind of minor free event with the same timings, just replicate the schedule.
---
Their argument makes no sense. People could still spell out things without skeletons too. What are they going to remove /sleep to stop people from laying down and spelling things out too? Sorry that's not a good reason in my opinion.
---
Blood Fury is nerfed in 1.4.0, what then? 
---
Is hardness alone better than WOTF?
---
The founding of Durotar bonus campaign of WCIII is seriously satisfying the craving for me right now. It's basically single player WoW.
---
laptop gaming lol
---
Yea I've seen posts about hunters soloing dungeon bosses, seems like a decent way to make money if that doesn't get changed. I've never played a hunter but I am definitely tempted.
---
🧙‍♂️
---
Wow! There was a lot I didn't know about fishing....
---
&gt;How are these harmful
---
Jesus Christ dude. This is my last attempt.
---
I'm saying that people used skeletons to make symbols of *all kinds*. Sometimes they were symbols, sometimes words, sometimes squiggly lines. Sometimes hateful, sometimes peaceful. They were a *constant* presence in major cities.
---
To claim that they were NEVER EVER used in a negative light is ridiculous.
---
&gt;&gt;wow someone did something bad with a feature lets ban all of it for everyone else instead of moderating it
---
&gt;Great work dude.
---
I DON'T SUPPORT BLIZZARD ON THIS. How can I make that any clearer? lmao
---
This as simple as I can make it for you kiddo. I'm out. Inbox replies disabled.
---
Well, at least OP gave credit
---
It's a damned shame that this is the truth, but it is. I genuinely liked some of the changes modern WoW has, pet battles, arenas, Brawl'gar, ranked bg's. 
---
But... I understand that opening these features to a 1 vote per account poll is going to land us with LFR, ending world PVP, rng gear, garrisons, heirlooms, etc. Maybe a poll system would be good after phase 6, maybe it would never be good.
---
It's easy to save 50g. Hard to save 800g or are you bad at math?

This is hilarious, I am in the exact same situation as you and decided today that I was going to do the same thing since I’ll be playing more than her. Thanks for the thread!

Can't swap helmets in combat though, and I might need the stats in the coming battle with our drowning victim
---
Wrong sub. Warcraft is a cartoon game and the lore does not really make sense. There’s a narrative but there’s no internal consistency. But it’s great because it is a video game, not a book. Not making sense allows things to be cool. Like Star Wars: it is non sensical and has terrible lore, but jedis are amazingly cool.
---
If you want nice lore, try reading books.
---
On more than one occasion I sat on that very ledge with my Winterspring Frostsaber and watched the countdown to server reset.
---
Thats scrub play.  The real pros start downloading the client when its time.
---
Which ones older? Hmmmm
---
Just stop
---
I loved this vid.
---
Racial are not as crucial as some people made up to be, as a healer you will get invited to groups no matter what, the only thing you need to worry about is how to say "No" to people whispering you, chose the race you like because you are gonna look at it for a long long time, if you hate it you will quit or make a new character.
---
Reddit karma is more important!
---
it can be used for drawing dicks so it can't be in the game. what kind of justification is that lol
---
Wait.. what server was this?  
---
I swear I've come across Traktorkaffe before and I doubt there's more than one scandinavian who thought that was a good name.
---
Yeah I hear that priests are generally amazing, but are they holy or disc? Once again I have pretty much 0 Classic knowledge but when I played in pandaria and what not everyone rolled Disc.
---
This is why I'm using 16 vacation days :)
---
&gt;That's why world quests and dailies made me quit. You HAVE to log in everyday to do the same 3 quests until exalted. It turns the game into a chore. 
---
That's what makes it accessible to a casual player.
---
In between finally putting the kids to bed, and then going to bed themselves, they can spare 25 minutes to do daily quests.
---
For the rest of us we don't do dailies. We do content that we want to do.
---
Because we don't **have** to log in and do any dailies
---
&gt; This is done automatically. I'll concede it's strange (immersion breaking) to phase if you accept an invite.
---
WoW classic is 90% about social interaction and immersion. To kill immersion is antithetical to vanilla WoW. I'm so confused as to how no one seems to realize this. 
---
&gt; Each layer apparently has the same number of players as a vanilla server. So this is a non-issue.
---
Not every layer will have the same amount of players, unless it's dynamically adjusted, in which case people would be constantly shifted between layers, further destroying immersion. 
---
&gt; As above, if you consider your "layers" (each the size of a vanilla server) as separate servers... The player you never see due to layering, you would have never seen because they were on a different server. With layers, you are able to interact with them via chat and then party. With separate servers, that would be impossible (in vanilla).
---
But it's a contained system. How people interact is affected by player concentration, if layering changes this, and it will, then people won't be in the same places as they normally would be. This is all artificial. 
---
In no way is trapping people in multiple dimensions a valid option for vanilla. People should have been mass protesting layering from the onset of its announcement. But everyone would rather eat up whatever gruel Blizzard decides to serve up.
---
God damn my neck hurts just looking at this
---
A leveling guide for a 15 year old game isn't worth money.
---
I'd like to get as close to level 20 as I can before the servers go down Tuesday morning for the maintenance.
---
Jesus christ is Ziz moving here aswell? 
---
God damnit....
---
Somehow an extremely large group of people interpreted that blue post as confirmation of private-server style 10k pop realms. 
---
No, you're going to be dumped in a massive queue and have to wait hours each time you want to play.
---
&gt;alliance and horde player colluding via a voice chat application outside of the game &lt;...&gt; entire point is to cause misery in other players for their own personal enjoyment.
---
I see you have never played Eve Online. The entire MMO revolves around griefing or swindling people, sometimes to the tune of $1000s of real world dollars.
---
It is not bannable unless you hack and/or cheat. PvP by nature is "no mercy".
---
wtf is a "drip?"
---
The only way to make Ret Paladins even more of a meme.
---
Hunter for sure
---
I hope people don't see lists like these and expect everyone to farm all this gear pre-MC. There are many items that should be on the pre-raid bis list for rogue. Yes this is the absolute BIS, but it's overkill. Get hit capped and have devilsaur, the neck, and a couple others along with other decent pieces and you're fine.
---
LF Jen or Jenn on Herod. Thanks!
---
LF Jen or Jenn on Herod. Thanks :)!
---
Hunter all the way! and pickup/sell everything! Most classes had something they could farm but i always felt Hunter had the best kit for it and the most options.
---
?
---
I'm not a technical expert. I'm saying the systems they already have in place, or could add, fix the problem.
---
Queues.
---
Dynamic spawns.
---
And adding new servers if demand is too high, which can literally be done within hours now, with virtual servers, and the cost is infinitesimal to a behemoth like Blizzard.
---
The solutions already exist, layering is 100% unnecessary.
---
There is multiple layers per realm, and likely multiple realms per physical server.
---
Blizzard probably gave them access to level 60 beta and they will probably still lose to APES
---
I'm sitting here trying to imagine a situation where someone has an antique CPU that's significantly bottlenecked by Classic, but also has a GPU that would support the DX12 multithreading optimizations.
---
Layering is gone before phase one ends. Phase two is the honor system and massive world pvp. It’ll be gone in time for that.
---
That's the best I heard yet, I played WC3 before WoW came our back in the day maybe get the feels for that too... only thing is I think I have to find the disc hidden in the basement i think lol or pay for it. Aren't they re-releasing WC3? If I have to buy again rather wait.
---
yea my bad all i see usually are all na and eu players on youtube and twitch
---
I love these! As someone not familiar with metal bands, can you explain which band each server is in the style of?
---
Get creative in idiotic ways with lateral content additions. I want to play as a murloc. Give me the lowest base stats possible and a -20% stamina racial and murlocs can't wear pants. I'll roll a murloc warrior. I swear on Jeff Kaplan.
---
The logic behind layering makes perfect sense with their explanation. What exactly don't you understand?
---
When everyone is in a starting zone together, the servers are under exponentially more load and can't handle it.
---
Sharding doesn't work with vanilla.
---
Layering will be gone by phase 2, because people will be more spread out.
---
I can hear this image
---
it's a lot easier to publicly shame people and provide it as proof if it's in chat. it also have less permanence than skeletons. the chat just just scrolls away, skeletons do not
---
Stop trying to stir shit up. I know you are closely a managerial genius and know more than a massive gaming company. But I think we will be just fine .
---
Seriously. You say that you want what the community wants but you deny this for silly reasons. People spelling out things is a foolish reason. Ban them like you would ban anyone. You don't remove chat because people can spell out hate speech with it.
---
"... yet some balding guy makes thousands streaming fucking Deadmines!"  Hahahaha
---
hunter life knows no bounds
---
Could be wrong, but wasn’t the blue pvp set buffed and stat wise more closer to aq40 gear?
---
12 hours per day in that chair?
---
Name the pet  after her though it'll be super cute like you're always together even when you're not
---
Not really wrong, though. It was an enormous pain in the ass to pug baby's first raid, MC, on Light's Hope, even during the AQ40 phase and even considering that server's likelier higher average skill level than what Classic will have.
---
Is there one of these for priest?
---
"Seems easy to do"
---
That's the thing, this is a 15 year old game built on top of itself over and over again. It's probably a rats nest of spaghetti code and strange inconsistencies.
---
Saying something is "easy" for the people behind the scenes, genuinely might be near impossible. One small change is a cascade of bugs. Switching something from limit "X" to limit "1" should be a simple hot-fix.
---
Shit, I always thought it was a lightning gun
---
After reading the recent AMA I think I'm going to pass on Faerlina and Herod and take my chances with Stalagg. I think excessive layering will ruin my launch experience and 10+ hour queue times are a no-go.
---
&gt;I thought WoW was a carebear game in comparison.
---
- NPCs direct you where to go
---
- NPCs give you quests that will reward free XP for doing
---
- you get free XP if you log out (in the form of 200% rested bonus)

- you don't lose experience when you die
---
- you don't lose all your stuff when you die

WoW was made to be a casual friendly game from its beginning. And people today are complaining that it's casual friendly.

Those people only advertise how stupid they are.

That is sich a bad excuse Blizzard, come on...
---
Yeah, I care more about the skeletons than seeing some spam.
---
Give me my mass graves back.
---
Give it a bit and they’ll just start merging servers anyway when the hype dies off.
---
Get rid of that chair. Turn up the incline for calves of steel all the way to 60
---
Are you gonna lose your job come launch?
---
... literally not saying anything they don't know. 
---
Server queues will be a thing at launch and at layer removal.
---
If you don't like it - take them up on their free server transfer to a dead realm when layering gets removed.
---
Big if true
---
no maintenance first week confirmed
---
You're in for a very rude surprise come launch week.

---
There's still going to be skeletons. They're not removing them altogether.
---
Even if we only look at the one example from the comment above mentioning hate speach, I could argue that you are wrong here. It does not offer anything meaningful to the gameplay and in making a simple change like this they can avoid situations that could waste time and resources.
---
I can’t answer that, I just pulled my info right off of classic.db I’m not sure what state the items are in.
---
1. Depends on how many shards you want to bring.
---
2. Depends on how min/max you want to get while DPSing.
---
3. Soulstones, healthstones, summon people, maintain curses, DPS and don't die or overaggro.  
---
Realistically though, usually doesn't take long to farm the minimum shards, also you can throw shards into the bank so you can have a small stockpile saved up from when you were grinding for example that you can just take out for the raid.
---
Why did I have to scroll this much you find your comment?
---
Was gonna say: "Here we go with the slippery slope theory again! No skeletons? Flying Mounts comfirmed!"
---
nice
---
in retail you can make swastica with feasts
---
This is awesome.-Dagger rogue
---
They are not disabling them because of performance, they stated the reason was people spelling mean things, which can be avoided with simply random rotation or slightly random position. Are you really defending their weak argument? Are you one of those sensitive fellas that freak out if someone writes something mean?
---
Blizzard was just insistent everyone will quit. Now they are realizing they will probably have to open more servers and allow character transfers. Probably much sooner than people would have liked.
---
Probably best version of the meme I’ve ever seen, great work homie. I’ll never forget one of the originals way back in 2009 with hitlers account getting banned for bottling lol. Making blizzard the antagonist in this is genius
---
Bravo good redditor, bravo.
---
You do realize each person is still leaving a single skeleton right? 
---
They're only removing the ability for a single person to spam a shit ton of them.
---
That was really the magic of it. had no idea of what real endgame was about for a long time. Hit 60 pretty late. Just wandered azeroth, exploring the unknown world for the first time.

You're mistaken if you think people are "bawling" about the price.

They already said in their FAQ that no TCG will be implemented in classic.
---
Recpeccing 2-5 times a week is 100g a week minimum, up to 250g a week once you cap the respec fee.
---
That chair is going to kill you back
---
What he’s saying is that for every major update there will likely be an influx of players. The AQ opening is an easy example of when the entire server will be in silithus - are they going to ‘layer’ the gong event? 
---
I’m of the opinion that classic is more popular than Blizz assumes and that they will either have layering longer than planned OR servers will melt and they make major hardware/software changes. One option is much less expensive than the other so my money is on continued layering.
---
This isn't EVE though.
---
The server actually could handle that many players. Blizzard is on record saying that layering is in place so 1,000 people aren't in one starting zone all competing over 20 quest mobs all at once. Mobs take 5 minutes to respawn, could you imagine what it would look like?  
---
Layering was introduced to eliminate player congestion in the early days of launch.
---
If you're looking for a theme park MMO, go retail. If you want to be challenged and actually have to work well with others, go classic.
---
Isn’t this illegal? Kinda like selling boost runs for real money?
---
Druids? Can they speak cross faction somehow?
---
They did, but people love misinformation.
---
The server seems to cope with acouple of hundred or more players in 1 area alright but you put 3000 in a starter zone its a different story. 
---
going from 500 to 1000 players isnt double the server load. its exponentially more load on the server per player. Going from 500 to 1000 is probably more like 4x or more. for double the players.

Don't you also have to set WoW to DX11 or something?
---
Some new age zoomer shit, who knows these days they're all on ADHD meds.
---
Yup. And if you ever start a business you will quickly realize who your friends are.
---
They'll all have some form of queue, I'd bet... but Shazzrah and Herod will be a whole different level. Like comparing 1 hour to 8 hours.
---
the advertising only happens in cities so just make it so bodies/skeletons disappear in cities...
---
Brd has the same layout, I ran around it a few times so I wouldn’t get lost in brd like I have every time on pservers
---
elixirs and flasks do not stack.  You have battle elixer slot and a defense elixer slot.  Flasks take both slots up.
---
BRD. My god could you imagine LFG dumping people at the start of vanilla BRD and being like “goodluck, ps here’s a random quest for each of you in entirely different areas”.
---
Ah that sucks to hear :/
---
Rofl are you kidding? Most of us 40+ grandpas were ranked PvPers in our mid-20s when classic came, out and we've been itching for this for over a decade.
---
No, they didn't.
---
&gt;**Q:** Can I use my World of Warcraft Trading Card Game codes in WoW Classic?
---
&gt;**A:** Codes from the TCG won’t be usable in WoW Classic.

That simply says you can't use the actual loot cards.
---
Appreciate the response brother!

For pvp you do of you are troll. Great defense

---
The war for barren's chat has begun.  We are legion.   Praise.
---
I think people have every right to voice their opinion. So if you don't like it, take a seat with them too.
---
It depends on what you mean by "trade that [bfa] gold for classic gold". If you mean directly transfer gold from bfa to classic, no that is not possible as it would completely change the classic economy. If you mean find a guy who plays bfa and classic and convince him to give you some of his classic gold in exchange for some of your bfa gold, then yes of course you can do that but I'm sure the exchange rate wont be 1:1.
---
Real answer - you should try out both, it’s the same subscription. Once you’re at 10 or 20 hours played on each one you’ll probably be leaning one way or the other.
---
Cmon what’s the point of asking a question like that on this sub lol
---
Joke’s on me, I’m always useless at work.
---
Amen brother
---
The fact that people think they're entitled but would never make a guide themselves is astonishing.
---
Unsubbed and unfollowed. Fuck ya Joana, ya guides were always overrated anyway.
---
&gt; but removing the sight of the aftermaths of huge battles, long ganks, some world boss or corrupted blood nonsense, 
---
None of this is gone. Everyone still gets one skeleton that lasts till they die again. There's so much misinformation.
---
This is exactly why I think layering will be around longer than phase 1.
---
Skip. Boring chain, rewards suck. Half of it is escort.
---
Ah ok.
---
I'm hoping to do it in 10-12 realistically. Setting the goal is just something to keep me grinding if I'm 8hours in and close
---
Well it’s 2 different games
---
Do you want challenging end game content and balanced classes and stuff but also lots of hectic mechanics and more modern (retail)
---
Or do you want a slower game with more focus on the leveling phase and lots time sinks that are rewarding 
---
Also professions have actual worth in classic whereas in retail it’s less profitable to sell crafted stuff compared to just selling the materials 
---
Due to balancing all professions are kinda worthless except like consumables and some mounts
---
You're omitting the fact that a Rockbiter swing also factors these in. The overall point is that the Windfury hits may do crazy damage, but you're going to average one WF per 5 swings. That's four swings where RB would be providing benefit, while WF doesn't. Off the top of my head, attack power only has .4x effectiveness on the extra hits as far as overall DPS is concerned.
---
record is 4d20h, so i guess all those streamers, rushers and tryhards pulling a 2-3nighter and proudly go to sleep at level 45something? haha. that's gonna be an epic adventure!
---
In vanilla, Chinese gold sites key logged you and stole your account. When the account was cleaned out, a level 1 character was made and added to the group to create body advertisements in Org and Ironforge. Sometimes they would even float in the air instead of on the ground.  
---
Where's that sub you thought they were paying?
---
But you can't have a MMORPG that's just static without updates. Sooner or later the content will be finished and new content needs to be added in. I agree they need to preserve the core elements of what makes vanilla and classic great but there should still be updates IMO
---
Yeah thats gonna be fun. Im pretty pumped to do the escort through the prison again. Idk why but Shil Dinger always cracked me up.
---
Maybe if you're in a competent group the entire time you're online. If you have to find a group, or you group with bad players, questing and grinding is definitely faster.
---
Buy an MMO mouse firstly, you can map most things to that and play onehanded just fine.
---
If you want to be more complex, you can freely map those sound board things with a billion buttons that you can probably put under your left foot.  
---
Buttons are big enough to accurately hit with your toes until your hand heals.  
---
Also I can relate to that, I broke my fourth and fifth metacarpal in my dominant hand.. was fucking hard doing anything with a giant cast and metal rods inserted into it.
---
If they were smart they would just swim into fatigue in ghost form

I was already at the Respec cap before hitting 60. Making money in wow is not like in real life it doesn't all come in one big check every two weeks. I would make 50g and then some for consumes. Raid day comes I Respec and stock up. Down to 0 one week I didn't have the gold to go back to holy and had to get a loan. Idk why this is so hard for you to understand. Maybe you started later when inflation of gold made these small numbers hard to comprehend.  Idk why I bother explaining to you.
---
If you scroll down a bit on the webpage there's a 60 day 100% money back garanteed with no questions asked.
---
No harm in giving it a try. If you’re going to sub anyway you can always play each for an hour or so and decide which style you like best.
---
The games are different in class mechanics and gameplay, but a lot is still very similar. So test it out see what you like. 
---
You could also play retail until classic releases and then try out classic and go from there. WoW is a great game whatever version you decide on.
---
Must ban to protect people from naughty pixels. Woke af.
---
2h fury to level.
---
I don't get all the accusatory posts directed at blizzard about layering. 
---
If they need to use it, I'm sure they'll do it again as it offers a solution to a major issue. Without it, you'd have unplayable servers until people got frustrated and stopped trying to log in.
---
The end goal is obviously money, as it is with any corporation, so blizzard wants to avoid people leaving the game, and it's in their best interest to get as many people logged in as possible. Just because that's there goal though, doesn't mean they're going to blatantly lie and go against the community that is going to support this version of wow.
---
I don't know why people think they're lying to our faces about layering. I'm sure their intention is to drop it as soon as possible. Whether or not classic ever sees the numbers it sees on launch again is yet to be seen, and they'll address it when it's necessary.
---
What do you suggest they do instead?  Why do you think blizzard wants layering so bad and is willing to lie to the community to make it happen? What do they gain?
---
I hope blizzard will keep the skeletons as they were before!
---
Lol k.

THIS IS NOT THE METHOD GUILD RAIDING CLASSIC.
---
THEY ARE SHOWING A MIX OF ASSORTED PLAYERS.
---
I would feel more inclined if he were honest about his intentions from the start.
---
I wasn't going to use this guide regardless, but it is dishonest to lead people on and build up hype on twitch then switch the guide to a subscription model.
---
I believe it's likely because he didn't or won't complete his in game guide (which I would pay for)
---
Honestly, they are both on the same sub. Just try both out and see which one you like more! Goodluck in your choice!

The AV thing reminds me of the old “/e *playernamehere* has reported you for being AFK, to prevent being removed from the battleground, type /AFK”

Weeded out the dummies while waiting for the gates to open

That obviously means the items will never be obtainable in Classic, as they were only able to be gotten via game codes in 1.12.1.
---
Cool, so what's the problem then? What is Joanna doing wrong? 
---
Fuck your crab bucket mentality.
---
i can’t believe whining like yours is even allowed on retail.

&gt;Have you played WoW in the past 2 expacs?

Lol imagine playing retail
---
Oh yeah, me too. Goals are good to have something to work towards

This post is one of the reasons I am worried about the Classic launch.
---
If that punkass dwarf Nessingwary thinks I’m going to go traipsing through the Azerothian equivalent of Vietnam (complete with horde VC) looking for all those goddamn pages he can kiss my ass.

Seriously. Considering the trivial shit that sets people off around here, if video games really caused gun violence, the U.S. would be wiped off the map.

Yea seems like a lot of votes for hunter. Seems like the way to go unless someone else provides some more info.
---
Yeah and people know the appropriate itemization and how to beat every boss. They also know every quest. Hell you know to avoid Defias Pillagers.
---
There's nothing "authentic" about Classic. It's a facsimile. Gaming culture and literally the access to information has changed.
---
It's disgraceful, really. To spread disinformation at a time like this.
---
First time in my career I've had vacation approved.  See y’all in azeroth
---
Title is very misleading. There are skeletons in Classic WoW, just not more than one per player.
---
Very much leaning this way after all the responses.
---
Lol these leftists don't use logic.
---
One person swore on WoW once, better make the swear filter a requirement instead of an option! "Oh that's not necessary!" you say? Well it offended someone so we're just going to change a core mechanic that's loved by the community to ensure it never happens again.
---
Please.
---
&gt;that could waste time and resources.
---
Do you understand how simple it would be for a GM to clear 14 skeletons from an area if they were being used in a derogatory way? You think this is a big enough problem that they're quantifying the resources it would take to manage? lmao okay
---
150 v 150 world pvp and 1500 players in AQ event still leaves the remaining 8500 players spread out across the world compared to launch where there would be 10000 players in Elwynn/Durotar/Tirisfal/Teldrassil/Mulgore. The amount of people participating in the said events is going to be lower than launch pop of starting zones no matter what.
---
Upvoted. Fear ward is nice, but these two are both amazing and get lost when people compare priest races
---

That's not terrible for the economy. The amount of gold on the classic server didn't change. If you could move gold from BFA to classic, meaning actually put more gold into the classic economy, that is what would fuck it up. People moving gold from char to char within the classic economy is just how an economy works.
---
I've levelled prot and while you kill slower, your surviveability is insane. You also have less downtime eating.
---
MOMMY, THEY SPELLED BAD WORDS!!!!!
---
Just because his guide is over a decade old doesn't mean his business model should be.  No need to attack me boss
---
ffs stop upvoting
---
Can mods ban this plz? Extremely poor taste and far from "humor"
---
In Joana's run it looks like they don't use hunters mark at lower levels but do a lot at higher levels. Not sure at what point it becomes worth it though. They also primarily stick with aspect of the cheetah and mainly switch to hawk if they're about to be attacked
---
So if there's free guides out there why does this bother you so much?
---
Well then I'll see you on Tuesday.
---
That's not really much of a rebuttal in your favor my dude. If anything it just speaks volumes against your standing point of your argument. Lol
---
Because were half of what he wants to try. Were experts in classic
---
What’s bad about layering is the actual question here 
---
The servers will have a couple times more players on them 
---
Mob spawn rates won’t be adjusted 
---
Tagging mobs works different 
---
You wanna wait an hour to kill a quest mob at launch ? 
---
Also yeah server strain naturally 
---
Wouldn’t it look the same as in vanilla if they layered the events since there’s way more players than back then per server ?
---
I healed raids up to WotLK as a holy paladin. Priests would outheal me, but I never really really out of mana. 
---
Paladins are really good at single target healing, and can do well at multiple targets, but a priest will generally push a lot more healing, especially in target rich environments. 
---
All that said, I'm still going holy paladin in vanilla, with a priest and mage for alts.
---
They already answered that with a no. I don't get where the confusion comes from.
---
It's a risk
---
He was getting plenty of support
---
People make plenty of guides and don’t even ask for donations, yet this guy expects payment? Fuck right off
---
Regardless, Joana sucks at the game. Yes he has the world record and he’s he is very knowledgeable about quests and routes, but dear god does his mechanics suck. He back peddles all the time, consistently breaks his auto shot, and there are plenty of people much faster than him. He doesn’t have any reason to charge for a guide anyone else can make.
---
So do the people that have been paying for twitch sub and donate to his channel get free access???
---
Technically a zoomer, no idea wtf it means but I would have to guess it's the shirt.
---
That's a cool suggestion!
---
An entire server?! 
---
There may be guild info out there somewhere however.
---
I got caught by that one. Well played. /bow
---
I know and this makes me sad. Voice chat used to be half the reason to play wow.
---
The change to skeletons is the first one I've cared about at all.  I actually understand this disappointment.  My priority list might differ from yours, but that doesn't mean your opinions are invalid to me.  This is an unexpected and conscious change, and some people are upset about it.  It's okay for them to express it here, as people have been doing for countless other issues for many months.
---
There was an AMA today and a lead software engineer at Blizzard said exactly the opposite of what you just said.  He said that layering is being used because the servers cannot support tons of players in one zone at the same time. I linked his AMA answer in my original post.
---
Email provided by ISPs is categorically not a net neutrality violation, and I encourage you to light a fat blunt and get educated.
---
man so many people have no idea how long it is actually going to take them to level
---
I would just avoid all the full servers right now unless you already have friends on one. And even then I would still avoid Herod. That covers them all. 
---
The rest are all just normal servers not claimed by some ridiculous faction.
---
did I say it was remade? years of work, as in the original work.
---
I was under the understanding that they're just having bosses have their entire loot table from the start, so if it's not a boss drop and came with BWL, I'd assume it would come out in the BWL phase.
---
If you roll alliance  priest, your are intentionally putting your raid at a disadvantage by not bringing fear ward. 
---
Paladins are single target Healers, they are the absolute best tank healer and pvp warrior healer in the game no exceptions. Paladins basically never run out of mana if played correctly have extremely strong buffs and auras and have a crazy strong tool kit. 
---
1 Druid is brought to a raid for mark of the wild and a battle rez.
---
Isn't layering mostly being used to combat the near certainty of dead servers without it? Tons of people start, they add layers to allow the server to balloon up to several times its intended size, and then as the expected people start dropping off in a few weeks/months, they reduce layers until they're left with 1. This is preferable (in their opinion, at least) to having normal sized servers that simply die when that drop off occurs, necessitating realm merges.
---
That’s hilarious hahaha. Not classic, but another fun thing I used to do during BC was to go to starter areas on my PVE realm, find a noob and pop snake trap on mobs they were fighting. They would kill the mob and then immediately attack and kill the noob even if they weren’t flagged. I didn’t need to be flagged either so I could be a dick and no one could stop me haha.
---
That doesnt stop WrA

Eh the'll be fine
---
I agree. So much of a vibe at the moment about how hard Classic is going to be. These people obviously didn't grow up playing games like Battletoads LOL
---
"fun" differs from person to person
---
Holy moly, you do not understand any jokes do you?
---
THIS!!!!!!
---
This would fit great with the x-files theme
---
My understanding after the AMA is items will be in their 1.12 state if they were part of the game originally (or introduced before 1.10), which these were, they just sucked until they were fixed in 1.10.
---
https://itemization.info/item/11841
---
There are things from 1.10 that won’t be in the game until phase 5 though.

Lvl a bank alt to 5 and learn enchanting/leatherworking.

Quick everyone downvote the post to save us all who now know!
---
I am pretty sure that all of us are quite surprised of how popular this thing turned out to be. I never thought Classic would get so much interest and clearly Blizzard didn't either. 
---
Dis gonna be good!
---
Imagine using guides to level. Now imagine PAYING for these guides too. Is your iq really that low? Big yikes

I'm aware of that. It will be even worse when layering ends.

A. You won’t be able to buy and sell WoW Tokens in WoW Classic, but you can buy and sell them in World of Warcraft and use them toward your game time.
---
Oh my god. I was watching that first Xrewz video and writing everything out myself manually. I had legitimately just reached page 5 of a Word document. I had no idea someone else had already done it all.

Dope. Tempted by those Blameux and Fairbanks shirts even though I’m playing on Herod. They’re just cool characters in general so might be worth!
---
I disagree with OP too but I hate your reasoning. Big companies make mistakes all the time, and the playerbase sometimes *does* know better.
---
haha imaging think the private guilds have any chance against method
---
NICE

I say go Classic. Experience it from the real beginning. If you find it's not for you give retail a go.

Stop whining about layering.
---
It will be a great feature in classic and absolutly needed to make the highest populated servers playable.
---
This sounds like some amazing fun!  I'd love to see a video compilation of this.
---
That being said, I imagine your rep on that server might be a bit... tarnished.
---
666 upvotes. Your Welcome.

You could always start Tauren and run over to orc starting area to start questing. You'll get rep with orcs to be able to buy a wolf mount. Won't work for druid of course as no druid trainers that side.

Yep back to spirit lady in the grave yard
---
No? Layering is used to reduce overall player traffic in a region (ie. 5 people waiting for hogger per layer vs. 1000 players on a single layer waiting for hogger) and to reduce strain in any given server (each layer can be on unique hardware which allows for hogger example).
---

Or you know... pve..

You can, a 2015 budget laptop can play the game.
---
Windfury has the same synergy with slow and fast wpns. Slow is better for big bursts, and also good at start of combat since you get a free hit at the start. But overall windfury provides +0.4x autoattack dps (more because of atk pwer bonus), regardless of speed.

Oh that is cool thank you might have to check it out tomorrow morning!

No one ever said that. And don't blame the community for not accepting your reposts.
---
I swear to fucking god 😂😂😂😂. I vividly remember hunters claiming everything was loot for them. One time the hunters in our guild conspired to troll the fuck out of our casters. Our GM was a hunter so he was in on it too. 
---
They all straight up tried to convince everyone that the claw of chromaggus was perfectly designed for hunters because it provided a significant buff to their arcane shot. One of them came up with these crazy ass fabricated numbers. And they all were creating these insane arguments about how spell power hunters with arcane shot spec is the new trend in patch 1.12. The GM was playing along and talking about how he’ll let the hunters bid on it. And they all had more dkp then the mages. The mages were absolutely livid. The drama that ensued was hilarious. Finally after like 10 minutes and some arguing that was getting too serious, they admitted it was a giant joke. I wish I saved the logs from that shit.
---
All right, so in the beginning Void Lords had claimed an uninhabited Azeroth, they were essentially beings that existed along with the Titans who lacked the power of creation but were still able to manipulate things. They sent some Old Gods to burrow deep within the earth, and the Pantheon created the aesir and the vanir to fight them. One of  the titans ripped the leader of the Old Gods free from the earth and the energies that flowed from where he was torn were patched by the aesir/vanir, the place that was left was the Well of Eternity.
---
Eventually a tribe of dark trolls settled around this point, and over time the energies transformed them into the Night Elves (and also most likely the Tauren, although nobody can say for certain since Tauren don't keep written history.) These new beings worshiped Elune (the earth-mother in Tauren) and in an effort to grow closer to her, they studied the energies that allowed them to manipulate nature itself.
---
Hope this helps.

which is the best one?

Who gives a fuck?

Well he didn't say if he used rested xp or not. I've done 5 days too with rested xp without really trying too hard.
---
Him disappering is being invited by a friend to another layer and thus avoiding getting involved.

Hmmm I dunno. How so? You could add new content to get the item. Or maybe special enchants. Just ideas. I didn't like jewelcrafting but was a neat concept.
---
nop
---
That’s one thing about classic I never missed. I had a hunter and it was always me and the rogue fighting over gear, especially at low levels. We gonna have holy paladins wearing cloth for heals again. 😂. Meh, either way, it will be fun.
---
As a kid I took this as a personal challenge like , ha you saying I'm weak and need to wait for heals ? I'll show you , needless to say I was and did need healing. 5 mins later groupless in westfall looking for a new vc grp
---
10 months and many thousands of hours of work. I created it because alliance didn't have a good accessible guide. It started out like you just described. Hope you enjoy =).
---
You don't have to spend $$ at the shop, but it's designed to make you want to. He never said you have to, just that it pushes you to.
---
The problem with the cash shop being a significant source of revenue for the game is that they design the game around it. If they are less reliant on subscriptions to fund the company and more reliant on the cash shop, the game just has to be good enough to attract whales to spend $$$ on mounts. If it was funded 100% by subscriptions they would be more likely to make design decisions that favor good long-term gameplay.

---
I’m going Druid main (Enchanting/idk yet), Hunter (skinning/mining), and Rogue (lockboxes/herb/alchemy).
---
While you are correct that it isn't a huge deal, there is also nothing wrong with discussing it. The AMA was amongst the best I've seen and incredibly thorough. 
---
There is also nothing wrong with players respectfully trying to resolve something that they loved about vanilla. No one is doing anything wrong except for people making it sound like they'd just rather not play if it's not fixed.
---
More power to you but in that amount of time I'd be so tired, my eyes would be killing me, I'd probably smell my own BO my ass would hurt.
---
I'm truly jealous if you can deal with the drawbacks of 24+ hr sessions and still legitimately be having fun
---
Or trying to fund its development
---
My friends and I played horde for years. I never played alliance.
---
We figure it will be like going into it “new”. Level in zones I’ve never leveled in before. Play with the enemy—I mean alliance.  
---
I always liked hanging out in darnasus as a horde. It was usually empty enough that I could hide fairly well. With a few fun PvP battles.
---
I love TB too. I think I’ll hide my nelf druid there, and maybe kill a few horde in my spare time.
---
Either way, it’s going to be fun! I’m picking the same faction as my friends, because my friends have always been the best part about wow
---
&gt;Items drop on death in most high level zones
---
That might be true but it's not like there is any risk involved most of the time. You can just walk back and pick your stuff up. Unless you die under some pretty specific circumstances.
---
Nonsense. I refuse to let the outrage culture take away the Hitler memes. The Diablo 3 still one still makes me cry laugh to this day.
---
I was expecting worse, that's kinda ok tbh.
---
There is a near 100% certainty you are just a giant piece of shit.
---
&lt;3
---
Rogues can't equip axes in vanilla
---
I'm calling BS on Pazorax. If a bunch of Linux nerds can get Nostalrius running with 10x population and all of the chaos that happened regularly, Blizzard can too. They need to step it up.

I WANT MY VANILLA EXPERIENCE TO BE NO CHANGES!
---
That's not true. I subbed for the name reservations, but I downloaded the client before I had activated my sub. It just said "You need a subscription or active game time" when I tried to log in.
---
What does that have to do with political correctness? They probably removed permanent skeletons cause it looks bad and strains the servers to have thousands and thousands of skeletons all over the place.
---
People are talking about "getting back to home". For me it is getting back to Mulgore.
---
I respect it, but that's still a difficult achievement.  If it takes 10 days (240 hours) /played that means you would need to play 17.14 hours a day every day.  While doable, just remember that every poop, every meal, every sleep needs to be done in under 7 hours a day.  
---
Let's say you can pull a Joana and do it in 116 hours?  Well, you'll have lots of time on the back end to hang around your preferred city and gloat.
---
Either way, good luck friend!
---
I only took a week off work! you give and you give... not going to hit 60 before life happens again

Why would a shaman need devilsaur tp heal?
---
You’re not even trying anymore
---
And people wonder why we paywalled our Alliance guide. Unfortunately while most people are genuine, you still get a few who decide to steal guides.
---
I think his point was more related to the fact it’s about leveling a holy/disc priest. 
---
These speedrunners go with hunter for a reason. Anyway, Just my 2 cents
---
That was vanilla.  This is classic.  They are not the same
---
*kills scummy alliance*
---
*corpse instantly moves 5 yards behind me and the scummy alliance resurrects*
---
"Nothing personnel kido"
---
5 yards is 4.57 meters
---
Omg, discord on the right. Imagine this guy running mach chicken on his treadmill, running raids, huffing and puffing on his mic lmao
---
so first of all, you don't have to have his guide. he made it. if i made those guides, i'd do the same thing. second of all, he's put a lot of work into the guides, and they're probably the best available online. 
---
a guide isn't necessary to level. it's not like he's charging you an extra fee to play the game. you can play the game and use addons, other free guides, etc. you just want HIS guide because it's clearly the best one, but you want it for free because you're either really poor or really cheap.
---
&gt;Meanwhile you're gunna go drop $45 at Taco bell tomorrow and support their CEO's coke and yacht habit.
---
This is some serious projection right here. Who the fuck spends 45$ at Taco Bell? Fuck off ya fat incel.
---
Thanks, I think Shaman is genuinely the best class that Classic has to offer someone so I can't wait to get down and dirty on the 26th!
---
The only reason I’m coming back to wow after 10 years Is that i don’t have to chase loot.
---
I can gear up and after that I stay competitive for eternity and can pvp whenever I feel like it for how long I feel like it.
---
That's wrong, it's 800g before discounts.
---
You can play solo, but the way the game is structured, you will find people to group up with organically. You will have no problem finding people questing around you to group up. Two solo players will move slower than a group of two players.  
---
You should play on a PvP server no matter what, but that's a matter of opinion. Just be a nice person and pay it forward. You'll make new friends and join a guild in no time. :)
---
Folcred?
---
I really hope you guys reconsider this or find an alternative solution.
---
Any recommendations on what filters to use? Or, willing to upload your profile? :P. I actually find wow is hard for me to use reshade on compared to other, older mmos. 
---
Often it feels like the changes I make aren't making the game look much better, whereas dark age of Camelot with the right reshade is beautiful.
---
Try /camp when unable to stay at a normal inn but find a little empty tent model in the wild
---
that is pretty shortsighted of them as the release of phase 2 will have a massive resurgence of players
---
Pretty sure classic will have at least 10k pops, or even more.
---
They've said medium(2019) is equal to full(2004) population-wise. Considering vanilla servers had like 3-4k limits, I'd say classic will have like 10-15k players allowed per server.
---
You must work from home. I see that Cisco IP phone.
---
You’re talking about the gamblers falacy. It would be wrong to say that because I have flipped ten heads in a row that the next one must be tails. The question here thought is what are the odds after x runs will y have dropped at least once. It’s taking the whole series into context
---
I love every single one of you
---
My back, neck and ass is hurting from just seeing this setup.
---
o/
---
Actually, I think I'd be more accepting of it if you could select a specific layer when you login to the server, and be fixed to that layer, only interacting (in chat too) with those on that layer.
---
Pretty sure he was making fun of people like OP who can't enjoy the game without having the ground hidden by skeletons.
---
Ah yes, blowme. What every couple needs.
---
Thanks for the  reply. Would that talent tree look mostly like the endgame fury tree you have on there, just swapping the dw spec for improved  slam?
---
Yea I'm not sure /u/rjmk means, I only ended up replacing old gear around 64 to 65
---
Damn you're right. This is an alliance meme isn't it?
---
Hi neighbor
---
This was 2005 or 2006. I remember mainly because they were my guildies. I played so much pvp that I remember lots of Alliance players. Some stuff just sticks I suppose.

---
Mage vs Rogue : In-depth PVP techniques. I would watch this...
---
You have to have some serious stockholm syndrome to shill for massive cable companies that routinely fuck us over.
---
To answer your question directly, without opinion; yes, you can easily level solo (at varying rates between classes mind you). If you start at launch you will not run into too much pvp until patch 2. The honor system entering the game turns the open world into a much more dangerous place.
---
Very cool, Thanks!
---
Yeah, I can understand that. However I truly feel that the genre I (we) fell in love with is gone. It's completely changed now and I don't think we'll ever see those games on a large, popular scale again. Sure there will be passion projects like Pantheon, but nothing  like when mmorpgs were all the rage. WoW from TBC-WotLK was basically the pinnacle of mmorpgs, and I'd love to re-experience that amazing gaming journey.
---
Mage.
---
It's between mage or hunter but hunter has more to lose if blizzard decides to nerf a few specific known gold farming techniques.
---
Mages will always, at a minimum, be able to aoe mobs for vendor trash or whatever.
---
On a pve server is it first to tag wins? Can't even fight over it? I hate pve servers even more now.
---
500-1000 people won't show up to down a world boss
---
RemindMe! 1 Day
---
I feel like having a level 60 character should be enough right? It shows you're quite dedicated to the game. I think only catering towards the most hardcore players could be a bad idea and I'll give you an example:
---
In Old school Runescape there was a poll that meant players would be able to enlarge icons in the spellbook which essentially made them easier to click and therefore the game was slightly easier to play. The most hardcore PvP players voted no, because they thought that have enlarged icons would make the game too easy, and the 75% threshold was not reached. While the majority of players would've had a smoother playing experience, the hardcore players ruined it.
---
If you don’t like retail wow, and most people don’t, then you accept classic+ as THE option. There is no other. Blizzard already said they’re going to listen to the community on this because that’s what got them here anyway. They aren’t going to A) go through the whole process of ruining wow again for everyone, or B) blindly release content without heavy community input.
---
I’m sorry you fucking retards blame the community for every little issue, and think OSRS’s system is extremely problematic just because sometimes people make votes that later sway to the other side but newsflash that’s how all civil societies work 
---
The OSRS polling system revived a dead scripted RNG shit game and made it ridiculously profitable. Blizzard can see this. It worked and it will work.
---
Yes it is.
---
Was thinking about taking some time off for release, but don't wanna waste my time off days by waiting for server crashes.
---
Benediction
---
Clean up corpses for lower leveled players to get rid of the gold sellers. Should be somewhat easy to implement
---
those snowballs were amazing. we would time it on vent and get a single person with 3 snowballs at once launching them extremely far. I remember one mage casting snowfall after we launched him. He went so far he landed way out of render distance. 
---
during that time our team never won, because we caused giant snowball fights every game. people would either get pissed and snow all us back or have fun snowballing us back. but it was great being horde, since a big clashing point had you above the alliance, letting you launch people 1 at a time into the middle of the alliance zerg. or if we chained the snowballs together, past the alliance zerg. 
---
my favorite was using my parachute cloak and having my 2 guildmates launch me. went completely over the alliance group and dropped a nade on my way while spamming emotes. I landed far enough away from them, but I died to archers anyway.
---
I don't follow your logic. As you say: 
---
&lt; Each layer will hold a vanilla realms entire population, which is much smaller than current servers.
---
So your saying that Classic servers are already bigger than they were in vanilla.... doesn't that make the queue smaller since we can put more people on the server. 
---
Ultimately in phase 2 it seems they will need to be back down to the size of a vanilla server to preserve authenticity. So if server sizes are larger at launch then they are in phase 2, then it seems that one of the benefits of laying is to help with queues. 
---
&gt; Some players have asked us to use realm caps and login queues to handle the demand, and while those are tools we have at our disposal, we don’t want to rely on them exclusively, because they keep people from playing the game.
---
This quote from the ama seems to suggest that they are using a larger player cap.... up to a point... only then do they introduce queues. The higher the cap... the smaller the queue.
---
I remember helping a friend do this off swamp of sorrows.. good times.

Calm down man, I get that you are excited about Classic, so am I. I'm bummed that traps are going to work like the way they do too. And I really like Kevin Jordan too. But if these guys are pouring their heart and soul into this project, and some of the developers are actually the same developers (read the comment about not wanting to edit your own lines of code), then why are you getting all worked up for? Why can you not trust them for what they've delivered so far and see they are not half assing this?
---
This looks like a Toontown enemy
---
All the BoE epics I got in Vanilla were
---
Robes of Insight on my priest while leveling
---
Hammer of the Northern Wind &amp; Helm of Narv on my warlock, both while grinding Felcloth.
---
A bit surprisingly, the Helm of Narv sold for nearly 700g, after I put it on the AH for 180g starting bid with no buyout for 24 hours.
---
Frostmourne i think
---
Eat and poop during flights.  Sleep during prime time.
---
This is *specifically* incorrect. There are long histories of players taking their grievances against another members of their own faction by using extra-game comms (Teamspeak, Mumble) to organize bounties on these players for gold via neutral AH. I've witness it many times, even on RP-PVP servers.
---
I've seen entire shitstorms in the realm subforums for this that amounted to nothing. If you are killed by another player of the opposing faction, nothing will happen.
---
If you summon people of your *own* faction to the bottom of an ocean or off a cliff, that's abuse that could land you in trouble.
---
"Downfall". Its actually a great movie, and the first one made by Germans themselves that depicts Hitler unless im mistaken.
---
might be a sensitive question so don't answer if you don't feel like it but doesn't that make you more than enough money to get a more comfortable set up, at least replacing the chair for something with better lumbar support and the snowboard and cat tree for something more fit for purpose? Or just really like this setup and all its quirks
---
This guy massively overestimates the number of people hitting 60.
---
That monitor angle, even while standing, how is your neck not jacked? Hopefully that board's edges aren't primed for the slopes. My neck, back, and wrists hurt just looking at this photo.

This is exactly what I was going to comment, word by word.
---
There are plenty of boss drops in high level dungeons that drop fire-resist gear. It is not limited to being crafted.
---
Stay in retail
---
Whynotboth.jpg haha. Yes, he's a special kind.

Definitely try classic. Maybe wait until the initial rush dies down so you aren’t completely turned off by the crowds in starter zones and queue times. Make the call for yourself

 A Priest. In 5 days /played. Like Joana levels. 
---
I'm all done with this conversation. If the drool on your keyboard hasn't short-circuited it already and you try to type anything else, just know that you're talking to yourself.
---
I was always undergeared. Was never around at raid times and didn't have time for the rank 14 grind. I did ok though.
---
That’s a 159cm reverse camber desk brah
---
Well, in classic, there are going to be a LOT of pug runs, where you had chance to get those items without any gold. Think about it, those were DRUID pants. In private servers any raiding druid (1-2) slots would be showered with tier items, absolutely no competition. One of the biggest source of shards for a guild, druid tier T1 in MC.
---
Poor Joergen
---
Thanks dude. Im biased obviously... but i think its a lot better than many others that dont even attempt to match body language/speech to the subtitles.
---
They’re also saying they’re four hours (2%) slower than Joana with a holy priest specifically.
---
I dont understand, I think you did the meme wrong
---
Never ever spec prot before 58.
---
Everything 10-58 can be tanked as fury or arms, even with a 2H wep,
---
Wut
---
But will you have a full set?
---
Okay I guess i'll be THAT guy. This is extremely douchey, i guess you already know that. But what's hilarious is everyone laughing and saying thats so funny here yet if they were on the receiving end they would rage, I 100% guarantee you.
---
Mine was flurry axe too! Dropped off a random mob in Tanaris on my fury warrior. I went absolutely nuts
---
I know, but its better than nothing.
---
I fully support keeping longer skeleton time
---
Not on pvp servers! Right?
---
I never hit 60 until I came back at end of WoD. I'd get to 55 on a character and then start another one because 55-60 was a grind and there wasn't much to do once there so I just got into that habit
---

Sorry I still don't know wtf fantising means.
---
Nah. Getting things done irl is the best ime.
---
Not classic they didn't. I can play actual vanilla-LK (pservers) on ultimate on my i5/hd4000, for classic I played on 2 ( next to lowest graphics setting) and it was playable, but not great. Averaged 20-40 fps.
---
  classic is using the modern graphics engine, which requires a LOT more juice than original classic.
---
Yep a lot
---
Noone tell him
---
Gamers truly are the most entitled. This dude has undoubtedly put hundreds of hours into these guides, he is allowed to charge for them.
---
Shouldn't be free IMO, unless it's free with purchasing TBC (again).
---
then you get distracted and miss the 1 second window you allowed your self to enter the world. Cue the queue, 20000th in line.
---
Same, I wanted to go to a PVE server but everyone of my friends are just clamoring for PVP.
---
WTF monthly subscription. Now I feel bad for even bringing up that he was reworking his guide. I could see a possible 1 time fee or something. Bah.
---
I did it and holy shit does it feel dead and boring. If you want something to practice spamming keys again, go for it.
---
Thank you brother.
---
You took the name fear and made a shaman?
---
very important comment ++
---
At least theres enough people to tell tipsout what to do and what to say.
---
Yeah I bet you think discord servers are representative of server populations as well
---
Guess you will be role-playing as a spy!
---
Why it’s much more fun to troll people
---
So basically you can do this game solo, certain raids you will have to join a guild to participate in most likely.
---
Dungeons, quests, leveling, and pvp can all be done in a PuG scenario.
---
Do you have a link? Cause i saw several times that Blizzard plan's to rework the items in phase 5, like it was at the original release.
---
Yeah Phase 3, right?  Thanks, that make sense; I'll keep those brackets in mind.
---
&gt; They also reiterated that layering is going away in p2. I took that to mean that come hell or high water, layering is going away. If there are still 30k players active on Herod when layering goes away, welp, guess there will be 27k people in queue for Herod.
---
I agree with this... but still don't understand your first point. 
---
&gt; Not when 60k people are crowding around (3kx10layers=30k) spots on Herod (numbers made up). Even the biggest vanilla servers had a pop of ~3k online and 5-10k in queue. 
---
I agree there will be massive queues on herod. Say there are 60k people... with layering we can fit 20k people.... that leaves a queue of 40k. But say the limit with layering was 30k people... that reduces the queue to 30k people waiting. And this is why layering helps with queues.... or am I missing something?
---
I’m going to find a hunter friend and do this, thanks for the hot tip!
---
The one horde zone thay makes me jealous as an alliance player. Mulgore is simply awesome.
---
Are we sure it will use the old version? Because I read in another thread it was changed in 1.12.1 and people seemed unsure which system Classic will use. I must have bought it after the change back in the day then in that case because I don't remember I would have paid that much for it haha!
---
It's all fun n games till you enter a dungeon with your mom combat weapons
---
Shazzrah!
---
yep, [https://youtu.be/zPSDVj0mNcY?t=5259](https://youtu.be/zPSDVj0mNcY?t=5259) right there.  
---
iirc he said something like "ok chat, if we complete the dungeon without a wipe you are going to twitch prime".  
---
You can see the twitch primes in the chat there
---
But it would be an insurmountable mistake
---
So how high are you right now?
---
In 2004… good luck looking it up online.
---
That's how I came to (sort of) like PvP!
---
Where are you pulling 385? The attack power bonus from WF only gives 88 extra damage per hit. 
---
It would be 888 * 2 for 1776, then multiply by .2 for 355.2. Admittedly till higher than RB, but not by nearly as much. I'm also not exactly sure what kind of gear would net you a white hit of 800, but looking at near-bis after release of BWL, average hit is about 500.
---
Using your calculations with 500 instead of 800, we're looking at 173 bonus for RB, and 235.2 bonus for WF. That's a difference of 60 damage per hit or 16dps. That's not even including the fact that each hit of WF has an independent roll to glance.
---
Man that g-string is grinding up her vagina harder than John mcdoodle are his noodles.

Not 49 bracket but the others yes.

Check out my expanded prebis lists for every class and spec. It includes gear sets too.

NA - Any PVP Server - Horde
---
Will be playing an orc rogue, looking for someone to grind 24 hours on the 1st day and a shit ton throughout the week.
---
I do believe their was a quest or two that people never did.
---
If I were a rogue my favorite item would also be a book, manual of eviscerate IX
---
I leveled 3 characters to 60 in vanilla when I was 17, I leveled 2 characters to 60 on nostalrius, I leveled 2 more characters to 60 on lights hope. I have done the 1-60 too many times. My guild heard about the dungeon farming method so I’m excited to just try something new.
---
Our 5 man comp has the week off all paid vacation, so day 1 will be a 24 marathon / LAN party, the rest of the week will be 14-16 hours. We are hoping to get 60 by Sunday. 
---
I then have to level a hunter to 60 so I canfarm gold and  keep my warrior prot.
---
Please help me.
---
Just change the number or whatever is triggered the code to clear one, let like 10-20 exist of one player dead, their last 20 deaths should be visible in the world, a reasonable but still large limit to truly have the visual exist in high wipe locations. we even saw this on progressing through something epic like illidan phases..
---
Meh, it’s $5. I’ll pay it, the guides are good.
---
Even fails at not having a life. Smh
---
People keep repeating this but IRONICALLY none of you are giving good solutions. The very people you are referring to are you and all the people crying about the flaws in OSRS’s system without giving a viable alternative. Blizzard didn’t get to retail by polling the community, every decision they made was theirs. You cannot absolve blizzard from responsibility when it is convenient for you
---
So you all have been viciously against any changes but seem to not care that much about a change?
---
Yeah
---
Yeah just a taste......
---
People keep talking about layering in comments when the OP is talking about the exact opposite. If blizz servers can't handle a lot of people withotu layering, what will happen when layering will be turned off, that's the question, also does anyone think there will be 3k people on when layering gets turned off? It will be way more than that, so in both cases it will suck massively, either because massive overpop without layering, or servers crashing without layering, or both
---
You personally attack him for no reason because he wants skeletons to last longer for immersiveness and as a warning that an area is dangerous. Yet he is clearly the “giant piece of shit...manchild that cries big ol’ tears because they can’t spam slurs...” your logic is truly brilliant. Pull your head out of your ass please.
---
This isn't pvp - he's lying/luring his fellow horde, into an alliance on voice chat to get MC'd.
---
At name reservation you just create the char as fast as you can, no matter what class, race or appearance it is. Just reserve the names in first 15 seconds. You can remake the char later. 
---
I still have most created chars on placeholder chars, need to move certain names to certain accounts, recreate them to proper class etc.
---
And what do you think will happen once the layers are removed on a realm? How do you think will the server host multiple times the number of people from vanilla when the cap is not increased? What you are saying makes absolutely no sense at all. The layers are temporary, once they are removed, one realm holds all the population of multiple layers, meaning having a massively increased population cap compared to vanilla.  
---
This was Ion describes in the video you linked, it's what /u/pazorax described in the comment I linked, it's what is described in the blue post I linked, which, again, is in the Classic forum. Do you really think they would arbitrarily lower the pop limit on modern servers when their tech allows a lot more, even after people have created and played their characters?
---
This will be my last answer on this topic to you.
---
The thing is that people aren't only outpacing Joana with hunters, they're also outpacing him on subpar classes like paladins and rogues, albeit in a limited beta. And disc/holy isn't even that bad, especially not pre-40.
---
So if random speedrunners can outpace Joana, then yeah, I believe a random redditor could hit 60 in 5 days on a priest.
---
Layering becomes a potential problem towards end game, says Madseason. Otherwise it should be good for early grinding.
---
Part of the fun of wow. Pvp servers especially are a bit sadomasochistic, and you kind of have to be a bit of both to enjoy the full experience.
---
I lost my job 2 weeks ago.
---
Im a bit depressed because i need a ne one before classic. So i dont duck it Up when classic launch. 
---
GG
---
That is pretty cool, i just hope you like their looks, for i doubt you can recreate any of them and keep one of each faction.
---
Can you make a third character of any faction on the server?
---
Personally I think shadow priest / warlocks fit better with some type of blindfold as well, makes them at least *300%* more badass. Really sells that "closed their eyes to the void" type feeling.
---
I always wondered how they managed to die in exact spots in the middle of orgrimar in midair to form letters.
---
This is only good if you want to min/max your character.
---
It’s a massive nightmare for roleplaying though. Everybody is gonna look the same.
---
How is this not griefing?  Lying to fellow horde, while working with someone on other faction.  This definitely isn't just pvp.
---
Was wondering why you had that Cisco phone every office seems to have lol.
---
You mean APES?
---
I even didnt read this but just no.
---
if you ask random people on the Internet what you should do, then you are doing something wrong
---
All depends on what they keep or don’t keep mage would be a great option as well because, you can farm DM North for the dog packs early on they drop blues and trash loot that sells for a lot at vendor. Great money making method. Also when ZG comes out mage is the only class able to farm the crocs there that drop the rep tokens so that will be THE best money method if they have that in classic when ZG launches. Also if you have a mage rather than a hunter you can log on and give your priest friend free food and water so they don’t have to waste money on consumables. You can also get on earlier move your warrior from one city you logged out in to a closer city for your next quest and then when your friend logs on you can save them valuable in game time by being in the previous city with your mage and teleport them to next city. Just my thoughts
---
Can you not create a 3rd character as it says you have one of each opposing faction?
---
18 songs, gonna have to pump those numbers up.
---
Warlocks can effectively solo Princess in Maraudon for decent cash. 
---
They can Enslave elite demons in Blasted Lands &amp; Winterspring in order to farm Eye of Shadow
---
And as for farming in general, they can use Demonic Sacrifice on their voidwalker to give themselves absurdly high health regeneration, meaning nearly no down time in between killing mobs.
---
&gt;at a time like this.
---
??? Misinformation is basically a cornerstone of this subreddit. Every thread you go in there's someone making false claims about an aspect of how vanilla was, and it's been like that since the start.
---
It's been 13 years since vanilla, it's no surprise many people's memories of it are far from perfect. Then you add in people who have only experienced private servers and those that never played vanilla. Add in people like OP who have a massive distrust for Blizzard jumping to the worst conclusion about anything instantly without fully reading and it's really no surprise that posts like this happen.
---
same, my Goal is to get 40 by the end of my one week vacation. i hope i dont have to stress myself to reach it, i still wanna enjoy the ride since im playing with my gf.
---
APES will take it all, They are disciplined S+ Players.
---
The chair is only for when I don't feel like standing/walking. Not an upgrade priority. 
---
I really *should* replace the cat-tree/snowboard thou. But it works just fine and lets me avoid getting more stuff.
---
If you're someone that quit during Cata because you didn't like where the game was going then playing retail for a few days will only make you appreciate classic even more.
---
That's definitely true, I'm going to have a hard time deciding for sure.
---
It's great you're doing that for your guild. But check out some of the other free leveling guides. [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) has a fantastic set of guides, way better than Joana's and no paywall. Joana is overrated, he's piggybacking off his popularity from being the first speedrunner back in the day, but nowadays his guides are average at best.
---
You could always try feral druid, it's not that bad. But hunter is a solid choice too
---
yep. played tauren shaman in 2004 launch and can't wait to do it again, although isn't mulgore different than how it was in 2004? i distinctly remember the level 1 zone being different when i played in open beta/retail launch. the first mobs you could kill were those lvl 1 cat type mobs outside of camp. like i know for a fact it was different but i can't seem to find any screenshots or videos of it
---
I made a list like this for every class and spec. Plus alternatives that are easier to get.

No :) I'm gonna have so much fun in 5 sleeps from now
---
Can we please delete this post so people don't somehow figure out how to do this and cause mass hysteria right before launch. Lol. But I'm kinda serious.
---
Exactly right, I paid the flat fee when vanilla was out, and I would even pay another flat fee, but not a subscription.
---
Nothing like waking up at 2am to server room a/c alarms, power outage, or drive failures and having to haul ass into the office. The migration to cloud didn't come soon enough.

No, I was definitely talking to you. But I'm going to leave that in the past tense since all you can do is belittle people.
---
So I can MC you off
---
Wait so you're commenting on this with literally no understanding of the context or what you're talking about? Beautiful. "(I don't know what this race was, but I assume it was multiple teams.)" None of your examples are relevant because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Now I get why your first dumb comment was LUL NASCAR MURICA YEEE. Now lets talk about why your second comment is stupid and completely wrong in this context (again, because you're talking out of your ass): in DOTA and in football (MURICA YEE) there is 1 winner and 1 loser, so yes you can surrender when one team is ahead because you know who will win. This race had a bunch of competitors and MULTIPLE winning spots. Here's something I bet you've never imagined because you've never gotten off your ass for 1 second and gone outside to run in a race: do you think every single marathon racer quits the instant the first person hits the finish line? No, people keep running because there's other spots you can win. Some people even keep running for the pride of finishing the race. So please, next time when you feel like running your mouth and arguing about shit you don't understand, please shut the fuck up and sit down and keep NASCAR out of it.
---
Except that's for regular mounts and I can't find anything relating to AV mounts.
---
As a matter of fact I found [this page](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.1) where they just mention that it's "unsure if the mount price will drop", but not mentioning the price.
---
I also found [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Stormpike_Battle_Charger) where the price is listed as 50 Alterac Valley Mark of Honor, introduced in patch 1.8, so well before 1.12. It was later removed in patch 3.3.3.
---
This is how Classic should be experienced.
---
Their logic is actually pretty solid. Why make mass amounts of servers when all the evidence shows the majority of people wont last a month.
---
Also OP: "Why are all the guilds on this server not accepting my guild applications?"
---
Wrong call
---
That's so evil... I like it!
---
Then unsubscribe after you are done with it.
---
Best thing you can do is team up someone to farm. Warriors arent the best to solo farm either and love having pocket healers. 
---
I occasionally saw such teams offering carries through dungeons to levelers. Levelers got quests done. Warrior and healer got all loot except boss loot.
---
Low pop in 6 months hf
---
Yes, that would be bannable. From Blizzard's end, using a physical device to tap your keyboard would be indistinguishable from using software to do the same thing.
---
Sure, and I can trim your armor while we're at it too!
---
I think the point he's trying to make is not that they can't handle more, but rather that they intentionally *won't* handle more.  The only reason they're doing the layering thing at the beginning is to avoid servers being ghost towns after a few weeks if enough people quit once the nostalgia wears off.  After layering is gone, I think the plan is to cap servers as they were in vanilla regardless of whether or not they *can* handle more people.
---
Thats why we play PvE servers, to not have mouthbreathers like you ruin our day :P
---
Both were 1.5 speed which made for terrible rogue weapons. I’ve read the right claw had warrior potential due to the weapon proc and late gear scaling.
---
Alll my chars are girls on retail, they'll all be girls in classic. Why? I'm a hairy dude irl that likes to explore the feminine side of things in a fantasy world

That’s awesome! Yeah worst comes to worst we just go back to questing.

It’s been so many years so I’m not sure if I’m remembering correctly, but our guild in vanilla were able to down loatheb before BC just because of the way they changed vampiric embrace to give people mana? So you may be right
---
Anything automated is a bannable offence. Wether it be software, a programable keyboard or some kind of Macgyver rigged fan and rubber band.
---
This thread is like a huge testament against it.
---
Much like everyone else is saying. It's not really a big deal. Most of my characters are female just because I enjoy their models better or just like the thought of my Mage being a woman. However I have a few male characters such as a Dwarf Priest just because I don't care much for the female models.
---
Either way, play whatever strikes your fancy. If someone gives you shit for it then they're probably not the type of person you want to be hanging with anyways :)
---
I would prefer the machine solution.
---
Probably a makro will be detected somewhen.
---
Don’t have to but it’s possible and you should keep that in mind.
---
You ever see that episode of the Simpson's where homer works from home and he just leaves the bird to tap on his keyboard? Google it: homer keyboard bird
---
Very untrue statement. It might be considered bad in retail, but not in classic.
---
Get into groups on follow for sleeping while leveling
---
Not everybody was 13 in 2004 but even 13 years olds should be able to google "buy wow gold".
---
One major difference from OSRS to WoW is that almost all gear except crafted items are Bound On Pickup, so they’re locked to your character from the moment it’s dropped, and cannot be traded. Some items, notable crafted gear is Bound On Equip, which is exactly what it sounds like. So unlike in OSRS and RS3, each BIS item that drops isn’t added to the economy.
---
In some ways it’s very Ironman.
---
Once in the character select screen yoh will dc 30 minutes after without logging on a toon pressing buttons going into character creation will not change the timer i have tested this multiple times log in like 25 minutes before they let you log in is your best chance at dodging queue
---
in TOC on my shaman when the floor breaks through to Anub'Arak I would try and cast water walking on as many people as I could during the fall so that they would take fall damage and die on the water.
---
Lol, totally untrue. Keep that min/max jargon out of here. Deathbringer kicks ass for all warriors.
---
Mulgore seems to be a filter. Back in the day you very rarely had an asshole play a tauren since the starting zone is super spread out, takes ages and you have some really annoying mobs with higher levels and stuns sprinkled around. Most people hated it.
---
As a result nearly every tauren player (except maybe druids since they were mandatory to be a Horde druid) would be an absolute bro with the patience of a turtle.
---
The neutral auction house defeats that in a hurry.
---
Let yourself smoke on the weekends at least.
---
I'm surprised it wasn't full day 1
---
You come off as a major asshole.
---
&gt;  do you honestly think modern servers can't hold more than 3000 people without layering?
---
Obviously they can from a technology standpoint. But why would they from a design/gameplay/authenticity standpoint?
---
Little Wonder :)
---
Sure they aren't paid only?
---
How does 3,083, on YT (free) sound?
---
He must be a troll. Shaman named fear wtf what a joke
---
No. Save this hype and use it for the actual launch.
---
I played the stress test for maybe four hours the other Sunday, messing around on a toon that was a faction and class I dont plan on playing. I had the biggest fucking smile on my face, and I only hope others can experience that on launch.
---
Pretty
---
I’ll be honest I get their point and it creates a lot of issues for them. I think it’s a little short sited to say it’s completely unwarranted. There are a lot of issues it would cause for blizzard with realistically very little benefit to the community. I get that it may not be popular opinion but I think this change is logical.
---
Saw something like that happening before; Had my buddy PST the guy getting rekt to let him know that when he sees me open up on the guy don't get involved. Made me happy seeing the "BUR" chat bubble over the guy's head.
---
Not if my NE friend does it first
---
Lucifron would be awesome! That's the first announced German EU-PvP server. Also the one I'll be playing on!
---
Nobody above the age of 11 is going to care what the gender or name of your character is. It's an MMORPG, not a god damn dating app lmao.
---
Yep.  Splitting the community with expansions that inevitably introduce garbage shit and ruins the magic of vanilla NO THANKS.  
---
Classic+ that simply enhances the possibilities of the end game?  YES PLEASE
---
Skeletons are a big deal on pvp servers. They can tell you that a gank squad was in the area and you can tell the fraction besides on the races of the dead corpses. It also looks epic when Black rock mountain is filled with one thousand corpses on raid nights.
---
For you pve server players, no it doesn’t matter.
---
Remmiz, why are there skeletons on the roof?!
---
I tried it and I just can't, both on new characters and my max level character there's nothing to do. Leveling is just button mashing and the end game content is just rep grinding.
---
"Hey. Smoke up Johnny!"
---
Find a new guild :P

Glad you like it, enjoy and feel free to share some suggestions. That playlist should grow
---
The 385 from my post wasn't the added damage, it was the average damage roll of Sulfuras with WF bonus AP.
---
Glance isn't irrelevant. RB swings will either glance or not. WF swings will glance, but the occasional bonus swings will each individually roll for glance. 5 rolls per 5 swings vs 7 rolls per 5 swings. It matters.
---
With infinite numbers, I'll agree that WF is better. However, for most of the game the difference will be negligible.
---
AKA people with jobs
---
Ye I subscribed to him on twitch for a few months now as a sort of thank you. What an ass.

It's one of the only zones where you can aim at a quest objective and auto run to go to the bathroom or something

---
13 year olds today? Undoubtedly.
---
13 year olds 15 years ago?  You overestimate the Google-fu.
---
Yeah you could put "buy wow gold" into a generic search engine (since Google isn't popular yet)…. But there would be no online protection, so unless you have some idea of what you're doing it's just as much of a risk than using corpse sites.
---
Dwarves man. Fuckin' dwarves.
---
I know if I were blizzard I'd be more worried about server stress of all the corpses keeping people from playing rather than appeasing the small minority that complains about the lack of skeletons who will likely stay subbed anyways.  
---
This seems like a pretty silly gripe when there are very good reasons for the bodies to not linger even besides the possible realm stress.
---
That can't be true
---
I remember getting chased by 2 lvl 60s while levling in searing gorge. I ran and ran and they seemed to always be slightly out of reach. I headed towards the fp thinking I'm a few seconds from safety. Greeting me is an entire mc/bwl alliance raid who have killed the flight Master and are now dancing. We look at each other a few seconds before they absolutely annihilate me. Didn't ruin my day, and a semi good story all these years later. Putting some effort into ganking is fun
---
You ever accidentally start the treadmill while sitting on the chair? I bet you have :)

His guides where not the great compared to youtube ones. There are several that are for levels 1-60 and literally show every batch of quests on video, with all shortcuts, mobs locations, ext. They even add special editions on to them for specific classes information and tips. 
---
He is a guy who was huge in Vanilla for his dedication... but is easily eclipsed by modern content creators. He is stuck in the past. He has a 2006 looking website, with a 2006 level of detail guide. With a 2006 attitude towards playing games. 
---
By that I mean... he doesn't even hotkey all of his abilities. A good many of them he actually still mouse clicks. Fine for an average player I guess... but not something you typically see any top tier player who streams do.
---
pulling stitches over to westfall always a welcome

Shout out to the fellow scapers joining us in classic. Grinding is our forte and we love doing it.

If you talk about absolute ceiling then NA/EU are above aus. The fact that aus has never won (or even come close to winning) a single blizzcon is indicative of that fact.

Retail wont be installed.

The verdant grasslands of Mulgore is absolutely my favorite starting zone, and one of my favorite zones in general. But, this time I'm heading back to Elywnn. I wish the Tauren all the best, free range always tastes better anyways.
---
The arrow is annoying anyway
---
charging for addons is actually TOS.
---
Unless the saved variables format is completely unchanged between the addon’s retail and classic version, then no, this won’t work. If the author didn’t remove or change any of the variable names when porting to classic, it will work.
---
I feel like the ideal scenario would be to release TBC, WotLK, etc. as their own servers. As in, there will be Classic servers that never have the level-cap increased. You can always go back to Vanilla. But they’ll release TBC servers, and maybe we can import our Classic toons over to begin a full TBC experience. And those TBC servers will be independent of Classic and modern, so on and so forth.
---
Pretty sure it was based on trust rank and not race.
---
Biggest limiter will be holding aggro while you are getting healed. Mitigation doesn't help with that. If you sacrifice too much threat for mitigation then you will just find yourself chasing mobs around while they are banging on your shaman friend.

What ? Seriously ?

10 days played is disgustingly slow for anyone with even a tiny bit of a clue, which people taking weeks off work to no life the game should have.

6 days played is a very easily achievable rational number.

I changed mine to a +1. I think the reason it got downvoted is because it was a dismissal without any insight added to further the discussion, makes it feel like you just tear things down and don't build anything up. A LOT of posters do that and it makes others feel like all the burden of proof and work is on them, my post took a good 15 mins or so of looking stuff up, typing, trying to make it barely legible. I mostly make those posts after work because it's relaxing and I like the numbers.
---
Take my previous post that had no math but had some minor points about my argument.
---
&gt; uh....what? **no non-meme caster dps uses downrank spells**, and that **MP5  would result in less damage** than if a mage or lock wore it and went oom 2  spells earlier with 2% crit or the bonus spell power. **Sometimes going  oom but dealing more damage is better.**
---
I took countless lives with alterac valley snowballs during the winter events. Just stealth on the alliance base bridge and wait.
---
cause that's more code and testing for something that doesn't matter.
---
No, this isn't a pserver
---
Pretty sure it's not an add on, even if it Was there are workarounds like those zygor use
---
This is the dumbest excuse especially when it's a game with bad graphics , now a days sure asses are realistic back then why make up a dumb excuse you wanna play it then play it who cares
---
Simple take micro pauses. Loading screen jumping Jack's. Dead handstand push ups. Queue squats. Bathroom break chins etc etc
---
This is my plan for classic wow, I will not be in best shape after this but at least I keep some of my physic.
---
Yup. Was subbing on twitch and was planning on keeping my sub active during my leveling process at least.
---
Well at least they could walk over water
---
Wasn't this also the chain lighting icon for that mounted orc hero in WC3?

Mine has been used as a door stopper to my gaming room for so many years... I don’t even know when the last time I opened it was. Hope all that shit is still in there!
---
I’d investigate this further personally. There was a reddit post from someone else a few days ago that had a nearly identical issue as you.
---
It's not a terrible flight though really from TB to Org. Could be a lot worse.
---
You trust the design team to come up with something better?  
---
Honestly classic+ sounds good if done well but it's a huge gamble
---
Skeram server clock is eastern. Blaumeux is pacific. For some reason the eastern time zone servers have been filling up a bit quicker than the pacific ones.
---
I disagree with some point of the talent. Why improved soul drain ? It has to last hit. Not the pet, not any of the dot, not an ally, the drain soul. Also, i highly recommand to have the 0.5s summon, especially in pvp. Emergency sacrifice all the way for double shield
---
Otherwise it's great
---
simple? do you even dev? This is wasted time.
---
I'm rolling for the first time on classic. I'm going to miss Ironforge, but hopefully Undercity will do me well. I know I'm going to get lost as fuck though. Ironforge was super simple as far as vanilla goes.
---
Ha! You're absolutely clueless.
---
But why are you focusing on your characters pixel ass either way
---
&gt;They have made no indication that concurrent population caps in classic will be larger than they were in vanilla after layering is removed. And doing so would be in direct opposition to their primary goal of authenticity.
---
That's true, blizzard not changing the AQ material requirements will ironically make it less authentic. Unless your point is they're not really interested in preserving the experience, but the actual 1:1 state of vanilla. In that case, there's already plenty of differences between the old client and the new.
---
I guess we can't say 100%. But I had this comment in mind when I made my previous post.
---
&gt;Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.
---
They should clarify how their server pop works in conjunction with layering. I'd assume a medium server today wouldn't take much advantage of layering tech except on maybe launch day--yet it has a far bigger share of characters than a medium realm in 2006.
---
Used to go into AV during Christmas and summon people. Most would accept. Then me and my friends threw snowballs on them to knock them into the exit portal in the cave and give them deserter.
---
Sorry for the inconvenience but Aubderine's Discord last valid link is [https://discord.gg/tGX8EeK](https://discord.gg/tGX8EeK). Thanks for the update.
---
People just talk more about the EST servers. There's no reason to avoid Blowmew, it will be high pop by launch. 
---
If you're going pacific and aren't following anyone in particular I'd go there.
---
It's terrible. My guild voted 4-2 Stalagg over Whitemane, but literally EVERY player I know, including my OG vanilla guild, with whom I progressed into Naxx, is going Whitemane.
---
I'm GM of the guild and I'm super tempted to just piss everyone off and say fuck you Whitemane it is

Stop using lowkey. This isn't preschool. Thanks

Un-boooo and un-trash. :)
---
Usually, a good rule of thumb is looking at the final boss loot, and taking the level requirement as a guideline. 
---
However, dungeons on the beta seemed less demanding than what many people were used to. So you can probably shave 2-3 levels off without getting into trouble. It'll be slower of course.
---
He said for months and months that it was going to cost $5 once classic was live :)
---
shilling for censorship and political correctness.
---
Have my downvote, sir.
---
says the guy not understanding that their reasons is based on the pc culture? Mmmkay
---
copyright@blizzard.com may be interested in this since he uses many images from the game and now he's charging a fee to access it.
---
It just doesn't keep track between sessions and I cbf to have to click through 48 pages of steps every time I want to play.
---
To be truthful I haven’t leveled 1-60 in over a decade so I’m going off what I’ve read here and a few other forums. If you think 6 days is good timing, I trust your judgement.
---
Extremely low because it would require more then the 4 devs we get.
---
And he should
---
My day 1 goal will be getting to level 10, and getting from Darnassus to Stormwind. That shouldn't be that hard right?
---
Yeah I am pretty sure that the main changes they are making to Classic have to do with server stabilization and creating a situation where they don't have a need for a ton of customer service reps. So, even though i always thought seeing all of those skeletons was pretty awesome ill take a stable server over that any day.
---
Please keep us updated the closer we get to launch. Haven't started a subscription yet but the PVP servers doesn't look good to be honest. Hoping to avoid all streamers and high queues.
---
All of you saying it would be easy just to code and test some new shit on how to prevent a stupid issue are crazy and have obviously never worked in a dev environment in your entire life. This is a non issue and a waste of time. You get one skeleton, this is not a deal.
---
I see a lot of people going rogue/ warrior. Its just my opinion, but i feel like warrior will be similar to how Hunter was in vanilla as far as popularity goes.
---
If you use a dippy bird it is literally untraceable, CIA calls it "ghost tapping".
---
do you have a link ?
---
Yeah, no need to switch anything since it's all under the same subscription. I'll be logging on to retail periodically to do things I usually do. But I have a feeling classic will take over the majority of my time.
---
He kept saying on stream the guide would be free and his app would be paid. People including myself donated or subscribed based on that information. To now charge for the guide is scummy.
---
ive trained my 5yr old nephews from birth for this day. loaded up full of gear with walkie-talkies, frozen pizzas and redbulls. grab the handset. \*click\* bring the food \*click\*. 1 oreo per delivery.
---
Sad all my friends are going alliance. I want a shaman this time around as an alt. :(
---
Or you can use one of many other guides to level, which are available for free. Like Judgement or Sage.
---
Not to mention, a subscription to access the guide? I'd somewhat understand him asking a 5$ one-time payment for the guide. It is a lot of work after all. But a subscription fee for soemthing, that's only relevant when you level a character? That's bonkers.
---
Man y'all are on edge lately :p
---
Don't blame you though, there's a lot of fighting and negativity here...
---
That's exactly it. In later expansion when I was going for leveling server firsts, once you get out of the starting zone it drops sharply to like 5% of players in the zone. Then you beat them and suddenly you're at least a quest hub ahead of everyone but 1 or 2 others. You generally leave the opposite faction alone since pvp slows your xp/h, but you still take the occasional gank while they aggro'd a pack. 
---
The strangest feeling is literally being the only person in a zone, and being there for the first time and seeing all the special things up. Rare mobs will be there, chests, clickable items, herbs and ore.
---

---
&gt;  People abusing that was so incredibly rare and the skeletons are frankly an integral part of classic.
---
I've seen the "skeletons writing a message" exactly no times during all of Vanilla, BC and WotLK. I saw corpses forming an URL *once*.
---
But we've already seen that Blizzard is willing to compromise "Classic" if it suits them, so this ain't exactly a surprise.
---
If you want versatility outside of healing druid is worth consideration. They may not heal as well as pallys or priests but skilled bears can tank, having stealth is fun for pvp
---
It's like Dark Souls hints from players.

Maybe it just shows the drop down menu if u installed BFA. weird.

This needs to be addressed. There is absolutely no excuse for this being removed entirely. Make corpses have a few feet random placement to avoid gold sellers. Or make it so skeletons collecting in a tiny area thin out/or spread out. Theres a bunch of options.
---
People will bitch about anything.
---
East coast servers are more popular that west coast servers. As a west coast player I can join a raid group that starts at 8 and it’s 6 for me, but on a west coast server a raid that starts at 8 is 11pm for east coast. 
---
Any one can play on east coast server, because of TiMeZoNeS
---
I saw and upvoted , also didn't know was advertised as free then put behind pay wall
---
After layering is gone, I think the plan is to cap servers as they were in vanilla regardless of whether or not they can handle more people.
---
Shouldn't blizzard use vanilla-era server size indications, then?
---
If you make a character on a medium server today, and they're using layer-tech as part of their server size estimation then a player making a character on that server would have the false information of the server actually being medium size. Since a medium realm in 2019 is the same size as a medium realm in 2006, as per the blizzard comment below.
---
When blizzard would remove layering, people on medium servers would essentially be at vanilla cap, people above would be screwed.
---
Hah I already put my top 3 is each slot items on a whiteboard, along with attunement to work on, rep grinds, rare patterns to farm etc.  My 16 year old saw it and labeled it "Dad's Nerd Board" and decorated the corners with flowers and stuff.  Little smartass, I dunno where she gets it.
---
Yeah, the guy never claimed it's his own. He should give credit. And Joana should've had a paywall from the start, lol.
---
You obviously don't understand classic at all, you think Molten core is difficult. That is just wrong. You probably think Vanilla raids are harder than modern WoW raids.
---
Classic is released in a few days, it’s very similar to Vanilla, yet people freak out over tiny changes...People thinking the change in skeleton despawn will lead to LFR and class balancing...stop.
---
I remember talking to a DAOC player about how excited I was for WoW and he basically called me casual trash.
---
But we've gone from "Classic will never be re-released" to Classic coming out and Camelot Unchained just keeps getting pushed back.  So 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
He specifically advertised it as free
---
Standby for laughing man with missing teeth meme.
---
All Credit goes to [Joana](https://www.joanasworld.com/).
---
hopefully the mod doesn't remove this.
---
Idk how people feel about this or not but heroic 5 man content before everyone got super geared and trivialized it was probably some of my favorite times in wow. Some of those where seriously challenging and I remember how much me and my friends struggled and strategized with heroic black morass and one of those tempest keep ones specifically.

Why dont you allow a 'last name' ? If a merge is needed, there will be no issues regarding unique names..
---
I just straight out asked for the week off to play a videogame. He told me I'm a nerd and gave me the time off lol.
---
This! Call in sick the next week. Tell them you have back problems and the doctor told you to rest. Standing up and sitting down hurts a lot. No one can control if its true or not ;)
---
A funny thing about this staff is that the aura doesn't stack with the moonkin 3% crit aura. So if you have a moonkin in your raid (for whatever reason), it's actually better to use wraith blade + sapph OH in a moonkin group than wielding Atiesh. For locks and mages at least.
---
you'll think layering is bad when it yanks you out of your layer when you are resting up and dumps you in a pack which then kill you.
---
Jeez, you are a bit too sensitive aren't you? Your insecurities shine through.
---
Leave him behind, the rest of you can be on discord playing while he listens in his queue. He'll come round real quick.
---
Also every launch server will end up with healthy populations, don't understand the hype around Herod.
---
God damn, this is even better. Joana did Kargoz a big favor.
---
You're making the assumption reshade looks good. I'm yet to see reshade make any game whatso ever look better
---
I can't even do one hand stand push-up. geez
---
&gt; do you honestly think modern servers can't hold more than 3000 people without layering?
---
this was never about "can"
---
It's about "is it a good idea?"
---
Horde or Alli?
---
You sir, are an asshole! This is brillant!
---
Lucky you
---
Good luck to all and to all a fair fight. Unless you still my spot in logon queue 😂
---
Plus they said it’ll be a single skeleton until you die a second time. So if a 10v10 battle takes place there’s still gonna be 10 skeletons on the losing side until those 10 players die a second time elsewhere.
---
It’s really just going to stop you from seeing 100 skeletons from 1 poor soul kept getting ganked
---
I've watched every single one of his videos on picking races and classes and professions. I still have absolutely no idea which way I want to go.
---
Hey how about don't be an asshole
---
It is a slippery slope, and soon we'll have "LFG, because getting camped at dungeon entrances doesn't contribute to meaningful gameplay"
---
&gt; RB swings will either glance or not. WF swings will glance, but the occasional bonus swings will each individually roll for glance.
---
A RB swing is a regular attack, not a special. It has the same chance to glance as the extra wf proc swings, or parry, or miss, or dodge, block, critc etc.
---
If you ran the numbers, say from level 30 onwards with typical leveling weapon, WF still comes out ahead of RB by ~1.5x to 2x, precisely because it is a % chance to proc 2 atks that scale on your characters base stats, str stat and melee weapon dmg. 
---
With higher base dmg, WF scales higher.
---
Anyway it was good discussing this with you. :)
---
No.
---
That's a good point.  I'm not sure why they're representing server pop in that way, but it's probably a measured compromise.
---
I mean 10 days is a reasonable time if you’re a normal guy just leveling and doing whatever.
---
Under 4 days will be all the mega hardcores - the world first soloers and dungeon grinders will easily get 3 days X hours at 60.
---
4-5 days is still extremely fast and tough - but 6 days is super easy and doable *IF* you’re taking time off to go hard, because maintaining a lead over most players is key. You don’t want to get stuck in the mess with tons of players starting pvp wars and ganking and stealing quest mobs etc etc
---
Can't say that I have. I've had some other dumb moments on it though.
---
you know where to find something like this for warrior?:)
---
TBC's biggest problems, from my perspective as the GM of a hardcore raiding guild:  
---
\- Massive amount of very hard trash in SSC and TK on short respawn timers.  
---
1.5 hour trash clear in front of Morogrim on a 2 hour timer (or even 45 minutes, as initially) is just soul-destroying. Weirdly, trash in BT was easier than in SSC/TK.  
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would recommend removing respawns completely, remove some trash packs in SSC and make trash in BT a bit harder perhaps.
---
\- Warlock was the only viable AoE class and if you didn't have enough warlocks, several progression encounters were just impossible to do.  
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would recommend increasing the DPS on Blizzard or decreasing Arcane Explosion's mana cost to make mage a viable AoE class. Alternatively, hunters could be given viable AoE abilities (or ret paladins? ;)). 
---
\- long raid-attunement quests made it very difficult to organize raids for BT and MH as often various players were stuck on different parts of their attunement quests and required different bosses in TK and/or SSC  
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove of shorten raid attunements, or make the doable by the individual player (outside of raids)
---
Without these issues, TBC would have been the best WoW expansion. I always felt that TBC was a huge missed opportunity and I never really forgave Blizzard for putting me through so much BS during that expansion.  
---
If Blizzard was going to redo TBC, they consider might add a few WOTLK-style hardmodes which are built into the encounters.
---
Today he’d lose his job if you played it right xd
---
Sigh...see you there I guess.
---
Thank you. I did too lol.
---
So you basically can't read. Congrats.
---
They could at least allow multiple skeletons in instances.
---
Or, only not allow them in major cities and starting zones.
---
Remember when their food was good
---
This!!
---
Tell your boss you've caught a bad case of Corrupted Blood...
---
&gt;between 2-3 weeks 
---
Doing the math:
---
1 week = 7\*24 = 168h
---
7\*6h sleep = 42h
---
50h work
---
Lunch break? 5\*30m = 2.5h?
---
1h commute /day, maybe?5\*1h = 5h?
---
toilet breaks 7\*30m = 3.5h
---
shower brush your teeth, do laundry, bring trash out, do dishes ... 7\*1h = 7h
---
\---
---
42+50+2.5+5+3.5+7 = 58h/week
---
2\*58h = 116 = 4.8days /played
---
3\*58h = 174 = 7.25 days /played
---
Lets all hold a silent minute for the deceased neck
---
&gt; Shouldn't blizzard use vanilla-era server size indications, then?
---
They are... They server size indications are showing relative populations... it doesn't tell you anything about total population. Thus a medium population is just to indicate that it is lower than the high and full population servers. This is why blizzard clarified that even though a server is "medium" it is still bigger than your traditional vanilla server. 
---
&gt; When blizzard would remove layering, people on medium servers would essentially be at vanilla cap, people above would be screwed.
---
This could very well happen... people even asked about this specifically on the AMA:
---
&gt; Q: What are plans for phase 2 if some realms are horrifically overpopulated at 50K+ players? Will layering stay?
---
A: We’re absolutely committed to reaching one layer per realm by Phase 2. This is why we need to have upper bounds on the number of players connected to the realm at one time, and queue players past that point. That, of course, is why we’re willing to open new servers if necessary, and we’ve even started doing that in response to the incredibly positive reception we’ve had during the name reservation period!
---
I can kind of get why people want to be on the fullest server, since that basically ensures long-term population.
---
What I don't understand is why people think Herod will be the best choice right now.   
---
The servers that are being spun up right now will not be loaded with retail players reserving their names to spite people (they already did that on the OG 3), nor will they will be the new tourists after all the techie articles are waxing poetic and/or flaming Blizz. The people filling up the new realms right now are people who are purposefully subbed early in order to player on Launch Day. 
---
The new servers (before Launch Day) are vey likely to be Full, but not likely to be disgustingly full, so they will probably have reasonable queues. Herod/Whitemane/etc will be awful for months because of people afflicted by FOMO.
---
I switched my schedule to get home 1 hour before launch day! Also my job starts at 5:30 AM and I’m home at 2:00 pm every day so I take a 60-90 minute nap after work and I’m pretty much good to be awake till 12-1 my body for the last 4 years has been very accustomed to this sleep schedule so I’ll have loads of time to play if I’m not busy doing other things
---
its harder to win when you shoot yourself in the foot you know...
---
Agreed. I remember crying over losing stuff on Runescape. On wow my only tears have ever been of joy.
---
Really great animations, too. Almost as good as female undead.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctd12q/wont_be_able_to_play_are_there_any_ne_druids/). 
---
It wasn’t the reason given, but it’s a reason they factored in I’m sure. 
---
Either way, it’s a pretty minor change especially considering everyone still gets a skeleton until they die a second time so big battle scenes will still look awesome.
---
Well we have layering but idk I’ll go for skinning and leatherworking so I’ll have no problems
---
As someone who has played BFA I would say yes. It will just reinforce the idea that you want to play Classic. If not, maybe classic isn't for you anymore and at least you'd know ahead of time. Then again, there are people who like both
---
You misunderstood. Method is NOT competing for world first as a guild. They are streaming several different players and guilds who plan world first 60, rag and ony, and some method members are playing in those guilds. Method themself are not competing together, though.
---
GMs cannot interact with people the way they did back in Vanilla. It was raising too many issues with GMs abusing their powers, creating unfair and way to personal scenarios, and breaking ingame immersion. In serious cases, several GMs have actually been fired over this. And I totally agree myself. The minute you start waving your GM wand, someone will keep asking for more, post some video on social networks, or even complain / compare other GMs about differential treatment and then judge GM behavior / professionalism on stuff that was not supposed to happen in the first place.
---
It was a subtle but intergal part of the game. Now if a skeleton despawns that gives me an indicator that the person just spawned and died again. It changes the dynamic of pvp which you obviously never have done in vanilla wow from your response.

Death stranding
---
Don’t hold your breath. I bet you have to relog
---
I fell down some stairs.
---
Exactly, I’m more than ok with this happening if I can just do a corpse run and resurrect, but if I have to wait for a GM to unfuck the situation then my (play session for the) day is ruined.
---
Game already is going to have a bunch of changes.
---
No changes died. There is a reason they are calling it classic and not vanilla. Its not identical.
---
Vanilla was still rewarding tho. Retail feels like a mobile game.
---
I await your superior questions with baited breath.
---
I actually never even saw those gold website corpses until WotLK or so.
---
People don't get that it all these small details that accumulate to create the vanilla experience. If Blizzard takes skeletons away, adds layering, etc we start losing the Vanilla experience.
---
Lol? New pservers have accurate xp values and people easily beat joana's hunter time on shit like rogue and paladin and every serious speedleveler on every class out-paced his original vanilla time by a LOT in the classic beta. Joana isn't even close to 'fastest WoW leveler in the world' any more and if you had watched his 1-60 vanilla vod and compared it to newer, better players you'd see how far behind his original time was. I've beaten his 1-60 on a hunter and I'm not even good or was trying to do so.
---
Also, disc/holy with tap and an up to date wand is pretty fast. Faster on a fresh server than rogue, warrior, paladin.
---
"If it is not 10000 push-ups then it is 100 laps around the village."
---
What pisses me off with the ranking system is the rewards more than anything. For casters they are pretty much only worthwhile up to rank 10. Above that the gear doesn't noticeably improve and by that time you're probably in phase 3 where BWL gear beats the snot out of any ranking gear. Supposedly the spellblade will be added in phase 5 so even at rank 14 you can literally get better weapons in MC/DM. And once the spellblade is available you can get regalia or femur in AQ which are on par. 
---
Pretty fucking stupid tbh.
---
It's way cheaper considering you don't have to buy the game, only the sub. Also the same price 15 yrs ago with inflation
---
So where are the skeletons at? Blizzard can't ban hackers? They have no gms to clean this stuff up? They aren't Billionaires?
---
So if a game exploits somthing with hacks, just remove it from the game? Instead of you know... creating a solution.
---
This is so dumb. If they opend Stallag right away, the pop would be much more evenly distributed.
---
Blizzard really fucked up this launch.
---
ANd all this does not even account to the people who resubscribe when classic launches!!!!
---
009 sound system only.
---
I think if you just hold that button it will flag you as afk too, you need to be actually taping it
---
In ~120 days of /played and over a decade of WoW, I never saw a single BoE epic drop ...
---
blizz clarified that you're still leaving a skeleton, just 1 though. if stormwind gets decimated because someone dragged a boss through there it'll still be covered in corpses
---
They’ve already said that medium pop is above that of the busiest Vanilla servers, this isn’t anything hidden or new.
---
Tried. It's just way too difficult to wait between weekends and the Mondays suck. Life is so much better without it, but I love getting blazed.
---
Get bent virign nerd. You are autistic.
---
Had it on my Orc Hunter
---
Omg I will randomly start singing this and my poor mother STILL hates it. I sing it anyway because it makes me laugh. Still.
---
By acknowledging such a small demographic misusing terms/memes (like pepe), you are letting them win.
---
Ohh and I also forgot when AV drops mage is pretty much guaranteed to be able to race to the black lotus spawn locations first and herb them each round. Only when the gates open you blink to the spot you can mount and then you have a 5 second lead on the rest of the classes. I have leveled on Classic WoW, and two private servers I would highly recommend mage over hunter but if you chose hunter they are a close second. There is just so much more a mage can do compared to a hunter imo especially when you take in to account the tandem help of free food and portals. Also huge will be every time the priest logs in you will give them the free food and water AND give them a buff of intellect to increase their mana pool for 30 minutes of grinding.
---
Your issue is with Imgur and not OP.
---
IMHO the patrons should be grandfathered in (I am not a patron btw.). But I don't really see the problem with people not having contributed until now paying to access the guide.
---
The same type of person who would give his account data to random stranger pretending to be Blizzard employee.
---
I prefer buying one instead of renting one because then you invest in yourself, you know
---
That it's hot and very hyped. My swedish is a bit rusty..
---
Or just add a toggle to hide the skeletons.
---
Right, but what I'm saying is to go back to the druid trainer at TB you just gotta stop by TB first and then head down. So head to TB first for the flight path, then make your way to Valley of Trials (setting your hearth at Raven Hill or whatever it's called) and start questing there. Then just fly to TB to train at level 6 and hearth back. 
---
The initial walk is long, but still not nearly as bad as NEs going to Elwynn or Dun Morough.
---
If you had a question why didn't you ask it?
---
Ew
---
Hitler was at least right about the lousy server names :P
---
Hi, /u/SaltySalt69

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctd39c/what_server_should_i_aim_for_if_i_want_a_server/). 
---
kinda same, also kinda excited to play on a high pop server
---
you said you “doubted” it was to give players a better starting zone experience. shut the fuck up.
---
You die, your skeleton will be placed within a 30 yd radius randomly. Problem fucking solved you fucking PC shitty snowflakes.
---
Niece
---
Golemagg!
---
Classic WoW isn't the same with a couple of thousand corpses making ACSII art of a porn-scene.
---
Citation needed mate, that's a load of rubbish. It clearly says per player until they create another skeleton.
---
Horde rogue.  
---
Checks out.
---
I thought it was pretty good. More direct answers and less beating around the bush than typical.
---
A healer running out of mana is a good indication you need them!

You are such a child that you think it's funny to name a character asswipe.

By the way nice incel exclamation at the end, it truly seals in your overall terrible character.

ahh 7965, I see you're one of my people.

damn my guild was killing chromag for only the last 4 or 5 months of classic and we had at least 3 drop
---
Orc rogue on a pvp realm.
---
Sounds like a perfect start for a new advanture. Once playing you will notice roadblocks you need other people for. You will also notice everyone else needing other people. Forming groups for these thinks all go so naturally. Zero worry mate.

IRC to spy on the ally's u killed at Tyrs hand xD
---
I have payed vacation days, I don't need to make excuses.
---
There's obviously a spectrum of how casual friendly a game is. Just because classic wow was more casual than other mmo's does not mean that retail wow cant be more casual and therefore not appealing to fans of classic anymore. So I think you've reached the wrong conclusion.
---
Hey everyone this dude wants to roll a female toon!
---
See. Nobody cares.
---
Why didn't you ask any questions in the AMA? You clearly have much better questions to ask.
---
Yeah.  You told me that crit and spell power is definitely better than mp5, no question asked.
---
I questioned you and people didn't like that.
---
Try to be a maximum of 4 levels lower than the final boss and you will be fine.
---
Go fury at lvl 10 swap to arms at lvl 40. Get some prot points at 58. Dont go full prot either at 58. You need to do so much quests on your own. You need some dmg aswell. Go prot when you start doing raids.
---
Also for imp drain soul, it only counts if YOU kill it, so make sure to passive your pet near the end so it doesn't kill steal.
---
Neither is a lot of the status symbols of vanilla, grinding deserves a certain kind of respect too.
---
Got it for ally?
---
This is amazing!
---
Seriously, they never even answered my question about the best adult diapers
---
Damn, as a fan of most of these albums, this is awesome!!
---
So for 3 months a gm couldnt clean it up in 1 second? So they just ban it all together? Why not have the corpse be placed randomly in a large radius.... problem solved. Snowflakes and idiots running Blizz right now.
---
Around 7 hours to 20 is a good time for a hunter. For a Warrior, getting to 20 in  9-10 hours is considered pretty good. With zero experience in speed running the game, and the starting zones being clogged on day 1, you're probably looking at 15-16 hours at least. But even that will require that you sort of know some/most of the quests, being fairly good at not dying (it's very easy to die as a warrior) and that you only focus on leveling.
---
I recommend audiobooks, specifically the caverns and creatures series and perhaps some real litrpg stuff like "the land".

It looks nice but I really don't like leveling there, it feels a lot less... genuine than Durotar and Tirisfal Glades to me.
---
Like I have to force myself through it get a druid.
---
Spirit Ress.. Would only take 10 minutes out.
---
Retail servers are located in the same place
---
scram! Don't play on Skeram!
---
irl and ingame probably
---
I agree that there was too much already answered questions
---
Guys, you had the opportunity to talk about the whole experience not only the few days of launch !
---
Huh?
---
Rogues can have the first few, they need all the help they can get.
---
There are some tactics like that. If everyone uses the Barov Peasant Caller trinket on Huhuran's enrage they soak all the damage and makes the fight trivial.
---
I'll be speed leveling, but  trust me I can't reach lvl 20 in 6 hours. In 6 hours I'll be lvl 15.
---
I expect to be 29 after the first 24 hours.
---
This whole #n0cHaNgEs shit is old.They’re obviously going to have to change some things.Also it’s been stated days ago that medium pop servers have more than the most populated ones back then so you don’t worry about moving from full servers to medium ones.
---
Dual monitor for working. Sometimes I'll reposition a monitor to the center for netflixing or single screen gaming.
---
Undead warlock, can't say I'm worried..
---
Pure guesswork.
---
Would be nice if we can have a compilation of all the classes that have been posted so far and sticky it the first few weeks of launch.
---
Had a BfA friend I played Horde with who said he doesn't care about Classic. Now he asked where we play and denied playing with us because "I hate Horde". whelp
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=8AM2-BwT4Ts
---
They didnt refuse to answer it. It was answered a couple days ago.
---
Everyone knows female models have better animations.
---
Skeram is low key fire to be fair.
---
I had to read it like 15 times but I think I got it lol
---
Thanks dude.
---
What great questions did you ask?
---
Yea but "MUH IMMERSION"
---
the fuck?
---
People around here act like pvp realms are rp realms and not the shit flinging griefing cluster fucks they are
---
Laughing with, and laughing at are different things.
---
Unless you're not focusing on levelling, it shouldn't take 10 days played. Especially if you can devote 12hrs/day
---
Oh snap, I went to the AMA for citation and reread the response. You are absolutely right and I misread. One skeleton per character is exactly the way it should be.
---
Solution: when you log off to go to sleep, log back in again and wait in the queue while sleeping
---
You can't be sure and say nochanges in an AMA response, AND THEN DO A FUCKERY PUSSY BOI CHANGE
---
You are a good bro saving him from using such a stupid name!
---
If you don't mind me adding to this, make sure to check out  [https://soundcloud.com/rave\_on](https://soundcloud.com/rave_on). This guy has uploaded a wealth of livesets in any kind of trance from the early 90s to modern day.
---
His guide has been available for free for years. Of all the times I've checked in on his stream he's never pointed out it will be switched to paid only. That's deception.
---
It's his right to charge for his work of course, but it's extremely deceptive to make it look like he's making a free guide to help players for so long, then to suddenly put it behind a paywall 6 days before classic release. I feel terrible for all the people who donated and subbed to him thinking he was contributing his guides to the community for free, only to have this switch happen at the last minute.
---
Who has time to actually read when I have to make all of these conspiracy theories??
---
I mean he has every right to charge people for his work......^(but thanks)
---
While you are right on the AMA being great, I was missing the skellies in retail before this became a discussion here.
---
I'm checking this sub 10 times a day as the wait is, indeed, driving me stir crazy. I assume that for people that are less well adjusted with a less sunny outlook on live this would result in some acting out.
---
When’s this guy gonna realize he’s the dumb one here? He’s got no one on his side for his view-fishing ways
---
I haven't played anything since Wrath and it was the skill tree changes that really crushed me. All of my builds were really unique and once the skill trees shifted I couldn't play them anymore and felt like I lost my characters even though they were still there.
---
Skinning for easy money while leveling and either herb or mining.
---
 Save materials and drop skinning later.

Don’t stress about it, if I’m going to be staring at a characters ass for countless hours I’d prefer it be female..but that’s just me.

Apparently they wont be in cause people can write messages with them that breaks the ToS. According to the AMA anyway
---
Oh man I remember that
---
10 days?  No way.  Speed runs are like 3 days played.  The average player is gonna be more like 6 days played.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/user/rickyste/featured) appears to be his Youtube. You can try messaging him on there and asking.
---
Ok, that’s great, but I’m still not sure how this affects total server pop, unless you’re subscribing to the interpretation that they will set servers at a pop cap equal to the vanilla one come phase 2.
---
yup blizzard PR at its best
---
I mean... it was?
---
Ads.
---
I used to always roll male because my pre-pubecant self was like ”WELL IM A MAN, NOT SOME LITTLE GIRL. Female Chars are gay!” 
---
Then i realized sometime around Cata that most Females have better animations and the gear sits better on avrage.  Have all the classes capped and im pretty sure they are all either orc or belf female.  Besides the druid which is a troll. 
---
For vanilla however im going back to paladin - so alliance, and dwarf is BIS - but in going with the glorious beard male.
---
"Hey, you can take that Zammy wine and sell it for like 10k each!"
---
Then proceed to spamclick the door of the monastery closed until they died to the monks and you got all their items.
---
Good times.
---
Well I mean setting up a grp of for example 4 Mages + a Priest to steam roll to dungeons until you are level 60. It's kind of a new start I belive since I dont recall it beeing done back in Vanilla to such an extend.
---
I found it easy to.
---
The snowboard table is a nice touch.
---
I was playing hardcore in Vanilla (8 hours a day at least) and I took about 5 months, lol.
---
I wasted so much time, but it was awesome. So much unproductive PVPing in WSG at level 30 and 40. So much gold grinding to replace the rocket boots. So many hours spent dying over and over of some quest that was too high for my level.
---
An old friend needs my help finding his long missing wife.
---
They have made no indication that concurrent population caps in classic will be larger than they were in vanilla after layering is removed. And doing so would be in direct opposition to their primary goal of authenticity.
---
I'd be afraid of the cat on his tree during his crazy time 😮
---
There is, yes.
---
I was in SE Wyoming, and i miss it badly. Need to win the lotto and go back lol.
---
Put them back Blizzard.
---
This set up gets more ridiculous the more you look at it.
---
Think again, there were some pretty awesome stories on that show.
---
&gt;Tank: Stop!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Support: What's wrong? Why are we stopping?  
---
&gt;Tank:  
---
&gt;Tank: Do you see this?  
---
&gt;Support: There are lying thousands of skeletons on the ground. So what?  
---
&gt;Tank: I have a question to you. How do those skeletons spawn?  
---
&gt;Support: Well, they spawn when someone dies.. thousand skeletons.. thousand people died.. no enemies...  
---
&gt;Tank: Yep. We are surrounded. Take your battle potions as long as we have time! BE PREPARED TO FIGHT!
---
Such cruelty
---
Pretty sure that was the addon.
---
A bigger gamble IMO is making expansions that inevitably split the community and introduce horrible mechanics that make the game worse over time.  At least with classic+ we can make decisions from scratch.
---
Ok, hear me out.  You need a DDR dance pad, a cat, a laser pointer, and a ceiling fan.  Throw in some catnip for good measure and you’re all set!
---
I’m using classic to start drinking! It’s the only way I’ll be able to fight through STV!
---
Please upvote this ^  comment so people stop panicking over nothing.
---
I doubt he invented leveling lol
---
Bold man using something that doesnt expand for a poop sock. I appreciate the metaphor tho
---
Or just use Hakurais leveling guide.
---
/spit
---
This is true in the original game. But we are not talking about playing the original, it's a chance for people to go back and experience playing your favourite expansion again. So on your logic that you say is the only feasible option you would want anyone that fancys playing Wrath again but didnt played Classic or TBC revisit to start with a fresh toon and level up through both. Now I understand it's a great idea to be able to then port your toon over from one to the other, however your going to out off a lot of people who just want to play a bit of that one expansion again. This is after all about individuals experience of their favourite game. Down vote me all you like but I was just putting forward the idea of a button to get an instant character for that one expansion  to get people back in that action a lot like we get today in retail. Your not wanting this fine as it doesnt suit you but is not taking into consideration the potential needs for others that dont want to then spend a week or twos of in game hours constant grinding just so replay the experience of that one zone as for some that could take months.
---
I would like if release will be on Sunday because my wife and child are going to grandmother while I am still on work)
---
[The Ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5AkIfgioA4)
---
It's great because you're able to run in to other people you've been leveling around.  It's a huge part of how the server community develops, especially as people level alts.
---
I remember my first epic world drop was a ring or a trinket. It droped 2 (!!) days after tbc startet and I just hit lvl 57. Fuck I was so happy that I could sell this and afford my epic mount. needless to say nobody wanted it any more because of outland loot...
---
Wow! This is fantastic hahahah!
---
&gt;We want the Chinese audience because skeletons in video games offend them - Blizzard
---
$5 permanent access?
---
Yeah, I saw that. It isn't what I meant. Specifically, for instance. On Bloodhoof, a guy ninjaed the Rag Eye for Sulfuras, in someone's guild. I don't recall the guildname, but anyways. He was reported a severe amount of times. But, as it stood, he was capable of looting it, and thus it was basically the player's fault for trusting that guy.
---
That guy xferred off server. 
---
The question I'm being specific about is whether or not they're going to allow people who have done bad shit to escape the bad shit they've done. Because people DID that in classic, and it was detrimental to the game in a severe, and unintentional, way.
---
The reason they gave was for players spelling out messages. I can think of a few ways to handle this off the top of my head.  
---
1. The corpse spawns in a random location in a radius of x yards. Direction facing would be randomized as well.  
---
2. Or simple just don't allow one person to have that many corpses in one area. If any other corpses of that player are within x yards, do not spawn a persistent corpse.  
---
I'm sure I could come up with more if I gave it some thought. If the original had persistent corpse so should classic, I wouldn't mind the above tweaks to cover their concerns. #nochanges
---
Yes the pagina
---
I hope they reconsider their stance and make them persistent.
---
So I logg in many hours before to avoid q?
---
God, I remember being like 12 and getting lured for my full addy set and rune scimy. Pretty sure I bawled more than when my dog passed away a few years prior.
---
It is simple.
---
I got the Name "Gnomed" on the new Server yesterday, i guess i know what race im playing (:
---
Do you need everything spelled out for you too there? Jesus its a simple fucking shitty meme. Maybe infer a little from the photo and write it out on paper what you think it means.
---
I think you're correct, all buyable mounts listed [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=raptor) can not be used by taurens. In fact, only the Swift Razzashi Raptor is not limited by race. No raptors for tauren until ZG :(
---
"Why the fuck weren't you \[healing/dpsing\] noobs!"
---
God, I will hit that button so hard. omg
---
What guild?
---
Everyone will an opinion on the topic, but I’m in the same boat as you. It’s why I disregard all those leveling guides out there. I want to level organically and have fun, make mistakes, and love the game all over again
---
Isn’t it free on his website ?
---
During sleep? Almost assured you get banned eventually. During a short break (ie greater than an hour, less than three) then you probably could get away with it
---
feel free to gtfo then
---
I wish this had more upvotes
---
You think it’s shitty but other people look at you and say "holy moly"... that’s the real cool thing.
---
All my friends that I made back playing horde in vanilla are rolling alliance. It honestly killed the hype for me. Probably not gonna play now.. Unless I roll a rogue just to gank them haha
---
I don’t see the poop sock?
---
I've spent in the ballpark of around 120 million seconds on wow /played.
---
Glad to see Bethesda is rehauling the character creation.
---
Classic is definitely the better choice for the next few months at least. You’ll go from being a new player of a crappy mmo to a founding veteran of a “new” mmo.
---
I’ve been playing WoW since late BC and I’m convinced only the saddest, most pathetic, addicted losers play Retail right now (including myself until the level 15 stress test recently).
---
There is a wand from BRD that has a bit of +healing on it that was a more targetable alternative
---
He has a Patreon on top of his Twitch income and now leveling guide paywall.
---
They’ve made no indication that pop caps will be equal to vanilla caps either though. They’re not above sacrificing authenticity for the sake of simplicity (1.12 AV, layering, No progressive itemization) so it wouldn’t shock me if pop caps were raised to avoid having to open more realms.
---
Explain it. It eigther goes over my head or you just used it wronf.
---
The true classic experience is clicking all your spells
---
In vanilla cross faction collusion was a bannable offense. Have a look online you can see a blue text response on it.
---
I highly doubt they would ban someone for this, but technically they could have done. I believe it was in the ToS more to prevent people fucking up the economies of each side but it was there
---
I have read it. It did not answer the question. 
---
Yeah haha you right.
---
Yup. Got a full time job now (oh how I miss the neet days) so I'm expecting this to take a long ass time. But I'm excited as fuck.
---
Sorry about your nuts, bro!
---
Paris, Stockholm or Frankfurt
---
I'll definitely try this out, flight paths are a good mini break.
---
In principle, I get it.  I do.
---
But why should that be wrong...?
---
As far as economic stability goes, that just means there's more money getting traded around, but that money still has to be made via conventional means.  It can't sit in your bank and collect interest or lose value on an in-game stock trade.  Is it ethically responsible?  Hell no.  Is it economically dangerous?  I don't think so...
---
I couldn't go back to the 1850s and give you $100billion USD because there probably wasn't even half of that in tangible or equitable form at that point in time.  Obviously there would be calculable exchange rates, but there still shouldn't be too much money that rapid inflation becomes a thing, since the acquisition rate of gold can be maintained and edited to adjust for the economy's needs if push comes to shove.
---
Regarding wealth distribution, it can only go as far as there is actual money in Classic.  If it becomes a problem, the Classic WoW value will go up so much that soon enough those in retail will have a hard enough time keeping up and the exchange rate will fall off or the market will suffer to obscurity (Or the retail economy is nuked to oblivion).  Meanwhile, the wealth distribution in Classic would still be nowhere near as severe as it is in retail currently.  It's easy enough to enjoy this game without a lot of in-game currency, and the means to acquire it are tried and true.  If you want to waste your hard earned Classic gold by trading it away to someone so you can soup up your retail account, be my guest.  I'd wager the greater negative impacts will be seen in retail than Classic.
---
That being said, will I mute/ignore/report every single person who spams trade chat with these messages?  You bet your ass I will!
---
Nope you lose the skeleton if you shapeshift
---
right, and since each individual only gets one skeleton the evidence of a battle won't last long because once people go somewhere else and die again their skeleton will be gone unlike in vanilla where skeletons lasted until server reset
---
I recognize your name as someone who only comments on layering stuff, so I disregarded absolutely everything you typed. Just giving you a heads up.
---
What's that about the new server names now? 'Cause Firemaw is an excellent choice.
---
Blizzard has EU datacenters in 2 locations: [Paris and Frankfurt](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Europe_region_realm_list_by_datacenter), dunno where Classic servers are located though.
---
if you have MSCT you see glance :)
---
&gt;The question I'm being specific about is whether or not they're going to allow people who have done bad shit to escape the bad shit they've done.
---
I feel like maybe there's an issue with your understanding of the English language that's causing a barrier in communication here.
---
The answer in the screenshot that I posted is the answer to your question.

There has never been a "this guy didn't break the rules, so he's not allowed to use a paid service" rule.  You being fanny flustered over someone doing something that was not a violation of the rules does not mean that he loses the ability to do anything with his account.

Cheap

I've seen once a video of a guy who named his character Frostmane (a level 4 troll) and went over to Dun Morogh. Walked around in stealth and unstealthed RP walking looking like the mob just respawned. 
---
Got hit, equipped his fiery enchant and went to town.
---
This. Back then the idea of your lvl 49 mate coming to help you as a 25 was common - get those elite qs done
---
Listen man, im all for him getting paid for doing his hard work. But is his twitch not blowing up, hundreds/thousands of subs/donos and a huge viewerbase when it comes out not enough for him. 
---
Someone is just going to leak the shit
---
I dont get it, if its easier the rag and thunderfury, but its end game and just a status symbol?
---
Ads are great revenue for websites that have constant traffic over the span of a year. But for a website like Joana's, where the majority of the traffic will only be there for a month or two, the revenue would be very, very low. We're talking about a couple of thousands of dollars if we're generous through ads, or hundreds of thousands of dollars through selling guides.
---
90% of all video game subs that is online are full of negative people complaining about the smallest to the largest of things. Redditors just like to complain /shrug
---
Experienced players know it aint over until you beat the Blu loading bar boss. Its like phase 2 of a boss fight
---
It still isn't classic to only have 1 corpse skeleton.
---
Agreed they have not been 100% clear on this.
---
Please link the part where betraying your faction was mentioned on ToS

You mean installing your new discs
---
character copy would be nice if the limit it, like creating an alternate reality for your character that stays in vanilla while your "main" character lives on and goes to explore outland. (probably make it so you can only do this once)
---
That's true, Blizzard will probably put a hard cap since they want to preserve the feeling of community and you can't have that if there's a bunch of people on the server.
---
That said, I don't know why they don't budge on the AQ material grind issue then. As others have pointed out, even if all things are equal and the server populations are exactly the same as in vanilla--people are going to stockpile.
---
If the server populations are going to be bigger, which I think will be the case given their somewhat vague comments, based on this:
---
Then that AQ materials issue will be even more of a "problem".
---
Niar had some great rogue videos that I always watched.
---
Clearly you weren't here for the rampart ama
---
I support the decision. It's unfortunate, but they're right. People took it too far spelling stuff out with corpses. You have to behave if you want nice things.
---
You're right it is, I'm sure it will be fine.
---
Thanks, i needed a good laugh this morning. And i would go for the 100 duck sized horses every time.

I have a life but it'll have to wait.

Great video. You got one thing "wrong" tho. The people Who left the room should have been the ones who havent reserved a name. Since there are MANY more of those people. Not the other way around. If you would have looked at the polls you would have known this. Otherwise Great video. Good Work 😁👍

It doesn't work so well now that pets scale up to the hunter's level. Back in the day a hunter's pet leveled independently so a max level hunter could have a lvl 18 cat
---
And/or that you need to optimise your cool down use. Once had at prot warrior that barely used ignore pain. Went OoM a few times keeping him alive until I realised what was up and let him know.
---
Legion and BFA were like relogging real quick. I'd be surprised if it was as bad as people think it will be. 
---
And if something bad does happen then its just another classic launch for the nostalgic feel
---
Hundreds of thousands? Nah. Not even 100k I would bet.
---
It took me 6 months to level my first char. No regrets. Loved every minute.
---
awesome, can't wait to give this a go
---
We don't know that they won't change it yet. The community provided excellent reasons and ideas for the change, and they've been receptive thus far.
---
Did auto pilot say they were porting over to classic?

---
I wish i could add you all to my friends list to see you log out at lvl 12
---
Yeah, that is why you punish the people doing it. You don't take all the sticks from every kid in the neighborhood if one kid hits someone with you. You discipline the bad kid. Your logic (and theirs) is terrible and won't actually negate people spelling bad things. They can use different characters and accounts, something gold sellers have in bulk.
---
What? I can see the guides on his site still... No paywall? Is this some attempt to defame Joanna while promoting another guide?
---
Undeead males throw up devil horns when they cast as well. 🤟🏽
---
Seems like a terrible way to fix broken specs and classes. Why would you put core abilities and what not on trinkets and so forth? Why exactly are you scared of just buffing/nerfing/tweaking the normal way?
---
Finally someone is asking the right and important questions here!
---
RFK/RFC suck so bad. Such a pain to get to the entrance and really didn't enjoy the dungeon itself. ST/Mara were fun though
---
Yea, after I wrote what they would need to do I realized just how likely it could be. Have a pair of mages or a mage/x pair aoe farm rep to honored, and have them ported around for the quest during the raid to get the Quintessence. Only having access to 1 tranq shot hunter could cause a wipe if they get bad RNG and it resists/misses/dodges/whatever, but not anything too bad to ruin the whole run most likely. Not having enough fire res gear could cause issues? They probably have strategies implemented to deal with the lack of fire res for the Rag fight though, but I wouldn't know what they are.
---
The amount of coordination is really high and the number of people necessary goes well above the 40 in the raid, but I can see it working out. It feels much more impressive after thinking about how much *more* they will have to do to make it happen week 1.
---
&gt; although mostly prime ones
---
Just so you know, these result in the same amount of net money the channel gets paid per sub.
---
There is no difference between a prime sub and a paid sub.
---
Big blue dress, Pat pvp, serenity now funeral, etc.
---
This all sounds like trying to justify stealing the guide. It’s his guide, his choice whether it’s free or not.
---
Same here. They haven't let me live it down either.
---
I think i'm going to play tauren even though i have an internal monologue struggle about not having Hardiness as an Orc
---
This is a joke right? A horde only server lul

12 year olds trying to grief people into feeling the angst they have inside.

The game could still be fun despite them.

Anything above 12 is now pay to access. No, it's not defamation.
---
"what are you in for?" - "someone asked to upvote twice and I told him to upvote twice."
---
&gt; We don't know that they won't change it yet. The community provided excellent reasons and ideas for the change, and they've been receptive thus far.
---
I assume you are talking about AQ... I agree. Not changing the requirements is less authentic. Blizzard seems to disagree.
---
You can laugh because you have an in game addon, or you can say "screw it" and follow another guide. 
---
I have used Joana's guides so much for free on private servers. If he want's to charge us for his work now, I have no problems with that and will gladly support him for all the great work he has done. 
---
Shut up and take my money! &lt;3
---
Yeah, because they combined the melee dps from 2-4 guilds for a speed run. You can do Onyxia with 40 priests, but you're not going to succeed as a guild with that kind of raid makeup.
---
I wanna see people wiping in RFC because they think it's gonna be a piece of piss. I want classic to be just as difficult as it was on the original release. You have to be organised and prepared to succeed.

succubus is great with drain tanking. it has the highest dps of any pet and uses no mana so if you get dark pact you can have 0 downtime.

---
is it just my memory or didn't think throw all 51-60 in together?
---
Ahh yes i got Staff of Jordan from some gorilla in STV still remember that and i could use it too which was a bonus.
---
*defame*
---
I don’t think that word means what you think it means.
---
I think an important aspect of skeletons in Classic is them acting as a "warning" of sorts. Think of them as the Dark Souls messages, in a way.  
---
You approach a new questing hub or chokepoint in a path and you notice a few skeletons on the ground, perhaps a corpse of a person who hasn't even released yet or just Alt+F4'd. You know some ganking's going down so you take the hint and avoid that place for a while.  
---
This will truly be missed.
---
Yeah, he should absolutely work 60 hours a week and not sell his product.
---
Short answer, No.
---
If you want to do it because it makes the game more enjoyable for you, do it.
---
But essentially, Warriors are one of the most gear dependant classes in the game, and that dependance highly revolves around your weapon. Ideally you should always be putting on whatever weapon has the highest topend damage that you can find. Not only because this simply increases your damage all around, but mostly because the rage you generate is based on the damage you hit for. The more rage you get, the faster you kill shit.
---
Also, a one hand weapon hits fast, which means you basically have to stand infront of a mob and trade hits with them, soaking up a ton of damage and causing you to need to sit and eat way more often. The effect this has in your leveling speed is dramatic. But when you have a slow 2 hander, you do what is called hamstring kiting, which causes you to only trade hits with the mob 1 for 1. This is ridiculously more efficient, you almost won't need to eat at all, just bandage every few mobs.
---
And when you hit 30 and start using sweeping strikes every fight to kill 2 mobs at a time, you want all 5 stacks to do as much damage as possible, anything less is wasted rage.
---
As for your sheild bash point. You should still have a 1hander and shield in your inventory at all times, for emergencies. And you should also have a weapon swap macro ready to go to quickly switch and interrupt a caster and then switch back to your 2hander.
---
What I mean is why would anyone want a static mmorpg, as much as you like the raids and dungeons of classic, you will get bored of them after you've gotten everything you can from them
---
Explain to me how I used the meme wrong. It is extremely simplistic.
---
Totally doable! That’s how I level most of the time. Don’t be shy once you’re in the world though. It’s very organic to meet fellow adventurers the quests and zones are designed
---
You think you see them, but you don't.

---
Paywall for me.
---
Yeah, as KashXz said, you'll have the best experience out of anyone. The problem is, you see, that 1.2k hours in Classic WoW really isn't that much. From Classic all the way to the most recent expansion, I've got around about 7500 hours played on WoW, and I dare say that I'm not even in the top 20% of this sub in terms of played time. It's some serious dedication
---
&gt;And that is, that the hardcrap on servers will be roughly the same as it was in vanilla, because the world is not designed to handle larger populations.
---
I wish blizzard would just clarify this in the AMA.
---
&gt;The medium cap holds more than more - because they are layered.
---
So if the modern medium cap is the same to vanilla full cap, and the modern medium cap uses extensive layering--is this not a big problem? 
---
One assumption as player that I'd make is that if I'm playing on a medium/high server that I'm going to be relatively safe from huge queues when the vanilla cap is enforced--right?
---
But if the medium population server I'm playing is in fact heavily layered, then once blizzard decides to kill layering/enforce a hard cap--everyone's going to have problems on those servers.
---
I have no sympathy for people getting screwed over like that when they're playing on FULL servers, btw. 
---
I mean, if medium pop(2019) = full pop(2006), then one could reasonably say that a low pop(2019) = high pop(2006). 
---
Is a modern low pop server using extensive layering when there's peak activity on the servers? That would be really strange to me.
---
This is a mistake.
---
To damage the good reputation?  Johanna is pretty well loved on Reddit.
---
You specifically stated it was designed to be casual. I'm assuming with this Olympic level backpedaling you are trying to save a little face from the stupid comments earlier. 
---
&gt;There is nothing hardcore in WoW
---
Or not. 
---
This is flat wrong. WoW took the opportunity to make leveling fun. That is all.
---
I'm not sure why it is so difficult for you to understand the concept. As you seem to think caps helps. But THE GAME WAS DESIGNED WITH BOTH IN MIND. THERE ARE PARTS OF THE GAME THAT ARE CASUAL, AND PARTS THAT ARE NOT. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE AND CONTINUES TO BE NOW. 
---
There is a reason Nax was seen by less than a 1% of the population and less than half ever raided in vanilla.
---
I'm assuming you just didn't play vanilla.
---
I mean, remove the word “physically” and maybe the entire second sentence and you have a pretty barebones explanation of what’s going on without having to mention instances, phasing, virtualization, etc.

This comment deserves more likes :D

About 10 percent of the guys in that game did nothing but try and torture the rest of the people playing the game. With predictable results.

Nope, stop putting words in people's mouthes. This is just a dumb way to monetize.

What if they added Fatigue to flying mounts being in the air?

The content that requires flying can be achieved, but in many cases you would still use a flight path to go long distance.

You are forgetting that after falling down as a ghost you would end up in the sea off Azshara with a very very long run/swim to the next graveyard.

Sharing numbers like that with the community doesn't really benefit them in any way. The most likely reaction, no matter what they said, would be people complaining about how they're doing it wrong.
---
However, being able to make a big announcement about "we have 2 million people playing WoW Classic" makes for a good marketing beat.
---
Well, the 8.2 version caused mass errors when i tested it. So could you link the classic version.
---
Are you looking for a rewarding challenge? Try classic. BFA is pretty and fun but classic just feels  so much more rewarding imo
---
Disagree.

This looks great!

Do you think I could use it to type? For my work too?

People tap out of 100 races *all the time* after rips. No-one gets given shit about it, because it's usually a perfectly reasonable thing to do after the sleep deprived push that is a 100 race. Even in this context where there were money prizes. People tap out of far shorter races too, I'm pretty sure Kammell has done it in races he organized and provided the prize pool for. Does that make him a bitch?
---
Why didn't *you* push to 100 for the money? Are you bitch?
---
The people who were giving havoc, steel, nugi and ziz shit here seemed to be hung up on the whole them joining method thing.
---
I think the issue people had with it, is that he has been taking donations etc saying it helps him create the content then paywalls it without being upfront that it was his intent from the start, double dipping.
---
I mean technically so does no guild banks being added to if we want to look at other things that caused account sharing.
---
Rolling a Troll hunter, then going to Mulgore as soon as I can tame a pet and I'm going to cry while I try to tame Mazzranache and people keep killing her.

I agree. Best in slot fury boots are the worst looking shoes ever
---
Plenty of people charge for addons, they just do it in a roundabout way.
---
Give you the addon itself for free with some basic data as a "trial". Then if you want the rest of the data, that's what you gotta pay for.
---
Technically not against Blizzard's policy on addons.
---
This is pretty much what they have been saying all along, so nothing new, really. People have just gone mental because of unexpected behaviour during *testing*...

Thanks! I guess there's no way to know before release which server will be where, for english servers at least.
---
It is quite silly. Parry should be available to all enemies with a weapon. As a warrior its learned at the trainer at level 8 or something
---
Legion launch was cake.
---
BfA launch was garbage and unplayable for hours for many. For the first hour the only people that seemed to have little issue with logins were streamers, which is a mighty big 🤔

Dude, your keybinds!

Best thing about this game is that you can change weapons on the fly. When I level warriors I try to have both sword/shield and a 2 hander on me if possible. If I want more defense, I slap the old board on and tank, if I want to sacrifice armor for great attacks I rock the two hander. 
---
Remember: you can tank dungeons as a Fury or Arms spec all the way to 60!
---
Yes. Random bullshit and getting outsmarted by other players is a thing that happens and has happened to me. It's part of my nostalgia. 
---
You are not ready for classic. I bet you played on a normal or RP server, assuming you played at all.
---
Lol, there’s a fine line between dickish behavior and taking advantage of an exploit in the game for the sheer purpose of wasting someones time. OP mentioned players would have to contact a GM because they would get stuck down there and not be able to climb up. When you get to the the point where time is wasted outside the game because of someone’s behavior in it, it’s no longer cool.
---
Do they include optimal routing or just help with the quests you have?
---
Yes.  It doesn't have to be like that, it was just an example.  Their [hit table](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table) works similar to that.
---
&gt; Also... it was active on beta.
---
They removed it in the last bit of beta and it was not active in the re-released 40-45 beta phase.
---
* *Number of people who would go out of their way and put forth all that time and effort into spelling something out with corpses* = maybe 2

I really appreciate the work you do. I'm curious about mages getting spell hit @ 60. I feel like I should stack as much as possible, is that incorrect?
---
It's drinking the water!

Fk me! So you're telling me alliance and horde was already working together back then!? This was beyond awesome! \^\^

It's absurd not to preserve it... Please, reconsider it.

I see that now, thanks 😀

I was hung up on troll/orc hunter also..

So I went Tauren instead.
---
Mulgore, baby!
---
Guess it’s still Classic then. You know, seeing as there will be skeletons in it - albeit limited to one per player. The title of this thread is severely misleading.
---
get those paper ready , no time for her
---
Every strategy in this thread is fucking pure genius and core to what makes Classic so great. Bravo to you all lmao
---
Ooh true enough!
---
don't tell me what to do
---
But levelling your character is a bit different to watching a stream and donating, and also a ton of people don’t donate while watching streams.
---
&gt; Afterwards I'll probably dump links to them somewhere
---
Can you not do that please
---
&gt; If we had time travel, we would use it to get the exact values. But we dont.
---
There was literally a beta with all the correct values lmao.
---
You are asking the wrong people better talk to youre fiance about how she will feel if you move into Azeroth. Luckily i am divorced and all my income comes from rental properties.
---
Maybe 13 years ago, yea, but with how mainstream raiding has gotten, I don't think that's so true anymore.
---
Could I do this as a priest with command undead? :o
---
That's a dick move and I LOVE IT!
---
I took two weeks off work too. Nostalgia is a drug.
---
Aren’t the token units disregarded similar to hunter pets?
---
Very true. From his streams Joana seems like a very down to earth and enthusiastic Vanilla player. He's done a lot of testing and you cannot blame the guy for wanting to be paid for his content. You can pay the $5 once and just screen cap all the info you need and not resub if you're feeling cheap, *but* I believe his guides are "living" guides and will be edited for better pathing and such.
---
5 dollars isn't a lot I agree. That's why I've subbed to him on twitch a few times and was thinking about also donating. Since he has constantly said his guide would be free on his stream. I thought that was really nice of him. It's not about the money now, but about lying to people.

&gt;Layering is used to reduce overall player traffic in a region
---
\&gt; You're confusing layering with sharding, and sharding will not be in the game.

Layering also accomplishes the purpose of not overcrowding a region, just in a different way from sharding.

GM tickets used to take a long ass time. I'm sure for some people, the ones whose corpse got stuck on the mountain, this basically became "You can't play this character today".

yup

What if someone takes the name while you're recreating the character
---
Lol that is wonderful.
---
[Get on my level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqWFYOxjZ54)
---
Im not great at math but i'm pretty sure 40 is not 60.
---
How do we get the values from 40 to 60 ?
---
And if you think the Beta stayed long enough to give us time to make a leveling route, then you should've made one for us.
---
My semester starts the same day of release and if i skip class i’ll get dropped :(
---
The thing is, WoW was a good balance between the old school and more casual. And Classic will still be that same balance. Retail has gone so far towards the casual (for the average player, I'm aware the challenges are there but you have to go out of your way to get them rather than them being the default game) it's ridiculous.
---
Melderon used Beta values because he was in the beta (I helped him test things). But he still did not put as much time and effort as Joana, and his individual class guides are not as detailed or as heavily routed.
---
According to himself, he made over a million US dollars off the first one he made, I am not surprised he monetizes it again, but I think he should have been more upfront about it.
---
Why repeatedly mention how free your guide is, just to bait &amp; switch people later on? Could have just been honest and said "I'm offering a free preview for 1-40 currently, when we're closer to launch I'll market it as a complete product for as little as $ 5" and people wouldn't give him shit now.
---
nope i dont think so.
---
Why do you need this info NOW if you don't have the game installed? The only reason to know this info is to decide what server to play on so you can create your character, something you can't do without the game installed. Honest question
---
There are no achievements in Classic as they were introduced in WotLK.
---
Silithus will not be populated with quests until all the AQ stuff.
---
i did pay for it, i bought it, i also donate on his website because he deserves it, i mean for his sake, a lot of people will not like it. i think he should most definately be paid, i just think he can go about it a little better. to be fair, me and my friend both paid the membership fee, if people can pay for a sub on twitch to watch some guy, they should pay for this guys full work.
---
It is absolutely a legitimate job. How long do you think it takes to develop a route, test it and write a guide? It took me over 3500 hours, not including my co-writer’s work. Each of the main 1-60 guides hit over 80 pages of content. Joana worked on his Alliance side guide for well over a year, and he had help. He absolutely gets to decide if he would like to earn something for his work.

I've got the best wares in the land.

Joana's guide is available for free - you can support him via patreon if you wish, but it's entirely optional. And he has been working very hard to update, provide an Alliance version, and offer class specific versions.
---
So, you can either get an innacurate and half-assed guide for free, or pay a token sum for an accurate and tested guide made by a person the community appreciates? 🤔 
---
I don’t see a problem with either choice here 🤷🏻‍♂️ it follows the same logic most products do, i.e you get what you pay for 🙃

This was also a shield model in TBC iirc haha
---
Level 5-10, setup addons, fishing 75, cooking whatever I can fish up

\*Teeth sucking noise\*
---
Hakkar was just the bastard child of Ravencrest...
---
Oh man this hits home. I’ve been wanting to quit, or at least significantly curb, my snus use and have been planning to use this upcoming week to do it. It’s deceptive because of its convenience.
---
there wont be any super faction inbalance, there are only a few servers
---
Awesome work, thanks!!
---
Why would I even subscribe when there are better guides out there for free. Its definetly not worth it ^^
---
How do I upload your guide to Guidelime? It's already inside?
---
So people can't spell out gold selling websites. Why would you need to spell shit out with skeletons when you can just use the chat?
---
He can do what he wants - he made the content.
---
I dont think its a great idea but i dont see why he cant do this. Demand is up due to classic launch so his earnings should be.
---
Haha alright but regardless, personally for me nothing beats playing with friends so to each their own i guess 😂
---
I don't think it's scummy to want to monetize something that has value that you've created.  I also don't really think he meant for it to come off as scummy as it has but hes been advertising his guide and the fact that the whole thing was there for anyone to see made it seem like it would stay free and then putting it behind a flat paywall less than a week before launch is just...not a good look.
---
I don't know how much more or less a dono button and some ads would have got than this approach but I do know there wouldn't be all this negativity pointed at Joana.
---
Am I the only one bothered that the top is setup Month /Day /Year, and the bottom dates are Day /Month /Year?
---
Whole #nochanges is pretty much foolish argument. Because in reality it has been #nochangesbutstillsomechanges.
---
I think most people are going to prep for STV by lvling to 60 in dungeons then joining the STV party.
---
"At least in retail the angry people only hate the current game"
---
kek
---
There is actually a timeline we can adequately reconstruct.
---
Pre-2002/pre original FFAlpha - The Emerald Dream was supposed to be a zone that you went to when you died. No maps of this were ever found or discovered nor was this in the original alpha. So it was clearly dropped early on, as no evidence of this exists in any of the game files, including the first leaked alpha. 
---
2003 - Various versions of the ED end up in various Beta builds. Kaplan mentions it as endgame content in a quote but doesn’t state if it’s a zone or raid. He also mentions Druids will have a “link” with it, then goes into mention Moonglade. 
---
In its final iteration it is 3 zone maps, each of which is about the size of a standard leveling zone. Along with some map fragments that connect those areas. 
---
These maps are labeled as “raid” which confuses data miners later. 
---
(That being said, it’s possible these were intended as raids similar to EQ style raids, which are uninstanced and are often leveling zone sized. These ED maps predate MC the first real raid in WoW, so maybe they were initially planning on uninstanced raids.)
---
2006 - Neathera says 
---
&gt;”As for the Emerald Dream, there are no plans for anything as of yet but it is a consideration for the future. The Emerald Dream opens up a lot of different opportunities and the Burning Crusade is definitely not going to be the last of the expansion packs. There are many different places and storylines that can be pursued. The story is going to keep growing and as it does so, people will get to experience it."
---
Basically a non answer. 
---
It sounds like development had stopped entirely by then. Which is backed up by the fact that the map files in game stayed unchanged after the last beta client. 
---
2008 - in Wrath there’s a quest given by Remulos in Moonglade that sends you into the dream. The Dream in this instance is just a phase version of Moonglade with a green filter added. 
---
A similar thing happens in the Valythria fight in icc. She opens Dream portals...to a green filtered phased version of the encounter. 
---
2013 - Metzen - "The Emerald Dream is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a green lush forest theme would get very boring, so the Emerald Dream would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion.Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a green lush forest theme would get very boring."
---
Then by 2016 it’s part of Legion.
---
But yeah. It’s not a who is correct situation as much as one where you can see, via evidence, that there were plans that changed.
---
Avoid it. Then come back at 60 and defeat everyone.
---
Never seen this, amazing.
---
In many ways vanilla did feel like the first act of LotR. Especially when you consider how it starts.
---
Many starting zones have the same qualities you find in the Shire, Mulgore probably the best example.
---
Read this thread. Thirty minutes before servers go live. If you log in earlier you will get DC'd.
---
5 whole dollars?! Come on man.
---
I regret not getting in on Vanilla in thine to grab that.  I got every other colkectors edition up to WoD.
---
are you saying its not 2004
---
I'm not really a specialist in PVP my idea is to lvl fast enough to be done with stranglethorn while everybody sleeps...
---
but i got a good playlist to run while in STV https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ZMS5g0vRQ2SSu0xpYyqp0?si=vXStM3RSTsGQEwV_sOhMSA
---
Pretty shitty thing to post.
---
Thank you for this! Once I train a pet to add the ability via spellbook I can easily abandon it correct? Or do I need to keep any of the variations in the stable?
---
Some are. I definitely prefer old male undead models and animations.
---
I’ll probably keep some free action, swiftness potions, or health pots on hand since I’m gonna be doing alchemy / herbalism. But otherwise I’m just gonna let it flow.
---
There are instructions [here](https://sage-guide.netlify.com/lime.html).
---
you don't have to create your character to want to decide what server you're playing on.  honest answer
---
If you mean the Danes and Norwegians, mostly because Shazzrah was heavily over populated and also low key because it will be the main realm for Spain, which apparently doesn't prefer to speak and write English.
---
havent the devs confirmed yesterday that the Silithus quest will unlock in p5 for the most part?
---
They said the minutes leasing up to launch, did the specify later how many minutes that was?
---
I sent them an e-mail :)
---
Transmog was just a lazy way of skirting the fact that their armor designs got largely shitty. For the first six tiers of so, almost everything looked pretty awesome and wearing the latest and greatest actually felt good. Now that you can just transmog awesome old gear, there's basically no pressure on Activision to keep every tier looking amazing.
---
Starting with Cataclysm they've had so many bland ass tiers where the raid sets looked like leveling crapola, I can see why no one gives a shit about trying to get the latest gear anymore. I mean, look at MoP Monk tier sets and the Uldir warrior tier. It seriously looks like it should be blues from Halls of Lightning from WOTLK or something. Laughable.
---
They still haven't really topped sets like the Judgment set and the Dreadnaught set in terms of pure aesthetic quality, which is really pathetic.
---
The only truly exceptional post turd WOW set I can think of is the Blackhand's set. Not sure where that came from, but it's basically the only good thing about WoD.
---
You think making the game untrue to itself increases authenticity?
---
GOOD TRY DUDE
---
Well they implied they would be doing a restart of them before go live so safe to assume they will be up minimum 30mins before.
---
Someone grew up in a lot of turmoil.
---
What I took from the AMA is that servers will be up like they are now... And the 'Enter World' button will go solid, and away you go!
---
There are only so many quests in the game so most guides wind up doing many of the same quests. The routing is usually different and ya the routing is quite different from what I've seen of Joana's.
---
wdym joana did for as far as possible
---
I did this during the BC beta as well. Hilariously, the mobs were named Sisters of Grief. Very apt.
---
The armorless mounts are in Classic Wowhead database, so it seems like we might, even though they haven't really mentioned much of them

Clothies must have been starring daggers at you when you got that hat.
---
Then decide when you install the game?
---
Let's see how many medium pop servers even are around by the time launch is about to happen
---
I'm just going to boil a bunch of eggs, peel them and supplement carbs with cashews.
---
Golemagg and Firemaw imo
---
That moment when you're an inch from your screen, amazed by what the spell icons actually replicate.
---
World have payed for an ingame addon Version. Not for this
---
&gt; I wish blizzard would just clarify this in the AMA.
---
Would be nice.
---
&gt; But if the medium population server I'm playing is in fact heavily layered, then once blizzard decides to kill layering/enforce a hard cap--everyone's going to have problems on those servers.
---
Yeah, but I think blizzard and many others believe that the amount of players that will stop playing before phase 2, is relatively high, reducing the need for layering. 
---
Is it like that? Probably to some extend, but who knows - time will tell.
---
&gt;So if the modern medium cap is the same to vanilla full cap, and the modern medium cap uses extensive layering--is this not a big problem?
---
Blizzard stated in the AMA that they will monitor they amout of layers, and adjust it accordingly. I guess that means layering will be used when needed, and dialed back when not.
---
Sure but you get some of the best items for most of the game from being r13 and r14, so I think there should be skill required.
---
**Nice**
---
Ah it said minutes so I would definitely think a few minutes not half an hour or more. That would probably really get people annoyed.
---
Do you not have phones?

It was pointed out by you and some other guy talking out of your asses.
---
If any of you have screenshots, videos, or actually facts about something being wrong with the guide then I'll be happy to discuss it.
---
All you've been doing is talking shit while clearly neither of you even test the guide.
---
Classic is in 5 days and we will see. I'll literally link you my 60 screenshot when I get there.
---
which faction will u play?
---
The safest way as far as I can tell is to delete the character and have a buddy snag the name the instant you’ve deleted it. 
---
Then you can take your time to customize to your liking and coordinate your buddy to release the name right before you snag it back.
---
I don't see why anyone would be bothered about what gender the player behind your character is, unless they're trying to sleep with you. If they're just looking to make friends, what does it matter if you're male or female irl?
---
If you want to play a female because you prefer the models/animations, go for it! People who use the excuse 'I'd rather stare at a female butt all day than a male one' are suffering from a very fragile masculinity.
---
If you like playing a female character, then do it. It doesn't mean anything about you or who you are in real life.
---
Well, well, well. Look what we have here. 
---
An actual superiority of tauren hooves!

I'm releasing my [1-60 Guide for horde side aswell in a 2-3 days.] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pc_3h0HA-BgSInuEHP21iQckq0OGEv3zV6Oom-8Kqm4/edit)
---
Currently it seems like it will be roughly 10-14h faster then Joana's guide to 60 as a hunter.
---
I have played on all the stresstests/tested the guide to level 50 on beta (i leveled to 45 on recent beta a few days ago and did all the 45-50 quests aswell)
---
I managed to get first 15 on the latest stesstest aswell and also first 45 on the beta last week.
---
Right now only 1-30 part of the guide is out, but in 3 days 30-60 &amp; Tirisfal &amp; Mulgore will be out aswell.
---
Interesting is wiping your raid or killing the boss worth it ? More threat = more dps uptime because dps doesnt need to stop because of threat = faster time to kill = shorter fight = healers can worry less about going oom. And armor from gloves are not that high of dmg mitigation to make tank instantly squishy

---
Man it is tough. I made a promise to a family member to lay off smoking weed from july to october and I have had so many times where I am just boooooored. With weed I can spend hours watching youtube, netflix, and gaming but without it I lack the motivation to do most things. Classic would have been here so much faster if I was smoking the days away. I still plan to smoke up October 1st but I also think smoking all day everyday is destructive behavior. Maybe if I had some ambition outside of being entertained by media I would give more of a fuck

&lt;LTR&gt; |US|Horde|PvP|Herod|Fri/Sat 8-11CST|Semi-Hardcore
---
**Intro:** Currently on retail, we are Low Tier Raiders, however when we form on classic we will be simply LTR. We are very excited to finally head back into the Azeroth we knew and loved. We are driven to create a community that is not only successful at raiding, but also at being a home for those without. Many of us are also very excited to participate in PvP content including Battlegrounds and World PvP!  
---
**About Us:** We are a guild that has been active since early Legion on US Emerald Dream. We are more on the casual side but have achieved every AOTC since the forming of our raid team. Our most progressed tier was in BoD when we achieved 5/9 mythic as a weekend casual/semi-hardcore guild. We have slowed down in BFA due to mutual lack of interest, but many of our members are amped up and ready to tackle classic! Many of our players have interests beyond raiding too, as we love to PvP.  
---
**Recruitment:** We are currently accepting all roles for our raid team. Once we have a full roster, we will still accept people to add to our already amazing community! We will always accept exceptional players to add to our ranks.
---
Currently we have a high need for additional tanks (MT and OT positions filled) as well as DPS.  
---
**Raid Times:** We pride ourselves on being a semi-hardcore, family-friendly weekend raiding guild. Our aim as of right now is to raid Friday and Saturday 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, however this is subject to change depending on current and future member feedback. Our most important focus is to keep our family friendly schedule.  
---
**Loot:** We will be distributing loot through an EPGP and Loot Council system. The loot council system will be used for items such as legendaries, set completions, and specific BiS loot. This will be transparent for all members to see and be aware of.   
---
**Expectations:** We expect to push into endgame content with a strong pace and continue that throughout all phases. We are looking for players that are seeking to reach level 60 quickly and begin preparing to raid. We expect all members to be courteous to one another, and raiders to do their part in getting prepared for raid.    
---
**Contact:**

---
&gt; private servers with questionable accuracy 
---
Yeah, with mobs actually *harder* than vanilla, lol.
---
Beeing a rogue.
---
Well from my experience in IT people tend to leave a decent buffer after restarts for important events in case they encounter any issues with servers coming online. It is always wise to indicate it will be less time than expected in case there are issues.
---
Definitely a favorite of mine also lol. Gotta love it.
---
Only if you are a warrior.
---
They were blaming racists and gold farmers, not server problems.
---
Not funny at all, abuse of game mechanics. Shame on you
---
Just for me personally, its because EU friends/guildies can play with reasonable ping/time difference
---
I ran RFC during the stress test- myself tanking (LV15 Druid), my friend healing (Lv15 Shaman), then Lv15 Mage, LV12/13 Hunter and Lv12/13 Warlock. Myself &amp; friend are veterans, Mage knew what he was doing and would carefully Sheep a cultist *after* I had lured the pack away from the patrols. The Warlock used his VW (on passive at least) and the Hunter ran out of ammo at the last boss.
---
My friend was close to oom on some pulls even with the CC, so a patrol may have done us in. I foresee a *lot* of wiping on the initial clearing with all the troggs, as well in the cultist area.
---
Maybe, but they aren't on any BIS lists for some reason.
---
excellent

---
putting your guide on display for free and then slapping a paywall on it less than a week before release comes off as scummy and is a bad business decision when free equal quality or better alternatives exist.  
---
He might make an okay chunk of money from people who don't find it scummy or just don't care but I think he ruined his brand.  He could have made more from a brand than he'll ever make from what I'd guess is hundreds of people who pay for this.
---
There will definitely release more realms. In yesterdays AMA they said they are likely to bring more online for people to switch to when they see how bad the queues are on Shazzrah and Golemagg
---
Warriors are the only thing I like more about retail than vanilla. In retail, you actually feel like a warrior and you have abilities and utility. In vanilla, you have auto attack.
---
Sunder like no tomorrow
---
What? No
---
In classic, unlike vanilla and pservers, you can disable addons in game while logged in (instead of deleting the folder) similar to retail.
---
I hope so, those mounts looked so good.
---
Thx for checking out my profile.
---
Can't we simply reduce that to like 5 skeletons or similiar? This should be still cool, but without those disadvantages.

Nope said vc grp the quest was specifically for his head and  on my server people who wanted to run the dungeoun would make grps for deadmines but if everyone's intent was a vc group to stick it through till the end  for vancleefs head
---
You can't charge for addons, it's against TOS from blizzard. 
---
Every addon has to be free &amp; open source.
---
I personally play males but i dunno who gives two shits. Juat play what you think looks coolest. Youre gonna be looking at it for a long time
---
My curiosity is getting the best of me.
---
&gt; 1 horse sized duck 
---
I'll take one of those, please.
---
did not know that :o
---
&gt; he made them free 
---
No, he didn't.  He developed them in the open and let people use them for testing.
---
He then returned them to the place they had always been, namely behind the paywall.
---
Joana has never given guides out for free.
---
&gt; I think he'll make WAY less money this way.
---
What kind of galaxy brained statement is that?
---
You think he'll make LESS money by charging for content than he would giving it away for free?
---
I know it's only 4am, but that's probably going to be the dumbest thing I hear all day.
---
Most of my chars are female classes because it looks better and I prefer the animations. Undead priests, rogue blood elf and void elf. Then male troll druid and orc warrior. Depends on the class tbh
---
are you sure?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but you would need a subscription for a game that isn't released yet in order to reserve a name, yes? If I buy a subscription now, a portion of that month will have gone completely to waste.
---
There's no such thing as STVietnam. People are going to be leveling. If they are ganking they are purposely slowing down, and will realize this after a very short amount of time.
---
"STVietnam" is a purely private server phenomenon, mostly because private servers didn't last very long before some drama caused their collapse or a new F R E S H was released, so there was little incentive to really push 60 fast.
---
The real PvP that happens is usually outside Booty Bay's entrance at max level and around Blackrock Mountain. This will slowly shift to outside ZG, Silithus, and finally EPL/WPL (though EPL/WPL will have a good amount of world PvP due to lucrative farming spots).
---
But pre-60 PvP? There will be some, obviously, because of the novelty of it. But not enough to call it "STVietnam".
---
You can go to any vanilla to WoD/Legion (?) raid and just instagib bosses for epic looking gear to slap onto your peasant crap gear.
---
You don't really have to "earn" it. It would be earned if you consider slapping 15year old content for 15minutes by walking by bosses who die from your AoE.
---
Will also go for a shaman. God we were so long gone and are finally coming home :)
---
I only really care about tbc... Thats feels like home. Arena and the honor system in tbc is the best by far. I super stoked for classic and will play it alot. But only until tbc comes out.
---
Navak and I will be giving our tool away for free: www.classicwow.live/leveling. It scored Navak the Horde first 30 in Beta as a Warrior and is guaranteed to speed you along your way to 60 as the fastest guide out there.
---
wont be available at release, it will have to wait until diremaul is opened
---
It is against TOS, "Developers may not create “premium” versions of add-ons with additional for-pay features, charge money to download an add-on, charge for services related to the add-on, or otherwise require some form of monetary compensation to download or access an add-on."
---
I heard WCMovies premium is shady at best. Save your money or research before paying up.
---
I’m so happy to hear things turned around for the better! I get what you mean - I stuck around, mainly because I was afraid of missing out on certain details. But I totally understand your point - so welcome back mate! Here’s to the few days left waiting!!
---
Model is to high res can't relate

---
That is not due to layering. If the ability to have more people per server was due to layering they couldn't remove layering after the initial rush. Layering is a solution to problems a higher pop cap creates, not the reason there is a higher pop cap.
---
Subtle but effective

I got a response back, patting me on the back for 'resolving the problem myself' in deleting the characters and making more on Arugal...  
---
...completely missing the fact that I got none of the names that I originally reserved as they're all long gone. I admit there's nothing they can do except take the names I had from some other guy who managed to get them, which would probably be shitty, but a freaking apology would have been nice I guess.
---
Well it’s good to see some faces from Dunemaul around, I’ll be on Horde Shazzrah assuming I can get in with the horrible queue times Blizzard are moaning about :)
---
I’m so thankful you’re willing to share this - thank you so much for the read, and allowing me to get a view of your amazing creativity ❤️ I don’t know why somebody downvoted you, please know I’m super thankful for your reply! Keep on writing!!
---
You are allowed to sell guides, just not as addons. I guess if people do it as addons you can report them. 
---
This is why you see most addons on github, because they MOST be open source and people should be able to see the source codes aswell (ofc they also get uploaded on other sites tho)
---
THIS is why I love WoW! You're a genius!
---
Considering Ion H. is the guild leader of &lt;Elitist Jerks&gt;, I don't think elitist culture is going anywhere :P
---
You're either good at your hobby or bad at your hobby, noob.
---
Everyone that made anything for Classic was working since January 2018. or more.
---
To be honest, that sounds like some sound advice.
---
Golemagg is 50/50 right now (discord roles). Firemaw not sure
---
&gt;Well that's just wrong. They were free during the whole beta.
---
The *testing* was free.  The final released product was paid.
---
You've never been right in this entire conversation.
---
All you're doing is showing that you're an entitled little punk crying because you don't get another man's hard work for free.
---
tbf, honor system releases with phase 2.
---
both of my vanilla Servo Arms are very offended rn
---
Yikes, you have to be able to take some skeptisism when you post something like this which comes across as someone being so salty over $5 lousy bucks that you start repping some free guide trying to get people to not support someone who spent thousands of hours putting a product together 🙃
---
RP-pvp here or the new PVP server :)
---
yeah the most profitable game in the world is free to play it doesn't take a galaxy brain to figure out that hard paywalls don't sell well in 2019 especially with non propriety content where better alternatives LITERALLY ALREADY EXIST.
---
lots of people WOULD have used his guide because he has name recognition that would drive a lot of people to it.  heres a few ways you can monetize it without a hard paywall that the VAST MAJORITY of customers WILL NOT PAY in 2019.
---
1.  literally just a dono button and some ads.  you get less money per customer but make up for it with volume.
---
2.  since hes streaming he can use it as a way to build his brand and they can feed off each other.   do I need to explain to you how successful streams make money since you seem oblivious to the year you live in?
---
3.  sell "merch".  again taking advantage of the brand that he already has and the traffic to his website you just make some wow related merchandise and you sell it on your site.   wow neckbeards love wow merch they'd literally just spend $25 on a tshirt with a funny wow meme printed on it because it's supporting Joana that nice guy with the free guide everyone loves.
---
If youre holding move forwards you will carry on.
---
I think it does cancel autorun.
---
Made me lol, thanks.
---
I support your decision to never, ever have children.
---
A couple less snowflakes will make the world a better place, for sure.
---
you know you're old school when you say vc
---
That happened 15 years ago. Go along, nothing to see here
---
I miss Xplay and TechTV. Nice fine op.
---
nah. Developers make the game world and its rules, players operate from there. I think exceptions should exist, particularly where patches / in-game changes are not possible - but this isn't one of them.
---
Also you didn't get stuck off the side of the mountain. You could still walk to a spirit healer (just took a long time) and/or drown as ghost and teleport to one. The funny part was how long it took people to realise it.
---
Pardon?
---
When you can get a horse
---
Back in the days, i played one level 20 human dressed as a Defias, and i was playing a bandit on a RP server, asking people to give me 3 copper coin or i will tell my allies who are hidding in the bushes to come out and execute them. Most of the time, they ignored, and i had to unstealth my 5 horde multiboxed character hidding nearby.
---
Currently it seems like it will be roughly 10-12h faster then Joana's guide to 60 as a hunter, however the guide is mostly optimized for rogues.
---
Right now only 1-30 part of the guide is out, but in 3 days 30-60, Tirisfal &amp; Mulgore will be out aswell.
---
Cool story.
---
It's his business and he'll run it how he wants.
---
(Spoiler:  He doesn't give a fuck what entitled little punks like you think.)
---
I love this kind of lollygagging. Reminds me of the first time someone told me of a CHEAT in Arathi Basin, all I have to do is hit alt+f4...
---
That right there is a right of passage.
---
Found the Diablo 3 player.
---
Quite funny and nicely done, but it lacks that little bit of truth these parodies usually have since Blizzard always wanted Classic to be a success.
---
I waited until I was 28 to try alcohol.  I still haven't tried any sort of tobacco product/drug/etc though.
---
I'm 31 now.
---
I've also never had sex or a relationship.  Do I win the virgin contest?
---
Ohh my :D, We learn from our mistakes
---
exactly, pin the spawn points for us while you're at it!
---
On Stormrage there was a dead undead by the front gate named "Welcomemat" (or something similar) for most of Vanilla.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
BRD emp run specifically will be run on ML 99% of the time and that's because the warrior tank will reserve Ironfoe to themselves and most people will be okay with that.
---
No warrior tank will want to roll on his IF against a rogue who will not even wear it as his preBiS, because his swords are better.
---
Nothing? If cheap people want to be cheap, they will always be cheap. But Joana has put a lot of work over the year so I hope most people will be generous enough to offer him compensation.
---
we’ll hate to point out a obvious one but.
---
TSM, Tradeskillmasters, has premium features. It’s allowed (and blizzard gms even exist in the goblin discord) but they do it in a roundabout way of using most of the information through their desktop app that sends info to your addon.
---
So it’s not impossible to get around the rules.
---
If they handle it similarly to how the last stress test worked, nah. The login servers shit the bed, but the world itself won't crash.
---
If they limit how fast players can get into the world through the login system, it protects the world from stupidity.
---
In Vanilla me and my friends did the same thing but we did it in Hyjal in that super deep pool under the tree at the end of the zone.  There was no GY in Hyjal so when they died they were forced to spirit res in WS.  We didn't even advertise anything, just invited random lowbies and summoned when they accepted.
---
[silence prey!](https://www.gnarlyguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/druid-feral-cat-wow.jpg)
---
Agreed.
---
It makes news and THEN WHAT? Why should we care about that?
---
Not the only one!
---
Not allowed skeletons in China. Got a appease the Chinese censor laws...
---
Most private servers fixed xp values like two years ago.
---
Aap will hold my hand, correct?  I know very little of the questing from vanilla but want to get my first toon to 60 asap.
---
Yeah T3 players weren't replacing gear until Kara. It's just that there weren't that many of them, so everyone just says Hellfire greens.
---
Might be a surprise but in 2019 when people ask "dumb" questions or things that are easily searchable they might just be trying to have human interaction called conversation but if you wanna shoot em down that's anyone's decision to make u don't wanna interact don't have to
---
&gt; You don’t want to get stuck in the mess with tons of players
---
On 3000 pop layers, hmmm.
---
*You* don’t, Blizzard does.
---
There are toxic noobs. People who EXTPECT to always be helped with every question.
---
And there are toxic elitist, people who think you are less worthy for being worce than them.
---
I would call a elitist, who minmax to the extreme and carefully plan out every minute he is online to better himself, a good elitist.
---
Noobs and elitist can be called the opposite of eachother, but none are toxic on there own.
---
Is the poison trainer somewhere in the same area as the first aid trainer? 
---
I can't remember, so just asking if someone does remember :D
---
World pvp won't be the same without it. Let them stay, please!
---
Even asking them not to be elitist was downvoted lol. Without newfriends there would be enough people for maybe 2 servers.
---
A double check, a triple check, a quadruple check to make sure the name is 100% correct before letting out the excitement.
---
You only need 2 people  tank/heals dps is literally duke a dozen.
---
I think it was called Dacke pvp. It was a gnome warlock from what I remember
---
Friends know i play wow. They just don't know what wow is (unlucky them)

---
And r/gaming is still the worst gaming sub on reddit. You get radiation sickness just browsing there.
---
This makes me more excited than I was previously. Thanks for the input bud.
---
Nope, it's not crusader strike. Crusader strike is an instant attack dealing physical dmg. Holy strike is more like a heroic strike, where your next auto attack is buffed.
---
Also Crusader strike existed in beta as well, don'T know, why OP missed this. It was a weak instant attack ,which put a stacking holy dmg taken debuff onto the enemy. It was replaced by seal of the crusader.
---
Both holy strike and the beta crusader strike are used by various scarlet crusade mobs.
---
Bows are only available in Darnassus at least.
---
Here's a +1 for being so timely on the meme'ing.
---
No it is not game breaking. I am really excited for classic wow and I think they have done a great job in recreating vanilla. The corpse skeleton change is my biggest bug bear with the game currently through.
---
Like other people wrote, most people will assume you're a guy IRL, regardless of whether your toon is male or female.  Personally I roll male taurens, female UD, female troll casters, male orcs, female humans and NE, male dwarf, female gnome.  
---
My first toon was a male tauren druid.. I'm not a seven foot muscular anthropomorphic bull in real life, so I thought it'd be pretty sweet to play one.  I feel so strong and beefy when I play him!  Moo!
---
Though I'm not an IT person I've never known blizzard to do releases early so a few minutes seems to the most likely to me. Especially considering people ready the global release at a specific time, skipping queues by being on too early feels less likely. I have some friends that get or work a half hour before release. They'd be screwed if they opened up queues that early.
---
Grinder*
---
Donations is a thing
---
That is correct. Picking a server now isn't necessary, especially if server population is a factor to you which your OP seems to suggest. Just wait until you subscribe and pick then.
---
That's actually Spider-Man. Devil horns are done without thumbs.
---
CBA logging in at midnight, ill start early morning!

Jenkiest setup I have ever seen, don't sneeze ffs!
---
I heard him say it would be the cost of a sub on twitch ($5) multiple times when it got close to the classic wow launch so he didn't lie.
---
Better call Microsoft to see what's up!
---
I'd say it's a bullshit excuse that they used to play it safe. What, you like racism and gold farmers???
---
Just looking at a simple map with some icons on it is getting me so freaking pumped. Dont know how I'm gonna make it through the weekend

---
Yeah good luck with that
---
that's the catch, using joanas guide you won't hit 60 in 2 months :D
---
People are too cheap to pay 5$ for a guide someone poured hundreds of hours of work into, yet act like they're entitled to it? Lmao
---
Hot tip: if you want to use quotations in your response, make sure I actually typed it.
---
Why would you shorten pink to p and anus to a when its 2 in the pink 1 in the stink
---
My aim is to have 1 level 60 character after about 6 months, with maybe another (alt) at around 30-40 and a bank alt at 5.
---
With all classes in Bfa at 120 (3 left to go atm) :)
---
Stick with Questie, Azeroth auto pilot will just kill your experience
---
I do not blame him for trying to get compensated for his work. Personally  have no need for his guides its better to develop ones own leveling route based on the way they play in my opinion.
---
dafuq i swear it was cake day like a few months ago :O
---
Why not make a skeleton appear at a random location around the player thus preventing any words from being written.
---
Loving the cat climber, but you may regret that when you’re mid-pull on Ragnaros and they walk across the keyboard :)
---
Okay. And none of you had older siblings too?
---
I thought the same thing, so I named my toon 'Lola'. Now they can't be surprised when they find out I'm a guy.
---
you mean wait in queue ? :D
---
I'm just tired of people that think the game is frozen at 2007. And anything that came after 2007 is shit.
---
*Your guide wasn't made in 2006 ? then it's automatically shit.*
---
Doesn't matter how many months of work you put in it. How much testing. Working with the limited resources we had.
---
If you didn't happen to be around in 2006 then your work is shit and Joana is god.
---

&gt;RFC is going to be a wake-up call for Retail nublets!! Lots of packs that require delicate pulls + a few patrols.
---
I'd say this goes for almost all the timewalking instances that people know today, they are going to be a (in my vie pleasant) surprise for classic players :) Stratholme even more so.
---
I don't see why they couldn't just make it so that if an account gets banned or even if a character gets deleted or renamed or whatever then its corpse/skeles get removed.  You could do a lot of stuff here to make it more robust - eg: are there many corpses of different characters on the same account within close proximity to each other?  Remove all corpses on the account.... 
---
Surely stuff like this would solve the "people writing things with corpses" issue or at least make it MUCH harder to do without serious organisation with many different accounts.

As someone who prefers the levelling experience to end game I'm happy with this.
---
When I do get to max I'll know I've earned it.
---
I only stated playing in Burning Crusade so I'm looking forward to playing in the only part off the game I missed so I'm not bothered how long it takes me.
---
I've also only played Alliance so if I go Horde all the zones and quests etc will be new so I would rather take my time rather than rush through.
---
If you mean can’t wait to tear through Mulgore on my level 60 mage in 2 months while grinding rep for the Tauren mount, then yes.
---
Wash yer back
---
Definitely the World of Roguecraft series
---
Can you make it remember where you left off?
---
I wish Male characters on the horde side had better posture...
---
where do u find them?
---
the chines undead are in western clients too, you can activate them with config file.

---
changing how skeleton corpses work would actually require changing the code both server and client side.
---
&gt;A dungeon is a hallway filled with monsters meant to be blitzed through in less than 30 minutes tops
---
Welcome to BRD :)
---
HAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHA
---
&gt; Removing skeletons is pointless
---
Weird because your post opens with a quote where they explain the point of the change.
---
As many others have said, it's _multiple_ skeletons, not all skeletons. If an area has been decimated, you'll still see plenty of corpses. What you won't now see is multiple corpses because the same guy died over and over.
---
&gt; if it really is that big of a concern make it a bannable offense and follow through on it
---
Perhaps identifying the owner of a skeleton isn't as simple as that. Banning players for hate speech in chat is easy because right alongside the message is a convenient identifier for who did it. Finding out who is responsible for a hundred skeletons outside Orgrimmar an hour after they appeared might not be that easy.
---
I'm going to gank and corpsecamp all these newbies and trash retail pvpers and it is going to be great.  At rhe same time it will be sad though, as the skill level from pserver to classic will not even be close.
---
No, that is not the problem, that is the solution we as veterans need to tell them nicely and not: „too stupid to use google“. Maybe every guild should prepare some useful links to help them. 
---
Another point I would like to add:
---
Let them take part in the activities! I know it’s frustrating to tell them boss mechanics, skill trees and other things but if you want a growing community it’s necessary! Nothing is more frustrating to start a game and then find no one to play with you because you are new...
---
But then the person healing them is stuck there just as long. Albeit having a bit more fun.  
---
Also if you're a Pali - bubble/hearth.
---
What an dick move. Ill be trying Zygor. Looks awesome and with ingame addon. Talked in chat with then yesterday and got told 1-15 or 1-20 is free then $8 montly.
---
because not everyone is so casual that they care as much about the leveling process as you.  lots of people don't really feel like the game even begins until 60.  you play how you want and other people will play how they want.
---
Whatever fake nerd &gt;:( , but one retail job I had my boss played too he couldn't take launch day off cause he was management but I was just part time scum so I got to rub it in we were competitive with each other after transferring to the same server so it felt good to get a headstart  especially after I had to stay over last week and it cut into my wow time fuk u Brian
---
&gt; And there's Kargoz leveling guide which is free and easy to use. I don't even need to scroll or read as much. Check it out

It literally says "by Navak &amp; Egregious"... ?

Thanks me too

---
This is super useful, thank you!

Attunement to MC quests will get you in the door.

Being able to douse the runes will allow you to progress to the final bosses.

You know someone's new when they think DM means Diremaul, we didn't go back and change deadmines acronym just because Diremaul was added to the game, only noobs called Diremaul DM!
---
&gt; „too stupid to use google“
---
Again, what is with people and quoting shit I didn't say?
---
These videos will always be funny, but if they're about Classic they immediately become even better.
---
Thanks for clearing that up.

Hell Yeah! Tauren are the best! H Y P E!
---
Satisfaction
---
That is a weird hill to die on (figuratively speaking). They said why they aren't doing it and the reasons are super valid.
---
On stream, time and time again.
---
STV on phase 1 won't be as hardcore as other phases...i hope
---
Believe it or not but a lot of people actually have will power and havn't subbed yet.  Me being one of them.
---
they're waiting for 1 hour before release the slap that paywall on.  Checkmate Joana
---
During the stress test, my friend (the absolute madman) just put himself on follow to me and went to have dinner without saying a word. I tried so hard to dislodge him behind a fence so he wouldn’t soak my xp lol.
---
The population cap isn't changing once layers are gone. Layers are simply there to make the initial leveling less resource intensive for their servers and so it's more manageable to level as a player due to crowding.  
---
Making up #'s so it's easy to understand. Population cap with layers is 10k split 10 ways for 1k pop in each layer. Population cap after layers go away is still 10k all in the same constant world. They have specifically said they can use layers to allow many more people onto the server, but they aren't going to do that because  then you'd end up in a situation where you could have 30k pop in 30 layers of 1k each, but then once you remove layers you'd have way too many players on one server (even with people quitting).
---
I am so stoked to say that I have a rekindled love for WoW devs again. It cannot be stated enough how proud and happy I am to call myself a part of this piece of history. Thank you x1000000
---
The ama was great, but the skeleton thing is pretty annoying and it just seems it's for a terrible reason that could be solved in other ways.
---
Like honestly if blizz said "we cant do skeles because server resources" I'd have been more understanding.  But the reason they give is people spelling out shit with corpses?  That seems easily solvable with other measures like removing corpses of characters on the same account if they're within close proximity of each other, and/or having only level 20+ chars corpses be persistent etc.
---
Hard to tell, they said they are waiting to see how Classic pans out, however the impression I got was that Classic+ was a good possibility. (Where they keep developing Azeroth rather than leaving the origional lands)
---
The millennial lot would go wild with rage, cant see them removing some of the instant gratification features they've pined for, for so many years.
---
Eventually when Daggerspine went empty we all migrated to Kazzak if I can recollect correctly.

---
I also have paid vacation days, but would like to have a valid reason as my work is VERY strict and telling them "I'm playing wow classic" wouldnt cut it with them :( worse than gnomes..

This is honestly the best fucking Downfall meme I've seen in a LONG time.
---
&gt; If you play 20 hours/week
---
So you are saying you are looking for a casual guild m8?

Completely agree. I'm going to try to get on Shazzrah, but if the queues are out of control, I'm going to reroll.
---
Doesn't look like it, I've tried to find a way to save the progress, but this absolutely vital feature seems to be completely missing.
---
I have no opinion either way on his add-on being payed, but Blizzard do. All sections of all add-ons are required to be free. Even potential work arounds like the add-on technically being free but people pay for the data to populate the add-on banned.
---
Blizzard have enforced this several times. Of course the website is unrelated from Blizzards point if view and can be behind a paywall.
---
No I said dumb questions I too encounter this alot irl and games just saying consider maybe it's not a lazy person but a lonely one or something , what's a few minutes of your time to make someones day ? If you already consider it then good heh
---
No one cares. People been doing it for 20 years. You're not special. This is not special.
---
Actually you don't lose your spot immediately when you log off. The spot is yours for 5 minutes or something like that so that isn't a problem. Losing your internet or something however..
---
What's even the point if you can't save your progress to continue where you left off, the next day?
---
Yeah, sorry to disappoint you, but simply repeating something I already refuted as nonsensical, isn't hurting me, it only shows desperation on your part. Do yourself a favor and stop the self-humiliation.
---
The raids are expected to be easier than private servers so I expect they'll be fine if they managed it on private servers.
---
Not economically for the streamer, but it can show that people aren't as willing to pay for *only* his stream, but supporting him without it costing them anything extra feels okay.

Looks like they have removed the cross faction restriction (probably due to the Battle.net friends system). It is discussed in this thread: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/12439485483
---
However what's happening here is still clearly still a violation of the "griefing" rules:
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673
---
&gt; Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.

Tricking other players to waste their time by forcing them to make a long corpse walk or spirit res can easily be categorized as such.
---
Still better than the 12+ on his site I suppose. Honestly, that guide is so well known that a lot of people will be following it...and it's very similar to other guides out there...and the amount of people that will be on at launch, all the quests for the first week will be a clusterfuck anyway, better to just play the game imo, but to each their own
---
Shh, this post makes the ques longer. Downvote to oblivion

A majority of the questions aren't dumb, in fact I think most of them make sense. The problem, again, is the frequency in which they're asked repeatedly and the fact that there are websites devoted to the explanation of most of them.
---
Honestly, i wouldnt worry about the try hard virgins rolling on Gehennas, theres no way in 2019 that some guild/steamers through social media of some sort wont band together and make their life a misery for the sake of subs on their twitch or youtube channels.
---
oh!
---
Quick search gives conflicting results. 
---
WoWwiki says, tauren can use it. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Whistle_of_the_Black_War_Raptor_(Old_PvP)
---
According to wowhead, they can't. I guess we will have to see once it's in.
---
Devouring plague costed way too much mana
---
Solid advice, but let's not ruin his road to 60 within 3 weeks now.
---
Silithus in the guide is only 4 quests at the very end of the guide (level 59).
---
2 of them are simple "talk to this guy" quests.
---
It won't matter.
---
Cant decide between shaman and priest :(
---
Hello. First of all , ive never played WoW before and cant wait for classic =) I wanna start as a healer and im between making a dwarf priest or horde shaman. Which one do you think will have an easier time finding groups for raids ? ( more demanded class ) Also will I have problems farming gold at level 60 With these healer classes ? I am only interested in PvE. Thank you =)
---
Could you elaborate on that?
---
Most PvP servers seem to be slightly horde dominant (up to about 7%). Gehennas seems to be quite balanced judging from the discord due to some popular guilds on the alliance (alot of people don't seem to want to deal with apes).
---
You know that doing the low level quests after they are gray gives you a LOT less reputation ?
---
There's enough down tone to let you skip back to where you were. It only takes a minute. But yes that's one downside to this guide. As good as it is, it has one inconvenience.
---
Tauren Warrior Incoming. I dont give a s... if orcs have +5 axeskill.. tauren is life, mulgore is home &lt;3
---
&gt; It's also really nice to be able to heal, heal, and heal as needed.
---
FTFY.
---
The people who want it would be the million plus accounts that were made on private servers of Vanilla that stayed static for years and years, plus more who would play it but wouldn't play on something like a private server.
---
What a bunch of bullcrap. So what if i dont want to get killed in battlegrounds? They are intentionally detracting from my enjoyment of wrecking their faces!
---
Good job, thanks for making the queues even longer!
---
Snowflake?
---
Asmongold represent America in this situation.
---
God dam smurfs. GET RID OF THEM! IT SMELLS LIKE P EVALS ALL UP ON THIS POST!
---
That is true.  They were still very important for gold though.
---
There is another way to fix this issue, people can grow a thicker skin. Seeing a slur spelled out isn't the worst thing in the world, and anyone with a functioning brain understands that it's not Blizzard's fault.
---
&gt;Does anybody know if we're getting the original dungeon layouts back, or are we gonna get the new-style segmented "SM is 3 instances" ones?
---
They will be the original ones in layout and bosses. So SM will be 4 'wings"
---
For UBRS i think it will be 10 man rather then 15 but am not 100% sure (Scholo/Strat will be 5 mans as well i think instead of the 10 man)
---
I play 7 hours a day of retail wow already. Think I’ll be pretty quick then the usual player!
---
There was a bank in the wilderness volcano back in the day though
---
That's a shameful decision. Let people pay if they want to.
---
Say what?????
---
Because Beardruid feels strongly about a subject and has clearly done at least some research on it, you ignore them??
---
Sound logic, my friend, sound logic.
---
from what I remember it just flicked their camera around, but because they were holding run it would run them off the bridge
---
If it's not one of the ones that someone came up with years ago, it's not as good. Use what's there and stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
---
The least you could do if you with your discerning eyes and vanilla brain before "warning" others against using a guide is to actually take a few minutes to actually look at the contents of it first. You likely read the homepage and came to a quick conclusion. There are significant changes from Varrak's route that address xp differences. I've spent about 6-8 months on that.

I think this video covers most of it. And in response to the comment that there "was no vanilla design principles" ... that's just wrong. Their philosophy and the people making the game (calling the shots) changed drastically. This presentation is by Jeff Kaplan ... who is incredible and now running Overwatch (i.e., hasn't been on WoW for a while).
---
It's 16 minutes, but worth watching.

Yup you described me perfectly. I get a couple hours every day before my wife gets home and all day on Saturday. I'm ready for my relaxed delayed and fun leveling experience. I assume it will take me longer because I plan on doing professions and taking my time.
---
Hundreds? Lol
---
I think with the latest build they fixed it
---
[not needed, it's already out there](https://www.joanasworld.com/original-joana-v110.html#)

#notmywarcraft
---
&gt; Because Beardruid feels strongly about a subject and has clearly done at least some research on it
---
No, because their account exists only to troll about the topic. I wanted to inform them that I'm aware of what they do, and that I won't pay attention to what they have to say.
---
It's not flawed at all
---
Most of my content is on my twitch and discord.

---
I would be surprised if today's medium servers didn't have 5,000 person queues and Herod had 15K.

Freaking wish warriors had inner rage. Bloodrage is nice, but inner seems like it would give more
---
The post you replied learn acronyms to literally has the same word you think is an acronym, but is actually an abbreviation. (Learn to read before you throw shade)
---
Yes, but you need a full group of people to play with, at all times, only then it is more efficient. As soon as you switch around people, pull too slow, or wipe, lvling thorugh quests will be better.
---
I'm sick of work, can't make it in sorry.  
---
Bad case of no more fucks to give about work.
---
Evil. Pure evil.... But brilliant 😂
---
&gt;  Drain Life isn't really worth it while leveling  
---
Drain life tanking is one of the fastest specs to level a warlock. 
---
If you want to speedlevel you go improved imp for the first levels. Then at 27-30 you switch to drain tanking which becomes absolutley insane once you get to SM (level 34) and craft your shadow set at 40.
---
I think the point is you can abuse chat, just like you can abuse corpses. Getting rid of corpses doesn't solve the issue of advertising.

&gt;Mankirk &gt; Mankrik

Cap'kirk &gt; Mankirk &gt; Mankrik
---
Its mentioned in a "top 5 upcoming games"   
---
First mentioned is death stranding, second one is Classic WoW.  (Luigi's Mansion 3, Man of Medan, Star wars game)  
---
Roughly:   
---
She explains that its a "re-release" of the original version, and how many nostalgic players are going to get another chance to play it.   
---
Mentions how some have played illegal private servers to experience it.   
---
They ask if there's something new with it it, and she answers that Its supposed to be like the original, and thats "Its what the fans want".    
---
She also talked about google stadia, and how she hopes fortnite dies out, dota price pool.
---
It's just funny cause people shit on retail for many things including the loss of the rpg element, and on this sub people treat classic exactly the same way as retail, it's just really funny and ironic... "Omg I want an rpg --&gt; I'm gonna speed level cause I'm not a filthy casual" "I want talent trees to allow hybrids" "Hybrids can only get into a raid if they heal, fuck your meme builds"
---
Damn, this is an incredibly well done format for a leveling guide.
---
yea man that's totally the same thing
---
&gt;... Goldshire will be fine.
---
No it won't. Nuke furries from space! I don't care about collateral damage.
---
Alliance only.
---
They have an updater client that takes 5 seconds to use
---
Good to know, deleted my comment!
---
I wish xD
---
Is this really what people give a shit about? jfc
---
100% agree with you. Sadly most people on this subreddit are brainlets
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Are dudes actually upset that he wants money for his time and effort?
---
Maybe you were just a bad healer that got oom after every trash mob... Healers in this sub always act high and mighty blaming tanks and dds, but there are bad healers as well.
---
Good try - show me your source.....
---
p.s. you dont have it
---
i know, im saying vanilla WoW had it 10-mannable even after we had Tier 2 level gear and it only got set to 5 man because of Dungeon Set 2 content. 
---
Classic WoW is set to 1.12 but the content is being timegated so we will have to do 5-man scholo/strat with WAY worse gear than when it was changed on vanilla. we don't get Dungeon Set 2 until Phase 5 in Classic WoW. so that's when it should be restricted to 5-man. not at Phase 1.
---
You make a really good point. I think I was just reading it as major hyperbole, plus OP has misunderstood the change - they exist until you die a second time, not until you res. 
---
Again, great point. You got me haha.
---
They did say that TBC wouldnt be that hard to add.
---
"&lt;inaudible&gt; that was topical 2004 and 2006."
---
"Many nostalgic people wants to go back, they will be able to do that now."
---
"&lt;inaudible&gt; to play with. Some purchases had been illegal"
---
The last part was really hard to decipher. So I have no idea how illegal was relevant to the discussion. But I can clearly hear "köpen" and "olagliga" which translates to "purchases" and "illegal", maybe some other swede saw the show and have a better source.
---
wife could :S
---
These memes were all removed by Google and Facebook at some point like 4-5 years ago.
---
How do you know that their account exists only troll only the topic?
---
They don't come across as trolling...
---
Many believe that layering is the most important issue out there for Blizz to get right (and so, quite possibly the only thing with commenting on).
---
If you had said 'I recognise you as someone who always jumps into layering posts with crazy, unvalidated troll posts' - that would make sense.
---
But that wasn't what you said.
---
You just don't seem to want to listen to opposing views.
---
Clearly you have better things to do than commenting about it. Right?
---
I've always wanted a shaman, means I can heal in raids. Sign me up :D
---
Surely you mean it's going to take 3.5 days /played to reach 60.
---
Yes, and you donate if you want to show your gratitude
---
I have 100 coins from a gilding I got. You can have Reddit silver if they don’t get it. No need to pay me if I win. Idk how I could do a $5 wager without also attaching my identity to my Reddit username.
---
This subreddit never seizes to amaze me about what they get up in arms about.
---
It's so dumb using the term nochanges while also introducing changes.
---
How could I dare to set foot into r/neverbrokeabone again if my main mmo would be the one with weak/inferior skeletons.
---
Ignore the go outside asshat. You do you.
---
It was the only interesting question. The others were layering "again", and discussing the // in their old code. Aham.
---
Thats alot of news about gaming.
---
This morning I heard some stuff on the radio about "GTA and CoD = bad because ISIS used it in there promo videos"
---
So just the new age pc bullcrap.
---
Games are almost never mentioned here on TV.
---
Afk attacking the training dummy might work.
---
He charged for it in the past, it was easy to find a boot leg version tho. 12.75 a quarter seems like a reasonable price..... it’s not like he is extorting people for 50 bucks or something.
---
I hope you’ve got internet sorted!
---
If that won’t cut it with them, what will?
---
I got a Screenshot at home, I'll get back to you this evening if I don't forget it
---
I hope someone from Blizz will take the idea, this shit should be easy as a cake to implement.
---
Nope
---
I also took around 15 days /played for my original vanilla level 60. It was my first 60 and a warrior.
---
On a private server I got to 60 in around 10 days as a mage. The big difference was having a questing addon which saved a ton of time and not being a newbie. 
---
In my opinion if your aim is to reach 60 quickly (no exploring, no proffesions, etc), you have wow experience and you use a questing addon you should have no problem getting to 60 in under 10 days.
---
You didnt draw the dreamfoil nodes...
---
No you don't need to have retail installed. There is a separate install option for classic
---
Me too!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=retail+installed
---
It's gonna be ok dude , servers are like ogres
---
I would love one for undead too, if you find one please let me know. I'll be looking out for one too.
---
This was my approached too.
---
My manager called me in 
---
"I see you want to take some time off on the 27th, that is like the middle of the week, why is that?"
---
"Well ma'am, I'm really don't wanted you to know, but a game me and my friends played 15 years ago is being relaunched and we want to play together again...."
---
She started smiling 
---
"Won't it look and feel horrible to play a 15 year old game again?'
---
"No ma'am, they made some changes and kinda improved the graphics, so we all are very excited!"
---
"Will you be playing against other people, like in teams against other teams shooting each other?"
---
"Not really like that, more of getting stronger doing quest, to fight big bosses with all kinds of tricks up their sleeves!"
---
"Do you also have one of those nice gaming chairs?"
---
"No ma'am, just an ordinary office chair!"
---
"Well, you go and enjoy your game with your friends then!"
---
"Thank you ma'am!"
---
10 mins later I received an email saying " Your *leave* has been *approved*."
---
No, you just need the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Launcher to install WoW Classic
---
Blizzard can't control it.  Completely depends on the longevity of the game.  Classic is not a sprint it's a marathon that last for years.
---
I rerolled when 15 hours ago a new german realm opened and it's full already ^^
---
It's 2019.
---
Oh I can't wait to get back to the old days of Tauren Shaman.
---
The fastest way is to delete your orc and create a new tauren
---
Sad that private servers can handle more players than blizzard servers
---
It sucks, but ultimately it's a result of 3rd party and human behavior, and personally I am willing to sacrifice the skeleton mechanic to combat the gold selling.
---
Ty xD
---
Good story.
---
Bye !
---
I highly doubt that. Maybe after a couple hours but I want to be productive asap
---
You are a terrible person and I hope you get corpse-camped a lot!
---
I find it weird that you have to provide a reason to do something you have the right to do.
---
I’m not sure how you’d level without killing anything. I have no idea if you can get to level 10 by simply getting the exp that get from discovering zones.
---
As others have stated, randomize the corpse up to *x* meters when dying (as well as corpse orientation?). One might argue to make the randomization client side (same with corpse orientation?).
---
Characters below level *x* will not persist.
---
Put a limit per square of skeletons.
---
Make it a bannable offense.
---
The only real difference between this and the Downfall film is that for Hitler didn't have the silver lining of making an absolutely ridiculous amount of money for what is comparatively much less work.
---
10 days is not the average for anyone that knows what they're doing, you can cut 2-3 days off that just by following the most basic zone guide.
---
payed vacation !
---
Taking a sick day, is realy lame, dont fuck over your co-workers over a video game

I have a serious skin condition which prevents me from being in sunlight. Going outside is dangerous. Thanks for being so insensitive guy!
---
Someone snagged your name in the instant it was available? That’s incredibly unlucky. Maybe someone had a script running to try and snag the name?
---
How is it stealing lol a bunch of people have it saved on their hard drive when it was still free it's being freely circulated on a bunch of discords too now that he decided to paywall it
---
Not to mention he made a PROMISE to keep the guide free which probably earned him a bunch of subs on twitch from people who thought he was a good guy - hate to say this, but he got what was coming for him.
---
Can start farming Devilsaurs for leather, mining all the rich thorium for crystals, herbs for Black Lotus, etc.
---
 If you're a lock, you can farm uncontested for Felcloth (or if contested be 5-10 levels higher than the competition) for monies/Robes of the Void.
---
I genuinely think there's plenty to do post 60 if you're first in the server. Heck, skip all professions and when you hit 60 it'll take 4-5 hours tops (imo) to go back and power level them to farm the stuff above.
---
Only with the extremely entitled
---
Quests that have you deliver things or run somewhere etc. I think taking the tram back and forth between stormwind and ironforge starting zones would be quick enough
---
I want you to take the title you wrote and paste it into a google search and see if you couldn't find the answer within 30 seconds.
---
A ton of time and effort has gone into it. Its a bargain in my eyes. Some Crap FIFA game EA churn out costs you £50 and then if you want to play other parts, you buy magical non existent trading cards for like £10 a time. This guy has put a lot of effort in and the more £££ he makes out of it, the more likely he will do more useful stuff!
---
reminds me of a fairly new launched server in vanilla where I didn't want to queue again when sleeping so I got in to a tavern and taped up and right  so my character would endlessly run circles.
---
IMHO it would've worked but the server restarted at some point and everyone got disconnected...
---
Idk how it works now.. the "homer keyboard bird" would be my best bet if I were to be worried about getting dc'd
---
He said individuals leaving multiple skeletons will not happen, as it shouldn't. Each player can leave behind 1 skeleton, if they die again their old skeleton will despawn and a new one will be created.
---
This is exactly how it should be. Only 2 people fighting shouldn't be able to leave an area littered with skeletons. This way when you actually see 10+ skeletons around you know shit is *really* going down.
---
Dude has been accepting Patreon donations for fuckin' months, then paywalls the guides, nah bruh, fuck that.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
You can check [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buy7b6/results_from_my_110_fedex_run_during_yesterdays/) 
---
But if I have to judge from the stress test, it won't be necessary to do it. I was out of the level 6 area zone in 45 minutes and it was smooth sailing after that.
---
dozens of additional skeleton entities turning boss fights into clusterf-cks
---
yeah I won't miss them
---
Just read the quest text ya dogs.
---
Plus it's only when you die **multiple times in a row** that it will despawn your last skeleton. You'll still see plenty of skeletons in STV guys, don't worry.
---
Imma goon slap anybody that try’s to one out me.
---
One person dying over and over leaving 100 skeletons doesn't represent a huge amount of pvp.
---
Ugh, that title hurts my brain! Can someone translate? 
---
Not trying to be a dick, just genuinely don’t know what that says.
---
Hey my guy, i love that the guide supports group leveling.
---
You dont have an addon in the works right ?
---
Didnt you read the AMA....people might use corpses to make hate speech so it has to go!  GG Blizzard.
---
Former Talons and Illumination here, going to Mirage Raceway for a non-hardcore but structured approach to raiding (not really an RP-er myself although I enjoy the environment it creates)
---
We can make him apologize. 
---
1month after release we will see the true numbers of subscribers. Just turn “you think you do, but you don’t” into a meme-template. Done.
---
U should level with a pvp spec in general. This will help you with kiting and cc in open world.
---
No reason to optimize the character for pve/instance/raid before the cap and the endgame gear.
---
This line got me, god damn.
---
See that, kid? Thats what we call a savage
---
There are people stating that apparently in his streams Joana stated that the guides would be free. I have no way of confirming this, but that's just what I read on the other post that started this fire.
---
It’s insane how people let such small details affect their experience. 
---
And I’m not even thrilled about the change, honestly, but why are people allowing themselves to become so outraged about potentially not seeing as many skeletons as they otherwise would? It’s such a small detail that has next to no effect. 
---
With that said, if Blizzard changes the icon of the Keyring I will literally set myself on fire in protest.
---
You'll be fine as NE. The threat generated by warrior is negligible and if people are paying attention to their threat* and you're playing properly it shouldn't be an issue.
---
*LOL
---
he is a terrible person and I hope I can be his friend
---
I forgot mine lol
---
Skeletons aren't removed. Individuals leaving multiple skeletons is removed. Each person can only leave 1 skeleton. Die again, old skeleton goes away, new one is made.
---
Ashes. Long time no see. I remember so many guilds from back then. Ashes were one of them. Good to see another, what realm are you playing on? Alliance I guess? :)
---
Thanks for the great laugh mate, it was awesome :D
---
That's a whole new level of a-hole imo
---
Gear, realistically
---
Yeah. Screw ‘em with all these changes. Not playing this abomination of classic.
---
I don't know what it is but I've always absolutely hated Winterspring. By far my least favourite zone in the game.
---
Play what you want...none of the racials make or break a character at endgame...endgame, especially as a tank, your skill is going to be the deciding factor into whether or not you're a good tank.
---
Ditch Warrior from the not Blood elves and make their facials subpar or you will end up with 50% elves on alliance just like it is today with horde in retail.  Also stop with the "dual faction" race. Put Goblins into horde and find something different to add for alliance or don't bother at all. Pandas were a dumb idea for faction identity and Goblins for alliance and Horde would also be a detriment
---
True, but they will likely be somewhat reluctant/hesitant. TBC private servers have never managed to hold a stable population like Vanilla did. And although TBC was a good expansion, it did add a few mechanics Blizzard later regretted (flying etc). So in terms of future development, if I was in their shoes I would lean more along the side of Classic+. I guess time will tell.
---
60 hours work a week, father to a two year old, I’ll see you guys at 60 in about 2 years!
---
Those kinds of people will be the ones whinging once classic is out. How shit it is or how it's basically the same as live... Because they are playing the omg race to max level. I absolutely loved leveling during burning Crusade. Finding chests around the world and making skeleton keys to unlock them. Needing firewood for fires.. it felt like playing DnD.
---
Thanks for the reply! And while I do agree that a lot of people don’t notice everything, I doubt that 99% of people are THAT oblivious to things. Like, you’d definitely be able to tell the difference between an arena full of bodies and an empty one, right?
---
I just find it hard to believe - I’ve never been the top 1% for anything good xD
---
Thanks brother!
---
bro you gonna climb that shit?
---
Did anyone make a cheat sheet for lvl a Priest?
---
I watched many videos about lvl a priest and keep the rotation simple with your wand that you're mana efficienty.
---
Now that spell rotation will change when i get higher lvl i guess. 
---
Would be nice to see on which lvl which rotation is the best.
---
See you soon Home people!
---
Not viable if you want to be in the top 1%. Otherwise yes of course it is
---
Speaking of Warlock bugs, do you (or anyone else!) remember how to do the perma-enslave trick in Felwood? The process as I remember it was to enslave a demon of some kind, then engage one of the Jadefire Tricksters west-southwest of the furbolg tunnel and hope it used its MC ability on you. If it did, when your enslaved demon eventually broke free it would bug out and remain friendly then just keep following you around (without any pet UI) until you died or zoned. You could even summon another pet at the same time.
---
I've tried to recreate it but it's not working, and I'm not sure if it's because I'm forgetting a step or if it was patched before 1.12.
---
There's a simple answer to that question and you already answered it yourself. You would prefer it, so do it. It's as simple as that my friend.
---
The focus on WoW: Classic is really the open world itself. Little things like seeing a ton of skeletons all over is just a tiny bit of many other details which added effect and life (or should I say death) to that world. 
---
Doesn’t personally matter to me, but I can understand why someone would want this back. The reasoning for the omission is what is irking people the most, too.
---
Just get a group of 5 and go just outside the starting area and grind.
---
&gt; We’ll be following the Classic community closely to help determine what our next steps should be.
---
So, nothing is confirmed.  
---
They'll monitor the community, that is confirmed... nothing else
---
upvoted, thanks I might use this
---
for goldsellers advertising their webpages ?
---
Not currently. We’re currently working on mobile support along with place saving, navigation and multiple profiles. We’re hoping to be able to push updates often and add to the feature list over time which would likely require significant overhauls of an add on. We like it where it is now but will see where the future takes us.
---
This guide is great but is missing some key features. It doesnt save your progress and the pickup quest text is not in a different color then the rest which makes it tedious to read. Otherwise great guide. Wish this would be ported to guidelime.
---
Even a gnome tank is viable, race is not that crucial.
---
It's not even actively grinding. it's mostly just being on that server's premade list for who is gonna be the next one to get rank 14. I believe that is still possible even with cross-realm BGs simply because kills can be funneled into a single person and the only competition is maybe gonna be a seperate rank 14 list.
---
That wasnt even a rule in 2004/2005. The server language is what language support will be given in.
---
It's most important because they claimed "No changes" yet gave a silly "omgz people might make hate speech with skeletons" excuse for why it wouldn't be in the game...it was weak and really business oriented when Classic is supposed to be all about the players.
---
Are you telling me 1 person leaving 20 skeletons is immersive?
---
If there's a big battle between lots of people there will still be lots of skeletons.
---

What up? We're a bunch of cool Dwarves and Gnomes who are looking for other cool Members of the Alliance who want to hang out in our party mansion. Nothing elvish. Dwarves in good shape encouraged. If you're human, you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, nothing elvish." Druids okay so long as you spend as little time as an elf as possible. Bears and Trees are practically Dwarves. Elves are not
---
We're looking to maintain a chill social atmosphere with semi-casual endgame content. Mostly focused on building a chill and enjoyable community to be a part of, who help each other out and get a good name on the server for ourselves. Raiding for fun and progressing as a group rather than min-maxing every last detail. We won't make you play something you don't want to, or push you to raid 5 nights a week, but when you do turn up we expect you to be prepared, present and focused.

This subreddit should have bots that index the same questions and automatically responds to threads that contain the same question with links to the previous posts that have a 70%+ match relevance. I've seen it in the Twitch reddit.
---
Is this how you normally articulate your points?
---
I'm going to imagine that's you trying to make a joke. Obviously it just doesn't apply, I'm not caring about the shapes being made at all, what I do dislike is a pointless modification to a game based on people being incredibly fragile.
---
It's actually paramount to debate the degree to which entertainment is curbed by people's sensitivities.
---
Do you plan on being the main tank for a bleeding edge progression guild? In that case the answer is "No, NE not viable". 
---
In every other case, the anser is "play what you want, it's a game".
---
wtf....so awesome.
---
blizz should give him a free subrciption for at least some weeks. this shit costs lots of money in RL
---
There will always be elitists. *Always.* There's nothing you can do to stop them from existing. The only control you have is to not interact with those players.
---
They will be getting sleep; they only said that total coverage will be 24/7 because they've got so many overlapping streamers and hosts.
---
Can you link me to a serious post that said that the skeleton change will ruin the game?
---
as a responsible adult I will be sleeping and play wow when I return from work after 5 pm ;-;
---
Dont suppose you could give me a road name so I can Streetview it to see for myself?
---
Thanks from one Tauren to another.
---
Thanks that's a good start of what I was looking for
---
Racials are only important if you want to be part of the first/second week cleared crowd. But if you were part of that crowd you wouldn't even ask that question in the first place and just play human warrior. I'm playing dwarf warrior solely for the reason that I can call nelfs knifeears and have a Makro that yells "FOR KHAZ MODAN!" everytime I activate stoneform.
---
I love that extra half-hour during each gouge
---
&gt;There are people stating that apparently in his streams Joana stated that the guides would be free
---
That's a bummer, however $12ish isn't that unreasonable. I'll probably pick up one to use as a reference.
---
Still lame if that's the case.
---
I'm not. Just going to do my quests without a care in the world and casually greeting the other faction... Because I'll be on a PvE server
---
Is there an ally version too?
---
If you can get venomstrike from wc, do it, its a great weapon, free and anyway you have plenty of quest in wc worth the time, and the proc is very good
---
I don't think it makes sense to talk about which game is 'better'. 
---
Some people prefer TBC but it's far from the same game that Vanilla is.
---
Is Imp Drain Soul really worth it at all? Your dmg has to be the one to land the killing blow, so a not insignificant portion procs will be stolen by your demon. And Imp. Life Tap just seems to be all you need to keep on grinding with no downtime. I never dug the talent for Drain Soul all that much.
---
trading time 1 for 1 is not efficient griefing
---
According to Mike Preach it is more of a celebration of the return of classic, as well as Method's GM being a bit tongue and cheek about beating private server guilds a few months ago. I feel like they don't mind losing this race.
---
I disagree
---
Has this been tested with actual classic values, and not private server values that are incorrect? I'd love to use it but if I use it and end up suddenly lacking a lot of xp in different places, that'd be annoying : (
---
I’ve seen you comment a couple times in this thread and I can assume your position on the matter just by seeing your name lol. I’d like to ask a few questions though. Isn’t it annoying to have to do what is supposed to be a 10min quest and have it turn into a 30min+ quest? Also, what if you don’t have friends/clan mates to play with? That ties into my last point because I doubt I could do any team or even solo related PvP stuff since I don’t know how it works at all. I feel like I’d just get dumpstered. Also, can you change your realm or is it whichever you pick, you stay with until you make another character on another realm? Thanks
---
This guide UI is horrible
---
I miss X-Play :(
---
I still piss myself at Leroy Jenkins, was gutted though when I found out it was staged
---
People worry about racials way too much. Unless you are playing as the top 0.1 percent in PvE it won't matter.
---
Pff Horde here. What is deadmines?  Sound like something stupid alliance stuff ;) 
---
DM east, west and north OH yeah!
---
Hi me again, just figured I would poke you today as the worst kept secret is finally out of the bag. With method deciding that they want to dominate classic too.
---
I do not think you can comapre pservers to classic here, as the pserver crowd is limited in comparison to what people will play classic. A whole rerun of the raiding scene through the expansions would be awesome.
---
Discord doesnt reflect if a realm is "better"
---
skeletons are still in the game. did you only read the misleading headline?
---
But you don't know how long it will take to get to the character selection screen.
---
There might be loooong queues before the last 30 minutes to get in to the servers (as you have make it past the log in queue to get to the character selection).
---
And will there be a grace period?
---
This is awesome! Thank you very very much.
---
where is the proof, of your 29-30 window ?
---
That is just your speculation
---
I have a very simple solution to the problem.
---
When a skeleton is spawned just have it spawn randomly in a smallish circle centered on where it should be.  The remnants of big fights are preserved but it would be impossible to write with.
---
You guys ever heard about meth?
---
If I can't hear *need more rage* 20 times a minute I aint happy.
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
I think this, if anything, proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that yes, yes we fucking do dammit :p Gosh that quote is just so out of touch it boggles the mind.
---
Im leveling alliance with friends, and im gonna miss horde starting zones..
---
The problem is that since Blizzard doesn’t have a closed AppStore for addons they can’t do anything about it.
---
So yes while it’s against the TOS it’s not enforceable, and it’s not against the TOS to pay for addons as a player.
---
If they’ll change the TOS and make those addons a banable offense they might be able to hurt the monetization but it also would result in a very harmful collateral damage which means it ain’t going to work.
---
And at this point Blizzard won’t be making an App Store for Addons as that ship has sailed.
---
#noskeletons

I got my troll rep from the Blood Elves with the broken animations on the northern prong.
---
It's true I didn't progress much. I didn't like the game, after all :). 
---
I hope that Classic stays Classic instead of progressing through expansions. I'm not against TBC servers but I like how the Vanilla pservers allowed for starting over again with new fresh launches.
---
Firemaw 100%
---
Thanks for link
---
Here's my version.
---
Step 1 of 2: Reroll alliance (the better faction)
---
Step 2 of 2: Level 1-60 and never look back.
---
It's $5 for a month. If people don't want to pay for 2 months or more just do the decent thing of paying the $5 entry fee and then screen capping all the parts that you think you'll need. The guide will be pirated to a free floating PDF anyways so if you're gonna be a cheapass there's an option.
---
I'll probably pay for a few months myself. I liked the guide on stream and I would like a repeatable guide to serve as a reference point. I may use it heavily for the first ~25 levels to see if I can get ahead of the gaggle of tards, even if it's just a little bit of breathing room.
---
No one is denying that but after playing on the Closed Beta I can say that most Tanks are in for a rude awakening as they were constantly pulling without giving a shit about the mana of their Healer or that one of the adds decided to break off and gnaw on someone that wasn't the Tank.
---
And going oom after every trash group is entirely possible if
---
1. The DPS is absolutely horrendous
---
2. The Tank is badly equipped and needs a lot of healing due to him overpulling.
---
Combine those two and you are in for a bad time.

At least now the complaints have died down for BFA. Fall of last year was the worst time, especially on /r/wow because there was just **blind** hate for **everything** in the game.

While there were a lot of legitimate arguements I agree with, most of the complaints were just passive aggressive memes and other shit based around rumors with people having no interest in proper discussios but rather continuing the shitty circle jerk.

Yea
---
Ofcourse. Imagine you're level 50 and want to continue with the guide, what do you do? You start from scratch, chosing your faction, race, class, then spam click your way Next Next Next Next for minutes until you reach a zone that resembles as something near lvl 50 (because it doesn't even display the approximate level in the guide). I mean, who even thought this would be ok to make a guide where you can't save the progress or copy the direct link to the specific step you progressed to.
---
This is awesome
---
Eh, I thought so. It was too strange for gear of that sort to be bop and to be the only available
---
I hate posts like this.   It doesn't matter dude, don't be some sweaty minimaxer.  The racial abilities are not what makes your class "viable" every class in the game is viable.

Really drew out the ignorant masses with that one.  lol

Yes, several guides I've seen to do the same in regards to dying and setting HS or collecting FPs when you're reasonably near them. This might be the only guide to be adjusted for group leveling (not even sure how that actually changes the guide). However, not being able to save or copy the direct link to your progress is really really bad. Even more when you plan to level as a group. So say you're all at lvl 50, in the morning you decide to continue leveling at lvl 50 - you need to start from scratch on the website, chose your faction, class, race, number of players, then click like mad on the Next page of the guide for 10 minutes until you eventually reach a zone you're familiar with (the guide doesn't even display the level). Hopefuly they fix this before Classic release.
---
Your tastes are fucking bang on mate.
---
Sure, but it at least showed hotzones or a "clue" that the area might be dangerous.  Now we only get 1?  That's a ridiculously low amount.
---
I honestly been playing Warcraft 3 on and off since I was 12 (26 now). I been playing is a lot now lately and watching YouTube videos talking to buddies in discord about classic
---
Here is a little information about me and my healer main self. 
---
Realms:
---
* Bloodsail Buccaneers (Alliance)
---
* Thalnos (Horde)
---
* Dedicated Healer
---
* Looking for more to come join me and my squad of hoodlums
---
* Will be streaming WoW Classic consistently on my gaming channel
---
* I will be RPing a tavern keep on Bloodsail Bucs on a Gnome
---
This title is misleading. They just said one skeleton per character.
---
I think this comment put it best. I do have a habbit of overthinking things.  
---
Thanks for your input everyone. See you on launch day!
---
It's not misleading, it's completely correct.  The outcome is exactly equivalent to having a single 8.7% chance roll.
---
 Going Troll, but I will start in the Tauren zone because I think I'm going to be crazy and grind cloth for a Kodo at 60. (Not 40)
---
Nm chilin hbu
---
Rekt
---
Hahaha, we finally found it!
---
Agreed. Just means most people will be using a different leveling guide. Plenty of alternatives out there. Unless they all decide to follow in Joanas footsteps and do the same with a paywall just because they can.
---
Spamming chats to set up groups or find replacements, actually having to physically go to the entrance of the dungeon, barely any quests inside dungeons, no bonus exp for finishing.
---
Dungeon leveling isn't the same as it is in retail.
---
Yea, some people use arctium for modding, THAT changes game files. Changing a property in your WTF config is not breaking EULA. The portal is set to localhost, where the sandbox world is running.
---
I'm sorry if I was unclear or misguided someone, I was merely trying to provide tools to achieve such a setup.
---
I would prefer it if the skeletons where how they where, and the reason for not having them is bollocks IMO ( Oh noes hate speech someone may see a mean word oh noes !) But its not a huge issue. I would rather they get rid of cross server BGs, or at the very least link 1 or 2 servers in a battle group.
---
I'm not sure what you're after. You get DCed after 30 minutes in character screen as stated, and you can try it yourself if you want the proof, I'm not stating anything other than that. What this tells us is you want to time your login attempt so that you're not idle in character select screen for more than 30 minutes as this will disconnect you. So I'm gonna try and estimate so my login queue is finished somewhere between 23:35-00:00.
---
Yeah if you want to be stuck in the login queue.

Mine was Staff of Jordan dropped by a yeti in that cave in Hillsbrad. No drop since has been as exciting.

Google sixty upgrades , make your char , select phase, select item source
---
Just in case you're not a trolling I'll answer.
---
There is no RBG in classic. You won't have a MMR or any comforting number. Your skill and attitude will decide which premade you make in and how you do against other prems.
---
In most wow realms/battlegroups in 2005/2006 Horde usually had the best pugs and the largest numbers of decent pvp players - my experience in private servers is limited but it seemed to be the case there too. Which made alliance the most attractive faction for the pvp elite (faster queues, more interesting games). The bg map advantage is barely relevant and so are the racials.
---
Also your experience and "achievements" in retail won't mean shit in classic. It's a whole different game. Come humble if you don't want to ragequit before reaching 60.

Man mulgore is so big and slow to get around.
---
No, It means I'm too busy over-healing you and blew all my mana making sure you're green across the board.
---
So I can't decide how I want to move forward.  I really want to tank, but in terms of original classes, Paladin is the only class I enjoyed tanking with, but I play Horde.  I never really tried Warrior at higher levels (think my highest was 52 over the entire time I played), and I couldn't get into Druids at all.  Any suggestions on a remedy idea?  Especially with how long classic took to level.  I don't want to get stuck playing a character for a long time just to find out I won't enjoy playing it at higher levels.
---
My original main was a mage, but I'm not sure if  I want to go that route again or use this opportunity to play something new.  I'm not sure I'll enjoy classic mage after being Arcane for so long, but I know I don't like Warlocks at all, so I'm not sure what else I should bother trying.
---
It won't be STVietnam if I finish leveling there before most people even enter the zone.

I've noticed that if I refrain from topping off the tank after a large pull, they usually aren't in a rush to engage the next pack. If you're oom, start drinking, and hopefully they'll eat/self heal. If not, let them learn.
---
That's quite a commitment to fail.
---
I had no issues finding groups as a rogue in Vanilla. Make sure you level your Lockpicking, you will get groups *just* for having high lock picking some times at 60 for a few dungeons that can be lock picked or you need the quest key.
---
To be honest pug raids were pretty rare back in vanilla, at least on my server. I think you will have a bad time if you expect to be able to raid regularly without being in an organised guild.
---
Do the skeletons just not despawn ever or what's going on?
---
Yeah, man has a right to try to make a living the way he thinks is best. The internet is full of entitled teenagers that will rip him for it, but in the end it's his content and I don't mind paying five bucks for launch month if I decide to use it.
---
1 hour of classic a day means turtle progress. Retail is way better in that aspect
---
There are cleaners in the city, they take care of floors. Nobody will allow heaps of skeletons before the royal throne.
---
That's odd of them.
---
I remember a Wotlk Addon called Carbonite. It was a revolutionary map and questing addon. But you had to pay to get it. Plus the addon's code itself is encrypted so you couldn't copy anything of it.
---
That's when Blizzard updated their addons policy to include:
---
* AddOns must be free of charge.
---

I wasn’t lucky enough to get in the beta, and was too young and poor to play classic. Thus, making it hard for me specifically being able to recall the lack of skeletons hehe.
---
Ooh yeah I definitely see your point, although, maybe it wasn’t a mainstream/popular question, but it seems enough people knew about it for it to get noticed in the AMA?
---
Meanwhile pally tanks need 4 gallons of water for one trash pull
---
Thanks!
---
Don't get me wrong, I disagree what Joana has done but why do you feel so privileged that you think you deserve to have this for free IF he wants to charge for it?  
---
It is his text, his work, he can do with it what he likes.  As I said, I don't agree but it's up to him.

---
No one knows for certain. What we do know, however, is the limitations they can be pushed to now based off of the initial release and with better technology hopefully it allows for better handling of the situation.
---
I'll say to you what i've told another person. By critically thinking who do you imagine is capable of both earning 1k gold and not realize destiny is not worth that amount of money? gold buyers exempt from this.
---
Think it’s very unfair to say “lazy blizzard” after everything we have coming with classic wow.
---
Looks good, but sad to see it doesn't include maps.
---
This is so true... and people still seem to think that P1/P2 are only going to last a month or two each because of a 'lack of content' in them.
---
Oh dude, I am on that same energy right now too. Making sure everything is spotless, a little meal prep, stock up on waters, getting the stream setup for WoW Classic has been consuming some time too but I am not worried about that because honestly stream will be so saturated at first, I'll just be streaming to catch clips for a while. lol oh yeah and getting killed by people in PVP on ARK has been up there on my list of things to do while I wait for WoW Classsic.
---
Yeah can pretty much count out the night before too won't be able to rest , and I'm in the same boat every current server will have more than enough people on it tho  , faction imbalance might be a little off but even the new ones will have the last minute subbers and stuff or people not wanting to wait hours in queues so you're good on that one
---
IT’S TOOO FARR AWAEE
---
Know the ally link by chance?
---
WoW I like it!
---
They already said they're not going to fix them.
---
believe you would want to find any part of the TOS discussing gold trade on seperate servers.
---
I'm not familar with current TOS but I suspect 2 indiviuals arranging the trade wont suffer any penalty and I suspect that if one individuals scams the other they also wont suffer any penalty. recipe for disaster if it becomes commonplace. Hopefully the TOS does address this I'd hate to see the server economy turn on its head by a guild or individuals using RMT to manipulate markets.
---
If you avoid it completely, the risk is you'll lose so much XP that the ones who did it will reach 60 before you.
---
And a lot of 60s will be camping in STV anyways, at least for the Gurubashi chest.
---
Can you send in Pm?
---
It's a shame they aren't keeping new graphics instead of old ones
---
Also went hard in starcraft 2 if anyone remember, before the poker craze.
---
Do you know if legions/bfa releases good and stable?
---
&gt; again. I'd love it if we could just "Earn" skills through quests - like vanilla did and just keep everyone at level 60, or at most 65.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; With a really nice ilvl crunch, gaining power can be through smaller gear upgrades, not levels (therefore forcing reduced damage, levels increases dodges and resists, etc.) C'thun could still be a good fight at 65, if ilvls weren't blown out of scale.
---
I totally agree. Altough I also love TBC, I prefer to see new content for classic instead on moving on to TBC.
---
If you read the AMA layering was bugged in the stress test and the delay for switching layers was on for too long. This won’t happen on release
---
We would do similiar shit in BC. We'd go to Nagrand flying Islands and position the summoning portal so that it would summon you midair and would invite people and randomly summon them to their deaths.
---
Thinking about playing a caster (mage/warlock) horde. I have never played a caster before and I play on 250 ping. I have always played melee classes in all the mmorpgs. This is going to be the only character I'll be focusing on so I want something that would be perfect in the long run. Also I'm wondering how shamans would be. Thanks in advance.
---
No, I'd quit when Cata launched
---
World first of Method is by players that in great numbers arent IN method. Its private server/streamers that will be gathered in a event. 
---
&gt; The fully interactive 24-hour coverage on twitch.tv/method and twitch.tv/WSOE will feature a mix of world-class speed levelers and content experts from the Classic WoW community, as well as some of the top WoW streamers on Twitch racing to achieve notable “firsts” in Classic WoW, to be released at 23:00/11pm BST on Monday 26 August.
---
They are just milking twitch and sponsor money. They are "highlighting" other peoples efforts mostly. 
---
And tbh "world first" can be decided by something as lame as server selection and queues. If half of your MC week 1 roster sits 5 hours in queue, have to levelup with the masses it can really fuck you up.
---
I started in 2005. Never noticed an issue with the abbreviations. By the time your leveled enough for Dire Maul you're not interested at all in Deadmines. Also, Dire Maul was always announced with a qualifier: "North, East, West, Tribute, ...". Deadmines wasn't.
---
Wow, good luck clicking to 53 tbh, that's gonna take a looong time.
---
Its the timing, this guide has been free since it came out and then days before the game releases with no notice he puts the pay wall on it. If he announced an updated and better formatted guide that was paid no one would care, this just feels deceptive.
---
Its completely fair he wants to make money off his work, but he could have handled this a lot better.
---
I mean why would you need to spell shit out with skeletons if you're not doing something stupid like selling gold
---
Join me and I will never hassle you about only putting in 10 hours a week and we'll help you gear out once you're capped  :D I got love for my peoples.
---
Damn it. Go to Shazzrah. I’m trying to gather as many as I can. :p
---
I have my fingers crossed on class features.  I'm legitimately 100% happy playing classic WoW in terms of dungeons and locations, but I'm really going to have a hard time adjusting to losing certain spells that were added in expansions, or talents when the trees were originally expanded.  If I was given Arcane Blast and nothing else, I'd be happy.
---
Only other thing I'll have a hard adjustment for is Blood Elf (just so I can play a Horde Paladin).
---
Hate speech in Blizzards eyes is when you say anything not pc. They can’t make good games anymore. Classic was great, it will be worse now and when the hype is down what do they have left, all their games are dying.
---
So do vanilla flight paths...

That only takes 2-4 hours depending on how fast you are.
---
I know people are all no changes but do you still live in 2004? 
---
But nowadays we have lots of options besides credit cards.
---
Plus all the other little Vanilla quirks! My Hunter experience in the stress test-
---
- Made a Tauren, but wanted bows instead of guns
---
- Bow trainer is in Org
---
- Had the foresight to mail myself the learning fee from an earlier character ;)
---
- Made the trek to Org
---
- Remembered mail takes an hour
---
- Waited
---
- Learned bows
---
- Hearthed back to Bloodhoof
---
- Realised I don't have a bow
---
- No bowyer in Bloodhoof
---
- Ran to Thunderbluff
---
- Bowyer in Thunderbluff's most newb-friendly bow requires Lv11
---
- Started the trek to Org AGAIN because I didn't get the FP the first time
---
- Found a newb bow in Razor Hill
---
- Flew back to Thunderbluff
---
- Ran to Bloodhoof
---
- Bought arrows
---
- Tauren ammo pouch doesn't hold arrows
---
- Log out and delete Hunter
---
I know right? The whole point of classic was to actually enjoy the content, not following blindly someone else's route. You can still be efficient on your own with the quest helper add on if you don't wanna read quest text.
---
\+1, the game its actually fantastic, im impressed, it still need some work, but overall, the game is really good, fun, and challenging.
---
Nah, world PvP is one of the things people love, especially in STV. So while what you say is true regarding speed levelers, most people are still gonna gank anything they can there, just how it used to be in 2005.
---
All the morons in this thread who are defending this decision, for one.
---
Can you add a source where he said that his guides will ALWAYS be free?
---
That is exactly what a person who didnt play vanilla would say.
---
or pay or read another guy?  Like it or not, he wants to charge for HIS work.
---
Oooouuuuu getting all lored out before the launch. You're drowning your immersion in more immersion. You're mad!! lol
---
As others have said, this is the old guide which is tremendously worse than the current one. So yeah, use this and be slow if you like.
---
Anyone paying for Zygor is mental, you can download it from a tonne of places for free.

---
This is a repost, sorry.
---
Do you know how to code it?
---
It's probably Warlock/Druid. Warlock always felt super clunky to me, like an annoying mage. While Druid has such a high skill cap and usually is just not worth the hassle, feels super unrewarding.
---
Pointless change? I don't think so.
---
After wod they have been pretty solid on launch days , should be good if anything maybe some hours delays
---
10 days played is way long, 8 is very very doable on most classes if you are focused at all.
---
They said on Discord that they are working on a solution for this ASAP. 
---
Just a guide-menu on the side or something would help a lot IMO, so you could remember at what section you left and navigate there fast. Clicking all the way to level 55 is insane..
---
Lol, this is absolutely not fine.
---
There is none, this is the OLD outdated guide.
---
To answer your question about recent expansions - they have been very clean releases.
---
WOD was a nightmare because everyone was bottlenecked into garrisons at the same time for questing.
---
Since then, they've added phasing and better server management and Legion and BOD were really easy releases even with a global release date.
---
Phasing won't be in Classic, but the layering sytem should help alleviate the starting zones and bigger issues during phase 1. I think people will be largely surprised at how smooth this launch will be (not counting queue times for those not in the initial logins).
---
I'm optimistic that there won't be server crashes or insane server lag except for maybe at the very very start.
---
It'll possibly take me 6 months to get to 60 and I'm okay with that. Life comes first.
---
Sorry, I actually want to play the game at launch :P
---
I have some vague recollection of one of the people who actually worked on the movie saying in an interview after the parodies blew up back then that he would watch them and found a lot of them really funny. 
---
Suppose it was cathartic after working with such serious subject matter for the length of a movie production.

You're going to get spammed with gold seller whispers constantly anyways.

Also this change doesn't remove the ability to spell out advertisements with corpses.

That's why it's stupid.

you can download the latest version here. did a bit more work on making it smaller and add some stat weights for the classes my mates and I will be playing.

Pretty sure that pic is photoshopped anyway. You could get skeletons in the air but you'd have to go out of your way to pile them up neatly like that.
---
That’s just a stupid reason.
---
boring
---
Holy shit the classicwow.live thing is perfect! I haven't heard of it before, thanks for linking it!!!
---
I stopped playing probably more than a decade ago, but I was a human warrior and maybe at lvl 30 I found an axe that would have the ability to double strike sometimes. Then I found a second one! I dual wielded them in BG and kicked ass, then I remember a trinket that would also have the ability to allow you an extra attack but with less chance.
---
It was an insane shredder, sometimes you hit the enemy twice and it ends up being hit 5 times for the time of two
---
The combined players that intend to stay ahead of the curve will generate a pretty big curve themselves.
---
I resubscribed for the end of the stress test and reserved some names after not subscribing for years. I am still not motivated to play retail. I didn't even bother to load my old character and don't plan too. I here only for classic.
---
If you are talking about maximizing your in-game experience then you should start a few days after launch.
---
If you want to possible experience something that is wild and unpredictable where the HYPE-meter goes crazy then you should be ready at launch.
---
IDEA: Buy a regular office chair w/ castors, tie it to the desk. Turn on treadmill. Now you can 'walk' whilst sitting down, everybody wins.
---
Not sure why this is an issue really, its a small price to pay for not having goldsellers spell out their sites in corpses in Org.  Chill out, this isn't taking us down any path.
---
Anyone has a list for mages?
---
just so you guys know, im gonna gank the heck out of all of you so you cant turbolevel through classic
---
The rogue just witnessed a murder
---
&gt; It's probably something like EntityClass.translate(Vector v)
---
Or it's potato. Or maybe fdjksklgjsrekgerlgk. How exactly do you know?
---
Please just mess things up. You'll learn fast enough. It's part of the fun.
---
Going to try to convert this to guidelime format.
---
10 man 20 minute run is better than 45-60 minute 5 man run.
---
There's only one thing that's keeping me from questioning your sanity: dwarven priest.
---
Who the fuck even needs these guides? Just enjoy the leveling experience we've all been longing for.
---
!remindMe five days
---
just report and move on... blizz should ban them... if someone wants to type that with corpses he can type it in game too... just cos 0.001% of players can be toxic is a bad reason to ruin fun for everyone else... they could also make skeletons not expire for like level 30+ characters to make it close to impossible....
---
If I'm going to look at the same ass for months on end I will make sure it's female.
---
I don’t like horde and I don’t like Tauren. 
---
But I guess you guys get the same feeling there that I get in Elwynn Forest. 
---
Respect to you.
---
That's true. Release day is apart of the experience
---
Why not Just...sit?
---
It's not annoying to me if it takes a bit longer to complete a quest because I find the pvp to be more exciting anyway. Imo on a pvp server pvp supercedes pve. Pvp is the focus. Always being on edge sort of brings the world to life.
---
Not having friends at the start can certainly put a damper on things initially. But these situations are exactly what spur people to group up and make vanilla so much more social. You actually benefit from partying up and joining a guild. You'll experience this heavily in Stranglethorn Vale (affectionately know as STVietnam). It's a blood bath, but you'll notice that it's nearly always spoken of fondly. It's a bit too much for some people, but you can avoid it by leveling in other zones.
---
As a brand new player you will get dumpstered initially. This will have the benefit of causing you to improve more rapidly. Also, vanilla wow pvp is fairly simplistic despite its intricacies. As long as it takes to level a character you'll learn you class well and the learning curve won't really feel steep as a result.
---
Personally I'm avoiding the streamer servers. Just roll on one of the recently released servers and you won't have to deal with them. 
---
On pve realms you have to manually flag yourself for pvp. Unfortunately, this means you almost always get jumped instead of doing the jumping if you leave yourself pvp enabled. Should someone fancy killing you they'll wait to enable themselves until you're at a disadvantage and then pounce. People hardly ever flag themselves. The major exception will be during phase 2 when the honor system is implemented but battlegrounds aren't yet released. World pvp will be the only way to get honor during this time.
---
The consequence of dying is spirit running to your corpse. The suckiness of this depends on how far away you are from the graveyard. You dont lose gear, items, or xp. Slight armor durability loss if an npc gets the killing blow on you. But gear can be repaired at a low cost.
---
You can have multiple characters on multiple realms. But each character stays in the realm on which it was created.
---
Torn between Druid, Rogue, and Warlock.
---
Played a hunter from day one in vanilla and always really loved it. Huge fan of battlegrounds and not sure what to roll this time.
---
Druid class fantasy seems cool to me and it’s one of the classes I never really played in vanilla. I like healing but wouldn’t miss not doing it and always respected a druids flag running capabilities. 
---
As a hunter I always wished I could stealth and was a big dueler. I like mages and never really played a lock, so I am very interested in both lock and rogue so I can be more of a heavy hitter and hold me own solo.
---
My need to have it all seems to be pushing me toward Druid but I’m so torn.
---
I find subscription to be a wierd model for something like a guide especially like it's now when you can just save the web page. I think many would gladly pay 20-40$ for his guide rather than paying 5$ for a month copy pasting and canceling subscription.
---
I think details is exactly what made vanilla great. The devil is the details after all.
---
And when you change a detail after detail soon you'll find yourself looking at something completely different.
---
I'd have happily paid a one time fee, but a monthly subscription is too much. Especially a monthly subscription to something never needs to be updated or worked on ever again.
---
\&gt; To anyone who died at the hand of Shaankylld &amp; his sexy friend back then, sorry!

I think its important so that it not just "the louder person wins" If all there is is just skeleton posts, its easy for outsiders to think 100% of people care about skeletons
---
And two in time of war.
---
Fresh out of uni and no job yet, perfect time to no life wow 👌
---
Made me laugh, thank you
---
Y#all need someone to shit upon because the Classic AmA went really well
---
This again? 😒
---
It's perfectly reasonable question, but apparently person asking it incorrectly assumed people are not dum-dums and understand that its talking about exchange "I give you gold on BfA, you give me gold on classic", and not BfA toon opening trade window with classic toon - since that is impossible.
---
And trade like this are terrible for economy, it's basically same as gold farmers.
---
I think the word you're looking for is "Relaxing"
---
Yea, how else am I going to spell out the gamer word in gnome corpses :(
---
;)
---
lmao and people shit all over dugi guides, zygor guides and addons of those nature but because joana is one of /theboys/ suddenly this is ok and he deserves a buck or two. gotta love the double standards.
---
min/max bad, upvotes to the left
---
Looking for new friends to start playing Classic. Region doesn't matter, more interested in ad-hoc five man content than organized raids. Voice chat and humour required!
---
I'd like to play Remnant: From The Ashes ... but lacking a (coop)friend to play it with my I resort to a mix of Factorio and Rocket League
---
What a nightmare, just go for a 30 minute run and enjoy the game in comfort.
---
Whichever servers the russians and chinese choose to bot more? Probably EU.
---
Nope.
---
I have no intentions of wasting time logging into Retail when I have Classic to play.  
---
I walked away from World of Warcraft 10 years ago.  Classic is the only reason I am even back.
---
Yea he literally fucking killed the internet
---
That item is changed there is no way that would sell for 1g in vanilla must be a wrath version of the same trinket from classic
---
Playing a Mage and won't go into that zone till I'm 35. I'm just going to go in guns blazing. Try do all my quests in groups. I do want to do some world PVP and hopefully Horde will be the popular side on my server.
---
Wtf, i remember seeing when they announced esfands joining in some kill stream. That might have been a year ago, but never seen tipsout being in it.
---
If you look like Tipsout's videos from last blizzcon (9 months ago), no mention of method anywhere in his description.
---
STV is pretty much the first real neutral zone where alliance and horde both level for a pretty long time, sharing quest objectives.
---
If it is not regular PvP, it starts with "this alliance scum is taking MY QUEST MOBS" kills, which in return most likely mean revenge gank and more involvement of random people with faction pride.
---
You really think people will wait for the other faction to contest and grab the quest stuff? Maybe on a PvE server, yeah. 
---
You get slowed down by the other faction, be it with or without PvP.
---
What if people enjoy content by rushing through it using a guide?
---
The whole point of classic coming back is to enjoy what you enjoy.
---
People enjoy different things. Some like to take it slow and watch the world around them, some like to be the guy ahead of everyone, some like to be top dps, some like to heal, some like to gank, some like to rp.
---
Like every tool in the world, leveling guides are a tool for people that want a leveling guide.
---
Everybody and their grandmother was a proprietary launcher. It's getting ridiculous. It's a cluster of addons, not a major gaming publisher.
---
I got banned on the Classic forums for posting this: https://puu.sh/E7MNy/7cd5958731.jpg
---
For those patient enough to sit through the queues it will be playable.
---
Bosses in classic still had some mechanics, but you could usually explain them in 2-3 sentences.
---
Pls\_Buy\_Susan\_Express
---
People dont know whats fun for them
---
Oh I love being a snowflake
---
This guy is very mean I encountered his toxicity earlier I am still trying to recover stay strong friends
---
Legion launch was smooth, bfa not so much. Some shards in some zones worked fine, but if you were in the wrong shard, the game was unplayable since you got dced all the time. Maybe this also depends on the realm, but if there are queues, there is nothing to worry about for classic IMO
---
My rank 2 says otherwise.
---
Already on a few million gold, and I've barely touched BFA. Think I'll just use that 👌🏻
---
Unless you're talking about stuff like racist slurs, nobody's gotten banned just for swearing.
---
The vocal minority of this sub comes from r/mmorpg . People over there are upset about everything. Like this is no joke, they even meme themselves how toxic they are.
---
Some of the pserver plebs are also obnoxious as hell. Don't get me wrong, I also played a good deal of WoW on pservers and I know for a fact that players on pservers are generally much more toxic than people from retail (no matter which expansion, it was like this during BC, WOTLK etc).
---
You can't really expect anything good from people like this. They were hating on Blizzard for a long time already. Hardly believe anything will change their mind at this point.
---
Which ML hurt you in the past? You must have played with shitty people to have that kind of reaction. I pop masterlooter on to avoid problems, not make them. Plenty of time to talk without need/greed buttons flying all over the place.
---
Had enough gold laying around on the 12th to buy 60 days worth of game time so I did that. Not point in hoarding it tbh since BFA sucks a fat one and Blizzard is going to need to remove titanforging, warforging, and expansion long unique items (heart of azeroth type shit) for me to even consider playing the next xpack.
---
Hey, there's nothing wrong with asking for a fresh perspective, but in a world abundant with other people's perspective it's important to also remember your own :)
---
Hahahah blizzard giving something free?!?!? Check yourself into a mental hospital friend
---
Compared to sharding, where everyone around you can be phased in or out whenever the server feels like it. Its a good thing.
---
With layering you will only phase to a diffrent layer if you join a party.
---
With layering, when you see someone phase out its because they joined a party or for the normals reasons like accepting a summon or joining a battleground.
---
So compared to sharding, there is way WAY less people phasing in and out for no explainable reason.
---
Exactly. 5 bucks isn’t much to me but I can guarantee you I won’t be purchasing this. But I would have visited the site with ads about 1000 times while leveling. Oh well

**[Alliance][Firemaw]**
---
**5 Man dungeon leveling group for Classic!**
---
We are looking for 1 more player for dungeon leveling fast the first week of classic.   
---
Our schedule is a little off from the rest, **so please pay attention to that!**   
---
**Just missing the last Warrior!**   
---
**The group is going to be: Warlock, Priest and 3x Warrior**   
---
**Will be using Hakurai's guide**   
---
We are 90% done converting Hakurai's guide to Guidelime so it will be a breeze to follow it ingame while leveling.
---
**Time schedule**   
---
We expect people to be level 19 and have done some prequest and stuff before Thursday at 18 o'clock. After that the schedule looks like this:
---
Thursday (29th august): 18:00 - ??:?? CET   
---
Friday - Sunday: We will discuss these when we have a full group.    
---
But we are thinking around 16 hours a day. Maybe something along the lines of: 10:00-02:00.   
---
Will be agreed upon when we have a full group!   
---
Monday: 10:00 - Untill 60! (Hopefully)   
---
**Contact me with any questions you might have!**

I'd gladly give him 20$ for the guide. Just not like that. I'll be okay with the 5$ one time deal. Not with a subscription, lol. I know I can unsub, but that model just tells me that he's greedy.
---
Shit, there are open source applications which have a ton of work put into them over the course of decades and are free. Yet I should pay a monthly subscription to reading a manual?
---
I donated to open source programs for years - to the ones I like and use and I'd gladly donate to them too.
---
Shit, there's Microsoft Office which is a bit superior to Libreoffice, but I get the same goal accomplished with both of them. One costs 150$, the other one 0$.
---
Shit I'm rambling too much. I'll shut up now. I hope Joana drops that shit and converts to donations. I'll give him 20$, I won't even use the guide.
---
Any way for download at once all graphic?
---
Details are important, certainly. 
---
But how long is the list of details that Blizzard is changing? Is it long enough to be outraged over? Maybe I’m wrong, but I think it’s like... 2 items long (Layering and skeletons)?
---
Literally ever class has major downsides to it. I can't exactly say what you should play, but I'd suggest you stop basing what you want to play on the negatives and start basing them on the positives.
---
Hi I tried to recreate this in work sorry ms paint https://imgur.com/a/s10qj0f
---
I’m really indecisive guys. I feel like I can literally swing to any class except shaman and Druid. 
---
My main considerations in no particular order: 
---
Priest 
---
Warrior 
---
Rogue 
---
Mage 
---
Lock
---
Priest: I’ve never tried healing before so priest is different, I like the idea of being able to get into groups easily. 
---
Warrior: I main warrior in BFA. I enjoy the fast pace of fury. I’ve always liked tanking and I love the general warrior aesthetic/fantasy. I know they’re difficult and slow to level. I will most likely have my gf playing with me and she’s considering priest. Plus I also like knowing I can get into groups. 
---
Rogue: I also want to PvP and having a rogue fulfills all the fantasy of old school ganking. I love their aesthetics and class play almost as much as warrior. (That blood fang doe) I don’t like the fact that there will already be a ton of rogues. And the fact that they will be harder to find groups with. 
---
Mage: this was my first main. I enjoy the general play style of mages. They really have a more engaging PvP play style of control and what not. Maybe not so engaging as frost dps in PvE though. Being just dps grouping is also a concerned but less so than the rogue. I like the way mages can grind especially having your own water/ports is convenient 
---
Lock: my second main. Played all through BC basically and switched from mage. I like the fact that they’re great levelers and that they are God’s in 1v1. Their cloth aesthetics are probably better than the mage. At least nemesis set. I like their fantasy. 
---
I feel like I’m leaning towards warrior/rogue the most atm but tomorrow I could be leaning to lock and mage.
---
to figure out which classes are needed and I should play
---
Blizzard do. Some guild or troll group thinks it would be funny to spam swastikas everywhere and suddenly there are gaming articles about Nazi symbols in WoW, then someone else writes about the rise of Fascism in video games, specifically calling out World of Warcraft.
---
Sounds extreme but it happens and it's bad for business.
---
At some stage someone made the decision to remove that feature because of a naughty word. I can't even remember what expansion it was. And I'm guessing that is a decision in a company wide policy, or made by someone with more authority. 
---
*Nochanges, but yes changes if our boss says so. *
---
Isnt that the dagger that's chance on hit to do shadow damage or something? Pretty sure that only works for melee attacks
---
I'm sure he meant downs.
---
Do you have a link to the Diablo one mate?
---
Nice guide but not a patch on El’s Anglin.
---
true
---
Roll Druid to enjoy running flags until Rank 13 and get those sweet dragonhide set bonuses (+15% movement speed when in animal form) or roll Rogue and relive the dream ganking alliance scum in stormwind and ironforge with High Warlord’s Razors, for the Horde?
---
Hmmm...Less than a week to go, I should probably figure out what the fuck I'm going to play...
---
Yea i just hope it stays balanced and not like kazzak stormscale back in the days where it was just one sided
---
No, you won't if there are 5000 priests lookings to craft Truefaith Vestments.
---
Factorio is boss.
---
Big oof
---
Already donated.
---
I was planning to make some questing addon for Classic too. However, I would apply computer science into it. :) In my option, it would be possible to optimize questing route with some kind of Simulate annealing. And the best thing would be to create this optimizer which would change the route "live". Also I was thinking about counting XP of each monster and explored area :) 
---
Tho for that, I would need the database of all NPC's, mods and quests... And maybe a computation cluster, lol. 
---
Anyway, it would be interesting to apply CS into WoW :)
---
I was talking 1-20. Still not sure about 2.5h to 12 although atleast its believable. On the stress test it was taking about 4.5h for someone to get to 15. highly doubt 90%+ of people saying they will hit 20 the first day will do it.
---

---
What do you mean *was*, chomba?
---
I planned to use Joana from level 12 on now I will switch to Sage Guide in Guidelime addon, but I don't really know if this guide is any good. Can someone verify if its a viable guide?  [https://sage-guide.netlify.com/](https://sage-guide.netlify.com/)
---
Haha, I guess that was some kind of karmic justice wasn't it :p
---
You can bookmark where you are in the guide to continue from that page next time :)
---
Going to work, doing my normal run, getting whatever few tasks I need to get done finished, and then sleeping as much as I can. Sleep is the closest thing we have to time travel.
---
Works fine for my monitors 🤷‍♂️
---
Notice that Tipsout is the LAST one in that list, im pretty sure they just recently added him as "personality" streamer.
---
my shitposting skills need to be leveled up, that's for sure
---
Undead Rogue, nice. What realm you playing on?
---
Oh that’s nothing. Sweet, people are just being soft.
---
Let's be honest here, - people who complain about the lack of content on the forums are usually lvl 37 stuck in Badlands.
---
I honestly couldn't play Retail. I tried to force myself to like it and even then, I couldn't. It just doesn't feel like a RPG anymore.
---
Woah this hit me differently, i thought they were actually dead. 
---
best wow movies to date.
---
Yeah, 2271 now.
---
Yeah I agree, having to use questie. Could be worse though
---
I realise now that you can save your space. I was wrong.
---
Because of undead reasons
---
Sweet, easy sailing. Prob afk rs on the side.
---
Ooooh right, I got classic and retail wow subreddits confused.
---
Yes and it also increase spell power by 20.
---
The question is whether you want to get a public appreciation of your aesthetical race preferences or know which race will yield mathematically better performance. Humans are better for the latter.
---
You are the one to set your own priorities regarding looks vs performance, not us.
---
Mine was the Ardent Custodian 100 armor on a weapon baby! Let's go!
---
Rofl
---
Yes :) I thought i would constantly be able to see the same jackass of the other faction who killed me at level 30 and the people i leveled with on Durotar...constantly...but we will not :(
---
Layering is still better than sharding for sure...but im sad :(
---
Yep, exactly.
---
It’s so nice with snus and gaming, I think I use twice as much sitting in front of my pc as I do otherwise.
---
Eller man kunne bare spille spillet som man ønsker det? Hvorfor synes du din måde er mere rigtigt end min?
---
Hurry up and pull! I'm out of mobs!
---
Yah the succubus in PvP is super fun! I think I know what you’re talking about with the priest premade. Can you essentially play shadow in healing gear without having to farm 2 separate sets?
---
I bet the majority of people won't be rushing to 60 and will be enjoying the journey.  This isn't retail, the leveling experience is half the game.
---
They think they do, but they don't.
---
Whats most fun is what people choose to play - so its entierly subjektive. 
---
Mage and hunter are by far the best grinders.  Mages do massive pulls and aoe them down 
---
Hunters can solo certain Bosses with some finesse and gain gold from loot and disenchanting. 
---
Paladins are a 3rd option for farming - its similar to a mage but you probably kill slower and can in some ways make bigger pulls in som areas.  
---
However the mage is in general far better at it.  Its more of a ”if you play a paladin you can also farm like this” 
---
Since most healers cant farm via killing.
---
If the solution isn't ready for release, you could just open up the browser inspector and paste something like this in: 
---
&gt;     for(var i=0;i&lt;50;i++){ document.getElementsByName("next-step")[0].click(); }
---
Which will click the NEXT button 50 times lol
---
Well I'm a software engineer and I've done some gamedev. I know it's not potato or  fdjksklgjsrekgerlgk, because no sane developer would do name things that. They likely have a code bible internally that outlines things like naming conventions and abstraction standards. It doesn't matter what the method is called it's going to be something simple.
---
While I agree that it's a scummy move, what makes you think he made $1.2 mil off the first guides?
---
Treadmill? Check. Snowboard? Check. Cat tree? Check. Definitely seems like an A+ set up.
---
The horde version of dun morogh.
---
When Ice Floes for Frost first came out, you could use it to move while casting anything... including mounts. I’d love going into hellfire peninsula at max level and slowfalling myself, fly up and taunt people hovering over bases waiting to cap them. They’d shout or emote at me, thinking they were safe that high up. I’d slow fall, use ice floes 3 charges to pop off a couple buffed casts to kill them, mount midair and fly away.
---
I designed our Alliance guide to be printable. The 1-60 is not free, but the 1-19 is free and you can also print off the maps

I used to farm alterac valley, one day the pattern for bottomless bag dripped, the 18 slotter I believe. 
---
I was one of the first two people on the server that could craft 18 slot bags. I crafted a lot of bags....and paid for my epic mount like that :)
---
Who is this god?
---
Should I play maintank? How hard is it to be a maintank if you never played classic dungeons/raids and only bc+wotlk as a rogue?
---
Back in TBC, me and a few buddies used to fly to Hellfire Penninsula and go up onto one of the floating rocks. We would have someone in Org spamming trade for a DPS for a heroic. We'd open a lock portal on the floating rock and position it so right when someone entered, they'd fall to their death. Idk if I'd do that now but I loved doing that back in the day.
---
He should be happy with the views and put up adds, it's ridiculous that he has a subscription option...
---
Someone will get pissed off real fast and just rip the entire thing and Joana willl lose all the attention he has.
---
It's sad, Joana could piggyback of the classic release and become a semi-popular twitch streamer and make a living off it, but getting hella greedy rn.
---
Spoken like someone who has never had loot drama at last second need / greed rolls on the last boss of a long dungeon. Pre-boss discussions about loot don't mean shit in a PUG.
---
Pop ML on for Emperor and **time** is no longer a factor looming over that HoJ the hunter is drooling over because he doesn't know better. You link it and say roll. You discard the hunters roll. Easy as that. If hunter is upset you can explain why, because you don't have that short timer. \*poof\* Problem solved. I guess the downvote fairies are just having flashbacks from playing with scummy people.
---
Do you think the place saving will be done before launch? Very keen on using this guide.
---
For the record I’ve done the 0-60/70/80/100 grind on about 6 classes now, so know the quests/areas pretty well. Just not sure how scaling was changed before my time.
---
I was exaggerating for comic effect, there were definitely some cool instance boss fights in vanilla like the last boss of Uldaman (which was too hard and usually ended in a wipe), or the ziggurat fight in ZF, but after that I am struggling to remember any that were very interesting. They were all things like "at 50% two adds will come, so yeah", "at 50% it will sleep the tank so have an off-tank" or "it punts you so stand against a wall where the camera is awful".
---
Whereas the TBC instances bosses were all really cool.
---
I click the random button then maybe tweak or add a letter or here if I see something somewhat appealing.
---
Been thinking about running my ud there at the start cause I wants kodo mount.
---
So fucking real.
---
Last mass start I was doing stress 3 on orc's. Only the named scorpion was camped... I could easily tag scorpions around him all the time.
---
If you look at your link, the actual link and not what’s written in text, it’s missing a closing parenthesis “)” at the very end of it. Apparently that makes all the difference lol. No worries
---
I don't but these seem silly to me and like extra work having to read and stuff , wouldn't you just install questie or azeroth auto pilot and auto turn in and just play
---
I can't wait to come back from vacation knowing that i still have a week before going to work and that i can play wow!
---
They would be, but they're hunting Alliance most wanted, Sylvanas, Thrall and the Tauren I guess.
---
They mentioned in the AMA that all items will be 1.12, so expect it to be BOE.
---
They never ever did that mate.
---
T2.5 look kinda ridiculous by itself, since it's missing some pieces.
---
Can't wait to farm my Twill set.
---
Having the 7 people necessary for the water for mc is a pretty big f-u to pugs.
---
On the other hand if you farm the water yourself early, you're guaranteed a raid spot no matter what meme spec you are.
---
And it's not a crime to feel ripped off when you willingly chose to donate money to the guy, just to be charged for what you already feel like you paid for.
---
I'm rolling female human rogue cause I like their attack stance better than male and their weapons scale bigger and therefore look 37% cooler
---
Ahh perfect, should knock it out within 2 weeks, pre raid and attuned by the 3rd week and at MC week 4.
---
Good stuff, I remember getting mine farming cenarion rep in silithus. It was the Dwarven hand cannon. Which made me 200g at the AH and put me at about 650g and so close to my epic mount.
---
Doesn't work? The URL is still the same, localStorage is empty too. [https://classicwow.live/leveling/horde/solo/undead/rogue](https://classicwow.live/leveling/horde/solo/undead/rogue)
---
I wouldn't even want to play Classic if this is how I'd have to do it, that set up just looks so awful, I thought it was a joke too
---
Does this guide have an option for duo leveling though? Classicwow.live is the only one that I know of that has it.
---
I do hope they have race change as a service if they ever release TBC Classic though. Character boosts are a huge no no however.
---
And yet, Zygor's leveling guide has existed since forever.
---
It's $5, I spent that on a sandwhich I didn't need because I was bored.
---
I was unaware they had changed their stance. Pretty odd because they brought about this whole thing specifically because of the Carbonite addon someone else here mentioned.
---
At one point I saw a bunch of lvl 1 human male warlocks in some weird floating human pyramid thing spelling out gold selling websites in mid air. Christ knows how they did it
---
Queues? I can't hear you over the sound of me opening a tinnie on Remulos.
---
My experience was not that the game was grindy or especially slow to level. I think around level58 I felt like I had run out of quests and I grinded some easy to kill skeletons in western plaguelands that still gave decent XP for the last 2 levels.
---
There will be wow tokens in classic. What?
---
Totally doable. You just have to move slower, focus small groups and mark some mobs for CC. Other than that tanking is great fun and very rewarding.
---
for every annoying op complaining about the flavor of the week, there is an equally annoying ass kissing op that want to paint sunshine and rainbow over everything.
---
one cannot exist without the other.
---
You can heal dungeons fine with the normal shadow leveling spec.
---
Haha I was expecting not much more damage and a fail sound.
---
I don't know the TOS, perhaps you do?
---
I imagine if he had the addon free, but with a sign in option inside of it and this sign in is linked to his website where the subscription is either active or not...He could work around the TOS yes?
---
I am not a fisher, but I once leveled up my Fishing to max when Legion was a thing. If the Reputation Quest wouldn't take \~30 days to get exalted with Padles Gang, I would even do this. But my main goal was to get the legendary fishing pole (which I was too lazy for). But to be honest.. with all the stuff I had to read about fishing.. it was a pretty funny journey! Also all those fishes that would be rare, but would increase your fishing skill by \~25points if catched were really exciting to get. Esspecially when you could buy/sell them around 5000 gold each lol. 
---
I really loved the Murloc, which would run away after using it and throw fishes at the ground, which you could walk over and get the fish + the fishing ability :D
---
Just going off what the guy said yesterday, ffs. 
---
&gt;Following that logic, we should delete chat from Classic WoW because mentally backward fuck-tards can use the chat to write abusive / hateful / racist wording. Genius.
---
Well, many do, and get banned for it if/when reported. Don't really see the need for the circle jerk on corpses when their reasoning has been explained. Get over it.
---
I think this is a really good marketing move by its part. He knows that there's other alternatives to his guides, most of them free ones and in form of addons, and I'm pretty sure that if you dig enough, you'll find its guide by other means. He'll probably lift the paywall in one or two weeks from now. 
---
My guess is that he just want all the attention during this critical weeks to mythify the value of his work from the competition and to become an established speedrun streamer in the long run, since he has stated he's just working on its WoW guides full time, but I don't think that's his ultimate goal. He wants to be spoken of. Probably Asmongold and other streamers will take the bait later today. I'll be extremely surprised if they don't.
---
Of all the things they change, they change something to make the game objectively less good.
---
So you would say healers are the worst class for income then? Not many options for them? But in return they are taken into parties easily?
---
I had a 60 rogue in vanilla but I don’t think I did much pick pocket. 
---
Is there any value in it?
---

Classic Fans: "Retail ruined the community with LFR, people don't talk to each other"
---
Other Classic Fans: "Stop talking to people and go use google n00b"
---
I think 10 days /played is bullshit. Unless you're going AFK in-game a lot or love to waste time chatting then it shouldn't take you 10 days. Best is around a little less than 5 days and I'd say average for "focus on leveling" player should take him around 7 days /played time maximum.

Yes yes, let me just pick the other oceanic pvp server.....

pfQuest isnt coming to classic but you want to get: 
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex) 
---
Its basically pfquest redone by another guy.
---
So you want the product he made a it's better than the alternatives. But you don't want to shell out a whopping $5 a sum so negligible you could probably find it down the back of the sofa?
---
I dont think mankirks wife should be changed, itll just be updated on wow head immediately. War effort I could get behind tho
---
Blizzard says that they have to remove this feature because someone might get offended. 
---
#nochanges
---
I was on during BFA release and it was a surprisingly stable experience so I am hopeful classic will be similar. You'd think classic puts less stress on servers than retail but who knows how it will  go.
---
Was already planning on doin this, thanks for confirming.
---
I think I'll be getting my mates on Firemaw, don't want to wait in queues for days. For the Horde!
---
*"The people hated him because he spoke the truth"*
---
To have em free and then do a bait and switch is a bit shitty. IMO his patrons and twitch subs should get access. 
---
If it was a one off payment i would be fine with it , subscription tho ....  nah
---
Cheers for that. I was about to panic
---
I go to biology.  The phylum/class, family, genus, species names can be rich in possibilities.
---
&gt;  Most people have a life.
---
Yea, fucking losers
---
That wont work reliably whenever you skip across a section and 50x is apparently too much for the UI to handle too, only does 13 at a time for me.
---
Anyways, did you check their data model? Hilarious
---
&gt;And going oom after every trash group is entirely possible if
---
3. The healer is absolutely horrendous and spams heals when not needed and overheals a lot.
---
I can't understand how you list ways healers can go oom and none of your points actually has anything to do with the healer himself. Yeah, everybody else's fault.
---
&gt; I can say that most Tanks are in for a rude awakening
---
Same goes for healers whenever they can't spam heals.
---
&gt; Just to clarify: I know that there are bad healers as I have seen plenty, but it seems that the mentality on the Closed Beta was to always shift the blame to the Healers even if someone else
---
I haven't played the beta, but the mentality of this sub is that the tank/dps is at fault if anything dies. Imagine the worst healer possible adapting this subs attitude and going "if you pull, I won't heal you", acting all high and mighty.

Honestly, it sounds like you were trying to talk yourself out of playing hunter. You don't like the races for hunter, which is pretty huge. You shouldn't play a race just for a class, as it lessens your enjoyment overall. Your right that hunter can feel clunky in comparison to modern WoW. You have a deadzone (which really does suck) and you cant auto attack while moving. To name a few differences. You seem to be leaning more towards Lock or Rogue from what I have read.
---
Yeah for real. Wonder why they changed it lmao

---
Y'know, with how fast hunter is to level I think you could get a good idea if you like the class on the way up and reroll worst case scenario.
---
Older pvp games "clunky" kind of becomes its own form of skill. Messaging clunky mechanics to get good pvp performance is definitely a thing, and I know hunters have some interesting skillcap from that.
---
Not necessarily, you can be a healer and farm herbs/mining nodes and become far richer than someone who grinds mobs. You are just limited in the ways you can make gold as a healer that's all
---
Why? Just play for 18 hours from launch. You're severely underestimating people's ability to level
---
\*tips hat\*
---
Wow, this comment. You have severe issues and you need help.
---
I just clicked through that guide, and as an undead it has you go to Durotar at level 6 just to then return to Tirisfal a couple levels later...
---
yeah thanks for pointing that out, i went through and made a lot of them cleaner. the particularly bad ones like the one you pointed out were an artifact of me first trying to understand the new macro structure.
---
thanks dude as long as it has this database browser it‘s all fine
---
It's just the way I prefer it. I like having something physical. It was the way I did it the last time around, so it adds to the nostalgia as well. Aditinally, printing it out gives me something to do at work while I wait. :-)
---
I can play fulltime fortunately. I just don’t want to fail and let my guild down
---
Are you expecting to be in hardcore pvp premades? No? Meh play whatever race you want.
---
Bad gateway when I click the links in there tho
---
Would usually take about 20 Mins before mains or guild members showed up. We'd log off and come back in an hour or two and start again!
---
I feel like there is gonna be an accident that'll break both your legs somehow and that you won't be able to reach your keyboard to tell your group to stop pulling mobs and that you need a minute
---
I need someone to convince me rogues are wanted in groups.  
---
I've been going back and forth between pretty much all classes for months now and I've managed to narrow it down.  
---
Healers are out, I only enjoy healing in PvP, which I don't partake in all too much other than random wPvP encounters.  
---
From the pure dps classes the casters are out too, shadow/frost bolt spamming is gonna numb me out.  
---
That leaves us with Rogues, Hunters and Warriors.  
---
The only unappealing thing for Rogues I can think of is that they are just not wanted in random pug dungeons groups because the ranged dps'ers bring more utility and the tanks would rather not have a rogue in the group because of gear competition.  
---
Someone hold me tight and tell me it'll all be alright please :(
---
See I was considering a standing desk + treadmill setup, but nothing I could do would ever be as batshit as this. I salute you.
---
I believe that be means +6 months to a year after the content cycle has concluded
---
Won't be able to do 4hm
---
Sweet! I need a horde guide, though. I'm sure someone else will find it useful :-)
---
the best pvp build can heal in raids just collect a set of healing gear too. it's not ideal but you can get away with it in more casual groups.
---
i never told you how to play the game. just that it seems like a worse way
---
Listening to an interview, he puts a truckload of work into this guide.  I can't fault the guy for wanting to be paid for his time.  If it's good enough and designed well enough that people want to pay for it, good for him.  I don't feel entitled to get it for free.  That's not my call.
---
An actual, relevant, non-disruptive proposition to a real topic that is indeed changing the game from what it was? Tell me more.
---
Skellerdons
---
I think mage will open up a much more complex set of pvp and gold earning options. Their pve rotation is as boring as pally.
---
I guess it's a matter of preference. To me, following a set out path and guide specifically is what makes retail so fuckin' boring. Turns what could be a great adventure full of discovery into a theme park-rail system where you follow your guide and keep your legs and arms in the vehicle.
---
Never played classic before, am playing a mage on retail at the moment (Fire). And I cannot decide to go either:
---
1) Warlock (Undead)
---
2) Mage (Undead)
---
I understand every class has its pro/cons and really inclined to go Lock but concerned about DPS output in raids.
---
In following areas who would outperform:
---
* Raiding: 
---
* PVP: 
---
* Leveling:
---
* Utility:
---
Any feedback is appreciated!! :)
---
Man, I used to just summon people off the edge off Thunderbluff! The promise of Azuregos is brilliant.
---
&gt; Classic Fans: "there's more than enough resources that answer your question if you cared to look them up"
---
Why not just let people hide skeletons if they want?
---
NE have slightly higher stealth levels which helps out a little bit everywhere in stealth, great for use in higher level dungeons for pickpocketing. Dwarf is better in PVP with stoneform being a free trinket, human is generally better in PVE with weapon skill bonus.
---
You join more casual guilds that will accept you as a healer.
---
You can intentionally be a fuck up. I was looking forward to maybe alt-tabbing into Retail while I'm on a 14 minute flight path from EPL to Booty Bay.
---
&gt; I know it's not potato or fdjksklgjsrekgerlgk, because no sane developer would do name things that
---
You don't know shit.
---
Why watch them when you can just watch me, I will be doing the same thing lolz.... Anyway, its nice to hear!
---
I've taken 7 weekdays off from work to lvl to 60 and raid on tuesday the 3rd hehe
---
I feel you on that as in I'll always prefer a nice book over a Kindle or something hope you find something !
---
#changesthtbenfitus
---
Not at all. The racial traits are only really to be considered for min-maxing. People also forget that NE Rogues's have +1 to deception with Shadowmeld, which basically gives them the best stealth in the game. Assuming you are good at positioning, this can give you a strong edge in PVP, especially against other rogues who's stealth level is less than yours.
---
i'm not really bashing others by saying their way of playing sounds boring? everyone can decide for themselves
---
Don't confuse your outrageously unhealthy play time with the reality of other people's available times
---
My god you might as well be a bot the way you’re spouting this bandwagon brain dead shizzle
---
which is slower than stopcasting you peasant.
---
What if you support sailing the high seas? Fuck off with your virtue signaling, people will do what they're gonna do and the guide is already going to be pirated to a freefloating PDF in the first week (if it hasn't already) anyways.
---
It is by far my favorite starting zone.
---
My husband I were to low level to participate, so we corpse dragged ourselves to participate as tourists. I'm really excited to witness this again.
---
currently he is streaming what it looks like private server on twitch. i recomment everyone to report him for streaming illegaly content. that what he deserves
---
1. read all the other 100000000000000000000000 posts about "never touched classic/wow"
---
2. ???
---
3. profit
---
dont think that would be optimal
---
Fuck sake I just have so many more questions now.
---
gonna be honest with you, if they decide to move into BC and then WOTLK after classic is done i would prefer it to stay as it was then they came out. i want the LFG in WOTLK etc. though i feel that if they do eventually add BC and WOTLK servers that people should have the choice to move to those new servers with their classic characters if they so choose. just like how classic players want the classic experience to be the same as it was in vanilla i want the experience in BC/WOTLK to be the same as it was then.
---
It really just shows that even though classic wow is coming back, classic Blizzard is not. They don't care about the game, only about what the corporate overlords say.
---
The average player will probably not take 10 days anymore. Dungeon grinding can get you there in like 5-6 days now even for slow players. Mages questing on pservers have had like &lt;2-3 day runs.
---
thanks
---
Fastest way to level is dungeon grind gl ganking the ppl who are actually ‘turbo leveling’
---
Nightelf racials blows for tanking, but warrior is still a warrior, racials don't matter that much.
---
Yes pls blizz give us skeles
---
That would be too obvious and good.
---
What server was this on? It looks like tbc pre-patch! At 2:10 you can clearly see a warlock with felguard pet.
---
Why? It's going to work... It's a tiny amount of money for such a big gain.
---
&gt; You don't know either.
---
100% correct. My problem is that it's not going to help since the devs don't read this. If you want to ask, ask them.
---
Looking for "Crom,Krom,Thorgrim,Conan,Kull, and Rexor" I have "Belit and Thulsa" to trade.
---
You should try exercise.
---
So the same with 12 alts? Plenty of stuff to do!
---
You’re disregarding a persons hard work. And then wait till the DMCA notices start coming into reddit staff for copyright infringement. You’re creating a toxic community supporting this.
---
If there isnt a rammstein song in this im heavily dissapointed and I will hold you accountable ;)
---
I'll get my guild to do it. Don't even need skellerdons when you've got 40 GAMERS!
---
Their new anti-cheat technology makes gold selling in this manner impossible. Unless you can still script teleportation into the sky in a synchronized manner, websites won't be a problem.
---
Tbh I don't really see an issue with saving it, as long as you don't share it. But yeah, a one-time payment for e.g. PDF, or continued access to a certain version would be a great alternative.
---
I'm sorry man, this just doesn't sit well with me. If you troll people, why would you report them for rageing back at you?
---
Howarye
---
Wouldn't mind a toggle. Updated tauren look great, can't stand the shovel hands...
---
I got an Orb of deception from the dire maul arena boss on a RP server. Had my epic mount within 1 week of reaching 60.
---
I don't think anyone thought otherwise. Isn't gonna stop those that don't want to pay for it.
---
Vanilla stroke the only possible balance that can exist in MMOs : hardcore vs casual. It managed to have both, in the same game.
---
Vanilla casuals weren't unhappy because they can't raid AQ40 and Naxx. They weren't unhappy because they didn't had the time to rank 10 or higher. Hardcore players didn't complained that the game is easy, because their part of the game wasn't. Every single type of player that can possibly exists had a place in Vanilla.
---
Today...well, no point to even talk about.
---
We all see what BfA is. And where is going (hint : mobile).
---
I hope they gonna add some harmless easter eggs themselves, extra flavor never hurts.
---
Thanks, was not aware.
---
The introduction of transmog is pretty much directly related to when I stopped giving a shit about gear. I get way more satisfaction seeing clown suits and knowing what the items are without inspecting.
---
Who needs a guide when you've got like 600 days /played across multiple accounts :D
---
Likely priest will go smoother. Just in general, playing one of the big four is going to make your life easier (Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Priest). The other classes are needed, but just don't form bread and butter for raids like those 4 do.
---
Wait what’s going on with loot trading?
---
You spelt alliance wrong
---
Dare you to chop off some fingers and toes too , you won't coward
---
Or you know, just gave an easy example of why to use macros.
---
You could use the same to automatically dismount from your mounts, instead of manually having to cancel the mount.
---
with the day of classic launch retail has died for me once and forever. never looking back
---
Damn this is amazing, nice job!!
---
Well, you don't have to follow the guide to the letter. For me it's more like a reference sheet on the quest structure of the zone, which can be quite obscure in Classic. It provides a bigger picture on the zone and let's you go through all its content in a cohesive manner, as opposed to disjointed leveling where you'd do multiple zones partially in order to close the gaps in exp.
---
joana turned into a joke, were his guide put into a very fancy and really easy to use addon format i would understand, but paywall for a fucking lame webpage list when there are so many other free guides out there??? hahhaha.... he just became completely irrelevant....
---
Anyone able to help with best spec wanna go engi after i hit 60 but for leveling?
---
Look at their videos. Insane pace.
---
Now, please make one for the Warrior and Paladin quest weapons.
---
Oh... and for the Paladin and Warlock epic mounts. For people to see the true cost of free.
---
Difference though is they could have unlimited shards for the xpac starting zones and cities to funnel people into.  Classic won't have that with layering as they want to slowly reduce layers.  But we'll see.  Right now I'm more worried about queues
---
Aesthetically Mulgore is my favorite starting area, but questing wise I completely despise it to the point of never rolling a tauren.
---
Oh u bad
---
Private servers has been using blizzlike exp for quests for over a 1½ years. Do you really think joana hasn't updated yet?
---
Yea, that was probably the best clarification in the post. But in general a lot of people seemed to be unaware of what "testing" means, and went completely mental because of it. ;)
---
This was my first epic drop too. I got really excited about seeing the price that it apparently went for on the auction house (around 50g, I checked thottbot), but quickly realised that that was the price on the 3 month-old US realms, not the EU side. I ended up selling it for 10g to someone who only had 5g at the time - he sent me the other 5g a day later in the mail.
---
Mine was a Lifestone that dropped in Un'Goro on my warrior.. 14 odd years ago damn.
---
NOW THAT'S IMMERSIVE AND DESIREABLE.
---
Thats not true.  You can write a guide for WoW and see it and don't have to pay Blizzard a penny (as long as you don't use their art without permission of course).
---
I’ve always happily used wow-pro.com which dates back to classic.  I used an early classic version of their in game addon during beta and it was cool enough. 
---
Happy that the addon community is embracing classic.  Thanks for your hard work.
---
You are honestly fucking retarded if you think that question needed a response.
---
I was set on playing a pally but then the new servers opened and I managed to get all my names and will now be rolling horde, specifically a troll.
---
I liked pally because I wanted to avoid the surge of warriors, rogues etc and pick a class with some niche that groups want. I'd preferably like to be viable in pvp and 5man content. I will probably dabble in raiding but at the moment am not sure how far I will push that.
---
I'm now debating between a Shaman or a mage. I know Shamans are stuck as healbots for a lot of content but at least I know healers will be needed and I can secure my spot in a group nicely as a resto shaman.
---
I'm also considering mage due to the utility of cc, water, portals and naturally because they are a good class for all types of content. My only issue is trying to stand out from all the other dps looking for groups.
---
I don't follow the news but off the top of my head:
---
Skeletons, layering (big one, creates a myriad of different problems), itemization (big one, catch-up items introduced later in the game will be available immediately (except for t0.5) thus invalidating loads of items) and loot-trading (I don't know if they changed their stance).
---
I'm sure there's more and I haven't even mentioned client-side things but like I said - I follow the news for classic very casually. I'll play it for a month and then decide if these changes were too much (layering is too much already, but I'll be evaluating the game as if it's P2 and layering is gone).
---
!remindme 6 days
---
I couldn’t do a single character more by starting in the Orc/Troll area.  I never want to see that zone again.  Leveled so many times there and that palette is just harsh. Looking forward to some tranquility !
---
imma camp at the entrance
---
Im at work atm so i can not check this out. Venoxis is full already? Hard to believe as it was low til late yesterday evening.
---
I'm looking for a class that will do well as a solo player. With my work schedule, I can't commit to a consistent raid schedule. So I want something that won't have issues pugging raids. Also, my main focus is probably going to be PvP. Lots of BGs and world PvP. I want something that can do well in both of those, and can 1v1 / 1vX. 
---
With that criteria, I was thinking mage, rogue or hunter...but I'm just not sure!
---
china -&gt; US
---
russia -&gt; EU
---
as there are more chinese people than russians i would say US
---
Ah okay. How did they get online? Just lucky? Sorry for so many questions
---
Maybe Blizz, figure out how to have both bony boys and no gold bot spam.
---
I know you were only giving an example, I was just kidding even tho it might've come across as snarky.
---
For me personally, I just bind the mount to some mouse button and use it to both mount and unmount.
---
Well that’s not very nice :(
---
We've got a dungeon plan, just need to make 17 and im new to alliance :)
---
I thought we were talking about 1-12. No biggie.
---
I think many will manage to get level 12 in 2-4 hours but maybe you're right about the "semi good" not making 2,5 hours. Change that to those that are good/great at leveling. Though it depends on what class you're leveling as.
---
And I agree that most that plan on getting to level 20 won't make it the first day since you have to sit at least 10-15 hours with a practiced route/guide to make it.
---
brilliant work, grabbed for avatar))
---
Definitely. Former classmate of mine botted HEAVILY during WoD and Legion and his account is still availabe.
---
Damn straight
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Personally don't mind 1 skeleton per char, but loads of skeletons everywhere? no ty
---
Wow this looks so much nicer than on my potato of a computer.
---
He had no Alliance Guide anyways.
---
Yeah, like I said, to each their own. Hardly worth the downvote imo. I prefer organically figuring stuff out, myself.
---
Your mom is so supportive.
---
&gt;should of
---
....
---
Theres a friend of mine rolling alliance on herod that we would like to camp. Cant do that now sadly :-/
---
You could use the same gear for the most part, and some part did you have to get like some trinkets most
---
i dont want do anything, everything feel boring right now.
---
Why even bother having TOS if you plan to remove any player freedoms that could potentially be used to violate them?
---
Hehe smart druid i see
---
And i'm now happy to be french ! I think there is only a few who takes info here :p
---
you can definitely play Tank Warrior. Keep in mind though, the warrior is probably the slowest of levelers (and i'd argue the hardest one as well). And especially since you never played wow, this can be a bit frustrating.  
---
However!, if you manage to get to 60, the reward is very big. In raids, warrior tanks are loved by everyone because they are just that good of tanks!
---
So yes, definitely playable, but just keep it in mind!
---
And then maybe I should start charging when I run people through a raid ? Or when I give advice to a beginner ? When I run a dungeon so I don t roll on gear ? Etc. How about addons and the simcraft tools ?
---
Joanna  s guide has been online for years on the internet.
---
The Zygor addon is completely free, the big leveling guide plugins are what costs money, but it has some shitty free guides by default.
---
I'm guessing thats how they get around the restrictions.
---
My favorite by far, and Undead are my favorite lore wise(and from WC3!!) but god damn I just can’t stand their model.  Bones sticking out all over the place.  Best dance tho!
---
 [https://gofile.io/?c=oWIZxo](https://gofile.io/?c=oWIZxo)  here is a link to a pdf file with the horde leveling from 1-60.
---
Shamans are somewhat frustrating. Their really fun bursty pvp spec doesn't do well in raids, well none of their damage does really. So gearing for that is harder. Their healing is fine, but you need two separate sets to maintain both so there's extra effort there.
---
Mage and warlock are pretty hard to really say one is better than the other. Mage outperforms warlock in pve, warlock is somewhat more notorious in pvp. Both are versatile and can do well in pvp and pve. Both level very well, although warlock has a hair's edge on it due to pet tank.
---
If I had to suggest one over the other? Warlock's soul shard management eats inventory space and some people might find that annoying.
---
Consensus will be mage for your requirements I think. Good at everything, not hugely gear dependant.
---
The more politcal shit people hear about the more people will want to escape into Azeroth. /tinfoilhat News show nachors are the biggest gamers of us all!
---
It’ll be more challenging than other classes / roles but if that’s what you want to do then don’t shy away from it. Tank lots of instances as you level up and you’ll have a decent idea of what you’re doing at 60- people are more patient with new players at early levels. I would also avoid speccing Prot for leveling, even if you plan on tanking a lot. Good luck!
---
Can't violate TOS if you can't play. 
---
tapstemple.jpg
---
Don't think many will be able to play for 18 hours.
---
People might think they can but playing a game for 18 hours straight will take it's toll.
---
Great Choice by Joana, i wouldn't do work for allys aswell, unless i get paid well!
---
The queue times on Shazz/Herod I think are going to be several hours
---
Engineers don't stop naming things sane things under crunch time they don't even stop adding method comments. No lead developer would allow such a thing in a large company. Ever. 
---
I'm a backend engineer it's not like I've never been under crunch time lol. That's not unique to any sector of development.
---
Lol he allways said he will monitize it in some way imagine thinking u deserve something for free some one worked like 2 years for \^\^
---
Well wow, if only American news had that quality.
---
Jeez talk about American exceptionalism
---
&gt;we get promised a bunch of free guides and stuff
---
i have no horse in this race, nor do i care one way or the other. Will not use the guide and i especially will not pay for it. But were you promised **free** guides?
---
Pretty sure there will be someone in Nasa-like mod !
---
What? Could you source me on this?
---
If there was just a way to get their hearthstone on CD before :D
---
I’m mad jelly about the Dwarf/gnome starting zone and to some extent the night elf(until you have to make that accursed migration).
---
Trying something new? Why not hunter? New mechanics, very powerful leveling experience if you're playing solo, good moneymakers endgame due to dungeon farming.
---
Trying to tackle warrior for tanking is a pretty monumental effort, not something I'd suggest to someone who's unsure.
---
This. You call for nochanges when it suits you, little Blizzard.
---
Implying you wouldn't have VW out for sac ready to go when that inevitable rogue pulls up on you
---
&gt; you'd understand the crunch they were under.
---
The not a crunch at all because this isnt a fresh retail launch and they set their own release date?
---
So you...someone who has NO development experience, knows more than the several people with development experience that have told you that you are wrong.
---
Got it.
---
God I love Elwynn, it’s my favourite starting zone. And Westfall is my favourite zone of all to level in. Really wish I could roll Alliance again, I much prefer all of the levelling zones to be honest. I envy you :)
---
Change all the raids, dungeons and quests too!
---
to be fair every "hardcore" player of each expansion said the next one was made easier to cater to casuals. vanilla hardcore players said that TBC was made to cater to casuals and the same with TBC hardcores with WOTLK, same with WOTLK with cata. being honest WOTLK was peak time for WoW and i'd say that they did really well with TBC and WOTLK things didn't start going south for WoW until cata that was when there was a huge drop in subs
---
Raid gear will be out first when naxx congress don't even bother with pvp gear.
---
I love how this is the hill people are choosing to die on.
---
I’ve played since vanilla and will be playing classic, absolutely will not miss the fields of random skeletons. 
---
The people who are claiming **#NOCHANGES** can stuff it, anyone trying to say it breaks immersion...seriously? You’re character dying and dropping multiple skeletons all over is somehow immersive versus just one skeleton per death? 
---
If World PVP happens you’re still gonna have skeletons on the ground, but this time when you see 30 skeletons it will be from 30 *actual players* rather than just a handful that killed each other multiple times.
---
Lmao the payment service has a 60 day refund no questions asked policy. It's gonna be really juicy when joana loses all the money after a month when everyone either used the guide or took a picture.
---
The Guy is right 30/0/21 lets you get all the good ele talents, and still heal just nature swifnes
---
A good tank watches the healer's mana bar to know when to give them time to drink.
---
It's an dick move to ask money 1 week before launch tbh. I'm glad people have .pdf's but I'm going with another guide like Zygor
---
There’s only 1 way
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctf6vo/joanas_leveling_guide_horde_160/). 
---
You should give retail a shot, mythic raids and + are the hardest MMO content ever created and a ton of fun!
---
I mained a warrior in Vanilla and did great in all aspects of PVP. It was incredibly fun. It's not the easiest class to PVP as, but once you get it down you can seriously kick ass.
---
This helped our first Huhuran kill after quite a few nights wiping!
---
But what about the murloc camp near eastvale logging camp in elwynn forest then? :o
---
Hmm, all great picks. i'd say the mage is the best overeall PVP'er, but this is my personal experience. Hunters definitely level the fastest though! So that is good to keep that in mind.   
---
I think overall (at level 60) its Mage &gt; hunter &gt; rogue (in BG's, not 1v1's) 
---
maybe someone can give their own feedback on this
---
Mage/Warlock and slightly less so but still counted: Hunter
---
Three classes I'd say fit your descriptions.
---
I see no poop sock?
---
Why would you be concerned with playing the best ranged DPS in classic? If you want to pug, it's better to play a staple class that anyone will take without question as far as DPS goes.
---
Like using your keyboard or mouse software or a program like auto hot key to press a key / click your mouse every few seconds so the game doesn't log you out.
---
Playing Horde for classic and it was no contest I try out a Tauren druid.
---
Thank you this one worked great! Upvoted!
---
unnecessary
---
first of all warriors will have a harder time to find a spot than mages. second of all raids are 40 man and guild will try hard to get them together at any given time so you will find a raidspot for sure.
---
I'm torn between two names for my shaman.
---
Managed to get Flameshock, but I also like my troll name Timmytwotoes
---
I mean no, not exclusively, just amongst other things.  
---
And yes, being on defias brotherhood felt pretty lonely, as opposed to argent dawn where the streets of stormwind were always filled during the day/evenings.  
---
Part of the magic of RP realms is how much more alive they feel even in the moments where you're not RPing. I have friends to play with so I'll never REALLY feel alone, but its a lot easier to find more on a livelier realm.
---
So since 2005 you still have no clue where to level?
---
Honestly Joana’s guide is quality worth paying for.
---
I do however think he has the wrong approach and pricing - he should really be charging like $10-20 flat for the guide and another $10-20 for the addon.  A membership model doesn’t make sense for this imo - most people just level up fully once or twice.
---
Act as smug as you want, but when there's video evidence that a system in the game doesn't work the way blizz says it does people are right to complain
---
From what I’ve seen - most Americans call it VC and most Europeans call it DM
---
&gt;And then wait till the DMCA notices start coming into reddit staff for copyright infringement.
---
You are a idiot. Btw, you could pay the $5 for 1 month access and then do a refund thas advertised there, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. 
---
Since instance grinding is a thing, loads of people wont need any of these solo questing routes anyways. Following a popular guide in server launch is like shooting yourself in the head anyways.
---
Rebind 'WASD' to 'TFGH', enjoy the new-found freedom/potential as long as your dexterity is high enough.
---
Careful that this guide is different from the one he has on the web currently - this is the original guide, as the webpage states. It lacks the "major improvements" everybody praises here.
---
I mean, if he wants to earn money, he should get a diploma and have a boss. Until then, donations should be enough. There are enough people that do it for free
---
Damn you just solved the problem
---
But in Stormwind harbor there’s a ship to darkshore!
---
I've been like you too but I've changed when I realized: It's not "too cool to care" it's understanding when it is actually meant to be serious and when it's just done to provoke and annoy people.
---
First of all, it's a video game. If some idiot and his dumbass friends are stupid enough to draw a swastika with their corpses it's not because they're neonazis, but because they want to provoke and be the cool kids who want everyone to talk about them. 
---
Kids being dumb, it's old.
---
Now let's say neonazis would do that. That would make them look like absolute jokes and it would be even funny. 
---
But in both cases only one kind of people care: The ones who take things to seriously, because "oh my god! It's so immoral to do that!"
---
Have them banned, I don't care, but the worst thing is that everything's gotta change just to keep anyone from doing it again. Because someone might take it seriously.
---
Why does everything on the internet have to be black and white? You either care and you're the good guy or you don't and you're an asshole. 
---
Thanks, dude, I'm an asshole because I don't care about stupid shit that provokes you easily. Noice. Thank Jeebus rl is not like that.
---
"end game content"
---
One of things I really like about the honour system and BGs not being introduced for a while is that (as a PvP player) i don’t feel I need to rush at all. 
---
The last time i played WoW was on the private server Netherwing and I really hooned it to 60. With Classic I’m planning on taking my time to really enjoy the experience.
---
yes
---
Blizzard had 3 WoW Classic stress tests, where two of which, anyone with a subscription could log-in and level up to 15.

Whats your thoughts on warrior?
---
are you telling me classic has no lvl 60 content?
---
Agreed.  He charged for his guide back in vanilla so of course he’s going to do it again.  It’s up to you if you think it’s worth it, he’s not forcing you to buy anything.
---
I just love how I donated $25 because I like his guide to only me locked out 3 days latter asking for more $$$.....
---
The time and labor he spent putting the guide together isn't his? Time is money, friend.
---
There's a way through Dun Morogh, fall to your death in the mountains bordering on the Wetlands, revive in Menethil graveyard.
---
The second half of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjwglc/i_made_a_video_on_how_to_skip_easily_between_dun/).
---
have never seen that, thanks!
---
Maybe if you defeat someone you get a small % of their gold + chance at an item in their bags. That would be fun. Wouldn't evener happen though.
---
One time when I came over he had his mage doing Battlegrounds in the background.
---
I've never ninja'd a thing but go ahead and assume the worst.
---
Enjoy classic.
---
Then play there. 
---
Thanks.
---
They specificly said while they could easily enlarge the cap in Classic, they won't, because of the integrity of the game.
---
No thanks. Far rather they work on other things that are game impacting.
---
They're POE streamers.
---
Raiding: Both good, mages get more spots but are also a more commonly played class. It evens out.
---
PVP: Both good. Mage usually kites (one mage spec is super burst mind), warlock facetanks and leeches through damage.
---
Leveling: 2nd and 3rd best levelers in the game. Some debate on which is better, might lean slightly on mage.
---
Utility: Both have unique utility that groups find useful.
---
If I had to compare them on the one major difference? Warlocks are a bit more annoying. Their summoning ability means they are expected to do more legwork for dungeons/raids. Their soulshards take up inventory space and a tiny bit of pre-planned farming when you need a bunch.
---
reductio ad absurdum is a logical fallacy and a very poor way to progress a discussion, you just look silly
---
Really do not think its is illegal, the info is not owned by the person selling it.
---
You spelled spelled wrong. Typical horde scum
---
What stops 5 people from teaming up and killing, aka permadeath, soloplayers? What is fun in that?
---
I mean sure for the 5 man team, until they've killed everyone, but after? Nah.
---
STILL: Funny thought
---
Lol, that shit has been on my hard drive for a decade. I'm fine.
---
You just gave me 'Nam flashbacks from some of those corpse runs back in the day...
---
Shit like this is why I'm not playing Classic WoW -- I'd prefer to leave that era of the game as a happy memory.
---
Ahhh...well that’s dirty.
---
I'm not assuming anything, you're admitting to doing it, but feel free to ignore the rest of my post because I called you out on it.
---
Lol this is a childish response.
---
75% will never make it to 60.
---
Just move them a little to a random direction. Problem solved.
---
No, I'm jsut making a beeline to Camp Naratche or whatever its called to level up 1-10 with the cowpokes and get rep. The red colors of durotar got tiresome back in 2005 for me hah

It references something that was never said nor implied, so why use it at all? To answer the question, it's an attempt to pigeonhole the person they're responding to because they don't see another reason a person might respond that way. Hope you learned something today.
---
Diablo 3 starts a new season Friday, you could play it over the weekend, I find the opening seasons really enjoyable. I play on Xbox
---
Lol virtue signaling.
---
So then you're telling people they should pay $5 to commit suicide?
---
i know, but its classic to have a lot of skellies :'(
---
This is clearly fake, implying theres women in goldshire, lol.
---
Oh my sweet, Summer child...
---
Classic WoW is going to eat you alive :')
---
Ex BR member here,altough later switched to Executus
---
hahaha because they have all been corpse camped nd been logged out for 3 days xD
---
Idle hands are sargearas’ play things
---
Yeah people are talking about 8 hour queues but they aren't considering people just never logging off abusing 3rd party programs and the queue just not moving at all.
---
I don’t understand people who enjoy taking shit from others. I will never, ever, ever, play any kind of full-loot game.
---
Time is not hardcore. If time investment was hardcore, than Witcher 3 with both DLCs would be hardcore. Which it's not, even on the highest difficulty Witcher 3 is incredible easy.
---
Baldurs Gate the whole trilogy, takes over 200 hours, the game isn't hardcore or difficult.
---
But something that is punishing and used in games like Dark Souls. That's not hardcore to you. Oh no, if you make one wrong move you loose everything, that is super casual.
---
The person who thinks the earth is flat is certainly you.
---
An orc riding a Kodo is a cool picture.  Best of luck.  I’ll be Minotauring it up this time!
---
It will be until you die again. Then that corpse will be there.
---
that's why getting ahead of the pack is so important. The farther away you get from level 1, the more people will also be speed leveling and not waste time doing world pvp
---
punkrat and madseason both have a ton of videos on YouTube about everything you should know
---
I tried setting it up last night, you can customize the keys to what you want. I have it now the top row is f1-f5, next row down Is 1-5, then lower than that 6 to 0, and finally f6-f10. It has a pretty long cord so I can set it up where it is on my stomach and I can use my right hand with my normal mouse.
---
It also has 2 buttons where the directional pad is, I changed the key binding from the key above the directional pad to be a 'Tab' so I can easily target, and I hot keyed the lower button as 'escape'. Hopefully that will allow me to play somewhat smooth. 
---
I'll keep you updated with how it's working 
---
Its pretty handy (hah), because I dont have to have my entire keyboard on my lap and chest
---
Pickle
---
how? you are gonna be way behind in lvl's cause you're ''ganking'' them
---
In 5 days your questions will be answered. Vanilla is a good community
---
Thanks man!
---
But there's undead mages...
---
Well, people usually don't pay for addons, so the interest could be lower than if he had made it free and maybe made a few ads around the addon/his website. My opinion. Imagine fortnite being 60 dollars instead of free. Same situation
---
I'm interested in 5-man content and bg pvp (some openworld maybe). My time is limited to 15 h/week. I've narrowed down to only two options this time: 
---
* **Mage:** not very gear dependent, lots of possibilities in pvp, top tier dps. On the other hand, I think I'll get bored of spamming frostbolt in dungeons/leveling mobs.
---
* **Warrior:** Honestly I love everything about it but having that is considered the most time consuming class I might not enjoy it due to my little time to play. 
---
I certainly know I won't play druid, paladin nor priest.
---
I get bored easy if the class is not engaging me, that's why I feel warrior suits me most. Also tanking 5-man seems funnier than dpsing or healing (in classic). But also I really like the pvp playstyle of the mage and I understand I won't do shit at lvl 60 as a warrior in at least a year from launch. 
---
Any advice is appreciated and other classes (shaman, rogue, warlock or hunter) can be suggested if any suits me better.
---
But I know that, I know it very well.
---
I don't see how this is any different to a player abusing chat channels by posting offensive messages. My only guess is that it's more difficult to find who's responsible with just the corpses left behind, rather than a name.
---
And feared by hunters
---
Enjoy the ride and soak up as much as you can. There is so much to do and see and if you realize you missed some of it you will kick yourself. You are going to have one of the best gaming experiences you will ever have, so make the most of it.
---
Ingame Addons, yes. But Joana's Guide is on his website.
---
I’m gonna wait til atleast 40 so I have a mount
---
Alt-right? lmaooooo
---
Tell them your a noob man some people will help you along the way others of course.....
---
Dude. Just because you didnt literally say ”i’m pissed”, people can still assume from your replies that you are angry. I mean you just told me to fuck off, which is a pretty obvious sign of you being pissed. Just saying that there is no reason for being angry, when people are just asking for help. You can ignore or help them.
---
You use all those but not Q and E?
---
That and the slightly offset spawn location and voilá
---
Of the three things you listed, there two I see flaws in. Warriors are mostly played for tanking and pvp. Rogues are mostly played for pvp.
---
If you're not intending to actively pvp, hunter is the best pve class in the lot. Sure they get less raid slots, but they're also a significantly less common class.
---
One of the best parts.  Seeing a Hunter with a big ass lion following it was always a cool sight.
---
Instant classic thank you OP
---
I ranked when I was new to the game. It’s fine if you tell the group you’re new, ask for advice, and follow instructions. Druid is easier, Warrior is more complicated but either way you’ll be fine.
---
No problem, please share it with other people :)
---
i see that you want to do something in the waiting time.. but.. sitting there and watching up will make your neck hurt.. since th chair is to small.
---
also minus for the Screens not being at the same level.. shame
---
More than once. More than once experienced exactly this. Not sure if stupid, ignorant or intend / trolling.
---
What server are you guys rolling on?
---
I mean he sold them back in vanilla too after he got his world record. Adds for it are like what Zygor is today
---
I want this for a cycle D8 good job, I hope it is nice and stable while you run.
---
What would be the best class to support a warrior (on alliance) during leveling? Blessing of might is pretty attractive, but a priest wanding stuff down and throwing out a lesser heal or renew every now and then might go faster.
---
If he says its gonna be paid in a week it Will Just be downloader and wont ever sell
---
Run to Stormwind, take tram to IF, outside IF follow this: https://i.imgur.com/Yp1TOPK.jpg
---
But why do it out of the blue less than a week before release?
---
Then it's in your best interests to stop letting them cave on shit. Hang yourself man. 
---
&gt; practically nothing.
---
The fucking point of classic servers is to replicate vanilla. Not to pick and choose what's worth keeping, because you'll just say literally everything about vanilla is "practically nothing" until we'd get to the point where it's not even remotely close to vanilla.
---
That was only possible because of trial accounts.
---
Proposed solution: Dont let trial accounts play classic?
---
You've only gone for 2/3 improved  Blizzard? On the beta people were having trouble without 3/3.
---
I hope you know a good  physiotherapist
---
Um... It does bud... DX12 comes with a whole different set of instructions that older hardware, which predates it's development cannot run.
---
How do you download?
---
WASD
---
1234567
---
qert fg zxcv
---
Shift+ qert fg zxcv
---
probably will go with Alt+ for low level cast
---
B for bags
---
k for karacter
---
j for guild
---
n skilltree
---
u skills
---
F1-F7 for marks
---
shift F1-F7 marks on the ground
---
Battlegrounds will be cross-realms, the ratio is only important for wpvp even though 55/45 is fine
---
Got a screenshot of a reshade on/off from your settings by any chance?
---
Dear Blue,
---
Please don't let the actions of a few change the game for the rest.
---
You could have a friend scout the stormwind/ironforge inns
---
Endgame begins 8/26/19. I've got mad click"enter world" skills
---
Slow grind I'm assuming you knew that when you said "just for fun".
---
Short term annoyance &lt; Long term having what you want.
---
Walk it over to NE area. It's not "optimal" I'm sure, but it's not gonna cripple you in the slightest. If the point is to play together, play together. Also if you can roll a warrior in that zone's race, you can train there fine.
---
Ah yes, the big vanilla brain
---
How do you know the original team didn’t want larger servers? They could of just been limited by technology.
---
Seems the issue is that people were donating to him a lot recently in support of his new guide, and helping him with it. And now they will have to pay again to actually get to see it, so they're left with a bitter taste in their mouths
---
It's like Blizz refused to give warlocks +hit gear... even on legendaries haha
---
Wtf! I totally decided on warlock over a month ago then a week before launch I’m thinking maybe warrior because I know I’ll be long term and wanna focus on PvP...why did I have a sudden change of heart?
---
Main
---
You wont be able to get defensive stance in Teldrassil. If you can login 30 minutes before your GF just run to Teldrassil right away. At level 10 you wait for her to complete her priest quest then you both go to Elwynn. You do your defensive stance q and you both complete Hogger + east vale loggin camp then you are ready for Westfall/Loch Modan.
---
I would pay him if that was an official addon by a blizzard developer but I can't give a random dude money for a free-time created addon. Just feels weird. But I hope he gets some subs or work wirh Blizzard and get an income for his work
---
Wow! That’s awesome that the ingame chat is so relevant. Most games ive played in the past, ive needed a discord or website for LFG needs. Thats super convenient! Is it typical to get into a VC with players or is it just ingame chat communication?
---
speaking from past experience, I think the character select screen is part of the login server. so if you already login then you'll see that, but you may get a queue for the actual server
---
I think you mean you’re “Ready for neck problems.” All jokes aside FIVE MORE DAYS
---
Same. If anything it'll help me stay focused while playing and not get as tired. I'll be walking up at 4ish every morning and play for a little bit,  then hit gym, then come back and play all day.
---
it's an awful idea that isn't even remotely inline with any expressed goal or ideal for classic. 
---
if you like it, that's great. basically nobody else does. so if it's something you genuinely want, you won't be finding it (or support for it) here.
---
Shard of the Fallen Star. Trinket from AQ that summons a fucking meteor.
---
Perfect thank you. I’ll grind the warrior to 4-5 as fast as possible and run over to teldrassil.
---
Normal people have a lot of responsibilities, that's all I'm saying. I'm sure you will be very successful in WoW though, good luck.
---
Rogues are more pvp focused with a more mediocre leveling ability, they have mobility and escapes. Mages are more balanced, and focus on kiting/control for the most part.
---
Both are fine choices if you like their playstyle.

He is, but if he actually does make money? Let's see
---
I have no stake in the matter. I’m fine either way. Removing them doesn’t bother me, nor would an option to hide them.
---
I just can’t wait for Classic, man. I’m not looking for reasons to be unhappy with it, I’m just grateful to finally have it
---
&gt; sounds like you may have grown out of MMOs, I know I couldn’t bare the thought of deleting my characters no matter how bad the expansion.
---
I grew up playing the early editions of D&amp;D where character death was swift and frequent.  I think that shaped my attitude with regards to not getting attached to characters, especially in video games.  That and I tend to solo a lot so I tend not form *community bonds* so I have no social attachments to my characters (or my online identity) either.
---
MMOs are just a game for me, not a *lifestyle* (for want of a better word).
---
Been a female night elf rogue since early vanilla, all until now (as main) Wondering if finding groups will be such a big issue.
---
Thinking of rolling a mage, or warrior but the more I think, the more I lean back to rogue, since I have many memories with the class
---
Whatever people say about engineering, you need to remember that a LOT of those things, either consumables or trinket, have relatively long cooldowns. Like, several people in here are saying that trinkets are invaluable blablabla, but the trinkets in particular have (and probably share) 5 min cooldown. Some other items maybe have even more. Those are not things that are gonna decide every single of your fights.
---
And I mean those are not completely OP either. Activating it won't magically make you win a fight everytime. Plus, very few fights will be actually 1v1, where engineering has the "safest" value.
---
You shouldn't be too worried honestly. And I'm pretty sure unless you're a diehard PvPer, you'll get bored to farm consumables just for occasionally shine in PvP. The people advocating so hard for engineering are probably people that will be able to play the game A LOT, and they feel good about it, so good for them, but it's far from mandatory to have fun in PvP.
---
And just in case you still doubt, most people won't be engineer, let alone use all that stuff on a regular basis. Wow is a game mostly constituted by casuals. Same for all that vocal shit about optimal raids, meme specs and so on. This is not representative of Classic population.
---
For real. Damn that brought me some nostalgia right there lol
---
"more layers than lasagna" fucking lost it
---
The 20-30 grand you could approximate in donations would be dwarfed by a strong business model and solid marketing. I think his biggest mistake was not doing this earlier; before he started streaming the fastest level 60. I can't hate the guy for valuing what he clearly spent years working on himself.
---
Do we know how many servers there are?
---
!remindme 6days
---
Warlock gear gets progressively better long term and they're a beast in PVP that doesn't need a healbot
---
You could do the run at level 1 if you wanted. [Dun Morogh to Menethil Harbor shortcut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtty9M4kaoo)

Awesome advice thank you.

He was going for it apparently but couldn't make it in time. Tbf his Guide is very complex and refined, probably takes ages. I think he's going to release one at some point though.

what is your massive hardon for diplomas
---
you are all over this thread with that tiresome shit
---
shut the fuck up already and go back to academia
---
I don't get why the hit cap isn't 100%. Could anyone explain?
---
Level 60 with full T3.
---
why not both?
---
this one^
---
Warriors are notorious as the most painful, least fun class to level. Maybe tied with paladin for alliance.
---
I got a friend that is debating switching from rogue to priest, likely with hopes of playing shadow as much as possible. 
---
Could some of you kind folks weigh in on this?
---
pure evil exists.
---
Thanks! I'll probably go as a Human Mage, just for that diplomacy. Thank you for your help!
---
Eh can’t blame him. If he stills games like he did when he wrote the guide - I’m sure he needs all the money he can get.
---
European here, never seen it referred to as VC before coming to reddit.
---
Chat? You'll see them running around with you.. In some zones, there will be so many people you'll be waiting for monster respawn so you can complete quests lol 
---
Voice chat is usually reserved for guilds but I mean, if you're chatting (text) with someone and playing with them for a full day theres no harm in asking if they want to use voice chat. I have real life friends that I met 14 years ago just by doing that :)
---
No it's not.
---
If you want 20 minute dungeon runs, I don't think Classic is the game for you.
---
I got my name. No point to text it here
---
what is this a bakery??
---
Honor bots where a thing, you had to pay extra for that iirc.
---
But it was worth it, I quit wow and started up again and refused to level up and gear up.
---
Couple weeks of botting and I had a max level paladin with full PvP gear.
---
Best advice, download discord. Join your servers discord. Use a microphone and chat with people if you can it just type your questions there.
---
 MMO mouse with 12 programmable buttons, then just use some modifers and easy 50 keybinds.
---
I’m caught between the warrior, the warlock, and the mage. I plan on investing a lot of time into the game, and raiding through each phase of content to keep my gear up to date.
---
I enjoy the PvP in WoW more than any other aspect of the game, but I’m trying to figure out which I’d enjoy more. I know that I will be going alliance and playing with a tank centric warrior, two warlocks, and a mage depending on player availability.
---
I’m trying to figure out which class scales better, as I want my time investment to be reflected in my character’s performance.
---
This Will be a long post, so read if you want proper explanation on NE warrior being viable or not..
---
So the dilema here is the Human Racial of +5 wep skill with Swords and Maces.
---
In order to understand why this is so good, you need to look at the **GLANCING** mechanic that exists in WoW classic.
---
For every white damage u deal, there is a 40% chance your attack will **Glance** dealing less damage depending on the mobs defense skill:
---
Mobs lvl 60 have 300 defense skill / mobs lv 61 have 305 defense skill / mobs 62 have 310 defense skill / **mobs 63 have 315 Defense skill (bosses)**
---
**The higher the defense skill of the mob you are fighting the bigger the damage penalty when your attacks glance so:**
---
Considering a wep Skill of 300 ( base for all races withou racials):
---
fighting a mob lv 60-61 you deal 5% less damage when u glance an attack
---
**fighting a mob lv 63 (bosses) you deal 35% less damage when u glance an attack.**
---
This is where Wep Skill comes into effect and why human racials are so good for warriors.
---
**For every extra point of wep skill you have, you reduce the damage penalty of glancing by 4%**
---
**So a Human with 305 wep skill (from racial) will only have a damage penaly of 15% on glancing attacks instead of 35% other races have when fighting bosses**
---
**Thats a 20% more damage on all white attacks that glance(40 % of your attacks) which translates to more dps and as a result more threat generated.**
---
This is the reason why humans are so strong as warriors when fighting bosses, since on normal 60-61 mobs there is no difference at all since the penaly is already at the minimun 5%
---
**HOWEVER**
---
You can still be competitive as a NE for sure and dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
But in order to acomplish this you'd have to Use **EDGEMASTERS HANDGUARDS,** which will give you +7 to wep skill with axes swords and daggers**-**  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) 
---
 When using edgemasters, you will lose 2% hit from Devilsaur set that you could have gotten, you will lack 1% crit chance and some attack power, but at the same time you will have a 7% glancing blow damage reduction instead of 15%. So on 40% of your white attacks against a level 63 target you will do 93% damage on glanced white attacks instead of only 85%.
---
So in the end, even if you loose the hit and crit **you gain more damage**, which makes NE or any other Race competitive with Humans + you get 1% dodge which is always good!
---
**The point is, If you are min maxing , yes you will have to work harder to get these gloves and stuff when humans get this bonus as soon as they create their character , but any warrior race is 100% viable and dont let anyone tell you otherwise.**
---
Lol, he can do what he wants with it.
---
Joana put a lot of effort into that whole thing, people really have nothing to complain about.
---
You... you *demon!*
---
Although this *does* remind me of a time in vanilla when you could mind control enemy players and they'd understand custom (/e \[words\]) emotes, so you could communicate with them one-way then finish it off by buffing them with PW: Fortitude. Casting it broke the mind control but still applied the buff.
---
I helped no end of Horde players in the Barrens like that... I was like the polar opposite of your friend here, a true saint haha
---
By telling them you plan to main spec elemental.
---
I'm alliance main and Mulgore is still the best
---
Shitty move in my opinion...
---
That is what I call real immersion.
---
true f osrs ironman scape ... cant wait to give classic a try.
---
osrs went well so i think classic is gonne be even better.
---
Unless you’re doing it to a streamer.
---
100% chance to get banned tho
---
In classic? What would be the point? No one would PVP,  no one would raid, no one would risk anything. It would just be a server with no level 60s and the population there would do nothing and just stand in stormwind all do doing nothing.
---
Have you ever seen a movie or read a book, and thought to yourself, 'I wish I could watch/read it again for the first time'. Classic is making that possible for a lot of people. I'm sure there are countless people, like myself, who have been avid WoW players since the days of WoTLK. We've heard about the glory days of vanilla, and we regret not getting the chance to experience that time in WoW's history. Most of us, have gone back and dabbled in private servers (which was one of the most enriching gaming experiences of my adult life) but didn't want to ruin the genuine experience with the knowledge that classic was coming. So, yes, a lot of us haven't played classic before, but, it's not just nostalgia that's creating hype for this game, it's nostalgia, and it's the opportunity to experience something old for the first time. For me, it's a chance to go back and experience WoW again for the first time.
---
Keep in mind it's going to be really hard to find uninterrupted farming spots anytime near launch, even with layering. You'll probably end up spending most of your time just leveling normally.
---
He's spent years of his life on this project and values that work. People that work anywhere that isn't an online service for free are called dumbasses.
---
Shadow is strong for PvP, much more limited for PvE.  Most guilds will take one shadow priest to a raid but typically not more than that.  Shadow priest damage is great for "face-melter" burst but not good for sustained boss DPS.
---
That makes a lot of sense for expansions to a game already released.
---
Blizzard doesn't, Blizzard stock holders do.
---
Perfect for me if they can pull it off, which admittedly is a big 'If'.
---
Focus on horizontal progression would surely be a pretty safe bet. Some well-thought out gear to pad out current meme specs until somewhat viable. New raids &amp; Dungeons which don't improve on Naxx, but fall somewhere along the continuum. New events just for the hell of it.
---
Nothing outside of what already exists, just more of it. No trivialising current content. 
---
Man I hope that's how it all pans out, that game would be the fandabidosie.
---
What was he thinking? He literally ruined his reputation for some dollars. People will just go to the thousand other dudes who do the guides for free.
---
I use all my mouse keys for pet control. CTRL scroll for zoom!
---
I mean, maybe. I'm not him, I don't know what he's going through, and I only watch his stream now and again. Last time I tuned in, I just know he was lookin' pretty ill, and he was mentioning updating and rehauling the entire guide. If that comes with a price, so be it. The guy's gotta live. Maybe he even mentioned putting a small price on it on-stream once or twice?
---
I mean, it was free content that nobody was entitled to from the start. Maybe I'm bitter from being in the fanfiction realm, where people sure as hell wanna consume the material you busted your ass to create but have zero desire to pay for it *even with their time*, and all THAT entails is leaving a short comment. But boy do they get upset when you take it all offline, because they feel they're entitled to the material you've created!
---
This obviously isn't the same as that, but both are writing projects that require busting your ass to finish. If people are noticing the literal second Joana puts a paywall on his work, then it's in high demand. If it's so good that everyone wants to use it that badly, then I'm not fussed with the price.
---
I don't disagree that an announcement would be nice, but you've been in this thread: people would just steal his work if he announced anything in advance. Sometimes deception's just what ya need.
---
I have a job. I work in IT.
---
Move along, casual.
---
&gt;$1.8 million.
---
What the fuck.
---
How about opening a portal in Alterac Valley at the starting entrance and asking people to "help summon"? I'm crying tears just typing this!
---
Good luck trying to convince blizzard to release vanilla!
---
I would go with a PvP permadeath-only model, so if you killed by another player, not some random mob, then your character is gone.
---
On top of that, 1 character per server and if your character dies your account is locked from making another character on the server.
---
Hey man, guide is awesome, but is it possible to add something like optional grind to skip the dungeon quests? Like maybe marking them in different color and adding a checkpoint of sorts of how much exp you need to be if you have skipped those quests. Otherwise your guide is pretty good.
---
Split between human or dwarf priest. Fear ward seems so nice but cloth sets and benediction look so much nicer on human + the rep gain is comfy. Anyone got strong opinions to push me in either direction? Does stoneskin have a lot of pve utility? (not planning on pvping much outside of world pvp)
---
This clearly sounds like hunter to me. 
---
- Great leveling
---
- Engaging gameplay (autoshot, pet micro) 
---
- Very good in bgs and World pvp
---
- Perfectly fine in pve for you as a casual and lots of Utility in dungeons
---
Trashy move.

Wtf is VC?
---
So if a company makes a profit in the past, they should no longer charge for their services in the future?
---
Sounds like a really good business model.  You should be a CEO.
---
I mean Warlocks are one of the best PVP classes in the game for classic. Admittedly, it can be situational based on what pet you have out. But with right pet, not much beats em. They are also really good PVE.
---
But yeah if you already have two warlocks, that makes it a bit harder to run.
---
Just shut up and level an Orc Rogue. Thank me later.
---
Wine of Zamorak... what a time to be alive what was.
---
Watching four bald priests slap the shit out of the poor sap you'd lured in with the promise of riches ("you can only pick it up once per day!") was endlessly entertaining.
---
One time I lured a newbie who'd received a rune pickaxe and full rune armour (though it was a skirt... blegh), which was a full upgrade for me from my crappy black armour. I can't believe I was so heartless / ruthless as a 16 year old...
---
REST IN HEAVEN
---
Why do you say that?
---
This is a very specific question, may I ask why you want to know? ^^
---
Unfortunately I don’t remember but I imagine it’s between 1-2s?
---
Calling it a core game component is a bit of a stretch.
---
That guy looks like  A Shit Pie
---
I think it might just be a joke my dude
---
This is shitty.
---
Illidan sure as tits doesn’t worship elune. You’re a racist bigot.
---
I wasn't arguing against that.
---
You want more shamans than priests in a raid though.
---
I guess it lies in the hands of my other hardcore friend if he wants to heal or not (he heals on main). On that note, is healing much different than retail? Aside from downranking
---
Only 1-12 is free. The rest is behind a $5 paywall now.
---
You think you do, but you dont.
---
Leveling warrior solo is not as fun as most other classes. Every single class from the other faction can kill you and you will die 10 times more than any other class.
---
this is great! thanks
---
Duo leveling is basically the same as solo, you just have the option to do some of the harder quests that people would normally skip.
---
I didn’t play WoW back in the day in fact I joined at the end of legion and I’m looking forward to playing classic. Can someone correct me if I’m wrong but aside from the experience of classic is it kind of a waste of time in the end once everything is completed? Ie raids dungeons ,professions ? I would like to know that I could keep playing if anything new happens for classic incase I get bored.
---
Would you also distribute the newest Avengers movie for free?  Take this down.
---
100% Priest. Dungeons are fine if you want to tank here and there but raiding as a warrior tank will be a nightmare without a guild who will take you and use you. 
---
As a healer you can slip in and out of most content.
---
The problem is no other class will provide me the fantasy of big axes or sword and board from 1 to high end
---
Oh the humanity, someone wanting to be compensated for their time.
---
method trying to remain relevant in classic lul
---
Left mouse button.
---
Puppetmaster, Blackbeard and Bladefall
---
Gold sellers kill themselves to spell out their website name with dead bodies
---
That was a fun one. I liked having someone dress as a monk in the edgeville basement
---
It's 5 bucks a month..
---
Paladins can do dps while leveling too and offheal. Judgments provide utility too,
---
it's 5 bucks... just sub and cancel again
---
Probably coz of layering.
---
Incredible for 1vs1 pvp. Only need 1 for a raid, and the role is basically a single debuff (you won't be winning dps meters, and you won't be expected to).
---
1) warrior
---
2) mage for aoe grind. But if you want to actually earn money - you should use Ah. That's where class don't really matters
---
3) in classic gear variety non existent either
---
At least he wasn’t asking for demographics like the other morons 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
So ita a good thing then?
---
Used that exact UI pic to apply for guilds back in the days as I found it overkill to ask for an UI screenshot in applications
---
Actually paladin was fairly well represented. You need to double the paladin/shaman populations to get a good sense for them because they're only on one faction each.
---
MMO mice are so bulky &amp; the shapes tend to be a bit uncomfortable for me! I have small hands &amp; prefer smaller mouse however I would kill for like 2 extra button
---
eaven with cross-realms they will pop faster
---
Except for all those times a mage stacked a portal to Darnassus on top of the Ironforge portal at the end of the raid night.
---
While I share the skepticism, we don't know what the classic team would be capable of here. In fact, all signs so far point to them being very responsive to community requests and feedback.
---
I can't see why it would be such a huge drain on resources either. For me, I'd be more than happy with the odd new dungeon here, a new zone there, that kind of thing.
---
Throw in some new items along the way, some of which aimed to buffing some of the meme specs and we're good to go.
---
Im sure none of this stuff is trivial in itself but it's hardly designing a new xpac, just give us a new non-progression raid and some new items once a year, maybe a dungeon / battleground / event / whatever every 6months or so?
---
I'd imagine that'd be feasible and wouldn't give much scope for tarnishing classic as it stand, in my opinion at least.
---
hes been getting donations and a patreon the entire time hes been doing it. and he used his discord members countless times to check over stuff in his guide. Hes a scumbag.
---
how much of a hassle is this?
---
gnomes on sabers look cool but I will not be able to afford tens or hundreds of more hours to spend just on rep gain maxing.
---
Yes. That's what I'm doing now and it is fun
---
You have my support good sir
---
Everything happened...  I'm just trying to get you to realise that just because you experienced it in your upper middle class environment, doesn't mean the majority of people did.
---
Most children playing vanilla had no clue what they were doing.  It took ~100 days to clear MC.
---
It is probably not that hard to code in a simple skeleton location randomizer.  They already know where the skeleton gets created, it's quite simple to move it and rotate it between a random small number set.   That way no one can spell anything and we get as many corpses as we need.
---
It's his local copy from Monday. Was free at the time of the backup.

God people are greedy -_-
---
Then it's probably old as fuck and still probably comes under blizzards tos zygor was far more efficient anyway.
---
lol, classy.
---
TY
---
Ofc they would, they would also download a car
---
I would be much more open to distributing Avengers than this. Disney wouldn't even know but Joanas might need tornado insurance payments.
---
Anything for Horde?
---
&gt;Plus as others have said a medium server today is larger than the most crammed server in OG vanilla so even if your server drops down to that after a few months after launch you'll be fine.
---
Yep exactly, stay off herod and don't come back.
---
But if the ratio across servers is 55:45 in favour of Horde that means there will be more Horde than Alliance overall. Which in turn will mean Alliance will have shorter queue times for battlegrounds?
---
So? You still REALLY think an 11 year old wouldn't have been able to search on fucking Google?
---
Just do one of the “challenges” I’ve seen around, exercises on FPs, on deaths etc
---
Holy fuck just go to the gym for an hour
---
And when GMs removed skeletons of individual characters they went the multiple-character route, and when that didn't work out they actively formed different words and signs like a billboard made out of flying gnomes which was even more distracting since it usually covered the entrance to the bank and/or AH.
---
Theres only one way
---
0/10
---
I'm saying they wouldn't have thought to, because Google wasn't much of a thing.
---
They said "other than the Wetlands run" so not many other options
---
that would be awesome.  
---
\-create new character  
---
\- level a couple of levels  
---
\-fight random boar

\-miss,miss,dodge,dodge,miss. / random mob joins the fight!  
---
\-dies to random boar of same level/gangbanged.  
---
\-repeat process.
---
The pack of nerds in this thread losing it over $5 a month is another matter. It's not that big a deal.
---
Simply writing the code may be easy, but getting some code on your machine all the way into the productive environment is a lot more difficult. That's what people don't seem to understand, there's a lot more that goes into changing something than "write the code lol".
---
I dunno if players will bring the retail mentality to vanillla. However I played Rogue / Hunter in Vanilla. Never had issues getting groups with either class.
---
Just remember though, rogues in vanilla (melee in general) had it rough on many fights. I think it adds a level of skill to the class, but it does mean some bosses will be harder to find a group for vs others.
---
Look at this dood.
---
But even if they did it because they didnt think it mattered, the way they changed it is objectively unhelpful.
---
Drawing with skeletons has never been a problem - meaning they are fixing a non-issue in lieu of the actual issue. If you google "WoW spelling with corpses" you will find literally dozens of images of people doing just that; which is something this change doesnt fix.
---
I challenge you to find me even a single image of people doing the same thing with skeletons
---
Just because YOU didn't doesn't mean OTHERS didn't, though. I used Thottbott regularly as an 8 year old, search machines weren't unknown.
---
My friend told me about this yesterday, and I didn't think anything of it. I check out this thread on reddit and now I'm disappointed.
---
This fucking sub, man. Lol.
---
Yeah F us for making posts talking about stuff that we want changed. We should instead only make appreciation posts for how good the AMA was that'll make change for the better!!
---
Removed my patreon sub, removed my twitch sub, removed my bookmarks.  What the fuck, Paul.  I have no problem paying for this with some earnest forewarnings but you fucking lied to everyone when you said they would be free.  You were getting $8 a month from me between twitch and patreon and now you’re getting nothing.  You’re going to learn a lesson in fucking with your fans.
---
Krol Blade first world drop masterrace!
---
Use them then and move on, stop complaining
---
Yup i have no idea
---
We'll see. But as things stand the demographics survey shows that 53% of players are going to roll Horde. Also worth noting that Undead and Orc will make up 35% of ALL classes both factions combined. 
---
Although this doesn't speak for the entire community, being that the sample data size is over 50,000 it is probably quite accurate.
---
The Boys
---
It absolutely doesn't matter for you. Tbh, even if you were a bit more hardcore it wouldn't matter that much.
---
Kenny is the one to look after for world first though. He was 2nd first 60 on ND (due to getting camped by the #1's guild ofc), and he's in Progress the guild that got first MC on the server at day 10. Progress definitely has a strong chance of winning the race.

I just got the idea from the AMA that they very much know what they are doing and are well prepared for this server wise . They released new servers before release .. they will do so again . They are trying to maximize server survivability.  They also mentioned that the hardest part was everyone being in the exact same place which is where layering helps the most. Even spread out over one zone they said it is way more manageable. Worst case scenario they will offer a free transfer just like the old days . (I was Frostwolf got a free transfer to Frostmane because of overpop.)
---
Me and some friends used to summon people off of a cliff at the top of Hyjal and they would fall to their deaths.
---
Stop the mentally of thinking you will be behind. Classic is not a race to end game. The levels 1-60 is the game. Just enjoy the journey, work on professions as you level, and play the AH. Take the time to meet people and help others while questing. I met alot of cool people during Vanilla while PvPing at the Crossroads from my mid 40’s on up. Later on, I Was invited to their raiding guild. So just enjoy the gameplay and things will fall into place as you go 👍🏻👍🏻
---
Yeah you're fucked
---
It depends entirely on what field you are wanting to enter.  Diplomas are a way to get your foot in the door. Experience is how you get more money, not the other way around like OP suggested.

Its 8am and this is probably the dumbest comment i will read all day.

After flip flopping like crazy between all classes I have landed on rogue. This means I can pvp quite nicely while leveling so it doesn't get too boring.
---
Dunemaul Horde here from Fearsome War Engine, can't wait to get back into it!

This is true but I'm not going to defend Blizzard on this either. I don't need to white-knight for multi billion dollar corporations with legal teams to match.

True, they only had 15 years of content to pull the names from, and it's not like the re-release of the biggest game every is a big deal
---
A ranking system that is 95% about how much time you put into it, almost zero skill, is not flawed?
---

---
Yeah osrs has been a very positive experience for the most part.
---
Unfortunately the game started dying 6-12 month ago, mobile hurt it a lot. The big problem is that a lot of the casual players became much louder and unfortunately this has let to a lot of ezyscape. This has a double negative of pushing away long term players while encouraging more casuals, accepting more ezyscape in a big downward spiral.
---
It used to be “vote no by default until new content is properly fleshed out, balanced, long term impact considered and everything justified” now the masses have moved to “vote yes unless it’s especially heinous”. It makes for sloppy content that doesn’t make sense, isn’t balanced and just devalues other stuff.
---
Note: mobile in itself is wonderful, it just attracted the “wrong” crowd to start playing again. Yes I’m aware subs/player counts are at a high point; but it’s the peak before the fall. Most of the late game players are getting tired of the direction and are looking to jump ship. Heck the entire TOB world record team is jumping to classic.
---
Haha I’m the same. I’ve been getting a lot of chunky things out of the way. Densit check up. HVAC service. Small repairs around the house. The cars are serviced. The dog is going to the vet this week. I gave the house a deep clean. I want no distractions after launch. Haha
---
Both would happen, really only one they can stop easily
---
Whoops, you are right. He's just before Rivendare!
---
Who cares?? The gold is coming from another player. Not a Chinese good farmer. If it’s your gold and you want to give it away for gold on retail it’s REALLY not that big a deal. Y’all need to calm down
---
You mean my download folder?
---
&gt;only need Tank
---
That's a phrase we should all get used to seeing.
---
They did it in Stormwind as well so Gamon wasn't the reason they could do it. They used hacks, always, and most of the time not skeletons but actual corpses. Orcs in Org, Gnomes in SW. Got some screenshots of it on my PC, as well as live billboards of flying Gnomes.
---
&gt;What was he thinking?
---
"I'm hungry and need to afford food"  might be close to what he was thinking.
---
He never said that, his stance has always been that most of the guide will go behind a paywall.
---
&gt; Sure it isn't the same but it does make more sense to me.
---
This is how you get gold tokens in Vanilla.
---
Nice walk down memory lane! Yeah I had fun finding my old characters and friends on there as well.
---
Yeah...no phone autocorrects spelled to spelt... You just don't know how to spell. It's okay.
---
Gonna be a casual player, planning to pvp and raid when I can. Was originally thinking rogue, but pretty sold on NE hunter due to the easier leveling experience / opportunity to farm gold. Seems like a fun class to play, but a couple of concerns:
---
1. I understand later on in vanilla DPS drops off in raid groups, is it THAT significant that it’d be hard for me to get a spot with just a casual / semi-hardcore group? (I’m fine with not being top DPS)
---
2. Ammo / food for pet. How annoying is it resupplying all of this? I was thinking of having a bank alt mail me a stream of ammo and food so I wouldn’t have to travel as far.
---
Fuck I absolutely love pfQuest and it changed my experience after having to use that shitty questie add-on.. sucks to hear it won't be around.
---
Having to pay a sub doesn't mean a community doesn't exist. Not sure what you're getting at.
---
What are you talking about? Joanasworld.com, I can see the full guides...
---
Thanks for this brother
---
 Join a guild while leveling up. You’ll be there for a while. Make some friends...hang out...do stuff together....when you hit 60 go raid together I promise your pals won’t tell you to gtfo because of your spec.
---
This is how things worked out back then and is a lot of the reason why people want classic.
---
That makes absolutely no sense. What would they hope to gain from pandering to anyone over skeletons?
---
&gt; you really care far too much about this very trivial issue.
---
Why are you even here.  Go back to BFA baby.
---
pfQuest along with pfUI is awesome... classiccordex+elvui will do the trick I’m sure, but it wont be the same.
---
You mean i cant spent 5 hours making new characters so i can spell "Trump 2020" in orgrimmar just so it gets removed when im almost done? I thought this was America.

I find explaining what benefits you can bring to the table in terms of like CC to be useful.  Not sure how Elemental is in vanilla but you can point out if your healer gets swarmed by mobs you can Thunderstorm enemies away from the healer.

I have absolutely no issue with someone trying to monetize their hard work. Speed leveling is for turds anyways.
---
People jerk off to slow weapons too much, fact is that most instant attacks are normalized and attack speed doesn't matter outside of getting lucky godlike burst.
---
Yes...he has the rights over the product of his time and labor....

This is like super basic foundational legal theory.

This is still a problem BUT. not as much as a problem 14 years ago, they doubled the debuff limit an enemy can take.
---
The rep is the easiest part actually. The guilds mages can aoe farm it and get done in like 5 hours. The hardest part is getting 40 people no life enough to get 60 or close, and to have one warrior super no life so he can spend a day gearing up in dungeons.
---
Thank you!
---
Hes not. he is profiting off of the product of his time and labor, which 100% belongs to him.
---
Its messed up that he is doing this, but he isnt legally doing anything wrong.
---
It was definitely considered an easymode game in the EQ community. What do you mean, the quests just tell you what to do? You don't have to decipher some obscure message and guess where "the place where corruption dwells" is?! Wait, all classes can level to 60 *alone?* What keeps the socially inept people from hitting the endgame if they never need help with anything?!
---
Wait, *what?!* You don't even have to recover your corpse alive and naked, you become an invulnerable ghost? Is this game literally for infants?!
---
He's been streaming the fact that he has been working on updated guides in beta.  There probably aren't too many changes though.  It could just be to drum up publicity for it.
---
Druid "Clawandorder"
---
Hmmm I don't think warrior is a good idea. Tbh its one of the only classes I never levelled between Vanilla &gt; WOTLK. But they were notoriously bad for levelling in Vanilla.
---
As you didn't explicitly exclude Hunter or Warlock, I'd recommend either. They both have somewhat engaging gameplay. Hunters have a rotation to max dps, locks have to juggle debuff timers and lifetap. Both are solid at levelling (lot of fun). Both are awesome at dungeons and battleground PVP.
---
My mistake, I misread it's intention in my morning stupor then.
---
Addons that let's you search for groups doesn't automate player input.

Thats sorta awesome! (assuming you successfully survived the run).  The sorta thing you can laugh about.  After.  With a stiff drink in hand.  A shaking, PTSD hand.

Doesn't stack with Pursuit of Justice on my Paladin.  I rock glasses for full character immersion.  So yes...there is a point to me asking.

No one was interested in your intermittent fasting schedule so that you can still eat McDonalds at 9 PM...
---
This Mankrik's wife thing is silly. It's just a meme. The location will be up on Wowhead, there's no real way to recreate what you want.
---
I do agree with the war effort though, since guilds stockpiling all the mats from day 1 and turning it all in as soon as AQ starts is definitely not an authentic experience. I hope they reconsider this.
---
Fika is important to know.
---
Not necessarily the fastest, but I suppose *least painfully*. Character will be abandoned the minute they ding 60.

He made 1.8 million total already with his guides. Also I don't mind paying for it, I mind having to subscribe for it.

---
BFA is designed like a mobile game, with cash shop in mind, gamedesign second. Vanilla was designed to be a good game in his time, gamedesign first and money would come as a natural consequence.
---
So is paywalling them 5 days before release after stating they’re going to stay free
---
Dude same. I love playing rogue but i wont really have time to lvl an alt and i dont want to be stuck with only being dps. Im so conflicted.
---
How often do you get headaches from neck strain?
---
I liked the idea of pally. I like playing classes that bring utility, I don't mind pulling lower numbers in exchange for bringing buffs and niche abilities groups want so pally filled that role to me well, I could tank 5 mans or be a top tier healer for pvp and all pve content.
---
New servers opened and I managed to get the names I wanted, more specifically, the name of a certain troll Loa. So now I'm going horde to use my names properly and my choices for a support/niche class on horde, more specifically a troll, are Shaman.
---
I think I will probably lean towards shaman but I like to dps, its what I've always done which is why I was also considering Mages as they bring some utility while still performing well. I just worry about fighting for group spots with all the dps running around.
---
Hey hey, where's Bloodsail Buccaneers!? RPers exist too! There's at least three, maybe even four of us.
---
Talk about a bad PR move. I get what he was doing streaming his speedrun for credibility and then charge people for the guide but it comes across as scummy locking a guide that has existed in some form for 13 years for free behind a paywall. Such better ways of monetizing if your more clever about it. Oh well plenty of ways to get around it and plenty of other updated guides.

Lorewise resurrection is exceptionally rare, so the skeletons you see after coming back to life are previous adventurers who failed, and not actually you. You never died, you succeeded.
---
Recently listened to him talking on Countdown To Classic episode 50. Seemed like a really dedicated and nice guy in all honestly. The paywall was a surprise after hearing him speak, but i get it. - If it's going to be a living for him, then why not i guess
---
does this work for vanilla too?
---
you’re probably looking for a real answer rather than jokes like others have commented so:
---
You’ll be fine. i have mained healer and was a big fisherman in WoW and never had a problem. contested spots like Aszhara bay of storms are big enough for everyone, and honestly most times people fishing aren’t looking for a fight.
---
It is a big deal considering it is part of classic and they are taking that away.
---
yeah you are right which is why my comment still makes sense...
---
My 1 account is counting for 3 people but to blizzard it is still only 1 person, therefore many other people may do this and just with name reservations alone the playerbase could easily double with reserving names for friends.
---
More Hakkar folks! I don't even recall my guild from Classic but mained a Holy Pally back then.

Orc makes for such a bad rogue aesthetic tho
---
You've been in the basement too long boyo. You've forgotten how to communicate like a human being. Nobody has a gun to your head, you don't have to read every comment. Thanks for the laugh tho
---
Yes, they do. As does razor synapse.
---
Either leave it untouched or Classic + new content and events. The rest, a big nope for me. I'd love to have a TBC server too, but separated from Classic and being able to copy and paste my classic character.
---
 Just use an addon like Questie. I don't see why you would need a guide beyond that. Since if you are asking about leveling and haven't practiced and planed out everything already you are probably not attempting to rush to 60 at an insane speed.
---
 Basically Questie is going to show questgivers and mark up objectives. Just clear out everything in your path and as you are moving between objectives, kill any mob you see. It will be plenty fast. 
---
 Also personally I find guides are extremely disruptive to fluid gameplay but that is of course just my own opinion. I don't like having to check the guide nonstop for every little decision I take. Should I pick up this quest? Can I move to this area? Can I do the quests in this order? etc.
---
I'll have my tuxedo ready promptly.

Maybe I didnt get them until burning crusade, but I spent a lot of time farming troll quests to get them back in the day and I definitely had a raptor before WotLK
---
People take exception to the strangest things on here sometimes.

As if a teenager can't decide whether they still enjoy a game or not. Mad.
---
Just go to your logitech thing, make the macro keys do "right ctrl+num1" etc. instead of "G1". Rebind ingame.
---
I love it because im sick of how the movie industry is oversaturated with super hero movies.  I ddint care about avengers at all when it came out.  The only super hero movie I liked was watchmen because of how different it was.  The boys was very anti super hero.
---
Rather have queue at the beginning than a dead server at the end.
---
Ive played original Vanilla and been playing on private servers since 2015, i think i know what im getting into.
---
I would love to see new content added while keeping the classic mechanics and class play.
---
Noice
---
&gt; I may be reading into this too much
---
I think you are. I'd say they probably have a set date for Phase 2 with willingness to push it back, but will not release it any sooner than originally planned.
---
The 1.12 client you're using is 15 years behind the client used for classic, so don't use it for anything related, as nothing is the same.
---
DM? You mean Dire Maul?
---
Probably on Vimeo to avoid copyright strikes on his channel for the licensed music.
---
I see that and its totally justified saving the guide while it was free but shitting on him that he monetized his site is wrong
---
I want to see a survey of the prename registrations. the actual distribution of factions.

Day 8 Patch Notes!
---
I've heard you and I am listening to the community! You guys like the orginal formula I'll stick to the original formula :) 
---
Changelog-
---
* Day 2: Changed "2 Sides at War" for "2 Faction War" - still trying to find the best fit.
---
* Day 5: After many requests to do so, changed "5 Corehound Packs" to "5 Man Dungeons" &amp; updated image. You may not like it, but this is what peak female performance looks like.
---
* Day 7: Updated "7 Elves a Hoppin'" to "7 Dwarven Ghosties" &amp; updated image.
---
* Added Day 8 - The original gangstas
---
Thanks to /u/shaun056 for the idea to call these patchnotes!

For those not aware, this is a parody of the song '12 Days of Christmas'. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwutPrR-9YM
---
Do you want a hunchback orc or standing up straight orc? Female all the way.
---
I mooched off this guys guide for years on pservers. Don’t blame him at all for asking a few dollars for compensation.
---
$5 for 1 month? The least I can do is buy this guy a beer for all the time he’s saved me levelling.
---
I personally hate anything that increases the need for mobile phone usage. If i can type few letters with my keyboard i don't want my phone to log into the game for me. Also having everything tied to your mobile phone makes losing it much worse.
---
True
---
Can you please record all of those bank alts jumping down the twin colossals in feralas once the fel cloth price crashes?
---
Because different members of that team have said so multiple times that the realms were smaller than the servers could handle due to it being a design decision.
---
the queue bypass got fixed not far into BC, iir but the tech improved and i haven't really seen a queue since BC, either.
---
It's super dumb. Don't get me wrong, I loved the atmosphere the persistent skeletons created, but I remember it being a problem on my server in vanilla. You'd see RMT site URLs displayed outside of stormwind pretty commonly. 
---
Here's the thing: the skeletons lose their charm pretty fast when your main interaction with them is looking at an eyesore ad.
---
They arrange them in such a way to spell out words
---
Where did you get that number from? The Only survey I have seen had a response amount of at least 20k
---
Troll
---
That is unexpectedly civilized from a hunter.
---
Should I reroll Prot Pally?  Do you think the guild would be okay with that?
---
It's a fetish. People on Shazzrah love it apparently :)
---
Opening salvo for IP infringement is generally a cease and desist, not a law suit: they ask you to stop first.
---
For the reasons of survival. Alliance is more about power play than survival.
---
But you know what? Life is pain, hope fails.
---
Female troll if you want to stand upright and have the better pve racials.  
---
Undead if you want to have the better pvp racials.
---
Cool man, stick your head in the sand. Ignore reality and the fact that this is going to be vanilla, not retail. Why would they change core game design just because? The realm caps are what the game was designed to hold, it is a system that while a technical limitation at the time was designed around. The whole game breaks if they change it, it just makes no sense.
---
Translation: Players CAN transfer, but they've got to do it LEGALLY!!
---
Then it's just a word play. Let me edit my post.
---
Yeah you can save a whole 2 extra minutes off his last guide 😂 such wow
---
Put them entangling roots to good use
---
Doubtful blizz would release that info.
---
I don't give a fuck about the legalities of it but I agree it's a dick move. I think he was in a great spot leading into Classic to be quite influential. I don't think that $5 is money-grabby though and I really don't care if people "steal" it but I am much more against "stealing" from individuals vs massive corporations.

Please recommend better ones

Priest ofc. Nothing better than just waterwalking and fishing all the nodes where the plebs need to follow the shore. Just bring enought feathers.

troll is better in pve, undead is better in pvp.
---
What is the financially most successful monetization model for games right now again? Ah right it's called **freemium**.
---
16 slots shared by 40 players is still something to account.  
---
Warlock and their curses, Priest &amp; Druid with their DoT, etc.  
---
That's why I would like to know what debuff has priority over an other, so I can tell if a debuff is hindering only the performance of the one who tried to apply it, or if it hindered everyone because it replaced a better debuff.
---
I think ally warlock issues are negligible, honestly. Ain't nobody got time to mix-max that shit! But jokes aside, even with WotF, you're gonna run into a lot of mediocre or bad forsaken players, so...you can still beat them down if you so choose. ;)
---
As far as the rogue goes, the perks of being a gnome are pretty much the racials and your size. Being little can be useful to get in places some of the bigger races can't. For the dopes who play without nameplates up, you might even be difficult to see unstealthed until you're close! FWIW I think there are gonna be more warriors and rogues out there than mages and druids, so if that influences your decision at all... Stoneform is really nice, too; it lets you get off a clean vanish. I don't think you can go wrong with either, but if you want people to rage when you gank 'em, gnome's the way to go. :')
---
Well... Yes, that's what I mean with alliance of convenience.
---
&lt;------  Cries Holy Paladin tears watching the rogue vanish while still attempting to regain mana while also attempting to control my PTSD from the hunters pet attacking everything in sight.  NOOOOooooooo

Can I get an F in chat for the five corehound packs?
---
Hey bud, you should take a look at this if your concerned of that.  There are definitely a few items.  You will want to read it to understand why and when to pick them.  Some are shared as quest rewards and there can be only one of each per player etc.

So I was going to play a mage. I decided this months ago. I was super excited to pew pew frostbolts and shit. Come testing weekend I started leveling a mage and got to level 5.  I didn’t want to ruin the questing experience so I decided to try out a priest. God damn now I can’t get the priest out of my head. It was fun as hell. I don’t have a question. Just confused as to what to do

Macros speed up your gameplay. Let's say I am playing a druid and want to use dash, instead of pressing cat form -&gt; dash, you can have this sequence in a macro in 1 button.
---
On another class like Hunter a common macro can be feign death -&gt; freezing trap
---
This is utterly wrong. It’s the BFA client stripped down and altered. They have not rebuilt the old client, they’ve said this on a number of occasions.
---
I'm on Gehennas, playing Horde. Think it's pretty balanced.
---
If your playing with a friend, going mage may not be bad for group content especially if he picks a class that can tank or heal as you will tag along. 
---
Warlocks are a solid choice but you are correct in pvp, if you want to be really good your pet choice will matter. You can get by just sticking to one pet but you will perform much better if you manage your pets for the pvp situation your in.
---
Priest is also good. I think it will depend what your friend rolls which will help push you towards which class to play but if your friend wasn't playing I'd pick Priest
---
Hold up. You're missing the nice aesthetic piece and I think we all know the orange swift raptor is 10/10 aesthetic.
---
Yeah you all take that extra 2 minutes he cut off and charges money for what a joke lmao.
---
You didn't click wrong, it was à bug that entered you wrong
---
If I'm not mistaken the 2 hour trade window for soulbound gear wasn't in Vanilla so they really don't do #NoChanges.
---
They make more with the token though. Think of the management!!  That ceo can’t get another yacht... the poor thing.
---
That probably isn't the worst idea.  STV is such good exp though.

I got to server first Max Fishing in WotLK by fishing in Orgrimmar.
---
The drawback i would imagine is that if you play a less popular class all those wanna be “pro players” will exclude you from groups bc they’re idiots 
---
They even do that in retail where the game is balanced
---
5 Warlocks should do just fine.
---
Come dwarf and orc are pretty rad.
---
They can do all 3 for sure. If the leveling part is your concern and you don’t care about end-game raiding then you’re good to go.
---
lol that's funny, i haven't even thought of what i'll do next time i go fishing! O.O
---
&gt;_&gt; You need enchanting/Tailoring to make that viable
---
&gt; Classic wow doesn't even support multithreading I think only 2-3 cores
---
So it does support multithreading?
---
Unpaid vacation is a thing! ;)
---
We all play for different reasons, stop being illogical.  I am playing to experience AV and massive PvP battles.  I did the leveling  experience, MANY MANY times.  There isn't anything I am re-living that I didn't already do a ton of times when it was current content. 
---
I was one of the first to clear MC/BWL/AQ/Naxx on Kil'Jaeden.  I leveled multiple toons, all of them were geared.  I don't miss any of that.  What I miss is massive meaningful objective based PvP.
---
I've got a priest friend and anyway there will be tons of shamans and priests around
---
He never said it would be free 1-60.
---
Why even comment?
---
Of course I know him, he’s me!
---
genius i like u
---
Yes the abundance of rogues was very annoying in vanilla!
---
Warrior or Warlock. Now, the warrior is a lot more fun personally but warlock has a lot more utility/quality of life. Let me expand.
---
I'm afraid I won't be good enough to raid as a warrior. As a tank I'm 100% sure the competition will be too high while as a DPS I think you need to do Slam weaving stuff to perform well (I only played Paladin in Classic and when I played a warrior in later expansions I didn't bother with that stuff).
---
Warlock on the other hand would be a lot more lax since it's rDPS and you essentially have Shadow Bolt to spam. This becomes a double edged sword as the combat isn't as intriguing.
---
So I'd 100% choose the warrior if I knew I was good enough to raid with it. The earliest I tanked with the warrior was 5M HCs by the end of TBC (melee taunt is painful, can't imagine how hard it should be to deal with it in a 40M environment). 
---
So what it comes down to is - Warrior would be more fun but what if I suck too much and won't be able to raid at which point raiding as Warlock would become more fun than potentially not raiding as a Warrior.
---
100%! That, imo, is the best thing about Classic wow. You can truly make it your own. Wanna follow the entire time and rush to max level? Do it up. Want to take your time and spend 1.5 years leveling up because you keep taking breaks to RP? More power to ya! I almost died the night before BfA came out. I was in the hospital. BfA might've been literally the last game I ever played. I don't want to tell anyone how to play Classic because it might be *their* last time playing a game, too, and who am I to make a judgement call on it's enjoyed? Freedom is classic's biggest strength imo.
---
You want a pvp realm. If your not interested in doing RP pick a PvP realm. PvP realms right now are the most popular realms and you will find no shortage of groups forming to go raid cities or zones and start big fights.
---
hahhahaha, what a fucking greedy bastard, thanks for the guide mate, I'll be sure to gank Joana 100% of my time

Pfquest is now called ClassicCodex

I'm sure they have built layers with a soft cap of x players with a possible actual cap of y players and it's unlikely you'll ever run into an issue with it.
---
Baron Rivendare's Deathcharger. I farmed UD Strat so long on my NE Warrior back in the day only to lose it both times it dropped. Since my group has decided to go back to Alliance, it is still my only hope for a skeletal horse. Hoping for some good luck this round.
---
Would you be willing to share your planned route for other people interested in doing dungeon levelling with a group?
---
Or the boomkin unstealthing behind you and starfiring you for 110% of your HP :S
---
No changes
---
Your inability to properly assess a situation isn't surprising.
---
Not sure how I'm acting smug, but ok.
---
And I agree. If something does not work as expected during testing, that should be reported. But the posts that have gained traction on this subreddit has been more to the effect of "Look how layering works, it's not the way they said! Classic is ruined!!!11"
---
Who fucking cares?

Does anyone know how good/bad the azeroth auto pilot classic addon is?

Vanquished tentacle of cthun

I got one back in vanilla and it was always a fun item to flop out unexpectedly :p

... and finally go to bed.

What AMA were you reading, they did a great job at going over layering, it was their longest and most detailed response.  That’s why people are yelling about skeletons and not layering right now... which I agree is a change that’s not worth yelling about.
---
I think he saw all the twitch donations/subs and got greedy af real quick. Plus if this takes off and alot of people do pay blizzard will stop it. And he wont be able to produce TBC or Wotlk
---
God I hope so. I am excited to be playing on a packed server.
---
Between that and hate speech, which general chat trends towards anyway, I can give up a little atmosphere in stranglethorn.
---
It's funny how MMO's grew to become more casual and easily accessible, with less time investment, and then when the genre began to fail people spouted about how it's caus everyone is too old and doesn't have the time to play. Then they just double down on making everything more watered down and the cycle continues. 
---
MMOs and RPGs have been dogshit for years because the high-action twitchy gogogogo playstyle is anathema to what an RPG is at its core.
---
There are better guides. One mentioned in this very thread proved faster 1-30 on the beta than any of Joanas runs...
---
Ooooooh you're making me real mad.
---
Imagine needing an alt to respond because you're too much of a coward.
---
that comment has instantly been saved. Thank you very much. Maybe I can buy you a drink if this guide really helps :)
---
How about you stop being such a boot licker and not worry so much that other people can have constructive conversations that involve criticism.
---
Having done this on private servers you have to decide what do you really want to play. Somebody did the math and the opportunity cost is like 3k gold. Basically if you don’t farm at least 2-3k hold BEFORE you level your warrior, you wasted your time and would have been better off simply playing your warrior from the start.
---
Good thing those are my main professions
---
Why would you not complain about all the shit you want? That’s how we got rppvp servers and much more. This post seems dumb
---
No it does not.
---
[I have these 3 characters](https://i.ibb.co/9ppXwjh/classicchars.png), and I'm not really sure which one to go with. I am one of those people who care a lot about having a cool name &amp; character look as well, so that weighs quite a bit in the decision as well.  
---
**Mage** - Probably least likely, since I really want to level it with AoE grinding, and that's gonna be impossible at release I think. It is the best for farming though, so a likely candidate as the second char I level.  
---
**Warrior** - I love the look/name I got here, so this is definitely a strong contender. It's also by far the most popular class and slow to level, so that counts a bit against it. I really dig the play style though.  
---
**Druid** - The least popular class in WoW, which is a plus in my opinion. I already play a pretty decent druid thanks to pservers, and with powershifting being improved in Classic, I think I could take it to the next level. Also got a cool name on her.
---
Incorrect

Mankrik- forever alone
---
maybe its just to early in the year for skeletons.. i mean its not even september let alone october.
---
Fair point.  It crossed my mind while I was filling out the table that I would not not migrate past WotLK if given the choice.  However, maybe others liked Cata?  Seems doubtful..
---
Gonna record a long flight path and video edit my dick in so it looks like my character is riding a flying penis. Just for you.
---
&gt;  I was wondering if I will have trouble fishing at contested spots where the rarer fish are due to my spec 
---
I spent a lot of time fishing on private servers as well in back in the day. People will gank you if you are standing out in the open but you can always sneak away to less crowded spots in the zone. If you are far from any quest objectives you are going to be able to fish in relative peace.
---
No indication that it's a fan just that they are amazed it's advertised on the big screen. Although fans of idols have been know to use these screens for birthday messages to their favorite idol
---
And the escort that someone starts before everyone gets the quest, every damn time.
---
If you think it is gonna be as bad as pserver launches then you have 2 options. Camp 1 mob respawn or do a death run across zones for exploration xp.
---
But I'm pretty sure the above won't happen with dynamic respawns.
---
I enjoyed this in Vanilla, like the post says it was an immersion thing.  IMO to police it just let people report where said messages are, Blizz I'm sure can look at death logs and see if there is an account or character death pattern in said zone or even city. Then monitor and discipline said account. This, like I have seen before, puts policing into the hands of players some and lets us help Blizz keep classic....classic.
---
Welp, you can think of worse things? That’s compelling, you’ve convinced me. I’m deeply sorry if I caused any offence. I shall grow thicker skins and a tighter butthole, following you’re example.
---
I play at work, so I'll be useless next week
---
The AmA reply itself states "Individual players leaving **multiple** skeletons" can lead to bad behavior. It'll be like  
---
I die, I leave a skeleton when I res. I die again, the first skeleton despawns and I leave another one.   
---
It used to be: I die, I leave a skeleton, I die again, I leave another one, and another one, etc.   
---
Meaning if 36 people die and ress and then don't immediately die again, there will still be 36 skeletons laying there for a long time :)
---
Thanks, you said it better than I could.
---
in that case, my non-expert opinion is you'd probably have a better experience with a pocket tank and/or DPS. Resto solo sounds pretty rough.
---
There's enough people making free guides 😉

When this subreddit was first made it was pretty much all private server players and it was no where near as bad as it is now. It's been going downhill ever since retail players moved over en masse.

Have a look on craigslist or Facebook marketplace for a cheapd desktop with an i5 or i7. Here in southern Ontario, Canada I was able to get one with 8gb of ram for 150, I then bought a used gtx 1050 for 100 and had a fairly decent rig for 250 bucks. I also have dual 22 inch monitors used both for under 80 as well as gaming keyboard (g710) and mouse (g600, highly recommend and goes on sale often) from Logitech. Got a pretty nice setup for well under 500.
---
Honestly I have no clue I hope you find your answer though. From what I heard there is less AOE healing in Classic? There may be more differences
---
Na the pdf keeps getting posted to new
---
Really, thanks
---
Hahaha, perfect. You're right though, it's not like the room is messy, in fact it's oddly well kept so those things definitely stand out.
---
I'm European and I've always called it DM and Dire Maul by the N/E/W method. The Dead Mines missoon in WC were a bit frustrating for me as a kid, and I feel like it's only fair to call it DM in honour of that, ever since late '05.
---
It works for me it's just slow
---
DMe or DMw or DMn. DM is always gonna be deadmines
---
Actual gear having meaning &gt; fancy scrapbook
---
I don't know who'd use a guide to level anyway. Maybe in the early years it was something that could be useful but now it's all just so easily available.
---
It would be really cool to see Classic progress with all of the content that wasn't added, but portals to it could be found in the world:
---
\- Azshara's Crater BG
---
\- Hyjal Raid (I had some cool ideas with this one, such as the first fight being a dreadlord council that was resistance based, three dreadlords and one infernal as bosses. Each doing a different elemental damage to the tank, and one doing unmitigated damage (chaos magic) so you would need a druid tank for the very high HP. The infernal is obviously fire, another could be nature/poison, and the last frost. Kill order could matter. Then another raid boss could be a corrupted ancient, etc.)  
---
\- Uldum
---
\- Those two zones on the sides of Blackrock that no longer exist.
---
\- The zone behind Strath
---
\-Gnomer Raid
---
\-Emerald Dream
---
\-etc. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I like TBC and think it's probably the better game, but it would be cool to see some of those aspects brought into vanilla without destroying the core game play pre-Naxx.
---
Kind of a good thing in the sense that not as many people will be following the same path as you
---
Nope. He barely made some reforms in his house e bought a new car. Nothing that goes near a hundred thousand. That's on his interview with Josh on countdown to classic
---
Are there other worthy mentions for tools etc?
---
doesn't the trip home thanks to chromie thing have too many syllables or am I retarded
---
Lol so we should just accept whatever they tell us to?
---
But he has put additional work in.  Regardless, companies still charge for products/services they stop R&amp;D on.
---
I don't think people should be as upset about this as they seem to be.
---
This is a man who spent his time on a certain hobby, dare I say skill, and now he wants to cash in.
---
Want to level to 60 quick and you like this guys way? Give him $5.
---
...and I never understood why anyone was bothered by the way other people play a video game even if it doesn't impact them in \*any\* way.

I guess everyone has that thing they're clueless about.

You can press "Next step" once and then just hold enter and it moves forward really really fast. I go to the end in less than 30 seconds.

---
ZG Raptor (done)
---
ZG Tiger
---
R13 warlock set
---
I won’t try R13 but I’m hoping to get the Scepter done in time; it’s going to depend greatly on how the bigger servers affect the available carapaces.
---
Kalahad got free game time for 25 years.
---
I have small hands as well and found some newer ones to not be that bad. Just made the switch to one and won’t ever be going back.
---
A small group (2-3 players) will be more efficient killing mobs than a solo player.
---
Faster kills, less downtime, ability to fight mobs of higher level are all advantageous to leveling.
---
I want to play a human warrior but am hearing the leveling a warrior is tough. I'm going to be a filthy casual because I have too much going on \_in the real world\_. Should I be concerned about leveling a warrior as a casual player?   
---
If so,  are there any leveling guides with weapons to pick up, recommended order of zones to hit, etc?
---
I can see that your idea of a dead server is 5K... I’m totally cool with that population lol.
---
Like the others say, you gan herb and mine for great profit, since crafting is soooo much more part of the game in vanilla than any other time in the game. 
---
So dont let the lack of kill-power discourage you from playing a healer.
---
Killing the boars near goldshire will definitely not get you to 60 lol
---
Og = female Tauren Druid 
---
Joints = female undead Rogue

Archmaester = male undead Priest

That’s awesome

I see. I did some research and it seems Journey did it in 3 days 7 hours, but I couldn't find a video or explanation how he/she did it.

Supposedly Journey grinded most of it and found a Dwarven Hand Cannon.

Yeah, something about people wanting to support others for their hard work so they don't have to do it themselves. Same goes to saying that paying for games is mental as you can pirate pretty much all of them for free.
---
If only you'd play a healer to complete your group! But nah, competing against two other warlocks and possibly a mage kinda sucks... I'd go warrior. IIRC both classes scale fine. Warlock does better as the game goes on than, say, hunters do, though, but I think warriors hold their own from start to finish.
---
damn I also need to get a job where I can watch twitch all day
---
Herod's population isn't blizzards choice. Blizzard is trying to balance between too few and too many realms and I personally would rather see them lean towards fewer high pop servers than end up with a few dead ones
---
In your heart of hearts you know the truth, leave it all behi- no wait no. 
---
That's a hectic schedule you've got bud! I'm pretty busy but will probably squeeze in 5-10 hours or so a week, once everybody's in bed and I get that sweet hour of whiskey and freedom. 
---
Im sure you'll find an hour here and there. Who needs the gym anyway when you can have carpel-tunnel instead.
---
I think its okay to lock content behind a pay wall. Its a lot of work
---
Slam spec is Worse then normal fury spec so no you dont need to use slam and time autoattacks with it
---
Yeah a version that was not available no matter how muc you were willing to pay. I don't count that into the same bucket as they had no way to pay Blizzard to play the game they wanted. But that has nothing really to do with people wanting to support creators and pay for their hard work and effort. Calling people mental for wanting to get their goods/services the legal way sounds a bit rough to me.
---
Different clients completely you can't stip doen a 1.12 addon and make it work with the new clients. You have to nake a new addon.
---
I'm doing that, but in reverse (and at level 5½ instead of level 1). With optimal zeppelin timing and using intentional deaths I could get from Deathknell to Valley of Trials in under 10 minutes played.
---
No love for mankrik
---
Thanks Nicholaes. I am leaving for the gym here in a few, and have started hiking, camping, going to the range, and I am picking up chess later today with some new friends. It's not just WoW for me, but for the next couple weeks it'll be a pretty deep replacement.
---
I've already rediscovered classic on a private server. While it'll always be nice to lvl another character on official, it won't be for me the groundbreaking nostalgia trip that it'll probably be for you.
---
Nope, classic memes and YouTube videos makes work be bearable for me.
---
THat was Kenny. And Cartman was a rogue with a 2h Hammer
---
&gt; I still haven't tried any sort of tobacco product
---
Don't.  I'm a smoker.  The trick is to never start that shit.  It's awful.
---
I’m fine with this. I see so many people looking for guides and wanting to know the best way to get to 60 as fast as possible. I just want to relax, take my time, and experience what I enjoyed about Vanilla in the first place.
---
That's truly diabolical. I love it.
---
I would watch this on twitch.
---
Is this the Snapchat lens? I can’t get it to work
---
But why..?
---
I'll take the Grob on top
---
Honestly if this thread didn't exist I probably wouldn't have even noticed.
---
That is reassuring. However i wasnt planning on going Prot Warrior, just having a shield and 1h for dungeons while leveling.
---
I think i just need to stop overthinking it and stick to Warlock.
---
Warlocks can life tap to death...
---
Wouldnt call the game ancient but older games tend to be a lot harder than current games generally.
---
The scarlet tabard was officially added in patch 1.11
---
Lol that's the fella! But didn't they also assign different names to them in multiplayer?
---
And yet they are changing how skeletons stay on the ground without care.
---
There is however a couple of YouTube challenge videos for leveling to 60 off of just killing boars, just all over the world instead.
---
Or you know.......... use old web archives that give all the information you need in 30 seconds....  [https://web.archive.org/web/20190801064935/https://www.joanasworld.com/#fullmenu](https://web.archive.org/web/20190801064935/https://www.joanasworld.com/#fullmenu)
---
I've been having an internal battle of mage or rogue for over a month now... 
---
Someone else is playing mage in out group but I played through rogue semi-recently (see, 2 years ago) and I'm not feeling fully recharged yet.
---
Does he have alliance also?
---
The OP's post is a joke. Go to [https://legacyplayers.com](https://legacyplayers.com/) and you will see that the best druids max out around 500 dps with end game gear.
---
Some background:
---
\-EQ Player (Warrior (main tank)/Wizard/Shaman) primarily
---
\-Have never played WoW beyond level 10ish.
---
\-Leaning towards Warrior (obviously) or a healer.
---
\-Casual play during the week, more available on weekends, but it depends what's going on. The game isn't a high priority for me at all, but I do have some time to play.
---
\-Likely Horde
---
\-Have a smallish group I'm starting with (one of these is likely to be a warrior and he has main tanking experience in WoW)
---
What am I looking for: 
---
1) What's the distinction with the healing classes? I usually like to tank in games, but healing can be a fun experience. It's a rush to have everyone's lives in your hands as a tank or as a healer. Druid seems most versatile and can tank or heal (bonus), Priest seems more linear/single target healer. Shaman seems to be a buffer/healer only without much versatility.
---
2) Which healer/tank has the easiest time leveling between Priest/Druid/Shaman/Warrior (this doesn't just include pure speed... things like downtime, ability to find a group matter)
---
If shadow is their dream, tell 'em to live it! We'll probably only get one shot at playing Classic fresh for the first time in years, so we might as well make the most of it. I wouldn't hesitate to bring a shadow priest along, and I'd even give 'em some free water. ;)
---
Warlock, warrior, and rogue all work great with a pally.
---
What does ‘QoL’ stand for?
---
Bind mouse buttons to modifier keys like CTRL, ALT, SHFT and then you can use thumb button+12345QQWZX etc without using the modifier key.
---
Often they would run to the opposite faction and just let the guards have their way with them.
---
Literally nobody knows which is "fastest" and everyone's opinion is garbage so just have fun bro.  95% of the players who say they're planning on speed leveling probably won't be able to do it effectively and will hit 60 in the average 10-11 days /played. Dungeons are fast XP if you have a good group comp with high dps and a competent healer. Solo play is fast if you have a leveling route and are playing efficient killing classes like mage or hunter. The speed at which you can level is completely subjective on server stability / queue time, the class you're playing, the people you're playing with, whether you're getting ganked by the enemy faction, whether you're leveling tradeskills during your leveling route, etc.
---
Raid bosses are lvl 63, so for hit cap it's 16%. 6% from talents, 10% required from gear.
---
Sure, they're not going to do it **before** each realm is stable, but that doesn't inherently mean we can speed up the launch of phase 2 by having people leave high-pop servers quicker. There's still probably a minimum established time for P1.
---
"We as a community" can't do shit about the people refusing to move off of the overpopulated realms, we've just gotta hope they do. I imagine most of the people who play largely solo will happily move rather than sit in queues for 2 hours each night after work.
---
So he can start making money for his hard work.

---
I’m going to level a Druid and hunter but can’t decide which to main...
---
Druids fill my desire to be versatile and help others but hunters seem like they’d be a blast through the first few phases. Preferably my main would be the one who gets really geated and the alt just for fun with a decent dungeon set. Seems very unlikely that raiding would ever happen with both toons. If it helps I’m more focused on PVP and would like to do premades on the main I choose. Also on the Druid restless would be the main spec maybe HOTW for PvP.
---
Maybe hunter as a fun farming/wpvp alt? Also should rogue gear dependency dissuade someone from rolling one as an alt?
---
Sometimes when ure Min/Max and you are a melee support they can say you have to be 0/22/29 for improved WF- and Str. Totem.
---
I recently played a priest through all end game content up to AQ. Healing is definitely the thing I ended up enjoying the most - once geared, I was able to elevate the entire group, and prevent all kinds of wipes. I could turn a usually difficult dungeon/boss fight into a cake walk.
---
Shadow priest is definitely fun, but IMOP, warlock or mage have a much more enjoyable toolkit for PVP, and they'll do much more damage in PVE. 
---
If you REALLY dont have any interest in healing, go with the warlock. You'll get a free mount at 40, too.
---
I fall asleep at night thinking I'm dead set on my choice and wake up at 6 am questioning my choice. I'm STUCK between  rogue, warrior and hunter. I want to enjoy both PvE and PvP wanting to go for at least rank 11 for the mount if I can't fight my way for rank 13. In vanilla I leveled an orc hunter until 40 before main tanking paladin from TBC to WoD for my guild.
---
I know a lot of people are going to be rolling warrior, and they're slow and quite boring to level from what I hear until they get MS at 40. This is why I'm considering Rogue and Hunter. Nostalgia makes me wanna play hunter, and PvP engineering goodness makes me wanna play Rogue. Please halp.
---
Never heard of an addon called pfQuest. Is it some private server bullshit?
---
Removing skeletons in high gank areas or elite patrols would be akin to covering up the tracks and would impact gameplay. 
---
I would suggest that, whenever you rez, your skeleton is randomly moved 2 meters away and the orientation is changed. This way it's all automated and it's impossible to write out anything meaningful in the first place.
---
Are they both skipping Blight since comes out like 10 days after Classic?
---
They're working on it
---
they try to turn every feature that gives a multiplayer/community feeling into a boring singleplayer. We want 1:1 classic with corpes.
---
It's hard to recommend retail to be honest.  There is a reason, or reasons, so many people can't stand it.
---
Overwatch
---
That's not how the skeletons ever worked...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMBuxrjZjI
---
They would speed hack to get to cities quickly and kill themselves by setting their Z coordinate very high in the air. They'd fall to their death and then logout
---
Buy a used desktop like a previous poster suggest. I was playing the stress test on a desktop from 2011 without any problems. Was a very expensive computer at the time but specs are very mediocre today, especially the GPU is ancient.
---
 Specs for my desktop are: first version of the i7 CPU, 16 gig RAM, GTX 560 Ti GPU, SSD disk. Ran the stress test at 5/10 setting with max draw distance. Had FPS set at 60 cap. Never dropped below. Could for sure have cranked up the settings a bit more but didn't bother. 
---
 Can add that I tried 10/10 setting and got 30 FPS in a zone that I was alone in. With lots of players around it would probably run at a crawl but found it pretty cool I could get 30 FPS with such a bad GPU still.
---
Sure that isn't one of those "based on your web history" ads?
---
Go home by goin' rogue. :) I don't have any problems with rogues. Yeah, melee is rough sometimes, but that's just how it is. If you know how to use your utility and you're fun to be around/play with, I think you'll have no issue finding people to group up with ya.
---
To each their own browser history I guess
---
Happy cows come from Mulgore!
---
Love that zone!
---
And an extra healer to keep them alive. Yep, better have nothing.

Priest is hella fun. Never hard to find a group, but solo play and gold farming ability make end game a bit painful.

Retail for battle pets, classic for social interaction.
---
Q
---
They don't want layering either can we stop acting like it's staying. Its only to handle the unknown influx of players and then will be removed when they understand how many servers they need.
---
Just goes to show that people need SOMETHING to complain about.
---
Skeletons of all things, I mean come on.
---
No need to stress man, just play and learn as you go. It’s all about the experience and enjoyment of just playing it! You’ll learn lots :)
---
thanks for sharing. everything is better with beer or weed, until you realize it's not. i'll be much more competent sober in pvp encounters and i promise you will be too :)
---
They stated the "Enter World" button will turn red when its time to launch, which means if you login early enough before they do the restart you won't have a que.   Just never log out...EZ PZ
---
Its not the server since it doesn't even exist yet. Its the sheer magnitude of a task of moving 50-100 people off the server per group.
---
Had a guild try that on me during an initiation. Made me glad I spent those several hours getting my aquatic form on my tauren druid.
---
A lot of talking about treating noobs right and I just have to find a way to balance between those of my group that "don't want to be competetive and enjoy the game" and those who "want to be competetive and enjoy the game". What really annoys me is that one thinks his philosophy is better than the others. No, just because I have fun getting 60 fast and enjoying Endcontent does not mean I don't play "the Vanilla way".
---
I bet there will be Drama. And man, I hate Drama.

Super well done.  Great use of a classic meme!  :)

Doesn't matter. People offended over everything

Stick with warlock. They're awesome at PVP and you have all kinds of utility at your fingertips... Sure, you can't tank like a warrior, but you've got the healthstones and the summons!
---
And the dots! MOAR DOTS.

I am going to use WOW classic to severely cut down on my drinking. I know I need to reduce my intake and having something like WoW classic to keep me occupied will be perfect. It's all too easy to go down the pub.

It's not only showing random streamers but players of various guilds competing in the race. Like the aforementioned KennyMarsh.
---
Isn't Classic WoW version 1.12?
---
&gt;He can do what he wants - he made the content.

Literally no one is saying he *can't* do this.

That's some cunning shit right there! Gonna have to try this with my warlock friend.
---
And don't be a "casual elitist" either. You know the type, the people that constantly post stuff like "Don't rush the leveling, there's no point in minmaxing classic" on this forum. Effectively being elitist about being casual.
---
2 months late but as someone who started like a year and a half ago and thus played WoD out of season I enjoyed it, garrisons, questing all that, it was aesthetically beautiful too
---
They'd fall out of the sky and die. Probably some exploit, since I've seen some being created and they teleported away pretty fast.
---
Also.. I've always just seen their bodies lying around. With the skeletons it wasn't quite as visible as a human female lvl 1 warlock in red robes.. lol
---
Of course it exists, where do you think we've created the characters?
---
I will be playing On Shazzrah

So taking a meme template and pasting text on it is "low effort" and gets deleted, but taking a video and pasting text on it is fine.

no changes, yeah right...

Most of the people complaining about r14 encouraging more account sharing than before won't even be serious competitors for r14. That's what seens crazy to me. If someone wants to spend every waking hour pursuing r14 that is their problem not mine

you've probably heard it a million times but switch to vaping and then gradually lean off that as well. it worked for me in the past, except now that i quit drinking i started vaping again because dear god i need something

Love the vids, man! Thanks for all the work you do!
---
Feral druids are viable tanks and viable dps in classic. Great AOE tanking capabilities and decent single target DPS. Caster DPS.... not so much.
---
Paladins are "meh" tanks but can shine in aoe scenarios / undead &amp; demon mob scenarios. They have no taunt and have a mana bar so warriors and druids will outshine them every time just by hitting taunt. Ret can be decent DPS if you go with a high spell damage / high crit build with chance on hit trinkets like Heart of Wyrmthalak &amp; Darkmoon card: Maelstrom + spell damage consumables. Not amazing DPS but can be middle of the pack. Paladins are amazing single target healers -- I'd go as far to say best in the game -- and great cleansers. Group buffs are amazing too with blessing of salvation / auras / etc.
---
How good is that guide? I know Joana's isn't perfect and has some bad routes but it's pretty complete and solid generally the whole way through. Who are Navak and Egregious and is it competitive/superior to Joana's?
---
I always approach with a helping hand to newer players. It's when you spend the time to type out instructions and they flat out ignore them is when my elitism starts to flair up. IF you are a noob and dont know something, ask the group and LISTEN. If you are playing a hunter, please watch videos about how to be a good hunter (turning off growl, making sure pet is on right target, dont body pull with your pet by accident because your pet is much lower level than the tank)
---
I would not call them casual elitist, these people are worried that others feel like they have to rush, while not understanding some people want to rush.
---
Its basicly saying "becarefull with having fun this way, you might miss out on the fun from the other way".
---

I believe the idea is to use tailoring to level enchanting / getting enchanting gear, by converting all cloth drops into green gear (thereby leveling your tailoring) and then DE it.
---
Not Gems alt but thanks. Lets be honest, if your scrawny ass was locked in a cell with me you'd be holding my pocket and eating a cock meat sandwich. Thanks for the downvote boss, I'll take the moral high ground and bid you farewell. Good luck with your acne treatment.

I think creating a 'living' world means letting players solve their own problems, just like in the 'real world'. however if players lack the tools in the game to do that reasonably, then blizzard should do something. however, I think that in classic wow, just like everquest before it, all players have the potential to rise above the challenges in the world. If all else fails, you can always farm boars😋
---
Any plans to get rid of the 'Next' button and just allow seeing each "section" at a time?  Hitting next is pretty bad if its sitting up on a second monitor.  Don't want to have to interact with it a lot.

Summon them, kick from group and kill them.

Most died and if you did you got an invite to the raid group to join in after and get rezzed

You have to add it from the wow classic Snapchat and then point it add a wow add. It’s really weirdly done.
---
I'm thinking about switching to Grobb. Will the PST server time affect my experience as an EST player?
---
No, it happened in classic. It was just with hacked accounts then.
---
It took me 47days played as a 14yo playing on english servers with little english language experience. But man i never forget the moment i hit 60. Also i discovered the use of addons when i was 55 :)
---
Cus 80% of nordics playing wow are in fact Swedish. Google WoD population map (last one blizzard provided). Woops.
---
I don’t know. But it’s solid. I think it’s not the best route, but good enough. That’s what other people are saying. I’m still waiting to play with this guide.
---
Well i am new to WoW so i dont know where it comes from. Here is a link, it just looked like a useful thing to me. (https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/pfquest/)

---
Spam 1 or 2 skills no matter what class you are. Welcome to Classic end game.
---
so yes I am retarded. Thanks doc.
---
What feels off about it?
---
Mordrom (Orc Warrior) and Moridir (Undead Mage)
---
Discussion for what?, whats is your opinion?, no layers past phase 2 they said it so many times idk how people take it any other way.
---
First thing that would be very different is you don't need as much hit on your pvp gear. 
---
And it's worth considering not wearing leather or running around with 2k hp because everything you have only gives ap agi and crit.  Unless you want to be a glass cannon ofc.
---
&gt; We are not planning to bring DX12 and the multithreaded enhancements to the Classic client. The multithreaded support greatly improves performance in large scale environments like Suramar or Boralus. Classic’s world and models are much simpler. It would also increase the system requirements. 
---
Yea it supports multithread but nobody know really how much, in reality even a 50$ G3 intel cpu will be powerfull enough to max out the game
---
I have played a disc priest since wrath, currently play a disc priest casually (RF, &lt;= +3 mythic).
---
I am rolling an undead priest and plan to go heals.  What I am not sure of, is if I should stick with disc and level as disc or if it makes more sense to go with holy.
---
I also was thinking of going tailor + enchanting so I can make bags and wands. 
---
So question I have is.. how viable is disc priest for PVE end-game/leveling? I feel like leveling as shadow (as is the current easiest way) and switching to disc would be a lot of work and will miss out on truly learning the ins and outs of classic disc.
---
Should I go disc or holy?
---
DM weast
---
Second these points. As an active raider, I can tell you that a few good hunters are essential to every guild. Hunters are a class that is "easy to learn", but hard to master. A lot of a hunters power comes from raw player skill, not stats. Learn how to kite things well, and you'll be a hot commodity.
---
I hate this post. Just. Just go away.

I feel like this can be true but can confuse real alcoholism with a habitual drinking. On my way home from work I thought about a beer yesterday. I was sad for ten minutes but then forgot about it. I don't miss liquor at ALL though. Quitting anything entirely that has been a part of my adult life would be difficult, I think, and not indicative of addiction. Thoughts?

I don't see the problem by being effecient

I may have just missed it, but where was the profession stuff? I didn’t see anything listed.
---
We used to summon people.off the side of the waterfall in darnassus!

Reminds me of college books.
---
The loot table changes...for like the 5th fucking time...is bigger news...
---
But here we are talking about fucking skeletons lol
---
the topic isn't the issue. The timing is. 5 days before launch people want devs focusing on fucking skeleton on the ground? This is petty small shit.
---
I'm playing on a server starting from level 1 and leveling a warrior is 100x more difficult than it was on the stress test so take that with a grain of salt.
---
I never liked the instant 60, I only use it to see how I look in game with a BiS set. It helped me not choose troll priest
---
Alternative for the chest if one does not tailor?
---
Oh word? I didn’t know that.
---
Druids are not primary tanks. Every raid will have 2-3 at least for resto.
---
Help! 
---
I originally decided on a warrior. However, I’ve only ever played horde exclusively, and this time I’m trying out alliance. So now paladins are a new class option.
---
So now I’m stuck between a warrior and a paladin. I know I want to be a melee class that can occasionally tank. And I don’t want to be a Druid because my original main was a Druid all the way through MoP, and the whole point of classic is to start out fresh.
---
So, warrior or paladin? My main concerns:
---
-being able to level. I, like many of you, have more responsibilities and less time now. I know that both of these classes are slow to level, but which one is more enjoyable? I’m okay with taking my time and enjoying the process.
---
-group utility. I want to be effective in pick up dungeon groups, as well as group questing. 
---
If it makes a difference, I also wanted to spend a lot of time doing professions, specifically mining/BS as well as all three secondary professions. 
---
I’m just super torn between warrior and paladin. I almost feel like it can be decided by flipping a coin lol.
---
One more note: I’m rolling human, if that matters. Please help!!
---
Unreleased corpses (or un-recovered ones) have accounts tied to them,spirits sitting in the graveyard, etc that can be found and banned. The skeletons could be generated by less accounts, and may be harder to track origin by GMs.

I've been supporting the suggestion to randomize skeleton locations that are too close to other ones when the body is recovered. Not sure how hard-wired skeleton location is, though. Could be an issue with old code. But, this would be a good chance as any since they're already working with the old code.
---
You won't even start seeing those opportunities until probably stanglethorn vale
---
Im a fellow OSRS man as well.
---
I've been considering Warlock or Rogue. I've been watching a lot of class videos in the lead up to classic. 
---
What pushed me towards Warlock is I enjoy the class fantasy behind it, at 60 if I'm not raiding I have something to do by farming epic mount mats, and as a casual player it's an easy solo class.
---
I was pretty high on playing rogue. What pushed me away from it is that, from everything I've watched, there's a lot of warnings about "there's a lot of rogues, lots of competition for gear", etc. Is it possible that so many people think this that it's actually not going to be a highly played class? My guild is only going to have maybe two rogues to start.
---
Ah, a treadmill to prevent deep vein thrombosis, not a bad idea...
---
i (hopefully) have 2 weeks off here and want to really dig in and get a huge chuck done. im hoping for 50ish before that time is up.
---
I'm not complaining, I'm correcting.
---
Under the old system, one person could die repetitively and spell out something like the N-word in a major city. With the super edgy and toxic internet culture, I feel shit like this would be all to common today. Plus people didn't realize you could do this in early vanilla and only really came about much much later, but now, every one knows about it which is another reason it would be all too common.
---
And of course websites trying to advertise would do the same like gold farmers, but you wanna really know what I think would happen the most? Every wannabe streamer will spells out TTVdumbusername, now just imagine that.
---
in that case he is a douche, confirmed. Good epxplanation.
---
You have absolutely no ground to stand on complaining that his guide isnt free and about how much to pay for it. Im 99.999% sure you didn't contribute shit to the guide so if you want it, pay for it. If not, don't bitch and find a new guide.
---
Or, have you considered, the burnout rate on War/Priest/etc will tend to be higher than Lock or Hunter. Just because it is unnecessarily hard to level them. Not everyone who starts one will keep with it, or want to actually tank at endgame.
---
If JurkfazBoogr is good at and comfortable with tanking, putting in the time and research, Warrior might well be the better choice.
---
Once you play Classic you might understand, why some people hate flying.
---
Hmm....
---
No not too much, in fact over 40% of the server is eastern time zone
---
You won't even start seeing those opportunities until about stranglethorn vale

You really are insufferable.

no u wont.

Yep, totally.

The game itself costs 15 a month

I have 1 hardcore player friend who follows his guild. Me and 10 less hardcore friends just roll where ever he rolls. So if his ( idk, 60? Members ) guild reroll. Another 10 players will reroll + friends of guildies in the same situation. 
---
So whenever a guild of 50 people decide to roll another realm. Maybe 250 are exually rerolling aswell.
---
Best chanse for more balanced realms is a few GM deciding to roll a diffrent realm.

I played on Deathroc back in TBC. (Low PvP) and you couldn’t walk out he main gate without 5 ally ganking you.

This should be interesting.

Would also like to know!
---
There \*IS\* a guide, but it was paywalled earlier today. Wouldn't mind a copy if someone managed to save it prior to today, didn't think I'd have to keep it all open in chrome.

If you want to raid in a more competitive guild, yes. Otherwise you can do whatever.

the illegal thing was about private vanilla servers.

The Client basically is the bfa client hooked up to the classic database. That's why many addons dont work out of the box. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)

Really struggling between warlock or shaman. How common is it to be a hybrid resto/ele shaman for PvE? I know it can be run for pvp just fine.

You should never feel bad owning something you paid for. You paid for access to *all* of the guides, hence you grab them. Obviously you aren't entitled to any *updates* said guides receive after your time runs out, but feeling like your scamming him is silly. You paid for the product, you get the product.

Reshade allows you to enable a large number of settings that can change how the game looks. It's very easy to mess around with and takes 30seconds to install.

Some people say it's horrendously ugly, but I prefer the darker advanced sharpening look.

The scummiest thing about this isn't that he's now charging for the guide but rather he was on several podcasts and also streaming on Twitch hyping up part two of his guide yet never mentioned to anyone that he was going to charge to start charging for it, all the while taking subs and donations...
---
*laughs in warlock*

... It it just me, or does 2nd pic look significantly worse than "reshade off"?

You mean because you believe you will have to be force transferred off the realm you reserved your name on?

I plan to roll Tauren hunter. Would this be a bad choice for wpvp? I am a very casual player so its mostly taking my time questing, doing some dungeons, i like to wpvp while I quest tho - thats one of the most fun parts of the game for me.
---
I get that orc gets the amazing stun resist, do you think I would regret rolling Tauren in the long run? I just don't really like how orcs look. I think Tauren is a cool race with very nice lore.

And their racials don't seem too bad, I can see the stomp saving my ass in some situations where you got 2 second to turn on aspect of the cheetah and gain some distance.

I'm in the opposite situation as you. Tons of /played with my priest. I love the class, and the itemization. People love having a great healer, and there is a lot to learn/have fun with. 
---
By far the biggest reason I want to roll mage this time around is for gold farming. My priest is constantly poor, and terrible at farming. The

Isn't this just someone taking a picture of an actual Blizzard advertisement?

Such a good reputation ruined
---
They will move, many are holding onto the ignorant idea that layering solves the problem and there will be no que.  Others know there will be a queue but think it will go away early, which it won't.  Others just don't know in general.  Some are just toxic idiots who are sure whatever assumption they carry will clearly be right and how dare it be challenged.
---
Many people will migrate on day one.  This is a guaruntee once the queue wall is hit.  You cannot save them or offer them advice, I've tried.  They are dead set on being right, even when it means damaging their experience.  Let them have it.
---
Paladins are alright dungeon tanks while leveling up. The biggest downside is not the lack of taunt(although that is pretty annoying), but rather you having to drink after every pack or two, significantly slowing the pace of the dungeon. There won't be any raid tanking as a paladin.  
---
Druids are alright at tanking.  
---
For rogues, poisons = more damage in dungeons/pve, so yes, very useful.
---
&gt; Not Gems alt
---
Nobody said anything about their alt specifically.
---
&gt; Thanks for the downvote boss

Good luck buddy, I've changed my mind close to a few hundred times in 3 years now.
---
There are several good alternatives, for multiple gear slots.
---
Elder wizard mantle is gonna be mad expensive because it's BiS for so many people.
---
Also, he has (3) pieces of random enchant gear listed. Which means probably 100+ runs to get all 3 pieces to all have the +healing enchantment.
---
&gt; Dungeon grinding with people who know what they're doing turned out to be more effective than expected, when you reach 60 you are already pretty geared. All the week 1 Ragnaros guilds are doing it.
---
I asked this months ago and was shot down saying it would never be better than solo leveling.
---
Sweet.
---
I would pair tailoring with skinning and vendor the skins/save a few for those odd tailoring recipes that require it. I would wait with Enchanting until I have my epic mount.
---
Regarding weapons, Kargoz posted an interesting leveling guide on youtube. In the final minutes he discusses the recommended weapon progression for both alliance and horde in a very clear presentation. check out  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM)
---
You should play on Skeram, horde side! I'll be playing a lot and looking to make some friends out there in Azeroth! My name is 'Enchanting'.
---
So I've been bouncing around horribly in my head about what to play. Played rogue through most of my wow career (vanilla-cata) so that was my first thought. But then I thought I'd like to try something new. Mages seem strong, have good utility stuff, and frankly seem pretty low maintenance. Both of them seem like they're going to be heavily played and thus have tough competition for gear, though, which kinda blows.
---
Shadow priest has always seemed cool to me, but I know it isn't good in classic and don't wanna get laughed out of raids for not wanting to heal, and I really don't want to be a holy priest.
---
Druid is my last option. I think I'd be okay with being a sub-par raid healer, so long as I could go with the tank/heal hybrid spec to tank adds and maybe dungeons and because it seems fun in PvP, but again, don't wanna get laughed out of a raid for a meme spec (but on the upside, nearly no gear competition on that one).
---
Someone help, before I end up spending all of release day staring at the character creation screen.
---
There is only one way
---
For my Fellow German speakers here, Mute the Sound than it should work :)
---
Nah it isn't.
---
Personally, I’d stick to one at first. Especially if one of the two classes you have in mind is more gear dependent than the other (ex. Mage and Warrior). You can level the not so gear dependent one first, get it to 60 and then make an alt for the other while using the 60 to farm some extra monies for the gear.
---
Leveling two simultaneously is going to be rough and I know I would feel like it was more work than fun. That’s entirely my opinion though.
---
It's just something I got in the habit of doing in 60 dungeons back in vanilla. Some people would be surprised initially but never had any issues with it. Reddit just assumes in the worse I guess.
---
If you exit the realm list on the classic client you'll see the same screen as in the video.....

Yep. Most of the people following that guides are trying to look like tryhards while farming kobolds around goldshire

What server did you play on? And did you always play a warlock?

The name Awbee just sparked a memory of a 60 gnome I was friends with in Vanilla for a bit on my nelf priest. I don't think i got past 51ish on that character, but there were a couple 60's I befriended one way or another. I forget how exactly.

---
I think it depends on how much time you are willing to spend every day.  You will not get good rested bonus if you let a char inactive for a day, several days can matter.  I think it makes sense only if you want to level both to may be 30ths, when rested bonus will be noticeable, and if you are going to play one char mostly, returning to the 2nd char to level it through the rested bonus only: 1.5 levels, then back to main.

We don't nee dal rend, you can just buy a Krol Blade and save yourself valuable time.

A lot of this came out of the arcade game idea that games should vacuum quarters out of your pockets.... At least in the NES days

Rip Warlock dev and the following destruction of Warlocks out of spite and as revenge.
---
He is putting in a ton of work in making leveling guides, then monetizes them and people are pissed off? Jesus, I would do the same. Why should I work my ass off for nothing?
---
If his guides were an in game addon, it might be worth it, but having to look at a website makes it 100% not worth it.
---
Most priests will level as shadow, and i planned to keep playing shadow until I hit 60 and started looking for dungeon groups. I was bored with the novelty of shadow by then anyway, and healing was super fun, so I made the switch.
---
Obviously, you can respec, but:
---
1. Respeccing gets expensive and priests cant farm easily.
---
2. Now you have two separate gear sets to collect. 
---
After much time at 60, I began looking at shadow gear as a little side project, and would respec from time to time to mix it up. 95% of my time was spent as a holy priest at 60.

TBF, there's not much he can really do because the images in them can't be sold unless he wants Blizzard to be upset. So he can't issue DMCA takedowns of free options and honestly at this point I think it'd just be better to open a donation if people liked the guide.

I’m sorry but “just become a streamer!” Isn’t an excuse not to charge for your work.
---
There have been. Private servers had been needing dungeon xp. The beta showed that they are the best if you have a group.
---
Well if you going hardcore - ish that is true.
---
Warrior as dps will be a rare exception
---
&gt;-group utility. I want to be effective in pick up dungeon groups, as well as group questing.
---
warrior is a better tank and warrior is a vastly better dps. in other words, warriors are several times more desirable. personally, im going with warrior as i want to experience what made them fun once again: stance dancing. i cant consider playing a paladin as i want something more interactive than watching my character autohit mobs until they die. though, paladins are probably better lvlers during the early levels with their self-sustain.
---
420 ap vs 154 ap and 13 str and +8 str and agi from the only useful off hand that exist.
---
You literally get twice the dps stats on Atiesh. On top of that a few mp5, intellect and spirit that will be quite useful for power shifting sustain.
---
The extra threat you get can also be good for tanking on some fights.
---
But anyway, if someone get atiesh, it mean that all the content is on farm so whoever get it doesn't really matter unless blizzard decide to add some classic exclusive content.
---
Basically yes 'What the... there's Classic WoW adverts too, huh?'

NICE! I have a similar setup, i like the cattower on the side, i didn't think of that and might add it to my own.

---
Priest and druid level quite quickly.
---
Priest because of improved wand spec and spirit tap. You will level as shadow and can DOS or heal to find groups.
---
Druid because they can spend one resource to DPS as cat, and another resource to heal between fights (mana). You will levell as feral and so you can DOS and Tank to find groups
---
Warriors are notoriously slow levellers. But you can run dungeons if you want as a tank or Arms DPS. 
---
Shamans I have less experience with, but they have next to zero stron mana regen talents so I expect they are not fast levellers solo.
---
When you start dungeons and raids, actually Shaman are very versatile, they have great AoE and single target heals and all sorts of mandatory buffs in raids.
---
Druids are more awkward than they seem because their main vanilla heal is very slow to cast, and because they have no basic resurrection spell so they depend on another class like a shadow priest or paladin to rez party members.
---
You are correct, but it's possible to filter the ui to remove this problem.
---
Any cool rewards?
---
There's already a druid guide. The first one of it's kind was druid. Did I miss sarcasm?
---
I suspect some of it is FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) as these servers will be seen as the "main" servers with the highest population, where everything happens and history is written.
---
Personally, I'll be playing on Shazzrah because I've cooridnated several separate groups of friends to play there, and organizing a move is just too much hassle.
---
I'm sure the queues will be a pain in the ass, but it'll pass eventually.
---
Which is more classic-themed than retail-themed imo.
---
I just give feedback on the suggestion. I see pros and cons while orher just give one or the other
---
He also has a very serious heart defect so I would imagine that every little bit helps. And as he said himself, if you've watched his streamd over the summer this isnt news, he has mentioned it repeatedly.
---
Could be wrong but isn't the old version of the guide on wayback now outdated after he's found new death skips and whatnot? 
---
Anyone "giving him bad faith" is just a cheap piece of shit, downvote away. He doesn't owe anyone anything and a WoW guide is in no way essential to playing the game. Doesn't surprise me that the sort of people that use guides to tell them how to play a game for **120+ hours** are the sort of people that would complain that they aren't completely free.
---
You never sit in Orgrimmar. You run and jump in circles on the bank roof! The true endgame.
---
Look up fedex exploration leveling like 4 hours to level 10 or so without killing one thing. You have some coin and a bunch of flight paths.
---
Disagree completely. He should be paid for the guides he spent a lot of time on. Silly of anyone to think otherwise.
---
Maximizing profit isn't scummy. You didn't do fucking anything to help him create his guide, your opinion doesn't mean shit. Buy it if you think its worth it or fuck off to a different guide. I'm saying this as someone who isn't buying a guide at all. WAHHH someone who put thousands of hours into creating a guide isn't free for me?  WAAHHHH.

I'm not worried about who's priority gear will be, the people I'll be running things with on the rare chances I'll get to won't be denying people gear because the mage doesn't have it, for example. I'm thinking more of things like, if Truestrike shoulders drop, for example, could be 4 people in the group rolling on it.
---
Thanks for your response though. You're right, there will be competition for all kinds of gear, though I think "Blank of Shadow Wrath" will only have locks, priests maybe, and definitely hunters (because everything is hunter gear).
---
I do not rember him saying this but it's possible. Most recently on classic countdown he said all of his 1-60 guides were free with some being paid. And the fact that it's a subscription is a real slap in the face too.
---
Paladins were kings back in vanilla due to their exclusive alliance status. I have a druid as well but she will be my alt. Im an altoholic so il just make one of everything
---
Layering is fine but this is crossing the line for people on the sub? Jesus...
---
Daawww. he's so cute :3 I wanna squeeze those molten cheeks.
---
Some people do not like layering even as advertised, you realize.
---
But there's nothing to buy with gold that makes you "win". Yay I can buy a boe mythic raid bracer that ups my item level by 0.03! Or you could do a m+ dungeon and get the same thing with better stats..
---
Probably the same reason why People make huge mods that almost change the entire game (Elder Scrolls as an example) for free.

Because they want to do it.

Same. I have a home gym, but also a workout partner who lifts with me and I’ve cancelled none of that.
---
once the "Server dead?" spam starts happening with &lt;8k pop the server is doomed
---
How about "2 Factions Fighting" instead of "2 Faction War"?
---
I’ll just take your word for that then.
---
It’s 5$ monthly. If I pay 5$ now and use it for my main, it’s another 5$ when I level my alt, and another, and another...
---
I’d much rather pay a flat fee. Fuck a monthly subscription for a guide.

Its fine. Its not incredibly fast but not slow. I'd give it a 6/10 for leveling, hunters, warlocks and druids being some of the only classes that are better to level with. You shouldn't find yourself regretting picking a priest due to the leveling.

What is the overall best glass cannon class at 60 with MC or less gear?

Man, that name would have been good for business. I wish I'd thought of that

He would probably have made more money by setting up a Gofundme tbh

This is very underrated indeed, top of the list!

He has a smiley face on his chest!

You're just trying to create drama because you're bored. Goodbye and good luck

Scale is irrelevant.  There are millions of sole proprietors running their one-person companies.
---
Can you name a forum where you could potentially find it?
---
It's a crazy concept, but hear me out. Not everyone enjoys the same things.
---
Yes they are
---
There will be loads of DPS warriors
---
On private servers. They might not be best DPS in Classic.
---
Disc only got good in Wrath.
---
Prior to that it was a pretty bad build except for PVP or as a niche build to buff your DPS. It's all utility. So you can play it at 69 but it doesn't really feel different to holy. You just have less buttons and heal for less.
---
The levelling builds for priests are essentially shadow or Holy and taking the smite talents.
---
No one will buy it unfortunately. I hope his reputation stays though
---
I'm a pickle, Morty!
---
Isn't the debuff limit set to 16 since we're starting on 1.12?
---
they have made autopilot for 1-60 already
---
Just spitballing here, but if they decayed corpses at different rates for different levels, wouldn't that solve most of the issues?
---
Weird how everyone says a different number every time I hear someone on reddit talk about it then.
---
I will only miss it in World PvP encounters to signify a bloodbath. Nothing more terrifying (i.e. fun) landing in Tarren Mill with your appropriate level character and seeing the skeleton spam all over, shit... it's too late to turn back now? You're in combat? Well, shit...
---
Be more specific
---
It has been suggested by others and in other threads that the skeleton limit per player should be 3 instead of 1.
---
With that compromise, there will still be piles of skeletons in STV, and it will still be impossible to spell or draw things with 3 skeletons, unless you're offended by a triangle.
---
So you are the guy not using Adblock
---
Again, wrong analogy. That would be like making WoW back in the day and charging for it, but then after a decade they make it freeware that anyone can use for free. Then after 5 years suddenly pulling the freeware and locking people out of the game and charging them again with no improvements.
---
I too exploded with premature excitement
---
I will never understand why people hate on cat form that much.

Omg yes. Makes it so easy to shift between game and browser with two monitors.
---
Didn't say it was a big deal.
---
5 shadow for spirit tap for the mana regen and then disc for wand to eliminate down time, then finish leveling up disc. That’s going to be my route. Maybe switch over to spriest for last 20 levels, depending on how it’s going. Server/faction/available play time? Looking for leveling friends/guild.
---
Yeah I know I was just talking about Goldshire like they did in the episode lol
---
I honestly hope you have picked up those things and not just being sarcastic.
---
And he is, via thousands in donations and by Patreon. The guides have been free for years and now put behind a paywall? P scummy, esp since everyone else’s guides are out there for free.
---
AKA why you don't want to play a Rogue in 1.12 if you don't want gearing to be a nightmare. The BIS is almost all the same since the gloves and legs are devilsaur on warrior to. Wonder how many new Rogues will quit when they find out no warrior will bring them to instances to even get pre raid gear. On private servers all you saw was "looking for ranged".  Warriors are popular on the class lists for a reason. They have all the power along with priests.
---
Yes, it is a hard thing to prove since he has been streaming for 80 hours nonstop, with only bits being commentated. I do not have time to scour 80 hours of footage by 10 seconds, and nobody probably does.
---
&gt; From what I’ve seen, he’s charged in the past and was clear it would be in a membership area before classic launch.
---
Can you throw a link or a clip to him saying this? It's the same statement as mine, but opposite. Maybe we can put facts at least on one side of this.
---
Dicks out for Herod.
---
You never raided vanilla or suffered from memory altering brain damage between then and now.
---
Fury Warriors are the top dps class and will be stacked in every raid, especially hardcore
---
I don't remember them, it's been so long.
---
Warrior and Rogue will last you from Phase 1 to the end of Phase 4. Both are a blast to play and scale well throughout Vanilla. Hunters are really good for the first half of Phase 1, but drop off in the second half (In regards to PVE). 
---
If you want a more "full proof" class, a Warrior/Rogue are your choices. But if you're not rolling with a super strict min/max hardcore guild, the Hunter drop off in PVE shouldn't really be a big deal.
---
I never saw anyone do this once in all my time playing WoW.
---
Some of my fondest memories are trolling people in Halo 2 but then they removed the bugs and the game was over for me.
---
Honestly both would work for you, but keep in mind that RP servers aren't that much more RP than the rest (and by that I mean most people don't do RP). However the community on RP servers has always seemed more mature to me, so I always pick an RP server when I can.

Haha, I was gonna say druid could be a good class for this guy, especially that balance/resto mix that boils down to whittling away other people's HP until they eventually die. (It looks fun and busy.) But if we're looking at just the classes he's mentioned, I'd say they're all equally viable and equally a pain to gear up, and he should go for what he likes the class fantasy of and/or the feel of the most.
---
I usually use:
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast x
---
on some spells so I can cast them immediately if I'm already casting something else.
---
Yeah I'll be making the switch. Very excited to join the RP community
---
&gt;People can respond however they want
---
&gt;Also don't accuse people of...
---
Lmfao dude, at least keep your own internal logic straight.

Going Horde Rogue. I’ve always been a PvE player but I’m planning on doing significant PvP as well this time (still primarily PvE though). I really want to go Undead because Orc Rogue is a terrible look. Also, over the years ive done the 1-12 Durotar thing more times than I can count. I’ve only done the Undead 1-12 maybe 2 or 3 times.
---
Will I really be missing out on significant PvE power if I go Undead instead?
---
id suggest you do till at least 10 in ne zone 
---
the human one is going to be packed and i think some humans will go quest in night elf areas because its a less popular race 
---
basically a high percentage melee and paladins and a good number of casters will be going human
---
many moons ago, I used to gather up quests and run around a zone until I explored it all while completing them. I was the Loremaster before it was a thing :)  Gonna do the same thing this time around and have fun trying to remember where the hell everything is.
---
You're not going to get shamed for it.
---
What straight male wants to stare at man ass for 20 hours a day?
---
You get both, a PDF (for Preordering afaik) and then it will be sent out.
---
I've decided to play a hunter, and I'm undecided betweem Survival and Beast Mastery. I worry survival will force me to grind weapon skill too much, while with beast mastery the concern is over-reliance on pets.
---
What say you, classic players?
---
This video reminded me of an old classic:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK7n\_9a5O-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK7n_9a5O-Y)
---
Ahh, the sweet twilight hour. That's definitely an option!
---
Difference is that it's not just some wpvp happening, but someone tricking their own faction into getting killed by cross communication with the other faction. It's a grey line of acceptable behavior. I personally wouldn't report it but I could certainly see grounds for contacting a GM over it.
---
Going to be no life-ing it the first week, but unfortunately have an event in another state the first weekend. After that, back to no life. I'm playing an Undead Priest, taking enchanting and tailoring so if someone needs wands early level, send me a message. Looking to make 60 within a month or two at most.
---
I dont care as long as Im playin, having fun and feeling part of the community!
---
Rogue? Maybe not the absolute fastest leveler, but pretty consistent.
---
I cant find any pages I can't read of the guide. What are you on about?
---
I literally shed blood reserving Qwdqwd, my pain will not be for nothing.
---
Hows ya addblock running?
---
I've been saying this for a week or so and all I get are downvotes.
---
Release day will come and people will say Blizzard is to blame and "how could this happen?"
---
Thank you for showcasing your mental stability
---
Not even a little. Registered accounts on Ely$ium: nearly 1.3 million. Registered accounts on No$talrius: over 800k. Together: 2.1 million, a.k.a. "millions", literally. Hence why I phrased it as such.
---
\*2 days after servers are laggy and people can't play due to bad server performance caused by corpses\*
---
Please Blizzard, do something against this awful serve performance!

Racials never make or break a class.  They’re some nice quality of life bonuses sometimes, but love of a character &gt; any racial perk.

Heck, I put on the video in the background so I could read (sing in my mind) along with it to this.  Well done!
---
But the model of it is The Hungering Cold https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23577/the-hungering-cold#screenshots:id=1354
---
Excellent
---
Weird flex but okay
---
insert gif here *I understood that reference*
---
Mostly because they hope people wisen up and move.  We had ques for over a year on my vanilla server.  But time will hand the verdict here.
---
✅ Cross faction collusion
---
✅ Malicious false advertisement
---
✅ Extensive griefing to ruin someone’s afternoon/evening if they are new or don’t know any better
---
✅ Causing extensive item repair damage if they have to spirit res (when gold is harder to come by in classic)
---
If there ever was a legitimate reason to soft ban someone, this is it. 
---
This is like luring in runescape which is also bannable.
---
Drink sparkling water instead if you start craving booze. It helps, seriously.
---
I’m glad they don’t have the new models. I absolutely hated what they did with orcs. Their facial hair looks horrible and they bounce around like crazy while they run.
---
Never understood why the legendary staff is probably the most ugliest looking weapon in the game. The lvl 1 default starting staff looks better
---
More meant on the side of patching, or creating a character on a server or something.
---
Probably because majority of people will take longer than a month and you can be sure those people wouldnt bother to make a screenshots compilation of it either.
---
Actually, during dedicated I had a lot more free time than I do now currently as a 3rd year. But you're right, there should be ways to make time no matter what. Good luck!
---
People getting their diapers in a bunch over "greifing" like this need to understand that in Vanilla, the solution to these things is community centered **reputation**, not having the Blizzard corporation or Big Brother ban or censor the players.
---
This isn't Retail WoW. The communities are tight knit. If you keep being an asshole, people will know to avoid you.
---
Beautiful
---
I can't stop laughing 😂
---
Thanks for your patronising nonsense, but I played the actual classic 14 years ago, played every expansion since then, and have played the stress test. Flying is a good thing. I respect \#NoChanges for classic, but unlike some hypocritical classic fans like yourself I hold that respect for BC and WotLK as well.
---
I used to do the same as mage. 
---
I was a bit of a dick then. Someone accidentally listed that motorcycle mount (mekgineers chopper?) on the AH for 15gold instead of 15k, I bought it and didn’t give it back...,
---
Anyway I used to invite people for a ride around dalaran then go into the sewers and drive off the edge, I was mage so could then slow fall to safety but they would fall to their deaths.
---
Wasnt that Argent Dawn quest not put into the game until the Naxx pre-release event? Or was it in from the start?
---
I know of the Onyxia and ZG ones, but I had gotten my hopes up that 18 slot bags were easy to craft, so I got hopeful.
---
I would argue that the OP screenshot would look drastically different with 90% of the skeletons gone, and the emergent story has been removed. But now we're talking about aesthetics so I can only leave my opinion here and move on.
---
His hobby isn't available until next week.
---
do you really need it explained to you how people are offended by everything now and days?
---
Yes. Terribly excited about it. Mana management is *everything* for most healers.
---

---
What's a magazine
---
He 100% did say his guide wouldn't cost money. It would stay free, his words. He said "a members area to the website is coming soon, not entirely sure what will be there yet but likely some exclusive members area only tips and tricks to start with" he never mentioned he guide would be locked behind the members section, at all. He's also taking plenty of money on twitch, and has been sending people to his Patreon as well. None of those other things give you access to the guide.
---
Run through STV take the boat to ratchet and run from there to darkshore
---
To randomize the skeletons is kinda a big deal for one of the most minor problems in the game.
---
THey perspire more than others.
---
You can't go wrong with either. Priest will be kind of boring leveling, but you'll have no issues getting a group later. Mage will be less boring leveling but you'll have a harder time getting groups (if there are 10 dps to choose from, a mage might get chosen for sure, but if 5 of the 10 dps are mages, I mean, will it be you?). That said, if you get the chance to prove yourself in a group, be such a badass awesome person that they call on you again in the future for a group.
---
just remember to reequip your weapon...even though smacking people with fishing poles is cool :)

My family on my father's side is actually from Brazil, so I'm well aware of their diverse background.  There was a flood of Caucasian Americans that emigrated to Brazil right before the US Civil War, and Europe has had millions emigrate constantly since the 1600s, with a big boom before &amp; after WW2.  [Brazilian ethnicity is 47.7% white, 43.1% mixed white/black.  7.6% black. 1.1% Asian.  0.4% indigenous.](https://www.indexmundi.com/brazil/ethnic_groups.html)

I’ve never played and I can’t wait, I’m sure there will be a lot of people laughing at me but I’m just gonna enjoy exploration and levelling
---
That’s exactly what I do.
---
You would once you started a big battle or arrived somewhere to get ganked immediately and everyone is pointing it out in chat.
---
That was because they were using it to Model-Edit. I highly doubt they will ban people for Sandboxing the game, otherwise places like WoWHead would have their employees banned because they sandbox wow and even use custom environments to show off datamined mounts and whatnot.
---
Exactly the same situation for me and my pals^^
---
ein aint dutch mate

there is a druid trainer in the stormwind park, so you can go there for skill ups when you need.
---
yep

Just wanted a two character name and Oo, Ok, Ko, Lo, etc. were taken.

Not on trash but for bosses.

Lol the man needs a new heart, if you are gonna use it, why not spend 5$ and help him out lol...

Yeah, people lie all the time about having cancer or needing surgery on sites like GoFundMe. I'm not saying Joana is, but it is something that happens quite regularly.

You are indeed a god amongst men, thank you for sharing this greatness.

Which ones? You have one potion per combat encounter in Wrath &amp; most effect stop working after level 60

Well its worth to rewatch it only takes like 30 minutes i guess. I've watched it yesterday

Do the wetlands wall jump

You can expect to be around 18k rep away from exalted, if you literally do everythnig, which grants darnassus rep. In runecloth that ~240 stacks.
---
Depending on what you're planning on doing, I'd imagine you're drifting into fraud territory. But I wouldn't seek legal advice in the wowclassic subreddit...
---
A lot of things shouldn't happen, but it's Blizzard we're talking about here.
---
I recently leveled a Priest to 40 and it was pretty fast imho. Just keep on top of you’re wand. Around 40 you might wanna Respec to Shadow which keeps things interesting. Melt faces interesting!
---
Yes you can. Just get the IF and Wetlands FPs to make traversing easier. If you do the shortcut to IF it saves you having to run through Wetlands and Loch Modan also. Probably 20-30 mins tops of travel the first time.

Less xp per kill in a group, but a group kills much faster. I think if you have a group of 3 to 5 it'd be faster than solo grinding.

What? The lowest quality picture available?
---
His site his content, whatever.
---
Im a paladin, so I have to be in the human area until 12. After that, I will be doing the tram to IF and menethil death skip to boat over to darkshore. Will end up doing most of darkshore and also ashenvale during my 20's to get good start on rep before doing cloth turn ins when im 60. Im going for the winterspring mount, not the normal NE one so I have more time, but you can get up to around revered just questing these areas + feralas
---
I for one already did the 1-60 in vanilla. Three times. For that I'm good. I was only able to raid BWL a little and none of NAX or AQ40 the first time around. So that's what I want to do.

Stalagg discord is currently at A1094/H1224. Not definitive but 2300 is a good sample if it is decently random.
---
Didn't you hear? It's only cool to hate Blizzard on the retail forums.
---
Not part of the wow guild method, no.
---
Method (the esports organisation) has a bunch of streamers affiliated for sponsorships, advertisement, etc.
---
People like tipsout and esfand are part of that side of method.
---
You mean resto druid? Or did you say holy paladin?
---
Totally legal
---
Thanks guys, i think i'll roll warrior
---
I'm going with orc for the stun resist.
---
Leveling you will want affliction plus voidwalker.  At 60 you will either spec Shadow Mastery/ Ruin or Demonic Sacrifice/ Ruin.  For the former you'd be using imp for stam buff to party.  For the latter you'd sacrifice the succubus for increased damage.
---
For PvP you can do SL if you want to be near-unkillable.  Usual pet is felhunter because it really harasses enemy casters.  Succubus seduce can be useful as well.
---
There are exceptions. Basically it goes like this:
---
**Warrior**  
---
Prot: best tank, period  
---
Arms: purely for PvP  
---
Fury: one of the best DPS  
---
*Most raids have more warriors than any other class.*
---
**Paladin**  
---
Holy: great healer  
---
Prot: not seriously viable  
---
Ret: very low DPS  
---
*Only holy is good in PvE.*
---
**Shaman**  
---
Resto: great healer  
---
Elemental: purely PvP  
---
Enhancement: very low DPS  
---
*Only resto is good in PvE, but raids often want 8 shamans so it's possible to sneak in as enhancement.*
---
**Druid**  
---
Resto: good healer  
---
Feral: decent tank, okay DPS  
---
Balance: niche PvP spec  
---
*Most raids will allow one feral druid in the lineup, but that's about it.*
---
**Priest**  
---
Disc: mostly a supplementary tree  
---
Shadow: very low DPS, utility role  
---
*Most raids will allow one shadow priest in the lineup. You can spec disc but it's still basically the same playstyle as holy.*
---
Just take the tram to Ironforge, run up into the mountains and die in "wetlands" so you rez at the spirit healer right by Menethil Harbor IMO.
---
Ya, I wasn't sure about that, so I've mentioned it. Thanks for clarifying.
---
if you are talking about ziz trust me he couod handle it , 1-100 in poe is essentially the same as dungeon leveling but worse 
---
he is a machine when it comes to power leveling 
---
in poe you use a lot less skills but vanilla classes while leveling are very simple
---
im sure everyone in method has done some practice on private servers but they cant really talk about that.
---
heck even ive d9ne some practice with mu cleave group and i only got in one this week
---
I’ll be leveling with my wife who is brand new to the game and she is pretty much set on an orc hunter. Now I’m torn between two classes/races. Orc rogue or undead mage. (Troll mage is out of the question). We’re mostly going to be focusing on world pvp, dueling, and battlegrounds. Ive been thinking about this decision all day for weeks now and can’t make up my mind. (A little bonus to mage I’ve considered is the ability to farm gold easily in group killing). So what would you do if you were in my situation? And if you chose mage, when should I run over to durotar to level with my wife?
---
Rogues (and warriors) scale much better with gear than druids. If everyone is in greens and blues then yes, you can probably sit in bear form and win. Once people have T2+ gear the druid will need to CC the rogue and heal, multiple times. There are a bunch of ways how this can go wrong, e.g. Bash missing, getting Blinded/Gouged right after Nature's Grasp procs, unusual talents like Improved Sprint, Engineering stuff, etc. If the rogue manages to land a 5pt Kidney Shot on the druid outside of Bear Form, the fight is often over.
---
The old Nerf Druids 4 video showcases the playstyle *as it was back then* quite well, although the druid has really good gear there (T2.5, Feral Attack Power mace, etc.): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6fH6zqkIE Although I'm not sure how well this will translate into new classic.
---
Absolute worst case scenario it's a combat rogue who is decked out in Naxx gear that ignores armor (nature/fire damage procs from Misplaced Servo Arm, weapon enchants, trinkets, T2 set bonus). They can do 5k+ damage in their opener, even against a plate target. I suspect that if the game ever reaches a phase where most people have Naxx gear, PvP will collapse, because certain classes will just one/two-shot everything.

ITT: Capitalists vs Socialists
---
I did up to level 40 on Joana's guide on a pserver and clicking through this guide in just the 1-10 zone, it seems to make far better decisions already.
---
I may just stick with this classicwow.live then. Has anyone done this vs Joana's to see what is quicker?
---
Isnt Summon disabled on Arena thoug?
---
I drink the tears of ppl like you
---
How do people fall for this? You can see where party memebers are if you open world map.
---
This made me laugh
---
I mean even on his website you can read that 'you will have an 'OPTION' to sub into memeber area to get access to in-game addon.   
---
I am not a native english speaker, but it clearly means that you can either use the guides in 'paper' form or have an option to sub into members area and get a shiny addon that will show you everything.   
---
Then there is info that addon won' be available for classic launch(despite it was planned that way) becuase it's a lot of work, and then couple days later you need to sub to member area to acces the 'paper' guides.
---
Pay the deed forward, link please ;)
---
I agree, I live the simplicity.
---
How necessary is the crowd pummeler for leveling?  If it isn’t like required wouldn’t it be easy to solo farm it at 60?  
---
Also I leveled a warrior in vanilla for a bit so I do know how gear dependent they are I just wanna try something new but was worried about getting a pug 5-10 man groups as a bear or cat
---
Tips gout fraud
---
You sir/madame are a shiny golden god.
---
My wife, and I, will be leveling sans guides, but when she is not playing (I play much more than her) I will be using a guide to help. Leveling 2 characters at the same time is going to be slow going.
---
I find way more enjoyment in playing with people who actually know how to play the game. Usually those people level quickly. That's the main argument for me.

Imagine thinking frost mages have a rotation.

You may make $5 off of every user now instead of 1, but the people using it is going to drop 90+% and that isn't even counting the likely loss in his other revenue streams this will cause.

---
Basically...you brought druids and Paladins for their buffs.
---
Paladins did see a place as MT healers because of their strong single-target heals, auras, judgements (specifically JoL) \[but even then limited use case due to 'debuff limits'; push sunder off and instant group/raid kick\], and their near infinite mana thanks to Illumination.
---
Druids were mainly used for batteries and getting healers/tanks off the ground during a fight. Feral did see some utility for their Leader of the Pack buff in the 'tank group'. So that the tank could keep high threat (3% extra crit chance is amazing!), while letting the DPS go 'balls to the wall'.
---
I believe they also were used to MT bosses that had high-damage attacks, due to the druid's tank having a high HP value to counter the lack of block. - I think a fully geared 'tank druid', in bear form, had something like 14k health. Where a warrior would maybe get to 8k. ((Been a long time since I saw the 'classic' health pools.))

I wish. Those dudes have lazer focus on things.

I just wished they would have given an estimate on how long the various phases are gonna last.

I want a better one. Can you point me in their direction? I know of the Navak &amp; Egregious one but if they don't feature saving by launch I'd like a fallback.
---
Find them, compare them. Look up the worst chains on Wowhead.

Thank you for such detailed and clear answer mate

You won't

Warstomp will save yourself and others when you choose, Hardiness only saves yourself whenever it feels like it.

Adblock exists and any person with even some brain power had it installed

Ah I understand now. Yeah you're totally right.

Personally I’d leave tailoring for later. I’d level with enchanting, u can disenchant your items as you level up. Take skinning, it’s free money that you can put towards your mount and wands.
---
Great job OP, especially on the changes. I'm really enjoying these :)
---
So can we expect 9 classes clashing tomorrow?
---
Yea you're a totally unique snowflake op. So very adorkable
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
These people are so mad when they can just steal it. 
---
No hate for anyone stealing from millionaires.
---
Literally this whole skeleton thing is just retards who have nothing better to do and want to complain about blizzard for yet another reason so they just pick on the most pointless nothing thing and have been blowing it out proportion and I honestly hope it never gets added cause these spoilt basement dwellers need to learn to take what they have been given and stop being greedy over the most pointless shit.
---
Amen. The lord has spoken!
---
As another person said, there's no mage trainer out there, but there are some pick-up quests you can do (the beached sea creatures) that might be easy to complete for a little extra XP. The fishing quest is super easy, too. I think it'll be just as packed in Darkshore as Westfall, though.

I've leveled from 1 to max a good 30 times. I've never used a guide before. This time I will.

I won't be using a guide, but I will have questie addon going. To make sure I get all the quests in an area done. I've done my time exploring I'm good on that, just rather get to 60 pvp and start farming bis.
---
A level 19 spamming LFG DM in Westfall probably isn't interested in Dire Maul
---
Why go on a road trip if you're just gonna google maps your route there.
---
May I have link please?
---
I mean the guy has spent a lot of time developing his leveling routes. I don’t see why he can’t try to earn some money from it.
---
Yeah my first thought .. rage is only from damage taken. Shield absorbs damage .
---
It doesn't really matter all that much.  My R5 Ryzen 2600@4.0ghz is pulling over 280fps in non populated areas and over 180 in populated areas.  I don't think it ever dropped below 160FPS in the most populated actionable area during stress test with probably 60 other players running around.
---
This is also running the game in Linux, I cannot say if it runs it better or worse precisely, but I feel like performance might have been slightly better than my windows system die to reduced overhead on the scheduler.
---
Could i get the link too please?
---
it depends whether the proc is per target or per cast, it behaved differently on different private servers and there is no guaranteed answer to this found in any old comments.
---
You can level as you like really. Personally im going fury till im level 40 then respeccing into arms. Then going prot at 60 for dungeon running till i get pre-raid bis and then going fury again.
---
Ride or Die
---
What do you think about dying in the cave after you picked the emblem and then ressurect in razor hill to pick up the quests there already?
---
I use wheel up and wheel down regularly.
---
Is there a way to save your progress on classicwow.live? Or otherwise navigate through the guide to particular zones or levels?
---
Very well said, completely unwarranted change, and only reflects what activision really is

You guys have psychological problems.

That's not how that works. I can decide not to pay for a product when it becomes no longer free, I don't have to not respect the person for making the decision to start charging for it. Respect's got nothing to do with it.

Not worked up, just refuse to accept arguments and bullshit from people who are genuinely angry at him (not you). Those typical internet warriors who can barely socially function and act as if they've been insulted when asked to pay for something someone's worked on for so long.

Vanilla guide addon. Dunno if it will be implemented in classic too.
---
Odd turn of events; what if... ^(a friend I know) has personality disorder, how does one choose a class?! Please, please help. I’m so torn, and want to play so badly on 1 main account. :c
---
Without gear you're not going to love mage.  Mage is a solid pick, don't get me wrong but if you put a gun to my head and said pick a class that's solid with MC or less gear, I'd go hunter. People forget hot hard Aimed Shot can hit in blues much less MC gear.
---
BEH GOOD
---
Yeah, I was excited to check them out, and the guides seem good, but I am not paying 5 bucks/month for this.  Make it 20 or 30$ one time, and I would have paid.
---
the beauty of not finding any guild or specific server to play on before release and the flexibility of not giving two fucks what name i use

TSM premium doesn't add functionality to the addon, it adds functionality to the external software, which provides data to the addon.

So not the starting zone as they asked. If they want to run there everytime then ofcourse they can do that.
---
I dind't read it that way at all - he said "Diplomas are a way to get your foot in the door" meaning that you'll get seen from the diploma.  The person replying disagreed and (to me anyways) is saying that the diploma wouldn't even get the person that minimum compared to someone with real experience.
---
I personally wouldn't do it because it's just not worth the risk.
---
It's a shame this time around it wont be much of an event.
---
As a UD I want a wolf so yeah
---
and is it still worth in your opinion?
---
Sadly, it passed me by. I heard about this "Vietnam" thing much later, in wotlk. But, I was there in Hilsbrad defending Tarren Mill for the honor of Horde. This time won;t miss all of this. I will be nelf rogue, 20s will be in Ashenvale, 30s in Southshore, attacking Tarren Mill, 30s Vietnam, 40 Feralas.  
---
Can't wait!!!!
---
&gt; Enhancement can sit firmly between Warrior and Rogue damage
---
No they can't, that's absurd.
---
Wasn't there some private server whose GMs sold Bindings? I wouldn't take too much stock in private server values.
---
Of course not. In fact it is weird using guides as you aren’t playing a game then. Just following a script like a mindless drone.
---
Thanks a ton. I appreciate it.
---
Smashing 60 quickly would imply that the guide worked and served its purpose.
---
Its like comparing apples to oranges. Well not quite, but still. I'm gonna use Zygors guides because of the ingame addon.
---
Where has this been decided? :) (DK here)
---
I'm not sure for classic, but I know back in the day Tauren can in fact ride that raptor because it's what I used. I remember grinding out honor to get that thing because I loved the way it looked, and used it through TBC!
---
Perfection
---
&gt;I still haven't tried any sort of tobacco product/drug/etc though.
---
Good, don't. Number one way to fuck up your life. Not even once.
---
Oh boi. Yes
---
They prob just gonna layer tbc on the same server.. You can stay or transfer layers
---
Is that including being human?
---
Fucking hell why did I pick rogue
---
I'm sure the paid guide won't end up on the pirate bay very soon, no sir.
---
It definitely sounds like you’re unknowingly leaning towards Horde, you got it bro!
---
Better than anything I'd make.
---
You are only thinking one dimensionally. That’s why you don’t see the error in your ways.
---
I'm fairly certain it was 3s 30c on the last stress test because my char couldn't afford it.
---
Menethil -&gt; SW was 3s 80c.
---
No one can tell you for sure how it will be. I’m rerolling firemaw and obviously I think it’s gonna be great. I like the look of the community, good faction balance, fast growth on server and discord pop, and not too many guilds or pservs yet. We were originally rolling shazz but it has way too many guilds, we’re talking many hundreds per faction before release.
---
&gt;Edit: Sorry, I can't share it with anyone. That would be piracy.
---
Damn, whats it like to be fucking retarded.
---
This is what it looked like during early TBC.

Ah, spamming frostbolt from 35y away, there is a chance to successfully raid then. Don't equip the pants in the head slot, though.

I thought it was Blizzard would just move all characters around the servers until they were even
---
You'll have to tab target spam, yes.
---
No I didn’t say layering causes that. I said sharding would be a good idea to Relieve pressure on the player base not the servers. Also since when has wow players every trusted Blizzard on the promise of a smooth day one launch?
---
It's a raid set. Not a pvp set. They get that to because they simply don't bring another warrior, "dps paladin" or rogue to the 5 mans. 
---
Fury needs hit just like a rogue and it's top dps in this gear. When they PvP they just throw on some  stam/plate and put an Arcanite Reaper on.
---
Mage would be nice with hunter since you both can peel enemies off of each other fairly well.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cth6f0/pala_ret_prot_in_classic/).

I want to level in Mulgore so bad, but I'm going Orc and I gotta level with my newbie friend in Tirisfal (he's going Undead), which isn't too bad I suppose.

LOL, now its some other engineers problem in a different server room ;)

As a warlock constantly getting whispers "summon me the pls" (this takes being in a parth and required 2 people to activate the portal) one night 2 friends and I joined up and summoned everyone who asked, summoning portal was over a cliff! #hordeonhordeganking

This is silly.  Everyone gets only one corpse.  No reason for more.
---
How does 1 person die and resurrect 10 times? The skeletons represent the amount of deaths that have happened in that area recently, not necessarily the number of people.
---
Yeah honestly putting on ML then pulling is just the shadiest shit and you instantly *become* the power tripping ninja-er to everyone in your group. If you want something so bad, organize your group so that no one else would possibly roll against you, otherwise you’re just a greedy POS imo
---
Female tauren master race mate
---
&gt; The alternative is cloth turn ins, but that might be changed as well. 
---
Why would you think this would be changed when that is how it was done originally?
---
But anyway, yeah, I'm sure some are, but I don't think it is worth it. It is just wasted time at that point since you can just go back when the rush stabilizes and do the lower level quests later on.
---
If you enjoy the game on your own for what it is, it is worth it. With 45 minutes a day any meaningfull group content is out so if you are looking for that this game might not be for you.
---
I'm fairly sure they reduced the xp required per level up to 60 shortly after or around the time of The Burning Crusade.
---
 Levelling my blood elf was significantly less painfully long than my tauren shaman was, I know that much.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. With that free hanging cord, his mouse is doomed.

Everyone says this, but where should I bind keyboard turn? Before “nowhere”, I know it’s bad for combat, but sometimes when just travelling through the world I like to be able to use one hand instead of two.

Umm ok? Thank you for proving my point you are a re re
---
Im about 95% certain that im going to play hunter (5% mage). Im going to play with 2 friends, one of which is going mining and the other is going herbalism. I plan to take skinning(for early gold)+enchanting(To DE drops from maraudon runs) and at 60, with enough gold, switch from skinning to engineering and level it with mats from the AH. I also thought about going mining+engineering from the start, but then we would have to fight over nodes. Another option would be skinning+LW but i dont know how good LW is... I absolutely want to have engineering in the end tho. I hope someone who knows more about professions is able to give me some insight :)
---
He didn't ask if there were druid trainers in the starting zone.
---
This and also getting berserker rage helps a lot.
---
Your problem is probably that you're over-sundering. You want to get a feel for exactly how many sunders is needed (usually only one or two per mob in low level dungeons), and not apply any more than that. Then after applying the appropriate amount you just stop using abilities at all. That way you have a good amount of rage going into the next group, and then you apply the sunders you need straight away and build up rage again.
---
Other than that, learn how taunt functions and use it liberally to keep the dps target stuck to you. Basically think of it as a high threat ability that costs 0 rage but has a CD (which is exactly what you want when you're struggling with rage). I also would avoid using demo shout in low level dungeons. Your healer is most likely not feeling pressured for most fights, and taking more damage = more rage.
---
Dude. My buddy. My GUY. That model I'm staring at want to EAT my soul.
---
It's fine, you will still enjoy it.  It's a living world that will create entertainment in its own way die to the population.
---
I probably am. I played Alliance 97% of the time the first time around... the most default combo too, Human Warrior.
---
Vanilla tanking comes down to the pull/quickly reacting to things getting out of control.
---
To start getting used to tanking use the following rotation.
---
Mark skull kill target: range pull skull, blood rage (rage generation generates threat), battleshout, (battleshout in vanilla is a major threat generator as it gives threat based on who you buff), sunder/revenge/hs/shield slam/keep shield block on CD. Don’t forget that you’ll need to tab over to the other mobs and generate threat on them as well.
---
This rotation will ensure all pulled targets come to you, even if say a healer has a hot on you.
---
Get used to using line of site when pulling.
---
Helps to add your target markers to your 1-9 on the keypad as well.
---
Anyways lots to tanking in vanilla but hopefully that helps some.
---
Is it 1998? That's the last time I heard someone complain about an improperly gendered MMO character.

For me endgame starts when i heal BRD while farming preraid bis at level 55.

As others have stated, simply contact him. Surely he'll grant you access for a certain amount of time. If not, THEN you can post spiteful comments ;)
---
You might want to try not being an ass.
---
If you're going to multi-box 5 shaman, may as well just make them all 30/0/21 and blow things up or top off the party with chain heal.
---
Druids?
---
So does that mean no one can make new characters there or just that it'll be a large queue? Have a friend who hasn't subbed yet that was going to play with me next week.
---
maybe they could implement some timegated quests so it takes months to complete while you only have to login 10 minutes a day... oh wait sorry thats retail forget what i said
---
Yea, at least people aren't complaining about people complaining about people complaining about skeletons...nvm you are LOL.
---
Self-awareness, do you have it?
---
&gt;u have to get the pattern yourself or buy it off AH. It's pretty common while doin
---
but that also means 6month no alchemy
---
And professions are irrelevant again... thanks classic.
---
Warlock, easy raids easy pvp
---
Yup. We'd convince low levels to store their hearth Stone and summon them to the bottom of booty bay, where the walk back was atrocious. 
---
I also had the account info for our (Alliance) guild leader and once as I prank I stripped him naked, emptied his inventory and got him to the top of Thunder Bluff. He was pissssssed when he logged back in.

Increasing honor gain from killing high ranking players especially ex-high rank players would be very nice for /r/classicwowplus . It's very frustrating that  rank14 players drop to low rank almost immediately from decay, and suddenly they aren't worth honor. And there's not nearly enough honor difference from killing a lvl 55 scout than a lvl 60 high warlord, it's like only half. Killing a high warlord should be a big honor gain.
---
Truly the hero we deserve. Now to host this free everywhere.

When i recently played slowly on Private server which are most likely not correct with shit.
---
I did level warrior to lvl 60 in 8 days and something + professions to 220+- skill. it took me maybe 2 months IRL.
---
I didnt play Vanilla before that since 2007, so it is not that hard to lvl under 10 days i would say.
---
Dire maul isnt even out yet, meaning DM means deadmines
---
Level up going your first 10 points into wand and spirit tap. After that until 39 it's pretty flexible actually but my take is you get 3 points in shadow focus and 2/2 in shadow word pain because you are going to use this ALL of the time and Mind Blast all of the time while you level and you don't want it resisted.  So this is base mandatory  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZZxMh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZZxMh) 
---
After that you can continue shadow if you're worried about PvP for imp psychic scream and silence...but better for leveling is to go into holy for the crit and faster smites and holy fires and heal spells which you will use until 39 quite a bit. Plus you can avoid spell push back which saves your ass in a lot of situations!   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZfxxZxMh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZfxxZxMh) 
---
Then at 40 respec to shadow and get ready to ROCK!   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZZxMgzctot](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZZxMgzctot) 
---
After that just put your points into Disc until you are 60  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVzGsVZZxMgzctot](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVzGsVZZxMgzctot) 
---
Then as you're grinding your preBis, go holy disc until you get gear healing instances.   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsm0oZdxtcc0Vx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsm0oZdxtcc0Vx) 
---
Then after you get some gear, you really don't need all of the holy points and you can go Disc...in fact, disc is probably better and there's a lot of variants there with or without PI, and if you're a PvP you'll want mana burn to go with PI because it is LOL awesome.
---
There's variants without PI that are pretty good too to get a bigger mana pool, like this  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsmVoZdxtcc0V](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsmVoZdxtcc0V) ...point is you have some flexibility.
---
but absolutey go disc once you're done doing the leveling and prebis grind.
---
You put those people on a list - the warning list if they have a RL emergency excuse, the blacklist if they're impatient. 2/3 warnings moves to the blacklist.
---
^(This post is half-serious.)
---
depends on what you're looking to achieve. If you wanna keep pace with friends that wont happen in 45 minutes, it takes me 30 minutes just to check my auctions everyday. Bit alot can be done in 45 minutes, you can do alot of quests and level. Only way to know is to give it a try and see how you like it.
---
I doubt it, you're gonna waste all this time getting there and the zone is gonna be flooded with more lvl6s that you wont get most quests done. Probably just camp telderssial till its safe to do darkshore   
---
   
---
I mean the only good NE class is druid and that was because you were forced too
---
No, DM was followed by a fucking direction for Dire Maul, as well as if there was a level 60 looking for a group to "DM" you were pretty certain which instance was meant.
---
When you wanted to do a Dire Maul run, you'd say "LFG/M DM West/North/East/Tribute"

Check out [wowclassicbis.com](https://wowclassicbis.com) or classic.wowhead.com. This is the recommended gear for Warriors.

---
I submit for consideration a name change for peak nostalgia: Guidewire
---
This can work if you ding 6 in valley of trials and grab your next set of abilities there, however during launch the cave will likely not give you that much exp as I got here since there are a lot more people, so usually you would grind to 6 from Sen'jin to Razor Hill
---
Name some alternative options that youdve preferred, please
---
Maybe you can't.
---
You cannot ride a raptor as a Tauren man
---
I think Hunter beats out Shaman on all 5.  I don't think ammo costs should be a very big consideration and Hunter has more farming options than Shamans (Mara or DM Tribute)
---
If you're going to invest a ton of time into Classic, then go warrior. However if you are going to no-life it, you'll probably be happier as a mage.
---
You can't really do this unless you want heavily nerfed rep rewards. If a quest is grey you don't get much rep.
---
You got it wrong. You want loot council to ensure the loot gets in the hands of the people who deserve it the most and the people who need it the most.
---
DKP is an awful system because you have no control over completing sets, giving upgrades to people who need it the most etc.
---
Healing in dungeons is easy for shadow spec unless your group is underleveled/undergeared. Don't worry about it
---
Not in the slightest though.
---
"HEAL ME!!!!"
---
" With what ?, my f**king wand?"
---
200 stacks at ~3g per stack is 600g.
---
But, I may overestimate the rep as well. Darnassus is the 2nd hardest alliance rep after all (and 4th hardest overall, thunder bluff, gnomeregan and trolls are harder). I think you can get around 20-22k rep from quests total (non-human), but it may go as low as 16-18k (thunder bluff has ~13k rep avaiable from quests total). 
---
So take that ~200 stacks as anywhere between 200-300 stacks. In general, if you want a mount from another race expect to pay 0.75-1.5 epic mounts worth of gold to get the rep there depending on how actively you do the faction quests.
---
ahh, I know enough people. Dont wanna know anymore. Lol

You're not ready.  I see no hot pockets, no Mountain Dew, or a bedpan.
---
I'd honestly stick to Westfall because you're going to want to do Dead Mines and the quest chain that leads up to it anyway.
---
What if I told you that *gasp* DM and VC can both be Deadmines!
---
Shocker, I know...
---
No one says DM for Dire Maul anyway, it is almost always prefaced with East, West or Tribute runs
---
I did the same but with a leveled wolf of the same type. So I would just kill them as the "npc" wolf in 2 hits, then run back and resume pathing.
---
Even without Thott and Alakhazam (wowhead came basically at the tail end of Vanilla), WoW was way more clear about what a player was supposed to do and where to go than pretty much every other MMO out there. If I remember, when it was released they claimed to have the highest number of quests by some huge margin. Like a factor of 2 or 3 compared to the next highest. And a big part of that was breadcrumb quests that led you into the next area or sent you to a new dungeon or introduced a new gameplay concept. Even as obscure as a lot of stuff might have felt back then without an external guide, it was still way more clear than pretty much every other MMO.
---
Yes assuming you don’t own a potato.
---
Tauren can't ride the Troll Raptor in Vanilla :(
---
My only issue with in game add-ons. I never follow guides 100% and it's easier for me to jump sections or merge guides when I have a website/pdf/doc version to go along with.  
---
For instance, I just avoid Darkshore and do Westfall/Elwynn/Loch Modan area instead for those levels.  Sure, it's a little behind the curve but when Darkshore is going to have a lot of people going there because 95% of guides send you there, I'd rather avoid it.  Plus, I plan to be 100% ready for Deadmines when I level.  It's a must have stop on my trip to 60.
---
Professions can be the 12th one :)
---
If you're trying to be competitive and you're worried about meters go priest. Resto druid healing isn't as robust as it was in TBC, so you won't really be casting hots just rank 4 healing touch. As a druid you'll be fine in 5 man's but in a raid you'll play more like a utility healer decursing and casting innervate on other healers.
---
Yeah.

 i pay for raidbots just to support the guy  and cause i am thankful for the site... i am pretty sure there are enough people who would pay for his guide even without locking them out .
---
Some of us are old enough to value  time put in sites , addons  , guides and are ok with  paying for that service.
---
when it looks like dev's are trying to force me to pay for something i am way less inclined to pay then when i have the choice to do so
---
But thats just me :P

This. Just testee it and it is great! Tells u ingame every step to do. It helps me in powerleveling. I dont want to use some other guide where you have to read and look up a lot, it takes only more time

bad timing happens in every business. He had other plans, but plans changed and went with this.

Roll druid.

You're going to put a lot of time into this character.  Play the one you want to play the most.
---
Would love to know this too, i checked Monday and it was still limited to level 45(46?). If thats still the case charging for the alliance version is bs, otherwise still scummy but its $5 cant complain too much.
---
k lol
---
It sure is beautiful, but who wants to have to quest back and forth in there *on foot*? Remember, Mulgore was designed back when Tauren were going to have plainsrunning from the jump. Having to quest that zone at walking speed is tortuous.

No, I'm a dude

Does that also include ArcGIS pro? Because I have a feeling that one works much smoother than ArcMap.

Yes, it is recommend but Salfriel, like myself, doesn't want to wear leather. Even if it is BIS. Not everyone is a minmaxer.
---
I agree that guides can ruin the experience for some people, but you should also understand it can enhance for others. I think a lot of people wish they were a kid again with no responsibilities and unlimited time logging into wow for the first time. That's not the case not for a lot of people. I know some that are taking vacation hours for launch so they are limited on time. They already experience all the discovering and know that for them, they want to relive the endgame content with their friends. They want to make the most of their time and get to where they want to be as efficiently as they can. Time is money friend

Only twits incapable of figuring out if the level 60 wants to do some fancy deadmines stuff involving and N or something had issues with this.

Having guides up for years and then suddenly, a week before the game re-launches and you decide to drop all of them behind a paywall comes off like a real dick move and a cashgrab. It screams desperation and fickleness. Not worth even the attention at this point. I didn't even know who he was until I started researching classic and his guides weren't anything special.
---
This alone is gonna make me level faster. In phase 1 I can focus on leveling, professions, and stuff before BG's are even a thing.
---
Cauthon did a Tauren warrior 1-15 in 4.5 hours....
---
His guide was something like 30 to 40 bucks back in Vanilla / TBC and trust me he did make plenty of money from it since there was very little competition.
---
He could have made so much money just continuing streaming and emphasizing how his guide is FREE of charge and how donations help him make it even BETTER but he decided to go for a dumb business model where even if he gets paid the guy can just screencap or CTRL + S the whole guide and then chargeback and there's nothing he can do.
---
I think he sold his guides for about $30, and he sold about 100k of them. Maybe he had discounts later or subtracted expenses, but yeah he made good money selling his guides.
---
I'm playing a Human Rogue, and was going to be on Thalnos before it went to full, now I'm going with whatever is the first server I'm able to get into, so your hordie is safe from me at least. But that doesn't save you from the other 5000 rogues that will be there. Tis World of Roguecraft again after all.
---
have you considered not playing classic until phase 2?
---
I was getting 400-600fps with a 6700k and 980ti.  Processor isn't going to make as big of a deal as you think it will.  I can get 60fps on my i3 8th gen laptop with integrated UHD 620 GPU.
---
I have fond memories of Azshara as well, thanks to Akama's low population. I grinded the last 4 levels by farming the Satyrs for Felcloth so when I dinged 60, I had my epic mount already. I remember the odd chinese farmer every now and then, but it was mostly a breeze for me as a mage to dominate the area.
---
It's true that it is kind of shitty but nonetheless his decision
---
But this isn't correct. I'm not pissed or anything but he literally did say it would be free.
---
Listen, I worked for 8 months to get that 7 days of vacation to work in conjunction with a holiday weekend.

---
Good point, and now Im torn again...
---
7960 actually
---
I thought you can’t change it while in combat. Is this not a thing in classic?? If so I would be be sorely disappointed. I’ll have to make sure to be group leader always so no one power trips
---
I actually enjoyed it too, plus on the walk over you get to actually have conversations with people too. In retail the conversation is basically 0.
---
Porque no Los dos
---
Despite all the criticism of Paladins I’m really considering playing one. That was my first main character in WoW back in Vanilla and I’d really love to experience it again. I know I won’t top the charts on anything but for me it’s more about the experience. Playing a Paladin again in classic just has so much nostalgia along with it
---
He made 1.8 million from his guides according to himself on classicast
---
It's just a number, we all start at the same time.
---
I actually think open world pvp honor is going to be exploited because I have seen server discord discussions already about trading between two opposite guilds to build up specific designated chars first.
---
Do on hit effects count for druid feral forms?   
---
Because fireball kitty just seems hilarious
---
Lol no. Just figured I would point it out in case maybe OP forgot
---
That cone is vanilla flakes, right? Right?!?? Stellar work.
---
I've decided on my faction (Horde) my 3 classes (warlock, warrior, hunter) but I can't for the life of me decide which race and name to pick for my bank alt.......
---
Does anyone actually know why there even are queues to login? Surely 10k (even 100k) requests can be handled far quicker than 8 hours, makes no sense? Why can't they just spin up some more instances of the login servers or whatever
---
Wouldn’t you leaving the party take him off of the free exp bandwagon?
---
Can't decide between UD or Troll priest. Planning on PvP and PvE. UD look way better in gear but trolls perform marginally better and don't look bad. Someone persuade me either way. Previous in WoW my first 2 characters were UD rogue and Troll hunter.
---
Vin was a WoW player too. He has a video on his Facebook of him and Paul Walker playing in Tanaris lol.
---
hows the threadmill/VR setup going? got any updates?
---
The rationale they gave convinced me it's probably the right thing to do. I don't think *everyone* on Whitemane wants to see the n word and swastikas perpetually displayed in every major city. It's too bad so many gamers are so shitty. 
---
This is ultimately something that provides only a minor benefit but can be a major headache.
---
Shaman. Its what I played in vanilla and still play to this day and what I'm playing again in classic. You offer SO MUCH UTILITY and there's nothing more fun than outplaying everyone in pvp with a mix of kiting, huge melee and spell burst, offheals, and countering abilities with totems, It's true; they're not perfect, they don't have optimal itemization, and min-maxers will tell you to play a warrior or priest or mage or not bother. But fuck that! I want the abilities of all 3. And a shaman offers that and more.
---
I agree completely. Honestly. While I liked Vanilla, TBC was my favorite phase of WoW followed by Wrath. I will probably enjoy Classic but the only reason I hope it performs well is so they do TBC. Maybe make TBC servers with the option to transfer from Classic to TBC servers.
---
Big disagree.
---
To me the single most disappointing part of Classic WoW is the lack of the ability to use new models. I was in MC on retail and the new elementals look SO BEAUTIFUL, I'd love to raid classic with those models.
---
Haha i agreed. I started wow when i was 17/18 and had all the time to play wow. I even skipped school for it with mates and yet i have a good job now for years. So boys and girls, school is worthless (just kidding, finish your school!)
---
Also its about enjoying the game. Gear is nice to have, but there is so much more to do. Especially the social part, help people out, co-op etc. So i am not worrying at all :)
---
No they won't.  In the AMA they said they upped the server queue limits and clarified the error message for when the queue is full.  
---
He just won't be able to queue and can save the 8 hours.
---
The info will probably spread to the french websites. I hope we get a second pvp server just in case
---
I was a Shaman for most of vanilla, loved it.  Great versatility, and you wreck casters in PvP.  Everyone talking about how shadow priests are unkillable never fought a good shaman.  Warlocks were the real problem towards the end...
---
But I digress.  Now I'm like "do I really want to do the same thing over again?".  So I'm thinking Alliance to change it up.  
---
But which Alliance?  Pally seems the obvious counterpart to shaman, but man, I hear they are super boring . Auto-attack to level, buffbotting, etc.  
---
So now I'm leaning towards priest.  I figure it will have similar versatility in PvP, and also come with the added advantage of being in demand for groups. 
---
But every couple days I have a panic attack.  Is priest really how I want to spend my time?  Do I really want to look at an ugly Dwarf's ass for the next few months/years?  Is everyone going to make a priest?  
---
Maybe I should be one of the 10 million people going mage or rogue.  Or hunter.  Or maybe druid...
---
It's annoying!
---
this gives a whole new meaning to "i ran all the way to the dungeon"
---
Sorry, mean't to say aren't. Will edit.
---
If getting killed in a video game is torture for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing games. A lot of us enjoy/enjoyed the random hijinks. It's more like a mean spirited prank except there are no real life consequences. I remember I got scammed in runescape when I was 9 and I cried about it, then learned a lesson and moved on. There's plenty of other games to play if that's not your thing.
---
I'm not doing anything wrong. If you find this confrontational because i'm not immediately agreeing with people's assessment of the average intelligence of vanilla players back in the day then you're just a brainlet.
---
Midnight launch? Are you in France?
---
Not if you are constantly switching servers.
---
I would love the link as well!
---
They could even snag some spells from tbc or other expansions. A ret pally with Seal of Blood, for example, could be pretty cool as long as they tweak the numbers and keep it from being OP or gamebreaking.

---
Anyone know how much better are edgemasters than the devilsaur gloves after accounting for the set bonus? It's it really worth the probably several hundred if not 1k gold price difference?
---
First you cant dictate human behavior. People that are set on playing on Herod already made their minds and will not switch over to the possibility of a dead meme realm months in ahead. Some are playing because they know it will be the highest population realm for days to come, even when the dust settles and people leave Herod, there will still be players on it compared to the other realms.  Other players actually just enjoy huge pop and would prefer if Herod was just transformed into a mega-server or had layering forever on but play with a huge pop. 
---
Secondly, Blizz has layering on these servers and they already stated they have the technical capabilities of raising the pop limit but are refusing to do so. Though, with layering, you can fit EVERYONE in and keep it as long as possible till the population dies down, then you can remove it. 
---
You are stuck between the 3 options;
---
1. allow everyone to play with layering
---
2. have a mega-server no layers but 50k pop
---
3. have people wait in queue knowing most wont switch realm regardless
---
I think the lesser of the two evils is the first two by far. If you dont agree with me, you are not HEROD material and shouldnt play with us, casual.
---
It's always funny to see a Norwegian/Scandinavian move to the US. They keep that reservation for a little bit, then an explosion happens and they become the MOST sociable and excitable person for a long while before settling into a rhythm.
---
No that's bullshit, the internet in 2004 was a lot more "toxic" than it is now. People weren't nearly as sensitive back then.
---
No I dont have that problem.  Know why?  The only game I play is Vanilla.
---
Same if you get it friendo
---
Halfway through reading this I grabbed my pitchfork but then saw it was a joke. Well played....
---
...People are raising pitchforks over $5?
---
&gt;Also just accept that people will pull aggro. A good tip is to figure out which mobs are quite weak (usually casters), mark that one with a skull and just let your group handle it while you take care of the other mobs.
---
noted - thank you.
---
From the sounds of it, it will be.
---
I turn off adblock for small content creators whose comics/articles/whatever I consume.  Maybe I'm just not as interweb cool as you, but I want the people and the small groups who rely on ads to pay their bills to be able to do so and continue making content I like.
---
Not necessarily. Anyone can push for 60 in under 60 days if they just spend enough time playing.
---
same. i love minotaurs and stuff but i dont like playing big races (my main since cata has been a dwarf) and i also hate kodos. i like every horde mount except for kodos. they are cool when they walk, not when they run.

Pursuit of Justice (Rank 1): Increase movement and mounted movement speed by 4%.  This does not stack with other movement speed increasing effects.
---
Pursuit of Justice (Rank 2): Increase movement and mounted movement speed by 8%.  This does not stack with other movement speed increasing effects. 
---
Checked both the 1.12 talent calculators as well as the spells themselves on both classic.wowhead.com and classicdb.ch 
---
Can you show me where this is wrong and carrot on a stick will work (or stack)?
---
I preferred planned merges, sharding limited to certain zones, or even more servers with no system at all beside dynamic respawns. I never thought the private server launches were as bad as they are made out to be (the better launches, anyway), nor do I think any system is necessary for as long as Blizzard is suggesting (hopefully they are just hedging).
---
Because it was an obvious mistake by the seller and sometimes people like to help out?
---
I played a Paladin and Rogue in vanilla.  Tried a Warrior on a private server...didn't realize until Lv30+ that it's basically just as slow as a Paladin.  Without the healing
---
well does it count if the server logs you off?
---
Like I said, I don't mind a one-off payment or something but I just loathe subscription models.
---
I'm pretty sure the only reason the project got the go-ahead by Actiblizz executives was they got told Classic players might eventually start playing on Live (since it's part of the same sub), and  go "Oh wow, the game got so much better," forget about Classic, and buy overpriced mounts and pets - or buy tokens with gold to get those things, since it's basically the same by proxy.
---
Hear, Hear!
---
I'll be happy to hit 60 by Christmas, but I'm a bit of an alt-oholic, so it'll be more like next year.
---
And I'm okay with that!

With Classic it's the journey, not the destination!

Wait... wut??

I feel like using a guide defeats the purpose of playing classic.

Went on a trip last week, didn’t use maps (except the paper one for the Washington coast to look at some trails), ended up finding a campsite deep in the Olympics by using the road signs (quest text). It was a much better adventure that a completely planned one.
---
Not if you are making a character and deleting it every 15 min or so.
---
The amount of entitled cheapskates in here is genuinely shocking.
---
&gt;That's basically the only point I‘d say that speaks against healers for me, I‘d love to do stuff solo too, no idea how capable priests and shamans are in that regard!
---
Extremely capable. Elemental shamans imo make better tanks than enhance (significantly higher damage/burst with a shield, elemental warding, more mana, etc.) and you can kite mobs indefinitely with clever use of frost shock and grounding. They are also capable of aoe farming lashers and kiting/aoe'ing dock packs in DM, as well as able to solo princess as elemental can negate a lot of the princess' damage while still bursting her down at range.
---
For PvP (battle groups or Wpvp) chain lightning domaintes AV and large scale wpvp.  Being able to drop earth bind and move is also critical at slowing or stopping routs. In battlegrounds, the ability to drop any target from 60% to dead while still being bulk and can heal in clutch -- as well as dispelling Alliance critical buffs like BoF, BoP, and caster shields.
---
Leveling as elemental is also significantly faster than enhancement post 40 with any amount of caster gear, as well as taking less damage with a shield. You also have the "logtistical edge" of not needing to constantly update your weapon and not needing a second healer set while leveling to do so.
---
Rogues are a solid pick if you plan on ganking inside towns or focus on small group pvp.  Hemo however isn't so great at PvE raiding so you may have to be paying a lot to respec or just deal with being sub par as ~20/30/0 combat.
---
I think the guides are useful in glancing at just to avoid running out of your way to complete a quest when another quest has a follow-up that will take you to the same area.  Especially if you're a class that doesn't have a runspeed increase, it can be painful to run to some part of northern barrens to do a quest only to find out some other quest chains into that same area so you have to run back and forth several more times than necessary.
---
If I pay for my own water and I’m drinking and you pull while I’m low on mana, I’ll let you die and make you run back eventually if you don’t listen to my OOM messages...it means you’re a shit tank and you should go back to retail. Mage water? Go ahead and Zerg I’ll take sips between pulls.  :)
---
Ahh i see so after valley of trials you go to senjin pick up the quests and grind straight up to razor hill. do you do the first part of Encroachment then or straight to vanquish the betrayers? Later when you collect the goblin tools and the crab stuff you gonna work your ways to the echo island quests i suppose?  Is there  a full 1-15 run from you?
---
what was the story ?

I swear druids are becoming the new hunter-weapon class.

That seems inaccurate. You only have to achieve it once. Why would they quit the game after making it to R14 if it took them so much effort and time? What are you basing this thought process on that people quit after reaching R14? I do not recall anyone quitting the first time around.
---
Cannot unsee
---
OK, so this is part of my problem then - demo shout.  As far as Battleshout goes, correct me if I'm wrong, but BS generates threat per party member buffed.  So, if I run in, and I'm the only party member engaged in combat, won't that generate threat only based on me?  There are so many Warrior mechanics I have to learn, and they're complicated, unlike my Mage - pew pew pew pew drink.

I don't think Joana made one, but there's a guide out there by Jame (or James) for ally (I didn't level ally). Also, someone ITT posted this link, which should work for you: https://classicwow.live/leveling

Blizzard said how to do this for undead themselves, so I would't think so.  It's just changing a value to a 1 in a text document or something where changing the cat model would require editing or replacing full files.

Pro-tip, next time say your girlfriend who is super retarded made it and also surprised you on your 15th anniversary. You'd have gotten a billion upvotes
---
Considering Classic will run for 2-3 years before a potential TBC / WotLK, and you will be given a considerable heads-up before it happens, I wouldn't worry too much about that in your decision as you'll have plenty of time to level up an alt.
---
I think people are planning for too far into the future, and not considering how long classic is actually going to be going for. I'd suggest focusing on what you'd enjoy playing through all the patches/stages.
---
People claiming 8 hours are talking out their ass. Blizzard refused to give us estimates and thus people are speculating without evidence.

Do I do Tauren warrior or Tauren shaman?

Yes let's believe a liar at face value why not :)

I had a really kind hearted fem tauren hunter called Daisy that helped me out so much through vanilla to tbc, wish I could thank them for all they did back then.
---
Depends on your race and what weapon you're using. If you already have 5 weapon skill from a racial edgemasters aren't very good. If you don't have weapon skill from anywhere else edgemasters are worth 3% hit against a +3 mob (raid boss) and will reduce your glancing blows to 5%reduction.

This is probably more Zack Snyder's fault lol.

---
This is beyond amazing, might get it printed too.
---
It eased my nerves a lot as well. I think they could have been more open and up-front with this information months ago and it would have calmed a lot of our fears. I'd prefer if they didn't wait until the week before to finally clarify all of these points, but I'm glad they did anyway.

Pservers had the values of rogue diary way off, so for a while people thiught you could do pretty good money per hour in BRD.  This is no longer the case and it is a very minor income at best

That isn’t the general consensus.

The only thing you'd really be missing is mana tide.  Moot if you're in a group that doesn't benefit from it much, and you aren't swapped around for mana tide rotations.

looks like CDT (cooldown timers) I could be wrong.
---
If you want to world PvP, I don't see a good argument to not be a rogue. Rogues are only overpopulated because they're one of the best classes in every way. One of the best dps, solid cc, best interrupt, and best pvp class. In WPvP, you also get to pick your battles with stealth, which is the mlst powerful thing possible.
---
If anything it would definitely be both, not one or the other
---
You're very welcome :)
---
Go rogue, as much as I like shadow priests, spamming mind flay swp and mind blast isn't something I want to do for hundreds of hours.
---
Well, he has the right to.  He's well-known and wants to make some money. People will be trying to get any advantage they can to get past the first few leveling zones quickly so they can get an early head-start.
---
It should persist. For the whole 2 minutes.
---
They just don’t want you using chat to talk about real life things. The want as total of an in game immersion as possible. They want to weed out memes and immaturity and play the game as pristine as possible.
---
I'd rather play than watch someone else play. I guess I just dont get the whole streamer thing.
---
Rogue and Spriest are both good in 1v1, yes. However, neither are amazing in 1vX. Sap requires you to be in stealth and any other cc you use on a different target is cc you don't use on your main target. Spriests run out of mana before they start fighting the second guy.  
---
For 1vX, I'd suggest looking into warlocks and mages.
---
[SPELLS CAN CRIT (HEAL TOO)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_critical_strike)
---
I suppose, if you're grouping a shaman in a caster group. I would think they'd like to toss a Shaman in with some melee for the Windfury buff.
---
Tbh I'm stuck between this classes too and rogue, played them all on pseevers, I think lock has amazing tier 1 gear, they scale real nice, just use succubus and chain seduce and win every 1v1 :)
---
Mage has the opportunity to reset fights or leave them, just sheep and run, they have better 1v2
---
For me they are kinda equal tbh, damn so hard to pick one!
---
It's the only ability on the action bars.

It's a joke, you see

Can I get a source on this? First I'm hearing of it, but I'll admit I haven't been keeping up with the speedrunning side of things.
---
Now this takes me right back. I remember seeing the Zinwrath video and jumping into WoW for the first time not long afterward
---
People pick the weirdest shit to cling to. This feature honestly has the most marginal positive and huge negatives. First off, the use of skeletons or just characters in general to spell things out NEVER affected the amount of in chat spam. Your argument that there will be more chat spam is based completely on a false assumption. I don't know if you never played, don't remember correctly, or just thought it sounded like a good argument, but it isn't.
---
As for the actual advertising with corpses, that's not what Blizzard really cares about. They care about people using skeletons to spell out racial slurs much more. It's the sort of thing that will make people quit the game, or get them in trouble for not policing it well enough. It is also a thing that definitely did happen and I can only imagine would happen more today than it did in the past.
---
Finally, to the immersion point, I'd actually argue that one skeleton per person actually can be more immersive and offer better gameplay. Now if you see a bunch of skeletons in an area you actually know it's an active war zone vs "oh a bunch of skeletons at blackrock mountain, just another thursday."

&gt; Is Imp. Drain Soul really worth it at all? Your dmg has to be the one to land the killing blow, so a not insignificant portion of procs will be stolen by your demon.

I believe Imp. Drain Soul proc's off your demon getting the killing blow as seen in this [Beta footage from June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gbnZ3yrPRo).

And if it doesn't, you just create a macro to stop your pet from attacking before channeling Drain Soul.

Ask the guild that gave you the slot. As a warrior, as long as you have basically a 100% attendance, you will never lose your spot, that I am pretty sure about. As a druid you offer superior threat during Phase 1 and 2 as well as for BWL iirc. Druids bring the utility more than anything in the end. So, better ask your soon-to-be raid lead what he or she thinks about that, before you surprise everyone with suddenly showing up as a druid.
---
Whats the deal with addon
---
There's a naming convetion on rp realms that is loosely followed (you need to get reported) so you can't name yourself bigcritties or something the sorts.  
---
Other than that, expect more people to get together in popular hubs like inns and cities in rp realms. World pvp should be the same.
---
Yeah I kinda forgot that we don't really have loading times anymore. So used to not see them I kinda forgot why they don't exist.
---
There's no way he made that much money off the classic guides.  I played on several private servers and lots of people used those guides, but not $2 million worth of revenue, especially considering how many private server players are from low-income countries where you don't make much money from showing them ads.
---
1. Is an option because they said that when people are engaged in pvp combat, it will take a few minutes before they can be able to switch layers if invited to someones party. 
---
The third is not solvable without choosing one of the first 2 options. If you have a better idea, let me know. And no, there are no better ways to make people move away from overpop server if all they want is to play on a overpop server. A lot of my friends of pservers arnt gonna play classic because they said the pop is dumb and theres layering.
---
I paid the first time when I was 14 so why do I have to again?
---
Well, My daughter and I have both reaubbed for 6 months for this. We haven't had an active account since Cataclysm. I'm sure there are 1000's doing the same thing
---
i dont think people are really focusing on one problem
---
complaining about skeletons just shows me you can never please everybody... it's fine how blizzard is handling it... don't like it? don't play it I guess.
---
It also means people will be ganking you cause they want to and not cause they need to farm their ranks.
---
It would put me off if they read absolutely every word, I usually read faster than most and get bored when I've already read ahead and have to wait for the person to catch up.
---
If they just gloss or skim over it it's fine for me though.
---
You might want to look into MOBA mouse instead, they should have 6 buttons on the side while keeping the shape almost the same.
---
Look at this fancy guy with the luxury of Enjoying a game. He doesn't have to feel the pain of being expected to be raid ready by week 2, clear content by week 3. He isn't expected to help his guild control the devilsaur market or is even forced into farming rep for aqual quintessence.
---
It’s not hard to understand, it’s a very common form of entertainment to watch people do things because the activity or their personality is engaging. Sports, talk show hosts, or a more specific example of watching competitive gaming because the level of play is high. Or even just checking out a game to see if it’s any fun. You don’t have to like it yourself, but it’s not some absurdly foreign concept
---
You also need 2 bags just for the ungodly amount of collection quests.
---
I will take care of your wifes :P
---
That guide is trash. Has pserver bugged quests routes. Starting zone shouldn't give you the ability to get Vile Familiars quest twice as Warlock.
---
If they can't get starting zone correct I can only imagine the shit they ave later levels.
---
World pvp isn't the main concern when leveling in my experience, at least in the 1v1 sense. If it's 1v1, you'll almost always be facing someone higher leveled and better geared during the leveling process and you're screwed anyway.
---
thottbot.com or wowhead
---
I would use this but not being able to select level range and save progress is a deal breaker.
---
You removed the best part of that cat tree! My cat loves that stupid bowl that hangs off the side. She sleeps their daily.
---
His guides were paywalled originally back in vanilla. There’s so many free guides that work great. There is zero reason to ever pay for one.
---
I thought questie! was enough but what do we need someone to play the game for us too?

Had he finished the add-on like he planned to do I could see charging. But he didn't, so...
---
Traitorous alliance scum
---
Since you can only shadowmeld out of combat, the only case that I could think of where it might help is in a specific case where you see someone coming, your charge is on cooldown and the enemy class cant reveal you or go stealth.
---
Which is like such a edge case, might happen once in a year of playing. You will use the gnome racial every time you get stuck in any kind of slow or root.
---
Yeah, you'll be fine.
---

300k subs - 1 week after launch 400k, then it starts dropping drastically 1 month in.
---
/u/zamglow is his brother. Maybe you can ask Joana how those of us who donated to him because he kept his guide free and appreciated his contact can get their money back so they can pay for a now-not free guide?
---
I'm in the same boat except I will be doing more pve. Kind of want to play a mage but it seems their will be an over abundance of them. Should I be worried about that and roll a warlock or not that big of a concern?
---
Why are bots the cause of any dissenting opinion for you people?
---
&gt; shaman
---
Its extremely common to be specc'd ele resto or similar, as raid PvE gear is really more important than being deep resto unless you're absolutely full blown 0/5/46 PvE hero mode.
---
Ele resto of any flavor (31/0/20, 30/0/21, 31/7/13) are are extremely capable builds solo, dungeon healing, early raid healing (with a proper dealer deck) and pvp.
---
Biggest thing to learn for PvE healing in vanilla/classic is the concept of downranking when you get some good +healing numbers, and pre-casting.  Try to mitigate over healing and you'll be fine.
---
I suppose it depends. 
---
If a decent streamer gets his streamer luck and gets in while I'm 433,000 in queue and the timer says 96,000 estimated minutes, then yes, probably.
---
If I get in, probably not.
---
Man....don't care what internet says everyone that's really played WoW knows heals don't crit. It's unpossible.
---
Warlocks are medium (but adequate!) DPS in raids until we get to a later Phase, but being able to summon party members is always going to be in demand.  Having utility like that can definitely make up for not being perfectly geared or topping the charts.
---
I was called a baby and told to go back to BFA because I said this was a trivial thing to worry about. Seemed pretty ironic, but it can be hard to express that to some of these "passionate" people.
---
Possibly the best zone in the game
---
Getting a huge paycheck for turning in a wooden, un-emotive take on the very man who's synonymous in comic books with "truth, justice, and the American way" is a good career move probably, and definitely got his name out there. Other than that, though, he's not known for much; he's starring in a Netflix adaptation of a video game series and has a few villain/supporting character credits to his name. Probably the only reason he was in Mission Impossible: Fallout is because he was famous from Man of Steel/Batmeh versus Supermeh, and that just ended up costing him cred because of the whole CGI-face thing anyway. :P
---
So basically, "he's starred in crap" doesn't properly assert itself as a defense of him turning in a crap portrayal to boot. ;)
---
/r/ChoosingBeggars there you go

Yeah, it is usually quite a bit pessimistic, so if you don't dick around, you should be positively surprised.

Its perfect.
---
Played RP my entire retail life. Barely any difference whatsoever. RPers don't walk around getting upset by everyone else playing, they go RP privately. Don't have a dumb name like daviddruidlol and you're good.

What a fucking 2019 lgbt reason not to have skeletons... Hate speech? What?!

They are working on something to save progression and skip through the steps faster, devs say it will be released before launch

It's been a bit since I read his autobiography, but I'm quite sure he didn't have a trainer when he started. Bodybuilding wasn't a big thing back then were athlethes could afford a personal trainer.

We don't need your hunter, feel free to go warrior
---
Thats why you can't trust the media.  Heals have never crit

What's the cost to print something like this?

Why do you need a guide as horde? the whole point of the faction is that its braindead easy to level because every zone past 20 has a KFC hut questhub in the middle with flightpath and every amenity possible.
---
What class does the most in PvP when behind in gear.  I'm thinking about playing rogue and making the Best of it with cc like sap, blind and gouge just being a huge annoyance.  Trying to draw attention and narrowly escape death.
---
Too soon executus
---
Mage or warlock. Doesn't matter. Just play whichever makes you the least bored. PvE rotations are pretty mundane for both.
---
Vanilla didnt
---
Classic does
---
Huh, sweet!
---
There is plenty of hard content in retail, but the reward is seeing the same things you already saw on an easier difficulty.
---
Personally I think the social game design of classic is a more important difference though.
---
The queue is from the realm cap for active players. They know how many accounts have created characters on Herod. Blizzard is communicating that the # of accounts on Herod far exceeds the realm cap for active players. If you’re on Herod and don’t want to deal with queues of several hours or more, then switch servers.
---
Feeling the need to tell people they’re cringey is pretty pathetic tbh
---
The fact the world is still in the post-cataclysm state 8 years later is sad.  Part of what made vanilla special was how peaceful it was.  Now, Menethil is literally still underwater with NPCs floating on wagons and shit.  Like it's perpetually stuck at 10 minutes after a natural disaster.  It looks horrendous.
---
I also agree about Night Elf zones.  Nothing positive happens, it's just progressively 'more and more shit gets destroyed and you get nothing'.
---
Shadow - BIS 1v1 in PvP. Mana issues if fighting more than 1 enemy. Likely to have high competition for limited raid spot due to higher than previous amount of priests. Average raid DPS with mana issues.
---
Disc - Only class with offensive and defensive dispell in PvP. Versatile PvE healing toolkit with high demand. Easy dungeon/raid groups. Limited mobility/defensive survivability when focused in group PvP.
---
Mage - Amazing QoL abilities with free food, teleport, tons of utility and superior farming capabilities. Boring PvE rotation until Phase 3 when fire. PvP god - Control class with best CC in the game. High utility, 1vX potential, insane survivability with double block/barrier and aoe snares/blink. Very slippery when played well.
---
Shaman - You would have to ditch your guild. Totem management isn't for everyone. Likely forced to heal in PvE. Totem management can be a pain for some. Great offensive PvP healet with purges and burst capabilities. Not useless solo DPS in PvE heal spec. Ele is extremely fun in PvP but requires gear. Can PvP/PvE as ele/resto without needing to respec.
---
Feral - Highest survivability and versaitility in the game. Able to dance around opponents and escape 1vX. Can win WSG single-handedly. Stealth is the best spell in WoW for WPvP. Able to PvP/PvE in same spec. Typically forced to heal or tank in PvE, subpar DPS and high skillcap in PvE with powershifting. Needs to farm Manual Crowd Pummelers from Gnomer weekly to perform as DPS. If tank, you will likely offtank and be expected to DPS half the time. Requires multiple sets of gear for different encounters/activities. BIS gear is one of the easiest to get, lot's of blue BIS items used through later phases. Battle rez only available once per 30 minutes. Can make dungeon healing inconvenient if more than one person dies and no other rezzer in group.
---
True, I see a lot of people say mages are better for pvp than warlock on Alliance.
---
Is "Joana" some kind of transsexual?
---
If you can't give him 5 bucks for Joana's work, you're a cheap piece of shit.
---
Warlock leveling is a breeze, especially once you get a wand. You have basically zero downtime due to lifetap and you can solo plenty of the elite quests.
---
I would suggest going down the affliction tree, starting with improved corruption to make it instant-cast.
---
Quest Helpers are the one add-on I'll vehemently avoid.  Getting lost and wandering was part of the original experience I enjoyed.  To each their own though!
---
not to mention the healing you get from vamp embrace keeps your downtime pretty low
---
I concur.  Heals do not crit.  Doesn't matter how much hit rating you have.  Your crits will still miss.
---
Yeah played last night some and I'm not feeling it. I'd rather keep mining for 99 at MLM in OSRS nearly 92.
---
I believe ArcGIS Pro is built on new code and is kind of a new beast altogether.
---
I suppose it depends on what you want to focus on more, healing or DPS/large group PvP or more solo ventures.  
---
I can smash up some pros and cons regarding PvP for each class since I've mained a warlock for 15 years and had a shaman alt just as long.  
---
Shaman;
---
* Incredibly strong support heals
---
* Has purge which is invaluable against most classes and especially in premade PvP
---
* 30/0/21 basically turns you into a healer with a nuclear bomb worth of burst damage
---
* Fairly tanky with being an orc and also having mail/shield
---
* Totem support is very strong  
---
* You're weak against rogues and fairly limited in mana
---
* Can take a while to get gear for it since you'll be competing with casters.  
---
Warlock;
---
* Tanky for a clothie
---
* Quite a few viable specs for PvP
---
* STUPIDLY powerful once you get gear, you end up having the highest fight to fight burst in the game pretty much
---
* Immense amount of tools with pet utility, curses and spellstones
---
* Lots of neat tricks you can do against better players using Engineering reflect trinkets, i.e reflecting a low rank corruption off of a mage to fuel Nightfall procs and make you immune to sheep resets. Or reflecting a curse of recklessness and be immune to fear against priests/locks/warriors.
---
* Great control and has a lot of different tools for CC
---
* Healthstones and Drain Life makes sure you get some pretty decent regen and longetivity
---
* Life Tap gives you options for when you go OOM, less limited by mana.
---
* Better suited for WPvP/solo than shaman.  
---
* Not as valuable in premades as shaman but still very strong.
---
* Soul Shard farming can be an annoyance for some people
---
* "Weak" against rogues and warriors, but as an orc most rogues will actively avoid you due to how terrifying you are to face.  
---
Just some quick pros/cons of each class from my experience, if you want anything more in depth or such you can just ask and I'll try to give you answers to the best of my ability.
---
I will say that both classes absolutely LOVE engineering, due to how melee are the biggest threat to you. Rocket boots, MC cap, rocket helmet, grenades etc are absolutely invaluable tools for each of these classes due to their inherent issues with in-combat mobility.
---
My experience back in the day as a resto Shaman, was that after enough time passed and we were farming MC and BWL on alt runs and off nights, I got to appease my elemental urges and pew pew lazorbeems to my hearts content. 
---
Not for progression though unfortunately.
---
Technically no, I believe you could Shift+Right Click and it would auto loot
---
If you held shift it looted everything.
---
Any login min-maxers here? Any comprehensive guide on how to get into the game ASAP?
---
Don't bother  ask streaming related questions In this sub....
---
I think that is because they are makeing $ with the product like goldsellers. WoW and all its content is owned by Blizzard therefore only they are allowed to monetize the content and its game systems.
---
Joana compiled information about the game, that is the difference.
---
Still I am not sure if its 100% legal though the more I think about it.
---
I mean its not like they already paid for it through patreon and twich subs / donations when he hinted at it being free or anything.
---
BECAUSE EVERYTHING I WANT NEEDS TO BE FREE
---
\#FAX
---
Why would you pay for something that isn’t even going to be complete (class steps) and no in game addon on launch?   I would have gladly paid if it was actually complete.
---
I know someone who years ago who had a college job at a gas station that was robbed.  Police caught the guy, and he decided to plead innocent and the whole thing ended up going to trial.
---
He was called as a witness and the defense started peppering him with questions that he himself said he did an awful job answering.  What brand of VCR was the surveillance system.  What type of lightbulbs are in the parking lot lights.  If the suspect's car was a coupe or a sedan.
---
After his questioning, he said to the prosecution lawyer that he felt awful, he was really nervous, didn't know any answers to the questions they asked him.  His lawyer said *"Listen, when they are asking you 'what kind of lightbulbs are in the parking lot', you know you got 'em and they just have nothing else.'*
---
Kinda sounds like the skeleton complaints.
---
how is your experience gold/silver wise in the stress test, did you get enough silver by the levels you had to train / buy bows? I'm thinking about picking up skinning when i take the harpy quest from the goblin near OG. I think the constant money boost from skinning can help a lot.
---
Shift Right Click was in Vanilla
---
I never played wow before but plan on playing classic. For other MMOs I played DPS classes but with wow I want to play as a healer but I have no idea which healer to play as. I will be playing casually and want to have fun. From what I have  seen shaman and paladins are really good. My question is what are the pros and cons of each? Thanks.
---
Wrath babies smh
---
I don't think he's a bad guy for making the guide paywalled, it's his decision to make regarding his creation. I just think it's an idiotic decision even if you're only looking at it in terms of profitability.
---
Same classes for me.  Orc lock vs orc/tauren shaman.
---
I love the theme and versatility of shaman, and I know that Ele can blow people up in PvP, but for PvE they are expected to heal (which is fine with me, but if you ever get bored it's hard to get accepted as a dps role).
---
Warlocks can be raid bosses if SL spec, and are great for PvP from what I have seen.
---
I'd roll shaman in a heartbeat but I know respeccing from the Ele/Resto PvP build to Resto for raids will be very expensive.  Warlocks can roll with the SM/Ruin build for both and be effective.
---
Except when it was free and now it isn't.  That's the problem.
---
Your answer to "I don't want to be griefed by my own faction exploiting cross-faction communication" is to play on a pve server instead? Surely you can't really be that stupid.
---
Only one question I had was answered. They only answered 60ish questions in 2 hours. They avoided any questions regarding in game content like the plague it seems.
---
&gt; your girlfriend who is super retarded 
---
the phrasing made me pause for a moment and wonder where you were gonna take that statement.
---
What class do you play? 7 days /played is quite doable on even the worst (warrior) if you don't screw around with pvp/professions.
---
*Insert Let's Go Meme Here*
---
"demanding money" for a product he's put in hundreds of hours of his time and effort to create? lmao the entitlement of you people... Ever thought that maybe he feels better about creating a product and selling it to support himself rather than straight up asking for a handout?

Can't tell if you're trolling or got problems reading. The guy I responded to was talking about post Naxxramas content and I added, if they were to do that, they should at least tweak classes then. Ask the guy who asked about post Naxxramas content and not me.
---
Hey man I'm NS too.  If you happen to be in search of a guild look up "World of Warcraft Canada (Classic)" on FB.  Majority NS and Nfld folks in the Horde guild.
---
Given how wildly successful Legion was I'm sure they're well aware...
---
If you're on horde, go druid, the warstomp racial and increased hp will be a huge factor for pvp. Feral can also be just as annoying as rogue, but in different ways (kiting)
---
Will you use it with questie too?
---
distributing content that is being a pay wall without permission
---
I started to doubt your technical expertise when you questioned why they don't use the cloud.
---
World of Warcraft in 2004 was literally made to be more casual and accessible than any MMO had ever been. It got called “the carebear game”. You literally actually do not know what you’re talking about
---
Pm a pdf if you make one :)
---
Shoot, I plan on using this week to jump start my workouts.  Playing on a private server I learned that you can get a LOT done during all of the downtime in wow.  I would be flying somewhere and knocking out 2-3 chores.  I had to craft 10 things? Did a quick yoga routine. Waiting in an instance? Knock out 2-3 sets of weights.
---
There's no point of camping at Menethil Harb if the guys you stalk can get invited to a new layer if out of combat. Legend of Angwe would be dead. Layering is a problem for World PvP and all the guys I know won't even consider playing classic with layering.
---
from the way it looks now, your friends are safe, there're 2 mega servers forming (Shazzrah and Herod) and I don't see them dropping down pop.
---
What a cringy rp player
---
Classic will be around for a long time, you likely will be able to gear your alt.  
---
I've had both a shaman and a hunter alt, either is a great choice.  
---
Personally I've always loved shamans.
---
A black Qiraj'i tank in this picture, god this is rare
---
He’s just standing there... MENACINGLY!
---
Well, unless you're switching to one of the new servers that releases on launch, it won't be very exciting right when the button turns on because you'll be sitting in a very long queue.
---
Why not just make it an option to report said advertisement in the help screen?
---
I mean I'm planning on levelling like I did in vanilla when I had no idea who Joana was and didn't think to look for a guide. I will use the squishy mass in my skull called a brain
---
Didnt he make a couple hundred thousand(Article said millions but no proof afaik all speculation imo) selling the hard copy guides back in the day? Guy must have expensive tastes if hes budgeting after all these years.
---
Making me wonder if I level a mage or a rogue first..
---
Shift click. 
---
My pinky is so used to it now, the muscle memory is strong.
---
Oof
---
With all these patches you're moving so far away from the original vision this isn't the same game anymore. I'm unsubscribing until you bring back vanilla. &gt;:(
---
Feral is kiting, rogue is stun locking.
---
&gt; To the people saying that it's only 5 dollars are missing the point entirely.
---
&gt; Some of us have donated money and subscribed to him because he said the leveling guide was going to be free. As of now he said those of us that have donated and subscribed based on his promise will not be getting the guide.
---
&gt; That and the fact that he never mentioned this would be happening on any of his streams. It's pretty shitty and shows he's a shady person.
---
&gt;
---
Aye, that they did matey
---
That literally never happened, it's a boogeyman Blizzard made up as an excuse for removing persistent skeletons.
---
Welcome to Stalagg Gang.  Just uhhh dont tell anyone else to do this ok I really dont want to continue to migrate.
---
The only thing TSM premium does is update the server scans at a faster rate than once every 6 hours. If you're actively using the Auction House and scanning, it doesnt matter if you use premium or not. It's only useful for those checking things while not logged in.
---
You can just die from mobs.
---
there is a fix for that
---
The twitch client has add-ons that are listed as compatible with classic.

Too bad he's not the only game in town anymore.

Don't forget to get some red snappah for warlord Gorchuk.

I don't want to end up in realm that dies down and is empty (case of picking Firemaw), or end up in the realm where trade chat is in unreadable because of the language. I want to invest my time where it's going to fit my requirements the most because I don't have that much free time to spend on game as I used to.
---
I think it's very reasonable to try and pick fitting server.
---
Remember what tier 2 warlock looked like before 1.9?
---
I had a similar setup at one point, but I couldn't keep my mouse hand steady enough, so I gave up on it.

Nor in Warcraft 3 apparently

I think it's pretty consistent.
---
Is leaving this as is going to let people exploit, harass others, or somehow ruin the play experience for others?
---
If no, #nochanges
---
If yes, make some alteration that affects actual gameplay as little as possible.
---
Yeah, just proves that some pathetic people will never be happy.
---
Blizz pretty much demolished everyone's issues with layering, so now all the dumbasses who were the loudest about that feel they need to bitch about something else.
---
I await your Druid version sir
---
Because people who complain are entitled shits. Same people who complain in their 7-man guild they cant get shiny epics like people who raid does.
---
Yeah you will be fine, 4k is still memory intensive though so you might want to limit down to about 60hz or it can backlog the memory and cause stutter with that GPU, though it shouldn't with 6gb, I can't say for sure.
---
I play with a slightly faster GPU (2060) at 2k and can keep 144FPS to match my 144hz monitor to give you a point of reference.   Mine is a desktop though
---
Now being said, since that's a mobile system your looking at about 20% less performance than a desktop system with similar specs due to the way they clock the systems to manage heat.
---
To me, 60hz w/60FPS should be quite manageable with that setup in 4k.  You might see some issues in cities or heavy raids dropping you a bit lower, but overall a smooth experience.  If you have issues, just take the resolution down a notch or reduce graphics to a 7 or 8 or something.
---
Buddies and I are going for full T0.5 sets while working full time jobs and for some of us, taking care of our kids. It's a minor goal for some but feels like T3 for us and we couldn't be more hyped.
---
In my early 20's I wanted to be server first for a lot of raid content etc.  Now in my mid to late 30's, I think I'm content with doing casual 5-man's and just using WoW an IRC chat. $15/month felt like so much back when I was a broke college student.
---
Wtf he was recruiting hardcore people to get world first rag kill lol.
---
IRL frauds.
---
Knee-jerk reaction. Read their comment more thoroughly and then see if your expectations are met in release. Seems like such a nit-picky thing to go after.
---
It's a subscription because it's supposed to be constantly updated and improved, how often or how much it's improved is up to him. If you want to pay for a month and download the content then go for it.
---
&gt;  Hell I'd have given him money if he said on the website "Please donate 1-5$ to this guide for all the hard work put into it."
---
Weird thing to say considering he actually does have a donation link that was recently changed to a patreon link. If what you said is true, then why didn't you donate?
---
&gt; Plus there's people that donate while he streams.
---
What people give him during his stream is no way a substitute for paying for the guide. Donating on twitch is just that, supporting a twitch channel. Where does it say "donating on twitch entitles you to my guide"?
---
&gt; He has a patreon.
---
You said you'd donate if he allowed it, so why not donate then? That's literally what the patreon is for. Also he only has ~100 supporters on patreon and it's safe to assume the majority used the lowest 3$ tier. That's not very much.
---
If you want to use a free guide then go for it. If what you said is actually true then go donate like you said you'd would instead.
---
I will be doing this exact thing with my hume.
---
Way late but was curious if there’s a chance to edit our characters that we created for name reservation.  Most of us probably will need to recreate our character and have a friend “reserve” the name while we literally create the character as we’d like.
---
Even if you are right (i doubt the nordic community is 80%), that doesnt make it a nordic community when it only consist pf Swedes, that can't be tough to understand?
---
MAX HASS!!!
---
Hammered is solid. I went with "Madlad" because I'm leveling as Holy 😅
---
MC and Ony can be done with ~30 as long as people are decently geared (i.e., not BiS but not fresh level 60 gear) and know what they're going. It can be done with much fewer than that with gear from higher raid tiers.
---
The later raids are harder. As far as I'm aware very few guilds ran AQ and Naxx with much fewer than 40.
---
Many MMO conveniences have externalities that don't get appreciated.
---
For instance: yes, it's fun to have flying mounts.  Flying mounts make you feel powerful. They're convenient.  When everyone has flying mounts, however.. it begins to drain people away from the world.  That's an externality to flying mounts.  Instead of seeing people on the ground interacting with things, now 95% of players hop from node to node from the sky, or are AFK 500 feet up, and you never see anything in the world anymore.  And that leaves the game feeling empty.  So flying mounts have immediate, obvious benefits that put dollar signs in people's eyes, but they fail to see how the cumulative effect of flying mounts is negative on the world.  Just like when a corporation dumps toxic waste into a river.  They may make more money, but the costs for the entire world are much bigger!
---
It's pretty much the same with dual spec.  Of course any player loves to have it, it makes you feel strong and is massively convenient.  But there's externalities.  For one, when everyone has dual specs, everyone can farm more.  More farming translates to larger market volumes.  More people will have money and materials, so they'll farm items faster.  It will push the progression through much more rapidly.  Moreover, it affects anyone who picked their spec to have an easier time farming.  Suddenly their choice is less effective, as profit margins will fall once everyone else has more access.  The identity argument you scoff at is also not a bad one.. some people like when individual characters have distinct identity.  You may not, but they do, and the change is bad for them.. another externality.
---
This is why MMO design is incredibly difficult though.  Most players are very myopic and only see the immediate benefits of certain design choices, and will keep demanding them until they get them.  They fail to see though that those same changes produce negative externalities.  Meanwhile, Evil McCorp's toxic chemicals gave someone else cancer, but they don't see the consequences.
---
MMOs are *not* single player games.  So if someone says "how another player plays shouldn't matter to you".. no, it absolutely does matter.  The core of the game is player interaction, the avenues that influence those interactions are the most important part of the game.  You can't set aside the externalities of a design choice just because people might find it convenient.
---
Because pretty much everyone who was in the Beta and played on private servers confirmed it?
---
Sodapoppin the streamer even said dungeon XP is so much better than what private servers thought the XP was that his plan is to just dungeon spam to 60 instead of having to deal with trolls and stream snipers.
---
Yeah what's that all about? This must be the first guide I see that doesn't adivse to level in Darkshore.
---
MOM! The internet is mad again...
---
Mine was brain hacker...so shit
---
lmao he edited it out of shame.
---
what a fuckin turd.
---
My girlfriend and I are going to be playing classic. I’ve played on and off for years raiding and everything. She’s never played any version of WoW or really any computer game. 
---
I’m thinking of rolling priest for end game healing which I love doing. She wants to roll rogue or hunter. Primarily due to being a ninja or having a pet... lol. 
---
Any thoughts on this? Also if I spec holy would we be okay leveling or should I roll shadow for the extra DPS considering she has no idea what she’s doing. I can heal dungeons as a shadow priest I’m assuming right? I’ll just switch to holy at 60.

---
[classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling) has a very detailed leveling guide that I practiced with a bit. You pretty much need a second screen to follow it though.

I got called a blizzard apologist on this sub for linking the wowhead article on layering last week. Seems that same article is still true. I’m still so confused on why I’m a blizzard apologist pepehands
---
Fewer.
---
Awe so you missed my point. Sometimes I forgot that the peasants don’t quite understand nuance and whatnot. My apologies friend.

Maybe if it could display approximate level somewhere other than the Ding spots in the quest steps... And saving progress as others mentioned.

Don't forget to send a thank you note to her boyfriend for taking her off your hands for a while.
---
The irony of this statement is hilarious.
---
Pretty sure if you have donated you’ll get access. Anything else would surprise me. I am thinking maybe people are just jumping to conclusions here about shadyness.
---
Both of those things are coming :)
---
&gt;"demanding money" for a product he's put in hundreds of hours of his  time and effort to create? lmao the entitlement of you people
---
i'd normally be right here with you, but this content has been freely available for like 15 years. lots of people have already donated to him for the guide, and they all got locked out too, without paying a monthly sub.
---
if you want to make new content and sell it, yeah that's great. but retroactively pulling 15 year old content because you think you can make a buck feels slimy. but you're right, it's his content, he can do what he wants.
---
Great.  They don't need a guide for that.
---
It's barely possible to raid as elemental DPS until pretty late in vanilla. Dragons and elementals have special resistance/immunity to nature damage, and they make up a lot of the bosses in the early phases. AQ also has some nature resistant stuff because it's the whole theme of that raid, although there it's mainly the trash. It's really not until Naxx that this stops being a thing.
---
    WARRIOR    
---
you know, as in PLATE WEARING CLASS?
---
Lots of people are just looking at a new chance to get all the 'firsts' for their server or for the game. I'm just gonna have fun with it and play with my friends.
---
In classic wands do not work like other ranged weapons, instead they have a cast bar, and beginning the cast resets your swing timer so this doesn't work.
---
You can do this with other ranged weapons though.
---
Health insurance can pay for a lot of costs, but it doesn't always cover everything, including money lost from being out of work.

smdh
---
Popular opinion.
---
Why would we spend $5 on something free elsewhere?
---
Nope he responded to my question about this very thing in stream last night.
---
Honestly, he deserves every penny. While it was free, it was a community service and Joana deserved every dolar donated through Twitch or Patreon. 
---
But since he asks for a monthly price now, this is a business now. And on a marketing standpoint, this is a really dickish move and in every other case would cause a massive outrage. A lot of the donations already made was based on the fact that this is a community service.
---
Imagine what you guys would feel like if Blizz suddenly came out and said: "Oh, we worked a lot on Classic and we deserve to be paid for our work, that's why apart from the server fee that you pay in form of a monthly subscription, Classic is now a separate 20$ purchase.". In the end, it would be well deserved to be paid for their work, but it wouldnt change the fact that it's a scummy move.
---
You should charge $5 a month for this advice.
---
(in all seriousness Joana makes amazing guides even if he is not the best at juicing his time, he deserves the money for the time and effort he puts into them.)
---
Teldrassil is amazing too though, fantastic atmosphere.
---
Yeah, I never said he shouldn't make money off it??? Just the timing and the selection were probably not the best choices, which were what got him such vehement responses.
---
Which healing class is most carpal tunnel friendly? I want to heal but my hands are severely fucked up and twitchy classes are painful
---
He was just contemplating whether anyone would play it. You are just acting like an ass.
---
It would be an interesting experience and I would give it a shot.
---
I'ma get you
---
Because people are boring. When I was younger I used guides as I didn't really understand and just wanted cool items and gear, but now I realize the best way to experience games really is to go in blind. For people that are using guide I'd suggest trying a game without them, it'll be so much more enjoyable. Discovering for yourself  and playing your own way rather than a "meta" is so much more fun.
---
Happen to have the alliance version?
---
Yeah, I feel that. I was 14 when vanilla first released, and played the hell out of it. Since then I've gotten married and had kids, but I can't NOT game. It's a balance now.
---
So you can have slow unreliable internet? Hotel?? No thanks
---
&gt; I really dont want my charactrer to be an alliance but at the same time i want to play with my friend how do you go about this?
---
Make an alt to play with your friend and make your main horde. Honestly its a shitty solution but based on the info you gave its the only answer.
---
My orc shaman is tired of war and is going to travel the land to unlock the mystery of the elements, helping the unfortunate, and fishing.

Pangaea

And that worrying question is why they are being so cautious about tossing out too many servers

Why not both?

Also free, and is as detailed/optimized, if not more.
---
Maybe $5 for the guide. But a subscription based option? Give me a break. He isn’t Netflix.
---
Actually when he first published the guide you had to pay for it back then too
---
I've already told myself I'm maining a warrior, because a lot of my friends that I'm bringing to the game have little to no MMO experience so I think it makes the most sense for me to tank out of all of us. I've played more Alliance in recent times (so not used to Horde routes) but a couple of our buddies are deadset on Horde, and the rest don't care. Would it just be better to choose Alliance or suck it up and do Horde?
---
&gt; So as a 31 year old now with more of a life and responsibility I do not want to spend time reading through quests to find cryptic or vague descriptions of where to go.
---
Thank you. Makes sense.
---
Would you be willing to send me the horde guides? I'd appreciate it!
---
:D
---
Nah. I’ll pay 5 bucks for joanas guide. He deserves it.
---
Cringe.
---
Marduk, Electric Wizard, Mayhem, Sleep, SunnO)), Peste Noire, etc. Any solid doom/black metal.
---
And Death!? Arguably the best metal band ever formed.
---
Damn, Thats a really refreshing view on shamans..i might just roll with it!  
---
After all, i might do more damage and be more efficient as a warrior with dual pockethealers, but ffs i played several classes 2000+ in arena, ran mythic 15+ on most chars with ease, Im back in classic to have fun, not to top meters or chain queue arena.. and Im quite confident shaman is FUN, they can even run multiple fun speccs..
---
I leveled Tauren druid for a while and then switched back to Alliance. Mulgore and Thunder Bluff are great, but Orgrimmar and Undercity were more popular and I hate both of them.
---
If you can deal with the refugees/band of misfits vibe then you can probably make it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that most towns felt like dirty or rotting camps compared to the cozy hearth of Ironforge.
---
Will being an alliance warlock on a PvP server be as big of a drag fighting horde as people say it is?
---
I would like support this guy, but don't like the monthly sub, and I hear this guide is not good for warrior.
---
Instead of berating the guy like communists, just leave the part out about Joana in your title. Man, you guys are such crybabies. You've sunk so low because someone decided to make profit on their work.
---
Its really easy to waste time while leveling if you don’t know what you’re doing.  I remember spending a whole night wiping in shadow fang keep before realizing that this was going to give me no permanent benefit.  A guide gives you the best quest completion and grinding paths because original leveling was not designed with efficiency in mind, as compared with the quest design philosophy since cata or maybe even wotlk.  So while not strictly necessary, guides are very useful to greatly reduce leveling time.
---

---
If you get those horde guides can you PM me? Continue the love train
---
It's subjective. Fast is optimal if your goal is to reach level 60. There's nothing wrong with wanting to reach "endgame" quickly
---
It's.... It's beautiful!
---
Yes.  Blizzard let them use a test server to record the in game portions.
---
He stated this in this episode of [Countdown To Classic Podcast](https://youtu.be/fkbMPXik9fo). I you have 80 minutes you may find exact timestamp, I'm too lazy to watch it for the second time though.
---
Damned Gerald. I’m not even going to edit it back because it’s hilarious. Meant Feral’s though. Cheers!
---
Hey ya’ll. So my friends are all getting classic. They’ve all played WoW before in some capacity, but I am a complete first timer.
---
I’ve already decided I want to play a mage as it rounds out our comp and it’s my favorite type of class, traditionally. What kind of noob tips do you have for mages, what are some good references for beginners, any other noob tips are also so appreciated. Thank you!! :D
---
There was a massive one previously that covered that. I guess you're wanting per-server break-down of class / profession / etc, but honestly, I'd be surprised if distribution per-server is significantly different than the 35,000+ response aggregate from the previous survey.
---
Great summary.
---
+1 this post. @blizzard_overloards
---
Lol I felt this. My friends with no kids are going nuts and I'm basically, "I'll buy a month and see what happens"
---
wait... they ask the server info and faction info but they don't put them together so we can see faction split per server? come on man
---
As a paladin I encourage rogues to try me.
---
Decay is static, and increases at higher rank. No one will  be able to outpace decay with just world pvp. This is how it was before bgs were introduced in classic wow. You dont really know what you are on about.
---
Except that's TBC. Classic is vanilla, patch 1.12 exactly. The name of the weapon was "The Nicker" in patch 1.12, so it should stay the same for Classic.
---
If they ever make TBC servers they can change it to "The Blackrock Slicer" or whatever the fuck it's called now.
---
It is hard to mantain the balance between them. I personally have way more fun when i have all the time in this beautyfull world to play and fool around. This is my perspective, i know people who have this extreme urge to spent every minute in this game as efficiently as possible and they complain when they wasted time. At this point i ask myself, arent you playing games for fun at the first place?
---
There’s this weird thing about the internet and gaming culture where almost everyone is a libertarian Ben Shapiro Stan until some libertarian capitalism gets applied to the gaming industry and everyone loses their minds.
---
If it's number 3, good bye WoW!
---
He already is getting a pretty decent sum of money from donations and Twitch subs, many of whom donated specifically because they wanted to support a free guide. If he didnt make money from those, it wouldn't be such a bad look to charge for the guide, just a questionable decision when he could've used something ads instead. (Even with donations, I wouldn't knock him for using ads)
---
its $5 a month too
---
I have a feeling every server is going to be full come launch
---
Today we are all Gerald
---
You told your wife to leave town.... and she listened???
---
I don’t really have an answer for you but I’m in the exact same boat. I’m going to try to play Alliance this time around after playing mainly Horde for 15 or however many years. 
---
I have some Alliance characters on retail but I never really got attached to them, but to be fair I’m not really attached to any of my Horde characters now either because all the classes feel pretty dumbed down. 
---
I think Alliance races are more aesthetically pleasing but Horde has more “badass” looking races and feels more like family. I’m guessing that I’ll get to 10-15 with the alliance character and delete him and revert back to Horde. We shall see though!
---
Can I ask what everyone means it doesn't "save my progress?"
---
The way I'm going to use it is have WoW on 1 monitor and this guide on another. Since I rarely shut my PC down... nothing changes? 
---
Am I missing something?
---
I hung around level 52 for about 6 months sitting in SW talking utter trash lol I feel ya
---
Logging out usually takes time standing still outside of a city, so if they're running, and just disappear you know they layered.
---
She won’t be laughing 2 weeks from now
---
Right?  Layering totally changes the game and people want to whine about minor minor minor things that have literally no effect on gameplay.
---
Also westfall instead of darkshore? xD
---
[willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) has all the working addons
---
I think I'm 100% locking in paladin. That was my first ever max character in wotlk, and I wanna honor it by doing it the OG way. Plus I miss the simple healing and DPS, I'm too old for all these mechanics lmao. HOWEVER...human or paladin? 
---
Perception - very good in PvP, but I'm not concerned about wPvP cause I'm playing on a normie server. Granted I do plan on BGs but that's where Stoneform would kick in. I dont plan on doing ret in any shape or form once I hit 60, so I'm not worried about those weapon skill boosts humans have. Also my og pally was dwarf. ALSO humans cant ride mechanostriders in classic, which I very much plan on grinding out gnome rep for. 
---
So I'm pretty set on dwarf, but is there any arguments for human that I'm missing?
---
I dressed mine up as the guards from Org. I would stand right beside them and /flex
---
Druid would probably be the worst with shape shifting, paladin probably the easiest since it's 2 heals and some long CDs. Priest and shaman probably tied in the middle.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Druid is fun but I'm not sure how viable the tank/heal spec is when it comes to tanking. I know there's a great feral/resto spec for flag carrying that lets you heal -15% efficiency in raids (compared to full resto), so that sounds nice. :D
---
&gt; It's subjective.
---
Ok then. Youre spending an awful lot of time trying to convince me of your subjective view. Thanks.
---
Did someone mention Thubderfury blessed blade of the wind seeker?
---
It's the typical entitled gamer outrage culture.  Can't be angry about how "broken" layering is after that AMA, so the neckbeards need a new hill to die on.  If it wasn't skeletons, it'd be something else that has zero impact on gameplay.
---
Weird seeing a GIS reference in the wild like this. ArcGIS is my daily driver!
---
I will interpret that as complete agreement, hero. Lok'tar.
---
Which is exactly what I said. OP was suggesting the skeleton disappeared when you rezzed which is simply not possible.
---
Doesn't that somewhat highlight the fact people are willing to pay for it so monetisation is sensible? I 100% agree anyone who has already donated on twitch or patreon should get access though.
---
Does the alliance guide work for every race/starting area?
---
I image anyone who's been jumping from private server to private server won't even think about getting this, but all the players who are coming in to this not having played since OG vanilla I can see why the idea of leveling without a guide is somewhat intimidating.
---
what constitutes "twitchy?" Lots of moving the mouse around?
---
If the movement of the mouse is what gives you pain, healing is almost certainly the very worst role for you. Most of what you'll be doing is waving your mouse around choosing to heal while in a raid, or in a small group, you'll still be using the mouse to select one of the five to heal. 
---
That said though.. otherwise all the healing classes will have more or less the same required hand movements. You're always going to have to choose someone to heal, and you'll always have 2-3 healing spells to choose from. I suppose you could be a shaman and just spam chain heal on the tank though..
---
You can also probably set up macros to heal specific party slots with keybindings so your hands could be basically completely still I suppose. 
---
And to clarify, healing will really just require movingy our mouse around like, less than 5cm depending on your mouse settings.
---
Mom won't give her credit card for 5 euros, she said she's already paying the monthly subscription, so spoiled brats are being vocal. Gotta buy those fortnite skins tho

---

---
As a hemo rogue you can roll with a mace, I remember pvp videos of rogues who did that. Although, its not the best pve spec until very late in the game with good gear as far as I remember.
---
I agree with you.
---
T.5 won't be out for a very long time. The quest to update t0 came out after aq so you will need to wait till either phase 5 or 6. You can start collecting the t0 from launch though.
---
Haha it's just for comfort so probably not an issue. But I like to hide those action bars so I don't clutter my screen
---
I honestly think that warlocks are just more fun to write or talk about, so if you're getting your information from those sources I'm not surprised they lean warlock. There's way more meta to think about, the talents are more complex and thought provoking. but when you get down to playing, mages are just fantastic to play 1-60, pve or pvp, group or solo.
---
Working on a couple of short stories to establish how the human warrior arrived at Northshire Abbey. Basic gist is he is a younger sibling from a successful farm/brewing (hop farm) area up in Hillsbrad. Not really having a place in the family business other than a work hand, he decides to go off on adventures. A merchant they work with to sell the ales takes him on as one of the merchant guards. The merchant train is ambushed in Westfall. He manages to escape, but is penniless and has little in the way of possessions aside from the old, crappy sword he had been given as a guard. He hears the Abbey needs some help, and they might have some food and a few coins, so decides to head up that way.
---
Somewhere in there (on the way to the Abbey? After?) he'll enter Stormwind for the first time. He'll be in awe, not just of the city, but of the knights, and that will become his goal.
---
He already has Patreons and twitch subscribers. He also bragged in twitch that his guide made him $1.2 million in vanilla.

Didn't this have a back side to it? Have you got that one too? Love you btw

I wish you had done multiple options instead of 1 only. That way people who are considering 2 servers for 2 characters or because they haven't decided would be counted.
---
Also, why so many fewer questions?
---
my roflcopter goes soisoisoisiosoi tchetchetchetche
---
Portals are under rated, there's no dungeon finder I'm classic and no flying mounts.
---
They could do it. But they’re purposely doing this. Or else you’re going to end up with a server of 50,000 people at the end of phase 1 and they will have to transfer people off or keep layering. Because there simply aren’t enough resources (mining nodes etc) to support 50,000 people on a server without layering. 
---
They’re giving an incentive for people to go to smaller servers: no queues.
---
Some people appreciate the game for more than just min-maxing ;)
---
I never said they didn’t. The point of the post is OP saying the AQ event warrants more discussion and explanation than it received. 
---
My point is that it’s better they spend more time discussing layering, launch plans, phase one, etc. than something we are months and months away from.
---
Normal/pve servers
---
Roll shaman, it's more fun and they're plenty in demand.

Oh yeah, I wasn't disagreeing. Just elaborating on how it works for OP.

Can you specify the meanings of Casual, Semi-Hardcore and Hardcore?

No it fucking doesn't.  The corpse turns into a skeleton when you res, and the first skeleton disappears when you make a second one.

I'm sure you have looked into this already, but i think troll SP is very underrated. you have a 20% heal reduction that can only be dispelled  by mages and druids, and shadowguard has a 100% spell power coefficient (split between the 3 orbs) and can cause blackout procs. you lose the 3min nuke option of Devouring Plague, and the utility of Will of the Forsaken. So its more of a CD based play style with Undead vs a more consistent output with Troll
---
What class pairs well with hunter for leveling/general-playing-together? Convinced my girlfriend to play and I'm playing hunter.
---
Do frost mages still have a place in raids post-BWL? Is the winters chill rebuff still needed? I just find the spec way... cooler... than fire
---
If you ever find yourself bragging or advertising the fact that someone has blocked you on Twitter, 99% of the time you are annoying and it was completely deserved.
---
Not really, people really over exaggerate this constantly. It's not like you're fighting UD rogues only.
---
To get the true classic experience, you shouldn't ask about the game, just play the game. Should if you encounter an issue, or something in game that puzzles you in any way, ask in the barren chat (or the alliance version).
---
Asking before hand on reddit is kinda like cheating.
---
He’s not misinformed at all. The endgame you are talking about that is “hard” is a misunderstanding. Mythic in retail is much harder than any boss encounters in retail. You are confusing “hard” with tedious gameplay mechanics
---
what? There was no transmog at all in classic.
---
Ok this answer is a load of bullshit. Classic was guided by a campaign of #NoChanges, but suddenly if WotLK or TBC happen it's all #YesChanges? No, it's a recreation of the same experience, good and bad. And another factor with this post
---
&gt;it is likely that some features of these expansions will not be universally embraced by the Classic community.
---
Why the hell would the Classic community matter? Classic community got CLKASSIC servers, WotLK or TBC would be for those communities.
---
The point is that they aren't consistent with how the were in vanilla. It'd be like placing the gurubashi arena in an instance or something.
---
I am rolling Tauren to avoid Durotar...
---
Just kidding! Tauren always have been my favorite race
---
If you turn everything up in the advanced options you'll see an improvement.
---
The only possible model changes right now are for Undead, you can put, SET overrideArchive "1" into your WTF config file and it removes the bones.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  dead
---
Yup, everyone get in here and explain how YOUR serer was the only right ones and everyone else who said it differently was wrong. Personally my server called it VC, but I don't care either way, people will know what you mean when you are looking for a group in westfall.
---
Not particularly. Once you have death coil/seduce, keeping them away from you gets much easier. Until then? Magic dust from westfall, and save it for undead only.
---
Chronic health issues from pulling all nighters while ordering pizza and drinking energy drinks to break leveling records?
---
Tons of Finns too.
---
The amount of people defending Madcow/Joana in this thread is baffling. It was a scumbag move on his end to take down the original guide and lock it down behind a paywall. For several reasons too:
---
1. He released the guide for free in its entirety a while ago. Hate to say it but that knowledge is now effectively public domain.
---
2. There are plenty of free levelling guides available. Some are easier and more convenient to use than Joana's because they have addon support. It's 2019 for fuck's sake!
---
3. Selling knowledge of how to optimise a video game playthrough generally sets a dangerous precedent, especially across what is a very collaborative and cooperative speedrunning community. In every other video game that is speedrun, runners, TASers and dataminers generally work together to optimally work out the best strategy. 
---
4. Paywalling the guide is pointless if Joana plans to stream his world record runs on Twitch, Mixer or YouTube at all. Anybody who streams is effectively leaking out their strats for free, albeit not in a written format.
---
5. Because Joana released the old guide for free in its entirety a while back, it's incredibly easy to bypass the paywall just by using the Wayback Machine or Google's web cache. You won't get any improvements from the new guide, but I'd be really surprised if a guide that Joana worked on for years between five expansions and many iterations can really be improved much.
---
No I'm simply saying he would make more money asking for more rather than demanding it. I'm not saying things should be free, I'm just saying that it would be more profitable and better for everyone if it was free.
---
Considering she knows no one in town, doesn't have a cellphone or any social media, two kids all the time and my mother lives in the basement apartment I highly doubt she's cheating on me lol
---
There was a survey floating around on the first days after reservations. Like 40k respondents.
---
I can’t recall each server, but in the aggregate, horde and alliance populations were very close, with a slight horde advantage. 
---
Pvp servers had 43-57 or tighter split (most were 45+ alliance, at least).
---
Check your server discord, ours has a ticker of all those who’ve connected whether they are horde or allianxe
---
I agree that you should play the game the way you want. For me, that means hitting 60 fast, getting the best gear (min/maxing), and hardcore raiding.
---
For others, it means taking their time; enjoying certain parts of the content.
---
I think each person should do what seems fun to him/her. It's a game so it should be fun.
---
Stalagg may be more crowded than Herod no :/
---
the community as a whole will not be min-maxing, a fraction of the player base will. a higher % than vanilla but still clear minority.  
---
then again... everyone min-maxes. so do you.  
---
you get an upgrade, you put it on, right?  
---
do you leave your dal rends in your bag to use the argent crusader because it looks cooler. nope, you use the dal rends because its better.  
---
some games i go for max efficiency, some i dont. for me, wow is a go max game. One the great things about the game is it offers fun no matter how you play.
---
Thank you! Happy Grinding
---
Look at it this way. Warlocks are more appreciated on the alliance and you will be more unique and needed :D
---
There's at least 4 full 1-60 guides for alliance via Guidelime addon on curseforge. Don't bother with Joana's.
---
Warrior leveling is tough especially if you dont know what you're doing. But it can be worth it in the end and the grind can be a lot more satisfying to complete. Level 60 is a ton of fun but so are dungeons leveling up. Solo content can be tough if you're unprepared. Would you be upset if you got to 60 on a hunter knowing you could have a level 52 warrior?
---
Warlocks are a shit ton of fun. One of the best classes in the game, secret OP, tons of utility and side abilities, summons are cool, dreadsteed is unique, exclusive, and badass. Horde Warlocks are better than Alliance Warlocks. But bag space is always an issue and you will have to gather soul shards n shit.
---
Priest is really only gonna be something to do if you're happy about healing. If you do want to heal then priest is the way to go hands down.
---
Mages are great, very few downsides, all upside, one of the best classes if not the easiest and fastest leveling class for most players. You dont have to even be that good to get some decent damage out of a mage. Only real downside is everyone on their mother will play a mage.
---
\--- which usually results being a douche to your group mates.   It's ultimately selfish in the worst way.
---
Agreed. I simply misremembered what bag has what capacity and got hopeful :)
---
Me using updated models doesn't affeect you using old models.
---
Each player chooses if they want to stockpile or effort items and then turn them in all at once. That effects their experience and they are in charge of that. But because it is also a server event, their experience somewhat impacts your ability to have an experience. So you should be getting mad at every other player who turns in items at the start in bulk.
---
Doesn't look like it. Not sure how much different the duo option of [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) is from the solo guides though. If you don't ever mess with [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) tab on your browser you might not have any issues with the guide resetting, but I checked recently and there is still no way to save your progress as far as I know.
---
My main is going to duo absolute poopsocknolife to 60. We have 2 weeks planned out. Probably going to hit 60 around early week 2.    
---
We planned food and sleep schedules to achieve this.   
---
     
---
After those 2 weeks alts are going to level way more casually and I don't expect any of them to get very far.
---
It’s crazy, a guy makes a product of high demand and wants money for it? Wack
---
The fights are tuned for 40 players undergeared... 
---
When you get all pimped up with high level gear, you can do it with less.
---
I miss this faction pride and hatred.
---
Yep grinded that one out once. So many piratessss.
---
stay lagged lol
---
Raiding is on weekly resets and unless if you commit x hours per week into it you aren't going to see last boss. Obviously in this case raiding is super fucking easy because it's 14 years ago, but it's the exact same thing.
---
Awesome! We would love to have you! Going to be a fun event.
---
Warrior's great if you put in the time for them. Just be aware it's a commitment.
---
There isn't really an overarching story in classic. There's no big bad. You're just put into this world as an adventurer. Each zone has a story going on that you discover through quests, but you're not really building up to this big fight or anything.
---
And yes, your character is not an epic hero or anything, you're just a guy/girl that decided to go adventuring and move from zone to zone doing what you can and exploring.
---
No, it's a world drop.
---
&gt;So the conveniences didn't even fix the issues they were supposed to fix.. sounds like a bad idea to reimplement them then if they're failed design choices that don't work.
---
That's a shallow way to think about it, people being what they are will always lean towards DMG dealing roles over supportive ones - the tank/healer discrepancy will never be fixed because of that.  *However* that doesn't mean that by making it easier for them to switch (and even enticing people with bonus rewards) that it doesn't help *reduce* the problem.
---
Sweden &amp;&amp; Finland != Scandinavia, so please, let's be clear with spreading information.
---
The slowest escort quest in the game. I can't wait!
---
Not necessarily any more or less complicated than any other class, if anything warlocks have more room for error/being under geared because their matchups 1v1 favours them
---
Wow they’re afraid of hurty words awwww :(
---
I thought joana was a woman ?
---
I'd magnet that to my fridge.
---
nah - you take it as a lesson learned and you dont go to a random nobody adverting a hidden chest. and youa lso remember his name.
---
Pick pocketed so many opals back in the day, I would clear dungeons with humanoids max subtlety and pick pocket every thing. Had my epic mount super fast.
---
Yeah or like only having MC and ONY availible, no dire maul but having everything on the 1.12 client
---
oh wait
---
Would like to see the results per server, like what language and faction.
---
As someone that still frequently uses twitter (I have dialed it back in the last few months). I would say it's more like 60/40. Some people absolutely can't be criticized in any shape or form, even if the sleight is imaginary or simply a difference of opinion.
---
If you wanna PVP and heal at the same time, go Priest.
---
If you're cool with respeccing to swap to PVP and PVE so you can dps during PVP go shaman.
---
Can you guys hear the music only by looking at it:)?
---
&gt;Why does he even have it monthly?
---
Because it's a well known money grab. Just like gym memberships. They make their money by 90% of people using it a few times then forgetting about it and letting the recurring payment roll thru months or years.

It was meant to convince those who were already convinced?
---
Doesn't matter what he says, it's not binding, he can always change his model.  
---
Entitled snowflakes want free shit, Joana out a lot of work into his guide, if you dont want to lay, go somewhere else and use a free guide.
---
Go read the EJ forums then tell me people weren't minmaxing vanilla. Just because you were 12 when vanilla was live doesn't mean there wasn't the same kind of hardcore community that exists on live today, or the same kind of community that pre-dated WoW. Gamers love to think about and talk about min-maxing things, it adds a whole game-within-a-game aspect to video gaming.
---
it's wrath\*kiddies\*
---
the babies are from cata!
---
I agree, I'm sure they closed that gap in cata.
---
We will see. Hopefully it’s not too bad *crosses fingers*
---
Not bad though.  At least you got to change it up a bit!
---
If you're just wanting to heal, both will work fine. If you also want to pvp, shaman is satisfyingly bursty, but is hard to gear because it's a one pump chump for pve content. Priests can pvp in healing gear as a support class.
---
You know this game is on the right track if that's the thing we are complaining about.
---
Someone using a guide doesn't impact how YOU'RE playing in any way. So why do you care?
---
Im pushing near 30 now and i dont want to spend time reading quests and wasting time leveling, because what i really care about is running end game dungeons and raiding. So i will be using a guide to cut down the time as much as i can. You don't have to if you don't want to, whether i do or not doesn't affect your experience.
---
I played horde as an UD shadow priest in vanilla but I want to be able to raid. I'm a big paladin fan so my choice is made for me already.
---
Hmm, you make a compelling argument.
---
Imagine being named after a snakey boy and not a big dick dragon
---
this post was made by the Firemaw gang
---
rez timer maxes at 2 mins
---
This but I do Q/W/E for movement, A and D are bound to things like dispel and whatnot frees up lots of binds around Q/W/E without limiting movement :)
---
Warrior is the only class that needs 2 viable specs to be viable. A warrior will end up tanking some fights and dpsing others. It's not like one fight requires 2 healers and the next 12.
---
To continue this argument shammys in world pvp are pretty nutty
---
realm\*
---
Not sure why they would still have queus this late in their game..but like people are playing the current game just convert some servers
---
I like updated graphics, but it's Classic. Not really any point to updating the graphics.
---
However, purely because they couldn't get all the old graphics, some of the graphics are slightly updated from original.
---
But to the best of their ability, it's original Classic. There's really no point in using updated stuff. Eventually they might re-release TBC. Then that's a whole new thing.
---
Its been full for weeks
---
Skirts the same line. Give me a break...
---
I’d recommend Druid. The slow efficient heals and multiple heal over time effects let you squeeze in some leeway. Priest would also be a solid pick with their shield and other utility. I’d avoid Paladin if you don’t want to be so spammy.
---
Play on a pve server if you think getting "owned" by other players is bullying. Something like getting corpse camped or being tricked into having your character killed is not bullying, it's part of the game. 
---
In this example, the ghost getting stuck was an unintended side effect. And if the cross-faction coordination is against the ToS, report it, but it's not automatically bullying just because it breaks a rule.
---
It's a million miles away from beating the shit out of a total stranger.
---
Btw the thing about asserting dominance was clearly not meant to be taken seriously, it was just a throwaway comment and I don't understand why you're going down this route.
---
Yeah, this guy is something else XD scroll up a bit he has a strong opinion on removing the flying mount :P
---
But he's making some fair points, at the same time it's a touchy subject.
---
Shaman probably has the easier leveling experience.
---
Shamans will heal raids and dps PVP.
---
Priests will virtually always end up healing just about everywhere.
---
I know but he released it for free years later. As far as I'm concerned, that knowledge has effectively become public domain.
---
This is nice, but what does it have to do with a paper guide?
---
Prior to name claiming, the PVE I was headed towards was low pop and tilted towards Ally. Its now High pop, and IDK who the heck climbed aboard. Would also love to see updated info.
---
Don't mess with the perfection that is the original cinematic.
---
Warrior=Leader role! (Both in pve and pvp) So yeah that's your best bet.
---
I can't tell you to go Alliance or Horde because I'm still doubting about that too. If you go Alliance PvE be sure to pick Hooman. If you got PvP gnome is pretty good. If you go Horde PvE, Orcs and Trolls are nice. If you go PvP definitely go Orc.
---
IT was more my body motions walking, even at the slowest speed on my treadmill, that caused the instability in my mouse hand.  I am sure I could have worked on it over time, but I was too impatient.  
---
Good luck in Classic!
---
Every time a new iPhone model comes out, and Apple says "This new one is better" do you think that's an example of shitting on your own work?
---
*r/classicwow*, "wow I can't believe this extremely comprehensive step by step guide on how to level my character as fast as possible has been taken from me days before launch!"
---
*Also r/classicwow*, "retail WoW's quest steps on the map helped kill questing and WoW"
---
All jokes aside I was planning on using something like this from lvl 1-20ish because I have leveled so many characters to that point over the years. But I very much want to be a noob again after that. Part of my my desired experience with classic is that I want to be a noob again. I missed that so much. Which is why I'm playing a class I've never really played past lvl 15 on a faction I only leveled post BC.
---
I could give 3 fucks less in won't be using guides
---
I didn't get to play vanilla (too young/rural, started late in BC) but I'm planning to go mage and it hadn't occurred to me to do this.  So thanks for the idea.
---
I don't take how his "feels" into consideration, only that it would be better for the community and for his own profits to make it free. 
---
Personally I would feel better about people GIVING me money without having to because they really enjoy my product, than have people buy it. That's some real satisfaction, but who knows maybe he thinks differently, I cannot comment on his feelings so I choose to comment on the economics side of it.
---
Looks great!
---
 https://lmgtfy.com/?q=Wow+classic+leveling+guide
---
I'm thinking about playing shadow priest but I have a few concerns regarding raiding and I was young when I played classic so have no idea, I'm not a filthy casual but definitely won't be in a top guild as I mainly want to PVP.
---
Will I only be allowed to come as a DPS Priest if I just do the rotation that buffs warlocks damage? Original classic only had 8 debuff slots compared to 16, so will this make my chance of getting a spot and actually being able to do my rotation much more possible?
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
Then I guess you have to be very lucky to be able to make some gold from it.
---
Based on the way the guy looked on ClassicCast he doesn’t have any expensive tastes. Tbh he looks like he lives pretty marginally.
---
Nobody wants to be the first to make the jump. We all want to wait until the last minute to see what everyone else did, but of course everyone else is doing the same. We don't want to divide the population in 2. This is really Blizzard's fault for giving us so few servers that we had to pick just one as the unofficial streamer-free server. They didn't listen to the community and now they're trying to fix it by introducing a new server.
---
It’s a coherent consistent world. There is no big narrative and you’re basically an anonymous adventurer who might take part in heroic deeds. You’ll see some familiar faces from Warcraft 3. Once you have proven your worth you might get more interesting tasks than collecting bear asses, but it’s a big world, and every zone has somebody looking for 10 bear butts.
---
I agree with you completely, I DO find PvP fun, and the rush of it, and it makes me want to play a rogue and fuck people up.  BUT, like I said, I'm not the same 15 year old kid with 12 hours a day to play anymore.   If I log on and get killed once by someone 40 levels higher than me, that's my whole day.  
---
The thought of dreaming about WoW at work all day, getting home and getting one shot by a griefer for an hour makes me cringe.
---
True, im getting 50-60 fps in BFA on setting 3 in starter zones on my 2018 laptop with ryzen 2500u / vega 8 apu. Classic might be a little less intense, but big raids are going to be a problem probably escpecially outdoors.
---
Oh wow, that's actually a pretty cool story! If Madoran is ever taken by somebody else you can always give Madladoran a try. :)
---
It looks like one of those "We need you to come in and speak with the counselor about your child"  drawings.
---
Maybe I'm just in denial
---
Swords even without the Human racial, try to get yourself a Maladath from BWL and you'll be golden.
---
I couldn't say for sure, I haven't heard anyone mention a "Finnish classic wow discord" but there might be one out there. Gehennas has a decent amount of finns but I don't know how it compares to Shazzrah.
---
I can't remember correctly, but wasn't there the option to talk to the high elf and get ported in?
---
yeah thats true , dont worry tho if the population drop in any server dramatically they open up free server moves like vanilla . its not the best but at least there would be an option
---
Where pally tanks falter in the inability to store water, they make up for with an armor set that makes them look like a banana
---
I had a meme that I actually spent time on in Photoshop get removed for being low effort, but the "get motivated" thing with the number of days scratched out by finger with a phone app and a 7 inserted stays.
---
Fuck rule 7.
---
If I recall correctly, there are many bosses that can spawn in the ring of law, and only one of them has the potential to drop this item. Could be longer than you think.
---
That may be because people give a fuck.
---
Don’t get too excited. It also turns every instance of bones, skulls, and skeletons into loaves of bread
---
BWL and AQ40, after that fire is really the only optimal way to go.
---
MC and BWL are full of fire. Obviously ice defeats them.
---
Naxxramas is a citadel of an ice lich who was a famous frost mage in life who now serves the frozen ass Lich King. Obviously fire defeats them.
---
A frost mage will never be in Naxx. You might as well bring any other dps of any kind. Heck you could argue that a Ret Pally meme spec would be better off than a frost mage in Naxx.
---
Talent trees are nice but you should be ready to use all three to varying degrees no matter what class you are. You'll likely run into situations where switching will become necessary.
---
I just plan on no lifeing it for a week try and get to 60 or as high as possible then get back to it casually cause I know that’s why I’ll have to do.
---
When I leveled as ally on pservers, I tended to gank Tauren the least, and Undead the most. Tauren is best race, after Human
---
Thanks alot mate!
---
25k is an insanely small sample size when you consider that it’s accounting for 16 servers. When *one* of those servers is expected to have 15-20k on it alone. Why is this so hard to comprehend?
---
If i were making a dungeon, and we had no other class that could ress, i would not take a druid healer. Not because of any minmax thing, but because it just takes bloody forever to run back every time just one person dies.
---
If we have anyone in party who can ress, i would consider a druid. However who would that be - Paladins, Shamans, Priests, druids. Im horde, so can't have paladins. Shamans dont DPS in PVE. Shadow priests dont do dungeons that often. And druids have same problem as your druid healer :p
---
Which means that unless you're alliance, you might have trouble finding a dungeon spot as a healer druid. Not because of elitism, but just because it would suck for the group not to have a ress. 
---
Note that this of course does not apply to friend/guild groups etc.
---
You read the comment.
---
&gt; Is this the reason everyone wanted to play Classic? To be as efficient as possible? :( 
---
For some, sure. Everyone has something that attracts them most. I just want to relive the whole shabang. Being efficient is nothing but helpful though, in the longrun. A piece of many pieces of the puzzle.
---
&gt; I am actually starting to wonder if it's going to be anything like the Vanilla of old because back then the min-maxing 
---
It'll mostly be Vanilla. Just a little more connected to one another, all knowledge of the game upfront, and data-mined this time around ha. There will be hundreds or thousands of guilds per server. You can find one that is interested in what you're interested in. You will still run into a lot of the same old players though; both good and shit.
---
&gt; How are you going to be playing Classic in 6 days from now? Will you be going for maximum efficiency or are you looking to just enjoy the ride? 
---
Ride to 60, then both.
---
It should be an option
---
Says the guy that gives real life advice to people not asking for it. Do you have any self-reflection whatsoever?
---
Also funny that you attack my writing. A sure sign somebody is desperate af in a convo. Here have some more spelling mistakes: fikc uyrsevl oyu dgenerate mogno. Now you loser can jack of to it while screaming **IAM SO VERY SMART**.
---
This convo is over btw.
---
People put a ton of work into mods for skyrim and only ask for donations....
---
I say this as someone with no interest in joanas guide, though. Merely a curious onlooker to this drama
---
Some folks will  trample anything to be #1. You just have to shake your head and just watch them do what they're gonna do. They'll never understand the joy of the slower path, so just feel bad for them for not understanding.
---
Some serious health conditions aren't always physical or visible to outsiders.
---
Read the pinned comment.
---
Removed for being low effort
---
Did you draw the Chapeau? Nice line work.
---
one thing you can do to (sometimes) help that issue is by going engineering and having a set of jumper cables
---
Sure hit me up !
---
Doesnt vanilla have a thing were you can only be horde or  alliance on a server?
---
Damn. If that's the &lt;vodka&gt; I'm thinking of, that guild was crazy good.
---
I know it is early but has Faerlina had a massive drop in population?
---
Inefficient pathing and bugs mostly.
---
1. Have a proper name.
---
2. Don't disturb roleplay events.
---
3. Don't speak out of character in say or yell.
---
Why not do it differently this time?
---
No he has a genetic heart defect.
---
He's literally spent thousands of hours working on and refining this guide, and that's supposedly not even worth $5?
---
lol I remember you whitecrow.  This is an old ass video from BH.  I remember a lot of people were salty as hell about this vid.
---
In a word, yes
---
Dude. That's awesome.
---
I did not plan to use his guides one way or the other but plenty of people from what I have personally seen and from what I have read have subscribed to his twitch and donated him money under the pretense of being able to access his guides. Again I don't have a leg in this fight one way or the other but seems pretty shady and would caution anyone doing business with the individual.

I think a lot of us are just looking to revisit that initial rush.  I expect we'll see major drop-off in the first few months as we fail to meet our outdated play expectations now that the majority of us are adults compared to 'back in the day', or it's just not the game we remember.  (hind sight is 20/20)  
---
There's others that want to play with their kids, and introduce them to this great thing we had 'way back then' but likely won't hold the current generations interest.
---
All that said, even if we see dramatic fall off in population, classic is a damn good thing for a lot of reasons.  It won't fail, indeed it's probably brought back enough in subscriptions to pay for itself for a LONG time already.  For some people, it'll be the itch that needs scratching and stick around, for others, it won't.
---
Could not have characters from both factions on pvp realms. Imposter!
---
There are usually less warlocks in Alliance due to filthy undeads :D
---
Observant.
---
I wasn't addressing his sarcasm, but rather the point he was trying to make with it.
---
Putting "immersion" in quotes is not something he can judge, and it should be obvious by the fact that we even have this discussion that for some people small details like that add to their immersion.
---
Is it the worst thing ever that they decided against it?
---
No, of course not.
---
Should you be able to voice your opinion for it to be changed?
---
Absolutely.
---
Sarcasm in itself is fine, but the argument he was trying to make with is was stupid in my eyes.
---
For real though. I remember being on my nelf druid and pretty much living in stealth thanks to that one orc warrior who didn't know the meaning of "mercy".
---
So, I wised up and rolled Horde. Then I got mercilessly ganked by a nelf hunter with a tiger pet.
---
The world is a cruel, unforgiving place.
---
At least we're the best at running away!
---
Druid is love.
---
you shouldn't be touching 11-12 year olds.
---
i don't
---
That post had been edited, I don't think it was there originally, but thanks.
---
I completely agree with this. I'm playing rogue and really tried to force myself to like orc... But I just couldn't do it. Tried both male and female on a private server and just hated the look. As good as hardiness is I know I couldn't stare at that model for the amount of hours you have to put in. UD rogue ftw!
---
I see you too have chosen the way of the skirted beard!
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I would say give everyone a "room" at the goldshire inn but sheesh you could accidentaly load into some really weird rooms. Thats gotta be crazy on the backend to support though.
---
Not at first. They added him later due to glitches with the window. The window didn’t always work and sometimes people fell to their deaths in the lava.
---
I played a Mage in vanilla, but a Shaman from BC forward. I think I'm going to play a Shaman again this time around, but I have a few questions. I've seen some guides say that enhance is the best leveling spec bar none, and will likely follow this (I also played enhance through most of my time in WoW). Can you heal dungeons (pre-60) in enhance spec without putting points into resto? I want to be able to heal dungeons while leveling... Especially to get ready for raiding.
---
Second question, how is leveling as ele? I'd kind of want to try ele, but definitely don't if it's too much worse than enhance. Plus, I don't want to have to carry 2 sets of gear throughout the entire leveling process (and assume that I could just use 1 set for ele leveling and dungeon healing).
---
Honestly for leveling? Any class is fine
---
Basically any class but a warrior.
---
Ah yes i just looked on wayback machine and 1-60 is findable through there if you go june 10th 2019
---
Im not berating Joana here, im just replying to the guy saying isnt 5 bucks worth it. Im sure its worth it, but why not just get the same thing for free.
---
Just buy someones old rig from back in 2004, you should be able to do a 5 minute mile by the time you run from IF AH to the mailbox.
---
Not really no. Onyxia is typically done with 20man, although it can technically be done with down to 5. Some really dedicated guilds do 30man MC to concentrate gear more, you can clear it with less, and BWL with about 30. Althought AQ and especially naxx is pretty damn tough, I wouldn't want to try it with anything less than 35 and even that is gonna be damn difficult.
---
I remember getting lost for almost an entire day PvPing in Tarren Mill (or Hill?) with 100s of people involved in a constant tussle, my first and most memorable WoW experience.  But I had joined a somewhat hardcore raiding guild (through a RL friend who was more of a veteran) that had minimum level requirements for each day we had to reach or be kicked.  That day in Tarren Mill forced me to knuckle down and grind, not sure where I ended up going but I skipped the entire STV experience never once setting foot inside it after the tales I'd heard.  In the following days I managed to leapfrog a number of people in the guild whilst savouring their non-stop complaints about STV.
---
If they are on a PVE server and PvP flagged while in STV the deserve it.
---
If they are on a PVP server then they certainly wont make lvl1 alts to ragewhisper, since they cant make toons from the opposing faction...
---
You did though. Talking about how you're "saddened" by people playing the game differently than you is the same thing as telling them they're wrong.
---
&gt;Doesn't matter what he says, it's not binding, he can always change his model.
---
And people can always give him shit, after supporting him on patreon and twitch
---
Norman Reedus and his funky fetus.
---
True.
---
I personally think the "out of the blue" part is what upsets most people, including myself.  If he had said he was going to do this well in advance, people would be more understanding.
---
(Also, there would likely be more copies in the wild, but there are obviously plenty of copies on the interwebs anyway.)
---
Thanks
---
These are things people forget about the vanilla playerbase.
---
There were *a lot* of ganking rogues with spitting issues.
---
No one is really going to know how truly balanced the servers are until some time post-launch. The census surveys people have done are a decent indicator of where the server is heading, but not everyone who plans to play Classic participated or even knew about the survey.
---
Am I imagining it or something? I thought they said even from a few months ago there is going to be "Classic" button that you can have your graphics set to how it was from launch or you can max it and it look a look like more current graphics (not completely like retail but nicer)
---
The raw Data excel doesn’t have headers for the new realms
---
How do you save your progress?
---
Lol no kidding. I thought this was pretty clear.
---
They just brought in as many big streamers as possible. So the general population is going to care more about what's going on at Method over the actual race.
---
&gt; That would be like starting a diet losing twenty pounds and then stopping and gaining all the weight back
---
And people never do that, right?
---
Classic is not about separating communities.
---
I have tried leveling multiple characters. 
---
It feels dehumanising. Really. Wows leveling does not make me feel valued as a human being. 
---
I never imagined I would say that about a game before, especially one that I pay for. But there you go.
---
Why are people obsessing over this particular guide so much when there are so many of them out there? Is this one just particularly good or something?
---
It is worth 5 bucks, but I can see why someone would just go with one of the many free guides instead and support them by viewing their ads.
---
That doesn’t make any sense
---
That link has Scandinavians in the roster...lol. Calm down.
---
Bad tank for sure. Only takes one botched pull to wipe a group.
---
You're dumb as fuck. It's not a scumbag move you entitled baby. He has never said that his guides will be free forever. Joana was always upfront about the fact that his members area will have access to the full guides when classic is released. He's put thousands of hours of work into these guides and he can charge for them if he wants to, as he has done in the past.
---
Yes, yes they can.
---
Mage lfg BRD full run
---
Thank you for sacrificing your Queue spot to someone who appreciates it.
---
Bad tank is far worse.
---
It is only for horde, right?
---
They have to lock their experience for it tho or the quest rewards will give them too much.
---
However, you can start the quest at 28 and hope that you're ahead of curve of people doing it or don't play on PvP servers.
---
At 28-32 you'll probably need help tho, Bangalesh can be soloed with low level twink with enough kiting, but while leveling you're probably going to be undergeared.
---
You can always dream of getting it so early, but reality tends to be more cruel than that.
---
I thought this sub was going to delete posts of arts and crafts. 
---
Not mad this post is awesome.. but weren't we pushing to not be an arts and crafts sub?
---
People leeching over a guide to avoid 5$ then laugh at people not spendin 13$ for wow subs classic
---
You are pathetic slimes
---
Yes, they are on the same account.
---
Idk what's the big deal about all these guides. It is not like people didn't level up to 60 without them ffs. You'll level up faster if you are doing dungeons.
---
Kill Ragnaros
---
I will level up mining real quick and start farming lesser blood stone ore ASAP. I plan on beeing the only one selling in Bulk for the quest in STV easy $$$
---
An updated version of the guide that he's recently spent months working on to make sure it's properly up todate with all 1.12 content, yes. It's not the same guide at all and you can find the old one all over the internet (even in this thread) if you don't want to pay for the new one.
---
Substantially more than the others?  Not really.  Maybe mage for money, since they already farm better than most others at endgame.
---
Would you be saying same shit if 5h before Classic launch Blizz said you have to buy Classic WoW access pass for 50$ or else you won't be able to play?
---
I just want to see a server by server one. Like why have me pick thalnos and my language if you’re not going to show me the demographics for everyone who picked thalnos?
---
Using a bit of standoffish humor isn’t belittling anybody.  OP asked what I’m using, and I answered.  May have been a bit sarcastic in my response, but you could benefit from some thicker skin if that offends you.
---
I think karma farmers downvote all new comments and posts so theirs may rise more.
---
I mean difficulty level. Classic wow is “harder” than BFA. I’m not saying BFA didn’t flop I just mean difficulty in general. Like group finder, easier leveling etc being available now.
---
You've made me ruin my good pants
---
Pro strat my man... I'll LOS guides and stuff
---
Those "random enchantment" items are going to be ridiculously hard to get the right roll on. Dont count on them.
---
Yeah, even outside of rewards more resources and time went into PvE. It is a PvE centric game and always has been.
---
Curse and twitch are handling addons right now. 
---
There's a client for twitch, but doing the old stuff about putting them into folders works just as well. 
---
You will need addons specifically made for classic though, they are listed under curse/twitch. Your old addons will not work, but pretty much everything you could think of already exists as a modern version.
---
dude center your text
---
Yes it's possible
---
Very cool - thanks for sharing!
---
Why is their only 5 PVP realms listed on EU Realm Distributions?
---
It depends on what you think of as a bad healer. If the healer is so bad they can't keep the tank alive you literally can't progress through the dungeon. Like, you won't be able to kill any of the relevant bosses.
---
Wonder if this means even without more than 5 people you can set it to a raid and gear up without getting xp. For gearing twinks and such
---
I didn't say he -couldnt- do that, I'm saying its a bad move. Not only does it look bad, it's also a ridiculously outdated method of doing things. Also, these 'half assed free guides' are anything but, it sounds like you're a fanboy and you need to get your head out of your ass. I like Joana and the work he puts in, but I think he's stuck firmly in the past when it comes to monetising his work, and other creators are doing a far better job when it comes to that, Hakurai for example has an exceptionally well detailed guide, completely free of charge, funded by donos, ad rev and the like. 
---
Joana can do whatever he wants, I'm not going to pay for a guide, but I might've donated to show some good will after using it like I am planning to do with other creators and have done with other creators in the past, namely Preach.
---
Think you've kind of missed the point I was making mate, we don't care about good or bad, we just want a fun goal to work towards :)
---
See you in 6 months
---
Pretty sure it was more than $5 and even 5 is too much for a guide for WoW leveling, something that is not that complex at all.  I ONLY got it, because it was my first horde toon and I wanted to see how far that I could get before TBC.  :)
---
Have you played on a vanilla private server before?
---
Haha okay. No problem! 
---
Nice explanations, though!
---
Seeya in classic, friend!
---
There are instant 60 pservers out there, find one of those and just experiment.
---
High level PVP will be a lot of fun on a warlock and a hunter.
---
Lower level PVP will be a lot more fun on a hunter than a warlock.
---
Both world PVP and battlegrounds.
---
All of which feel hollow and meaningless. That was my issue.
---
any recommendations on a good one?  I didn't get into the beta so I haven't followed/downloaded any addons for Classic yet.
---
It’s how leftists work my dude, nothing short of total acceptance of their viewpoint is allowed.
---
Warriors are also a great dps class so if i remember correctly most raids i played in had like 6-8 warriors, and some did offtanking now and then. I was alliance so not sure on shaman numbers, probably a similar number.
---
I agree to an extent. But there is a difference between constructive negative feedback and the fearmongers/private server shills declaring the game dead on arrival just because of these bugs/tests. Which I saw enough of to be annoyed by.
---
But that's the whole point of the discussion, sadly you will not.
---
The only time you will see a pile of bones is when combat is ongoing. Once people finished their corpse run the bones will despawn.
---
Even with vanilla graveyards no graveyard is further than 5 minutes away, but heck even if it were 10 minutes combat would still be ongoing by that time.
---
However questing on Nostalrius in Tarrens Mill an hour after large scale world pvp happened left a whole sea of skeletons.
---
It felt like the Warcraft version of Verdun and even though this is just such a small little detail, it does make me a bit sad that other new players won't be able to experience the same thing.
---
Although to be honest looking at all the downvotes I feel like Reddit might be the wrong platform in general to discuss things with very different opinions.
---
You'll not change people's minds even though everyone here is arguing from the point he thinks will make the game better.
---
It’s all about the amount of content available.
---
People pay $60 for a game that has 40-80 hours of gameplay.
---
There are people with a full year of played time on WoW, and some with way more. 
---
Just using that example:
---
365 x 40 = 14,600 hours in a year 
---
If 80 hours = 1 $60 game, a year of played time would be 182.5 games.
---
At $60 per that is $10,950 to play $60 games for a year. 
---
You could sub to WoW for 60 years for that much money.
---
Mage will be easier to level at first.  Priest takes some patience.  Seems like a lot of people are going priest so just something else to be aware of, but maybe that’s just conjecture and doesn’t matter.
---
Pservers aren’t perfectly accurate though, so he still has the official world record.
---
Pug raids of AQ20 or ZG will pop up frequently.  PVP gear can also be obtained through casual play.  5 hours/week of dedicated PVP will get a handful of blue pieces.  You can also do Dire Maul or the other end-game 5 mans / UBRS to get good blue pieces which let you be decently effective in PVP.
---
Most likely you will have more slots open, but there will still be a low limit of SPriest vs heals.
---
The percentage of people seeing some raid has nothing to do with being casual friendly. Lots of people who can't be bothered to be raiding regularly will still be able to enjoy Classic.
---
I'll just wait then...
---
Vanilla didn't have one specific villain like TBc had KJ and WotLK had lich King, the vanilla world was created to continue the Warcraft story and at the end of WC3 you're dealing with the scourge iirc
---
Vanilla starts with Ragnaros, who is an elemental lord that was banished / imprisoned for a very long time after the old God's occupation of azeroth. the Old God's were of superior power and dominated the elemental Lord's and forced them to fight the Titans alongside the Old Gods. The Pantheon witnessed the Old Gods' corruption of azeroth and the elemental Lord's and decided to take action (more went into this decision, such as the Pantheon's recognition of Azeroth as the most powerful world soul yet).   they dispatch the Titan-forged to deal with the Old Gods and elemental Lords. Y'shaarj proved too strong for the Titan-forged, so Amanthul ripped Y'shaarj out with his bare hands , however this left a gash in azeroth that poured out arcane energies stemming from Azeroth's world soul. This is what we know as the well of eternity. 
---
The Pantheon then realized they must change their tactics if they are to preserve Azeroth as the Old Gods were imbedded too deep into Azeroth. They decided to imprison the Old  Gods far below the surface of azeroth, where their corruption could be kept at Bay. The elemental Lord's were    imprisoned early and  fairly easily, which brings me to my main point:
---
Sorcerer-Thane Thaurrisan, leader of the Dark Iron Dwarves when the dwarven civil war broke out after Modimus Anvilmar's death, was defeated by the Bronzebeards and cast out of Ironforge. They retreated to the majestic Redridge Mountains, he declared himself emperor of a city he named after himself, Thaurissan, while plotting vengeance against his dwarf brethren. After many years, they launch a two-pronged attack, while he led an assault on Ironforge and his wife, Modgud, led an assault on Grim Batol, the Wildhammer capitol and fortress. They wanted *all* of Khaz Modan for themselves.
---
Thaurissan was defeated by Masoran Bronzebeard after a long battle, and fled like a coward realizing that if Modgud could not succeed he would be facing a pincer of the two armies on a counter attack. Modgud *did* die in battle to Khadros Wildhammer, but not before cursing the city of Grim Batol and making it uninhabitable . 
---
Thaurrisan (along with the Seven), sensing defeat and the two armies closing in, delve into forbidden lore and summon the **Great Firelord Ragnaros** at the area known as *Molten Core* to destroy his dwarven foes once and for all! However, suitably for Thaurissan, he drastically underestimated the Firelord's power, and was killed instantly along with the Seven as Ragnaros let off a wave of immolation that decimated the region, turning it from the gorgeous Redridge Mountain range to a desolate, ashy, and barren wasteland with a singular mountain in the center: Blackrock Mountain.
---
Disgusted with what happened, the two dwarven armies call off their attack on the DI dwarves and the war ends with the DI dwarves enslaved to Ragnaros.
---
Modgud and Thaurissan did indeed have one child, as Emperor Dagran Thaurrisan is a direct descendant and is still alive and well within Blackrock Mountain, with his wife, Moira (Bronzebeard) Thaurissan.
---
As you can tell by now, the lore of vanilla and Warcraft as a whole is incredibly in depth . I summarized a lot of this and it's still a novella. 
---
The Hakkari trolls are a really cool story, Nefarian and Onyxia are very cool stories as well, obviously AQ with Cthun is fucking awesome, and then naxx has a ton of lore too . 
---
Imo, vanilla didn't go exactly as planned because if it did, WotLK would've been the 2nd expansion, KT being the final boss of vanilla. 
---
Instead, I'm pretty sure karazhan was supposed to be the final raid, leading to our worry about KJ and the burning legion and Medivh's whole thing -- coulda been extremely awesome. Vanilla nearly felt incomplete in terms of raid lore :(
---
It's because the poll got most of its data from reddit and discord, communities where people figured out it was better to switch to firemaw due to qeue times. I think if you were to poll it to audiences outside of reddit and discord, Shazzrah will probably still get the most votes.
---
As a leftist myself, what does this have to do with absolutely anything.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter what he says, it's not binding, he can always change his model.
---
These are the things that make somebody the bad guy.
---
That said, I don't know Joana and don't really think he's a bad guy. If he wants to charge for his guides that's fine... I also don't know if he actually promised anything or not.
---
Why would he not want financial support for the one thing he is passionate about, speedruns? If you were the expert on a specific task and you had hundreds of thousands of people asking you about it, would you not also think about getting paid for it? Fuck off lol
---
I would pay 5$ without a doubt but when he does like this.. oh man he aint get a penny from me. Douche move. 
---
Even less chance with a subscription the fuq?
---
I came from SW:G where it was a brutal grind, and thought the same thing. Watching my buddy play, and I said, "It tells you where the quest turn-in is on the map? (the ? icon) That's too easy!".
---
Eventually I tried it a little while later, and I was hooked almost instantly.
---
I guess if you're doing dedicated runs in a guild where everyone knows you're specifically shooting for Rend. My personal experience was more, one person in the guild needs Dal'Rend, one person needs to finish Ony attunement, and we're all just sitting here hoping that one of the guys with the key signs on so we can pug the last two members of a group and we finally get 80% of the way through the instance after four hours, but then the healer DC's and oh god it's 2 AM. 
---
(I still love this game please understand)
---
Classic has the color blind mode?
---
I’d argue differently. You could actually die questing in classic wow whereas today it not so common lol at least that’s what I’ve noticed.
---
One is gonna get ganked a lot during his leveling, the other will gank lol
---
i forgot, already did it whit Jdownloader.
---
Yea, but with raiding he can continue to improve his character and actually get somewhere with ranking he will reach his cap in a couple weeks and be unable to go anywhere from there.
---
Some people enjoy the 1-59 phase.
---
They are good for the servers
---
I think he meant "Is taking the WW Sword as a human warrior technically better than the WW Axe?"
---
THat's a question I've actually often had myself.  I *think* after some digging that I found the WW sword isn't, but technically the WW mace is better...but to still just take the axe so you can take axe spec and not have to respec that until 60 b/c of all the axes you get leveling up around that time.
---
No, but if you look at these guides it's a bunch of text compared to the addons simple in game UI with the arrow. There is text but you could basically just use the arrow to see where to go and glance at the actual quest text.
---
One of the best/renown mages on my original server was a troll mage by the name of Krazytucky. He did really well for himself. If its what you want, go for it man. The troll crouch animation is one of my favorites ones in wow.
---
9 classes clashing!
---
Pepega
---
about skeletons.
---
That was a peach 👍🏻 so true
---
I literally did.  Blew my mind.  The only in-game punishment I've ever received.
---
&gt; Its a leveling guide.
---
You sound like you never used it. It's not a leveling guide - it's an addon.   It works well.  You are just talking shit.  What a loser.
---
Fair enough. I see this having a decent base since BFA is so bad.
---
The hundreds of UD strat runs i did for baron's mount.... never got it...
---
For me? No. I've been waiting for classic for over 5 years. I just didn't want to go the private route.
---
Ele is fine if you can get a lot of mage water whenever you login.  You have to drink a lot, it's kind of like mage leveling but they can at least make water for free.  If you have to buy it, you'll never afford a mount.
---
Or just leave it how it was and people stop being pussies.
---
And anyone that wishes to indirectly support the guy, they can whitelist the site.
---
I mean AzerothAutoPilot is great, Questie. I have both of those downloaded atm.
---
You're not gonna get to lvl 60 in a week bro. People forget it's vanilla, not post-vanilla. Levelling is hard now.
---
Am I missing something? These guides only seem to go up to a certain level range?
---
Nothing I’m shitposting away until Classic
---
I'm going Pagle and I know it's going to suck. My friend doesn't want to be on a pvp server whatsoever and my desire to play with him is greater than my desire to be on a pvp realm, so here I am. But pagle is like 70% Alliance. According to the last survey, it's actually the most imbalanced realm of all of them, including NA and EU. PVP is just not going to really exist in phase 1 and phase 2 will for sure be bg only for the vast majority of us. 
---
A bad faction balance also hurts immersion, which is a factor for me when it comes to enjoying an MMO. World of WARcraft just wouldn't feel the same if I only saw one of two horde per day.
---
Still better than the Ragnaros redesign we got in Cataclysm.
---
I have no doubt they will follow through on removing it, at latest, during the transition to phase 2. I just hope they treat each server case by case - Herod shouldn't hold the others back.
---
I think that you're going to find people don't stop playing the game because they realize that classic wow isn't about the race to endgame it's about the joy of leveling. The game also has no expiration date passed perhaps the release of a classic TBC. This means that people can take their time to level and have little consequence of falling behind. The pace of vanilla is going to be however you want to set it especially with the addition of phases which give plenty of players many months to get to level 60 if they wish to participate in battlegrounds or other 60 content later on
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Yeah, I mean, at this point it's pretty clear that they plan to do it and think it's an important thing to remove. If you just don't believe them, and think they are lying I would just call you a tin-foil hat conspiracy theorist. 
---
If they change their mind and decide to not remove it, I'll be upset as well.
---
i was thinking the same but i have no idea how things work, if i order a print on this and for example lets say 100x100 (cm) would it work fine?
---
 or does the picture needs to be resized before?
---
&gt; Maybe that's what you want. But you can't force your experience on other people. 
---
Take your own advice and fuck off then.
---
I'm used to buying a game once. I guess the fact that I've never played a monthly subscription game (well except membership for runescape many years ago, it was way cheaper as I remember though).
---
Whats with the hate for Asmon?
---
Swedish/Finish have mostly moved to Gehennas.
---
...
---
I met those expectations in vanilla^and flunked out of college^twice
---
Wtf am i watching
---
No problem, hopefully someone else finds my links if they want all the images locally like we did.
---
Actually, he plays alliance^^^i'msosorry
---
Does anyone actually *need* a leveling guide? 
---
Just go to the areas for your level. Do all the quests. If you didn’t level up enough for the next zones, grind mobs at your level. 
---
It’s simple. And any “efficient guide” is only going to take off a few hours of gameplay to max.
---
WOW,Steam and MSN !
---
Somewhere in the revival area would make sense too. If you can revive yourself, it would be somewhere you just died. Therefore still in the danger zone for newcomers.
---
UBRS rend run is like 20 minutes.
---
I hated so much about GW2. Lack of diverse skills to use at any one time. Level scaling, PvP gear was cosmetic. It just felt flat to me, but each to their own.
---
You should add Human - Rag'n'Bone Man to the human palylist
---
Pardon me? Shitty? Im my town the call me Vicasso!
---
I'm concerned that bad MC runs will turn into the M+ scene. Where people expect you to vastly outgear content as soon as things start to get difficult. You need gear, but a lot of it comes down to game sense.
---
Can you ask the guards where stuff is or was this implemented later?
---
Aww and how old is your little boy? Nice of him to paint you this.
---
Bob Ross would be proud of you.
---
Yeah, I'm thinking another role might be the play. As for warrior, I worry I just might as well be tanking at that point...is there much of a difference there? And would you recommend Fury or Arms?
---
I'm also considering Holy Paladin, which I would presumably level with ret? Is that a decent route?
---
At pur awe at the sheer size of this lad's screen in 06
---
if i want to get paid, yeah. i'm on wage/hourly pay, [as are 58% of americans](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm), which usually means you don't get paid for sick days since you aren't working.

Imagine having to play from a hotel because your wife is so disgusted by your presence when you play video games. If you can't enjoy your hobby around your family then something is horribly wrong there.

XD, nice job
---
don't forget bust tea's guide for horde, guild lime's guides, vanilla-leveling.me, tactics_lol twitch subscriber guide (free up to 30), I think cauthonluck has one, and the 100s of others out there I have not found.
---
You mean at the same node or just in general?
---
Get lvl 10 in your respective newb zones and move to barrens.
---
Nailed him with the “You are 12” comment. Let’s fuckin gooooo
---
the guild is already pretty set 
---
Whats even funnier is I ended up as a pally (the alliance poster class) 
---
its not all bad, it will be a new adventure
---
Thank you sir!
---
I know people love to repeat this point but seriously.. Based on the Beta we know private servers actually take much longer to level on, and yet people have done it in 3 days played.
---
The private server records may not be seen as legit, but they are as shit are a lot faster.
---
Heh, cute ;)
---
😰
---
Lol I remember my guilds first MC run.  Nobody had done a raid before, the tanks pull.  The dps starts up, the healers start healing and the tanks die and we wipe on the first two giants.  It was hilarious
---
It was free because there was literally no demand for it, he also wasn't working on it. It was a paid guide back in Vanilla. All of this is covered on multiple podcasts... And it still doesn't explain why people believe they are entitled to something just because it used to be free. This dude has put inummerable hours working on this guide. Charging for it is his pergoative. Buying it is ours...
---
I'm already subscribed to your youtube. Your editing is awesome. Can't wait for some Classic Elemental Shaman pvp vids.
---
You know what server you will be playing ?
---
Who would have paid for a guide usable only for private servers? Now that classic is coming out there is a bigger market for it and Joana is capitalizing on it.
---
$5 is nothing for all the work he's put into this and if that is too much there are a few free alternatives.
---
Apparently some toxic brits from Shazzrah discord are voting firemaw and chose spanish as their primary language.
---
Both are in demand, it comes down more to how much you’re willing to commit. You can’t be lax or take a raid night off as a tank, especially a main tank, but the perks are that you typically get the best gear funneled to you. As a healer you get more flexibility but fewer perks.
---
Firemaw only have high because it just released. The other 3 EU pvp servers are Full Firemaw is medium.
---
Get the one that lets you know how much stuff is worth and a greyseller
---
[This is my evidence](https://i.imgur.com/mNlfYpN.jpg). 3k server queue means about a 4 hour wait time. 10k queue would be over 12 hours if it scaled linearly (which it doesn't; people are less likely to stick it out as the queue lengthens). You're right that I am just speculating but I do have at least some evidence for my claim.
---
This sounds like a bunch of unnecessary code running every time someone dies when y’all are just going to get over it anyway.
---

---
Unironically the best 5 man content in WoW's history was early cata heroic dungeons.
---
oh shit, hard coded arrays?
---
If this is true, then he indeed is behaving a bit fishy.
---
At least if he said that the guides will be free for everyone 🤔
---
"more potential friends"
---
But you also didn't write the [Official WoWhead Guide to Classic Wailing Caverns](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wailing-caverns-classic-dungeon), did you?
---
Wvw was a blast at the beginning - and then after running with a zero or a group for 25 minutes, just to die and run back and try to catch up to the group for 10 minutes. It lost the fun factor.
---
in general, I like that in WoW one must make a choice to be able to gather
---
Frankly, anyone that **needs** a guide to max is retarded. It’s all self explanatory.
---
many mechanics were unchanged, but the #s were incredibly nerfed. Some of the damage ticks from bosses were about the same in WRATH as in vanilla. When people had many times more hp. Let that sink in.
---
It's almost as if this reddit is one of the best ways to express your ideas and issues for classic so that we can fight for the best experience possible. But yeah just go and downvote and dislike people for stating their opinions. Classic is gonna be fucking great, why can't you just let us fight to make it even better?
---
Yes after my legendary I was totally done with the game.. and because leveling was so easy you could have so many max level alts so easily..
---
No, it has nothing to do with hating anyone else. Elitist is just somebody who views themselves as somebody more skilled at the game that most people.

and i have a premium account for  raidbots , raider.io  ,spotify , netflix , prime ,  and  much other stuff i have no problem paying for  a service
---
Excited to use these instead of the shady profit driven discord severs.
---
Let's take your theory and apply it to pizza. You make pizzas and ask for donations instead of payment, how does that work?
---
Gonna need some evidence to support this claim.
---
That damn man splaining
---
With a full raid maybe 20 of them need BiS another 15 need ok gear the other 5 can probably be carried in greens
---
There is pvp gear and I imagine it's going to be a bit tough for casual players to get it. PvP items are dependant on your rank, rank 14 being only 0.1% of players or some crazy shit like that. 
---
I will also be going for PvP gear and playing casually. I'm probably going to look like a five year old that decided to dress themselves for the day.
---
&gt; even expecting to see skeletal carnage at the scene of an immense battle.
---
That can still happen, did you even really look into what it's going to be like?? Every player can still leave behind one skeleton, that gets replaced only when they die and revive again. So after an immense battle you'd still have a plethora of skeletons. What exactly are you arguing for?
---
Warrior is probably the single most useful class in Classic.
---
Classic launches on the same day that classes start for me, rip.
---
Asled Nazak they are working on it.
---
Probably not what you want to hear, but I'd strongly advise against using a controller. You're skills will surely be transferable, but controller viability will not. I say this as someone who has played a lot of both games and has experimented with controllers on both.
---
I think so yeah. I have no idea what the range limit is though, it's pretty big.
---
So what's the current knowledge? Are the BGs cross realm or not?
---
Corrupt, imperfect private servers have thrived for literally a decade. There's a reason for that (and no, it isn't because they're free).
---
Do I think Classic will gain traction over time and hold the interest of everyone? No. I think it will slowly shrink over time. However, I think initial numbers are going to be staggeringly high. Like "retail expansion launch" high.
---
Blizz may aswell rename it to WoW - not so classic false advertising lol
---
I'm not planning on blazing through leveling since that just sounds...well, rough, and I've disliked it in retail enough. How does the tank situation change as the patches progress? Like for AQ or Naxx, will it have changed significantly by then? Not sure how the balance will progress with the phases exactly.
---
keep your money. You got it when he was giving it away for free, you don't owe him anything.
---
#Don’t tell other people how to play or how to act.
---
Ah well. Worth a shot then I guess. Not expecting much.
---
Hnnnnnng. Me.

For real. Fuck the guide; I would donate directly to that.
---
This subreddit is a big PvP echochamber for the most part. PvE has always been the biggest proportion of the population.
---
3h later still not done!
---
games always have the hardcore player population, some people just want to take things to another level.
---
Yes, you can ask the guards for directions.
---
It’s supposed to work till lvl 40 as of now but I haven’t tested it nor will I, but you should be fine the developer has a good rep and wouldn’t just release a busted add on
---
Tauren melee ragne is 2 meters longer than all other races. They can hit a hunter in their dead zone.
---
Yeah I just recently took a month off.  Granted most of it was not paid since I didn't have the vacation time saved up.  I think it depends on the company/line of work though.  My boss couldn't care less and just asked me to take pictures lol.  Some are luckier than others I guess.
---
On the spreadsheet it works as a general 2% buff, because thats how its coded in the client - the crit chance shown in the spellbook takes both into account.
---
If its turn out to be different in Classic, i'll change it.
---
Best set, worst faction.
---
he sold the guides for 30$ each back then
---
Yeah the level scaling was good on the one hand, but I also made you feel like you did not achieve anything. I also hated most of the cosmetic stuff so that made me feel like I didn’t really accomplish anything on that front too
---
Ahahhahahahah
---
It is absolutely worth buying the lesser and greater magic wand off the AH if the prices aren't inflated. Another option would be to craft it yourself with enchanting but I would only go that route myself if I planned to keep enchanting the entire game.

Thanks for the answer!

He said that multiple times in his stream. That's the whole reason I decided to subscribe to him the first time I did, because he seemed to be doing something nice for free and I wanted to support that.
---
Life comes at your fast.
---
To be fair just recently Joana was like a 15 viewer Castlevania speedrunner and even now, sure, he has had a sudden explosion of popularity because of Classic (and a shitton of advertisement from things like reddit and other content creators) but even between the beta hype and death he jumped from thousands of viewers right down to a couple hundred.
---
He could easily fade away in a couple months. Especially considering we have no idea what kind of long term success Classic will have on Twitch. Also he's not some hyper-extroverted entertainer type of person, much savvier types have failed to capitalize on their flavor of the month fame.
---
Warrior, priest and mage. Half the population.
---
As long as I hit 40 within 4 weeks I’ll be happy, currently have 7days 2hrs played on my third priest at lvl 56 on lightshope
---
Wife is joining me in classic a month or so after launch (She wants me to be close to 60 because shes bad at pvp and wants someone to protect her lol) and my kids love watching me play so i am good. Work on the other hand is another topic that i want to not talk about right now.
---
The engineering head can proc with +36 frost damage on it
---
That may seriously be the best thing I have ever watched on the net.  10/10!  The mental math rolling just about made my head explode.
---
If they wanted accurate information like they say there would be me no charge to reserve a name.
---
I have done that. It’s losing character names to bots that suck
---
Well, I guess I'll have to tinker with sensitivity and practice. Thank you for the insight!
---
can you pm me a link to the firemaw discord please?
---
It’s 2019. Muh hate speech
---
Whatever tickles their fancy, it’s not something I do, nor have any desire to do. They wanna LARP in WoW classic by all means. Just trying to give a non troll answer to what is “expected” in a RP server. They want names that aren’t stupid and don’t want world chat filled with dumb shit, so they hide under the guise of RP.
---
still hes selling blizzards property, idk why he thinks that is ok.
---
The tried that with all the top private server guilds, who turned them down because they realized it benefited them in no way. So they are going with TipsOut guild and "it is totally our choice that we are not competing for world firsts".
---
shhh wtf
---
Rend has A LOT of good gear.  Rend-only runs are very common.
---
Strongly disagree. Dual spec systems allow for hybrid classes to actually play the game as it’s meant to be played in a solo setting - something pure DPS classes never have to worry about. 
---
The way specialized talent trees affect a priest vs a mage in the open world are wildly different. Its oppressive if your class is not a pure damage dealer. 
---
Additionally the above poster was correct in stating that it limits the availability of tanks and healers at any given time. 50g is a significant amount of gold in classic and will usually be too much for most people to consider swapping specs to help fill a less common slot (I.e., healing as an offspec to help a guild dungeon run).
---
But the plan the entire time was to have low layer levels to test the tech. You really think blizzard needs raging reddit posts to change that?
---
If Herod is too much. Then yes, I will likely be playing Stalagg - Horde.

And a warlock... ;)

No effort at all and not invested in the slightest - simply explaining simple human behavior to someone who can't grasp why people wouldn't want to play Warcraft above all else.
---
Cheers to you too!
---
Done ;)
---
Ok bud :)
---
45 minute Baron run is only doable if your tank or dps are in AQ/ZG gear. It was one of the worst designed upgrade mechanics in all of wow history. Basically a group in blues is going to have to be super disciplined and coordinated to complete the run. From my memory back in the day it was only being cleared by people in tier gear which defeated the whole purpose of adding the upgrade quest.

---
Shaman here, can confirm. I gotchu fam. How else am I gonna get into the group?
---
Casual: no guides, just out to explore and maybe check out the old zones. Sits down every gaming session and wonders what they'll do for leveling that day.
---
Semi-hardcore: Knows their game plan and intends to execute it. They know their class well, know their leveling strategy, and have a firm goal to hit level 60. They balance this with a job and family and other obligations.
---
Hardcore: They will be squeezing in a few hours of sleep. Every part of their plan is finalized and they've done 3 practice runs to 60. World first, server first, they're trying for it.
---
Save thread because internet
---
I ran WC during the last stress test with my level 15 alliance warrior. I love the dungeon's atmosphere, but I'm probably not going to do it again... getting there is such a slog, and then there's the long, exhausting nature of the dungeon itself.
---
Ironforge had the auction house. Stormwind didn't.
---
Ty for the advice. Considering warrior or rogue.
---
That's purely because the survey was linked in the Firemaw discord at a time when a lot of people saw it.
---
In comparison, on shazz it got burried in spam way too fast and that's by all accounts (discord size, blizzard reported population, etc.) still a bigger realm.
---
this seems sus
---
Please enlighten me what he changed on his horde leveling guide in last 3 days.
---
Can't shit on OP for being a good opportunist. Pretty meh guide if I am honest though.
---
Amazing work. Will definitely look for a high quality printing service and hang it home!
---
fun times wasn’t it?
---
Na my dude! Me, just like everyone else on this sub is hyped for classic and would check every interesting topic. And downvote me all you fucking want for expecting a plate BIS list for warrior.
---
A lot of people are gonna really have a bad time if they rush to the cap since they’ll run out of stuff to do.  No dungeon queues, fewer dungeons, no BGs, need 40 people to raid.
---
Not that there isn’t anything to do but there isn’t a ton to do either
---
Fahrenheit for mage (main)
---
Kontagion for lock
---
Hanibal for whatever
---
You kinda sound like a little bitch right now.
---
Because he said it would be free multiple times on stream and asked for donations to help support. People did, he made a ton of money off that. Then turns around and paywalls it, fuck that guy. Money hungry.
---
He should've stuck to what he said or changed what he was saying.
---
Thanks!  Question: why are horde warlocks better than alliance?  I guess most importantly, which Horde races are best for lock?
---
I was a healer as a druid for a while but ended that after a while and never really wanted to go back so... maybe I don't want to be a priest.
---
I was always envious of warrior gear since their gear was always really flashy in vanilla.  Plus it seems even if you can't get a spot tanking, their dps is really good.  
---
I did always wanna play mage though for their cool mobility gimmicks like blink, slow fall, teleport, portal.
---
I always liked t1 more aesthetically. But I also got my t2 helm when it was an ugly yellow turban and not a cool halo
---
That's true. I am curious who'll have the classic record. My money is not on Joana.
---
Joana's guides a terrible anyway. Its literally a step by step that takes you longer to use than if you just figured it out yourself. 
---
The dude wrote them in 05/06 in the form of a gamefaqs walkthrough.
---
I need friends on that server. Rolling a NE Hunter lol
---
Yep. I look forward to casually strolling to 60, enjoying the ride, then letting everyone else carry me through the endgame content that they've been banging their heads against to get server firsts.
---
Anyone remember those little booklets in Blizzard game boxes that had previews to upcoming games? I can't remember if it was in Warcraft 3 box or Starcraft 1, but I remember the first WoW advert I saw from that. It was just a picture of an STV bridge.
---
10-15 hours per week is doable, but I'm not sure if you'll be geared enough or in time to get a spot in a "top guild".  Most hardcore guilds will have a raiding roster of 60's in the first few weeks, while it'll take you months to hit 60 with that playtime.  I know several groups that are going 18+ hours a day until they hit 60 for example.
---
10-15hours a week is plenty of time to raid and mess around as well.  Most guilds these days do 3 hours raids 2 or 3 days a week.
---
Are you trolling 4 month old comments?
---
Provide your counter source, 23 US guilds prior to TBC pre patch has been the often claimed number for, oh I dunno, the last decade.
---
They didn't change their stance, Zygor just got around it.
---
Yeah I can confirm tons of Swedes on Gehennas discord right now.
---
&gt;So he changed his mind. Are people not allowed to do that?
---
Would you be saying this if, 5 days before Classic released, Blizz changed their mind and decided that you now need to pay $50 for the base game in order to play Classic?
---
Persistent corpses better?
---
I work in a building and have my own office. So someone with seniority is transferring in and I have to give up my office.
---
My boss felt bad, he asked me what he could do to so I asked him for tuesday -friday off. Shitty cubicle to play wow at launch. Sounds like a good trade to me, although my clients will probably ask what's up, it is what it is.
---
I like T3 but hard to get.
---
&gt; Not even sure where you got the idea.
---
I know, because you’re so narrow-minded you don’t understand the implications you’re asking for.
---
Pressing a button called donate, spending money and then expecting something in return is flawed logic at it's finest.
---
just grind
---
1-15 guides are not really that useful on launch no. But after that, they are great.
---
&gt; Which would be fine if he hadn't already said it would not be a pay guide this time.
---
I thought he did too.  But some how we missed that he was non committal to having the entire web guide hosted in its entirety for free?  I think that is most people's reaction.  "Why is he charging? fuck him.  But it is only five dollars so maybe use it just a little bit until I reach 60."
---
Now link 99 more and show how they are better.
---
yep, much easier to casually raid with guild for decent gear and then PvP in your spare time, than the other way around.
---
As someone who commonly tanks in MMO's, a good tank has tools that can mitigate a bad healer.  A good tank has a lot of control over the flow of battles (location, direction, etc) and can really make things easier for everybody.  A good tank can hold out when the healer goes down or needs to focus elsewhere for a moment.
---
A bad tank can only be healed by an AWESOME healer, who probably isn't going to waste their time.  A bad tank has no control over the flow of battles and can actually make things WORSE for everybody.  A bad tank dies more often and because the healer probably has a shit-ton of healing aggro from trying to keep the bad tank alive, the boss one-shots the healer and the raid is over.
---
I’m no longer at my apartment..
---
But why would I make this up? All together this wasn’t really an issue since I was able to get online after manually logging in, but this did occur and potentially needs attention.
---
Commenting to save. Thanks!
---
Priests seem strangely high on lots of these surveys. They usually hover around the 9-11% range for vanilla servers. I've been seeing 12-14% on all these surveys. Its making me reconsider my choice.
---
Medical bills, I hear
---
Nobody cares about how smart you think you are
---
7 of those items aren't on my list. I won't have tailoring, I won't have engineering, I won't farm ST 100 times until I get the offhand and I sure as hell won't pay insane amounts of gold for BOE epics.
---
na he pronounces it not as jo-ana but as jone-na.
---
Funny how true this is. My friends dad played a gnome in vanilla and I randomly grouped with him in SM while leveling an alt. I don't think he ever made it to 60.
---
Im gonna slightly disagree on recovery. I had open heart surgery just a few years ago and was pushed to be up and active the next morning.. recovery is oddly quick with heart surgery
---
Yes you need a higher level friend to help but you do not need to lock XP in vanilla or presumably classic. I know this because I've done it and helped with it several times.
---
STALAGG REPRESENT
---
he is not allowed to do w.e he wants with content he creates using blizzards property
---
Yea, but if you gave out your book for free for 5 years+ and not only started charging again for it, but also made everyone that already owned it pay for it to use it again.
---
No one is disagreeing that in 2004, WoW compared to other MMO's was extremely casual friendly.  But it's not 2004 and the comparison most people playing Classic will have is to 2019 WoW (BFA).  And in comparison to BFA, Classic is not going to be Casual friendly at all.  Another user in this thread summed it up nicely.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cth8m7/wow\_classic\_life\_as\_a\_casual\_player/exkwp9v?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cth8m7/wow_classic_life_as_a_casual_player/exkwp9v?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Oooo so pretty thank you
---
(You're talking about the wowclassic one, he's talking about the vanilla-questing one which is what he replied to and that one does send you to durotar early. There's a lot more running around in that one to keep you above the quests you're doing from what I could tell)
---
Yeah, folks shouldn't let gear scaling at naxx deter them from playing the pokemon master class if thats what they want to play, because like 99% of the time it's moot and the 1% of the time it matters, it still won't matter, you'll be playing a class you like.  I'd imagine anyhow, I'm not going huntard - collecting rare pets is cool and all, but I hate the stand and auto grinding.
---
The thing that dude said about ret palis being the ultimate leveling class since you can watch porn while you level also holds true for hunters.
---
As a warrior I'll be watching twitch on my second monitor since I'll need both hands for playing the game.
---
Yea I’ve definitely been there. There is just so much loot that is good up to rend that there will definitely be multiple rend groups running at the same time and ony attunements/ full clears. True strike shoulders, briarwood reed, dal rends, and felstriker are all in very high demand. From my experience on pservers (I know, shoot me), you could get into a pretty good group that’s clearing rend in 30 or less with only 5-10 minutes downtime in between runs looking for another Jed id. However, these were definitely not the norm. Most people bailed after 1-2 runs or if they got their loot and you were always at the mercy of the key holder being there or buying it from someone nearby. Even in the best of groups, my rogue never even saw the mainhand drop once and I managed to snag the offhand after 30ish runs. I did about 80 total runs by the time i stopped playing in anticipation for classic release.
---
As a druid --- sweeeeeet I will feel like a special little moonglade snowflake
---
The first real gear check in vanilla raiding was Vaelstraz.
---
You can gear up in MC np.
---
I expect that the majority of the PVE players will log-in last  few days.
---
Mainly older people who dont want to engage to pvp due to lack of time and dont have reddit and such accounts
---
God damnit you just reminded me of the Naxx attuenement process.
---
Fair. It's really two different things that people are arguing about simultaneously: him charging for his guide (totally his choice, plenty of people do it), and him switching to a paywall a week before classic (debatable).
---
I'm sorry but I'm feeling like you're either trolling or just trying to pull me in a very uninteresting dialogue.
---
Many people still say subbed anyway  and he gets a lot of views just from streaming his old 2005 speedrun videos
---
I dont recall much PvP at Desolace....
---
What a scummy move.
---
Itll be fun to see warcraft log reports.
---
There was an AMA? someone got a link?
---
Yeah and that go-go-go attitude will get you and your group killed in dungeons or open world.
---
Xp rates may be different for classic but on private servers there were 100% not enough quests to go that route. You had to go ef&gt;lm-&gt;aub&gt;wf&gt;rr&gt;aub/ash&gt;rr&gt;duskwood if you wanted to not have to grind a lot
---
Personally, I plan on pre shitting myself before servers open. Just to get into the atmosphere.
---
No, there is no difference of opinion here. He is just wrong, a donation is a gift and it is completely wrong to expect literally anything in return, ever. I don’t care if they actually look it up, just letting them know how stupid this sentiment makes them look.
---
Not necessarily burning out excitement. I rolled a few toons on a pserver to help me pick what I wanted to actually play for classic.
---
Yeah I didn't know about the health issues till now.
---
if you dont want to watch both games then just dont click on the game you dont want to watch.  
---
I think it should remain one section as it makes WoW look better overall. I get the counterpoints to separate them though
---
Play Ret and practice fine art
---
Is that sarcasm? Because I honestly don’t understand how that’s a mystery to you: YES! That’s EXACTLY what I’m saying - I’m not arguing for the sake of argument. I started playing in 1.12, before I even knew what dungeons were I saw others on my server refer to it as VC, so I followed along and learned from them - how is that concept so hard to grasp for you? That people who played on a server for the first time just followed the same lingo as the rest of the players on the server (which is probably how it evolved to be VC on some servers and DM on others).
---
Again, my server (Bleeding Hollow) called it VC, and laughed at anyone who would call it DM. It’s wasn’t my choice, I just rolled with it and assumed that’s how all servers were. Occasionally I’d see someone post LFG DM and get a response like “a little low-level to be doing Dire Maul, aren’t you?” which would turn into a big argument of whether to call it VC or DM, but 99% of the people called it VC.
---
Tbh, modern CPU integrated graphics (vega 8/10 or intel 630) can easily handle WoW Classic.

Using images from blizzards game which is Blizzards IP...

Yeah also in this thread: People who think hate speach is allowable as long as a insignificant part of the game can stay.

If you ever want to PvP, being able to Inner Focus a Devouring Plague on someone seems like huge deal, and WOTF is WOTF... That's why I'm choosing Undead, but it's a really difficult choice.
---
That is a key point and something that is a little hard to accept if you are coming from retail. 
---
If you notice the same person continues to pull aggro ask him to dial down the dps until you’ve built threat on that target.
---
They did it for runescape which is way smaller than classic/retail.
---
I hope you're doing commissions.
---
Where is it behind a paywall? I am able to access it for free just fine.
---
Im sure they will all be at the top for a while since a lot of big name people are going to stream it, but i wish they would.
---
Totally okay with that. It’s about the journey.
---
Zygor is an add-on that has existed for 10+ years
---
😂😂 holy entitlement
---
I hope so, twitch does not have a good filter or search system. I'm not interested in watching retail streams. I also don't want to scroll through hundreds of streams looking for classic streams.
---
I have tried to find streams where people are discussing or prepping for classic over the past week or two. It is a pain sorting through all of the streams.
---
My bad, this does make things a lot better though.
---
I ran Scholomance at least 25 times before I  got the helm piece. It dropped on 3 - 4 occasions but another hunter in the group always won the roll.
---
What does monopolizing the server mean?
---
Well just do Lockdeath or Lockdrown or Drowning lol 
---
Or Saucy or Saucie 
---
no idea if any of those are available just spitballing
---
Fuck no. Deadmines ftw!
---
Reddit itself is alsovery biased. If you want actual stats the best is to look at the population size on the Realm List while not forgetting that this excludes the casuals.
---
I feel for you it took us awhile just to get him out to silithus haha.
---
Warlock has the highest skill ceiling and versatility, but both them and mages are very well rounded in PvP. Rogues are strong in a lot of areas but certainly have more pronounced weaknesses, especially if a lot of your utility spells are on cooldown.
---
The return of DKP, EPGP, etc. is gonna take a little getting used to.
---
... To answer the question
---
My friend had one just as worn! Good times
---
&gt; lie to exploit people
---
How did he do this? I'm not seeing anywhere he said they'd remain free. It's shady but not exploitative.
---
Is there something similar for Horde?
---
Rogue is fun in classic, from what I remember. You get slice and dice in all 3 (I think), and big numbers. Assassinate 1 shots feel fantastic while leveling. Warlock is great for solo leveling, huge utility with groups, you gotta carry around soul shards though. Warlock is my plan. They're consistently useful, and IMO, DOT classes are a lot of fun.
---
I remember losing it in vanilla, but not sure about beta.
---
I am (unfortunately) rolling alli as well but I am determined to make it to this dungeon. I don’t recall there being any prep quests for it. I’m just gonna force my group to schlepp our way down from ashenvale.
---
Thank you for the wholesome comment my dude 💜
---
Immersive indeed
---
I used to be very hardcore. 14h day fighting for server firsts in classic. I still have deep interest in the game and news, but I'll probably spend only a few hours a week in the game. 
---
I'll take months to reach 60, and I doubt I'll ever properly raid again, so I consider myself pretty casual.
---
Isn’t it an in-game guide? For it to be in-game, you’d make an addon to provide the info?
---
I got a lot of respect. And I think he's great at what he does. But this was very nearsighted thinking and a mistake in my opinion. This whole paying for Wow guides is a very antiquated way of thinking. If I were him I would have promoted my guide everywhere I could with links to my patreon twitch channel YouTube channel Etc and let everyone have it for free. These days it's not about if you can get someone to buy things it's about getting their attention.
---
I'm going to buy and sell gold just to piss you guys off. 
---
There is nothing wrong with people buying and selling a virtual currency. Get over your selves.
---
Oh I have zero interest in doing a bleeding edge guild again.  Already did that but one that will do 40 mans every reset without fail.  Odds are while leveling I will play more than that but after that point I plan to tone it down.  Heck with no sports for kids my weekends are pretty empty.
---
The big thing is that youll most likely be under leveled upon reaching the next zone, but this is how it is for most players. It incentivizes you to party up.
---
I couldn't answer because our guild hasn't decided on a server yet.
---
I always liked the Rubix pvp videos. Resto feral hybrid.  
---

*laughs in Spell Steal
---
People complaining about skeletons need to get their heads checked. Who the fuck cares?
---
Was deadset on druid. After watching too many youtube class guides and comparisons, i'm really intreagued by warlock and even more so priest.
---
Now its between these two. Leaning more towards priest.
---
Twisting Nether
---
I have the same one and my rmb stopped working cause i wore it out too much.
---
Can't find a single good horde in-game guide that works properly with Classic. Link please
---
Oh. Was the AH added in later in vanilla cause on stress test there was one in SW too, in the back of the building where the modern retail AH is located. Is the one in IF different though?
---
This days of Christmas post sucks, isn’t funny, and I hate seeing  the new version everyday.
---
Feral Druid vs rogue for PvP endgame
---
That makes a lot of sense. Undead is my favorite race athletically and love the whole starting zone. 
---
I guess my question could be rephrased as: between warlock and rogue, which class is hurt less in PvP by choosing undead over orc?
---
Gonna play what I want and screw the consequences! Night Elf Rogue, Human Warlock, let's go!
---
....Except my Priest, which will be Dwarf regardless of my feelings.
---
Bit of a necro since the AMA is over and all, but I currently have max level characters on a vanilla, TBC and WotLK server and I like being able to log in and experience each rendition of WoW when I want.  I would love to be able to do that in an officially sanctioned, stable environment.  Just gotta hope the population is there to support it.
---
Those aren't the wear marks of a keyturner that's for sure
---
Truely is breaking my heart...
---
I have a fond memory of a Tauren Warrior on a vanilla server I played on that would just sit in Org on his Raptor mount with his raid gear on. I wanted that.
---
There's a similar thing going on with the NA servers. Stallag has a higher percentage than Herod.
---
It’s the implication that you can’t have an RPG experience in modern WoW that’s controversial. Your comment didn’t imply that it was easier in classic; it implied that it wasn’t possible in today’s WoW and you’re excited for those possibilities to return (when they still exist)
---
Air of realms are full already and most are filling up still , just pick one that has high population if ur worried.
---
Something about you undead rogues tells me you’re lying!!!
---
\&gt;  you used to be able to slip into raids just by being *nice*. 
---
Players have only gotten better at the game so I think that if you aren't wearing a full set of BRM quest greens there will still be a sizeable casual playerbase that'll sneak you into raids if you're a nice player who at least tries to perform. The encounters might not be trivial but are also not excruciating enough that there's \*zero\* room for dead weight, if that dead weight is a pleasant addition to the guild's environment :)
---
I am genuinely curious how it would work out, my mind is really struggling to work out the high end content, and I've played FFXIV very different beasts.
---
Would love an update of how it all works out for you.
---
If you follow a good guide to the letter, know how to play your class,  you can get it easily below a 6days of /played .
---
With the weekends and 10 days off its 16 free days, so you can get to 60 by playing 9h/day.
---
That looks doable
---
This deserves gold
---
Supply and Demand. If there is a lot of gold spam past the first 2 months - its because people are creating the demand. I really hope Blizzard keeps the gold spammers to a minimal to help prevent the demand - but you are right, its the community that makes it possible for them to stay in business.
---
But dp is easily dispelled in group pvp which is why I think I like sg more
---
&gt; There are tons of people willing to provide the same level of resources for free so just use those. 
---
That's where I get a little confused. If you're selling an informational product than it needs to clearly stand out from the free stuff. (I suppose he could argue that his leveling guide is more finely tuned)
---
Even at a $5 price point, if I can just as easily google a leveling guide than there's no reason the average customer would pay. 
---
Then again, when I played Elder Scrolls online there was YouTubers selling build/leveling guides. So there might be a niche market of hardcore players willing to pay for the very best guides. 
---

My 2 cents would be orc warlock and undead rogue. Here's my reasoning: On ally the classes that fear you most often are priest and warrior (cos warlocks on ally side are underrepresented). Now their fears are short ranged so who will eat that more often? Your rogue or your warlock? Exactly. On top of that, the class you profit most against from stun resist will be enemy rogues, now if your rogue isn't an orc then you will just be even in the mirrors - not too bad. Your warlock will struggle when pummeled by multiple melees or rogues in particular - stun resist can be a key here.
---
Joana is horde...
---
Fake. No lvl 15 warrior ever had a full rage bar.
---
😂 sure you don't
---
You mean time played getting there! :)
---
you can do rend runs on ubrs which takes 15 min with a good run. man do you even vanilla bro? :P
---
I'm definitely calling tauren "all-beef patties, burgers &amp; big game" from here on out.
---
I cant seem to find anything on Grizzly rolling on stalagg is that still the case?
---
No I mean, if there's 4 mobs in front of me, Swipe will only hit 3 of them. How does the game choose which 3 mobs get hit?
---
In order to hit all 4 mobs, do I tab-target, or turn myself slightly towards the mob that isn't being hit, or...
---
Looks like PvE servers are going to be dead.
---
&gt; rank 14 being only 0.1% of players or some crazy shit like that.
---
Even rarer, isn't it? A server can only have 2 r14s a week, one for each side, if I remember correctly.
---
\&gt; Strongly disagree. 
---
Extra strongly disagree back.
---
\&gt;Dual spec systems allow for hybrid classes to actually play the game as it’s meant to be played in a solo setting - something pure DPS classes never have to worry about.
---
There are no hybrid specs in retail.  So irrelevant?  Even by WotLK, I'm pretty sure any hybrid specs had already been rooted out of the game.
---
Prot warriors were not 'meant' to play the game solo.  That's the whole point of going prot.  Is it inconvenient? Yes.  That's the whole point.  In a role playing game like vanilla, picking your spec was meant to be a commitment to a character design, not just a quick tool to fill whatever role is needed.
---
May not be your flavor, but IMO the game is better with limited respecs, and made worse with dual specs.  Again, you will find they're super convenient, but the external effects of too much convenience are bad for the game.
---
\&gt;Additionally the above poster was correct in stating that it limits the availability of tanks and healers at any given time. 50g is a significant amount of gold in classic and will usually be too much for most people to consider swapping specs to help fill a less common slot (I.e., healing as an offspec to help a guild dungeon run).
---
I didn't disagree with that claim.  Picking tank or healer should be a commitment in my view.  Also, queue times for dungeons are frequently very long even in retail so.. having multiple specs doesn't fix the problem.  The issue is more that most players just don't want to tank, not that it's expensive to switch.
---
Yeah this was like WoTLK or something, just one of the few remaining screenshots I had on my photobucket account.  Relevant regardless.
---
My wife and I will be rolling our priest/warrior combo again!
---
A toilet bowl would have been better than a treadmill tbh
---
*[vanish noise]*
---
:(
---
I think there's only two PvE servers in EU. Not too hard to pick the more populated one if you so desire.
---
This has been a big confusion for me. T.5 to me was the shit I got in like BRS and stuff. Think it was called prophecy er...devout? Idk I was 12. Anyway that’s .5 in my mind.
---
I'll mail you 3 bucks lol
---
Who needs a leveling guide? You guys dont know all the quests by memory?
---
I have had posters tell me they are 85% sure it worked either way.
---
It sure is! Your right Bloodfang would suit better for the Vanilla hype. But Merciless is my favourite looking set :D
---
You can farm AV rep (after AV comes out, that is) for TUF but yeah, it's rough.
---
I remember this review making me really interested in WoW, its funny in retrospect that they likely didn't even get past the starting areas.
---
Lots of empty calories in alcohol. Not to mention all the terrible eating choices you make at 11pm on a Tuesday. I am usually in bed before 11pm now. Classic might change that schedule for a little while but being tired is much better than being hungover.
---
Is this the newest version or the one from web.archive.org?
---
It really is. It almost a looks like they are skipping or something.
---
Imagine the opposite: he says a membership was coming and people should have known about it... okay then, but seeing how well recieved his twitch channel has been lately, he would have come out much much better in my opinion if he said a membership is coming but it's only for his in game addon that's gonna come out later and his written guide remains free because of everyone who's supporting him on twitch. Wouldn't that have been a much better and more popular move by him? We'd see a thread upvoted that says how great he is instead of about how he is tryna get $5 for the guide that has been free for years. Dumbo business move for sure, he should reconsider. His written guide might not even be the most optimized that's out there, in fact I bet it isn't at all.
---
As someone who is playing Horde in classic for the first time after being die hard alliance (my friends suck and wanted to play horde) I would love an Org map of points of interest like this. My biggest fear is wasting time not knowing where anything is
---
2 months in and nearly entirely round
---
Redditors would be among the most likely people to switch to Stalagg. That doesn't mean that thousands of people that haven't seen Blizzard's warnings or discussed it with anyone will also reroll.
---
Wow. That was actually pretty amazing. I feel like a couple of these guys really get the draw and understand what made WoW so amazing. 
---
I think travel really is a huge part of it. The fact that you can't just blink around the entire WoW universe in Classic makes the world feel that much bigger. You're hoofing it through all the different zones taking different paths and seeing the world. Not sitting in a capital city waiting in a LFR queue.
---
As one of two people who have spent thousands of hours parsing quest routes, small optimizations, skips, deaths, etc. I would wish you luck in that endeavor. It would be a monumental project.
---
We tracked the mob data, quest data, exploration data, timed each flight path, skip, hearth, walk in the game... it's a monster.
---
You're totally right, I completely forgot about the labs. That helps with figuring out my profession setup, thanks!
---
Dungeons, proffs, rep-grinds for some epic stuff, collect pets/mounts, rp, uhm... Might be more stuff
---
Hey there!  My cousins and I will be leading a guild along with some friends, and it seems like we all live similar lifestyles.  We don't have set raid times yet, because we're more so looking to develop the community first and enjoy the journey to 60 while balancing real life, but plan on structuring the raiding and World PvP / BGs once we get there depending on the schedules of those interested. 
---
Here's the link to the comment i posted below on the thread, let me know if you want to link up!

Boars
---
Actually wrong. Most recent rank up does not matter. And rockbiter is always more dps under all circumstances if you can stay on target.
---
WF is only good for PvP and because it’s more fun even when it’s worse.
---
just roll against them anyways and give it to them if you want.
---
Yeah I mean I played when vanilla was retail so I know what it was like.  That might partially be the reason why I don't see following a guide to be as important since I already have a general idea of what I'm going to do.  But people are losing it as if they wouldn't be able to figure out how to level without a guide.  It definitely isn't as mindless as it is now but it still wasn't that bad.  And even if you are having a hard time with questing then, especially early, just grinding whatever mobs you can find isn't actually even that bad of an option and can sometimes be optimal.
---
That's probably true, a lot of players probably use wowhead nowadays?
---
Yo me too!
---
IMO each player being limited to 1 skeleton is a cool change idk what u guys are on about
---
This place is absolutely huge
---
Warlocks dont need air
---
Beeg molten giant
---
I know we live in the era of free content and all, but if the guy wants to charge $ for his work then so be it. No need to hate on the guy, I would probably want to capitalize on it aswell.
---
If laughing my ass off and blasting him for being a dweeb counts as mad, yeah I guess.
---
Really? Damn so as a dwarf hunter I’ll need to make it over there somewhat early one way or another. Too many bows and not enough guns as quest rewards
---
Are we really going to become a toxic community over these minimal changes that have do nothing to actual gameplay?
---
We are working on implementing a save place and navigation feature for user convenience. It's currently in the works and should be live before Launch!
---
Man. You guys might enjoy pve, but of course those like pvp celebrate that behavior. It’s what spawns memories and hatred against other players. I for one prefer that over the exact same experience for every player just doing dungeons.
---
I want the world first Thex kill.
---
Not really no, they have one and they've been stressing how they wanna try and remain as true to the classic experience as they can with it still making sense. I don't believe dumping the amount of money it takes to develop a cinematic is worth it. As someone stated earlier I think the Chromie reveal cinematic was  plenty.
---
You could get full MC gear before even completing half of this absurdly rare pre-raid gear, 95% of people are going to be raiding in greens, this list is beyond useless.
---
Ah I see you are familiar with the Gadget and Bloodsail Buccaneers reputation system. As the player does one the other progressively adjusts.
---
My guild is going to have rag down in 2 weeks and naxx cleared the day of release... must suck to be a dad.
---
if you have skinning always be grinding on beasts, dragonkin
---
Fuck em, couldn't care less. Definitely not gnna rp in our capital for em.
---
The only way anyone is changing layers is if they have accepted a party invitation from someone on a different layer. How often will you or the other players in STV be doing that? I really dont see how this changes much at all, each layer will have plenty of players (that are ones on your server, not cross server players) for you to engage with.
---
Additionally even if people are accepting invites to another layer, they explained how there are delays for the layer hop in general, and the delay is increased when near PvP combat so people cant just vanish.
---
Your concerns come from a misunderstanding. Or perhaps you didnt actually fully read their AMA explanation.
---
Now, which one of those is the g-spot?
---
I know.  And it contained my quote from what I said in BG chat, "quit bitching and play".  Why are you continuing to argue?
---
Everyone will be able to pug everything just fine. Players are just to alot more boss mechanics than those who exists in Classic, but it will be fun nonetheless!
---
Skeletons are important. They let you know when you should tread lightly. I don't see why they can't just make the skeletons spawn like 5 yards away in a random direction.
---
It's constantly updated, has a good UI for checking off stuff, links to everything that is talked about, maps with arrows and numbers that relate to each step, and integrated class-specific guides. It's not just been sitting there un-touched for a decade.
---
This heartens me, somewhat.
---
Wow, detective by day, wow classic player by night!
---
Imagine knowing what phase you're in by the corpse placement.
---
But.. They are too big for being an ele shaman.
---
Casters Arent supposed to be big and strong, warriors are. 
---
I love tauren and their starting area, but because, i for some reason, cant have a big burly caster im going troll shaman... I think..
---
The best three solo classes are hunter, warlock and druid for sure.
---
Honest question, Why not just pay for Zygor? Are there any significant differences? I've used Zygor for years now and love it.
---
It is better, but [Turban](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22267/spellweavers-turban) will be added in Phase 5.
---
eyes dilating, mouth salivating
---
Meh just checkout older versions of the website.... can still see all the content free...
---
I see absolutely no reference or evidence to this. Blizzard removed skeletons from Chinese clients over a decade ago. Assuming troll post.
---
I assume your leveling a paladin correct?
---
Best ret paladin in the world
---
I've forgotten how much smaller it is.
---
There are definitely people who will do this to launder money from stolen cards. It happens in runescape, I'm sure that the same community will be looking to exploit WoW classic in the same way.
---
It might not be a huge amount but it'll be there.
---
Imagine not knowing every quest for both sides by heart
---
Played alliance first time around convinced them to roll Horde
---
Let me just enter shadow form and remind you I don't need to wear pants... to wear the pants.
---
Yeah i hear you. I am a little rusty on some stuff and I am starting horde after always playing alliance, but my main goal is going to be breaking ahead of the pack. Competing for kills is gonna be tough at the start.
---
Retail lol
---
Vanilla is raid or die.  You'll be able to buy a few decent pieces and get some others out of dungeons, but you'll still be at a HUGE disadvantage to those who raid in both PvE and PvP.
---
I remember the first time I let my little brother play my warrior (geared in BWL/AQ40 gear), he said it felt like a different game.  He played casually as a mage and never raided, imo it really was.  My rotation in PvP was generally charge healer -&gt; intimidating shout -&gt; heroic strike -&gt; spam execute **it dies**
---
Think of it like retail except there's only heroic dungeons and heroic raids.  As a raider I'll have double your HP, and more than double your damage.
---
Imagine paying for a guide...
---
There will be quite a revelation for you when holy paladins start rolling on cloth gear and warriors on leather and mail.
---
Nobody except the smallest minority will take offense in that.
---
Afterall Blizzard could've disabled cloth, leather and mail gear, but they didn't. I wonder why.
---
Pissed that I didn't reserve Crayola. I've never played an mmo where I had to play under a different name
---
My favourite is people saying they're going to level super fast.
---
No, you're going to level slightly faster than the people taking their time, and at an absolute snails pace compared to the people who are *actually* going to level fast. Because they've been min maxing quest progression for years and know zones like the back of their hand.
---
Then the group wipes and everyone whines at the healer.
---
All good, we're all hyped! We only have a few days left!
---
Lol you are right
---
I am assuming they did the math - but Ony and Rag down in week 1 just seems nearly impossible without account sharing for 25-40 with connection to a public server that may have queues/connection issues.
---
I honestly hate westfall and red ridge. I vastly prefer spending as much time in darkshore and ashenvale as much as possible before going to dusk wood (which is my favourite zone and almost enough to make me role alliance just by itself)
---
This is what worries me, people have gotten into the habit of rage quitting any group the moment it has trouble. Are people gonna realize that's not gonna work in vanilla?
---

---
The only way to grind to 60
---
Tanks are a lot less wanted for raiding (1MT 1OT rest OffSpec warriors) then during dungeons, so those wanted numbers will drop during raiding.
---
Healers on the other hand are always needed (between 6-12 per raid) so continuering raiding as a healer will be (way) easier compared to being a MT or OT..
---
[My reaction](https://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wtf_blazing_saddles.gif) seeing the pile of skeletons in Ironforge during the Bloodplague.
---
Kinda bummed we won't see those again, but I get it.
---
&gt; I will be using console port addon and play from couch using ps4 controller
---
You monster!
---
I plan to do what I always do when hitting end game in every MMO I've ever played.
---
1. Run the first raid with PUGs because I'm guild-less and/or my guild isn't quite ready to raid it yet.
---
2. Get quickly annoyed with PUG raiding.
---
3. Burn out completely and cancel my subscription to play whatever interesting new game recently came out.
---
I always imagine that THIS is going to be the time I'll stick with an MMO for months on end, but at the end of the day I've been gaming for 35 years. I love games, not just MMOs, and something will pull me away. I suppose I could find a group of people who were so magical and so entertaining and so beloved to me that I couldn't bear to be away from them and thus return frequently to bask in their presence, but I could hypothetically find a unicorn on my way to the grocery store, too. Odds seem stacked against it.
---
I learned that today lol
---
Are there any Alliance hubs that even come close to Revantusk?
---
So he didn't use the 10 minute cooldown more often. How sad? lol
---
I remind my gf in the daily that I will be locked in lolol
---
There are several subscription based guides that have been in existence for years: Zygor, Dugi, etc.
---
He isn’t Netflix, wtf does that even mean? 
---
Entitlement culture alert.
---
Congrats! Now you get to sit in Q for 8 hours looking at your name at launch!
---
Nothing funnier than a skinny troll wielding a 2H all hunch backed
---
Hunter - great survival with the pet
---
Mage - can conjure your own food/water
---
Rogue - sneak through encounters you wish to avoid
---
Second this, worth every penny, after pirating zygor for years.
---
or you Yoinked someones name while they were going back and customizing it ;P
---
Are you me?
---
Some are way more overpopulated than others though, so rolling on an especially busy server is still something to reconsider, to avoid the worst of the queues.
---
My second child was born yesterday so I'm gonna miss launch aswell as leveling at the pace of a geriatric snail but goddammit I'm gonna make it to 60 no matter what.
---
Nope :) just an old toon I couldn’t ever level
---
#somechanges
---
Very different.  
---
Look around for a guide.  A quick google search had a few:
---
https://odealo.com/articles/wow-classic-beginners-guide-tips-tricks-included
---
I dont think so, but i could be wrong. PvP in vanilla was very nitch based on your class. What i mean by this is not that you had to be "X" class to pvp - but each class had completely different play styles and things to watch for. Your best bet imo would be to figure out what class you want to pvp with and read some of the guides for that class. What you are asking for is not unheard of for wrath+ but vanilla was much less forgiving in pvp. Personally the only thing i didnt like about vanilla pvp was the fact that no amount of honor would help you against someone who end tier raided. Only the extremely skilled had a chance at killing a raid geared player without raiding themselves.   
---
I hope this doesn't discourage you from pvp on classic - it really is exhilarating and fun once you get the hang of it. Also not all geared players knew how to play back then ... now with the "other" servers a lot more people know what they are doing.
---
...cuz only vanilla retadin can be that dumb?
---
Not much hype around it, almost no guild recruitment thread on forums, many big guilds choosing other servers
---
Ahh, wait until BC drops and we all get to wear the clown suits again.
---
It'd be so awesome to watch live stream(s) of them running through old dungeons together. Could this become a thing? You could call it Delving with Devs.
---
Disagree completely. I like the new model animations they are much smoother.
---
Which means you can get Sidas bag from PvP?
---
You realize you're saying that in a subreddit about a game that runs on a subscription model?
---
humanoid mages are generally the best mobs to farm as they have the lowest hp and drop coins

You kid, but like having even like the starter zone stuff laid out is helpful.  Because even in like the starter zones the quest givers a spread between like 3 locations and you're returning to areas you've been to before so it's very nice to know which order to do the quests in.
---
I don't know why that's funny. He's not wrong. Mythic raids today are way more mechanically hard than anything in vanilla. Vanilla just takes a lot longer to get there and be good at.
---
mage will likely be very popular, easy raid spot is priest.
---
I think at this point people are just becoming so grateful it's actually happening (and soon) that there's more leniency.  Also there's plenty of QOL stuff from live that wasn't taken out where people are going "eh, actually i'm ok with that."

Felwood, cleansing one of those flowers!
---
I don’t know why the guy points out the obvious. Your post is spot on, there is actually something we can do. I wonder if lower pop servers will have layering removed earlier than the stuffed ones, or if they’ll forge it to be the same time across the board.
---
No it didn't 😂 Now I know for a fact that you're making it all up, because they don't give you the exact quote. 
---
That's why I was continuing to argue, because I knew you were lying, and now I got it confirmed, thanks.
---
Lack of skeletons is a nerf to undead players! Less spots to use cannibalize!
---
\#NoChanges means no racial nerfs!
---
I personally can not have an RPG experience in WoW with the homogenized classes and specs, speed of levelling turned up to 11, the distinct lack of identity in the zones. All of which are obviously personal opinions, which I forgot you can’t really have here.
---
&gt; Because impression rates and hover rates are paying him a livable wage. 
---
Well maybe not, but it is a combination of all the things I listed, we have to look at the whole of the advertising to get a true idea of the "wage." It is akin to saying to a fisherman, there is no way you can be living off of selling Trout alone, when he fishes for Salmon and Bass as well. His wages are based on his total "catch" not just the singular type of fish. 
---
&gt; What's your point? Mine is there's no way he's making anything off any ads he has on that website. 
---
My point is anyone with any ad sense would have built a proposal with historical visitation data as well as the expected influx to his website in order to form an upfront contract with advertisers. I do this for websites that get a 0.15% click-through rate and that's considered pretty good, found 1 of them at 0.50% which should make the advertiser ecstatic. Looking at a quite high-profile Journal's website atm on our Gmanager page that I do not manage personally atm, most have a click-through rate of under 0.10% which is a bit above our industry's standard. I cannot release how much this sale is worth but I can safely state that if he had designed a proposal and gone through it this way he could have made absolute bank while also not pissing a good chunk of the WoW player base. 
---
It would have taken him time, I understand that, my time doing it is the only reason I am paid.
---
* He could have reached out to other MMOs and gaming studios(You see the elsyweyr \[sp\] dragon game advertised everywhere) 
---
* Classic WoW Streamers (would be a great investment too, imo, to have your picture on the side of the most viewed guide website, sadly many streamers have little to no ad experience other than promoting things themselves),
---
* Any of the companies you get ads for on WoWhead (I do use ClassicDB to avoid the ads, so that is a point to be made on your behalf, would likely result in a bit less site traffic)
---
* Google ads (don't give them more impressions then you have too, they're the fill-gap ads)
---
* Nerdy shit (Mnt Dew, Energy drinks, Gaming mice/keyboards, PC builders/part sellers, *diapers*, ect)
---
* Medical advertising ("gamer drugs" like Adderall and Ritalin, vitamin and dietary supplements like Gfuel, and gym and exercise products)
---
* Services that WoW classic players would be likely to use (uber eats, grub hub, pizza hut, dominos.)
---
Sorry! about the absolute janky formatting, I wrote it as a couple of paragraphs first and decided to break it up to make it more reasonable, also had to write this 2x so far due to Reddit crashes &gt;.&lt;
---
EDIT 3x but I copied it this time first 
---
Tl:DR There were and maybe still are (very late to try this at this point) plenty of opportunities for him to advertise and make money off of it w/o destroying his relationship with a portion of the community impo. It would have cost him time and resources to do so, but in the end, he would have been more well off in a monetary sense and in a morally.
---
 Just feels like a gypsy who gives you a fortune w/o saying it costs anything then pressuring to pay after the "reading."

I really don't get why people don't understand it or make it this complicated. 
---
Say the concurrent player size for a server is 8k for example. That fills up, they open a new layer, another 8k can get on, and so on until it hits the Blizzard defined cap for number of layers. 
---
Its almost certainly a lower cap initially to have more starting areas. But that's just an example. 
---
Then when Blizzard decides they are done with layering, we only have 1 with a cap of 8k players. 
---
Anyone you see telling you layering doesn't effect queues is wrong. Once we are down to 1 layer the concurrent player cap will be significantly lower than it will be next week.
---
Haha I was in Lakeshire, working on I think the onyxia chain? I forget if thats the one but it was one of those long high level quest chains where you run around and talk to a lot of people, and so I dinged 60 in the Lakeshire town hall.

Yes! And then they migrated to play.net and they was a big fiasco.

In the launcher there is a dop-down where you can select the version of WoW you want to play. If you select classic it will have an install button if it is not already installed.

Just as melee leeway is larger on taurens will it be shorter on the reverse side as gnome , just curious if the scaling of leeway goes off size?

Delete them and remake them on the server you want

Underrated thread.

You got your wish mate.

Jesus, 6 days feels like forever ago in pre-launch wow time.

But joana has talked about a ingame addon. I guess thats out now.
---
Crescent Staff! Leggings of the Fang! Talbar Mantle! Venomstrike!
---
You're laughing but mythic raiding is one of the hardest content in any modern MMO.
---
Take Kil'jaden for example during legion only 30 or so guilds actually cleared him.
---
the next one
---
If you have 3 characters created, you will have to delete at least one to make a new character on a new server.
---
Teach them to fish. Offer to pay them a nickel a fish.
---
Holy shit, I forgot you didn't have to be max level to enter MC back in the day.
---
So true!
---
The fact that they actually had to write all that terrifies me.
---
How so? Sold content originally. Then for years had it available for free to general public. Then right before classic launches decides to relock it behind a pay wall since it's suddenly relevant again without updating anything on guide. Sure sounds like what I described. Doesn't matter anyways his guide is floating around there so just picked it up off there.
---
The dudes trying to pay for heart surgery so he can, ya know, LIVE. 
---
Buy the guide and STFU.
---
(OP Here) I agree with the consensus here so far, I feel like a good tank can usually manage the amount of damage they take in certain ways (pulling less, cc, potions); while a good healer usually ends up dead from pulling aggro off a bad tank. I guess a paladin may be the exception in 5 mans with ways to survive longer and being slightly less squishy.
---
I see swords at the top of legacyplayers. Can you link where you see daggers?
---
Ruined my experience, unsubbed…
---
Scroll wheel for mount and dismount, ctrl + Scroll wheel for camera zoom.... I love running a tsomeone on my mount flicking the wheel and stealthing. No dismount macro or addon needed
---
This being vanilla you could honestly start raiding MC in phase 6, and no doubt many will. Retail may be patch based but vanilla was not.
---
People like open world pvp, but not BG's, so you roll a pvp server.
---
&gt;As such Layering will work as a sort of bucket, where players not in the high density areas of the layer will instead drop into the bottom layer.
---
Nope, that's where you went wrong.
---
Layering does not care where you are in the world.

---
I mean, the thread about the tornado made sense cause he was streaming the classic run and had gotten some traction here from that, so it was basically just explaining why it was offline etc.
---
You'll be able to make up to 12 at launch I think, but it will definitely be more than 3 :)
---
!Remind me 4 days
---
Exactly. The guy spent his time and effort making this and wants to make a little money off it. How would people feel if they stopped getting paid for their work.
---
I generally agree with you, but you're assuming random sampling. There's a clear respondent bias here which is hard to account for, but still shouldn't undermine confidence to the point of calling the stats wrong, just wider error bars.
---
Eastern Plaguelands, farming Ghouls.
---
Yes, we can make more on launch.
---
3 chars is just for the pre-launch period. Keeps people from reserving dozens of names to sell.
---
The limit is lifted at launch
---
It depends on a lot of things, usually somewhere in the 55-60 range, basically you respec when you're ready to grind out dungeons.
---
Bingles lost tools, so bad quest on full server lol.

Because Joana only gives a shit about money. I understand how hard the guy works on his guides, but that's literally the only reason he does it. Not out of passion for the game or to help people, but to get money out of people. And he's been doing a great marketting campaign on the run up to Classic, honestly, he's been pretty genius about it all up until this point.

I still use mine every day on my PC that I play WoW on. The only thing is the in game integration has been removed from WoW so most of the buttons are not usable in game. But the mouse is big, heavy, and the finger rests on either side make this very comfortable to me.
---
Oh yeah, my mouse has lost some of the ["metal paint"](https://imgur.com/RD4gmN3) also.
---
I'm countering it with an increase in health pools for enemy mobs in raids, including bosses.
---
More debuffs just means more damage / dot stacking, the difficulty would stay roughly the same but the meta game would change is all...

"skeletons throughout the game world can lead to behavior such as  spelling out advertisements, hate speech, and other negative messages."
---
so they create all this layering technology, but can't figure out how to prevent skeletons from spelling shit out. quite disappointing from a 37 billion dollar company.
---
Damn yall are quick lol cheers everyone
---
I can't imagine how unfathomably cumbersome your ideology has to be, to request that a fantasy RPG has less corpses on the off chance someone uses them to make a symbol or word you don't like.
---
Considering you're making a bunch of of false statements about me which are pulled entirely from your own warped mind rather than anything I have said, pretty big.
---
I intend to play this as casually as I can, bumbling my way through the game, as literally anything else would just be exhausting to do with my schedule. Looking at everyone else on this board though talking about leveling guides and 18 hour play days and creaming themselves over stress tests.... jeeze guys. I seriously wonder just how many of you are going to burnout in the first few months once you realize it's meant to be an adventure, not a mad dash to the end.
---
10 characters per server, 50 characters max.
---
Amen dude. I don’t know where these absurd notions come from. Looking forward to the game coming out and the majority of ppl waking up.
---
LVL 58+ iirc
---
Just a note; Robe of Volatile Power is BIS for mages during AQ40 only. Replaced by Enigma Robe (drops from C'thun). Could be worth adding to the sheet.
---
 But you need the residence gear and the onyxia cloak. Which takes forever to get enough for a 40 man raid.
---
I’m leaning Druid because I’ve never tanked or healed and this would give me the flexibility to chose either. My friends are trying to convince me to chose between healing or tanking because druids are not good in vanilla. How much truth is there to this?
---
It really isn't that difficult. Lots of tank and spank with one or two mechanics for the most part. It's still a perfect raid to start out in though. BWL on the other hand is going to be hilarious. The only raid where Blizzard thought "Let's just have fun with this and fuck with the players a bit."
---
I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at Self-funded means  he doesn't charge at all for it. And unless he said "the money I'm making from twitch is going to be used to fund the guide and keep it free to the public," then it's your own fault for subbing with that pretense in mind. He charged for the guide in the past so it should logically follow that he will charge for it now.
---
I like both
---
That's only 2 bars in wow though, some classes can use more than double that in binds. how about consumables? are you going to have to bind them? how easy is it it to go through your bags? have you played any of the game yet, like the stress tests?.
---
How would stance swapping work on a controller, are you going to need a lot of modifier macros?.
---
I read you're planning on playing warrior, but most warriors are expected to tank at some points in raids, how viable is your tab targetting, or what if a single unit gets aggroed onto the healer, whats the pin point accuracy on targeting like? there's a few fights like first and last in BWL that are very targetting heavy on warriors and a lot of running around, but also the direction your character is facing as you run to pick up adds matters because mitigation doesn't work from behind.
---
Honestly, not trying to be a dick, I'm just genuinely fascinated by it all :) and very curious as to how it would work.
---
for solo play or group?
---
Solo is easily rogues - and they have a lot of short-ish cooldowns (sprint, blind, vanish).
---
Warrior isn't as difficult to play, but being good means having good gear (and a good healer behind you).
---
IF people dont mass die off (and thats a huge IF because its really easy to see that there will be tons of players trying it out and feeling its not for them, retail players perhaps) they have other measures in place to avoid having to continue with layering. Not only would they be willing to let queues be in place but they may also continue to open servers as they have been doing in response to the amount of players. They also brought up how they might offer free character transfer services.
---
But the main thing that this eases is because it addresses a lot of the negatives of layering while its implemented, all of those videos we would see posted of an empty city, or a player layering mid combat, or players layering to farm different nodes.. ETC. Its that sort of stuff that was well addressed and should ease someone.
---
PvE server for the shorter que times, if you have a limited play time.
---
Wish I still lived out there. ):
---
There were no real 10 mans in classic. A good player wearing pre-raid bis can do ok with pvp gear supplementing a few slots for the set bonus. Naxx wont be available for some time so its not like you will immediately hit a wall (outside of being out skilled which will get better with experience). 
---
TL/DR - The first few months you will probably be able to hold your own very well with decent 5 man gear. Later in the cycle - not so much
---
Yeah yeah. Everyone always claims they have a life to mask the fact that they are always online when their friends check their friend/guildlist. 
---
CAUGHT YOU. 
---
Grats on 60.
---
&gt; people don’t seem to realize how hard this game was.
---
Tedious and hard are two different things. The game isn't hard. The game *is* tedious.
---
For Edge? Probably over a million.
---
A M+10 usually a few hundred thousand.
---
This is all under the idea that you want to be raid healing and that's largely what you care about.
---
Remember this is classic and there is a life outside of raiding and while Druids suffer in raid healing they're amazing in many other aspects of the game.
---
basically moments like this would never become possible with a 1 skeleton per character system. People just wanna see cool moments like this again.
---
The Guild I'm planning on joining has a time horizon something like this: There's a Deadmines Guild run planned for about 2½ weeks after Classic Launch, with the expectation that we'll have enough members at 60 to get together with a couple other Guilds to run Molten Cores first one or two bosses, in about 2½ months.
---
&gt;at the mercy of the key holder
---
UBRS has enough loot in it (especially as a warrior, which I will be rolling) that it is definitely worth it to get the key.  The ubrs key really isn't that bad to get, just run LBRS a few times.
---
yea you are right about the double utility, but then again, the more I read about the healer classes, the more I kinda want to try that for classic, it's like coming from retail and almost exclusively playing DPS, I want to switch it up a little, but the game back than is so different that even DPS will be a new experience I guess. thanks for your input tho!
---
Clicking a mob and smashing the spell i've bound to 1. In this case for hunters the spell you bind to 1 is the Attack command for your pet
---
Those also make pennies, and are not reliable, and would incentivize him to break the guide into more pages, since you will be on each page for 6-12 hours, and only generate on click.
---
He has already said his procedure is 100% covered by his insurance.
---
My pve endgame plan outside of raiding is just farming dungeons for perBiS and leveling professions. Then I’m gonna lvl 9 Alta to 35 so I can get enough tailoring and alchemy skill to do transmutes/mooncloth for passive gold
---
Yeah I just feel like the first go round I pretty much lived in BGs for 3-4 months. Probably more than I was livingi. My own house!  i went to rank 11 with shamanand rank 14 with Rogue And my favorite thing to do on both toons was run flags, I always wanted to try Druid.... but those daggers on the rogue...hooooo boy....
---
Are they? Rogues don't seem to be insanely populated on private servers, is that what the early polls are suggesting?
---
Vael was a handful if your raid didn't understand to get clear to blow up and tanks couldn't get aggro for the cleave.
---
You can get weapon procs in lazerchicken form, so who even needs mana?
---
The guy made his guide free for all of beta for people to see whether it was worthwhile and that’s bad. 2019 hurts my brain.
---
I really agree with this comment, any good Creator nowadays that is putting out content has a page from you can support them at which as you said supports them in their future endeavors that you would most likely want to be a part of if the current Endeavor is worthwhile. I think maybe that goes to show how much content is creating and putting out over the course of a year. There may not be that much more content coming this might be it and this is his chance to make a bunch of money. Well more money since you already made money off of this guy back in the day like 1.8 million or some s***
---
There are answers.  Just use the search function, google, discord, youtube, literally anything.
---
Transmog was actually a really cool feature when it was first added because you couldn't solo stuff and got to do raids with people from your server. You also had to keep the gear in your bank which adds a little bit of effort to having that transmog, and you couldn't have every possible set at the same time.
---
I'm ok with that.
---
It's hard to take something off the internet.
---
Archives which index public websites have Joana's guide available. It's as simple as choosing "Cached" from beside a [joanasworld.com](https://joanasworld.com) search result from a popular search engine.
---
You can't actually "transfer" them. You have to delete one and attempt to re-make it on another server. It's not a transfer in that there is no guarantee you can keep the same name.
---
 wallpaper engine? What do I search for?
---
Huge mobs, lava surgers that did knock back, respawning core hound packs, just the whole thing was a sight to behold especially considering that beforehand only a boss was that large and rarely was any boss that large.
---
Couple this with having come from other MMOs like ff11 and UO it was really an experience
---
Just keep tooltips/tutorials on and make sure you read them.  You'll  be fine.

This is my issue. "But but but 75% of the playerbase will quit within a month, we don't want to be on a ghost server". So I guess I'll be a Herodbro like everyone else because wow without my friends would be way worse than a queue.

I plan to remote access my PC and start the queue before I leave work anyway. It won't be so bad.

"The chances that a Russian player, for example, that rolled on a Russian PvE realm to save only 2 characters on it, and 1 character on the Russian PvP realm or an EU EN PvE realm are virtually zero. First, that player clearly opted for his language realms, and secondly he is either a PvPer or a PvEer. With only 2 options, a Russian player that chose his native language realms, would almost 100% create all 3 characters on a single realm, PvE or PvP."
---
I'm an OCE player so I know language barrier isn't a problem when it comes to USA realms. Also, I haven't got my subscription yet because I don't really care about saving my name. I would like to point out that I considered pacific coast servers as an OCE player because the lag wouldn't be too bad and I really want to play on an RP realm. 
---
I think you saying "...would almost 100% create all 3 characters on a single realm..." is just wrong. I might be wrong saying this, but this sounds like an opinion of someone who has never lived outside of the USA, because as a non usa resident I would never take USA servers off my maybe list. All of my life I have had to use USA servers for most games and WoW is actually more forgivable when it comes to latency than other games. For me I am likely planning on having a character on the OCE servers for convenient time zones AND a RP character in a USA realm because that's what I want to play.

I guess my problem is that you said 'would almost 100%' and also 'virtually zero'. I think this opinion is wrong and should be rephrased to something else because as a non-usa resident  I would never say that playing on USA servers are off the table.
---
oh no, didnt even think about that lmao. do you have any insights for resto druids and raids?
---
and we gotta attempt to project for people who psychologically are like - well, im waiting till it launch, prob not gonna play, might poke my head in and not maintain a sub, which is just them kiddin themselves and they are gonna sub up and install it in the opening days after seeing hype / server stability / willpower struggle with the whole endeavor of acting like they don't care about it. lol
---
Why is it bad for someone to make money from the hard work they put into creating a guide?
---
I want to go orc warrior for this racial so bad but my fashionista self makes me roll tauren instead.
---
Hi, I’m looking to play mostly solo, with limited time and looking at either priest or mage (horde, UD).
---
I plan on spending a lot of time leveling, then mostly pvp (world and BG) with the occasional dungeon (probably no time to raid) and farming.
---
What do you think would be most fun ?
---
And they can probably forget about Alt Runs to get more Tranqs for their Hunters.
---
Oh and anklestabber for a gnome warrior on wifes sub lol
---
Don't hate on someone for wanting to get paid for their efforts.
---
Pay up or move on, it's that simple.
---
Hardcore? No. You need rank if they keep it pre 1.12 (which from what i have gathered seems to be the case) to buy the gear but the only thing that required real hardcore play was weapons and like 2 items if my memory serves me right. You have to focus heavily on pvp to get weapons - i remember that very well lol.
---
Class quests are mostly in the 10-20 range, from what I recall (Bear, Cure Poison, water form). Don't forget that you have Teleport: Moonglade as a Druid. As long as your HS is set somewhere close to where you're leveling, Druid is a class that won't have a huge issue getting to class quests no matter where they decide to level.
---
Right, I guess I meant are the exp gains and quests and stuff the same. Because I leveled enough toons to 60 that I don't feel the *need* for a guide **if** the set up is the same.
---
It's gonna be a clusterfuck on high pop servers again, isn't it?
---
&gt; When I played, getting an UBRS run together was an event and inevitably always included someone who needed to attune to Onyxia or wanted other items.
---
You are right on that.
---
On top of this, your group inevitably has other people competing for the same item
---
Yeah it’s done that since we first got to create characters lol
---
it doesn't show any accomplishment because anyone can go back and get that gear super easily
---
Hordebank and Twink? Sick names!
---
My hot take is that people were more angry over the fact that this part of Classic was being removed due to "potential abuse" rather than waiting and just banning a small minority of actual offenders post release. \*shrugs\*
---
Clearly we do! and so does blizzard employees
---
He had thought about donating $15 though, so he's a good guy. He didn't, but he thought about it! It's the thought that counts.
---
Sounds like someone got their account banned and is using a hacker as an excuse tbh.
---
Actually funny isn't it? Right now everyone probably cares about Balance. As soon as they play their first characters on 60 and see unbalance faction they're going to move just like on Retail Servers.
---
Systematically downvoting tattoos and art posts so this sub can remain a safe haven of memes and shitposts. It isn't much, but it's honest work.
---
Oh yea I thought it was a buy once thing. Subscribe to my guide? Lmao please don’t give booksellers ideas
---
I rather embrace it
---
Until ZG and AQ20 are both out people won’t likely be pugging too many raids, maybe some top guilds will pug for an alt run or something but it was with ZG that pugging raids really became a thing.
---
This actually inspires me to make some Classic WoW art while we wait (I'm also not an artist)
---
What’s a Kreiger?
---
If you all need a guide so bad, you can borrow my old Brady games official strategy guide.
---
that's the thing, you don't even have to do that. it's built into the UI
---
Those furbolg aren't going to grind themselves!
---
Isn't that against any Blizzard rules, and if so, wouldn't it be incredibly easy to ban him considering he's streaming it? Maybe I'm missing something.

---
Basically most of the raids on the first two pages. I think a lot of it is about player skill and cooldown management, ability to stay alive in every single fight, full consumables vs not, did your shaman or warrior die and you lost massive amounts of buffs or other such factors. Just from my point of view so far daggers has outperformed swords but i am not going to claim that they are outright better, i think there are a lot of other bigger factors that will determine your dps besides whether you play swords or daggers optimally.
---
If only hunters had a way of getting out of combat..
---
LFG channel was global.
---
Why do you hate lovely red cheeks?
---
It is better to have an advantage versus other classes, then in a duel versus one class that still ends up 50/50 just because of parry and dodge

LOL morons
---
Oh man I feel ya, at max I’ll have 2-3 hours a night to play, I feel like I’m gonna be able to do nothing but I’m playing all the same
---
It's gonna suck knowing that entire raids are passing you by in a different layer lol
---
NP. Good luck finding a guild.
---
The people who don’t want to pay money are the same people who pay money. Ya ok
---
You aint getting it outta me!
---
A healer would round that out nicely.
---
Probably mage. It’ll handle all the things you want, has a low floor but high ceiling. Also, it is vastly easier to level as than priest, which will be important for you if you have limited play time.
---
I am! Never played Tauren and never leveled in Mulgore im excited!
---
Lolol still counts
---
Both are strong. Hunters will be stronger at things that involve killing mobs (such as devilsaurs, Mara runs, or DM tribute runs), and rogues will be stronger at things that involve avoiding mobs, such as hunting for black lotus (herbalism)
---
Look on the classic discord LFG page, the weekly guild recruitment threads (if they still do them I haven't been paying attention) or the server specific subreddits. This isn't the right place for it.
---
I totally agree its against terms of service, but I'm more in favor of the massive real world implications it has for people to buy and sell gold. 
---
OSRS currency allows people in Venezuela to be able to eat and live because gold farming makes more than majority of there jobs down there. 
---
Capitalism plain and simple and I am all for it.
---
This guide recommends dungeons at the proper time and helps you pick up most of the quests: https://classicwow.live/leveling
---
&gt; The Stress Test was also free for a while
---
That is categorically false.
---
The part about the first gryphon ride couldn't have been more accurate to my experience. I remember seeing one fly by and I was in awe. On my first ride I couldn't believe it. It was amazing.
---
Oh it was called last stand wasn’t it lol. Yeah mb
---
Oh god lol not looking forward to 3rd year. Well maybe nows not the best time for you to start playing, but maybe during a rotation with an easier schedule
---
A lot of people on Reddit say these exact things, so it’s kind of hard to tell
---
After having farmed it for so long a lot of people tend to zone out and just /follow someone of their class until a boss. Since almost everyone was well feared nobody really knew is a hunter went afk on trash
---
by default it will say resist on your character portrait, but various scrolling combat addons show not only your own attacks, but your opponents too, and there will be a nice Resist pop up when that happens. 
---
But.. you don't know if it was your racial or that base 5% that did it :D
---
&gt;  Averaging 3h sleep per night you're gonna end up with 27 hours to do the attunement.
---
More realistically, you have someone else level your character while you sleep.
---
I'm honestly not trolling for reactions I think you should read more of the posts on this thread to understand where I'm coming from my reaction was a little harsh but I was being honest. I was hoping you were going to say you were just trolling.
---
I think you might need to re-read the AMA for the finer points of how layering works. Yes, server capacity is going to play a big role (especially when it comes to authenticity) in the long term and you're right to be concerned they are setting it too high - although we don't have actual numbers yet. However, in the short term, they will be phasing out layering *fast*. This means that after the first week or two of launch hype dies down, queues will start to really hurt.
---
If you care about guides you obviously trying to optimize your time spending. That's my basis.
---
Why would that be the case?
---
I picked stalagg a few days ago because it looked to be one of the lower pop servers... yikes
---
I played Vanilla back in the days and were lucky to be among those who cleared Naxx. I have absolutly no intention of playing like i did then, the amount of time i put down is not something i wanna do again.
---
FYI "5 person dungeons" fits the syllable cadence much better.
---
Thanks ! I’ve mostly been a priest, though played mage for very late vanilla and early TBC
---
They said that all loot tables are 1.9 until AQ. Meaning that phase 1 and phase 2 bis are the same.
---
Feral druids are viable, more as a tank than DPS. But when offtanking you will get to dps anyway, and the melee groups will love you for the crit aura.
---
Now that's how you troll!
---
if I was to give this a name, I would say it is an 8 year old painted a version of Ragnaroc in MC
---
Are you sure about that? I think that shamans can do totem quest in orc or in tauren home. Or even both quests and keep both totems.
---
You dont even need 'console' afaik....at least not on retail.
---
Im actually not even sure you need 'ui', i just still type it out of habit.
---
Yes, we can all use the snip tool and paste things together in a paint image and upload it.
---
Why don't you just like the site you're pulling this from and cut out the middle man.
---
Can we not do catch-up gear?  Maybe I have been gone too long but that is the main reason I left.  Making all your time and effort on raiding epics meaningless.

But why?

---
I'm pretty sure that for most of the game (getting to 60), mage gear IS warlock gear, which will likely get contested also by priests, druids, and even paladins/shamans for healing gear. Level 60 instances and raids are different, and mages and warlocks are both popular classes.
---
&gt;Warlock would also give me the ability to solo more content
---
Yes, but this is very limited content. The difficulty of vanilla wow was quite high, so even a lot of world quests required (or made quite efficient) with groups, even small groups.
---
Thanks for the sweet new [phone background](https://i.imgur.com/y5rXMq3.jpg). Hope you don't mind!
---
GMs HATE him!
---
Would be more useful if you said what the notable items are for people who dont have dual monitors or just arnt keen on taking their eyes off the screen. For the specifically located ones I'd tell people the co-ords verbally. You dont really want blank air that makes people look to see if the video stopped
---
On one hand I'm worried about the future of our server (long term) but on the other I feel like we have it perfect for launch.
---
subscription models are 100% conscious and exploit the fact that many people forget to cancel them...
---
imo, auto renewing subscriptions should be illegal to be a default option for this reason. it should be required that the user changes a setting for it manually.
---
Digging through somebody's post history just shows that you don't have a strong argument and want to fall back on ad hominem attacks.
---
Who cares
---
I wouldn't recommend it to be honest. Tank warriors are often the raid leaders and/or need a lot of experience. (which you admittedly don't have yet)
---
If the idea of tanking sounds fun, I'd recommend playing prot paladin. It's an excellent offtank class, leveling is fun, great against large groups of mobs and you even get a free mount at 40. It also works as main tank in dungeons and smaller group play.
---
Ah I confused you with another poster.
---
Whats the name? I just got Stealthy for my last night lol.
---
The last phase technically has no end point. 
---
I know I’ll never clear naxx so I want TBC
---
Perhaps if smooth brained redditors stopped posting shit about him every time he touches a keyboard he would fade away into irrelevance. Instead he gets more publicity/clicks/likes/shares/donations for the added exposure.
---
What is the best class to play when you're going to be solo for the most part leveling while catching up to friends that are taking off weeks to play?
---
And before he MTed Naxx he was off tank number 4. Druids dont compete for warrior loot so gearing one up is pretty doable. Only thing bears do better is threat after AQ and only the hardcore crowd cares about that.
---
It's not ready for launch because he hired a programmer, and then got ghosted by said programmer.
---
I've been wondering if there was a nerfed version of MC I wasn't aware of. In 2005 MC was a pretty extreme gear check, unless you were an alt being carried by a t2-t3 squad.
---
I will never understand why people unbind A/D instead of rebinding strafe to A/D. That just feel way too weird for me, but I get that it's all personal preference.
---
I suffered through leveling a priest and running around vanilla as a healer, I'm not sure I want to repeat that on a pvp server again.
---
I don't think it's 100%, but I know for a fact that this is the case for that hunter quest.
---
and  then again, you can use free resources
---
I'm gunna run to orgrimmar and be the first pvp kill on the server!
---
Not flooded because of the Phase 1 layering :]
---
Weaslelord is right, feral druid can tank dungeons and offtank raids and can do well in battlegrounds.
---
Most people rebind a and d to be strafe and use the mouse to look around. Then you can use q e and shift + q or e for more abilities.
---
If Blizzard is doing this for the sole reason of players writing messages, they are still able to do so with characters too. Players did it all the time in the Beta. It's silly to remove a huge aspect of vanilla because of a small majority of incidents. During my entire time of playing vanilla I only saw this in a couple of instances. If it's really a huge problem limit players under level 20 to 1 skeleton and in major cities. Problem pretty much solved.
---
Real men tank that shit not running around like some priests.
---
I watch videos while leveling mostly.  Audio isn't a big thing for me.
---
I'll pay it too. He already gets my twitch primes but still 5 bucks is chump change.
---
yea right, no proof anywhere
---
Hell yeah! I'm aiming for tier 0.
---
Tarren Mill and South Shore, of course.  No, it's not a geological chokepoint, but it's definitely a chokepoint in terms of questing.
---
You still going to play Classic, right?
---
Yeah I'll never understand how people comfortably use those mice. I use mouse buttons for one offs cooldowns or mobility skills etc.
---
Are you reading these posts?
---
People are mad because they feel deceived.
---
There is a clear difference with phase 1 and 2, and it's the honor system and pvp rewards. Some pvp rewards will be raid bis in phase 2 however, that can't be the case in phase 1 so... what is instead?
---
Yeah but you bind everything to a number and press it. Perhaps games where you press a button is not your thing ?
---
/r/Classicwowplus
---
You are literally missing the point, not all questions are asked because the asker only wants an answer
---
The world is still the main character. Just in a different sense. Now azeroth is the last Titan that is the root cause of all the world's problems! Or something.
---
I feel like a lot of these people are going to quit Classic as soon as they hit 60 or whatever the goal is. A few are real Classic fans, but the rest can gtfo as far as I'm concerned.
---
They already all quit except for a few.
---
One of the issues he has was not keeping the guide paid like Zygor. He offered the guide for free for years and hasn't updated it in an extended time and now takes it away to put it back behind a paywall with no updates or the in-game addon he was talking about having. It will leave a sour taste in people's mouths.
---
Now if he put in new work to correct the route, added variations for the different classes and had the guide show up with in-game Addons people would probably been more ok with it.
---
Yes, they could call the runes glyphs.
---
would also like to know this!
---
Druids have one of the most versatile healing specs in Heart of the Wild. You're nearly full feral but have some buffed healing, mana regeneration, and NS from the resto tree. Full resto still has solid damage potential as you can still do the basic pounce -&gt; rake -&gt; rip -&gt; IS -&gt; MF rotation putting 5 dots on somebody before they can even respond. And then at higher levels of gear Nature's Grace builds bring a lot of punch and some of the highest healing / sec in the game, at the cost of being very mana intensive. Everything else you said is true, but I wouldn't write druid off.
---
I would be careful on shaman though. Many raid groups will require mana tide at least during progression, and that deep of resto is poor in the rest of the game.
---
Invoking Poe's law is too easy lately.
---
Nessingwary's in STV, another questing chokepoint.
---
I don't get it.
---
Stuff like this makes it really hard to decide between priest and warlock... :(
---
Oh, I have no doubt it'll be there before launch.
---
Get a mouse with 12 buttons on the side and left/right flick of the mouse wheel as buttons too.
---
Rebind left and right flick to shift and control and never have to worry about keyboard binds ever again. 
---
You can be a lot more responsive this way
---
Then don’t subscribe...
---
Yea I’d agree it’s not terribly difficult to get. Though, I’d say a few is a low end estimate and usually ends up being a bit more unless you’re reserving the seals or doing guild runs.
---
It is, given that it didn't exist in vanilla
---
yeah, I guess it is technically true. I don't think it should be as "respected" as it is anymore though
---
there's a sub for everything lol
---
Ask her if its weird your playing female toons to date guild leaders
---
Its pretty easy to pick up a few pieces of defense gear along your way even as fury and throw that on with whatever plate dps gear you have. It makes a big difference between trying to sit there with full dps leather gear where many of the items have 0 stamina at all. Sure maybe its not as big of a factor in dungeons but if you are going to offtank some stuff in raids you are really doing your raid and your healers a disservice.
---
40&amp; under , pls check id ...wtf ???
---
We talking Naxx BiS?  Probably more like 15.  If you are pre-raid BiS and know what you’re doing it’s probably 30 or a bit over.  I don’t think people realize just how much dead weight existed in beginner MC back in the day.
---
it's unreasonable and silly to change things just because of minor issues
---
*Tin foil hat on*
---
There is another, *primary* reason that Blizzard is making this change. Because the reason they provided us just doesn’t make sense. 
---
In other posts in the AMA they reconfirmed their commitment to #nochanges. Why take a stand here, when the reason they gave is not only done by skeletons but also unreleased corpses?
---
My two current theories are either it has something to do with the Chinese market and them not allowing or liking visible bones or because it causes additional strain on their servers which they’re already doing everything they can to cut costs for.
---
Yes, I see that.
---
But why? What was the purpose of that? You could have just said no and not wasted their time. 10g is nothing, all you did was make yourself look like a dick and make some random noob happy for about 3 minutes while he was skipping over to IF, and then made him upset.
---
People like you suck dude.
---
Not written by melderon. 
---
Is the result of thousands of hours just like Joana. Yeah, Joana’s has been under development for longer, but you can’t compare effort in that way. 
---
Individual class guides are far *more* detailed and heavily routed. Joana’s guide didn’t have data for some classes completed. Additionally, the routing didn’t change based on class. Rather, class would add extra steps. The entire thing is based on hunter, which means following it as say a warrior will require heavy modification to be optimal.
---
Everyone in Louisiana is rolling Blaumeux
---
Yeah as a warlock you're basically competing with mages for all the same gear anyways minus a few niche pieces. Mages are also insanely good at soloing content due to the level of control they bring.
---
This is the classic wow reddit, anything can happen baby
---
Lucky you! Thanks for the reply anyhow :)
---
Oh you definitely inspected them to see what stuff they had on outside of the obvious(helm, shoulders, chest, pants, and weapons).
---
I agree with most points except for transmog. I don't expect them to put it into Vanilla WoW, nor do I want them to, but it does a LOT to make everyone look varied and unique. In Classic WoW, everyone's essentially going to look exactly the same. That can be useful, because at a glance you'll know exactly what raids they've done and how far along they are, but it does take away a lot of the player customization.
---
This kind of thing really only makes a noticeable difference from like level 30 or 40 on, not at level 10.
---
Wait what? Is that even possible?
---
This works especially well if you play a hunter. THen even a small child can handle it.
---
Hunter, so she isn't always waiting for you to catch up.
---
Not just my opinion, a lot share it. This is like having a time machine then bragging that you knew something first. It's already happened, it isn't a first anymore. 15 years of theorycrafting and private serve use has taken all of the meaning out of it. 
---
Especially since the game is going to live in this state forever. People better have fun rushing to world "second" because they wont have much to do after they have everything on farm a week after phase release.
---
Hahahaha, more like.3%
---
Two Factions Fighting is much better, yeah
---
1-12 is free, for all zones.
---
Maker of this guide just wants Darkshore all to himself!
---
If you have rogue, druid is a very fun combo for dual stealth.
---
Not at all, especially if the change is so incredibly insignificant to the overall game experience and in some ways even an improvement.
---
U don't do that here
---
This.they disappear right away now showing great battles
---
This is even more helpful, thank you!
---
What makes you so certain? As recently as the last stress test layering was working differently to how they claimed in the AMA it will work. People were changing layers on zone changes which they explicitly said wouldn't happen. And that's not a case of "left it turned way up to test" - that's a case of it actually working in a way they explicitly said it wouldn't.
---
There's no reason to think layering will work as advertised. We can hope it will though.
---
Not really, no.
---

Piracy. The word you're looking for is piracy.

If you're going to use the argument that it's possible to get around the subscription, it's not much more of a leap to say it's also possible to get the whole thing for free period.
---
I know I do because I tried private server and I loved it.
---
&gt; Every time, I get my ass kicked
---
Not enough memory to make a long game, so you had to make super hard games lol
---
Haha yeah that's smart imo.
---
Yes and no. While it won't be terribly hard for you there are a lot of QOL improvements you got to experience in Wrath that did not exist in Vanilla. You'll get the hang of it within a day or so of playing :)
---
Yeah exactly. I see a contingent of people that claim that the human zones are the reason Alliance early zones are 'infinitely better'. I like them, but Horde zones speak to me.  
---
I'm over here thinking 'that's like your opinion man.'
---
In terms of heal per sec, they are behind. That being said, they are much needed for their buffs, hots and combat res ability. Oh, and innervate too! Not sure about exact numbers but i imagine most guilds bringing 2-3 resto druids to raids. Haven't played druid in vanilla raids so that's about all i can say about them. Someone else might add something.
---
If this is the only thing you have to bitch about, then they did a damn good job with Classic.
---
even at 400 runs you were lucky, the records showed that in the duration of the realm there were in excess of 9000 instances of stratholme run, however there is no actual data stored on the number of attempts on the baron himself
---
Not saying it's hard or anything there bud, just stating I'll enjoy the game with goals to match the time I have to put into the game. Anything else you take from that is on you.
---
I think they're just very efficient and steady.
---
I mean I started on day one of release in '04 and I doubt I would've noticed they reduced the skeleton count if reddit hadn't called it out.
---
Yeah, that's what I've been thinking. Orc seems good in PvE and PvP, while undead seems good only in PvP. Thanks for the reply!
---
Problem with that line of reasoning is it's not one SP per raid, it's one epically freaking hardcore SP per raid. A guild won't carry two SPs since you don't want them to show up at the same time, but you always want 1 there, so whoever the SP is is gonna need about 100% raid attendance or they're gonna lose the slot.
---
Sometimes the small things do matter.
---
How much time has passed in game between the first instance of the scourge and the start of vanilla? How much time since Sylvannas broke away with the Forsaken?
---
No, what I'm saying is layering has nothing to do with queues. The server has a cap on how many people can enter it, regardless of if there is layering or not. 
---
Layering is in the game to prevent the mass quantities of people in one area ruining the game. Not control realm population overall.
---
At least that's how I understand it and have had it explained.
---

I really don’t want to be going to one area to update a quest, then have to go back to the same place to update another quest that I could have held off on had I known I could group all my stuff in that area such that I take fewer trips. It feels like a waste of time, and time is important to me. I plan on taking several months to get to 60, I don’t want it to be a year.
---
It should work on your phone too. Not the most comfortable setup, but better than alt-tabbing. If you supplement it with an addon like questie, you won't even need to look at the map that much.
---
never seen a group of grown men get their panties in such a bunch over $5 lmfao
---
As far as I'm concerned if anyone is ever downloaded a song or a movie for free you are a hypocrite for saying anyting about obtaining this guide for free.
---
Did you happen to play on K2 a couple years back?
---
I just went back after posting and saw, all good appreciate it tho!
---
I don't get it?  People who don't want layering are idiots now because?  Layering is still going to be in the game... it's not like blizzard said "well, never mind" and removed it...  regardless of what side of the argument you're on, nothing has changed.
---
oh no someone is disagreeing with blizzard!
---
Is it the same for the Alliance?
---
Even if very assumptive, we achieve a reasonable result. Even if you're off 500k that's already a good start.
---
I feel like they did this on purpose to prevent most players from no lifing the first week lmao
---
He has every tight to demand cash for the work he put in. Don't like it, don't pay him.
---
&gt;the classic community hates your guts
---
The majority of the classic community couldn't give less of a fuck.
---
Make sure to follow Tipsout guide so you don't get lost
---
This is very true. Vanilla was before Blizzard merged with Activision, and wasn't so interested in figuring out how to nickel and dime their players. It's going to be kind of bitter to play Classic, remembering a time when Blizzard actually gave a shit about their fans, and not just their fan's money.
---
I have been a Tauren Druid since i started, in Wrath. I love everything about Druid lore, and everything about Tauren lore. I'm beyond excited to experience the good(ish) old days, in Classic!        
---
I have baby #1 on the way, so my play time will be super limited... but i'll still be around tossing out Healing Touches, Rejuves, and Marks of the Wild on the Mankrik server whenever i get the chance :)        
---
...I also created a Tauren Shaman, to be an alt. I replayed WC3 in the run up to Classic, and this alt was totally inspired by how much i enjoyed the Tauren Spirit Walkers!
---
It’s ok my president is an emoji
---
PVE servers won't overfill. No worries on that front.
---
Why? That's the magic of classic. You can acquire, buy or craft other meaningful stuff to help you on your journey.
---
Twitch streams are shitbags too.
---
&gt;3. If there’s demand then new raids and experiences beyond AQ and Naxx 
---
What would be the reward?? Tier 3 already makes you a God among other players.
---
That still isn't really relevant to what he's telling you though. There is a cost to not using this sign to advertise something you will get paid for.
---
I still don't think more Scandinavians will be there compared to Gehennas.
---
I love warlock, but honestly I'd put both mage and rogue at higher skill ceilings. Warlock mobility is shit where mages and rogues have many more options for getting around. Warlock can feel very turret-like.
---
One benefit is getting reputation with a different faction, for example on a private server I leveled my human warrior by doing as many quests flagged with Darnassus reputation rewards at the appropriate level for maximum rep per quest. I followed a route for this and was able to hit exalted by level 40 and have my choice of a tiger mounts in addition to the normally available horse mounts. For the most part just stick to your zone because the difference in leveling speed is offset by travel time for the most part.
---
&gt;didn’t play warlock
---
Well, *somebody* had to pull and all the warlocks just sitting there with no way to dump aggro. Good thing I was invited along for ports and food, right?
---
If my toon's model *had* eyes, I would be rolling them so hard.
---
&gt;I hope an entirely new one.  Alternate universe type stuff is not exactly out of character for Warcraft lore.  Let's see a reality the Bronze Dragonflight spoke of where Garrosh Hellscream was a hero, rather than wasted potential.
---
Whose Garrosh? ^/s 
---
But on a serious note, there is no Garrosh. He first showed up in Nagrand, he was on the Outland side of the Dark Portal before Wrath.
---
Yes, the flight from orgrimmar to gadgetzan is very lengthy.
---
jpegs you can hear ...
---
**Cooooolicereeeeee; Coa Praesto Matuereeeeee!**
---
I get why most people don’t want to play on it, but I’ll probably be playing on Faerlina. I feel like the “streamer realm” is just going to be more interesting long-term. Especially considering the thing I care about most in the game is world PVP (and BGs to a lesser extent). But we’ll see what happens. I’ve got my name reserved on a few realms just in case it’s too annoying.
---
Yeah, I did that no life shit when I was a teenager. This time around is going to be nice and slow with plenty of time for other shit that actually matters.
---
Last week they made conspiracy theories about layering repeatedly, now they pretend to give a shit about skeletons. There are some truly pathetic people on here.
---
I honestly don't remember as I had a few 60's... My first was a Nelf Druid, and I think it was either in EPL or a dungeon since back then people would bring 10 mans to Scholo ad Strath, so a 58-59 side healer (although I was a balance idiot back when Typhoon was the final skill) wasn't out of the question.
---
Where?
---
Completely different game with a completely different focus and all
---
He Just be trollin ya  mom
---
It's $5 and you can buy, refund and download the content if you want. It's such a tiny amount of money I can't believe this thread is on the front page.
---
Imagine being so desperate to warp the argument that you have to describe $5 as "infinity percent."
---
Thank you for sharing that, I really enjoyed it. It's cool to see the original developers are as hyped about classic as everyone else!
---
I run a business and I do very well for myself.
---
You see smart people tend to operate on principles. Dumb people can't critically think so they come up with things like "stop being poor", while they knowingly have a bunch of debt and the person they're talking to has money in the bank. Kind of funny actually.
---
You are incorrect. Blizzard has stated many times that layering allows them to increase the number of people on each server (which is the reason a "medium" pop realm right now is bigger than any vanilla server ever was.) 
---
Layering actually allows them to have an *unlimited* number of people online on a server. They have stated that they are artificially putting in a queue to discourage people from all being on one server so that they will transfer and allow layering to eventually be removed.
---
There’s an episode of how I met your mother where people break news to each other about major flaws of people they love and the glass shattering noise plays...that just happened to me so thanks for that! To be fair I stopped watching him since he got into beta months ago
---
Don't feel sorry for him, he's been milking this for a long time. He has a twitch channel with hundreds of subs, hundreds of patreon subs and a donation button on his website. This is purely a way to make even more money off the ample of money he's already made.
---
Very neat I’d say. I very much enjoy being able to click on an item and get a wowhead link to know where I can get it, unlike the spread-sheets I’ve encountered in the past where a ton of copy-n-paste action is required.
---
It would be nice with a list of recommended enchants, but hey, it’s neat I must say.
---
Yes. Have a fort and a renew on me and a pocket healer complete with bubble and dispels
---
No way. Melee DPS sharing the same Loot table? Crazy days.
---
Honestly I dont see how this guy thinks hes gonna make money paywalling his content. People are just going to use another one of the free guides, many of which are plagiarized off of his work.
---
He would have made a lot more money just putting up a patreon link, like sure tons of people would freeload but at least then he'd get \*something\* rather than nothing.
---
&gt; but when a boss drops 2-3 pieces of gear for a 40-man raid
---
yea there will be loot drama
---
and the main tank could leave the guild and then it could fall apart
---
and then u walk into a new guild where u start from 0 dkp and it's gonna be another month until you win an item
---
Dwarf pve ret pally, biggest brain play.
---
haaha cold blooded, but true.
---
Is there a Horde version?
---
The answer is yes. Everybody always starts STV with the best of intention, but after getting ganked 50 times, when you see someone weaker... you wont have the fortitude to resist
---
There is no argument to be had. The guy did not make any valid points. He is ignorant of the whole situation so any points he made were incorrect from the start. Joana mentioned he would have a premium service coming out before classic months back. Please point out a point he made in his comment that you need a rebuttal to. If you look at his other comments on this thread you can see his goal is to be a toxic downer. He is projecting his internal hate outwards and I just wanted to find out why. Looking into him more revealed that clearly.
---
He has been paid he's continually being paid I don't understand why people think of this $5 per sub is the first money he's seeing for his work. He's made lots of money off of his work he's done very well for himself.
---
Hi, /u/payne4218
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctkwu6/cant_decide_between_healing_or_dps/). 
---
He sold his guide in vanilla era and (iirc) made over a million dollars from it. When vanilla ended, he stopped playing, so he made his guide free since he didn’t care anymore. Now that classic is coming back, he wants to sell it again
---
1 hour a day on weekdays and 8 hours across the whole of the weekend?  
---
Raiding isn't in your future. I am sorry, but 1 hour a day is just enough time to run one five man and do general character maintenance (repairs, reagents, post stuff on AH ect).  
---
Raiding will require at least an hour each weekday just farming your consumables for raiding. Let alone the fact you habe to have somewhat decent blues plus resist gear. You can't get all that done spending 1 hour a day.  
---
Raids themselves can go for 8 hours easily, particularly for guild progression. If you can only spare 8 hours over the entire weekend, then you should temper your expectations right now because no guild in their right mind are going to take you until a given raid is on farm status and people have got wvwrything they need and willing to carry a coyple casuals through.  
---
And that's what that kind of playtime amounts to. You are super casual, and raiding with you would be like trying to run a mile with a barbell around your neck. Sure it can be done, but it's hard.  
---
That said, if you play a healer your chances increase tenfold. If you are a tank you might be considered as off tank in a raid, thus giving you a better chance.  
---
As DPS you could spend an hour just trying to find a group for a 5 man dungeon. As healer or tank you will find groups almost instantly. With only an hour a day, you might want to consider one of these roles if hope to even have any 5 man progression let alone raiding.  
---
If you still want to play DPS, you should just forget about raiding right now and plan your playtime around PvP on weekdays and 5 mans on weekends or something to get the gear you want.  
---
When ZG releases you might have the gear needed to do the 20 man, maybe.
---
No, I'm not gonna be arsed to dig through Wayback Machine archives full of deleted Photobucket and Flickr images to find screenshots from fifteen years ago to prove a point to a random Internet stranger.
---
Think whatever you want, bud, it's no skin off my back.

This is the real solution

You should do a TED talk on how to be a successful businessman that gets butthurt over $5.

Locking content behind a blizzard game is against TOS, going to report him
---
Had a guy miss the jump on a pserver run the other day...and he didn't know his way around and got lost. Felt like 2006 all over again &gt;.&lt;
---
Unfortunate that Joana has chosen to go this route. Was planning on using it. Now I'm not going to. Nothing bad towards the guy, he did a ton of work but I don't agree with the model. I'll just find another.  
---
Also, isn't it a bit of a grey area legally to ask people to pay for something extra that has to do with another product? Just guessing he might be in for more than it's actually worth trying to put a price tag on something affiliated with another company's product.
---
My only goal is to hit 60 before phase 2 or at least before most of the population so I can gank and annoy people.
---
imagine having thousands of hours trying to make updated guides and getting banned 5 days until release cause tos
---
Thanks for this.
---
If you are a meme spec like enhance, ret, or feral dps it will seem unfair cause you will be ignored till every other dps on your gear list will get priority.
---
I would use https://allyroute.com/ for alliance, its a similar guide and its FREE, just the way it should be.
---
You are only allowed to use a trackpad for PVP if your name is "trackpad".
---
Mice are cheap. I mean you say you are good with a track pad - you do you man, but for most people mice make it a lot easier.
---
&gt; Shaman seems way more fun with a much broader toolkit
---
Do you want to be pretty good at a few things, or really good at one thing?
---
Mages also have the ability to teleport around the world, make free food/water. 
---
Shamans can self-resurrect, and if you don't mind switching roles, can more easily get a dungeon group.
---
Your title sounds salty and thats really unfair for everyone involved. Joana is the best and has earned his right to charge. He has an unspeakable amount of hours practicing this stuff, this is a really good opportunity to make some money off it. If you cant afford it, your probably a kid or lack respect.
---
did you literally take a screenshot of an AMA in /r/classicwow and post it to /r/classicwow?
---
It would be a lot more damage. Not twice the DPS but there's quite a few abilities and even talents that you avoid using because of the limit.
---
Meanwhile I've mained dwarves since wotlk, happy to see more dwarves in classic :-)
---
I can't imagine how unfathomably cumbersome your ideology has to be, to request that a fantasy RPG has skeletons in the off chance someone needs them for aesthetic reasons.
---
Considering you're making a bunch of of false statements about him which are pulled entirely from your own warped mind rather than anything he have said, pretty big.
---
Balance isn’t really a viable class if you are trying to hit the meters. You can wear any armour type that has the best stats/spell damage.
---
Because I won’t have time to catch up rather get there once
---
So I can run to him as soon as I spawn as an orc all the way to the taurens  and not miss of the quests hes doing. What about class trainers? will I be able to level my skills still or can that only be done by the orcs.
---
&gt;The LGBTQ+ community is intending to play on Thalnos (ET - PvP)
---
Lol, what? The LGBTQ+ community is not an organized group playing together. I highly doubt there will be any more focus on Thalnos than any other server.
---
Yeah he sure showed him!
---
I'm stuck between a mage and a holy priest. I love the leveling of the mage, all the cc, the great damage, the portals but I'm super interested in healing and actually being someone that is needed for raids. Healers are always in need and would be fun to be one, but the leveling seems rough and at 60 I don't want to have to be swapping specs every day just to go solo farm for gold. Is anyone else in this boat? Mages seem more self sufficient but being a healer and being needed for raids is equally appealing.
---
big issue, game breaking
---
I went back to read through the thread you linked. Most people are saying wow was made to be casual friendly. But also had hardcore features, to appeal to both types of gamers. 
---
There are lists of the most hardcore games these are games that combine all the factors identified with being hardcore. Difficulty, and time investment required make up the biggest factors. There however is no clear definition of what makes something hardcore.
---
Point to where said classic was hardcore. I said it was harder than retail WoW. Which it is. It having hardcore elements doesn't make the whole game hardcore. 
---
The only mystery is your mental gymnastics in this fairly pointless argument.
---
"Activate hero shield!"
---
So much for the "difficulty" maybe stay on retail. Those add-on weren't possible with the old api
---
Man I loved watching that! Can NOT wait!
---
yes. please refrain, this is so karma whore-y
---
Click over the weapon and it will show the "bis" enchant btw.
---
Don't sleep on hunter for PvE demand. There's a ton of hunters, but many of them are solo/casual players and/or suck. A good hunter brings a massive amount of group utility, nice dps, and generally has minimal competition for gear with other classes.
---
I've always rated "random enchantment".
---
How many subscription services are you paying for a month? Sure $5 doesn't seem like much, but if you pay for wow $15/mo sub, Netflix, and any other monthly fee sub it begins to add up.
---
Well you gotta run across the Barrens to get to Mulgore, which is doable albeit a bit of a pain in the ass.  Stay on the roads.  Keep in mind that if you're a Warlock or Rogue you will not have easy access to class trainers for a while.

Loot council is perfectly reasonable if it is run by reasonable people. It puts gear in the hands of people that will use it best to progress the guild. This is usually the person that it will upgrade the most.
---
If you don't trust your officers to run it properly, why are you raiding with that guild?
---
Call 911
---
ayy blmao
---
I've seen most people say the opposite tbh. Dun Morogh has 2 races fighting over mobs as opposed to just 1 in Darkshore. Not to mention Darkshore is pretty great to level in.
---
Just grind mobs its really boring but not hard.  I hit 60 on my mage in like 5 days played
---
lmao. I was sick when recording this!
---
Think of all the addons people have written for WoW. Deadly Boss Mods and TSM alone have changed the game entirely and THEY don’t lock their stuff behind a paywall.
---
You people are so overdramatic.
---
deleted
---
microtransactions were added little by little.

I just can't wait to laugh at someone missing the jump

the pro tip is have a shit ton of high level gear.

seriously man I can't wait to just breathe in that world again, every stress test I just logged in and felt like I was home again.

Please please please do not progress to anything resembling TBC.  New content in the same spirit as Classic wow is what the gaming community is looking for.
---
There's probably already a TED talk about how spending $5 10 turn into spending $500. And that might turn into spending $5,000. And then all the sudden have all this nice stuff and you're in a bunch of debt. I guess they really don't teach you kids about that do they.
---
Tell you what I am going to start a patreon and website and if I get enough patreon subscribers at $5 a month I'll start making the Ted talk about how to get butthurt over spending $5 and how in the long run that will make you rich. I love this idea.
---
Yet there's 5 posts about it. Say what you want
---
Raid xp is *much* lower than 5-man.  And you won't be able to complete any quests that aren't specifically listed as raid quests.
---
I'm not sure where this is located. Where I live in the southeastern United States, we are required by law to check ID on EVERYONE, even the obviously old people. So that's a little odd to me because how can you know if someone is 40? It's no different than knowing if someone is 21.
---
Classic is/will be successful for the foreseeable future. There is plenty of evidence pointing in this direction. You can even take Pserver player numbers ALONE and deem classic a successful modern video game.
---
Finger that bitch!
---
Donating because you like something and paying for access to them are two very different things. Like you said, he could gain access by getting in contact most likely, but he elected to go on Reddit and cry about it, this is where the majority of the silliness comes from for me.
---
I wish people were this gung-ho about getting rid of people who said hateful stuff in chat, too.
---
Apparently, yes. But you won’t be able to complete quests in a raid group.
---
Not sure you can raid dungeons, heard from beta it didnt work. Less xp. Not harder, doesnt scale.
---
It doesn't but you will not be able to complete quest objectives since you will be considered in a raid group with 6 people.
---
Lieutenant Dan

yikes...

---
Don't tell me what to do!! *Already downloaded it yesterday.*
---
Unlikely :(. We as a community can name it something stupid, see above “Blammo”
---
I did that for a while but slowly tested the waters (out of laziness) and figured out that it doesn't seem to damage the treadmill running belt.
---
... does need a re-waxing though.
---
I can also just pirate the guide, that's not the point. The point is the way he went about this was shitty.
---
You think you do, but you don't. 
---
You absolutely can, but it'd be completely pointless. It'd be impossible to complete quests, and everyone's xp gains will be shot to shit. 
---
&gt; Does the dungeon get more difficult with more than 5 players? 
---
No. Nothing changes but the amount of people you're playing with. I imagine it'd be a lot easier, just like how you can technically do a instance with 4 ppl but a full group of 5 is far easier/efficient.
---
If anyone ever downloaded anything for free I am a hypocrite. Okay. And you are the idiot.
---
I played a shaman in vanilla (hit blood guard and raised up to Maxx), the biggest problem with shaman tanking is threat.  The second biggest problem is your damage mitigation is poor.  I don't remember if mana was an issue but I never tried to tank anything after RFD.  It's too slow and cumbersome to ask people to watch you attack for 5 seconds before they can DPS.
---
and nothing scales, so it doesn't get harder just because you put more people in.
---
strafe to a/d is the same as turning with a/d if you use your mouse
---
change my mind
---
&gt;  Why does he even have it monthly? 
---
I guess in theory he could update it.
---
Yep and also hunters have to put away their pet or it will find its way back to you with all the mobs it finds along the way.
---
Look at that no-lifer who reaches 60 before TBClassic comes out.
---
The fact I read this in the melodic form of a few of there songs put together means you did a good job my fellow mage. Thanks for the hype can’t wait to level mine
---
I’ve said it a few times, but the classic criers got what they wanted, but they’re so committed to being mad that they can’t back down now
---
Stay away from those guilds
---
Wow haha.
---
Yeah I just saw that 30 minutes ago, haha. I'm wondering if Blizz will do smth.
---
I think it's valuable if you are supplying people with flasks, potions, etc.
---
Also if you get to the point of selling BoEs on AH you can funnel that money into other ventures
---
Hellfire Peninsula lol.
---
Started in 2006 and was sort of an alt-o-holic. Would get a character up to like 40 then reroll. Got to around that on what would end up being my main, then BC launched and I started rolling blood elves and draenei so took even longer lol.
---
LOL omg I forgot about 10 man dungeons!
---
AHAHAHHAHAH. This. Post. Wins. The. Sub. Today. Bois.   
---
I can go offline now, thank you!
---
Cant you just put the rouge on your mage or are you not playing a female.
---
I use S backpedal as an easy stopcasting key. I get that that is probably dumb, but it's what I'm used to and I don't really see the downside.
---
Yeah no problem let me just register for a reoccurring subscription from a SHADY site like clickbank where you CANNOT cancel the reoccuring payments without opening web tickets or calling your credit card for fraud allert, go read about their shady business tactics, they have a very very low score at better business bureau
---
Pretty shady, and he's even mentioned live in stream and it was written ON HIS SITE that his guide would continue to remain free... Greedy
---
I actually might miss Susan Express
---
Ahhhhh taurens, mulgore and TB!!! my favorite race, zone and citie by far. But i went traumatized being the primary focus always in BG´s, now i have real fraid so i am rolling other race, probably orc or undead...but my heart is with the taurens. (but undead seems fun...and undercity is cool!)
---
I'm not gonna lie, I actually teared up when they were talking about going home again at the end of the video. You really don't get many opportunities in life to go "back home," and I truly feel blessed that all of us get to do just that in a few short days. :')
---
As a DPS role, Mages are quite beneficial in the raiding scene compared to the more unconventional DPS roles such as shadow, enhancement or retribution. 
---
You're right that healers are more sought after, that's a given, but mages bring quite a lot to the table in regards to food, water and buffs. 
---
Also take into consideration that it's 40-man raids until ZG, so there will be a lot of spots available.
---
But obviously you can choose your fight all the time since you have stealth. They are a bit cooldown reliant but for pvp they are really nice to stunluck down exactly want you want. They do decent against all classes with cds. Mage is also good in every aspect just the most squishy if you don't see the dmg coming and react in time.
---
Will I regret leveling in Darkshore as a Gnome Warlock? Are there trainers over there or do I have to hearth to IF and fly back?
---
I'm attaching myself to the Guild of a youtuber that I like because I have no other friends who are playing. It gives a sort of built in community that you know you have the same interests and sense of humor of.
---
Neckbeards need something to "REEEEEEEE" over, and Blizz took layering away from them by pretty solidly demolishing those arguments.
---
I believe that you can learn from any class trainer for your class, regardless of race.  That said, make sure the class you roll has trainers in the starting area.  Mulgore is a really awesome zone but i'm pretty sure it won't have trainers for Mages/Priests/warlocks.  I honestly cannot remember if there are trainers for those classes in Thunder Bluff.
---
As someone who has dumped over 3,000 hours into modding, and hundreds of hours into teaching others, all for free without accepting donations: 
---
you do it for free because you love and respect the game and community. Slapping a price tag on your work hurts a lot of fans. Not everyone has money to dump on extras. It's not fair to them to charge. Sure, first world nations can afford it. 5$ is nothing. But someone out in East Asia? Western Europe? South America? 5$ is a LOT of money.
---
Nice comparison
---
And you have to probably travel to the dungeon. If you think bfa mythic kind of travel, you will be disappointed. Death is possible on your way to the  dungeon.
---
a s d f q w e r z x c v and shift+ are my spells and abilities(if I need extra 1 2 3 4 5) all movements are mouse.

This means so much to me. I’m not as good with words as you are, so please take my thank you to heart. This isn’t just about WoW anymore for me, but speaks to a very personal IRL part of me. For that, I am so, so very thankful. You’re an absolute brother ❤️
---
Could you please give me some tips and tricks as to how to create a ‘good’ list, and not dwell off? 
---
Again, this means so much to me thank you so very much!
---
Reserved already but Peterpopoff for a priest.
---
That's the best part. You never know If you're about to fight a noob or a Chad.
---
I did that in 2004.  It was painful.  
---
People would take me places even under-leveled so it wasn’t all that bad.
---
Pretty sure in most prisons, that's an instant shiv.
---
There's nothing more sacred in our society than the EULA.
---
I feel like I'll enjoy the game a lot more if I just chill and take my time. But I also want to be a warrior tank on a PvP server. So I know I'll have a bad time being way behind.
---
Worldwide maybe, NA doesn't hit 1 million unless they have 20+ servers
---
If you’re not easily manipulated then why are you still giving me the time of day if I’m so immature and you’re just so much more mentally advanced than me. Get out of here Doctor Dickhead.
---
You could poll it, but what changes do you poll? It's also only a few days till launch. So a little late to do that. 
---
The macro system works differently despite their efforts. Theres things that don't work, checking for buffs, that did work. Other thing work, targeted AOE, that didn't work. There's dozens more examples of things that are now possible that weren't, or were that are not.
---
The classic way is so much better it'll make you hate that shitty green eye. People actually talk since the dungeons take longer, people communicate about loot and what parts of the dungeon to do on the way there, you add good players to your friends list and bad players to your shit list for future reference when you want to run dungeons again.
---
Basically instant group finder is one of the key reasons people want classic back, and you're gonna find out why, and have a fun time doing it.
---
Second language in NA is french in front of spanish and portuguese. Go Québec!
---
Thats why i took the 27th off.
---
....Granted, that will be me on the 28th.  ...And the 3rd.
---
I mentally call it BLAM-OH!
---
I checked it out on my phone at first, but to my delight it seems like they have recommended enchants on different pieces throughout the tiers. (not only weapon-enchants) Very nice. But still, a list below the items would be even better, instead of having to search through everything to know what to get. 
---
It would also be cool to see some PvP BiS suggestions on there, those are hard to find imo.
---
I will still use this for sure! Thanks OP
---
Me too. Farming gold is boring. I'd rather work for an hour instead of playing something I don't enjoy for 10 hours.
---
What the fuck Winnie the Pooh?
---
Honestly, believe it or not, I wasn't thinking about classic WoW when my wife and I planned on starting a family three years ago. My bad haha
---
What I've done is hang out at the meeting stone in front of the dungeon I want to run. Usually would get into a group that was meeting at the dungeon. This worked particularly well at Wailing Caverns. I did this on private servers, but that aspect of the game isn't different on classic.
---
aside from maybe a main tank nobody is a carry in wow  
---
a guild will be shooting itself in the foot if they piled all the gear onto a few people while the rest were wearing bullshit
---
I think everyone loves Papa Jeff. Crazy to think of where he is now with his back story of how he got employed by Blizzard. I am really sad that Mike Morhaime and Chris Metzen have retired. The energy some of these guys bring when announcing stuff is an amazing feeling.
---
&gt; People are gonna know who kills Ragnaros first.
---
Right.  Ascent.  That's who it will always be.
---
The stockpiled resources would still add up though? There's no stopping someone from having 4-5 Bank alts filled with Fish prior to the event.
---
Is it possible to scan the inventory of every player on the server in order to determine an appropriate resource count?
---
Capitalism is a flawed argument and system. It is one of the reasons WoW and other games become worse over time. As the game becomes more successful people/companies begin investing into the company/product. Now the focus isn't on making a good game by caring developers. They get replaced by marketing teams that try to change the game in order to make the most profit possible and to show constant growth to investors. So focus shifts from making good game to money making strategies. You can see this in most MMOs. An old wow dev even recently stated this fact. So, yay capitalism. A system that is all about making a quick buck and screwing over others to do it.
---
It's a good list and very easy to use too.
---
Some mistakes and no alternatives options, but then again if you look at any two "BIS" lists they'll be different. It is best not to rely on any single list in any case.
---
That's actually hilarious to me - but you're not wrong. Most people who want to level fast understand that getting ahead is huge - Elwynn Forest is going to suck because even with dynamic respawns, the competition will be annoying. If you're the first person to hit level 10 and get to Westfall, all the mobs are fresh for you with next to no one else stealing kills. He knows how to get ahead early, and then when no one else is even close to him, he can essentially grind out a single player game in the most effective way. I know he's done speed leveling in an environment that he can't get ahead because he starts after a realm is already established, but it's still nothing compared to the competition of thousands of people competing over similar resources. He also admits that he's only ever played Warlock and Hunter, which are two of the safest and most consistent leveling specs. He knows what's hes doing in a vacuum, and you have to give him credit for being good at what he does, but he's definitely not adaptable and struggles when things aren't the way he expects them to be.
---
A lot of best caster gear is off set. Warlock tier sets are very good for pvp tho
---
Good point, thanks!
---
Even with Classic coming I don't think I could smile if I had to work through the weekend...
---
If you're spending all of your mana totem twisting while smacking things for Nightfall debuff, then yeah, your personal damage will be low.
---
Guild banks are nessesary. Where would you keep the raid materials? You don't just give out the cores from MC or the leather. You have to store it and use it for the raid as needed.
---
Wow this is drawn so well I thought it was a screenshot
---
No, you would be forced to change it.
---
That's why you take vacation. At least that's what I did. Days after though? Yeah... 💀
---
This is my hope and dreams too 
---
Let face it OG wow was Direction was lead by decisions base on profit income and at the time casual friendly “easier” direction was the best decision they made to achieve the goals the business man established. 
---
But I hope with wow classic they go a different route and stay true to vanilla wow
---
No, let's say u want to be on Herod later. So you make your name there to save the name. You make a char on Herod - let's name him Jimmy. You leave him there and play on a different very empty server with a n other char named Jimmy. You level up and so on and wait till server trans. Is possible, then you trans. Ur level 60 Jimmy from the empty server to Herod. Then you delete Herod jimmy so ur old Jimmy can have the name on Herod. I hope u understand, my English isn't that good :x
---
Let's have proximity voice chat instead. Would be great to hear all kind of autistic screeching.
---
Warlock = Sodium, Priest = Chloride
---
You can do the same dungeon over and over, and some groups will, because they need a specific piece of gear.
---
Another me checking in
---
There were several things added in BC that made leveling Paladin easier, mostly giving them more damage.  That being said, it's not the most painful class to level in classic, so if it's what you wanna play you should do it!
---
Short answer:  Yes, it'll be worse, but not by much.
---
You're going to be auto-attacking your way to 60 but don't let that dissuade you from playing the class you want to at 60.
---
Doesn't skillcapped and similar sites break this rule
---
We want nothing added except new content and class upgrades.  Pretty simple.
---
Engineering, consumables and various trinkets are your best friends.
---
In 6 months there will be roughly 50-100k active players in NA.   Whether you consider that a fail or not is up to your definition of fail.
---
Baron?
---
The trash leading from Garr to Sulfuron? 
---
Without resist gear those will chew through noobs.
---
No you keep your name on the high pop big que server and play on the low popnto avoid que times. Transfer over if the lower pop server is bad. Better then waiting an hour to play
---
does aap show quest areas/objectives on map or do you need something else
---
The problem is mine won't even turn on. PSU, mobo or CPU is borked.
---
Ah, I assumed this was for today's survey or the one before it. Thanks.
---
The market had an average 54% loss.
---
How would that assume a risky investment? Index based mutual funds, which would be a sound investment normally, were decimated.
---
Again that also assumes he literally saved every dollar.
---
You also aren’t factoring in any health care costs he’d have. Like deductibles.
---
Please though, go talk to certified financial planner and have them tell you the same thing. A million dollars isn’t enough. Even two really isn’t. *Especially* when you factor in a major stock market crash right after his income dried up.
---
It worked for me. Make sure it's the same server, and you've spelled the name correctly.
---
He says while waiting to play the game given to us by the 'spoilt brats'
---
We don't know when this was filmed though. Like, it could have been the Blizzcon demo for all we know. They even say in the video "Yeah, I think we just keep it hard like it is..." implying that this was possibly early on in the development stage?
---
It really could have been these guys first time playing Classic in 14 years.
---
Ah you play with Henry?  That's pretty cool.
---
It does. I rolled my first toon back in '05 and thought Enchanting sounded like a cool profession! I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The mats are difficult to come by, and I don't think I was that good about Disenchanting things
---
^^^ lmk too guys lol
---
Does sad mean awesome where you come from?
---
Everybody be acting like Joana be doin this.

Anyone who expects a perfect recreation of original wow needs to take a look in the mirror and take a deep breath. We are starting on 1.12. There will be cross realm BG's immediately once they arrive. There is layering. The server populations will be larger. No extra skeletons. This is not going to be an exact replica of vanilla wow. And that's okay.
---
I'm so annoyed that I've never thought of this.
---
Agreed whole heartedly.
---
Can it perform well in a raid setting??
---
Orc stun resist will probably give you the most edge
---
And those areas will also have gankers waiting.
---
lmao, this video
---
Consumables are a HUGE deal. Even without engineering, access to various potions and utility trinkets/items can totally change pvp matchups. Then when you bring engineering into account it's a whole new game.
---
PvP is also far burstier in vanilla than any other version. There's no concept of resilience, sometimes you'll just get deleted when the other player criticized chains.
---
Vanilla pvp is not balanced and it's not fair, but it sure as hell is fun. You just need to bring the right mindset.
---
The highest-end dungeons are going to 5-man only except for UBRS, which was designed for 10. Strat, Scholo, DM and BRD won't let you in as a raid.
---
That is what I was thinking. I won't be leveling casually per se but at least behind the people i'll be playing with at 60. Druid seems like a good fit and I'd love to play a night elf.
---
Your original reply was completely hypocritical.
---
My original comment was valid for the discussion.
---
My meta reply was the only way for someone lacking in self-awareness (such as yourself) to snap back to reality.
---
The only way my reply towards your hypocritical statement is hypocritical is if I hold the same values towards discussions that you do, which I don't because I'm not a hypocrite.
---
engineering is the most meta profession in the game
---
Ah yes not a bad idea. Guess I'll keep my char on Herod just in case
---
Well, since your argument was warped to begin with, I figured: why not?
---
Yeah an "Optional" list would be really nice to have.
---
Where you getting lowest dps from?
---
Thats why i buy prepaid cards huehue
---
Ya totally
---
See you there!
---
Works fine on my mac,   theres a drop down menu where u usually download the ptr.
---
The best thing you could do is try and enjoy yourself. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea. 
---
Go in with an open mind. 
---
Sorry, this advice is simplistic, but I believe I’m having no expectations and just enjoying what you can.
---
This is gonna be top tier schadenfreude for me.
---
Enjoy that 6 hour queue while the rest of us play the game.
---
...Hire a drill sergeant as a temp...? :P
---
My masters degree is in computer graphics and undergrad minor in math :)  Also, unsure how what you said relates to me saying that I think it's incredibly dumb that people are complaining about having to pay $5 for a guide to...skip time playing a GAME that is meant to be ENJOYED.
---
I don't know if anyone still uses DKP, but I remember back in the old days spending months doing MC, building up DKP so that if one of the Cenarion Raiments dropped, I'd get it, only to find out that the officer managing the DKP for the guild nuked the totals and pretty much collapsed the guild.
---
omg taking the day off for a video game? thats crazy!!!
---
Anyone else tear up watching this?
---
On top of him saying the guide would be free and he would only charge for the addon?
---
A lot of what he says just doesn't add up sometimes. So he has very little money and yet he allows his roommate stay there even though the guy hadn't paid rent in almost 4 months. He said his roommate has a serious drug problem. I don't know about you but if I didn't have much money I wouldn't be paying for my drug addicts rent for four months.
---
Also I subbed to his twitch months ago (still subbed) and donated money to support his work and because he said the guide would be free. Even though doing that because of his promise he told me that subs a d donators wouldn't get access to the guide.
---
so downvote and move on
---
i haven't seen the new one that he updated but i highly doubt it will be. even his own that you can get for free from cache's will be virtually equivalent. maybe if you are going for server first 60 or something, but they all are pretty equivalent to me.
---
i think this one is just the most popular/famous because Joana himself is a renowned classic wow speedrunner with i believe the fastest time in original classic (people have done way faster on pservers)
---
We actually played druid/rogue at release. I'm over the rogue though.
---
For the Alliance!!!!!
---
Im saying the impact of changes are simply only applied to the meta game and largely benefit classes and specs that primarily aren't allowed in raids.
---
It's a love/hate relationship, the gadgets certainly come with a premium
---
Where the hell is the entrance to the skull eye?!???
---
is that his adams apple on the back of the head...
---
Well I know for a fact that blizzard doesn’t ban for buying gold. 
---
At least they didn’t, have they changed that policy recently? 
---
You don’t have to give them any information to buy gold, if you do that’s your problem. 
---
Don’t get me wrong here, I’m not saying buying gold is a good thing I’m not trying to justify it, I just want to clear up some facts because there is a lot of speculation here from people that doesn’t know what they are talking about.
---
Here's the problem, my guild already has 2 people going feral one them is the GM. I REALLY wanted to play a feral but I would really like to be a team player, I enjoy healing quite a bit I just hate the "helpless" aspect of it. Maybe I will look into it more, I was very interested in druid the first time around but I was horde and was not a fan of Tauren druids, they just didnt make sense to me. It's sort of like now with Belf/Tauren Paladins and Panda Shaman, it just doesn't fit.
---
Thank you for your detailed response, I will look into it further.
---
This has been announced since launch dates were announced I believe, also it’s the same time for mostly everyone cause time change.
---
They don't call me Partial "Toxic" Necessity for nothin.
---
Which dungeons are generally considered 10 mans?
---
&gt; Pickpocketing = easy soloable money farms
---
also kinda low generating tho
---
but at least u dont compete with anyone
---
Have your pallies/priests set their decursive prio to different groups.
---
Or if you really want to cheese it the whole raid uses restorative potions.  (They remove debuffs over time)
---
I find it funny how Joana thinks that someone will seriously pay for a leveling guide for a game that people have played to death. I would not be surprised if there were like a dozen other guides in a day or two that are just as good if not better. Hell there's already million copies of his exact guide out there. You can't just paywall something that you put on the internet,even if you originally release it as a paid product someone will buy it and share it for free anyway.
---
No it's not it's a hell scape that should be avoided at all cost.
---
There's no perfect loot system as all are subject to abuse. As long as you trust the people on the council it's usually the most effective way to distribute loot but the big thing is not just trust in your loot council but they also need to know what is bis for each class and how well a class will scale with that item. It's a complex system that I am surprised is being widely advertised but I guess that's just the nature of guilds that are forming before the game is even out, it's a more hardcore crowd. DKP is pretty fair but you have to still keep people in check. Rolling for loot is plenty fair, especially in more casual guilds however it is subject to RNG. 
---
I think master loot with appropriate members of the raid using /roll is actually one of the best systems because it's simple and fair. Still need to setup some ground rules for what is okay and isn't okay to /roll for (for example Hunters rolling for an item that is technically an upgrade but much better suited for a warrior or rogue) . It's less work than the loot council and DKP systems are.
---
&gt; about it ruining the vanilla experience, killing the game
---
That's still up the air. It probably won't kill the game, but I guarantee a massive amount of people will quit because of layering.
---
you forgot the pic of slowpoke
---
That actually happens. Imagine that.
---
Meh he wants to feel useful and not like a freeloader. If you have a problem with it just don't sub.
---
I'm american you moron. Also, that was much more clear, thank you. I'm not saying that anyone should or should not pay for this. People are pissed and behaving like indignant children because he decided to charge for it. Im defending him putting a price on HIS hard work. Whatever they decide to do in regards to that... I couldn't give a shit less.
---
This blew my mind yesterday watching his 2006 speed run on Twitch. I always called him "Jo-Ana" assuming he named the character that cause he always plays female characters haha
---
In an effort to answer some of the questions like faction distribution on each server, and overall server populations, we created this brief survey for users to take once they decide on a realm.
---
Note: **your responses are editable**, if you pick another server feel free to go back in and change your answer. 
---
**To see faction or language distribution by servers, you can use the [raw data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7VJ381nSZfqiVaSqmlSRCS4VavhOVr1oLIjm4CfO-w/edit?usp=sharing)** (Currently being created/edited with the additional realms and questions, check back for further updates)
---
---  
---
##**Note:** Please check the second tab on the bottom of the results for additional data.
---
--- 
---
**For those of you registering names on the EU servers**, here's a heads up as to where you might find a community that speaks your language:
---
* **Spanish Speakers:** are intending to play on Shazzrah (PVP) and Pyrewood Village (PVE)  
---
* **Portuguese Speakers:** are intending to play on Shazzrah (PVP) - predominantly on the Horde.  
---
* **The Scandinavian community:** is intending to play on Shazzrah (PVP)  
---
* **The Italian community:** is intending to play on Shazzrah (PVP)  
---
* **The Hungarian community:** is intending to play on Golemagg (PVP) and Mirage Raceway (PVE)  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
**For those of you registering names on the American servers**, here's a heads up as to where many of the communities are heading:

#New posts discussing this survey and it's results will be removed for this Megathread.
---
Just go in head first without looking up anything.  I'm jealous.
---
If you want to raid, you shouldn't be a shadow priest.  Maybe if your best friend is the guild leader they'll invite you, but barring that you will have a very hard time finding a raid spot.
---
The Lich King via Nerzhul was also trying to give a fuck you to the Burning Legion who's trying to stop OG.
---
You are out of date on your memes, which makes sense for a boomer.
---
Did you read the title of this post?
---
Haha yeah.  The Chinese president takes offense when he's compared to Winnie the Pooh so they've banned references to it.
---
So 2H fury is the way to go? Thanks
---
That's not what is best for the raid or the guild. Resources get set aside and then used to further the raid's progress. Not distributed out into the masses. Your method is chaos and encourages people to be selfish.
---
Do you have to have the main WoW installed already?
---
From what I saw it only included cooking built in to the guide like if you go to a certain inn it'll tell you to buy boar steak recipe or whatever. I was playing an ud lock so not sure if it makes you learn anything else
---
There's been multiple discussions about macros on the forums, that mention them working differently than 1.12 and BFA. I don't have a complete list of macro functions that don't work, just random ass examples.
---
Got a job interview at 9am on the 27th ;_;
---
But will be calling in sick to play for the rest of the day once that is over
---
If you don't think it's worth it's value, just don't buy it...
---
If you're rolling a male toon go gnome mage. Female, NE rogue. NE females have the best weapon animations in the game imo.
---
I stand corrected. They've never announced worries about queues on those servers though.
---
It's really cool, but I see it more as a mid-level dungeon than a low level dungeon.
---
You have to keep clicking. It has 1/x for every zone/area. Then it goes to another location etc.
---
That's honestly not true at all.
---
I think there's going to be too much emphasis on pre-raid BiS when there are tons of very similar and comparable alternatives.
---
Hunters can get bone-slicing hatchets which are a ~.5% crit downgrade from the Dal'rend combo, but it drops from an easy to reach boss in Strat dead at a 20% drop chance. Yes it is not the BEST thing you can use, but it is very close and doesn't require you to screw over a rogue or fury in getting it.
---
For non-human and orc fury warriors daggers are also really nice phase 2 pre-raid when combined with mugger's belt or Distracting Dagger to get early weapon skill.
---
And as much as people hate on 2h fury, the Dreadforge Retaliator will be quite strong for Orcs in Phase 1 before getting Deathbringer from Ony or forking out money for axe of the deep woods.

I've heard this too, and - no offense to you personally - nobody seems to have any actual proof. I wouldn't personally be upset if he changed from this model, dudes gotta eat, but I get why someone would be. Cheers
---
I think that’s hard to assume without a mass release yet. Yeah the streams and Q&amp;A’s have been promising, but until it’s available to a wider audience, no one can really be sure. Especially when we are talking about a year or two later.
---
Maybe his experience was as a clothie. Once you have a good pair of boots there's no reason for one to join a Rend run. Personally since I never did those, I didn't remember they were even a thing.
---
Shaman get wolf speed, haven't looked to see speed difference between them though. Hunter doesn't look too bad though.
---
We've always known this. They said 27 because it's the latest date anywhere in the world and they would rather pleasantly surprise america with a day early release than disappoint europe with a day late release.
---
I feel these guides are completely useless.  
---
Are there any guides that don't include kill/drops/gather quests?  There's no way you're getting your boar kills when each spawn is surrounded by 10 people spamming first hit.
---
This is just pre-playing interest. I guarantee you there will be a big big falloff during leveling and at max, priests will be a lower percentage than you see here.
---
Especially since we'll be back on the raid ID lockout system for all raids, instead of just mythic raids like in retail wow. I think that will be the biggest barrier to pugging.
---
Pfff! 😅
---
Got dayum, i hope Firemaw is safe! 🙏🏻
---
Named my priest "Fortsmite" it triggers many ppl.
---
That's what the Blizzard fanboys want you to do, yes. You're not allowed to complain anymore.
---
Like being forced to play a whole new character. Me no like
---
*latter fwiw
---
I'm in the boat of excited for classic and having no idea where else to go for something better.  The annoying hassle of using a cached version and hoping it's working isn't something I want to deal with.  I could spend time researching it, hoping peoples opinions about what is a better guide are correct *OR* I could pay 5 dollars to get it for a month and if I like it great if not I'm out 5 dollars.
---
I have no problem supporting people who create things I can use.  I've been using patreon to pay Warcraftlogs, raidbots, and some other content creators I enjoy because for the price of a movie ticket a month I think it's worth supporting people who provide or enhance my entertainment. I'm not paying 5 dollars because I want to support him. I'm paying 5 dollars for the brand recognition and hoping a decent quality product comes from that.
---
I'd rather be a beggar than an ass hole 😉
---
I use that more if I don't know where to go. It's not efficient to have 90 tabs open when different quests take me to different places, and even then, using wowhead ignores the fact that I'm going to outlevel some quests and not know who gave them, so I'd end up having to double check everyone anyway.
---
The point /u/justhere4inspiration was making is about economics and competition.  If you have the option of paying a $5 monthly fee for a leveling guide or paying $0 for a leveling guide, which one makes more sense economically?  Obviously the second is more appealing from an economic stand point.
---
Then you get into the idea of 'if he is charging money, then he has to have got some edge or advantage that the other guides don't have'.  And this likely isn't true.  Most guide are very similar, if not identical, in their leveling path and recommendations.  So, you would be paying $5 for a guide that most likely doesn't provide any intrinsic advantage.
---
On top of that, there are other guides, free ones, that have in game addons that aid you while playing and not require a second monitor or alt-tabbing over and over again.  Joana did say he was working on an addon, but that hasn't been proven to be available or a quality product yet.  So, now other guides are more appealing from a known quality standpoint.
---
If you aren't cheaper or better quality, then you often get pushed aside for the competition.  This is why putting his guide behind a pay wall isn't a smart move.  He is well within his rights to do so, just that there isn't any incentive to purchase his product at the moment.
---
Thanks , now I know how to avoid my people

Yeah all you’ve done is show you have no idea what you’re talking about and know nothing about raiding. I’d bet you’ve never even been in a loot council guild or seen one do the things you’re suggesting. 
---
The way you talk about it is like the guild is a bunch of people only out for themselves and the officers are intentionally trying to self-destruct it ASAP. Never seen it happen one time that way.
---
bit dramatic
---
Here's hoping.
---
If you have an active subscription (active right now) then you will receive the option from the drop down menu to download classic wow.
---
Looks like something out of the original Fantasia
---
Well the first sentence is a lie, so yeah. He mentioned it several times on stream and podcasts.
---
It's a *DONATION.* That's the key word. You don't deserve anything and should not expect anything for a donation. You're ignorant.

EPL!
---
What? How did you even take that away from what I said?
---
Oh I was 14 and totally a stupid kid. I grew up a lot since then and realize that it was wrong, but at the time... it was epic.
---
The faction wars/PK system WAS GREAT. I forgot about all of that! It's something I believe WoW is lacking, although I am going to re-play classic WoW when it's released again on the 26th. I miss it too. :)
---
Do you play WoW..?
---
Wow, man. Take a moment and look at those posts. You did a simple jape, and these people are all calling you toxic and bad. Want to know something they all have in common?
---
They all insult you one way or another at the end of the post.
---
Huh.
---
Absolutely! I'm not using any guides unless I get pissed off after not being able to figure something out within 20 mins or so lol

There's 999 free leveling guides out there lol it's not entitled to find it really weird that someone would put a guide behind a paywall, it's so petty... Also he can change his mind randomly to try and get a few bucks out of people, doesnt mean people can't find it cheap and criticize him lol
---
When you've been whispered by 10-15 different people and in as many minutes and each of those individuals ask you multiple times you kind of start to lose your civility.
---
Also, ignore list has a limit.
---
for the quantity of gold these sellers are dealing in, they could afford to just randomly send 1000g to people to make blanket bans a very bad thing to try and enforce.
---
It's Blizzard 2019. It will be, heavily.
---
Dont take the 26th off. Take a half day at most. Taje the 27th off and stay up.
---
I personally am not taking any time off because I don't want it to be wasted on queue times and overcrowded zones. We'll see about later once it's quieted down.
---
Damn that's a good one! Works three ways
---
&gt;  because the images in them can't be sold unless he wants Blizzard to be upset. 
---
The images in them are debateably fair use. I know the term gets overused, but Joana would actually have a case here.
---
As classic approaches I am having more and more second thoughts about what class I should pick, so in the end I managed to narrow it down to mage and warlock. Mostly I am not planning on being a hardcore raider, mostly dungeons, some raids here and there, but also a lot of pvp. 
---
Is mage worth picking because of the conjure ability, or the cool portals? Or the warlock for the soul stone, summoning portal and other utilities, and also the allegedly free mount?
---
Gotten tons of great comments about it already My chick likes it so I'm not worried. Let's see you do better.
---
There was a Private Toucher on Terokkar back in the old days.
---
Just play again. Don’t fight your demons. (Speaking strictly about wow)
---
Ah yes, the hearthstone route. We can still use /emote, right?
---
Now thats the kind of ingenuity we need!
---
People talking about how they summoned noobs way below the surface to drown them and then get praised for it. You simply lured a goldbeggar from one city to another. Oh you devilish bastard how could you.
---
They are making changes (/#no changes) for the sole purpose of limiting and stopping gold sellers. Most notably in the AMA they stated they will NOT allow mass skeletons to remain because that is how gold sellers would write out their websites in major cities.
---
The thing is, it was called VC since before Dire Maul was ever in the game.  
---
Most people who ran Deadmines didn't do it because it was . adungeon to do, they only knew it was there because an eiete quest called [The Defias Brotherhood](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=166/the-defias-brotherhood), had the objective "Kill Edwin VanCleef and bring his head to Gryan Stoutmantle."  So people in chat would bee in chat looking for a group to kill VanCleef, or VC, which you obviously need to go to the Deadmines in order to do.
---
And thus deadmines became known as VC, due to people looking for a group to do the quest that asked them to kill VanCleef.  Dire Maul didn't come out for several months after this had been established as the norm.

The real reason is so someone can't draw a swastika on the ground because clearly we are not adults who could handle seeing that.
---
Can you see what players are ignoring you?
---
I mean more like people saying that they'll guild kick somebody for buying gold or power leveling.
---
My game experience has pretty much never been impacted by someone buying gold, but I've been in lots of guilds with people who'll make crappy homophobic or racist jokes. It's rare to find someone who'll actually do something about stuff like that.

I plan on grinding quite a bit. Should the opportunity arise, I'd also farm BRD since a lot of pre-bis gear can drop there and dungeon xp seems to be good. So if its a good group I might as well start the gear farming a bit earlier.

For health reasons he left Blizzard, but has recently started contributing again a little with Overwatch (Sigma, their latest character), and with Thrall VA. Hopefully he gets (or has been getting) involved again with Blizzard.
---
So just because HotW is a "feral" spec, you're still on the healing roster. You just have more feral-ish play options outside of the raid. At the earliest levels of raiding, you just get more out of HotW than you do deep resto which really only brings imp regrowth and swiftmend. Similarly NG is a "balance" spec but you're 100% on the healing team, not some hybrid healer/dps build. Basically druid talents are so awesome that you have 3 viable raid healer builds spread across very different talent trees.

Then they would just find places outside major cities. Better than nothing though.

I agree 100%.

That's very silly. In Europe, of course you want to know which server the people from your country are going for, despite you being able to communicate in English. 
---
For example, I am more than eager to know the breakdown on Finnish players. Despite around 100 % of us (Finnish players) being able to communicate in English very fluently, we'd still like to "be among ourselves" and choose the server where the other Finnish players are going. This survey doesn't bring any insight to that question. 
---
I'm sure it's nearly the same for all European countries. Europe is very different from the USA; here the country matters more than the language.
---
Cat nip for morons, love it, well said
---
There are better, smarter, and more consumer friendly ways to do it than to sell a guide that has tons of equally as good (If not better based on classes) that are already available for free. Actual Twitch channel growth is one, he's actually relevant and even sitting at 3.1k viewers while playing old videos of him leveling. He needs to take this great chance he has right now and focus on growing his brand, not his 12 year old touched up over time guide that you can just use a wayback and get it for free anyway. It's time to expand.
---
I mean, you could still run it, especially if you are on a PvE server. This is especially true for Night Elves.
---
He'll probably be adding content to his guides and expanding past leveling. He's charging monthly so its safe to expect new content or else people will just unsub.

You not beeing sure about something doesn’t change known facts. Engineering is pretty easily and affordable to max if you follow guides what to buy.

”legal”?

And yes I might do the same
---
You really dove into this too deep.  This is not a game developer or a publisher.  This is a guy that created a leveling guide and decided how he wanted to charge for it.  Good or bad...its on him and only affects him.
---
Just want to say that as someone who mained druid in vanilla I certainly remember that picture. Druid forums were up in arms about being left out lol

I think it's less about being stingy and more about principle. The way he's going about this just leaves a bad taste in people's mouths. I'm not planning on using any guides either, but I can still sympathize with people being upset over what's happening.

It will not be hard.  There are up to 30 dps in raids and mages are highly sought after for their damage and utility.

That wasn't an 'inclusive or' question, saying yes doesn't make any sense. It's like you're repeating the punchline to a joke you don't really get.
---
Yea and switch to arms at 40 for mortal strike, it does a lot more damage than bloodthirst
---
I'd like you to see you press ctrl f while spinning your camera and moving forward faster than I can. I use the same 12 keys all within mm of eachother for 32 combos all while never taking my hand away from my movement keys.
---
You dont.
---
Oh TIL, didn't know that was a thing
---
cant find
---
On 1.12 one isn't really clearly better than the other. In dungeons both don't really have an interesting rotation I think, but they both perform well. In raiding it's the same. In PvP the mage has more of a control playstyle, using slows, snares, blink, polymorph, combined with burst. The lock on the other hand has good cc in the form of fear, but relies much more on being somewhat tanky, having heals, and while the chaos of battle is going on having those DoTs ticking and pets chasing your opponent.
---
Where's the mage portal to Org?
---
I think it's good to have unreal expectations. However, it will be humourous when people realize they may not hit 60 before burning themselves out
---
I remember running around getting so frustrated I could never find anything.  Good times, good times.
---
I would go shaman or lock. In vanilla mage is the more popular rdps class, there will not be too many locks especially early on(they get better later in the game). It is extremely valuable to have a dependable lock who can summon all the lazy people to raids and stuff. Don't worry about shards, its fairly easy to keep your bags full of them. Shaman has one of the higher skill ceilings but they are strong and valuable even if you don't know what to do. They also do strong burst damage and have a lot of utility.
---
Should have made it while waiting in queue! ;)
---
lol PvE
---
but yeah I could hoof it over there and try for it but hardly seems worth it

Priest isn't bad at all, as long as you take wand specialization and spirit tap.   
---
Shaman does give you a lot of options, but most of the time you'll only be using a small part of their kit.  And you'll access more of it as you level, so it shouldn't overwhelm you all at once.
---
And I thought Chuck Norris jokes were only on the FRENCH Barrens chat...
---
I don't know what's the relationship between Chuck Norris and the Barrens, but apparently this was a global phenomenon.
---
Jed + Rend runs are way easier to find than full UBRS runs. The only drop for healers in that entire dungeon is the Briarwood Reed trinket, and then of course every Warrior and Rogue just wants Dal'rend's. You have all of the essential roles covered just from those classes.
---
If it weren't for the competition, farming your T0 chest would be harder than farming Dal'rend's + Briarwood Reed.
---
The monster ultra was a nice touch lol

---
&gt; Production
---
This needs to be better defined.  No way this is against TOS.
---
Also in retail you pull a pack of mobs, the tanks hold agro no problem, the priest spams the same healing ability, and all dps just spam their AOE button. You save cooldowns for Leeroy JR who accidentally pulled 3 packs and then you progress even faster. And I want to say, much more trash mobs too? Sunken Temple I remember felt endless. Even Wailing Caverns felt crazy long.
---
I'm not an alliance member but even I would not call them piles.
---
mage op
---
Joana is not the bad guy and i think its fair to have a price tag on his guide. But a subscription? That is the weirdest  decision for a leveling guide. That might have made sense in vanilla, where addons and guides were mostly crap. But now its a super outdated way to do it. A guide like that is something id perhaps use sporadically over a long period of time. Id never pay a monthly sub for something like this. 
---
Especially when addon makers are making leveling tools for free already. Look at azerothian auto pilot for instance. an in game addon that tells you where to go, what to pick up, where to pick it up and exactly how to do it. With arrows and everything. For free.
---
In my opinion he needs to make it a flat fee, right now. Before its too late. Because that id actually buy. I really want this guy to succeed.
---
&gt;its warlocks are THE lowest dps. Beating out cat druids, ret paladins, oomkins, and enhancement shamans.

Since you seem interested, I'm a cardiac surgery ICU nurse. 
---
We encourage patients to get out of bed as early as six hours after getting off of the ventilator. Generally the next day we want you to walk at least three times. Then five to six times the next day, basically increasing until you are going home. The average person receiving a non-complicated surgery should be home within 3-5 days. As for weight restrictions, we limit you to ten pounds for the first four weeks or so. 
---
Most of the post-OP recovery revolves around allowing your sternum to heal considering it was just cut in half. So no mowing the lawn, vacuuming or walking a dog for example. Anything that would cause undue stress on your chest should be avoided.
---
Feel free to ask if you want to know anything else!
---
Which generation is op?
---
Literally spit coffee at this answer. It was like Pat Chapin's quip on how to bluff a counter spell: "Have cards in hand and mana open" 
---
Sometimes it is just that simple.
---
what the actual fuck lol
---
I forgot they even existed.  People need to relax, we're 5 days out goddammit.
---
Not sure if you are talking about the web guide of the guidelime guide. In either case though you will have to manually check the lower level quests.
---
The support for this idea generally comes from the fact that there was a ton of "cut" and unreleased content from Vanilla that could easily be used to extend the longevity of Classic without deviating too much from Vanilla themes. There's obviously a limit to what you can do with Classic+ without defeating the purpose of the project in the first place.
---
I have no idea what \*Game\* to play until Classic is released, is this post still for me?
---
While it certainly doesn't go overlooked, I think another large contributing factor was mob difficulty. Even the video pays homage to Defias pilagers.
---
In Vanilla, each new mob area can feel engaging to a new player because they have to guage how strong a mob is, and be on the lookout for any patrolling mobs. Often times aggroing one can mean death or at the very least, a difficult time.
---
Because of this, it made grouping with players that much more valuable. Even if the player is bad, they usually have an understanding that aggroing extra mobs = bad by the time they hit level 15+. The extra body is incredibly helpful both in terms of killing mobs, as well as minimizing eating/drinking downtime, almost regardless of the player's skill.
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4JQje3NGe4) will always be one of my favorites. There's no commentary and yet it's so effective at getting it's point across.
---
DLL injectors are **absolutely bannable**. Not necessarily in terms of their behavior (harmless shaders), but rather their method, which involves modifying the game client.
---
Ehh, legally he could get around that, because he could say the sub is for the website itself, which has other merits.   However, blizz could do w/e they want, because it's their TOS, and they can interpret it anyway they want.
---
Sweet. Can I change the text color for resists?
---
You're not entitled to someone elses work you idiot. The guy can do whatever the fuck he wants with his guide, personally I'm gonna find other guides because I wont pay for one
---
But instead it makes me think they entire game is like that so why would I pay when I can just go play something else that's actually engaging.
---
Ah ok. That makes the data a bit more concrete.  
---
Fair enough. Lotta people signing up for the tough grind.
---
That's a good one! I'll add to my comment, Thanks!
---
Blizzard has never monitored chats and ban people, that would be ridiculous. Blizzard does however respond to enough reports of the same nature, and now they have automation to Temp-Mute people, for better or for worse. 
---
As for overall attitude, no they will not do anything because someone is being mean to you. If someone is using racial slurs, sure that will get resolved, but it’s an online game with anonymous people. People will be people, and Blizzard has better things to do
---
The biggest overarching story is the Onyxia conspiracy. She’s behind most of the conflict in the Eastern Kingdoms in one way or another.
---
Only if you try to whisper them, as far as I'm aware.
---
Sure, but he doesn't deserve people buying it. If he can convince enough people to pay him a few dollars, cool. However, it has nothing to do with how much time or effort he put into it. It's all about whether people feel it's worth spending a few dollars for. With the proliferation of free guides, including his, he's going to need a lot more then "But I spent a lot of time on this!" to make it worthwhile to the majority of people.
---
This is correct.  I went back and found in in patch notes for 3.2.  that's a lot later than I remember :(

Is this elitism or really hardcore RP? He didn't avoid you because you're bad or rogues are bad potentially. I always love and remember these crazy little interactions.

this is reddit in a nutshell
---
Hmm that depends on how high the boss HP is and if they adjust enrage timers. You could end up making it so people MUST play the optimal classes. Anything else would be so slow, you can't kill bosses you would have normally been able to.
---
Also the replace with murloc movie titles etc

---
Yes, once the Nightfall axe is available, a raid might want a dps paladin using it.  Seal of righteousness holy damage counts as an extra auto attack for procs so nightfall works pretty well on them.
---
[deleted]
---
I'm a big fan of tauren for shaman. Nova totem, war stomp, elemental mastery into CL+shock is a real dead melee. If it's up, it's guaranteed value against any melee - your orc stun resist is just variable and might not proc at all.
---
IMO it's better to have a way to get guaranteed burst (a huge strength of shaman) rather than a variable way to not get stunned. One wins you the fight, and it's better to play to win rather than to not lose.

I don't think you're understanding the process for how people spell out things with their SKELETONS? and not their corpses.

Corpse aren't the problem, each player only has one corpse. The problem is with the skeletons since they used to leave behind a skeleton upon each death, thus adding up to numerous skeletons after numerous deaths. The fix is for each player to only to leave behind 1 skeleton, and upon your second death, your first skeleton will disappear which makes your latest death your only skeleton.
---
Would your tone of changed if OP started with "A friendly reminder" You think there's any difference?  You can't just safely set yourself up to tell OP to stop.
---
Theoretically yes, but practically you have lots of options to survive full rogue stunlocks even in early vanilla. Later on you can even dispel stuns with potions. Also, I wouldn‘t be proud of winning fights because of an RNG racial but to each their own I guess.

Oh, ok. I guess you just gave me a reason.

Help me out guys, im really torn between mage and priest (disc/holy). I'll be pvping all the way along classic, engaging in world pvp and doing a shitload of bgs and AV at 60. Will be playing quite a bit with a rogue friend. Will also do the necessary raiding for complementary loot.
---
I kinda wanna go priest wich has been my main on retail for a while, but the idea of missing on duels, exciting 1v1s and solo bgs being fun instead of always being an easy target and CC magnet is killing me, whereas mages are kings in these regards. Can any pvp priest comment on these dilema?
---
1.  Pick up the first quest I see.
---
3.  Level 60!
---
For shaman 21/0/30 is a pvp build that can heal in raids just fine but lacking mana tide will hurt slightly only if you are put in a caster group depending on you to not go OOM. But with the improvement of mana stream talents, you can use [The enamoured Water Spirit] which acts pretty much like half rank Mana Tide Totem, and with a shorter CD and no mana cost. 
---
Anyway, the 21/0/30 shaman build is a build that focuses on healing and shock damage as you don't have the cast time reduction making lightning spells as good as they should be.  So you max out convection, clear casting, and reverberation and grab elemental fury and eye of the storm.
---
I would recommend as a shaman full on ele resto (~30/0/~20) if you were to go that route, but to each their own.
---
My NE Druid feels disconnected from the real world and the people in it and want's to travel to reconnect with the real world and real people after thousands of years asleep.

Winterspring.... grinding on owlbeasts.
---
But you have to think, where is the initial goal coming from? For the first few weeks people wont be spending 5g on mats when they are saving for mounts
---
Don’t understand why you’re getting downvoted. Monks were a massive mistake &amp; don’t fit at all into the Warcraft 3/Classic fantasy. Next these guys will be saying Classic should have Pandas
---
blammo!
---
It is treated as a PVP server with roleplay rules, so 1 faction.
---
Just one, it'll be treated like any other PvP server just with the RP naming convention rules added on.
---
What makes you think he wants to be a streamer? Why does everyone keep saying this.
---
He has streamed (counting the vod he has been streaming) a total of 508 hours this year. That’s roughly 2 hours a day which is, again, is including streaming a vod.
---
Maybe he doesn’t care about twitch, which it certainly seems like he doesn’t.
---
I played a mage in vanilla.
---
It's probably the best ranged DPS long term. PvP it can do pretty well in groups, and if you know how to kite properly, it can do well solo too. Very much in demand for dungeons and 5 man. Not a ton of competition for certain gear pieces. 
---
Levelling is tough though. Once you get Dire Maul access, I did frost aoe levelling in the DM side with those non-elite plant mobs at the start of the dungeon, lets you go in and out and reset easily. It's not fun though and when you're in world there's a good amount of downtime. You can make up for it by aoe grinding, but there will be a lot of competition for mobs especially at launch.
---
Isn’t there a hunter trainer in old town?
---
I actually love that this part of the game is coming back. The tier sets were cool, but I remember (at least on Feathermoon) they were pretty rare to see. I loved seeing the hodge podge gear we'd all try to get together. Plus if someone did have full Tier sets you knew they grinded for them.
---
Gave my twitch prime to Joana a few days ago due to planning on using his guides for launch. Now this happens and I guess I won't be using his guides. Would have been a great option - will not be giving my future twitch primes to him.
---
Where is the legend? Seems like there are 2 hunter pet trainers??
---
I'm the big jealous if this is real! Go into it blind my guy. Enjoy the game, and dont worry to much about getting to cap quickly. You'll have so much fun! Goodluck!
---
OPs comment was about how subscription models prey on people forgetting to cancel them. Both legitimate and illegitimate companies benefit from that.
---
Don't get me wrong, the first rag kill on Classic will be a semi-big deal and impressive in the time commitment taken.  But strategically, nah, that ship has sailed.
---
The fun about it is that Org has levels above ground, where Stormwind is a plato.

It's such a gem, great meme too
---
But where is the master of cheese?
---
Posted last week but didn’t get a response.
---
Still torn between orc lock or shaman for my first toon. 
---
I don’t mind healing in raids as long as shamans are interactive and fun. The main thing that pulls me away from lock is what seems to be the boring shadowbolt raid rotation, am I overthinking that aspect? I know locks bring a lot more to the table for utility but I still want to be enjoying any raiding experience I have.
---
Also with my schedule being tight raiding won’t be super consistent so I will be enjoying a fair amount of pvp. 
---
A push to either side would be helpful, thanks!
---
Or you could answer my question. I don't deal in hypotheticals.
---
Maybe with an addon.
---
High Overlord Saurfang begs to differ, but to each their own I guess.
---
&gt;Thrall once dared High Overlord Saurfang to punch a wall in the cleft of shadow.  The result is known today as the Rage Fire Chasm.
---
*If you do with people that are at least a bit smart its a walk in the park.*  
---
But if you do with a bunch of "*hey I got to sleep in 30 mins*" "*guys, I need to get back to work*" "*my dog is biting the chair, I need to make a strawberry pie*" "*hey I'm not in the mood for raid this week, I think it will fail*" and you are in for a **treat**.  
---
But don't worry you will always do with these people because 95% of the guilds will disband or be small and don't have enough raiders to do and will have to pug.   
---
Ever done a pug in vanilla? Its a **shitfest**. People randomly running, the RL in training is screaming in ventrillo "holy fuck you guys are stupid", "don't pull you fuck! wait for the priest to get mana back" "good lord how can you be so fucking dumb, let the hunters pull if you can't".  
---
*I only believe that 30-40% of guilds clearing naxx in 2 years if the server lasts for 5 - 7 years*.
---
[Here it is](http://dl.free.fr/nBSpZaU2O). You just gotta hit "Valider et télécharger le fichier" for the download to begin.
---
I’m not using one. I plan to play as much as I can finding my own way but I’m not naive or dumb enough to think I won’t need to have a bit google now and then to help me out and keep the process going. Honestly I think I’d get bored following an arbitrary guide, like I’m playing someone else’s version of the game. I get why people do it though; just isn’t my cup of tea.
---
You need to read more then
---
I’m just using Questie. Every leveling guide gets extremely swamped at each quest, and most of them are made on dead servers with no competition. 
---
It reminds me of video guides that tell you how profit on the AH off of X item, then it’s no longer viable because everyone does it
---
If you have a 5-man group how are going to be leveling together from start to finish, have synchronized timetables so they will all be online at the same time - it avoids any and all competition. You need a perfect group comp for AOEing the dungeon effectively to keep up in xp/hr.
---
Otherwise solo/duo.
---
With no modifiers or talents:  
---
**Healing Touch**  
---
800 mana over 3.5 seconds for a 2677hp heal.  
---
**Greater Heal**  
---
710 mana over 3.0 seconds for a 2194hp heal.
---
Yeah.. as if I'm able to smile the day before.
---
is anyone else gunna read quests and fish while leveling??????  
---
talents??? sorry lol I'm not a min maxer
---
The jump!
---
But, now this is important, will Chuck Norris allow that?
---
Classic needs more keybinds than other expansions? Holy fuck youre clueless. Classic doesnt even have focus binds. You are dumb.
---
And then it's your 5th alt which you levelboosted because you had it laying around and you just feel...Awkward.
---
This whole thing also falls apart if you've just played Legion and leveled 1-110 since you kinda *haven't* done those things. Blizz doesn't really allow you to redo these types of raids in any way.
---
Would love for that to change, btw. FFXIV does this far better, although their MSQ is...Far from perfect.
---
&gt;High Overlord Saurfang and Chuck Norris once got in a fight about who was to occupy Orgimmar. Chuck Norris was nowhere to be found.
---
&gt;There is an herb named arthas' tears.  Notice there is no herb named Saurfang's tears.
---
&gt;High Overlord Saurfang's Cleave has no maximum range.
---
&gt;Children wear Chuck Norris Pajamas to bed. Chuck Norris wears High Overlord Saurfang pajamas to bed.
---
Lot of people dismissing this as something so small, but I remember this change pretty well, as it was also pretty recent. It was awesome to see a mass grave of skeletons like this, it added to the RPG element of the game. Without it it's just... lame
---
3 seems like it would just get you into trouble too - just block/gkick.
---
Blizz has stated in no uncertain terms you can't charge for anything related to addons. It was a big deal back in Wrath when the Peggle devs were thinking of adding more games as addons that you had to buy.
---
I know for a fact that they did because I used to fall down relatively often.
---
If the bosses end up having the same TTK then why would you need to adjust enrage timers?
---
yea its certainly not perfect. For locks it says Green Lens for helm. But it doesnt mention you specifically want Shadow Wrath on it for a random enchant
---
Uh I thought we were #NoChanges
---
&gt; youtube is not locked behind paywalls. Just like sub only streams wouldve been

&gt; This is from blizzards own legal pages. ( https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal )
---
Cool, it still doesn't trump copyright law. That stuff is in their to protect them, it's not a hard line.
---
&gt; Effect upon Works Value
---
The closer you get to using someone else’s creative works for your monetary or commercial gain, the less likely you are to be protected under fair use.
---
&gt; Nature of Copyrighted Work
---
Since copyright doesn't protect the idea of the work, just the exact work itself, the less creative the work, the more likely it is deemed fair use. However, just because the facts themselves are not protected, doesn’t mean the arrangement of the fact isn’t. As a general rule, it is more likely to be considered fair use the more factual than creative the copied work is.
---
Hmmm.. Guide isn't using screenshots as any part of the value proposition, so he's not profiting directly from having screenshots or other random visuals. Hmmm... It's more a factual informatary work than creative.
---
Oh look, Fair Use.
---
Well, your BiS isn't really pre-raid, since you won't raid as an arms warrior.  More so, you won't be using the DPS PvE gear in PvP since it's a mix of leather/mail/plate armor.  Basically, look for pieces of plate with stam on it if you can.  Stronghold Gauntlets for disarm immunity is good.  
---
You only need 5% hit for PvP.  PvE BiS will have 9% or 6% if you have a racial weapon skill.  +Weapon skill, as far as I know, doesn't work in PvP since you don't have glancing blows.  But not sure on the +hit, if you get any being 1 level above.
---
Your weapon is going to be an Arcanite Reaper by far.
---
&gt; As a casual player, I expect it to take me 3-4 months to hit 60,
---
You might just be into phase 2 at that point already.  So really, your grind at level 60 is going to be quick to get gear, but I would work towards your rank 7, 8 and 10 rewards for the blue armor set.  Get an Arcanite Reaper as your weapon.  Probably getting Valor pieces will be good enough to fill in what you don't have as it has str/agi/stam on it, is plate, has bonus stats.
---
Looking awfully Shimmery.
---
I know... I’m going to literally do a full 24 the first day. Then the next like 3/5 try to do 10-15 hours. I know I’m not getting to 60, I just want to be way up there sooner than later. I know I’m not gonna have time after alittle.played vanilla and wow up to WoD so that’s good, I know the world well lol

I'm not mad you're dumb donations aren't donations, when you donate to a person that is taking the money for himself and saying this money is going to me and my stream and you're supporting me by donating to me that's being upfront and honest and people donate to him for that
---
If you have a company that says we're taking donations to help people eat better and live better around the world and then you find out that they're not using money for that but that's why you donated yeah that creates a different situation and there have been prosecution's because of those situations. A twitch streamer will never get prosecuted for taking donations every one thats donating to that person knows what they're donating
---
Sorry that I'm smart? Not sorry that you're dumb
---
That constant push forward is what made me quit the first time, it's not going to change. My hope (probably not a possibility though) would be some kind of server progressions with the ability to move toons from Classic to TBC ect  If they start progressing the Classic into expansions because of those that rushed to the cap, it's no different than playing retail ;/
---
You can has cheezburger
---
Maybe because they want to play with lgbtq more often ? Make lgbtq friends ? It's not your your benefit you ignorant turd.
---
ok but how many? how many spots are there going to be if each guild only lets one ret paladin into their raid? There are going to be a lot of sad Paladins in the future I think
---
There are definitely not any Warlock trainers in the Night Elf areas.  You'd have to go back to IF or SW.
---
Furthermore, he did this EXACT thing with his previous guide.
---
I hope they switch the mats needed so horde needs alliance mats and alliance need horde mats, just so people dont stockpile it or hardcore guilds finish the war effort in a week.
---
Well to be fair a Best in Slot list should only list the best in every slot. What you describe is a more expanded itemization list. Sorry for being pedantic, you are obviously right in that your way is more useful. I think people like these BiS lists because it gives them a dream to strive for.

Mage is much better with worse gear, if that helps your decision.
---
It's likely because we all crave social interaction and approval on some level. In the gaming community, hype for new games is not unheard of, but it's often frowned upon to some degree because the hype almost always exceeds the actual game.
---
In WoW classic, we already know what we're getting. Almost everyone excited about it is completely aware what they're getting, and so there's a more wholesale excitement sweeping through the community. Not just for the game, but for the social sharing in our mutual love for the game and its atmosphere.
---
I don't agree with the first part, as eventually streamers move on and so do their audience.
---
The second part is spot fucking on though.  Like lemmings off the cliff.

I just you know do quests and maybe look up which zones suck major dick doe I’m guessing I’m doing most of them anyways
---
Loot everything and vendor it, it's not like Runescape where 1 or 2 gp is worthless, every copper adds up.
---
Also maybe look into what spells are absolutely nessisary to upgrade while you level so you can save gold until level 60
---
I absolutely agree that people should play however they want to. But they should also be aware that if they roll a spec that isn't good at what they want to do, they *will* have difficulty finding a raid group. Thats just how it is.
---
There is no "y" sound
---
Although early game might not be the funnest thing in the world, stick thru it learn your character, set him up how your comfortable playing (keybinds macros) google up and you’ll find a lot of guides on anything you wish to know more about.
---
Nah as a non buyer I get it. Some people enjoy classic but don't have the excessive amount of time to farm large amounts of gold. I don't like secondary gold economy but I get why people do
---
&gt; I don’t post on reddit a lot.

maybe you should keep it that way.

It might be fun to make an alt on that server for the popcorn moments, but I will be making my main on another sever for sure.

If you are racing for world first, you are going to ignore pvp.

Sorry but that's reality. People at the front of the pack, don't want to stop to pvp, or have the chance of needing to corpse run. They are going to ignore the other faction completely.

You looking at the raw data?

Fuck guides.  I play the way I want to.

it shows those.  it tells you everything.   seems like the Classic version is not complete, so we'll have to see how quickly they finish/polish it.  But it makes it very easy.
---
My buddy would badger people like this all the time in vanilla. He’d pester players selling BoE’s in chat and somehow actually get them to sell to him for way under priced. Then he’d flip it on the AH. He truly had a gift.

"emp run" is the preferred term

What? That's the best one! No way is it worse than those crusty quillboar dungeons or gnomer.

I was once asked to buy something like 1000g for my baby brother so he could get an epic world drop from the AH. He received 1100 because he had to wait for them to grind it. Took quite a while IIRC.

This community seems to think that we can do something about it by being vigilant. It would stand to reason that we could do something about hateful shit if we also stood up against that.

This is what I was saying at the beginning. If we had people who gave half as much of a shit about stuff that actually impacts other people's lives as they did about gold sellers, the community would be a much better place.

---
That's basically the only time I used it when in vanilla.  The method worked a lot better on private servers than in classic wow.  It requires tons of space to make it work right and aggroing extra mobs while trying to hamstring kite is a real issue in classic.

This is so terribly true. As much as I like to tell myself I'll be able to balance an additional 15 years accumulated responsibilities with Naxx raiding, I know it's a lie. Instead I try and pick my class based on realistic goals. What class/role am I happy with who hits 60 late, can perform decent in their R10 pvp gear + crafted + rep gear, and can maybe run some ZG/AQ20 raids for additional gear.
---
good point of view, will need to think a bit more about my futur I guess.
---
The true context is he created this guide over 10 years ago and he's made a few changes to it to update it. He's already made a bunch of money off of the bulk of the information that's in this guide 10 years ago around 2 million dollars if I'm not mistaken. The problem is this Joanna guy seems to think he's exempt from the basic rules of the internet. If you release something and make it available people are going to steal it and make it more available probably for free. If it wasn't you and I wouldn't be able to have this conversation openly we would be getting censored. But you don't understand that. So it seems even though you tune into his stream you are still out of the loop. You can't release something for free on the internet and then try to lock it down later. That's no different than politicians having embarrassing photos of them put on line and then fighting to have them taken down and successfully getting them taken down but other people saved them and repost it. Were you born yesterday?

What is up with the edgy posts today
---
IDGAF about skeletons. Play the damn game and stop crying. There are dozens of us!
---
&gt;I'd like you to see you press ctrl f while spinning your camera and moving forward faster than I can.
---
Moving forward is literally just one finger. ctrl+f is two fingers. You could easily do this with your keyboard hand and still have one finger and your thumb free.
---
&gt; I use the same 12 keys all within mm of eachother for 32 combos
---
Sorry, but this just sounds cumbersome and terrible, especially in PvP. It's so much easier to divide keybindings across 4 fingers and a thumb rather than a single thumb. On a keyboard you can even set your fingers up for your next keybinding while still waiting to do the previous one, which means you're faster and more consistent than anyone who has to move their thumb even if it's only a few mm.
---
There are also WAY more keybindings available on a keyboard. 1-6, q-t, a-g, and z-v with shift and control modifiers give you 57 options after subtracting movement keys.
---
If you prefer using an mmo mouse that's cool, but don't act like you're better than anyone else because of it.

My original WoW character was a priest. I made it to level 51 before I rerolled Warrior. There were so many bad tanks at release that I just couldn’t do it anymore.

And a lot of people get really touchy about the fact that streamers make money.
---
Having a large sample size doesn't matter if there is a selection bias. This survey is only being filled out by reddit users that visit this sub, so there will be a huge bias.
---
Gold buying/selling in general is nearly impossible to enforce. The question wasn't him saying he wanted it to be against the rules but simply asking to have it clarified. This is an extremely common situation in the RuneScape communities, Jagex simply allows the 'exchanging' of the two currencies, but you do so at your own risk.
---
Yes they do monitor to a fairly decent extent.  However this isn't like League of Legends where there are 10 people in a match and it's easy to look at logs.  Think of hundreds of thousands of players coming through zones , and how many layers of chat there are and sifting through that.  In my experience, they tend to be a lot harsher with things like general chat where many people can see it and don't necessarily want to leave it due to it's public nature.  I have also seen people get banned for things said in private channels.  So take it for what it's worth.  Don't be an idiot and utilize the /ignore function.

Was. With Route optimizations and dungeon grinding I expect this to fall between 3D16hrs and 4D. Expecially with dedicated viewers, you can prob get a super grind stack like 4 mages even without being the "optimal" class for grind leveling(aka they can always get carried by viewers).
---
Dassa toilet?
---
It's almost as if different players do different damage. But there's more than enough for to show the difference.
---

is way better since it lets you filter things by where they come from. For pre-raid BIS I have mine set to only show items you get from Quests and Dungeons.
---
Line of Sight in WoW refers to a mob not being able to see you.  If they can't see you, they run to you to attack you.  So in this case I mean range attack the mob then hide behind something, so they are forced to run to you.  This brings all the mobs to you (even ranged/caster mobs, since they can't see you to cast/attack you).  Helps get them all grouped up around you so you can keep threat on them all.

Isn't it already one?

I was super excited to find this out too!  I guess it's been common knowledge to some people for a while, but I just learned last week.
---
Lol this is the dumbest argument to defend toxicity, yet it's such a common one. Just because there's an ignore button doesn't mean it's ok for you to be a complete shit bag to people online.
---
Didn't know you had to deal with layering in 2005. 
---
The zone has a virtual player cap with layering.
---
Wait I'm out of the loop here. Would someone mind catching me up?
---
Gotcha, didn’t know that, thank you. Still seems like the whole thing could’ve used a different approach, but ultimately doesn’t affect me much.
---
I’d highly recommend against leveling a Tauren in Durotar. It’s incredibly suboptimal. Not only do you waste time running there, but you also can’t equip any of the quest reward weapons. Just wait the 2-3 hours to meet up at XR, and joke around in voice chat.
---
hunter is better than both of them. 
---
watch this video and youll see why

I'm assuming he will be improving it over time and you get the improved version.  You can also pay the 5, take screenshots and get out
---
Go Shaman! Shamans are loved by all and have tons of utility.
---
Indeed, less useful otherwise.
---
&gt;  especially if you are on a higher pop server.
---
Yeah, we're all fucked.
---
lmao
---
Depends on how you like to play the game. I am choosing warlocks because I plan to do a lot of solo questing until raiding time. If you like to dungeon level then mages seem to be better suited for that.

The idea is that they want to play with people who aren't going to make their identity a problem. In other words they want people like you to see it and play on a different server since you obviously have an issue with it.

I want a play a Shaman, but I'm worried that I'll get eaten alive leveling on a PvP server. What do you guys think?
---
If I was planning on PvPing heavily then yah stoneform is a better racial, but if im making a pve Hunter I take the nature resist. Not to mention shadowmeld for PvP
---
Inflation both helps and hurts you. You get more money for your stuff but you pay more for stuff you need. If you are already at top level it doesnt affect you much I guess, but its not good for new players. Also you could say it gives players with money to buy gold an actual tangible advantage to other players who earn their gear and stuff.
---
Yeah, thats what I'm saying. When someone is being toxic and hurting my feelings even though I'm tough, I know for sure they are hurting other peoples feelings so they should be banned.
---
Hakkar, yeah that was it. Well I played a priest named Alune for a bit but never actually hit 60. Pretty sure I remember you and some gnome mage who I think either rerolled to a Tauren Shaman or from a Tauren Shaman at one point?
---
&gt; what is the point of having an LGBT server
---
At no point is Thalnos designated an LGBTQ+ server. Any user is more than welcome to roll there. Any LGBTQ+ user is also more than welcome to roll elsewhere. Same as every Swedish user is not forced to roll on Gehennas, nor is that server exclusive to Swedes.
---
However, a community of LGBTQ+ players reached out and wanted to know if we can make note that they were intending to roll on  Thalnos, incase other LGBTQ+ players want to play with like-minded users.
---
Darkness, my old friend?
---
So, pay the 5 bucks,take screenshots.  Done.  Really that hard to do?
---
If you want to heal you need to put a bunch of points into Holy. If not then I'm not sure what sort of build this is supposed to be because it's not deep enough into Shadow to be DPS, either.
---
I mean he made 3mill when he sold physical copies of his guide @ $37/ea. If you do the subscription, you have over 7 months to get to 60 before it costs the same as phsyical copy. I think most people would get to 60 before then.
---
It's not a tradition, it is a series of events that can be taken as evidence. If you seriously can't tell it apart then I'm very sorry for you.
---
Lol ok
---
I would imagine that they need to pick a server to form those guilds on
---
Give me an hour.
---
Why do any of that when you can just trade your retail gold for classic gold? :)
---
Wow. 
---
Do you hate gay clubs at colleges or gay bars or literally any other example of this? Seriously so ignorant. Just because you dont care who you're playing with maybe theres online gay nerds who would prefer to play with other gay nerds? Why do you find this so difficult?

Fresh server requires a fresh bucket.
---
To make $5 from ads you would need at least 5-7000 people visiting the website not running adblock.  From my experience at least 50% of people do so in practical terms to earn $5 you would need around 15k visits to the website.
---
So assuming at least 1 out of every 15k people that would have visited his site pays the $5 he is going to come out ahead.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
It's interesting to see how many people will speak their primary language vs English.
---
No, Activision-Blizzard does not care.
---
Its full of heffaclumps
---
Continue building off classic using similar item scaling, no daily quests, etc.  
---
Make a new classic raid after Naxx.
---
Exactly. That's smart. Why do you think hotels raise the price of there rooms right before conventions. Capitalism

That's not an honest statement concerning what I said. I said it was hubris (arrogant) for him to make guides for something he did not play.

Wouldn't this be similar to the same situation but between servers? Player A gives Player B 100k on Illidan, in exchange Player B gives Player A 120k on Mal'ganis. I can't see them enforcing rules against this type of transfer unless it becomes a massive problem.

The stupid thing is that gold farmers will still be able to accomplish their goal, though it will be more difficult.  They basically get 10 skeletons per account.

They could have at least allowed 3 skeletons per character if the randomized skeleton placement was too hard to achieve.

No, you have to run to one.

Thank you so much !

Source for this claim?

You think you want it as a meme, but you don’t
---
Just make sure you have a 2h vs cloth and shield vs melee/ hunter and you can win vs all classes.
---
I think this is the major difference that a lot of people have failed to acknowledge. The game hasn't changed the game's not easier it's the fact that people are more organized this type of game has been around for longer allowing people to congregate get there teamwork more on point and get better at deciphering the strategies of boss fights. Years ago it was definitely very difficult to get people together and not only that but get good people back then everybody was new to The game everyone was trying to get good, now there's going to be entire groups of people that go into classic wow already knowing the boss fights already knowing how long it takes to clear dungeons already knowing the Mechanics for all the fights already knowing where to get all the items and weapons. And that's fine there's nothing wrong with that I'm not in any way complaining but that is the reality of it it's not going to be quite the same experience that we all remember if you were there back in 2004, the only way they could make it closer is if they somehow didn't allow add-ons at all. I would actually be a huge fan of this version of classic wow not allowing any kind of add-on we've all played while long enough to know the key aspects of the game. The reason you couldn't have bag add-ons or a damage meter is because then that would open the floodgates for all add-ons. I'm sure there aren't many people that feel the same way I do I know a lot of people like a convenient way to play but I really wanted to enjoy classic the way it was and back in the day there weren't add-ons yet. They showed up but they took a little bit of time and they were not nearly as refined or nearly as many add-ons as there are today. I remember when a quest helper out on chemo back in the day and they blizzard tried to ban it because they saw it as cheating.

It is not, 12-60 alliance only includes Hunters. 12-60 Horde includes Hunter, Warlock, Warrior and Druid.

Based on the data coming in, I'm guessing most people just put their nationality in the language question because there's nowhere else to answer that and "represent" your server.
---
Just look at Gehennas... no way will 15% be speaking scandinavian languages in-game (other than guild chat and whisper).
---
Stuck between Hunter/Warlock/Mage
---
Want to be mainly BG's/WPVP, but want to be able to hop into raids when I can as well.
---
Then do it bro.  Whole point is to enjoy the journey
---
That’s exactly my point. What you are saying is absurd. Exploration and making friends still happens whether you use a guide or not.
---
All a leveling guide is going to do is help you fill in the gaps and actually know how to proceed from zone to zone, things you’ve learned from leveling over and over again.
---
Don’t pretend that you never used wowhead or google when you got stuck.
---
Where can i find  the Firemaw discord? Please link :)
---
Get me a 10-slot bag!
---
Okay.  What are you saying?  I don't understand what you're getting at.  Is English not your first language?
---
You're saying they have a tradition of making one change after another. You cannot possibly be saying anything else.
---
The fact these events happened doesnt mean futther ones will unless you want to commit that fallacy.
---
It's too expensive to live on the West Coast to sink money into WoW.
---
Who doesn't play with talents though? Spiritual healing, spiritual guidance. You also have improve healing that basically reduces the mana cost of your heal spells by 15%. Mana is a huge thing to take in consideration. If you start spamming healing touch you'll be oom in seconds. Priests are just far superior when it comes to dungeon/raid healing because of this.
---
Yeah, that part I have an issue with. All I was saying in defense of the guy was about the getting lost part. I don't know how it still happens to me, but I get discombobulated at times with directions. Even places I know.
---
I will report anyone I know who buys gold/leveling. Be sure not to tell them you're opposed to it though cause then they might not share.
---
Makes sense thanks for the quick and well articulated reply!
---
BRO. How many different sauces you think are on that mouse?
---
If a player can only speak Spanish, it's important for them to find other users who will be speaking Spanish.
---
Why would it be important for me to put my primary language is Spanish or from a Latin region, if I am intending to only really speak English in-game?
---
Also known as Pennsyltucky. 
---
I’ve heard Pennsylvania described as Philly in the east, Pittsburgh in the west, and Alabama in the middle.
---
It is launching in the USA at 6pm EST/ 3pm PST on the 26th.
---
Adjust based on CST difference.
---
I'd take 2/2 Mana Burn. Inner Fire I've heard mixed things about so not sure about that one - seems nice until you realize how easily it can be dispelled. The other 2 are your choice but considering you're going a bit into Shadow anyway, I might just do 2 in Force of Will for a bit of extra damage.
---

The game will be released for the **majority** of the player base when its 8/27 “their time”, which will be 3pm PDT/6pm EDT for the US on the 26th.

which is perfect for a noob as it leaves plenty of room to grow while not feeling useless when you arent as good

---
A lot of that does come down to monetization.
---
Blizzard doesn't want to turn off *anyone*, which is why we have super frequent gear resets, 4 different tiers of raids, constant catchup mechanics, LFR, etc. All of that makes community less important.
---
As for class design, they made a big deal about "bring the player not the class". Of course, when all the classes perform similarly, then small differences get amplified and balance is even worse.

The quest in Loch Modan that sends you back to Ironforge on a gryphon I was really impressed, and then I got to IF and you fly through the gates and the tunnel up near the ceiling to get to the center and I lost it. It was the single coolest thing I'd ever seen seeing all the players running around inside and the huge expansive Ironforge architecture from up high.

That's what I love about this classic wow, man; I get older, it stays the same age...
---
youre not forced lol... you dont have to buy it
---
Im pretty lucky, despite being a dad I'll put an average of 6-8 hrs in a day. They might not be ultra productive all the time but at least when i hit 60 there are times where Im able to let her completely take over.
---
what are you going as?
---
We were the best guild by a fair margin on my server (Vicious Cycle Frostmane US) clearing almost everything first. Competitive on a global level in pvp and pve content, yet the grind of AQ took its toll and by the time naxx came out, we were worn out and disheveled. We couldn't clear the four horsemen. I think people are underestimating the effort it takes to keep a guild sound and happy together. Leadership is a huge deal.
---
I'm just selling every possible item for maximum token profit. Already made two on rare pets alone, too bad you can't sell rare mounts or I'd be set for years.
---
Where do you do that? Felwood?

Just meet up at lvl 10 or 12 at the Crossroads. Get your class quests and stuff out of the way

I thought it would be a good time to finish getting flying but I just couldnt do it. I made some new chars to play "classic" with. Little human warlock and undead priest.

Yeah this was my plan exactly! Thank you.

Classic is separate from wow.

Wow you can play with a sub up to legion. Have to buy BFA.
---
Classic you can play with a sub.

Sorry is "absolute ballsack" good or bad lol?

Oh the joys of being an adult with a job :D it’s not all bad!
---
what? i never said i should be able to decide when and how much money someone can make of their work?
---
i am suggesting that this was not a good idea...
---
he's absolutely welcome to charge whatever he likes for whatever service he provides. and the community is welcome to not buy it, which is what i think is largely going to happen. i am merely suggesting that it would have been smarter to think of a different way to make money off of it. 
---
the edit was there to clarify just because i think the way he chose to monetize this was not the smartest does not mean that i think he shouldn't try and monetize it.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Only the versions I've uploaded there, sorry :/
---
Nah, the experience was ruined with TBC.
---
As much as I love the core TBC gameplay loop, it still destroyed the idea of WoW being an MMORPG. You can't split an MMO between disconnected expansions.

I'm actually a fan of wearing mail and leather as a fury warrior. Really hits the Barbarian vibe for me. That said I do get why people would prefer to rock the full plate route instead

I played a LOT on my Hunter in Vanilla. 
---
The most epic piece of gear I ever got was the Wolf Head Helm or whatever it was from one of the end game dungeons that weren't even raid-level.
---
I had a Goblin Death Ray though! I remember having fun with that in the standoffs in ... Shoresomething.
---
1: Happy Cake Day!
---
2: It’s incredible that people don’t understand how Timezones (And Server Times apparently??) work.
---
some people like support creators like this who spend so much time doing something to help the community. I wont even use the guide and i'll still toss him a fiver
---
While druid has a few raid spots typically, they are undeniably rare and one of the most sought after. 
---
There's a lot druids bring to the table that cannot be replaced.
---
My guild for example has 2 druid spots, which means I will always be raiding with my guild. My gear goes mostly uncontested, as there's only one other druid in the guild. (So we get to conspire who needs what, and in what order)
---
The biggest thing I would like to highlight is the cosntant form swapping. Yes this happens in PvP, and for leveling, but in dungeons it can be a huge boon. Tank gets CCed and a mob is running at you, shift to bear and just eat the damage for a few seconds until everything is under control.
---
If it is really going to put a bad taste in your mouth, go priest.

Is there a way you can buy the guide and download it to keep? Also I agree with others a one time thing man. Fs a $5 a month sub the game is only $10? I know I sound entitled but fuck me dick move a few days before I love this guide.
---
1) If you feel comfortable navigating through town you can do that on your own and simply ignore the town steps. However, the optimal route through town is the one outlined so, for practice, it is good knowledge. We can consider developing a toggle feature that collapses all town steps into "Turn in all quests, accept all new ones, repair, train etc." However, I have no doubt people will miss things. It's human nature. Additionally, there are non-apparent things you would easily overlook if we don't inform you of them in the town steps.
---
2) The scaling of text needs to be addressed and we're on it.
---
3) We are working to condense the steps where you are doing several things at once to be more user friendly. Pictures are pretty static and old, we are working on a dynamic map which should be much better.
---
I didn't label him a "Deplorable", Reddit Pro Tools did based on his posting history.

 I downloaded the extension a while ago and it really opened my eyes about where all of the toxicity on Reddit was coming from. When you are looking at someone with at least 400 karma in subreddits like r/Braincels and r/GenderCritical then it makes sense why they are posting character attacks in whatever subreddit you are browsing. They are deplorable.

going to a website is now piracy?  This is as dumb as, "he looked at my facebook photos!  He's stalking me!"
---
He put information on the web free for all to see, and we're now looking at it.  Internet working as intended.  No one is stealing anything or copying anything.  We're going to a website.
---
lol yes, those early bag drops can really make a difference
---
It depends on your class, too.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla. On days where there wasn't much going on, I'd go try to solo or duo high-level dungeons (or at least certain boss encounters).
---
Also, you could always try to get exhalted with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
Oh wow, I've been trying to buy this mouse again but they don't make it anymore and the people selling them are listing used ones for ridiculous prices.
---
I don't have to guess what profession you're going to roll in-game then. Well done!
---
Honestly dude any mid-tier laptop will work just fine. My girlfriend is playing on an HP from 2015 with 8GB of ram and 516mb integrated graphics and it runs mint on max settings. 
---
Just look only for some bunk secondhand laptop if you really can't wait for a repair.
---
Depends where the gold comes from I think. People who buy gold from people who bot/farm are probably safe, people who receive gold from hacked accounts or people who steal CC and buy gold with tokens etc might be fucked. In vanilla it's safer.
---
I'm switching from Shazz to Firemaw for just this reason
---
Reckon if you speak to any of the folks working on Retail right now they'll have this much giddiness and passion? 'cos I don't.
---
go browse wowhead for 10 minutes without any adblocker
---
They haven't announced any expansions as of yet. They want to wait until people have gone through the current classic end game content. Then they will determine what to do based off of the communities feedback. Take that for what it is.
---
With that being said I think we will at least see the Burning Crusade expansion. If you don't have that content I can imagine they will still require a purchase. I don't see them charging people again for expansions they already own. They just want to keep subscriptions.
---
Didn't say I was going to, just that if you're going to buy it and then refund it you're basically just pirating it
---
Imagine hating on someone who wants to charge for content they have created?
---
The audacity
---
Seriously dude! It's pretty excellent.
---
if it were a really party it would have 5 dudes, 5 computers, a cat and a keg of root beer anyways so im confused why he thinks it would "get in the way."
---
Depends on the starting zone.
---
For orc warlock it is worth it, since you don't start next to mobs. 
---
For undead it's not the case since you can kill a few mobs on your way to the first quest and trainer. Not sure about alliance, never did it.
---
Having immolate right away is pretty good, you can pull 2 mobs 
---
 with immolate and while killing the first, you can again pull another with immolate. The demon skin armor buff has flat HP/5 so it is pretty good in the first levels.
---
It's nothing big obviously, but can save a bit of time when you are able to tag multiple mobs at once with dots.
---
Bad the build the OP is showing would be near useless in PvP. Probably the weakest he could have possibly selected. The only thing it does is provide exceptional raid utility while still covering the slot of a healer over a shadow priest dps.
---
If they did turn out to be the majority, would you think it should be done?
---
yeah but you can sing songs together! 
---
We're a couple of misfits

I was 20 when vanilla came out. Was single with a part time job and next to no responsibilities. I'm 34 now, married with 3 kids, a mortgage, and a full time job. I think it might be PvE for me this time around.
---
Fake News!
---
Is here is my experience - it takes somewhere in the ballpark of 240-250 hours to get to max level. Some can do it much faster, some much slower, but plan on around that amount. By the time you are max level you’ve invested a good amount of time on that class and have very slowly incorporated new abilities. You probably did some dungeons and have an idea of group dynamic. You have an idea of having to coordinate CC, finding random people to group with etc. if you are in a guild the. You should be even more comfortable grouping with people.  
---
If you want to raid in the first month cause you are racing to 60 you will most definitely be in a guild. They should know you and (hopefully) not be assholes to you for having genuine questions. If you get to 60 in Jan, Feb, March etc cause you are much more casual you may find some PUGs running and they may be a little less kind but the content should be easier cause you could have some fairly heated people with you.   
---
Ultimately there are 40 people in a raid, as long as you don’t try and be a hero, pay attention and follow raid leader instruction you should be OK. MOST fights aren’t mechanically as challenging as modern fights, the challenge comes from coordinating 40 people and having appropriate gear.
---
It says it in the quest chain that Thaurrisan essentially brainwashed her with a spell to fall in love with him, won’t spoil the ending though lol
---
I'm actually ok with this. The biggest reason i have so much passion for Vanilla is cause of things i did in the game back in 2004, friends i made back then and much more. Theres no way to ever get that feeling with classic. Its kinda like the first time u drove a car . Classic can never take that spot but it doesn't mean it wont hold their own special spot :)

Perhaps the outside is our dreary RL world looking into the beautiful world of Azeroth. This will be especially true next week.

Yea if you’re not really that invested and really just starting out. Especially after several years. I would just get the subscription and go with classic when it comes out.

Does the matchup becomes "winnable?" Of course i know every fight is winnable but i'm talking in general terms, if i play correctly can i consistently win against a good rogue? Or it goes from a 1/10 to a 2/10 chance?
---
We are working on a place saving feature for the general user. We were considering gating it behind account creation but we feel people will want to create accounts for other reasons. Possibly down the road there may be additional, non PTW, features for account users.
---
they rolled these census out like blizz rolls out new servers  
---
loads of people already filled out the one form this morning and most wont notice this is a new one
---
Wouldn't you just pull aggro?

Just show up for raids and you’ll gear out. Not everyone in the guild needs to be a leader.
---
Undead Ryan from the office.  Nice
---
Makes me sad that Joana locked his stuff behind a paywall. But, guy's gotta make extra money, I suppose.
---
I’d like to see classic be classic. They can make TBC servers and WotLK servers and just offer paid character transfers to new expansion servers. Meanwhile, they make WoW 2 or the next retail expansion or something.
---
Certainly.
---
You know I agree. By all means charge for the guide but what's the monthly sub for? Just sell it like any ebook.
---
Hunter was my main all the way until legion. Absolutely blast of a class. Aspect buffs are great, survival is great because it's weirdly fun in PVP. Traps add some utility. It's a high skill cap class as well.
---
I know there is a server on the NA servers, but obviously that's not helpful if you want to play on EU servers.
---
If there is a person trying to advocate that server as LGBT maybe you could reach out to them
---
Ironfoe?
---
Just because hunter is good a leveler doesn't mean the class is easy. Hunter is one of the most difficult classes to play in Classic. You completely missed the majority of his question.
---
So you arw suggesting sharing accounts which is against tos. I feel like a lot of people also forget that the standards have increased by a bit since vanilla
---
I think with addons like classiccodex and routes like https://www.vanilla-questing.me people will be able to level in ~5-6 days of /played, just following the guides. At ~7 hours per day, that's 17-21 of IRL time.
---
The unpredictability of how much mana it returns really reduces the worth of it. Obviously if you're raiding in MC it's worthless because you can't use fire you are just using it for the mana, but then even later on when you're fire in AQ or Naxx you're probably going to have better trinket options anyway for damage and then the mana return is just too unpredictable. If it was a guaranteed 500 mana return then yea I could see you using it on a boss fight where you find yourself needing mana, but gimping your trinket slot and then using it and getting back 40 mana...
---

id get fired for coming into work like that

This is correct
---
Impossible!
---
Only people on Reddit exist, there are no other people to play games or have opinions! ^^^^^/s
---
Whole new character, classic is a completely different game, different client, etc.
---
Why would I care about defense when I can just melt you?
---
Yeah, I loved TBC; it was my first version of WoW that I played, but if they want to expand Classic I don't want anything but Classic+. TBC's balance changes were great, but it started down the road of focusing everything on the expansion zones, flying mounts bypassing most world PvP, and having level 61 greens outmatch level 60 epics.
---
My dream of the first expansion to Classic WoW is a retelling of TBC that sticks closer to Classic's philosophy. Let the Dark Portal open but bring the threat of Illidan to us on Azeroth. Add flight paths and smash a few rocks into each other so we can explore Outland without flying. And update class balance without stripping away class identity or unique features.

Exactly LGTBQs follow daddy to Blaemuex!

Pick whatever you want. If I were going to play Alliance, I'd make a female Prot Dwarf Pally 100%. But that's just me.

UBRS buff and Paladin auras will bring you to 143 fire resistance. That's plenty for the newbies. Only Rag demands the cap.
---
There are running costs to up keeping things like that. Even just website fees. A subscription covers those costs
---
IcyVeins doesn't get it
---
at 2:49  metzen even had the thrall necklace at that point.
---
I regret buying every xpac after MOP. I'll never regret MOP though, it was a really neat expansion, even though it was the end of most of the rpg elements of the game. I believe that's when things like arrows and feeding your pets ended, stuff like that.

No one's saying you can't race people and do whatever you want, just that's it's not a world first Rag kill.  That's already happened.  It's the whole point of a world first.  It's a world first classic Rag kill, but that's about as meaningful as the world first Rag kill on any other private server.  How meaningful that is is up to you.

Would have been great with all the different scandinavians languages split up.

A: While we understand that this was a flavorful part of Original WoW and the earlier expansions, individual players leaving multiple player corpses and skeletons throughout the game world can lead to behavior such as spelling out advertisements, **hate speech, and other negative messages**. As such, this will not be a part of WoW Classic.
---
It's fairly subjective so there's not really a good or correct answer as to why, just that people are different and like different things. To me being max level is freeing.
---
nonono wrong way rogue and hunter pre-raid bis is basically warrior gear
---
I mean, it isn't hard, just time consuming.
---
Strip naked to avoid durability, run in as far as you can, die, run back as a ghost, use the large rez radius to rez a bit further than last time, die, rinse, repeat.
---
Again, no idea why we decided it was worth our time, I guess it was just to be able to say we did it.
---
he said in an interview that they sold over 90,000 physical copies of the guide, and they were selling for almost $40.00 each.
---
Not sure how the revenue got split or anything but they made a good amount of money forsure
---
Add american idiot
---
What? Most BC sets look good
---
In case you didn't see it today, he did!
---
What is this even about?
---
Yeah I literally just made my friend group all move to Skeram cuz we saw how massive Thalnos got.
---
Miss me with that launch day que time (hopefully).
---
Anyone not here raise your hand
---
i find it ironic that people want to be "elitist" about classic wow when it was literally designed as a casual MMO
---
8ball?
---
Google this: Reductio ad absurdum
---
It's crazy how venomous the politically correct crowd is.
---
It was offered freely.  Literally not piracy.
---
Three problems I had with these guides when I was testing them in Orc/Troll area.
---
1. Grind Chunk of Boar Meat and Grind Scorpid Stinger, doesn't say how many or for how long  
---
1. Dying on the bbonfire after Thwarting Kolkar Aggression sends you into the Valley of Trials, not Sen'Jin Village.  
---
1. I've been unable to find where the date for these guides is hosted (Github, Gitlab) so that I could have reported these things earlier.
---
&gt; I think its just very slightly updated 
---
lol no. Turn the video settings to Ultra and it's a fucking night and day difference.
---
Yea, where are people coming up with numbers of concurrent online players of 29k? The original hardware server caps in vanilla were around 2500-3500 if memory serves.
---
I don't think these were upgraded until TBC prelaunch? Or was it wrath?
---
It increases it by 100 for 1 minute, so 1/3 of the time.
---
Everything until the market gets balanced. You could post things at exorbitant prices and get bites or someone might undercut you, it all depends on how much money people have and are willing to spend.
---
There is the talk of Classic server Devilsaur cartels because the leather is so important for early pre-raid gear for melee.
---
There's nothing wrong with it. You have the choice not to use it
---
Shits hard but feels rewarding
---
I wish Kevin Jordan was with them, too. If you guys don't know who he is, he was the designer of basically every spell and talent from Vanilla to Wotlk and got fired after Ghostcrawler joined Blizzard, which immediately started working on Cataclysm. 
---
He has a twitch channel and regularly delivers a ton of insight on what made the game so enjoyable for many, and what didn't work as expected as well. He's also a Ret Paladin main lol
---
Relevant name
---
I'm planning on having an alt that will do all of my herbalism, mining, and fishing. What class would be best suited for this role? Thanks for all the help in advance!
---
I'd follow the leveling guide. You would most likely respec at 60 anyway because some guides might grab talents that you wouldn't need at 60. The PvP build is quite different than PvE since it's hemorrhage build. It grabs a lot of talents that are great for PvP but whatever or unused in PvE. Essentially you WILL be fine with the normal leveling combat build and PvPing. It's only at endgame PvP do you need to worry about your spec being correct.
---
While technically inaccurate I found I could relate to it.
---
It's probably less the swastikas and more the gold selling ads that would sometimes appear in capital cities.
---
I was actually trying this one because as a gnome warlock I want to visit SW for the voidwalker quest at level 10. But level 6 quests at 9 is slow xp in a crowded area... not gonna work well at launch.
---
I think there's something there with picking up Princess Must Die since it and the VW quest both bring you on a long run across Elwynn. Just gotta figure out how to delay my first trip to SW to level 10 and eliminate the level 6 quests which aren't offering me anything.
---
For the stress test I just invited the fresh lvl ones that just zoned in and once they finished the 1 few quests I left group and formed a new group that just zoned in while turning in my quests. I did this 3 times, I’m pretty sure I gained 2 lvls passively from the group killing their quest mobs. 
---
Was pretty satisfied with the results lol.
---
It is not currently offered freely.
---
If you get the Ring, do NOT forget to equip it during rend and use it for the secret on-use effect of SUMMONING A GODDAMN DRAGON!
---
Is there merit in not wanting to play a rogue based off the fact that there will be a ton of rogues? 
---
For someone who wanted to play a rogue, what are the consolation options?
---
His skill point distribution is fubar.
---
Ah yes, that one one button he presses once hes nearby an enemy that one shots them really seems like a uh, hard class.
---
It's classic bruv theres no hard classes and it's wow.
---
There actually were LFG add-ons in vanilla that just used text from custom created channels.
---
Angry gold selling nerd is angry. Sell away man, hopefully you fall on your face either way. I do not wish failure on most people but when you provide  a service to screw the community. . . yea. Next, you conveniently left out a portion of my comment. Angry nerd is real angry. So angry he is trying to twist the meaning of my comment. I said "Imagine thinking advertising doesnt help a company stay a float in this kind of arena". 
---
TL/DR - Hope you get busted over and over again.
---
If there weren't IRL repercussions I would agree with you, but there are, so I'll never understand how some people can be so miserably despicable to not give a damn about other people being hacked for their personal gain in a *videogame* (something that's NOT nearly necessary to live).
---
They should play retail, where they can legally buy all the gold they want without it affecting anyone else.
---
Where are you coming up with the numbers for Argent Dawn concurrent active users being at 29k? That's way above the server cap for the servers back then
---
what a douche lmao
---
No, if they didn’t have layering they’d still let in whatever the server cap was (not 3k) and they’d all spawn in one place. 
---
Then whenever the sever cap hit they’d have queues, not make more layers
---
A lot of people never actually played classic, so they have no idea what they're getting themselves into. I myself am playing a lock, which I also played in classic. I'm fully prepared to only be brought to raids for utility/soul shards at the beginning, but imo it's one of the best and most rewarding classes to play when you reach the end.
---
Also, even though they don't do a massive amount of damage at the start, saying locks and classes like it are "only good once naxx comes out" is kinda misinforming to new players. Classic raiding wasn't really about dishing out loads of damage. Utility and knowing the raid was way more important, and locks will always be guaranteed a spot in raids.
---
The part where the guy reveals his missing eyes and tongue got me as a kid.
---
"He took my tongue and my eyes!" D8
---
Here's a though, don't download it if you don't want to use it.
---
That's why I'm just considering playing a bear druid. Most of the BiS gear for a long, long time is all in Phase 1.
---
But stealing his/her work should not be one of those options.
---
Mount at 40 isn't terribly hard especially if you do professions as you level.
---
Hell yeah I would love that. Especially material of Jeff playing. Dude's a blast
---
I'm not actually looking for a "correct" answer, as you say it's objective. Just curious.
---
It's not like the overwhelming majority of MMOs open up at max level, and Vanilla WoW is perhaps most guilty of this. It rapidly narrows down. It's referred to as "a treadmill" for reason.
---
Bind Frostbolt to Space Bar.  Watch TV.
---
I think what I should have said is that it's frustrating to see all these people flailing in rage that somebody expects them to pay for something they want. Don't get me wrong, I am against capitalism and believe anything that is infinitely reproduceable should be freely distributed to all, but we don't live in a different world than we should and in this one griping about 5 dollars for something to help with a game you'll be paying 15 bucks a month for is stupid. Particularly, as many are quick to point out, you can get the same guides or equivalents for free. 
---
So to be clear, people are bellyaching over something they can still have for free.
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Guys how can there be 100,000 classic players if there are only 7,000 people on earth? 🤔🤔🤔
---
You can project your emotions on to me all you want bud, doesn't make them true. You're upset that I'm right and that I'm "ruining your game"
---
Which is fine. But I definitely need you to realize that you're the only one upset here.
---
All you need

I did have an HDD. I'm super looking forward to the SSD I just bought. But I went kinda crazy. New processor, new motherboard, new ram.... It has been a long time since I upgraded, so it was needed. I just hope I can have it all ready to roll by Monday :/
---
It's a fairly long trek for gnomes, all the way to the building and in the very back up the stairs.
---
It has nothing to do with the rest of the survey.
---
Or op:
---
I'm a 90kg married German who loves lasagna. My community will play on lucifron. Can you include us here aswell?
---
Lmao. Not like it matters. People are going to use an addon, a website, or discord for grouping up regardless of in game queueing systems. Its easy to make and spread such resources these days. People who think classic is going to look like vanilla in the sense of community are deluding themselves.
---
&gt; and having level 61 greens outmatch level 60 epics.
---
This is kind of a dumb argument that I'm always confused by. Expansions are *only* endgame. There's no months-long leveling like 1-60 originally was. 
---
Expansion questing is essentially an attunement chain that provides you with upgraded gear to take on the next tier. Like, what else would you expect? There's no other solution to this. Should you get *zero* gear in an expansion until you unlock the first new raid tier? Meh. Questing gear acts as a catch up for people new to the expansion.
---
Wanting 60 Epics to be “powerful forever” is a red herring.
---
can the fucking corpses please stay ffs
---
warriors are the only real tank and one of best dps
---
His guides cost money way back in 2006. Not sure what people expected lol
---
The Call to arms LFG addon (CTA) was always there, wasn't it?
---
What? A community wants to advise where they are planning on playing. Why is that difficult?
---
Red = Dead is not always the case. On RP realms alliances between guilds from the other faction happens. Truces and peace treaties made. Although red is dead is a good rule of thumb for any pvp server, it's not always the case on RP servers.
---
i thought they were both trinkets and i realized i was completely wrong earlier saying it only activates on 1 spell.
---
item for item, the fire ruby is much better.
---
but again, one is a trinket and one is a necklace. You cant compare the 2 because those items are never competing against each other.
---
taking the fire ruby means you wont have the neck, and your other neck options might not be that good.
---
This is a fight that cannot be won
---
Doesn't Stormwind have an auction house in classic though? As well as Darnassus?
---
I never really cared much about Joana either way until now, but seeing that kind of passive aggressive douchebaggery doesn't really make me like the guy.
---
Are you saying no work went into creating or hosting the guides?  
---
When you do work, do you expect to be able to set a price for your labor?
---
False equivalency.
---
ElvUI has become kind of standard. Most players use some variation of it, customized to their liking and I believe they have the classic version finished or are close to finishing it.
---
#nochanges i will miss the sea of skeletons in hillsbrad and nesingwarys...
---
And to think, so many people were mad about right click reporting being in the game.
---
Does it support 21:9 by any chance?
---
No arguements there!  Locks are great and are a great class to play for lots of reasons. They just get a lot better (especially in PvP) with Naxx gear, and I think anyone rolling lock with that in mind and just thinking they'll power through the other stuff and aren't really looking forward to it are misinformed.
---
DISC OMEGALUL RD
---
It’s clearly Blay- lmaoooo
---
the server cap isn't at 3k because of layering you absolute dunce lmao
---
Priest from what i can remember are pretty good against a few matchups, it's ALWAYS worth taking engi if you plan on PvPing- unless your alliance... in that case PvP is easy and just run blindly in! ;)
---
tauren also gives you bigger health pool.
---
and weapon and armor looks a lot better on a tauren
---
You gotta be a moron to complain about this when:
---
A) There is an ocean of free information and other guides on the web
---
and 
---
B) The guy did a shit ton of work and wants to be reimbursed for it.
---
then leave that guild?
---
believe it or not, some guilds actually progressed without 8 human warriors, 8 human rogues, and 8 dwarf priests lol
---
Now that Blizzard has pointed it out though, people will ABSOLUTELY do it now. In fact, they'll find more creative ways to be vulgar in game as a way to protest being censored. I hate these people ruining things for the rest of us
---
Well if you're focused on casually having fun, you should stick with rogue even more! Super fun to world pvp with and you don't need to worry about competition for pvp. Sneaking into enemy territory is always exciting too.
---
Alliance and Horde Populations are so badly unbalanced on all Servers :P
---
And the Server I am playing Horde on is so full of Horde it is ridiculous.
---
I’m “hung up on fun” 
---
Bro...I hate to break the news to ya...that’s kinda the point of video games 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
---
That stretch goal of 5 hours of sleep LUL
---
Even getting 6 Naxx geared tanks was impossible for many progression guilds. Especially when you get to the 4HM fight and realize "fuck, we haven't been gearing our tanks because we were trying to get past the dps checks like Patchwerk and Loatheb".
---
Dude chill, this isn’t a PVP zone
---
***DOOT!***
---
Get the fk out
---
It's been 2019 pussified.  You could potentially spell out bad words with corpses so it's removed.
---
this is what happens when people get so inundated with free-to-play/free-to-use that they don't realize the default is to PAY for someone else's work. He worked ridiculously hard to make these; he should be rewarded.
---
Can you link your model? I want to print this haha
---
We should just disband all guilds too!!  It’s too easy to find groups in a guild!!!  
---
That’s not vanilla!!!  Let’s get blizzard to break guilds! 
---
I want everyone to wait around with their dick in their hands for 3 hours because vanilla!  
---
Lmfao - the fuck outta here. 
---
Don’t want the addon then don’t use it
---
Hey there!
---
I wrote the guide for [Rogues on wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-classic-wow) and I would highly suggest giving it a read over.
---
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here 👍
---
Thats not fair. The game has always ultimately been a profit making venture.
---
In terms of design, the focus is split between your character and Sylvanas/Jaina.  You are the amazing Champion who has to do all these vitals tasks every day, while all the story related questing is about Sylvanas or Jaina.
---
Spanish speaking people generally have a reputation for being bad at online games, Portugese as well. They are doing this to quarantine Spanish speakers to a different server so they dont have to deal with as many in their groups at least hypothetically. Thalnos seems to be the NA version of this kind of quarantine server
---
Could pay $5 for a 30 pack of Beer 30 if you can find it.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much, just make sure to have grey items set to roll on. You'll need to roll need on them, can be very useful for raptor strike and wing clip.
---
You know what else has a subscription?
---
Classic WoW.
---
Gotta make sure you're getting 165 fps.
---
Mainly it comes down to how important 5 mans are to you. For raiding it doesn't matter much because you just get a raid spot and show up. For levelling solo it really doesn't matter. The place where it makes the difference is how quickly you can find a group for dungeons you want. You might find it hard to find 2 groups in 5 hours as a 60 rogue, and just go with whoever takes you. If you're a warrior tank on the other hand you could run 5 dungeons that are the exact ones you want.
---
&gt; Mana is a huge thing to take in consideration. If you start spamming healing touch you'll be oom in seconds.
---
Druids have -10% mana cost (to priest's 15%) which is fine. Again we're not talking max rank heals here, you should NEVER be using max rank heal unless it's an instant cast, it's far too mana inefficient, as well as time inefficient. (who the hell is casting a 3 second heal wtf).
---
I can relate. We ran a program on Deathwing where we raffled MC and BWL runs in exchange for people farming mats to unlock AQ. We hated the raid and especially the shitty drops, so it was a boatload of effort for almost nothing. I actually quit the game for a long time after AQ. That while thing was a trainwreck.
---
Just because you haven't seen it, doesn't mean it's not there. I was replying generally to the comments I read when first opening this post, and a quick sort by controversial to reconfirm shows that there are still folks who take issue with the notion of these guides going behind a paywall. If the top comments have sorted to give the impression that most people understand and are okay about this, great! Cooler heads have prevailed!
---
Too bad we are split among pretty much every NA servers because we cant make our mind
---
Is candle a euphemism?
---
"What do you mean? Now we can play the game."
---
they will if you arnt on herod
---
It was literally written on his website homepage.
---
You agreed to their terms of service to play the game.  They can regulate it however they want.
---
bUt My FrEe sPeEcH
---
My pals and I are already getting hyped over a full BRD clear. It's going to take legitimate co-ordination of schedules to do. I couldn't be happier
---
It's my favorite part of the leveling experience.
---
I would think shaman or warlock, but more so shaman. Bursty, great heals, great group utility and support.
---
print file...stx or whatever
---
God bless this sub.
---
Pssh silly casual doesnt even have a que alarm...
---
The strain on the servers is most likely, because a Chinese WoW would have a separate client and servers
---
Sorry man, sucks that you can't go to your classes.
---
They've laid off most of their GMs since vanilla. Their support staff is tiny compared to what it used to be.
---
So in guessing no.
---
Yeah but some folks derive fun from success and if half the group is intentionally contributing less to that success... Well that's not fair to the people giving it their all
---
&gt;Sitting for an hour trying to find people isn't fun. It's just a waste of time.
---
Maybe don't play classic if you don't like classic?
---
Two wholly different circumstances. 
---
Decursive fundamentally changed the gameplay for raiding encounters by trivializing debuff dispelling. 
---
An LFD addon is essentially a bulletin board for posting your own group without having to slog through the global LFG chat. This is not randomly queuing you, this is not teleporting you to the dungeon entrance, this is literally an enhanced version of the in-game LFG channels.
---
Are you gonna ask Blizzard to break discord? Because if addons are not the route people sue to make group finding smoother, then server Discords are gonna be the tool used. It's inevitable, but not game breaking.
---
i really hope blizzard force the morons working on retail to play this so they can get their shit together and fix it
---
Hahahaha if only.
---
This is a fine stance, but not the one my guild, and presumably most will have. BoE profit will go towards raid progression, not to randomly bolster someone's gold stack. 
---
Again, fine to have your opinion, but it's not ours.
---
Oh man, I used to watch so much [Project Lore back in BC/WotLK](https://youtu.be/OxeNyX4uEnU?t=205). Would be awesome to do a similar setup with the old developers.
---
Pretty much, yea.
---
Honestly I've been really stuck on going warrior, but I just can't do it. Unless you can no life and either love tanking or you love bg's with a healer friend, I don't think it's worth it.
---
Almost went shaman, that's almost like a nice in between. Potentially has some of the 2h fun, but has healing, burst, whatever you want to build. It also levels fast, pretty decent at farming, and can do really well in open world.
---
Mechanically old raids are trivially simple compared to modern raids. Pretty much any numbskull can raid. Even modern dungeons are more challenging.
---
There is, however, a tremendous challenge to one's patience. Not only in the farming of consumables and pre-raid prep, but also in the ceaseless cat-herding involved in getting 40 people pointed it one direction and enduring the unending flow of bathroom breaks and other assorted AFKs. When people say raiding is a second job, they mean it. You endure countless hours of toilsome tedium, and then you get paid. Hypothetically. Only in this case, your pay comes haphazardly, and in the form of marginal and incremental gear upgrades.

I had the exact same thing when I started in BC on Sunstrider Isle:
---
*Hey this area is very cool, let's see the map... Oh it's just a tiny part of a massive zone? Holy shit!*
---
-rightclick to reveal EK-
---
*Wait, there's a whole continent of these massive zones? wtf*
---
-rightclick to reveal the world map-
---
*there's another... continent?*
---
-rightclick to reveal Outland-
---
*another worldmap? :o*
---
My mind just couldn't comprehend the sheer scale of it, and it was (mostly) a seamless world. That was almost unheard of at that time.
---
gotta farm those rarespawns for sick white gear
---
So when they take layering out in p2 it’s gonna be 3k cap again? You really think that’s the plan?
---
Jesus Christ read a book
---
I remember Cosmo, Cosbo? Ugh the great server transfer. Good times!
---
I don’t care what anyone says anymore. Classic is gonna kill retail. Give me your downvotes I don’t care. I tasted the game for 15 minutes on the Stress Test after only thinking I’d be a casual classic player and still mainly stick to retail. 
---
After that experience I realized there’s no way me or anyone else is going back to BFA if they try Classic and that includes World First raiders. (Except of course when there’s a new raid released).
---
Same. People crap on them but I love em. Now the third movie....
---
Perfect Balance. Just like it should.
---
This was always my head canon as well
---
Druid probably
---
All of the spells that people "thought" were lvl2 req are actually lvl 1 req, just virtually no one saw them until Lvl 2.  
---
Devo Aura for pallies is another good one to get at lvl 1: It gives 55 armor, the stuff you sell to pick it up gives like 5....
---
Carbs? No thanks, trying to take care of my body.

Search the sub for Class Guides. There is a really comprehensive list someone compiled not long ago.

I remember when I was a little kid my cousin was playing vanilla WoW. Even though I didn't fully understand, I was... En*thrall*ed... *ahem*
---
Years later I got to play during cata for a bit on my mom's account, and much later I got my own account. Found my home guild a few days later and loved it ever since. This game made my life infinitely better, no matter what happened.
---
I now can experience the game that I oggled so much from way back to the cousin who saved my life as a kid, and a guy I always looked up to. We're finally here OP. We've made it.
---
How much grinding does AllyRoute require? I flicked through the quests section and some levels only had like 5 quests against them.
---
but warrior literally beats no one in pvp...
---
No they said they removed skeletons entirely...

Your dog plays the Druid I assume?

No. We need to boycot bfa.

Looking forward to browsing 'new' tomorrow and seeing this question again.

WOOOSH
---
It is server specific. Argent Dawn EU and I never once saw anyone call it VC, ever.
---
 dwarf ...... her   O.o
---
Save the money and just play the game, classic is about the journey, the endgame isn't as important.
---
It's a pity they only made 2.
---
Euphemism, fetish, a couple of thoughts came to mind..
---
Rip your karma. It's dangerous to mention anything like this here.

I doubt it

Discord is not part of the game...

*shrug* 15 years ago when I was 15 and playing WoW religiously for those 4 years of Vanilla the only things I really talked about with my mates were WoW related things like dungeons and lore, Warcraft 3 and anime over Ventrilo. The guilds I were in were always small, not the 100+ guilds that people seem to want to be a part of.
---
I do remember joining a giant guild before at first for like a week but the scrolling guild text and constant inane chatter turned me off it. I probably just lucked out and found the non-judging adults when I found my first real guild as I played with them for the entirety of my Vanilla experience.
---
same here lol. I was level 59 walking into the dark portal. I was really really bad at leveling back then. i had like 30 days played on that toon too
---
100% real! Didn’t think there’d be so much jealousy which makes me excited!
---
Please just use c[lassicwow.live](https://ClassicWoW.Live) which is free
---
It's actually pronounced Bloh-mer... So just say "blow me" really fast.
---
Could feral druid be an option for you? Honestly, if you want to play something then just go for it I think. It's all about enjoyment. You have to stare and play the character for 60 level so might as well pick the one you want!
---
There’s a literal countdown at the bottom of that screenshot. Do the math.
---
They still have to give 100%, but I’m not gonna shit on someone for playing what they find fun.
---
mmo mice are doody.  get a good fps mouse and use more keyboard binds.
---
I think they still do care, but see no reason for further resistance now that the decision has been made.
---
But I'd still love to see one later down the line.
---
BRD is my favorite dungeon. One of my fondest memories was a run I started by spamming LFG, I was clear with everyone who wanted to join that we were going for a full clear. It took us \~6 hours but everyone who joined stayed for the entire event. Some guys needed their keys, some needed attunement, but we all helped each other and had a blast doing it. We even took screenshots of each of us sitting on the throne at the end. Good times. modern wow is not the same. Not by a long shot.
---
Awesome, I already have a comprehensive sticky note with spell progression, wand progression, talent progression and class quest progression.
---
I mean. You'll have an advantage against non premades but premade groups will stomp you.
---
I personally am going Combat Swords with Improved Sprint for leveling. Once I Hit 60 and do a few MC runs (and get Perdition’s Blade) I’ll swap to the improved kick/backstab PVP build. You can find that exact build in the Builds Guide under PvP
---
I personally dislike WC a lot
---
It's in my playlist of movies to watch for classic release :) 
---
Also got some good adult cartoons from the same era.. space ghost, aqua teen, futurama etc.
---
Orc on the felsteed is dope lezzbehonest
---
The way people talk about the streamer server it sounds like its going to be like Dynasty Warriors, slaughtering all these weak goons to get at the one guy who will put up a fight .
---
And I thought playing on a shitty computer with an average of 10 frames per second was underprivileged. I would not have played WoW during that time either (my parents would certainly give me the money if I asked, but I knew they struggled to make ends meet, so that money would come out of something we actually needed) had it not been for my bro-in-law who offered to pay for my subscription until I could afford to pay it on my own.
---
I could not no-life it because of school and parents. 
---
And now, finally, I will... NOT be able to no-life it because of a wife XD
---
Seriously, no matter how much I explain to her the importance of this game to me, she does not seem to hear it and I believe she registers it in her mind as "he believes this game is more important than me!" even if I mostly spend time with her and only take a couple of hours out for the game.
---
I wish I could put the world on pause to get my fill of WoW and then resume life when I'm done. Though I suspect the world would be on a LOOOOONG pause XD

Playing a meme spec is not giving 💯
---
Don't equate the shittier parts of Vanilla  game play as a fundamental part of the classic experience. You can still like Classic while acknowledging that certain parts of the experience were stupid and tedious.
---
[US population](https://mapofusa.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2.gif) tends to skew towards the coasts, especially the east cost. Likely people in the middle picked East as well, since the "middle" of America is further east than west.

It was $8 back in college. We all scrounged together $15 to get a case of beer. But then we saw Beer 30 for $8 and were like, "Well, shit. We can get that AND a pack of smokes."

That is by far the most wretched shit I've ever drank. Tasted like used motor oil. We each drank half of one and couldn't do any more.

I'll downvote you because you don't know what you're talking about. You're just smashing your keyboard without any facts at all. Joana has never said that his guides will always be free. If you watch his streams he has said that his members area will have access to the full guides come launch.
---
The folks I remember most were our arch rivals PPP (Pretty Pink Pwnies, top Horde guild) and AoD (??). They were the Alliance guild that was sometimes at our heels. I secretly loved PPP and at launch I rolled Horde mainon Gorgonash but my girlfriend wasn't having it.

They're really just concerned someone will make the "Okay" hand gesture, because as blizzard has pointed out before, it is a symbol of white supremacy. &lt;inserts derpy spongebob meme&gt;

It was changed on patch 1.10 and classic will be on 1.12 which is after 1.10.

I tend to disagree because from what i seen happen from my experience seeing multiboxers, the alliance would be too shy to charge forth because doing so is an insta-death from a shock or lightning bolt.

even non premades will stomp him unless hes like a legit ass s tier multiboxer.  multiboxing is dogshit unless you outnumber your opponents

Preach.
---
There should be 1 and only 1 acheivement in classic.  Reaching level 60 on your first character rewards the acheivement "You think you do, but you don't!"
---
doesn't it say "your next fire spell" so it only hits a single spell?
---
Long LFG times isn't what made classic what it was or made it great and it's asinine to say that that's a core experience of the game.
---
as opposed to being proud for hitting a button to break fear? meh :P
---
Amazing work man, was perfect.
---
Hope to see more in the future
---
So you basically have 0 idea about how the addon works and you still feel like you're qualified to criticize it, got it.
---
I just can't agree there. Sure classes have lost a lot of abilities, but they still are very different. I can last stand bubble on my prot paladin to deal with necrotic stacks or a bast pack. On my warrior I need to leap away or have help ccing. I can't leap away on my paladin. Sure I have my horse but it's very different.
---
I can also help out the healer a little on my paladin with my self heal or with a bop / spell warding.
---
Even our core abilities are still very different. Sure consecration and thunder clap are aoe ground abilities, but consecration is a constant ticking on the ground where thunder clap is a single burst of snap threat.
---
I can use so many abilities from ranged on my paladin to build aggro as ranged mobs are coming, but I am far more limited on my warrior.
---
Even the way you mitigate damage is still very different.
---
You can do this for any. There's nothing that plays like a disc priest and Holy priest still plays totally differently from holy paladin.
---
You can say that some classes and specs aren't fun to play and that they lost too many abilities that make them stand out as different, but that doesn't mean they are the same now, thats just so completely untrue.
---
MMO mices are great. I personally like the corsair scimitar. It's definitely one of the cheaper ones but just as good build quality. But I've tried quite a few and none of them really seemed bad.
---
There are at least 2 star trek epsiodes with this plot.
---
&gt; They try too hard to make the horde the bad guys
---
While also trying to act like they aren't the bad guys at the same time even though they have started every war between the factions. 
---
Reminder, attacking the Night Elves despite being unprovoked was Saurfang's idea, and yet now we are supposed to believe he is a good orc simply because he felt bad about backstabbing Malfurion.
---
That’s the cheesy way to Stormwind. Any NE worth his salt who wants to level in human lands does the Wetlands swamp run of terror into Kaz Modan, then to Ironforge and tram to Stormwind.

I loved it's design though, it's button layout was PERFECT, logitech g600 is the only thing that i've found that comes close to it, and is what I currently use
---
Oh snap. Guess I didn't really think about it like that. /s
---
I'm sorry that you and the "massive amount" of people who will quit the game because of layering will not be enjoying Classic WoW. 
---
I hope that you find a game that fits all your requirements, both socially and technologically.
---
just do dun morogh till lvl10, finishing up with the thelsamar flight path. then go stormwind, go to the pumpkin patch and ask someone who's there to share the princess quest with you ;)

A long, hard road to 60, and the life of a tank (mostly)

Do you have someone to level with? I'd recommend playing a warrior with friends and solo leveling a different class with a bit more sustain.

Hey, is Classic releasing the 26th or the 27th? I don't know how the Earth's rotation works.
---
Oh absolutely, I'm just trying to avoid the majority of them if I can
---
Bye skele :(
---
Interesting, thanks for sharing.
---
Not really man. This is a child, not a carebear.  It really is a dick move. Might have made this kid cry, ruined his whole night - who knows.
---
It's extremely dependent on the player. Tanking you're pretty solid for 5-mans and raid offtanks (many guilds may argue the point but tryhard guilds should WANT a feral to eat things warriors may not be able to).
---
As for feral DPS, it's a mess of a rotation, and you need to farm a lot to even compete for damage. (most importantly - manual crowd pummelers.... by the truckload)
---
Yeah, no one is disputing that. I'm just saying, he doesn't deserve money for it just because he made it. He can try to sell it all he wants, but he doesn't *deserve* anything for it.
---
Holy shit now we're resorting to straight up lies thought up on the spot
---
Pretty sure a decent multibox shaman can beat pugs, and beating pugs is all it takes.
---
at that point its not 1v1 if the warrior has a healer though.
---
Monday for those playing on the freedom servers
---
This time don't buy an eMachine.  Go balls out and pick up that sweet Compaq with the 3DFX Voodoo 3 3000. It's a beast and will last you until the next expansion.
---
Right? I'm so glad Icy Veins was willing to improve the game like this. Far too often, I'm stuck in Orgrimmar shouting "Need a tank! Need a tank! Need a tank!" when I'd really rather just press a button to be ported into the raid.

Maybe Icy Veins will also release a questhelper addon and an exploit to help me shard-jump!

Hardly anyone has played it yet, no can predict how it will be a year from now when so many people haven’t even experienced it yet.
---
Hunter most likely
---
Half life 2 and world of Warcraft being released at the same time, I’ll remember this as one of the golden ages of gaming .
---
Dungeon group leveling is the best by far.
---
I don't think anyone intends to ONLY speak the language they put down. I mean I'm not going to go around and speak Swedish everywhere just because that's where I'm from. If I'm playing with other Swedes I'll speak Swedish. I think people just want to know where all the big communities are playing because there will be guilds that only recruit people that speak their language.
---
I think my counter to this would be to out range you.  Shocks are 20 yards, lightning bolt and chain lightning are 30 yards.  As a Mage (and i think all cloth wearers) all spells can be cast from beyond 30 yards.  You would grind up melee but would have to be careful of mages, warlocks, priests, and hunters who know your range.  If you get the other 5 people on your team to protect you, you would be an unstoppable death ball i think for sure.
---
Lock, easier leveling good pvp.
---
You don’t hear about ele because most players are forced into healing on the majority of specs that can.
---
Wow amazing, does this support 2560x1440 res?
---
I want this with steams wallpaper engine!
---
There are substantial reading guides online. Some people prefer listening over reading
---
Fixed. Thank you!
---
If Classic's success is sustained them I am sure we will see a TBC server which will also drive a lot of people to play. They said in the Q&amp;A yesterday that making TBC would be much easier now because of the work they did in creating Classic.
---
I would argue mages are far better when "played badly". That's going to be the easiest class to pick up and play. Literally the only thing a hunter has over a mage is leveling speed.
---
You can win against a good rogue, there's quite a lot of skill involved.
---
A lot of people say it's just rock paper scissors, but I would say things are closer to 60-40 for rogue lock if you are orc because of stun resist.
---
Could you pm me the guide once you get ir?
---
What's WAY more effective is naming and shaming and KICKING everyone from your guilds, your parties and your raids that you know that bought gold or any of those services. The farmers just fill a demand, it's the demand that you need to burn out with a blow torch.

My response was a little tongue in cheek. Obviously your way is faster, was just nostalgic remembering the old wetlands run as a naked night elf.

Horde, camping the mage tower and Flight Master.

Say what you want about the Orgrimmar back door, but the natural choke points and camping that happen on the SW Flight Master and Mage tower are unmatched.  Such good places to defend and gank at.

If you dont realize that Asmon is the best actor on twitch, you might be oblivious. The dude is a caricature, it's actually hilarious to see people get riled up over it.

Can I just add how great it is having a place to hang up on tips. Initially he was my favourite classicast because of his deep voice. But after watching some of his deep dives which are all garbage except the Skarm Tank ones and learning about his scummy past, hating on him with you guys just feels great. I hope he gets banked repeatedly by his alliance streaming buddies.

I was in the original wow beta. I played for free and then bought the full game when it came out.  Sure the subscription model sucks, but you'll note that's how're paying for wow as well.
---
As someone that does multibox, I don't think you are going to make it very far if you assume that people are always going to go for your main. It is much easier to deal with a multiboxer by going for the followers either by CCing it or straight up killing them before the multiboxer has time to react with their main and other followers, and by that time they are already down a follower or 2 from CC or death.
---
Ultimayely... they'd have to sink down to both stepping side by side. Walking together. One slightly leading from one location to the next, forever stuck in neutral and mob areas only. Fighting together forcefully to overcome quests.

I was in elementary school when Classic was out, and I'm ashamed to admit that I used powerleveling services in order to get on even playing field with my friends. I ended up getting hacked multiple times afterwords and ultimately banned because of it-- Good. It is toxic, dangerous (NEVER give illegal third parties full access account info with payment information on it), and ruins the entire point of the game.
---
I'll be reporting them if I see them.
---
This older version is not the one being pay walled, the current one is. It's not piracy because this was free previously, it's just inaccessible now.
---
A ton of people will play in the first few weeks, the population will see a huge dropoff, and then it'll slowly build back up again. That's often how these kinds of things go.
---
That was a beauty to read. I know exactly what you mean. It made me learn that you can't really \*trust\* anyone.
---
I'm not a fanboy by any stretch. I don't like his content at all, personally. But I wouldn't describe him the way you do either way. He appears to be a long-time casual player that just enjoys the game. "Noob"-Questions shouldn't make anyone hate the way you showcased. You're simply a bad human, don't try to defend that ;)

Crazy, I've been going to Anime conventions since I was 14 so the first thing out of my mouth was always anime related or that I had made my Zabuza cosplay myself and made his sword out of a stupidly heavy piece of wood. The only girls I was talking about were my waifus cause I was (am) a fucking weeaboo and I crushed hard on Hinata.
---
My guild was full of older dudes around 20+ and they figured out I was young after I joined voice chat. Its entirely possible they moderated themselves for my sake.
---
Both pure DPS classes. Both are great in PVP &amp; PVE for the entirety of classic and beyond.
---
Literally just comes down to if you want to play ranged or melee.
---
Well if you do a full instance run, you can get in more casters who need gear from other bosses or attunements.
---
I was watching Joana stream the other day and he talked about how he lives with a roommate and his sister supports him. He says his sister is on food stamps herself and she buys him groceries to support him. He also said he doesn't have a job and lately has been working on building the guides before classic full time.  
---
He didn't mention health issues but it wouldn't surprise me. If he is sick or otherwise unemployed and put thousands of hours into these guys I think it's fine to pay him a few bucks for what are the undisputed best guides online.

I mean, if you are set on playing with your friends and the majority of them want to roll horde, then suck it up and roll horde with them. Its not like its poison playing on horde side.
---
I mean.. i had a friend in classic who was given a 25 year game card by a blizz GM..

Like I said VoDs getting removed is okay because the actual live stream was available for free to everyone who wanted to watch it, but in this case the VoD was NOT available to everyone for free and only to those that were subscribed.
---
self proclaimed #1 NA warrior duelist Tipsout!   what a great pickup!
---
Ok in the battle.net app you have to pick [World of Warcraft Classic](https://i.imgur.com/uWeSolN.png)
---
You can go in right now and create your character on the server you want to play on.
---
its rough lol.  Is it bad my names play a big part into picking the class also? 
---
Lock name is - Lucifear
---
Shaman name is - Aweshocks
---
I told you all that add-ons would provide all the QoL features we hate. Quest helper, group finder, gear score...
---
Nobody listened.
---
Just a side comment - From not speaking the language to now, your English is better than many native speakers. Gratz on being multilingual. I'm a bit jealous.
---
Do you want to be ranged or melee, and do you want to PvP are going to be your guiding questions here probably. Rogues are better in PvP usually. Classes are very similar beyond thkse two questions, though. Both have great dps, both have pretty good to great cc, pretty good to great interrupt, etc.
---
Shitty thing =/= against ToS and absolutley forbidden behavior
---
Still do tbh
---
Same, I'm interested in seeing if it evens out a bit in the weeks following launch. However, I guess some big alliance streamer is playing on Pagle which may be why so many are drawn to play alliance there.
---
You wont miss anything. The login servers are going to explode. That and no shared tagging mobs will mean starter areas will take 12 hours just to get level 10
---
Amazing how people care about agame they've been waiting for, for over a decade.
---
Might not be able to figure it out for a few days, he has it pretty locked down. Trying to get the pages to save as PDF, but there's some security in how the website it coded so that when I save a page of the guide, it saves the members login page instead.
---
Could we have played together? :)

Hey I'm sure you'd be interested in this!

Oh oof. 
---
I thought you were personally attacking me and my sarcastic reply.

They dont seem to be budging. So you wont convince them.
---
Stop spreading misinformation
---
Joana has came out as trans a few times.
---
That would have been fantastic
---
TICH IS NOT FOR YOU!
---
You can just not have battle.net start with the computer.
---
A winner take all super smash brothers match
---
Did you play retail back in 04? Shit was obscure and not always accurate or detailed. Leveling guides like these were HUGE back then because it was a massive slog and you could greatly improve your efficiency if you knew exactly where to go and what to do.
---
You probably haven't read the descripition of the addon because it doesn't change anything about social interaction and reputation.
---
The difference compared to playing without it is that you can use it everywhere and you don't have to go through the infinite pointless spam of the LFG channel
---
LOL. So he can make the anology with Lousiana but I can't with California? LOL.

Mamma mia, does it show again?  
---
My my, just how much I've missed you  
---
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
---
Blue since the day we parted  
---
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
---
Mamma mia, even if I say  
---
Bye bye, leave me now or never  
---
Mamma mia, it's a game we play  
---
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
---
&gt; I know we've all gotten better but dang guys.
---
Ahah, if nothing we got worse.
---
You are totally forgetting that after vanilla, the trend has been that trash are to be chain pulled and blasted in space while laughing.
---
A LOT of people are in for a bad surprise with the first lvl 40+ instances in which they will not know what you use "sheep" or "sap" or "trap" in pve.
---
I can't remember but I hope that the raid marks are already introduced in the version that is being deployed for Classic.
---
* yellow star - sheep
---
* white moon - sap
---
* purple diamond - banish/mind control
---
* green triangle - roots
---
* red X - second target
---
* skull - focus dps/nuke
---
is as far as I remember since I stopped playing ages ago.
---
You do you
---
You want signs of war in a war game? Spoilt brat.
---
Bleh.  Horizontal progression is atrocious.  Just play ESO if you want horizontal progression.  Everyone is the same level always and you can do whatever you want whenever you want.
---
Only world first i care about is Stino, fuck everyone else. POONGOON!!!
---
Maydie and Pat, made me grind premade BG's  way longer then I should have. Still gives me crazy nostalgia when I watch today.
---
Fml
---
Is that the wolf?
---
Ele shaman runs out of mana fast and will have to drink a lot when leveling.
---
Ele shaman most of his best gear for awhile is from leatherworking afaik, So in a way they are easy to get (mail with +nature damage and such) but requires your professions or money.
---
They both have good utility. In group play the shaman can do a lot.
---
Ele shaman can be very good in PVP is vulnerable to being jumped/ambushed.
---
I like both classes in original WOW. the big thing is that shaman is hybrid with those disadvantages and advantages.
---
Downside to shamans is they are expected healers in raids while warlocks have good specs that are good for raid/pvp/solo.
---
Warlocks have to manage soul shards that means more farming/exposure-to-danger-if-pvp-server and 1 or 2 less bags for items.
---
Came to complain but really wanted to say this! 🤓
---
I can’t even read that last sentence quickly
---
Literally nobody craps on them.
---
You won’t have a problem leveling in Elwynn as a night elf Druid. Pretty sure I remember there are Druid trainers in the Stormwind park and once you get your moonglade teleport, just port to moonglade to train and hearth back. You will have a bunch of Druid quests for your forms you need to do in moonglade and surrounding area.
---
Is that carrying over from retail? Because /follow was a thing for pvp in vanilla.
---
Yea maybe a difference between US and EU. There's obviously a bunch of vanilla players excited for it just haven't interacted with many from EU myself, and the EU discord seem to be full of zoomers.
---
Just won't be the same without a bajillion trillion skeletons :(
---
LOL GOOD LUCK CASUAL /s
---
Not a bug! This was perfectly intended.
---
it's part of the whole picture
---
but tbh so are walljumping, and a lot of other bugs that blizz fixed so there's that.
---
hell I'm gonna miss casting animations fizzling out and my char just standing there with gloving hands for a second or two.
---
That's all that's needed
---
You do not need retail
---
gl
---
You don't need the retail client to play classic.
---
Good to know.
---
yeah, like french toast, and tacos.
---
If Jacob is the admin in that one, I have. Many times.
---
They won't. They will have to do the soil grind at 60 to hit exalted, from what I remember.
---
No, the only class up there is hunter.
---
I was a little disappointed to see that. But I think $5 is still reasonable.
---
Yes that’s all you need bruv
---
Thanks guys!
---
Mark Kern and Kevin Jordan are legends 
---
Its expired but mark had a really long twitch vod where he went through a lot of information about developing the human starter zones (the first one worked on)
---
it was super super interesting 
---
for example the large wall in the human start zone and the way you cant see in the front of that first building was all because they didnt think the client could handle displaying both inside a building and a bunch of stuff outside 
---
this is why you cant look outside from a lot of the early buildings 
---
there was a heap of interesting stuff but another highlight was the table you can sit at in goldshire inn they planned a ranked simple card game that you would have to go to inn's to play 
---
oh and one of the famous developers badly wanted naga in the game playable , in the end they decided it would look trash with their tail clipping through everything (but they were also running out of time and needed to cut stuff)
---
also the sun also rises and sets then goes back down the way it came up because they were adding sun effects to the ground textures and it would look wrong if the sun was on the other side of a building but the static textures had shadows and stuff in the wrong direction (something i never even thought about)
---
Because misinformation is all over this thread, I thought I would just correct it.  Zygor never once makes you pay for their guides.  They make you pay for access to their forums, where the guides are hosted.  That's how they avoid breaking ToS.

Worked for Pearson, can confirm.
---
I think it can be done, events, camera control, and screenshot capability is there. Tricky part is camera control.
---
The guide is trash. People have perfected vanilla leveling since.
---
There's a real fast dispawn timer on skeletons so we won't even expect 1 person to even leave 1 skeleton anymore that's what I meant by false earlier
---
Even tho I'll talk my primary language in gchat because everyone is from the same country as me, doesn't mean I'll not communicate primarily in English. The question is horrible.
---
It's a basket, right?
---
Have you ever been in Un'goro?
---
Blizz said back at Blizzcon they'll break any addon the implements lfr or anything like it intentionally.
---
So you like oui oui eh?
---
It drowned in New, perhaps people in NA have woken up and might find it useful
---
I am considering priest, because I've never really played one. The problem is that I've never healed too. I am locked on caster DPS, will be a toss up between it and some kind of mage until the last moment.
---
This is why it won't work. Follow doesn't work in BGs.  You will do well in WPvP tho
---
No way you’re going as Madseason for Halloween?

I actually got really lucky, just started at a new job and I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off, and get off at 5:30 on Monday, so I can no life it for those few days and I also go back to school the next week's, kinda a fitting end for summer I think
---
Mayyyyybe? My rogue years were on some RP server or other. Naiq.
---
Crap you beat me to it
---
I'm not in favor of anything. I'm letting people play the game how they want to play it. 
---
The people deluding themselves into thinking classic was going to be exactly and that there wouldn't be addons that do all this stuff are funny.
---
It says he was saving for the Guild Bank next. So he clearly wanted to open the bank next.
---
lol, I’d do the same thing but I’d just go afk and let the game time out to log me out.  Meanwhile little xxxsephirothxxx is blowing up my PMs.
---
I at first also had the feeling the community of classic wow was for the big part a big pool of min-maxers, but I see a difference in comments on Reddit and investigating this further I have a feeling that the "normal" playing people are a big group, Min maxers wil be a big group but not the biggest.
---
Elemental ist not going to be viable. 
---
It's an entirely different game than BC was. The "feature" that more than one spec was viable for all classes came very late. There will be mobs immune to your damage. You will have serious mana issues. Nobody will take an elemental shaman with them even if you could make it viable. 
---
As a shaman your job was heal and support. 
---
As a player your job was to do what you were told to do. Raids required a raid leader and 39 people doing exactly what they were supposed to do. Nobody wants something different or special. Stick to what other people know is working. It'll save you a lot of trouble.
---
out of curiosity why does this stat at lvl 12?
---
wish they keep their grubby paws off muh classic
---
Doesn't sound like ya'll are really friends haha
---
I’m honestly not even sure how they tell whether something is RWT or not because I’ve both sold and bought millions of gold over the years and never even seen someone get so much as suspended for it. Unless they are completely stupid like Limit and basically broadcast it to the world.
---
If skeletons were removed I could maybe sympathise. But they're still there.
---
The only difference is now when you see a pile of skeletons you can be sure it wasn't one dude who just sucks.
---
I'm definitely taking it as it comes.. no rush to 60. I really enjoy the world environment and all the challenges as you level, be it those hard hitting mobs you need to team up with or that annoying rogue that is corpse camping you, eirher way, classic has always been about the journey for me. However, once I hit 60 I will eventually focus on raiding and see if I can get past Huhuran this time around, it was a real bummer not seeing how Naxx or even C'thun fight was back in the day. I don't really expect to reachm Naxx, but it would surely be nice going that far.
---
I was lucky enough to see it drop in vanilla but unfortunately i rolled a 12.

Czech comunity go to Golemagg  
---
It is about 5 000 people.. Pls dont forget for us.. tnx ;) We are  also  people what love WoW
---
Visual meshes are not server side. It could easily be a system setting.
---
Yeah... About that. Will probably buy some for my main warrior. So I can get rolling before my farming alt mage is lvl 60.
---
I don't hate the dudes.
---
This is what I've been (somewhat jokingly) saying this whole time. If were going FULL #NoChanges, I don't want any server side detection or right click report. I want to be able to buy all the gold I want with a low risk of getting banned, and if you suspect that I am, and want to report me you have to go to the support page and fill out a ticket.
---
Why the fuck is a sexual orientation on the list? Who the fuck cares if you're gay or straight.
---
No I meant just pick up mining and skinning and selling all the skins and holding the mining mats so I can use them later for engineering at 60? Rather then just leveling engineering and mining while leveling at the same time
---
APC was my alterac jam
---
I definitely think he deserves to be compensated for his work, but from a business perspective his choices to implement a paywall may not be the best solution. Monetization has been showing a clear trend towards free content with donations, which tends to increase publicity/usage and thus end up in more profit compared to paywalls.
---
That said, I'm not an expert in the field and I am not privy the usage information Joana has. Either way, I wish him the best and hope he can continue to be support in his speedrunning.

What happens if he just really like drugs, but only some times, so it's 50/50 if he's shit one day and brilliant the next
---
Why would you install League of Legends?
---
Yeah. My state has alcohol restricted I.D.s  for people who committed alcohol  related  felonies.
---
I'm torn between druid and hunter and since I'm horde, this bow is making me lean hunter. That's some serious power early on.
---
You'll be fine. Just don't try to crank the graphics and you'll be a ok.
---
I have exactly the same problem. I mained a warrior in classic so I really want to play that... but I don’t know if I want to go through the pain of leveling one. My plan was to main a warlock and send gear to the warrior to level with. Also part of my plan was to mostly play the warrior while he has rested exp to make the process go faster. I know overall this will take longer in real life time but at least I’ll keep my sanity
---
Reputation is an overrated and overinflated argument for classic server interaction. Your reputation doesn't extend beyond your immediate sphere of influence unless you stand out as a truly toxic or truly exemplary player. Most people will forget who you are unless you do something that puts you in the 1% that truly stand out.
---
No, you were right. The other dude can't read.
---
That said: it's 7 times; if mana is an issue, you might consider that part; and since they're different slots you may want the trinket anyway depending on what you already have.

My story - I got a 142, went to a T4, did well my first year then transferred to a top 50 school.  Now I'm licensed and practicing.
---
However, please be warned that the market for lawyers today is not great, and the loans can be substantial.
---
I might advise another career if you're having doubts...accounting, for instance is extremely stable and always in need.  Similar logical principles apply.
---
Best of luck to you.
---
Are you trying to compete for server firsts or just trying to raid casually?
---
If you're just raiding  casually I would stick to what you find fun. You might not top the meters but you'll have value for you totems in a dps group.
---
Disgusting. 
---
Can't afford a new mouse in the "MAGA" economy eh? 
---
Rough times for Amuricans.
---
:D Memories
---
So what?
---
If the vast majority ( me included ) feel that ilvl is a bad metric and system to use in Classic, the majority of people wont use it and it wont matter.
---
Ilvl in retail is a joke because you get items thrown at you and can somehow end up with a higher ilvl - by chance - than an mythic raider, its just a bad metric.
---
Someone in Nax gear you know they are somewhat good and have killed X boss because they have X items from Nax. You would take them over someone without that gear no matter if they show higher ilvl in this non-existing addon or not, because gear matters and is a reach achievement in Classic.
---
I love the enthusiasm! You're a natural, just keep practicing.
---
Somewhere in EPL.
---
Audio books while grinding. Problem solved.
---
I’m not excited to get lost in there, that’s for sure.
---
If both sides have people that don't want to budge, ask them whether they really want to play together or not, and if so flip a coin to decide the faction everyone plays on.
---
You need the therapy goblin addon.

How do you know for sure?

This isn't Blizz being lazy; WoW has never been popular in Korea. It consistently struggles to crack the top 10 most played games (based on PC bang stats) even during it's peak so Blizz isn't gonna spend money advertising a game that has already proven to be not particularly popular with the audience there. Vanilla WoW was released in 2005 in Korea, the same year as China but never achieved the same level of success because it had a ton of competition in the MMO space. There's a reason the term "Korean MMO" exists and the market for MMOs over there has historically been dominated by a very insular style of MMO. It's also why South Korea was originally going to get one server. It would be great if this time is different and somehow Classic WoW is a hit this time around like in China but it's probably not going to happen.
---
I’m trying to figure out what class can I play to allow for endgame content but I know I’m going to be in all blue’s for 2 straight years as I just don’t wanna commit 4+ hours twice a week to raiding. Let alone all the farming and other stuff the game usually requires to be well equipped.  
---
I think mage or priest would be best for me. I would love a shaman but feel like I didn’t like playing a shaman until TBC came out and they could be utilized as a main healer.
---
Clicking Power Word:Shield, holy shit. And Desperate Prayer. Those are supposed to be spells used to clutch.
---
You'll be fine at 1080p even in raids.
---
Im a Swede! But yeah, im poor.
---
Will the classic have the same grindy pvp rewards system as the original did? I really hate that you lose points due to inactivity of just one month or was it even less, weekly even?
---
Can you go to another starter zone at level 1?
---
That is STV.
---
So since ur an UPS Driver you are probably not a coder (not that you need to be to understand this), so let me tell you something: detecting advertisements on a text system is way easier than doing image or coordinate processing to detect shapes made with skeletons on the floor.

Also, both are still cheaper than paying tons of people to fly over azeroth monitoring this.

The pink Tallstrider rare.

Thanks for posing the question. Do you think there is an add on to alleviate that problem?

I'm more excited to hang out by the cave entrance to make my way through the cave with the group.
---
If you’re NE you can start following the guide at level 20 ish and it’s perf..... just do the dark shore quest routes until then
---
Also, this guide never specified making gold at launch, this guide is supposed to be a Classic Guide, not a Classic Launch Guide, there's a huge difference :P
---
FUCK OFF WITH THIS, STUPID LOW EFFORT SHIT KILLED /r/WOW

I mean yeah.   Name botting is a thing in most games with unique names and it's super simple to create from scratch.

Why would it be unacceptable to wayback machine this? He hasn't copyrighted any of this; he doesn't own it. It's as much mine as it is his.

&gt; everybody who wants to play is either already subbed or will sub shortly after release
---
Unless Classic takes off to astronomical heights and becomes bigger than Fortnite, you are 100% correct here.  
---
No teenager will be asking their parents for WoW Classic for Christmas, like they would have 15 years ago.  The potential audience is static.
---
The min maxers/elitists from the private servers will hit the game hard, clear all the content then quit drooling for a “fresh” server like they always do leaving the normal/regular players like me that take forever to level lol.
---
level them to 5
---
who the fuck would want that
---
This one is only horde, do you have the alliance version?
---
Most people just level to 5 so you can pick up enchanting and disenchant all your greens.
---
The dude is an ugly mother fucker, at least to me. Seeing him all over the place doesn't help.
---
To be fair I thought it was too. Until I saw the upvotes and a few people replying praising it as a good explanation.
---
Guess it fooled a few folks.
---
Greater Fire Resistance Potions on bosses where you might need em. Pot once before combat and again once the CD is done.
---
i mean it was working like that in pservers, so i dont think they would allow it in classic either.
---
Everyone struggles to correctly read French words because of their entirely different pronunciation of many letter combinations compared to other languages that use the latin alphabet, how is this supposed to be an american thing
---
The answer is not much at all. If you let them get that close on a hunter. You already lost. 8 yards is way to close. You need to be 41 yards away in cheetah stance. Never letting that bitch get into anything range.
---
8 yards is 7.32 meters
---
If you specifically want to heal, go priest.  Druid is a TON of fun, if you want to be a true jack of all trades type deal.  Mage is king on dps for most of the game, and has a really fun PvP kit.  
---
So, if you don't want to tank or do that other weird druid stuff, and you want to heal, go priest.
---
&gt; Go in a completely different direction with new unique xpacs
---
Imagine if this version of WoW ends up taking place in the future of alternate Draenor.
---
Because no one realizes spamming consecration does nothing for agro and yet we spam it anyway.
---
I would love to know as well
---
I played on lower pop servers some days it was really bad, others not so much, it depends on if there are 60s causing trouble, most lvlers stuck to business
---
What's that, you're talking about my two favorite classes in Classic WoW? 
---
Leveling:
---
Locks are buttery smooth leveling, and the free mount is great.
---
Shaman's ghost wolf is a real time saver and being able to heal dungeons will make getting groups very easy.
---
Winner: Lock
---
Gearing:
---
Ele is tough to gear for in that the *best* stuff is often caster gear that all the other DPS are going after as well. But you'd be in the same boat as a lock, really. Shaman has the benefit of being able to cherry pick Leather and Mail gear too.
---
Winner: Shaman, with the caveat that they are more gear dependent
---
PVP: 
---
Both are a blast. You'll have fun either way, I'm sure.
---
Utility:
---
Shaman is group utility king with things like grounding and tremor totem. 
---
Lock has cookies and summing stones. A well used fear can turn the tide of any fight.
---
Winner: I'm giving it to Shaman on this one.
---
WPVP:
---
Both are great at disengaging, which is what you want in WPVP.
---
Special Side Note: I know you are gonna PVE as a warrior, but I want to call out that Ele shaman raid damage is actually pretty dang good once you have some spell penetration gear. In the mean time, you can really stand out if you 1) bring mana pots and 2) really work on your downranking rotation.
---
They're based in France.
---
No it was bad for ganking and corpse camping
---
I think a lot of ppl are referring to the pservers that has been running over the years with 10k+ online which made STV a hell
---
Where are the basilisks?
---
This isn't about wanting WoW Classic to fail, it's about the naivete of players who never played Vanilla.
---
As for 'MC week 1', comparing what a world first tier raid group can do against what a bunch of average players can do is quite disingenuous.
---
How much did it cost to get it printed, Im looking around right now to get one printed for my self
---
Also not only are people more educated on the game now but the resources for just about everything they need to know is just a Google search away. So many people are going to be racing to 60 when Classic drops and they are all going to be fighting over the BIS items once they get there.
---
Hunter would fit perfect. PM me and let's talk details.
---
Nice!
---
Lol sounds like how it was in Diablo 2 to transfer!
---
You, my friend, are as dumb as a brick 😂
---
I might have explained myself pretty badly because english is not my first language. 
---
Noon can be on the screen for more than that 30 minutes, but time on queue doesn't count towards that limit. So, as you say, you need to aim to get to character select in that range, which won't be easy at all because of the queue dynamics explained in the post.
---
Sorry, I tried to have some fun writing it but it ended up being a confusing mess haha.
---
Being casual isn't some sort of immoral act
---
Yo, Grace. I've a question. 
---
What do you think the average age of people playing vanilla was?
---
Regardless of the people in this thread, you were arguing that it would be difficult look up gold selling sites on the internet in 2004.
---
What a weird way to flex about being an asshole.
---
100% play with friends... roll a Shaman instead!
---
Download an addon under the classic addon folder and it might appear!! :)
---
quick tip... create a bankalt first, no need to login on it. then you can mail stuff to it while you level your main character.
---
when you later get time, login to that bankalt and lvl to 5, run to main city and pickup enchanting. 
---
or just runt lvl1 to main city and do your business :)
---
Coming home and camping Kargath as a druid/rogue/NE Hunter gank squad was the most fun I've had gaming.
---
I'd spend hours every day after school and it never got old - it only got more fun as we became more notorious.
---
Can't wait to go home.
---
Is it pronounced "blow me"?
---
Former r13 lock 
---
That’s not true.
---
Only when the lock gets gear will they win 1v1
---
Pre Mc they still die.
---
I have no kids and I’m saying the same thing. With a job and plenty of chores to keep up on I imagine the ability to log 8-12 hours a day like my sophomore year of high school is not feasible.
---
30/0/21 or 31/0/20 are the ele specs so its ele / resto
---
Yeah i have like 10 and nothing thats the issue lol
---
That's a decent Warlock name

Awesome thanks for the tips, gives me some sound assurance that I’d be able to make it work
---
I used to be a night jock(DJ) at a radio station and I would bring in my PC during my shift and play.  You could sometimes hear the keyboard clicks while I raided and did a live break on air.  No one cares what happens at a radio station after 7pm, especially low paid employees.
---
apparently someone else than me :(
---
Im gonna miss my jellyfish......
---
Eh, depends. Vendor gold is quite a bit for those who power level properly. I'll be doing an in-depth guide on power leveling but it's a bit more of a complicated subject

If you're relying on skeletons to tell you "watch out," you're already in trouble.

---
This is very interesting. So i've calculated that it takes approximately 30sec pr.mob. Which is probably too much. So without traveling etc.   
---
It will be 16339 mobs in total times 30sec, resulting in 5,6 days only. Sound too easy to me?
---
it was 16 seconds and a day after the initial launch
---
Each guild is different as usually there is that one or two guys who are try-hard and provide a few important mats throwing off your questions.  The best way is to work from this list of raid consumables backwards to the mats. Then source the mats out. For instance the Feralas Island for Chimera Steak.  Hope this helps!

yeah i guess i didn't have enough opportunities to wipe my group as a mage or  rogue.
---
You will play the game much longer and get much more enjoyment if you play with friends.
---
I once sat here for 3 days looking for the vultures
---
For leveling, Enhance then Elemental maximizes your damage output. After the 40s it is possible (some say optimal) to respec and go Elemental/Resto. You can heal as Ele/Resto, and since your dps won't amount to much in raids, you are really better off healing. If you end up in a serious raiding situation, you may want to spec full resto but let's not put the cart before the horse, that's a while away yet.
---
I quit during Legion, the game stopped being fun to play long before that.
---
There is a part of me that's conflicted between Classic WoW or FFXIV in the long run, since I like both games for entirely different reasons. But I am *definitely* never playing Retail WoW again.
---
Even in games with a 3 character limit? How much money could these people possibly be spending
---
Completely agree, the guy obviously never played vanilla. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and it's great that new people are coming in. But he clearly had no idea what he was talking about, but presented himself as an authority on the subject.
---
r/boneappletea
---
I don’t believe there ever was one for vanilla. You basically can only track one node at a time regardless of what your looking for, quest items included. 
---
Maybe someone with beta experience can prove me wrong, but I doubt that was a change.
---
Yeah combat swords. Level first aid , cooking and fishing unless you can afford to buy them. They will help with the downtime after fights. 
---
I’m still torn between rogue which was my original main in vanilla or going warlock for an easier leveling experience since I can’t play the same amount I used to. 
---
Also try to make sure to keep lockpicking leveled with you
---
You can go into naxx in t2. Like I said, some bosses in aq40 are harder than anub.
---
Aq20 and zg are fine carch up mechanics, if you are away for 6 months. I don't know which gear you think people went into naxx. But our not so hardcore raid on an rp server? 
---
We were not a 40 man raid covered in aq40 gear.
---
Maybe you have to lower you expectations of naxx, you are going to be disappointed, when you find out that it wasn't that hard, that there were other factors involved in the raid.
---
Which you don't know.
---
Classic players drink free? :)
---
I think it becomes an option if you right click their name. The one pserver I played that had reporting worked like that. I think Retail is similar, but I don't know for sure.
---
WTB rare names on EU PvP servers, your preferred currency. 
---
Specifically Calm, Dawn, Wild, Pale, Bone
---
But open to any!
---
no idea about STV, but redridge is going to be a shitshow
---
I wish you would have included a class breakdown as well... would have been awesome!
---
I don't see anything wrong with it, at least the way I use it (or rather, used it on private servers).
---
It basically just filtered the chat for keywords and "pinned" these messages, so I could instantly see whenever someone was looking for members for a dungeon I was interested in.
---
I'd still whisper the person to get an invite, I'd still talk about stuff like when we're going to start and how long it's gonna take, I'd still talk about whether it's possible to summon,.., you name it.
---
In the years I played private servers, I'd never encounter someone who solely did LFG/LFM through said AddOn. So I assume most people used it just as a glorified chat-filter. Breaking this addon would mean potentially breaking many other chat-related AddOns. 
---
Given that I don't think it'll be anything even remotely close to LFG in current WoW, given that I don't think people will not communicate anymore, given that it might break other Addons, given that it was literally possible and a part of actual Vanilla, I think I'm all for leaving this AddOn as-is.
---
I mean there are addons like gatherer that will show you where the usual spawn locations are, but there aren't any that are going to be able to allow you to actually track two types of resources at once. You'd have to look for the resource you're not tracking manually or keep switching between the two. Mining nodes are a bit easier to spot and they're almost always near hills/mountains or rocks.
---
AMA was good, but skeleton decistion doesnt make sense. It existed in classic and it wasnt a huge deal. #nochanges
---
It was a warzone on Nost forsure
---
 @ [7:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iquurVrL4l8&amp;t=428s) nails it!  I think we should keep it hard like this!  This is why Classic &gt; Retail!
---
??? They are in Irvine California? Is a specific team based in France?
---
Awesome info, thanks.
---
No, but it's the ideal response to the question "what realm are you on?" :~}
---
Exactly
---
You couldn't have been on a pvp realm
---
Simply people that decided on swapping to new servers didn't delete their characters on first realms as there is no point to do so
---
Yes precisely. It could be a frostbolt too
---
You can heal just fine in raids as a ret paladin.  No decent guild is gonna let a ret paladin dps but you can heal in raid and dps in pvp and other shit
---
Ya lol those days are done.
---
I love all of Wyoming. I'm back in Ky now, but really want to live there again for a few years now that I'm older. Give me 80mph winds.

Can I use it for tailoring and blacksmihing to ? Or just enchanting

!remindme 2 days
---
2h Fury is DEFINITELY the better PvE spec; it's not close.  Arms is probably fine for dungeons though.  In the interest of saving crap tons o' gold, I'd probably do dungeons and farming/WPvP in arms, and just switch to fury for raid night.
---
Can never go wrong with Jeremy Soule mate, good choice. Tasca's Demise has been my alarmsound for over 10 years now, no joke!
---
each player's experience will be different and nobody can predict your experience
---
no cause I'm not going to play on that server. just feel bad for people who arent aware of what he is going to do to that server.
---
There will be plenty of Dwarf Priests out there. And half the Alliance is Human. Be cool and roll Night Elf Priest.

WoW Classic will not be free to play. You need an active WoW subscription to play($15 a month) but there is no base game fee though so that’s good.
---
Since no one else has suggested yet, I'd recommend contacting him

Thank you! Awesome response man.

Oh boy, found the fucking Weasley boy that didn’t get a letter

lets totally attack him based on his appearance  not his personality. for the record i find this guy annoying as hell but i still wouldnt resort to making fun of the way he looks
---
Chat isn't layered. Our guild tested this in the stress test.
---
Again, how does this hurt classic? Since it's basically just a bulletin board, how does this hurt the classic experience? 
---
The LFM spam in global channels is not a highlight of the classic experience.
---
hangug saram ieyo?
---
I don't really judge people based on what they do in a video game but you can do that if you want. You sound boring as hell anyway, which is why I'm glad the sensitive crowd is in the minority and not a very vocal one at that. Could you imagine if you guys were in control, you'd have blizzard banning people for inconveniencing you  or removing spells like mind control LOL.
---
"You must be fun at parties" as much as I hate the phrase, applies to you heavily.

Stop paying attention to this twat, and he will go away

Sorry was late last night. It's the old one.

I can give away every gold trick I know and I won't care. 
---
All the knowledge in the world won't overcome the laziness of the average WoW player. If there's a few other sharks on my server (if I created them or not), the market will be big enough that I can work around them.
---
Lizard beats rock.
---
that mouse has seen some shit
---
&gt; I don't think your analogy applies, but good attempt at being clever.
---
You just don't understand the analogy.  They added flying mounts because people asked for them, and everyone thought they would be cool.  What they didn't realize is it would kill world PvP, the feeling of immersion in the game world, kill the sense of danger and exploration, and add to the ever-increasing cycle of mounts outdoing each other until everyone is flying around on Deathwing.
---
I'm fully aware that there is content in TBC and Wrath that requires flying.  That is part of the reason that going back to doing TBC and Wrath would doom us to reliving the same mistakes over again.
---
And your solution to adding fatigue doesn't address any of these problems at all.  It just adds an annoyance to the system.  So I repeat: you have a core structural problem and you think duct tape will fix it.
---
Don't think there will be full clears either, mostly because you need the Aqual Quintessence. It's a chain, requires honored with Hydraxian waterlords and to kill four of the bosses. So to actually manage that in the first week you'll need to farm MC trash until honored, and then kill the bosses.
---
Onyxia chain can be a hassle as well, especially considering the UBRS key is a bit of RNG to get. 
---
Generally I guess a few of the first bosses in MC will fall week one, but not much more.
---
I think you may have an STD.
---
Clearly the higher your level, the more chance you've had to drink milk. Naturally, that means your bones last longer because of your superior Lvl. 60 calcium intake.
---
O.o yeah that is true! And chests!
---
Warrior is not fun to casually level. You will hit 32 and get bored. Same with every class besides Warlock. The only option is to play Warlock exclusively.
---
I thought I remembered something like this from Blizzcon. Thanks for linking the timestamp! I hope they follow through with this. Given their track record so far, I think there's good reason to believe that they will. As a side-note, this directly addresses most of the comments in this thread defending the addon.
---
would hate to be in his guild . you know hes going to nab all the best loot first
---
Bugs will survive everything. Skeram for life!
---
It's almost like this didn't exist in vanilla or on pservers.     
---
vQueue/oQueue/CallToArms
---
This is the same information I've heard. Proudmoore is definitely the unofficial LGBT server in retail, and most folks from there are going to Atiesh.
---
They won't release that information because it would lead to being able to get a "somewhat" accurate player count. It's a secret. shush.
---
Have you played a warlock before? I think that would be your best bet. High dps, solid pets, no gear overlaps, and free mounts. Are you four considering profession overlaps? I imagine you'd also be the only one using tailoring/enchanting if you went that route.
---
The only desired healer on horde side period is shaman. Only class that would be perfectly fine have 8 of healing in a raid.
---
Definitely friends! I wanted to go horde to roll a shaman as I was alliance back in the day, but all of my friends want to go back to alliance for the nostalgia. The best times I had was when I was playing with friends or close guildies that became friends, so I'll take one for the team. Plus, I can always make that shaman on another server to scratch that itch.
---
i like that its on a membership now because everyone wont use the same guide :)
---
You're not a druid and the flag carrier is. He's also got a swiftness potion.

I'm not saying this can't work, but I'd recommend going to AV and topping the kills board instead of trying to play a game with actual teamwork required like WSG.

---
Player to player is fine, it's the ones who play for you and bot your account for X hours is the problem.
---
Shaman are probably in higher demand just because people want your totems. Especially wind fury. But IMO they are the worst healers while leveling

Clearly, you'll need [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]

I can't find any accurate vanilla sources, but on recent private servers it was a world drop from 58-60 elites. I guess we'll see on classic.

Optimally you can go for anything with gtx1050 or above with an i3 processor
---
If he's continually updating it with new routes, optimizations etc. then why not? In fact the fee may be justified just by the convenience of being able to access it easily from his website instead of having to save all of it in some obscure file on your pc. If his pricing model is right all comes down to the perceived value of his service.
---
Why what happened to the goat?
---
LMAO fair enough
---
Blizzard broke Decursive (and all other addons + macros that can automate your actions for you) when TBC came out. It won't work in Classic because Classic is based on the retail game engine.
---
Oh yes I agree.
---
while true , it wont matter yeah person x has a crap rep on the server but hes in the streamer guild so hes gonna have plenty of people to help him. if anything its going to make it easier to be a jerk
---
yes it's the reddit bubble
---
&gt; it's just going to eliminate the need to actually talk to people to form groups
---
You're really romanticizing what it means to form a group.
---
Sitting in Orgrimmar spamming "LF1M Tank UBRS" is not communicating.  It's just spamming.  And when the tank is ready, he just whispers and says "Invite" or maybe "60 Warrior?" and you invite him and go on your way.
---
What's the difference between that and this addon?
---
tier 1 and 2 sets arnt great for locks so i wouldnt rush it
---
Servers should stabilize by the time you’re done class, you won’t miss anything
---
I want to PvP. Im pretty stupid. Want to play a Mage or Lock. Which is easier to play as well as a lower skill gap
---
It's not ignorance.
---
A lot of people seem to forget that it's a game, and treat it like a job instead.  
---
Back in Vanilla and BC, I was a casual member of a top raiding guild on my server.   
---
We had a "sister guild" headed by the single father of two small children with mobility and other health problems. That GL still managed to have and share a lot of fun in the game. I frequently joined his groups for instances and we also ran a lot of the long questlines together.  
---
We didn't have the best gear, but we certainly had some of the best fun. Unfortunately, the GL and at least a few of the guildies I played with quit after BC...  
---
Hoping to find another fun group this time around.

This was always the dream for me after watching a priest video called "ring of fire" or something like that back in the day. My friends and I pushed people off a cliff during the launch of Cata for around 4-5 hours. Here is the best part, your body landed in a way that your spirit didn't get a mount so you had to spirit res...  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6WmqDy6dos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6WmqDy6dos) . Were we assholes? Yes. Was it some of the most  fun we eve had in the game? Also Yes.
---
IKR, who wants to actually talk to other people to form groups! That's not why we're here, we just want the superior mechanical challenge of vanilla encounter design.
---
Shamans are greatly desired for raids and dungeons. They have amazing AoE heal and Totems.
---
Not that Priests aren't desired as well ofc. They fill the single target heal role on the Horde side.
---
What next? Flying mounts and dungeon finder?
---
Just go play modern wow.
---
If you find enough people actually using it.  You're still going to be communicating while you do the four hour BRD run.  It also isn't any different than doing a dungeon run with your guildies, is it?  You aren't picking from people wandering the world with you, you're only picking from guild mates.
---
It's like people just can't wait to find a new way to hate their own experience.  Gotta go find one more thing to cry about!

Nobody used that shit on pservers, but now that there will be a surge of casuals playing classic addons like this one will become popular and forced onto the community like gearscore once was.

Leader: "want to &lt;role&gt; &lt;dungeon&gt;?"

That's about the extent of what this would remove.  Which, guess what, you could STILL DO even if most people use this addon!

Own accounts

The VoDs would be available for everyone to watch once he turns off sub only vods.
---
Basically what he's saying is if there's such a high volume of people already trying to get in, there'll be a log-in queue before you even reach the character select screen. 
---
If you could get straight in then yes, you would want to log in 29.9 mins prior, but in his scenario you're alread too late because there's too many people in front of you and it won't matter about being kicked from the character select screen because you won't see it before the servers unlock anyway because you'll be stuck in a queue.

Hi, /u/Dav5152
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cto017/is_it_true_that_eu_launch_is_0000/). 
---
How so? It filters the chat (in the case of LFM) and writes in the chat (in the case of LFG), and you still have to form the group yourself (so you'd whisper the other person, talk about level, role etc.).
---
Maybe there is something I actually missed, but to me it seems like most people didn't even bother reading what this AddOn actually does.
---
There has been a LGBT server since launch of Vanilla in 2004. It's not a big deal.
---
There are also servers for Army veterans, French Canadians, 4chan users, Reddit guilds, Streamers, and so on. It's not usual or embarrassing or irrational...
---
But you don't seem to have a problem with any of those other groups picking a server to roll on, only LGBT people. What's embarrassing is how you're trying to blame LGBT people for your own obvious homophobia.
---
I still have like 500-600 vanilla screenshots and I'm very glad I kept them. For example, Rendz (rank 14 undead rogue) first showing me how to do exactly what you are talking about while on his Alliance spy alt.
---
https://i.imgur.com/b5jbPxn.jpg
---
Not a huge deal since they can just right click to invite/whisper/etc you. But it does inconvenience other people slightly.
---
Yes, i got a spreadsheet only though :D You can find it on my discord(will add that in some minutes to the main post) in #FAQ

Its viable for 1-5 as ive excluded all awfull dropchane quests, all elite quests are marked(or should be) optional so u can skip them as 1-2man lvling etc.

None of the filing cabinets in the old home can move to the new home because they are very old structural elements of the house itself and they use some archaic format from back when all paper documents were exactly six inches square and were always stapled.  
---
The filing system has been set up by the family accountant and he insists that everything must be filed using his methodology for organization.  It is nothing like the old system, and even if it was, you had stacks of papers on the floor anyway because they didn’t fit in the old cabinets and you just made do.  If he finds one thing that’s misfiled, he throws out all your work for the day and tells you to start over.  
---
Grandmother wants all the family photos in this new digital format she’s heard of.  She’s heard of this “Book of Faces” where all of her friends have been sharing photos and she has selected this as the storage solution.  She sees no reason for the old photos to be kept and has demanded they be shredded immediately.  She has seniority over the family photos project, so no one can tell her how bad of an idea this is.  No, you can’t have a scanner, it costs money and is unnecessary.  
---
Meanwhile, there are three filing cabinets in the attic no one is aware of except your autistic cousin who has been handling document retrieval for Uncle John.  It contains critical information, like the deed to the land and all the tax records for 1976-2010.  There’s also the family chocolate chip cookie recipe in there for some reason and someone fifty years ago stashed fifty thousand in gold bullion in there and didn’t tell anyone.  When you move into the new home, your cousin can no longer find the information he used to get for Uncle John.  He can’t explain why or where it is so he just sits on the floor and cries.  You don’t know why he’s crying and refusing to get the documents.  Uncle John doesn’t either.

He's tauntable.
---
I've always agreed with this, but it's hard to articulate why exactly. Most people say more content is better hands down, but for me I prefer having a few specific things to work towards. Having 50 things collected doesn't feel that special or interesting, but if you have one super rare specific thing it's an achievement and gives a sense of reward every time you just look at it in your inventory.
---
I hate bloat, and it's my biggest complaint with many modern games. Mmo's are the worst offenders, with most gameplay reduced to filling in a pointless collection of useless things(mounts, skins, pets, etc). Old school mmo's like EQ, DAoC, and vanilla didn't have this ridiculous bloat, and is one of the reasons I'm looking forward to Classic.
---
And forget resilience ever existed...
---
So you mean if I use this addon, I'll actually be able to have fun and play the game instead of just spamming /1 all day looking for a tank?
---
I fail to see how this is "worse".
---
Most people will grab someone else if they can. I'd just keep the alt code handy when trying to join groups.
---
You have no idea what the mod is but are hard assume based on the title.

I’ll admit a much better name would be better but at least look what it does before calling it “LFG queue”...

Shaman is just as good as Priest for 5 mans.
---
In raids Priest has higher throughput but a Shaman is just as useful since he also has totems.
---
Do you know if it will still be free up to a certain level?

Yes, I am the Owner of the TUGs guide. The AddOn is made by someone else though :)
---
Pro tip: follow the mushroom trail to not get lost.
---
Needs "RP" as primary content.
---
Damn bro that sucks.    I mean I wasted, what, 5-10 minutes of this kids time after I'd dealt with him spamming me and the inappropriate channels for much longer than that. So far I've been called toxic and a pussy.  Like people are legit mad that I dealt with this guy in an ultimately 100% harmless way.  They're gonna lose their minds the first time they invest weeks into a raid and have their shit ninja looted.   I'm honestly concerned about people lol.
---
it proofs that i got the name reserved
---
it proofs that it was only free for like 15 seconds
---
thats more proof than you claim?
---
yikes, dude.
---
Was hoping not to, but it may have to be that way ha ha
---
This isn't proof of botting. Dude might just be trying to get the name once a day and you deleted your toon at the worst possible moment.
---
We only smoke trees now
---
Oh fuck yeah
---
I love your story. Have fun in classic. Server?
---
For raids priests healed more and were more desired.
---
For dungeons priests were still very desired but the shaman has reincarnate as wipe protection (so if he had some restoration points he was amazing to have in dungeons)
---
Nobody:
---
Absolutely nobody:
---
Everyone with a YouTube channel: “HEY GUYS CHECK OUT THIS NEW GUIDE TO SHIT YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT I WANT VIEWS SO CLICK IT”
---
&gt; What we also know, and it is very important to keep this in mind for later on, is that "Medium" capacity is the same for all regions, all realm types, and all language based realms.
---
Do you have a source on this one? All I have heard is that the population status values are 'relative'.
---
Lol whoever made this doesn’t realize scarab lord wasn’t even in Vanilla. The title was added in TBC.
---
Locks are a little tankier and you can just dot and run away in bgs while still being helpful.
---
You might want to roll Warlock and just spam dots and Curse of Tongues.
---
It's quite interesting to see that EU is missing things like a designated Streamer/LGBTQ+ server. 🤔
---
Juan Ceirva
---
I remember when internet was 56kb too,so? The World evolves and AddOns existed back then too, guides were browser based,now its ingame...oh noes :D
---
Yes that was it! Hrmm I may have my old install on a HDD some where I'll have to see if my add-ons are still there.
---
Your best bet is to swipe, see the three hits, and line up a fat maul or auto swing or faerie fire on the last target. Maul does many times more threat per cast than swipe, so you'll have to do this anyway to solidify threat with a maul on each target
---
This sure will happen, but if they aren't the biggest group op the community this will not break the game when they had there fun.
---
Apart from that I really don't get why they wanna rush everything when they have been waiting for this for so long! 
---
I at first will just enjoy the journey to 60. Which will take me a while because I am not planning on rushing the experience. Then there are a lot of things I am planning on doing @ 60. 
---
So my wow journey will be a while and as I can guess now a lot of people will be playing like me and you. So that means there still are a big bunch of people left when the min maxers are done.
---
I will be able to put in around 25-35 hours a week for this game so I can't call my self "casual" nor "eletist.  I have a total different mindset for this game.
---
It'll be a lot less boring (and more efficient) if you level as arms. You will actually have an easier time tanking as arms with a sword/shield on because you will generate more threat.
---
Don't play on that server. In 2-3 months tops half or more of the streamers will move on along with their fans and the server will be a graveyard.
---
pun..intended?
---
Life chat and tickets ?
---
And his sweeping leg kick created the universe!
---
I paid for the original guide like 12-15 years ago or something. Never expected it to be free.
---
Yeah most of them went hot on my playlist but stained was hottest
---
Why are you gonna go through so many hoops to avoid paying a guy, whose content you like?
---
Here's a link to an older version of Joana's guide for you guys that want to use that instead.  
---

---
I loved it, there was so much PvP on a PvE server. This time I’m rolling on a PvP server. It’s going to be chaotic.
---
This guy got it. I was trying to think of an analogy.
---
Low effort
---
seconding this.
---
Shaman
---
Maybe Lucifron, but that’s it, if I remember correctly you need several hunters with the skill book that drops from him to kill Magmadar because the cool down on tranquil shit is too long to use in-between enrages.
---
Shame
---
Stop trying too hard to farm karma xD
---
Yeah sorry, had to use twitch footage, will make a new video dont know if before launch though. 
---
Yes you can change the alpha of the background.
---
Canada?
---
You literally have to do that, even with the addon.
---
Fuck, at least spend 30 seconds reading the fucking post you link.
---
I'd kick someone doing that instantly, but you won't find many people here on Reddit willing to do it unless it affects them directly. :/
---
Where is your horde flair with that comment.
---
Don't fret, logging in should be a shitshow #nochanges
---
Nice...I guess? :D
---
You'd have to open the Character creation screen and close it every 20 minutes or so to prevent timing out
---
I linked them elsewhere in this thread. I'm on my phone so don't have access to them.
---
I feel like it was still committed to your old deleted character, have you tried again since?
---
Well the reason WoW got to be this way is because people were perpetually crying about not having enough content. "I don't want to be pressured to do world quests" 
---
Vanilla doesn't have much content either, it just pads it out with crazy grinds.
---
Damned if you do damned if you don't. Well see how long classic lasts once asmongold raids org for the 50th time and people drop because they don't have enough time to commit
---
What I mean is in retail we tend to put things into 1 of 4 buckets: Tanks, Heals, Mdps, Rdps. Things have been homogenized across classes and that has changed how we think about class roles. Therefore using that "retail thinking," if you are not one of the best at *doing ranged DPS*, you have little value elsewhere.
---
This is different in classic where you have value *as a shaman* even if you aren't topping DPS meters. Now that value might be more niche than other classes which is why raids take less of you, but it's still needed regardless. You are not only how much DPS you can do - which is how we tend to think in retail.
---
there is a live chat / tickets for classic already?
---
Dude a lot of people used it on pservers. Like there's no reason not to. It literally scans through a cancer filled world chat to see the messages that you care about. That's what it is there for and I don't really see an issue with it.
---
Me and some friends never played WoW before, but the release of classic got us into it. I think that classic will attract a new audience as well.
---
Simply move the character folder over to the retail -&gt; WTF -&gt; Account -&gt; [server name] folder.  That should work.
---
Just the shitstorm from the paywall alone has introduced 100s I'd not 1000s of people to the fact it exists. I promise you, people will subscribe.
---
There are plenty of free guides coming out. It's up to you to decide if Joanas is better and worth a fee
---
I have screenshots of the first Oondasta kill ever which had multiple 40man raid groups from servers illidan and mal'ganis thousands of skeletons on the ground after
---
Can work with both addons mentioned but:

---
right there with ya.
---
It feels like everyone peaked in WotLK because it was by far the most popular expansion in the games history, averaging over 11 million subscribers the entire expansion, and peaking at over 12 million.
---
It more people peaked because more people were playing.
---
Oh okay cool, shame I was going to get a few hours of sleep before going all night. Guess that’s out the window then.
---
I’m not very well taught in photoshop.
---
Very big bias, especially involving server choice
---
Yes, is the short answer.
---
You would never burn a pummeler as an off tank in a raid, because there is no one really competing with you for threat. You can build up so much threat before any other folks touch the mob.
---
In dungeons, it probably wouldn't be worth it to burn a pummeler charge either.  The fights just aren't high stakes enough to warrant it.
---
There's certainly nothing stopping you from main tanking, particularly in the early raids, class-wise.  Some raid leaders may be more elitist / old fashioned and insist on a warrior, but you would certainly be up to the task. In those instances though, you'd probably want a pummeler. Keep in mind though, that each pummeler has three charges, so that's only like two. Only about 15 minutes worth of preparation.
---
I know less about power shifting then about tanking. You'd be lower on the charts, but not dead last among dpsers.  But pretty low tho, tbh.   But it comes down again to the raid leaders.
---
On the plus side, there are definitely specs that let you both tank and DPS effectively.  I'll see if I can link one.
---
Overall, I say go for it. If you play with chill people, it'll be fine. Dungeons are pretty low stakes after all.
---
I will add the caveat though, that you WON'T be able to heal that well if you take the talent spec that lets you both tank and DPS. It's sort of a "choose two" situation.
---
Hope that helps.
---
yeah true but its highly unlikely to happen in exactly this 15 seconds tbh
---
Yes, it scans your quest progress and your current quest log, you can pickup any second you want and it will adjust accordingly.
---
Guys, it was not the smartest move from him. Don't mind. There are a lot of other speeders which provides equal content with Ingame addon. If you like the paywall and joanas guides, support him. If you would like to take a look out of the box, you will be surprised. Joana is not the best, he is the more famous.
---
There was an AMA yesterday (or maybe Monday) and this question was answered. They will be restarting the servers before launch but they recommend people log in minutes before launch because the Enter World button will light up when servers are open.
---
I ran on a potato and hope in tbc and raided at 2 fps. You'll live.
---
Who's High Pitch?
---
What does being a streamer have to do with this? Like, I get that people don't want to play with them but this honestly reads like one of these sarcastic "THANKS OBAMA" posts. Simply time your login so you will reach character screen roughly 30 min before the servers go live and you're good.
---
I really miss Ironforge being the central hub. You go there now its practically a ghost town the only time i see it busy is present day during winter veil.
---
&gt; Fuck, at least spend 30 seconds reading the fucking post you link.
---
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!  THE HEADLINE SAYS LFG AND MAKES THINGS EASIER!  THAT MEANS IT'S CANCER AND DOESN'T BELONG!

---
I used to beat hunters with my warrior.  Not easy, but possible.
---
You haven't solved it, other people have. You probably know less than 40% of this game.
---
All this will eliminate are the *"lvl-class, inv"* responses to your LFM spams. You'll still want to hold an actual conversation with people to apply to make sure that they know the content, and won't leave when they don't get their targeted drop. All stuff you'd be doing in forming a group through spamming anyways.
---
Warlock is also powerful if you are ever questing alone since they can let pets absorb damage there isnt much need for taking breaks (although the same can be said for hunters, although you would conflict with gear for the shammy). I'm assuming the shaman is expected to being doing some healing but shadow priests can also be deadly and offer decent heals if needed

**Introduction:**  
---
Dead Naga Storage is a guild build specifically for the launch of WoW Classic. GET EXCITED! We were a very powerful and progressive filled guild back in the original Vanilla days in 2005. We have great guild leadership experience and Raid and PvP leadership experience as well as BG shot calling since 2005 – present day. We are a PvE-focused progression and PvP inspired guild interested in filling our teams with dedicated members who are willing to be available and dedicate themselves to learn their roles and characters for our core 40m Raid and WPvP groups. We plan on having quite a few raid and pvp teams set up within a couple weeks or months. Our members are expected to clearly and consistently put forth effort to be as knowledgeable as possible on their class, BiS, be mature, and skilled players. We want you to be competitive!! Our leaders have a lot of experience in clearing major raids like MC, BWL, Onyx, Zul Gurub, AQ and Naxx so you know you’re joining a great guild. MC we will be going in at week 1 of raid launch! We also want our members, during the beginning of the launch, to help with grouping up for quick and easy dungeon clears and group quests or ganking help. We are first and foremost a family here and protect each other!
---
**Goals:** Ultimately, our goal is to efficiently complete all raid content that WoW Classic has to offer! NO EXCEPTIONS! We aim to keep a lean, tight-knit, fun, and mature guild we can all call home and be proud of! When we are not raiding, be expected to push high-tier PvP ranks through coordinated team in BG’s and WPvP! **WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR, AND DO NOT WANT ANY SELF SERVING PLAYERS… THIS IS TEAM BASED PROGRESSION GUILD!**
---
**PvE – What we are looking for specifically:** Solid players who are interested in pushing content while also being afforded the option of a flexible raid schedule. We want people who want to be a part of a community. We are looking currently for Class Leaders, Raid Leaders, and PvP Leaders for our multiple groups. At first lets focus on leveling up and having fun! We will be in MC on week 1 of the raid launching **We are currently accepting players of all classes and roles.** ATM our raid times will be projected around 8:00 p.m. EST (times may change accordingly)
---
**PvP – What we are looking for specifically:** Serious players who are looking to push ranks very early on and either know the Honor system or be willing to learn it. **Accepting players of all classes and roles currently.** We are actively looking for PvP/Premade Leaders as well.
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council system.

So would you be OK with this AddOn if it *just* was a chat-filter and *just* wrote in chat for you? I don't think the "social network within the game" is gonna be used alot if at all with this AddOn.
---
he didnt spend any time on it  ?
---
Yeah I’m quite sad about it. If you find it anywhere let me know.
---
If your video showed a script running and take the name capslock when you deleted it that would be proof. This just shows the name capslock was taken when you deleted your character, not that a script was used.
---
[vanillafriends.com/index.php](https://vanillafriends.com/index.php)
---
4 people from that guild has registered already and have contact info there.
---
I never stated that it will he surpass the original wow and I doubt it have millions of player but it definitely won’t be a failed product but you right we can’t predict it we will just have to see
---
That's definitely gonna be my approach. I usually only start downloading addons once I hit max level in order to get ready for raids.  
---
Might be different in Vanilla without such perks as vendor price on items, or more than three quests tracked at once, but even that will take me a while to get around to.
---
Thanks all for the replies, I'll check that one out
---
That's a big gamble if you need the sleep. Who's to say of Blizzard will bring the servers down, say, 30 minutes before launch just to get a full refresh on them? You'd essentially have just wasted hours for nothing.
---
no :)
---
They will be restarting the servers before launch and that will boot everyone out. Blue Post said to log in "minutes" before launch to access the character select window and then the Enter World button will light up when they're ready
---
I stuffed around a lot in vanilla, took me 8 months to get to 60 the first time.  I never got an alt to 60 without help and I have to admit I payed one of the boys to do it for me while I was working.  Ill be using zygors to get up there, again working full time I don't really have the time to dedicate to full time play so I am taking all the help I can get.
---
It was until MoP I’d say. Good Blizzard lore started dying in TBC when they butchered characters like Kael’thas. Ended when we defeated the Lich King. Everything after that has been garbage storytelling with the exception of few side stories (Elisande).
---
No problem. Good luck! I think a little more audio information would go a long way.
---
I'm torn - I have a friend 100% going Lock and another 100% going Priest.  I was dead set on going Undead Warlock with an Orc Rogue as an alt (level when he has rested XP).  Recently I've been thinking about playing a Shaman though.  I think 3 characters is a bit unrealistic, and I can't decide which 2 to go with.  I might dump the Rogue for the Shaman as my alt, but Rogues just seem like so much fun.  Of the 3, Warlock is still feeling like the best choice to main, but this is tough!
---
Fuck I'm so ready to make my hunter
---
Only $5? I thought it was $20-30 with all the complaining. I was actually going to be a little upset with it if it was that much, but that's nothing.
---
yes multiple times even did create a new one with a different name and deleted it again but still gone.
---
I think leveling guides are extremely useful and almost mandatory if you want to level fast/efficiently. There are random lead-in/breadcrumb quests from halfway across the world that you wont know about unless youve been practicing leveling for a long time.
---
Leveling guides also usually have good weapon progression which speeds up kill times and makes everything go faster. Being able to efficiently jump from zone to zone while hitting the efficient/level appropriate quests and then jumping to the next one speeds you up a lot.
---
Take for example Darkshore. In the guide that I follow, I go there right at level 12, and stay until 15. Then go to westfall from 15-17, go to SW and train. Jump over to Redridge from 17-18, train again in SW, fly to menethil, check for a limiter supply weapon from a vendor, and then take the boat to Darkshore from 18-20 to hit up the higher level quests there before moving on to Ashenvale.
---
It all flows smoothly and efficiently as possibly from people who have been working on these guides for years. I highly recomend [Judgement's Alliance leveling guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H0AWJMvQSIrFdZMTRYcYZcWBsjCPZmy9eHygEWMsKU/edit#) that I'm using.
---
I'm having a issue on what to play. I plan to start playing with a friend, but he will probably lose interest in it soon so I want to have something that can be done solo, at least not completely difficult, and I don't really care how long it takes for the class to level, I'll get to 60 soon enough. I plan to look for a guild to join and aim to raid once I find a class to main. I'll be going horde and playing on PvP server (Herod or Stag).
---
I was thinking rogue since I can pick my fights, I like the look of their sets and if need be I can get out of a bad situation, but a downside is there will be so many so gearing will be quite an issue. Hunters look pretty neat, can solo simply due to a pet, strong 1v1 potential if played properly, finding and taming pets etc. Warlocks/Mages also attract me, but a big turn off for me is if I have to use a wand, wands look weird to me as a mage, would much prefer staves.
---
Any tips and such would be much appreciated!
---
one of the only quests I ever remember abandoning
---
I'm still baffled why they didn't make this the EU French server. Missed opportunity.
---
Generally speaking, nobody can predict it. It's some combination of joining the right Guild and being social and making friends and being good enough at your class to get as much out of it as possible, compensate for any perceived shortcomings with consumables and punctual attendance and other things and helping lowbies and pretty much a million and one things
---
Anyway I've seen the word of viable used so many times that it really doesn't have meaning
---
Does anyone have this in pdf so i can print it at work
---
Thanks. I just think that it would make no sense for them to pick such a specific scene of an iconic location yet that isn't present anywhere in Warcraft even to this day of its not a metaphor. Yes there were loads of secret dark portals scattered around random places during ancient wow times, but even then none in a location like this
---
You are amazing, tyvm
---
If you actually read through the comment section you would realise the few people who are annoyed, are annoyed at the last minute bait-and-switch.  
---
Nearly every single person agrees he should be paid for his work.  They just don't like his method as its fairly scummy to state something will be free(he did) and then suddenly charge for it.
---
[No they didn't, this is what they said about players leaving skeletons.](https://i.imgur.com/GB0favt.png)
---
Here's my leveling guide:
---
Sometimes you will find NPCs with a ! above their heads. Speak to them for a quest, and then do it. Repeat until level 60.
---
That will be $5 for this month, thank you.
---
Stop caring about me telling people not care about caring about skeletons
---
Lol I'm sorry you're upset by the reality that these addons existed in vanilla but I'll shit on you in literally any expansion of wow
---
It is if those people enjoy the guild atmosphere and signed up for it.  Some of us dont mind clearing things a bit slower as long as were doing it with people we enjoy spending time with.
---
Lol I love that man. Imitation truly is the highest form of flattery
---
But if we're being symbolic here he is also undead, you can not kill something that is already dead and as such the server will live on forever.
---
Does anyone have Arctic on any east pvp realms?
---
Dude has some real cringy beliefs and behaviour, but his content is at worst mildly diverting. And hey, at the very very very least, he's a gateway to other WoW youtubers and streamers.
---
Good work. That's the best option trying to get her hooked on classic. Hopefully she enjoys it and you can play in peace without feeling guilty.
---
Stolen keys most like, just like the ones you can find for pennies on the dollar for most games today on sites of I'll repute
---
Okay guys. I've been horde since 2004. I really love the horde but I've been seeing a lot of people say they're swapping to experience the other side. Id feel so sad not being able to chill in org and I'd feel bad murdering sweet little orcs. What do I do :(
---
But there were no guild banks in Vanilla.
---
Oh okay, thats unfortunate :(
---
If you start to feel sleepy burn yourself with a cigarette...
---
Here, just take your upvote and leave.
---
Kinda correct but this guy wants to play prot warrior, so he won't be using devilsaur anyway, and weapon skill also grants hit, I can't remember how much +7 is but it's more than 2%.
---
Hell yeah. I think there's this video out there with a guy that talks about this in amazing detail. Basically showcasing how the games like League of Legends and Call of Duty are catered towards the ... Special snowflake instant-gratification type crowd, while on the other end of the spectrum is OSRS, the end-all and be-all of educational gaming.
---
It's been a while, not sure if my terminology is correct but I believe this is the jist of it. 
---
But the video was so enlightening, because I myself agree with it so much. Always games are talked about as time-wastes, doing anything else would be better than gaming. However having grown up gaming a fair bit, and starting out with years of Runescape under my belt, I learned SO much about people and the world in those years. Like, even on the level of interpersonal people-skills. On a game.
---
All depends on your tastes really. Which race and/or class you gravitate towards. I think the Alliance races are easier to roleplay since they are more relatable to us (humans). But, it's really up to personal tastes. There will most definitely be all Dwarf guilds if that is what you're into. You don't need to be constantly roleplaying or "in character" either. But, RP realms always make me think up some background and story for the character I'm playing... 
---
*Dwarven Hunter, madly obsessed with Engineering and crafting the most deadly guns and explosives - but, also drunk most of the time so his contraptions have a high success of failing due to being heavily imbibed (also true in life). Part of an all Dwarf guild, of course. Frequently joins with a group of dwarven guildmates and heads to Hillsbrad to defend Southshore from the savage orcs and smelly undead invading. Gives him the opportunity to test out his latest bombs and guns on a worthy opponent.*
---
Gives the game a bit more flavor, and keeps me invested longer - and for me, the road to 60 will be a long one so of I want to hit endgame and enjoy what it has to offer the extra attachment and motivation helps a lot for longevity.
---
&gt; You can camp them hard enough they complain on the forums
---
Getting mentioned by name was one of my proudest moments.
---
Why would you not power shift?
---
"accident"
---
😂😂😂
---
You mean walk. For several hours. Then get lost for another several hours.
---
Yeah people seem to have an expectation that if they need X drop off Y boss for BIS pre-raid, they'll be able to get a group to just run straight to the boss and get them the item and everyone else is shit out of luck for other drops from other bosses.
---
worse, there's 2 g's so you know it's real bad
---
"huge aspect"...
---
The most important aspect is a clever name.
---
you didnt click wrong, it doesnt matter where you clicked once you get to the actual screen where you click create character, it defaulted you to a different server
---
I think what a lot of people are forgetting is that you don't play a *spec* in Vanilla/Classic, you play a *class*.  
---
Vanilla/Classic is very much rooted in the old school D&amp;D pen and paper philosophies of certain classes having roles in which they exceed at, but they can still do other things just not as well as the dedicated classes of each respective role.  
---
I loved my shaman alt, I cherished healing because I knew that I was a valuable shaman and my totem utility was needed.  
---
Outside of healing in raids, I ran around as enhancement in the world and in PvP and later switched to elemental with better gear. You're never just your spec like in current WoW, you're your *class.*
---
 [http://wowloretldr.com/](http://wowloretldr.com/)
---
No, seems like you've misunderstood. It's not about it being crucial information.
---
&gt;Glance isn't irrelevant. RB swings will either glance or not. WF swings will glance, but the occasional bonus swings will each individually roll for glance. 5 rolls per 5 swings vs 7 rolls per 5 swings. It matters.
---
I'm a bit confused by this post. Glances affect both windfury and rockbiter the same, no matter how many attacks there are. 
---
Assume we're not accounting for glances:
---
Add up all the damage done in 10 swings with windfury, and you get X damage. 
---
Add up all the damage done in 10 swings with rockbiter, and you get Y damage.

Now factor in glances. 40% of your hits are going to glance for 70% damage. Or in other words, the total output will be = .6x [the 60% of attacks that didn't glance) + .28x (the 40% of hits that glanced multiplied by .7 because they only do 70% damage). Or .88x. The same will hold true of rockbiter, since it doesn't change your chance to glance. Your total damage output with rockbiter with be .88y. 
---
So before glances windfury = x, and rockbiter = y. After glances, windfury = .88x and rockbiter = .88y. Thus, if x &gt; y before glances, then x &gt; y after glances, because it's the same negative modifier applied to both.

Pathetic, BFA babies rule this subreddit now

People like hanging out with people wth similar interests as them. Problem is that these places very quickly turn into echo chambers due to everyone sharing the same opinions. 
---
Happens all the time, especially on reddit. It’s so much easier to just join a safe space where everyone is going to agree with your opinions instead of arguing that you are wrong. People love that feeling of validation.

I think you are absolutely right. Or it might be an accidental touch of genius, but either way, how you explained it is an awesome way to think about it.

Literally the second bullet point in the description of the addon says that it will periodically post to a public channel of your choice to make people without the addon aware of your group.

Capslock is definitely a cool name, glad you got it
---
Ya, you are just fucked. Should have done some more research, there is a blue post saying the name is instantly available for others to take when you delete. With that info, the mass amount of people used a friend to take the name for you right as you delete it, then reverse that process when you have your character made. Lessons learned I guess.
---
When I went to change my name. I was using two of my own accounts. I deleted it on one account and went to create it on the other account but discord was popping off and blocking the accept button. I nearly had a heart attack as I frantically force closed discord and hit the accept button. My name was just floating out in the nether for like 10 seconds and I nearly died. LOL

It's necessary for those wanting to find a welcoming guild and decrease their chances of bumping into players who will harass them over their identity. It has no affect on you whatsoever, so why get worked up about it?

Back in the day when we were leveling we would always seek out priests above any other class. If we couldn't find a priest we would take a druid or worsts case pally.
---
Priest + soulstone
---
Both are fine, dwarfs are better in pvp.
---
interesting. guess well be in for a surprise :D

Equally likely as any other individual 15 second window in a day, 1/5760. The RNG gods not smiling on you today friend.

Personally I don't like RP servers for the idea of forced name changing. I follow naming conventions and is generally down to earth with my names as well, but the notion that the community has a hand in deciding what is eligible and what isn't is stupid.
---
If I name my character "Slayer" and the whole point of the character is that he is a nameless wanderer that hunts and slay evildoers, who are they to say that my name isn't a valid RP name?
---
Maybe it's less likely to happen in cases like that, but it still restricts the creative process of a breathing world imo.

Then they're not in the right place. Or the folder name is wrong for every single addon (has to be the exact same as the name of the `.toc` file inside it), but that's unlikely.

Y ajouter un trait semble indiquer qu'il y a une démarcation palpable, genre entre deux syllabes. La raison pour laquelle j'y ai mis le W est pour faire qu'ils se rappellent le mot Blow et donc pour rendre facile et familière la prononciation. C'est beaucoup plus convenable quand tu tentes d'expliquer aux américains hostiles à la francophonie d'employer les morceaux très familiers que de s'appuyer sur l'IPA.
---
J'apprécie ce que tu dis. Je t'assure que je ne prononce aucun W quand je dis mes [o]. Mais s'il y a une chose que je sais mieux que toi, c'est l'être amer, le ricain.

This guy made literally shittons of money last time around, I don't really blame him if he can get even a small fraction of that amount this time around.  Nostalgia is a big selling point for his guide just like the game itself is.
---
Btw, for everyone talking about creating a character to reset timer.... Let me just say why don't you try it now on the client. Just for hahas..
---
how do you download from Steam after you subscribe?
---
Any source on this? Seems like they'd make less money now compared to lich king.
---
Been using it for a while now. Haven’t noticed it slow down anything on my system. There is an option to pause the wallpaper whenever in full screen in an app so that helps

---
You can do any 5 man content as any spec.  You can ot/dps raids without mcp you'll just be less effective but that can not matter a huge deal depending on what you're tanking.
---
Not sure why you wouldn't do powershifting there's no cost like farming mcps it's just the most optimal way to play the spec.
---
Could you elaborate? I guess I should have worded better, but essentially what I was curious about is pros/cons for the healers in PVP.
---
Life is too short to be so angry at a streamer like him man. Just soneyhing to think about

For pvp servers, horde almost always outnumber alliance. It's really annoying (coming from a lifelong ally player).

This thread is bad but this comment was a straight personal attack.

Serious question. How is using Elvui tryharding?
---
I think Scintilla gave you a great example of how that [you haven't responded to.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctlbu5/world_of_warcraft_classic_server_demographics/exm74g9/)
---
But really, have you never been in a guild before? Never heard people talking about their significant others or their families or their personal lives? People tend to do that. You don't need to label yourself as gay for people to know you're gay when you say "brb husband calling me". There are people out there that'll give you grief over that, and I deal with that enough IRL, thanks.
---
So back then - and do let me know in comments if this will be true for 1.12 - different pets had different attack speeds, even within the same family. Broken Tooth was the fastest with a 1.0 base attack speed - great for pushback and it was supposed to be marginally better for DPS, too. (Attack speeds were later flattened, one of the early warning signs that the game was being dumbed down, god knows what for.)
---
I was 14 then. I remember standing on a damned hill in Badlands for 1, 2, 3 nights, spamming Eagle Eye to check spawn points with Spawn Beast. Quite often the tame would get sniped, more often a Hordie passing by would kill it in the hopes of rare loot. Sometimes I'd be killed by a higher level, mid-tame as I was completely vulnerable. Sometimes I'd be mid-battle and someone else would kill it. Many a heartbreak, many empty nights.
---
I even skipped school on Day 6 just to extend the wait as I had his last disappearance on a timer... was about to give up and head off to afternoon classes (because Asians)... and then it happened.
---
I have ABSOLUTELY no clue what I invited the rogue in for. Maybe for gank protection Whoever Suspect is, thank you for being there. Glad I have this screenshot, and glad that in no other game since was I ever forced to play Spot and Grab the Rare Pokemon quite like this. 
---
Glad to share it with you all as I look forward to ganking and being ganked again in Badlands, just for the memories.
---
It was bad. It was so bad that you could not quest on most weekends on a PvP server in Vanilla, even being able to complete 1 quest might have taken an hour or more. Constant non stop ganking, huge waves of people fighting between Nesingwary's camp and Grom'Gol. The roads where a no go as people on mounts would gank you. I remember one weekend the server was so bad that it was literally impossible to do anything. The second you resed and started to cast a spell you would see a massive wave of the opposite faction running right at you no matter what part of STV you tried to go to. I remember after a bad weekend like that I was questing by myself near some troll ruins north of Grom'Gol along the coast.  I heard a warrior charge and I jumped just from hearing the sound effect. Thankfully to my surprise it was a warrior on my faction just helping out.
---
Casual is the way to go.
---
I never played during classic, but ever since I heard about the AQ unlock event I thought it was a really cool idea. Getting the entire server to work together on a common goal like this seems like it would be great. I don't care about the Scarab Lord title (though it'd be cool to get it), but I really don't want the event to be done in a matter of hours. I've always wanted to experience this event, but if they don't change anything then I'll genuinely be really sad. I don't care how they do it, I just want to actually experience it.

Thats why you get that nat pagle. Beyond that I'm surprised by then people didnt have fury wars who had a ton of gear just by virtue of hanging around so long to get all sorts of gear.
---
But obviously my server could have been an anomoly. We had a huge pop, worst alliance\horde ratio as of when xserver bgs opened, and only really one good progression guild we should have had 2-4 for a day one PvE server.
---
What I did was I made a macro to switch between tracking each of them, and then you just press that every few seconds while running your route.
---
Some people are staring something new, other people are reliving memories. I say go for what strikes you as the most fun. If you wanna do a priest to play with your friend and be choosy about the dps you let join your groups (me, pick me!) then maybe end up with a hunter alt to relive it when you have some spare time. :D

Nice I raided in infused/inspire for the whole game. We originally had two raid teams but split off eventually iirc. Names I remember are gundork hus mimb gwila tinkzibar? thetodd wokafella itchyfingers latrov shooting vael on accident when he meant to open his bags. Stumpy I meet him down at Schoolies in an internet cafe needed to get our wow fix.
---
Did you play an Alliance rogue in vanilla...?
---
Hunter or Warlock? Which one will keep me interested while leveling
---
A hell of a lot of people still **do** care, which is why it matters.
---
When I was selling stuff in trade, there was always someone who tried to pressure me into accepting a way lower price. "good luck selling it for THAT price" "i'll give you half and i'm generous here" and so on.

Yeah mate, I'm from Singapore and played and raided with people from the States. Some are still RL friends.

Even now in 2019, living in the Internet Hub of Southeast Asia... I'll have to play on Australian realms. Ah well.
---
I've always preferred night elf Hunter, shadowmeld feels very good when you have a cat pet you can stealth with. Makes you the best flag protector in the game in WSG imo. 
---
If you want to minmax the answer for most classes is always dwarf. Stone form is very powerful.
---
Tie their persistence to the profanity filter then ? So we can have it on or off and choose what we accept to read or not ?

If you were a part of the private server community, you would definitely not have posted this. STV on a PvP server was a shit show. You would be yanked by players all of the time. If you could hold you’re own, you either became target #1 or no one messed with you. You’ll see
---
Oh shit, you are absolutely right.
---
how did you make 15-20k off classic?
---
Just ignore them, they will be back to playing retail in a month
---
Nah
---
Oh look another play the game the way I say thread.   It's not playing the game to you because you're an uber casual so to you all that exists in the game is stupid shit like leveling when to non casuals that's tedious shit before you actually start playing the game.

There will be skeletons, they will just disappear after the owner dies again is what I understood from the ama?

I'm with you homie.  I browse this subreddit for posts like this, and I played vanilla a shit ton.  But I spent about 5 minutes reading all the guides and other stuff posted here and I was like, nah.  Imma do it my way.  I'm sure I'll google some stuff, and when I get to the end game I'll do the appropriate min/maxing.  I just want to play though, have some fun, and make new friends.
---
I don't disagree with the notion that he shouldn't be writing guides for content he didn't do when it was current, but we both know how unrealistic your comparison is.
---
You're comparing a class guide, something vital to understanding and playing the game at anything from low-endgame to top-endgame with a level 17 dungeon where the big issue was he got lost when playing it? Not knowing the directions while playing the dungeon has absolutely zero relevance to what knowledge he may or may not have about the dungeon itself. Such as bosses, quests and optimal level range.
---
AFAIK this addon was in vanilla. Don't remember the name of it. It did the same thing as this one, only thing was - no one used it.

Blahmew sounds like

&gt;you're failing to grasp some of the most fundamental aspects that make Vanilla good.
---
You'll be hard pressed to find anyone who says that endless LFM spamming in a global channel as a fundamentally good aspect of Vanilla. An unavoidable aspect of Vanilla? Yes, but what made Vanilla good? Let's be honest, no one liked spamming chat for group forming, we had no systematic alternative at the time.
---
If this addon had been implemented, exactly as it's currently described, as a in-game tool during Vanilla, only instead called a Group Bulletin Board, there's no doubt in my mind people would have taken to it with aplomb.

---
If you can't see the spam, how are you going to do your civic duty and report them?
---
Eh maybe but I doubt they will go to the full realms.
---
Think about it, if someone from retail or a non-WoW player, who has never played vanilla, just wants to check it out,  they will roll on the realms without a queue time because they are just trying it out and dont plan on staying. They wont want to be bothered with queues just to check something out they might not stick with. This is the big problem with how Blizz has released the realms we currently have. All those realms that will be needed (and will be opened) when Classic goes live are going to get a lot of players who are "tourists" and probably wont stay after level 20. It just wont be their thing. Some of the people who roll on these newly opened realms *will* stay but after 3-4 months will see a huge drop-off of the tourists and those realms will be dead. The current opened "full" realms will also see drop-off but not to the extent of any realms opened when we go live. Had Blizz opened all the current realms plus 2-3 more PvE and 2 more PvP realms last week initially, there would have been a greater choice of realms for everyone during preroll and the hardcore players would be more spread out right now. If they did that, all of the existing realms might have currently been "high" population before we went live. Even after a drop off of current players already on the realms and the tourists coming in during the live release plus any new players who will stay, the realm pops should be at least medium population. Medium population is still a huge number of players per realm compared to what we had during vanilla release.
---
Blizz not wanting to open realms (because they never thought Classic would have a large draw) has screwed the realms being opened when we go live. Maybe thats what they want though. I wouldnt put it past some of the people who really never wanted to do Classic to want to see realms fail so they can do the "We told you so" bullshit they always seem to spew.

What I found amazing is that there is a real "Nat Pagle"!!  I thought it was just a made up name.
---
Nat - if you're reading this your in game avatar is my spirit npc - fishing ftw!!!
---
God I finally understood this, thx all!
---
Oh I know that ahah we can agree that it isn’t the name for a server as its prononciation is really not obvious for that audience. :)
---
While it makes sense that everyone should be in combat when a boss was engaged OOC rezzers was one of the funnier ways to game the system back in the day
---
Fear ward is the best priest spell for alliance, hands down, there is no contest. If you are going for a minmax you pick dwarf. 
---
Can you stay attached to a dwarf to get to end game with him though? If you like how a human priest looks then do it, it's not that far off. 
---
But if you're asking in terms of power, stone form + fear ward makes them far superior.
---

Hell, there were times where I would just camp my ass down in certain zones and hang out because I liked the setting or music.

And just the way I like them, room temperature.

Hot damn, the quest. Can't wait to do it again.

People go to jail for hours to years for crimes, gold sellers take seventeen extra seconds to create a new account and login to do it again. Your comparison is profoundly stupid.
---
Damn
---
As a Druid you perform interesting roles. The flag running spec works great whether your in wsg or healing in other bgs. You turn flags in AB extremely well and no one can catch you.  
---
Pallys and Priests are more your typical dispell and heal and protect and dont get caught out of position.  
---
Shamans play more offensively, purging buffs keeping windfury up for your melee, and you can play Ele/resto hybrid deleting enemies and supporting allies at the same time.
---
Sweet, thanks. Except I never even mentioned ads.
---
dang would have never thought of that, last time i checked people complained about skeletons and i thought they will boycott launch so i can grind in peace...

If you play druid, what spec would you be? Hunter's easy, fast to level, brainless for questing but deeper in PvE and PvP... Could be fun! But so could druid, just a different kinda fun.

Levelled 60s on both factions. I'd really say you're missing out on storylines, character models and geography/zones... same could be said for someone who's also only played Alliance, though. But, imho, that's about it.

That is kind of what I am thinking. I've got 15 years as a hunter and 0 as a Priest. I can easily solo a hunter when he can't play.

Since this was announced, i've looked at a ton of other horde guides. His is still the best layout imo. The maps make a huge difference.

Just remember to do the last part (waking up Naralex).

My level 48 priest on Ndale is currently logged out here forever

As a hunter alt I feel the pain, when I run dungeons in current game and tab target from pull to pull my character just auto attacks. It's a habit I have from playing melee classes so much but boy it's really difficult for me to explain why I'm pulling extra mobs and be taken seriously.  . .

Interesting thought, that. to an immortal race, perhaps tradition and aesthetics take precedence over convenience and utility.

I guess the person with their hand drawed upon has never heard of “siphoning”.

It was a joke largely but mainly everything does fall under paying attention to the game. I was a raid leader and Hunter officer and my main advice to most people was literally.
---
Don't stand in the things that kill you, move and pay attention.
---
It's not like any of the game mechanics where difficult in MC, most in BWL just took prep work for resis gear and raid balance. Nax and AQ 40 where the ones that had pretty difficult fights imo.

Sorry I misspoke. Everything above level 40 was removed.

Are people sanding their old mice for internet points, or am I supposed to believe that's actual wear?

\**Dons tinfoil hat*\*
---
I mean...they have to do *something* to try to prove how correct they were that "we only think we want this".  So clearly this is an attempt to cause player numbers to absolutely fall through the floor after the launch week hype in order to "prove" that point.
---
\**Removes hat*\*
---
So yeah, sometimes I do get suspicious that they don't *want* this to be successful, but rather just want to use it as a means by which to lure older players back into retail WoW.  I very much hope I'm wrong and don't think they'd sink so much time into putting 1.12 stuff into the modern client if this were the case, but on the other hand they almost didn't have a choice because they want battle.net to be in your face when you start WoW, and they want to be able to use the current auth servers, etc.  There's so much tinfoil hatting to be done here and it's hard to resist.  Maybe I wouldn't mistrust them so much if I had a phone...

Sokath, his eyes open!
---
I'd definitely be leveling as Feral just for simplicity's sake, but I'd move to healing/support at later levels. Ideally I'd have a set for both just so I can have some fun in BGs as well as fill any needed role for dungeons.
---
Gotcha. Here is it is if you're interested, pass it on!

Already did - i am hoping for the best.

Fortunately this time around we have DPS meters that are actually accurate and you can easily tell who isn't pulling their weight at a glance.

That's worse because it makes it even more likely that people vote multiple times.

The "Classic" graphics option is meant to simulate  the high-end graphics from 2006 Vanilla WoW, as far as I can tell.

&gt;What the fuck does an orc shaman have to do with being gay? It’s not a dating site, it’s a fantasy game. Only way that your identity can become a problem is if YOU make it one.
---
Sorry, I don't want to feel like I have to avoid saying "brb my gf is calling me" in voice or with people who know I'm a woman. 
---
What's embarrassing is how riled up this comments section is over this lmao.
---
Maybe it is and always was a time portal created by Chromie for Classic.
---
Get your level 20 mount first 😂
---
Someone report this to blizzard, they have already stated earlier that they will be taking down any Add ons that arent in the spirit of Classic.
---
Why doesn’t anyone pay for music/dvds/streams?
---
Dumbass
---
The most obvious factor. How silly of me to forget.
---
Yes this.
---
&gt; You just ignored what I said about it not being about sexuality.  Being harassed constantly and surrounded by homophobic behavior DOES impact game play. Greatly.
---
How do you get harassed if you simply play the game how it’s meant to be played? No one is going to troll you until you open up your personal life to a toxic troll.
---
&gt; And gee... If only we had LGBT servers that have existed since the vanilla release to look at and see that everything you just said is wrong.  Oh wait, we do. 🤔
---
Now who’s getting “snarky”?
---
A simple google search for Proudmore anti gay harassment will prove that I’m actually not wrong.
---
Nothing feels as lonely as running through darnassus at 4am.
---
40 man raids, mostly 2 tanks. Just math mostly. Of course there are plenty of fights that use more than 2 tanks, including the generally 8 required for 4 horsemen but yeah it's somewhat difficult to get a MT role.

Maybe the RNG gods will shine on me in game. :)

Yes this is my only Reddit account, this is my first one. I made it 23 days ago.

They're definitely there. Like I said, all the dude has done for the past year is sit in his room and work on his leveling guides in preparation for classic. Maybe even longer than that.
---
Natural climate change isnt driven by humans dude. There is climate change that's been taking place on this planet since its creation. IT IS A NATURAL CHANGE IN CLIMATE NOT DERIVED FROM OUTSIDE FORCES. 
---
Hes correct in the assertion that you cannot accept all the studies and statistics... they are driven by ideology and they are used for an agenda. 
---
As I told the other commentor, jordan Peterson is much more intelligent than any of us in this thread. If hes saying something, it's for a reason and you might want to do a little more research into the topic.
---
Right, but this version is out of date, lol. What are you trying to prove, anyway?

Same. Same.

What is a “mandun geon”?

P.S.

Alors, petite question -- qqn a dit que les Québécois prononcent leurs "-eux" comme "-er". C'est vrai? J'ai toujours compris les adjectifs dites dans ma guilde québécoise, genre niaiseux etc, et je l'ai jamais entendu. Pourrais-tu m'aider ici ?

Oh man. I remember this. And people being like “I’ve got Tier 1.”

Sorry, nerds.  I'm too old and busy with real life to grind 1000g for an epic mount.  I'll be dropping $70-$100 on Ping pong Ching Chong's gold service before the year is up.

Don't be so hard on yourself! This is amazingg!!!!! :)😀😁😅😄😃🤣
---
It's something that I've legitimately worried about for a while, I even posted on the forum about it a few weeks ago. It's just not a topic that comes up much because AQ is so far away (phase 4 or whatever), so people haven't really mentioned it.
---
It'll only be gated by the length of the quest chain if they make no changes, nothing else. These servers hold WAY more people than vanilla servers did, and it's probably save to say that more people will be playing than played on even the largest private server, so if people stockpile the mats in advance then it'll basically be done immediately. I have no idea how long the quest chain takes, but completed in a day or less seems pretty feasible to me.
---
Do you know what bis means?
---
Paladin - Great pvp healer wears plate, has blessings, strong long CDs, good support with auras + stuns and blessings. CAN do damage but not main focus.
---
Druid - Strong pvp healer but less support, wears leather medium squishy but can go bear.
---
Priest - Very strong pvp healer, good support with fears and buffs. One of the strongest single target heals. Wears cloth so very squishy. 
---
Shaman. Arguably the best PVP healer. Wears mail good survivability. Very strong single and aoe heals, very strong support with buffs and class counters. Cow shamans can even stun.
---
Yeah I do know the lore, and I think Darnassus does a good job of kind of showing the Night Elves as more aloof, and otherworldly. They are not ambitious and striving for power and influence like humans or hungry for knowledge or riches like the gnomes or dwarves. 
---
I played as a Night Elf Druid and a Human Warrior, even though I loved playing my Druid, I always gravitated towards the non-Night elf areas and only traveled to Moonglade to learn skills. I of course had to travel to Darnassus for some class quests, and I never liked it much, even though I do like the look of the city. I hightailed it all the way to Westfall as soon as I reached level 10.
---
I was 9 years old playing vanilla. The farthest I got were a hunter at level 15 and a lock at 33~34 (when I finally pulled my head out of my ass and tried leveling.)
---
Nah, head went back in my ass and tried leveling a rogue in TBC. got it to 55 at wrath launch, rolled a DK and never looked back.
---
But from what I remember, warlock was not a truly awful experience. It was just underplayed according to what people say about back then today.
---
Please read that Bloomberg article.
---
Stonemaul wasnt too bad, but it was always interesting.
---
But legion was fun? Did you really buy into the legion was bad?
---
Get to 60 by the end of week 2 and you can pick your guild. Get to 60 by the end of week 20 and you need to think about staring as dps in a guild with few tanks and moving up from there. (Yeah I said up, all due respect to the rotation monkeys ;) )
---
But then it will change again in Phase 2 and again later on so play what you want but be prepared to have to work tpwards your desired role if it takes you a while to get to 60. If you do I'd be surprised if you can't find a spot in a decent guild, but nothing in this world is guaranteed, as they say.
---
Oh true enough, good catch ill update it.
---
RUN you say? More like walk....very slowly....behind an NPC...for 20+ minutes
---
Everyone responding to your post like you personally are upset.  You made a great point.  I subscribed to Joana's twitch BECAUSE he was helping the community for free.  Today, when I heard he stopped, I unsubscribed.
---
I played shaman in vanilla. It was great. I did pvp as enhance and healed in raids.
---
This time I'm debating between lock and hunter, with a small part of me saying fuck it play something weird this time around. My wife is going to play warrior, and a friend is playing priest, so I'm pretty much free to do whatever.
---
We're all going to play fairly casually (we have around 20 people total), and don't expect to be pushing bleeding edge for raiding, but still raiding nonetheless down the road.
---
Warlock is the logical choice, decent damage, can have a fun rotation with ruin, and is high utility with great scaling into later content.
---
Hunter is faster leveling, but somewhat doesn't scale as hard.
---
Why should I go hunter or Warlock?
---
Nice got Tiltlord on Shazz guess that name is fitting now.
---
Damn it’s that big of a deal huh? Guess it’s worthy reconsidering then. Thanks much appreciated
---
&gt; slight offset for position and rotation skeletons.
---
That would be the easiest fix!
---
Could you do the same and just copy all your addons from your interface folder instead of redownloading them all?
---
Are dorritos and monster energy drinks vegan? I know hotpockets aren't.

&gt;This is Google's cache of https://www.joanasworld.com/original-joana-v110.html. It is a snapshot of the page as it appeared on Aug 19
---
From 2 days ago, not what I would call outdated bud 😂
---
Not trying to prove anything, just being kind in case you were interested in the guide. Personally I'm not, I'm just being friendly.
---
Someone should make an addon that does nothing but play this song whenever you walk into STV
---
&gt;No. I think the server is capable of generating 3 skeletons per player as opposed to 1 skeleton per player, and even far more at that.
---
Blizzard agrees with you.
---
&gt;A skeleton is a single coordinate point which doesn't interact with anything else. It's not exactly stretching the server to put skeletons down.
---
Unless specifically designed so engines typically have an upper limit on what they can render. Kerbal space program uses time dilation when it hit's it's limit, which it very often does, as an example. For the developers of kerbal the only way around it would be editing the source code.
---
I mean look at how the vanilla engine handled the higher player counts + all the mobs and whatever. It would severely limit the rendering distance server wide to make sure everything ran smoothly... 
---
The engine has to track and render everything in the zone + all the players which could be a massive number in a single zone. With players having infinite skeletons and long duration's you would want them to stick around this could totally cause engine issues. 
---
I can guarantee that pservers were limiting the amount of skeletons in any given zone, given their constant crashing, server lag etc. etc.
---
&gt;In fact, even in 2004 when players could produce infinite skeletons, it was never a server side issue in terms of resources. If there was ever any lag because of it, it was because of the client side (people's computers were far worse and bogged down by the polys).
---
This wasn't and would have never been an issue in vanilla. Typically servers had a fraction of the load they're going to deal with now so it's a bit of a moot point.
---
Everything I said was inline with the context of this comment chain. I don't see how you can find an issue here.
---
doesnt bother me that hes doing it, i respect it. I feel like a better approach would have been to embed his twitch stream into the site and maybe add reminders to donate to his paypal or patreon. Keep it free, most will tip via paypal or start tuning into his twitch.
---
Pretty sure blood elves were part of the games original promotion material but idk
---
If you're on a PvP server I'd consider rogue.   
---
If you're into PvE, or Raiding EVEN A LITTLE BIT mage is the way to go. You'll have a more boring rotation endgame, but at least you'll be useful.
---
Mega-upvote on this from me, fantastic work. Thanks so much!
---
They were able to cut down on gold selling quite a bit before they introduced tokens.
---
pretty much, lol
---
r/woosh
---
Nope! There are different mechanics to learn for each but neither is more painful in those scenarios. I will be warrior tanking and will take either any time! 
---
All raids will usually have 8+ mages and 8+ rogues/warriors. 
---
All preference there.
---
If only joana would sell his guide straight up id buy it.
---
Are you really going to become a toxic redditor over these people voicing their concern over a feature they want?
---
Imo gold selling is a non issue compared to the toxic "gamer" environment. The amount of people who sling the n word or say f*g, especially in voice chat, is insane. Or even have the weird thirsty or sexist attitude towards women.
---
My sister is part of the lgbt community so it hits home a lot more than say, some guy who has more money than time and maybe upsets the marketplace a microscopic amount by buying gold.
---
You are saying you think the world first Rag kill will be before the game is one week old?  Really?
---
Are you retarded?
---
They're not people if they're the enemy.  Demonizing the enemy is propaganda 101.
---
Yea, I played them both on alts in vanilla days but don't remember enough to know which is better.
---
With hunter you get a few different shots, Warlock is either sb spam or corruption and ruin procs for more sb.
---
I'm just indecisive because of the ratings you mentioned. They're pretty equal just with different power curves.
---
In vanilla I got up to Naxx with downing patchwerk, but that was the end of my vanilla raiding.
---
This time around I see our group easily clearing Mc (since most of us are vanilla players), and starting to stall with aq40/naxx.
---
I think I'll just go demons over doggies.
---
When is DK infographic pls ty
---
Doritos, no. Energy drinks, yeah. Surprisingly, Oreos are vegan too
---
Early estimates from reddit on PvP servers makes it look like 45/55 A/H on average. Not great, but not too bad.
---
Why even be subbed for a month then? If you're speed levelling you dont even need the guide for a week. It's just a poor attempt at a cast grab plain and simple.
---
The guy was a good leveller back in the day but now ( Compared to the Private server crews ) he is terrible plain and simple and most of the guides from the private server scene are better. The main reason people are pissed from what i have read in the threads is the timing of putting it behind a paywall,  And not only a pay wall but a subscription as you said " Don't you have memory ? " People should be able to use his guide once and then when they level another character follow a rough guess from memory of where to go, Making the subscription thing just greedy due to it being targeted at one type of person. The slow leveller that doesn't have much time on their hands to play and want to maximise their game time.
---
He could of done this a month ago when the real levelling stopped ( Before all the test servers went to 15 max / Pre made toons ) and slowly made tweeks to it as it got closer and closer not wait till 4 days till launch as like i said it is the timing that seems to be pissing people off.
---
And before you jump the gun. No i was never going to buy a guide, i know my route like the back of my hand,  I still think it is a dick move to all the people who we're going to use his guide as you know, It was reddit and his fans that got him Beta by asking for it here and on the official forums as he didn't have it at first and those fans made him plenty of money on Pateron and Twitch.
---
Thanks! This one was a bit easier than druid thats for sure, since I happened to know a buddy who played them rather extensively back in the day, so I had a consultant :P
---
So I'm pretty ignorant about warlocks in vanilla, I never played one until Wrath. I had no idea Destruction was that good. I'm intrigued now 😁
---
tough to suck.
---
OR? You can just the Joana guide that's been on your hard drive for the past decade, ya jabronis.
---
You are a scholar, a gentleman, and a nerd. Thank you so much!
---
I wonder if Blizzard plans to release the honor system pre or post 1.5? DHKs sucked.
---
I can't find the talent calculator on this site to save my life, am I an idiot?
---
That's competitive. So you'll likely (educated guess only) be in a spot where medium-good (in terms of game ability) guilds will be looking to fill various spots left by players who dropped or didn't level up quickly enough etc. and some of those slots will be tank slots. A few of them and they'll be contested. So, in the order I would choose:
---
Q1) Can you make every Raid night, no exceptions, until farm?
---
Q2) What experience do you have at Tanking the content? (I can teach Tanking np, no-one can teach attendance)
---
Q3) Do you have any Raid-lead experience? If not, would it interest you to learn?
---
Q4) How many BiS items do you have, are you not an Orc and other tie-breaker type questions.
---
So in your timeframe I expect it would largely come down to how you can answer those kinds of questions. Just my 2c though and it's a subject on which there are a range of opinion to be sure.
---
The worst part is that I can tell how detailed your memory is despite how terrible your art is.
---
Maybe if you weren’t a dog you’d have more coins
---
you seem pretty well prepared if you ask me :P
---
If you think LGBT people are only surrounded by homophobia or harassed if they being up that they're LGBT, then you're living in some sort of alternate reality.
---
Log into just about any populated server and there is homo and transphobia all day long in public chat completely unprovoked.
---
I Google searched what you said and it brought back nothing for me.  Not even one relevant article.  I've also play my Alliance characters on Proudmoore for 8 years now, currently in one of the top raiding guilds, so I think I'm pretty familiar with the server and the dynamics there.
---
You tried to say you're not angry at other groups because they weren't stickied, but that's the only time you mention it and everything else has been nonstop attacking of LGBT sexuality (which isn't a thing). You're all over the place here trying so hard to justify your behavior, but you can't rationalize the irrational. 
---
It's not a big deal, you're just trying to make it one.  You're not mad only because it's stickied, and that's obvious. If anything just don't play on that server and move on. Who cares, it doesn't affect you at all.
---
Dont you know there is no such thing here? its all black and white.
---
Still doesn't answer my question about twinks but thank you.

I was hoping someone posted this

You think you only have 45 minutes to play a day until you start sacrificing sleep and life responsibilities.  Then you have all the time in the world!

Night Elves do it in every other city so there has to be something to it.
---
Dude lol just quit, you're embarrassing yourself now. I hate Asmongold too but there are plenty of more relevant (and less projected) insults
---
I don't think as many people will *get to Naxx* that think they will.
---
Average playtime is 20-30h a week. Likely higher when new shit launches, too. The average player will take 2-3 months to 60, at the very most. If it takes you 4 months to get to 60, you're below average by a significant margin.
---
people dont realize that all this does is prevent you from walking into westfall and seeing 15 different people trying to form their deadmines group. a feature like this addon prevents people from having to look at and use general
---
Imagine spending hours and hours farming gold when you can buy enough gold for an epic mount for like 60 bucks lol
---
All these people talking about ret pally being trash. Sure, my dps will be less than others, but we can settle it where it actually matters... Pvp.
---

Do every quest that gives NE rep at the level. start at lvl 4 in their starting area. at 40 you'll be half way through revered at about lvl 43.

I’d give someone 10g to find out how they got a . In their name too
---
Yea every single warlock spec went into destruction for the Ruin talent, which masisvely boosted their damage. 
---
Ultimately warlock was one of those classes that did more hybrid builds than anything else, so they dont quiet fit super well into a simple guide such as this, but hopefully it will give a rough ballpark idea of what they can do! 
---
(I highly recommend people look at far far more advanced guides than these when they actually decide on a class!!)
---
If you're going to get upwards of aq40/naxx after BWL Warlock will really pop off.  I'm totally on the demons side, best of luck!
---
Well then why are people freaking out about it?

so why is the final content easier to get then thunderfury and rag
---
The people who provide these services are mostly from poor countries with very low wages. Overwhelming majority of them aren't scammers, they do this as their day job basically, cause most of them simply have no other option. And it's not even them who's spamming the chats, it's the shop owners who profit off of them.  
---
This thread just amazes me in a bad way, gold buying and powerleveling won't hurt your personal game experience, but all these comments are acting like those people are committing a crime or something. All I can think of is getting ganked by a guy who bought all the good gear from AH, but I ain't even sure about that one. I understand the spam argument though, but you can just install a chat filter addon and move on.   
---
Why would people care about that in a Classic WoW sub is beyond me, I thought the game was about enjoying the leveling process, finding friends and all that stuff. Why would you care about some other people experience than your own?
---
And some people don't have time to do it all, but still want to enjoy the game so they buy those services, why would you judge them?
---
Definitely, I logged in to retail for the first time in over 10 years, went to Orgrimar, I felt like I had just stepped into Dormamu's Dark Dimension and I had no idea what the fuck was even happening there.
---
Its not good value *to you*.  I'm *probably* not going to pay for it because its a monthly sub and not a one time deal, and do I really need a guide for a game I've leveled dozens of characters on?  I'm curious as to what he's changed from [whats freely available](https://web.archive.org/web/20190511042159/https://www.joanasworld.com/horde-12-20-barrens-stonetalon.html), but am I curious enough to spend 5 dollars on something I don't need?
---
There are definitely major flaws in the current game's design, but there are still quite a lot of things that have gotten better. Just as Vanilla had its flaws and a lot of positive aspects.
---
You can say what you want about the current gameplay but at least each spec feels distinguishable and relatively unique gameplay wise. You have proper rotations and aren't just spamming a single button 90% of the time, as was in the case for casters until the end of TBC even. Melee rotations usually keep you GCD locked and the combat itself is engaging in content that matters, so not leveling.
---
Meanwhile the current game focuses too much on the endgame. I personally only joined WoW because I love the raids. The World first LK 25 hc kill was what got me to buy the game and I've only ever really done things at max level and I only ever saw leveling as what it had been for years: the barrier between expansions. But I also think they can't ever really change the approach to leveling and how anything meaningful is at max level. For that they'd need to completely remake the game I think.
---
Gear progression is definitely nicer in Classic. I've been against titanforging and random sockets ever since that abomination got introduced. But I also liked the regular +6 ilvl warforging, which had a higher chance to occur the more difficult the content was you did. I think FFXIV has the ideal compromise. You can get almost raid quality gear from farming either points (tomestones there) with a weekly cap, meaning it takes ages for a complete set; or farm mats or gold in order to craft or buy the equivalent gear. And even then you will never have the best possible gear unless you raid the hardest content, just as it should be.
---
Certain QoL improvements are nothing to scoff at. The random dungeon finder is shit and has been useless since WoD. The Raid finder has been useless since WoD. Both offer gear that is currently worse than the one you can get from dailies. Meanwhile, the group finder tool is the menu equivalent of /2 and /LFG feom Classic. You even have to manually go to the raids and dungeons. The only difference is that the chat isn't spammed anymore in order to find groups.
---
For me at least, neither of the two - shouting in chat channels or using the Group Finder tool - is immersive. The first one is unrealistic in terms of an RPG while the latter one works as if you are using a smartphone in an RPG.
---
I could go on but I am rally tired right now..
---
Cool! I loved it in wrath. Destruction was like a "shadow mage" to me. I'll have to try one in Classic! 😍

He actually added the Alliance part with the paywall so he did add extra value.

I've always wanted to play wow just never had the money

I'm dying I cant pick between druid and warrior
---
Friend is going druid and we were going to duo it a bit.. I mained rogue/priest through vanilla/wotlk but more recently in legion/bfa was a druid so I've healed a lot. 
---
Sometimes the 100% attention nature of tanking can be frustrating for me but at least it's something different. I hate how long DPS chars take to get into groups.. though I guess there's no groupfinder anymore. 
---
But warrior/druid can quickly make groups and still be decent in pvp. 
---
With kids and a job I doubt I have time to even raid this time around, so I might be more pvp oriented. 
---
I keep coming back to druid because of stealth and wsg flagrunning.
---
Wooooooot!
---
&gt; No. I think having something available for free is better than not having it available for free.
---
someone did SW, i've seen it on reddit already :)
---
Very good info. I’ve never been a great tank. Nor did I do it in vanilla. I’m a bit worried I’d be awful. However, I’ve always enjoyed the idea of tanking. I have however, been a fairly decent healer.

Anyone can play Classic without buying gold, the "I don't have time to farm" is a crap excuse, if you don't have time to farm, you don't have time to play Classic at all, because it's more challenging and grindy than any other modern game available today.

What do you all think the least played classes will be on horde-side? I'd like to play something that fills a gap on the server. I'm leaning shaman or priest. Which of those would pair best as a leveling duo with a mage? Shaman has no gear competition, but priest has better synergistic buffs?
---
Let's talk about Thex, baby

30 mins.
---
That gives you 15 mins before the fun police notice it and hit report and another 15 for some poor Blizzard scrub to see the report and wonder to themselves *'What the fuck are people already complaining about?'*
---
I would always target that dragon on the cliff and wonder what the story behind that guy was!
---
Gotta admit, seeing a lot of these comments makes me think most of you dont remember how frequently those skeletons was abused by goldsellers in the capital cities. They were flooded with adverts all day every day on ground. It was fucking stupid and a very understandable change. Its about game integrety
---
Chill, we will manage without.
---
I'm not great at playing melee, but for most bosses, just stand behind and go to town I think.
---
Typically Pve is alliance. Pvp is horde
---
Hes defending one entity for trying to make money and attacking another for trying to make money.
---
Meanwhile I’m here like yeah I did deadlines a couple of times for that rogue piece
---
I think it's a good plan!
---
And everyone is gonna kill KT too!
---
entitled gamers: REEEEEEE
---
 I'm not about to trust some random site with my payment information for a recurring subscription.
---
Alliance had better pvp premades because holy Paladins are gods in pvp. 
---
Their buffs also are a huge advantage for raids, making that much easier as well. They also can heal for ages, trivializing certain fights. Shamans are poor healers in comparison, at least until naxx gear.
---
This was in wrath so it doesn't count but Challenger Explosion always made me giggle.
---
Hahaha fair enough - I usually open a window and keep the blinds drawn and cracked to allow air flow - but I luckily don’t have direct sun on my window
---
I agree this would be a much better solution
---
One last thing.
---
Peppermints improve your focus. They'll also wake you up if you put 3-4 in your mouth at once.
---
I spent many many late dark hours in mauradon. Sigh.
---
I see what youre saying, but I dont think hes attacking blizzard here for trying to make money - rather he's pointing out a coincidental fact which looks a bit suspect. 
---
I dont think he states that blizzard shouldnt make money from wow subscriptions.

Talk to me about priests. I’m fine healing PVE but I want to run shadow eventually for PVP. How bad is leveling in general and how many priests can I reasonably expect to be competing with end game wise. I assume a good healer is always in demand, but if everyone and their brother is a priest, that’s going to be annoying as all hell.
---
You might have less people overall playing in your region, but you also have fewer servers so they could be just as crowded
---
According to the wayback machine 1000g was $60- $80 in September 2005, depending on server

As a warlock I only harvest the HIGHEST of quality souls for my shards. I can't leave all that cloth lying around, now can I?
---
Eww you fascists are all the same. Parroting everything you hear without actually reading anything. Please broaden your knowledge beyond YouTube videos and Wikipedia articles.
---
Every warrior is going to be tanking 5 mans unless they flat out refuse.
---
Didn't know about this site thanks!
---
Extra cool points if you have the Matrix skin on it.
---
because nobody on reddit actually reads the links
---
are you new here?

cursed bot

---
What a sin.
---
I will say that you can definitely add Destruction for PvP in general, since once you hit late BWL, early ZG/AQ gear the Nightfall/Conflag build became a massive powerhouse.

Pretty sure darkshore is the best leveling zone in terms of quest amount from 10-15 as well? Especially with all the beached sea creature pick-up quests. It's the only alliance 10-20 zone you can complete to relatively high completion without hitting a snag mid-through where the enemies are suddenly 5 levels above you.
---
I read this every time it gets posted and it makes me laugh every time
---
I would assume that they can contact him, and he will give them access.....
---
Just my 2 cents! See you in Azeroth :)
---
suure let's beat this dead horse some more because why not.
---
Not too long compared to some of my other projects!
---
I think it ended up being a month or two. I did make it a while ago for my brother while we were playing on private servers.
---
Offt, that one hurts
---
Going to be the most exciting queue of my life.
---
I mean that's kind of the whole underlying foundation of the story. At first there was just an endless ocean of light, but at some point there were some pools of void that appeared. This disturbance kicked off all of existence of the World of Warcraft. All the good stuff came from light and all the bad stuff came from the void. It just so happens that the primary story is so far removed from the initial kick off that we will (hopefully) never see/hear about the void lords that created the Old Gods.
---
Did you forget about skinning?
---
That works as well
---
Makes me wonder what people are doing with their mice. I still have my 3.0 and 1.1 intellimouse from god knows when.

Goddamn that's fantastic, I love it!

LMAO, truuuu

I was introduced to nightwish because of WoW montage videos.
---
"Going home" Gives me goosebumps.  
---
Going gnome gives me shudders.
---
I just hope all of the new to the scene players don’t bring M+ expectations with them from retail. It would be sad to see communities collapse because people don’t understand that time is a factor in this version.
---
Joking apart, that's a strategy with diminishing returns as you start to make dumb mistakes. Not to mention the same for tiredness. I realise for first 60 folks have to push, but I reckon the lowest /played time will actually be by someone who eats and sleeps normally and optimises for maximum efficiency.
---
I had a like 600 Karma account and never used Reddit much but since the beginning of this year I've gotten to 12,000 from just this sub alone.
---
Im so damn excited for anything in this game. I haven't played anything when its still fresh typically i join late. Also never got to experience classic wow. I get back from a course the 29th and got a 4 day weekend to play
---
Geordi and Bochra, S03E07, The Enemy
---
You get the teleport: moonglade from your druid trainer when you accept the quest to go to moonglade iirc. It's not a trained spell that you purchase, this is assuming entirely on if the SW druid trainer can give the quest that learns it or if he simply tells you to "return to Darnassus and talk to the guy there".
---
Cool site - thanks for sharing.
---
Yes smartass it means BEST in slot which I'm sure is your point. Do we need to come up with a term for a list of reasonable to obtain items?
---
not during the first weeks of classic. Nobody will have money except the people at level 60.
---
You can kinda get mount around level 45-50. But on fresh server it's almost impossible to get it by level 40
---
Fellow FAIRBANKS Horde players, according to this data most of you intend to be semi-hardcore!  
---
I'm running a guild with a few other people and we are looking for more, our motto is 50% serious, 50% fun, with the first phase leaning more towards fun!  
---
We'll be doing 40 man raids, PvP and guild events (like duel tournaments, etc) so if this sounds interesting to you send me a message! Looking for all classes :)  
---
(Fairbanks / Horde)
---
It's pronounced blow moe
---
I don’t mind tanking in dungeons just worried about warrior’s high maintenance cost, need to respec for pvp etc. I’m mainly interested in PvP. Same with ele, I don’t mind healing in raid as long as I can get the gear but not sure how hard it is.
---
Basically looking for good pvp class, decent gold farming for respecs/consumables or spec that works for both pvp/pve, and that works well with lock and priest.
---
How well can a warrior grind gold with priest/lock friends?
---
They did you can autorun across it now.
---
It was the first time you really interacted much with neutral factions, right? Picking a centaur tribe to side with was interesting.
---
Whine less snowflake.
---
&gt; since raiding is not in the cards for me.
---
ZG is very puggable. Maybe not to the end, but the easiest 2-4 bosses are well within the reach of decent players wearing dungeon blues.
---
Wasn't there a pet in Feralas aswell like a drop from those fairy drakes there or was that later added?
---
*just a little.*
---
These infographics look nice but the actual info is irrelevant or just bad opinions/stereotypes.
---
This one is hideous
---
The John Deer lawnmower lol
---
Oh nice, didnt know that! Def gonna try it out😄
---
I have a feeling we'll see a lot more warlocks in classic than we had in Vanilla. Locks were so weak for so long that by the time they got buffed to a respectable level, people didn't bother leveling one up. They weren't exactly rare before but I wouldn't be shocked if they're just as popular as mages this time around.
---
I too had a symbiotic relationship with a mushroom.
---
Wait what? Fruit of the Loom *doesnt* have a cornucopia now?
---
Thanks for bringing this up.
---
This is shit and should not be tolerated. What are people thinking???
---
While leveling in The Barrens years ago I was part of a surprisingly involved discussion in General as to why 'The Barrens' is singular, not plural, and the proper ways to use it in a sentence. People were actually asking grammar questions and seemed interested about it. Then, over time, it devolved back into standard Barrens chat, but that was a nice interlude.
---
Yeah, this is my opinion as well.
---
Can't be angry at a content creator for trying to make a living but a paywall never works, especially in this environment where most users are familiar with ways of getting content for free.
---
I'm glad I asked, guess I'm rolling dwarf. Thanks for the input
---
And I'm telling you it 100% is.
---
Until you try it, you wouldn't know.
---
Warlock is always good if you plan to stick around to get the gear to go full God like. 
---
You will be a healer as a druid at end game, you could find a guild who might let you go as feral but it's far from optimal and your roles in PvP are very niche. Amazing flag carrier though. 
---
Tanking in classic is much more captivating and involved than retail, threat is so real and you need patience for your groups. 
---
Rogues are great at all stages of the game. Good CC utility through dungeons, great damage for raids, best of both worlds for PvP. 
---
Vastly different play styles and goals for all four, is a tough one.
---
Personally looking forward more to BRD. I have always loved that place to death. The length, the depth and the way everything is interconnected. What they’ve done to it on classic is a crime against humanity.
---
Another bonus of playing priest is that you'll likely have a lot more opportunities to make new friends and have guild opportunities open up organically rather than through applications.
---
Groups will often be looking for healers in dungeons. Join those groups, consistently do a decent job, don't be an asshole, and players will remember you fondly.
---
It seems like you've got a great attitude. You'll do just fine.
---
I'd block out the name of the place you're working at, it's clearly visible on the computer screen lol
---
I'm glad I asked haha thanks for the pro tip
---
It's layout is vastly inferior to joana's, sadly.
---
Ya farming gold takes real skill
---
Good point.  A true WoW playlist would need to include St. Anger.
---
Nexus crystals and arcanite
---
This is def me. Having played the beta I realized I have 2 options, use my 2-3 hours on weekends before the kid gets up to play wow, or to continue my woodworking. Going option 2.
---
People have this image that it's poor Chinese farmers crammed into warehouses doing this shit when it was actually multinational companies with skyscraper offices in Hong Kong and tens of millions in nvestment capital from Goldman Sachs and the like.
---
There’s probably few sources contributing to global warming in Azeroth so they are doing us a favor. We about to freeze otherwise!
---
i'll move to wherever realm i can play!!
---
She's at church :/
---
well it could be if Blizzard just sells tokens. But if blizzard won't sell the gold, somebody always will.
---
Perks of a chronic condition.. time off on demand :|
---
No problem! Good luck my friend!
---
God have mercy on us
---
That sounds cool dude, will give you a message :)
---
The answers in this thread should point to how subjective it is and how little stats exist lol
---
Haha right. I assembled basically a mini guild of people that would summon me to open the ubrs door for them. Eventually it just became free gold 
---
I'm honestly excited for Dire Mail tribute runs they where really fun to.
---
As a warlock, I've got Hellfire and Life Tap.  
---
However, I will still pick up SoID since it's invaluable in PvP, and it's a good shoutout for people who don't know about it.
---
10 days is pretty average.
---
Unless you're something like a mage or hunter, AND you're purely focusing on leveling, not fucking around in dungeons or doing professions, you aren't likely to get 6 days.
---
It's not as good as it is on pservers
---

I found my 60 UD priest on retail that I hadn't played since TBC launched when i re-subbed to reserve my name and I had like all of 2 pieces of actual BIS gear (not including my 2 T1 pieces I had) and we had Rag on farm and were working through BWL, too.
---
Pets were mostly useless in raids (why hunters get a bad rep) so Locks were 'saved' by being able to grab Demonic sacrifice in demonology (sac the succubus for 15% shadow damage buff) and the ruin talent from destruction.
---
If you can become friends with a bunch of rogues and warriors you can burn through content. Look into what some of those groups did. They cleared all of Mc in under a half hour.
---
As a Yankee fan.......2004 would’ve been a dead giveaway for me
---
Just don't get addicted!
---
Better in speed maybe, the layout is awful in comparison though.
---
#By Fire be PURGED!!
---
No one is claiming that it does. It's akin to LFG in modern wow, not LFD, though it does have some functionality beyond LFG.
---
That's definitely a possibility, I'm thinking that all 4 of the servers will be full by the 2nd or 3rd day. They said the AMA that they may be opening new servers if demand is high enough so they are expecting it as well. Either way I think it'll definitely be the most interesting server to play on, especially in phase 2 when there is honor but no BGs.
---
Why do you talk so weird?
